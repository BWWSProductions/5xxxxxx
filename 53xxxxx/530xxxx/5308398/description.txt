NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

Ok here's a resynced version for all you whiners...saying half hearted release,and moaning the last release was out of sync(even though we stated it was).

Firstly half hearted my arse.....like to see half of you moaners do better with the raw sources.....it's alot easier to fix something thats already had 95% of the work already done for ya,but theres alot more to it when your working with raw files.

Also those saying it was mins out of sync are talking crap......it was out of sync in 4 parts 2x 100ms,1x 200ms and 1x300ms....The only way to get it almost a min out of sync is by converting it to dvd with apps like convertxtodvd and have the "don't fix audio gaps" unticked.

Having that option unticked will throw it further out of sync due to the audio delay on the audio track as there was no audio for the intro around 54seconds i think.

Anyway here you enjoy a resynced version.
