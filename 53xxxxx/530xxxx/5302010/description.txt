***The Bluetones - "science and Nature" and "Expecting to Fly" - 320kbps***


UK Britpop quartet, the Bluetones, enjoyed a blistering start to their career with no less than three fanzines dedicated to them before they'd even released their third single, "Slight Return". It was to be their biggest hit, reaching number 2 on the UK singles chart. Their debut album, EXPECTING TO FLY--named after a classic Buffalo Springfield song--reached number 1 in the UK album charts in February 1996. Many pundits predicted greater things for the band, although ultimately their lack of originality may be a stumbling block. RETURN TO THE LAST CHANCE SALOON attempted to make a clean break from the style of their debut, but with limited success. The album was also met by a worryingly indifferent commercial response. Their third album, 2000's SCIENCE AND NATURE marked a more successful attempt to retool their sound, although their commercial heyday had passed a dedicated following allowed the band to stay afloat.
