,fresch3000,2010-01-31T16:09Z,"no, NOT your work.

My Work.

So why not, reffer to the original torrent, so people can get the help they need, with the original guide i wrote for how to get the game to work,

instead of just posting the torrent, with no explanation what so ever?

Here is my original torrent, with guide, comments etc. etc.

,kludge420,2010-02-23T18:35Z,My guess why this is up here is because your torrent has not seeds...
,RomanSPQR,2010-02-25T21:31Z,"works on snow leopard 10.6.2. graphics and glitches can be fiddled with to get decent images and playable game.

I was hoping it would run on a hackintosh netbook, but sadly it did not.

otherwise good seed."
,Thetmes,2011-08-15T16:05Z,"There is no seeders on you torrent fresch3000, guess why as stated above this one is upp.

But there is a small problem, it dont run as i its supposed to. 
I get to the see the intro movie then the loadingscreen, then it get stuck, nothing happens after that. No menu or so comes upp..
I so wanted to play this again, hope there is a solution."
,ColdanCursed,2012-02-09T11:57Z,"I love this game to death - Sadly this torrent does not work for me. I'm running 10.7.3 (Lion) on my macbook... When I use the application my resolution goes all funny, screen goes black and I get a crosshair like mouse.. It hangs untill I cmd+alt+esc (ctrl+alt+delete) and fix the resolution... =/ I'll try to mess with it a bit later - this game is a very good one that I really want for my gaming collection.

*Note: This torrent worked for me back when I had snow leopard. "
