Dungeon Keeper 2 for Mac

Dungeon Keeper 2 is a strategy game developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1999.



Important Information.

When first Launched, the game window will seem small, as the game Menu, and the "Real" game, (Campaign, Skirmish), etc, doesnt share the same screen resolution.
So dont worry. The game will go full screen when the Campaign is launched :)

No support for Widescreen...

Not my work btw, so no credits for me :-)
