Kate & Anna McGarrigle's 1982 classic Love Over and Over

MP3 from 1990's reissue CD. For some reason they included the super-cheesy "A Place In Your Heart" from the "Feed The Folk" benefit record instead of the excellent, contemporaneous B-side "Babies, If I Didn't Have You." I would have included it, but unfortunately my vinyl collection is a continent away...




RIP Kate. We miss you already. 



P.S. Assuming this isn't out of print where you live, if you love it... please buy it!
