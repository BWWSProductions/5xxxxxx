Couldn't it be reasoned that the Bible might be accurate and it WILL share some of the stories with other cultures if those stories are true? If something is true, isn't it logical that more than one persons might have other versions of the event? So, the Bible is myth, although it was the ONLY Book on the planet that correctly identified King Nebuchadnezzar, the Prophet Isaiah, said that the universe had a beginning, said that animals can ONLY reproduce after their kind (and I can go on for hours with more examples!) when modern science and historians said these never existed or the Bible was wrong. Now, science and history are just catching up with some of the things written in the Bible thousands of years prior. It is now a proven historical fact that King Nebuchadnezzar and the Prophet Isaiah lived when and where the Bible said they did. Myth my foot! Your problem is not with the Bible, but it's with judgment. You try to denounce the Bible so you can live and support your sinful life. Good luck to you on the day of judgment. You will have NO excuse. Also, your logic is so flawed (""All you have to do is study the religions of Sumer, (Babylonia and Iran) Egypt and Greece. You'll find the same or similar stories abound.""). That's like saying something is happening in society and only one news organization should have the story. Obviously if something happens, many cultures WILL have something to say about it. In fact, doesn't that lend credence to the notion that those events DID happen since so many cultures reported it? Quit listening to brainless folks like Richard DUH-kins and think for yourself."

You sound like an educated person who has succumbed to the religion virus yourself. I have heard various versions of Mother Goose Stories from different cultures, but that doesn't make them true...
