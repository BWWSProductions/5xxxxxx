Based on http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5021488/VMware_Mac_OSX_10.5.7, updated to 10.5.8, it now includes drivers and vmware tools (which means the screen resolution is variable and you have AUDIO) AND IT BOOTS (if you use the included bootloader).

Instructions:

This VMware image works on VMware workstation and player, tested on debian/GNU/Linux and windows xp.
NOTE only works on Intel pcs with hardware virtualization enables

How to get it working:
1: install VMware player or workstation
2: extract rar files
3: edit the settings so it loads bootloader.img on boot (in virtual CD drive)
4: start it
5: do what the installer asks

Password is what you tell it to be, same with username.

Rearchived, reuploaded, rechecked, should work

note:

You MUST have:
1. an Intel CPU:
1.1 with Intel VT-x
1.2 not all Intel CPUs with Intel 64 have Intel VT-x

2. motherboard BIOS that supports Intel VT-x
2.1 Intel VT-x activated in BIOS, most are disabled by default
2.2 there are still quite a number of mobo BIOS that don't support Intel VT-x

3. VMware (either one)
3.1 VMware Workstation 7 and above
3.2 VMware Player 3 and above
3.3 VMware Fusion 3 and above
3.4 not sure which version of VMware Server is required.

if display is screwed up, just resize VMware window (or restore/maximize) and back, and the display should refresh itself.
