plot:
The Original 50's classic about a decent middle aged school teacher who 
goes to teach in an unruly high school filled with thugs led by Vic Morrow.
This is the original film that has had several unofficial updated remakes 
over the years.  
Richard Dadier earns a teaching assignment at a tough high school, where
the teenagers make the rules and the staff meekly accept the fact that 
they've lost control. When Dadier tries exerting his authority, he receives
much hostility from both students and faculty, culminating with his pregnant
wife receiving anonymous letters with false accusations that he is romantically
involved with another woman at school. In anger, Dadier hurls an accusation at 
Gregory Miller, a black youth whom he fears is against him. Miller doesn't deny
 the accusation. Instead he escalates the confrontation, but does that mean that
 he was the culprit?
