,quia1979,2010-03-07T17:57Z,"If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, You will be saved.
For with the heard one believes unto righteousness and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.
(The Bible says:EVERY knee will bow and EVERY tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord!) 
Just because you renounce Christ doesn't mean doesn't exist."
,kritias,2011-07-25T20:42Z,"It's funny how much people hate Christianity because a bunch of pagans and witches posed as Christians in the catholic church long enough.

And I also think it's funny how the guy named ""metaliica"" sounds like the devil himself, just cursing up a storm.
""brainwash your children to believe in some shit that came from when we humans where dumb fuck ups who didnt even know why the grass growed""
... ""to believe in some shit that we came from""
... ""that we came from""
... ... ...
So, you're saying we came from God?
I think you got all riled up and accidentally spilled the beans."
