,broad1rage,2010-01-28T19:02Z,I have klite codec pack installed and have been able to play all video formats till now. This file i downloaded refuses to play. The audio plays but the there is no video. Just pure blank. I loaded the movie in avidemux and it loads there and the video shows but i want to play it in windws media player or classic media player which isn't working. Any help guys?
