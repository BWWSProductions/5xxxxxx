B-List actresses be warned and flattered because FELT is back! Slug (Atmosphere) and Murs (Living Legends) reunite for their third release from moniker FELT. These MCs teamed up with The Grouch (Living Legends) in 2002 to release FELT's debut album A Tribute to Christina Ricci. Collaborating with producer Ant (Atmosphere) in 2005 resulted in their second coming A Tribute to Lisa Bonet. With the fresh addition of Aesop Rock (Def Jux) on production and unwavering love for those forgotten actresses who warmed their hearts, Slug and Murs are pleased to present FELT 3: A Tribute to Rosie Perez.
