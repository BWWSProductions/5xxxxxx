Eric Clapton built a reputation as one of the world's best blues-guitarists with John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers
and supergroup Cream, before moving onto another supergroup, the short-lived Blind Faith.
He then formed Derek and the Dominos, and they released Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (1970).
It was met with a mixed reception but has since been reappraised as a classic rock album.
