Little Love Affairs is Nanci Griffith's sixth album, and it had similar success to her preceding Lone Star State of Mind on the Billboard charts. The album topped out at #27 on the Country Albums chart and one of its tracks entered into the Top 40 of the Hot Country Singles chart: "I Knew Love" rose to #37. Two more tracks also charted, but at much lower positions: "Never Mind" at #58, and "Anyone Can Be Somebody's Fool" at #64. However, that was to be the last time that any of Griffith's songs would enter the country singles charts at all, because no single from any subsequent album would rise even that high.
