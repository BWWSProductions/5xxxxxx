anyone have the vol. 17 torrent?"
,Anon_I_Mouse,2010-01-29T00:38Z,"I didn't forget to do it, for some reason I just can't (?) do it; I've been trying for a week. Whenever I try to upload I get either done (showing a blank page), wrong Capcha code (when it obviously isn't) or Error 404 - page not found.

I've tried remaking the torrent, two different browsers, clearing all cookies, rebooting, with VPN on and off and from different IPs (UK, NL & USA). This is driving me round the bend. If anybody's got any suggestions I'd be glad to hear them. "
