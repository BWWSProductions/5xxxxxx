NOTE: V2 of TS is better, however, picture is colorless and too dark. Audio is from cam mic, thin and crappy as usual.
Sample is included, download it first - then decide. Do not bother me with complaining about, it's your choice.
Let say A6/V6 upfront.

I recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.
VLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.
One can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.
QuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.
PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.
And please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.

WARNING: 
If you limit your upload speed during the download FOR WHATEVER REASON, youâ€™ll be kicked-out for good. I am sick and tired not only of Hit&Run, but of 90% who think Iâ€™m some kind of â€œfree launchâ€ downloading service. NO â€“ ITâ€™S ABOUT SHARING. If you do not want or can or care to share, please, go someplace else. Consider this as one friendly warning.
