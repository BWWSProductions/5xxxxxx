""....at 2010-01-22 19:03 CET:
dude i can see only one torrent on ur homepage...

>twentyforty at 2010-01-22 19:34 CET:

About page and one torrent... Yeah, I have noticed that too on IE - then I switched to FireFox and everything looks fine."
,Kaovar,2010-01-22T19:51Z,"Same problem using Opera, but yes, Firefox has no problems."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-22T20:15Z,"@semitoee: LOL, ""Video Not Found"".

I guess download is - safer. And as proved many times - cheaper, in any sense...

BTW, you speak nice for a spammer. Thank you."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-22T20:40Z,"@russel2: According to what I have heard and reviews I've read - never. Sorry if that sounds bad, but I have so many things to do and I am just one guy on crappy, two years old PC with semi-decent internet connection who singlehandedly obtain and encode all this stuff."
,lilars26,2010-01-22T22:23Z,Explorer is working now.
,valu59er,2010-01-22T22:31Z,"Hi 20 40 Thanks for latest.. being human,castle 
Little dorrit and the devils whore read well.. my types of show.
Hard to get though.
Did you encode them?or are you going to one day?
OK to wait.Know the show season is beginning.
Either way thanks for all your work."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-22T22:37Z,"@zmacdaddy8: Absolutely, if one have money and can make to the theater. I have not the first one and the second one would be what humans call miracle.

@lilars: Thanks, I tried immediately and it works fine. Frames are differently shown in IE (and Opera) and guys from TPB gave fine-tuning."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-22T22:51Z,"@valu59er: Newest Little Dorrit (because it has been done before) and Devils whore are keepers, I burned them while ago and gave to my mother. Being Human Season One was here, up, few days ago - it was true disaster and targeted I guess by all scumbags around. After a week and seeded 5 GB (equivalent of my 30 TV shows) I gave up and have removed the torrent. Being Human Season Two is on my schedule, but it will be wise if you get torrent same day when I up one (things are hairy here, right now). And... I am also limited in my upload abilities and I cannot do Season Packs without suicidal tendencies. So, season-packs - no.

Today's Castle (probably the last ever) would go now and was delayed by REPACK. I filled that slot with Book of Eli. Well, that's all."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-22T22:58Z,"Sorry valu59er, REPACK of Castle was upped yesterday. Same thing happened today with Mentalist and obviously caused some mix-up in my mind. Sorry, I meant Mentalist but wrote Castle. "
,valu59er,2010-01-22T23:20Z,"LOL phew thats a relief I wondered whose Castle I was uping for a min there he he
"
,the_shroud,2010-01-23T01:52Z,"Re Being Human Season1: I was still struggling at less than 1kb/s before I went to bed, but when I woke, lo and behold, its completed. Now, I'm not giving up on it and will continue to seed however long it takes to get well above 100%.
Thank you all, whoever out there, that came in the middle of the night with generous seeds.
And thank you 20-40 for encoding it. Cheers"
,valu59er,2010-01-23T02:05Z,"OOps I ment I'm seeding Castle....
Will wait for your DL of the mentalist since I know it's comeing."
,thadream101,2010-01-23T04:52Z,does anyone use comments to rate the torrent anymore?
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-23T08:06Z,"@thadream101: People have complained that ""rating mechanism"" is broken. Since I cannot check it by myself, I guess it's true."
,lilars26,2010-01-23T19:07Z,The man upstairs says A-6 V-6 and I believe him.Thanks 20/40 and thanks to the ones who stayed to seed.
