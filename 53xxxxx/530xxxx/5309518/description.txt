 A lot of excitement has been building about 'Fearsome Engine' over the last 2 
 years.                                                                        
                                                                               
 The teaming up of two producers, Tristan and Laughing Buddha, both highly     
 accomplished and widely respected artists, was always going to grab the       
 attention of the trance massive. Adding to this, their legendary live         
 performances at some of the biggest festivals on the planet have gone to prove
 that all the hype was for good reason.                                        
                                                                               
 Fearsome Engine now brings us their debut album, 'Biting Point'. Full power,  
 no-holds- barred PsyTrance created for full mental dancefloor grinding! Be    
 prepared.
