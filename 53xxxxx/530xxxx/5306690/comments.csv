,matsta_3,2010-09-27T04:21Z,These files do not work correctly and require repair.  Unfortunately this torrrent is not worth your time downloading
,name2long,2010-10-03T06:35Z,"I don't know what matsta_3 is smoking, but clearly they've never used VLC Media Player. The first file plays just fine, and I'm fairly sure the rest will, too. 

I wonder whose payroll matsta_3 is on, given the same stupid comment on all the Robin Hood individual season torrents."

,MarkIsBored88,2011-09-12T21:50Z,Seeders needed. I will Seed once I've downloaded.
