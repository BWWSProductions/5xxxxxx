I tried the best encoding settings to fit this 2h 38mn long movie in 400 megs.. so guys don't post negative comments on the quality, trust me its the best that you can get in 400 megs, I have given 4 tries to rip it..

enjoy.."

i really love your uploads! great for users like me who have low bandwidth.
i just have one small suggestion..
when it comes to movies which are 100 minutes or less could you make their sizes smaller to like 350mb and 300mb?
i'd really appreciate it!
thx"

I still don't understand how you can make an mkv file so small with such excellent quality, but this is something else!  Second movie I've seen from MKVGuy now.  Keep 'em comin' pal!"
