,verbalillusion,2012-01-24T03:31Z,"I found this
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6282059/FLV_to_AVI_MPEG_WMV_3GP_MP4_iPod_Converter_5.3.0402__Full-Versio
to be one of the better converters. You can keep the same video ratio which was the biggest plus for me.

Awesome upload btw :D"
,borkkrob,2012-03-31T20:09Z,"I'd just like to point out that I only chose to download the series in this form because the website for the guild offers the entire first season for free and then in all following seasons offers nearly all of it but starts the series six or seven episodes in.

I would have actually paid to watch the others since the series is funded by donations from fans except the only way to do that was to order dvds of entire seasons. Perhaps if they start searching for unauthorised redistributions of their show and happen across this comment they'll see that they're missing out on a potential revenue stream by relying on DVDs as their distribution form. It seems especially ironic given what much of the show itself is about and the characters within it that they should rely on a physical medium for content delivery"
