,kabalizo,2010-01-30T16:52Z,Great show i'be heard. Thanks.
,RickAf,2010-01-31T20:06Z,"Anyone know what happened to the seeders? My download rocketed through to 33.1% and it has been sitting there for days, with hundreds of other torrent clients also sitting on 33.1% ???"
,TheDSFSTeam,2010-02-01T22:18Z,"Hey RickAf,

We will seed this torrent from a few computers tonight and we will get you past 33.1%

Happy Seeding,

The DSFS Team"
,RickAf,2010-02-02T05:48Z,"Hi DSFS Team - thanks a lot for the offer of assistance! I'm not sure if my ISP had a problem or if my DSL line was down for some reason last night but my torrent is still sitting at 33.1%, with about 25 peers connected, 22 of them also at 33.1% and the others around 29% and DL'ing. Did the seed machines come online last night? "
,TheDSFSTeam,2010-02-02T22:06Z,"unfortunately we were having a few technical problems and we were only able to run 2 out of the 5 computers we have but as soon as we get everything online again we will have all of them running.  i would say it would be either by tonight or tomorrow morning.
If you would like, e-mail us at dsfsteam@yahoo.com and we can add you to our mailing list for quick updates and new torrents"
,RickAf,2010-02-04T06:04Z,"Hi DSFS Team - Just wanted to check if your Seeds had been back online? I'm a bit puzzled - my bittorrent client (VUZE) shows 6 seeds in the Swarm and plenty of peers (all sitting at 33.4% like me or less). Since my initial message, my DL % increased from 33.1 to 33.4% about 2 days ago, since then nothing. I have seen a couple of seeds at 100% appear once or twice in the past three days for a short while, however they didn't seem to connect to anyone, I tried refreshing the tracker, starting and stopping the download etc - but nothing happens. There are hundreds of us sitting at 33.4% - please help!!"
,TheDSFSTeam,2010-02-05T03:27Z,"Hey Rick,

We finally got everything back up and running and we now have a server that will be seeding 24/7.   Sorry for the inconvenience. "
,tekaderickson360,2010-02-07T19:04Z,I so don't understand this stuff yet. Will somebody explain to me what seeding is. No I'm not blonde just new at this stuff that's all.
,nightcock,2010-02-20T01:29Z,please seed - the torrent on my Vuze has been at 34.8% for a few days now :(
,Ikoby,2010-04-06T17:36Z,"SEED!!! please, I have to get this (="
,bopemannen,2010-04-20T04:35Z,"Why isnÂ´t anyone seeding !?
IÂ´m stuck at 34,8%..."
,jwwillia25,2010-05-10T03:44Z,"Please seed this, stuck at 38.4% and no seeders!"
,kpg1970,2010-06-14T04:09Z,"only 3 seeders in the swarm, the rest stuck at 34.8%...HELLO??"
,kpg1970,2010-06-15T08:55Z,I emailed you DSFS...you have not responded. I assume you aren't planning on seeding this torrent? This sucks.
,Motormod,2011-03-11T20:06Z,"Balls! It died completely at 34,7!
I'd love some seeds, anyone! :o"
,Motormod,2011-03-11T20:54Z,Pleease people!! Needs for seeds here! (=
,iiim92,2011-11-10T02:07Z,"Hey DSFSTeam,
