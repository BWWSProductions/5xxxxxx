,ZenRhino,2010-01-23T04:38Z,IMDB says there were only 8 episodes to this show... not counting the reunion special - so which is this since I see no reference to episode 10 anywhere? 
,stu3ufc,2010-01-23T06:44Z,"this is a great copy of the reunion show

this is not episode 9 the season finale

10/10 thank you"
,downrightfierce,2010-01-23T11:04Z,any chance of the finale finding its way online?
,TPC1996,2010-01-23T11:33Z,"we are missing Episodes 8 and 9 from the tvteam...im not complaining but it would be nice if you could do proper rips for these episodes the webrips aren't really all that good considering all the jersey shore proper rips have been done by you....

please man could you rip these two episodes...thanks in advance"
,ChaosCon,2011-03-12T06:52Z,Just in case it isnt clear...  This is not S01E10.  This is S00E11: The season 1 reunion show.
