,baybreeze,2010-04-26T09:31Z,I just downloaded this and it plays back blotchy and stuttering in VLC and WMP.It won't even play past 5 mins in. It's so disappointing because I really wanted to watch this!

Works perfect for me! The style of filter used in a lot of this film is purposely grainy and over exposed, so don't fret.

Awesome film, awesome quality."
