soon I Will Be Invincible is a novel by Austin Grossman. It was published by Pantheon Books in New York on 5 Jun 2007. The paperback edition was published by Vintage Books in June of 2008.

The novel is told through two alternating first person narratives of the characters Dr. Impossible and Fatale. Dr. Impossible is a self-proclaimed supervillain of the mad genius variety, who suffers from Malign Hypercognition Disorder ("evil genius" syndrome). Fatale is a female cyborg and the novel begins with her called up to join the superhero group The Champions, a Justice League of America/Avengers-style team in the wake of the disappearance of the superhero CoreFire.

The novel is set in the modern world with superheroes. It takes a realistic look at the lives and motivations of superheroes and villains without parodying or deconstructing the genre.

The title, apart from a generic supervillainous claim, relates to the third, and least thought-out, element of Dr. Impossible's plan: he has to become invincible.
