What this Vid has done for me is realise that what I was looking for was actually me!!

This vid has taught me is to look to myself for fullfillment...

If you are like I was and your open and know there is something more but your not sure what to believe, then vid is for you"

I'm looking forward to the Astonishing Power of Emotions book, points within being touched on apparently by the similarly-named 1 hr video.

There are also the ""Ask and It Is Given"" DVD and book which may be of use to some as an introduction to the Abraham-Hicks multiconsciousness entity.

Also be on the looking for the 15-DVD ""Art of Allowing"" series, also available via TPB courtesy of nrggirl, as 15 separate multi-gigabyte torrents."
