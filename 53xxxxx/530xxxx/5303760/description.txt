From Recorded Books:

With Gorky Park, Martin Cruz Smith won critical praise and a global readership by introducing the world to Russian detective Arkady Renko. Stalinâ€™s Ghost is Cruzâ€™ sixth mystery featuring Renko, who this time out is faced with uncovering the truth behind sightings of Stalinâ€™s ghost in the Moscow subway.

â€œ... earnest unsentimentality and calm tenaciousness on the hunt are what make Renko one of the most interesting detectives in modern fiction.â€â€”Carl Hiaasen

A high-stakes tale set in Moscow follows the machinations of a group of reactionaries who harbor a nostalgic loyalty to the regime of Joseph Stalin and who plot to create a groundswell for a new dictatorship.
