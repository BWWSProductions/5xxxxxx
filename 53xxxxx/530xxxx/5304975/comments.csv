,Coltbear50,2010-02-01T00:20Z,"Thanks very much for this. I am going to make the donation of $7.99 as soon as I receive my check, which is a very small price to pay for excellent music from diverse musicians coming together for much needed relief for all Haitian people.

It's also heartening to see all of the record companies doing exactly the same by putting all licensing issues aside and making this VERY accessible and easy to donate to from MANY different sources. It's a shame that it takes something horrific and tragic as this or 9/11 to make them do so when you think about it, though. Still, they (as everyone else involved), are to be commended for doing so.
