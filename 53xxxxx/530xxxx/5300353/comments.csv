WHICH means that this is a 2010 dvdrip so fuck off for the people that want to complain about the year i put in my titles"
,ianpark01,2010-01-23T06:33Z,"Ive downloaded another that was meant to be  the same 1 XoLWoX so called ripped off at the same time... what 1 d'loaded faster... yep XoLWoX's and that 1 had less seeders and leechers, i dont mind re-seeding when others play the sharing game properly...... thanks XoLWoX and all the seeds & peers that know how to torrent share :)"
,Damascus25,2010-01-24T01:41Z,"I'm a supporter of your LW, but to an extent I agree with the Year issue.  You are always right in that the DVD will be released in 2010, but anytime a movie is listed with a year anywhere else online or otherwise the year listed is the year it was released in theaters.  It could be confusing for some people, especially when low-budget filmmakers frequently make knock off movies with the same or similar names only a year or less after the real one's released.  Nobody cares when the DVD is released that stuff can get pushed back or brought forward any number of weeks, when it came out is more important to most.  I'm not trying to be like Knock or anything, but it's a point of view that I have so I'm giving it to you, you seem to be smart enough to know I'm not being just another dick on here."
,Nismo07,2010-01-26T03:53Z,"XoLWoX, Actually both of you are correct the ""boxoffice"" goes by the theatrical release date when referring to movies but most people think of the DVD release date when talking about movies.  It was in theaters in 2009 but the dvd is gonna hit in 2010."
,Tomskeet,2010-01-26T21:45Z,"Who the f@$k cares about the year of the movie anyway, it's the same movie either way. You pussy's that have a problem with this should go find a torrent with a virus, so you have a real reason to complain. I thought you were supposed to comment on the quality and stuff here. By the way, how is the quality?"
,PowerShocker,2010-01-27T05:50Z,"just wondering, what is there to gain from taking someone elses rip and having people download/seed it?...are there prizes involved? or like a point system?"

,Damascus25,2010-02-04T15:09Z,"Hey thanks Emery for being a thief, just like LW's a thief.  Give yourselves a pat on the back."
,thescumhunter,2010-02-12T18:54Z,"For someone to bitch about ripping of there torrent is so fuckin stupid as they ripped it in the first place. (So stop bitchin like kids and grow up) we torrent users dont care if he did or did not rip it from your upload. All we care about is getting what we want (So Thanks for the upload where ever you may have getting it from) P.s    I will leave a comment on watchability soon

Ripping a rip  (lol) "
