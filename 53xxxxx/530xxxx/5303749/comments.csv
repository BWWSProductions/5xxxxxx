,sk8rboi2,2011-02-19T00:41Z,"can anyone confirm this is the complete audiobook? i filenames are suspect --- 01-02, 01-04, 01-06 etc --- and i found myself suddenly lost around chapter 5 by a shift from moscow to prypiat... the story goes from ivanovs apartment and arkadys discovery skipping the spoiler stuff i pasted below. hes just suddenly in ukraine with no explanation.



**** SPOILER *****



A HazMat team re-examines the apartment and Pasha's body, and finds that the salt was mixed with a small quantity of Cesium-137, an isotope that looks identical to salt, but is lethally radioactive. After confirming that his apartment was filled with radiation, Pasha swallowed a large quantity of the salt before jumping, to try and protect people entering the apartment later.

A week after Arkady's discovery, Pasha's business partner, Timofeyev, is found brutally murdered near Pripyat, Ukraine, in the ""dead zone"" around the site of the Chernobyl disaster. Arkady's superior, fed up with his insuboordination, posts him to Ukraine to ""investigate"" this murder, with no assistance, and virtually no resources."
,sk8rboi2,2011-02-19T01:00Z,NEVERMIND! its all good! still listening and its summarizing the 'missed' stuff in flashback...
,sk8rboi2,2011-02-19T01:10Z,this is the first arkady renko audiobook ive really liked since gorky park. guy reading books 2-4 (frank muller) is too melodramatic in his vocalization but henry strozier is perfect.
