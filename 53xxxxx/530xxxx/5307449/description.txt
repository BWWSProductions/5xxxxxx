Here are the best of the songs sung by Mr. Al Martino including those that he 
is best known for such as "I have but one heart" from The Godfather movie

Note: For those still trying to download our Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin 
torrent offerings, Im pleased to indicate we at present have 368k of bandwidth
available on our two servers combined and will shortly improve on this too.

- Perhaps the best of the Cronners, Al Martino sings with great depth of real feeling 
from the soul.
