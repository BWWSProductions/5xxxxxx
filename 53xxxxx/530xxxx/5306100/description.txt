Synopsis.

Simon of the Desert | Mexico | 1965 | Directed by Luis Bunuel
                                  
Forty minutes is more than enough screen time for Spanish director Luis Bunuel to 
state his case in Simon of the Desert. Claudio Brook portrays fifth-century 
Christian Simon (later St. Simon Stylites) who dispenses religious sagacity while 
standing on a tall column in the middle of the desert. Typical of Bunuel's hatred of the Church, the Devil (Silvia Pinal) is a far more entertaining and articulate 
spokesperson for his point of view than Simon is for Christianity. An abrupt,
ill-suited ending suggests that Bunuel either tired of the subject and wanted to moveon to other things, or that he ran out of money and had to wrap before the process servers showed up. This Mexican film was originally titled Simon del Desierto.
