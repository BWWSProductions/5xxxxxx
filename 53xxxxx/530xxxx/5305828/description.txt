Product Description:
Mario returns and takes his next adventure into space. Follow him as he travels from planet to planet bending the rules of gravity. Players experience perspective shifts as they run upside down through alien worlds. Meet challenges like surfing on a ray in an ocean in the clouds, rolling a ball through a treacherous garden, or floating in a bubble over a poisonous swamp. Control Mario with the Wii Remote and use the Nunchuk to perform his special moves. A special co-op function allows a second player to collect star bits for Mario or take care of enemies in his way. This title also includes opportunities to change Mario into a Boo or a bee.
