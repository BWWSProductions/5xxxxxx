Hi Everyone

This Islamic guide is for non-Muslims who would like
to understand Islam, Muslims (Moslems), and the Holy
Quran (Koran). It is rich in information, references,
bibliography, and illustrations. It has been reviewed
and edited by many professors and well-educated people.
It is brief and simple to read, yet contains much scientific
knowledge. It contains the whole book, A Brief Illustrated
Guide to Understanding Islam, and more

Regards
Mr.Najem
