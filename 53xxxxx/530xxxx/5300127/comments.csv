A helpful hint to those people who are still downloading: it will go faster if you can share what you have with other people who are downloading as well. Each person gets a different piece of the file, so then sharing those pieces with each other WHILE you are downloading, increases the speed at which everybody get the total file so many times faster. So all you DLers (downloaders, aka Leechers) can share what you have with your other DLers, for the benefit of yourselves and all the other DLers."
,chazbroam,2010-01-25T00:12Z,"Please help me seed. When you are downloading you can help share your part with other Leechers - this speeds up your download time, plus it helps other Leechers download faster, too. If you have the whole torrent (i.e. all 4 files), then do not be stingy hogs - STAY & help seed."

Unfortunately, there is no way to tell you in ""newbie language"".  You likely will have to learn some technical stuff, especially if you are using a firewall (hopefully you are) and/or a router. There used to be a great tutorial on how to setup IRC (internet relay chat), but it's now gone. The principles are the same though.  You have to setup ""Port Forwarding"". There is a website  (http://www.portforward.com) which usually helps people with this. WHILE you are setting up port forwarding, go look at this tutorial, too: http://compnetworking.about.com/od/bittorrent/qt/bittorrentports.htm. Hope this helps."

,chazbroam,2011-05-04T01:12Z,"Just tell all those people who are having trouble watching/hearing (ie enjoying) the movie, you probably do not have the libav codec. A simple fix would be to go get the VLC Media Player, otherwise (if you are on a MS Windows machine) get ""ffdshow tryouts"". Both are easily findable on Google."

For those interested in what Debian is, and if you want it for yourself: http://www.debian.org/intro/about"
