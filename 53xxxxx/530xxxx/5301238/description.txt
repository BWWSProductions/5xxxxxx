"Glass Mask"/"Glass no Kamen" is an anime from 1984.

Glass Mask (ã‚¬ãƒ©ã‚¹ã®ä»®é¢, Garasu no Kamen?) is a shÅjo anime, based on the manga series written and illustrated by Suzue Miuchi. The title refers to the various masks[/roles] that an actor plays--"while expressing emotions that are not their own, the mask they wear (their acting) is as fragile as glass. If the actors are distracted, their mask will "break" and show on stage the actors' true feelings.""__via Wikipedia {http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Mask}

This is the .AVI files for the whole original series. I have been trying to complete the .RARS from {http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3542646/Glass_Mask_%5Bcomplete%5D} &but eventhough mine are the same file size and contain the same files, I have only been able to get the overall seeded file from 99.4% to 99.7%, so I am uploading my own version. I will have this seeding whenever I am able to for the next while.

I will also ask that if you download, that you please also help seed. This is a new torrent, and it needs to build-up strength!~
