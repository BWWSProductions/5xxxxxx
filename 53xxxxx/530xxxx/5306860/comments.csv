,luciferis,2010-01-25T13:46Z,Am downloading now... This his a very high probability of working because the same uploader did the Tatsunoko vs Capcom NTSC and he's done some other ones so he's most likely trustworthy. Go ahead and download this...

,kabalizo,2010-01-25T21:28Z,"Gee, plug some, do we? Just say thanks and tell us if THIS one works.
And thanks, uploader."
,b3trayed,2010-01-26T03:03Z, can we get some seeders PLease
,luciferis,2010-01-26T18:54Z,works fine with usb loader gx. I don't burn discs so idk bout that but if you want the iso you have to extract it
,luciferis,2010-01-26T18:57Z,"...forgot to say this... this has the error 002 so just so you don't have to waste a wii reboot cycle, i'm just letting you know... oh, and THANKS Markuf."
,peterrpann,2010-01-26T19:10Z,THANKS Markuf. XD
,theeboredone,2010-01-27T05:03Z,"So I downloaded this, and burned it on 4x using Imgburn like I do with every other game. I was using Neogamma R7 Rev 14, but it gave me the ""error 001: unauthorized device"". I tried upgrading to R8 Rev 17, but got the same stuff. Someone let me know what kinda loader they are using to play this game soon."
,peterrpann,2010-01-27T08:22Z,"theeboredone.
Neogama 6. Wii Menu :4,1. Error 002 Fix."
,theeboredone,2010-01-27T17:48Z,"Actually, it turns out I had to use rev 13A because the wii has a modchip inside it. Tatsunoko works now, along with my other games, but I keep getting a timeout error with NMH2. Might be a bad burn."
,asleroth,2010-01-28T02:27Z,Confirmed working on USB Loader GX with 002 error fix on! Great game! Loved the first NMH and this is even better!
