,Siovhan,2010-03-06T12:25Z,"this is PAL, not NTSC. the screen rolled & color was black & white, so i converted it to ntsc with a program called pal2ntsc .  a tiny part of the bottom of the screen is cut off which happens with most PAL converted games but the text/subtitles are still readable."
,Siovhan,2010-03-06T12:27Z,"you can get pal2ntsc thru warez-bb
check the ""make PN selector"" box when patching the iso"

1) What is the second file here for?

2) What exactly do I have to do to get this to work on my PS2? When I first burnt it the screen rolled and it was all black and white, then I attempted to use the pal2ntsc converter and when it prompted to me push square it wouldn't do anything. Am I just being stupid here?"

,funyums,2012-01-11T08:30Z,"so am i going to have to go out of my way to play this on swap magic slim ps2? i just wanna download, burn and play, please some help would be nice"
,theclaw1,2012-04-22T02:00Z,"menus and important text is translated. original character voices.

the game runs PAL video. to play it without hacks, you need a TV set that supports PAL.

PS2 is different from older consoles. All region PS2 systems are capable of any video mode. The only reason most NTSC users don't encounter PAL, is no NTSC region coded games request it."
