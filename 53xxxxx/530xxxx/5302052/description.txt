Synopsis.............: David Fowler (Reynolds) has two passions, sculpting and
                       women, and he's been quite successful in both
                       departments until now. David finds that this insatiable
                       hunger for women begins to render him socially, 
                       critically and, finally, sexually impotent. His
                       desperate inner struggle drives him to the couch of an
                       attractive psychiatrist, Marianna (Andrews), to whom
                       David reveals everything from his first sexual encounter
                       to his currently disturbing - and often hilarious -
                       romantic adventures. But can Marianna help David control
                       his roving eye before it's too late?
