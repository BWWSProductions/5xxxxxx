Alex also covers the latest news and takes a number of calls.


During most of the broadcast the primary topic is the extra-legal means being employed by the FBI, BATFE and police to intimidate gun owners and suppress the exercise of 2nd Amendment rights.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
