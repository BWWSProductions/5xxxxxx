IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
And here is our V2 of Eli......This time round we've used ELEKTRI4KA source files (thanks) and we used
Mentions audio as it saved us some time syncing :P
The audio file as been cleaned up some and had the EQ tweak before we remuxed it.We also tweaked the
video like we normally do and we also used the Quad crop filter which allows us to crop at angles so we could 
crop it without losing any of the picture.
Now yes it looks colourless and grey.....but we tweaked the colours the best we could do to the trailor and even though
look almost balck and white in most scenes.
Anyway enjoy the V2 release of this  :)
