,McRulle,2010-01-26T11:19Z,"I haven't found a serial anywhere. And since this is normaly not how you do the ""copy the crack"" procedure, could you be more specific? And what if your firewall doesn't block the game?"

,hackingone1,2011-06-28T00:28Z,"  5. Block rome.exe in fw.
     (or ip 94.75.242.20:40009)
This step is a huge hurdle to people who are not sure how to do it.

Solution that worked for me. I switch off my internet then I start the game. The serial number screen will not pop up. You can turn on your internet immediately after you start the campaign. The serial number screen will not pop up again. 

I tried many ways to do step 5 but I might be doing it wrongly. Turning off internet is a way easier solution."
,pig2011,2011-08-16T20:00Z,"work perfectly, thx

must turn off internet"
,gioaace,2011-10-01T23:13Z,i swear to god ive followed directions perfectly but im still getting the serial key request even after shutting my router off.... help
,gioaace,2011-10-01T23:22Z,i swear i followed directions and nothing i REPEAT nothing is doing the trick... wtf
,timbard,2012-03-11T20:28Z,"If you are having issues with the serial number do this

Open a CMD Prompt as an Admin (right click on CMD in the start menu and select ""run as administrator""

Then paste this into the box  

netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Block Kalypso Grand Ages Rome"" dir=out profile=any remoteip=94.75.242.20 remoteport=40009 protocol=TCP action=block"
