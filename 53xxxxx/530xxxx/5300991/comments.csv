,ValnezZz,2010-11-12T21:28Z,"I download the torrent, IT DID NOT WORK ! ! ! :( 
I installed the East Europe MAP from Computer to ANDROID HTC (where was ndrive installed from androidmarket) trou usb cable. 
When I start Ndrive, it finds the maps on phone, but above the maps, there is ATTENTION MARK, when I press  About-it tells me that the map is incompatible. 
When I press check-it tells me, that Map file is OK. 
And when I want to see the streets, it shows only my country, but no roads, no streets. On map, there is nothing-it is empty.

So what the hell. What is wrong? How Do I FIX this and how I get MAPS to work? Or this only Iphone app? To iphone, there is TomTom and Garmin app too and they work perfectly. 
So, UPLOADER, you tell me, that this app will not work on ANDROID with HTC phone ? ? ? "
