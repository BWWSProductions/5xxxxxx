Recommend playing h264 mp4s with KMPlayer or VLC Player.

Play on TV with PS3, XBox (2ch), WD HD TV, or Popcorn Hour."

,D-Punisher,2010-01-27T02:28Z,"I used to be able to stream .mp4 files on my ps3, but now all of them show as unsupported data. Can anyone help me it would be much appreciated."
,Yittle,2010-01-27T06:08Z,"Once again thank you so much for the wonderful uploads and awesome quality of the movies.  A long time follower of yours.  Recommend you to all my friends..tell them wait a bit SM will have a better copy and will be well worth the wait.  After reading in a comment that the SM group recommended it, I started to use ""Super"" to convert my movies and love it.  Now I come to you asking what you recommend to use for a burner/ripper program.  Before I started converting the movies with ""Super"" I used ""ConvertXtoDVD"". But I like Super so much I need a burner/ripper program that doesn't take hours to burn a DVD.  Thank you in advance."
,Yittle,2010-01-27T06:10Z,"Another small request, please... Would love to see ""Legion"" and Mel Gibson's new movie ""Edge of Darkness""  "
,doby1981,2010-01-28T06:16Z,"This is exceptional!!!

A=10
V=10

Quick question for anyone:  I'm playing this off my PS3.  How can I load the subtitles? Do I have to encode them?"
,Yittle,2010-01-28T09:16Z,"@doby1991, I know there is a way to do it using ConvertXtoDVD, so I have been told, but be damned if I can figure it out.  So if anyone knows how I would like to know too.  Also as asked earlier a good program to burn that doesnt take forever...I currently use ""Super"" to convert, tho have used ConvertXtoDVD to convert and burn in the past.  I like Super to convert.  Thanks "
