we have a much improved line-up in a 6.88GB CDG offering (or 4.8GB zipped)  which makes the older versions obsolete, and with many great additions plus better versions substitutions too. 

The complete 6.88GB cdg offerings is our best yet! unzipped cd+g and rar zipped
7.5GB Divx versions can be found on the net. These versions are vastly improved from our previous collections. The DivX offerings are improved with 1100k bitrate and are individually compressed into rar files for you.

Included here are almost all songs that Mr. Frank Sintra was either
best known for, or had recorded during some point of his career from
other of the great songs we all know and love.

Enjoy!
