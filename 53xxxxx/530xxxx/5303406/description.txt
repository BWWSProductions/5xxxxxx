Navigon MobileNavigator Europe 1.4.

What you need:

  1. ipod touch/iphone with gps reciever (tomtom car kit has a gps chip for the units that lack built-in chip, that reportedly works with Navigon)

  2. Jailbreak the unit, if not already done. http://www.blackrain.com

  3. Install appsync.

  4. Double-click on the .ipa file to import it into iTunes. (For some unknown reason I can't drag-and-drop any .ipa files, but double-clicking works fine.)

  5. Navigate away.

This Turn-by-Turn GPS navigator is in my own opinion far superior to TomTom navigator app to the iPhone, and here is why;

1. Choose either to pause or fade the ipod audio, in settings.
2. Jumps the gun with 5 to 10 meters, witch is good.
3. Menu navigation is very logical.
4. It "feels" more responsive.
5. Found my position in about 15 seconds after start of the program.

Follows OS language: Swedish OS menus = Swedish voice
