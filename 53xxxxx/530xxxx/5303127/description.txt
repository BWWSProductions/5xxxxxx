For the second of two shows in Birmingham, opening the show in front of a strongly 
pro-Panic crowd, the ABB showed why they are still the Heavyweight Champion of 
Jam Rock!

This show started on a bluesy note, with a killer version of the rarely played Muddy 
Waters tune "Can't Lose What You Never Had" standing out.  "You Don't Love Me" 
has been in heavy rotation on this tour, and this version shows why, the whole band hittin' 
the note and laying in the groove.  John Bell of Widespread Panic adds his distinctive 
vocal touch to the Van Morrison classic "And It Stoned Me," and this version of "Revival" 
stretches out and goes unusual places.

However, the "Mountain Jam>Smokestack Lightning>JaMaBuBu>Mountain Jam" 
sequence is what really sets this show apart.  Over 30 minutes of musical bliss!  After 
rocking the first half of "Mountain Jam," the band glides effortlessly into the laid-back 
blues groove of "Smokestack Lightning."  Jamband legend Col. Bruce Hampton whipped 
the crowd into a frenzy with his passionate vocals, as if he was channeling the spirit of 
Howlin' Wolf himself!  Then, after a great bass and drums segment, the band comes charging 
into the second half of "Mountain Jam" and Derek reaches for the stars on the famous slide solo 
that so many fans know from the Eat A Peach version.  Best "Mountain Jam" of 2009?  
You be the judge!

"Black Hearted Woman" is rarely played as an encore, but after this show, maybe 
it should be!  This powerhouse version is like a runaway train, building momentum 
constantly until the heart-stopping climax and setting a very high bar for Widespread Panic's 
closing set.  Oh yeah!
