When a new serial killer begins a reign of terror in Gotham City - wearing an ancient Japanese mask representing an Oni demon, but which looks uncannily like Batman's cowl - Bruce Wayne must revisit his training as a young man in Japan to find the connections between the Dark Knight and this new killer. Are the murders random? Or does someone close to the Batman know more than they're letting on?

Written and illustrated by the legendary manga creator Yoshinori Natsume (Togari, Kurozakuro).
