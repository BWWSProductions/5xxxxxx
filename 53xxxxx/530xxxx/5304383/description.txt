Get Physical 7th Anniversary Compilation - CD2(2009)-Mixed By M.A.N.D.Y


Patrick Bodmer and Philipp Jung have constantly been the DJs of choice when
it comes to summarising the label's output in mix CD form (with the pair also
lending their hand to Get Physical's second and fourth anniversary mixes), so
it's no surprise to see them return to the controls for the imprint's 7th
Anniversary Compilation. The collection centres on Get Physical's output from
the last three years, taking big singles like Patrice Baumel's "Roar" and
Italoboyz's "Zinga," and placing them alongside less obvious selections from
Thomas Schumacher, DJ T. and Mac Neumann. Ardent Get Physical collectors
should be happy to hear that there will be a raft of exclusive tracks
featured on the mix, including a new remix of Damian Lazarus' "Neverending"
by M.A.N.D.Y. and Alexkid, and a "Saxed Up" version of Dakars "I've Got That
Feeling."
