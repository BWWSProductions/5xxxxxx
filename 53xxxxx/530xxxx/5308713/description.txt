"Benegal's restlessness with narrative leads to this fascinating film based on Dharamvir Bharati's Hindi novel. Over three afternoons the raconteur Manek Mulla recounts stories to his friends who then analyse and assess them. The stories are interconnected and overlapping, shifting truths and points of view to break linearity. Benegal offers three fascinating women characters but ultimately the film examines male attitudes to love and romance. Made after a five year break from film-making, this marks a fresh repertory cast and is considered by many to be Benegal's masterpiece."
