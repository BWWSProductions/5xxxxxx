"Enter The Void" is the latest film by French director Gaspar Noe' and is being called by many his best yet. It seems to be a movie that either you "get it" or you don't. It is being compared to Stanley Kubrick' s"2001 A Space Odyssey" in both visual impact as well as the intelectual aspect of the plot.

My friend Rick Vacius, Director of the Flyway Film Festival, was at the Sundance Film Festival and saw the film. This episode features a discussion with Rick on his feelings about "Enter The Void"
