,I_Like_Toast,2010-01-23T02:53Z,Thank you :D
,pixiesmiles,2010-01-23T04:23Z,"To the uploader:  Thank you!  :)  *pets*... Please don't let the nay-sayers discourage you. There are obviously many of us who appreciate the work you are doing.  Sure would be nice if more of them would say so though.                                                             

-AND- in the spirit of the british....                                                            

josvaz:  shuddup ya WANKER.  If you had taken just 5 minutes to download a snippet of one of these files and checked it in VLC media player, you would have seen they are genuine and nice quality.  If you don't know enough, to know how to do this, then you obviously have NO business howling ""...fake...""  I suggest you keep your opinions to yourself until you know WTF you are talking about.                                                                                                                                    *sweet smiles*  TA!"

Agree [mov-is-crap]."
,cave79,2010-01-23T23:49Z,"If you feel mov is the evil, you can always re-encode it and reupload. Complaining about the format is really childish. Since mov is just a container anyways. A good player plays it without a problem."
,thruster999,2010-01-24T03:05Z,"Or

go elsewhere and get it in a good container

mov==crap"
,smorgs100,2010-01-24T05:25Z,"THANK YOU- THANK YOU -THANK YOU.
ALL THE WAY FROM AUSTRALIA, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!

WORKS FINE####
(Just like all the other uploads)"
,TheTrekhippy,2010-01-29T05:35Z,"So, uploader, why are these in .mov?  I mean, I've uploaded videos myself, even one from a VHS, and I turned it into an .avi.  Once you get the hang of it, it's not difficult."
