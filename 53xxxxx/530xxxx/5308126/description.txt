From Wiki:





Chantal Kreviazuk born May 18, 1974 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a Canadian singer-songwriter of the adult contemporary music genre. She is also a classically trained pianist, and can play the guitar.


Kreviazuk's first album, Under These Rocks and Stones, was released in Canada in 1996 and the U.S. in early 1997 to much critical praise.[citation needed] The album sold over 100,000 copies in the U.S., fueled mostly by the singles "Surrounded" and "God Made Me", while in Canada it went double platinum with sales of over 200,000. Three videos from the album receive modest play on the video channel MuchMusic and radio ("God Made Me", "Believer" and "Wayne" ), but it was a fourth, "Surrounded", that became her first major Canadian airplay hit in 1997. That year, Kreviazuk received her first Juno Award nomination as Best New Artist.

In 1999, Kreviazuk released her second album. Titled Colour Moving and Still, it featured tracks written with her new husband, Raine Maida, lead singer of Our Lady Peace. The lead single from the album "Before You" became a huge radio hit in Canada and she performed the single on the 2000 Juno Awards, where she won two awards for Best Adult/Pop Album and Best Female Artist. Kreviazuk released two more videos from the album, "Dear Life" and "Far Away", as well as an additional radio release, "Souls", which was also remixed and was released as a promo vinyl for the M1 & Steve Fernandez Remix.

Her third album, What If It All Means Something, was released in 2002. This album also featured multiple collaborations with Maida. The first single, "In This Life", was a hit in Canada. Kreviazuk performed the song live on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

Kreviazuk announced via her blog in August 2005 that she was writing and recording her fourth album in her home studio, with Maida producing. The first single off the album, "All I Can Do", was made available on her official website and MySpace page prior to the release of the album. On July 24 the album premiered on the Canadian music channel Much More Music along with a behind the scenes special. The album, Ghost Stories, was released August 29, 2006.

On October 28, 2008 she released her first compilation album, Since We Met: The Best of 1996-2006.

Plain Jane  2009


Plain Jane is the fifth studio album by singer/songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk. The album was released on October 13, 2009 in Canada, and is Kreviazuk's first release through Maple Music Recordings.

Named after the track Plain Jane, the title reflects Kreviazuk's feelings about living a double life. Splitting time between her native Canada and the United States, Kreviazuk lives a mostly anonymous life in California primarily as a working mom, while she leads a more public life in Canada as an established and recognizable singer songwriter.[1]

The song 5000 Days is considered by Kreviazuk to be a continuation to her 1999 Colour Moving And Still track Until We Die.[1]

Plain Jane features a guest appearance by Jazz musician Chris Botti on the title track, performing on the trumpet. Kreviazuk previously made a guest appearance on Botti's 2003 album A Thousand Kisses Deep, providing vocals for the track The Look of Love.

The closing track, Na Miso, contains lyrics in an African language about connecting with loved ones.[1] The song was written by and features vocals from Kreviazuk and Bibiane Mpoyo, a nanny of the family.

Two bonus tracks were available through the iTunes store. Backfires can be purchased with the iTunes version of the album, while Seclusion was available only through the pre-order of the album.

Invincible was featured in a commercial for Garnier Nutrisse, in which Kreviazuk is the spokesmodel.

On July 9, 2009, as partnership with Garnier Nutrisse Cream, Garnier Canada's website offered a free exclusive download of Ordinary People along with the chance to win tickets to one of Kreviazuk's upcoming shows.
