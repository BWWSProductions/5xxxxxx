,Tyler7975,2011-02-26T18:41Z,"well i read the thing after i had tried to update (i'm stupid), and will they actually come after me ? i'm a little scared right now as i have already been in deep for other shit recently and i really don't need this. i was just trying idefrag out before purchase and it didn't work so i'm happy i did but unfortunately i might be fucked now..."

,JINGYING28,2012-03-25T17:16Z,how come it doesn't seems to work on my lion?
,ChrisPDX,2012-04-13T17:21Z,"Be careful. iDefrag crashed on me while performing a ""Full Defrag"" and it messed up both my Macbook and at another time an external hard drive. I restored my MacBook from another time machine backup and now it is blazing fast once again. 

I'll seed this for a while, but I don't think I will use the ""Full Defrag"" option again. 

"
,ChrisPDX,2012-04-13T19:44Z,Ooops!  I failed to mention that I believe I was still using 1.7.1 on Lion.
