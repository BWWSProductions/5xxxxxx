Introduction:
------------

Welcome to the Windows MTS2000 Customer Programming Software (CPS) 
by Motorola.  The notes below serve to introduce you to the software
you are about to install.  Please read these notes in their entirety
 before installing and using the MTS2000 CPS R02.00.01 Release.

New Radio Features Supported:
--------------------------------

- Support for 800 MHz Rebanding


CPS Enhancements in this Release:
---------------------------------
- The Clone Wizard feature is now supported by the CPS.  This feature
  groups all fields needed to be updated when cloning to one or many 
  radios, or to one or many archive codeplug files.

- The Clone Express is now supported by the CPS.  This feature significantly
  reduces the time required to clone a radio when you want to preserve
  the ID's within the radio.  This feature provides the Clone Wizard
  functionality, including "Read Radio ID's" with one mouse click. Please
  refer to the help for further information.

- The Advanced System Key feature is now supported.  This feature can
  be used to produce system keys that have limited functionality and/or
  have an expiration date.
  This feature also supports obsolescing the older keys if desired, by
  providing an option to only honor the new keys for radio programming.
  Multiple keys can be attached in the CPS provided that all system IDs
  are unique.

- Drag and drop between MTS2000, and the ASTRO and ASTRO 25 products is
  now supported by the CPS.

- Top Node Drag and Drop for copying complete codeplug data from one radio 
  to another, including MTS2000 to ASTRO and/or ASTRO 25 products and vice
  versa.

- Auto Display of the Drag & Drop Report is now supported by the CPS.

- Across-band Drag and Drop for copying non-frequency-related information 
  from 800 radios to UHF and VHF radios and vice versa is now supported
  by the CPS.

- Drag and Drop Personality to Zone feature allows you to drag a Conventional 
  Personality or a Trunking Personality and drop it on top of any Zone 
  Channel Assignment zone for easily addition of channels to existing zones.

- The tables now support Fill Up/Down for copying the same value across
  multiple rows. To change the value for a field on all records, switch
  to the alternate table view, change the value in the first record and
  select 'Fill Down' to copy the value to all records.

- Saving Invalid Archives allows you to save a codeplug that has unresolved
  invalid fields to a file with the extension ".inv," which can be read
  back into the CPS at a later time to resolve the invalid fields and
  complete codeplug setup. Invalid (.inv) files cannot be written to a
  radio; they must be read into the CPS and all invalidities must be
  resolved prior to programming. Certain fields cannot be saved when
  invalid, and the CPS will not allow you to save a .inv file until these
  fields have been resolved. Fields that cannot be saved when invalid will
  be denoted by a red dot next to the field name in the Invalid Fields
  dialog. Please see the Known Issues section below for information on
  unresolved issues with this feature.

Please refer to the CPS Online Help for more information on these features.

Known Issues With the MTS2000 CPS R02.00.01 Release:
---------------------------------------------------

1)  Drop down items in table fields cannot be accessed when using Windows XP
    Professional "Windows XP Style" display.  If this issue is encountered,
    change the display setting to "Windows Classic Style" for proper
    functionality.

2)  Attempting to Read from or Write to a radio with the CPS while the Tuner
    is open will cause a communication failure.

3)  Due to French import laws, the Microsoft encryption support used to
    create archive (.cpg) files with the CPS (Customer Programming Software)
    is not available on the French version of the Windows Operating Systems.
    Therefore, there is no way to save archive files when the CPS is
    installed on the French version of Windows. Until import laws are
    changed such that Microsoft can provide encryption support, this feature
    can not be addressed.

4)  If you attempt to close a dialog box by pressing the 'X' in the upper 
    right of the dialog while the application is still busy (the cursor 
    is shaped like an hourglass), the application may terminate.

5)  Reading two radios simultaneously results in an error message.  
    Computers equipped with two Communication Ports can potentially read
    two radios at a time.  This is not recommended at present, as error 
    messages have been observed during simultaneous reading of radios on 
    different COM ports.

6)  The CPS will display the error message "Unable to write header" if you 
    try to save a codeplug file that has been marked as read-only.  To 
    circumvent this problem, either save the codeplug under a different name
    or remove the read-only setting from the codeplug file.

7)  The CPS does not warn users when they have opened a codeplug in more 
    than one application.  Information saved in one application will be 
    overwritten by subsequent saves of the same codeplug in the second 
    CPS application.

8) In the unlikely event that a FLASHport operation fails, disconnect and 
    power off the SRIB and radio, and reconnect them again.  Retry the 
    FLASHport operation.


Installation:
------------

1)  Before installing the MTS2000 CPS, you must uninstall any previously
    installed versions of the MTS2000 CPS, and reboot your machine.  You
    can uninstall the CPS by going to the Windows Control Panel,
    double-clicking on Add/Remove Programs, selecting the CPS in the list of
    installed programs, and clicking the Add/Remove button. If you insert the
    installation CD for the new CPS before uninstalling the old CPS, you will
    be presented with a screen containing three buttons: Remove, Modify, and
    Repair. You must select Remove to uninstall the old CPS, then reboot your
    machine, then install the new CPS.

2)  When you insert the Installation CD into the CD-ROM drive, the 
    installation will start automatically. You may select to install the CPS
    or the Tuner or both applications. Follow the on-screen instructions to 
    install the software.

3)  Before uninstalling the CPS, disable the CPS Password if you have 
    enabled this feature.

4)  If a file installed by the CPS later becomes corrupted, the Repair
    option on the Installation CD may be used to restore it. It is very
    important that the Installation CD for the same version that is
    installed on the computer is used for Repair. Use of a different
    version in an attempt to Repair an installation will result in further
    corruption.

5)  Windows NT Installation: If the Install does not find the shlwapi.dll in
    *WINNTSystem32 directory, you will need to install Internet
    Explorer 4.1 or above to facilitate the XML installation, which is 
    required for the FLASHport feature of the CPS.


Programming Hints:
------------------
1)  You can use your DOS archive files in the MTS2000 CPS without the need 
    for any conversion process. There is no CPS Archive Converter; you simply 
    read your DOS archives directly into the CPS. To open a DOS codeplug in
    the MTS2000 CPS, select File->Open from the Menu, and change the setting
    in the "Files of type" drop-down to "All Files (*.*)".  You will then be
    able to select any DOS archive and click the "Open" button. When you are
    ready to save the archive, select File->Save As from the Menu, and save
    your archive as a .cpg (Windows archive) file.  The DOS RSS cannot read 
    archive files saved with this or later versions of Windows CPS.

2)  If your DOS archive ends in an extension that Windows recognizes as a
    particular file type (*.xls, which Windows recognizes as an Excel file, 
    for example), you may need to enter the .cpg extension in the Save As 
    dialog.

3)  The first time you start the CPS, you should go to the User Settings
    Dialog under the Tools menu and set up the directories where you will 
    store your system keys.

4)  Several user-configurable view items are available under the 
    View->Options Menu. You can set a color for invalid fields, so that
    these fields are more visible.  You can also configure whether or not
    you wish to confirm deletion of records with a popup window.  PLEASE 
    NOTE that the default for Confirm on Deletion is NO. If you wish to 
    see a popup menu every time you delete a record, please change this
    setting.

5)  To get help on a field, press F1 or 'right click' and select 'What's 
    this?' while you are on the field, or click on the Help button on the
    tool bar (an arrow with a question mark) and then click on the field 
    for which you want to view help.

6)  For more information on the features available in the Windows CPS, we
    suggest you view our audio-visual help tutorials. They can be accessed 
    from the CPS menu by selecting Help->CPS Help Topics, and then 
    double-clicking on CPS Tutorials, then The Tutorials Menu. Then select
    the tutorial you wish to view.


Scope:
-----

The MTS2000 CPS R02.00.01 replaces the DOS RSS in all respects except in the 
following.

   *  The CPS does not support Service Mode Tuning (F2 from the Main Menu in 
      the DOS RSS). Service Mode Tuning functionality is provided in the Tuner
      application on this CD.
   *  The CPS does not support reading or importing the TCMS file format.

For the above two functions, please continue to use the DOS RSS.
