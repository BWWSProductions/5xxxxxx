Synopsis
With her cheerful nature, inquiring mind, and colourful fashion sense, Nickelodeon's adorable bilingual heroine Dora the Explorer has charmed preschool children and their parents alike. Designed to simulate a computer game, the animated series follows the cute little Latina, her monkey pal Boots, and their anthropomorphic cohorts Map and Backpack as they set out on problem-solving adventures that encourage interaction and physical activity while teaching simple concepts such as counting, logic skills, and basic Spanish. This volume presents a double-length adventure that finds Dora globetrotting to France, Tanzania, Russia, and China for fun-filled lessons in geography and culture.
