,rustedhalo,2010-01-23T07:25Z,"wow, TvTeam has been on top of it lately. surprised to see no eztv torrent of this. also thanks for my WWE and TNA fix...cheers"
,tfizz,2010-01-23T07:41Z,why is this 700 MB?  is it a 2 hour long pilot???  most 1 hour = 350 mb
,willdenow,2010-01-23T08:02Z,"I think this is the is the pilot that aired in the summer of 2009, at least from the description given by the uploader.  As far as I can tell, last night's episode hasn't been posted yet.  Perhaps one of the seeders can conirm/deny."
,JTarg,2010-01-23T09:38Z,@kingoflight: It's impossible to tell as these are in a .rar format. It would be better to wait for an unrared release.

Bullshit. This is the same movie that aired last year. Maybe they're re-airing it so folks can start the series from the beginning, but the statement above is incorrect and this episode is old-news."

,tiger2000,2010-01-23T12:38Z,"According to the Sy Fy website it is an Extended Version of the one released on DVD last year, I assume it means thet they cut out some on the nudity and sex from the DVD version not suitable for broadcast on Sy Fy and have inserted other scenes to replace them."
,honeybunny28,2010-01-23T15:04Z,"It's 98% the same. I synced the sub and at a quick look, only some lines that existed in the previous version were removed or re-written. But only a maximum of 5-6."
