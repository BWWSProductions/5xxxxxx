,timbard,2012-03-11T20:31Z," If you are having issues with the serial number do this

Open a CMD Prompt as an Admin (right click on CMD in the start menu and select ""run as administrator""

Then paste this into the box  

netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Block Kalypso Grand Ages Rome"" dir=out profile=any remoteip=94.75.242.20 remoteport=40009 protocol=TCP action=block
