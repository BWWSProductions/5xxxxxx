The most sonically adventurous of Creedence albums, the "surprisingly durable" (Robert Christgau) Pendulum is noted for its widespread use of horns and keyboards in contrast to the group's previous albums which were dominated by guitar. A female backing chorus even appears on one track. Among several lesser-known Fogerty songs ("Pagan Baby," "Sailor's Lament," "It's Just a Thought") were two top-ten hits, "Hey Tonight" and "Have You Ever Seen the Rain?". Both songs reached number eight in 1971. It also contains their only avant-garde venture "Rude Awakening #2".
