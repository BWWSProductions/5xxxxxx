NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

And here is our V2 of Eli......This time round we've used ELEKTRI4KA source files (thanks) and we used Mentions audio as it saved us some time syncing

The audio file has been cleaned up some and had the EQ tweak before we remixed it.

We also tweaked the video like we normally do and we also used the Quad crop filter which allows us to crop at angles so we could crop it without losing any of the picture.

Now yes it looks colourless and grey.....but we tweaked the colours the best we could do to the trailor and even that looked almost black and white in most scenes.

credit IMAGiNE & ghostman BIG TIME & to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone
