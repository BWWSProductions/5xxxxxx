,renegade62468,2010-01-25T23:37Z,"hey man, good torrents. i was wondering what programs you use to edit movies and such, if you could help me that would be great if not thanks anyway"
[T],jerry7_57,2010-01-26T03:42Z,Still pretty dark in places but the movie is a little on the dark side anyway. The audio is ok.
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-01-27T10:15Z,"The Book Of Eli TS V2 is the best copy out. However the audio does drop for only a couple seconds in the movie and some parts the audio crackles. The video is very decent though. I'm only letting everyone know the quality. I myself have no problems with it because I've seen crap cams before. Thanks for the up.

Audio: 7
Video: 7
Movie: 8"
,clyde4210,2010-02-03T14:13Z,Ripper you're out your rabbit ass mind. This is a cam and all cam are garbage. They never can have a rating above 4 and 4 is being nice to cam copies.
,nattyrat,2010-02-11T06:17Z,"nice cam, video and sound decent enough to enjoy.  thanks."
,BrotherT2010,2010-02-12T17:57Z,"WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BE CAREFUL WITH THIS TORRENT GUYS. RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM COX TODAY. WARNER BROS. IS TRACKING THIS TORRENT."
,The Hawk,2010-02-18T03:47Z,"They track all the torrents.  WHO CARES!  An IP address is NOT a person!  I toss those letters directly into the garbage where they belong!  They are automated anyway.  

If you are that damn paranoid, download and install Peer Guardian: http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/"
,jessreyn,2010-02-22T20:50Z,"will this movie play ok on 42"" widescreen?"
