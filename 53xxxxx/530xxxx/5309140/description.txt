INTIMIDAD: A HOME MOVIE - an original Mexican love story about
family relationships and the meaning of "home." Cecy and Camilo
ages 21 recently moved to the border, Reynosa, Mexico, from
Santa Maria, Puebla with a dream to save money, buy land, and
build a home. A year later they return to their rural hometown
to reunite with their two year-old daughter Loida. What seems
like a satisfying reunion turns into a confusing dilemma that
transforms the course of their marriage. Both the family in
the film - and the directors - documented INTIMIDAD over the
course of 5 years, lending the story to an incredibly intimate,
dream-like impression. INTIMIDAD mixes digital verite with
Super 8 and 16mm film stock.
