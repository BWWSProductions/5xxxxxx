,snuffyluv,2010-03-03T14:57Z,why is it that you guys think you can get away with saying something is a dvd rip when it is not? this movie just came out on dvd and blue ray yesterday and this so called copy was downloaded onthe 23rd of january? mmmmmmmm something is rotten in china if ya ask me........JMO
,r3tr0,2010-03-04T13:08Z,"Snuffy, do you think that the DVDs are all made the night before the movie is released?  I used to rent at a small independent video shop and we were friends with the owners.  I used to rent 8 days before they were released.  The stuff is out there if you A) know where to find it B) have the patience to look for it C) aren't afraid of getting caught."
,r3tr0,2010-03-04T13:09Z,"Oh and Emery, once again I salute you.  Keep it rocking man."
,snuffyluv,2010-03-04T18:37Z,well in my personal collection i have over 2500 movies and i know where to find them and i am not afraid of getting caught for anything. most of my movies are store bought. i just recently started using pirate bay because the prices in the stores are crazy!
,snuffyluv,2010-03-04T18:39Z,and if knew how to upload them to TPB i would!!!  i am not one of the idiots on here that trashed my last pc. i know my shit is VIRUS FREE!!!

,FailedSuicideAttempt-,2010-04-29T10:48Z,"TY Emery.  
@Snuffyluv all you had to say was Ok, that you didn't understand how or why but now you do... 
We're all at different points along the pirate curve.  Me I'm so broke i can either have internet or rent movies...but not both.  Welcome to the party though.  BTW there are some people out their posting movie theater recordings that they call DVD now that is either g.d. funny or messed up depending on the point of view.  Sometimes they even have 1000s and 1000s of seeders many who will say that the A and V are 9s or 10s ROFL i mean thats funky even in China."
