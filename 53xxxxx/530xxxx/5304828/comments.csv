,tommyVercetti,2010-01-27T08:15Z,"Ok, got a question...

I can't seem to get these files to work on a ps3 anymore. The file sizes for all newer PS3-TEAM torrents seem to be 4.26gb. This means that sometimes I can't get them on a fat32 drive, and all attempts at streaming them to ps3, either to copy or play, fail.

Anyone got any ideas? I'm downloading and streaming with a black Macbook OS 10.6.2, running Elgato EyeConnect or Medialink (tried both). I can *sometimes* copy the files to a 500gb MyBook, or iPod, but the files will not show up when I plug the HDD or iPod into the PS3 (and yes, I hit triangle and ""display all""). I also rename the file extensions as .mp4, otherwise the PS3 completely fails to recognize them.

Any help, please?"
[T],bricktophd,2010-01-27T19:37Z,tommy i dont know why they are coming out 4.26 gigs none of my movies are over 4 gigs you might try to transfer the movie via flash drive or burn as a data disk and then transfer.
