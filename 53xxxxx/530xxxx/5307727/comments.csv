All these Apps work fine with my jb 3gs 3.1.3.

Thank you very much for these fresh apps !"

it's nothing to do with the hackulo source... I would restore your iDevice to 3.1.2 NOT 3.1.3!!!
jailbreak with http://blackra1n.com and ONLY Download Cydia and Sn0w (Optional) NOT Rock!!!
then you should be fine, like me!

hope that helps,
