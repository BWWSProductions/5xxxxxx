Albert Fish, the horrific true story of elderly cannibal, sadomasochist,
and serial killer, who lured children to their deaths in Depression-era
New York City. Distorting biblical tales, Albert Fish takes the themes
of pain, torture, atonement and suffering literally as he preys on
victims to torture and sacrifice. Includes interviews with artist and
Odditorium owner, Joe Coleman, and true-crime author, Katherine
Ramsland, Ph.D.
