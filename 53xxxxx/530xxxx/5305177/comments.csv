There are a few torrents like this out there, they are collecting our information which with torrents is extremely easy. 
Everyone speak out against copyright and patent laws, seriously cancer could have been cured by now if companies hadnt patented chemical structures (preventing others using them).
Copyright is just as bad, why should we have to pay for ideas?
Although in this example (a movie) there is no way to justify getting it for free, cept that the producers are already rich as.

1) do not spam comments with your bullshit. We don't care if you run a site full of trojans and malware with the promise of ~streaming the video online~ your site is not better and is full of adware and viruses. gtfo and quit commenting every goddamn top 100 torrent with your advertisements. 

2) Stop spamming with the OMFG DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS THE PARTYVAN IS WATCHIN U bullshit. Columbia/Paramount/Tristar/FBI does not give a shit. You won't get fucking V& for downloading a torrent. The worst that will happen is you'll get a cease and desist notice or they'll block you at your IP and you can just switch providers. STFU and GTFO. Why are you even here, you noobs.

3) Don't expect to get any A/V quality better than a TS or a CAM if the film's still in theaters. Jesus, are you people retarded? either wait for it to come out on video for a better rip or stfu until you can contribute something better.

4) the main purpose of comments on these sites is to warn other users whether a torrent is legit. If it's spam, if the sound or video quality is so bad it's unwatchable, or if it's got malware.

,dlarrym,2010-02-10T22:03Z,"To secret_myth: No doubt many of your uploads are very good. Having said that, I would wait for a Rip or Screener to show up.  This is just my thoughts on this subject. I guess am trying to say, WHY??? use a TELESYNC/""CAMERA in a theater"" copy and use a high quality H264 format to encode it ??. So many people out here downloading do not understand that a TS or TELESYNC version is still a CAM, the TELESYNC part is that who ever made the TS copy had access to the projector room and were able to DUB the films ACTUAL AUDIO onto there CAM produced VIDEO. I don't see the point to take a film that is made this way and then encode it with the BEST format available. It would be like buying a 1984 HONDA civic and then putting the most HIGH PERFORMANCE Rims & Tires onto it. The 1984 Civic is not able to take advantage of the HIGH Performance Rims and Tires so it would still never corner better or go faster then a 1984 Honda Civic no matter what Rims or Wheels it has... Right??? so No matter what container you put a CAM in, it will never be better then a CAM. SO... following this logic, Why put a CAM made film, even if the AUDIO is perfect into a H264 format?? If ANY change happens, it will be that the H264's superior imaging qualities will only expose the flaws in the CAM and make the Video seem worse.  Flaws will stand out even more then they would have if you posted it ""as is""... ALSO you KNOW a RIP is going to surface at some point, they always do...  So, save your efforts and your clearly excellent encoding skills for that RIP or SCREENER when It does emerget. You are going to do this anyway.... ""This"" being that you KNOW you will post a H264 version of a screener or true DVDrip when you get possession of it.... So knowing your going to do this, why waste your time with an inferior quality movie file if you are only going to make a truly  excellent copy once you get your hands on a true RIP. Just an observation... You have great skills, I am not questioning this fact, I just question the time spent on a flaw filled original, when a Rip or screener is almost certain to show up, then with these better original copies, work your magic!!! ALSO..... CHROMA vs2009.1 is a execellent PLAYER by mirailabs and is far superior for PLAYBACK then even VLC or KMplayer.  It is written just for the MAC OS. TO NOTE(1):  Mac's OS versions 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6 have been made for the PC. This is due in a large part to the fact that a few years ago, APPLE began using INTEL processors in its POWER MACS and pretty much all its newer computers from the Mac Mini onward. Some early generation Mac Mini's used PPC chips by motorola NOTE(2): There is another APP called CHROMA that is an ""ADOBE PHOTOSHOP-like"" program for WINDOWS. This is NOT the APP I am referring to when I speak of CHROMA. "
,dlarrym,2010-02-10T22:19Z,"To: trntz_man... I TOTALLY disagree with your comments on AVI being some old ass process and its now MKV or H264 (which is really an MP4 format). 1st off AVI isn't a ""format"" it is a container in which several formats can be placed in. MKV files are also containers... just like a box or giant envelope. MKV is a container used on the XBOX.  I have some XviD and DivX movies that were packaged as AVI and I bet you anything if I played these on a screen and then the identical film in the H264 or MKV files on another screen, I bet you would never know the difference. You can even put a MP4's (same thing as h264) into an AVI container!!!! PLEASE don't speak of what you do not understand, it makes you look like a total fool or idot."

In the menu, you can watch interviews with the director or even play the entire movie with comments being made as the movie goes in real t ime by the writers and cerain cast, etc, etc,etc,,,,,,,.... SO HOW is some HACK movie made from a CAMERA that some dude sneaked into a theater some where on planet earth.... HOW I say is this movie made  on a camera sneaked (if sneaked is even a real word????) anyway we all kbnow what I mean... SO   This movie ends pre maturely, people walk in front of the camera guy.... the sound cuts in and out..... it has ZERO extras...... IT in fact NOT!!!!! .....the same product that is stamped with the copyright symbol by its name. It is NOT the same product in quality or in content.... it  is really a joke to even call it a ""COPY"".... LMFAO!!!!!!    OH my god..... The record companies in the 70's and 80's owned chains of music stores like RECORD BAR and SAM GOODY and MUSIC LAND.... CD SUPERSTORE.... etc, etc.... they sold BLANK cassette tapes and DIGITAL tapes.... at the counter where you paid for purchased CD's... Did these owners  of these music labels and music stores believe that people wouldn't make copies of these CDs they sold.... They even SOLD THE BLANK TAPE.... Digital tape makes an exact copy of a CD...  it transfers the digital encoding, not actual analog music like a microphone catches... so even back before CD recorders and DVD burners, it was possible to copy CDs perfectly if you spent the money and time to do it.... I don't recall ANYONE EVER getting suied for 250,000.00 per track like that poor bastard in Raleigh NC in the USA did back in like 89.   Things are f&^ked up....

Good movie, audio gets crackly during louder sequences and cuts out once in a while but the clarity is not bad. Video is actually really good i think (compared to theater rips and cams). Could see what was going on the whole time.

TO FIX AUDIO SYNC ISSUE: Use VLC player and when the audio is noticeably bad (around 1:25 in), manually re-sync it by pressing ""J"" until the audio delay is at -400ms. Then, smooth sailings.

,GetTheMusic,2010-04-01T03:01Z,"This is a CAM recording!!!

Audio goes out in this a lot, and the speakers in the theater were so loud, you get static clicking sounds in this a lot. The credits at the end are cut off, and the video quality is very poor (BECAUSE IT IS A CAM RECORDING)

Thanks for the up load. It saved me a $1.75 that the church will not get from me.

My favorite film by Denzel Washington was ""Fallen"", and this movie ""Book Of Eli"" was a disappointment. Perhaps if he just burned the damn bible or if the other guy wanted to burn it, then it might have been a better movie. A movie like this should have pointed out all of the contradictions in the bible and how it's all B.S. for crazies and hypocrites to follow for their lack of being able to think for themselves.

In a way, it did have a hidden message in the film. Like when he mentioned it was the last bible because everyone killed each other over it. Then what does he do, he kills everyone to keep it, and the people that want it only want it because they can't have it so they all kill for it without knowing why. The whole time I kept waiting to hear someone say ""thou shall not kill"", but it never happened, ha ha ha ha.

This movie is a really good example of how the blind truly leads the blind. Anyway, it has a very unhappy ending. The Bible lives.

I want someone to make a movie about a perfect community in the future where everything is fine and then a person with a bible comes along and ruins it. It could be a family movie to teach kids about the dangers of people that read bibles and associate with religions. Not just bashing one religion, but all religions and from an intellectual perspective that cannot be argued with."

,cclloyd,2010-04-05T17:16Z,"How are more ppl downloading this than Avatar, which was 1.  Way better than this film, and  2.  more popular than this movie?"
,lyther01,2010-04-13T00:43Z,when is the DVD comming out for this?
,KNIGHTWATCH903,2010-04-13T08:32Z,"DVD Will be out on June 15, 2010"
,jelmertjuhh,2010-04-16T07:46Z,"Very good Quality, audio is less but okay :)
But why is it all black and white? Is that just a part of the film ore not?"
,patisallano,2010-04-23T12:09Z,Religious propaganda. Lame and predictable.
,patisallano,2010-04-23T12:11Z,This movie is best burned... With gasoline!
,pheonixrisen,2010-04-25T03:11Z,"First I want to say that this was a great quality dl as they always are from SM.  

More importantly, what happened to you Secret?  No new downloads since the end of Feb.  Please come back, you always have the newest and best quality.  Definitely miss your contributions to the site."
,bastrdx,2010-04-25T12:47Z,yes gr8 torrents but everyone is allowed a break lol :)
,Dfewer,2010-05-02T15:08Z,"Dang I liked this movie.  Felt like a live action Fallout 3.  Also realized I had missed a ABSOLUTELY HUGE thing about the main character even after watching the whole thing through.  I think movies like Avatar have desensitized me to the subtly filmmaking can achieve.  When you watch this, really analyze what is going on and see if you catch what I completely missed."
,USMC4LIFE,2010-05-03T07:54Z,"Hey, patisallano, no one gives a fuck what you think, so piss off.

Thank you, secret_myth."
,cpt_acid,2010-05-06T06:15Z,"People have rated this anything from 3 to 9 in both audio and video quality. They have literally call this the best TS ever and the worst shit ever recorded...

Well, at least I know it doesn't deserve a 2/10 mark.

I know standards differ but c'mon... this is senseless! "
,Questionmarq34,2010-05-06T23:56Z,"The picture is way too dark for me. I'll have to wait for a DVDrip. Thanks anyway, Secret_Myth."
,katiegreek,2010-05-13T23:09Z,It is very good quality
,Pirate786,2010-05-19T00:41Z,"AV?????????????

,nittany,2010-05-25T05:18Z,"Why are there so many seeders and leechers when a DVD rip of this movie has been out for awhile now?  Screw telesyncs people, get the DVD or bluray rip!"
,theRealKarmine,2010-06-08T14:53Z,seriously.
,theRealKarmine,2010-06-08T14:54Z,seriously. not to mention some ifiot who encodes the audio in AAC.
,as14ever,2010-07-03T19:33Z,"Movie request to any one that can do it. I have a request for some very hard movies to find as mpeg4 BRRip H264 AAC3 in resolutions: 1280x544 or 1280x720 or even 1920x1080p

The Movies are: Appleseed 2004 
Tron 1982
Brazil 1985
Naked Lunch 1991
Conan the Barbarian 1982
Conan the Destroyer 1984
The Dark Crystal 1982
King Kong 1976
The Secret of NIMH 1982
Spike Lee School Daze 1988
Spike Lee Mo Better Blues 1990

If any one can find these movies in the format mentioned above, or can create them in the same quality as secret_myth I would be very appreciative and can maybe work on some type of compensation if needed.

Let me know at firstliight@yahoo.com "
,jwynne,2010-08-26T02:07Z,secret myth has a lot of good movies (great uploader :))  but i was really disapointed in the quality of this one (i guess because it is telesync) and to the peeps who rated this A:9 V:9 what kind of standards do you have?  id give it about A:3 V:3   but love your work myth wish youd come back with more ;) thanx for the great movies
,Early_Riser,2010-09-19T13:02Z,"Still watching it. Personaly I am enjoying it, great video quality, but the audio is clipped during loud scenes. Thank you secret_myth for the upload."
,skyfire67,2011-03-24T11:43Z,"Hi secret_myth,
 I think you do a great job!
Do you happen to have the witchcraft movies
1-5 ? Could you please place it on your list to upload? I can't find them any where.
Thank you:

just download a dvdrip... this is not a dvd or blu ray... its recorded with a camera..."
,j0nnyboy,2012-02-12T11:20Z,"This is a TS people. As soon as torrent was complete, initially, I was shocked that such a piece of shit rip came from secret_myth. After coming back to this page i realized that it was not a BD rip like alot of secret_myths other stuff. Uploader clearly states up top that it's a TELESYNC. Secret_Myth Bluray rips are absolutely top notch, but don't expect that with this TS."
