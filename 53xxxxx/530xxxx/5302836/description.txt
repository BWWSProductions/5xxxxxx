This torrent contains the recording of the set Pendulum performed at London's Matter nightclub on 23rd January 2010 as part of the Album Preview DJ Tour for their upcoming Album due out in May 2010, titled Immersion, includes several new songs. This is a good quality 320 kbps MP3, but as it was recorded directly from a video stream, sound quality in places can be poorer, but on the whole the quality is good.
