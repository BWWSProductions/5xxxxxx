,ericcarr,2010-01-24T11:25Z,"Does anyone have a collection of all the KISS music videos? I mean the music promo vids from the 70s till the most recent?

There was a bootleg DVD around at one time that was excellent, but I can't find anywhere."
,kvestantin,2010-01-24T12:27Z,"2nafish, thanks! Will check is this file better quality than I had ))

ericcarr,
check here - I made 3 DVDs myself with only videos of Kiss ))

,kvestantin,2010-01-24T13:31Z,"2nafish! I have checked the quality... Can you tell, don't you have these 3 videos (also ""Reason To Live"" and ""Turn On The Night"") even better quality?

It seems like you have ripped these videos from better source, and your rips are just rips.

That's why the quality here is good but not very much ahead of quality in versions I had from VHSrips.

I'm looking for these videos in full DVD quality (pic 6000-8000 Kbps instead of your 3000-4000 Kbps) - that's for my Monster Videography of Kiss..."

,ericcarr,2010-01-25T05:52Z,Found a collection from 74 - 1992 on Demonoid lastnight. 
,Sten1972,2010-01-25T15:25Z,"Thanks for this upgrade!
There's a new upgraded KISS collection on Demonoid now.
;)"
[V],2nafish,2010-01-27T09:47Z,"for kvestantin: I don't have those videos right now at 8000kbps although I could redo them at 8000kbps. I made a 4000kbps and an 8000kbps of ""Unholy"" and compared them and I couldn't tell any difference in picture quality. If I did these 3 videos over again I don't know if that would make any difference. "
,kvestantin,2010-01-27T19:45Z,"2nafish! Thanks for answering!
You said you can redo these clips... Can you just tell please - redo from what source? This is what I would like to know, if possible. What was the source from which you can make 8000 kbps or 3000-4000 kbps?
Speaking honestly I am looking not for the bitrate fugures of course. But for the picture of MAXIMUM quality. And the maximum quality is always in the original source, before all the transitions and ripping this source to new files or formats. Maybe I could try to find these source files also, if you tell where they come from."
