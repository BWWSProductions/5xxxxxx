[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-24T02:23Z,computerguru92? look in read me [GR420]
,computerguru92,2010-01-24T03:06Z,"its downloading so slowly and it isnt my computer can somebody please seed this thing so i can finish downloading it, its been an hour and 37 minutes "
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-24T03:14Z,its ur computer im seeding @ 100+ steady
,computerguru92,2010-01-24T04:02Z,there is no way i have 2 quad core processors and an over killed front side bus
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-24T04:09Z,"and that means exactly what?
im not doubting u have that, but if ur BT Client (uTorrent,Bittorent,Azureus)and firewall ports isn't configured properly, you got slow speeds- period."
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-24T04:14Z,funny how ur the only person with this issue on my torrent does that tell you anything?
,donixa3,2010-01-24T04:27Z,"Just to make sure:
1. Is this REALLY include Business Contact Manager for Outlook 2007?
2. What is the windows update info? Any Service Pack?
3. Is it in great condition? I have downloaded several torrents but it has error and flaws. It will work just like original office ulltimate right?
3. (Personal question) Can I download their service pack alone and simply install them?

Thank you,"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-01-24T04:51Z,"@donixa3 - i have this on my system, therefore, it means it's good:)
Other torrents may have imperfections, mine doesn't as I make sure everything is in place b4 I post, I take quality very seriously.
As for updates, u don't have to look 4 them, they'll come to u, and there's a lot of them, so be patient bro:)
Enjoy:)

,donixa3,2010-01-24T05:02Z,"If you say so, is it mean business contact manager for outlook 2007 also included?

what i meant 2 say is everyone who uploads torrents does it differently, in a way that most piratebay users will understand, and some make errors too but we are all human after all.

,hannibal0,2010-01-28T18:26Z,"FOR COMPUTER GURU.... what you should have done is to change your updater setting so you choose to download and install, and when you get an update that says something like MICROSOFT GENUINE ADVANTAGE... 
dont install just right click the update and select hide update. sorted.

you will now have to find some sort of fix or crack as as to remove it from your pc without a re install may just prove a little difficult for you to do, and dont take offence by that.

I love all your torrents as they are always 100% malware and adware free and always 100% working. If I had a say so you would be a mod. Keep up the 5 star work my friend as nowadays I primarly trust your torrents before anyone elses and that is the hardcore truth.

Thanks for the upload and assistance."
[T],grimreaper420,2010-02-10T23:47Z,"@defenestrator44

if you burn the contents of a CD or DVD image too fast, bits of data will not burn properly, resulting in a corrupted image, therefore, an unsuccessful install of my torrent.

As for an incomplete download, you try mounting it, it will be corrupted.

Note: (Trial) .ISO software will not permit you to mount or burn ...anything of size exceeding 700MB or more or even less.

Good luck:)"

The launcher, when run, someone made their own program to help assist the automatic insertion of the serial number before running the actual installation, when a program that is supposed to be legitimate, has a modification to it to automatically insert a value inside the structure of another program, it can be considered viral, it is a FALSE POSITIVE.

Can anyone give precise area that it would be in?  And, what happens tomorrow to my Office programs?  Will I not be able to access them anymore?

,Laughing69,2010-03-20T19:25Z,"I see that I'm having the same problem as others on this board.  I had the student trial, which allows 25 uses of Microsoft products, installed on the computer before I bought it.  No choice in the matter.  Ok, so I install this torrent (Office Ultimate) on my computer, but it still tells me I have only 25, then 24, then 23, etc. uses of the product.  How do I eliminate this?"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-03-20T20:09Z,"completely eliminate the student trial first, reboot, install Ultimate good luck:) "
,Laughing69,2010-03-20T20:18Z,"I went to the programs area in the control panel and unistalled.  I rebooted.  I knew this would be classic procedure, as is with other programs.  I then inserted the disk of this torrent (iso) into the hard drive.  It says it installed, but I still keep getting the warning of 23 uses, 22 uses, 21, uses, and less each time I try closing, rebooting, etc.  Is there a registry key I need to tamper with?  I know a pervious version of Office Ultimate had sumthin where I had to move ""office12"" or copy it to a certain directory or sumthin like that.  That was on a different computer or I wouldn't need Office Ultimate again.  :)"
[T],grimreaper420,2010-03-20T20:42Z,"this torrent does not need to be tampered with or altered in any way its already activated, obviously if your still getting those mgs, look over your add and remove programs and make sure there is not one trace of ANY previous Office product(s), and clear/delete old registry, reboot...or if it still does it ...completely reformat (as a last resort of course) "
,Laughing69,2010-03-20T23:42Z,"I've removed EVERY trace of ANY Microsoft program (Word, Excel, Power Point, etc.) that I can find.  I've used the search tool as well.  There must be something in the new computers'regirty or Windows 7 that tells a computer when it has a real version or when it has a trial use version.  I think that's why they ALL come with the trial version of Microsoft now... they embed some registry item somehwere.  Reformatting won't do it cuz that's how the computer comes... right from the store they have the stupid 60 day trial inserted.  No ""rescue disk"" will put the computer in a condition that makes it think it NEVER had Office on it.  Thanks anyways.  I've spent the afternoon trying everything I can think of.  They embedded sumthin in a really good hiding spot."
,Laughing69,2010-03-20T23:44Z,"And as a side note, it won't even let me open the old copy of Office Ultimate that I have.  That's sumthin new for Windows 7.  I hate this fuckin computer and I've only had it 2 days.  Microsoft sucks."

these are my final options for you take it as u want to, find a pre-activated copy of Win 7 on this site, reformat your computer, then install my torrent, it will work guaranteed, but since you hate Microsoft and your computer, I guess you're out of luck.

I'll keep may name as it is, but thanks anyway.  :)  Computers DO frustrate me when they don't operate as they should.  This one is doing MANY things it shouldn't and I've only had it 5 days.  There are other programs that it won't allow to install, either, so I don't doubt the quality of your torrent.  I doubt the integrity of my ""new"" computer.  I believe you when you say this should install and work, but Microsoft seems to have sumthin embedded in their new software.  This is a Canadian computer that came with pre-installed programs on it.  (I wanted to do a clean install, but apparently they don't have that option anymore.)

I believe you and the ton of others that have this torrent working fine.  I think there will be more people like me, though.  I checked my update list and there's none that are ""Genuine Advantage""or the KB949 one you listed.  I guess it's just my bad luck.

On a positive note, this computer allowed Office 2010 to install.  And like I said, You've worked hard to get the reputation you have.  I don't doubt the quality of your work, I was just hpoing you'd have some answers for me as to how I could get around the pre-installed ""trial"" version"" that came with the computer.  Removal from ""Programs""in the control panel did nothing."

@Laughing69 ohh man when you buy a new laptop or desktop they stuff all kinds of pre-installed software garbage and it doesn't matter if it's Canadian or American purchased, 
hence the difficulty you are having with my torrent..., just disable whatever anti-virus that's installed (my guess good ol trial based McAfee-the worst AV program), and try again.
If this still persists, honestly, do a FULL format of your laptop, back up whatever you may have, and yes, you can do a clean install!

I previously had MS Office 2003 and I just clicked the 'upgrade' option when I tried installing this - it installed without a hitch. I checked my system for the KB949810 update (didn't have it) and my system automatically started downloading updates for this - when it had finished (and there are A LOT of updates!) I again made sure the KB949810 update wasn't amongst them and let the updates install - so far works fine, but it does seem a bit more sluggish than 2003 (even on a dual-core system) so unless you have a decent new system I'd stick with previous versions of office. I still might revert back - see how it goes."

I totally appreciate comments from people, even more so to point out that uploaders like myself try very hard to make users of TPB satisfied as much as possible with very little disruption.
Take care :)

Now I can't even use this app to go back to 2007.  Does anyone have a clue what the dreaded ""Error 1935"" might be or how to rectify this dilemma?  My thanks in advance."

[T],grimreaper420,2010-10-19T22:54Z,"@doorgunner
The 1935 Error message is generated by the Windows Installer when it is unable to access a specific file, folder, or area of the system's registry for some reason. Normally, this error is generated if the user does not have full administrative rights to the entire computer (including all files, folders, and areas of the Windows Registry). 
In this situation, the 1935 error appears to be related to some recent updates released by Microsoft for the Microsoft XML Parser. One of these updates is partially installed on the computer and the Windows Installer is unable to verify and provide the proper version information to our Installer Package. This failure generates the 1935 error message when our Installer is unable to determine the version of MSXML installed on the computer.

Hope that answers your â€œerror 1935 issue"". "

I used the word help to figure this out, you should try it in the future.

1.Click the Office Button, and then click Word Options.
2.Click Proofing.
3.Check ""Mark grammar errors as you type"" (leave ""Check spelling with grammar"" checked).
4.Click AutoCorrect Options.
5.On the AutoCorrect tab, select the Automatically use suggestions from the spelling checker check box."

,rancidguy,2012-05-28T00:46Z,"There is NOT a virus. This is extremely simple to install. I recommend not using the launcher, just mount the .iso with daemon tool lite, when it shows up in the virtual drive open the folder to view files, open the text file called ""Readme.txt"" so you can copy the product key which is F3DJD-6FFQ4-XQTQF-PGK47-8MDQ8 and then go to the folder ""Office 2007 Enterprise"" and click on the ""setup.exe"" file, paste the serial key in there, then let it do its' thing. Tell it to install updates automatically, because if you are running Win 7 Ultimate x64 [http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6464393/Windows.7.ULTIMATE.SP1.ALL.EDITIONS.32-64.bit-MAFIAA] you will have no problems installing SP2 and the 32 updates that come after that!
