,Krobon,2010-01-26T10:23Z,"So, does this work or is this just the unhacked version?"
,oohhleo,2010-01-26T10:44Z,thanks!!!!
,dANGER_boy,2010-01-26T10:48Z,"As far as I know, this doesn't work.  I tried installing some but it wants to authenticate online.  It'll have to be cracked in order to work properly."
,cos13,2010-01-26T10:48Z,"unable to authorize the dlc
please log into cerberus crap to register"
,oohhleo,2010-01-26T10:53Z,great :(... stupid cerberus network !!!
,Krobon,2010-01-26T10:58Z,Well I can at least use the blood dragon armor cuss I have Dragon age registered :P
,morel42,2010-01-26T11:07Z,"They used the same XML system they used for Dragon age..

 It'll be cracked within the hour.. :)

BTW. STILL BUYING THE DAMN GAME TOMORROW. My god the end.. FUCK.. :)"
,Krobon,2010-01-26T11:17Z,"Same, I DLed Dragon age before buying it as well, gonna buy this game just the same, Bioware certainly makes games worth buying. But to each their own, I like it enough to buy it at least."
,Overlard,2010-01-26T11:19Z,"I'll buy the game, but I will use pirated DLCs like there is no tomorrow. X)"
,diamount,2010-01-26T11:29Z,When will these DLC be fully cracked do you think?
,morel42,2010-01-26T11:49Z,"nope not cracked. I'm currently looking for the flag, it's hidden someplace in one of the ini/xml files :)"
,diamount,2010-01-26T12:09Z,"@morel42

How long will that process take, do you think?"
,dANGER_boy,2010-01-26T12:18Z,"I would be suprised if it is cracked in the next few days.  I have already compared the INI's of good, authorized DLC to those that are not and I haven't been able to find any flags like Dragon Age.  I have checked registry keys but not luck.  It looks like somebody might need to do a hard crack and alter either the game EXE or the DLC files themselves.  We'll see."
,morel42,2010-01-26T12:23Z,"have you looked at the Coalesced.ini file? 

Apparently it takes the default ini file and then cooks a new one ""on the fly"" when you start the game, including what DLC's have been activated.

 Damn thing is an ini file without hitting enter.. so a little hard to eyeball something "
,diamount,2010-01-26T12:40Z,"I wouldn't download these stuff if they were available to buy on the network.

It's rather stupid they don't do that."
,SubGum,2010-01-26T12:53Z,"I look forward to a crack release for these to work.
Thanks to the uploader and those of you working to get it working!"
[T],Knaster,2010-01-26T14:13Z,Im gonna try and crack it the same way as was done with Dragon age.
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T14:15Z,"hmm... it looks like humanity needs a hero... : ) a talented cracker team able to face the ultimate challenges of this dlc, thus restoring peace throughout the galaxy and becoming a living legend... : )"
,byers,2010-01-26T14:37Z,"Any word on the non item DLC? The playable character and missions, being vastly more interesting content than simple items."
[T],Knaster,2010-01-26T14:44Z,crap hit a brick wall here atm :(
[T],Knaster,2010-01-26T14:46Z,Gonna have to get in touch with my russian friend on this :)
,diamount,2010-01-26T14:54Z,"Anyone know what the major brickwall is?

What's so different about this dlc compared to the dragon age one?"
,Isti01,2010-01-26T15:53Z,"thx for uploading this, easier for the crackers to work on it"
,rest_ip,2010-01-26T17:33Z,Here is cure. Looks like legit. http://narod.ru/disk/17292172000/giveme2entitlements.zip.html
,Nemo888_,2010-01-26T17:44Z,That RU crack site is not legit.
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T17:45Z,roger that
,rest_ip,2010-01-26T17:48Z,"If u havent tried it, then do not post crap. It works for me. And its not russian."
,oohhleo,2010-01-26T17:54Z,"thanks for the link rest_ip!!! it works!!!!! hurrrraaayyyyyy!!!!! i got armor, i got guns, i got the oooolddddd normady!!!!!!"
,Isti01,2010-01-26T17:55Z,so did anyone make it through the online authorization or still waiting for a good crack?
,Isti01,2010-01-26T18:01Z,"lol your russian link leads to a 6kb exe file... filename giveme2entitlements... working crack, obviously -.- (Don't download!)"
,rest_ip,2010-01-26T18:06Z,Cuz this is just one script that edits BioPersistentEntitlementCache.ini. U can try to edit it manually if you don`t believe me. I` m plaiyngf allready http://savepic.org/216335.htm
,oohhleo,2010-01-26T18:07Z,"oops, my mistake... doesn't really work :( fucks up the game as well... argh, that's life... live and learn... and never trust anyone with rest_ip(rest in peace) as their username... "
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T18:09Z,"hmm... check out this thread, people: http://boards.4chan.org/v/res/47760605#47760628
they're discussing the same file
also, notice the links at the top, there's a zaeed.exe there also, which is obviously missing from this torrent (and we can probably guess what it's for)"
,rest_ip,2010-01-26T18:12Z,"Yeah, forgot to say. Disable all online functions in the game just in case."
,Wintermist,2010-01-26T18:33Z,"The link from rest_ip actually works. I got all the stuff, and it doesn't ask for activation anymore. I already bought the game but still isn't released here so I'll be damned if I'm not gonna be able to play it. Thanks rest_ip. No virus detected either, using Trendmicro."
,illiria,2010-01-26T19:28Z,"I will say only one thing to those who don;t believe it works:

http://i692.photobucket.com/albums/vv285/Xenon_bioware/Screen.jpg?t=1264530425

Yes, this is my screenshot. Now we REALLY need someone to upload big DLCs (Hammerhead + another recruitable character) FAST before BioWare figures this out and changed protection method. If they haven't already."
,Isti01,2010-01-26T19:43Z,"it's surprising but it really works... sry for accusing you, but it was a bit strange (size of it).
btw does anyone know about the zaeed dlc? does this work for that too?"
,xdarkwolfx,2010-01-26T19:46Z,damn i did everything and still can't get it to work any1 has any ideea what is the problem i mean i don't get any errors but when i open the game after installing the dlc's and using the crack i still get the same message to connect to the cerberus network 
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T19:48Z,"well I'll be damned... : ) looks like the day is saved after all, folks!"
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T20:02Z,"awright, it's been a lond day... for the sake of new arrivals, let's summarize everything we know thus far. : )
instructions in short: after installing the game, INSTEAD OF installing the dlc's as well right away, you need to start the game and set both online options off in the settings menu. once finished, exit, install the dlc's, then download the crack from http://narod.ru/disk/17292172000/giveme2entitlements.zip.html (major credits go to rest_ip for providing us with the link), extract the exe and simply run the thing. it overwrites one of the game's encrypted ini files, that most possibly contains the dreaded flags. : ) after this, the activation screen at the beginning of the game shouldn't appear anymore.
important note: the DLC that grants you the new recruitable characted Zaeed isn't yet included in the torrent (probably because it came out somewhat later than the dlc's listed above). as last I checked, you could download the Zaeed DLC from this link (file size is about 500 MB): http://static.cdn.ea.com/bioware/u/f/eagames/bioware/masseffect2/DLC/ME2_Zaeed.exe
BTW, does somebody know, how we could get our hands on the Hammerhead DLC? : ) as far as I know, it should be out already. if anyone discovers a link to it, be sure to let us know! : )
now get to it, ladies, the galaxy ain't gonna save itself!"
,taldira,2010-01-26T20:12Z,"It works, thx man."
,xdarkwolfx,2010-01-26T20:31Z,God dammit i did exactly that i even installed a fresh copy of the game and it still gives me the same bullshit about the cerberus network wtf???
,taldira,2010-01-26T20:39Z,"Go to options -> online and disable both, than reinstall dlc's and run the crack."
,CrossCrucial,2010-01-26T20:49Z,"giveme2entitlements.zip

Error: Could not find Mass Effect 2 DLC directory.

Mass Effect 2 isn't installed on C: drive. Suggestions?"
,Zagza,2010-01-26T20:51Z,put the crack inside Mass Effect 2 install directory
,CrossCrucial,2010-01-26T20:54Z,Thanks. already got it working. helps to actually install the DLC first and not be high as hell
,xdarkwolfx,2010-01-26T20:57Z,how the hell did it work for u guys i don't know i did everything that u sayd and still get the same freaking message F@#$ it 
,Zagza,2010-01-26T20:58Z,xdarkwolfx try out http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5310229/Mass_Effect_2_DLC everything you need to know is inside torrent
,SubGum,2010-01-26T21:14Z,"Very nice, thanks!
Now someone needs to upload the Hammerhead DLC."
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T21:18Z,"important note! for those who still have some issues preventing the activation screen from appearing - try this: after installing the fresh copy of the game, what you should immediately do BEFORE starting the game for the first time, is to check out the exceptions menu of your firewall settings, and make sure that the checkboxes next to 'Mass Effect 2 Game' and 'Mass Effect 2 Game Launcher' aren't ticked in. in my case, the game puts itself amond the firewall exceptions by default after having been installed. as far as I understand, if you prevent the game from accessing the net, you should be able to get the dlc's to work without any problems.
last but not least: loads of thanks and appreciation for all the people who helped us in obtaining the dlc packs, not to mention the genius minds behind the invaluable entitlement crack. : ) your heroic dedication shall be remembered for generations to come. : )"
,Isti01,2010-01-26T21:28Z,"makrayzs is right, before installing DLCs disable auto EA login in the options menu or it WON'T work!"
,McCrazy011,2010-01-26T21:38Z,"I've got a problem, i put giveme2entitlements in the install folder of me2, but it freezes while checking the first dlc, and im forced to close it. any solutions? 

thanks. (and ive redownloaded it, same issues. Im running vista 64 ult)."
,xdarkwolfx,2010-01-26T21:51Z,"Ok i don't get it i installed a fresh copy i blocked acces to internet befor running game i then disabled 
auto login i installed the dlc's and then i run the crack i enter the game and i still recive the conection to cerberus message "
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T21:59Z,"when you ran the crack executable, did a dialogue window actually pop up, asking you whether or not to replace the ini file? OR did the exe simply finish running without the popup window?"
,xdarkwolfx,2010-01-26T22:15Z,a dialogue window did pop up and i replaced the file
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T22:24Z,"if you haven't tried it already, perhaps you should try - aside the firewall blocking method - to block your internet access by actually disabling your internet connection in Start Menu -> Settings ->... etc. for the duration of the installation/settings/cracking (although when you execute the giveme2enlistments.exe, it may require an active internet connection at that precise moment to properly function without crashing). other than that, I really don't know what else to suggest... : S"
,xdarkwolfx,2010-01-26T22:26Z,i will try this to and if this doesen't work i hope in a few day's there will be some other crack ore something any ways tnx for the help 
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T22:26Z,"what I can say for sure is that is the exe actually asks you whether you really want to replace the ini file or not, then it's working just fine, so the problem is somewhere else to be found."
,xdarkwolfx,2010-01-26T22:35Z,Btw what game do u have i have the razor 1911 first one thet got on the torrents u have an other one maybe i should use some other crack i dunno
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T22:48Z,"nope, I have the very same one, so we can rule that out as well. anyways, try this last method (blocking your internet via the start menu -> settings -> connections menu), and see what happens. 'course this means you'll probably have to start over from the fresh installation yet again. : P"
,maul_inc,2010-01-27T00:27Z,Thank you! it works fine for me :-) all equipment works and Zead works too (got him from another pBay torrent) :D
,jablome2,2010-01-27T00:46Z,"For some reason I cannot download the Blood Dragon armor, I keep getting this error

,scopie,2010-01-27T05:41Z,does this work with the legit copy of the game?
,Wintermist,2010-01-27T08:13Z,"scopie - I'll find out in 2 days when I can finally unlock my Digital Deluxe Edition, now I get most DLC's for free but not all are included as some are promotional (pisses me off so bad). I'm going to install the ones I can't buy and then I can tell you if it works or not, I don't see any reason they wouldn't work though."
,Pothead808,2010-01-27T15:04Z,"Also having problems authorizing dlc, gets to main menu and says you need to log into cerebrus to accsess dlc, followed all the steps and even reinstalled :( anyone have any ideas?"

,Lekill,2010-01-28T18:04Z,"same authorization problem here, did everything right. could someone just upload the working BioPersistentEntitlementCache.ini?"
