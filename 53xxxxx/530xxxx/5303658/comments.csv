,MrEvolution,2010-01-25T17:07Z,Thx.
,rc71,2010-01-25T23:47Z,"Thanks for the upload.

The show itself is really lame.  poor acting and terrible production values.

To be honest we only watched about 3/4 of it.  
It's definitely no Rome or Gladiator.  

The fight scenes in Xena and Herc were better IMO."
,MrEvolution,2010-01-26T20:25Z,Just finished watching.I like it.
,ddelta,2010-01-27T06:00Z,"Video and audio quality are GREAT! Thx for the UP! Lots of sex and violence... reminds me what would happen if HBO and 300 mated! :)

Interested to see what direction the series goes!"
,Terratari,2010-01-28T08:24Z,"300 goes soap
2/10

I love ROME, but here you have a stupid american production which wantÂ´s to capitalise one the new 300 / ROME sandal hype.
The film cutting is 300 like style, with poor storyboard as cream and poor american looking actors as cheery on top. OMFG"
,TitMonger,2010-02-01T02:57Z,"LOL Terratari. I loved Rome as well....but you do realize that was an American production even if they filmed it in Italy. Of all the actors for Spartacus listed on the Starz site, only two of them, minor characters I might add, are American, and one of those two is from Lebanon and only came to the States later in life.

,Widowlicker,2010-02-14T20:09Z,"Wow what a bunch of crap this is. A bit of 300, a bit of Gladiator, some tits to lure some viewers and
a lot of too much computer generated blood. A typical cheap zion yankee production.
I'm sure that the words ""fuck"" and ""cunt"" didn't even exist during those days. What a flaw. 
A well the zions never have seen any trouble in the falsification of history.
That's why I steel all their products. Just to download and than throw it away, you zion cunts. "
,afgaviria,2010-02-15T18:06Z,"le echare un ojo q tal es, gracias."
,MrBugMan,2010-02-21T11:25Z,THANKS!
,darkrose6,2010-07-20T17:03Z,Thanks eztv!!! You should get paid for the amount of titles you put out! Thanks bro your work is appreciated
,darcmac,2010-08-12T02:19Z,"Terratari... this is clearly not an American production, stupid or otherwise. Go hate America elsewhere, faggot."
,darcmac,2010-08-12T02:22Z,"Widowlicker.... What are ""zion yankees""? Is that what terrorist rag-head bitches call Americans these days? That's why we spanked your ass in Iraq, cock-sucker."
,Fingervanten,2010-10-14T19:46Z,The show is really bad. Not a serie worth following. Hell even old Knight Rider is better.
,KingFisheR222,2010-11-10T23:44Z,"Video and audio is great indeed, but  the acting and plot is dreadfull.  Too much computer-made blood. Hate it. Lookes like  an anime or someting. By the way, what English do they use in there?? Sounds really barbarish.
Hence thank God I've downloaded the only episode."
,ytq,2011-08-12T20:33Z,thanks
,peterpandetimmerman,2011-09-28T17:29Z,so not worth the download?
