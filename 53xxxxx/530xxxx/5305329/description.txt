Winston Hayballs, the beer-bellied village poacher in this acclaimed Radio 4 institution.  


Winston is the creation of the well-known comic writer Peter Tinniswood (whose credits also include Uncle Mort, whose central preoccupation is British eccentricity.  

The five differently-titled series, which grew out of a 1987 radio play entitled The Village FÃªte, chart the exploits of Winston and the decidedly odd middle-class Empson family, to whom he attaches himself, as they struggle to make sense of the world around them.  

Nancy has recently moved to the village with her sister Rosie, her brother William and her father. When Winston the local poacher and handyman is thrown out by his wife he invites himself to stay with them.
