The Blow is really visual artist and performer Khaela Maricich, who formerly released recordings under the name Get the Hell Out of the Way of the Volcano, after which she recorded (with the help of some guests) for K under the name the Blow. The Blow set lyrics that sound like unverbalized thoughts to herself to minimal, often electronically textured basic pop melodies.

With Paper Television, The Blow succeeds in making an intelligent album that is only as intelligent as you want it to be. There are real lyrical and musical gems buried beneath the â€œmainstream party station musicâ€.
