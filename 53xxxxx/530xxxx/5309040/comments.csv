Thanks Tam "
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-26T10:54Z,"@Tam: Everything for you, Tam... but I had down-time twice: in first one collateral damage was Sanctuary 210. 
But I did 211:

and later a double12-13 but then, because of quarries with fans (you'll see how 210 stayed with only 2 seeders within a week). I've decided to drop-out Sanctuary forever and ever.
If you cannot find 210 someplace else, let me know. I can and I'll do it for my old friend Tam."

@hkoraddi: ""repetitio est mater studiorum"". It's Latin (Repetition is the mother of learning) and I must repeat myself... Answer was and is: Yes. Absolutely."

Keep up the good work Twenty :)
