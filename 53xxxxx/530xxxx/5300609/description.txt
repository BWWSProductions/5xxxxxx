"I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.â€

â€œA bone to the dog is not charity. Charity is the bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog.â€
