I desperately want your AOYAMA Shinji torrents, but some of them seem to be dying.  EM aka Enbamingu now has no seeders.  Any chance of reseeding that one?  (I'll seed to well over a ratio of 1.0, and anyway as long as there is no other seeder.)

How could I say no to someone who wants to have a big laugh with mr aoyama? but you'll have to wait a little while, hope not too long, certainly not until disney is brought back to life."
,pflagger,2010-01-24T16:56Z,Thanks dude!
,pflagger,2010-01-25T03:34Z,"Now Helpless has also died.  If you could reseed it when you can, that would be great."
,kureneko,2010-01-25T06:35Z,"Hi Polifem. Do you remember that I requested a reseed on ""Blind beast"" about 2 months ago?In fact you asked me for a 3 months reseed in return. I didn't give you an answer because I was about to move to another country, and I couldn't use starting internet immediately- anyway you started seeding for a few days. Now I'm capable of making a promise of seeding for 3 months, in fact I helped other leechers to get to 98 percent, but all of us stopped there, because nobody's there to seed- do you mind seeding for that remaining less than 2 percent?"

providing you didn't move to north korea..."
,kureneko,2010-01-25T21:00Z,@Polifem: No need to worry- I've just escaped from another country in so-called Axis of Evil!
,putbook2003,2010-01-26T10:41Z,poliform I m too shy of saying this. Please resead Kagero for 1 day.
[V],polifem2009,2010-01-26T11:16Z,"@putbook
are you too shy to POST THE LINK, also? we've got to do something with this shyness of yours...

OK. From now on no more reseeds if LINK is not attached."
