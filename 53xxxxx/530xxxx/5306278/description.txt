Here are the nicest song picks from the recordings of Mr. Dean Martin
He is my favorite along with Mr. Al Martino (most of all) although I love 
the singing style of Frank Sinatra too of course!

CD+G format easily converts to DivX in a one step process using our posted
converter here. The freely downloadable Karafun DJ style player for your 
PC will be a fun choice to make for your travelling roadshow perhaps!

Grazie! Michael Rizzo Chessman
