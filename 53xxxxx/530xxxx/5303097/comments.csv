,headtoy,2010-01-24T08:55Z,"Great upload. Thanks:)

I'm looking for the 11th disc though, the one with the extras? Anyone has the possibility to upload that it would be great:)"
[T],NLUPPER,2010-01-24T10:43Z,Disc 11 is in it: Extra's:  80 min docu
,headtoy,2010-01-24T15:37Z,"You're absolutely correct!
My bad, don't know how I missed it. I'm ever so grateful. Thank you very much. 

You're my first hero of 2010;)"
,TrustNobody,2010-02-01T21:34Z,If this one had english and/or nordic subs it would have doubled the downloads. People never learn.
,pacmarn,2010-03-04T03:00Z,please seeeeeed :( im only on 30kpb and have another 8 weeks to go

,Zendra,2010-03-18T00:57Z,is the picture better than the HDDVD version?
,d0wnld,2010-03-27T17:56Z,"Please keep seeding this torrent, the speed isn't that good.."
,JHBfromNO,2010-04-25T03:18Z,"Please stream! Seeders, do your job! I'm at 99.9% at almost every of the last 5 episodes. Keep seeding so I can too :)"
,jakslev,2010-06-07T12:50Z,Quality seems great - but somehow I am unable to watchit on VLC (Linux) and Popcorn Hour A110. It goes fine for some seconds but then starts to lose sound and jump frames. Any ideas anyone?
,Scott8885,2010-06-14T02:02Z,GOM Player + http://www.cccp-project.net/ worked fine for me.
,oxycodone,2010-06-22T05:20Z,this is a terrible rip. im just curious as to why anyone would put 8 ref frames in 1080p video. not only is using 8 ref frames retarded the author isnt consistant. some of the videos have 4 while others have 8. did u ever concider some of us remux these x264 files and put them on bluray for playing in standalone players. 8 ref frames. jesus christ
,ericepp2,2010-06-28T07:34Z,To those who have finished this.  Does this have hard-coded subs?
,ericepp2,2010-06-28T07:42Z,"to ->  TrustNobody

What the hell are you talking about.  You're not being pretentiously vague enough for me to understand what you are trying to say.  Since I am a smug prick of the most elite fashion, you must confuse me more than this to get your point across.  Thanks in advance for more obscure gobbledygook. "
,ericepp2,2010-06-28T07:44Z,I must apologize for not using a question mark at the end of the first sentence of my last post.  Sorry 'bout dat.
,Nelus1993,2010-08-23T08:23Z,Zit er ook een menu op?
,hmac2,2010-10-06T03:59Z,"Great quality rip. It didn't take me too long to get either. I just left it on overnight 1 episode a time.

I'm on a 100mbit connection and will continue to seed during my off-peak hours.

Thanks NLUPPER!"
,Joe-nigga,2010-12-24T05:17Z,thnk you please keep seeding
,gwidjaja,2011-05-11T18:02Z,"thanks a bunch NLUPPER.. I love this movie so much, i have the DVD but they got scratched. so this saves me.

guys, please seed, 72Gigs is huge and with less than 10kb it will take months. usually i can get 100kb on other d/l.
seed... please.."
,mosmooth,2011-07-16T23:40Z,"@ oxycodone - You should know that the 8 reference frames are coupled with the format profile's that are @L5.1, and appropriate for that. The 4 reference frames are only in the @L4.1 format profile encodes, and appropriate for those too. You can always re-encode if you are that desperate to use a clunky and cumbersome BluRay player. 

If you want to go a little higher tech, get a Popcorn Hour and remux all your .mkvs to get rid of the unwanted subs and audio tracks. I even re-title mine so I know exactly what I'm watching and the audio encoder it uses (e.g. DTS, AAC, Dolby 5.1 etc.) and the exact resolution (e.g. 816, 544 etc.)

BluRay. Only good thing about the set up is that the discs are heaven-sent for us High Def pirates. As for 3-D,-isn't it brilliant that .mkv3 has been engineered for those who have a PCH and a 3D TV.

All hail Pirates."
,mosmooth,2011-07-16T23:43Z,p.s. Thanks NLUPPER. Nice upload. All BluRay's are far better quality than the now defunct HD DVD's (which I first had of this boxset.)
,Schappe,2011-08-21T15:48Z,"If anyone would seed this for me I would be forever thankful, downloaded the HDDVD but I couldn't stream it to my Samsung SMART TV :(
I am at 29kb/s and it's going to take 8 more weeks :("
,RobHood19,2012-04-05T21:11Z,could somebody please seed ive seeded like 50 gb and only downloaded 7 gb. its a shame seems to be a good torent.  
,CounterPillow,2012-06-16T02:57Z,holyshitholyshitholyshit thankyouuuuuuu
