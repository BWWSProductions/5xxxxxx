Children wake up screaming in the middle of the night, telling you they saw a monster. All you can tell them is that thereâ€™s nothing to worry about, that it isnâ€™t real. But thatâ€™s not strictly true.

As we grow up, the monsters continue to haunt us and are given names that have echoed down the centuries: Werewolves that will rip out our throats, Vampires that will suck out our blood, Frankenstein's monster whoâ€™ll murder us in a dark alley. But it turns out that these familiar spine-chilling nightmares all have their origins in historical fact.

Now, across three episodes, we invite you to confront the true face of horror. Combining heart stopping narrative drama with expert interviews, True Horror uncovers the inspiration behind three of our most thrilling, visceral and iconic monsters: Dracula, Frankenstein and the Werewolf. These stories will transport you to the haunted corners of our past and prove that fact is a whole lot more frightening than fiction.

[b]Dracula:[/b]
15th century Romania. Three monks find themselves chained to the wall of a dripping cell in the castle of Vlad Dracula, Voyvoyd of Wallachia, more commonly known as Vlad the Impaler. 

Over time, Dracula would go down as one of the most terrifying rulers of Medieval Europe, a psychopathic mass-murderer, who stood between Christian Europe and the advancing armies of the Ottoman Turks.

From the outset the monks are tested, climaxing in a trial of brutality in which they are called to answer truthfully whether Vlad Dracula will be warmly received in Heaven.  Waiting for them is a forest of wooden stakes, ends rounded to stop them puncturing internal organs, prolonging their gruesome effect.  The most appallingly slow, painful death imaginable will be their fate if they choose the wrong response. 

Dracula: True Horror dramatises the vicious story that gave birth to the Dracula of fact and fiction.
