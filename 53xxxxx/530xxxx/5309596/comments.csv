,Consolamentum,2010-03-28T01:28Z,"I don't necessarily think Dracula was a psychopath. He did impale POWs and other enemies, but then again so did the Turks. It seems to me that he simply wanted to turn the tables on them and give them a taste of their own medicine.

As for the other nasty stuff he has been accused of, I don't think we can rule out the possibility that a lot of it can be chalked down to propaganda. 

We know that Vlad frequently had conflicts with the Saxons (i.e. German settlers in Wallachia and Transylvania). Since most of the sources that describe Vlad's brutal excesses were German in origin, one would imagine that the authors of these pamphlets would want to exaggerate his brutality to make him look as evil and dangerous as possible.

Dracula may have been a volatile man and you'd certainly not want to piss him off, but I still sometimes think that we should be grateful to him for doing his part in protecting the rest of Europe from the encroaching Ottoman Empire."

He was the ruler of a tiny country with small military resources, and with a big power-hungry neighbour who wanted to conquer his territories. If the word was out that he was monstrously cruel to anyone who crossed him, it would be a powerful deterrent against attacks (even if the rumours should happen to be somewhat exaggerated!)."
