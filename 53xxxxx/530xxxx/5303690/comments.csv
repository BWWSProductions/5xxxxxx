Van Diemen's Land (the movie) is an independent film made by film makers, who received absolutely no financial support from commercial or government sources at all, and made this film using there own funds. I'm aware that the film makers haven't broke even yet, and therefore no-one except the distributor has been paid as of yet.

It might be ok to download films and music of large, powerful studios that can soak up the loss of revenue from piracy. This however is not one of those films. Van Diemen's Land is made by a group of passionate film makers, who have made a difficult film the best they can with limited resources. I think its time they got paid.

Please, if you value independent films and if you like this film please buy an official copy of the DVD. You can order it online here...

I'm not against file sharing. I do it myself, but I like to think that there's a decent amount of people out there who'll support small vendors of independent films, rather than just ripping them off like you are. 

I don't care if you download some big hollywood film. They're big enough to be able to not be really bothered. But the small studios really bare the brunt of file sharing cause they don't have the turnover to cover the loss. Anyway no one really cares what you do. You're clearly some insignificant piss-ant... and clearly my message wasn't really aimed at troglodytes like you anyway. "
