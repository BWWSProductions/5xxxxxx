NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

Right now no doubt the tagging of this will cause some to moan.....but it all honesty we could have tagged it several different ways and some would still question them so

We opted for DVDSCR LiNE ......based on the same as a R5 LiNE tag.Video is a dvdscr but the audio is line so ...

Anyway we used the spanish dvdscr that has been out for a while but we was holding back until we got some decent audio and here it is.

Video and audio have both been tweaked and audio needed to be synced....got too be honest and say there is some slight sync issues here and there but not by much,50ms give or take....but this was a bitch to sync so ......if you want perfection do it yourself

credit IMAGiNE & ghostman BIG TIME & to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone
