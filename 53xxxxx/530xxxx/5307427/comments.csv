,johnnymp3seed,2010-01-28T03:33Z,thanks for the torrent - can a Demonoid member please seed vol 17 which anon_I_Mouse has forgotten to do so.
,Anon_I_Mouse,2010-01-29T00:36Z,"I didn't forget to do it, for some reason I just can't (?) do it; I've been trying for a week. Whenever I try to upload I get either done (showing a blank page), wrong Capcha code (when it obviously isn't) or Error 404 - page not found.

I've tried remaking the torrent, two different browsers, clearing all cookies, rebooting, with VPN on and off and from different IPs (UK, NL & USA). This is driving me round the bend. If anybody's got any suggestions I'd be glad to hear them."
,Cyberpro60,2010-01-29T03:16Z,"Its just a suggestion but there may be an error/inconsistency in the jpeg images you are trying to upload that can cause this problem. 

Open each images in a graphics package [eg Photoshop] & save them in .BMP format. Then, re-open each .BMP image and save them back as .JPG overwriting the original JPEG images.

Let us know if this helps"
,Yondering,2010-03-25T14:31Z,"First of all...  Thank You for uploading this fantastic torrent!  It is very much appreciated.

I know it has been a while, but is it possible for you to upload Part 17? (Not having 17, is putting my OCD into overdrive - lol)

How about breaking 17 up into 2 parts..?"
