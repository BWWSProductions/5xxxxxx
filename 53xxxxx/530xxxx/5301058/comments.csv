This is the keygen unpacked:

P.S. Running a keygen in a sandbox or VM will prevent it from interacting with your OS while still allowing you to activate your software."
,ack624,2010-02-09T01:26Z,"Thxs, sandboxed and worked like a charm."
,jsainsbury,2010-03-13T06:10Z,"Did not work for v3.0 Build 45.
It probably will work v3.0 Build 43. Haven't tried that yet."
,ALoach,2010-03-13T18:11Z,I test this with each new build on multiple machines. It worked with builds 44 and 45 so there was no need to release a new version.
,smratalleck,2010-03-15T02:55Z,"I don't know if I'm the only one, but when I try to open the keygen, I get a message saying that windows cannot access the file, and I may not have appropriate permissions...tried on XP and Windows 7, tried running as admin...dunno what else to try"
,ALoach,2010-03-15T06:48Z,"I've tested it on many XP and Windows 7 machines, including XP running in a virtual machine. It really sounds like an anti-virus program is blocking it. I use Kaspersky myself and while it takes its sweet time scanning it before it runs, it does let it run eventually.

If turning off your AV makes you nervous, you can run it in a sandbox (use Sandboxie, for example) or a virtual machine and just copy and paste the codes between your machine and the keygen.

Another possibility is that you have debugging or reverse engineering tools running, things like Regmon, etc."
,arcspin,2010-03-24T22:01Z,"Hi ALoach,
Thank you for an excellent upload.
I have one question, what is the Fingerprint and how do I get a correct fingerprint for my computer?

Probably a bit of a n00b question but I had to ask. *smile*"
,ALoach,2010-03-24T22:42Z,WKO+ generates the fingerprint for your system and displays it in the registration prompt. You copy and paste that into the keygen and then copy and paste the activation code back into WKO+.
,chall52,2010-07-07T03:05Z,"Thanks for the upload.
when ever I try to run the program I get an ""Access is Denied"" error. I've tried disabling my antivirus and running it in a sandbox but still the same error. Any advice?"
,ALoach,2010-07-08T04:16Z,"It really sounds like something is preventing you from running the keygen. AV software is the most common but not the only culprit.

The other possibility is that you have reverse engineering software running.

The keygen works on plenty of PCs (all 5 of mine) so keep trying different computers until you find one where it works."

,sdsm12,2011-02-04T14:46Z,"Program installed fine, but doesn't generate correct registration code for Build 48.  Carefully cut and pasted fingerprint, but corresponding registration code wasn't valid."
,ALoach,2011-02-08T16:36Z,Tested build 48 on a computer with a previous build installed and on a computer that's never had WKO installed on it before. It worked both times.
,sdsm12,2011-02-09T00:48Z,Thanks - my bad - I reread the instructions and it worked.  Missed the part about clicking on the [!] button prior to hitting activate.  Did it correctly and worked fine.
,aercool,2011-02-09T21:58Z,Any chance someone could seed?  Most appreciated!
,paddy1980,2011-04-23T09:52Z,"Hi, this is driving me nuts! Wont run in sandbox or in Windows. Have disabled anti-virus, tried different compatability types. Tried this on 4 different PCs running 7, Vista and XP. Any chance someone could run the keygen on their PC and send me the codes on Suprbay forum? Username paddy1980
Cheers!"
