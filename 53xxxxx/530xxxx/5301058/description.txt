This keygen will generate codes for 2.2 (and probably 2.1) as well. As such, all the previous 2.2 cracks are obsolete.


NOTES:

Be extremely careful that you enter the Fingerprint exactly (O's and 0's are not
the same thing). Copy & paste is preferable to typing.

If you're trying to register 2.2 build 103-106, it may be helpful to delete any
existing registration info. Simply delete the entire branch from the registry:

Please post a comment there if you have a Fingerprint that you cannot generate a
working Activation Code for.

Avoid fakes, go to the source (here at TPB).


INSTRUCTIONS:

Select the version of WKO. Default is 3.0.

Copy the Fingerprint and paste it into the keygen.

Click on the Generate button to generate the codes.

Click on the [!] button in the WKO+ registration window. This is very important
as it enables manual (offline) activation mode. If you hit the Activate button
before this, their server will NOT activate your copy because they likely have
no record of your purchase!

After you click on the [!] button, the adjacent Activation code entry box will
no longer be read-only and will allow you to enter text. Copy and paste the
generated activation code there.

Enter whatever name you wish.

Copy and paste the generated registration code.

Now click on the Activate button.
