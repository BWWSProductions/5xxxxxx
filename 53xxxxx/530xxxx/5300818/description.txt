we have a much improved line-up in a 6.88GB CDG offering (or 4.8GB zipped)  which makes the older versions obsolete, and with many great additions plus better versions substitutions too. 

The complete 6.88GB cdg offerings is our best yet! unzipped cd+g and rar zipped
7.5GB Divx versions can be found on the net. These versions are vastly improved from our previous collections. The DivX offerings are improved with 1100k bitrate and are individually compressed into rar files for you.

For those of you strong fans of the Broadway musicals genre, this seeding 
is for you!

Kindly note that we are trying to address seeding problems with stubborn software as of late with the introduction of a second server at our site with its own captive modem. We therefore are seeding with two servers, using two ISPs and
trying our best to get the maximum output into the torrents we possibly could
with the presently available software. We rotate the bittorrent software we use
as each seems to do better at random times.
