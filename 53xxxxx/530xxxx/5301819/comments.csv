It is better to torrent open-source programs.  Bandwidth is expensive and Open-Source programs are not making any money.  They want their programs spread, and you are helping spread them in a way that costs them no money.

On another note.  If you have a copy of CCleaner already, just copy the files from Program Files (or whereever you installed it) as that CCleaner doesnt make use of the registry, it is already a portable app."
