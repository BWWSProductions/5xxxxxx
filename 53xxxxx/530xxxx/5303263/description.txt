These are the videos videos originally uploaded by UASports ontoalong with some other stuff.  Many of the UASports videos have been removed fromand are no longer available.  Included are audio and video of the BCS Championship game against Texas and the Heisman Trophy presentation.  Most video is 1280x720 although not all are.  BCS Championship video starts right at kick-off and is missing the pre-game stuff.  Tiffin highlights and North Texas game are missing audio as it was removed byprior to me downloading them.
