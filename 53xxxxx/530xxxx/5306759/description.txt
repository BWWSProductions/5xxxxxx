Two families, the Graystones and the Adamas, live together on a peaceful planet known as Caprica, where a startling breakthrough in artificial intelligence brings about unforeseen consequences. A spin-off of the Sci Fi Channel series "Battlestar Galactica" set 50 years prior to the events of that show.
Touted as "television's first science fiction family saga," Caprica is from Battlestar Galactica executive producers, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick.[/quote]
