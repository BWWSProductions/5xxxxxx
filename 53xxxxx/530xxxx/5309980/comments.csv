,jamesmc100,2010-01-26T17:48Z,Why wouldnt you trust me? 
,jamesmc100,2010-01-26T17:58Z,"I understand that, but everyone has start somewhere and the only way you can become a trusted uploader is if people take the chance to download your torrents. But I guess its up to you whether you download it or not. But I dont think its fair to say dont trust me just because Im new."

Thanks for the comment. Would you mind leaving comments on video and audio quality, so that other people have some idea? I would ave included it in the description myself, but as was pointed out by another poster I may not be able to be trusted :P lol"
,pankajvg,2010-02-02T04:59Z,"Video & sound quality is very good.

Thanks to the uploader"
,lifeitsa,2010-02-15T23:43Z,thanks a lot... keep up the good work .....niceeeeeeee
,TheJaron,2010-02-16T21:11Z,"Video & Sound quality is very good. I was a little skeptical at first because this was my first time downloading a movie, but it was excellent."
,KoningKaas,2010-02-17T00:23Z,"Downloading right now,
will give an A/V review!
I think this is awesome, those 6~7 gig files are too big and i cant play them on my xbox.
I think this one will work!"
,KoningKaas,2010-02-17T09:51Z,"A/9-V/9

Okay ive downloaded this, It looks like it works, havent watched the complete movie tho, however watched a couple of bits and IT WORKS on XBOX 360, for those who wanna know.
And its good quality, much much better then the TS and a good size, however i think that the aspect ratio might need some work, i cant get it nicely full screen on my xbox, but that could be just me, maybe a bit higher resolution might do the quality some better.

All in all a great torrent, those HD files are to big for me, and this is a great download size and nice quality, Thanks!"
,jamesmc100,2010-02-17T18:56Z,"@KoningKaas
I know the aspect ratio is abit odd, thats what it was on the HD file I used to convert down to this SD file. Im not sure why its that myself."
,SOULWOLF,2010-02-25T19:25Z,Great Download Thank U and as u say that you r new at this I must say keep up the Great work 
,snuffyluv,2010-02-28T04:28Z,so far so good... will give a/v feedback after I watch it
,snuffyluv,2010-02-28T19:33Z,"ok I finally watched it and this is my feedback....
I will give the V/9 and the A/10.
you get about 3/4 of the way through the movie and it stops and skips really bad. but other than that Great work for being your first upload to TPB!!!"

,ml01172,2010-05-03T20:42Z,"Don't know about the quality, but speed... started going 4-40kB/s, sometimes 4, sometimes 40, then I left the house. Here I am 5 hours later... 110MB. 0,8kB/s. WTF!? I believed the guy above about ""fast download"", but it seems these were some other times. Abandon the ship."
