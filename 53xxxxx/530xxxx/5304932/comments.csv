,IamDUFF,2010-10-12T16:18Z,"Priority (1-15) and Bandwidth allocating really don't change much, it's all relative to your connection so the only way it screws someone over is if you download one at a time using priory, But that's no different than a leech and run.
Unfortunately my internet sucks, i can upload at most (when i'm lucky) 40kb/s so i don't help much.

sorry."
