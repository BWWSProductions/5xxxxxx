,zero_inspiration,2010-01-26T07:32Z,"thomasmcgee - if you really want a demonoid invite, you'll have to provide some contact info. But things are much better seeded here. Demonoid is safer, yes, but the pirate bay is MUCH faster."

,iTPB,2010-01-26T21:25Z,"Demonoid and TPB are just different no better or worse. I have not experienced demonoid being slow. I'd say in most cases there is a bigger variety here, but demonoid has a much better selection of mac specific software than TPB... as far as movies go Demonoid tends to have older ones too where as TPB does not. Sometimes I can only find certain things on one or the other and not both. 

As for an invite... I only invite people I know. I take inviting people to a private community very seriously. "
