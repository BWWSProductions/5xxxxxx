[V],twentyforty,2010-01-24T11:02Z,"@whopper27: I have upped three versions of ""2012"" so far. Forth one is too much.
Beside, I already nave declined two identical requests just yesterday, and for identical reason.

However, rest assured, there is nothing wrong with latest one, ""TwentyTwelve"" buried on Page 3 or 4. It's re-encode of hand-picked DVDrip without any faults."
