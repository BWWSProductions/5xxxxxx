,FicoMkd,2010-01-24T03:37Z,"@L1F3cycle
Search the net for a program called Fast AVI MPEG Splitter. It does the trick and it's easy to use.

And as for the subtitle thingy, download a software called Subtitle Workshop. When installed and opened go to Tools - Join Subtitles. Put the cd1 first then cd2. Click on the Set Movie Fragment, find the newly created .avi and click ok and then join...Save the newly created file as .srt and you are set to go."

you need to search for DVDrip.  Source here is BluRay so expect the encode to be twice the size of CD.

I used many unrar programs but 'WINRAR' seems to work the best. If your already using WINRAR then your SOL"
,libertaswv,2010-01-24T22:30Z,"@dtstuff9: If you don't want to bother finding/learning merge software (it's no big deal tho), just get ConvertX, go to the prefs, and tell it to play the titles consecutively. Still two files, but only a second (maybe 2) of lag time/black screen. Saves a step if you're just making a personal use copy.

@kaisar302: winRAR + ConvertX to burn. If the RARs are complete and uncompromised (as i imagine these are), you'll be fine. If not, it's as eagle_poacher said...SOL..."
