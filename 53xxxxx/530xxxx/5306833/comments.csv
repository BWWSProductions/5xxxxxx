Stargate Atlantis is the spin of show to SG-1, taking place in the city of Atlantis in the Pegasus galaxy. The crew faces a soul-eating enemy called the wraith that dwarfs an villain previously seen in the franchise. 

The show is full of humor, action, and technobable and is a great watch for anyone who likes Sci Fi. Also has several attractive lead actresses. "
