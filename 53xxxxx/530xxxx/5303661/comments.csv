You also need to Disable your AV software In order to download and make this work. RAR it ASAP so wont be detected as a virus from your AV ."
,CVezery,2011-06-29T02:01Z,"@'Agilitying'
of course its going to be detected as a virus, it's an RAT you infect computers with."
,mitchboy,2011-08-04T21:43Z,normally there should be only ONE file with a backdoor trojan. But this time there are TWO trojans in your upload! Could you please explain?
,mriddler,2011-09-11T16:11Z,"You also need to Disable your AV software In order to download and make this work. RAR it ASAP so wont be detected as a virus from your AV .
just like what @ifraaz said
1-disable antivirus shields or real-time protection
2-download torrent
3-RAR it
4-re-enable your antivirus
and when u wanna use it, do step 1 again"
