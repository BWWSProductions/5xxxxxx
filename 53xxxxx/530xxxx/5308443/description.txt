Pinocchio Blu-ray
Disney / Buena Vista | 1940 | 88 mins | Rated G | Mar 10, 2009

Lonely woodcarver Geppetto longs for a child, and his wish is partially granted when the Blue Fairy brings his wooden marionette Pinocchio to life. In order to become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself worthy. He sets out into the world, accompanied by his "conscience," Jiminy Cricket. Pinocchio is led astray by the wicked fox J. Worthington Fowlfellow, first to "a life in the theater"- Stromboli's puppet show - and then to Pleasure Island, where boys behave like (and become!) jackasses. Pinocchio redeems himself by saving Geppetto from Monstro, the whale.
