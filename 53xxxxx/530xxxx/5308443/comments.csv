Kube2: The difference is due to the fact that Pinocchio and Snow White were made before the 50?s and all movies before the 50?s were done in 4:3 (1.33:1) pretty much a square.
When home TVs became more popular movie theaters changed to 2.55:1 widescreen to try and offer a different product then what people were getting at home. This is when Sleeping Beauty was made.
The 2.55:1 ratio is actually wider than 16:9 (1.78:1) so on your widescreen TV you will probably still get black bars unless you adjust your TV.
A 4:3 ratio film will translate to a 1440훯혰1080 high def image instead of 1920훯혰1080.
End of lesson. lol
I asked my friend who is a film editor for Lucas Arts."
