 Besides, under Spanish law, a baptized Jew had a higher status than a baptized Christian in that even the King could marry any common Jewess but not any Christian commoner.
 ...and not all former Jews were traitors; Isabela I's chaplain was a former Jew and many nobles of that time were former Jews.
 If they really didn't wanna become Christians, why did they convert in the first place? True Jews migrated elsewhere...that's why Jews in the Balkans speak a language that's just like Spanish (Ladino)...
 Spain is not Israel. Israel rightly belongs to Jews and Jews alone, but Spain also rightly belongs Gentiles and gentiles alone...challenging that would be challenging the validity of the Israel state."
