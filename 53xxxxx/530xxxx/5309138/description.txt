
This is the absorbing story of Che Guevara and how Alberto "Korda" Diaz's iconic photograph has come to represent so much to different generations. It is the story of a photographer and the most reproduced image of a person in the 20th century, and how mythology through art becomes larger than life. Cheâ€™s image now sells on posters, T-shirts and beer bottles, but what does he represent to modern consumers? Interviewees include Antonio Banderas, Gerry Adams and Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal.
