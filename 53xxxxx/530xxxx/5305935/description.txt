The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

Today's show, however, consists entirely of previously broadcast material.

Here's the description from the Infowars web site:

In Sunday's encore presentation, Alex talks with 
former New Jersey Superior Court Judge and now a political and legal analyst for Fox News Channel, Judge Napalitano, 
physician and Republican Congressman for the 14th congressional district of Texas, Ron Paul, 
candidate in the 2010 Texas gubernatorial election, Debra Medina, 
president of Solari, Inc., the publisher of The Solari Report, managing member of Solari Investment Advisory Services, LLC, Catherine Austin Fitts, 
and Member of the European Parliament for Yorkshire and the Humber for the United Kingdom Independence Party, Godfrey Bloom. 



Original air-dates:
Judge Andrew Napalitano -- Jan. 14
Congressman Ron Paul -- Jan. 7
Debra Medina -- Jan. 15
Catherine Austin Fitts -- Jan. 13
EUPM Godfrey Bloom -- Jan. 20

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
