Do you, my friends, think that these hard-fisting people comes from Africa, Asia or from any other godforsaken corner of this beautiful world?

No. They are ALL from Norway, Niederland, Sweden and USA. All  really undeveloped countries with unbearably low standard of living, right?
I am sure that they struggle same as the guy from Myanmar or guy from India who have 10 kB/s connections and probably give last penny to pay their so called Internet.

Bigger is better - they say. I disagree, I have nothing to compensate. Mother nature has taken care of that..."
