    Lt. John Dunbar is dubbed a hero after he accidentally leads Union       
    troops to a victory during the Civil War. He requests a position on      
    the western frontier, but finds it deserted. He soon finds out he is     
    not alone, but meets a wolf he dubs "Two-socks" and a curious Indian     
    tribe. Dunbar quickly makes friends with the tribe, and discovers a      
    white woman who was raised by the Indians. He gradually earns the        
    respect of these native people, and sheds his white-man's ways.
