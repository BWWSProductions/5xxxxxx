,bakalhau90,2010-02-28T04:50Z,"Maybe, probably. I don't know the difference between -6 and -4. Just download and give it a try."
,crimson93,2010-03-01T21:38Z,Does this work with 550 Gen-D3? (Phat PSP)
,bakalhau90,2010-03-02T00:09Z,"Just download one of the 5.50 Gen-D3 versions. There's plenty of those floating around, this upload was specifically for the versions specified in the torrent title and description. I can't really answer your question because I didn't test it on your version.

People, just read the description first before asking questions. It's written in clear English."
