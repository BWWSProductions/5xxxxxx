,OrvoTM,2011-11-10T09:51Z,"It installs fine on Windows 7 Ultimate SP1, but it's not activated. If you copy the files in the crack folder to the /pb folder, the program will start just fine, you can choose the vehicle, but you won't be able to browse any parts, as the left half of the program will be in grey (deactivated). So now I'm trying to figure our how to carry on with the activation. Anyone ?"
