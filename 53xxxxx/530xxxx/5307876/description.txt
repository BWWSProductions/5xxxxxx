plot:
A sweet reminiscence about a family of four children and their RAF-veteran dad,
who knows the timetable of every bus in London, but realizes his large family
 needs a car. He buys a Peugeot station wagon - license plate GFP831E, and the
 family sets off for annual holidays exploring every corner of Europe - 
"adopting local customs but never forgetting who won the war." The narrator is
one of the children who, as he ages, sees things he missed as a lad - the car no
 rocket, dad no speedster. As the years wear on, and the car sits in the driveway,
 dad keeps it ready for the next great summer holiday.
