Release Notes:

The onetime frontman for hair-metal hitmakers Skid Row, singer Sebastian Bach
was born Sebastian Bierk in the Bahamas on April 3, 1968. A veteran of
short-lived, little-known bands including Herrenvolk, Madame X, V05 and Kid
Wikkid, he was living in Canada when in 1987 he received a demo tape from an
unknown New Jersey band in search of a lead singer; the group was Skid Row,
formed a year earlier by ex-Bon Jovi guitarist Dave "Snake" Sabo. Signing to
Atlantic, Skid Row issued its self-titled debut album in 1989; an opening slot
on Bon Jovi's U.S. tour, combined with heavy MTV airplay of the video "Youth
Gone Wild," launched the band to stardom, and the singles "18 and Life" and "I
Remember You" both reached the Top Ten. Bach, with his wildman persona and
photogenic looks, quickly emerged as the focus of fan and media attention, a
situation compounded in late 1989 when, during a concert in Springfield, MA, he
was hit in the head by a bottle thrown onstage; the singer proceeded to hurl the
bottle back into the crowd, where it hit the face of an innocent girl, before
physically assaulting another audience member as well. Sentenced to three years
probation, Bach then appeared on MTV wearing an offensive T-shirt emblazoned
with the slogan "AIDS Kills Fags Dead," prompting outcries from the gay
community. Despite the bad publicity, Skid Row's second album, 1991's Slave to
the Grind, debuted at number one, although it quickly fell off the charts; in
the wake of 1995's disappointing Subhuman Race, Bach was dismissed from the
group, briefly forming a band with ex-Breeder Kelley Deal before going solo in
1997. The album Bring 'Em Bach Alive arrived two years later, followed by a live
DVD (Forever Wild) in 2004 and Angel Down in 2007.
