Features and Benefits: 

* Support for MicrosoftÂ® Windows 7

* Continuous Data Protection 
Acronis Nonstop Backupâ„¢ automatically creates incremental backups every five minutes allowing users to roll back their system, files, and folders to any point in time. 

* Virtual Hard Disk Support 
Save backup images (.tib) as virtual hard disk (.vhd) files. Run your existing system as a virtual machine, or boot using Windows 7 Ultimate. 

* New Powerful Scheduler 
In addition to the scheduling tools found in previous versions, the new scheduler expands the amount of scheduling options available. Use the new calendar view to build schedules and tasks. Suspend and enable tasks, specify dates to run tasks, and copy tasks to new dates. 

* Boot from Windows 7 image 
Windows 7 Ultimate users can boot from a backup image (.tib file) containing a backup of their system partition. This will allow the ability to test a backed up system without actual restoration. If the operating system boots from the .tib file, then it will boot when the need arises for a system recovery.
