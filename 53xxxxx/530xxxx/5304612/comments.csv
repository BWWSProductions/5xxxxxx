,wagga7,2010-09-15T20:12Z,The movie was rated at 92% by Rotten Tomatoes....good enough for me...;)
,leracos,2010-09-20T14:48Z,"Quick question. Are Subs for the English included with this? I see a RAR for subs, so no idea if English is included. Looking forward to this one."
,mobbed1,2011-01-02T22:23Z,"The english subs have not been added.. I've been looking for that, and had expected that it'll contain the english subs as said... but alas...!!!

or wait a min... am i doing something wrong, well i use VLC!  let me have insight on this matter...

thanks for the upper anyway..:)"
,youuns,2011-01-06T16:47Z,"Audio: Spanish | 125kbps | MP3

Sub English included .

Is there a English audio version?"
,brodil,2011-01-08T06:54Z,thanks!!
,Interrogatory,2011-02-26T18:16Z,"I do not know what the above commenters are talking about, for I see no English subs in this download. There is a .rar containing .sub and .idx files but they are also in Spanish! So I do not recommend this download unless you speak/read Spanish. If anyone knows of an English version of this film, please post. Tx!"
,Interrogatory,2011-03-08T09:10Z,"How I solved the problem of this not actually having English subtitles included:
1) Downloaded rucucu's excellent .srt file from allsubs dot org.
2) Did an ""Advanced Open"" in VLC, choosing this film and the .srt file. Set the .srt to start 40 seconds delayed.
Hope this helps others!"
,laned130,2011-05-31T18:27Z,"Just to confirm ppl - you will need to download subs from elsewhere - try Google ;-)

Even though the title says no rars, there are actually rars inside rars, and the resulting subs file fails to load - VLC can't recognise format."
,laned130,2011-06-01T18:26Z,"A/V/M: 7/7/7
Many Thanks for the Up!"
,gujjuman17,2011-07-08T16:10Z,"nice quality and i am conforming it has english subs..

,mutblarg,2011-12-16T11:03Z,"Yes it does have English subtitles but plays Spanish ones by default, as said above just choose the English ones in the player you're using. 

Also may need to put the .sub and .idx files in the same folder as the film to get them to play."
