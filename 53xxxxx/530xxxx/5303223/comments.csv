,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-01-27T23:59Z,"Question. Why is it when I use ConvertXToDVD on this file and try to make it a NTSC the end result is the audio is going faster than the video? This is the only file I have ever ran into that does this when I try to convert it. Please give me feedback on one of my uploads. Thank you.

Audio: 9
Video: 9"

,versedispersed,2010-02-01T12:49Z,"@ J4CK_THE_R1PPER: This movie is in PAL format that's why you are running into the problem. Try rays other torrent on the same movie.
