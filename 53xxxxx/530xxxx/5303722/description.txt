Bio Zombie (traditional Chinese: ç”ŸåŒ–å£½å±) is a 1998 Hong Kong zombie-comedy film, starring Jordan Bem Chan. It spoofs George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead and shows many similarities to Peter Jackson's Braindead.

This movie takes place in a mall where two young men along with other people work inside a local mall. They both seem to not get along very well due to lack of customers. One night the two young men give an apparently dying businessman a soft drink, which is in actuality an experimental Iraqi biological weapon that turns him into a flesh-eating zombie. Returning to the mall in which they work, the man escapes and begins infecting the mall population, forcing a small group of misfits to band together in order to survive.
