DESCRIPTION
===========

What have past acts of destruction taught us about what will happen to mankind after 
the apocalypse? Is it inevitable that disaster will someday strike America on an 
unprecedented level? How has history prepared us? History's most dramatic events--
Hiroshima, 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and others--are examined and analyzed with hard 
data gathered from their massive aftereffects. The disappearance of water and food 
supplies, the effects of deteriorated sanitation and health care on the remaining 
population, and the increased use of violence as a means of survival--all illustrate 
how societies have responded and survived.
