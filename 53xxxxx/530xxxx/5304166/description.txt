[::Review::]

The Three Tenors is a name given to the Spanish singers PlÃ¡cido Domingo and JosÃ© Carreras and the Italian singer Luciano Pavarotti who sang in concert under this banner during the 1990s and early 2000s. The trio began their collaboration with a performance at the ancient Baths of Caracalla, in Rome, Italy, on July 7, 1990 â€“ the eve of the 1990 FIFA World Cup final. Zubin Mehta conducted the Orchestra del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino and the Orchestra del Teatro dell'Opera di Roma.
The idea of the concert was originally conceived by the Italian manager/producer Mario Dradi, to raise money for Carreras's foundation as well as a way for his contemporaries, Domingo and Pavarotti, to welcome their friend and colleague back to the world of opera after his successful treatment for leukemia.
The three subsequently sang together, in concerts produced by Hungarian Tibor Rudas and others, at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles for the 1994 World Cup finals, at the Champ de Mars below the Eiffel Tower in Paris during France '98, and in Yokohama, Japan during the 2002 tournament. They also played in other cities around the world, usually performing in stadiums or other large outdoor venues. Sometimes such concerts were held to mark specific events, such as the reopening of the thermal baths in the city of Bath, United Kingdom, after an interruption of some thirty years.
The concerts were a great commercial success, and were accompanied by a series of best-selling recordings, including Carreras - Domingo - Pavarotti: the Three Tenors in Concert (which holds the Guinness World Record for the best selling classical album), The Three Tenors In Concert 1996, The Three Tenors: Paris 1998, The Three Tenors Christmas, and The Best of the Three Tenors. Zubin Mehta conducted the performances in 1990 and 1994; the Paris concert was conducted by James Levine.
The Three Tenors' repertoire extended beyond opera to Broadway numbers and even pop hits. Their signature songs included Nessun Dorma from Puccini's Turandot and the Italian ballad standard O Sole Mio.
