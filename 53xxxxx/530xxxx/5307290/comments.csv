,sergei_bar,2010-02-19T18:36Z,"I downloaded it and felt sorry because:
- audio and video are not synchronized after rewinding on NMT player - something is wrong with the movie.
- This is first time I see HD movie coded with XviD! Why not x264 like all others??

Dont waste your time unless you dont care."
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2010-02-22T14:29Z," sorry sergei_bar:

1.] TRY AGAIN[there are plenty of videoplayers that play correct ...and in sync A/V this movie]

2.] Why? ...JUST BECAUSE....

See VISION releases....or FLAWL3SS.....SOME OF THEM ARE HD MOVIES CODED AS Xvid....

If you don't like my work...try someplace else !!

Cheers at your's  search !!![sergei_bar=sort of web search=never completed and documented]

3.] BEWARE: YOU MIGHT WASTE YOUR TIME NEVER FINISHING A JOB

4.] Try to remember:  think twice [and verify] before you accuse someone"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2010-02-25T15:30Z,"@sergei_bar:

it might be a codecs conflict !!! try and play this movie with the same player on another PC with differrent codecs prepared !!!!

I ussualy use K-lite Mega Codecs Pack but if you want something simple and you don't know how try ACE MegaCodecs Pack 6.xx and from dashboard choose the minimal one or just play"
