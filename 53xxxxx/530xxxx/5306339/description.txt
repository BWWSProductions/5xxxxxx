By far, one of the best remix compilatons of all time, 8-bit creator YMCK remixes popular songs for the Nintendo DSi download PiCTOBiTS (or PiCTOPiCT). All songs are remixes in their expanded format (hence the "+") and are direct rips with tags.

However, some tags/names here are possibly incorrect. They are labeled with a (?). Please supply me with a more accurate label and I'll credit you.

Currently, the songs are (in order):

- Main Theme of PiCTOBiTS
- Overworld Theme (SMB)
- Underworld Theme (SMB)
- Balloon Fight Theme
- Ice Climber Title Screen(?)
- Ice Climber Main Theme(?)
- Wrecking Crew Medley(?)
- Baseball Theme
- Excitebike Theme
- Devil World - Scrolling Madness(?)
- Devil World - Trekking Further(?)
- LoZ Main Theme
- LoZ Final Dungeon Theme(?)
- Underwater Theme (SMB)
- Bowser's Lair Theme (SMB)
- SMB End Theme
- PiCTOBiTS End Credits Theme

This should be good enough.
