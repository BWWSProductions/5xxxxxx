,slashtom,2010-02-28T22:06Z,thank you very much for the upload but how do I use this program? I know you wrote it down here but I don't understand how to do what you wrote here: .dll to host vst folder ? Do i drag this to my computer or install it in a map or something like that? And the native instruments do I have to copy that to my documents on my computer? I looked at the soundonsound website but can't seem to find what you mean. Please help me cause I'm not to good at this. grtz
