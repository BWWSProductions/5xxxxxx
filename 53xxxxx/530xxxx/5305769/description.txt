Description: Tile World is a reimplementation of the game "Chip's Challenge", made up of both intellectually engaging puzzles and situations demanding fast reflexes. The player controls Chip, navigating him through his challenges. The object of each level of the game is to find and reach the exit tile, which takes you to the next level. The levels contain many different kinds of obstacles, creatures both hostile and indifferent, tools, protective gear -- and, of course, chips. Tile World is named after the original working title for Chip's Challenge.

Originally developed for the Atari Lynx, Chip's Challenge was later ported by Microsoft. Because the version that Microsoft released introduced a number of changes to the rules of the game, Tile World is capable of emulating either the MS version or the original Atari Lynx version of the game.

Like DOSBox and ScummVM, Tile World uses SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and will run on many different platforms, processor architectures, and operating systems. This includes Microsoft Windows (NT, 95/98, XP, Vista, 7), Linux, Mac OS X, and BSD.

This ppGames release includes the Original "Chip's Challenge" level set, and the fan-assembled unofficial sequel "Chip's Challenge Level Pack 2" (http://www.telusplanet.net/public/nfield/ChipChallenge/CCLP2.html).
