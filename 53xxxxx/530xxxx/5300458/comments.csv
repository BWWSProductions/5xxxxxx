Ron Paul, don't tread on me, live free or die, end the fed, protect the constitution... it's hard right, not left. They started the Tea Parties, for God's sake!

This is the first time I've heard deceit from Glenn. I'm not impressed... if he wants to bash someone, he should use facts and not the leftist strategy of smearing. There are plenty of avenues to take with truthers, but calling them leftists is idiotic.

Ever since Van Jones was found to be a ""truther"" Glenn has firmly attached it to the left. Van Jones wasn't a truther, he was just anti-Bush. That's the only reason he signed the petition, and Glenn knows it. Even if he is a truther... 99% of them are LIBERTARIANS! Why use ONE example to label them all?

What a load of crap. I think he needs to remind himself that ""the truth shall set you free"".

Thanks for the upload, as always."
[T],Quazza,2010-01-23T02:43Z,"While I agree...for Glenn to allow himself to entertain the idea of 9/11 truthers to be people who are actually credible, would damage his own credibility after the whole Van Jones thing.

The point of him showing that Van Jones had signed the petition was not to attribute it to the left, but to say:

""How did a truther get into that kind of position without anyone taking notice to that fact? Wouldn't it be in the best interest of the government to not allow someone who would had motives to expose the 9/11 conspiracy into a position of power where they could know the truth?""

9/11 truthers being leftists...while I disagree...could be based on the fact that it would ""show bush was a liar""?

BTW...libertarians are neither left nor right, though they do tend to usually lean to conservative principals."
,BarrySoetoro,2010-01-24T12:06Z,"I'm not asking Glenn to entertain any ideas about truthers... although he already went there with the FEMA camp thing. Either way, the fact remains; he calls them ""leftists"". He's done it several times now. It's not just in his commentary about Van Jones. He of all people should know better than to beat around the bush. You should either take it head-on, or leave it alone.

You're right, I shouldn't have used the term ""hard right"" but it's a lot closer to the truth than calling them leftist.

I've been listening to Alex Jones' show before Glenn's the last couple of weeks to see if this ""leftist"" radio shows Glenn won't name is it. It sure is... there's an on-air argument going back and forth between Alex and Glenn. 

Glenn is calling him leftist purely for the insult value. It's discrediting him in my books. He's being inaccurate and dishonest for emotional reasons... he needs to knock it off."
