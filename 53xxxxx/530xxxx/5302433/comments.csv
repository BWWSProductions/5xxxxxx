[V],twentyforty,2010-01-23T20:32Z,"@lilars: Good call. Stick with FF but also use IE for some sites. For FF get extensions (plug-ins, of all sorts and colors) especially Add Block Plus and No-Script (click on Tools > Extensions what should get you on Extensions home-page, then pick your poison when you get there)."
