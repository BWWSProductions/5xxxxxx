FaeGiN, if you want to know the truth, watch ""A Case for A Creator"". It documents the creationism vs. evolution debate fairly well, and proves its points with logic and common sense rather than ""the bible said so"". If you want a logical basis for your beliefs, whether you think there's a God or not, you'll find it there."
