Winnie the Pooh needs you! How can he throw a party without honey?
Play as Tigger and bounce, jump, and fly around the Hundred Acre Wood
in search of Pooh's "most favourite" snack. Along the journey there'll
be plenty of challenges- blustery blowing leaves to ride, icy terrain,
falling boulders, menacing bees, pesky bats and more. Earn Tigger's
bonus jumps to explore special areas.
