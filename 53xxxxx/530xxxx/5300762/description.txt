        Heroes Rise. Empires Fall.  Legends Endure. One Warrior  Ruled
        The Sky

        Witness  the inspirational  story of  one of  the most  feared
        legends of the sky.

        Baron Manfred Von Richthofen is the most feared and celebrated
        pilot of the German Air Force  in World War I. To him  and his
        companions, air combats are events of sporty nature, technical
        challenge and honourable acting, ignoring the terrible  extent
        of war. But after falling in love with the nurse Kate, Manfred
        realises he is only used for propaganda means. Caught  between
        his  disgust  for  the war,  and  the  responsibility for  his
        fighter wing, Von Richthofen sets out to fly again.
