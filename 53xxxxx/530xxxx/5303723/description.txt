"Transform your real-world photo into an animated nature scene by adding a wide array of water, weather and sound effects to your own photos and images"

 

Make photo live

A photo restricts your excitement from holidays spent at the seaside or near a waterfall to flat, two-dimensional images. Nature Illusion Studio lets you go beyond these physical restrictions and make a self-made animated scene, which can bring the original spirit and excitement of the holiday back to life.

 

Realistic natural effects

All visual effects have been recreated with accurate physics, so ripples on the water or subtle movements of the air look and behave just like they might in the physical life.

Share to others

The best thing is that you can share your excitement with others. You can create a screensaver and present it as a gift to your beloved or friend, publish it on your website and let your guests or customers download it for free.
	

An important benefit of Nature Illusion Studio is the option to share the exciting and happy moment in the more realistic manner as opposed to the traditional two dimensional photos

Superb result

The end result is a superbly lifelike and atmospheric presentation that can be saved as a screensaver, a standalone executable, an AVI or animated GIF file and distributed to other people, who can admire your creation.
