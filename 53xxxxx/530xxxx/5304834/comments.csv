,mick_leeds2003,2010-01-25T02:15Z,"I have to log off now, but will seed again over the next few days.  A lot of people are at about 65%, so it shouldn't take long to get more seeders.

It's worth waiting for!"
,mick_leeds2003,2010-01-25T18:56Z,There's 45 seeders now so I'll stop seeding and do something else with my bandwidth!
