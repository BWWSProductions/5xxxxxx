,blackswag25,2010-04-25T10:45Z,"downloaded and seeded it..works perfect..anyone needing to translate from russian to english must download and install english ISO of crysis..once installed open folders to both crysis maximum AND crytek folder..search both for a file that says ""Game"" and the click the folder that says ""Localization"" there are three files that need to be copied from the ""Crytek"" folder over to the ""Maximum Crysis one"" those files are named ""Russian.lng"" and ""Russian.pak"" and also make sure to copy over the file that says ""Default.lng"" otherwise the menu will not show up and u wont be able to play the game. Once all three files are copied to the ""maximum crysis"" folder simply run the game and you'll see english menus and hear all the dialogue in english too. Any questons hit me up"

@Gloogloos

I'll make what blackswag25 said more understandable

You need to download another version of Crysis, Crysis Warhead, or Crysis Wars that is in english or has english as one of the languages and copy and/or replace/add to the existing Russian files in this one.

If you are able to find the files online somewhere and download them then you can just use those.

Installation
Go to the location of the game that you selected during install.  (Both of the seperate ones)

Ex. C:\Program Files (x86)\Maximum Crysis\Crysis

Open the ""Game"" folder in both of them.

Ex. C:\Program Files (x86)\Maximum Crysis\Crysis\Game

Then open the ""Localized"" folder contained within the ""Game"" folder in both of them

Ex. C:\Program Files (x86)\Maximum Crysis\Crysis\Game\Localized

Replace or add the language files with the ones from the English Crysis that you installed to the Maximum Edition one.

""Default.ing""
""English.ing""
""english.pak""

REMINDER: This is applicable to Crysis, Crysis Warhead, and Crysis Wars.


BTW I tried to upload the files for download but it just didn't work."
