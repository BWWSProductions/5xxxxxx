,Nintynuts,2010-03-15T01:54Z,"If you could make a pack of all the movies in a mpeg4 codec, with decent audio (either DTS or AC3) inside a mkv container at original resolution, that would be awesome.

All the current movie packs have crappy TV rips or badly encoded files (for example one has 32 kbps audio and sounds terrible, one is the wrong aspect ratio and most are standard rather than widescreen)

I'm not bothered about non-english audio tracks or commentaries, but if u include them in an mkv, they're easily removed.

I hope u can make us proud!"
,Impul5se,2010-03-31T13:02Z,@Nintynuts: Do you know any good programs for Macs to rip dvds into different formats? I'll start ripping them ASAP if you do. I was trying to keep with file formats that are PS3 compatible because I play a lot of my movies through there.
