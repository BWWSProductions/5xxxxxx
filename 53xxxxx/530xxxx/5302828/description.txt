The Official jPOS' Documentation

Whether you're new to jPOS, you're evaluating it for your next project, or you are already running it in production, jPOS Programmer's Guide is probably a must-read and the key to your success.

It has over 160 pages that cover the most important jPOS components, including recently developed components such as Q2, the Spaces, the UI framework and the TransactionManager.

The guide is delivered in PDF format and is part of the program to support jPOS.org, maintain the website and further developments.
