This is my collection of music by Antonio Vivaldi, volume 8 of 9.

Vol.8 contains viola d'Amore concertos, violin sonatas and various transcriptions.

Complete list of volumes can be found on my user page. They contain:

Vol.1 - Bassoon, cameral and cello concertos, cello sonatas and archive with covers, booklets, etc.
Vol.2 - Strings, flute, lute, oboe and organ concertos, flute sonatas, strings symphonies and a set of compositions for various instruments.
Vol.3 - Operas (part 1/3).
Vol.4 - Operas (part 2/3).
Vol.5 - Operas (part 3/3).
Vol.6 - Sacred compositions (part 1/2).
Vol.7 - Sacred compositions (part 2/2).
Vol.8 - Viola d'Amore concertos, violin sonatas and various transcriptions.
Vol.9 - Violin concertos.

The compositions are sorted by type, opus and RV number, and some are in more than one version. To make things more complicated, sometimes particular movements are taken from different performances in order to make the whole composition sound "as it should" according to my personal preferences. I included also some covers and booklets from part of the CDs I used to create this compilation. I hope you like it :) Have fun, enjoy and seed!
