,farphignougen,2010-01-24T12:54Z,There are so many pre-rendered (not in-engine) cutscenes in this game that downgrading them to half quality cut the game's total filesize by 67%?

,sylh,2010-01-26T01:06Z,"the speed is going pretty decently now

the good thing is that everyones gonna finish at the same time, and it will be a huge burst of seedage. unless we leave and let the torrent die :("

@Dakrua, if you have this and you aren't seeding you should die"
,Dakrua,2010-01-26T06:52Z,"hehe no worries seeding set to unlimited :P
still it only does 90kbs -.- but its better then nothing :P

But even if you have the game you can't play it probably most other tptb peoples can't get it to work either.

,Unit431,2010-01-27T11:41Z,"Same problem....

The mission is ""The Convict"", where you have to travel to a prison ship. It crashes every time you approach the bend in the first corridor. Probably the same problem (corrupt data) that caused the previously fixed crash during character selection."

,nitesamba,2010-01-27T13:26Z,"is it just me or is the dialog audio really hollow and low sounding?
i have globe's version also and the dialog is very hard to hear"
,Unit431,2010-01-27T13:45Z,"That's because that globe guy downgraded the audio quality of the voice over files but forgot to mention it on his torrent -- and that's why I always stick with TPTB's torrents, because they don't pull that shit. Video quality downgrading I can handle because it's barely noticeable -- shitty sounding audio in a game that has a metric fuckton of voice overs? I think not."
,kalpeshvirekar,2010-01-27T14:01Z,"Same problem here....at the level where the ""convict"" needs to be recruited the game crashes after crossing the first block..please release a fix for this and all the possible crashes caused due to data corruption"

,Unit431,2010-01-27T14:46Z,"Cool, that was quick. Much appreciated.

Chinitow, if you're talking about the first fix (Mass Fix.zip), you don't put it in BioGame, you extract the files to the base Mass Effect 2 directory. eg, c:\games\Mass Effect 2\

Then you run RunFix.bat in the base directory.

If you're talking about the second fix just posted, all you have to do is extract the files to Mass Effect 2\BioGame\CookedPC\"

,Moxy39,2010-01-27T22:51Z,WoW Shroo. Thats some compression :) Is anything missing or was there a load of crap in the 14gb version that could be removed? I was a little confused when I installed the 14gb version because when installed it was only taking 12.1gb with all DLC installed. Pretty strange because usually its the opposite and larger than the disk(s) image.
,Chinitow,2010-01-27T23:04Z,it workbut wh i clc on new game andi chose my sex (male/female) it says that there are missing files

,Sconterboy,2010-01-27T23:30Z,"extracted the fix torrent and its still crashing when i try to choose male or female character...anyone else having this problem too?? 

Anyone know how to fix it????

Thanks

,Sconterboy,2010-01-27T23:43Z,"over 2 and a 1/2 days DL cause people wont seed...just for the game not to work for me...ah well maybe try a non ripped version...I have more then the min specs in fact i have much more than the recommended specs.

Still thanks again shroo and TPTB

Sconter."
,Unit431,2010-01-27T23:51Z,"The game works. If it's still crashing on the character select screen, then the fault lies with you.

I'll spell it out clearly :

1) Download Mass Fix.zip : 4shared(.)com/file/207717850/f1623254

2) Place the files from Mass Fix.zip in Mass Effect 2's base directory. If you don't know what this is, it's the directory with ME2's .exe file.

3) Run RunFIX.bat. If RunFIX.bat, Arc.exe and Fix.arc (all from Mass Fix.zip) aren't in the same directory as MassEffect2Launcher.exe, then you're doing it wrong.

4) Download this : 4shared(.)com/file/208773253/9396f426

5) Extract the files to ME2's CookedPC directory (\Mass Effect 2\BioGame\CookedPC). Overwrite the files when prompted.

That's it. The game will NOT crash on the male/female selection prompt if you follow those directions to the letter."
,Sconterboy,2010-01-28T01:18Z,"Hey, got it sorted thanx. To cut a long story short im a bit of a tool!! I did paste it over but pasted it in the wrong directory...wondered why it didnt ask me to overwrite any but anyways got it sorted...my only beef now is with the game not having control pad support but hey just have to deal with it!!!

Thanks though Unit431 for replying, perfect intsructions.

Did not face any issues with the Mordin mission either.

Ok this game is so awesome, even noobs should play this. So here goes:

Noob special instructions:

Step1: Download and install the latest winrar software (use google whenever you need help)

Step2: Extract the contents of PC_Mass.Effect.2.Multi-6.Rip.-TPTB to a drive with at-least 12 gb free space (maybe 

higher)

Step3: Go to the extracted folder and run ""Setup.bat"" (Vista,W7... use admin login)

Step4: At 99% wait and install all the support tools (like directx, games for windows live, etc)

Step5: Extract the 3 files of PC_Mass.Effect.2.FINAL-FIXRip.-TPTB (uploaded by Shroo) to the folder where you ran 

setup.bat (the three files should be in here and not inside a sub folder)

Step6: Run ""RunFIX.bat""

Step7: Go to Start > Run and type regedit (Vista and W7, just type regedit in the search bar in start menu)

Step8: Click File > Import 

Step9: Go to the folder where you ran setup.bat and choose the regsetup.txt and click ok/yes (if the txt file is not displayed choose ""All Files"" where it now says (*.reg)
