Here is the entire contents:

1
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,460
This dam project
will create many newjobs.

2
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,960
The Party and country
will assist in your relocation.

3
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,170
Grandma, give me your hand.

4
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,050
- But where are they taking us?
- It'll be all right.

5
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,520
Brother!

6
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,350
Grandma, I will send you money.

7
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,650
Who can write?

8
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,820
Who can read?

9
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,410
Who can weld?

10
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,810
I put a lot of faith
into your organization.

11
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,400
It's a perfect replica, Roland.

12
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,110
There are too many fanatics out there
that could damage her.

13
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,660
Just think about the beautiful Buddha
statues they blew up in Afghanistan.

14
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,790
Our Heritage Organization
has already made selections...

15
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,790
...from the British Museum
and L'Hermitage.

16
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,140
I guess she'll be safe now,
tucked away...

17
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,520
...hidden in some bunker
in Switzerland.

18
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Perfectly safe, Roland.

19
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,190
Only infrared analysis
would reveal the difference.

20
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,610
But it's still a fake.

21
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,580
Laura.

22
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,750
Laura, can you hear me?

23
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,630
Roland, is that you?

24
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,750
Laura, they lied to us.

25
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,170
I've arranged a press conference
for tomorrow.

26
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,760
I will tell everyone the truth
about what's going on.

27
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,430
What are you talking about?

28
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,140
The art you collected...

29
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,560
...it's not in the Alps.

30
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,100
Those tunnels are empty.

31
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,350
I have proof!

32
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,270
Laura.

33
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,600
Laura, can you hear me?

34
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,360
-I'm losing you. Roland?
-Laura, can you hear me?

35
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,610
Laura.

36
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,260
I feared you would not come.

37
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,440
Zultan, listen to me...

38
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,610
...we are fighters,
we never go down...

39
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,530
...no matter how hard they hit us.

40
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,280
Kill the bastard.

41
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,660
Yuri, where are you going?

42
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,290
Yuri?!

43
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:24,340
Do not believe in something simply
because you have heard it, Nima.

44
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:28,220
But, great Lama,
Tenzin is my brother.

45
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:32,220
He works inside the big tunnel,
where the ships are built.

46
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:39,770
But what is there in your wisdom,
great Lama, if Tenzin is right?

47
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,820
What if our world
is indeed coming to an end?

48
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:56,210
it is full, great Rinpoche.

49
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,050
Like this cup...

50
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:07,720
...you are full of opinions
and speculations.

51
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,390
To see the light of wisdom...

52
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:14,600
...you first must empty your cup.

53
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,740
Be careful with the clutch.

54
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,580
it tends to slip.

55
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:57,940
- Grandma.
- Grandpa, Nima is here!

56
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,270
Grandma,
I got a message from Tenzin.

57
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:03,440
He wants us to meet him
in Cho Ming at the west gate.

58
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:07,110
He says he can get us on the ships
he's working on.

59
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:11,370
What are you talking about?
Tenzin works on the dam.

60
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,290
Grandma...

61
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:20,250
...the dam is a ship!
The government lied to us.

62
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,670
There will be a big flood!

63
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,800
We must pack up right away.

64
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:27,720
Nima, he gave you the truck?

65
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:31,640
We took a trip
on the Laem Song ferry once.

66
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,850
Grandpa threw up the whole way.

67
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,640
Let's eat first.

68
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,760
Who are they?

69
01:55:31,930 --> 01:55:33,640
We found them along side
of the road.

70
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:35,350
Send them back!

71
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:43,400
I am a follower...

72
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:46,020
...of our great Lama Rinpoche.

73
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:48,230
You know I cannot do that.

74
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:29,650
We are all children of the earth.

75
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:33,320
My plan will not work for so many,
Grandma.

76
01:56:33,490 --> 01:56:37,410
We will take them all.

77
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:34,920
We have to hurry!

78
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:36,760
They are leaving!

79
01:57:55,820 --> 01:57:56,820
Tenzin wait!

80
01:57:58,410 --> 01:58:00,410
Grandma, we're almost there.

81
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:36,400
Mr. President.

82
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:38,450
You've got to see this.

83
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:51,980
Down there Oleg, you go first!

84
02:10:59,100 --> 02:11:00,980
Tenzin, almost there.

85
02:11:02,110 --> 02:11:03,650
Nima, what happened?

86
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:20,460
Grandma, Grandpa.

87
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:22,590
I'm sorry.

88
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:26,880
-I could not save us.
-He has gone back in. He will fix it.

89
02:18:28,210 --> 02:18:30,500
There's no way.

90
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:33,720
Don't lose your faith, brother.
