The packed houses, the roaring crowds - it's all part of being an international superstar, and Alvin & the Chipmunks need your help to get there! Play as the Chipmunks or the Chipettes and turn either trio into a group of superstars in this music game. Choose your favorite songs from the Chipmunks library and help them keep the beat. Play in 25 locations, break attendance records, and unite both groups for a show-stopping finale. Make it a true trio in Multiplayer Party Mode. And, when you're done playing the star, sit back and enjoy the show in Jukebox Mode, which lets you watch videos of your favorite unlocked songs.
