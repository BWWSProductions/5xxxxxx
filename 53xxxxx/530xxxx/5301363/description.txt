SzomorÃº vasÃ¡rnap

SzomorÃº vasÃ¡rnap
szÃ¡z fehÃ©r virÃ¡ggal
vÃ¡rtalak kedvesem
templomi imÃ¡val.
Ãlmokat kergetÅ‘
vasÃ¡rnap dÃ©lelÅ‘tt,
bÃ¡natom hintaja
nÃ©lkÃ¼led visszajÃ¶tt.
AzÃ³ta szomorÃº
mindig a vasÃ¡rnap,
kÃ¶nny csak az italom,
kenyerem a bÃ¡nat.
SzomorÃº vasÃ¡rnap.

UtolsÃ³ vasÃ¡rnap
kedvesem gyere el,
pap is lesz, koporsÃ³,
ravatal, gyÃ¡szlepel.
Akkor is virÃ¡g vÃ¡r,
virÃ¡g Ã©s - koporsÃ³.
VirÃ¡gos fÃ¡k alatt
utam az utolsÃ³.
Nyitva lesz szemem, hogy
mÃ©g egyszer lÃ¡ssalak.
Ne fÃ©j a szememtÅ‘l,
holtan is Ã¡ldalak...
UtolsÃ³ vasÃ¡rnap.

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy sunday,
with hundred white flowers
in the chapel, beloved one,
I waited in prayer.
That sunday morning,
my dreams were chasing.
Yet the chariot of my sorrow
came back without you. 
Forever since then are
so sad all my sundays -
tears are my drink, and
the bread I eat sorrow.
Gloomy Sunday.

On my last Sunday, belovÃ©d,
oh come to me!
There'll be a priest too,
a coffin, a catafalque, a shroud.
Also then, flowers will await you,
flowers - and a coffin.
Beneath flowering trees, I will
take my last ride.
And my eyes open wide
for a last glance upon you.
Don't be scared of my eyes,
still in death I will bless you...
Last Sunday.

Gloomy Sunday

Sadly one Sunday
I waited and waited
With flowers in my arms
All the dream has created
I waited 'til dreams,
Like my heart, were all broken
The flowers were all dead
And the words were unspoken
The grief that I know 
Was beyond all consoling
The beat of my heart
Was a bell that was tolling
Saddest of Sundays

Then came a Sunday
When you came to find me
They bore me to church
And I left you behind me
My eyes could not see 
What I wanted to love me
The earth and the flowers
Are forever above me
The bell tolled for me
And the wind whispered "Never!"
But you I have loved
And I'll bless you forever
Last of all Sundays

(Diamanda Galas' Version)
