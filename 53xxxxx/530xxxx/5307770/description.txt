Marathi cinema is experiencing a revolution of sorts. It is steadily shifting from the cheap-comedies to the more sensible kind of cinema. Natarang is the story of Guna- the â€˜nachyaâ€™ in the folk culture of â€˜tamashaâ€™. It is an impressive tale of what a â€˜nachyaâ€™, a female imposter in the â€˜tamashaâ€™, has to undergo. It is based on a book by the same name written by Dr. Anand Yadav, Marathi litterateur and President of this yearâ€™s Marathi Sahitya Sammelan. Having not read the book, I canâ€™t really comment on how the movie fares compared to the acclaimed book. If looked at in isolation it does a fairly decent job.
