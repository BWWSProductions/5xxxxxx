                    Prequel to classic sitcom Only Fools and  
                    Horses, set in 1960. In Peckham, the Trotters  
                    are all under one roof: Grandad, Joan, husband  
                    Reg and the teenage Del Boy. Things suddenly  
                    change, however, when ex-con Freddie Robdal  
                    appears. Joining this comedy drama are teenage  
                    versions of Only Fools and Horses favourites  
                    Boycie, Trigger and Denzil.
