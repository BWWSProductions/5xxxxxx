Credit and Thanks to taygetar for the files.

Knife novices and blade craftsmen can all agree that BLADE Magazine is the place to find the latest and best knife news
Every page of each issue from 1997- 2008, just as they appeared in the original printed version.
 Revisit all the great articles and pictures that have inspired and will continue to inspire, blade lovers for generation 

The pdfs have been bookmarked so scanning in a particular YEAR is fairly easy.
There is no master table of contents, so you will have to find the year you want and view it. 
Sadly, there is also no index, which would really have been very useful. 

It is certainly handier than a 4 foot tall stack of magazines, and a great way to have copies of years/issues you may have missed.
