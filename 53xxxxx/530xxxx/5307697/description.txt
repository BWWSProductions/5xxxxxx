Benjamin Esposito (Darin) is a recently retired man who has spent his life as a criminal court investigator and decides to try his hand at writing a novel based on an old case from 1974 in which a beautiful woman was brutally raped and beaten to death. The case has haunted him for 25 years. At the time, he, his boss Irene (Villamil) and junior Sandoval (Francella) quickly identified that the killer must be an old friend of the victim who had always harboured a sinister crush on her.
