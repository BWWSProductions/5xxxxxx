"Criminal" is a 1996 piano rock song by Fiona Apple. Apple described the song as a description of "feeling bad for getting something so easily by using your sexuality." It was released as the third single from the album Tidal in September 1997, and is widely considered Apple's breakout hit, peaking at #21 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as #4 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song won the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 40th Grammy Awards and was nominated for Best Rock Song. The song was listed at number seventy-one on Blender magazine's 2005 list of "The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born".

The song's music video was directed by Mark Romanek. The video features Apple sulking in various states of undress, and The New Yorker described her as "looking like an underfed Calvin Klein model." It explores themes of voyeurism and adolescence. In 1998, the video won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography.

Tidal is the debut album by American singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, released by Epic Records in the United States on July 23, 1996. It peaked at number fifteen on the U.S. Billboard 200 and as of October 2005 had sold 2.7 mill copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. It was certified gold by the RIAA in December 1996, platinum in July 1997, two times platinum the following October and three times platinum in April 1999.

Tidal produced six singles: "Shadowboxer", "Slow Like Honey", "Sleep to Dream", "The First Taste", "Criminal" and "Never Is a Promise". "Criminal", the album's most popular single, won a 1998 Grammy Award for "Best Female Rock Vocal Performance" and was named the single of 1997 in a poll of Rolling Stone readers. The music video for "The First Taste" never aired in the U.S.

The 2005 album I've Got My Own Hell to Raise by Bettye Lavette is titled after a lyric in "Sleep to Dream", and includes a cover of that song.

In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named Tidal the 20th Best Album of the last 25 years (1983-2008).
