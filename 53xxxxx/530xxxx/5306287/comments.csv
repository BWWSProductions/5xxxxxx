Will seed for as long as possible.

,mattyg05,2010-04-25T18:38Z,"Before I d/l it, can anyone tell me if Ponyo, on the cliff, by the sea is a different film. I am guessing it is, but am not 100% certain.
I suppose someone will slag me off for asking such a silly question."
,enhbat,2010-05-13T08:10Z,Any english subtitle for this release?
,seraph1m,2010-06-07T15:15Z,gake no ue no ponyo is the japanese title which translates as ponyo on the cliff by the sea which is the australian title of the same film
,anon4456,2010-07-25T22:40Z,wow i thought u guys were lying (or the same person) but it really is 10/10

,bryony1401,2010-08-19T16:49Z,"I'm having trouble watching all the movies i download, i use windows media player and itunes, but neither of these will play the file? they only play the audio, not the picture. how do i get it to play the movie?!"
,pearlz,2010-08-24T05:16Z,"DO NOT D/L VIRUS ALL THROUGH THE TORRENT!!! I am QUITE sure it was this one (remember it by all the ""kids loved it"" comments). BankerFox.A and Win32/Nuqel.E all through it. Had to wipe the entire computer."
,dgriarte,2010-09-09T04:11Z,Thank you very much for this wonderful torrent! 10/10!
,max_planck_no_1,2011-04-12T12:16Z,"Guys, this is the Hayao Miyazaki film in case you dont know. The quality of the torrent is pretty good. Its only slightly, very slightly, pixelated. But the sound and english dub is great. 

For watching this movie, this is probably the best torrent. But its still not 100% DVD or high-res. "
,Xeginy,2011-08-07T19:57Z,"Great download, thanks!!"
,Kepler101,2012-02-07T09:07Z,"Thank you for this great upload. I like these types of films and I ain't gonna lie and say ""My kids/children love it!"" But that I actually want to watch it lol.

Quality is good 10/10.

Also @pearlz You cannot get a virus from an AVI File, So you must be mistaken. 
.AVI is not a Windows Executable file type therefore impossible for it to give you a virus."
,Heavytoe53,2012-04-28T01:21Z,I really like Miyazaki's work!
,MIGUELbM,2012-05-18T05:11Z,"@superainbowprincesslol are you dumb? bigger file means lower compression, it does not mean higher resolution, you can easily see 720p films that are 4 Gb and 1080p films that are 3 Gb"
,tylerawesome,2012-07-18T02:56Z,great upload. thx :)
