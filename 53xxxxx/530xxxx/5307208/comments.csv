,theeboredone,2010-01-27T05:03Z,"So I downloaded this, and burned it on 4x using Imgburn like I do with every other game. I was using Neogamma R7 Rev 14, but it gave me the ""error 001: unauthorized device"". I tried upgrading to R8 Rev 17, but got the same stuff. Someone let me know what kinda loader they are using to play this game soon."
