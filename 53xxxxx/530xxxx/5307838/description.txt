Season 6, Episode 17: Happy Jack
Original Air Dateâ€”24 March 2004
When Eric is caught by Donna tending to his 'manly needs' in the Pinciotti bathroom, everyone acts as if it was an ax-murder: Jackie sees it as blackmail material to 'milk' for life, the others brand the boy as a weak pervert. Hyde and Fez regret having to miss how Eric will as always make this one 'even worse', but still go visit Kelso at the police academy, where the cadet has adopted the burly house style, grown the trade-mark mustache and adopted the cop name Mike. After he dutifully flushed weed criminal Hyde's contraband stash, the pair treacherously shaves him a Hitler-mustache...

Donna decides it's time for the next wedding preparations: choosing a wedding list, to the boys' anger only 'things at the table', nothing they like, and Eric is a wreck after a six hours shopping raid, so eager to take Red's advice: choose so badly she'll declare him shop-incompetent and do it all herself. Alas veteran Kelso gives the game away at first glance, so as punishment Eric must go shop wedding cloths with Jackie, who surprisingly knows how to handle a male shopping-stooge. Meanwhile Kitty and Fez catch Red enjoying reading one of her dirty girls books...

Season 6, Episode 20: Squeeze Box
Original Air Dateâ€”28 April 2004
Pam Burkhart moves back in with Bob Pinciotti, eagerly helped by the boys, especially horny admirers Kelso and Fez, but it's Red and Hyde who see her accidentally (but also on her part?) bare-breasted. A visit to the movie theater makes Donna admit to herself she's as horny for him as the other way around, forget pre-marital abstinence, but then he gets suspiciously greeted by a vending girl, and Mitch, who is back in the basement, hotly hoping to get Donna for himself against everyone's warnings he stands no chance ever, eagerly stirs...

Season 6, Episode 21: 5:15
Original Air Dateâ€”5 May 2004
Precisely because Eric 'forbids' Donna to be Mitch's date at his brother's wedding, she accepts; it's in the Holiday hotel where Eric takes that shift so he can watch and bug his rival; Jackie and Fez come as chaperons, she gives him 'tips' to court a country-club bitch just like her. Kitty convinces Kelso not to take pregnant Broke to a roller-coaster and horse-riding but to her baby-care-class in hospital; Brooke panics when her practical skills fall short of her book-knowledge, but Michael's babysitting experience compensates. Red has got cable TV to compensate for failing conversation with Kitty, but deliberately refused a connection for the basement; Hyde taps into it himself, but has no control over the (weather) channel choice. Mitch proclaims Donna his hot fiancÃ©, leading to a public fight with Eric neither really wants.
