Plot:
The four girls are all very sweet and likeable, but life has not treated them well, and their own attempts to achieve happiness are surely misguided. Their friendship with each other is the one thing they have that they can really depend on in life, and together they try to get by in the world the best they can. Either that or escape it for a while with drugs.
