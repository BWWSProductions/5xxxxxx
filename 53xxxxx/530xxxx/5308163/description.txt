It was a beautiful spring day in downtown San Francisco before a gigantic armored alien appeared from out of nowhere and began smashing things all to hell!  Who is this invader?  Why is he being attacked by strange alien beings?  And why is he so Gigantic?  A twist on The Truman Show, Gigantic focuses on a brainwashed alien superhero deposited on Earth to be the spotlight of an intrusive, around-the-clock television program being filmed without his knowledge.

Written by the critically acclaimed Rick Remender (Fear Agent, The End League) and illustrated by groundbreaking artist Eric Nguyen (X-Men, Sandman).
