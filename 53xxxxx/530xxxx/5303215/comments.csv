If you stupid little fucks want to actually get your shithole simpsons and whatnot in a timely manner remember that it TAKES PEOPLE SEEDING IN THE FIRST PLACE. Do your part you little assholes.

Quite frankly I (and many others) are about done with EZTV's torrents if you lazy fucks can't do the honorable thing and at least seed till 1.0 ratio, normally I seed this stuff out via my work connection (over 10mb/s up when I uncap it) till at least 10.0 or so min but it's taking so long to even download small files from EZTV now due to the hordes of leechers that just hit and run that I'm really considering using private trackers exclusively and cutting all you 12 year old asshats out of the picture. If you're going to be a pirate at least share with the rest of your ship ; )"

,Willspirate,2010-01-24T21:22Z,"Thanks for another upload eztv! 

amikron quite frankly ... Good riddance to you and to the others that come to a pirate site and curse like some teenage wannabe street thug. You're dismissed child; go to your room."
,honunet,2010-01-25T09:43Z,"Amikron, are we missing something? Could you please explain to us the devestating afffect you would have on our lives if you no longer Dl'ed EZ's torrents?  Please explain it to me like I am 5.  Make me care if you and your band of angry piraters download from a ""private"" source whatever that is.. EZ thanks again"

,seleri,2010-01-27T12:41Z,"I dont mind hit and runs... thats the beauty of torrents, the more people who wants a file the faster it gets... eztv files I usually have DL in 10 min, so I cant really complain. However, sharing leaves golden spots on your heart, so do it!"
,CSuk,2010-01-31T16:36Z,"ThanX as always team!

The world is full of selfish dickheads and getting fuller with the dawning of each day :)"
,norin,2010-05-04T17:21Z,"Maybe amikron is shitting out of his mouth but he does have point. A lot of people need to learn that sharing is not only about taking but also about giving (pease and love). 
If Amikron makes his points by cursing his grandmother to her grave then he should be allowed to do so! Some people might finally get the point, for the people who do seed it is only good entertaining to read his comment, to me it is;)."
