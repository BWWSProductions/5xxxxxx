,2FnFast,2010-11-01T07:00Z,"I still don't understand the concept proposed by the name...
Racing of any form on a street is illegal...so either its a fantasy world where people can drive as fast as they want in the streets (which are concurrently occupied by cheap cars that are NOT racing), or, more probably, the company is referring to the cars themselves as being street legal. Either way, this name has always troubled me..."
,LarsRonald,2010-11-22T19:12Z,Do any1 know how to get this to work on vista? 
,AR87ACE,2010-12-06T08:48Z,"Hi all...i`ve just downloaded this torrent and it didn`t work so:
The main reason for that is because some of the cars fucked up the game!!!

So this is what u have to do:

1.Go to cars folder then in the racer folder and cut or delete all cars from there
(folders and files .rpk/but DO NOT delete the original ones focer,bayern,mc etc.)

These files/folders must remain: 
.rpk:SuperDuty,Prime,MC,Nonus,Focer,Enula,Einvagen,Duhen,Baiern.
folders: textures,Superduty_data,scripts,ROC_cars,Prime_data,Nonus_data,
meshes,MC_data,Focer_data,Enula_data,Einvagen_data,Duhen_data,Baiern_data.

2.Delete all files in save folder (empty career and temp folders)

3.Set compatibility mode to Windows XP SP2

4.Copy back into racer folder the cars u want one by one and test them out

I HOPE U GUYS UNDERSTAND WHAT I WANTED TO SAY,GOOD LUCK!!!"
