,jammingme,2012-03-18T00:48Z,"Guys, I am not going to ever upload a virus. The torrent was what I have a hard copy of and I felt the need to share it. Thank you for the warm welcome!!!! That is not to say I will not want to experiment  with virus code to learn how it works. I am just not far enough in my studies yet in computer science.. "
