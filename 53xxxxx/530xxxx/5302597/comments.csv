,Thrasy,2010-01-23T21:44Z,Are there any versions of the extended pilot? Since I'm not in the US I can't watch it on the site.
,amikron,2010-01-24T03:50Z,"Good fucking lord you people need to start seeding back, the amount of hit and running on EZTV's torrents has gotten to the level of absurdity. If you stupid little fucks want to actually get your shithole simpsons and whatnot in a timely manner remember that it TAKES PEOPLE SEEDING IN THE FIRST PLACE. Do your part you little assholes.

Quite frankly I (and many others) are about done with EZTV's torrents if you lazy fucks can't do the honorable thing and at least seed till 1.0 ratio, normally I seed this stuff out via my work connection (over 10mb/s up when I uncap it) till at least 10.0 or so min but it's taking so long to even download small files from EZTV now due to the hordes of leechers that just hit and run that I'm really considering using private trackers exclusively and cutting all you 12 year old asshats out of the picture. If you're going to be a pirate at least share with the rest of your ship ; )"
,dmwizzard0007,2010-01-24T06:37Z,"Yes, Pretty much the same as the pre-air, except this one's got LESS Boobs (Nake females) in it :) And the pre-air has less VFX."
,dadyhacks,2010-01-24T08:51Z,amikron!!!! Too true matey its getting to be a joke and same old same old all the time.....shame to see really .but then again nowadays no-ones arsed with how much they seed back....when they really should be ..few n far between ....its a fackin liberty......
,DeltaPan,2010-01-24T17:25Z,"Ooop's, too quick with a good intention.

I was wrong in interpretation of IMDB.

Both are same.
Don't watch linked first, my bad.

Apologies."
,Swordz,2010-01-24T17:34Z,"Why is it called S01E01 !? it's S01E00, the same we had last April !"
,Archangeldawn,2010-01-25T03:10Z,"DeltaPan , dmwizzard0007  said this new re-aired version has less Boobage but more VFX..so it's not entirely technically the same is it?...

I'll take more boobage vs VFX ANY day !! :)"
,XorganicX,2010-01-25T12:03Z,"I watched the pre air and it is the same as this one.
Interesting side note the one i watched a while ago had a variance in the scene where the greystone daughter is explaining to her father how ""she did it"" she states the human brain only stores 100 terabytes, when actually she stated it held only 3 megabytes in the one i saw a while ago... it is easy to tell the edited part if you think about it "
,Skillem,2010-01-25T20:10Z,Wasnt this a movie? I saw the previews for this and I know I have seen a movie exactly like it.
,arildus,2010-01-31T08:04Z,Thanx;)
,paddotrip,2010-02-08T03:03Z,"where are all the good sci fi series :(

can anyone suggest a good show for me. sci fi and prefer with many people dying.  

keep up the good work uploaders :)"
,JAGACE,2010-02-26T15:52Z,"Yea my sentiments exactly, the Pre aired version is allot better quality also, well the one i downloaded was, and indeed it seems sci fi TV shows have started to go down hill latley, even the new V tv series is a bit lame.  Thanks for the upload eztv, i would seed more but here in Australia they charge allot of cash if you use up too much data and or cap your connection to dial up speeds, i swear our country is the only one in the world that does this rubbish with ISP's connection plans. Thank you for seeding and peace out!"

,marcopolo3000,2010-10-02T10:35Z,This is the censored version right? I have the Zektorm one and it shows the boobies in the nightclub. Is this one also the same one?
