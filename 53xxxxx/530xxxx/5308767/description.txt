"Bruckner's three mature masses were written in the
1860s after his prolonged period of study with Simon Sechter.
Now in his forties, he plunged back into composition developing
his style based on the Austrian classical tradition. From this
period date the symphonies 0 and 1 as well as these
masses. Bruckner had not yet fully developed the processes
that would allow him to explore the vast, slow time-scales of
his later works. But, though the masses owe much in
their ground-plans to the masses of Mozart, Schubert and
Haydn, they also employ a principle of cyclical re-use of
material that is rather symphonic in nature. It could be
argued that these masses as well as the early symphonies
are the crucible in which Bruckner would forge his later style.
And, perhaps, this goes some way to explaining the lack of
recordings in the catalogue. For a successful conductor of
these works must not only be sympathetic to the pre-existing
masses of the classical period but must have a grasp
of Brucknerian structure. "
