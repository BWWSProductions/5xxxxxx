When you mount the .iso, then it still tells you to insert the CD, because a function in the program gets the first CD-ROM drive you have. For example, if your real CD-ROM drive is D:\ and your virtual drive is E:\, then it would still tell you to insert the CD, because D comes before E. If you change the drive letters, it will work, I've tried it, but I have provided a workaround for this. My modified ""MONOPOLY.EXE"" will make the game load the required files from your HDD.

I guess you can call it a nocd crack. Here it is:

(Can't post the link directly, TPB doesn't let me.
The link above contains the download link.)

But please follow these instructions or you won't get it to work:

1. You must mount the .iso and copy everything from the ""MONOPOLY"" folder to where you installed the game. Overwrite all folders/files.
2. Download my modified/cracked ""MONOPOLY.EXE"" from the link above.
3. Move it to the folder where you installed the game and overwrite the original ""MONOPOLY.EXE"".
4. The game should work fine now and shouldn't ask for the CD. :)
5. Enjoy. :) "
