Not madison square garden or Kew gardens but smack in the middle of James Brownâ€™s extensive catalog is a nearly forgotten release from May 1967: Live At The Garden. Like so many other live records of the era, it was overshadowed by Brownâ€™s blazing landmark album Live At The Apollo, then further eclipsed a year later by another Apollo LP. Adding to the obscurity is that, although intended to highlight Soul Brother No. 1â€™s groundbreaking ascension to headlining status at New Yorkâ€™s Madison Square Garden, the album was actually recorded over several performances at a nightclub in Cherry Hill, New Jersey 

Weâ€™ve got two hours of straight-ahead JBE: the opening instrumental set, with the boss leading his incredible orchestra from behind the organ, including 10 minutes of â€œNight Train,â€ and, for the first time, the full Star Time portion of the show - highlighted by an unedited version of â€œPapaâ€™s Got A Brand New Bag,â€ tracks left off the LP including â€œItâ€™s A Manâ€™s Manâ€™s Manâ€™s Worldâ€ and â€œCome Rain Or Come Shine,â€ and some alternate versions of what was included on the album.
The collectionâ€™s unreleased material, newly mixed from the original four-track master tapes - and sonically rescued from the venueâ€™s haphazard recording techniques - captures the raw excitement of James Brown Experience circa â€˜67, resulting in a soaring, searing revue of emerging funk and hit ballads. This Expanded Edition is also unique to all other James Brown live albums, as it features JB and band in a nightclub, not a theater or arena, with a delightfully casual pacing unheard anywhere else.
