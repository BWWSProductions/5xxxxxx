Focus On Indie Film: "Cheese Wars"

In this episode we take a look at the film "Cheese Wars" and have a chat with Taylor Pipes, the Filmmaker. The film is a 24 minute documentary that is currently available to watch for free on Vimeo.

From the film description: "As California's milk and cheese production has skyrocketed, it has changed Wisconsin's position as America's Dairyland. This documentary compares the standard dairies out west (5,000 - 10,000 cow operations milked on metal carousels) with small local farms (small herds with more pasture) in the Upper Midwest."
