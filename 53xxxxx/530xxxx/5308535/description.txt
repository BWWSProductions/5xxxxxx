'No Hope, No Future' features the single 'Under Control', which finds Good Shoes at their danceable best, with a bouncing, rocking indie dancefloorfiller about the number one suburban pastime â€“ sex. As usual, the track is super melodic and catchy, but heavier than past offerings and still with the trademark Good Shoes sound that makes them one of the most exciting and unique bands in Britain.
