,Neirbo,2010-02-15T13:12Z,do you have their other album cross the line? id love to get my hands on 'obvious to know' and 'safe to say'.
[V],piratetorrent1989,2010-02-16T07:35Z,"'Cross the Line' seems to prop up very easily when searched on limewire (though i see a lot of 112 or 128 mp3's however), though I never found the 2 live tracks at the end of the album though.

If you wish to upload a torrent of it that would be welcome too ;) (A lot of what I upload I just downloaded from limewire then move it here, otherwise it's rare stuff out of my cd collection ;))

I wish I could seed 24/7 but I just don't have enough bandwidth, and can't hog all of our bandwidth doing so.

If there's anything else you want just let me know and I'll see what I can find ;)"

[V],piratetorrent1989,2010-10-27T09:16Z,"unfortunately, I don't have Cross the line cd, and the only versions i've been able to find of it sometimes propped up on limewire, but it's quality was poor (112kbps, or 128kbps for a couple of songs). But if I do get my hands on a decent copy, I will upload it :)"
