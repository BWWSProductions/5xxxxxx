Professor Irving Kirsch, author of The Emperor's New Drugs, discussed his research into the efficacy of antidepressant medication. Kirsch argued that, contrary to popular belief, depression is not caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain and that treating the condition with antidepressant drugs is no more effective than placebos.
