,TheStich,2010-01-26T13:04Z,"Dude! Man you is fast! But that saves me the hassle of uploading my list :)

Please seed - I will unlimit my upload ratio and go at full speed until demands drops off.

Thanks for the upload..."
,UpStream88,2010-01-26T13:11Z,"Hey, at the moment i'm capped, until probably tomorrow, then i'm back at full speed. If you're patient and don't mind waiting a little longer, it's there for ya's..."
,krozzie,2010-01-27T02:11Z,"mmm this is looking like a dead torrent at this point... I've downloaded this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5309392/Triple_j_%28jjj%29_hottest_100_2009 
some of the tunes are average quality "
,UpStream88,2010-01-27T03:16Z,For a few hours the speed will be very high! So download now. I'm on a high speed connection for a while... Quality should be great
,UpStream88,2010-01-27T03:16Z,...A lot of these tracks are directly from the albums myself
,krozzie,2010-01-27T03:56Z,"good stuff, it's now downloading like a dream :) 

and I'm happily seeding at 25kbs!!"
,domukun3,2010-01-27T05:57Z,"Please can you reseed... there's about 50 people stuck on 57%

4pm on Wednesday"
,UpStream88,2010-01-27T06:12Z,"It is still seeding, upload speed approx 90kB/s"
,domukun3,2010-01-27T06:18Z,"Thanks UpStream - everything's back working again now.

Seeding at 30k all day now."
,aarongraham14,2010-01-27T10:12Z,stuck on 77.9% can you reseed?
,sgt_sprocket,2010-01-27T11:29Z,also stuck on 77.9%... unless someone re-seeds you're wasting your time trying to download this...
,megiebee,2010-01-28T03:38Z,can someone reseed pretty please am stuck on 78%
,playstraight,2010-01-28T10:37Z,78.8%... seeders pleeeeeeeeeease.
,versix,2010-01-28T19:59Z,"Great job getting this playlist compiled and up so soon. Piss poor job actually seeding it - as far as I can tell nobody has downloaded a complete copy off you. I'm stuck at 77%, and have yet to complete a single file - strangely, all the parts missing at at the beginning and end of songs."
,flex1517,2010-01-28T23:54Z,You keep recommending your torrent and you can't even seed it... WTF? At least have a connection you can seed it on 24/7 until other people have a complete copy of it...
,flex1517,2010-01-28T23:55Z,Nice work with the quick up though...
,domukun3,2010-01-29T05:10Z,"Seeding fail... we're still stuck at 81%. I give up.

This one is seeded properly:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5310685/Triple_J_Hottest_100_of_2009"
,UpStream88,2010-01-29T08:44Z,"Sorry for the lack of seeding. Connection's been REALLY bad. But i'm now connected to a 1500 speed connection, seeding now and will be for about 48 hours... Enjoy!"
,brando4561,2010-01-29T10:08Z,stuck at 81 plz seed!!
,UpStream88,2010-01-29T10:12Z,I am seeding. 
,UpStream88,2010-01-29T10:26Z,"It says 0 (674) for peers. And I am seeding, at high speed. "
,flex1517,2010-02-01T02:01Z,maybe disable you firewall or something. Make sure you have the port for utorrent forwarded on your router so you can connect to all the peers
,dockersfan,2010-02-05T18:48Z,"If ya stuck at 81.2% and can't be bothered, try this link; http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5310685/Triple_J_Hottest_100_of_2009"
,Teabagger,2010-02-09T13:23Z,"This is FAKE. I've been at 81% since 29th Jan. Out of 81% so far not even 1 song is complete - on every single song the start and end are missing. Obviously a FAKE upload.

This one seems to be working:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5310685/Triple_J_Hottest_100_of_2009"
,UpStream88,2010-02-20T04:23Z,"@Teabagger

It's not fake, you idiot. I just couldn't be bothered uploading it anymore. I'd uploaded 10GB and nobody else bothered to seed, so I stopped it.

And what you said about how the song starts but doesn't finish, do you have any idea how Torrents work, dickhead? Of course that's going to happen if you haven't downloaded the full thing you dumb fuck..."
,Badstench1,2010-02-28T00:33Z,UpStream88 and any other possible streamers. Please re-seed if possible I am so close and will seed myself once Im at 100%..  Please someone.
,stest,2011-01-26T10:14Z,can't be arsed seeding... how bloody un-Australian  is that :-)
,stest,2011-01-26T10:15Z,On Australia Day too!
