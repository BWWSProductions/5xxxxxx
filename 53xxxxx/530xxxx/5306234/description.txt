         Unique to North America, the bald eagle is the continent's    
         most recognizable aerial predator, with a shocking white      
         head, electric yellow beak and penetrating eyes. In           
         the 1960s, this symbol of the United States became an         
         emblem of environmental degradation as the pesticide          
         DDT and other human pressures brought it to the brink of      
         extinction. Following their protection as an endangered       
         species, bald eagles have come roaring back. Photographed     
         by Emmy-winning cinematographer Neil Rettig, this film        
         focuses on the drama of the nest. Even in the best of         
         times, it's a surprisingly tough struggle to maintain         
         a one-ton home and raise chicks until they can hunt on        
          their own.
