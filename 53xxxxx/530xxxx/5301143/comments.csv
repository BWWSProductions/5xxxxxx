,SlighlyTwisted,2010-01-24T19:12Z,"I'm sorry, but this song should be removed from this site. Evanescence has released this song to be available for people who donate to help the aid in Haiti. 
Steal all you want from artists, I don't care, (though I hope you support the ones you love) but this is just not right. You've taken a song that is supposed to be for a good cause, and made it freely availabe for anyone. You should at least wait until it's no longer available through making donations. 

That being said, it's a beautiful song, and I hope people will do the right thing and go to www.unfoundation.org/evanescence, to get this song."
,esrar_zakir,2010-01-25T05:16Z,"Hey SlighlyTwisted... i completely agree with you, but not everyone is willing to donate...otherwise after getting to know that the band has released a new song, everybody would had gone to the UN site and donated to download the song instead of searching for it on a bitorrent site...Those who are really willing to contribute will do it irrespective of whether the song is available for free or not."

But hey WTF ARE you doing sEARCHIng FOR IT PRICK?"
,gegendasEstablishment,2011-03-17T17:17Z,"It's been proven that 80% or more of the proceeds go to the people running the charity, if you really care donate directly on their website even then you're taking a chance.But thank you esrar 4 the up! dont take it down for these fuckers."
,gegendasEstablishment,2011-05-28T01:14Z,there are soo many fu*king ways to donate.just download the damn song and throw your money away to the red cross they probably take 80 to 90 % percent of the donations if not more.evanescence is awesome thaks for the up esrar!!
,rawree,2011-06-30T04:50Z,"If you're concerned, the best thing you can do is donate DIRECTLY, rather than through a third party. There's so damn many products and services that claim your money will go to charity, but it's not usually 100%, and a large chunk of it is often caught up in ""administrative fees"", and often also gets caught up in outright fraud. (This is also why you shouldn't donate at a grocery store.. but whatever.)"
,sweetsensation,2012-01-25T04:16Z,"Hi hi.
The Haiti relief donation site accepts only credit cards, which I am unable to get and it is sold only through Amazon.com. Now if you know, Amazon doesn't operate in most of the world's countries. This is the only way I can get it.

Not only that, Haiti was/is not the worst off country. I donate to water charities that provide water to stricken areas in Africa (whether it reaches them is questionable) and other places. I really don't suggest people only give money when they are promoted by mass media. 

Hope you understand, I do not wish to miss out on beautiful music just because I am unable to donate."
