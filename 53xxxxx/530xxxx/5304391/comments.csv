,OrpheusDude,2011-01-31T07:31Z,"To 0290: Download the free DVD burning program called IMGBurn (look for it on Google).  It is simple: you just add the VIDEO_TS file from this download and pop in a blank DVD and about 20 minutes later... voilรยก!

If you have a film in a compressed file in .avi format, I suggest you use a combination of DVD Flick (also freeware) and IMGBurn to convert the .avi file to a VIDEO_TS file and burn a terrific DVD.

I've done this literally hundreds of times.

I hope this helps."
