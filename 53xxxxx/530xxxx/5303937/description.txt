      Historian and sailor Dan Snow presents the second        
      episode in this four-part series examining the          
      remarkable story of how the country's greatest         
      institution - her Navy - has shaped her history. In The 
      Golden Ocean, Snow charts the period from 1690 to 1759   
      and reveals how England - soon to be Britain - and her  
      Navy rose from the depths of military and economic     
      disaster to achieve global supremacy.                   
                                                               
      In 1690, France ruled the waves and the Royal Navy was  
      in tatters. King William III had taken England into a  
      disastrous war against the most powerful country in     
      Europe. If England was to survive, it needed a new Navy  
      one capable of carrying the fight to its enemies        
      anywhere in the world.                                 
                                                              
      To achieve this would require a national effort unlike   
      anything that had been seen before. King William III's  
      determination to achieve mastery of the seas unleashed 
      a chain reaction of revolutions in finance, industry    
      and agriculture which reshaped the landscape and         
      created the country's first great credit boom. Fifty    
      years before the Industrial Revolution, the Royal Navy 
      became the engine of global change, propelling Britain  
      into the modern world.                                   
                                                              
      It had the desired effect at sea. By 1759, French      
      forces around the world were capitulating to Britain's  
      superior Navy. For the first time in her history,        
      Britannia really did rule the waves.
