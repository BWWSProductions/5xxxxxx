,KOBKED-X,2010-01-28T06:20Z,"Interesting torrent, If you want to brain wash just use Shock Therapy , around 2000v should do it..or better yet, just let your kids watch TV. TV is Great, all the christian morals, all the GOD ON OUR SIDE killing sprees in the middle east..

Oh ya don't forget to teach em t oturn thier cheeks, so the priest doesn't have to adjust his Angle when Fucking them in the ass...Ya, the Bible..So well thought of..by child molesters...on second thought, I'll pass this one like a turd..and flush... 

And a special Note to Bwalker.. I am not Mr tolerance at all..well mostly I am..But now with Christians or any other Oganized Church of Any kind.. If this offends you.. Good.. maybe you needed to be offended...and one more thing.. Go Molest a Christian, They seem to like it..."

,Jaffarin,2010-02-20T05:27Z,"All parents, even the non-religious, brainwash their kids! The child is always a tabulka rasa when entering the world. What have you taught your children? Tolerance? Love? Respect? Sharing? Good manners - both in behavior and speech?"

(The Bible says:EVERY knee will bow and EVERY tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord!) Just because you renounce Christ doesn't mean he doesn't exist.

And a special note to KOBKED-X: Christian morals and killing sprees in the middle east have nothing to do with one another. You have your religions mixed up. I have found after travelling the world and being in the presence of wonderfully different people, the ones who think they're so enlightened are usually the most ignorant:-) Have a Blessed Day!"
