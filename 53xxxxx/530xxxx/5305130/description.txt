BBC R4 Documentary - 'Who Wrote Bach's Toccata?'
Presented by Simon Townley
Produced by Chris Taylor
Broadcast February 13, 2007
Coded from tape at 128/44.1

An informed look at claims that the 'Toccata & Fugue in D minor'
has been either wrongly ascribed to J S Bach, or significantly
re-orchestrated since J S Bach wrote it.

An excellent programme.
