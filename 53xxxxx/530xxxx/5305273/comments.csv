,RipMinyn,2010-03-01T02:14Z,"Ha, I have to admit they sort of come across as such.  Though, since I'm the uploader, and I know it wasn't me, I figured there was a chance I was being punked; yet, I suppose many folks just don't realize how small a quality h264 can get with just the right encoder options so that was reflected in their comments and ratings (btw, see my x264 encoding guide {link in description above} for the exact options I used to encode this film; I was inspired by newartriot who also uses quality based VBR, instead of fixed bitrate ABR/CBR like most other h264 uploaders.  It's like in the MP3 world; good uploaders use quality based VBR (--preset-standard), not ABR or CBR, for maximum quality with no wasted space.
Enjoy the show,

I have a question about that multiAVCHD...I am trying to convert a video_TS folder into .mp4 .avi or .mkv this program only seems to give me .mts and the file size is enormous, even at the low end settings....it's gutting because it finished sooooo fast compared to AVS...any help would be ultra appreciated!!"
,RipMinyn,2010-03-11T15:15Z,"> "" I am trying to convert a video_TS folder into .mp4 .avi or .mkv ""

The ""multiAVCHD"" software does the opposite of your intentions.  Your intentions require other software, such as RipBot (see my mp4/mkv/h264 encoding guide; click latest post):

Good luck!

,PhilnLisa,2010-03-13T05:04Z,"Thankyou RipMinyn, how fast does that take to complete? I've been using AVS but it takes forever! 

Again I am amazed at the quality of this! We need to let others know about this, it's staggeringly good!"
,RipMinyn,2010-03-13T15:22Z,"> "" how fast [to encode]? ""

Well, the x264 encoder options that I prefer will likely take somewhat longer; that's intentional as I do not mind spending extra time to make it the smallest possible file while still maintaining high 720p quality.  The short answer is:  about 4 hours on an AMD 3.4GHz Quad-core."

,RipMinyn,2010-03-14T04:16Z,"> ""please seed...""
Please set up Port Forwarding to receive Incoming Connections. All of my uploads are permanently seeded (unless specified otherwise), but unfortunately the seeder doesn't accept incoming connections (for security reasons); thus, the swarm needs at least one downloader that accepts incoming connections to forward data on to those that may not or cannot. Thank you for understanding.
FYI, the full 2GB torrent of X-Men Trilogy R-Rated may be found here...
