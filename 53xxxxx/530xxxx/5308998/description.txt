Paper on Differentials: Harmonics & Zero Point Energy

Abstract: All Geometry and Sacred Geometry lacks the discovery of differential mathematics and shapes. Without differentials, the universe could not function as a perpetual motion machine.

Newtonâ€™s Third Law is Violated by this paper. All opposing forces may appear equal and opposite to each action but they are not; they have differentials. In the quantum universe, all particles have opposite pairs. It is believed these opposite are equal in mass-energy. This will be violated by this new discovery.


- Singularity.pdf


Did God of the Old Testament, Krishna, Pythagoras, Buddha and Jesus speak in a secret language of quantum physics that no one would understand until now? If there is a code that can unlock the matrix of War, Disease, Death, Space and Time, Singularity is it! Singularity unlocks the code to the most profound enigmatic questions human beings face: Where are we in the universal map? How did we get here and why are we stuck here? Why do we face disease old age and death? Why is war part of our reality? Finally, why are we stuck on a small planet, unable to move faster than the speed of light? It is almost as if the material universe has a secret code, that unless discovered and broken, humanity remains imprisoned unable to conquer the vast distances between Earth and other Star systems where intelligent life might exist. Human beings do not have regular, accurate contact with the Divine Architect of the Universe. Why? We are trapped unless we can decode Space and Time.
