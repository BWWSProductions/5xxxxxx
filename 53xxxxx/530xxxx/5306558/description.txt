           Love can be painful. Very painful. The                         
           intriguing-on-the-outside,                                     
           twisted-and-tortured-on-the-inside Tara sets her sights        
           on the unassuming guy-next-door Ray. Their innocent            
           flirting turns into a regretful one night stand which he       
           hopes to put behind him. Tara has different plans for          
           their relationship. It becomes horrifically apparent that      
           she refuses to be cast aside and is willing to go to sick      
           extremes to keep her man as people in Ray's life are met       
           with torturous ends. Amidst this violently twisted love        
           story unfolds a profound social commentary on love and         
           the effects of violence.
