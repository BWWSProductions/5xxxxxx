,Liquidizer38,2010-02-06T04:03Z,"Nikita, this is the authentic disc man. It's the same identical Boot CD anyone will make with ATI 2010 (when adding the addons). Thank you so much for taking the time to upload it. Wish I had found it before getting ATI 2010. Would've saved me some bread. This is an awesome file, and I recommend it to anyone. Kudos to Nikita200. Great file man. "
