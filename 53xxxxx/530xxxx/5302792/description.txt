1. copy your IMG file (not move, backup is good :-)) "MAP Locked" directory

2. write your map details in MapsetHeader.txt and MapName.txt file

- MapsetHeader.txt eg. "Garmin City NavigatorÂ© NT 2010.20" without quotes (50 characters allowed)
- MapName.txt eg. "Spain & Italy (Unlocked)" without quotes (50 characters allowed)

3. Run "UNLOCK MAP DIRECTORY.EXE"

4. now you have GMAPSUPP.IMG inside "MAP UnLocked" directory
