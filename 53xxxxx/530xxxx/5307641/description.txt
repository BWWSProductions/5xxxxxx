This is the Deutsche Grammophon Complete Beethoven in 20 volumes (87 CDs), which I downloaded from Demonoid a long time ago as one .ape file per CD. For my own use I broke down each .ape file into separate .flac tracks and renamed all the files to be consistent with the track names in the booklets (within the limits of filename length and allowable characters). I'm posting it now as separate volumes rather than one large download because I know that some people like large downloads to be split into handy chunks. Includes scans of all the booklet pages and CDs.

Rather than trying to describe the contents of each of the volumes, I've posted a small torrent (15MB) containing just the scans of the pages in the booklets that show the performer and track details. You can find it here:

All credit should go to however it was that I downloaded it from; any mistakes in the file names are mine.

Enjoy (and seed!)
