Jason's show is live today. There are no guests, but he does take a number of calls.


Topics include the top stories of the week past, with special attention for some.


Osama bin Laden rises from the grave to make a new audio recording in which he takes credit for the Crotch Bomber; cops in Pittsburg, PA beat up a honor student walking to his grandmother's house because he was carrying a Mt. Dew bottle; the increasing use of flying drones by police; etc., etc..

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
