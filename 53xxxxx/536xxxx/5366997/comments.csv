,pilot234,2010-03-07T17:36Z,"Oh My.I'm 22 minutes into the movie and I can safely say that this is the most horseshit of a movie I've watched these past 2 years,the previous one being Date Movie.Fuck, what a waste of reel.What a waste of bandwidth.This movie is worse than diarrhea,its more gutwrenching than 2 Girls One Cup.Avoid this! "
,rob87035,2010-03-16T04:29Z,I'd rather watch an abortion than this piece of shit again!!
,jeggae25,2010-03-18T01:46Z,let me get this straight... this movie sucks rite?
,kragger_lidd,2010-03-18T03:30Z,after reading all these comments i wanna dl this to see if it is that bad
,holman534,2010-03-20T15:18Z,"This movie is OK, the quality is about A5/V6 and it is same quality on movie-slope.info, please remove the - sign "
,perryl,2010-03-29T16:33Z,"the a/v quality is good. despite what people might say, those people that cant see good picture need to learn what a codec is. 

the movie itself. completely worth it just for watching ja rule get shot in the head.

plot was weak, but watchable, actors... well they couldnt act, script was shit. but hey, its all what you expect really. alot of shooting and violence. 

worth a download imo, but id never pay for it, in fact, if your bandwidth costs money, you might want to reconsider downloading this movie. your really not missing much. "
,EzK,2010-05-28T20:38Z,"Well:
Audio 10/10
Video 9.5/10
Great Quality Rip!
Movie was interesting ignore comments!"

,sam.smarty,2011-05-19T06:32Z,fuck the pig......
,diakon27,2011-06-19T04:11Z,"Whoever thinks this movie isn't good are dumbfucks. This movie is great. Don't be all pissed off cuz there are wrestlers in the movie but then you people that are, are the assclowns that don't watch wrestling which is highly more entertaining that any other sport out there by the way in my opinion. RVD & Batista are better actors than alot of other actors out there. True wrestling fans will agree with this statement I have made. .BONE. Great upload "
,diakon27,2011-06-19T04:16Z,"Oh & another thing, I would love for you shitfucks that said this movie was shit to say that to RVD & Batista's face. You would get your ass beat! Stupidfucks!! Fuck all you haters!!!"
