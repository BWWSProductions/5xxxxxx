When Henry DeTamble meets Clare Abshire in a Chicago library they both understand that he is a time traveller, but she
she knows much more than this about him as he has not yet been to the times and places where they have met before. He
falls in love with her, as she has already with him, but his continuing unavoidable absences time travelling - and then
returning with increasing knowledge of their future - makes things ever more difficult for Clare.
