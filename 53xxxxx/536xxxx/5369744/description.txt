All releases by Laughing Hyenas, including three albums and two EPs (Merry Go Round was extended). Life of Crime is probably the best to start with and then moving back into their rawer, more punk like influenced releases. They sounded more and more like the Rolling Stones as time went on, whether this is a good or bad thing is entirely up to you.
