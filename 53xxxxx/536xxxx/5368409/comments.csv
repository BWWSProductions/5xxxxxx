The first Spyro game, please."
,Luciferious13,2010-11-03T02:07Z,"Ok, this is a ""stupid"" question: But I'm just wondering if there's any chance this game will work on PAL system? I know it's NTSC, but just hoping there's some hope"
,Razony,2010-11-13T14:26Z,@Luciferious13 you can but u must have a modded ps2 and swap magic 3

,rhyderv2.6,2011-02-11T06:16Z,hey guys please help me how can i burn this in a dvd for ps2 ...................
,stthedevil007,2011-05-09T16:11Z,whats the decompressed size?
,VegitoFAN,2012-05-06T04:14Z,"ryder: that should be a bit more complex, but easy enough...

honestly i havent done it but since dvd discs are just like any other discdrive in most aspects it should be easy enough.

first you need an empty dvd disc, you will also need a chipped ps2 (so that it doesnt reject the disc because theres no authorization), then you need a pc with burning abillities (Note not sure if this is soft, or hardware, but daemont tools lite can handle software part, and so can windows 7 last time i checked), and the iso file itself.

then you take the iso file and burn it onto disc.
that should be easy enough, daemon tools should show what option is burn (there might be other free programs as well, here i can only say google)

if it doesnt work by burning iso file to disc, then you must extract it first, and delete the file on disc if it didnt work, then open it with winrar (google again, free), then take those files you find INSIDE the iso file and burn those to disc.

that should work but i havent tried it myself.
this should be the basics however."
,VegitoFAN,2012-05-06T04:17Z,"BTW for those of you that like this game and that has a next gen console (including next gen power pcs) i can strongly recommend bloodstone, just as amazing and ive played both.

that and they are both independant jb games...
i sense a pattern."
,Cerebral222,2012-06-09T07:21Z,"Decompressed size is 3.24 gig, and works well with emulator; if using emulator, PAL or NTSC doesn't matter. Thanks thenoobish, nice upload, I will help seed this for others, +1 from me, Cheers."
