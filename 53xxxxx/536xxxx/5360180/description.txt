Playlist: The Very Best of Mariah Carey is a compilation album by American
pop/R&B singer Mariah Carey. The album features some of Carey's released and
unreleased songs (as singles) over the course of her career.

The album was released on January 26, 2010 as part of the Playlist music
album series issued by Legacy Recordings

The album contains some of Mariah Carey's hits and singles, and also some
songs from her previous albums from her time at Columbia Records. It does not
feature any new material or include songs recorded with her current label,
Island Records, or her previous label, Virgin Records. It is a part of Sony
Legacy's Playlist compilation albums series. Playlist: The Very Best of
- Mariah Carey is a compilation of remastered original recordings by Mariah.
The playlist includes select greatest hits and some of Carey's favorite
tracks that were not released as singles. The CD comes in eco-friendly
packaging made of recyclable materials. A PDF file included on the CD
contains the song credits, photographs, and full liner notes. The difference
in between Carey's previous greatest hits compilations and Playlist is that
her previous ones had her most successful hits; Playlist had songs that in
her opinion, were hits, meaning there were some non-singles included such as
"Underneath the Stars" from Daydream, which she said was one of her favorite
songs by herself in the booklet of her 2009 album Memoirs of an Imperfect
Angel. Even "Outside" from Butterfly was included.
