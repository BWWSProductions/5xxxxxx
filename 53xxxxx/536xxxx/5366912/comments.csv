,jessew99,2010-02-16T18:23Z,"I saw this movie when it first came out and the only thing that got me through it was the thought, ""Man, I can't wait for RiffTrax to do this one."" I've been waiting for this one for months now. Thanks for the upload."
,kc278,2010-02-17T03:13Z,"I didn't think it was all that bad (better than T3 anyways), but I've only ever watched it with the Rifftrax!"
,captainronito,2010-02-17T13:36Z,"Donated!

Thankx!"
,stonedcrow3,2010-03-03T10:38Z,"Dude thats such shit. if you're gonna have stupid fuckin commentary throughout the movie, say so in the goddamn description. asshole!"
,el_makkles,2010-03-08T18:57Z,"@glazer & stonedcrow3... You clearly don't know what Rifftrax are all about.

Try using Google before you waste your time commenting on things you know fuck all about... in fact [url=http://lmgtfy.com/?q=rifftrax]Click here![/url]"
,Keshicus,2010-03-19T12:50Z,"@stonedcrow3 I hope you're trolling because your idiocy is astounding. How about you read the description instead. Does it provide a link? Gee I wonder what Rifftrax means...maybe I should google it...

Please do us a favor and die."
,JonasC47,2010-04-29T00:09Z,"People sometimes expect others to hold them by the hand every step of the way. ""Rifftrax"" is not only in the description, but in the TITLE OF FUCKING TORRENT ITSELF!

Thanks for this amazing upload, and I've donated yet again to the Rifftrax crew! They deserve the income and our patronage!"
,Knox02,2010-12-10T23:56Z,"Damn, stonedcrow3.. You're a complete moron."
