The ... Full Descriptionhard rock world got a close-up view of the power of AC/DC with the band's 
first live offering, IF YOU WANT BLOOD, YOU'VE GOT IT. Although the Australian rockers had three prior 
studio releases of undeniable crunch under their belt, it was this live document that captured the band 
in all its' chomping power chord glory. Distilling the blues and rock 'n' roll down to its barest 
structures of guitar/bass/drums leaves little room for error. Without heavy production techniques, 
keyboards, tape loops (or even an effect pedal, for that matter), the band takes to the stage with only 
bare-knuckle riffs and a floor shaking 4/4 beat. 

And shake the floor they did. Many of the tunes included here are became early live classics for the band. 
Certainly, "The Jack," a gleeful tale of sexually transmitted disease and "Whole Lotta Rosie," another 
heartwarming romp about a...uh...large female fan were concert staples during the band's formative years 
for good reason. Led by Angus Young's gargantuan guitar, these songs are trademark boogie stoppers full of 
adolescent lust and a hedonistic sweat that is entirely guilt free.
