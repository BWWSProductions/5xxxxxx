,BayWarden,2012-05-24T01:02Z,"For those that are stuck at the ""crack"" part.

After the installation,the crack file is not named, (as said in description ""Crackfolder"" but there is no one with that title)i took a wild guess and copy pasted the ""Autorun"" BBA  type, 1.8 MB or so heavy (1.800 kb i think).It worked :)"
