title.......: Metal Machine Music: Nine Inch Nails And The Industrial Uprising
year........: 2009
blurb.......: Providing inspiration for the title of this DVD, Lou Reed's 5th solo album split opinion
              dramatically upon its release in 1975, but while many saw it as a contractual obligation
              designed to shock the listener, its long term influence has been nothing short of
              startling.

              The likes of Genesis P-Orridge and Throbbing Gristle in London, Cabaret Voltaire in
              Sheffield however, were concurrently performing a UK brand of what would soon be
              termed 'industrial', and these seeds collectively not only assisted and influenced the
              rapid rise of that period's Punk assault, they also moved electronic music into a new era.
              This new era would run its own course and influence greatly an American drift in the
              mid-1980s towards a home-grown, danceable variety of electro-industrial rock, with the
              remarkable Nine Inch Nails at its heart and soul.

              This film traces fascinating and reviews the fascinating history of industrial music, via
              its 1970s origins, through its enormous rise to prominence in America in the late 1980s and
              throughout the 1990s with NIN as the focal point, to culminate with the current activities
              of Trent Reznor as he uses marketing and promotional initiatives in a manner just as
              creative as the music he continues to compose.
