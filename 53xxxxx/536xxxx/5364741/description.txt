BBC cooking series galore. Clarissa Dickson Wright and Jennifer Paterson roam Britain on an old motorcycle and cook rich dishes with a flair.

The original is a 4 DL disk box, available here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4927744/Two_Fat_Ladies_COMPLETE_4_Disk_DVD_Collection . While I love the fat ladies I didn't really want to buy 4 DL DVDs, so I shrunk it to fit on 4 SL DVDs. Since it took me 5 days to get the original down, I thought there might be others who also would appreciate a smaller version, so here it is.
