Afterglow was a box set compilation by Electric Light Orchestra released in 1990 with liner notes by music
critic and editor Ira Robbins of Trouser Press fame. See also: Flashback.

The selection mixes the usual hit singles with lesser known album tracks and non-album b-sides, including
most of the Secret Messages tracks that were not released when the intended album was reduced from a double
