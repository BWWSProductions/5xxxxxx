,Santaira,2010-02-17T20:49Z,Thank you soo much! I made an account just to show my appreciation of your torrents. As a Canadian I don't get RPDR up here at all and I hate to wait for some crappy local station to pick it up five months after it's over. Thank you!

,gfmickel,2010-02-17T23:21Z,"LOL.  No problem, Santaira.  And your welcome to all.  I noticed I made a mistake in my description of this torrent regarding the originator.  So let me give a proper shout out to JOhNiEBOi over at demonoid for creating this torrent for all of us to share.  So thanks again JOhNiEBOi :-D"
