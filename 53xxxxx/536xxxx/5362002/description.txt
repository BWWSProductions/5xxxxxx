Apricot Rail produce some of the most discretely charming, lush instrumental pop music youâ€™re likely to hear all year. Delicate, bell-like arpeggiated guitars weave around snaking clarinet and flute, while the beautifully held back yet sanguine rhythm section drives the whole thing into a blurred, sun-soaked horizon. 

Their debut album features the wonderfully received single â€˜Pouring Milk Out The Windowâ€™, an anthem without ever having to be anthemic, a melancholic reverie that never resorts to the emotional ease of sadness. â€˜If You Canâ€™t Join Them, Beat Themâ€™, which featured on the 2009 Spunk Singles Club compilation album, is another chiming standout. And gorgeous closing track â€˜Halfway Houseâ€™ weaves in bubbling electronics as the band lead the listener through glowing landscapes and light-drenched vistas.
