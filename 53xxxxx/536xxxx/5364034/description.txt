Repercussion is very much of a piece with the debut, repeating much of the same formula that made Stands for Decibels great -- terrific harmonies, winning melodies, and catchy hooks with subtle quirks thrown into the mix. This time, they feature a fuller, more polished sound, but the impact of the songs isn't diminished. Stamey  left shortly after Repercussion to pursue a solo career. ["pH Factor" was added as a bonus track to the IRS CD reissue in 1989.]
