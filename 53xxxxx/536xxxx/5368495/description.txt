Her father may be the legendary Brazilian guitarist Joao Gilberto, but in 2000 daughter Bebel proved that she understands the bossa nova, too. There's a subtlety throughout this recording that makes Bebel's voice entrancing, as she re-creates the sensual essence of bossa nova before running with it into electronic territory toward the album's end. Tanto Tempo is an even-tempered statement that manages to showcase Bebel's own sexy voice while gracefully remembering the past.
