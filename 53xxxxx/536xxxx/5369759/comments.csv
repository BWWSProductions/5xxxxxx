,Jeffadore,2010-02-19T03:32Z,"Help, i followed the instructions exactly and the game still won't start, did i misplace the no dvd patch, because i put it where the normal one goes, help please"
,neon427,2010-02-19T06:02Z,The No-dvd patch is specifically for the 1.7 patch so try reinstalling the 1.7 patch and  then copying over the NO-dvd .eve into the installation file. Is it giving you an error of some sort?
,Alphier,2010-02-28T14:36Z,"Excuse me... But i was wondering. You see. I have a bit problem with the instalation. you say that i must right click on the Magic Disc and then click on viritual cd/dvd room or something. But i cant. Because, the viritual cd/dvd room button doesent come up on the list, when im right clicking the MagicDisc. Can you please help me? With Another solution or something? Would Forever appreciate it^^"
,neon427,2010-03-01T17:49Z,"Alright, make sure you've installed magic disk. Once you have done that click the shortcut to open the application.  Nothing will actually pop up, so you have too look in the lower right hand corner of your screen In your tool bar.  You should see an icon with a hand holding a disk, somewhere next to your volume control button in the toolbar.  Right click on the icon and a list should pop up. And the virtual dvd/cd option is at the very top. Hope this helps!"
,neon427,2010-03-04T03:26Z,"without having seen the error myself I don't know what else to tell you, other than just reinstall it all. sometimes stuff happens. And a good GPU is almost a necessity. =/"
,NTX,2010-03-18T21:05Z,"If you just want to play Lan, is it possible without having a legal cd key?"
,neon427,2010-03-19T07:16Z,"I haven't tried it so I'm not quite sure. Best way to try would be to download the torrent on two different computers and see if you can.  I'd imagine so, but again, I don't know."
,NTX,2010-03-19T18:49Z,"Okey, maybe I'll give it a shot later, thanks for your answer :)"

,random_name_19,2010-11-01T05:47Z,"if you want to download faster put your upload unlimated & download unlimated! This works because torrents work by sharing the information to each other. Meaning the move you give, the move you get back.
Unlike a server.
I'm now downloading at 150kb/s on avaerge!

Hope this comment helps."
,unofficialofficial,2010-11-09T16:49Z,"so i did everything you said to do in the readme, everything installed correctly, i copied the CoDWaW.exe found in c:\program files\activision\call of duty- world at war, and pasted it into my documents, i rename the file to CoDWaW original.exe. Then i pasted the CoDWaW.exe in the no patch dvd 1.7 to c:\program files\activision\call of duty- world at war, i then tried to run the game it acts like it is about to load something then nothing happens... so i then deleted the CoDWaW.exe that starts in the activision folder since i have a backup saved, tried to run the game with the no patch CoDWaW.exe in the activision folder same thing happens. i then tried to reinstall patch 1.7 since the no dvd patch 1.7 is for patch 1.7 but comp says i already have it installed and there is no need to install it. I tried to run the game again same thing. So then i tried to run the game with the magic disc (my drive is setup at I:) and the game pops but when i click on single player it just closes and nothing happens. So then i unmounted the cod iso from magic disc then tried to run then game with the no patch dvd exe, same thing still nothing happens. So what do i do to make the game work?? i followed all of the readme exactly and it doesn't work"
,unofficialofficial,2010-11-09T16:58Z,"so i went into the properties of the no patch dvd 1.7 codwaw.exe that i pasted into the activision folder, and i changed to compatability mode to see if it would work and when i did so, i now know the game load for like a quick second but then exits, if that helps"
