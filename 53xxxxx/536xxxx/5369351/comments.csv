,The-Blob,2010-03-09T04:18Z,"Amazing! A few of the other releases were just a huge mess of RAR's that required several attempts at extraction. This one was simple and installed perfectly! Although, is there a way to bypass the register screen where it asks for your name and e-mail? It's not that big a deal, just wondering. Thank you!"

,adizz131,2010-04-04T07:31Z,to get past the register screen enter your details.. or some random details. once you have done that it shouldnt pop up again
