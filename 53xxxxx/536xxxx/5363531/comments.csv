,megaflix,2010-02-20T20:52Z,A load of shit!
,ornatus,2010-02-20T21:47Z,How do you actually get to watch this film without having to do the bloody survey which then asks for your phone number?
,ornatus,2010-02-20T21:50Z,Whenever i try to play this torrent it asks to play in windows media player and once it starts to play in wmp it stops and asks you to do a survey which asks for your phone number and if you dont give them your number it will not complete and you cant watch the film.  If its not possible to watch this film without giving them your phone number then i would advise everyone to keep well away

This is oldschool KVCD quality.
Can't really complain though, since it's free and got upped so fast!
Thanks"
,SOBB3029,2010-02-23T07:35Z,"You may notice that the people who run this down have nothing themselves. Just spammers. Ignore their rubbish - 'cause that's all it is.

Thanks .BONE. great job!

(Us people with VIP status don't get that rating because we have nothing - it's earned)"

Thank you For the UL .bone."
,Video_Veg,2010-07-05T00:48Z,Didn't realize this was a CAM; Poor sound (Boomy) and Video dark and blurry - suppose that's expected.
,Video_Veg,2010-07-05T05:41Z,"Didn't mean to sound ungrateful to BONE for the CAM; it was probably made before DVDrip was available, and I've enjoyed watching CAMs when necessary - but now DVDrip available, so I prefer to watch that.
Thanks anyway"
,Seygantte,2011-09-09T13:33Z,"There's no longer a reason to use this now that a FXG has released their DVDRIP. The quality just doesn't measure up.
