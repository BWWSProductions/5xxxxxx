Please seed (share) these programs. Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks.

Setup Factory 8 is the result of over a decade of experience in creating software installation tools. 

Unlike other installer builders that require week-long training courses in order to get up to speed, Setup Factory was designed to be fast and easy to use. 

By pairing a visual layout of your softwareâ€™s files and folders with a point-and-click interface, the entire process becomes completely logical and absolutely painless. 

Whatâ€™s more, Setup Factory creates a compact, single-file setup.exe that runs on any version of Windows from 95 to Windows 7 and is perfect for distribution by web download, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM and LAN.
