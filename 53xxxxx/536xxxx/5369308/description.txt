
Michael Bolton All That Matters(mp3 320 kbps)ICM369
___________________________________________________

Michael Bolton is an American singer-songwriter born in 1953. 
Initially he had a long career under his real name 
Michael Bolotin and then found success as the lead singer in 
the group Blackjack. 

The band released two albums during the 1970s but by 1983 he 
had launched a solo career as Michael Bolton.

This is the best CD he has ever put out. He worked with 
Diane Warren (Monica, Brandy, Whitney Houston ETC) Babyface, 
Barry Eastmond (Anita Baker, Barry White), David Foster 
( Chaka Khan), And Jamie Houston ( New comer of soul music 
industry).
 
The songs have good beats, Safe place from the storm is a hot 
track with a funky intro a quiet beat and then a Rodney Jerkins 
type bassline. The Best of Love a Made For Toni Braxton type song. 

I think "All That Matters" is at least as good as "Soul Provider" 
and "The One Thing", if not better, all songs are very pleasant, 
sexy, passionate, catchy in tunes but still very soulful 
(instead of being too "pop"). This album has the edge in that all 
songs are very consistent, flows naturally from one to another, 
and brings warm romatic mood.

I like especially "safe place from storm", "best of love", 
"forevers just a matter of time", "go the distance", and 
"heart can be only be so strong", other songs are also good.

These are strong, emotional love songs and while they dont express 
deep and complicated emotions, they are seductive, especially aimed 
for the gals. 

And while guys may be less impressed, he Is worth studying in order
to understand better what reaches his female audience.
