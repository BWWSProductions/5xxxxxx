Remastered at 320VBR  Source was RTR tape 20 to 20K +/- 3db.  I do not know the frequency range of the original broadcast, but in most cases OTR was / is less than 20 to 20K

Broadcast was Jan 8, 1972.  There are interviews and rare tracks

KNAC in Long Beach, CA did a series of "An evening with xx" programs about 1972.

Some had band members interviews live and others did not.

Enjoy	and PLEASE seed.
