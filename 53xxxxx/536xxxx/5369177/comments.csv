,idrone42,2010-02-24T03:28Z,"8 reasons you'll love this movie: 

1) You are as scientifically illiterate as Sarah Palin. Even NASA complained about this movie. Moon advertises itself as ultra-realistic, and starts off by ignoring the fraction of Earth's gravity there is on the moon. NASA asked the director why they would harvest H3 (sunlight) from the dark side of the moon. He replied, knowing it was too late to change the entire movie, ""they don't want to disturb the wildlife on Earth by harvesting the bright side"". So, the logic is: Loose 95% of profits because of an absurd environment consideration while enslaving and murdering countless human clones to save money. 
2) You think a secret, gigantic conspiracy involving systematic cloning, brainwashing and murdering people below the surface of the moon in a facility larger than the actual base they need manned, is NOT a million times more expensive than replacing the one guy there every three years. For that reason, you accept the plot of the movie as ""realistic and intellectually challenging"".
3) You're willing to accept that in the future, technology has moved on, but picking up and shipping a small H3-tank once in a while, can't be done by a robot, even though that's doable today. The only robot in the movie is busy being a mechanic, chef, doctor, psychologist and hair dresser, so it's no way it could have the intelligence to drive out to the computer-driven (!) harvester and pick up a small container. Therefore, there has to be a guy there, to make this self-proclaimed super-realistic, intellectual masterpiece of a movie possible.
4) You think it's only fair that the Nazi Overlords responsible for the Auswitch policy for its Moon branch, would let there be a simple and easy way for the clones to get back to Earth and make them and their employees face life in prison for mass-murder. They would also let there be a even easier way to make a regular phone call to anyone on Earth. 
5) You like watching paint dry, as long as it's accompanied by the same awful piano arpeggio stuck in a loop for two hours, because it makes you feel intellectual about watching something that isn't mainstream Hollywood. Like in any film school project run by a bipolar, self-loving douche, this movie turns slow pacing into an attention-whore effect to cover for the lack of actual content, successfully arousing all the pretentious sci-fi retards out there to the point of intellectual climax. 
6) You like watching two hours of behavior so absurd it can't be related to or understood in any way because it's desperately trying to fake originality, realism and depth the way a 5 year old would change the color of a car: with a bucket of paint and a brush.
7) You think a background as a partying asshole with a constant tan, bleached hair and shock-white teeth, doing nothing but spending dad's cash, in this case David Bowie's cash, until you're 40, sounds promising for a new director-writer. 
8) You think the following reviews are just biased by typical Hollywood action movie consumption mentality, because these papers always hire 18 year old football jocks to write for them:

San Francisco Chronicle: ""'Moon' aims high, misses badly. (...) Moon is boring. Agonizingly, deadeningly, coma-inducingly, they-could-bury-you-alive-accidentally boring"".

Wall Street Journal: ""I won't pretend to understand the movie's deep meaning - if it has one"".

LA Times: ""Ground control to Major Tom: Moon orbits an idea, but it doesn't go anywhere"".

New York Times: ""Ground Control to astronaut on the Moon, ignore our plot"".

Washington Post: ""Storywise, Moon fails to live up to the promise of its premise. There's plenty of atmosphere, but little gravity"". 

Variety: ""The story stretches a bit thin"".

,huffax,2010-03-04T10:46Z,"@idrone Who cares if the gravity is not 1/6 g. The story is wonderful. Anyways this is maybe not the board for movie reviews. Try IMDb.

Good quality, reasonable size. Nice encoding, FXG."
,NedPickles,2010-03-06T15:04Z,"very crisp copy

thank you"
,MrBugMan,2010-04-17T05:09Z,Thanks!!
,RickeeBoy,2010-04-27T12:40Z,"Unlike Idrone 42 who uses every word under the sun to slag off this movie - I liked it - 

For a VERY inexpensive movie it kept you intrigued, made you think, was a great little movie - not only that it made quite a few peoples top 30 movies of  2009. Oh my tastes are virtually exactly IMDB and ..... IMDB scores it 8/10 therfore why the hate Idrone42 ???"
,pikasaw,2010-04-28T22:24Z,many thanks! :)

If you want to review the movie (and say nothing about this torrent), do it somewhere else. Moreover, at least have the decency to put ""*spoiler alert*"" in your comment."
,rolo_tomaci,2010-06-20T01:52Z,The reason this movie is go good is because of Sam Rockwell's incredible performance.  So often he is the only character on screen and he manages to keep you intrigued.  Excellent film.

Except you really can ignore this, because the Earth is always located above the surface of the opposite side of the moon. They're tidally locked. It has the effect of increasing gravity.

That's a perfectly valid reason.

They wouldn't lose anything. The far side actually receives a little more sunlight than the near side, because it's never eclipsed by the Earth. The moon has no ""dark side"", just a side that's always facing away from us."
,Nightblade88,2010-10-25T13:12Z,"A phenomenal masterpiece of film. Outstanding acting graced with an ethereal ambiance of doubt and hope. If that isn't enough for you then the score (which you hardly notice) will pull you to the edge of your seat before you know you're there.

Thank you once again team FXG!
Perfect visuals and crisp in sync audio.
You guys really are legendary.

Thanx for the upload FXG"
,Roqwell,2011-02-20T13:44Z,@idrone42 - Stop looking for every upload of Moon and writing the same biased piece of shit you've most probably copied and pasted from a website. Please understand everybody has their own opinion so trying to force yours upon others seems a little... sad.
