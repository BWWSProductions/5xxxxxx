Product Description

There's trouble at the Castle, and it's all because Merrin Meredith 
has returned with Darke plans for Septimus. More trouble awaits Septimus 
and Jenna in the form of Tertius Fume, the ghost of the very first Chief 
Hermetic Scribe, who is determined to send Septimus on a deadly Queste. 
But Septimus and Jenna have other plansâ€”they are headed for the mysterious 
House of Foryx, a place where all Time meets and the place where they 
fervently hope they will be able to find Nicko and Snorri, who were 
trapped back in time in physik. But how will Septimus escape the Queste? 

Queste, like all the books in the Septimus Heap series, is filled with 
nonstop action, humor, and fantastical adventure as Septimus continues 
his journey of Magykal self-discovery.
