As of this writing, 124 seeders, 1 leecher. Holy shit."
,1452,2010-03-12T01:38Z,"Thank you so much for this!  Would it be possible to get the song file from the ending(s) of the game, where you die?  It's the nostalgic/sad music that plays with the cinematic.  Thank you in advance if you can put it up here and link me to it!"
,xosuitehearts,2010-03-12T06:08Z,"OP can I re-distribute this torrent?  Or say when we lose seeders do I have your permission to reupload?  I promise I will give credit to you, i gotta know what your user is though so i can give you the credit."
,deepthoughtdevil,2010-03-17T23:50Z,"Thanks for the spoiler, 1452. Really."
,julietalphakiloecho,2010-03-23T08:29Z,"@xosuitehearts Sure, redistribute the hell out of it if you want. No problem with me.

@1452 No idea at all where you could get that music. Unfortunately, I don't really even remember what that song even sounds like."
,kupaman,2010-04-09T19:38Z,"@1452 Search for ""Sounds from the Lighthouse"", it should be in that collection."
