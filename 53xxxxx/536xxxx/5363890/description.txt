The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 14 February 2010

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
...CAUTION -- the first minutes of the first hour
are virtually unlistenable, due to the audio of another 
program effectively drowning out Alex's show.  I recommend
skipping to the 4:38 point and beginning there.
Evidently the audio engineers were on holiday today.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::




The two hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

Today's show, however, consists entirely of previously aired material from multiple earlier broadcasts.



In the 1st hour: 

an interview with James Delingpole, author and journalist for The Daily Telegraph 
[first aired 27 January 2010]
and
an interview with Marc Faber, investment analyst and entrepreneur, who publishes the the monthly investment newsletter The Gloom Boom & Doom Report 
[first aired 26 January 2010].


In the 2nd hour:

a conversation with Red Beckman, father of the Fully Informed Jury Association and co-author of The Law That Never Was: The Fraud of the 16th Amendment and Personal Income Tax [first aired 4 February 2010].

Also in the 2nd hour, though not mentioned in the show description on the Infowars web site, is about four and a half minutes of an interview with Dr. Bruce Levine, , a clinical psychologist in Cincinnati, Ohio. Mr. Levine is the author of Surviving America's Depression Epidemic and Commonsense Rebellion: Taking Back Your Life from Drugs, Shrinks, Corporations, and a World Gone Crazy. Levine provides a compelling alternative approach to treating depression that makes lasting change more likely than with symptom-based treatment through medication. Dr. Levine has been a regular contributor to AlterNet, Z Magazine, and The Huffington Post and his articles and interviews have been published in Adbusters, The Ecologist, High Times and numerous other magazines. He is an editorial advisor for the Icarus Project/Freedom Center Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs and on the editorial advisory board of the journal Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry.
[first aired 10 February 2010].




Insofar as I know, Alex will return with live broadcasts tomorrow [Monday, 15 February 2010], but there has been no announcement of which I am aware.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume support or endorsement on my
 part of all contents. 

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
