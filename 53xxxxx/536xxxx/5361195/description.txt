Please seed (share) these programs. Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks.

Search and Replace is an award winning, easy to use search and replace utility loved by programmers, webmasters, and novice computer users alike.

It can search subdirectories and ZIP files and do case sensitive or insensitive searches. Extensive support for grep style regular expression search & replacements includes operations that span more than one line, incrementing number replacements, and inserting the path & filename in replaced files.

Binary search & replace is also available. You can specify multiple include/exclude file masks and filters based on file date & size.

The program can also launch associated programs on "found" files, e.g., launch your web browser if the search hit occurs in an .htm or .html file.

If you need to find and replace text, or just find text, this utility is a must have. 

It is significantly faster than other Windows grep-only utilities and allows replacing for the same price as those programs which offer only grep capabilities.
