It couldn't even recover a simple password. RAR Password Cracker works fine. Though the crack doesn't seem to work so you are either forced to pay for it, or be limited to only 3 character passwords. Thanks for the upload though, I just wish this program works :("

,manyfiles,2010-11-17T15:31Z,"This program is terrible.  I opened a file with an 8 character password, and it returned a two-character success.  Perhaps this particular release is broken. In any case, the program is far too simple to be particularly useful, especially since it does not have a 'known characters' type of feature.  Also, if you intend to guess a password with more than 4 characters, you probably don't have the resources or seriousness to unlock the file."
,furbieno,2011-01-14T20:07Z,"is there a free program where u can find a password with 8-11 characters, cause i think this program will not help me as i see everyone is talking about the max. of 3 characters.
Btw is it possible to make a dictionary attack, cause I almost know my rar password.. anyone can help me pls??"

,andrei030,2011-03-25T00:53Z,"This program is shit. I set ""1234"" as password and configured the program to search number password, it found pasword as ""Rtf"" or something like that. facepalm.jpg"

,chloeam,2011-09-20T08:45Z,"Well, I do know some RAR Password Recovery tools for my lost WinRAR password last week! Finally, I chose a Password Recovery Bundle which includes RAR, Windows, MSN, etc. password recovery functions! So appreciated for the tool named: Ainorsoft Password Recovery Bundle from http://windowspasswordrecovery.net/password-recovery-bundle.html

I will never worry about forgotten password such as Word, Excel, yahoo mail, etc."

,pripoi,2011-10-18T15:28Z,Doesn't work with RAR's with encrypted filenames. Blech.
,samljer,2012-02-05T20:04Z,"Works fine, but on my guad core CPU running at 3ghz with 4gb memory, 64bit. its only testing about 40/second which means any passowrd with even a little bit of strength to it will take it YEARS to complete. there are other faster  programs out there."
,babambi,2012-02-13T11:26Z,I see that there are some saying this doesnt work. Does this still work????
,katexpero2,2012-03-22T01:17Z,"Very nice, people it works a bit fast if your cpu is dual core or better with + than 2ghz ;)"
