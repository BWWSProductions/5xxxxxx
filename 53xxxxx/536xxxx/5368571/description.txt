UltraMon is a utility for multi-monitor systems, designed to increase productivity and unlock the full potential of multiple monitors. With additional window buttons, you can quickly move windows or stretch a window across the desktop. Use the Smart Taskbar to manage more applications, with a taskbar on each monitor and each taskbar only showing the tasks from the monitor it is on. Shortcut extensions make it easy to position applications on the desired monitor. The UltraMon screen saver and wallpaper manager make it possible to use a different wallpaper and screen saver on each monitor. It also includes a flexible mirroring feature (Windows 2000/XP only), with support for mirroring one or more monitors, and use different resolutions for each monitor.
