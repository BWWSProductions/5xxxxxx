,iamsuperbleeder,2011-02-19T22:21Z,"Download the latest version from UltraMon's web site, and then use the registration info in this torrent when setting it up. Works perfect and I'm using it on Windows 7. Thanks!"

,rk5711,2012-04-24T18:03Z,"Used this for quite a while but noticed I had problems with my network taking a bit longer to load on bootup AND I always had two instances of IE running in Task Manager no matter what I did. 
I uninstalled and switched to Actual Multiple Monitors, but the problems didnt go away until, a few months later, I finally figured out I had to stop leftover ""Realtime"" crap from trying to load. Once I went through the entire registry to remove anything related to ""Realtime"" and ""UltraMon"", all the issues slowing down my machines' bootup time cleared up. Just sayin....in case anyone else has the same issues in Win 7, 64 bit.
Actual Multiple monitors is just way better anyway.  :o)"
