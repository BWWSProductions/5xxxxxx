,Skram0,2011-01-23T21:58Z,"I wish the PS3 would just die. FAT32 is so Windows 98! Come on, it's 2011!

MKVs rock! It's just a container ya know, like a ZIP file. A very versatile format. MKVs kick ass in my HTPC. So far 4TB of movie goodness.

,johne86,2011-05-25T03:06Z,"What i want to know is source of the dish network broadcast, is this the original or the uncunt collector's edtion?. I ask because sometimes cable companies air those special edition type one's, but most of the time it's usually the original theatrical film. "
