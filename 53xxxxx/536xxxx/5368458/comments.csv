,rayyann,2010-02-19T01:02Z,"after taking all the pain and uploading just for the sake of sharing , and seeding for 3 days does'nt mean anything to you. ??"
,crapp6669,2010-02-19T01:35Z,No it doesn't mean anything if there ends up being no seeders 3 days after a torrent is uploaded. If you're not going to continue seeding it until there are other seeders then you might as well delete the torrent cos nobody can download anything at this point.

What an asshole."
