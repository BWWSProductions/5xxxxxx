The first is about 8.5/10 overall rating and the 2nd would be 9-9.5/10! Enjoy!"

The Boondock Saints
--------------------------------
 Audio: 9.5/10 | Video: 8.5/10 


The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day
--------------------------------
Audio: 10/10 | Video: 9.5/10

I've been seeding it but I assume nobody has fully downloaded seeing as I've only uploaded about 2.5GB since I've been seeding since 4 AM this morning. Just made this torrent for people who want to watch the movies back to back and it's not quite working yet."
