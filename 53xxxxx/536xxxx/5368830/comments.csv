,JVIixxster,2010-02-28T14:31Z,no positive comments? :S
,swamiolsson,2010-03-01T13:42Z,"Well, JVIxxster, I used Your keygen for Illustrator. This was after cracking the program with a patch from some other guy who didn't provide a keygen. It works fine, it seems. 
Now we'll see if I get a bucketfull of shit from Adobe after some time. I dont think so, because I've already exhausted the trial period. (Adobe really must be a juicy morsel for crackers, for they take a lot of pain to protect their products. Strange, they dont realize that they should make af cheaper version for private amateurs).
Thank You, friend"
,swamiolsson,2010-03-01T13:45Z,"Or, in short, it works! You've done a okay job with Your keygen.
Thanx again."
,enerses,2010-03-07T19:57Z,Worked perfectly. Small download...no problems with antivirus...provided correct key. Thank you!
,JVIixxster,2010-03-08T18:22Z,"thanks guys for the comments! :D

,pointerr,2010-04-24T00:33Z,"Mac users: open the windows executable as a text, scroll down and tada!"
,capownz,2010-04-27T20:16Z,"This works great 100% clean just like you said, 9/10 on this upload good job."
,spearmann,2010-04-30T13:14Z,This is a Trojan Virus. Do not run this thing.
,spearmann,2010-04-30T13:16Z,this installed Trojan Vundo on my PC.  Luckily my Nortan Security Suite got rid of it fast.
,JVIixxster,2010-05-01T19:23Z,"@ spearman

how could this be a trojan if i made it myself? O.O
sorry everyone for his comment, ignore him ;)"
,parlous,2010-05-04T11:51Z,"This is really pretty and seems to work.  Only needed for Illustrator, goldfish fixed the rest when first installed.  Thank you JVIxxster"
,JVIixxster,2010-05-11T21:48Z,always welcome :)
,voldermort,2010-05-14T03:27Z,this is best ever keygen! I was on the verge of breakdown to crack my Indesign CS4 to retrieve a file and export it to .inx format so I can open it up in a lower version. Thank youJVIixxster! You Rock!!!
,JVIixxster,2010-05-15T09:43Z,"ty :D

you know, after all the picture in this keygen (butterfly) is editted with photoshop ;)"
,Reevoslady,2010-05-17T01:42Z,"This Keygen is awesome, thanks so much for uploading. Oh and for the record...NO TROJAN!!!"
,EARAGOn1,2010-05-25T07:16Z,"Hey,
  Thank you very much for your virtuous efforts toward providing the masses of people with tools that can be used to help inspire others to follow their hearts.  "
,JVIixxster,2010-05-27T19:11Z,"always welcome guys ;)

you know, this is just becouse i think that you should be able to get stuff, if you'd like it.

you shouldn't have to pay a $1000 dollars for some program, which you, after all, arn't gonna  use very mutch"
,HoneyLok,2010-06-17T11:13Z,"Aw thanks :D Still working it downloaded fast too! Definitely a keeper ;) The program went through my security fine as well and no it is definitely not a trojan, and whoever said it was fails at life. Cheers mates"
,warpwar12,2010-06-18T09:19Z,"I scanned it with avg & spybot, no issues running either.

Thanks."
,tboz230,2010-07-15T07:33Z,"absolute keygen perfection. tiny, effective, and doesn\'t freak the anti-virus. i give it a 10."
,TheKingofPirates,2010-07-17T04:40Z,"I downloaded the program, and ran it. It shows 9 buttons, but I only one that says anything is the one on the top in the middle. The Fireworks one. So, in other words I can\'t see any of the buttons except the fireworks one. Does anyone else have this problem?"
,JVIixxster,2010-08-06T12:08Z,"that's weird? :O

you are a windows user right?
i programmed it in windows vista, but it should be compitable with other versions of windows... :S

i mean, the rest of the ppl also used it? :O
what could be a problem is that your not on an admin account (if u use vista), or try to make it comatible with vista if ur on windows 7...

windows 7 wasn't released when i made this keygen, so that might be the problem...

thnx 4 all the comments guys :D"
,JVIixxster,2010-08-06T12:15Z,"if that doesn't work, try to download the ""software multikeygen V1.2"" from my tpb-account.

it should also have the same keys, but it doesn't look very spectaculair... :O"
,Wethair,2011-01-12T18:36Z,Thanx!
,JVIixxster,2011-03-05T10:43Z,"u are allowed to use this 4 everything u want ;)

u need to block connection....
use your firewall or avg internet security with firewall ;)"
,SdfteX,2011-10-01T18:42Z,"Thank You So Much!!!! First Keygen That Actually Worked, If I Had To Pay For This I Would! Lol. I Used It For PS Extended and After Effects! TYSM!"
,serafim_1,2012-04-14T19:22Z,"Bravo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Working PERFECT!!!!!
Good job!"
,pirate_pacman,2012-06-15T11:12Z,"All buttons, except Fireworks, appear blank-white on Windows7 x86 (maybe an isolated case on my outdated machine).

Anyway, with a little lottery-like chancing-around on those blank white buttons, eventually there will be one with a perfectly valid key.

If you can live with those 3-5 extra seconds, this thing can still be confirmed working!

Kodos, JVIixxster. Good work."
,pirate_pacman,2012-06-15T11:13Z,"Wait a minute - did I just write Windows7? Make that Windows XP pro.

Sorry everyone."
,pirate_pacman,2012-06-15T11:58Z,"You'll probably run into the ""Licensing Expired"" thing afterwards (like I did). Pretty frustrating. Feel comfortable that even those with perfectly valid keys have the very same experience.

And thanks again JVIixxster.

Happy pirating everyone.
