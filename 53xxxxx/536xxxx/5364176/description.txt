Once downloaded, unzip the LEGO Star Wars The Complete Saga For Windows 

zip/torrent file onto your desktop. Run the LEGOstarwarscompletesagapcdvd zip file 

in a program like Daemon tools (download link here: http://www.daemon-

tools.cc/eng/downloads) and install the game. After this, unzip the nocdcrack zip 

file into Lego Star Wars- The Complete Saga (C: local disk, Program Files (x86), 

LucasArts, Lego Star Wars- The Complete Saga). DO NOT REPLACE ANY FILES!!!! Place 

the new files into the folder but keep the old .exe and other files or you will 

have to reinstall the whole game! Once you have unziped the no cd crack, create a 

shortcut to the NEW .exe application on your desktop and double click this when 

you want to play. Have fun :)
