,nicks2048,2010-02-15T22:09Z,"sorry about the slow download speeds guys, i'm prettymuch the only seeder at this point (will change soon)."
,janakr,2010-02-21T17:19Z,Is it english ?
,nicks2048,2010-02-25T03:45Z,"Yes, it's for English. Not sure about other languages though."
,t-w-m,2010-02-26T00:25Z,Is this virus free? I hear the RELOADED release had some trojans in setup.exe ja launcher.exe?
,nicks2048,2010-02-26T02:58Z,"As far as I know, yes. I've just bought a new computer and downloaded it. Both my new one and old one never got a virus, so i'm pretty sure there isn't. "
,t-w-m,2010-02-26T10:26Z,"Tried it myself. Nod32 stays silent, and game does work. I haven't played the lego star wars 2 before, but the first one ran perfectly. This complete saga has some framerate drops one some occasions. Not too serious, but my PC should be more than enough for this game."
,ROKKuBOT,2010-03-03T01:59Z,"Its great and all, but when i play the first mission, the screen is REALLY screwed up, and i cant see anything, but the Cantina works just fine..."
,nicks2048,2010-03-11T07:02Z,"t-w-m, I have the same problem, the framerate does occasionally drop, but other than that it should run just fine. As for you ROKKuBot, I sugest uninstalling and re-installing the game. "
,Lachman,2010-03-16T07:39Z,"Please help im first time pc downloader im young it keeps saying that the file is missing i just got a new laptop and i cant unzip the nocdcrack into the c drive cause it says do you want to replace the files i say no it says problem and it wont let me do it please help me ergently !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and it says No disc inserted.
Please insert the original ""LEGOé€Ÿ STAR WARS?: The Complete Saga"" CD/DVD.

,Lachman,2010-03-16T07:49Z,ha i just realised that this was uploaded on my birthday
,pianoman3,2010-03-19T21:18Z,"i read below about the frame rate dropping on some occasions. its slow and choppy right away and doesn't get smooth. i have ""lego star wars original trilogy"" which runs PERFECT so i was assuming this wouldn't be much different. any clues as to why its slow throughout? any tweaking i can do? running windows 7 on a brand new desktop."
,pianoman3,2010-03-20T00:31Z,nevermind. i apologize. it seems to be working NOW. in the cantina maybe a bit slow but otherwise its fine. i made some adjustments in the options for the heck of it. could have fixed it.
,Tatazike,2010-03-29T15:05Z,SEED PLZ !
,Tatazike,2010-03-29T15:05Z,Too slow bro :/
,mahkok,2010-03-30T08:27Z,"Thanks for the upload but... there is NO reason for this to be zipped. It's an ISO and the crack only, no danger of people seeding only part of the game anyway.

Decompressing takes just as much time as downloading. Not really... but still!"
,revanzlayer,2010-05-09T20:42Z,"when i try to start the game it starts but th scren is just black :(

if anyone know how to fix this plz tell"
,Veraster,2010-05-11T03:33Z,"What the FUCK?!?! When I tried to unzip the file it said that I needed 5.99 Peta Bytes of free store space.
Seriouly, what the fucking hell is going on? Did you try to upload the entire internet or something?"
,starwarsiscool,2010-05-13T10:05Z,no working corrupt file zip? what the hack
,smarthyyy,2010-06-15T20:56Z,"help me if i want to unzip the nocdcrack.zip in C: local disk, Program Files (x86), 
LucasArts, Lego Star Wars- The Complete Saga it sats that it can't do that plese help me!!!"
,nogoodnamesleft2,2010-07-31T11:06Z,"When I use WinZip to open the file it works 100% fine.

When I use WinRAR to open the Zip then it says it's corrupt.

So just use WinZip (eg http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5623107/WinZip_Pro.14.5_%28Build_9095%29___Serials_%5BUT%5D)

Haven't installed yet, but at least I could open the file!

Hope that helps."
,jcwiggi,2010-08-18T11:17Z,When my copy finally finished it too said it wasn't a valid zip file. Even in Winzip.
,lobster306,2010-08-24T04:51Z,when i run it says need 271 PB of space needed
,lobster306,2010-08-24T04:52Z,"it says i need 271 PB of space required 
wtf"
,lukeskywalker786,2010-08-24T12:58Z,"Thanks for the upload, hope it works fine. I hope it doesn't have too much framerate drops. When i play Lego Star Wars 2 on my 1.4 ghz laptop with all settings set to medium it plays fine. If it does work i will be seeding."
,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-27T09:38Z,You also need a Gfx card which supports Pixel Shader 1.1 and the software fix for it doesn't work on my box... so lots of time wasted regardless.
,stavros005,2011-03-21T18:16Z,does it works dudes??
,beanb333,2011-06-25T21:21Z,I don't get what's wrong. Doesn't everybody have a couple of 250PB SSDs laying around?
,MatsStr,2011-07-10T21:27Z,Thx  downloading it now  :D   
,MatsStr,2011-07-10T21:28Z,Thx i download it now :D
,PorcelainZell,2011-10-16T11:41Z,"Just use the WinZip to unzip the file, I cant see the other way to prevent error. If you dont want to install WinZip - just use portable version."
