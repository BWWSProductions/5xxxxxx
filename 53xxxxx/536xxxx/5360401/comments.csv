Could you tell a little bit about them, what kind of stories, like mystery, fantasy, romance, ghost flavor, etc, and maybe who wrote the stories? - Oh, and their names?

I know it sounds like a lot of work, but it would really help people decide whether they would be a good match for us, or maybe as a gift for someone else who likes different stories than we do, etc!"
