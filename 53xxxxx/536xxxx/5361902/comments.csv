,Aapelus,2010-03-08T17:30Z,Season 2 is missing episodes!
,kingjim007,2010-05-01T07:26Z,No it is not.  That is why I included an episode guide with the torrent.  This is the complete show including all episodes with episode names to avoid any confusion.
,leonwolfe,2010-05-08T18:03Z,"Season 2 isn't missing episodes, they have been put under season 1.

KingJim: TV.com list your episodes 10 -13 as part of season 2. With season 1 only having 9 episodes, season 2 with the 13 and season 3 with 9 episodes.

According to TV.com, all episodes are in this torrent.. Thanks KingJim."

,miluch,2010-09-11T19:43Z,10x KingJim !!
,DarkThwt,2010-09-11T22:17Z,Excellent! Seeding at 5Megabytes/s for 10 days
,Doople,2010-11-03T08:39Z,"Audio is great, downloaded super fast! video quality isn't super, but good enough. =\"
,honunet,2011-01-14T00:28Z,"thanks for the up first of all.  Size is 125mb per episode so you can guess at quality, it';s pretty bad.  Just watchable, can't make out detail"
,fire_breath,2011-01-21T21:26Z,"Awesome torrent, the episodes are slightly out of order, but they are all there. 'Custody' and 'The Farm' are from season 2, not 3, but I haven't found any other torrent that has all of the episodes so again Great Torrent. Thanks!"
,dougiedouglas,2011-02-14T20:23Z,this torrent is good quality but is mixed up and season three is actually season two aswell. season three isnt here. 
,dougiedouglas,2011-02-14T20:33Z,"season two was desent quality but you have put the first 4 episodes of season two in season one and what youve written in season three is actually season two aswell imdb.com states there were 9 episodes to season one, 22 episodes in season two and 20 episodes for season three thats 51 episodes in all you only have 27 31 here."
,kingjim007,2012-01-09T06:09Z,"At the time of posting this was correct.  This upload in fact takes you to the end of season 2.  After watching these episodes look the s03e01-13 and s04e01-14 episodes.

Cheers,

KJ"
