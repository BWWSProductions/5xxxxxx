Before applying this BIOS please read Dell Community Discussion about it.

despite of all these negative reviews, i'm successfully using this BIOS since 15th Jan 2010 without any trouble at all.

[on my DELL Studio 1555, Intel Core 2 Duo P8600, 4GBs RAM, 512MBs ATI 4750 Mobility Radeon.]

Another point i want to clear is that many ppl r making buzz about DVD eject not working on A08 & A09 BIOS, but the fact is that it works fine, one needs to install Dell Quickset Utility for that.

All the Best!!
