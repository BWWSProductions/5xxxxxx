In June of this year we were fortunate enough to return to Mexico City for three sold out shows at Foro Sol Stadium 
and with 155,000 of you there over the three nights, we knew it would be extra special. 
So we asked our friend Wayne Isham to join us with a film crew and the results of that crazy, magical, 
most memorable long weekend will be available as â€œOrgullo, Pasion y Gloria: Tres Noches En La Ciudad de Mexicoâ€ 
(â€œPride, Passion, and Glory: Three Nights in Mexico Cityâ€).
