Product Description:
SSX Blur brings back the soul of SSX - remixed, re-energized, and fully realized. Revolutionary controls take full advantage of the Nintendo Wii's potential by putting you in total command of your skier or rider. The new On-the-Ground and In-the-Air controls will translate every motion you make into moves that create mountain legends. One hand controls you as you tear down the mountain; the other unleashes your array of aerial maneuvers. The mountain is your playground with SSX Blur. Familiar SSX faces return including Mac, Kaori, Psymon, and Allegra -- plus two all-new hot shot riders
