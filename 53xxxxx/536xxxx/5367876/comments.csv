,mattbdon,2010-02-16T14:43Z,Hi 2040. What is the situation with Big Love? I know you said before that you wouldn't be uploading it but then last week you did. Is there any chance of you doing this weeks episode? Thanks either way mate.
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-16T15:09Z,"@mattbdon: February the 8th... stupid as I am I have noticed - that again and again - either The Scene or eztv missed to upload small version of Big and encoded one as .avi [micro] to satisfy XviD fanatics. 
Well, it was ONLY XviD for a day, a good one, even better than mp4... and what has happened:

784 downloads
762 HIT&RUNS

...and three comments, I remember one from regular lilars, plus another one Thanks plus one guy who have thanked but asked for .mp4 version.

Do you still need an answer?"
,mattbdon,2010-02-16T15:57Z,"Fair enough, thanks anyway for all your hard work man."

It made my day more ?bearable, namely, I fell yesterday pretty bad in my bathroom and cracked my ribcage. It hurts like hell, when I lie down, sit, breathe ? and laugh. So? stop hurting me. 
Many points you?ve made stands, and that one about ?masculine insecurity? I have used last week and it?s proven? 
Further, I am embarrassment, somehow, for many? it does go so far that some uploaders load my torrents just to fuck us all up and make my life harder. Few of them helps, seeding at incredible speeds whenever they can ? and somehow these good ones overcome evil ones, as should be?
I have lost ?my anonymous angels? from name-not-to-be-spoken, silent, never-asked-for-a-thing guys who came as regulars? when I saw host/peer names from kimsufi.com or ovrh.net I knew I?m safe ? and people can feel how is it good when someone can seed at 1000 kB/s. Here ? I have 1 tenth of downloads and sometimes over 92% of Hit&Runs. Have times changed? No. TPB is definitely a different place.
I am embarrassment too because I encode all the files I release. Many, majority here do not, including famous eztv. 90 percent of uploaders are just that ? an uploader and nothing more.
My H264 is embarrassment to many encoders ? because I use H.264 in his spirit, nature. For sake of god H.264 was invented to make files smaller, not bigger, and certainly not as ?700MB or more? replacement for XviD.
As last thing to say, I am embarrassment by defying many rules: one is that one guy, on old PC and with laughable upload speed of 62 kB/s in fact can ?feed? many. I remind you all that I have 300 000-600 000 downloads per month on blown-up star but here only small portion of that."
