Hello,

This is DVDRip of the Lecture delivered by Swami Ramdev ji Maharaj & Rajiv Dixit on 1 June 09.

Rajiv ji tell that how a task seems difficult before its realization , but when it is accomplished it amazes us , by quoting historical facts of various revolutions including the Indian Freedom Fight.

It is my request to you guys to distribute it as much as you can.


Enjoy...

Keep on Seeding......... so as to keep the Patriotic spirit of our young freaks flourishes.





Thanx...
