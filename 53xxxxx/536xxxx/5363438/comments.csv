,g0d,2010-02-15T14:04Z,"I'm groaning with anticipation over this movie. Just seems that the pretty decent (for a superhero film) writing doesn't live up to the stylized animation with the last 3 or 4 DC direct-to-discs....
am i off-base here people? i mean, it's free, and i am a whore, no complaints on that angle... i just feel like a DIRTY whore after i keep getting fucked over ideologically. I mean, please DC, at least look me in the face while you rape my beloved superheroes from me."

,dayravager,2010-02-16T04:24Z,"whaaat, when did lex become a good guy? (i'm a superhero comic dabbler lol)"
,Damascus25,2010-02-16T04:49Z,"@dayravager
The alternate universe version of Alexander Luthor has always been good and all the typical heroes of his planet are bad guys.  He had a full head of red hair and a gold suit of armor/body suit to travel through the multiverse. I does flow with DC continuity even if it's more or less an Elseworlds kind of title. (Based on description, I'll know better after watching the movie)"

Overall not a bad movie, but I don't know why they didn't use the usual voices for batman and superman.

William Baldwin?   sigh."
,Damascus25,2010-02-16T13:00Z,"@ryanrf - That's the exact point I was going to make!!  I love the Bruce Timm art style, I didn't at first, years ago, but now it makes the movie fit in well with the episodes that came before but for heaven's sake the voices they had for Supes and Batman were atrocious.  I was hoping for Kevin Conroy for Batman, but I'd have been fine with just a random sounding dude.  Just don't have a Baldwin voicing characters like that, let them voice the Clock King or someone like that.

@heist - What the hell is a Breath Blocking Thriller?  I've heard of things that are ""Breathtaking"" but never breath blocking."
,shadymilkman,2010-02-16T14:33Z,"I don't know what you guys are talking about. Kevin Conroy doesn't have to do *everything* Batman for them to be good. 

I actually thought William Baldwin did a good job and *especially* James Woods as Owlman. Owlman is one of my new favorite DC villains."
,Josen1,2010-02-16T16:24Z,.BONE: is the man
,spawnvader,2010-02-17T07:33Z,"Enjoyed the movie.  Thanks for the up!

Great quality mediocre film though, thanks."
,sammaful,2010-02-17T21:39Z,massive justice league fan so big thanks bone :-)
,sentient1,2010-02-18T05:45Z,Thanks friend
,Anvil11,2010-02-18T07:43Z,"Seems like they have a thing for the Baldwins>

In Superman the animated series Adam Baldwin was considered for the role of Superman/Clark Kent, but he ultimately proved unavailable, so the part went to Tim Daly instead. Baldwin later voice-played Superman/Clark Kent for Superman: Doomsday (2007).

Awesome Upload mate...
The movie really does rock...keep up da gud work"
,Lathlas,2010-02-18T17:35Z,@Avil11: Adam Baldwin isn't one of the Baldwins. He's just a guy with the last name Baldwin.
,Anvil11,2010-02-19T00:02Z, my mistake
