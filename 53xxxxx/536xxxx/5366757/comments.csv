,anime991,2010-02-18T18:33Z,what a bunch of crap! If you're going to share then do it right. Why are you wasting everyone's time and bandwidth? You suck.
,anime991,2010-02-18T18:39Z,Oh My God. I'm so sorry. I commented on the wrong file. I've never even downloaded this one. I meant to comment on Dantes.Inferno.An.Animated.Epic (2010) 480p-BRRiP-XviD. That bitch has her torrent password protected and sends you off to some f**cked up site. 
,Vickylovely,2010-02-21T14:14Z,Yep.  I can confirm that this is a RAR file that is passworded.
