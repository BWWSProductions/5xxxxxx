A whole new world of hurt! Betrayed by Earthâ€™s heroes and exiled into outer space, the man-monster Hulk has landed on the distant planet Sakaar, ruled by the tyrannical Red King. Sold into slavery, Hulk becomes the Green Scar, the planetâ€™s mightiest gladiator â€“ but his new masters get more than they bargained for. When Earthâ€™s superheroes exile the volatile Incredible Hulk to a distant planet called Sakaar, the muscle-bound green monster is sold into slavery and forced to compete in gladiatorial games for the planetâ€™s despotic Red King. But soon, the Hulk joins forces with his fellow slaves to fight for freedom â€” and a chance to get revenge on his earthly foes. This animated film is based on the â€œPlanet Hulkâ€ storylines originally featured in Marvel comics.
