,salo99,2010-02-15T06:16Z,"This information is from the english subtitles file linked to in above comment. It's a new restoration incorporating additional footage recovered in 2008 - 

Adopted from 2002 R1 Kino Video DVD
release and Google Translate
The film ""Metropolis"" was heavily edited
and abridged shortly after its premier.
About 1/4 of the film was considered lost
forever. Only in 2008, in Buenos Aires, 
was a nearly-complete copy discovered.
Unfortunately it was in terrible condition
and a cropped 16 mm version.
A substantially complete reconstruction was
made using the Argentinian material
and material from the previous restoration.
Spanish intertitles were identified using
censor cards translated into German. To
accurately portray the correct position
of the cropped images, black borders
have been added to them.
The Intertitles appear in their original
font. Intertitles with a different typeface
(like this one) have been added to
summarize the plot of missing segments.
Black film stock indicates shorter
sections of missing footage.
An Ufa production
Distributed by Parufamet."
