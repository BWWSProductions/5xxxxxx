BBC R4 Documentary - Kurt Weill's 'Threepenny Opera'
Presented by Huw Edwards
Produced by Paul Evans
Broadcast October 18, 2005
Coded from tape at 128/44.1

Another in the BBC's intermittent series: 'The Real
History Of Opera', in which Huw Edwards sets an opera
in its contemporary context.

Kurt Weill based the 'Threepenny Opera' on John Gay's
1728 'The Beggar's Opera', a satirical swipe at London
society, Robert Walpole and Handel.

Huw Edwards looks at how much of the original opera's
stance was retained, and why the material was so relevant
to Weimar Germany audiences.
