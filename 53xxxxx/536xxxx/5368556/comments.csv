If you insist: .001 to .whatevernumber is a RAR-archive, or more exactly parts of one.
Inside there are an ISO-file (File-standardization, an exact digital copy of the contents of a CD-/DVD-disk or other medias of conforming standards) - To use that .ISO, .IMG or whatever (Pretty much most of these kinds of releases with this filing-system using WinRAR, are ISO-files!), you can either burn it with your favorite burning-program such as Nero, or the better IMGBurn (If you're unsure where to get it, and failed Google, you might try www..com... If you even failed that one, try changing """" for ""imgburn"", without the quotation marks ("")). That's a better program and also simpler to use, but it's not for everyone though!"

I meant "".r01"", otherwise I'd mean WinACE which is the original program used for those, or at least as far as I can remember... That would also be as far back as Windows-environments are concerned. DOS, UNIX/LINUX-environments may have had their resp. third party programs, so fuck that..."

I find it funny how you're calling some a dumbass when you can't even get the most basic grammar right."
