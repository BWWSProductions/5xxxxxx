,enzen0,2011-01-20T02:57Z,"Thanks for the upload. :) I had downloaded the APE version a while back and I was hoping that there was a better FLAC version. Heck yes, FOSS. Always makes me happy when something uses Open Source. Linux FTW. Did you use RubyRIpper to rip this?"
,loljk,2011-07-13T02:45Z,As soon as this is done downloading I vow to seed this permanently. This is the best OST in video gaming history.
,Bitmaster,2011-09-24T17:14Z,"enzen0: It's been a while now, but I'm pretty sure I used the command line all the way for ripping. Not sure, though.

All that's left now is to make a native game binary for GNU/Linux... :)"
,ProphetZarquon,2011-12-02T20:33Z,"That does it:  I'm starting a seedbox.  Thank you for this!  I can't even find my hard copy of this album anymore, and I almost thought I'd never hear the bonus tracks again.

I appreciate the morals behind FLAC, but I'm happy enough with MP3's compatibility.  I wish the deck in my truck played FLAC...  I may re-up this in 320kbps mp3 VBR.  (The other UL on TPB has no bonus tracks.)

Once again, best soundtrack album ever.
Bitmaster, you are now on my hero list."
