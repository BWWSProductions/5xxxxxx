Story:

Join the Rogue Squadron!
It is a time of great rejoicing in the galaxy. Luke Skywalker, with the help of Wedge Antilles, has blown up the Death Star. Now, the Empire is gathering strength for an all-out assault on the Rebel forces. To save the Rebel Alliance, Luke and Wedge have assembled the Rogue Squadron, 12 of the most skilled starfighter pilots. You will fly into battle as Luke Skywalker, to engage in intense, fast-paced planetary air-to-ground bombing runs, rescue assignments, and more.

FEATURES:

 * Take on the Galactic Empire in X-wings, Y-wings, A-wings, V-wings and snowspeeders

 * Prove you've got what it takes against a slew of the Empire's best and baddest, including AT-AT walkers, AT-STs, TIE fighters and more.

 * Test your flying skill through extra-ordinary environments--over water, through canyons, deserts, and volcanic regions.
