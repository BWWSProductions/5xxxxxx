I'm in the mood for some new agefaggotry, so I'll post some of my findings in this genre. This one's called Songs of Hope and Healing, and it is from Michael Stribling. Hope you like it.

Also, I'll post a Dean Evenson album tomorrow or the day after that, depending on how soon I will get the missing songs.
