Many thanks TvTeam, most of us appreciate your work and the variety of programs you release."

 You've got all your episodes mixed up. 1 is Mercury and Venus, 2 is Mars, 3 is Jupiter, 4 is Saturn 5&6 the rest and beyond. It works from the sun outward. Though I believe there is an upload claiming to be E1 which is in fact E4 on Saturn."
