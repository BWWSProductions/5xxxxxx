         Bianca Stratford is dying to go out with Joey    
         Donner the babe of their school. Kat Stratford   
         would rather die than go out with a boy. Mr.     
         Stratford has this rule where Bianca can         
         date... when Kat does. Bianca begs her sister    
         to have a night of "teenage normalcy" Little     
         does Bianca know that not only Joey is trying    
         to set her sister up but also Cameron her        
         cute, but also unpopular French tutor. Joey      
         and Camereon's "set up guy" Patrick is trying    
         to get Kat to go out with him. But does it       
         work, will Kat go out with him? Will Bianca go   
         out with Joey?

     Please use the mkv2bluray.exe in order to create a bluray         
     structure or create a iso image.                                  
     Follow the easy instructions with in the exe and enjoy your movie.

     IGUANA feels its best to only include English subtitles + 1       
     optional subtitle language in the iso image or bluray structure.  
     You will have a subtitle language choice in our mkv2bluray.exe.   
     We feel the rest of the groups should do the same in order to     
     keep the video bitrate as high as possible.
