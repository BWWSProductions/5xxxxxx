,Mandabar,2010-02-16T15:30Z,"Awesome, Thanks! Still having audio sync issues when playing on MPC-HC (The ONLY player I use on my computer). Using CCP Codecs. Has anyone found out what to do to fix this since SM made his change a few weeks ago in his encoding process?"
,rudavites,2010-02-16T22:45Z,THANK U KING ^_^
,darin_god,2010-02-17T03:30Z,"The sync is perfect, always has been.

I play his movies on ps3.

If you have a sync problem, then its not the movie.

I'm 100% on that."
,kdavies9688,2010-02-17T21:30Z,"Awesome quality as usual :) 

As for the sync issues if u arnt playing it on xbox or ps3 get VLC player its  imo best media player out there and never had any ussies player any type of media on it"
,herniator,2010-02-18T02:18Z,"Yo secret_myth.  Your uploads are great; I get most of your torrents.  Only problem is I noticed they all exhibit a problem called black crush.  The detail in dark or shadowed areas is lost, and there is no way to fix it using levels or gamma or anything.  I was thinking it was my system not displaying the correct colorspace for HD content, but after much experimentation, and downloading other versions of movies you uploaded to compare with (including DVDrips and full 4GB 720P BRrips), I am now sure it is a problem with the encode.  I can upload example screen shots if needed.  Reply on this page if you read this."
,raj88,2010-02-18T04:29Z,"mr. herniator,,if getting hq free movies isn't enough for u,go &buy original br discs.......& stop bothering our legend..........."
,herniator,2010-02-18T06:37Z,"There's a difference between constructive criticism and useless complaining.  Fixing this would benefit anyone who downloads secret_myth releases.  Makes dark scenes very hard to watch.  For example in Public Enemies, the original movie was full of very dark scenes, and the secret_myth version was almost pitch black much of that time."
,primaryrip,2010-02-19T02:04Z,have to agree.. recent releases seem to be too dark... but secret myth is still king!
,shia88,2010-02-21T03:38Z,"great quality! am seeding too!
thanks for sharing, secret_myth "
,herniator,2010-02-21T08:37Z,"@gatormatt

I watch on PC, using MPC, VLC, WMP11, Windows Media Center 7 all the same.  FFDShow, DXVA, and Windows Media Foundation codecs all output same problem, both to LCD monitor and CRT TV.  Definitely on the encode end.  The problem originates with TVs using 16-235 levels and PCs using 0-255, and software and hardware not correctly converting the levels.  Shame, cuz secret_myth rips are the best for their size, but unfortunately movies with many dark scenes become hard to watch."
,herniator,2010-02-21T08:39Z,"Maybe PS3 does a better job, using HDMI with its different options.  Don't know because I don't have one."
,Superman169,2010-02-21T09:47Z,Thank you very much secret your the best keep em comin and i'll keep downloading them thanks again
