FRAY released a new album from Lightspeed Champion plus a bonus cd which features 5 live songs. The album will be released on February 16, 2010.
This album deserves a listen, especially if you like indie/rock.

Lightspeed Champion, the incredible brain child of former Test Icicles guitarist Dev Hynes, has returned with his second album, Life is Sweet! Nice To Meet You. The follow-up to 2008â€™s Falling Off the Lavender Bridge is an epic collection of twelve pop songs, two instrumental intermissions and one piano Ã©tude. Life is Sweet! Nice to Meet You reflects Devâ€™s voracious but discriminating Pop taste. He draws on baroque 60â€™s pop, Girl Group harmonies, classical music, joltingly 70â€™s guitar and synth sounds, classical piano, Serge Gainsbourg, Greek choruses, Todd Rundgren, and even musical theatre.
