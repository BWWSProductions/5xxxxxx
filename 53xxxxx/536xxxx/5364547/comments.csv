,rikee,2010-06-16T17:13Z,"Excellent work Stun... A6 works great. 
Pioneer 112 firmware 1.28 and ImgBurn on Verbatim DVD-R... 
Thanks again"
,romo23,2010-07-03T15:47Z,"Works great on my A6 2006 sedan (limousine). I used ImgBurn, Vebatim DVD-R ver2.1/1x-16x, speed for actual burning 4x and I have MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ-862 on my notebook. 

Just took out the onld DVD, put in the burned one, started the car and the MMI asked whether I wanted to update the software. Took about 5 minutes to get it updated. Now it is running smoothly.

Thank you Stun, great work."

,gugugalnoot,2010-08-18T02:34Z,"@mariootje
Maybe you have a model later than august 2009? Then they started working with MMI and harddisk instead of DVD navigation. Just check.
I have only problems getting it burned with Toast, maybe I should try on Windows."
,nlros,2010-09-01T19:33Z,"Can anyone tell me what files to burn, because all the files seems too much for a dvd-r 4.7GB. Or do I leave the iso file unwrapped? Thanx"
