!!!... For ... HTC Touch-Pro ... ONLY ...!!!

Build 23529 

[ROM][WWE][7-Feb-10] Timolol's stock-like WM6.5 b23529 ROM for Touch Pro
 

The rationale behind this ROM was to make it clean and stock-like. It was made for the HTC Touch Pro and is my interpretation of what a WM 6.5 ROM would be like if HTC had designed it themselves (minus Manila/TF3D). Only HTC applications (or applications which have been included in official HTC ROMs) have been included in this ROM, and any third-party applications must be installed by the user. No custom themes, icons or fonts have been included in this ROM in keeping with the stock-like philosophy. Everything that you might expect HTC to include in their official ROMs (with the exception of TF3D) has been included, in addition to all standard WM6.5 features. Another goal in this ROM was to keep it as bug-free as possible and thus the absolute latest and usually buggy versions of applications may not be included. I have used the latest bug-free versions of applications.

This ROM is similar to Da_G's clean ROM, except it is customised for the Touch Pro, and includes more HTC applications than his ROM. These include the HTC Comm Manager, new Tachi HTC Calculator, HTC Album, MP3 Trimmer, Rhodium Power Off Warning, Rhodium Connection Setup plus others. .NetCF 3.5 and Opera Mobile browser are also included in this ROM. This ROM is UC enabled.
