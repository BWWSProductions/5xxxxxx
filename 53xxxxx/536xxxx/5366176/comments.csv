can i ask what sites you upload your torrents on, besides PirateBay, Demonoid, and OneBigTorrent (sometimes) ?  I ask because your torrents seem to have so many seeders.. wandering what other sides are good to cross-post my torrents on to get a good healthy swarm of seeders and leechers like your torrents."

They sometimes(not always) have lot's of seeds and that's due to users getting used to your torrents after long time and trust the content.  My advise is don't worry if you don't have enough seeds or peers, as long as you do your part by uploading quality content, then people will find you and download your torrent and help you to seed. BTW yes this is from tvo."
