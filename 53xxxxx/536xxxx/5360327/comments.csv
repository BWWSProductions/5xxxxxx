,RetroGamerX3,2010-02-14T17:24Z,"it works on 5.00 M33, but you have open the iso with UMDGen and extract ""tactics.prx"" from the folder ""USRDIR"". Then you rename ""tactics.prx"" to ""tactics.bin"". Once you do that you can use Eboot Bin Patcher 1.0 to patch the ""tactics.bin"" file. After it has been patched rename it back to ""tactics.prx"" and add the file back to the iso with UMDGen. When it asks you if you want to replace the ""tactics.prx"" file just say yes or watever. Ive tested this myself and it wrks 100%. =D"
