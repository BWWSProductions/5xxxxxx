Unlike many of his peers, who work overtime to perpetuate hard-living country 
singer myths, Kenny Chesney never tries to be anything other than what he is. 
On "Keg in the Closet," for example, he reminisces in great detail about his fraternity ... 
Full Descriptiondays in the late 1980s, something no self-conscious outlaw wannabe would 
ever attempt. On the similarly nostalgic "I Go Back," he's not afraid to reference 
John Mellencamp's "Jack & Diane" and Billy Joel's "Only the Good Die Young" (overtly) 
and Don McLean's "American Pie" (via a Chevy/levee rhyme), songs that probably influenced 
him as much as anything coming out of Nashville. The truth-in-advertising mode continues on 
"Being Drunk's a Lot Like Loving You," one of WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN's best songs. Here the 
usual drinking-song metaphorical process is switched around, so that Chesney's using drunkenness 
to symbolize immersion in a relationship instead of reeling off clever lines about getting drunk. 
With Kenny Chesney, the pop side of the pop/country amalgam never seems abashed, and the fusion 
of the two seems easy and organic
