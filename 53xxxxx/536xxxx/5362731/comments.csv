Now I started after unselecting the last album and this seems to work... (except that I'm missing the last album of course)
Did anyone else have the same?"
,kagator,2010-02-16T16:33Z,"same problem here. And the speed is sooooo slow. I hope the seed will upload the corrected version of last album.
thanks for all the rest :)"
[T],willrain,2010-02-16T18:59Z,"Album is correct. I think that you have a problem because Windows don't support ""..."" sequence in filenames - but this problem not exist for Linux or Mac users. So, there is two ways:
- You can download torrent under Linux ;) (or ask somebody) and rename last directory 
- I can upload last album separately later, especially for Windows users :-D

The speed is low because i'm seeding for ~700 peers and i have only 4 Mbits/sec link."
,kagator,2010-02-16T20:10Z,Thanks willrain. I've found the third option. :) Utorrent have an option in context menu for Relocate the Files that don't download in windows for this error. In Tab File > Right mouse button over filename > select another folder.
[T],willrain,2010-02-16T23:16Z,"Ok, cool :)"
,sx99997,2010-02-17T01:34Z,"I'm now also using the third option, thanks for that info kagator, and thanks for sharing the albums willrain"
,the_metalgamer,2011-04-26T20:48Z,Can someone please seed this torrent.
