   Few words: if FINNQUEST torrent uled is some other than me, it might be fake ,so be careful!

  ( ex. If movie has came in theater just ,there can't be DVDRIP ...so you can use your own brains too.)
   If movie is in theater still, you can found here files tagged ,cam,TS ,TC,DVDSCR and Workprint ,
   and little after that, R5(DVD).with line audio ,real DVDRIP comes usually 3 months-1yr after theater date.
   Depends on country and movie too.
   Some can correct if i'm wrong.
