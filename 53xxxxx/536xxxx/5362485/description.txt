RELEASE INFORMATION

Recycled is a well established group that has the sole purpose of
bringing the INT releases that you want to hear, in HQ VBR scene
standard Lame 3.97 (V2 --vbr-new). Not everyone has access to albums
that were released several years ago and sceners are sick of searching
networks with different crappy bitrates from several sources.

And last but not least, if you enjoy a release then go out and buy
it, we did....


Remember, everyone needs to RECYCLE.


R.I.P. OSR (2005)

recycled.int@gmail.com --- DO NOT mail us and ask where you can get our releases
or ask us to mail you some shit. Your mail will get "recycled".


Anyone that knows us, knows that we got nothing but love for all the groups and
what they do, but we would like to send a big FUCK YOU to Resurrected_INT. Why
don't you spend a little time and come up with a name on your own? Rather than
biting on a well established crew.
