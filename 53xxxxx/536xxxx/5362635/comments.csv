,Mr320,2010-03-03T05:09Z,I see now that you said it was not 320 in the description. You are able to go back and change the title though.
,merethan,2010-07-18T14:36Z,"?If you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable, well, so do we. And the fact that EMI informed us that not only aren't they going to pay us AT ALL but that we are still 1.4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier.?   -Jared Leto"
,LaciBug,2011-05-03T22:28Z,Does it have the covers they did?
,TheJsyJms,2012-03-16T04:18Z,"YO..  Mr. Leto, sir.   I'm very sorry to meet you this way.  Your music is some of my very favorite.  And until I had all my CD's stolen from me not so recently.  I've been at this torrent thing.  Since you guys came on the scene early this century along with others like 311, Tool, and you were friends w/ Puddle of Mudd, right?   Well, should I have to go and buy all your albums again?  This sucks, considering I had thousands..  Exhem.  Thousands stolen.  And no, none were backed up.  Am I suppose to have to.  Anyway.  I try mostly to keep it to the ones i already owned.  Does that make me wrong to dl and own it again>?   Sincerely, TheJsyJms"
