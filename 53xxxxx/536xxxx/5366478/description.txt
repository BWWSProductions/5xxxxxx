A racing title that takes players into a
post-apocalyptic not-too distant future where

violent entertainment. The main event, The Survival
Race, is a deadly combat racing tournament that
draws the worlds best drivers to compete in
weapons-laden hot rods! Gamers will drive, battle
and try to survive in races that take place in
twisted future versions of the planets biggest
cities!
