I converted this from the original DVD torrent that is now dead and gone. I put the relevant info in the torrent from the original seed. Converted this for my own use on my iPod so I can rock out at work! This is a must have show for any Iron Maiden fan as far as I'm concerned. Enjoy, it's like 3 1/2 hours long!
