Tragically, however, the cd-key generator, has a virus on it. Norton flagged it not in the scan, but when the program auto-runs, and while its mounted to the drive. Norton flags it as a Info.Gampass.

Oddly enough, this is probably THE single most elaborate trap I've ever seen. The program is really there (it also works properly), and the virus only gets on your computer when you use the key-gen. If you want the program, its there, but then you better hope your anti-virus can catch the virus.

I suppose that is the danger you face when involved in piracy.

Good Luck."

,sparebank1,2011-02-10T22:39Z,Use Sandbox if its infected or you think it is :)
,technosailor,2011-03-05T14:41Z,"Norton, that is the virus, use COMODO.

Probably a false positive, or some keygens are flagged as viruses, when they're not or don't have any, they get flagged because they're ""anti-software"" programs.

Version 3.0.1 by any chance?"
