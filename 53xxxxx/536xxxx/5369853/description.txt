Movie Notes:

Primer was filmed in five weeks.
It was produced on a budget of only $7,000 and a skeleton crew of five.
Shane Carruth acted as writer, director, producer, cinematographer, editor, and music composer.
Many of the characters are played by his friends and family.

After principal photography, Carruth took two years to fully post-produce Primer. He has since said that this experience was so arduous that he almost abandoned the film on several occasions.
