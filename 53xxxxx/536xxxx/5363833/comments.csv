[V],twentyforty,2010-02-15T01:42Z,"@Demise69: I did few hours ago. It's beautiful movie - but unfortunately - a CAM with heavy flickering. Somebody's CAM has been mislabeled as Workprint and circles around net.
On original source I have done everything I know and I can, but even if it looks better, I cannot afford to release such problematic encoding.
I can up the sample alone and anyone can compare it to any other encode of this great movie."

,Alecssei,2010-02-16T22:59Z,"Hi there 2040,

I must admit I admire you a lot, for taking your time and sizing those movies of yours into such little flies ... great work!

Could I have a request? I've been looking for 'California Suite' (with Maggie Smith) everywhere, but I couldn't find it. Would you uploaded it in the near future?

Thanks in advance (even if you can't),

Kind regards,

Alexey"
