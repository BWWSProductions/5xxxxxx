Claire Trevor does it again in this A-noir: its that priceless, white-hot moment when she realizes the amorality she finds so exciting and provocative in her lover extends to wanton murder.

In a commentary on this movie, it was mentioned that directors sometimes used a double for Lawrence Tierney in his fight scenes, not because he might get hurt, but because he sometimes *wouldn't stop fighting* when the director yelled "cut!" That menacing persona shows up in this movie, and compliments the theme perfectly.
