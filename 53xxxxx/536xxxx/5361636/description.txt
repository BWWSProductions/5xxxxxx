Drama series about a team of forensic pathologists.

Leo is stopped for drink driving and finds himself having to do community service in a rough part of South London, answering to a tough-talking community worker named AJ who is not happy to be saddled with a 'drunk whitey'.

Leo tries to keep his head down, do his hours and get out. But when one of the lads is stabbed near their playing fields, Leo steps in and saves the boy's life, winning him new respect from AJ and the kids.

Nikki, meanwhile, investigates the death of a young girl from the same area who, it seems, was murdered.
