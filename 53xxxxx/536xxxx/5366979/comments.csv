There are some things to pick up, but Kernspecht, while highly skilled, is very arrogant in my opinion. There is no ""myth"" connected to the wooden dummy. The performance of the wooden dummy techniques seems very stiff as well. I uploaded it merely to share some WT stuff for my fellow practitioners out there. Hope it is useful to you. "

All the best, will seed."
