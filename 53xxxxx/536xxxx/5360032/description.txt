[Release Notes]
After full focus on Miami, Ibiza, Amsterdam and Toronto, Markus Schulz
announces the new clubbing Mecca with a two disk ode to Las Vegas - the
city where anything really can happen. A fitting source of inspiration to
the man that has seen big things happen to him over the past few years.
The current number 8 DJ in the critically acclaimed DJ Mag Top 100 was
chosen 'Best American DJ' at the IDMA's, saw his 'Do You Dream' and 'The
New World' become the official anthems of two major events, unleashed his
Dakota alias with the 'Thoughts Become Things' album and kept his speed
by clocking one fabulous gig after another. Anything does happen to
Markus Schulz.

For Markus Schulz, Las Vegas has been one of the most influential and
inspirational cities he has played over the past 12 months. Markus:"Las
Vegas has been a big part of my year. When it came time to pick the next
city in the series, it was the first one that came to me. There is this
vibe in Vegas that anything is possible. Like the cab driver can hit the
million dollar jackpot and tomorrow be living like a king. I wanted to
bring the bling-bling, the over the top vibe that I feel every time I go
there, to my compilation."

Bling-bling may not be the first thing you associate 'Las Vegas '10'
with, but a selection of deep proggy beats and warm melodic infusions of
trance might do. Chunky, fresh tracks by upcoming talents like Shogun,
Skytech and Ummet Ozcan set forth the Las Vegas sound and mingle amongst
the unreleased but 2010-defining tracks by names such as Max Graham, Mike
Foyle, Arnej and Markus himself under his Dakota alias. With 'Las Vegas
'10', Markus Schulz shows that what happens in Vegas, doesn't always have
to stay there.
