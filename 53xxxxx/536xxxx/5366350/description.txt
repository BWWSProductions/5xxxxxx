Pink Floyd live at the Stadio delle Alpi, Turin, 13th September 1994.
This footage is shot from the crowd, stage left in the stands, and some distance from the stage. As a result the pictures leave a little to be desired, but the camera audio has been carefully replaced with a high-quality stereo recording taken from the soundboard. Some patches to the pictures have been inserted from an alternative audience-shot version from stage right and this second camera is also used for tracks 9, 11 & 12 in the absence of the primary source. Produced in memory of Wojtek and brought to you from the nice people at Yellow Cow Records, with big thanks to IFWT (for sharing the video sources) and the tapers (for having the nuts to take a video camera to a gig).

*The audio for 'Money' has a short patch from an audience source. 'One Of These Days' also has a very short audience-recorded audio patch.
