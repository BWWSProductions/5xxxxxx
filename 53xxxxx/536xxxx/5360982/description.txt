R&B recording artist and model.Born in Saint Michael, Barbados, Rihanna moved to the United States 
at the age of 16 to pursue a recording career under the guidance of record producer Evan Rogers. 
She subsequently signed a contract with Def Jam Recordings after auditioning for then-label head Jay-Z.
In 2005, Rihanna released her debut studio album, Music of the Sun, which peaked in the top ten of the 
Billboard 200 chart and features the Billboard Hot 100 hit single "Pon de Replay". Less than a year later,
