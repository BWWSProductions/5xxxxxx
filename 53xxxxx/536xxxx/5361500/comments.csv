,lotanique,2010-07-01T11:55Z,"I've never even thought of Yazoo live boots.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Please seed for apparently the only nutter old enough to recognize the value of this.  If this was your first gig, did you record latter ones?  And how did you record this?  The mind boggles with geeky questions..."
[T],renman,2010-07-28T02:09Z,"This was the first gig Yazoo did in London and sadly the only one I went to. First gig was in 81 to see Depeche mode at the Venue in London. Got a botty of that somewhere but the quality is a bit poo and Talk talk I think.
Hmmm I'll dig Yazoo out again and start seeding again.  I used a bloody state of the art Akai hand held I believe."
