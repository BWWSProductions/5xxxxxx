What do you think, is it worth the dl? Ah, 15 Gig of Bullshit n about 10.000 leechers?Maybe you can look at youtub (e) for gameplay, or just type in the google bar the name of the game.

@ what was it,?  chaotic children?
If u r too stupid to use cracks, go buy the game. You dont need alc 120, or deamon tools, you can use any emu you want. Whats the prob with it? just click on the ISO Image, and use it like a fucking DVD (or CD). If u want only direkt play games, you got to wait, or go n buy that game.EDont be so fucking impertinent and DEMAND what ever YOU like here. The guys do that for free, that means, hours n hours of work, TAHT YOU CAN PLAY GAMEAS FOR FREE. Just take it and say thanks like ur mom teached you.

For all the SEED yellers, look, there are 185 Seeders, n 10000 leechers, what do you expect? 450 kbs? you wont get it, even if the half of the seeders unlock theyr up.

I think (but i am not that sure) ithey mean, the emulated DVD drive, that one you selected for emulation.
You emulate the ISO with your ISO Program, like Alc 120, Deamon tools, etc. If u select a drive (or two in this case, then this is your DVD Drive, the SID File must be in the game folder, or maybe in Razors Folder. right mouse click, open. then search for the file.
Hope this helps, 
Pat"
,bozman47,2010-02-17T17:50Z,"@fcuk reality

When installing the Game it will ask for the SID file because some newer games are coded to look for files in your CD Drive and considering you're emulating it wont recognize them. So these files are located on the emulated CD Drive (ISO). Browse to them and it should install fine. "

,sam11223,2010-02-20T23:14Z,"Well guys, i've downloaded the game, played it, finished 80% of the story, still got the alien part to finish

At first, I didnt like the marine's gameplay, looked ""stuck up"", but after I finished playing him, and restarted the campaign, I really enjoyed it.

You really need to be A huge Aliens / predator movies fan, cuz I freaking love this game.

As the marine, you've got some really spooky campaign mission, one word, great. If you listen closely to the music, you'll hear some that is taken from the aliens movies, gave me a hard on when I heard it (A scene when you can hear it, is when you put Tequila in the freezer (stasis pod) stay next to her, and look at her, you'll hear what Im talking about!)

As for the predator, if you like to hunt aliens and humans like animals, you will love the thermal vision, and later in the game you'll get the alien vision. really, really beautiful, trophy kill are great.

And finally as for the alien, well I never liked playing it, even in AvP 2 by monolith games, sierra... which by the way you MUST play, really good game, and in some aspects even better than this one ! (only 1.2 gb ! ) but I must say that I'm REALLY disappointed, because you don't get to play as a facehugger, then a larva, instead of that you just start as a full grown alien. (Which is not the case in AvP2... :D )

Well to put it in a few words, you will love the game if you like the movies, and especially the story of the species. Don't forget to get Aliens vs Predator 2, really it's worth it, even if it's old like win 98SE :p

Have fun playing ! Great game ! Great release, thanks Razor1911 !"

,RomeoKiller,2010-02-21T08:51Z,Theres a problem with this game because the game is installed manually with the razor installer the all the crap you would need for the game like directX and phycX or visual++ doesnt install so you have to somehow find out manually what ur missing and install it if you dont as a marine or alien you wont be able to play it will lag right away and the environment will be missing also the pred missions with let you go though the training without a problem untill u get to the 1st misson then the same thing happens as marines and aliens so untill theres a patch or something this game is unplayable sadly my computer meets all the requirements plus some so running it isnt the issue the game its self i the issue

1. if you have problem with your sound just update Direct X drivers , it worked for me :)

2. if you get the problem when it tells you that it is wrong configured and you must reinstall.
go to the place where you installed the game and in the folders --> redist --> VC --> double click the file in there and install ^^ done N done

Hope this solved your problems !  "

For anyone experiencing the ""missing text"", null, missing menu text, no menus, can't get off floor, nothing happens, zomg wtf, bug: I've solved it. 

Razor1911 didn't pack the game as well as they could have, so the installation isn't fully compatible with some software running. Programs like RAM optimizers, cleaners, etc. will drop files during the unzipping. Simply DELETE your current crap installation, then reinstall. Reinstalling over the same folder will not overwrite the corrupt files. 

I am running windows 7 x64 with a shitty 9500GT but a sw33t@55 Q9400 and I approve of this solution. "

,AkaPhsyco,2010-03-01T11:52Z,"Hey MPAA you ever heard of innovation? 

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding. 

Thanks for your time and enjoy your content.
And thanks to all the up loaders like AiTB w/out people like them, none of this would be possible!"

Thanks for uploading it.... SEEDING it."

,Serv-Bear,2010-07-06T20:17Z,"Right ok got it installed fine :)

Those that cant figure out how to use the install you need to mount the game with any image tools program like Deamon tools then open the virtual disk then run the Razor installer when it asks you for those sid files you need to link it to them :) then once installed copy over the files in the razor1911 file then play :)"
,Serv-Bear,2010-07-06T20:50Z,right it just crashes right after the intro to the mariens misson :(

,Enkious,2011-10-12T00:36Z,"I found a fix. THIS MIGHT HELP anyone using Vista, or 7.
Go to your sound options, then go to the tab ""Play back"" im using win7 btw.
Click speakers, or your default sound.
then click properties, 
Go on over to the ADVANCED tab.
Make your default formate say
24 bit, 48000 HZ (Studio Quality)
click ok, and restart the game.
If your game still crashes, Set your Video options, in game to default, Restart the game, and DO NOT TOUCH your brightness level.
Lower your graphics if needed. but keep your brightness the same."

,just1aim,2012-07-13T09:49Z,"i had a problem as well.....
 the razor installer/ sim pack
is set to install disk one and two ..
there is only disk one!

after fooling with it...... you click all files when browsing for the .sid file....then you can see them..... but to no avail did i figure the actual target...thus
thinking that all that was necessary would be to rename them sequentially[copying to desktop and click to rename]
my patients ran out[im sure its just a rename and to do this as is specified by the installer acquisition] although ill keep the .iso for a while i hope that razor will release the proper /installer / sim pack .....
