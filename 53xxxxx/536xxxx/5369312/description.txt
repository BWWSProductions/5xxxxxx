The Beach Boys U.S. rock group. The band was formed in California in 
1961 by brothers Brian Wilson (b. 1942) on keyboards and bass, Dennis
Wilson (1944 â€“ 83) on drums, and Carl Wilson (1946 â€“ 98) on guitar;
their cousin Mike Love (b. 1941) on drums; and Alan Jardine (b. 1942)
on guitar. 

Within a year they launched a string of surfing-oriented hits marked 
by close vocal harmony, including "Surfin' Safari" and "California Girls."
 
By 1966 they had released more than 10 albums, including Pet Sounds 
(1966), considered their best. Despite Brian Wilson's reclusiveness 
due to stress- and drug-related breakdowns, the band continued to make
recordings into the 1980s and toured into the 1990s.

Court battles
_____________

Many legal difficulties developed over the coming years due too Brian Wilsons 
psychological problems. 
In the early 1980s, the band hired controversial therapist Eugene Landy in an 
attempt to help him. Landy did achieve some significant improvements in Wilsons 
overall condition; from his own admissions about his massive drug intake, it was 
highly likely that Wilson would have died if Landy had not intervened. 

Landy successfully treated Wilson's drug dependence, and by 1988 Wilson had 
recovered sufficiently to record his first solo album, Brian Wilson. But Landy 
became increasingly possessive of his star patient. After accusations that Landy 
was using his control over Wilson for his own benefit, the band successfully 
entreated the courts to separate Landy from Wilson.

In addition to the challenges over the use of the bands name and over the best way 
to care for Wilson, there have been three significant legal cases involving 
the Beach Boys in recent years. 

The second lawsuit stemmed from Wilso's reclamation of his publishing rights,soon 
after Wilson won his Sea of Tunes case in 1989, Mike Love discovered Murry Wilson
did not properly credit him as co-writer on dozens of Beach Boys songs, including 
"California Girls", "Catch a Wave," "I Get Around," "When I Grow Up (To Be a Man),"
"Be True to Your School," "Help Me, Rhonda," "I Know There's an Answer," and 
numerous others. 

With Mike and Brian unable to determine exactly what Mike was properly owed, Mike 
sued Brian in 1992 to gain credit for his co-authorship of a number of important 
Beach Boys songs, winning $13 million in 1994 for lost royalties. In interviews, 
Mike revealed that on some songs he wrote most of the lyrics, on others only a 
line or two. 
Even though Mike sued Brian, both parties said in interviews that there was no 
malice between them; they simply couldn't come up with an agreeable settlement by 
themselves.

However in November 2005, Love filed yet another lawsuit against Brian Wilson and 
his management, love alleged that the UK publication The Mail on Sunday and Wilsonâ€™s 
representatives gave the false impression to the readers of The Mail on Sunday that 
their joint promotional giveaway of nearly three million copies of the CD called 
Good Vibrations was authorized by Mike Love and the Beach Boys. 

This free CD, Love alleged, includes five of Love and Wilsonâ€™s co-authored hit 
Beach Boys songs, and was done to promote Wilson's solo CD, Smile. Love also 
claimed that Smile and Good Vibrations were marketed using the Beach Boysâ€™ names 
and images without permission. The complaint sought several million dollars in 
damages, and also a million dollars to cover costs of advertising to correct the 
perceived "damage to the band's reputation".

Love's 2005 lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on May 10, 2007 as to all the 
defendants, including Wilson. In a series of rulings, the court rejected all of Loves 
claims, including the claim that Smile was a Beach Boys project as to which Love 
deserved compensation from Wilson directly, the court subsequently ruled that Love had 
to pay the legal fees of all the defendants as well.
