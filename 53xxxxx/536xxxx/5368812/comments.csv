Hey sister, you may want to try a deep  conditioner for that frizzy mop of.  Your face however is beyond help.

Thanks to the uploader."
,escrima1,2010-02-17T01:41Z,"i have to say, Thank you, sincerely

My father had a stroke a few months back and he's half paralyzed now.  Before the stroke, talk radio was his main form of entertainment.  

The reception in the room he's staying at is terrible so he hasn't listened to it for months. 

When i finally got the bright idea to record his favorite shows for him, i found your torrents.  I threw it onto an old mp3 player (plus other shows that i've found that have been uploaded).  When he heard Rush in crystal clear sound he cried, smiling; he was incredibly happy.  I've been doing this now for a few weeks, and he looks forward to it everyday.  

I just wanted to say Thank you thank you thank you thank you"

,thunderbum,2010-02-17T06:25Z,"I guess then that makes her a rebel without a clue. *sigh* save us from progressives.

2010 should be interesting "
,booboo332,2010-02-17T06:56Z,"Never said I was surprised she returned, if fact I'm glad.  

She's such an incompetent adversary she could almost be considered an ally."
,currysteph,2010-02-17T08:07Z,thanks again
,thunderbum,2010-02-17T18:12Z,"@escrima1: I hope things work out well for your Dad and that you and he have years together yet. I lost my Dad two years ago, he had a history of strokes and heart attacks. My Dad was the best father any kid could hope to have.

Best wishes for your Dad from Canada :)"
