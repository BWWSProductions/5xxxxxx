Program: Adobe Photoshop CS4 Extended
OS: Windows (XP, Vista, Windows 7)
Requirements: 2,18 GB for download & ~0,5 GB for installation
Retail value: 999$ US dollars 
----------------------------------------------------------

How to install: 


1. After the torrent is 100% downloaded, enter the folder. (named PSCS4xt)

2. Run "Setup.bat" and follow any instructions given there.

3. When installation files are unpacked, and you begin installing PS, then select TRIAL. (activation will occur later)

4. Run through installation, (if you just want PS, then uncheck all other programs before beginning the installation). Wait for it to finish, grab a snack or something.

5. When it is finished, continue following instructions on "Setup.bat". 




How to activate:


1. Run Photoshop...

2. You will get a screen which says that you have to choose between Trial (30 days) or enter reg. key. 

3. I assume that you wrote down the serial keys from "Setup.bat", so enter one of them. (Windows serial keys)

4. If not, the folder includes a key generator (Keygen.rar). Just unrar it, open the .exe file and copy over the key you get from pressing the "generate key" button.

Done! 

Enjoy your FREE Photoshop CS4 extended!
