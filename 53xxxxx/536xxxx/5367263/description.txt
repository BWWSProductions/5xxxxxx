The Stand Ins is the fifth full-length studio album by American indie rock band Okkervil River, released on September 9, 2008.The album is the second half of The Stage Names, a planned double album. The title comes from the term 'stand-in', a person who substitutes for the actor before filming for technical purposes. If the cover art for The Stage Names is placed above that of The Stand-Ins, a complete picture is formed.The album charted at #42 with 11,000 copies sold, according to the Billboard 200.

Shearwater's Jonathan Meiburg and guitarist Charles Bissell of The Wrens contributed to the album.

Conceived as a companion piece to The Stage Names, The Stand Ins sees lyricist Will Sheff continue his preoccupation with pop culture, celebrity suicide, and the chaos and self-deception of the rock'n'roll lifestyle. Resuming the theme of the previous album's "Unless It's Kicks", opener "Lost Coastlines" likens the life of a band on tour to a treacherous nautical journey: "Every night sees us rocking and rolling on waves wild and wide." "Starry Stairs" is a sequel to the previous album's "Savannah Smiles", and depicts the life and suicide of porn star Shannon Wilsey.

The track "Singer Songwriter" makes reference to The Kinks, Edgar Allan Poe, French playwright Antonin Artaud, the 1920s silent German film The Last Laugh, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and the Gospel of Thomas.

Where The Stage Names concluded with a song about the suicide of poet John Berryman, the final track on The Stand Ins concerns the career disillusionment of Bruce Wayne Campbell (better known as Jobriath), a glam rock star turned cabaret act.
