Run Time: 109 Minutes

Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense supernatural violence and action, disturbing images, thematic elements and some language. 


I thought the movie was pretty good, I read all the books and the movie was a little disappointing compared to the books but it was overall a good movie, I really hope they make sequel.
