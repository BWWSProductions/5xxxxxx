,u2hmtmkmkm,2010-02-17T04:58Z,"dark_isle, thanks for spoiling the surprise of this episode. Not all of us are in the fucking States or Canada to watch the goddamn thing and you spoiled it because you're ignorant and stupid. For God's sake, have some consideration and awareness before you post something. "
,rolandkneisl,2010-02-17T04:58Z,dark_isle are you fucking insane?
,OompahLoompah108,2010-02-17T05:20Z,"For the moment, I would ignore dark_isle.  I don't worry too much about these ""spoilers.""  Most of the time, they end up to be foilers. But I can't confirm it one way or the other since I haven't finished downloading it.

I remember last week, somebody says, ""Oh man, I can't believe Ben dies!""  And fortunately, it ended up to be a foiler."
,u2hmtmkmkm,2010-02-17T06:07Z,"OompahLoompah108, I sincerely hope you're right. "
,u2hmtmkmkm,2010-02-17T07:12Z,Ignore that idiot (dark_isle). There was no mention of the MIB being Aaron. Could still be anyone or no one.

,paulderby,2010-02-17T09:24Z,"Deffo a typo, this is not season one!!!!"
,Recept,2010-02-17T11:46Z,danke man :)
,flashbak,2010-02-17T13:23Z,The best as always! Thanks.
,y-merej,2010-02-17T14:03Z,"Can't believe Charlie is alive.

And WTF is up with the Man in Black/Aaron?

Looking forward to next week's episode!"
,sjega,2010-02-17T15:51Z,"waaw, super fast and great quality. thanks"
,tuttaropattar,2010-02-17T21:46Z,Thanks for posting spoilers in here you assholes.
,Recept,2010-02-18T16:48Z,"@y-merej what mib, Aaron?, wtf you talking."
,elax666,2010-02-20T22:24Z,THX 4 SHARING!
,u2hmtmkmkm,2010-02-23T04:08Z,"They're not spoilers. It's just a bunch of fuckheads who think it's funny to post nonsense that isn't true to make other think they're spoilers. MIB is not Aaron and the Charlie comment isn't true. None of that stuff is revealed in the episode. Just ignore the fuckers. They need lives. But I'd refrain from reading anyone's comments from now on. It's not worth it. And maybe it'll encourage them to fuck off too. Here's to hoping they die horrible, mangled deaths :-)"
