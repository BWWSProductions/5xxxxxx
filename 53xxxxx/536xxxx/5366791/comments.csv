If anybody already using this app, kindly comment on the app. Thanks again."
,squantch,2010-02-23T00:14Z,"I downloaded this and extracted the .ipa and .app to examine its contents. I do not see any .fbl map files that relate to New Zealand (or any country outside of Europe for that matter). It seems to be a compiled Europe version of iGo from all the different versions on the AppStore (Eastern, Western, UK+Ireland, etc.). The ""Worldwide"" moniker seems to be false. I will have to look elsewhere for the North America version."
