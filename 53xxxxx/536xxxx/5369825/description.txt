***NOTES FROM LOVE SYSTEMS WEBSITE***
You can have A LOT more in your relationships with women than you think!

Threesomes. Friends with Benefits. Relationships with more than one woman.
You can have what you want, you just have to know how!

I have a really important question for you:
Are you managing your relationships, or are they managing you?

A funny thing happens when you start applying the knowledge and techniques we teach here at Love Systems â€“ women actually WANT to hang out with you! And this creates a whole new set of opportunities and challenges.

Relationship Management is an art and a science all its own. And it's one rarely taught in the dating community. UNTIL NOWâ€¦

In this FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND DVD PROGRAM, we are going to answer some
of the most difficult questions that we get at Love Systems!



Here are some of the great chapters in this AWESOME DVD course!

â€¢ How to set relationship frames that get the girl â€“ Women want men who know what they want and know how to express it confidently and appropriately. This applies to ANY relationship, from friends with benefits to long-term relationships and everything in between.
â€¢ Traditional Relationships â€“ How to make her your girlfriend AND keep the relationship passionate and exciting. Don't ever let her get bored! That's when bad things happen, especially with beautiful womenâ€¦
â€¢ Multiple Relationships â€“ Date multiple women at once, without dishonesty. It's MUCH easier than you think.
â€¢ Friends with Benefits â€“ Set expectations, get into AND maintain a Friends with Benefits situation.
â€¢ Threesomes â€“ These are also MUCH easier than you think! I even include the "magic phrase" that will make a woman comfortable with a threesome. And the key words to avoid. Also learn how to find out whether she's going to be interested in threesomes in the first place â€“ before you waste time on dates or anything else!
â€¢ Cheating â€“ Face it, women cheat as much (or more) than men. But not all women cheat â€“ and not in all situations. For the first time EVER, I give you the model that predicts if she's going to cheat, and when. Even better â€“ I tell you how to figure out what kind of woman she is in the first hour of meeting her! Think how much time you'll save by not dating the wrong kinds of women in the first place!
