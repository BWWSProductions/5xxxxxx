,earthresident,2010-02-15T00:04Z,"depends what torrent client your using. uTorrent? Vuze? each torrent client is a little bit different

usually you just have to open the .torrent file you created and force recheck or verify, which tells the torrent file to find the files on your hard drive in a default location. sometimes you need to repoint or retarget the files to tell it where the files are and then it should check itself to 100% and start seeding"
