,the_shroud,2010-02-15T08:31Z,"Been such a slow TV weekend huh? Btw 20-40, since u started the British Edge of Darkness, it got me thinking about the Red Riding series.
Was it on theatrical release and not out on DVD yet or do you already have it? Just sounds like your type of film."
,ar1990,2010-02-15T08:35Z,"could u plz upload ""Jerry Maguire""...????"

WARNING: If you limit your upload speed during the download in initial seeding phase (when I am single seeder) FOR WHATEVER REASON, you?ll be kicked-out for good. What?s going to be later, I couldn?t care less, and it?s up to your consciousness in relation to other people. Any ratio below 1.084 for sure means death of P2P, torrents and whole idea of sharing.

I am sick and tired not only of Hit&Run, but of 90% who think I?m some kind of ?free launch? downloading service. NO ? IT?S ABOUT SHARING. If you do not want or can or care to share, please, go someplace else. Consider this as one friendly warning. 
Also, in the future, if I spot something like kind of gang-banging of innocents, you'll feel my response, I promise. If you are not satisfied with things I've just said, please - go away. Internet is a Big place for all of us. And don't come back. Please.

Many people - even if they think otherwise - cannot make a distinction between ""normal"" swarm and the swarm where initial-seedeing is performed. They say ""OK, 0/1 seeder""; but infact, they do not recognize all implications of joining to initial-seeding swarm. To keep it short and simple, if anyone need/wants to save on traffic - for whatever reason - better is to stay away and wait till more than four stable seeders are present. Initial swarms are for the people who CAN put upload/download speed at 1:1 ratio - all other ""types of behaviour"" leads to semi-catastrophic consequences, not only to individual peer, but to ALL peers in specific swarm.
Why is that, I've explained numerous times on name-not-to-be-spoken - and I might post this Q&A part of the text here. Maybe.

IMPORTANT: Torrents, especially of UK shows, are under constant and coordinated attack from British-based IP numbers. If you see number of peers with very, very similar address block them all (block range) with your firewall.
Their MO is called ?byte-thrashers?; they aggressively pull bytes from normal peers, causing other ?normal? peers to tag you as ?uncooperative? since all newer torrent programs have built-in Friend or Foe mechanism. 
Normal clients receive nothing from you (?cause you gave packets to ?gremlins?) and doesn?t give you back any byte ? simple as that. 
Companies currently pay agencies and individuals to starve us to death (byte-wise and otherwise). Do not let them to get richer, and let us just to wave to their Jags, Porschs and yachts.

MOST IMPORTANT:

1st. New torrent programs are ?smarter? than old ones. They do not allow blatant leeching, if YOU do not give, you?ll get NOTHING from others. So, imagine a situation when 10 of 16 morons join the initial seeding.

2nd New torrent programs NEED 60-70 kB/s upload speed JUST to maintain stabile connection to other side. So, TODAY, throttling down your upload speed doesn?t look so smart, right?

3rd I am not against cost-effectiveness, right, as long it doesn?t compromise my main goal or purpose. I need 23 minutes for average comedy/cartoon show to upload, 46 minutes (in fact, less) for normal-length episode, hour and a half for average movie. I DO NOT have all the time in the world; I have my schedule, my rhythm and ? my rules. Be nice, play fair, show respect and many things would be better, especially here."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-15T09:41Z,"@the_shroud: I have watched Red Riding. Group HAGGIS issued DVDrip. These were ""American"" length episodes, small in number - and easy to get from any torrent or file-sharing site.
I am ready to jump-in when somebody needs help, either if something is hard to get or simply too big as currently is... and it must ""fit"" somehow in my ""profile""... and 720p of any kind is preferable (not so for really old series).

@ar1990: You must tell me a reason. Why - is it unavailable or too big? Speak up. "
,anyjen,2010-02-15T11:35Z,"@twentyforty, I understand where you're coming from, but you're failing to take into consideration the different situations of people around the world. New torrent programs need at least 70 kb/s upload speed?! On a good day, my connection will only allow me 15 kb/s upload speed *total*. 

Not everybody who doesn't upload does so because of manually limiting their upload speed; most of us have low upload speed because our internet providers limit it for us, without asking for permission.

I know it's frustrating to see so many hit&runs, but some of us don't really have a saying in this. I have to choose which torrent to leave open so as to reach the 1:1 ratio, because with a download speed of 70 kb/s and an upload speed of 15 kb/s, it's impossible for me to keep *all* torrents at 1:1.

(and before you ask: no, I didn't even download your torrents. I try to stick to those who have plenty of seeders so as not to be a leech with my low upload speed)"
,lilars26,2010-02-15T15:17Z,@anyjen You really don't know where 20/40 was coming from.The only time you need to maintain a 1-1 ratio is in initial seeding.If you have a slow upload speed then wait until the torrent shows that there are at least 4 stable seeders.Then you can download and there is no problem.After that it is up to your conscience.
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-15T15:26Z,"@anjen: You completely missed the point.
I am torrent uploader of my torrents, I spoke from the ground of initial-seeder.

Every single thing I have said is because I DO CARE, about remaining, few, good and normal people out there.

Also, every even smallest thing you know (about torrents, networking and P2P in general) I knew from before. I bought (with my own money) first computer back in 1983, wrote first commercial program 1984. and bought Internet connection in 1998. We DO NOT share common background, right?

So, everything I have said or wrote, not just  today, comes from the point of initial-seeder, 2nd.; with merit 3rd; with good intentions and 4th - from every-day's experience in re-encoding and dealing with torrent - watching how crooks, punks and swindlers take over. It cannot go without resistance.

At the end, everything I've said should be regarded as an advice, so... take it or leave it.
Remember, right now I have 2 torrents in initial-seeding phase, AND BOTH have exactly the same ""problems"" I spoke about.
It proved I am right, don't you think?


P.S: ""New torrent programs need at least 70 kb/s upload speed?""

If one wants to download fast - YES. For 1 MB/s at least 72 kB/s. Try to load the torrent from private tracker site where you can be a single downloader connected directly to server, and you'll see that I have right again.

But, with your 15 kB/s you must be patient and persistent - and - keep your hands away from initial-seeding or live from the crumbs and leftovers if you don't follow advices I gave."
,lilars26,2010-02-15T15:30Z,"...and just to add one more thought,even at 15kb/s you can upload all torrents to 1.084
ratio.It just takes a little longer.


BTW I have the same speeds as you."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-15T18:39Z,"@lilars: I have simplified many things for the reason of non-English speakers. Hence, my sentences are shorter and point is heavily articulated, to be understandable. For instance:

""Initial swarms are for the people who CAN put upload/download speed at 1:1 ratio...""

sounds clear enough, right?

But, here a mindset (how hard-wired brain is) comes into play, and for a fact, ""move"" accented points into minds ""blind-spot"". Personal ""glasses"" of every man...

On saying:
""...consideration the different situations of people around the world"" I see such things (a blinded Kenite) and that invokes pictures of DeNiro (""Are you spoken to me?"") and demonic Jack Nicholson and his ""You cannot handle the truth"" right away."
