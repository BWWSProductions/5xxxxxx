PGI Workstation Complete is PGI's flagship scientific and
engineering workstation compiler bundle. It includes all features
from both PGI Fortran Workstation and PGI C Workstation. PGI
Fortran Workstation, The Portland Group's native
parallelizing/optimizing FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90/95 and HPF compilers
for 64-bit x64 and 32-bit x86 processor-based Linux, Apple Mac OS X
and Microsoft Windows workstations, provide the features, quality,
and reliability necessary for developing and maintaining advanced
scientific and technical applications. PGI C Workstation includes
The Portland Group's native parallelizing/optimizing OpenMP C and
ANSI C compilers. The C compiler closely tracks the proposed ANSI
standard and is compatible with cfront versions 2 and 3. All C
functions are compatible with Fortran and C functions, so you can
compose programs from components written in all three languages.
