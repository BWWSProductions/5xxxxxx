I am so sick of people who rip albums into a single mp3 file, completely fail to name the tracks, fail to name the folders, and one of the worst, fail to add tracknumber so tracks get mixed.

You sir. Prove how it's to be done."

Doesn't really matter for me because I listen to the tracks to see what's good then get the full vinyl rip elsewhere.

Meh. At least it's separate tracks."
