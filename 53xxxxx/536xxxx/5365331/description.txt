------------------------------------

Follows what happens on the old farm LisselbÃ¤cka as a year passes. LisselbÃ¤cka is situated in the county Dalarna, Sweden. Here various kinds of old farm races are bred by the enthusiast Karl Gustav Hedling. This isn't a silent movie, but it has neither dialogue nor narrative, so it's really international and no subs are needed. ;-) This kind of speechless documentaries has become the trademark of the filmmaker Nina Hedenius. If you have a nostalgic bone in your body and/or like heavy workhorses and farm animals in general, you will enjoy this very beautiful and soothing movie.

The file is saved from Swedish Public Service TV's webcast. It's low resolution but if you just avoid full screen the quality is fine.
