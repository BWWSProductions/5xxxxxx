              Australian documentary from 2005. Episode 2 of 4.
              The young police-assistant Scott Nicoll has gone tired of
              the streets of Brisbane so he applies for a job as
              "property-cop" in west Queensland. With help from his
              girlfriend Jo he makes the big change.

              Notes: The show aired in FS but with small upper- and lower
              black bars, that's the cause of the unusual resolution.
