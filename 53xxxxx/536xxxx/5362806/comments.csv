 HolyRoses usually waits for a DVD or a BluRay copy in order to release a Awesome quality (PiZ) Movie! I know I kind wanted it too, but the only copy that is available is a PPV-Rip / VHS-Screener from Mr. H. I did one(PiZ) myself, but if you can wait, maybe a week or two there will be a DVD or BluRay available."
