This is not a request for a movie its a referral for you to watch. It's called 
""In The Loop"" 
I think you will like it and if you do in fact like it I would then appreciate an upload. I don't like asking someone to do stuff so I figure if you like it you would be more likely to share it. 
Again thanks for the work you put always the best from HR!"

-thanks"

you can change the icon by adding it to itunes, right click - select info and change the picture icon in there. then find the location of the file that is showing on itunes. that is the file you want, with the icon of your choice. thats how it works on mac, not sure about pc."
