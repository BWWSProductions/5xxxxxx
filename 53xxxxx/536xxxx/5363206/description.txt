Tribes ReVengeance multiplayer, plus beml and X2 map packs.

Multiplayer

The multiplayer mode offers five different default game types and a diversity of map locations. Players are ranked during matches by points they acquire through ordinary means (such as killing an opponent, capturing a flag, or returning one) or by style points (such as performing a head shot with a sniper rifle, or hitting someone in mid-air with a spinfusor).

    * Arena is a 'Team Free for All' in which two teams fight for up to 9 rounds. There is no respawn, so once a player dies, they must wait for the next round before they can play again. Whichever team has more rounds won at the end of a match wins. This game type is inherited from earlier Tribes games.
    
* Ball is a game type where two teams play against each other with a goal for each team. There is a single ball located somewhere on the map. The objective is to get the ball and throw it into the enemyâ€™s goal. Whichever team has the most points at the end wins. This game is original to Tribes: Vengeance, but also resembles Unreal Tournament 2003 and Unreal Tournament 2004's Bombing Run game.
    
* In Fuel, both teams have a fuel depot at their base. There is one neutral fuel depot which the players can collect fuel from, as well as a depot for each team. Players may stand within these to gradually steal fuel or, if it is their own team's, to deposit fuel. The less fuel in the depot, the slower it takes to collect it. As well as the depots, players can collect fuel cells from the ground that may have originally spawned there randomly on the game's start, or have been dropped upon a player's death. The maximum amount of fuel a character can carry is 15, and each fuel cell contains a specific amount of fuel. Whenever a player dies, their team's fuel depot loses one unit of fuel. Whichever team fills their depot faster is the winner. This game type is original to Tribes: Vengeance
    
* Rabbit is the only 'Free for All' game mode in Tribes: Vengeance. In this, there are no teams, but a single flag on the map somewhere. The objective for every player is to retrieve the flag and run. Whenever a player retrieves the flag, every other player will be alerted, and whoever has the flag will be marked as their enemy. Points are gained by holding on to the flag as long as possible and killing the other players. Points are lost by killing somebody who does not have the flag. No points are gained by killing the flag carrier. The game is timed, and whoever has the most points at the end is the winner. This game mode is common to all Tribes games, as well as many other games.
    
* Capture the Flag mode is similar to its Tribes equivalent. There are two teams, each with a flag and a flag stand. The objective for each team is to capture the enemy flag and bring it back to its base. However, the teamâ€™s flag must be at their flag stand in order for them to capture the enemyâ€™s flag. Points are awarded for every flag capture. The game can be ended by time running out, or a team capturing the enemy flag until the max amount of points achieved. If it is ended by time, whichever team had more points wins.
