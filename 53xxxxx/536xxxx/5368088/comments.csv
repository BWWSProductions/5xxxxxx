,OttifantSir,2010-04-20T19:28Z,"Oh, shut up! You have uploaded nothing, so just shut the **** up! To upload 5GiB and get enough seeds for the torrent to sustain itself can take days, weeks or even months if the subject of the torrent isn't very popular.

And some uploaders also like to download, and seed back what they download, so their upload-bandwidth isn't fully on uploading THEIR torrent, but also other people's torrents. So I say again: Until you have uploaded something yourself, and seen how long it takes, SHUT THE **** UP AND ENJOY THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY BOTHERS TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU!!"
,redbeard0,2010-06-14T07:39Z,I may not upload anything but I always make it a habit to seed until AT LEAST a 3.0 ratio. normally I seed until I require the bandwidth. Which isn't that often.
