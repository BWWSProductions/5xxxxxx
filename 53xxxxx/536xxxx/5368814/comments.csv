,mrhinter,2010-02-16T22:50Z,"turned ep1 back on to seed, getting nothing.. you remove it?"
,mrhinter,2010-02-16T22:56Z,"ok haha ignore me, seeding ep1 again :P"
,raffan,2010-02-16T23:42Z,"mista 20-forty please,please please,upload The wire in small size.thank you"
,the_shroud,2010-02-17T00:43Z,"Yeah, I've left EoD Ep1 to seed this whole time but no one's picking up. I see a lot of peers (40) but no one's connecting.
Re: The Wire - I've been stuck in the middle of S2 b'coz the DVD don't agree with the player. 20-40's encodes are much more reliable ;)"
,mrhinter,2010-02-17T01:04Z,"i took 2040's advice a lil while back, and added peerblock to my repertoire. seeing as the RC45 Peer Guardian 2 was a waste of time on vista, i havent been IP filtering for quite a while, the addition of peerblock (and a couple of nudges on force start) got me seeding again, ratio of about 4.5 - 5.0 now! The new movie was good, so cant wait to watch all 6 eps in one sitting! ohhh the waiting, the patience, the torture!"
,lilars26,2010-02-17T02:55Z,@mrhinter  He's probably sleeping.
,the_shroud,2010-02-17T11:32Z,"@mrhinter: So, should I wait for the movie to come around my country first and watch it before I start on the series or should I watch the series first before Mel Gibson's film?
Saw State of Play series first before the movie and it was definitely better than movie. It lacked McAvoy and Nighy definitely better as Chief Editor than Mirren"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-17T12:05Z,"@the_shroud & raffan: The Wire is available all around the net, as XviD rips, as DVDRs and as small sized .mkv (from 99MB to 175MB). All seasons.

I found direct links within minutes, googleing after reading your comments. I have no time nor bandwidth to redo or to make dupes. There is no need to do that.

@the_shroud: You cannot made rightful comparison between TV series from 1983 and contemporary movie. State of the play is totally different thing, and I tend to agree about UK ""original"".

@lilars: I never sleep. You've asked before. :-)"
,the_shroud,2010-02-17T17:11Z,"Thx for the tip re Wire. Re EoD: I'm still torn which to watch first..... won't have to decide till i've compiled all six tho.
p.s. Found all 3 Red Riding packed in 700mb (approx  500min) but polish sub. Had to search and go thru a few to get eng sub that synced. Need it with all that Yorkshire accent."
,jon4fun,2010-02-17T17:20Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon"
,lilars26,2010-02-17T18:06Z,"Never sleep?
Well,that explains a lot.
( :oI )"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-17T19:54Z,"@the_shroud: I can re-encode last year's ""issue"" of Red Riding. Stay tuned, if you're interested.

@Jon: Thanks my friend.

@lilars: I am a pirate. Pretty shaken one, but still..."
,mrhinter,2010-02-17T22:22Z,"@ everyone asking about the movie or series first: i wouldnt know yet! the movie sat well in my stomach, but i havent watched the show yet, ill wait till i got it all!

@ 2040 - If you slept we wouldnt have all these damn great encodes popping up on a daily basis! you have my thanks and appreciation a million times over!"
,the_shroud,2010-02-18T00:47Z,Thanks y'all
