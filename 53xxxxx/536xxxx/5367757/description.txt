The Marvelettes were an American singing girl group on the Tamla (later Motown) label. Motown's first successful female vocal group, the Marvelettes are most notable for recording the company's first #1 Pop hit, "Please Mr. Postman", and for setting the precedent for later Motown girl groups such as Martha and the Vandellas and The Supremes.
During their eight-year run on the Billboard music charts, the group scored nineteen top forty American R&B Singles and ten Top 40 American Pop singles. Of these hits, three were Top 10 Pop singles, nine were top Top 10 R&B singles, and their debut was #1 one on both charts. (Between 1961 and 1969 they charted a total of 25 Pop singles.)
