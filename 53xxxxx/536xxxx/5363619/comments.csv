Suggested settings for faster seeding? (Transmission 1.83 - MacOS10.5.8 - cable, wireless router)"

,ptv83,2010-02-17T03:47Z,".mov's??  wtf. in the future don't upload .mov's .. not only are they abstract and no devices play them, they very easily infected by virus's, malware and trojen's, manually and automatically by bot's and spider's, that spread by themselves through IM, email, P2P, FTP, and bitorrent, and most of the time free of any detection by ANY antivirus software (mac, linux or PC).
.mov's are like a plague you can't get rid of."

Saving as MOV's was a LOT faster than exporting on my 867Mhz PowerBook.

In hindsight, maybe I should have used that ""save as AVI"" QTC from Squared 5's MPEG Streamclip, but I didn't know about it at the time."
,aychberg,2010-02-18T01:32Z,"...also, in hindsight, I should have labeled this as ""encoded in xvid, wrapped in .mov containers"""
