It sets out to be a ready audio-visual reference, and should inevitably become a collector's item.

Film aficionados can have a look at 40 sketches of different poses of the legendary sitarist (Ravi Shankar) drawn by Ray giving some idea as to how the film could have materialized.  A virtual treat for the die-hard Satyajit Ray fanatic.
