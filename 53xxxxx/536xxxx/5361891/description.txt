The movie is fairly well done for a documentary. The information flows rather well and the points they bring up are interesting enough aside from the fairly touchy section towards the middle. You will quickly find out though that this is simply a long piece of bashing towards the major beer companies. Try to keep in mind that the major companies are now the top of the industry for a reason. Its easy to say that its because of their advertising but keep in mind that they didn't start out of the gate with million dollar advertising campaigns. Its fine that these brewers feel that they are adding something to the industry, but that doesn't mean that the companies that have done well are taking away. After all if one of these small brewers achieved incredible success, they would perform exactly as bush or miller have. They would promote their brand and try to maximize sales. Its kind of the idea of business. Alright documentary, but keep an eye on the massive bias when watching it and the small brewers end up coming off as rather arrogant
