It's called remote spy. Website: http://www.e-spy-software.com/ With this peace of software it is possible to create a scriptfile witch can be sent by mail and when the mail has been red the script file has been automatically installed on the remote computer. I am in serious relationshiptrouble and I have to verify my mistake. It's is not illegal when the user have to press OK button in the mail for the script to run. Hope you can help me with a cracked version of the program and serverusername and password ? If not, can you provide a simular solution witch is based on the remote prinsip where the user have to activate a mail for a program to run? I apreasiate your work!  "
