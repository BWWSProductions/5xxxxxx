Faronics Deep Freeze helps eliminate workstation damage and downtime by making 
computer configurations indestructible. Once Deep Freeze is installed on a 
workstation, any changes made to the computerâ€”regardless of whether they are 
accidental or maliciousâ€”are never permanent. Deep Freeze provides immediate 
immunity from many of the problems that plague computers todayâ€”inevitable 
configuration drift, accidental system misconfiguration, malicious software 
activity, and incidental system degradation.

Deep Freeze ensures computers are absolutely bulletproof, even when users have 
full access to system software and settings. Users get to enjoy a pristine and 
unrestricted computing experience, while IT personnel are freed from tedious 
helpdesk requests, constant system maintenance, and continuous configuration 
drift.



Benefits of "Deep Freeze Enterprise":

Manage and control large computing environments and easily safeguard the 
information stored on the PCs.

Deep Freeze instantly protects and preserves baseline computer configurations. 
No matter what changes a user makes to a workstation, simply restart to eradicate 
all changes and reset the computer to its original state - right down to the last 
byte.

Expensive computer assets are kept running at 100% capacity and technical support 
time is reduced or eliminated completely. The result is consistent trouble-free 
computing on a truly protected and parallel network, completely free of harmful 
viruses and unwanted programs. 

While Deep Freeze provides bulletproof protection, its non-restrictive approach 
also improves user productivity and satisfaction.

Placing no restrictions on a user's ability to access all system resources, users 
avoid the frustration of downtime due to software conflicts, operating system 
corruption, virus attacks, and many other problems. Users are always assured of 
computers that are consistently operable and available. 

Building on the power of Deep Freeze Standard, Deep Freeze Enterprise offers 
centralized deployment and enhanced flexibility options for customizable 
management of large computing environments.

Deep Freeze Enterprise is the best solution for keeping a large number of PCs 
in top notch state.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
