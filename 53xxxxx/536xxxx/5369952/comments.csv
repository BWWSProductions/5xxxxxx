,saeedsad,2010-02-17T10:17Z,"hi,
first,thanks a lot for  your great works,
i have a question,
in the episode 1 of season 6,you include subtitle file,but in the others there is no subtitle file,
i want to know is it possible for you(and easy) to upload subtitle with each file?
(you know,I'm a little lazy and don't want to sync  subtitle by myself :D)
thanks again :)"

@saeedsad: If subtitles from http://www.addic7ed.com are:

1st: available at all
2nd: could be synced to 720p EASILY

I include them in my torrent.

It would be endlessly stupid to wait hours and hours and hours just for the subtitles, right?
If someone needs subtitles badly, and if they are not included, anyone should find appropriate subs for yourself."
