This is the new version of my skinned iTunes 9.0.3

Originally I've made my first iTunes skin in earlier 2005 to complete my OSX appearence theme.
As many of you liked my work, here thus the last version, the third major skin update and back to black! 
I hope you'll enjoy it.

Finally, here is my tutorial to make your own iTunes skin: 
http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4006323

If you don't like the font I use:
		- Before Psykozz installation, right clic on your original Apple's release of iTunes and choose:
	   Show package contents
		- take and put on your desktop "Localized.rsrc" file for your language, you find it here (french example):
	   /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/Resources/French.lproj/Localized.rsrc
		- After Psykozz installation, trash this font:
	   /Library/Fonts/SilentiumPro RomanII.otf
		- replace Localized.rsrc from Psykozz installation with original one; it's done!

If when you try to install you have this message:
"the following installation process failed: run preupgrade script for itunes by psykozz!"
All you need is trash this file:
HD/Library/Receipts/iTunesX.pkg
Then, installation is OK! ;-)

If you like it, please seed! ;-)
If this skinned version isnâ€™t on your taste, please post constructive comments or don't waste your time here!

See you!
