HOLY CRAP!

3.0.2 IS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT.  It's actually streaming cabac pretty damn good at 720p.  It's still not 100% perfect, but its way better.

Try streaming over wifi or various other HR files that may of given you trouble if they were not synced.


Apple if you you're reading, good job! ;-)

and here
