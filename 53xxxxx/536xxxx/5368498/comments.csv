,jake_samuals,2010-02-19T15:01Z,"Hey HR, just read your remark about the improvement of streaming with firmware 3.0.2. I'll give it a try as well. Prior to this I had stutter, frame skipping and ultimately a complete lock up forcing a reboot. The only way I could play was to re-encode with Redux Encoder, VisualHub (old but still works) or Video Monkey."
,jake_samuals,2010-02-19T19:48Z,"I stream wirelessly (N speed). The lock up and reboot happened during The Hurt Locker. I'm hoping Apple updates the hardware with the chip (their own btw) inside the iPad, or some variation of it. Powerful but runs cool."

,falcon62,2011-01-04T06:20Z,When I play this movie in Media Player Classic I get a huge lag with the audio.  No problems with Windows Media Player.  Any ideas what would cause the audio lag? Usually MPC woks great!
