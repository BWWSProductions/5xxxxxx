Hi Everyone. Just thought I would share with everyone. Have patched game with bolloxmasta v1. It includes full strips, new boots and balls, all german teams and tons more. Have tested on pal 360 ixtreme 1.60 and works perfectly.

Just extract iso then burn as normal. Don't forget though, you will need to delete all saved games, edit data etc (anything to do with pes 2010) before playing otherwise this will not work. Also you need to delete from hardrive if you have installed non patched version.

Don't play this on live you will get banned!

Happy pes'ing.
