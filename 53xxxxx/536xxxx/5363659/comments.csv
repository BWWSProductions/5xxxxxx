do u need a harddrivecable?
or will I manage by just delete things without any special connections?"
,dazbutler1979,2010-02-16T22:59Z,"Hi juster 37,

No mate you just delete on your xbox its self. just navigate to system settings, memory and find pes 2010 folder, delete it and then play, very easy.

this delete all your save games, edit files, game install, option file and replays."
,dazbutler1979,2010-02-16T23:00Z,Again everyone I just wanna apologise for the crap speed. i'm doing my best and hopefully soon you will all be playing this.

,juss1,2010-02-19T03:06Z,i got only play dvd?? whats next
,dazbutler1979,2010-02-19T03:18Z,"Hi Juss,

game should just boot as normal. It is patched as wave 2. Do you need to use one shot boot disk for your firmware?"
,juss1,2010-02-19T03:26Z,i think not because i have firmware 1.6
,juss1,2010-02-19T03:27Z,but where i can find this disc ..one shot..
,dazbutler1979,2010-02-19T03:32Z,"Hi Juss1,

yes you will need the activate iso disk, as I had to patch to wave 2, because of this it won't directly boot the game. follow instructions etc to burn activate disk and it will be perfect.

hope this helps"
,juss1,2010-02-19T03:38Z,"do u know does that activate.iso works with dvd-r 4,7 gb...
i dont have other discs right know"
,juss1,2010-02-19T04:23Z,sry i have 1.61 firmware
,juss1,2010-02-19T06:18Z,anyone get working this game...???
,dazbutler1979,2010-02-19T10:07Z,"no sorry it has to be a dl disk. U should not need the disk if you are running 1.61. 

When burning did you set the layer break as normal to 1913760. as i didn't include a .dvd file."
,juss1,2010-02-19T11:32Z,no i dont set layer break... but funny thing is that i delete the game in my computer...=)=) but know i try to make this disc what i burned a image and try to burn again and set layer break to...=) hope u understand me
,juss1,2010-02-19T12:12Z,no results still get play dvd...:(
,dazbutler1979,2010-02-19T12:25Z,"the game will not work if the layer break is not at 1913760 u can do this in imgburn by going to write and then clicking user specified layer break at typing 1913760. unfortunately because you didn't set it in the first place the img you have just made will copy the layer break details and will be no good.

this is definitely the issue, as I can assure this definitely works."
,juss1,2010-02-19T12:39Z,then i have to download again...:(
,gyuris38,2010-02-19T15:21Z,dvd image file??????????
,dazbutler1979,2010-02-19T16:03Z,"do you mean theres no .dvd file. You don't need it just change layer break on imgburn to 1913760 in options, write and tick user specified.

The .dvd file just includes the layer break information"
,juss1,2010-02-19T17:03Z,i have new file and burn like u say but still dont work
,johnbaker1979,2010-02-19T18:09Z,"Thanks for the upload. Can confirm it DEFINITELY works. Requires the 360 Boot Disc to run. Also, Game is PAL!!! even if your using LT Firmware this will still need a boot disc because its not been stealth patched. Just like the unstealthed Modern Warfare 2 did."
,dazbutler1979,2010-02-19T18:29Z,"Juss 1
