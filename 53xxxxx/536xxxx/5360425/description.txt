'The Flight of the Bumblebee' on electric razor? The
Choral Movement from Beethoven's Ninth on spoons?

Rainer Hersch looks at strange instruments that have
been used in concerts - such as anvils, cannon, car
horns, typewriters and salad bowls.

With the help of two percussionists, Mick Doran & Neil
Percy, he explores soundscapes that can be produced by
a bowed cymbal, a plastic cup rubbed on a gong, or a
car suspension spring struck by a hammer.
