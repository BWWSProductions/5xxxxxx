They Are Just A Hater.. DL The Sample And Judge Off That

The Audio Is At LEAST A 7 Not A 2 ... And Video Is At LEAST A 6 Not 4 ... 

But Ya'll Are Entitled To Your Own Opinions!!

ENJOY!!"

Since i really only download dvd rips i cant give a rating but i suggest you download the sample and judge for yourself

once again thanks "
,godswallops,2010-02-15T12:48Z,"I'd like to amend my earlier comment.

The quality is better than originally thought from the opening scenes.

For a CAM it's not bad - V:5 A:5, watchable.

Thanks for the preview - this movie will rock when available as DVDRip."
