Brandon Rhyder is different. When you hear his voice, you know itâ€™s unmistakably him. When he comes out with a new single you never know what youâ€™re going to get. Brandon Rhyder loves to take you to the top and then jerk the rug out from under you and start the process all over again. Brandon Rhyder doesnâ€™t write for a genre, but rather for the inspiration that he receives. Brandon Rhyder is as real as they come, and this album, leading with the single â€˜Rock Angel,â€™ is his best album yet. With Head Above Water, Brandon takes Texas by the boots and reminds us in 12 tracks (with one hidden gem) of what keeps his head above water: love, honesty and his Country roots.
