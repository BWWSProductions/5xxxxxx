,sasanet,2010-03-20T15:32Z,"I will seed as much as possible.
for those who do not understand:

WHAT THE HELL IS SEED AND HOW DO I SEED???

it's very simple:
1.after you finish with download do not remove torrent from your torrent client (uTorrent, bitTorrent....)
2.do not delete or modify  downlaoded files located in downloads folder. 

now you are seeding files back to the pirate bay so other people can download faster."

,Roko121,2010-07-01T12:34Z,"OK People. 1st - READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
2nd - If TAD doesn't recognize TWC civs, you'll have to do some registry editing - just find it on aoe3 forums, the instructions are there: http://forum.agecommunity.com/forums/thread/834191.aspx . Also I had the Cannot create the bla bla file bla bla. I think it was fixed when I reinstalled TAD. Also check if you copied all the cracks and if you have any mods installed. Mods can screw up your game - i installed The Napoleonic Era (the BEST mod) and lost Spain and couldn't play with TWC civs. Don't even think about copy/pasting the game's install dir. and thinking you'll now have one modded and one original - it screws it up, trust me. In total, I had to reinstall 5 times, so listen to me: be happy with the original game + the expansion packs and read the instructions, and copy the cracks (all). cheers and sry for the long coment but i had to warn you guys"
,impdraber,2010-07-17T19:54Z,"Hey guys, I have a problem with the cracks I followed the instructions, copy/pasted the cracks for the expansions, and now it has an error \""Initialization Failed could not load DATAPY.BAR\"" And I don\'t know what to do, AoEIII does work, but the expansions don\'t, Should I reinstall it without cracks?"
,k3rc4,2010-08-13T14:03Z,same problem here...
,nicooolito,2010-09-21T20:33Z,"if i told u guys to read instructions then u would say i did,  but if u did then u wouldnt have that problem, u simply got ahead of urself when installing, u install all 3 games then u PATCH them then u add crack, u added crack before patch, hence the error!"

,herorulez,2011-02-14T00:46Z,common people seed plzz 
,DramaPirate,2011-02-20T23:12Z,"ATTENTION: I have a lot of experience with torrents and cracking games and have discoverd that Daemon tools is a piece of shit software that (depending on which version you have) installs spyware with the initial download.  It doesn't have a bunch of boul shit features.  It lets you have an unliminted ammount of clone drives and well, mounts ISO's.  That's all you really need right?  So if your new to the torrent game, then I suggest you take the path that I did.  You will be protecting your PC. - Drama"
,VanBryla,2011-03-20T05:52Z,"GREAT UPLOAD RATE 2K kB/s!

,Arr0wsmith,2011-07-22T19:32Z,"I already have the original AOE3 game, if I install the expansions with the cracks and patches could it work? or would that totally fuck it up."
