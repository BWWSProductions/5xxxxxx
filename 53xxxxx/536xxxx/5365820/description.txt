Bill & Ted's Excellent Comic Book was a comic book series published by Marvel Comics which ran for twelve issues in 1991.  It was written and illustrated by Evan Dorkin and continued from the end of the second Bill & Ted movie Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.  

The first two issues concerns efforts by Bill and Ted to create yet another party with old friends celebrating their recent nuptials.  Unfortunately the personification of mortality, Death, a more recent ally, becomes vastly out of sorts and steals the phone-booth time machine.  Rufus, their old guide, helps by directing them to a prototype for the phone booth/time machine.  Bill and Ted must take the device and find Death before he causes too much damage to the time stream.
