Fresh from the release of the eccentrically brilliant â€œPieces of Youâ€ Wolf Gang re-emerges with the equally fantastic single â€œThe King & All of His Menâ€ on November 16th. 

The 1st release through brand new label Hit Club, the track comes backed with Hot Chip, Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs & Egyptian Hip Hop remixes. It will be available on limited 7â€³ & digitally.

Sounding like MGMT fronted by Bryan Ferry, or a 21st Century ABC â€œThe King & All of His Menâ€ is an instant modern classic, a toweringly bright & brilliant combination of archly knowing lyrics & soaring space age pop production values.
