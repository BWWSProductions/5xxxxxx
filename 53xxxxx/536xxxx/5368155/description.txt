Starring Robin Dunne (â€œSanctuary,â€ â€œDawsonâ€™s Creekâ€) and Erica Durance (â€œSmallvilleâ€), Beyond Sherwood Forest is a story of danger and derring-do, of fantasy and phantasms. The Sheriff of Nottingham has unleashed a hideous winged monster â€“ a tortured forest spirit â€“ to destroy the gentle towns and woods of England, massacre Robinâ€™s men, and capture his Maid Marian. Hearts will run cold with fear, and streets will run red with blood. Can The Prince of Thieves and his gallant men defeat this beast from another world and her cruel master?
