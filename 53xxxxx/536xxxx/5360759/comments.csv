,draki85,2010-02-15T04:19Z,"The program hides a file into a picture by changing the colors slightly, but you can't tell, and password protects it. I use this program and it works well. To use the advanced features you will need to know, or at least have a image editor that will tell you, the RBG color spectrum and codes. "

,draki85,2010-02-19T06:49Z,"There is a text file included with the torrent, hip.txt - this will tell you everything you need to know about the software

buuuuuut.....the short and long of it


There is no installing it, it runs from the folder you save it in. 

winhip_en is the windows GUI program, double click it and it opens a simple small window with one button, which opens an image file, bmp or gif.

This opens another window that you use to hide and retrieve the file from the image.

There are 4 buttons there and they are 

-hide file in picture, which is self explanatory, enter the password you create, confirm and select the file you want to hide.

-retrieve file, also self explanatory, hope you remembered your password, there is no recovery method, unless ou use a password cracker, save the file location and boom, file retrieved

-and the save and save as buttons - im not even going to explain those

the drop box next to the buttons is the zoom

in the image menu is the same as the 4 buttons, with the addition of erase file, transparent color and picture info (like properties)

the first and last of those are self explanatory

the transparent color is a color in the image that you DON'T want to change, to use this you will need to open paint or a photo editing software and select the little sqeezy drop thing button that picks the color of the pixel you click on and get the RBG code from it and use it to change the RBG slider bars and that will be your transparent color"
