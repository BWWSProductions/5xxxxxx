No guests scheduled today. Alex covers the latest news, including recent revelations that there has been no global warming since 1995 and the infamous "hockey stick graph" Al Gore used in his propaganda movie has gone missing. 



Alex also takes a number of calls.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 part of all contents. 

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
