Deadmau5 - Random Album Title


Zimmerman, more commonly known as Deadmau5 (pronounced "dead-mouse") has gone from relative obscurity just two short years ago to super-stardom and one of the highest profiles in dance music. His genre is hard to pin down: sometimes it sounds like progressive house, other times like trance, other times like techno.

Random Album Title is no different. Deadmau5's debut album does not disappoint: it shows his full range of sounds, mixed together in a set not unlike the ones the star DJ gives in dance clubs worldwide. Those into vocal dance music will be disappointed however: the tracks on this LP are predominantly instrumental.
