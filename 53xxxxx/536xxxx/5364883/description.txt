Book Description
================
From Booklist
Few fans of the best-selling Septimus Heap series will be disappointed 
by this excellent third adventure, which counters the fraying novelty 
of the DomDaniel plotline with a brand new villain--a former queen whose 
malevolent spirit is accidentally released from an enchanted portrait. 
Along with a deadly epidemic, the spirit brings turmoil to the kingdom 
and to Septimus, who is forcibly apprenticed to an alchemist living 
many centuries earlier. Rescue efforts wind up trapping more members 
of the Heap family, as well as a visitor from the far North, in the 
same situation. The time-travel elements are head spinning, but moments 
of faltering logic will go unnoticed as readers savor the quirky storytelling, 
marked by a sprawling, omniscient purview and plenty of entertaining 
tangents. With entries as strong as this one, Sage's efforts will continue 
to stand strong within the crowded young-wizard niche. Jennifer Mattson--

Book Description

When Silas Heap unSeals a forgotten room in the Palace, he releases 
the ghost of a Queen who lived five hundred years earlier. Queen Etheldredda 
is as awful in death as she was in life, and she's still up to no good. 
Her diabolical plan to give herself everlasting life requires Jenna's 
compliance, Septimus's disappearance, and the talents of her son, Marcellus 
Pye, a famous Alchemist and Physician. And if Queen Etheldredda's plot 
involves Jenna and Septimus, then it will surely involve Nicko, Alther 
Mella, Marcia Overstrand, Beetle, Stanley, Sarah, Silas, Spit Fyre, 
Aunt Zelda, and all of the other wacky, wonderful characters that made 
magyk and flyte so memorable.
