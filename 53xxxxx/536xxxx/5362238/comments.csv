[T],NoggintheNomad,2010-02-14T18:38Z,Seeders? This could be useful...
,senseinai,2010-02-14T21:29Z,Check out this and the other Xilisoft software on VersionTracker. The company is considered to be scam artists and there are warnings not to use the software.
,zogulusnig,2010-02-15T05:59Z,"The latest version is actually 5.0.74.

Also, the serials from KCNScrew for 5.0.72 Ultimate still work in this version.

I don't believe there is a PPC version for 5.0.72, though."
,zogulusnig,2010-02-15T06:00Z,"Also, I've never heard of senseinai's claims that Xilisoft are a bunch of scammers.  Their software fits in a niche of other such products, and does what it advertises."
[T],NoggintheNomad,2010-02-15T18:11Z,"Spot on, Zog. 5.0.74 downloaded from the developer website works perfectly with the KCNScrew serial. In the absence of any seeders, this appears to be the easiest route to follow."
,senseinai,2010-02-15T20:58Z,Maybe if you guys ACTUALL READ my comment you'll see that I simply referred you to what was being warned about on Version Tracker.
