,suzuki600srad,2010-05-11T11:11Z,"i have downloaded thanks, i have burnt to disk but my 360 just says media disk and wont read it, can this be done from a hard drive please help as the area i live in wont let me have this content from xbox live cheers "
,scandle616,2010-05-12T06:22Z,hi is this from the game ov the year disk or is it only safe for jtagged/banned consoles 
,micnor14,2010-08-17T03:36Z,"It'd really help if at least 2 reputable people confirmed this is the real deal, and then which manner recommended to use it. Inside the RARs is a folder named ""4D53082D"" which should be the savegame folder in the HDD. Beneath that is another numbered folder then finally a large file (this being the actual DLC files I guess) with a huge-ass file name that's too long for me to post. I take it we copy this to the HDD via any of the methods easily available online, and the DLC will magically register. Someone else PLEASE confirm working or not. "

,s1zl4h,2010-12-08T13:21Z,"To get this to work you would usually use a program like Xtaf and a flash drive, but i have tried it twice now, both times saying that the DLC Content is corrupt."
