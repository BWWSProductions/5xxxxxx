,ghost232323,2011-01-10T08:19Z,"For everyone new to jailbreaking, or who just needs help, I'm fucking good with these things. basic tutorial:

make sure your device is running iOS 4.1 (newest version with stable JB, and it's nice to operate) DO NOT UPGRADE TO iOS 4.2.1!!!!!!

If you are running iOS 4.2.1, sorry man, give up now!!! No stable untethered jailbreak has been released!!!

If you have iOS 4.1, continue on (if lower that iOS 4.1, upgrade please...)

READ EVERYTHING OVER ONCE BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY DELICATE PROCESS AND YOU CAN'T MISS ANYTHING!!! It's really simple once you know exactly what to do

Sync with iTunes and be sure a backup has been made (this is just in case, I've done 17 iDevices and never needed to do this)

download: http://limera1n.com/

plug in your device and close iTunes

Run limera1n and follow instructions to enter DFU mode (hold home plus power, release power but keep holding home bull shit)

This may take a few tries with new jailbreakers. WARNING!!! The timers are not perfect! be patient and keep trying.

Once this is done, you'll see that beautiful looking limera1n logo on your iDevice

Once your device boots up, shut it down and reboot it (hold power until you see ""slide to power off"" logo thingy) (it's always good to reboot, so just do it)

There should now be a new app on the springboard called limera1n, if it has a white icon, disregard this...

Open limera1n and click on cydia, click install and let it do it's thing...

When that's done, reboot again (always good) and open limera1n again. Uninstall limera1n as it's now useless... "
,ghost232323,2011-01-10T08:20Z,"Next to get some jailbreak tweaks and apps to play cracked ipa files (like this torrent) and I'll show you some awesome tricks you will soon not be able to live without...

Open cydia and click manage at the bottom

click sources

click edit at the top right

click add at the top left

and now add these sources (cydia offers awesome tweaks and apps, but for a price... Bull shit right? these sources give you those EXACT apps and tweaks for free!!! I know, I'm awesome =P)

Sources:

http://ihacksrepo.com/
http://cydia.imodzone.net/
http://repo.insanelyi.com/
http://sinfuliphonerepo.com/
http://cydia.hackulo.us/


add ALL of them (I know what I'm talking about...)

then click search (bottom left) and type ""appsync"" without the quotes of coarse, and select the one called ""AppSync for OS 4.1"" from insanelyi repo (I just trust them). This will let you sync cracked apps

Next search ""bigboss"" and install ""BigBoss's Source"" from Cydia/Telesphoreo (unless it's already there, if it has a tick next to it, skip this step)

Next search ""sbsettings"" and select the one calles ""SBSettings"" from BigBoss. This is an awesome tweak for quick access from the spring board. Just swipe the top of your screen from left to right and switch things on and off quick (I love) "
,ghost232323,2011-01-10T08:21Z,"(you should now know how to search and install) Search ""cydelete"" and install the one from BigBoss

""gpower"" install ""GPower Pro"" from insanelyi (when you hold power, you can power off, reboot or respring, very useful)

""icon renamer"" from BigBoss (hold an icon till it jiggles then tap it to rename)

""cydelete"" from BigBoss (lets you uninstall cydia apps fome springboard, make jiggle and click close)

(optinal, I like) ""infiniboard"" from iHacksRepo. Allows you to scroll down on your springboard, like having a list. So all games on one page =)

(optional) ""locktopus"" from iHacksRepo. Password lock separate apps, hold till jiggles and click lock. Change password in settings, default is ""password"" (original...)

""scrollingboard"" from iHacks repo (unlimited apps and folders on springboard

(optional) ""winterboard"" from Cydia/Telesphorepo (lets you install custom themes, I don't like as slows down iDevice...)

And last but not least!!! My absolute favorite app!!!

""installous"" and install ""Installous 4"" from Hackulo.us

Literally the whole appstore, but cracked!!! Millions of paid apps, for FREE!!! You will soon never be able to live without this app. I absolutely love this as i can have millions of games and apps (iPhone 4 32GB =P) without paying a cent!


I hope this helped as I spent a long time getting it perfect! If you REALLY need help, contact me on ghost23@live.co.za NO SPAM OR STUPID QUESTIONS PLEASE!!!

Good luck people and enjoy the beauty of the jailbreak!!!

Big thank you to geohot for making limera1n, a true masterpiece!!! "
