New Poker Bot collects information from several sources including your hole cards, table position and your opponents actions. The data is stored in a neural network that predicts the hand strengths of your opponents! And then determines the best course of action, once it is your turn based on ALL the information available including the actions made in the current round of betting. It does NOT use a scripted playing profile that does the same thing over and over It makes adjustments in real time based on all the actions of the players you are sitting with.
