The rules needed to play "Harpoon 4" by Clash of Arms Games. Probably *THE* naval battle wargame. Note that the data annex included does not include weapon and sensor systems data annex, only for the platforms (ships, aircraft and subs) themselves. I will fix this when I find the other annex files.

From http://www.clashofarms.com/harpoon4.html:

Announcing a little something that will blow you away! The era of modern naval combat began on October 21, 1967 when Egyptian missile boats launched four Soviet made Styx surface-to-surface missiles and sank the Israeli destroyer Elath at a range of 13.5 nautical miles. The face of naval warfare changed forever!

Harpoon 4, by Larry Bond and Chris Carlson handles all aspects of maritime combat: surface, sub-surface, and air. Harpoon 4 is a system of detailed but comprehensible rules covering the many facets of modern naval actions. Consistent rating systems and evaluations of the capabilities of modern naval vessels, aircraft, submarines, and helicopters make it possible to achieve realistic results when simulating known situations, by extension Harpoon 4 also achieves realistic results with hypothetical scenarios. Harpoon 4 can answer questions like:

Are carriers powerhouses or sitting ducks?
Can transatlantic convoys survive in a modern wartime environment?
In the cat-and-mouse games between US and Russian submarines, which is better?

But Harpoon 4 is more than a highly detailed simulation of modern naval tactics: it is a game which provides hours of enjoyment and recreation. Its treatment of modern naval warfare is the best available short of being on the bridge yourself. Extensive examples in the rules book actually take you through mini engagements that span less than a page of text. The set of die-cut counters included in the game, along with the Quickstart rules, make it possible to take this game home and play a scenario in an evening. For a few hours, lead ships going in harm's way.
