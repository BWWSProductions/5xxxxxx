CJ vs DJ
The Oil Match
Date: Feb 10, 2010

Performers: CJ and DJ

This week DJ takes on newcomer CJ. Both are similar in size and both have big fat cocks. With the record of 2-1 on NK, DJ is on his way to the top. CJ is a tough boy and he can take a lot. He's lanky and uses his long legs to his advantage. The last round can go either way because it's the oil round. This is where the disadvantaged wrestler gets an opportunity rack up points. Either way, one is going to be the other one's bitch for the day
