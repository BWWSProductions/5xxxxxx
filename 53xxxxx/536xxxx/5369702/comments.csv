,Jorba,2010-03-21T15:27Z,"Same here, keeps asking me to insert a disk???"
,Messageis,2010-04-27T16:42Z,Has anyone figured this one out as yet?
,Ch3miX,2010-11-04T15:20Z,Asking for disk!!!
,daddy1234,2011-03-14T15:47Z,"I think you need to put this download on disk, then load it from there. That way it won't ask for the disk"
,rosocool1,2012-02-20T15:43Z,"I tried to put it on a disc and use it that way, it does not work. So now I am turning the files into a .img file and Im going to burn that to a disc. I'll tell you if it works!"
,TeJan1tor,2012-04-27T04:15Z,"Ok,this might work. Get Power ISO,and install it so that when u look in my computer,it is displayed there. Then what you do is ""mount image"" of reason,to the virtual drive. I can't explain this step by step cos its 3AM GMT,and I have had a version of reason on mine for a while. Select number of drives as 1. What will happen if u get it right is reason wont ask for the disk and will begin installation,which takes ages,so don't panic. I hope this helps,most of the copies will be ISO mount. "
