My english isnt perfect but, i also slow it down, so spammers and no englishs are able to understand what i tryin 2 say. That may be the reason of allot of Folks here, for bad english. But, i think if u try to speak German, i`ll lough my ass off..."
,knucklepunt,2010-02-14T22:56Z,"You tell 'em, darkpat.  You're welcome to tell those f-ing spammers to f-off in any language you want.

It's universally understood that they need to go dig a hole somewhere, bury their head in it, and leave the pirating to the pirates.

So alles gut und kein problem!"

,GimmeGimme416,2010-02-16T14:33Z,"It's not about the native tongue but more about the language being used.  If you're going to insult someone...and this really isn't the place for it unless you don't have a life...then the least you can do is spell correctly.  But then again, trailor trash seldom do.
You want to spew your garbage then start your own blog.  Comments here are meant to be critical of the movie being submitted.
So?  How is the movie?"
