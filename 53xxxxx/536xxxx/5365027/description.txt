Extra info:
This one off many Mix tape's me and my friends got off the various DJ's in Clubs.. many DJ's sold tapes they recorded (with 3 Tape-decks at once) during there set.


Used for recording: 
AKAI HQ Tape-deck connected (analog) to a SONY MD recorder what converts the analog input to a digital signal witch i used for recording, used a PC with a Audigy2 soundcard and Sony SoundForge 9 for the recordings and Mastering.
Tried to give them a clear sound.. think they sound OK.. remember these are cassette tapes and they are more then 16 years old...
