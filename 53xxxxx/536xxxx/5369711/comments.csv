,dusna,2010-02-17T09:41Z,To Morgneto: don't you have stereo reproductors? The problem could be that your player uses 5.1 audio channel for lost but since you would have stereo you could hear all sounds great but dialogs would be very quiter.
,Zapp505,2010-02-17T21:33Z,"Sound is always more quiet because in the 720p HD version its not Stereo but 5.1 Dolby Surround, which is more quiet if you play it on stereo speakers. You can natively turn up the volume when the episode is playing in windows media player. In your taskbar there should be an icon for ffdshow, mkv or ac3filter. Right click it and click on audio options, then you see a slider where you can give the volume more dB."
