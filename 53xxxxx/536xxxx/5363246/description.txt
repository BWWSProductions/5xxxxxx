Telstar Records was a record label founded in 1982 by 
Sean O Brien and Neil Palmer with a government loan of 
Â£120,000. 
t was founded as a specialist compilation marketing label 
and had hits with a range of compilation franchises such 
as the Deep Heat, Kaos Theory and 100% ranges, as well as 
these brands the company would licence a number of major 
artist recordings (for example ABBA and the Four Tops) to 
release telemarketed compilations.

In the mid 1990s it diversified its output into the singles 
market and long-term artist development with the launch of 
the Multiply Records and Wildstar Records subsidiaries. 

Prior to these developments Telstar would normally only 
release singles that were tele-marketed and associated 
products like The Chippendales or PJ and Duncan aka. 

Acts signed in this period included Conner Reeves, Sash!, 
Phats And Small and Basement Jaxx, while Craig David brought 
the first ever UK number one single for the label.

Other artists included Victoria Beckham (a sub-licence deal 
from 19 Records), Rosie Ribbons, Skream!, The Cheeky Girls 
and Mis-Teeq.

In the late 1990s, Telstar became closely associated with 
BMG Records, especially with the Telstar TV compilation arm 
and The Hits Album releases.

Telstar Records went bankrupt in 2004, largely due to the 
company's habit of giving large advances to artists such as 
Claire Sweeney, Victoria Beckham and Rosie Ribbons who failed 
to make them any money. 
In the media much of the blame for the label's failure was 
placed on their most high profile signing, Victoria Beckham. 

However as most of Telstar's roster were not directly signed 
to the label, instead being either sub-licenced or part of 
number of joint ventures, BMG (soon to be merged with Sony) 
declined in buying the label's assets outright.

There is not much to say about this album as their is no
reviews that i could find, but it does have 9 number one hits 
and the rest were from the Top Ten.

So all in all a good mix of tracks to take those from this era
on a trip down their own personel memory lane..... and hopefully
find some new fans along the way.
