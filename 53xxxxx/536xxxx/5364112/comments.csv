,YakTheManiac,2010-02-15T21:01Z,"DarkMovie is a spammer.  I wouldn't believe anything he says.  I visited his site and you have to fill out a survey or NO access.

I downloaded this movie and the video is not the best, but its the best I have seen for this movie on this site as of today.  And the ""PRICE IS RIGHT"".  Downloaded it in 33min."
,secondoable,2010-02-15T21:29Z,"almost everywhere you must fill survey to see movie.
i tried and after survey site opens movie for you, at least on boorek, where i saw this one. so if you dont mind filling survey you can see it there!working!video q. ok!"
,izzysimpson,2010-02-17T01:23Z,"hey, how do i watch it? its all like, different files.."

,zztoops,2010-02-22T20:56Z,I wish people would stop putting site up that want you to fill out a bunch of crap before you can watch the movie all it does it give them your email address so they can send you a bunch of crap and unwanted email they must get paid for this cause it a waste of time if you don't
,villads,2010-02-24T23:46Z,"Great Vid man Thanks for uploading, and great download speed. Thank you Mister Raymondhome ;) !"
,bychance,2010-03-02T02:50Z,stay away from darkmovies or anything that sounds like . it's just spam.
,watbol,2010-04-02T02:51Z,"I never understood the concept of RAR in a torrent???
They are not being EMAILED where you would NEED files < 14Megs, ya know???
Torrents DO continue if logged off and back on, ya know???

Now I have to waste diskspace to get this, waste more to open it, just to watch it???
Wouldn't it be better for all if they just sent the AVI in the frst place???
Just a thought, nothing more... nothing less.
