PLUS, this great effort is further compromised with Joint stereo, not even proper stereo, but a pale version that destroys the high frequencies and seperation.
If this was in 320 Dual Channel, it would take up so little extra disk space, and then be in the best MP3 format there is.
I am just off to wash my car, but I am going to leave one door dirty and untouched, you are my inspiration!"

Thanks, I guess, you gave me a laugh out loud moment... 
If you don't like this quality then just go buy it!! You support the artist and get the best quality you could ask for! MP3's in my opinion should be treated as previews and when you like a band/artist you just buy their stuff... it's not science.

And as for this compilation: I collected it all from the net from every possible source I could find and it took a long time. And I think it's good enough!
So, go finish that door and drive in a clean car to you music store!!"
