,Dragonite_9,2010-12-08T03:19Z,"For you interested in this great movie, here is a torrent I'm seeding.
It's the best torrent you could find, I have compared them all, and it's not perfect, but it has the best sound and best picture too:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6020043/Pyaapossible_2010_BDRip_x264-daWaith_%28A_Cureless_Release%29_%28Best_

Enjoy!

PS. Took me forever to get a descent copy, so after going through over 50 torrent sites, I finaly found a copy with 1 seeder, and took forever to get it home, so now I changed it a bit and uploaded it here, with ~ 5Mbit/s line, because I want to share this great movie, a version that accually is possible to whatch, without any out of sync Subs (as Vomit's version has). Thanks to the from beginning whoever posted the source that the BDRip is made from, here is it, seeding as much as I can!
