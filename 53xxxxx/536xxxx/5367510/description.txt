Notes:
I'm very proud to bring this material to you.
The release date of this content wasn't a casualty... Today, 02/16/10, exactly
one year ago, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm and Peter Sunde were prosecuted
with the only clear charge of promote the knowledge between the
World-Wide-Web Community. It was an unfair trial with the dumbest charges,
the most ridiculous prosecutors and a corrupt judge heading it.

So, the first release of the Black Sun Group it's dedicated in recognition to the
effort of Fredrik, Gottfrid and Peter on bring free knowledge to the people, and to
say to the world of the Registered Media that the WWW Community will never
surrender, we will fight till the end, we will break every protection you could
create, WE are HERE to STAY, WE ARE THE FUTURE!
The knowledge it isn't a privilege, it's a gift, and as such, it should be
FREE FOR ALL!
You will never beat us, because our intentions are pure, our determination is solid
and our passion for knowledge is limitless!

The Spectrial was relevant, not for being one of the most important trials on the
internet history, but because it opened the eyes of thousands of
persons about the importance of the free knowledge, persons like me,
persons like you. UNITED WE WILL NEVER BE DEFEATED!!

"The piracy it isn't morally illegal because it
promotes the cultural interchange and art,
that is the way I see it."
                             Leonardo @ #Spectrial, Black Sun Group Founder.

Enjoy the books, it was an honor to work for you, greetings from Argentina!
