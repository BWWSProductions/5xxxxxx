A State Of Trance Classics Volume 4 â€“ The Full Unmixed Versions.

(Not to be mixed with Armin van Buurens other ASOT series)


The fourth edition of the demanded A State of Trance Classics series has found its way out. With 3 successful editions out there, the endless stream of old classics gets a visit by the younger ones.
Anyone with a sharp memory and right feel for trance, will remember the 36 classics on this album. Like the previous 3 editions, A State of Trance Classics Volume 4 contains the full versions of some of tranceâ€™s most memorable anthems. Theyâ€™ve all had and have, their moments of glory down the clubs and just never grow old. 

The new generation of trance lovers will surely remember â€˜Carabellaâ€™, a collab between Galen Behr and Hydroid that was hammered by the big DJâ€™s for months in a row. Or maybe Armin van Buurenâ€™s â€˜Serenityâ€™ or â€˜Re:Locate - Rogueâ€™ will freshen their memory. On â€˜A State of Trance Classics Vol. 4â€² youâ€™ll find essential tracks, from â€˜Push -Universal Nationâ€™ to â€˜Rui Da Silva - Touch Meâ€™, â€˜Synergy - Hello Stringsâ€™ and Solar Stone - Solarcoasterâ€™, that have all helped built the trance scene to the impressive dance stream it is today.
