,sjr09,2010-07-19T23:11Z,Please seed-- it's slowed to a crawl now! Really would love to check this show out after hearing about it in Esquire Magazine.
,fiyace,2010-07-27T23:19Z,"22 hours, 49 minutes, 34.1% - please seed!"

,P2P_DownUnder,2010-08-28T06:11Z,Cheers ;)
,akaleeroy,2010-09-02T10:05Z,"Somebody post some appropriate fucking English subtitles. I had some that worked up until the climax of the episode, now is that nice?

It isn't. English subs! Doesn't matter that most of us understand English well or very well. Watching something with the English subtitles is an immensely better experience! It's the way god meant for us to share TV and movie torrents: filename with original release name or IMDB title+year, accompanied by english subtitles."
,kawaj,2010-09-05T05:10Z,Please seed.
,ditchweed,2010-09-10T19:58Z,"Crappy quality. This does not belong in Highres.
Download HD 720p or 1080p instead."
,SergeantSpoon,2010-09-19T17:59Z,"I came when I saw the download speed.

1.600 kb/s Woop Woop!"
,Dirkastanian,2010-10-08T12:43Z,Thanks for the upload!
,miknos,2010-10-21T20:39Z,"Nice to have someone who knows how to rip a dvd!

Thanks!"
,miknos,2010-10-22T23:53Z,"Adding a subtitle (even in the same language) is important so people can translate it easily.

The ones I found are synced only till middle of the episode."
,g1imdb0,2010-11-18T01:36Z,"Very nice upload thnx much!
Cheers!"
,apocolist,2010-12-19T11:06Z,"I look forward to finally seeing this show, thank you!"
,tripper511,2011-01-15T05:42Z,"akaleeroy: Go bitch somewhere else or better yet buy the damn DVD if subtitles are such a problem.  The whole show is in English, unless you deaf or English is your 3rd language then there's no reason you should need subtitles in the same language as what's being spoken."
,stylus59,2011-01-19T16:56Z,"Please anonymous please upload your HQ seasons 2, 3, and 4"
,mattjohnbass,2011-01-31T21:41Z,"please seed, download is really SLOW"
,NotTheMessiah,2011-02-01T06:25Z,Sorry for the question guys but I'm a bit of a noob. I've downloaded this torrent but when I playback it is jumpy and image does not keep up with audio. Any ideas how I can fix it?
,dullah711,2011-02-09T12:23Z,"this is as close as you can get with high res or bluray...but oh well, thanks dude! this looks promising."
,anonabyss,2011-05-06T07:09Z,Don't bother uploading if you're going to try passing off 480i as high resolution.
,fraserfinlay777,2011-05-19T22:31Z,"Awesome upload. Great Quality. Works Perfectly!

+1"
,Joker-Face,2011-09-22T04:11Z,"Quality is perfect. However, doesn't burn to disk. It is compatable via streaming with the PS3, however, the picture freezes from time to time. "
,odog0341,2012-03-10T17:28Z,Are these mp4's compatible with ipod? I know the h.264's are not. I have to convert those.
,BreakingBadFan,2012-04-11T06:48Z,For all of you asking about converting and burning DVDs then you should download ConvertxtoDvd (all one word). This converts movies and burns them pretty fast. You can search for it on this website. Its Legit!
