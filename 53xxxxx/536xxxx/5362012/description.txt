Product Description
Majdanek was unique, as the only concentration camp still operational at the time of its liberation.The concentration and extermination camp Majdanek, near Lubin, was erected in 1941, and liberated on July 23rd 1944. The speed of the Soviet advance gave the Germans no time to destroy or conceal evidence of the atrocities they had committed.
This rare and stark documentary portrays the terrible tragedy of the TWO MILLION innocent victims exterminated and the frightful efficiency of the NAZI DEATH FACTORY. Captured on film are SS Officers and Kapos appearing before a Russian Tribunal at Lubin. They are confronted by surviving inmates who are giving evidence against the accused for their hideous war crimes. It culminated in their deserved conviction and execution by hanging.
