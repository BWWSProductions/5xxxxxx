    The broad plot is a standard one, involving finding stolen goods.        
    However the details of the plot wander around the movie, mostly as       
    vehicles for showing some action scene. They have the required           
    comedic characters, as well as the Shaolin monk whose kung fu is so      
    good that he can beat people with one hand tied behind his back.         
    Overall it is a decent flick, although it doesn't have the attention     
    grabbing action that usually makes these movies so memorable
