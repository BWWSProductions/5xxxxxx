Okay, so I had previously made a torrent of this, but I hadn't seeded it in a while.  Anyway, for some reason, everyone was stuck at 99.8%, and the files on my computer had somehow changed, so I couldn't seed everyone the last two pieces.  So here's a new torrent of the same thing, but this one works.  The tracks are 256kbps, and were originally downloaded from iTunes.  Sorry for the inconvenience of having another torrent, and I hope that having the whole album this time will make up for it.  Thanks, and I hope you enjoy the music.  Also, please help me seed, because my computer isn't always on, and I'd like this torrent to stay alive.
