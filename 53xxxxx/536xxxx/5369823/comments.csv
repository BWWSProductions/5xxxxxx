Eminem - Infinite is one of the dopest songs I've heard.. don't know how so many people are sleeping on that one! Other ones I LOVED were 08, 10, 11, 23, 24 and 40. I hadn't heard most of these songs before and I listen to a lot of hip-hop. AMAZING WORK - A+"

   First off I'd like to thank you for these wonderful mixes of music.  As a huge R&B and Hip Hop fan, I really appreciate this torrent as well as your top 250 R&B.  Currently downloading all of drakes Mixtapes, (although I'm really feeling J.Coles style a little more) and wanted to again take the time to thank you for your time dedicated to putting people onto some timeless classics.
  With that being said, I'd love to chat with you about a local music magazine I'm helping to launch.  I'm looking for some very passionate people who can contribute to the hip hop content. There's no doubt your input would be very appreciated.  Feel free to email me at steve.mucciacciaro@taxzillatax.com and we can talk more about this opportunity. 
  Thanks again for the jams and be safe!"
