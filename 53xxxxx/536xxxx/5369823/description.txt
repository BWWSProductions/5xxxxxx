Top 40 Greatest Slept-On Hip-Hop / Rap Songs

This list is brought to you by: The Professor

Definition of "Slept-On" (to me): Songs missed / forgotten / not-heard by most hip-hop fans.

Any list like this is subject to a lot of bias -- I am a true hip-hop head and the purpose of creating this torrent is to share some great hip-hop songs that I feel are often over-looked or have a small audience. While I know that including the likes of Jay-Z and Snoop Dogg may catch me  flak, I feel that those songs are 'slept-on' in the sense that the artists better known (lesser quality) songs get a lot more play.

Your 'Thank you's' and comments are appreciate  ;) 

01. Eminem - Infinite (1996)
-- Almost unknown Eminem song, before 'Slim Shady'. True hip-hop, at its finest. 90's beat and sick lyricism, reminds me of Illmatic

02. The Last Emperor - Secret Wars (1998)
-- Amazing concept song, rappers vs. comic book characters

03. Big L - Put It On (1994)
-- L is just slept-on, period. One of his best tracks

04. Blackstar - Mos Def & Talib Kweli - Thieves In The Night (1998)
-- The Mos Def verse in this songs is one of the hardest hitting - ever

05. Crooklyn Dodgers '95 - Return of the Crooklyn Dodgers (1995)
-- Lesser known than its 1994 counterpart, the beat and verses are perfect, some real New York hip-hop

06. Pharoahe Monch - The Truth ft. Common & Talib Kweli (1999)
-- Sick collaboration between the three when they were at their best

17. Souls of Mischief - 93 'Til Infinity (1993)
-- One of the best beats of the 90's

-- "Mama, I got dreams... but dreams don't keep the lights on..." One of the tightest hooks I've ever heard
