,galaxyworldwide877,2010-03-01T05:38Z,"RiffTrax are downloadable audio commentaries featuring comedian Michael J. Nelson heckling (or riffing) films in the style of Mystery Science Theater 3000, a TV show in which Nelson was the head writer, and later the host. 

The movies chosen for Mystery Science Theater 3000 were predominantly low-budget B-movies because the show itself was low-budget and producers could only afford films with expired copyright or had otherwise cheap licenses. 

The idea of RiffTrax came about after Mystery Science Theater 3000 was canceled and Nelson had researched and consulted a lawyer about the possibility of directly releasing DVDs of films with the commentaries included. 

The early RiffTrax were almost all solo efforts on Mike's part, but it soon became apparent that there was a strong demand for them, and Nelson was quickly able to recruit more riffers for the project. Most official RiffTrax (not counting fan-made iRiffs and the spin-off RiffTrax Presents series) have a stable cast of Mike and former Mystery Science Theater 3000 co-stars Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, and the guest slots vary often; other MST3K alumni have been featured, such as Mary Jo Pehl and Bridget Nelson, in addition to Internet personalities Richard Kyanka (of Something Awful fame), Josh Fruhlinger (writer of The Comics Curmudgeon) and Chad Vader, as well as actors Neil Patrick Harris and Fred Willard, and satirist ""Weird Al"" Yankovic. 

So please, NEWBIES, no more comments about mislabeling or calling people assholes for adding commentary; it is supposed to be that way. A good rule of thumb on TPB is: if you don't know what something is, google it first before you comment and stick your foot in your mouth. 

@kc278 thanks for the upload."

,Koshiki,2010-11-22T11:39Z,"Always funny that people are looking for 'clean' copies of these movies and bitch about finding a riffed version... when I can't imagine watching some of them (especially THIS yawnworthy piece of crap... seriously, Troll 2 is better) /without/ the rifftrax to make them bearable."
