,listenherenow,2010-04-14T14:11Z,"Hello,
 I am Hip to the cool stuff written - all the info and warnings and everything. 

  also the fact that the keygens have some false positives that will register and all that good stuff.

  All this is seems to be a smoke screen however. I am also hip to this read me files saying it's all good and everything.

  Let me tell you why it's not all good. 
have you ever downloaded an excutable that get's hits Immediatly without being clicked?  I mean it's a Key gen, shoudl not be active till it's clicked.. right? 

  This one starts as soon as you extract it, it's not making a key for you before you need it bro - it's jacking your system, immediatly. no opening needed - no install needed.  you extract and don't stop it and poof 

 you get Trojan.Agent.CK 
Trojan.Agent.CK
Date spotted:
First seen on 2010-02-12.
Last seen on 2010-04-14.

This date is not associated with PB - look atthe date this torrent was uploaded though.

Detection statistics:
160,357 instances detected worldwide.

In non-techie terms: Trojan.Agent is part of a rogue anti-spyware program similar to Trojan.Win32 and Trojan.Win32.agent.akk. Do not under any circumstances download or purchase software related to Trojan.Agent.

   this is NOT A FALSE POSITIVE - its a virus outright.
  no key gen should be active before you click it - it should not be noticed at all by any program unless its scanned on purpose. 

   I normally am pretty trusting of users with the skull and crossbones like you have there robin hood But this incident is causing me to rethink.

  seriously - if you have an explaination as to why this key gen is secretly active upon extract - please let me know. 
I'd like to hear the explaination.

  if any of you folks extracted this and you have doubts about what I am saying, run a scan for this trojan.agent.ck Or just look it up online and see whats up.   Your infected.
"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-14T22:11Z,"@listenherenow 

I'd recommed to report this torrent if you think it's infected. Also I'd recommend to use Sandboxie. And most important: It's recommended to keep your mouth shut if you have no idea what you're talking about, cause obviously you have no clue at all. "
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-26T00:29Z,"@Nezlekhs 

Better to have trojans in your system than in your sister........ 

BTW: Next time consider to post the names of the trojans and locations, so that it can be checked or explained if necessary."
,aiseen,2010-04-28T15:30Z,hey !! what about activation ?? can i activate it ?
[T],nightstalker666,2010-05-01T23:06Z,"@aiseen yes you can activate it and it will work like a charm :)

Also for anyone saying this has trojans etc in it thats wrong its as clean as a whistle and works like a charm i use it myself"
,Jangfett,2010-05-08T16:37Z,"PROBLEM-PLEASE HELP

It says too many installations. You many only activate the software on a limited number of computers. Because you have reached that limit you must either stop protecting another computer or buy another subscription.

The email that it says I need to log in with is daddy.neil@hotmail.co.uk

Thanks for your help"
,llonewolf,2010-05-20T02:26Z,"Yo R.Hood I would like to confirm this I scan with Trend Micro 2009 i just bought the comp and i want a full anti-virus software and it happen to come with TMIS trial. The threat name is CRCK_KEYGEN 
im thinking it wouldnt matter cause i use alot of keygen in the past for DVD-r related programs, risk is high spyware IF anything happen would a whole system back up with dvd disk solve it it crashes?"
,slikkstar,2010-05-21T14:54Z,Will this work alongside of Trend Micro Antivirus + Spyware or will I have to choose one or the other?
,slikkstar,2010-05-21T14:59Z,Oh belay my last man. I just got off the TM website.. I'm going for it. =]
,slikkstar,2010-05-21T17:32Z,"Hey I just got this all set up. Work perfectly and as said. No sketch. I'll be watching for more from you and I'm going to take your recommendation on sandboxie. =]

,tdh13,2010-08-25T23:10Z,my temporary antivirus (panda free) deleted it and said the keygen was a virus... :(
,godfather15228,2010-08-30T23:47Z,"Great UpLoad! One question though, does anyone know of a 64 bit upload flying around? Im pretty sure this keygen will work but maybe Im just missing something idk... xP Anyways Good looks R.Hood! And to all the fags screaming Torjans... go suck a scorpion's tail!"
,edvinoo,2010-09-13T14:17Z,"WTF ?!


Option 1:
Transfer protection here from another computer
Log into your Trend Micro account to deactivate the software on another computer, and then activate it here instead. To get started, enter your account password and click Next.

So what do I do about this 'too many installations'??"
,icommentonquality,2011-06-21T07:07Z,"WARNING: THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK ANYMORE, I DOWNLOADED THIS IN 2010 AND IT EXPIRED IN 2011, I TRIED TO DO IT AGAIN BUT IT SAYS TOO MANY INSTALLATIONS.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"
,slaughter71_2000,2011-07-15T21:18Z,"hello RobbingHood , i have tried to download it and it has to have a password to go further on the install would you please help me please so i can finish the install NAJA4OVER7HEART@HOTMAIL.COM ? password please to slaughter71_2000@yahoo.com"
,SnapplerX,2011-09-01T07:39Z,"for all you idiots who keep complaining about needing a password:

This means that someone already used the key you generated and signed up with their email and password and installed on the max amount of computers. RH is not going to know their password, so stop asking. You just have to find a serial that hasn't been used yet.

P.S. RH is the shit!! thanks for your hard work"
,SnapplerX,2011-10-16T21:18Z,i tried every key in this keygen and all of them are taken.
