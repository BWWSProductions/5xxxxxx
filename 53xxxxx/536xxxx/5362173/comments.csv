Thanks.

@gldelking: ""Growth"" was up, weeks ago, but, as many other movies stayed without seeder and was deleted. It happens. Reup is technically not possible. I loaded the torrent and would seed next 6 hours if anyone wants to finish."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-14T16:10Z,@womenball: I have it but I need to encode it and than find a free slot. Tomorrow for sure.

downloading this for their kids.(I think)

you stole it?I think not.So
