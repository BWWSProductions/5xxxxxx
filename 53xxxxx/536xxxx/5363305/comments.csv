,kheady,2010-12-20T06:46Z,To the 2 posters who said it wouldn't load with windows 7 64bit. It is because there is no 64bit version of NHC at this time. Their website says a 64bit version is coming soon. But the current versions are for 32bit windows only.
,Bingoas,2011-11-14T19:31Z,Muchas Gracias ! Work well.
