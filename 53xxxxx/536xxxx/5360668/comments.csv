,passdashooga,2010-02-14T17:56Z,"ummm... i don't know a lot about this show, but is it supposed to be soft gay porn? i've watched all four eps and it went from being a tit-fest to this episode, which is the gayest thing i have ever watched. I don't mean gay as in ""that shirt is pretty gay"", i mean gladiators bending over little boys gay. WTF?!?!?"
,SlyJude,2010-02-16T04:07Z,"Passdashooga, it was one scene with a gay gladiator. Don't be such a damn homophobe."
,scarygood48,2010-02-17T12:31Z,"@passdashooga, if you want realistic then you are going to have to put up with the ""gayest thing i ever watched"".  The romans had more gay sex than straight sex.  I guess if you are a homophobe you would be turned off by this and the solution is pretty simple; stop watching."
,passdashooga,2010-02-18T16:02Z,"@SlyJude, Just because I don't like watching gay sex does not make me a homophobe. I don't like watching my Grandma have sex, that does not mean I hate my Grandma. Likewise with homosexuals.

@scarygood48, I'm not a homophobe, and I know this is hard for you to comprehend, but I just don't like watching young boys being fucked in the ass. I thought people should know that this ep contains man-boy ass fucking in case they feel the same way as me."
,ShivAsmodaeus,2010-02-23T16:51Z,"@passdashooga, I think your concerns are valid.  Some people have weak constitutions, and they should be protected from any and all questionable material at all costs.  I'm sure it came as a less than pleasant surprise to the see the activities contained in this episode, but if you'd like, I can Google you up a therapist.  Perhaps a trauma counselor?

For the rest of us that aren't whiny little girls and can handle a certain degree of questionable material (be it violence, frank depictions of sexual themes, or perhaps even the odd boobie), while we appreciate your vehement warnings, I'm sure we'll be alright."

I quote you...""I don't like watching my Grandma have sex""
