,XoLWoX,2010-02-17T00:42Z,"i lost my skull cause i have to argue with a bunch of fags that wont leave me alone ----

Veletfog told me so"
,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-17T01:13Z,Last time I checked Velvetfrog told us you were too pigheaded to listen to the rules of labeling your torrents correctly and playing the game straight on Suprbay
,XoLWoX,2010-02-17T01:17Z,"yes that was the first time i lost my skull

VelvetFog Wrote:No idea. It wasn't me.

Some reasons I can think of:

Comment spamming or feuding."
,XoLWoX,2010-02-17T01:34Z,"im gonna change my attitude from this point on ---- i will not talk to knock about anything cause the mods are watching him ---- will start putting in 2009 if imdb says its a 2009 movie ---- i will also only put R5 in the title

THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY"
,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-17T01:46Z,R5.Line instead of R5 DvDrip?
,XoLWoX,2010-02-17T02:13Z,yes
,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-17T02:35Z,"Will you give source credit where it is due?

R5.Line.Noir is an example that comes to mind :)

Keep in mind people will still thank you for the seedbox service."
,XoLWoX,2010-02-17T02:50Z,host shutdown my seedbox trying to get new one :(
,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-17T02:52Z,"So you will be labeling torrents correctly with correct source credit?

R5.Line.Noir (Example)

Credit to noir for video. Credit to other guy for audio?"

,bychance,2010-02-18T03:18Z,"I found  emery2010 by reading the comments on your uploads and I don't have
 any complaints about his uploads. So is there any chance that you can put
 up a decent copy of ""edge of darkness""so that we can say really nice things about you?.
Thanks for now.  "

This seems to be somewhat of what you are looking for but be warned the audio on some of these releases are a bit 'off' (I myself watched a copy last night that audio was 5/10 at parts but overall watchable) this copy however seems to have a different line source or the source has been tweaked. Hope this helps :)"
,bychance,2010-02-20T14:23Z,"Thanks awsome2012, I appreciate your help. I'm downloading it now.  We need all the good
uploaders we can get and Xolwox has the talent for it. We just need to encourage him to be
the best that he can be."
,XoLWoX,2010-02-20T14:40Z,how do you guys like the new description i have
,XoLWoX,2010-02-20T22:26Z,like i said im not talking to knockv2 cause no one cares about you
,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-21T04:24Z,Lovers tiff is it?
,bychance,2010-02-21T05:07Z,"Awsome2012, it's been 4 days now since xolwox uploaded , how do you expect new work if he is
 preocupied with writing a soap opera?."

,perpdonk,2010-02-22T01:05Z,"Can I point out something that made me laugh...

People getting mad at someone for supposedly stealing someone's rip...of a stolen movie?

The very definition of irony."
