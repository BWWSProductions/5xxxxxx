Hereâ€™s an excellent review from Bladezone.com ;

Review by Sebastian.


This is it. Don't look any further. Had I known this release was on its wayâ€š I would have found it difficult to give many of the other Blade Runner bootlegs the maximum rating in the past. 
This "Esper Productions" double cd private release isâ€š to dateâ€š the most comprehensive and accurate Blade Runner version to see the light of day. Where every other BR bootleg faltersâ€š this version is resilient. I believe it's as close as we've ever come to the "Ultimate Blade Runner Soundtrack" so far. With so many Blade Runner boots out thereâ€š many reading this review might be askingâ€š "so what's the big deal?" I'll give it a shot:

Basicallyâ€š this release parts on a similar premise of the 2000 OWM release (i.e. a double disc release trying to take music from every BR source) but takes this idea much farther with never-before-heard
music and excellent production quality. For the first timeâ€š this release has virtually ALL of the music from the film (Directors Cut and 1982 theatrical release). Highlights of new goodies on these
discs:

- Most noteworthyâ€š this release debuts "Thinking of Rachael" - the shorter and different take of the Love Themeâ€š (heard only in the 1982 theatrical release where Deckard dozes off on his piano). A first on any release.

- For the first timeâ€š the incidental music heard when Deckard wakes Rachaelâ€š just before their escape at the end of the film is present on the track titled "Rachael Sleeps."

- At long lastâ€š (as in the film itself) the eerie electronic rumblings leading into the "Love Theme" is expanded and presented in its complete formâ€š titled "I am the Business." (The recent Deck Music and Deck Art releases decide to "chop up" this sequence into several parts for no apparent reason).

- Incidental music from the Esper photo examination film sequence is present on the track titled "Esper Analysis."

- The "Prologue and Main Titles" track contains the original "LAâ€š November 2019" sound effect cue leading into the Main Titlesâ€š as heard in the film itself. (The Deck Music and Deck Art releases
layered a spinner effect over it).

- The track titled "Deckard Enters the Bradbury" also has expanded musicâ€š not heard on any BR release.

- For the first timeâ€š the complete "Tears in Rain" dialog is presented here (i.e. "time to die" omitted from other versions).

- Lastlyâ€š this release contains interesting new mixes and transitionsâ€š (i.e. the fusion featured on the track titled "Sushi Bar-Damask Rose").

As gathered from reading many BR reviews in the pastâ€š some fans might find the brief dialog sequences distractingâ€š preferring the musical purity principle of the "Gongo" or "BR 2001" releases. Nonethelessâ€š it's clear that this Esper Productions release is extremely true to the film's atmospheric offerings while presenting all of the major themes in a very coherent and original manner. For thisâ€š and it's many new additions I find this "Esper Edition" BR release as close to perfection as it gets. Trulyâ€š a must have.

***** (5/5 stars)
