Insolent mad-men invocating Armageddon, we must raise our shields and protect our mother. A million millennia worth of innocence is now infected with illness, illusions have intercepted our intuitive nature. Anything accepted as accurate will always appear as authentic. Apocalyptic attacks are waged against our ancestors! These attempts to annihilate entire civilizations warrant immediate attention. The authoritarian archetypal asking of obedience always continues, will the arrogance ever end? Death is only a temporary solution to a permanent misunderstanding.
