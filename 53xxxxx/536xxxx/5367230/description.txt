The Way of the Gun (2000) [XviD-DVDRIP] is brought to you by EcKstasyMEDIA.


The Plot:
Two petty if violent criminals kidnap a girl being paid $1m to be a surrogate mother. As the baby is for a gangster the pair's demand for money sees several henchmen and assorted other ruthless characters head after them to Mexico. Bullets rather than talking are always going to settle this one.
