           Ex-Navy Seal Bobby Kalinowski lives a quiet, peaceful          
           life as a landscape architect in an LA suburb with his         
           wife Dawn and 16 year old daughter Brianna. Tonight they       
           are invited out for an evening on the town by new              
           neighbors clay and Elise Freeman to a happening club           
           downtown. Little did they know that this would be the          
           start of a life or death ordeal for the group. While at        
           the club, Dawn is accosted by one of the club owners,          
           Ethan Bordas. When Bobby intervenes and accidentally           
           kills Ethan defending his wife, his enraged older              
           brother, Seth, puts a one hundred thousand dollar bounty       
           on his head. Now Bobby must escape LA while being pursued      
           by every criminal, wise guy and thug in the city. Bobby        
           decides to separate from his wife and neighbors and            
           revert to his Navy Seal training to survive. To                
           complicate matters, Seth has a corrupt police sergeant         
           preventing Bobby from getting any help from the law!           
           However, they all underestimate the fighting skills and        
           abilities of Bobby Kalinowski who battles through an army      
           of thugs to finally make it back home. But, relentless,        
           Seth doesn't stop there. He targets Bobby's family next        
           and kidnaps his daughter. His plan is successful and he        
           lures Bobby to his seedy warehouse complex for the final       
           showdown.
