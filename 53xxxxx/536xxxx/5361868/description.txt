Sick of the OS activity monitor - Try Peek-A Boo!

DESCRIPTION

Peek-a-Boo is a utility to monitor and manage processes, has been described by one long-time user as "the utility I didn't realize I needed, until I'd used it."

Peek-a-Boo focuses on two things: clarity and flexibility. From the moment you first launch Peek-a-Boo, it will be clear what is happening with processes on your Mac.

Use Peek-a-Boo to twirl into process-comprehension nirvana.
