Titash Ekti Nadir Naam (Bengali: à¦¤à¦¿à¦¤à¦¾à¦¸ à¦à¦•à¦Ÿà¦¿ à¦¨à¦¦à§€à¦° à¦¨à¦¾à¦®, English: A River Named Titash) is a 1973 Bengali film directed by Ritwik Ghatak. The movie was based on a novel by the same name, written by Advaita Malla Burman. The movie explores the life of the fishermen on the bank of the Titash River in Brahmanbaria, Bangladesh.
The shooting of the movie took a toll on Ghatak's health, as he was suffering from tuberculosis at the time.

Alongside Satyajit Ray's Kanchenjungha (1962), and Mrinal Sen's Calcutta 71, Titash Ekti Nadir Naam is one of the earliest films to resemble hyperlink cinema, featuring multiple characters in a collection of interconnected stories, both predating Robert Altman's Nashville (1975).

In 2007, A River Named Titash topped the list of 10 best Bangladeshi films, as chosen in the audience and critics' polls conducted by the British Film Institute.
