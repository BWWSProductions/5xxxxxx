We meet Madison (Roemer) as she and her brother are watching her mentally unstable father blow his brains out. Yay, kicking things off with a bang! Fast forward several years, and she's just about to start college, the very same college that her brother ended up taking his own life in just a year before. Talk about moving in with baggage. Upon orientation she and her new dorm mates learn that the place where they'll be hanging their hats is actually a converted mental asylum that was once run by the evil Dr. Burke. Burke had a way with his patients back in the day. He would take away their pains by making them endure all manner of heinous mutilations and then scramble their brains via optical lobotomy. After a good and bloody run, his surviving patients turned against him, and his body was never recovered. Yet, his spirit still roams these halls, carrying on his work.
