,NormanKnotNormal_,2010-02-18T07:03Z,So... how do you burn this to a CD/DVD?
[T],willrain,2010-02-19T11:25Z,"If you want burn this to a CD - convert FLACs in any program you like to a 16/44.1 format. If you want to create DVD Audio - may it will be better if you download original DVD Audio ISO image, from which these tracks have been received."
,NormanKnotNormal_,2010-02-19T17:35Z,"tnx willrain for ul!  It seems the files came from the 2-channel tracks of an SACD.  The graphs, booklet and tracks can be organized onto a DVD.  It would be nice to have a rip of the DVD of this same title rather than the SACD."
[T],willrain,2010-02-20T10:52Z,"Tracks was received from DVD Audio version of disc, you can find them at http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=986408. As you see, image hosting, which has been used for covers upload is down. This covers from SACD that i had"
,NormanKnotNormal_,2010-02-22T18:29Z,Yes... I had looked at the SACD cover.  So I guess someone ripped the 5.1 audio from the DVD-A version and converted it to 2 channel FLAC's?  tnx again.
