This is borderlands version 1.21 with Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot and The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned. To install, simply extract the folder anywhere you want; all files are in their proper directories. This does work online, and you do not need the CD to run, simply run Borderlands.exe.

This is an amalgamation of "Borderlands_v1.2.1_Update-RazorDOX-[tracker.BTARENA.org]" by AiTB, "Borderlands 1.20 + Dr. Ned DLC + Mad Moxxi's DLC | PreCracked" by Actic0ne, "Borderlands.Mad.Moxxis.Underdome.Riot.DLC-RELOADED" by williewonk1, and "Borderlands.The.Zombie.Island.of.Dr.Ned.DLC-RELOADED" by ViPER^-; all I did is install all these torrents, compress the new borderlands folder, and add it to this torrent.

Please seed atleast 1:1, and thank Arctic0ne, AiTB, williewonk1, ViPER^-, and myself every time you start it. I know I thank those guys.
