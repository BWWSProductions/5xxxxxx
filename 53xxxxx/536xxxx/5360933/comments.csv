,wwhhee,2010-03-30T08:32Z,S03E01 is missing the portion before the opening music theme. Is this the same for the other episodes?
,evil_gusgus,2010-03-30T20:57Z,"@dazzledp - Go download VLC Player and they will all work fine.

@wwhhee - I never noticed that but no, all the other ones are fine as I just checked them."
