All seven of American Music Club's albums (California & United Kingdom are on one album) released from 1985 to 1994 before the band went on hiatus. I'd recommend starting with either California or Everclear and then moving back into the rest of their 80s material. Despite what has been said about their earlier stuff (AMG gave Restless Stranger a ridiculous 2 star rating), I strongly prefer it over anything post-California. But hey, it's all worth a listen, so go about it whichever way you want.

contains:
(1985) The Restless Stranger (1998 Remaster)
(1987) Engine (1998 Remaster)
(1989) United Kingdom/California (Compilation)
(1991) Everclear
(1993) Mercury
(1994) San Francisco
