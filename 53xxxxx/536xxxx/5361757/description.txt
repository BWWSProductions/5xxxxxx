Full title:
'Campion's Ghost [The Sacred & Profane Memories Of
John Donne, Poet]

Edmund Campion was a jesuit priest who defied the
Tudor state's protestant orthodoxy. He was captured
in 1581 and sentenced to death. He died December 1,
1581. Subsequently he was beatified. 

A grisley footnote is that the ropes used in his
quartering were retained and each year are placed
on the altar at the mass celebrating his feast day.

This play views England's Catholic - Protestant divide
through the eyes of poet cleric John Donne.
