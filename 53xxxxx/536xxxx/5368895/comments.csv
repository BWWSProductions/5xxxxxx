[V],hiest,2010-02-20T16:43Z,"This is a genuine reseter :

Note: After u reset , u have to shut down the spyware doctor and re launch . To shut down spyware doctor , just right clicking the spyware doctor icon from the system tray and choose the shutdown option, it takes 15 seconds to shutdown, Now relaunch it again and see , The registration would have been reseted into 
unregistered version which enables u to update the product, after updating , register it again with the keys provided in the notepad file of this torrent......

Hope my comment would be helpful......


No virus found : Scanned with Norton 2010."

It pretty much hijacked all my activities. I could not run most of my programs or even go to the control panel to delete it. I restarted several times and finally Spyware Doctor was able to start. I did a scan and literally watch Spyware Doctor yank that piece of garbage from my computer. Now my computer is fine.

Just wanted to share this information in case anyone else encounters this virus. Thanks again."
