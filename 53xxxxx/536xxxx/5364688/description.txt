{From the dvd case}
Journey into the fantastical world of LABYRINTH starring David Bowie and a cast of incredible creatures created by Jim Henson and produced by the Master of Myth George Lucas!

Frustrated with baby-sitting on yet another weekend night, Sarah - a teenager with an active imagination - summons the Goblins from her favorite book "Labyrinth" to take her baby step-brother away.  When little Toby actually disappears, Sara must follow him into the world of the fairy tale to rescue him from the wicked Goblin King (Bowie)!

Guarding his castle is The Labyrinth itself - a twisted maze of deception, populated with outrageous characters and unknown dangers.  To get through it in time to save Toby, Sarah will have to outwit the King by befriending the very Goblins who protect him, in hopes that their loyalty isn't just another illusion in a place where nothing is as it seems
