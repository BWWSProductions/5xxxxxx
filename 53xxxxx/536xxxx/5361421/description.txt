If these songs really are The Greatest Hits Of 1998 then it was a 
terribly sad year for music! 40 tracks on two CDs and barely a 
handful of decent tracks among them. 

Disc One:
_________
 
Let Me Entertain You by Robbie Williams is brilliant, 
Robbie at his very best. 
Brimful Of Asha by CornerShop defies description. 
A simple tune, lyrics quirky to the point of incomprehensiblity yet... 
it's fantastic!

Sadly, that's it for really good tracks but worthy of mention are;
Torn by Natalie Imbruglia, a nice bit of easy listening 
and Say You Love Me by Simply Red, a standard Drunken Last Dance 
At The Disco number,a potential deal closer for the would be Romeo
... Just not one of their best though.

The rest are truly dismal / abysmal / bad beyond belief with the very 
worst being; The Ballard Of Tom Jones by Space With Cerys Of Catatonia 
and Doctor Jones by Aqua but a special place in Hell is reserved for 
Vindaloo and Three Lions. Football Anthems. Say no more. Please!


Disc Two:  
_________

The best is undoubtably Life Is A Flower by Ace Of Base which I honestly 
don't remember hearing at the time but it's really rather good nonetheless, 
also Its Like That by Run DMC vs Jason Nevins is worth memtioning.
Feel It by The Tamperer Feat Maya, High by The Lighthouse Family and 
Real Good Time by Alda are also worthy of note.
 
Kung Fu Fighting by Bus Stop Feat & Carl Douglas is truly bad and an insult
to the original which was equally fantastic. 
Sad to see Carl has sunk to these levels. What next, a guest spot on the new 
series of Noddy: The Ninja Years?. 

It's very hard to pick out the worst of this dross but When I Need You by 
Will Mellors [a cover of the Leo Sayer classic] is truly awful and; 
Sex On The Beach and Toms Party both by T-Spoon scrape so far beyond the 
bottom of the barrel.

Perhaps 1998 genuinely was a crap year when it came to music or, maybe the 
people who picked the tracks are in desperate need of a taste transplant, 
either way the vast majority of these 40 tracks are in real and undeniable 
breach of the Trades Descriptions Act. 

This two CD set recently sold on eBay for the princely sum of 50 pence 
[plus Â£2.00 P&P] and even at that price they must have seen that poor sucker, 
sorry buyer, coming. 
The other dozen copies failed to reach the more appropriate starting price of 
one single penny. Say No More!
