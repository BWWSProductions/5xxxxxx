,dardar6t9,2010-02-26T08:27Z,Can someone plz explain how to convert this to play on dvd? I have tried AVS convert X4 and also as a data file with NERO....with AVS I get a message saying that PNCRT.dll was not found. I try to play it on the pc with various players and get the message No decodable video stream.....WTF????? I have no problems with anything else I've downloaded only KilledHorse stuff. Twentyforty stuff works fine. So whats the problem with this format?

You've better download this episode in avi and don't bother with converting from rmvb to avi because it is a waste of time. I myself once try to convert rmvb file to avi and the output avi file had worse quality than input rmvb file."
