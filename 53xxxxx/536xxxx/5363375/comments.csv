,uploader4life,2010-02-14T20:59Z,I know it may appear that there is no seeders but if you download the torrent using dht at least 10 will appear and the download will progress. The speed will slowly increase as more people recieve the files and seed them.
,ffjjss,2010-02-15T03:31Z,Which language do this?
,yyw0155,2010-02-15T07:21Z,"Or go to apple's web site, download a trial version, download this torrent with the sn file only, and install. Worked for me."
,uploader4life,2010-02-15T11:54Z,"This is in english.
and yyw0155 yes you can go and download this from the apple site but using this torrent you will get a far higher chance of success and faster download speeds."
,shuwu,2010-02-15T13:36Z,Serials Works perfect Thanks!
,uploader4life,2010-02-15T14:19Z,Good to hear other people saying the serials work.
,zvoltaire,2010-02-16T04:58Z,Apterure sucks. Fucking Jobs. Great hardware sucky software. I wasted hours on this...hey anyone know what time it is?
,Jason99KR,2010-02-16T07:48Z,has memory leaking problem.. Apple is currently working on it..
,piratebay1982,2010-02-16T08:56Z,"are the brushes working? Because they are not working. not activated. 

any help"
,uploader4life,2010-02-16T12:03Z,"Serialsare for full version.
As far as i have tested the brushes work along with all of the features"
,uploader4life,2010-02-16T12:17Z,Has anybody fully downloaded this yet as i have been uploading for many days now and will continue for the foreseeable future. MR
,tarkovski2,2010-02-16T12:33Z,"The serials are:
E-346-DTS-276-WJE-172-UTP-074-KOZ-84X-5S7X
E-321-JAQ-387-KKC-187-GZN-111-NPT-1LB-5S7X

,tarkovski2,2010-02-16T12:55Z,"The full download is available from apple.com/aperture. Then use the serial, and you have the full app."
,Lolote123,2010-02-17T07:16Z,serials do not work anymore
,BRequena,2010-02-17T10:33Z,@ uploader4life... Thanks for the upload! DL used the serial and it worked perfectly...All the functions workded!
,pReStOn_C,2010-02-17T11:49Z,"@tarkovski2 it is not a good idea to post serials in posts, as they will become blacklisted and no good to anyone at all."
,uploader4life,2010-02-17T11:59Z,"@preston_c exactly serials should never be posted.
@brequena thanks"
,jkeller13,2010-02-18T04:52Z,"thanks for posting the SNs in the comments, now they are all blacklisted. good job"
,1Polymathman,2010-02-19T04:58Z,"I haven't tried this yet - still using 10.5.7 bit I wonder:
Load up the app from this download (not Apple's) figuring that the app is still clean from blacklisted numbers then block Aperture from updating with Little Snitch ??"
,vslink,2010-02-19T20:46Z,"jkeller and lolote, I don't know what you are doing but the serials are fine.

I have downloaded the most recent trial DMG right from Apple and have done fresh reinstalls after removing the license ID files in the /Library/Application/ProApps folder, and the SNs work just fine, all three.

I don't know what you are doing wrong, but with the most recent trial download of 3.0 (which still has the Feb 11 datestamp, btw) I am having no probs with activation--and I have uninstalled and reinstalled a few times on two different Macs to be sure."
,astispumante,2010-02-21T14:04Z,"uploader4life - thanks! 

I've downloaded and installed using one of the serials provided. As far as I can tell everything went well and the programme seems to be perfectly usable.

If I click on ""about Aperture"" is does not mention 'trial version' but says 'volume license' and 'licensed to - my name'. So I guess everything is how it should be, right?

Is there anything I should be doing now as regards blocking updates or other activity that would screw things up or does this now function perfectly normally in every respect?

thanks for any help, I'm new to both Mac and Aperture (1 week in).

cheers"

,PI22,2010-02-24T23:59Z,"Did anyone test the current Aperture 3 slideshow 1.0 thing update, does it still work after? "
,Lolote123,2010-02-25T06:32Z,"To vslink:

Yes thx, I tried it again and now it worked. It did not work before and kept saying that the serial was incorrect. I rebooted today after reading ur comment and not it worked... thx a lot :)"
,vslink,2010-02-25T07:41Z,Recent upgrade to 3.0.1 does NOT invalidate these serials.

Every thing works fine! I used the middle serial."
,ccocaine,2010-03-28T15:13Z,"Apple is known for it's loose policy on serial numbers. I think these will work until a large update like 3.5

thnks.

Only real man know it's cooler to seed than to leech."

,petoctopus,2010-08-15T23:14Z,"Thank you very much for this upload, it worked beautifully. I'm by admission pretty bad at installing pirated programs, used to have other people do it for me-but you made this incredibly easy. It's a program I've wanted since I bought my Mac last year, having been addicted to Adobe Photoshop, but couldn't afford it. Just wanted to express my gratitude. I do have a question though: being that it's a trial version will it expire after a certain amount of time?"
,wsmithson,2010-11-02T03:11Z,"Everything works, I would suggest downloading the trail directly from Apple, saves time. 
(http://www.apple.com/aperture/)
Use any of the keys, *ALL* of them work, I have just tested, they all check out with flying colors.

Thank you so much! I wanted this as a present from my parents, and just saved them $200.. WIN.  

Only real man know it's cooler to seed than to leech."
