         DATELINE: PAWPRINT STADIUM, ANIMAL OLYMPICS       
         ISLAND - For the first time in sports history,      
       animals from five continents are on hand to        
         match their skills in world-class championship       
          athletic competition - and you'll see all the          
            action LIVE from Z.O.O., the network that            
           brings out "The Beast in Sports!"                    
                                                             
               Here's your ticket for a classic animated         
               special the whole family will enjoy. Animalympics
               is a mad and marvelous cartoon comedy jam-packed 
               with a laugh menagerie of animal contestants.

                 For fourteen days, the competition rages.
               You'll meet international stars like Bruce
               Kawakimoto, the duck expert in the esoteric
               martial art of "No Can Do"; Kit Mambo, the
               long-distance lioness matched up against
               Europe's top goat marathon runner Rene Fromage;
               Byonique Boar, the mechanically perfect ski-slope
               wizard, and lovely Eurasian gymnast Tatyana
               Tushenko, whose floor exercises may floor you.

                 From Steven Lisberger, who would later go on
               to make TRON, we (again) bring you this largely
               forgotten classic. To celebrate the 2010 Winter
               Olympics, we're updating our VHS rip from 2006
               with a sharp DVD rip, unavailable in any English-
               speaking countries! It has a German title screen,
               but features the original English soundtrack.
               We had to do a little cleanup on the spliced in
               German intro, which was looking rather pale, and
               like it had been stuck on a shelf for quite a
               while.

                 Although it featured plenty of voice talent
               (Gilda Radner, Billy Crystal and Harry Shearer),
               Animalympics never got the exposure intended for
               it. Originally commissioned by NBC as two separate
               shows for each of the Olympics in 1980, only the
               winter special aired. The other half was pulled
               from the Moscow Summer Olympics, along with all
               US athletes, due to Jimmy Carter's boycott of
               the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Who could have
               known the US would find themselves occupying it
               just a couple decades later? Anyhow, the two parts
               were instead edited together into a feature length
               animation piece, and although it saw very limited
               theatrical release, it did well in the home video
               market. While it was never regarded as much of
               a success, several of its key animators went on
               to do great things: Roger Allers directed The Lion
               King, Bill Kroyer wrote and directed FernGully, 
          and, Brad bird wrote and directed The Incredibles   
           and Ratatouille. Many talented animators worked       
             on this, and it shows.                                 
                                                                   
              For your added entertainment, we also threw in     
         a 27 min long interview Steven Lisberger did with    
         himself upon the release of the DVD, which goes       
            into explaining many of the things we've already         
             outlined above.                                       
                                                                  
                                                               
                                            
                                                 
                      -+ Who We Are +-                  
                                                                   
                                                                    
            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-          
           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment            
            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,               
          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless            
             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             
              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special
              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their
              many tools.

                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better
              days, we seek to relive those times, and share
              those memories. While our belief is that the
              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,
              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or
              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies
              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by
              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece
              just because it is dated.

                Whereas most groups rely soley on digital
              sources, there are still thousands of rare and
              out of print titles, many of which have no
              planned digital release. We've made it our
              mission to dig these out, clean them up using
              the best hardware and techniques available to
              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,
              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here
              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades
           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             
           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           
         get back.
