Will comment on quality and download speed once it's done downloading.

Thanks again!"

Took a very long time to download, though. 8 1/2 hours is too long in the world of high-speed internet.

But all in all a great upload. Thank you very much. :)"

Anyway, thanks again. My cousin has been nagging to me about finding this movie for weeks. She'd thank you too."

only problem i have is the fact that this movie is 4.37 FOR A MOVIE 1 HOUR AND 43 MINUTES AND 28 SECONDS LONG ! ! 

someone clearly clicked on the wrong button somewhere...lolol."
