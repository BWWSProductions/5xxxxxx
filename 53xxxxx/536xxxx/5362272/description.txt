"Gay Sex And The City," (which despite the title has nothing to do with menopausal New York socialites) stars Corey Clark, who decides to move back to Phoenix. With no plans and no money Corey calls on his local hookups and fuck buddies to find a place to stay. Along his horny journey he recalls some of his hottest fucks. After he fails to reconnect with his past tricks Corey ends up fondling new hot twinks... Whether its a sexy threeway with two strangers or finding deep penetration during an apartment tour Corey Clark is sure to please.

No, I'm not going to encode XviD/DivX and MP3 into AVI. :-p
AVC and AAC inside MKV are the future!
