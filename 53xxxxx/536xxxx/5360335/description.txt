While the U.S. was being swept up by disco mania in 1978, Foreigner issued another 
hard rock tour de force, DOUBLE VISION. It was unthinkable that the sextet could 
outdo its solid 1977 self-titled debut, but it somehow did. Lou Gramm and company ... 
Full Descriptionissued another set of rock radio staples and rock-steady album tracks, 
the best-known being such perennial arena rockers as "Hot Blooded" and the title track. 
But the highpoints didn't just stop there--such oft-overlooked compositions as 
"Blue Morning, Blue Day," "Lonely Children," and "I Have Waited So Long" are just as 
strong. DOUBLE VISION solidified Foreigner's standing as a '70s rock sensation. 

Foreigner promptly followed up their blockbuster debut with the equally successful Double Vision 
LP in 1978, which featured the FM mega-hits "Hot Blooded" and the driving title track. Opting 
not to mess with a good formula, the band wisely stuck to the polished hard rock sound that made 
their first record such a hit. Aside from the big singles, other highlights include the 
swaggering "Love Has Taken Its Toll" and the more restrained "Blue Morning, Blue Day." As always, 
Lou Gramm's impeccable rock vocals lead the way, supported by Mick Jones' tasteful, arena-sized 
guitar riffs. [The 2002 reissue featured remastered sound and added live versions of 
"Hot Blooded" and "Love Maker."] ~ Andy Hinds
