,Fwinks,2011-08-07T15:32Z,"Hey guys,
This torrent works but you will have to download Stuffit 8.02 from http://www.stuffit.com/mac-stuffit-download.html
No other file extractors work they will give you another zip file which is just like the original. 
Best Game Ever!
Hoped this helped!"

,Dekaritae,2012-06-10T10:35Z,"Works great on 2012 MacBook Pro, running Mountain Lion. Best to set the resolution in the User.ini file before you start the game."
,Dekaritae,2012-06-10T10:38Z,"I should mention, that you need to repackage the CXS wrapper into a CXEx wrapper for it to work in Lion or Mountain Lion."
,carlosjzz,2012-06-12T14:14Z,"Hi, How to convert in CXex CXS? I have a installed aquamarine, ebony, .... but when I turn it says Missing engine: engine CXEX...I run in Lion"
