The Darkness - One Way Ticket To Hell(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
_______________________________________________________

In the beginning was The Darkness, and The Darkness was good, 
then God said "Let there be rock!"

In 2003, English rockers The Darkness shocked the world with 
Permission to Land,a ridiculous album that sold a ridiculous 
3.5 million copies on the strength of massive power chords 
and a straight-facedSpinal Tap vibe. 

Much to the relief of the band and their fans, "One Way Ticket 
to Hell...and Back" (2005) totally rocks.
 
It has all the ingredients of a great old-school rock album: 
In-your-face head-banging arena rockers with kick-ass solos, 
a touch ofthe theatrics, and a balled or two that isn't to too 
corny. 

It's the same retro style of AC/DC meets Queen, but Roy Thomas 
Baker's production has given the songs an authentic touch of the 
theatrical operatic aspirations from which the band firststrived 
for on their debut.

Justin Hawkin's hair-raising falsetto and his brother Dan's huge 
guitar riffs are back on the sublimely-named One Way Ticket to Hell.
..And Back, their highly-anticipated second album. 

What this album demonstrates is that The Darkness have the highly 
unusual capacity to succeed simultaneously on two levels: their songs
are tremendous and they're damned funny too.

The record opens with a ponderous pan flute and keyboard melody before 
the opening chords of "One Way Ticket" kick in, accompanied byâ€”what 
else?â€”cowbell! The song is ostensibly an anti-cocaine anthem, but, in 
true form, the message gets a little mixed along the way. 

At times on One Way Ticket to Hell...And Back, shades of Journey
and Aerosmith can be heard (sometimes in the same song, as in "Is It
Just Me?"). 

That is the beauty of The Darkness you can't help but get swept up 
in the ride, and "One Way Ticket To Hell...And Back".
 
This is serious rock by a bunch of guys who have no problem NOT taking 
themselves all that seriously.
