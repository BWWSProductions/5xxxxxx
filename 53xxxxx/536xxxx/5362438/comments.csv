Its my first Bdrip so i need your help guys!
Tested on windows 7 , Xp , Vista!
Have fun!"
[V],Team_xRG,2010-02-14T15:15Z,"hmm i think size is too small for 1080p 
atleast 3.5-4gb is required 
u should encode bd in 720p for this size :) 
i mean 1280x544 (w/o black bars) 
but appreciate the effort :)"
[V],Team_xRG,2010-02-14T15:17Z,and if ur going to upload blue rays plz dont compromise the quality big fan or urs from long time :) 
[V],FXG_team,2010-02-14T15:31Z,"Thanks for the tips , 
I will try the 720p encode fore the 
next experiment!"

,oldSMfan,2010-02-15T23:16Z,"Hi FXGTeam! ... would it be possible to have a sample? I do not know how labourious that might be [pardon my ignorance] but it might prove to be easier for people to just DL the sample and provide some feedback.

THNX!

:O)"
