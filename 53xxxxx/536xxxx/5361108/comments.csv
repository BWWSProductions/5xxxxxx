,the_illuma_kid,2010-02-19T13:21Z,"Blud, you are the Dubstep torrent man!!! Maximum respect, i just wish i didnt pay for Sweet Shop before i found this... Oh well! Big tunes anyway. Only thing... Have you got a 320k copy of the full Africa riddim by Rusko & Caspa that was on your 1st collection? Its a massive tune and i can't find it anywhere, and the one you had was part of a mixtape. Safe in advance."
