The only thing is, I dont know how the hell to upload! So if anyone could enlighten me, I would be eternally grateful!

Thanks very much for all your downloads 'Raymodhome' by the way, they all seem to be tor draw!!!

Ciao! "
,baines77,2010-02-13T22:40Z,can anyone comment on the line audio before i download. Is it any good???
,krapnek,2010-02-14T10:57Z,Audio is the same crap as LINE audio always is.
,krapnek,2010-02-14T11:10Z,"Actually, I don't think the iMAGINE LiNE is LINE at all. It's really bad compared to for example the LINE for The Men Who Stare at Goats."
,krapnek,2010-02-14T11:16Z,Ignore my previous post. LINE audio in this release is same as LINE usually is.
