,gigitygigity,2010-02-18T21:43Z,"@ Jb Norman

use Dvd Decrypter or AnyDvd to rip ur Dvds onto Harddrive. both can be found on TPB.

use Handbrake to encode to x264/MKV
http://handbrake.fr/

That should get you started."
,yakoff,2010-02-19T16:27Z,"ar1990, I also wish to emulate MKVGuy with full credit for his brilliance and dedication; why think you he never replies to such questions as ""how do you do it???"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-02-19T19:28Z,"because I already have in my earlier posts, and for the new posts one of my old fans replies on my behalf in my absence also I am kinda a busy person.. also sometimes what happens people posts their questions but they hardly come to check the reply which makes me feel dizzy in answering each question..

thank you very much in downloading my files and for the wonderful comment, I will continue to post more and more while not speaking much, ha ha.."
,womenball,2010-02-21T09:51Z,please upload Up in the air
,surajitghosh37,2010-02-21T13:16Z,"when will you post again?
its been so long!"
,altemeldo,2010-02-21T16:25Z,Hi. Pls can you upload Sherlock Holmes and Book of Eli if u've got it. I know converting to MKV takes alot of time. Thanx.
[V],MKVGuy,2010-02-21T18:23Z,"surajitghosh37, yes u r right but there are not good releases in these days.. anyways Agora, Planet 51 and then Up in the Air or May be District 9.."
[V],MKVGuy,2010-02-21T18:24Z,"altemeldo, yes I will but let the DVDs come first.."
,jb_norman,2010-02-22T04:18Z,"So are you using Handbrake MKVGuy?
And if so, any special settings?"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-02-22T04:41Z,"I use StaxRip, for HandBreak use targeted file size with 2-pass, audio Vorbis/AAC 2ch at 64kbps 48KHz and leave the rest of the settings as they are..
optionally you can increase the number of Reference Frame to 8 and B-Frames to 5, this will slow down the speed of encoding but a better quality can be achieved if your file size is less than 700mb for a 1.3hr or 2hr movie.."
,urecord,2010-02-22T16:44Z,"thanks a lot! can you upload ""THE MARC PEASE EXPRIENCE""?"
,Rod321,2010-02-25T00:50Z,"Download speed okay
Visuals 8, Audio 9, Sync 10,
Converted & burnt with (ConvertX to DVD 4)
Many thanks to; MKVGuy, Seeders & Peers"
