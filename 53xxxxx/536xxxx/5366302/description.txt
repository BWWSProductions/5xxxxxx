Painting the Town
Jeremy Paxman takes his love of Victorian paintings as the starting point for an exploration into Victorian Britain. The journey begins by investigating the most dramatic event of the age: the explosion of great cities, which were feared at first, but in time grew to be loved. Jeremy explores the canals and sewers, suburbs and back streets, workhouses and magnificent buildings of the great Victorian city, while also experiencing the fun-filled chaos of Derby Day.
