[V],twentyforty,2010-02-16T09:11Z,"Heroes: Season ended. Best Answer:
It's not certain yet. Variety did an article this week about shows that may or may not get renewed. They put the chances of ""Heroes"" getting renewed at about 60%.

Some of the factors: the show ratings are down in the U.S., but it performs well overseas. It does OK in the young-adult demographic, and NBC might be unlikely to cancel a lot of shows, since Jay Leno's leaving the 10 pm slot open - so they'll need a lot of shows to fill the open timeslot.

The article predicted there would be a 12-episode ""Final season"" in the fall of 2010. But no one knows for sure yet.

From Wikipedia:
Despite the season's low ratings, executive producer Tim Kring is ""fully expecting"" a fifth season. However, while creator Tim Kring is hopeful over the show's future many media insiders aren't so confident. There has been growing speculation on some news sites that NBC will cancel the series at the conclusion of its fourth season. As of early February there has been no announcement on the future of Heroes either way.


Fringe: 2x16  	01/Apr/2010 Season 2, Episode 16"
