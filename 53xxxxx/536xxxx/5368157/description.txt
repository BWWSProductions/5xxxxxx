Notes:

Proper reason. TRiNiTY release is over cropped by at least 2 pixels on the left,
top and bottom.

They also decided to go for the 640x352 resolution. That gives an AR that is
within the 4% allowed (2,5% to be exact). But why not use 624x352 which gives
and AR error of 0%.

Here is a proper rip that is cropped the correct way. Samples and a vob file is
included in the sample folder as proof.

Thanks to the one who supplied the source.
You know who you are.
