,Llwch,2010-05-26T20:02Z,"What's so proprietary about this format? DAEMON tools mounts it without any problems, as should any other mounting tool.

This is how I found it - and how I passed it along. If you wish to change it to ISO or whatever format you like, feel free to do so.

This format works fine, though. I don't do .UIF, but BIN/CUE, ISO and MDF/MDS all work just fine through DAEMONTools."

Thanks again"
