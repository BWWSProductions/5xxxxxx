White Wolf's official (and only) software release that contained the Revised (aka "3rd edition" Vampire:The Masquerade Core Rulebook, the Storyteller's Guide to the Sabbat, the Storyteller's Guide to the Camarilla, the Storyteller's Guidebook and the Storyteller's Companion.

It also has a character generator that has a very impressive list of skills, disciplines, backgrounds and what not used in the game.

Reviews weren't all that great, unfortunately, and WW no longer supports this product (it's done as a projector file - apparently, they wanted to make it support a neat multimedia interface).

The program itself isn't THAT bad, though if you're looking for the books themselves, deadtree or PDF is the way to go. The character generator, on the other hand, works pretty well. With it, you can create Camarilla, Sabbat, Independent, Thin-blooded, Ghoul or even mortal characters.

Note that you do not have to install the program for it to work - in particular, it likely will not work on any current Macintosh computer. You have been warned.

Contained in this torrent is the CD ROM images. Mount with your favourite mounting tool or burn to CD. You can run the program directly out of the "Vampire" folder.
