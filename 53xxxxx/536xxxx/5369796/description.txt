Storyline: 
 It is the time of the Crusades during the Middle Ages - the world shaping 200-year collision between
 Europe and the East. A blacksmith named Balian has lost his family and nearly his faith. The religious
 wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid
 the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately
 uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian
 in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the
 East. Revealing himself as Balian's father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes
 him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment--between the 
 Second and Third Crusades--a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian 
 king, Baldwin IV, aided by his advisor Tiberias, and the military restraint of the legendary Muslim 
 leader Saladin. But Baldwin's days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among
 the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwin's vision of peace--a kingdom of heaven--is
 shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives
 and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath: to protect the
 helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom
 of heaven can flourish on earth. Balian takes the sword and steps into history
