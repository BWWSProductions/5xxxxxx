""@khiljee
we are living in 2010!
if you cant afford 2-3Gb per movie...go back to year 2000 and download 700Mb 1CD rips.
i am sure there are still some that are technologically challenged like you LOL!""

Funny thing is that this has a bit rate of 1800kbps which is the normal 700mb rips out there.

anyone who cares about quality downloads bd rips with rates above 4000kbps.

This is stripped to 10% of its original size and looks crap. nuff said."
,lindalovefoxx,2010-05-11T01:14Z,"Please GreatMagician or someone can help me? I am from Brazil and this version was'nt released on my country, can you guys find a portuguese-BR subtitle for the movie? Thanks in advance,"
,arian25,2010-05-18T19:23Z,This has to be your best rip so far. Well done mate. Thanks a lot.
,Pwn20wn,2010-07-04T14:25Z,Good video. Only 1 thing. Dutch isn't Deutsch. There's a difference. Dutch is from the Netherlands and Deutsch is from Germany!
,Pwn20wn,2010-07-04T14:48Z,Is there an Dutch subtitle? The one in the movie isn't Dutch. That's Deutsch......
