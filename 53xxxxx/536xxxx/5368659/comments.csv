,snuttel,2010-02-17T21:42Z,"Great upload! Thanks! Quality is very good.
Appears to be the same source as http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5336777/Avatar_2009_scr_DVDr-sailo1 though, with the same aspect ratio: 16:10, which can be a little annoying..."
,orimay,2010-02-25T07:58Z,for some reason i cant watch this movie. can anyone help me out? 
,Xyrec,2010-02-25T19:24Z,"@orimay, you need daemon tools or something that can mount image files."
,aafz02,2010-03-05T19:58Z,"Saw the Movie in 3D at the cinema, this seems to be exactly the same except in 2D, so no editing I'm aware of.

Looked at several uploaded versions, wanted a true ""DVD R"" (VOB Files) so grabbed this one. Burned to DVD with Ashampoo and it works on all my domestic DVD players. 

Fantastic upload, thanks turkey for your efforts.

Ps. I will be buying the retail release DVD when it's available. I just couldn't wait.  :0)"
