,ionic2004,2011-02-28T23:39Z,Normally I don't complain about pirated stuff but wtf is up with this? Whoever encoded these albums amped up the volume (through the encoding) horribly to the point it blares even though the device playing it (ipod in my case) is turned down. I would edit it back down but quality has probably already been lost. Thanks for sharing though.

,Hystrionics,2012-04-21T06:58Z,"Er, everyone else seems too polite to point it out, but the volume is fucked. It's twice as loud as it should be, and I had to alter it once I'd put it in iTunes. 

Other than that, excellent torrent. Thank you."

,b76aa1,2012-06-02T19:24Z,"... almost 500 MBPS of data in 1 minute and 15 seconds?

Not sure if it's my ISP, or if it's an incredibly generous seeder, but since the music checks out as real and of excellent quality... then wow.  Thanks a million to whoever and however that happened."
,b76aa1,2012-06-02T19:25Z,"I meant 500MB of data, not 500MBPS.  I downloaded at an average speed of 5.5MBPS.

Again, hats off to whoever is dedicating some love to this torrent."
,X-43bfn,2012-07-16T17:33Z,"It's missing the 2005 alternative version of Rain. |:
Thanks anyways."
