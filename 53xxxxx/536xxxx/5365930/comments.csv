,peri84,2011-08-07T23:57Z,"After i downloaded this package of games i followed all instructions, signed in the site you are talking about and uploaded the IMEI number and all the details you were asking. I am waiting for 5 days almost now and nothing happened so i decided to check why. After i tried to search on the rest options on the ""Certificate"" tab a page were popping that was asking for donation. So, thanks for the offer but i'll pass. Im just stating this for those that might think that these games were for free as i did.."
