,nicklouse10,2011-03-14T21:11Z,"Just wasted 3hrs of my life trying to install my legit copy of GLT on my win 7 machine. I've just given  up and have spashed the disk to a thousand fucking pieces. what a fucking nonsense. Starforce, you're a mob of cunts who dont deserve to be in this industry. "
,kontakos,2011-04-18T04:29Z,Works! Thank you for this great game without starforce.
,k-d-k,2011-05-04T20:51Z,@ nicklouse10: Did you try this Version on your Win 7?

,xXNnNXx,2012-01-16T01:33Z,shame that this is the version with the most seed. I needed the version with starforce to be able to instal the power and glory mod for Gtr2. IF YOU NEED GTL FOR POWER AND GLORY MOD DO NOT USE THIS TORRENT. Other than that it's perfect
,k-d-k,2012-01-31T19:10Z,"@xXNnNXx: The most User need GTL without Starforce, because the Fu**** Starforce Protection dont works correctly on Win 7, MAC and Linux!!"
,k-d-k,2012-01-31T19:11Z,@ xXNnNXx: You can buy from me the Original GT Legens DVD for 20 âŹ.
