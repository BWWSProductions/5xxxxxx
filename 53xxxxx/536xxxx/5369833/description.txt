"H.A.T.E.U." is a song performed by American R&B singer Mariah Carey, from her 12th studio album, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel (2009). The song, produced and written by Carey, The-Dream and Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, officially impacted radio in November 2009 as a US-only single. It is also the final single from the album.

The song debuted at number 76 on the U.S. Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart on October 22, 2009, over a week and a half before its official radio release. The song title is an abbreviation for "Having a Typical Emotional Upset".

The music video was shot on November 4, 2009 on Malibu Beach, in California. The video was directed by Brett Ratner who previously directed music videos for "Obsessed", "Touch My Body", and "We Belong Together". It should be noted that the video only uses the radio edit of the song, which is only 3:12.

Before its official radio release the song entered the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart at number #75 through unsolicited airplay and peaked at only #72 after the official radio release.

Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel is the twelfth studio album by American pop and R&B singer Mariah Carey. Originally scheduled for release on August 25, 2009, the project was released on September 29 through Island Records in the U.S. and November 23, 2009 with Mercury Records in the UK. The album was predominately produced and written by Carey, Christopher "Tricky" Stewart and Terius "The-Dream" Nash.

It was preceded by the U.S. top ten hit "Obsessed" and upon release the album was well-received by critics who awarded it 69/100, the highest rating of her career. However, commercially the album only managed to debut and peak at number three in the U.S. with sales of 168,000â€” a disappointment compared to her last album E=MC2 which sold over 463,000 and opened at number one.

It's second single, a cover of Foreigner's classic "I Want to Know What Love Is" reached number 60 on U.S. Hot 100 and top 30 in Europe whilst third US-only single, "H.A.T.E.U.", only reached 72 on the U.S. R&B charts. The album has also inspired a tour and follows on to Carey's upcoming thirteenth studio album, Angels Advocate.
