,dannychris,2010-03-22T12:04Z,"Professional reviews:

Rolling Stone (January 20, 2000, pp. 57?59) - 3 stars out of 5 - ""...creates the most crowded, ceiling-rattling basement rec room in rock....[in its] sheer awesomeness...the performance succeeds....the monster numbers benefit from supersizing. The effect is...one of timelessness."" 
Spin (February 2000, pp. 114?5) - 8 out of 10 - ""...makes their tempo and texture dynamics...into a topic in and off of itself, a deep evocation of bad-voodoo creeping willies culminating in 'One' and 'Enter Sandman'....Freed from ritualized superhuman extremism, it builds a soundtrack to everyday life."" 
Entertainment Weekly (December 3, 1999, p. 102) - ""Buttressed by grim strings, creaky horns, and thundering timpani, staples...creep with fearful new dimension, like an old Posada print come to life."" - Rating: B 
Q (February 2000, p. 86) - 3 stars out of 5 - ""...another just about forgivable flirtation with Spinal Tap-esque lunacy....a fine hit-heavy live LP with bolted-on bombast from the S.F. Symphony....Michael Kamen's scores swoop and soar with impressive portent throughout."" 
CMJ (December 20, 1999, p. 24) - ""...stunning....orchestral renditions of hits from the bands '90s output.""
