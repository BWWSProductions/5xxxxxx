Why spend a fortune on Windows server software when you can get more for so much less?!

The SME Server CD provides a flexible, worry-free, network server solution you won't outgrow.

SME Server v7.4 is the latest version of the award-winning e-smith Server and Gateway, the world's leading open-source server software for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Exceptionally reliable and easy to use, SME Server can be installed and configured in less than 15 minutes - yet it's powered by a secure and open Linux platform that's fully upgradeable and customizable. Simply install it on any standard PC and in minutes you'll have a robust Linux-based server capable of fully replacing those expensive Windows server licenses and providing a full range of services - including e-mail, firewall, file and print-sharing, web hosting, remote access and more.

SME Server integrates easily with Windows, Macintosh, and Unix/Linux clients, and within a Windows network environment. It's as simple to use as a server appliance, but unlike a "sealed-box" appliance the entire system is modular and extensible, so it can be tailored to the needs of individual businesses.
