[V],Kitlope,2010-02-15T12:59Z,Thank you for this but I would love a 720p version of CTV with commentary. I'm not even attempting to try to download & watch the NBC version as I don't want to have to shoot myself.

I agree with Kitiope, a 720p CTV version would be a great find. The commentary from the CTV broadcast contains more narrative and folklore. The NBC broadcast has more technical information about the presentation itself, plus a million shots of American athletes in the crowd (very patriotic indeed, but sorry I am Canadian). "

,sxeboi,2010-02-16T05:20Z,"@liquidmonkey - I just checked and there is hockey tomorrow (4:30 to 7) which is Canada vs. Norway preliminary round... Do you know any other times?

@Kitlope - I wish I had HD cable... unfortunately I don't :(. Ironic because I have an HD TV but no HD service."
,andante100,2010-02-16T05:50Z,"sxeboi, I wish this was 720p, but I think for us expats all over the world, this is just a small compensation to be made to have our quality Canadian content. (Funny though, that maybe 20 years or so ago, us Canadians used to whine about how boring OUR media was, and now we can't get enough of them. Either we're lowering our standards, or improving our presentations. Methinks the latter). Keep up the good work and thanks for your efforts my friend! :)"
,sxeboi,2010-02-16T20:35Z,@liquidmonkey - thanks for the link. A realtor is coming to my house during the one at 12pm so I can't record that one. I will be recording the one after that and maybe the one after that as well.
,jayposer2000,2010-03-03T00:47Z,Thanks for this rip. It is low quality but we appreciate the effort. Any chance you got CTV coverage of the mens Hockey final or the closing ceremonies?
