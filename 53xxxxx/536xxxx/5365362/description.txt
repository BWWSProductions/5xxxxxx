Having lost his powers in the climax to Infinite Crisis Clark Kent uses his skills as a journalist to defend Metropolis from both organized crime and Lex Luthor, newly bankrupt and disgraced due to his actions in the series 52.  Gradually, however, Superman begins to regain his powers, just in time to battle the embittered Luthor as he seeks to inflict his revenge upon Metropolis with the help of stolen Kryptonian battle technology and redesigned versions of the Toyman and the Kryptonite Man.

Written by Geoff Johns and Kurt Busiek, with art by Pete Woods and Renato Guedes.
