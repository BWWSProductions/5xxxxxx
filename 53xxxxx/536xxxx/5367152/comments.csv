,michaelrwatson,2010-02-17T02:58Z,WHY NO SAMPLE?? Is it because it would make it too easy for people to find out how fucked the audio is..? 
,michaelrwatson,2010-02-17T03:07Z,"Whoops.......well, having said that, there is a sample here:

h(o)tf(i)le(.)c(o)m/dl/28768861/5415d92/m-edger5-sample.rar.h(tm)l

I've put parens around some of the letters above since pir(a)teb(a)y likes to remove links.

Quality is DVD (R5) for video, very good cam audio. "
