Season 8, Episode 1: Bohemian Rhapsody
Original Air Dateâ€”2 November 2005
It's a month since Eric left for Africa and Hyde disappeared in Chicago; Kitty is preparing a tape to send to Eric. She confesses to sampling some of the guys' stash. Kelso now claims he didn't actually have sex with Jackie, who's just back and furious with him. Hyde returns and punches Kelso. Charlie falls from the water tower - and dies (eliminating himself from the role of replacement Eric). Jackie hears Hyde was intending to propose in Chicago, and tries to make up. He says he's not ready to get married yet - just in time for the arrival of Sam, who announces she and Hyde are already married.

Season 8, Episode 2: Somebody to Love
Original Air Dateâ€”2 November 2005
Now Steven has discovered to be married in Las Vegas, airhead Sam(antha)'s profession there, stripper, is as nightmarish to Kitty as it seems every (straight) man's dream come true to Kelso, who bumbles with handcuffs. Leo has held a weed orgy with strangers in the record shop, but Hyde can't fire him, even hires fellow youngster Randy Pearson who applies because Leo put a sign up. Randy proves too inventive to let go. Getting drunk, 'scorned' Jackie shows the whole bar both her stupid arrogance and too much anatomy. Fez also gets seduced but not really.

Original Air Dateâ€”9 November 2005
Hyde's de facto deputy, college guy Randy, convinces the gang to have a post-wedding bachelor party in the basement, which Kelso clears by reminding Kitty Red hasn't taken her to dinner for ages. Alas the plan to be 'arrested' by a stripper-cop is crossed by real officer Ron, so the civilian boys land in jail with abusive female sergeant Davis. When the Forman couple returns, Leo has brought the strippers to the living room, while the girls are bored at their hen night without boys. Kelso's attempt to spring his mates goes completely pear-shaped, for him even dramatically.

Original Air Dateâ€”16 November 2005
Kelso shocks the boys by saying the reason for his unhappiness is that he's no longer together with 'his only true love' Jackie and intends to propose to her. Jackie feels 'she has nothing else good in her life', never mind Donna's objections he'll never grow up. Next morning Michael is cured, after getting his ultimate dream job: security guard at the Playboy Mansion in Chicago, where he used to get kicked out after every visit to his daughter, thanks to security chief Vic, his kind of peeper. Alas Fez must confess he already told the girls; Fez and Hyde feel it's Kelso's last chance, she'll soon be over losing Steven and never forgive him if he leaves now, he concludes it's proposal time. Even Kitty agrees Red is romantic by booking in the sleazy motel for a repeat of their first sex, so they are late at their own party. On bended knee hearing her 'no' there makes Michael- the happiest man in the world, only saying goodbye to the basement circle leaves the whole gang sad.
