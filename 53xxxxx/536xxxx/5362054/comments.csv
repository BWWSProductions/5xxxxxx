Memory 64 MB

lets just hope the key works"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-14T16:58Z,"right this is the best tiny xp ever as it is a genuine microsoft one, and it lets you slim it down even more during the install, it runs so far nod32, utorrent, and ie8, the serial works just fine.

when you install you have to set a password then at first login you use the user name ""administrator"" and the password you created, you cant log in with the user name you make during install"
