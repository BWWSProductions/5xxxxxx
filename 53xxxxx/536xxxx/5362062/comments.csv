Well, currently the US is the only global military superpower and they haven't been shy to make use this. The results are less than stellar, though, and the worst of it is probably still ahead. On the bright side, one would hope that this will temper their actions for some time to come (akin to Vietnam)."

I think the transition away from Bush to a more personable and attractive on-camera spokesperson, and the overall upgrade in skill level of the marketers, has done a lot in terms of presenting the policies domestically in a more palatable way, and to a wider sector than is represented in the film.

Who could that be ?"

And why all this traffic that would seem to amount  to an attempt to sabotage my download ? (e.g. reporting having all these completed fragments available when the total tallies indicate that such numbers cannot be real)

I'd suggest others start logging the traffic from this IP too."
