,QueensTemplar,2010-02-16T07:07Z,"Thanks for the up!
Great quality as usual from your team!
Unfortunately, it's cut short at 1hour 23 min. right before the rose ceremony.
Is there anyway for you to check it, maybe upload it again?"
,tpb1believer,2010-02-16T12:08Z,"Ya, thanks lots for putting the ending at the beginning then running the rest of the show just to wreck it for us.

V=8
A=8"
,shnugin,2010-02-16T13:42Z,you son of a bitch! ruined it!
,bachelorfan22,2010-02-16T15:19Z,"start watching from 11mins in. end is at the beginning, careful not to spoil for yourseld"
,Neo718,2010-02-16T15:58Z,Your a true asshole tvteam... i guess its always best to read the comments before downloading.. thanks anyway bachelorfan22.. 
,gny203,2010-02-16T22:21Z,"Seriously what is the purpose, even bother to edit it. I always read the comments. This was one of the very few times that i downloaded without reading. No wonder even the info page is long probably to hide the comments for impatient user like me i guess.

!!!!!THE ROSE CEREMONY IS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO!!!!! 

!!!!! START IT FROM 00.11.23!!!!!"
,rg_505,2010-02-17T06:35Z,"Hey thanks so much for the upload.  Just wondering how to play this file on my macbook??  been trying for hours and just can't figure it out.  Do i need to convert the file to play using Quicktime or VLC??  

thanks in advance!"
,Furk,2010-02-18T02:24Z,This is what happens when you RAR video files.  Shame.
,Viridel,2010-02-20T03:56Z,RARing video files is STUPID and I WON'T seed them after I Leech them!
,tpb1believer,2010-02-23T07:25Z,"If this show has a SPOILER beginning, they did this last week too. It may be a glitch but I doubt it. I see there is a new UP from same team so maybe it isn't screwed. Just jump ahead otherwise."
,dowden,2010-03-02T09:12Z,is there any chance you can put the season finale up? thnx
,neeruam,2011-09-18T23:50Z,I started watching this. Immediately realized I missed something so I came back to the seed to read comments. Now I have a heads up and know to start it at 11:23 then go back to the start. Thanks!
