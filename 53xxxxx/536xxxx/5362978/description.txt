Please seed (share) these programs. Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks.

TreeSize Professional is a powerful and flexible harddisk space manager for Windows. Find out which folders are the largest on your drives and recover megabytes of disk space.
 
TreeSize Professional shows you the size, allocated and wasted space, the number of files, 3D bar and pie charts, the last access date, the file owner, the NTFS compression rate and much more information for several folders or drives you choose. 

It also helps you to clean up old, big and temporary files. The application has an intuitive Explorer-like user interface and it is fast and multithreaded. You can print detailed reports or export the collected Data to Excel and to an HTML, XML or ASCII file. TreeSize Pro can be started from the context menu of every folder or drive.
