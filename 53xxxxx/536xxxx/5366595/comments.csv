,FelixR91,2010-03-01T09:58Z,"Downloaded it, played it. works fine. 

Only one problem though: if I log in online (I have a serial and an GfWL account) it will update. after the update (it gets to v1.0.0.1) SecuRom will kick in.

now is my question, is there a fixed executable for this new updated version or any other way for me to play online without having to buy the game?

(for a serial, buy any GfWL-game and you can use that serial for all games you download)"

help plz"
,FelixR91,2010-03-02T15:00Z,"@Eskimo14: did you place the crack in the right directories? have you since then updated the game to 1.0.0.1? if you have updated it, you must uninstall and reinstall because the crack is useless at 1.0.0.1. if you havent, check if you put in the crack correctly or try running as administrator, that sometimes helps."
