,BigRatdogHead,2010-02-15T18:54Z,Huge thanx to all the members of the PS3 team. PS3MS and these files are so compatible. The best rips with the best playback. Just one question how can I view the subtitles in some movies? Is there any way to do this without a lot of hassle?

,Lord-Darkstorn,2010-04-16T20:36Z,The PS3 Team has wonderful taste. I've heard great things about this movie and can't wait to watch it!
,kludge420,2010-07-06T02:17Z,"Are these the original theatrical subs or the dumbed down, we think all English speakers are slow readers and don't understand humor, subtitles?

Thanks in advance either way."
,FEDORTPB33,2010-10-13T03:08Z,not to be a hater but could you make an English dub version
,btfan13,2010-10-13T20:18Z,to FEDORTPB33 - The English dubbed version SUCKED!  Don't even go there.  Stick to this version that has the actors real voices with hopefully the original theatrical subs.
