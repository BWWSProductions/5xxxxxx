,drklevl,2010-02-15T22:12Z,"thank you very much thethingy !

but 760.69 MiB is not a tiny size :)

and what's the iso burning software please ?"
,drklevl,2010-02-15T22:14Z,"I'm downloading anyway, and after i will seed :)"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-15T22:19Z,"its 610MB installed, which is tiny, but you can chose not to install the extra drivers and network support to make it smaller still, the iso software is the latest power iso and active iso."
,drklevl,2010-02-15T22:25Z,thank you !
,brwnjnkns,2010-02-16T07:17Z,"A few questions:

do i need to burn this to a cd before trying to install?

can this be used as a primary os? i want to replace my mandriva with it.

can i use it on a 4 year old laptop?

Thanks for the torrent!"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-16T16:06Z,"do i need to burn this to a cd before trying to install?

yes or use a tool to put it on a usb stick.

can this be used as a primary os? i want to replace my mandriva with it.

yes

can i use it on a 4 year old laptop?

yes"
,brwnjnkns,2010-02-17T02:15Z,another question: what do i do if during setup it says it cannot detect a hard disk???
[V],thethingy,2010-02-17T13:54Z,check the install additional drivers box 
,ks3276,2010-02-18T05:03Z,SWEET THANX!!!!!!!! :) X) WILL SEED
,Erickruz,2010-02-22T01:39Z,Great torrent thanks bro!...
,elantraGT,2010-02-23T18:30Z,"i can see the iso file listed as:
""WINDOWS FUNDAMENTALS INSTALLATION ISO (ORIGINAL).""

i see the sp3 file.  the only other file is the 'winflp' file that is winrar file?

i am confused as to what i should be doing."
,elantraGT,2010-02-23T18:39Z,i actually want to install this on hard drive.  how do i do that after i copy what i need to (from my first question above)?
[V],thethingy,2010-02-23T19:15Z,the winflp is the WINDOWS FUNDAMENTALS INSTALLATION ISO use active iso (included) to burn it to a cd at the slowest possable speed
,elantraGT,2010-02-24T01:16Z,"ok, i got that step done.  thanks

now when i boot my computer off the cd, it just goes to a dos window.....how do i get it to install the windows xp on to the harddrive on my computer?"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-24T01:58Z,"what does the dos window say?, are you sure you are booting from the cd as that sounds like you have the cd in the drive then you turn the pc on and it goes to your harddrive"
,Subbus,2010-03-03T09:21Z,Hi there. Installed this on a Fujitsu Siemens laptop and tried to connect to internet via Tele2 mobile internet modem. It did not work and it appears that it was a problem with 1394 net adapter. Any ideas on how to solve this? cheers
[V],thethingy,2010-03-03T13:24Z,did you install the networking components when you ran setup?
,Subbus,2010-03-03T20:42Z,"I must admit I don't know. I believe I did everything correct, but when asked for IP addresses, I skipped that because I didn't not know what the ip address was.
When installing, I burned the big iso file to a disk and then ran it. Afterwards I burned the update files to a disk and ran it. Everything but the internet connection seems to be working fine.

Maybe I should try installing everything once again before I do anything else? What do I do when asked for IP addresses? cheers"
[V],thethingy,2010-03-03T23:10Z,"well it could be as simple as not having thedriver installed for your network card, by default all Lan connections will work "
,Subbus,2010-03-04T14:54Z,Ok. I will try to install it again and see what happens. Thank you very much for your reply. cheers
,ChaosHellbound,2010-03-09T01:53Z,Please help how do i set up my wireless lan i have a Acer Aspire 3650 netbook
[V],thethingy,2010-03-09T01:58Z,"ChaosHellbound, download the driver from the acer website"
,trigo13,2010-03-09T10:36Z,"Once I boot from CD drive and installation begins , a dos window opens saying "" X:\setup "" and then nothing happens.
Thanks thethingy for the great torrents.         "
,ZaoThanatos,2010-03-25T07:14Z,(i dont comment often) i just want to say i think its great that thethingy actually spends the time to help troubleshoot a lot of these individuals problems himself... everything from the foolish questions to the more in depth ones... i haven't come across that often... usually its just childish banter about weather or not a torrent contains a trogan or virus... so kudos to thethingy even without mentioning that his uploads i've downloaded have been great...
,darkg,2010-04-08T09:23Z,Does shared folders work?
,Doomdude,2010-04-18T18:11Z,"Hey :)

I have an acer netbook

If I back up my drivers with acer erecovery management (aka, back them up onto a dvd-rw disc) will I be able to re-install them without the erecovery management?

Thanks in advance, and I lovee your torrents :D

Doomdude"
,Doomdude,2010-04-18T21:58Z,"Ok, ive downloaded the torrent, burned the ISO with magicISO, now when i put the disc in, which file do I run? A folder comes up that has a few files and other folders in. Thanks again for any help :)"
[V],thethingy,2010-04-18T22:17Z,winflip is the iso to burn to cd and use to install
,Ethnod,2010-04-22T00:00Z,"Ashamed to admit this but dont know that much about the Fundamentals XP OS. Is this ok to use as the Primary and only OS on a PC that is used day to day from anything from web browsing, CS4 PS work and gaming? 

Thanks :)"
[V],thethingy,2010-04-22T12:59Z,^^ it is fine to use as a main os.
,Ethnod,2010-04-22T14:23Z,Cheers mate :)
,Gen.Tokwa,2010-05-16T08:55Z,"my computer is pentium 4 with IDE. Does this works in IDE drive? by the way, what is SATA and IDE? "
,weerab1981,2010-05-24T23:31Z,"thanks m8 love this tiny pc 
great job yet again :)"
,anonguy9,2011-02-05T14:02Z,"Holy fucking shit.  This is amazing.

I had to manually extract the directx files from the cabs to get that working, but after that I have a slick little gaming OS.

I was also able to turn off a load of services and the OS booted up at under 190 MB of RAM used (with some minor tools loaded).  It settled down to about 250 after some time.  I'd bet I could cut that down if I had more RAM and disabled the paging file.

Runs Ventrilo better than XP (fixes my volume issue) and runs World of Warcraft well.

This asked me for a crapload of updates, which downloaded and installed fine.  That includes sp3.

sp3 never did get downloaded and installed and it's still offered as an option but silently does nothing.  I'll install the sp3 file that's included with this torrent.


Thank you SO much for this, thethingy, it's fantastic."
,anonguy9,2011-02-05T14:04Z,"Oh, and yes I was able to get my standard XP drivers working.  I had some odd blue screen issues and hard reboots at one point but it all worked out in the end."
,anonguy9,2011-02-07T22:47Z,I'm having some odd memory issues.  I'll manually enlarge my swap file.  It seems the automatic settings aren't effective.
,paka14,2011-03-08T18:36Z,"Does not accept the password specified during the installation!

 awesome uploads man. there is one request can you please upload windows and microsoft office 2007 in HINDI"
,Scunthorpe,2012-05-04T21:59Z,"Hi thethingy,

I wrote a comment on another upload of WinFLP, and thought maybe you could answer it for me.

How do I slipstream SATA drivers? Is this possible, or do I have to disable SATA in the BIOS?

Does your upload already contain the SATA drivers? Thanks in advance :)"
