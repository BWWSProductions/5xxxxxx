This is a DTS-CD 5.1 encoded from the Original DVD-Video of this concert.

Instructions: Just burn the files as a CD-Audio with NO TIME between tracks and NOT NORMALIZED. 

If you don't know what is a "DTS-CD" probably you don't have the player, or maybe you don't know you have it.

If you hear White Noise (not music) then you dont have the appropiate player, or you burned it wrong. remember, CD-Audio NOT NORMALIZED!

Just Look For the DTS logo in your player or in your Car.

Most of the Acuras have this.

Note: This album has NOT been released in this format, I created it using specialized software, so you won't be able to find it on any store, ever!


Thankyou
