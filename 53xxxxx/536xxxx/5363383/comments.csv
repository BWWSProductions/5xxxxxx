,rocco_sifredi,2010-02-16T02:15Z,"I got an error when starting the game :

""the ordinal 5372 could not be located in the dynamic link library xlive.dll
 I already got Micorsoft Live from other previosu games installs. Do I need another ""kit"" or o new install of Microsoft Live or what the fuck is that ?
I searched on google this error , there are others who has is so I am not the only one but no one came up with a fix."
,rocco_sifredi,2010-02-16T02:36Z,"I solved the issue.So for others who get this error you should download the lastest version of Microsoft LIVE crap, otherwise th game won't start giving that fucking error."
,eLitePunK,2010-02-16T02:48Z,"K here's my rant about bio-cock-2. first of all, good file size, managed to compress 7gigs to 2.47 gigs with nothing ripped other than retarded multiplayer and the video's downsampled. since no one is playing multiplayer anyway this is fine i love it!!!!!!!!!I sure as hell don't play any game online anyway. all my games are cracked i have like nothing retail. i piss on the people that support with buying ;) mk.

Here's the deal tho....I DON'T WANNA INSTALL SOME MOTHERFUCKING WINDOWS LIVE PIECE OF SHIT THATS STRAIGHT FROM THE POPE'S TOILET LOADED WITH VIRUSES!! FUCK THAT.

I'll wait for a workaround. Like what we could do is rip xlive.dll or something ''paste xlive.dll and avoid having to install that''...anyway ill leave it to the big boys this time ;) you know who you are. if this can't be done i guess i wont be playing it. i will download it though, untill i have a computer that i feel comforable installing the windows live on. oh yeah, and a computer with 2gigs of ram lol. my computer only has 1gig."

btw 
i removed the default desktop shortcut and created the one from the game folder then i got rid of sucurom error.rest it worked like a charm for me!!!"
,eLitePunK,2010-02-17T01:24Z,"obviously game developers, have forgotten about us loosers who still roll gurella style with athalon 64's and pentium 4's, and between 1-2 gigs of ram. because usually those boards only support 2 and in rare cases 3 gigs of ram... if half life 2 episode 3 has such steep requirements as this i will be pissed off bigtime."
,NarutoNamikaze,2010-02-17T06:36Z,"@ venom_er

How did you get rid of the securom error?
I didn't even have a desktop shortcut after the installation completed.

,WTFX,2010-02-22T09:54Z,[REQ] AvP :P
,eLitePunK,2010-02-22T16:49Z,"ok im playing the game below minimum specs by far but it actually runs good, and is *playable*..
Athlon 64 3400, 1GB ddr400 ram, Radeon HD3850 512ram vid card...the actual gameplay is rather fast on all specs on low. the game is only using 497mb of ram actually. im running windows xp 32bit.
the only part where it is very slow is when im using the vending machine, get those powerup things, or push esc to pause the game, anyone else get that or is it just my computer?"
,WTFX,2010-02-22T21:49Z,"Ok Torbax, since u contacted me ( :D ), are u sure u followed these instructions i posted earlier?
u gotta press 'home' when ur in the menu if the gfwl doesn't open itself and choose don't participate etc.
when u reach ""Create New Profile"", click it. after that, scroll down and u'll see a link to create local profile. that's where u wanna click. rest is self-explanatory. those fckers at M$ try to hide that option. only posting this i've seen ppl around who can't figure out saving. "
,WTFX,2010-02-22T21:54Z,"so on additional note, u won't be asked for a key unless u're trying to create an online live acc. so that's where teh fail is on ur part."
,eLitePunK,2010-02-22T23:09Z,"Hi guys,

I has discovered a solution to my own problem! It has to do with the .bik movies playing very very slow sometimes minutes...just disable the problematic .bik movies by renaming them to .txt for example rename waterfall.bik to waterfall.txt that disables the background video so you can now access the menu, without extreme lag making the pause menu like ''quit to windows'' exessible.
So now it plays flawlessly on a computer with 1 gig of ram and a 3850 AGP video card lol!!

edit; even computers with 3gigs of ram are reporting this problem. usually people with with windows xp professional 32bit. like me..basicly you have to rename all the plasmid videos, the vending machine vid and a couple more."

,WTFX,2010-02-23T18:00Z,"s3m1n00b, idk what do u mean by lame gfx. The gfx are not any better than Bioshock 1, if that's what you mean. if u actually have some problem like gfx corruption, pls post a pic or something.

maybe u might be interested in trying to run the game in DX9; create a shortcut to the launcher exe and add -dx9 command right after existing text in the target line. (it's only ""-dx9"" [w/o the """"])"
,s3m1n00b,2010-02-23T20:14Z,yes..well since i h winxp..i dnt hv a choice cept dx9...ba will post a pic...the gfx nd textures luk lik medium or low settings...
,WTFX,2010-02-23T22:32Z,"well since u haven't posted a pic, here's a link to something u might wanna try out: http://forums.2kgames.com/forums/showthread.php?t=60554

altho i'm not sure if ur prob is the same as described here. BS2 has run fine for me till now on both my main rig & lappie on maxed settings. but it's not as finely done like first bioshock. they did a bit lazy job. the only thing bugging me is the awful FOV of 75, which can be changed thru mapping a command to a key, much like w/ borderlands but they say it goes off again with cutscenes and zooming so it's gonna be pain in the ass. the two patches they rolled out did nothing for 16:9 altho fixed something for other ARs. but i haven't applied them tho, they're thru gfwl methinks and might crap up with the rip."

Please help keen to try this game out."

,eLitePunK,2010-02-25T19:35Z,"doombubble, you UNFORTUNATELY HAVTE TO install ''games for windows live'' for it to even start!1! but this is no where as bad as what ubisoft is doing with assasins creed 2! but don't worry so much about this one as gfwl is all clean contains no spyware, but it is to integrated into the actual game to hack/crack it, so it would require major re-coding of the whole game. not worth it when its perfectly playable anyway now, and unlink ubisoft's recent decision you DON'T HAVE TO BE ON THE INTERNET TO PLAY.

This is the world now, a world completely and utterly controlled by big business, DRM crippled games, and more..

btw on a side note, this game works flawlessly on medium settings [haven't tried high yet probably would work just as well cuz low-med settings make absolutely zero change in performance it seems like] with a get this lol, an Athlon64 3400+ socket 754, 1GB DDR-400mhz ram, and an ATi Sapphire HD3850 AGP video card. LOL!! 

SO SCREW THE MINIMUM REQUIREMTS OF 3800+, 2GB ram. I prove you can run it fine on 1gig!! the only thing i had to do [and this is not a performance related issue] is disable all the plasmid and tonic and vending machine and map vids because there is a bug, and this is happening to mostly users of Xp regardless of system specs...

-PEACE OUT AND HAVE PHUN GUYS!"

        You should try to reinstall again and do turn off any other application like antivirus etc and let it run only you should free as much ram as possible , you will get around 5.58 gb data.

Thanks kaos great stuff."
,akhellbinder,2010-03-13T03:33Z,"Fast download, fast rebuild and fast install. Very nice torrent.

Other than that, the game seems to work fine. However theres no sound in the menu, dont know if thats an error, there is sound ingame (Atleast for the first 15 minutes of the game).

You cant save the game without making a Windows Live account. Its some dumb system they apparantly use for Xbox Live aswell or something. Takes like 5 minutes to make, and you need to sign into it, ingame by pressing the icon saying LIVE in the bottom right corner in the menu, and this is where i am stuck. What do i do about a serial code? Im assuming keygens wont work, since its activated online.

I havent seen other people have problems with serial keys. What do i do?

Thanks."
