Welcome to Tag Team Tuesday. This is round 2 of 4 of the January match-up between The Ninjas and the Dragons. This is the CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH of THE YEAR!.

The Ninjas go into to Round 2 with a 41pt lead and come out of the round 16pts behind! How did the Dragons mount the comeback? Who rose up to the occasion on the Dragons and took control of this match? This match up is just heating up as the Dragons take the lead going into the final wrestling round!
