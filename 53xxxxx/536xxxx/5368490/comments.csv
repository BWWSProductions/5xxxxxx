You're an idiot, downloading a fake movie is not illegal. I'm taking business courses in college, and even downloading a real illegal movie is very difficult and more costly to enforce than to do nothing at all. Especially since these torrents are hosted internationally, and most likely the person downloading them is from another country/state anyways. The amount of money is costs to moniter, find and track the IP, then find the country, then state/province, then region, then find the ISP, then find the household, then find the person, then charge them, costs way too much than it is worth.

Out of the hundreds of millions of people who illegally download, how many of those people get charged? Next to none, and the people usually getting charged are the ones who heavily download, upload and host, and these people are usually anonymous regardless."
