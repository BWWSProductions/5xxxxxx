,l3izyxynta,2011-01-14T01:20Z,I would like to see the log and cue @ 100%. Please help deliver that. You obviously have a legitimate copy of the album so it shouldn't be too hard to pull off.

This comes from a cassette, I don't think a 100% cue is going to make much difference. Clearly you have downloaded it - what's it like?

Thanks for the up man.

The music is by BoC, but this is not Closes, nothing here is. You can download and check for yourself, here are the actual track titles:

1 Powerline Misfortune (from Old Tunes Vol. 2)
2 She is P (from Old Tunes Vol. 1)
3 Mukhinabaht (from Old Tunes Vol. 2)
4 Track 04A (from 35 Random Tracks)
5 Track 06A (from 35 Random Tracks)

Yes, I missed a couple, but you get the point. These are good songs, just the description and filenames is BS. On the good side, the quality is very good."
