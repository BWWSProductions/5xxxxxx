              An american documentary from 2005. Episode 2 of 2.
              It's a beautiful october day and a crew of five venture out
              on a boat and sets on travelling from Main to Florida.
              Halfway on their adventure the weather turns bad, and in
              the end only two survives. Survivalexpert Brian Horner
              takes us through their events and the decisions that sealed
              the crews fate.
