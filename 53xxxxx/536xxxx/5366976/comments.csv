,MythS2S,2010-02-16T23:05Z,Jersson I was looking and all I can get is 4.27 and make it portable if you would like.  If you can get 5.15 or a tad lower then give me the link and Ill make it portable for you.
,jersson,2010-02-16T23:21Z,"I've tried a lot of 4.27 versions on PB and all I get is error. The 4.25 vers I'm using is working fine and although they seem to be cracked the same way, how can that be ? Is it the 4.27 crack that doesnt work properly. Il be glad for any vers above 4.25,4.27, 5.05, 5.10 or 5.15. Thank's very much"
,jersson,2010-02-16T23:26Z,"I think that was ""fatal error 505"" I got from vers 4.27."
,MythS2S,2010-02-18T01:44Z,"Well what I did was got the 5.15 setup
Made it portable
