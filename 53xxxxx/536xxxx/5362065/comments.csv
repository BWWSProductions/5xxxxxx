I hope it works!"
,gravemind567,2011-02-16T09:52Z,"I downloaded this, i managed to set it up fine. The game starts but crashes as soon as it tries to load any page past the main menu. Any idea what the cause might be and how to fix it?"
,KlasKlettermus,2011-06-20T13:58Z,Thanks for the upload! Loved the anime series so this will be interesting. :)
,KlasKlettermus,2011-06-23T14:15Z,"Is it only for me that the config pages and the menus are in Japanese? Doesn't really matter tho, since it isn't that hard to find. But all dialogues in-game are in English, so it's great. :)"

Thanks!!"
,schroed4,2011-10-21T06:21Z,"gravemind567; No idea how to fix your  problem. You could try the other Clannad torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5417934/CLANNAD_Full_Voice_(English_Version_)_[Visual_Novel]


Also, the translation project has had some more progress! Here is a link to the new patches for it.

I haven't tried to use them, so good luck if you do try to use them."
,MasterXionic,2011-11-01T14:44Z,I'm having the same problem as Grave. I set it up fine but once I click anything past the main menu it freezes up. Some urgent help needed on this.
,DavethNightblade,2012-01-06T04:53Z,stupid question but I was wondering if the voices were translated to english as well
,DavethNightblade,2012-01-22T07:17Z,Ok so I got through all of the instructions but the part where it says to overwrite the gameexe.ini and seen.txt files. When I try to copy the files on to the mounted CLANNAD.cdi my computer says that there is no free space. Can someone tell me how to overwrite the files?
,schroed4,2012-04-09T17:00Z,"The voices are in Japanese.
That sounds like a weird error.... Is your hard drive full or something?
You could try deleting the files that your supposed to overwrite (gameexe.ini and seen.txt), and then placing the correct files in there."
,0300304,2012-06-26T19:04Z,"My computer is nowhere near full of disc space, and when I try to put or remove files in the mounted Clannad disc, It says; ""there is not enough space on the Clannad disc."" So, I tried to delete the old seen.txt and gameexe files. Still didn't work, for some reason it wouldn't let me modify it. So, then I decided to just try and play the installed game in Japanese. Past any button I decided to click, the Bar at the bottom would show up, but nothing else. No text, no nothing. I had to keep force closing the game to do all this. Please help! I've been trying to get this for the past year or so."
