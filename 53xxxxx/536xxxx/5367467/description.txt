One late octoberday in the late 90â€™s three guys started to make some hard EBM sequenced on a single Sequential Circuits Pro-One and a Roland TR-505.
Nothing was caught on tape. The band was put on ice. Many years later in the beginning of 2009 two of the guys were thinking of staring a new project. They decided to do something new and exiting.
It became a fusion of Death Metal and hardhitting Old-School EBM. The band is now more technical than before and more evil than ever.
The result i the first miniCD â€œpremature autopsyâ€. All recorded and mixed six feet under.
