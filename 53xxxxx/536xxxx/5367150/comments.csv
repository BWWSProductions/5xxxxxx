,scottsasse,2010-06-28T23:57Z,Many THANKS to you & all the seeders!!!! I have been searching high & low for this and all I could find was a poor quality VHS copy. This was my sisters favorite movie. She died unexpectedly in 2003. We will be watching this in her honor at a family and friends get-together. Will Seed!!!
,theinigo,2010-10-31T06:49Z,I adored this movie back then and found it later on VHS when I was in high school.  I don't know where the copy is now.  Thank you so much for putting it up!!
