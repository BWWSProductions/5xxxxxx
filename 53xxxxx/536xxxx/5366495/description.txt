Music : Metal : Lossless
Here is the original, rare pre-Elektra Records version of Motley Crue's debut, Too Fast For Love. This is the vastly-superior Leathur Records version. This features completely different mixes of the songs, as well as an extra song which was cut, a different track order, and songs with completely different intros and endings. This is an excellent 2nd pressing vinyl rip to CD. Artwork included.
