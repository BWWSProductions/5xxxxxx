,macune88,2011-08-08T21:33Z,I have tried like three different torrents on Windows 7. They all launch but the color is screwed up anyone know what to do? 
,dothackjhe,2011-08-21T03:05Z,"To those having trouble with the colors in-game, it could be that your video card's driver needs updating or your system can't handle the game at all. It's best to have your computer's driver be up-to-date most of the time. "
,dothackjhe,2011-08-21T06:09Z,Tried the game on Windows 7 x64 but found the game not working. I've tried different cracks for the game but still to no avail.

,skulldragon,2012-06-25T02:54Z,"So funny to look at those poor people, who can't understand, that those old games, were built at age, when nobody even heard or could even imagine, that Mircosoft could release so shit OSs.

Works fine on WinXP SP3, including autorun. You have to obtain the no-cd from GCW tho.

Every problem you have, is because of Vista or later WinOS.
Mircosoft stated clearly that since Vista, they brutally dropped support for old applications."
