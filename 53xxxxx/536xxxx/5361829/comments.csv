,whufc7268,2010-02-14T20:00Z,Rubbish American attempt at H.potter. As usual the Yanks take a Brit Flick try to copy it but end up with a piece of crap. Same as they tried to do with The Office & Ashes to Ashes.
,whufc7268,2010-02-14T21:09Z,watchfullmovie good your getting cut off you prick spamming twat.

Where can i find the English subtitle for this one?? "
,skull-shaker,2010-02-15T05:59Z,well said jingoo
,iamhelix,2010-02-15T07:56Z,"bunch of posers, why write comments that have nothing to do with the torrent, you guys are fu@king retarded.

i watched this last night, audio is very bad and video is not mucvh better. if you really like this kind of movie i would wait for a better copy.

Personally i think its no where near as good as any of the harry potter films.

- ALMOST WATCHABLE QUALITY -
A:3
V:4
(Compared to a perfect DVD rip)

like i said if this was a good movie i would have waited to see it in better quality."
,numse,2010-02-15T08:00Z,this is a cam
,ronsmythe,2010-02-15T10:47Z,"okay, so it's rar files, and the quality is not dvd, 'cos it ain't been released on disc yet, but stop all the whining, you get what you pay for. :-))"
,xxmrmarksmanxx,2010-02-15T11:52Z,"Definately not fake!! Dont listen to akka2001hk he is a fool... BUT!!!
The quality is very poor.... am waiting for better copy.

A6/V5 and Im being generous... terrible cam quality leave it"
,godswallops,2010-02-15T12:52Z,"I'd like to amend my earlier comment.

The quality is better than originally thought from the opening scenes.

For a CAM it's not bad - V:5 A:5, watchable.

Best quality avalible at the moment but not good enough for me... Barely watchable... Nice try though!"
,Stephenz,2010-02-15T22:41Z,"people who expect dvd or such quality when the movie is just out in cinemas,prety much show themselfs as instant morons..

thanks for this upload, im not downloading because ive got patience enough to wait..

i dont expect much of this movie, i think its gonna sukc ass...

boondock saints2 is so much better then any of this crap..and it doesnt need attention to get viewers..

another movie that doesnt get the attention it actually deserves is Cirque du Freak The Vampires Assistant, if the sequals are better then the first its gonna be a nice set of movies to watch...

they project this movie to be good, but i seriously doubt it comes close to a good movie...


have fun ""haters"" with ur hating and being lame, ur bringing down the scene each time u bitsj and moan about stuff u can't accomplish....

the rest of us will appreciate the uploaders for the hard work and effort that enables us to safe our money, and raise tha finger to big brother..

another thanks uploader, very nice job!"
,rodneymc2,2010-02-16T00:51Z,Not watchable for me. I have to wait for a better copy.

,CHULITIA,2010-02-19T11:22Z,I downloaded it from bitlord and when it finished i tried to open it up with my vlc player and it had all these files and wouldnt let me open it? I dont want to say its a fake but it didnt work for me. Any suggestions?
,ownage9999,2010-02-19T14:36Z,Can you fuckers stop advertising for your shitty scam movie websites? It's getting fucking old.
,terminator061,2010-02-22T16:50Z,is it watchable ???
,Nenjet,2010-02-23T21:10Z,"Personally, I prefer DVDrips, on account of quality. However, this wasn't too bad. There were several counts of laughter, but they did not take away from the movie particularly. The video could have been improved, especially during the ""dark/night"" scenes where you couldn't really make out what was happening. However, for a cam, it was fairly good."
,potanes,2010-03-23T03:58Z,wait for better copy!
,dboyd,2010-04-11T15:21Z,Thankx mate.
