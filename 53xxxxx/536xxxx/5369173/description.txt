Acropolis Now is a BBC Radio sitcom set in Ancient Greece, written by the author of Eats, Shoots & Leaves, Lynne Truss. 
It was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in two series in 2000 and 2002, with subsequent reruns on BBC 7 in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.

Acropolis Now follows the fictional adventures of historical Greek characters in Athens, Heraclitus, Aristophanes, Socrates, Xanthippe, and the Oracle.
It's loosely narrated by a chorus, in the convention of Greek dramas.

Aristophanes and his brother, Heraclitus, run a fish restaurant. Oracle, their mother, is a former keeper of the Oracle at Delphi. 
She constantly "sees signs", most of which turn out to be commonplace 20th century traffic signs and posters.

Xanthippe is a pervert, that is a heterosexual, in a society where homosexuality is normal. She has a crush on Socrates' friend Plato, who cannot handle her advances.
