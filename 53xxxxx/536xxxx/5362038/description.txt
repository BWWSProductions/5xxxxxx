Uzak Ihtimal (Wrong Rosary) is an accomplished debut for director Mahmut Fazil Coskun. It tells a simple story of Musa, a young Muslim muezzin (prayer caller) in a mosque falling in love with his neighbor Clara, a Christian girl doing voluntary work in a church. Musa's natural shyness, coupled with the invisible barriers due to their different religions, prevent Musa from expressing his true feelings to Clara.This simple story is delicately handled by Coskun and the script has enough twists and turns to keep the viewers attention throughout the film. Performances are fine and the camera work is another plus. Overall an assured and promising directional debut. (review by corrosion-2 IMDb)
