,Mr.Radar,2010-02-15T00:23Z,"Here's an updated version of the subtitle file: http://www.filedropper.com/metropolis-restoredversion-arte-12-2-2010_1

I fixed one of the subtitles (the caption from Freder's book, ""The Book of Revelations"") not showing up due to a typo in the timecode and tweaked a few other timecodes.  I also fixed several typos in the text."

,rotwang,2010-05-05T20:09Z,"FAN-FRIGGIN-TASTIC!!!  The only film that's been possibly more influential than Citizen Kane on modern cinema.

Just one question, how do I attach the Eng subtitle file to the .avi?

The NY Times story today is probably going to lead to a lot more hits now."
,Malta_Soron,2010-06-15T08:41Z,@Mr. Radar: Filedropper doesn't work anymore (at least not for me). Could you upload the subs elsewhere?
,Malta_Soron,2010-06-15T16:56Z,"Never mind, I got them."
,suprbay1,2010-10-16T00:08Z,"Beautiful quality! Thanks Vic. Just a tyro question: how do I apply the English subtitle  .srt,  which is offered by Radar?"
,nehoc,2010-11-03T22:45Z,"Excellent quality and nice live music, plus working and truthfull subtitles, thank you very much! Now I have to get thru the two additional Arte documentaries without subs:)"
,davydoo,2010-11-25T01:33Z,"Thanks for this torrent, but how do I get the English subtitles?  I downloaded the file from FileDropper, but don't know what to do with it.  Can someone help me please?
