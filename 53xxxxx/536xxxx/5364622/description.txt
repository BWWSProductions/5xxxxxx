In 1958, in utter secrecy, the black hull of the world's
first nuclear submarine, USS Nautilus, voyaged beneath the
ice of the North Pole and entered into legend.

'Nautilus 90  degrees North' flashed the telegram, informing
the world of the boat's historic undersea crossing - a message
that would sink home both in Washington and Moscow - hinting
at American  technical genius and the tilting of strategic power.

That voyage was captured on disc and long forgotten. Now Charles
Wheeler, speaking with the Nautilus captain and crew, reveals a
hidden history of adventure and political intrigue at the limits
of human knowledge.
