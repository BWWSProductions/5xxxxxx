Description:Dane Cook: The Lost Pilots
Before hitting it big, comedian Dane Cook toiled in the cutthroat world of failed TV pilots. First, "Humor Me" (2004) found Cook as a failed stand-up who clashes with his sister-in-law when he's forced to move in to his brother's home. Justine Bateman, Pat Finn and Tony Cox co-starred. And, Cook would have starred as a slacker who was always getting his friends into wacky predicaments, in "Cooked" (2005). With Liz Vassey, Kristina Anapau.
