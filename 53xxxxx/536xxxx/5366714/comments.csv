,13ip0lar,2010-03-01T16:16Z,"Should be going well. I read about 300+ seeders global which is like what at least 30 tops & 800 leeches. I'm always seeding to, when I can that is....89.2GBs and 20:1 ratio atm :D"

,13ip0lar,2010-06-18T09:26Z,Very Welcome...
,casmith0,2010-08-02T20:31Z,"Having trouble with this torrent- I have episodes 1-3 downloaded 100% and they play just fine in Windows Media Player, but when I try to play them on my xbox 360, the video craps out after about 2 mins. Audio continues, but they playing time shows 00:00 when the video stops. Any idea what's wrong?"
,subx,2010-08-30T04:35Z,"thanks 13ip0lar...but you forgot to name episodes 11 and 12 alphabetically.

I accidentally watched 11 & 12 before S02E01 since they show up alpha-numerically first and second, then episode 01 is third in the list.

A lot of people add the entire season to a media player play list, and media players aren't smart enough to know which should be played first...they simply obey the naming convention and play them alphabetically (and numerically).

It's too late to correct it, but it sort of spoiled the ending.

Apart from that small problem, they're high-quality TV rips. Good job."
,KanakXT,2010-11-09T05:28Z,"torrent is great, thx for uploading them all in one place

like subx said the files are listed alphabetically but anyone w/ half a brain can count 1 to 13 correctly in order, don't blame a program for a human mistake/laziness, lol

torrent is good, use vlc to watch the files no problems there

V-8  (tv rips so has station on corners and slightly choppy transitions from cutting out commercials, nothing too serious though)
A-10"
,keepeas,2010-12-07T21:55Z,"Episode 1 and 2 are corrupt.
They freeze a couple minutes into watching....
Everything else is good as far as I can tell."
,benenya,2011-01-05T22:02Z,"@keepeas & casmith0 ---- I wouldn't try to play anything on a shitbox (Xbox). I stream my videos from my laptop to my PS3. Occasionally it will say ""data Corrupted"". When that happens I connect an HDMI cable between my laptop and 42 inch tv extending the monitor. Then I use VLC player and it does just fine. It is almost even better quality that way then using any media device....  "
,fossil44,2011-03-10T07:03Z,THANKS FOR THE UP GREAT QUALITY A/V NO PROBLEMS WITH THE SERIES KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK 
,13ip0lar,2011-09-06T14:10Z,"Nice to see this torrent is still going. @keepeas All the files work. Anyone that has issues with file should always try it with VLC, and then possibly a secondary player. If both fail to make the file work then you can be sure it's corrupt. These aren't... I watched them all. -_- "
,keepeas,2011-09-07T08:04Z,"@13ip0lar
yeah you're right it was just the player...
Woah woah woah...did I decide to check up on this the EXACT day that you responded?!?
That's freaking insane"
,Xeginy,2011-09-08T18:27Z,"@13ip0lar; you're right. I was having issues with episodes 1 and 2, but I downloaded and then tried playing them in VLC, and they worked fine. Thanks for the tip!"
,13ip0lar,2012-01-25T02:06Z,Very welcome! Who knew the scientific method would apply to real life?! :O
,sonny1960,2012-07-04T22:46Z,thanks
