I have had trouble with hazar's loader, Im using the Nvidia edition win 7, and for some reason, hazzar's loader will not work. Have used it before, but not with this custom os. Any ideas?? The loader i usually use freezes with the Nvidia edition 7, hope this one works. Thanx again!!!!

What happened to Daz? Does it get zapped by the impending MS-KB? Will this one?"

,kpadmiral,2010-02-23T14:10Z,"Okay, not sure why people start off their nfos with ""This is not a virus"", etc.  That's like saying it's suspicious.  To give the benefit of the doubt, I couldn't get this working on 3 different mobo's An ASrock, BioStar and a Asus board.  I thought maybe since each and every install error'd on the Activate SLIC present step, that perhaps the SLIC manager didn't load right.  So I tried the windows dev activator and it worked straight up.  Since the key for the dev activator is black listed when net connected I wanted a full activator.  So I came back and tried this one again.  Loe and behold it didn't work again... since I ran this program AFTER each of the 3 fresh clean installs, I suspect strange play.  All 3 installs were 64-bit, yet there was a process that ran from the TEMP directory that was named explorer.exe that was 32-bit that took up 78-100% cpu cycles.  Yeah, so what's up with that?  Thought this didn't have a virus in it...hmmm. Clarification if anyone has any."

,Hrock,2010-03-01T06:16Z,"Hello everyone, I have been using all types of pirated software for a very long time now, i have had my fair share of dealing with viruses and activators and the way they work, to make a long story short, please take my word THIS IS A VIRUS.

yes i know it works perfectly, it really does remove the windows activation crap, but guess what? hazr original release does the same exact thing and it is only 440KB!!! this is 9,840KB. so where does the other 8.4MB go when you install this crack? please someone who knows their way around computers look in your appdata/roaming and appdata/temp folders look for files named server.exe sysdiag64.exe explorer.exe and 1-wx0(variable).exe if you have not installed this these files wont be there. now intall this and look again...  the 4 suspicius file that were installed on my computer should be on yours too. 

now... why am i so certain this is a virus and not part if the activator? 

1.) Server.exe tries to transmit data to a oversea IP (blocked by my FW)

2.) 1-wx0IdI.exe tries to run itself with administrative privilages at every start up.

3.) explorer.exe also tries to contact a remote IP

4.) sysdiag64.exe, explorer.exe, and server add itself to automatic startup. (check: msconfig > startup)

5.) after infected files are deleted the activator still works fine.

6.) this list can go on forever, just listen to me and press the back button on your browser."

,phyre222,2010-04-05T05:48Z,"Hrock is right about this being a virus,
I didnt download it cuz i new better ive been dealin with pirated software for a long time..

Rule of thumb, Generally when someone starts out by saying TURN OFF YOUR ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE, THIS IS NOT A VIRUS...99% of the time it is just that  a Virus.  It's Unfortunate that people do this kind of thing but you gotta ask yourself is it at all possible?... Is it possible that this is a virus that is setup to change your advanced settings of your anti-virus software to make an exception for specific virus files that are now setup to believe that your computer is now running a server that is meant for sending your private information to wherever the virus writer wants..
Well the answer is yes this is very possible and this download is that virus.
So since there is doubt in whether or not this is a virus y take the chance.

I have these 3 win 7 loaders,
The original ones
an when you add the sizes of all 3 of them together its around 11MB
SO 
Hrock was right
do the math.. whats with all the extra data for 1 win 7 loader.

an if you need one of them contact me and i will gladly email it or find some way to get this virus free win 7 activator to you 

Windows 7 Loader 1.6.9 by Daz7
Loader by Hazar 1.67
Loader by Hazar 1.5 (Old one, but still works)

These are the names of the 3 legit loaders"

,Xemeriba,2010-04-13T06:29Z,"Okay Hrock.

Two things...
One. You are a complete and total idiot if you think this program is a virus. I used this the second I DLed W7 and haven't had a problem since. Oh, and that was on March 4th.

Two. What fucking AV software are you using that detected that shit??? I'm using Norton (Which we all know has some problems) But it has one of the GREATEST virus definitions out there and it didn't detect ANYTHING you mentioned. I think you're just some fucked up little child who wants to bash on any torrent that has more seeds than his.

P.S. Go fuck YOURSELF Hrock...... Blaze is a good person (as far as I can tell). His instructions are easy to follow and work like a charm.

P.S.S This torrent worked 100% for me and I recommend it to all people who pirated Windows 7 and need an activator.

Also, I have noticed that this doesn't make windows a genuine copy. So there's really no point in downloading it unless you just want to disable any popups.

-Cheers"
,Omnipharious,2010-06-08T08:42Z,"I seriously cannot thank you enough. You made it very simple, and easy to use. My laptop is coming up on 7 years old, and it has been having many problems with XP lately, and, for some reason, Linux systems don't seem to work well on it, and admittedly, I just got a RAM upgrade, and wanted to see what was so great about Windows 7. Windows 7 is amazing, it utilizes the resources of your computer perfectly well; I'm getting an average of 5 more frames in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. CoP now that I'm on Windows 7.

Just one question, what do I do if I get updates from this point on? Do I let them install? Will I have to do this whole thing over again?

To any of you out there who can't get it to work: it is very easy to use if you follow the instructions to the ""T"", guys. It's not a virus; if your anti-virus says it is, it's a false-positive.
"
,youda75,2010-06-08T13:31Z,"Works great for me... thx. I've been using another activator this last 6 months but after the windows 7 updtate of the 7th june... not anymore.
I applied this one, and no problems... just follow the instructions!!!
:)"
,Bartvo,2010-06-09T06:30Z,"Yesterday, my brother downloaded this, used it, and said to me it didn't work, but the noob just didn't follow the instructions good enough. I did exactly as stated in the instructions, and now my Windows is successfully activated.

Btw, if you still get the message that your computer is not genuine after using the reboot, then run the RemoveWAT.exe and choose Remove WAT. It can take a while, so wait patiently. When it's done, reboot again and your computer should reboot without troubles.

Make sure to set your Windows Update to automatically check for updates, but let you choose whether to download and install them or not.

Any virus reports for this torrent's contents IS a false positive, no doubt."
,Trollsauen,2010-06-10T00:33Z,So this works if I get the message that my W7 ain't genuine?

At the same time it was revealed the Win7 SP1 is going to be released, it seems that they updated Win7 and no activators work anymore.

Notice to anyone restarting their computer in the near future with an internet connection - restart at your own risk. You will now notice at the bottom right of your computer it will say that your copy of win7 is no longer genuine.

Sorry guise. Going to have to wait for a new activator."
,onealns,2010-06-16T04:16Z,"Just tried to reactivate my windows using this activator. After completing all of the instructions and restarting I got a message from windows stating that my copy of windows is not genuine.

what should i do?"
,ItsPrisonYo,2010-06-28T23:54Z,"@valck

Do the following: Go to Control Panel -> Programs and Features -> at the right side View installed updates. Here search for a windows update, named: Update for Windows 7 (KB971033), right click and uninstall. Next go to start menu, in the search box enter: Command Prompt, it has a black DOS window icon, right click on it and Run as administrator. Here enter the following: slmgr /rearm . Then you have to restart your computer. When it restarts it will prompt you to activate windows, hit Activate now, and your copy of Windows should be activated."
,ItsPrisonYo,2010-06-28T23:57Z,"@ valck

To avoid further ""Genuine"" wallpaper, go to windows updates (just go to start menu, and in the search box enter Windows update) check for updates. It will notify you that you have one important update, it will be the one you've previously uninstalled: KB917033, right click on it, and Hide update."

,alucard179,2010-12-03T14:37Z,"i haven't read all comments. if u install this and your OS says u r not using a genuine windows is because you maybe have a update called ""Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB971033)"" this is description

go to control panel -> programs and features . on programs and features at your left side is something called ""View Installed Updates"" look for the update and uninstall it. then go to windows update and mark the update and rick click it and press ""hide update"" then restart pc if its not genuine still then re-activate it and should be working."

,gyaradon,2011-03-12T22:28Z,"This worked. Only problem was that between 7Loader and RemoveWAT, I got a ""bootmgr is compressed"" error and had to run fixboot from the system disc. But I got rid of the horrible Black Screen. But here's a good question: How can I be proactive and make sure I don't get it again?"
[V],blaze69,2011-03-22T03:48Z,"@ gyaradon

The Reason Why u are getting that Is Because U have Ur Main Hard Drive Set To ""Compress this Drive To Save Disk Space""

Right Click Your Hard Drive, Click Properties. And Uncheck The Box Where It Says ""Compress This Drive To Save Disc Space""
