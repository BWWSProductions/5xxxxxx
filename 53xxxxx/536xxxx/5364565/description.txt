Album Description
What sticks out about this 12-track effort is that the music is intended to be powerful but subtle most of the time, and not a score that drowns out any of the film's critical scenes. The score was a cooperative composition job between Buck Sanders and music great Marco Beltrami (Hellboy, The Omen, Terminator 3). The duo worked together on a variety of films in the past, and their chemistry shows in their musical work for this movie.

Beltrami was obviously going for a modern day Cowboy flick feel when composing some of the music, to reflect the dangerous backdrop of the film (no surprise considering his past work with Sanders including 3:10 to Yuma). Most of the score is dark and foreboding, with unconventional instrumentation that create a sense of tension. Don't expect an orchestral performance like in Glory; the duo keep instruments to a minimum, but with maximum effect.

The film itself has very little music weaved in (about 30 minutes), and some of the songs from the film won't be found on the CD. A good example of this is "Khyber Pass" by Ministry, a full-throttle metal track that matches the adrenaline-pumping action of the film. As an added head's up, there were also two other Ministry songs, Fear and Palestina, that you won't find on this CD.

The album is only a half-hour long, but this fairly dark work more than delivers if you're a fan of movie scores.
