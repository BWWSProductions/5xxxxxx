Charles Mingus
The Great Concert of Charles Mingus [Live]
Two Discs 
2004
FLAC

Because of his brilliant writing for mid-size ensemblesâ€”and his catering to and emphasizing the strengths of the musicians in his groupsâ€”Mingus is often considered the heir apparent to Duke Ellington, for whom he expressed unqualified admiration. Indeed, Dizzy Gillespie had once claimed Mingus reminded him "of a young Duke", citing their shared "organizational genius."

Mingus was briefly a member of Ellington's band in 1953, as a substitute for bassist Wendell Marshall. Mingus's notorious temper led to his being one of the few musicians personally fired by Ellington (Bubber Miley and drummer Bobby Durham are among the others), after an on-stage fight between Mingus and Juan Tizol.
