,madtown4,2010-02-16T06:57Z,"i got a [REQ] 
Edge of Darkness R5 LINE XviD-MENTiON

you may have checked it out already ,if you think its a good share  can you please upload it . thanks again for what you do. "
,trax100,2010-02-16T07:11Z,even if it's not uploaded ...... I think everyone should watch the movie.
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-16T07:33Z,"EoD R5 needs to be checked in full, to avoid ""issues"" like screwed copies of Sherlock and Avatar. It means - I already have it, but after watching (if is OK) I must encode it. It takes some time.

Juno - surely goes.

But, 24 first, then the rest."
,stev666,2010-02-16T07:35Z,"Hey 20/40 thanks for another gr8 upload, i see there are allot of requests, so ill add mine please up Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief there are allot of cams out at the moment, i have patience and i am willing to wait till you have time to encode and up one or till you can find a good release. Thanks again my friend."
,madtown4,2010-02-16T08:09Z,"thanks , i hope its a good copy. thanks for sharing "
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-16T09:22Z,"@stev: I have done Percy somewhere during the Monday night. Source is terrible, and final encoding was also. We must wait (and it is movie for children or something like that. In short, movie is stupid, copy was bad. Result: I'll never do Percy again. Sorry.

@madtown: Bad news... sound is catastrophic... line? sure, if you do not know anything about.
Picture is, however, rip quality. 9.5. All-together, crap..."
,stev666,2010-02-16T09:34Z,"lol yes its for children and my girlfriends 12year old sister is driving me insane, not to worry 20/40 ill see if i can take her to see it over the weekend thanks again!"

[V],twentyforty,2010-02-16T13:35Z,"@womenball:Read aforementioned. It was R5. In next few days expect half dozen of re-encodes with same shitty audio. Maybe decent one pop-up, who knows.
