Schisms in Christianity - Reformation in 16th Century and Rise of Protestantism:

The biggest schism in Christianity started in the 16th century, in the year 1517, when Martin Luther announced his discontent with the Church in Rome, published "The Ninety Five Theses", and called for a debate on the Sale of the Indulgences by the clergy of the Church. This discontent quickly spread to other parts of Europe; Ulrich Zwingli in Germany, John Calvin in Switzerland, and others people in other countries.

These reformation movements eventually caused the rise of Protestantism and its breakup from the Roman Catholicism of the Papacy in Rome.
