,Crustynudger,2010-02-17T15:42Z,"They are rar'd becuase TvTeam are kind enough to release them on torrents as soon as they get released. That is why they are here so fast, and presuamably why you are here. STFU dickhead, you're clueless.

Many thanks TvTeam, most of us appreciate your work and the variety of programs you release."
