You at least want to give the basics. The most important is the NTSC or PAL format. Nothing more annoy than to waste a long gownload on the wrong type you can't use. Subtitle and Language choices are another one of the top three that any uploader should post at the bare minimum.
People can also get very picky about a full dvd in rar format. Quite a fe people have password protected them and force you to go on an ad click site to retrieve it. You'll notice how they get flamed in the comment section and in the forums."
