,iacoopa,2010-03-07T05:03Z,Thank you so much for the torrent. I'll be seeding as much as I can :)
,daneroverg,2010-03-14T13:48Z,"do i need his first patch to make this work?
if so, can someone give me a link to it.
much appreciated."
,-Cipher-,2010-03-19T14:58Z,"You don't need the first patch, but actually you don't need to download this either, download general knoxx RELOADED, it contains patch 1.3

,NAFrey,2010-06-04T05:39Z,"Hi Cipher, I've got a question. Are you sure this will work with a torrented Borderlands? I got it as a 'RELOADED' though.

I'm asking because I downloaded a patch from filefront or whatever, in hopes I could just download a crack from here, but nada. It said it would only update a retail DVD copy."
,-Cipher-,2010-11-02T22:37Z,"@NAFrey yes it'll work, but once again, this patch is outdated since a very long time, and i highly doubt there are seeders left, i already stopped seeding myself due to this patch being outdated, if there's a specific reason for you to need it, then contact me and i'll be sure to get you the files you need
