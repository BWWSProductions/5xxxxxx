This book is a practical guide to discovering and exploiting security flaws in
web applications. By â€œweb applicationâ€ we mean an application that is accessed
by using a web browser to communicate with a web server. We examine a wide
variety of different technologies, such as databases, file systems, and web services,
but only in the context in which these are employed by web applications.

If you want to learn how to run port scans, attack firewalls, or break into
servers in other ways, we suggest you look elsewhere. But if you want to know
how to hack into a web application, steal sensitive data, and perform unauthorized
actions, then this is the book for you. There is enough that is interesting
and fun to say on that subject without straying into any other territory.
