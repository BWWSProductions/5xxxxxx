Dutch band.
Hugely influenced by The Beatles.

TC and x-TC
At the time of their 'Midgety Mastery Tour' Tuesday Child was discovered by talent-scout Diana Muus of Sony Music Entertainment. Though her untimely death made it difficult for the band to keep going, the album 'Universal Playground' was released anyhow. It is still among the most colourful albums ever to have appeared from Frans Hagenaars' Sound Enterprise studio.
Everybody was impressed by the pace at which things were developing: they did some
national radio- and TV-shows, there was the constant touring of Dutch venues, and they even made a trip to the promised land of FunkPoppaRoll.
However, success could prevent Tuesday Child's fall from grace; arguments grew in number and intensity, while Mouse concentrated on writing and recording new material at l'Hermitage, his resurrected home-studio. Totally blind to the problems they were facing after two years of great adventure, he was ultimately unable to save the band from being taken down in a mock obituary.


Meanwhile in another universe, to kill time, Thijs Muus of Easy Meat had started an acoustic duo with Hugo Remmelt. Ironically, these successful strummers called upon the hero of our little story to produce both their albums. Now Roy Bouman had some time to kill; he started organizing stuff for a project called The Wishing Well and decided to employ The Rodent for the making of records with this collective of some thirty musicians from The Hague who are all linked to each other in one way or another.

In case you wonder if all these alliances have proved to be powerful enough to kill the hermit inside of Mouse, you should know he has recently finished work on a new Tuesday Child album called 'Vital Signs'. If it hadn't been for the band's demise, this particular CD would have been ready for release back in 1998. Simple maths tells us that The Graceful Kid has spent six years in hibernation, prone to unexpected events that came in a wide variety. Rumour has it that Tuesday Child has never been and never will be the same, but then againâ€¦ listening to the album I can hear a melodious thumping that's always been there and there's no reason why it should be different.
