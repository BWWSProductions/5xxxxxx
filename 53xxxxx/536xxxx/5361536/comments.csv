I noticed when listening to the mp3's of the first album, (Universal Playground) that 2 or 3 songs have a couple of small flaws...
You will notice that it's not really a problem, but I thought I'd let you all know.
As soon as I have a decent source again I will replace it with a better version.

In the meantime enjoy these two fantastic albums because according to what I found on the internet, this is all we can get because the band has split up this year..."
