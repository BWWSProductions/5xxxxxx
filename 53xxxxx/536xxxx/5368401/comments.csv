,CivicScootin,2010-02-18T00:57Z,"Not bad uploader..
To bad many of the emulators for the PS2 are out dated version on this ISO..

Still great work..

Thank you,
Civic/Scootin

Note to users with ESR..
Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Atari work with ESR..
Sega & Master system do not work with ESR.."
,CivicScootin,2010-02-19T16:55Z,"UPDATE:
Master system works with ESR after some more testing..

On start (at Emu's menu) press the ""O"" Button as this will change the version of Multiloader to 1.33..
Then select Master system..

NOTE:
PGen (Sega Gen.) Loads as well (when the version is changed to 1.33) however you are unable to boot the games from CD/DVD..
If there is a work around for this by all means please post it..

appreciate the effort of compiling and uploading ... really wanted to like this, but can't get it to work.

the menus pop up no problem, but getting anything to play is impossible. (well, at least for me). any ideas greatly appreciated!

thanks!"
,WizCat,2010-06-26T07:02Z,"Can someone please tell me how this works? I mean if I understand, it's an image for  PS2 that you burn and will have the emulators on it? Right? Or if I'm wrong can someone please explain how to get this to work?"

,cardink,2011-05-11T18:03Z,"don't work for me. Only the master system emulator worked. The rest, when i click,  not show the games and appeared only a dummy and dummy archives."
,demonkratzie,2011-08-05T10:01Z,I had the same problem with the nintendo emulator. I cannot save. WhatÂ´s the path are you saying. Can I find it into the emulator or is a configuration of the memory card? Anyone had problems with the master system emulator? It was not work here. Thanx
,demonkratzie,2011-08-06T06:13Z,"Ok, I did what the instructions says about the master system emulator but when I press the start anything happen and shows a black image. I choose the 1.33 version. I solved the problem with the nes emulator and now I can save. For whom that had same problem, try to access the nes emulatorÂ´s menu using the select or start buttom and change the save path.  "
