Summary

Insurance agent Pablo Sterni hits on a scheme to make easy money â€“
by pocketing the premiums of low risk clients. The scheme goes badly
wrong when one such client makes a claim for half a million francs
after his car is smashed up. As chance would have it, Pabloâ€™s distant
cousin LÃ©on has just inherited a million francs. LÃ©on lives alone,
running a shop that deals exclusively in merchandise relating to John Lennon
and Janis Joplin â€“ the result of a chance encounter with the singers
thirty years before. Pabloâ€™s only hope is to find a pair of Lennon and J
oplin look-a-likes who can persuade LÃ©on to part with his inheritance.
His wife Brigitte is at first reluctant to play the part of Joplin,
but soon finds that the role offers her a new lease of life. For the part
of Lennon, Pablo engages an unemployed actor, Walter Kingkate.
LÃ©on is completely taken in by the subterfuge â€“ but things go badly
wrong when both Brigitte and Walter start to take their roles a little too seriouslyâ€¦
