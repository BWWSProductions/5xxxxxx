Conception
French duo Airâ€™s debut album is a superlatively happy collection of experimental disco-mood sound nestled between ambient soundscape and breathy pop. Itâ€™s jazzy and melodic, and mostly laid-back, but not excessively so. There are a few shake-it, shake-it numbers, too, like the absurdly daft hit â€œSexy Boy.â€ Itâ€™s snap your fingers and hang out (while reading) music or dance around sexy-slow with your mate music. Itâ€™s also the perfect music to do your ironing or some other chore to; itâ€™s hypnotizing wallpaper music. It slips in and out of your consciousness, forcing you to move around with a relaxed smile before you even realize it. Oh, and contrary to sampler fashion, Nicolas Godin and Jean Benoit Dunckel played the instruments themselves. Bravo. â€”Mike McGonigal
