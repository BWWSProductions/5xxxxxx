,excelente,2010-03-09T05:12Z,"I got a few files out of it, but then checksum errors all over the place :("
,WWIIfan,2010-03-13T01:13Z,"are you gonna post a new version.
i really would have enjoyed them"
,etavirp,2010-03-15T19:19Z,This torrent is a great idea but IT DOES NOT WORK. File is damaged. Repair is not possible. :(
,The_BBP,2010-05-07T04:30Z,"Regardless of the complaints, you get an A for effort bro.  If you separate the files this will be MUCH more appealing.

I will have to wait until that happens before I commit to such a large download.  The efforts you put in are appreciated though."
,mark444444,2010-05-10T19:20Z,"I'd also like this, post here with a new link to your upload please"
,mfjk4270,2010-07-23T15:51Z,"I'm getting an error when I try to unzip:  ""Unexpected end of archive""  I've definitely downloaded the entire file (and checked it), so I don't know what the problem is.  Any help?  Thanks!"
,myukis,2011-02-25T15:52Z,"Wish this had worked, but I spent about a week running the download of this torrent non-stop and when it was completed, it says the 28 gig zip file is corrupted or damaged. I tried rebooting and resuming the torrent to see if there was missing data, no luck. Do not waste your time trying to get this one, and here's hoping someone in the future makes a bundle with separated zip files for the books."
,Admirefly,2011-08-21T00:19Z,Downloading a single compressed file of 27 GBs? Come on dude....you can do better than that
,The_Brain_Chyld,2011-10-27T08:23Z,"Use Zip Repair Pro (Registered Version) to extract this damaged zip file.  Took me 4 weeks to download and quite a few hours to figure out how to unzip but this worked for me.  Zip Reprair Pro  can be downloaded from TPB just look for ""Zip Repair Pro v4.2.0.1113 [ENG] [KEYGEN]"""
,kendofarfar,2011-11-11T22:16Z,I can't get this to work even with ZipRepairPro. Can someone give alternative solutions or maybe upload this as working files?
,xshinrax79,2011-11-16T23:12Z,if anyone needs star wars audio books i have them all let me know i will upload and seed for at least a week
,blueninja12,2012-01-06T02:36Z,@xshinrax79 - Please upload the complete working torrent. lots of us are looking for it. thanks.
