,iAteYourMum,2010-08-14T16:38Z,Can I just rehash and resign with my own console ID and stick it on my USB and transfer to my console?
,wolffman69,2010-10-01T02:36Z,hey so i put the cache in partition3. then put the 4156081C folder in the 000000000 folder that i had to add to the content folder because it was not already there.  I have the updated settings for the new COD look but when i go to the zombies the maps are grey and says i do not have this map... what is the deal?  I do not have a xbox live account. i thought this hack allowed me to play the zombie maps for free? anyone with any input?

Yes, you do need to connect. USB to USB.

The hdd/partition3/etc. is what i call i file string (idk if its actually called that) but when the Xbox is connected. you should see its icon on your desktop (Mac) or My Computer (PC/Windows)
Then you click on the icon then click on the hdd file then on partition3 then on cache and place the cache files you downloaded in there and the rest in hdd:/partition3/content/0000000000000000/
Hope this helps!
