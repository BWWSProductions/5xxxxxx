,TR33s,2010-02-17T20:44Z,any notes?
,toastysoul,2010-02-28T23:22Z,"Yeah, the game crashes on startup @ 1680x1050. 

It's not the uploader's fault, it's an unfixed game bug. You can try playing at a lower resolution, but there are other unfixed crash bugs as well. I deleted it after about 10 minutes because of it. How sad is that? Can't even get people to play the game when it's free... I'm glad I tried this first, I almost bought this about 3 month ago because I thought it looked cool. "
,Glamdring_RS,2010-06-09T23:11Z,"Something that works on most systems (Windows 7 64 and 32 bits included) to solve crash on this game is to delete IPHLPAPI.DLL from the Darkstar One folder. Then the game will load the file from the System32 folder. You could also try just to copy/paste, keeping the same file on both folders - the System32 version, of course. It also works as well."
,sinclairc5,2010-06-25T14:32Z,"This does not work in windows 7. It's not the uploaders fault there are some DLL incompatabilities that where shiped with the game.
ery buggy game but thanks for the up thenoobish.
I did get it to work in Windows xp though using Glamdring_RS method."

,endassey,2010-12-02T08:53Z,Some more people seeding more than 1 kb/s would be fantastic.
,novaca,2010-12-02T19:44Z,"Don't work when change the resolution, sad... 
Sinclair, didn't work to me delete DLL"
,erulian78,2011-03-07T16:02Z,Get the patch to 1.3 then get the crack from Gamecopyworld or wherever.
,higgie23,2012-01-07T22:42Z,"The file that cracked the problem with nodvd... It seems to be infected with trojan virus. voyager.dll seemed  to be infected with this virus. I am afraid that Company that made Darkstar One is no longer in business. I tried to download this Official patch it came up Error 404 page not found. I tried to access to website by name of company. it came up same result ERROR 404: Page not found. so I am no longer playing this DarkStar One... I deleted this whole game... I think it was great but tough mission... I found this error message is more confusing it seemed to be in german language... one file went AWOL,

Trainers may be difficult to get because the best trainer was found in Cheat happens website which is paysite..."
