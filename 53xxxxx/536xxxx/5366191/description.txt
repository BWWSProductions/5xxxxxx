From gruh's description:
This is a limited-run double live album (#821 of 3000, as it happens) comprised of the Philadelphia show and a few songs from the New York show on his US mini-tour in 2000.
There's an awful lot of amusing banter between songs, as Fish had a cold at the time and needed to rest his voice periodically.
