,hterag,2010-02-28T07:46Z,"I get an error when starting the program, after the Kernel Model Updater has finished running:

""Unable to start services.

See log files /tmp/vmware-root/setup6221.log for details.""

I'm sick of errors that make no sense."
,ScottyKUtah,2010-03-05T13:57Z,"Installed on a 9.10 Kubuntu notebook with KDE 4.4

Installation flawless, and opened up virtual machines created with Windows version of VMware with no problem.

One note, included serial numbers in instructions are only 20 characters, program requires 25 character key. Simply ran Keygen from Windows version to generate a new one and pressed on. 

The one I'm using is

It didn't work for me on Ubuntu 11.04. Tried many things: patched it, Hexed it. Nothing. Some say you need to compile your kernel. I dont want that. Thank you anyway."
