,Search4Lancer,2010-02-14T02:18Z,"It continues to boggle my mind why people think it's a good idea to zip up videos in a torrent. Complete waste of disk space having to keep the rar on my drive in order to seed the torrent, and eliminates any possibility to preview the videos while they're downloading."
,Erik_30,2010-02-14T03:52Z,Sorry i've never uploaded a torrent before.
,zushigreg,2010-02-14T04:58Z,"Thanks for the upload Erik_30. Bittorrent does not need to be archived; just put the videos in a folder next time . . . Regarding the video, it is real; it is a capture of CNN's story, and it does show the crash. The motion was too fast for the cameras to catch in much detail, though if you slow it down (in VLC), you can see what happened. This is tragic. One mistake and the guy dies? This looked like an avoidable incident to me. You have to expect some lugers are going to come off their sleds at each curve and potentially get thrown out of the track. That is exactly what happened here. My sympathies to Kumaritashvili's family, friends, and fans."
