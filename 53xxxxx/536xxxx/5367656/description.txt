Release Notes

Asking ten of your friends for the very best
phase of a summer festival, there is quite a
good possibility that you will receive the
same answer from most them: Sunday

And of course there are many reasons why
Sunday is so much special.Everybody has
become familiar with the venue and all the
other party freaks and everybody has become
part of that certain mutual groove
Especially when the name of this day of the
week turns out to keep what it promises: A
shiny, sunny day. And last but not least, the
music frequently is really special on Sundays
While central Europe is still struggling with
a really cold though beautiful winter, mister
Creator from Progressive hot spot Switzerland
sends out some first musical sunrays as a
foretaste for the upcoming outdoor season

Nine brand new tracks might really produce
somewhat similar to the euphoric hormone
cocktail in your head that comes along with
spring. In consequence, it wont be easy to
keep you feet calm during this delicious
Sunday meal
