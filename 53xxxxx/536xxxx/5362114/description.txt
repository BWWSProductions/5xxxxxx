About Ultimate:

"Imagine a place where Sunday afternoon and Monday night is not defined; where time is an illusion. There is no indication of economic decline, global despair or credit crisis. In this place, life is all that you want it to be, peaceful, serene and very calm. This place makes you feel good it is a tropical paradise, a perfect environment, a sort of utopia, do you get my drift? I know what you are thinking, does this place really exist, if it does please â€œTake Me thereâ€A â€œfeel goodâ€ phenomenon is spreading coast to coast at wind gusts of approximately 52 to 56 mile per hour, it is very contagious.

This experience is like an infectious disease. It has people dancing, feeling happy and is spreading rapidly worldwide. The cause of all this happiness in such difficult times is the new single recorded by â€œballerâ€, Morlon â€œUltimateâ€ Greenwood. The new single written and performed by Ultimate is created by â€˜producer extraordinaireâ€™ Blackout of the Blackout Movement. It is the latest installment of the offensive and defensive duo. It will hit hard on impact, make a lot of noise and create a big buzz. Ultimate, also known as, Morlon Greenwood was born and raised in Kingston Jamaica.
