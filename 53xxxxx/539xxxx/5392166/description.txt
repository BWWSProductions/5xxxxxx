NOTE: Today's episode of A. Idol is too big (XviD is 700MB) and by that unsuitable for many people...  this is  NOT my "usual" 720p re-encode. This is XviD re-encode for the people willing to take trade-offs.

Please, read my last comment there. Yesterday was practically ruined day because of hard-fisting. Please, DO NOT put your upload speeds at minimum, SHARE with the others DURING THE DOWNLOAD. Based on what has happened yesterday I would be forced to remove this torrent and stop seeding if something like that happens here.
