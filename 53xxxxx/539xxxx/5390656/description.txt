The lives and work of the staff in a major Los Angeles law firm.

This very popular series from the '80s har only been available as a torrent without enough seeders. I managed to get it up to 100% after two weeks of patient waiting. Amazon has promised a future DVD to be signed up for. In the meantime, you can do with this.

This must be a TV-rip from a rerun. Quality is not great, but OK, and sound is stereo in some of the episodes. Many TV channels did not have stereo copies or equipment when the series originally aired.
