,upweyguy,2010-03-12T05:07Z,Excellent.  Thank you so much for putting this show up.  Any chance of a Season 2?
[V],Kuthumi,2010-03-14T17:06Z,"Amazon.com has promised a DVD release for this season (season 1) which we no longer need because this torrent is alive. There has been no mentioning of season 2.
However, in the U.S., AOL shows reruns. If someone knows someone in the U.S.  who knows how to make TVrips, he has his big chance!

,chefalu1,2010-07-22T13:05Z,THanks...I got such a kick out of this.  I second a request for the second season.  
,digimike50,2010-08-09T03:11Z,Many thanks!
,skippyar,2010-08-25T13:49Z,"Many thanks! What's with the minus ratings, the quality is absolutely fine."
[V],Kuthumi,2010-08-28T06:13Z,skippyar: Some visitors here have misunderstood the system and give a minus quality vote if they do not like the CONTENTS of a film or series. Such voting should be done at Imdb. This quality vote should only concern technical quality.
