,MyNipple,2010-03-07T12:30Z,"oh how i love you. Could you please tell me whats going on with the new smallville?, i've looked for it about 7 times and if its not out till 13/03 it'll stop me looking for it another 50 times. As tv goes first it was BBC TV then it was SKY TV BUT THEY BOTH pale into insignificance compaired to EZTV.
MyNipple like you all."
,davitodude,2010-04-21T06:59Z,Great quality in both picture and sound. One single video file unlike some of the other smallville torrents I have seen broken into separate pieces for whatever reason. 
,firstindianblue,2010-05-07T16:30Z,Great torrent. eztv - you are the legend my man!
