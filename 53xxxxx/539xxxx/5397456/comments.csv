Thank you for this, the final one.

Please ignore my question in 'Ricky Gervais' as you are, as usual, well ahead of the game.

Cheers
Jon
Please seed people."
,jon4fun,2010-02-27T16:44Z,"Hi 20-40,
Read your comments (Vicious Kind) and I appreciate, as I've said way back, you stickng with this series.

We spoke about this before and in the first 2 episodes I seeded to 11:1 and then went to 4:1. I'll go to 4:1 on this at maximum upload speed (which is only 30KBs for me).
I'll hold off any other ups/downs until this is completed on my end.

Does that sound fair, should I seed longer?

Thanks again.

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-27T17:11Z,"@Jon: I was surprised by what the_shroud (old ""regular"" from blown star) have said, three days. It seems impossible, if few people seed, right? It's only 200 MB. But - it fits. In the picture. Nothing to you personally, my friend, but you have (as I always do) watched how people hit 100% and - PUFF! - vanish without giving a byte to others. Number of Hit&Runs on such rare, old series from BBC archive is really pathetic, as nobody cares... well, few of us did for a while..."
,jon4fun,2010-02-27T17:12Z,"Hi 20-40,
Don't know if this is the 'uk tv people' up to their tricks or something else.
I'm seeing around 30 peers (only 1 visible) and no upload from my end with download speed at 1KBs.

I'm going to stop and wait for an hour and try again.
I don't want to mess up your 'initial seed' with my low bandwidth.

Let me know if you want me to do anything or come on now or later?
Your call, Maestro!

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-02-27T17:27Z,"Hi 20-40,
I am trying to be nice and give people the benefit of the doubt & you know how hard that is for me.

I still have E 1-5 in uTorrent and I will start seeding again if anyone is interested.

Caveats: I'll only do it AFTER I have downloaded and seeded this episode to 4:1 and then would prefer to do the other episodes one at a time. 
NB: My upload speed is 30KBs +/- so doesn't make sense to upload all at the same time.

So requests taken, as 20-40 has given more than he should have already (H&R bastards).

In this comment area, until Wednesday, I will check to see if anyone has a request for a previous episode and I will seed.

20-40, you have the patience of stone!

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-27T17:42Z,"@Jon: LOL, you really mess up initial seeding (RSS + low bandwidth) but I never had heart to tell you that.
I have stopped the seeding too, for the same reason - I ""see"" 24 gremlins which bang on the door and one snail who obviously have never learned anything nor read my shit about how he practically ""kills"" seeding and by that anybody else. I do not think that such illiterate people even care, about others, about their deeds and consequences, about anythin' and nothin'..."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-27T17:44Z,err: anybody = all others
,jon4fun,2010-02-27T18:10Z,"Hi 20-40,
You are too nice, I kind of realised that RSS DL would cause a problem but I was hoping that with the refresh rate, of Feed Updates, I would either miss or get in at the very end of an initial seed.

So now what I am doing is letting RSS start and then stopping the DL immedaitely until the initial seeding, hopefully, has finished. I leave it for an hour or two, try again and see what the seeds are. If still too low, I stop again and wait.

So at the moment, I've got Ricky and Bill M in queue but 'stopped'. Same with EOD and only activity is seeding Smallville until it gets to 4:1.

Sorry for causing problems in the past. I'll do my best to make sure it doesn't happen in the future.

@ ALL, Look at that, I'm learning from my mistakes and trying to be responsible.
Now if only some you other F$%ÂŁ@ would stop hitting and running we could all live peaceably.

Cheers
Jon
P.S. @ 20-40 thanks for calling me on my mistake."
,the_shroud,2010-02-27T19:13Z,"I'm sure when I came on there were several seeders and was downloading at decent speed (relatively). Suddenly, I checked back again there's only 1 seeder like its on initial seeding so I stopped.
I kept seeding the other 5 all this while and building up my ratio.
Btw, remember Being Human Complete S1? I went through such hardship to complete the download, after that I stubbornly refuse to stop seeding, after like weeks of being only seeder, I'm proud to say today I've procreated 8 seeders :)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-27T19:56Z,"@Jon and presumably many many other people:
As I have explained like zillion times on blown star, having torrent only loaded is the same as been client with technical problems or been a gremlin (of whatever kind) who just sit on the torrent and either collect IPs of the swarm members or just make our lives harder acting like ""byte-thrasher"".
There is no difference in acting (or inaction) and from time to time such sitting ducks are first one to go in the process of swarm purification.

Further, it means squat if Jon, the shroud, me and whoever use PeerBlock and have all sorts of gremlins blocked. Just one guy, who hasn't done so, would drag the infestation in the swarm.

That's why I have begged people not to join to initial-seeding if they are not old dogs in all that jazz. Initial-seeders are special breed of P2P veterans or the ones who wants to become all-knowing all-seeing gurus of P2P moors.

Not because I want to prevent someone to get what he wants, but to PREVENT SOMEONE WHO PREVENTS ALL OTHERS in getting what is on the table. 
Most people do bad things just 'cause they know shit about the things they trying to do but are silly (and stupid) enough not to learn or to ask."
,jon4fun,2010-02-27T20:11Z,"Hi 20-40,
Sorry, my fault completetly.

I ddin't understand that if you started the DL and stopped it at o% it would still count as taking a slot or your upload bandwidth.

I'll delete them from torrent and try again later.

I live & learn.

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-27T20:43Z,"No problem, Jon, at least you ask or say... you see, when torrent is loaded (opened), he becomes active by saying ""I'm alive, my IP is this one and I want that specific thing"" to tracker server.
Paused or stopped later, it doesn't matter, your program may report changed status by changing the ""flags"" -but also, may not... fact is, you are reported to tracker and to members of the swarm till you UNLOAD the torrent. Pressing the Stop or Pause doesn't do the trick."
,jon4fun,2010-02-27T20:54Z,"Thanks 20-40,
I didn't understand that it worked that way and now I do and will do my best not to get into that situation again.

Thanks for explaining. I have never been afraid of saying 'I don't know!'.
And I am willing to learn.

Cheers
Jon"
,lilars26,2010-02-27T21:22Z,"Thank you Jon and 20/40.
I haved enjoyed this exchange between you guys.I have learned a little more and it's 
so nice that it is not me causing 20-40 to
bang his head against the wall for a change.
lol."
,mrhinter,2010-02-28T00:27Z,"was a lil slow getting to this one, i agree lilars, very informative exchange, seeding away as usual, WE FINALLY MADE IT THROUGH THIS LOT! 

still seeding every ep, even if there are some gremlins ewoks thrashers and goblins out there, lets keep it alive for as long as we can!

scraping through into the new month over the next 14 hours, so all is well for a good run of seeding!

thanks two oh, keep up the good work!
(btw - does anyone know how long human target is on break for? having withdrawals lol)"
