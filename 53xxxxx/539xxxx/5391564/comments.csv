,cigaretteburns,2010-02-25T12:24Z,"Dear paulderby, the running time probably differs due to the PAL download running faster than film or NTSC standard at 25 fps instead of 24fps. This would account for the 4 minutes as nothing appears to be missing. "
,table543,2010-02-25T13:36Z,"Raymondhome:   You suggest to (!!ATTENTiON!!: IF YOU CONVERT THIS TO DVD WITH ConvertXtoDVD 4 OR LATER, SELECT/CHECK THE ""Do not fix audio discontinuities"" OPTION TO KEEP SYNC.) 

Do you reccomend turning this feature off completely?? for all conversions????"

anything against the quality of this upload has an agenda. You don't have to like the movie,
but you don't have a leg to stand on when you
criticize the quality   "

,linkjones,2010-02-28T01:47Z,"Currently digital videos lack sync stability so try another player. VLC usually corrects them. Sometimes it can be due to a codec, Downloading again will do if there was data loss in the transfer. I don't know the options Convert-X offers but if your DVD player doesn't support H-264 you will need to convert to MPEG that also applies to burning onto CD-R."
