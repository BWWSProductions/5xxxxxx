Is there a easy way to fix this problem?"
[V],RiddlerA,2010-03-02T03:24Z,"@ jorss

Yeah subtitles are a little out of sync
I couldn't find ones which are in perfect sync
If u r using GOM Player u can manually sync them.
Its very easy & user friendly player.
I recommend GOM Player for my Uploads"
