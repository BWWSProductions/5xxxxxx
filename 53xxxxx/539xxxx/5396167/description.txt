This includes:
- The Sims 3 1.0.631 (Final/Store copy)
- The Sims 3 Extras - Downloads
including all hairs, clothes, Riverview neighborhood, etc. (Includes all extra content EA charges for as of 6/2/09)
- The Sims 3 mountable image "crack" to get the game working basically

I pulled these files from different resources. I CANNOT take credit for being the creator of any of them, and I regret not keeping track of who I should credit. The only thing I've done is made it a one-stop torrent. If you have any questions please post on the torrent.
Also, Ive divided up the torrent between the "NO-CD CRACK", The Sims 3 FINAL copy, and the store items. Feel free to select just what you need.

UPDATE: I've confirmed that both the Read me included and the directions I posted here earlier were not correct in that the order of them were mixed up. HOWEVER, to fix this I've created a visual guide with pictures and tested it to ensure it works. Please continue to post any questions you have and I'll do my best to ensure success. Thank you for your patience!
