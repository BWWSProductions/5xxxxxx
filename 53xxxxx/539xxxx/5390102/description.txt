okay now this both my first torrent and my first sucessful dvd rip. The file is a lot larger than I had hoped so if anyone has any tips on ripping a more reasonable sized file I'd appreciate it. Also, I intend to add a torrent of other percussion tutorial videos I've managed to accumulate for all to download.
I put this up here coz good percussion tutorial torrent is hard to find and I wanted a friend to be able to use this, as long as the torrent is here you can guarantee I'll keep seeding when I have my pc on but I'd appreciate seeds

so plz seed ppl

John Sleiman: Middle Eastern Drumming for beginners

John Sleiman is a very talented percussionist. And for the record, the kind of drum played is called a DARBUKA. The word "tabla" is the arabic word for drum and the specific instrument "tablas" are completely different.

this video doesn't feature the "split finger" technique that I recommend you look into (check out "fingers of fury" on  y o u t u b e )

The belly dancers shall love you as they do me :-D
