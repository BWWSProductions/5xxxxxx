A psychedelic trip through a variety of musical styles from Ambient to Drum'n'Bass, with a little Dub, Trip Hop and Jazz thrown in for good measure. Something for both the mind and the body, yep this album has it all. Slabs of groove so solid you could lay a patio with 'em, plus tunes and stuff.

The music on this particular demo disc comprises the first material I composed using a PC alone, as opposed to the racks of horrendously expensive electronic equipment I previously used to work with.
Hopefully the results stand up for themselves so there's little need for me to rattle on any more about it.

Enjoy responsibly, under adult supervision.
