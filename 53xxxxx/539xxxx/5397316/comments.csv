Been trying to get it for sometime now and there is nothing but fakes and crap out there.  Amazes me how they can continue to upload movies and get away with it or they want you to give your number and or download a different program to watch it. Again thanks so much for all your time and effort.  Its very much appreciated."

Since the LOTR started to appear on usenet and torrents could you be a decent lads and make a really great quality rip. By great quality I mean 1080p in 4.37 GB or in 8 GB. 
This particular release is all about quality since these all parts are not even extended cuts. I am positive your fans would really appreciate it. 
You are the only guys who can do this up to really high standard. 

Thanks for all the hard work. Stay cool and remember FullHd is a proper direction, when size kept under 4.37GB. 
It'll quadruple the results of your work."

However, your (and the other guys') .mp4-files will only have sound when I switch the audio output in the player's system settings to ""stereo"". Any idea why that is so? I'm aware of the Xbox360's audio problem(it used to be my media player before getting a WD TV) but now with WD TV I do not have that problem anymore except for your movies.

,PsydeFX,2010-03-30T19:38Z,"really CinemaZone? I think we're capable of clicking on his name to see all of his torrents. And if you don't know the other accounts by now, then maybe you should visit Kingdom.."

,as14ever,2010-07-03T19:29Z,"Movie request to any one that can do it. I have a request for some very hard movies to find as mpeg4 BRRip H264 AAC3 in resolutions: 1280x544 or 1280x720 or even 1920x1080p

The Movies are: Appleseed 2004 
Tron 1982
Brazil 1985
Naked Lunch 1991
Conan the Barbarian 1982
Conan the Destroyer 1984
The Dark Crystal 1982
King Kong 1976
The Secret of NIMH 1982
Spike Lee School Daze 1988
Spike Lee Mo Better Blues 1990

If any one can find these movies in the format mentioned above, or can create them in the same quality as secret_myth I would be very appreciative and can maybe work on some type of compensation if needed.

Let me know at firstliight@yahoo.com "
