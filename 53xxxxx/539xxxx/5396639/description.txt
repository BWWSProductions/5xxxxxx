THE ALEX JONES SHOW 
2010.02.26 Friday

Alex welcomes back to the show Nigel Farage, British politician, former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, and member of the European Parliament for the South East. Farage faces an official reprimand by the European Parliament for criticizing its president Herman Van Rompuy on Wednesday. Alex also talks with John Young, webmaster of Cryptome, a website that covers news on freedom of speech, cryptography, spying, and surveillance. The ISP Network Solutions shuttered Young's site earlier in the week after he posted a document summarizing Microsoft's dealings with law enforcement agencies. Microsoft has since withdrawn a Digital Millennium Copyright complaint and Cryptome is once again live. Alex talks about the economy and other topics with weekly guest Bob Chapman, publisher of the International Forecaster.
