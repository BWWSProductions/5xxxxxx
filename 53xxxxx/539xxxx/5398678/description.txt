Shawn and Gus are recruited into a think tank to help prevent the murder of business tycoon Ashton Bonaventure (Chris Sarandon). While Shawn doesn't shine in the group, he figures out that someone in the think tank was using it to figure out ways to kill Bonaventure, so he manages to be put in charge of his security and re-assembles the remaining members to help him prevent the assassination attempt.
