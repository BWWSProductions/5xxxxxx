The ultimate Nintendo hero is taking the ultimate step... out into space. 
Join Mario as he ushers in a new era of video games, defying gravity across 
all the planets in the galaxy. When some creature escapes into space with 
Princess Peach, Mario gives chase, exploring bizarre planets all across the 
galaxy. Players run, jump and battle enemies as they explore the many planets. 
For Mario to succeed, gamers will press buttons, swing the Wii Remote and 
Nunchuk controllers and even use the Wii Remote to point at and drag things 
on-screen.
