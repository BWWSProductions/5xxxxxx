this is the old (outdated and unsupported now) vmware server for Linux. its the free-version. also include vmware-any-any-update115.tar.tar

i only upload this as i prefer this over the newer version for certain things and couldnt find it anywhere else and wanted it available on the net.


dunno if more serials are given out for this.. so unless you already have some, this is useless for you and youd be better off getting the newest version. however if you PM me I might have one or two left overs.. :]

try the vmware-any-any-update if the install fails, like if it says kernel compiled with different gcc than what youre currently running.. then try it, works for several other things too.

also, this might require a console for remote administration that is no longer available.. Im not sure. if someone finds it- please let me know :)
