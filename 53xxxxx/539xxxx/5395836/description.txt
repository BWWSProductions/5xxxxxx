FRAT HOUSE is an unreleased documentary, produced by THE HANGOVER director Todd Philips early in his career.  It was acquired for release by HBO, but quickly shelved and never shown.  An official reason was never given, but probably involved legal clearances and permission from documentary subjects and interviewees.

Award winner at Sundance 1998, this copy of Frat House was exported for viewing before HBO decided to shelve the movie.


The weird farming clip is a result of the VHS being partially taped over.  Apologies.
