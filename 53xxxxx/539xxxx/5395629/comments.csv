,681996,2010-03-02T13:28Z,nice job! works perfectly
,DuckBuck,2010-03-20T05:45Z,"I have version 2.0.3 installed. I just grabbed this torrent and will retrieve program and save it until I can't handle the nag screens from NCH. This is one awesome program to have installed, for I've managed to fix several issues with mp3 files and Windows Media Player that keeps saying it can't play file blah, blah, blah. My understanding is, you must use the program provided in this torrent and only to be able to use the patch? I'll check back to look for your answer, BT. Thanks."
,jkef,2010-04-12T09:47Z,Thanks a lot!!!!
,skwiez,2010-04-21T21:27Z,Worked great! All I needed to do was import the registry key it unlocked the full version.
,neweasy,2010-05-03T04:51Z,"thank you baby, it did the job"
,ozizo,2010-06-17T10:46Z,"the reg file works like magic

I installed this program from a different torrent and only used the reg file in this one.

thank you BLACKTROY! wonderful job."

,savvage,2010-07-29T02:07Z,sweet as a nuts! thanks
,Necrosis7,2010-08-13T09:23Z,hey... i apologize for the lack of knowledge.. so how does all this work.. i have the demo version of switch...  not sure where to buy it i from if i have to but how does this patch work?
,Necrosis7,2010-08-13T09:45Z,ok  scratch my earlier comment.... .i used your registry code thing and that worked...  but these patch things  just open up inside the switch program  to be converted...  not sure why that is... so any help on how to get it all to work  would be appreciated
,anonymous7666,2011-01-01T14:50Z,Finally found a good version of this great program. Thank you BLACKTROY!
