Jimmy Kilmartin's an ex-con who's trying to go straight. But he can't say

no to a quick driving job because his so called friend's life is threatened.

 The job is for Little Junior Brown, a violent and powerful villain.
 
 When things go wrong, Jimmy is left to do the time, and his whole life is

 turned upside-down, but if that wasn't enough, the cops won't leave Jimmy

 alone when he gets out... They want 'Little Junior'
