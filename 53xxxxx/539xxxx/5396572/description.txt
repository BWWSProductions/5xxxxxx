GrÃ©co made an acclaimed debut as a singer in 1949, premiering songs with the words of such leading French poets as Jacques PrÃ©vert ("Les Feuilles Mortes"), Jules Laforgue ("L'Eternel FÃ©minin"), and Raymond Queneau ("Si Tu T'Imagines") set to music by Joseph Kosma. In the new postwar songs, lyrics were privileged over the bigger orchestrations favored by singers like Edith Piaf; GrÃ©co's intellectual bent made her the perfect interpreter for this new movement. Her singing style shared the dramatic enunciation of Jacques Brel and the droll delivery of Georges Brassens, her contemporaries in quite different musical scenes, while showcasing a sensuality all her own. GrÃ©co released the song "Je Suis Qui Je Suis," again with words by PrÃ©vert  and music by Kosma, two years later -- it was a huge hit for her.
