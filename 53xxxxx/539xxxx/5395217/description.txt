Hi all, just a little reminder, or a request if you will. 

It's disappointing to see that not many people bother to seed what they 
download. As a result the uploader often has to use bandwidth to keep older 
torrents alive for those who hop on later and it slows things down for 
everybody. It may also result in the uploader not uploading anything new as 
there is no bandwidth to spare. Keeping torrents 
open helps everybody. The seeder gets upload credit, the leecher might get the 
show a bit faster and it frees the regular uploaders to upload new stuff. 

So, if possible, please stay on what you download.
