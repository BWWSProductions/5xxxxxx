Rectangular Industrial Duct Construction Standards, Metric (SI) Version

Published: 2007

Description:

This version of the Rectangular Industrial Duct Construction Standards, 2nd edition (2007) is uniquely identified as the SI version (Metric â€“ le SystÃ¨me International dâ€™UnitÃ©s) to differentiate it from the version published in 2004 as the I-P version (Inch Pound). This latest publication is based on the exact same theoretical work and scope of the earlier I-P version. What differs greatly between the two publications is that in the SI version the data is expressed in metric units and the ratings are based on the use of materials produced under and to ISO standards, in both strength and physical dimensions (we refer to this methodology as Hard Metric). This characteristic makes the information directly usable in the international market.
