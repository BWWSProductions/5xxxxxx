[V],ill88eagle,2010-02-24T21:33Z,"Its not the first time people complain about FLaC img's with cue files... I wont go into a discussion about pros and cons. 

Suffice to say: If you load the .cue file into a compatible media player (VLC or WINamp) it will load the flac file as separate tracks just like when you load a CD.

If you prefer separate files there are several free flac tools that can split the flac img's for you. I can higly recommend cuetools: http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=66233"
