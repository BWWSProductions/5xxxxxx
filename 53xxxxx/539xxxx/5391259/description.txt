If itâ€™s Monday, it must be another tired attempt to reanimate the health care bill in Congress.  Maybe itâ€™s time to pull the plug and put us out of itâ€™s misery.  Today President Obama met with the nationâ€™s governors and made a final push to pass some kind of health care reform legislation.  The White House will not scrap all previous plans and start anew, as has been suggested by both sides, but instead will push the Senate plan, with the new proposal to create a Health Insurance Rate Authority to provide oversight and assistance that will help states conduct reviews of â€œunreasonable rate increases.â€

Naturally, the Republicans immediately rejected the idea, slamming it as a massive government takeover of the health care industry.  As the Washington Post reports, â€œThis new Democrats-only backroom deal doubles down on the same failed approach that will drive up premiums, destroy jobs, raise taxes, and slash Medicare benefits,â€ said House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). â€œThis weekâ€™s summit clearly has all the makings of a Democratic infomercial for continuing on a partisan course.â€

At this point Obama could promise to take every American out for ice cream out of his own pocket, and the NeoCons would accuse him of some devious plot to infect the nation with Diabetes.

Weâ€™ll debate this nonsense, deconstruct the CPAC circus, the NATO airstrike that killed Afghan civilians, and much more madness on the program tonight!  877-996-2556
