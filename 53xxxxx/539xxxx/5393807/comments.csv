A: 8/10 (only cause I have 7.1 surround)
V: 9/10 Video was clear and quality is good for its type.

Again thank you and more power!"

Movie is ok. Awesome sword fights, and not bad writen story. Naomie Harris worst choice actress for this movie though, she played better as a witch in Pirates of the Caribbean :P"

A bit low quality than your usual uploads, but thanks anways extremezone!"
,ToTheGrind,2010-02-27T15:39Z,"V: 9 (ever so slightly grainy, you can notice when screen goes black, does not effect the quality of the film though)
A: 10 (could not complain about it whatsoever)
M: 8 (was a bit too modernised for my liking, i prefer the House of flying daggers style for this movie genre but was still and awesome film nonetheless)
D/L speed: good i guess, took under 1 + half hours 

@ sudosven, i watched this movie on VLC last night just fine

Plenty of action in this but quite thin on plot, if you want a move to just sit and watch without thinking this is for you. Great quality thanks for upload"
,Archangeldawn,2010-02-28T23:42Z,"as always, thanks extremzone for the great uploads
question though, I got the spanish subtitles it stated for the MAXSPEED version, but for the english version I only saw DiAMOND and aXXo (which I doubt he's uploaded ninja assassin). So maybe I need another source for Subtitles, do you recommend any? Or anyone else that knows of subtitle sites? I only know of the subscene and subdivx (spanish subs) sites."

,AkaPhsyco,2010-03-01T11:46Z,"Hey MPAA you ever heard of innovation? 

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding. 

Thanks for your time and enjoy your content.

Best 'Ninja' movie out there to date! 

More blood than I've seen in any non-samurai martial arts movie.  Great use of light [muzzle flares, flashlights, etc.) to expose sometimes silent but always deadly maneuvers. 

Ryzo character is convincing.

Must watch."
,random-critic,2010-03-04T15:04Z,"Thank you extemezone, for the 2000th time. Lol.

With this one, I feel like I should have thanked you before ever watching the movie.

,Exodus666,2010-03-05T03:09Z,"Good download, good quality, and surprisingly good movie.
All the critics slaughterd it, but the fact is its not bad at all.
The plot is nothing special and the actors could be better, but the story is good, the dialog is very good, its well directed, handles all the cliches well, is subtle when it needs to be and all out when it needs to be.

Best western ninja movie ever?
Yeah pretty much. "

Had a problem putting it onto DVD tho with Nero. DVD+R or DVD-R neither worked, the film would just skip really fast and not play normally, tried 3 different blank disks. Maybe just me dunno, but plays fine on any PC."

,Quantum12,2010-03-21T06:12Z,"Quality is pretty good but unfortunately the movie is a bag of shit. It boasts the most ridiculous plot this side of a Steven Seagal movie and the acting is cringeworthy. Some of the fight sequences are OK, but again they've been done much better elsewhere.
