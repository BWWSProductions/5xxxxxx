Picking up the baton from previous BBC Sound of the Year winners Adele and Little Boots, Ellie Goulding is the latest break-out star of British pop. Defying pigeon-holers and hacks everywhere, Goulding's sound blends dance, folk, pop, electronica and everything in between.

Goulding developed her sound with the help of British electro-pop genius Frankmusik, culminating in the release of debut album Lights.The record shuns clichÃ©d pop beats and subject matter, replacing them with infectious, danceable tunes and heartfelt lyrics.

First single Under the Sheets is the template, an electro-soaked dance track with Goulding's processed voice tugging at the heart-strings. Get used to it: it's the sound of 2010.
