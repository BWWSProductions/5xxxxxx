I am currently backing up tons of my movies from dvd to mpeg, ect to put on my new 1500 gig external harddrive for ps3. Can you tell me what converter your using to get yours to be 4 gigs exactly? Some of mine go over, and the Fat32 format for the harddrive can't handle anything past that. Thanks. "
