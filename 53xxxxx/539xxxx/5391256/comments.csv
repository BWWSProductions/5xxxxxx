I hope I didn't do too badly.  Any useful comments appreciated."

,panteranegra,2010-02-25T14:50Z,"Well, you did it. It's a bit blurry, audio is fine. AVI format. I don't have much experience with encoding, but from what I've seen, Xvid looks sharper. Thanks."
,kralcx,2010-02-25T15:08Z,Thanks for the feedback.  At least I'm headed in the right direction (smile).
