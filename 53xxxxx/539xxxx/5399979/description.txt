Aarteet CD 1994


After sweet memories play born to lose again 
Ap 76 setting sun 
Beaty colored green a 
Branded man 
Charm of country music 
Daddy frank 
Good time charlies got the blues 
Help me make it through the night 
I'm just me 
If youve got a restless mind 
Is anybody goin to san antone 
Jambalaya 
Jealous heart 
Leavin something left to do 
My old love 
North to chicago 
Ride me down easy 
Searching for the morning sun 
Sometimes i've got to get relaxed 
Streets of baltimore 
Tennessee girl 
They covered up the old swimmin hole 
Turn out the light and love me tonight 
Weekend daddy 
Yes virginia
