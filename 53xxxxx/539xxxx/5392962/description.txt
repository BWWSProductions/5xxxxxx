This release is the accumulated works of JustLikeAmmy thus far....


There are 17 tracks, and there aren't really too many words that could be used to summarize them.


He likes to experiment an insane amount with music, and really try to make the kind of shit he's never heard before. Since they're experiments, sometimes they don't turn out right. But just like experiments, they are equally as interesting for him to see the result of regardless of outcome.


So grab this shit up and decide if you like it :) 


Make dem ossicles dance!

....or....seizure!!! :P
