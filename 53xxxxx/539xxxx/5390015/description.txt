Skijump.Challenge.2001.PC.Game(djDEVASTATEâ„¢)


This highly realistic ski-jump simulation now features 16 true-to-life
venues, where players have to qualify for each event against a field of 72
computer-generated opponents. Other new features include a multiplayer mode,
in which as many as 16 players can compete on the same computer.

In the new version, the realistic gameplay has been developed even further, 
with each jump recreated using data provided by the International Ski Federation, 
the FIS. Other authentic features include a scoring system where points are 
awarded for body position and landing, as well as a range of management and 
training options. One of the most intriguing dimensions of the game is the 
ability to hire a trainer and choose your own ski equipment in a bid to 
improve your performance over the season. After developing your ability in 
training and competition, you can even save your jumper on diskette and pit 
your skills against friends.
