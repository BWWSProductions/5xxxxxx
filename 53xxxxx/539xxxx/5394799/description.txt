OK guys and gals, listen up:

This is, like my Dragon Age which I uploaded, uncracked and/or unpatched.
That means: By downloading this, you won't be able to play it YET.
Its the untouched digital download version, it has no DVD check,
just an online activation. I activated mine with a legit key and it works.
The game is protected by Aspyrs own registration system called "Software Passport",
but this is way easier to [k] than secuROM - it already happened before with CoD4
and other games from Aspyr. So please, don't ask for serials or cracks right now,
because there are NONE. But feel free to download this huge game of 12GB so you
have it ready to play once medicine comes out by a release group (it will happen)

The day a working patch is released, this post will be edited so you won't miss it.

*** Crack is OUT : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5404355

Also, feel free to buy the game if you can't wait (thats the spirit anyway :D)
