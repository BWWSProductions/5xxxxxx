Will some people stop being so selfish and start uploading!"
,Dragonforce79,2010-02-28T15:45Z,Seeding the last % now ;)
,Dragonforce79,2010-02-28T16:43Z,"It should have enough seeders now, at least 20
I'm done here ;)"
,efxr,2010-02-28T18:02Z,"I'm also done, thank you.

I'm looking at cracking this game, but don't hold your breath. "
,moryok,2010-03-02T05:51Z,I am not going to download this until there is a working crack for it hopefully a working crack will come soon for this game
,bagau142,2010-03-02T12:50Z,Thanks a lot! Fuctioneaza well.
,Dragonforce79,2010-03-02T14:45Z,"crack is out, confirmed working
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5404355"
,ionlyknow,2010-03-02T16:38Z,"Is there any way this will work on:
2 GHz instead of 2.4 GHz?
1 GB RAM instead of 2 GB RAM?
ATI Raedon HD2400 instead of ATI Raedon HD2600
VRam 128 MB instead of 256 MB?

Please answer!"
,Dragonforce79,2010-03-02T18:10Z,"No idea... it might work, but most likely you will have no fun playing it..."
,BILLTOWN,2010-03-03T06:24Z,"i just want to say thanks to all for this game, a real thanks and to all who are working on other game and to all that have work and giving us all of these great games for the mac, a big thanks

,carlo.magno16,2010-03-03T10:27Z,thank you so mch for sharing this great game. 
,ionlyknow,2010-03-03T12:40Z,"@scubasme and Dragonforce79
Thanks for an answer! It's not possible to lower all the settings to lowest or off then? "
,Dragonforce79,2010-03-03T22:29Z,"Like I said, I have no idea. Download and try it."
,iPeck,2010-03-04T21:02Z,"
running 10.6.2 and im experiencing mouse bugs within the game...
so beware ;)"
,iPeck,2010-03-04T21:53Z,never mind for the last comment ;) figured it out lol
,xXshur1kenXx,2010-03-08T01:48Z,"i just got the game and cracked it, yet to run

intel mac w/ snow leopard :P"
,booboo332,2010-03-08T07:51Z,"@ionlyknow - I have tried the game on a Nvidia MacMini with 1GB of ram and while it runs, it is not playable.  I also did not see any way to change video quality other than reducing resolution to 800x600.

It may run better with more RAM but it is hard to be sure if it will be enough.  With 2GB or RAM Macs with the Nvidia integrated graphics have access to 256MB of VRAM and that may do it.  Personally, I am not going to try it again until I have 4GB of RAM and it still might not be enough."
,gi4mi,2010-03-08T18:47Z,I'm on an iMac 2gb of ram and plays like a charm (ati HD 2600)
,moryok,2010-03-08T23:53Z,This game lags to much for me to play it i have a intel tiger mac that i got in 2007 that i upgraded to snow leopard 10.6.2 can my computer not handle this game somebody please respond as soon as possible cuz i need to know if i should delete it or not cuz its taking up a lot of space
,ffrumblefoot,2010-03-11T23:16Z,if we only need the first .dmg do we not have to download the other ones? 
,Shadowland,2010-03-15T22:37Z,"Thanks Gragonforce :)  The game works great and plays just fine.  To set your resolution lower when the tool pops up first time just set it a bit low.  I'm on a 24 inch iMac 256MB graphics card with 3GB of RAM and as long as I down my resolution to 1280x800 and uncheck the ""super high details"" it is VERY playable since I've played it all weekend long.  Definitely worth the download and seeding to be sure.  Keep in mind folks its a high end game recommended for a newer quad core so no it won't be super ultra fast so just adjust your settings accordingly.  Once again FANTASTIC upload & FANTASTIC job on the other torrent above this one under ""mac games"" for the crack. ;)  Gotta go the game awaits :D"
