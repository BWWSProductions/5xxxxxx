originally published by CDV who wrecked the game by messing with the code

Xplosiv releases bargain bin games with no copyprotection (except original online keys)

For it's time it was a good game but the incorrect insertion of copy protection
and changes by CDV caused the game to crash frequently and become unstable.

The original devolpers couldn't patch the game directly anymore because it was nothing
like the source because of the changes and had to trust CDV to release the patch.

This and several other things like no dedicated servers where the downfall of this game.
