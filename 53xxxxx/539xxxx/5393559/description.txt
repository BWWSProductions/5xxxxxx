A man finds a book with a face on it (which looks a lot like the "Necronomicon" from the Evil Dead, but shorter). After making out with his ladyfriend, the guy reads a spell from the book. The spell has the effect of changing the woman into a demonic zombie. She tries to kille the man, but he manages to kill her instead. She rises out of the grave as a full-fledged zombie, and does him in. Later, a group of friends head out to the countryside where that cursed house happens to be. They plan to have some fun. The single woman follows a female spirit when she sees that old house. A crazy man/wizard shows up and tries to warn them. The young people decide to stay at the house, and soon they find the book and all hell breaks loose. A number of the characters either become demonically-possessed zombies or full zombies.
