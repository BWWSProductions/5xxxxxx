Movie warning

""When Soldiers Cry"" Worst movie I have ever watched (only made it thru the first 10 minutes).
Supposed to be set in Vietnam but looks like it was filmed in the woods back of my house. Really bad acting.
This movie is an embarrassment to anyone who served in Vietnam.
One guy is walking around with just a helmet liner.
Another with two pistol belts criss crossed around his chest, nothing attached to them. Another with camo netting for a hat.
One guy had a post Vietnam camo uniform.
U.S soldier supposed to be a tunnel rat is running around wearing a V.C. straw hat, guess he was really looking to get shot at.
