TPB welcomes all the n00bs and newbies. Please take your time to learn about false positives, use some reputed av scanners (NOT the free online av scanners, since the suck), and use Sandboxie.

If still you think a torrent is suspicious then please report it at the correct place:
For reporting bad or suspicious torrents:

[V],RobbingHood,2010-02-28T23:49Z,Extra note: Also read torrent descriptions to check if any av scan results can be found there.

[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-05T00:49Z,"@mentor_1

Wow, all I can say is thanks. :) However, my girlfriend doesn't agree with you, but who cares. :D"
,carambolapreta,2010-04-06T02:57Z,doesnÂ´t work for win 7 64  only shows virus notifications all the time
,roddilite,2010-04-07T06:19Z,thanks mate. 
,MangyCheshire,2010-04-08T02:30Z,"Call me a noob if you want, hardly would surprise me.. but I just scanned it with NIS 2010 as you claimed you had and it picked up infostealer.gampass and a various trojan horse off the installer itself. Unless Norton picks up every installer of Revo Uninstaller Pro as a Trojan Horse, something doesn't add up. Not buying the false positive line, found another torrent of a higher version that works just fine, no virus warnings. Will be enjoying that one. The rest of you... you have been warned. Repeatedly."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-08T18:14Z,"@MangyCheshire 

Too bad I can't post a brain cause obviously you need one."
,the_one_one,2010-04-16T22:43Z,Grrrrr.  Patch works fine on XP but I see no way to patch on Windows 7.
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-17T02:01Z,"@the_one_one 

The patch does work on W7. Did you try running the patch as administrator by right-clicking on it and choosing ""Run as Admin""? "
,the_one_one,2010-04-19T03:22Z,"@RobingHood
I'm administrator.  
I could patch in W7 running in safe mode."
,chrono150,2010-04-19T05:42Z,"@MangyCheshire 

you failed just by saying NIS... Not only does Norton suck beyond belief, it pics up almost everything as a ""virus"" and you have to PAY for it. If you can afford Norton, then stop complaining about torrents and go buy the stuff."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-21T18:39Z,"@chrono150 

Norton their av virus database is as good or bad as any other av software, but their other features are known as excellent. Also their latest versions use less memory as before."
,nazooer,2010-05-09T04:42Z,"When i extracted, my Norton 360 detected something and a trojan. Download at your own risk."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-16T01:27Z,"@nazooer 

Instead of posting stupid comments you should spend your time to do some learnings about false positives."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-16T01:28Z,"And BTW: Also learn to read torrent descriptions and comments, cause apparently you can use it."
