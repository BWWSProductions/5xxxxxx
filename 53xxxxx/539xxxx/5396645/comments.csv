,daba_1,2010-02-27T15:41Z,"Born August 21, 1974, in Scotland, country singer and songwriter Johnny Reid came to call Canada home, and there established himself as a prominent up-and-comer in the genre within just a few years of turning pro. His sound, a mĂŠlange of North American country & western and traditional Celtic instrumentation, melded well on his debut, Born to Roll. Born to Roll was a Top 20 hit, and earned Reid a number of award nominations, resulting in three wins, including Single of the Year and Rising Star of the Year at the 2006 Canadian Country Music Awards. Reid released album number two, Kicking Stones, in 2007, and the album was just as big a statement as his first. In 2008, his talents and Kicking Stones earned Reid a nomination at that year's Juno Awards ceremony. "
