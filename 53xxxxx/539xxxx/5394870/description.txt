These are some very rare to find recordings of young Alfred Brendel for Vox Company.
The Sonatas Nos.30&32 were recorded at 1961 and No.31 at 1959.
This a rip from a copy I made from the original disk, borrowed from a friend, so there are no scans.

Enjoy!


Edit:
In the sonata No.31 the order of the files is the inverse of that in the description. Sorry for that!
