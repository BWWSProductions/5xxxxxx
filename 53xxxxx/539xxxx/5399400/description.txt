Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977)
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076327/

This film has gained historic value, being one of Richard Gere's very first in a major part as a bipolar, crazy sex-athlete - two years before 'American Gigolo'. But it is really Diane Keaton's film. Based on the novel from 1975 by Judith Rossner, which provoked much discussion, because a woman back then was not supposed to lead a double life as a precious school teacher during the day and a bar-cruiser at night.

Also noteworthy for being one of the very first films with Tom Berenger, here as a naked gay transvestite, perhaps regretted later in his career of action films.

WARNING: Much nudity and sex, and the plot starts off with harsh social realism until Gere's interesting character enters after 44 minutes.
Amazon has promised a proper DVD edition for a long time. Until then, we have so far had only bad VHS fullscreen rips, but I found this old TV rip in my collection and tried to doctor it a little. Much better than VHS, but still not full DVD quality. Colors are a little faded, and sound level a little low.

Widescreen TV-rip XviD 2-pass 672x368, original mono sound AC3.
Runs well in both my standalone DivX players.

P.S.: Richard Gere said in an interview that his personal life at this time was very far from the sex-athlete characters he plays in this film and 'American Gigolo'. He played a character with bipolar disorder again in 'Mr. Jones' (1993).
