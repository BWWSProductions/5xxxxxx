The quality vote here should be for TECHNICAL quality, and not for whether or not you LIKE the film. The liking kan be voted on Imdb. After all, you have to have SEEN a film to know if you liked it."

Your characterization of its quality seems quite accurate and having something very watchable available when no DVD has yet been released is really swell! Thanks again."
