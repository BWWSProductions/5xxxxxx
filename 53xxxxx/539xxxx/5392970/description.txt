I have huge collection of Hindi and English songs and for your Cell phone i have
selected these songs very carefully from my huge music library which i know you will 
like definitely when you listen to these numbers from cell phone while traveling or 
just want to listen good music. 

Iam a fan of internet radio over the internet i listen to a channel called
DI fm its a Electrohouse music channel which does webcast at 96Kbps Mp3 and
if isay about audio quality at this bit rate its almost awesome so by keeping
this fact in my mind i decided to re encoded these music files I have re encoded 
these songs to a bit rate which fits suitable for both audio quality and 
storage capacity of your phone i have encoded English songs to 
(96 Kbps (CBR) constant bit rate) earlier these were (320kbps VBR) and Hindi songs 
to 128kbps(CBR) these were (320kbps (VBR) variable bit rate). nad one more thing i have
added album art to alu art in which you will see Music Mix


I will be seeding these files between 9pm - 7am Indian standard time coz 8am to 8pm
i spend my time at office.



so download and enjoy these lovely songs on your cell phone and pls dont forget to 
seed so that others can download to while iam nt seeding.
