President Obama is making a last stab at obtaining some kind of meaningful health care reform legislation by holding a televised bipartisan all-day â€œHealth Summitâ€ today.  Before a single word was spoken, Republicans  â€“ lead by Turd Blossom Karl Rove - were already calling it a PR stunt and accusing the President of making false claims.  So much for bipartisanship or compromise.  Or â€“ where it concerns Rove -even the slightest sense of ethical or moral behavior.

The forum began on shaky ground with Senator Lamar Alexander (R/TN) virtually demanding that the Democrats renounce their right to use the budget procedure known as â€œreconciliationâ€ to pass the legislation with 51 votes.  Harry Reid quickly retorted that reconciliation was used by the Republicans to force through Bushâ€™s nation-wrecking tax cuts, so there was no way the Democrats were relinquishing that mechanism. If only Reid had been as adamant for a public option . . .

It almost seems that these meetings are designed to provide a plausible argument for the politicians on both sides to use during their mid-term campaigns: â€œSee, I tried to work with the other side, but they wouldnâ€™t listen . . . itâ€™s not my fault nothing was accomplished . . . â€œ  So, the American people who have elected these selfish hypocrites to office will continue to suffer while they bicker like grumpy old men fighting over the last cinnamon roll at the rest home breakfast buffet.

And just for fun, this is what a warm winter Saturday in Georgia looks like, in the year of our lord 2010.
