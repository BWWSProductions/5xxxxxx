[T],jwhitt62,2010-02-26T22:05Z,"Obama was against reconciliation in 2005. That was when he was a Senator and the Dems were in the minority (Bush wanted to use reconciliation to pass judicial nominations). I agreed with Obama in 2005. I disagreed with Bush. Now...fastforward to 2010...now reconciliation is OK!?! Wow, how times change..

Oh yeah...Hillary and Biden, both Senators at the time, were opposed to reconciliation in 2005 as well.

Oh, how I long for the days when the three mentioned above were just in the Senate, and not destroying America in their current positions. (Except for Hillary, of course, B. O. has relegated her to ""Secretary of State"".)"

,sonews,2010-02-26T22:33Z,Funny you should say that.  My share ratio is normally around 90 - 100.  Just because people hit and run doesn't mean it goes by how many seeders stick around.  Get a life!
,sonews,2010-02-26T22:37Z,"Right now i'm around 50.

[T],Quazza,2010-02-27T00:54Z,"I don't understand...why is there this assumption that any kind of healthcare legislation proposed is a good thing.

They are stopping ""meaningful reform"" or whatever the buzz words are...but why is it automatically good? It's just this weird tactic by the left that saying no is a bad thing. 

Republicans suck just as much as dems nowadays, but they haven't just been saying no...they presented ideas...and obama just...well...ignored them...and basically said at the end of the meeting if you aren't with us on this bill you are against us.

That doesnt sound very presidential to me..."
