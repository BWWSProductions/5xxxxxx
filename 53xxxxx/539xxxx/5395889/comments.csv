,JulieKesone,2010-07-26T13:22Z,"When I try to open the file in 2 diff apps, it says there's an error or the file is corrupted."
,Karnage105,2010-07-30T09:12Z,"If you are having trouble Installing the Language packs, make sure you set your DVD region to 1 in your ISO program (IE Daemon tools)."
,Alohano,2010-08-01T23:52Z,I would like to request advice re this torrent.  I have downloaded it with Bittorrent but what steps are now necessary to make usable?  
,Jenova-san,2010-10-08T16:39Z,"ok guys,i dont know much about tech,so i need some help :( i downloaded this torrent but now its in a image file(iso?),but how do i get it to work? im asuming i need more than one program for that but what do i need to get it up and running?all i have is the torrent... :("
,opposenet,2011-04-14T03:24Z,"So I'm assuming if I download this that I'll have to write it to a blank DVD-R as a .ISO file right? I think I've played with this before, and it's like a DVD anyway, so that's what I'm assuming."
,bajra79,2011-05-25T02:58Z,"I can't seem to figure this out. I've got 3.4.7 installed and i've installed all the spanish levels for it. Mounted with power ISO and used activation patch. but i can't seem to get it to recognize these.  I've tried different ones, these are universal right or do i need a specific version of the program?"
,sythrian,2011-07-15T22:22Z,thanks for the content!
,Galactacy,2011-07-21T08:17Z,"If the file is a .iso you dont necessarily burn it to a cd (unless you want someone to have it too or u can just use a hard drive) you can use daemon tools to VIRTUALLY mount the .iso file hence becoming the same as a DVD or CD file from a disk.

PM for any tutorial. I'll try to help you out as simple as possible. I will also know whether a file is infected or not, even if a preposterous firewall or antivirus blocks it."
,lucas_kelly,2011-07-24T04:23Z,This doesn't work. The ISO's are not recognised by Rosetta Stone 3. 
,lucas_kelly,2011-07-24T04:42Z,"If you cant get it to recognise the ISO try changing the drive letter in DEAMON tools, that worked for me.  "
,Mtnias,2011-07-25T04:20Z,".iso is the file extension for CDs and DVDs. To run this you have 2 options:
1. Burn the .iso straight onto a CD/DVD. This way you will have a physical copy of the file.
2. Get some mounting software, e.g. Daemontools, MagicISO etc (both can be found on here of course!) and create a virtual drive. This means there is no need for burning anything as once the .iso is mounted using one of the aforementioned tools your computer thinks that there is a disc in your new disc drive :)
As for a license key, I see someone mentioned a crack in the comments. Just search on here and I'm sure you will find one!  "
,Mtnias,2011-07-25T04:22Z,"oh and if you cannot get the .iso to mount properly, try changing the region with your mounting tool of choice.
If you opted for burning a disc, something like AnyDVD is a nice piece of software that lets you use a disc from any region.
Hope I helped!"
,sanitysama,2012-04-20T13:41Z,this software is a lot more trouble than it's worth. these images aren't recognized by rosetta at all. don't bother. go use anki or kanjidamage or something.
