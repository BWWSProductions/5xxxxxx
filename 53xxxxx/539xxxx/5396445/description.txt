In return, he would receive a high amount of money and a clear passport. Toorop joins Aurora and her guardian Sister Rebeka and they cross the dangerous Russia chased mercenaries that also want Aurora. Along their journey, Toorop discovers that Aurora has special abilities and once in New York, they see on the news that the Noelite Convent has been just bombed.
