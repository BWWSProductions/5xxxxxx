,kabaljoker23,2010-03-13T15:19Z,"One more question. How to uninstall this release?
Thanks for the up...hope I get it up and working"
,dxk,2010-03-26T14:51Z,Works perfectly. Is there any way to patch it?
,amon87,2010-04-11T19:38Z,"for me, it doesn't work. after extraction, nothing happens after opening loader. just 'crash report'. gonna download normal version."
,Tolian94,2010-04-22T21:31Z,Convert with Globe converter and then open loader morron..
,Anonym1,2010-05-03T23:59Z,"Ran using Loader.exe but the game drops me after a few seconds while loading a campaign because of Steam/LIVE authentication error. In other words, completely unplayable."
,Sinister181,2010-05-05T10:27Z,"It doesn't fucking work!! A few minutes into loading the game, it says ""a sign in change has occurred"". And then it goes back to the main screen. Creating an offline account doesn't work either. Is there any way to fix this, like a crack or something? Either way, thanks for the useless upload. I spent hours downloading this, and those are hours of my life I'll never get back."
,Sinister181,2010-05-05T12:06Z,"Ok, after trying everything, I finally got this game to work. I just renamed the folder to ""DoW2"", and moved it to C:\ . I'm not sure if this is the default install directory, but now the game works perfect OFFLINE. Also, I'm not sure if the firewall had anything to do with it either."
,Anonym1,2010-05-06T23:27Z,"Thanks Sinister181, it worked after I renamed the folder holding Loader.exe, but I didn't have to move it to another drive.

I think the original path:

Drive:/PC Âť WARHAMMER 40000 - DAWN OF WAR 2 v1.1.3 Full Game directplay by globe@\PC Âť WARHAMMER 40000 - DAWN OF WAR 2 v1.1.3 Full Game directplay by globe@

Was too long, so it just has to be shortened."
,Plague.Jester,2010-05-21T12:27Z,"Alright... so... don't DL this.  I'm not sure what it is, but it isn't the game, and whatever it /is/, it's big.  Probably not good.  I mean... if it weren't bad, why would the uploader lie about what the hell this is?"
,siegfrid,2010-05-22T14:50Z,"@Plague.Jester

if you're not sure on what you're talking about don't bother saying anything since you're only making a fool out of yourself, it IS the Dawn of War 2 game if you ever tried to install it, which likely you NEVER even tried to download or install in the first place, I can say this since i just downloaded this fucked up game 3 days ago and I've playing it since.

Anyhow back to my MAIN rant.....

It works and it has too many fuck-ups if you ever played it like you have to rename the god damn Main folder to DoW2 for it to work or it wont load the main game.... other than that you CANNOT, I repeat, CANNOT quit the game with ALT+F4 or you will loose your god damn save game and it will corrupt your save and you cannot load it no more, It happened to me twice already lost my level 12 & 17 save game..... god damn....

*face-palm*"
,faikwan,2010-05-25T00:02Z,"Eh. I installed the ARC File Software, and shortened the name to DoW2, but to no avail the Loader still produces a crash report.

Vista, x86. 
Help anyone?"
,siegfrid,2010-05-27T14:48Z,"Read the instructions included in the torrent.

1  -  Extract the arc file in the main folder of the file

2  -  Move the extracted folder to the desktop

3  -  Open the extracted folder and go to the GameAssets folder
    and run the Globe Converter.exe

    - read the console information and wait for it to finish

4  - Go to the front of the game folder and run the Loader.exe

5  - Rename the Folder Containing all the files to ""DoW2""

*OPTIONAL*
I'd highly recommend patching this game from v1.2 till v1.5 version since the current version may crash and fuck-up your save game, like what happened to me, keep in mind that if you close the game with Alt+F4, CTRL+ALT+DEL, or any other means on the existing version that is on the torrent, you WILL loose your save game.

6  - Download the necessary patches from http://dawnofwar.filefront.com/file/Dawn_of_War_v141_Full_Patch;51040"

just keep em coming globe :D"
,nikromants,2011-04-24T23:21Z,"i need a fucking help. I extracted the file with ""freeware FREEARC"" as says here, than i take it to desktop the extracted folder, and now im stuck at point 3. at the place where i have to go in GameAssets folder and start some kinda ""Globe Converter"" which i never heard of it before, and there isn't such *.exe file anyway , just Data/Movies (and those folders are empty) and i can't find anywhere to download the Globe Converter , as i said before, it doesn't exists, can't find anywhere, i think my head is gonna blow up, im taking with this shit almost 3 - 4h just to understand the fucking instruction, why just can't be some kinda DVDrip or SKIDROW or any other popular cracking teams, only one witch i found in TPB is ""Dawn of War 2"" original, others are ""Dawn of War"" or  full place with ""Dawn of War Retribution"" and some DLC's . Some shit, at least make some normal instruction, where to get the ""globe converter "" if can't find it anywhere, i tried something with the same FREEARC but nothing, how others can even play it ? where the fuck did they got fucking non-existing Globe Converter ?"
,nikromants,2011-04-24T23:37Z,"I can say that this torrent isn't downloadable, maybe it works, but instruction sucks, witch is important part of the ""download and install"" part, too many shits have to do just to get it work properly, too much time it takes and you end up with no result anyway, so no use of this thing anyway, if someone knows what is Globe converter...than show me where to download it and what it does, i know that you will say that the name describes ,it converts, but how does it looks like ? some youtube trials or something, i never heard of it till now, still this torrent isn't downloadable."
