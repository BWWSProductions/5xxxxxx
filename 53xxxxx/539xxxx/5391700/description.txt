AV Scan results of RevoUninPro.2.2.1_Patch.exe (Size = 291 kB):
***************************************************************

1- avast! identifies RevoUninPro.2.2.1_Patch.exe as a threat:
   > Riskname: Win32/Malware-gen
   > Risktype: Trojan

2- Kaspersky identifies RevoUninPro.2.2.1_Patch.exe as a threat:
   > Riskname: Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Delf.eom
   > Risktype: Trojan program

3- Norton identifies RevoUninPro.2.2.1_Patch.exe as a threat: 
   > Riskname: Trojan Horse
   > Risktype: Virus

4- Avira: Clean.


The av scan results are from February 25, 2010.

The av scan results of avast, Kaspersky, and Norton are false positives due to 
some used binaries and cryptors. (Or maybe the sigs of the patch are also added 
to their virus database.) So just stay cool ... or don't use this!!!


Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!

> Intimidated by the AV Scan results & scary names??? Then simply don't try this! <

Revo Uninstaller Pro - innovative and powerful uninstall utility!

Revo Uninstaller helps to uninstall/remove unwanted programs installed on your

faster and more powerful alternative to "Windows Add or Remove Programs" applet!



Revo Uninstaller Pro has very powerful features to uninstall and remove programs:

Scanning for leftovers after uninstall 
With its advanced and fast algorithm, Revo Uninstaller analyzes an applicationâ€™s 
data before uninstall and scans after you uninstall an application. After the 
programâ€™s regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, 
folders and registry keys that are usually left over on your computer. Even if 
you have a broken installation, Revo Uninstaller scans for an applicationâ€™s data 
on your hard disk drives and in the Windows registry and shows all found files, 
folders and registry keys so you can delete them.

Forced Uninstall 
Uninstall even already uninstalled programs. This feature allows you to remove 
leftovers of programs that are already uninstalled, incomplete installations 
and uninstall remnants of programs!

Real-Time Installation Monitor 
Revo Uninstaller Pro has real-time program installation monitoring. It detects 
system changes during installation, so you can undone them later.

folders. It also creates full registry backup each time you uninstall a program.

With its unique "Hunter mode", Revo Uninstaller offers you some simple, easy to 
use, but effective and powerful approaches to manage (uninstall, stop, delete, 
disable from auto starting) and to get information about your installed and/or 
running programs.

Main features of Revo Uninstaller Pro:

Uninstaller
The Uninstaller tool lists the installed programs and components for all and 
current user. With a choice of views, as well as a context menu, information on 
program components is available: program properties, their registry entries and 
links to manufacturer's web site, for a start. The "Search" option finds installed 
applications just by typing the first few letters of their name. Revo Uninstaller 
scans before and after an uninstallation to find all files, folders and registry 
keys left behind by the program's uninstaller. The primary feature of Revo 
Uninstaller is Hunter Mode.

Forced Uninstall
Revo Uninstaller Pro has a very powerful feature called Forced Uninstall. This 
feature allows you to remove leftovers of programs that are already uninstalled, 
incomplete installations and uninstall remnants of programs! It does not matter 
if the program, you want to remove, is not listed in Revo Uninstaller Pro or in
Windows Add/Remove Programs Control Panel applet. Forced Uninstall gives power to 
the user but still keeps the safety and the accuracy of the results.

Real-Time Installation Monitor
Revo Uninstaller Pro has a feature that allows monitoring of installation of a 
program and detects system changes during that installation. The process is done 
in real time â€“ simultaneously!
This feature is very powerful because by monitoring system changes during the 
installation, we eliminate all the scanning algorithms when we need to uninstall 
that program and nevertheless we can still use these algorithms but in another 
feature called Forced Uninstall.

Multi-Level Backup System
Revo Uninstaller Pro creates backups of removed registry keys, values, files and 
folders. Backup Manager is the main part of that system. It helps you to manage 
backup information stored by Revo Uninstaller Pro after deletion registry entries,
files and folders. The other levels of the backup system are: 
- Creating system restore point before each uninstall
- Full Registry backup before each uninstall
- Full Registry backup once each day Revo Uninstaller Pro is stared

Hunter Mode
This is a special, innovative feature of Revo uninstaller which indeed  has two 
sub modes â€“ Hunter mode and Drag and drop mode. These modes are giving you a 
flexibility to uninstall applications with one click (stop or delete) by simply 
dragging and dropping program icons to the Hunter icon or selecting their icon 
with the mouse cursor, whether it's on the desktop, quick launch toolbar, in the 
system tray or the program's window is open.

Junk Files Cleaner
Junk Files Cleaner allows you to find and remove various types of junk and 
unnecessary files from your computer. Junk files are created by many of the 
Windows applications. Normally, such files are deleted by the application that 
created them as soon as they do not need them, but they may remain permanently 
on your hard drive if there is an unexpected termination of the parent application,
a system crash, etc. Cleaning junk temporary files will free a lot of hard disk 
space. 

Windows Tools
There are a lot of handy and useful tools and components bundled with every 
Windows operating system. Unfortunately, some have complex command line options 
and others are just plain difficult to access. The Revo Uninstaller feature 
Windows Tools gives fast, one-click access to more than ten Windows utilities 
used in daily PC management. Available tools are: System Restore, Network 
Diagnostics, Network Information, Security Center, System Properties, System 
Information, TCP/IP Netstat Command, On-Screen Keyboard, Disk Defragmenter, 
Services, Shared Folders, Group Policy.

Autorun Manager
Auto Run Manager allows you to manage programs which load automatically at Windows 
startup. With this tool you can not only enable or disable applications from auto 
starting at Windows startup, but you can also get more detailed information about 
them, e.g. the programâ€™s publisher, description, launch path (where it is saved on
your computer), status of the application (if itâ€™s running or not) and more. 
Stopping programs from automatically starting will increase the speed of loading 
your Windows.

Browsers Cleaner
Your browser records detailed record of every web site youâ€™ve ever visited. Itâ€™s 
easily accessible from your browser window and by simply pressing a button, anyone 
can see where youâ€™ve been browsing on the web! Revo Uninstaller erases web site 
history of web browsers including Firefox, Internet Explorer, Netscape and Opera. 
With Browsers Cleaner you can also delete temporary internet files which include 
all the images youâ€™ve viewed, all the online videos youâ€™ve watched and all the 
web pages youâ€™ve visited. Deleting temporary internet files will free up a lot of 
valuable hard disk space on your computer.

MS Office Cleaner
MS Office Cleaner allows you to remove history of most recently used files in 
MS Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint and Front Page. If you do not want somebody 
else to see your last opened or edited spreadsheets, documents or other files 
created using MS Office just select those you do not want and click Clear. 
Your most recently used files will no more be listed.

Windows Cleaner
Microsoft Windows keeps tracks of many things that you do with your computer like 
file search history when you search for file and folders; recently opened document 
history; open/save history used in standard open/save dialogs from different 
applications installed on your computer; start menu clicks history; last opened 
registry key history and more. 

Evidence Remover
Deleting your files and folders does not mean that they are gone forever. When 
you empty  Windows Recycle Bin your files and folders are just marked as deleted 
but they are not erased physically. There is a chance to recover deleted data from
10 years or older PC and this data may be very important and confidential. 
With any recovery tool or un-delete program you can easily get back your important 
documents and other files that you have deleted. And here comes Evidence Remove 
tool of Revo Uninstaller.

Unrecoverable Delete
If you want securely delete file or folder and want to be sure that no body with 
any tool could recover these files or folders use Unrecoverable Delete. Deleting 
files and emptying Windows Recycle Bin does not mean that these files are gone 
forever. They are still on your Hard Disk Drive or other storage but marked as 
deleted. Any body with a tool available free or commercial could recover deleted 
data very easily. Unrecoverable Delete tool of Revo Uninstaller tool makes it 
impossible to recover your deleted data - even with the most advanced & expensive 
tools on the market.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security 
2- Avira AntiVir Premium 
3- avast! Pro Antivirus
4- Kaspersky Antivirus  

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
                                         
* Status torrent at February 25, 2010 - 00.30 CET: clean, tested & working.
