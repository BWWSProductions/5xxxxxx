Make sure that nothing of Revo is not running. If you're on Vista or WT then try running the patch as admin (right-click on the oatch and choose ""Run as Admin"".

Otherwise try reinstalling Revo and run the patch before running Revo."

TPB welcomes all the n00bs and newbies. Please take your time to learn about false positives, use some reputed av scanners (NOT the free online av scanners, since the suck), and use Sandboxie.

If still you think a torrent is suspicious then please report it at the correct place:
For reporting bad or suspicious torrents: 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29 

Extra note: Also read torrent descriptions to check if any av scan results can be found there. "
