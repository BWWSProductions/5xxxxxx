,redmetoc,2010-10-17T18:11Z,"Although this is a VOB video and a larger size than the AVI version, this torrent was a much faster DL since there were more seeds available.  I was able to DL the AVI version so there's one more seed for that version but to ensure you get a version of this pretty darn good fly tying vid, DL both and delete the one you want to get rid of.

The vid plays just fine and is 2 hours long.  The jazz guitar riffs in the background are being played by Mr. Skp Morris himself, as shown by a shrt scene near the end.......unless he's the world's best air guitarist.

BTW, Skp Morris does tie a number of flies from his most excellent fly tying book of the same name.  A great combination and I recommend you buy the book."
