,CthePalmrose,2010-02-26T12:15Z,"Thanx extremezone for the upload....

For the rest of you, some of you guys who have rated sound quality must have some kind of super ears.

The sound is definitely not a 9 or 9,5. It's more like 6-7, but absolutely watchable if you can stand flickering sound, at some point the guns sounded like rapid clicking.

V = in other hand is more like 9.

Other than that, I must personally say that the movie had some really cheesy parts that pretty much made you want to pull out a gun and shot the motherfucking screen. So for that part, for being a Luc Besson movie, don't have to high hopes. "

,AkaPhsyco,2010-03-01T11:44Z,"Hey MPAA you ever heard of innovation? 

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding. 

Thanks for your time and enjoy your content.

,stormy1,2010-06-05T00:37Z,"this is a great movie. One problem I do have. I tried to play in nero and it sucked, but it played beautifully in Windows media player. It's usually the other way around for me. Thank you for the  upload, great job."
,max2562,2010-06-27T21:57Z,"Movie was better than I expected. There were many instances when things would typically go south and they didn't. They could have made this movie much more in depth as far as the story goes. 

V=8
A=7
M=9

The audio wasn't really horrible but the quality just wasn't there. At some points it would sound almost as if the bite rate went lower than 100kbs. Overall not bad at all considering it was free. However, you only watch a movie with quality this low when you really want to watch it. After you seen it you should wait will you can get a better version or even DVD-R. 

I recommend downloading this mainly because of the speed and quality combo make it ridiculous to pass up. "

,CainUAC23,2010-10-17T01:10Z,"video is great quality, but audio sounds like it was recorded with a cheap ($20) microphone.  anything with high frequencies is watery sounding. IE: shoot outs, singing, and so on.  Dialog is fine, bass doesn't come through at all for me.

gonna get the BD rip."

,madkid22,2011-01-08T00:08Z,"Decent quality - could have been better though. Movie itself was awesome! The audio seemed to like to randomly skip sometimes, but that is probably because I put all my movies on an external USB hard drive."
