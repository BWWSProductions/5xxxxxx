Advantages
Advantages
Encryption and randomization for your security
Byte differences - Everyones GRLDR won't be byte for byte the same
Profile matchups - SLIC, certificate and serial that best suits your system
Arguments - Can be used to pre-activate your OS
Uses custom error checking on near every function making the application much more reliable instead of spitting out files and failing
Frankenbuild checking
Integrity checking with useful info on screen so the user can verify it
External Keys.ini support for all OS versions
External file support for both SLIC's and certificates
Newer GRLDR versions before other applications, thus a greater chance of a successful activation

In short this is now the only application based loader or loader period that has encryption and some randomization going on to help protect you from MS. And on top of that it's using a much newer GRLDR with some bug's fixed

What makes this different from every other loader out at the moment?
It's not a batch file and all commands are made within the application, it has great error handling and doesn't try to find the active partition based on size (which every other loader is doing at the moment).

Whats the differences between each loader option?
Hover your mouse over each option to see

Ok so how do I run it?
Select the brand that best suits your system, if the brand isn't there don't worry as you can pick any and it should still work. All you have to do next is click the blue "Install" button and wait for the completed message.

I activated Windows 7 and now I want to activate Windows Vista, why isn't it working?
Use the uninstall option while on Windows 7 and reboot into Windows Vista. Next install your selected cert/slic in Windows Vista and then reboot back to Windows 7 and click install.

Activation failed, now what?
Try again with the beta or the older loader option enabled, one of them might just work for you.

** I have tested this on a virtual machine with a 100% success rate **

1.6.5 -- Added activation checking for Windows 7, Vista and Server 2008
1.6.5 -- Added tokens checking for Windows 7 (alerts the user, repair is manual so that later on down the line this loader will never frankenbuild your system itself!)

1.6.8 -- Added application integrity checking. This is a new feature which will display you with information about how the application was launched when the mouse is hovered over the green or red icon.
It's goal is to inform you if you are running an untouched version of the application or one that could have been modified in some way by a script kiddie. Of course green is the best result, if it's red then be cautious as someone's likely binded a trojan!
1.6.9 -- Added amber as a color to the application integrity checking as well as a few tweaks to the existing code (you should still always check the displayed application path even when green)

Extra information

Do I need to update?
If you have installed a version and you're activated then you shouldn't need to update. If however you are like me and you like to use the latest and the best versions of software then updating shouldn't be a problem.

Can I install a newer version over an older version?
Yes, you don't need to perform an uninstall to upgrade to a newer version.
