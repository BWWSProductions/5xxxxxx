About this video::::

This is an advertisement video that must have been released around the FIFA World Cup in 2002. I had seen Britney Spears wallpaper from this video that time. Now this video was present in my computer for a long time, for years... 2 days back I decided to delete or replace all MPEG-I or VCD format English Video Songs in my computer with AVI files or just delete them. I also encountered this video and thought to share it with the world. You might have seen this video earlier, since its just an advertisement. 

This advertisement features Enrique, Beyonce, Britney Spears etc.


thanks
