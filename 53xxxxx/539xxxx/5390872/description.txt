Finally it's here! After weeks of delay due to personal reasons I finally managed to finish my latest themed mix. This one should speak for itself; I hope you like it!

Was listening to my Beatles collection the past couple weeks so I thought it would be a fitting theme for my latest mix. Mix, edits, etc were done in a single take. My best yet......what do you think?

Enjoy!
