Aniruddha Bhattacharyyaâ€™s Box No. 1313 focuses on a middle class Bengali couple who land up in trouble while trying to find a good match for their only son, an anchor in a candid camera TV reality-show called MURGI. They often look for their prospective daughter-in-law among their son's numerous girlfriends. But being convinced that they are "just friends", the boy's parents get engrossed in traditional bride hunting after publishing an advertisement in the matrimonial column in a leading news- daily under â€˜Box No. 1313â€™.

In the course of this journey they meet strange people like a fraud matchmaker who claims to be the king of Shundi (a famous character from the Satyajit Ray classic Gupi Gayen Bagha Bayen). Later the couple is entrapped by this man and his gang of girls.

They also encounter "Bhai", a hooligan in a suburban town, who thinks heâ€™s "Munna Bhai, MBBS" but is actually a beast is in love with a beauty with whom the couple wants to negotiate their son's marriage.

On the other hand, their son meets a pleasant young girl, the employee of a private airline who wants to settle abroad. She promises to stay in the country if the boy wins in a game of "10 questions" that bring an amusing twist in the tale.

Box No. 1313 punctuates serious moments with comic animations and juxtaposes real life situations with reality game shows.
