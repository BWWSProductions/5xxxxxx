Cryptome is back up now."

2 billion crazy people believe in jesus, only 5 million believe in aliens, so let me ask you this, when there's riots in the streets, do you really think your good Christian neighbors aren't going to be the first ones to bash your brain in."
,7bongo7,2010-09-15T22:30Z,What a shit! I don't believe a single page of that. In my opinion they keep track of everything and save it for ever (not just for a period as this stupid pdf wan't us to believe). I mean if you could have all that info why delete it? You run out of storage? Microsoft ?  Haha! Very funny ! This pdf is 99% propaganda
