Global Criminal Compliance Handbook
U.S. Domestic Version March 2008


From www.geekosystem.com:

"Cryptome, a whistleblower site that regularly leaks sensitive documents from governments and corporations, is in hot water again: this time, for publishing Microsoftâ€™s â€œGlobal Criminal Compliance Handbook,â€ a comprehensive, 22-page guide running down the surveillance services Microsoft will perform for law enforcement agencies on its various online platforms, which includes detailed instructions for IP address extraction. You can find the guide here (warning: PDF).

Microsoft has demanded that Cryptome take down the guide â€” on the grounds that it constitutes a â€œcopyrighted [work] published by Microsoft.â€ Yesterday, at 5pm, Cryptome editor John Young received a notice from his siteâ€™s host, Network Solutions, bearing a stiff ultimatum: citing the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA), Network Solutions told him that unless he takes the â€œcopyrighted materialâ€ down, they will â€œdisable [his] websiteâ€ on Thursday, February 25, 2010.

So far, Young refuses to budge."
