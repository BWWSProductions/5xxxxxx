 In Chicago, Sam Phelan and his wife Leslie are facing financial problems to pay their mortgage after 
 a period of unemployment. While driving his old Buick below an overpass, Sam sees a wallet falling 
 down on the hood and he finds that there are more than six hundred thousand dollars inside. Sam and
 Leslie quit their job; pay their mortgage; buy a Land Rover; and refurnish their house. Meanwhile
 a British criminal (Pyke Kubic) arrives from London to visit his brother Reeve Kubic in jail. He 
 tells his brother that he had thrown the stolen money away to destroy the evidences of the heist 
 but he had seen a Caucasian in an old car getting the wallet. Pyke chases and finds Sam and partially
 retrieves the money, but more than seventy-four thousand dollars have been spent by the greedy couple
 and Pyke wants them to refund the amount in five days.
