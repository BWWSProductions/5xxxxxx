PRELUDE TO THE CROSSOVER EVENT OF THE CENTURY! Meet FORTRESS, the exciting new character created by WHILCE PORTACIO for IMAGE UNITED! He's trapped in a suit that gives him seemingly limitless power that he can barely control, which leads to a confrontation with the Image Universe's favorite cop: Savage Dragon!

Thanks to Minutemen for an excellent scan.
