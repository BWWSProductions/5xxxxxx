Isn't there some way to get pirate bay to keep macheetu from spaming these with his questionable links?"

Movie= 4
is it just me or did the black guy's character was a fucking rat, 2 face son of a bitch? who was suppose to be a hero? what was the point of the movie????
I mean he would have been a hero if he didnt go along from beginning, but once you go you are as guilty, as the rest. if not more for not being a decent person and betraying your friends.
I am saying all this cuz i hope no one takes the wrong lesson home, which is ""lie to your friends, and betray them and act like a hero"". complete garbage."
,highlander777,2010-07-06T14:59Z,"bancapitalism,

I saw similar comments like yours on imdb.
First, he made it clear that he would go along with the robbery if no one got hurt. Well, the homeless guy got hurt. Secondly, there's a world of difference between the crimes of robbery and murder. You can always make more money. You can't come back from the dead. 

You have to draw the line somewhere. So I understand why he backed out.

That being said. I thought the script was badly
written. And badly mis-cast. I didn't care for the guy either.
