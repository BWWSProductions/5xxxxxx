,kikawsum,2011-06-19T22:59Z,"A collection of low quality shit rips from various sites. I even caught Shiny Metal Dude playing back at around 58kbps. 

If this is the pirate alternative to buying music, I'll just shell out the money thank you very much."
,gfobe,2011-06-27T07:00Z,"Don't even bother guys, the songs worth listening to are all around 60 kbps. I think I'd rather just buy everything like kikawasum said."
,nark0z,2011-11-08T00:50Z,"I should have read the comments prior to downloading this. Low quality (below 100 kbps).

But thanks anyway."
