,Zelgon,2010-02-25T21:35Z,Will this work on pirated copies of borderlands? or just the legal versions?
,Treekodar,2010-02-25T21:48Z,"@Zelgon. While I don't know, I seriously doubt it."
,Treekodar,2010-02-25T21:48Z,It should only work if you have a legal version of the game.
,cat_fish_1,2010-02-25T22:06Z,OMG!! crack for this and its heaven!
,Bertrand2,2010-02-25T22:31Z,Ty Treekodar you carry out with the 3th DLC
,Bertrand2,2010-02-25T22:39Z,"Hey one ask, the previous DLC need a cr4ck?
or Has it cr4cked ?"
,stryker93,2010-02-26T00:24Z,"Lol... how is it I'm uploading faster than downloading? :o

I'll seed it, thanks a bunch :)

200-800KB/S Download and 1+MB/S Upload"
,Treekodar,2010-02-26T01:42Z,"@Bertrand2. There's no cracks for any of my Borderlands released, I only release the original files."
,Bertrand2,2010-02-26T02:00Z,"Treekodar, he he sry about.

I was speaking about Dr. Ned and Moxxi DLCs.

Sry"
,stryker93,2010-02-26T03:21Z,This is the playable DLC or just... what is it? Setting up now.
,Deathstryker,2010-02-26T03:23Z,This release would have been better if the zip wasn't changed to rar. That way if you get  a failed download from your browser you can still use the partial file in utorrent.
,stryker93,2010-02-26T03:37Z,"BLEH... you have to buy it... screw original files, this is a TORRENT site, we get things for free, we don't want to pay for them. Guys.... not worth the download."
,Tempa133,2010-02-26T06:36Z,Didnt u read? hahahahaha it says its for the legit copy.
,Treekodar,2010-02-26T11:24Z,"@stryker93. Yea sorry about that, but unlike other people I'd actually like developers to continue making games for the PC. Have you ever tried a FPS on a console? Yea.. It's that bad."
,Shippou120,2010-02-26T14:56Z,"I hope you realize that you've completely killed the purpose of torrenting this. If you have to go purchase a key anyway, why not just go download the DLC from the Gearbox store, instead of here? And I'd bet good money that the download would go by more quickly at Gearbox.

Frankly, the only reason I'm downloading this at all is to attempt to discover a workaround."
,Treekodar,2010-02-26T15:01Z,"@Shippou120. This torrent was uploaded for people who are experiencing horrible download speeds on the official site.

It says that in the description, ain't it crystal clear?

I myself was experiencing a download speed of 200 KB/sec where I usually download at around 2.5 MB/sec. "
,rebelpanda,2010-02-26T17:27Z,"For everyone that has a pirated copy reloaded came out with a copy of this with the new update. its not in a torrent, but its out there.

,sdnl1j2,2010-02-26T18:44Z,RELOADED released the third DLC and 1.30 crack today.
,HppyLght,2010-02-27T02:03Z,"Why would you upload this on TPB? This site is for people who don't want to pay for games, music, etc. Besides, the cracked version is already uploaded with the new patch so this is just bullshit."
,Treekodar,2010-02-27T14:19Z,"@HppyLght. Yea so quite a while ago I went to school and learned how to read, and if you knew how to read (which you obviously don't) you'd know that torrent is for people who download very slow from the original source.
And where does it say that TPB is for illegal files only?
Seems like quite a few of you people have no idea what torrenting is all about, you're just leechers looking for a way to spend less money on games and such, so that you can spend more money on penis pumps.
Sad."
,Skinkelyn,2010-02-27T14:30Z,"@HppyLght

Read the friggin' description before you call bullshit.

And btw, Pwned."
,LilLizardReaper99,2010-03-10T10:43Z,"i hav a two questions.
