Interesting theory to fix games xD"
,Phantom74,2010-02-27T01:38Z,Does not work with R4i-SDHC.  Still get ROM Error Code 4.
,vampara,2010-02-27T01:58Z,"Doesnt work on R5 dont know no error code, just starts on a black screen as the original does. (Just so you know: I just played the ace attorney miles edgeworth game on the same card. and it worked.)"
,vampara,2010-02-27T01:58Z,N5* not R5
,rrh9wg,2010-02-27T13:41Z,"This does not work on r4 nor does it work on an emu. Ace attorney works great on both, but this gives you a black screen only"
,_MAXIMUS_,2010-02-27T16:48Z,"Thanks.....

So far working on M3 DS Real with V4.7g firmware.

Will let you know if any problem come up."
,rider1411,2010-02-28T15:33Z,but there is a key piece of info to get it working on a R4 .. the softreset MUST be turned off so hit that R button so its red .. then highlight the game press a .. and immediately press y+x+a+b all the same time and hold them all down til the game displays .. i have a r4 from http://www.r4rts.cn/ with 2.6d firmware installed and have no problems getting it to run .. any other way won't work
,ctqsrtq,2010-03-03T22:38Z,"wont work with r4 (clone)
1.18 - black screen, freez
YS - error 4
so i think r4 users should wait for fix
thanks anyway"
,Kyuubi.Jinchuuriki,2010-03-09T00:47Z,"like MAXIMUS said , ""M3 DS Real with V4.7g firmware"" no problem , even the new Sonic Collection works on the M3 DS Real"". Thanks to maximus and the person who cracked the games. "
