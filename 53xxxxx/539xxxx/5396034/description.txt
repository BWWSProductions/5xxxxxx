I take no credit for making this.

tried and tested

Windows 7 crack RemoveWAT 2.2.5.Hazar  *updated from 2.2.3

Also works after  M$ KB971033 update will make your Win7 Genuine again


WORKS ON ALL EDITIONS OF 7/R2!

NOT FOR VISTA/ORIGINAL SERVER 2008!!!!

IMPROVEMENTS SINCE 1.0:
renames slmgr on x64 aswell
Works on unicode systems
silent mode with /s switch
UI tweaked slightly
No reboot neccessary
Passes WGA on X64

This is a little tool I put together to remove WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) completely from the OS, whilst still retaining 
genuine status and receiving all updates (optional aswell). You can also pass the genuine check in things like Windows Defender.
There will be no windows activation section in control panel (thanks to nononsence)
no slmgr
no nags, no prompts, nothing. WAT gone.
