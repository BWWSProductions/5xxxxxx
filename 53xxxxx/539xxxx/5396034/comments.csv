The instructions are simple:

1) Save your work and close any open programs
2) Unrar
3) Run RemoveWAT.exe AS AN ADMINISTRATOR (do not forget!)
4) Click the ""RemoveWAT"" button, then click ""OK"" to reboot."

You are a freakin genius! This works great! I have a hacked version (key is loaded on install) of 7 Ultimate and today got the dreaded ""This copy is illegal"" BS....!

,dorsman,2010-03-01T06:54Z,Just tried it on Ultimate 64 bit build 7600 and it didnt work.  I restarted and still have the messages that my copy isnt genuine.  I think I did everything right.  I ran as admin and it said it was successful but no luck.  Any help would be appreciated.

,thantos123,2010-03-02T17:58Z,"@ kolonuk

I'm in exactly the same position. I assume you've been trawling the web for a solution too, so you've probably noticed the same thing:

Nobody seems to be talking about this. 

There must be masses of people in the same position we are, and yet no one seems to be discussing the issue. No blog entries, nothing on forums - it's bizarre. 

Across the world people's machines are shutting down every two hours, and NO ONE'S TALKING ABOUT IT?

I really hope a solution is found. Sooner rather than later."
,thantos123,2010-03-02T18:26Z,"Right folks, after a little digging, I believe I've discovered a solution to the bi-hourly shutdowns on evaluation version of W7.

Google the following:

""Stop Windows 7 RC from expiring""

The first link should be a Coolbuster article with that title.

Follow the instructions in the article.

I've just applied the fix - I'll post an update here in an hour and a half or so (7pm GMT) to let everyone know if it's worked.

*crosses fingers*"
,thantos123,2010-03-02T20:19Z,"Sorry to say it guys, but the Coolbuster fix didn't work for me. Some people seem to be having some success with it, so try it out - it might work for you.

Right now I've just set back my computer's clock as a stop-gap solution."

,TheNewNinja,2010-03-02T22:56Z,Thanks. Worked perfectly for my Windows 7 Ultimate x64.
,thee_dr_zero,2010-03-03T04:28Z,"this seemed to do 'something' (it no longer says evaluation version in the lower right corner). however my PC, which had had windows 7 beta trial version on it, was still shutting down every 2 hours.  i then switched the date to 2004 (same calender as 2010) and it stopped shutting down.

the PC seems 'different'. a little slower to respond. is there a way to reverse whatever this crack did. nothing offense to the crack (i love crack) but i think i could have just changed the calender year.

thanks!!"
,thee_dr_zero,2010-03-03T04:29Z,*no offense to...  (i hate typos)
,thee_dr_zero,2010-03-03T07:02Z,but then i have to find/download a version of windows 7 that i hope works and then reinstall my programs. that much i could handle if i knew it would all go smoothly. but i've also read that ideally i would need to delete everything on my hard drive (reformat) to do a proper 'clean install'.  i have 100+GB of pics/muzak to deal with.
,thee_dr_zero,2010-03-03T07:19Z,"i should have noted that i had the RC version of 7, which just expired on the 1st of march. i figured if i found a way to keep it from rebooting then i could just carry on like i had been. i could reload vista, enter my key, then pay $119 to upgrade to 7.  or find a version of 7 here--but they don't seem to be brimming with confidence either. so who knows. right now i don't want to risk losing a boatload of downloaded programs/pics/muzak.  unless someone can see how i'd be better off downloading and installing a version found here."
,thantos123,2010-03-03T21:47Z,"@ thee_dr_zero

Currently, the only working solution for RC users who are getting the auto-restarts is simply setting back the clock to an earlier date. 

Keep up to date on the Coolbuster site I mentioned a few posts ago. They're looking for a more effective solution at the moment."

Before I started locking things down I also had hundreds of inbound port attempts coming from a fios.washdc account.  My computer is protected by Sophos and it found no problems.

I didn't make this crack, but the guy who did has really good cred.

Thanks a lot, I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate (x64), and after 3 days of being installed it started requesting activation (wtf eh?). I searched high and low for a solution, finding only f**king a**holes who upload torrents with viruses.

Then after a whole bunch of searching - found this. Works perfectly. No more activation or request for a product key and no non-genuine warnings (haven't tested updates yet). Simple to use.

Scanned with AVG Free (not the best but meh), says 100% clean.

Again, many thanks :)"

Apparently all the versions that of build 75xx and below has the integrated two-hour restart which this crack cant resolve. 

To get around this, install the final build of 7600 or above and use this crack to remove wat. Now ur windows is genuine. No more reboot's

My copy of 7's genuine, I bought it, but I ran out of reinstalls even though I didn't go near the actual limit, and when I try to call microsoft they say they cannot help me at this time.

,1martand,2010-08-22T03:30Z,"WORKS 100% on Win 7 Professional 32 bit. Below is how I reactivated my Win 7 after the ebay key I bought got blocked-

Late 2009: I bought a Win 7 professional key off ebay & used a borrowed Win 7 Pro 32bit full version disc to do a clean install.

Aug 2010: Microsoft blocked all the keys bought off ebay because they were MSDN keys which were never meant to be sold.

After much research, I went into add/remove programs, clicked on ""show downloaded updates"" and uninstalled ""KB971033"". This is the authentication update culprit!

I then downloaded this brilliant torrent, ran the program and within 30 seconds have a fully working Windows 7 Pro again!

THANK YOU!!!!!! "
,jdguy,2010-08-22T06:05Z,So far I've gotta say (like everyone else) you're a freakin genius...right on! Too bad this doesn't exist for the clap...LOL!
,jdguy,2010-08-22T07:06Z,"Hey all I was wondering...If RemoveWat is successful and removes WAT (KB971033) does this mean Microsoft wont know you have a fake? 

Because I read this article (link below) that says that even if you remove WAT you're flagged and Microsoft will know because once WAT is activated (even if removed) it ""calls home"" every 90 days?

,funkyed985,2010-08-23T12:17Z,"jdguy, that's a good article. I also wonder if any computer that's ever gotten the ""not genuine"" message is flagged and calls home every 90 days regardless?

I uninstalled KB971033 but if it calls home again there must be another file that's the culprit?"
