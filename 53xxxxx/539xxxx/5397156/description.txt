Time for a little checkup on the condition of healthcare reform after yesterdayâ€™s â€œprocedure.â€  Yesterdayâ€™s healthcare summit went on for 7 and a half hours. Actually the debateâ€™s been longer than that, depending on when you say it started. You could easily say it started during the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. So, itâ€™s somewhere between 7 and a half hours and a century. In any case, itâ€™s been a long, long time. Yesterday was like a marathonâ€¦ except that a marathon has an eventual end, and the Republicans want an event in which nobody ever crosses the finish line. All of the Republicans were hiding behind printed-out stacks of the Democratic plan. What does it say for your plan, when your only plan is to show up with the other guyâ€™s plan? That was a metaphor for what was happening. By mocking the Democratsâ€™ plan, they were trying to hide the fact that they had no plan of their own. The Democrats didnâ€™t bring any copies of the Republican plan to mock. Oh, maybe thatâ€™s because there is no Republican Plan! Maybe the Democrats should have brought a post-it note with the word â€œNoâ€ written on it, and tried to hide behind that.

The Republicans stuck to their talking points, alrightâ€”so much so that they werenâ€™t so much talking points as they were chanting points.  Itâ€™s almost like the Republicans were brainwashed automatons chanting â€œstart over,â€ â€œclean sheet of paper,â€ and â€œstep by step.â€ They were like members of the Red State Army, chanting from the book of Frank Luntz. â€œStart over!â€ America needs answers, and all the Republicans can do is ask for a mulligan. â€œStart from a clean sheet of paper!â€ Odd, as far as I can tell, the Republican plan IS a clean sheet of paper. â€œStep by step!â€ Yes, the Republicans want to go â€œstep by stepâ€ on healthcareâ€¦ right off of a cliff. Finally, Republicans kept demanding that President Obama renounce the possibility of using reconciliation to pass healthcare reform. Theyâ€™re basically saying â€œWe wonâ€™t let you do it with us. Now promise you wonâ€™t do it without us.â€
