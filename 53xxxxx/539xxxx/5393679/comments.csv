,OCbeta,2010-03-03T14:13Z,"I remember seeing the first one on TV, just watched it because I was bored and it was 2am, what a great movie, this one looks like it should be great too.

Great to see the french can make great action movies, waaaay better than the Hollywood shit."
,BennyPshj,2010-03-03T22:50Z,"Thank you very much.
Loved the first one- hope this is at least half as good.

When are those French going to realize that idiot Americans don't speak the language and get with the progrom? ;)"
,Steveatron,2010-03-04T02:42Z,"@adventurjunky - It actually states in the information the audio lanuage is French? I'm confused because the Information is in English. Surely you can read English?
Oh and you spelt adventure wrong :P"
,raskit,2010-03-04T03:37Z,"ok relax people, just google the filename + ""srt"", and you will find subtitles. download the .srt file with the same name as your movie, put it in a folder along with the movie file, and presto, english subs. sometimes they're not great translations, but hey it's better than horrible dubbing."
