           After a successful mission against drug lords, the             
           efficient Captain Damien Tomaso is framed at home with         
           three kilograms of heroine planted by the police in his        
           kitchen and he is arrested. Meanwhile a group of               
           teenagers film the action of dirty agents leaded by            
           Roland from the security agency executing policemen in         
           their car and then leaving the car with the corpses in         
           the 13th District to blame the gangs and begin a civil         
           war. Behind these events, the corrupt chief of the             
           security agency Walter Gassman had received a huge amount      
           as kickback from the constructor Harriburton that has          
           interest to construct buildings in the poor area and uses      
           the situation to force the President of France to              
           authorize to nuke five towers in the district. The

           delivers the memory card to Leito meanwhile Damien calls       
           him from the precinct asking for help. The friends             
           team-up with five dangerous bosses to gather evidences to      
           prove to the president that Gassman has provoked the           
           conflict in their district.
