Alright I noticed many people want this game so here is a torrent for the game...

1. Download the file
2. Download Alcohol 120/Daemon Tools/ect (anything that can read disc images will work) 
3. Run your disc image program
4. Mount onto the vitural drive (dont ever remove it and you never have to worry about the disc)
5. Run Setup (autorun would work too)
6. Install 

If you are running Vista this might not work, windows seven it works but it takes some playing around with conversion settings, it took me a few days to figure it out... so here it is.

7. Right click the desktop icon
8. Go to Trouble Shoot Compatibility
9. Next, choose Trouble Shoot Program
10. Select the first 3 then click next
11. Select Vista Service Pack 2
12. Forget the first 2 boxes but check the next 3
13. Run the game... With these settings you might experience a slight lag with the starting video that shows the capcom logo, but other than that it runs fine.

Another note, you will notice that the voice sync with lip movement is sometimes off, sometimes not so much while other times its very off... This game does work and I have scanned it several times to ensure that this is no virus (cause there are many people that claim they have a working version but in reality it is a large virus that destroys your pc) There is a slight possibility this will work on mac, but i haven't tried yet if a Mac user does download please leave me a comment to say that this works... Also Please seed, and if you find a version of Megaman Legends 2 (non-psx emulator) please tell me... I really want one Thanks guys...
