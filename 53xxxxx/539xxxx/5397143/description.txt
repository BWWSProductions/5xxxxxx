Hello all. I made this for the car and the gym. Also, in honor of Joe Lynn Turner being on "That Metal Show" this weekend. It's a digital "recording" of the Rainbow DVD "Live at Budokan 1984." I have played with the levels slightly. From my original silver press DVD. Sounds pretty good, I think. Enjoy.
