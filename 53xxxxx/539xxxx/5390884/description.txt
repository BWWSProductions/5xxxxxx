This cd contains music from the Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom's halloween events (Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party), Disney's Pirates and Pricess Party and Dream Along With Mickey. 

In the case of the Halloween music, they actually do a pretty good job, and fans will certaily enjoy the new songs largely revolving around melodies based on 'Grim Grinning Ghots', the Haunted Mansion classic. Where music written for Disney World tends to be a little weak when compared to Disneyland, this is a pretty good cd.
