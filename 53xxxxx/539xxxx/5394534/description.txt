 I had planned to make this show about more than one topic today but on commit-
ing myself to research on this subject I found a WEALTH of evidence anecdotal
and scientific to make this worth talking about. Now there are many alternate
treatments for cancer, some based in superstition some based on logic and some
good science. 

Vitamin B17 is all over the internet in testimonials of cancer sufferers that 
have beaten the disease. Vitamin B17 has faced supression of information since
it was first seen to have a beneficial effect in the treatment of cancer.

Jason Vale, who I spoke about in the show, was told he would die from his cancer by his doctor:

He still stands by B17 even though it landed him in jail for 5 years and saw him having to
take the painful, stressful, life-threatening treatment he swore to never go through again.
Again Jason's testimony is almost typical of what you'll find all overand across the 
internet.
