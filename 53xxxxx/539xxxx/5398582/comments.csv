,stupidcanuck_19,2010-02-28T20:39Z,"hey RH and the box team love the torrents boys,
i was wondering which version of 360 you suggest since norton is now only uploading 360v4. i have 3.8.0.4.1 and it works perfect. although i dont know of any safe torrent downloads of 3.8.  Should i download ""Norton 360 v3.5.2.11 Premier Edition + NTR 2010 v2.0 [RH]"" and just use trialreset v2.6NE? 
thanks for the advice"

TPB welcomes all the n00bs and newbies. Please take your time to learn about false positives, use some reputed av scanners (NOT the free online av scanners, since the suck), and use Sandboxie.

If still you think a torrent is suspicious then please report it at the correct place:
For reporting bad or suspicious torrents: 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29 

Extra note: Also read torrent descriptions to check if any av scan results can be found there. 


BTW: Stop playing the hero unless you know what you're talking about. You already spammed a few of my torrents, and if you go on then prepare to welcome a ban."

,brianxxx,2010-03-02T23:05Z,"NTR trial resets are always going to show up as viruses because of the nature of the program - to manipulate security software. 

False positives will be the norm. If in doubt, run and test under VMWARE, then scan with 1 or 2 third party programs and look for contamination.

I actually use this reset crack to reset my programs that I run in VMWARE for testing. I own legal copies on my 'real' machines. Never have had a problem with the BOX NTR crack and I always download from trusted sources...such as RH here.

So endeth the NOOB sermon. lol"

Clean. Working. Thanks. +1

@darmax96
The on-line virus check could be useful but please consider that it's not really accurate, and if you are commenting a green skull torrent double check your entries.
You link (that's just the uncompressed rar) says nothing more that it's an hacktool (oh, really? lol)
It's not ""12 of 41 files infected"" but 12 out of 41 av engines that found ""something"" (called ""HackerTool/Autorun"" or ""unclassifiedmalware"" etc).
I submitted the unpacked .exe and http://www.virustotal.com/it/analisis/550d8d40aae4b6d427bd76ededd14e6832d69bee6d7870d20f93944e1ce179f0-1268613723
---""Riskware.TrialReset.Norton!IK"", or ""	HackerTool/Autorun"" and the most esaurient of all: ""	not-a-virus.TrialReset.Norton""
Then I checked with Kaspersky and Norton (already installed), and a-squared. It's clean.

@All
Clean & Working."

Add mynortonaccount.com and www.mynortonaccount.com to your Hosts file. Norton will remove this change and detect it as a threat (as seen in the ""history"" section of the program. Just exclude and restore and you are all good to go! :D "
