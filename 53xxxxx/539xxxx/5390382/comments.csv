,stonestar,2010-02-24T23:54Z,any chance you could upload the source? seems there is no high quality rip easily available.
,Ziibby,2010-02-25T00:15Z,thank uuuuu!!!

This is not the place to be pushing your agenda.
You've broken the first and second rules.
Please go."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-25T01:52Z,"@stonestar: Nope, I'll need 15 hours to upload the source.

Beside, my re-encodes are highest quality possible. Be smart, please. When you ask some perfect stranger for help, to be indulging looks like one logical step."
,the_shroud,2010-02-25T01:58Z,but lilars.... it seems he had brought in a pretty large crowd. I've never d/loaded anything so fast....other than when I was traveling to UK.
,the_shroud,2010-02-25T02:00Z,EoD took me ages though. Just completed Ep5 an hour ago after 3 days of d/loading.
[T],mdprosser,2010-02-25T02:24Z,omg thank you so much!!!!!!!  i've been waiting for this forever!!!!  damages is like krakk i need it to survive!!! lol  j/k you saved me 1.99... i almost bought it from itunes!!!  :)  thanks again!!!  you rock!!!
,lilars26,2010-02-25T02:31Z,"@the_shroud  I guess it really wasn't my place
to say anything.but sometimes my fingers have
a mind of their own.This torrent got a lot of traffic.
EoD-1 more to go.I think you and mrhinter will be happy to be done with it.I'm surprised that
more Brits' didn't pick up on it.
Have a good one."
,DLeon13,2010-02-25T04:46Z,Thank you very much! I'll continue seeding. You rock!
,believenu,2010-02-25T04:52Z,"ok, I am new to this download- upload world however it appears that I agree with your written comments about sharing  and not replacing what you have enjoyed courtesy of whoever uploaded it. and there is a new ring in hell for all you people who are not sharing... seed as long as possible.. I have a pentium 4 with only between 3 and 5 gib free space and I can manage a 2:1 ratio at the very least and I am sure others can manage more than that depending on the space available.. regarding the other notes on this torrent most is klingon to me but I will and shall learn and hopefully understand more of what you are talking about here. However THANK YOU for the upload. I will seed.. I have used your uploads before and will in the future.Gosh longest comment I ever made. and no politics. 
 Any chance of explaining to us new pirates how most of these 1 hr shows are aprox 350mib and yours are 142.94? "
,lilars26,2010-02-25T14:32Z,"@believenu
