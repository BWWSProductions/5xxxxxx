I have downloaded many torrents of Whale Wars S02E02.  They all stop playing around 2:07.

I found a program called DivFix, which is supposedly able to repair problematic avi files.

It did the job, and the file is now playable.  I support the cause, so am publishing my first torrent so others can see this episode.

So, I wanted to give credit to GNARLY who seemed to put out the original (although broken) file, and to the developer(s) of DivFix.
