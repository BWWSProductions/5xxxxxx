,RobertoGonzales,2010-02-26T14:09Z,I don't see why someone would download this torrent when there is non-RAR version available. What is the point of these RAR files? Why can't you just upload the single AVI file? -1 for uploading another pointless RAR torrent!
,RobertoGonzales,2010-02-28T06:27Z,"What do you mean the file is at its ""cleanest""? I have downloaded RAR torrents before and they are no better in quality to normal AVI torrents. Don't bother with this torrent Pat, it has only 30 seeders. Just download the other AVI version which has over 1,000 seeders. Clearly nobody likes these RAR torrents. I'm still waiting for someone to give me a good reason why some people still upload them. They're pointless to me!"
