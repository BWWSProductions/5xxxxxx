Description...................: The favorite ski resort of President Putin, Krasnaya Polyana is an almost unknown powder paradise but
                                that may soon change. Nearby Sochi, on July 4, won the bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics, and Krasnaya
                                Polyana will host the alpine skiing events. This episode looks at both Sochi and Krasnaya, looks at 
                                what some locals think about the prospect of their mountain hosting the Olympics and does some soul-searching
                                about the pros and cons of that event coming to this region.
