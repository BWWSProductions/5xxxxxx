  A newscaster for the Channel 7 Eyewitness News complains about how God has
  only made his life a total waste. Well, Bruce Nolan, played by Jim Carrey,
  gets that chance after he freaks out on live TV, is fired and is offered
  a new job by an unknown place. He meets God and is given all the powers
  of God. At first he loves it. He can do anything but when he discovers 
  others in Buffalo who are praying, he learns that maybe this job of being
  God isn't really that easy.
