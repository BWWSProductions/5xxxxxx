,daba_1,2010-02-25T16:41Z,"Jim Foster and Vern Wills, both natives of British Columbia, began playing together as teens. Wills later moved to New York and joined the Walkers, but returned to Canada after his work visa expired. Fosterchild finally coalesced in 1976 with Foster and Wills both on guitar and vocals, Barry Boothman on bass, drummer Gerry Wand and keyboard player Peter Sweetzir. The band signed with CBS the following year. Released were two national hit singles, ""Until We Meet Again"" and ""I Need Somebody Tonight,"" but those were the band's only charting songs. Albums included Fosterchild (1977), Troubled Child (1978) and On the Prowl (1980). "
