Turin Breaks rediscover their acoustic folk sound on their fifth 
studio album 'Outbursts'. The London based duo follow up 'Dark On 
Fire' with a return to the sound that graced critically acclaimed 
debut 'The Optimist LP' while retaining the pop sensibility of their 
top 5 hit 'Painkiller'. Fresh from working on albums with Take That, 
Dido and Lisa Mitchell, these sought after singer-songwriters set upon 
their own creation of melancholic and wistful songs. The single 'The 
Sea Of Change' is included.
