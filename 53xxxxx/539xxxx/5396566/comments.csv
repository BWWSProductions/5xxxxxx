[V],twentyforty,2010-02-27T09:05Z,"@rrmerlin51D: I hope that you meant something totally different. Do you know that in old Hebrew language haven't  been present at all signs for the numbers (that's why we use Arabic signs for numbers in all living languages)? OK? In absence, old Hebrews used letters to depict some numbers - so, for three sixes it resembles as WWW (pretty close to today's letters). Funny, isn't? 

@honeybunny28: I always put addic7ed subs in the torrent if they are available. THEY ARE ALREADY HERE, from elder, both En and EnHI. So, check the torrent before the comment and - I really appreciate your work honeybunny, as all others from addic7ed site."
