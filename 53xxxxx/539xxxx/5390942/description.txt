Lights is the debut studio album by English singerâ€“songwriter Ellie Goulding. It is set to be released in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2010.

Goulding worked with producers Starsmith and Fraser T. Smith. The majority of the album was recorded in Starsmith's bedroom in Bromley, London. Goulding explained that the album "is made up of songs that all started on a guitar over a period of about two years. A number of the songs vent romantic victories and failures."
