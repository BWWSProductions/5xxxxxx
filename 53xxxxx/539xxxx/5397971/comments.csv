However, the audio is out of sync and it makes it difficult to watch/listen. For those that don't know how do the following to get the audio synchronised:

1.  Download and install 'Avidemux'.
http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/
2. Open the movie file in Avidemux.
3. Now look to the left side of the Avidemux window. You will see, in bold, 'Video' and 'Audio' with drop-down selection boxes.
4. Make sure 'Video' is set to 'copy'. Make sure 'Audio' is set to 'copy'.
5. At the bottom of that 'Audio' section you will see a check-box for 'Shift:'.
6. Check the box and enter the value for the shift as -200 (negative/minus two-hundred).
7. Now select menu item: File\Save\Save Video... (or just keyboard Ctrl+S)
8. Enter a name for the video and Okay the save.

That's it audio will now be in sync with the video. Sounds complicated but only takes a few seconds to do the whole thing.

Hope this helps. Thanks again, theArchit3kt"
