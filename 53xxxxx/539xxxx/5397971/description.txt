Message from the Director
This film is largely based on Thomas Ferguson's book Golden Rule. Many people appear in it, but it is based primarily on a 5 hour interview I conducted with Ferguson (with the help of 2 fellowand on numerous appearances & interviews with Noam Chomsky. The film offers an in depth look at the influence of money in politics--analyzing social forces and events that the mainstream media and scholarship have largely distorted or kept hidden. It also analyzes the meaning of democracy.
