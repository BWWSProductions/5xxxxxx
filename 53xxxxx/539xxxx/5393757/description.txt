I was tired of there being no North Korean movies on the internet, and so when I found a store that sold some, I most definatly had to get one and upload. This is the only place on the internet to find this movie, and the store clerk told me its a spy movie. It is in cantinese (yes I spelt that wrong), anyways, if anyone is able to make subs for this movie into english, than I will gladly upload more North Korean movies for the world.

***** Correction, I believe it is ACTUALLY in Mandarin (which ever is the everyday language)*****

ENJOY WORLD!!!

AND PLEASE SEED!!!

REMEMBER PEOPLE, I WILL PUT UP MORE, BUT ONLY IF SOMEONE SUBS THEM AND EVERYONE SEEDS!!!
