,ncrpts,2010-05-14T16:13Z,"hey guys, i found this solution on a forum to put the game in english :

Download the english demo and install. go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Kalypso\MudTV Demo\data\localization\
Copy the folder named EN.

Than paste the folder in your original folder:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Kalypso\MudTV\data\localization

or if you got steam game:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\m.u.d. tv\data\localization (not sure, but i think this is the location.)


edit C:\Program Files (x86)\Kalypso\MudTV\default-config.cfg in notepad. if steam, use the steam location.

change line: Misc.language = de
to:
Misc.language = en
save en exit.

Enjoy!


this looks to work so far, but the audio of campaign intro ""movies"" could be in german after mission 2"
