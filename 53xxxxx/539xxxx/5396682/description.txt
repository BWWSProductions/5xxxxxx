I've downloaded a lot of techno torrents and most of the time I end up deleting about 95% of the songs I've downloaded...Because they're shit

Of the remaining 5% I've taken a few of my favorite songs over the years and stuck them all together for you.

This torrent is a collaboration of Electro, Trance, Club Remixes, A select few Drum n' Bass songs and a little hardstyle; and a few songs from some Vancouver DJs who haven't released any of their music yet.

I love songs that stay in your head for days, songs that can shake you awake and rip you away from a dull eyed monotonous mind state. Songs that evoke something within you.

And if it doesn't do that I can guarantee it's catchy - you'll find something you like; You'll find yourself repeating it in your head to the beat of your footsteps unexpectedly.

Anyways, I hope this gets some interest and some love.
Please seed at at least a 2:1 ratio.
