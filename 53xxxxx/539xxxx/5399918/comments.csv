,cheatscrater,2010-07-28T22:07Z,"Hey thanks for this file, I seeded and it works very nicely. I have this one request for you, can you do toy story 3 exactly like this when it comes out? Since I have toy story 1 and 2 br rip .x264 I would apreciate if get the third one too"
,shasha2333,2010-10-15T02:44Z,"Nice, and good thinking with the AC3 384kbps, I almost didn't get it at first when I saw the AAC 160kbps. I would recommend having just the AC3 you use even more space by having the poor AAC quality present. And it played via my bluray player's usb via usb disk. Didn't at first but just had to rename the extension to .mp4 if anyone else is trying to do the same. good work."
,shasha2333,2010-10-15T02:46Z,"oh crap this is 2 not toy story 3, cancelling download :?"
