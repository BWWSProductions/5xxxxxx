Splinterheads tells the story of Justin Frost, a slacker whose life is
turned upside down when a traveling carnival rolls in to town for the
summer, bringing with it an outrageous crew of carnival workers, who
call themselves 'splinterheads' and earn a living by hustling an endless
stream of townies out of their hard-earned cash. When Justin begins to
fall for one of them, a striking, street-smart con-artist named Galaxy,
he finds that there are a few people in his life complicating his pursuit
of his dream girl: a love-sick police sergeant who happens to be his mom's
ex-boyfriend, his 116-year-old grandfather who is the newly minted
"World's Oldest Living Man," his best friend and current employer Wayne
Chung, and Galaxy's insanely jealous, belligerent carnie boyfriend Reggie.
