Little Sabine has spent her childhood in an orphanage after her parents died in a car accident.  When one of the women in charge at the orphanage, Edith, leaves to have a baby, Sabine runs away, because Edith was the only adult there she could trust.  She then wanders through the city to find someone to take her in.  She meets a lot of people on her journey, but she seems out of place everywhere she goes until, at last, she realizes that there is a special place where she belongs.
