Synopsis
Having once lived in the same house as young children, Caroline and Robby meet 

again at summer camp years later.  Now 15-years-old, a relationship begins to 

build between the two old friends, but there are many obstacles getting in the 

way of their love.  The other camp counselors disapprove of the love affair 

between Caroline and Robby and try everything to keep them apart.  At camp, 

their regiment is strict and the camp directorâ€™s only interest is in keeping 

his campers in tip-top shape through serious exercise routines, and leaving no 

time for the youngsters to get acquainted.  The campers choose to perform a 

play, Romeo and Juliet, and it is soon discovered that Caroline has 

competition for Robbyâ€™s love after he is chosen for the role of Romeo.
