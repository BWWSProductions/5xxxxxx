[T],jonnoel1,2010-02-28T02:04Z,"check your connection, i've been seeding this torrent for days.....OTHERS need to seed it too for faster uploads, but most people on here dont have the common courtesy to seed a little while after a download."
[T],jonnoel1,2010-02-28T02:08Z,Shows I'm seeding this one at 95-100kbps 
[T],jonnoel1,2010-02-28T21:30Z,"you can put a cap on your upload speed, or maybe delete the trackers and use peers sharing only. Sometimes using peers only will make it upload faster. Try downloading 1 episode at a time so your speed doesnt split....."
