Wikipedia - I Amâ€¦ Sasha Fierce is the third studio album by American R&B and pop singer BeyoncÃ© Knowles, released November 8, 2008 on Columbia Records. The double album introduces her alter-ego "Sasha Fierce". I Am... Sasha Fierce was also released as a deluxe edition, and later an accompanying remix album with videography, a platinum edition, and a re-release to celebrate one year since the album's first release. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 482,000 copies in its first week. Upon its release, I Am... Sasha Fierce received generally mixed to positive reviews from most music critics. It spawned five worldwide singles and earned Knowles five Grammy Awards at the 52nd Grammy Awards. To date, the album has sold over six million copies worldwide.

Amazon.co.uk Review By Danny McKenna - The latest outing from former Destiny's Child starlet BeyoncÃ© is an intentionally schizophrenic affair. Splitting herself into two separate characters--herself and alter ego Sasha Fierce--is the artist's way of presenting what she obviously sees as an artistic duality. The first set, I Am..., is intended give a glimpse beneath the surface of her usual R&B-pop persona. Featuring recent single â€œIf I Was a Boy", the soaring â€œHalo", and ballads like â€œDisappear", and â€œAve Maria", it seems her â€œreal" self is way more saccharine than the lady that brought us sassy pop moments like â€œCrazy in Love" and â€œBaby Boy". That side of her personality comes rushing back out on Sasha Fierce, a more rousing collection that kicks off with the infectious handclaps of â€œSingle Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", ventures into Euro-dance territory with â€œRadio", and gets surprisingly risque with the voyeuristic â€œVideo Phone". Which part of the album you enjoy most will depend on your musical proclivities, but the new, bifurcated BeyoncÃ© ensures there's enough diversity to satisfy the most demanding pop aficionado.
