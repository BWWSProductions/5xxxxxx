,ronibob,2010-02-25T21:16Z,How the heck a we supposed to understand it  with chinese  language and chinese subtitles?
,brendaleyland,2010-02-25T21:34Z,"You are informed that it is chinese in both Spoken and texted languages. This may not work for you, but for the chinese out there it will be a treat. So leave it for them and move on to something that you can enjoy? easy eh?"
,teladoy,2010-02-27T20:20Z,"Th pirate bay is not a private english speaking website chinese have the right to have movies in their own speaking forms.
What I do in this case is dowload and wait for subtitle that way when they come up you got the movie
no reason for nationalistic remark, this is probably the last free place in the world"

,aradilon,2010-02-28T12:34Z,"Could all be true but chineese isn't a common language on the rest of the world, at least load the subtitles with them and not be stupid about it."
,fffd,2010-02-28T16:10Z,"Don`t be so stupid. It`s great that someone uploads chineese movies we most likely wouldn`t get, so don`t cry about subs.. Search the internet yourself or ask in a polite manor.. Oh, how I dislike rednecks who can`t behave..  

And again, thanks for the great upload DaSoChaShan.. Keep it up.. "

why should those that dont speak chinese care if someones out there uploading chinese vids?!

it would be great if it did have english subs ...that way the whole frakking world could watch it

no one cried ...and ur a fuktard for thinking someone pointing out a lack of eng subs is a redneck!

thanks for your efforts dasochashan - it would be great if we did have some eng subs though~ "
,evapilot,2010-03-01T01:30Z,"so...there's no english subs then?  well, at least chinese language only speakers who are deaf can enjoy the movie.  if anybody finds an english srt or something, plz post it here or make it known somehow"
,kolosus2,2010-03-01T15:09Z,"@ aradilon

What do you mean Chinese is not a common language? More people speak Cantonese (Chinese) than any other language on earth!

But yes. I do agree. There should be English subs, and I'm sure there's gonna be soon."
,skely,2010-03-01T18:05Z,"Thanks for the upload... tho i cant do much without an eng sub, gues well have to wait for it."
,pogsnet,2010-03-02T03:40Z,"English subtitle not yet available. Confucius says ""Learn Chinese or go to hell"" ^_^"
,fffd,2010-03-02T17:36Z,"The funny ppl who uses hatorade doesn`t understand that you have to make subtitles, so it is obvious that the movie comes first, than you can request subtitles.. Most of the uploaders here doesn`t have piracy as the main income, it`s a side project.. So be glad of the rip even though YOU can`t watch it, some 1.3 billion chineese might?!"
,Torvik88,2010-03-02T21:13Z,"Can anyone post a link with the subtitles pls? :)
Thank you"

Thanks, too bad no subs yet. :)"
