  When the world is ruled by apes, one particular group discovers a mysterious
  rectangular monolith near their home, which imparts upon them the knowledge
  of tool use, and enables them to evolve into people. A similar monolith is
  discovered on the moon, and it is determined to have come from an area near
  Jupiter. Astronaut Dave Bowman, along with four companions, sets off for 
  Jupiter on a spaceship controlled by HAL 9000, a revolutionary computer 
  system that is every bit humankind's equal--and perhaps its superior. When
  HAL endangers the crew's lives for the sake of the mission, Bowman will have
  to first overcome the computer, then travel to the birthplace of the monolith.
