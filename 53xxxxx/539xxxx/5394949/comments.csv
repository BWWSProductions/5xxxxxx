,rincewind3,2012-07-11T00:02Z,"Aaaggh! The ONE seed that was there disappeared at about 70%.  Now I'm stuck at 99.6% with the other 31 Peers!  Someone PLEASE seed, I'll do the same as long as I can after it's done!"
,rincewind3,2012-07-20T01:23Z,"...and 9 days later, no change! Still at 99.6%, now up to 32 peers and no seeds.  Every now and then it appears that there is one seed out there (though I'm not connected to them).  I'm always hopeful that someone else will get the whole file from them and then seed long enough for another etc until I can get it all and seed too. Sadly it seems I'll have to give up."
