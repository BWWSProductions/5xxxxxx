Thx a lot!"
,rippervanwinkle,2011-05-05T10:58Z,"Thank you.  I recently bought the UK DVD of this, a supposedly restored edition.  It wasn't cheap, it looks like shit, sounds like shit and has hard coded subs and overall is a complete abortion.  Your release  has somewhat kind of softened the blow.

This rip looks superb, sounds superb and has plain text subs within the mkv container, not hard coded.  First class release. "
