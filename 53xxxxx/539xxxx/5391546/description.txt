I've got a mildly obsessive-compulsive thing about having my music well organized, on top of a pretty obsessive love of nine inch nails.  On top of that, I love torrents.

This is my personal studio collection of NIN albums after using Magic MP3 Tagger to put all of the correct id3 tags onto the files and put them in the appropriate folders (named by halo & title) **as well as** renaming the file to reflect this id3 tag in case the tag some how gets screwed up or whatever else would have you looking at the file instead of the tag.  Also, is used mp3tag.de to append the album artwork to the files too, so there shouldn't be any mix-ups with that.  

Most of the tracks are over 128kbps but not all; there may be some mistakes here and there and some of the things in this are not official releases bug again, most are.

Hope you enjoy!  I'll try to upload this as much as possible but I live with a 4 people right now and one of them is a gamer, so I can't have it up all the time.



Enjoy!!


PS - I've included Halo 12 (Closure) in there but that should be the only video included.
