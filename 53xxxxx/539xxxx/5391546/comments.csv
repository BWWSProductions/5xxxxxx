,SysFailur,2010-04-05T03:15Z,"Major Props.  I just leanred about Magic MP3 tagger like 10 mins before opening this post.  Nice, well organized collection you have here.  By any chance did you rip these CD's yourself? If so what bitrate?  If not.. LOL.. What bitrate?"
,sorrow77,2010-04-18T20:30Z,Thanks!  I ripped several of them myself but definitely not all of them so I can't tell you for sure what the bitrate is.  I do try to keep all my downloads above 192kbps but you can't win them all!
