Thank you for the upload, thank you a whole bunch."

Brazilian editions of Star Wars comics are rare and incomplete, and many stories from different periods in time are condensed in a single monthly volume with low-quality paper.

You uploaders guys are real life-savers! I've already got this one and strongly recommend it!"
