PlayClaw is a very useful tool for almost every game player and a "must-have" tool for hardcore gamers. 

For showing off slick new tricks or proving you really can take down The Boss with one shot, nothing shows it better than video. Until PlayClaw nothing worked too good with modern games, because cutting edge games try to hog every ounce of your PC's power, leaving little available to other applications. This results in choppy video, distorted still shots or massive bitmap files.
