,Kether,2010-03-03T21:12Z,"Nevermind, I'm a dumbass. Lol. Thanks for the up!"
,Sparx10,2010-03-04T08:22Z,OMG I LOVE YOU :D been waiting for a crack for this
,elitegamernl,2010-03-07T17:57Z,"thanks dude

,elitegamernl,2010-03-07T18:01Z,"nevermind
its finished

but when ive installed it it says its
15 days Trial version :("
,Sparx10,2010-03-08T03:23Z,"@elitegamernl: your a noob :D, it works for me. it doesnt say ""15 Days Trial Version"" it says ""Cracked Version"", and it works"
,0u7law,2010-03-11T20:54Z,"once I've recorded the movie and want to watch it, i can't. i have audio but it says i dont have a video codec called TAMB. googled TAMB, but there is nothing on the net about it. :S"
,K_e_t_a_m_i_n_e,2010-03-15T00:45Z,"this works perfect, thanks!!

yes it's russian when you open it, but there is a drop-down box on the main page where you can change the language.

cheers!"
,Kether,2010-03-17T12:44Z,"@ 0u7law

Download the real version as well. That's how I got to see the video. It uses a codec called TAMB."
,l33tg33k,2010-04-04T03:23Z,Could someone upload the newest 1.9 version cracked if he/she has it?
,elitegamernl,2010-05-31T16:44Z,"l33tg33k

i would like to see that aswell

@Sparx10

actually im not a noob
for me it says now ""trial version 0 days left""
and i cant record ;)"
,ohfoohy,2010-06-27T18:53Z,"So. It worked at first, but now it won't record. It says cracked version and everything, but wont record anything.

So I guess I'll use the trial. If you want an year long trial, just set your computers date to last year."
,Spoork.bz,2010-06-30T16:24Z,"Works good, but doesn't work for old games. I still have to use Fraps to record old games that use older DirectX versions."
,thezeros,2010-07-12T12:04Z,Could someone put up PlayClaw 1.9.9 the new version works better with no lags atleast i didn\'t see any.n@0u7law: The easyest way is to not use no compression. Use low compression or high compression.
,TheOriginalDaniel,2010-10-28T07:03Z,anyone got a link for version 2.0????
,miguelsz3,2011-01-08T21:49Z,"........Worked for a while, but for some reason I cant record anymore =-="
,Kiweed,2011-01-28T14:57Z,"Awsome piece of software, its just sooooo sad that no one has cracked the new version which is MUCH BETTER! PLayClaw 2.0 build 1205 has more options like do or do not record mouse cursor =) Please someone crack the new playclaw or please get us some activation codes! PLZ PLZ PLZ! And THX!"
,DestructiveCracks,2011-03-02T20:15Z,Fraps is way much better than this shit
,Gashimahiron,2011-03-22T19:26Z,"LONG LIVE FAPS!
i mean, FRAPS!
xD
Really, nothing is like FRAPS, that program has its goods, but it still isn't good like fraps
FRAPS, THE KICKASS!
and if it lag with fraps get yourself a new pc!
i'm from brazil, a relatively poor place where a graphics card cost 2500 R$ while in any other place it cost 500$ or less...
AND I (probably)HAVE A BETTER PC THAN YOU, AND I'M POOR!
(valid for:Most europeans and USA guys that are complaining that FRAPS lags)

PS: dollars are worth about 1.20 here in brazil...
not really sure
Proof that i'm poor:why am i on the pirate bay?
!!!

xD
LOL!"
,iKhaz,2011-03-30T01:54Z,Testing now.
,robwilkie,2011-05-25T03:13Z,Thanks a lot! I pissed myself laughing when I saw it installing 'fuckyou.dll' Hahah
,IlluminatiWillFall,2011-06-14T22:43Z,Seed please. I'm not getting any feeds for some reason.
,rollzy7,2011-06-16T06:53Z,"Fraps sucks ass, i went from fraps to this and this is so much better! thanks for the upload mate"
,fleischi93,2011-08-03T18:12Z,"It says 15days trial version, how to get through that?"
,cookandmilkies,2011-08-13T05:31Z,"I installed but every time I go to record, my game crashes. Good torrent you got here..."
,thetenfold,2011-10-15T03:07Z,"Good torrent but how do I get videos to playback? I had the full trial version, then installed this and I recorded and it seemed to work but I still can't watch it."
,TheScorpionKing131,2012-01-07T19:50Z,"Thx, downloading now!
Btw: if anyone has the latest version 2.1.0 that would be greatly appreciated!!! :)"
,Kiweed,2012-01-18T11:32Z,I just uploaded Playclaw 2 with working crack people!!! Enjoy and seed ;)
,plutoto,2012-04-28T20:33Z,"can you try to make a Playclaw 3 crack?
