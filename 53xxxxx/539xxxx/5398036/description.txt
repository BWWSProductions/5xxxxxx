Our IDE streamlines and simplifies php development process. You don't need to keep in mind names of functions, arguments, tags and their attributes; methods etc - we've implemented it for you in the autocomplete feature for PHP, HTML, JavaScript and even CSS. Also, you can always get necessary help information by F1 or using special Help control.                                                     
                                                                      
Our internal PHP Debugger allows validating code locally. It automatically detects your current server settings and configures corresponding files in order you can use the Debugger.
