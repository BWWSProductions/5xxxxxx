,dekayw,2010-03-02T00:07Z,Where would I find the WAT21 crack please ?
,dcoleman,2010-03-02T20:24Z,"Currently downloading but I am seeding at Unlimited which is currently around 500kb/s to 1mb/s. 
Ill seed for a while and will update once I have ver. this copy. This would be great if this is a true copy without anyone messing with it."
,dcoleman,2010-03-02T22:04Z,"http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce	offline (timed out)

Im stuck at 91.4% with a download of 2.2kb/s and with an upload of 1.9mb/s"
,dekayw,2010-03-02T23:35Z,"Im stuck at 92.7% so I may never need to know where to get the wat21 crack ,,, ha!"
,dcoleman,2010-03-02T23:58Z,Im just a bit past you. Gotta log off for a bit but ill seed what I do have later. Hopefully I can inch to 100% soon. :p
,Coreadrin_47,2010-03-03T06:07Z,"Yes, this is untampered, straight rip of Win7 ULTI DVD, burned ISO straight to DVD.

Have 3 successful installs on 3 different systems.

I am at just under 200% upload and I am still the only seeder i see!  Anybody have a complete D/L yet?"
,dcoleman,2010-03-03T22:39Z,"I have downloaded the ISO and placed it on a DVD and then loaded it on a spare HD without placing a Key when installing. I then went stright to the Windows/Microsoft and validated the copy.
This passed no prob and then I went and ran all the updates even the KB971033 and all is good. 
I did all this just to verify if this was truley a untouched copy.
Thank you Coreadrin_47 For uploading this one.

Now everyone knows this is a clean copy of Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit."
,dcoleman,2010-03-03T22:41Z,Everyone bump this up on the Quality cause it is good to go. Who ever gave this a -1 is full of shit.....
,dekayw,2010-03-03T23:59Z,"Forgive me if I am a little green and unknowledgable in this , I have managed to get the full 100% now and am seeding, Im also a little unsure and cautious about how to procede from here , From what you describe dcoleman am I correct in understanding that I do not need any crack ? ,,,,,,,,,,, also my current operating system is vista 64bit,,,,, will this install smoothly over it without screwing things up ?,,,,,, any help is apreciated."
,Coreadrin_47,2010-03-05T05:48Z,"Just to let you guys know, I threw a bunch more trackers on this torrent so there's about 70 seeds now (sumotorrent and others).  I did a test and was pulling about 200k on this one.

Keep seeding it up!"
,calle_66,2010-03-08T06:43Z,"Alright my man! COREADRIN_47, I installed per your notes and all is working fine. I must have missunderstod something... because you said:
'when you are in Windows 7, right click on the crack .exe file' 
What crack.exe file? I never got one, only the clean ISO.... The again, initially you say: Crack is not included.... 
Do I need to get this? Let me know. Thanks for great torrent!"
,Coreadrin_47,2010-03-10T15:44Z,"you'll need to grab the WAT21 tool yourself - I just uploaded the clean ISO with nothing else included.

Installation instructions are there so you don't have to reinstall windows to use the crack - if you enter in a serial or have windows validate online before the tool it will lock your win7.

Keep seeding :)"

Enjoy."
,narco1,2010-08-01T16:30Z,"ok....so i'm trying to set up a VM...which is why DL'd this...when i want to burn ISO to disc, do i just burn the zipped file that originally comes from the torrent, or am I just missing the .iso in all those files?"
