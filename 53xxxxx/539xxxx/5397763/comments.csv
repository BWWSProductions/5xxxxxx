,dead_pirate_st3v3,2010-02-27T22:55Z,What type of 3D glasses are needed? Thanks for the up.
,rick_rick,2010-02-28T00:17Z,"Hey ""TvTeam"" pleae tell us which 3D glasses we need. Is it Red/Cyan or the ""Avatar"" style ones???  Thanx, Rick"
,decebal2003,2010-03-01T06:30Z,"No 3D with the following glasses:
-polarized
-red/cyan

Doesn't look like 3D at all"
,dead_pirate_st3v3,2010-03-03T19:16Z,"A little dissapointed, team..."
[V],wilimaw,2010-03-05T17:03Z,this is not 3D
,cheatsforme,2010-12-17T23:18Z,"So many films that have 3D in the title but arent actually 3D. This doesn't seem logical to me and if you are lucky that the film is in 3d, its usually in the crappy red/cyan ones and not stereoscopic.
Its like going back to the days that the films released wasnt actually the film in the title at all but some crappy porn movie.

STOP MISLABLING YOURE TORRENTS PLEASE AND THAT GOES TO EVERYONE. fucking wasted bandwidth yet again (straight in the bin)."
