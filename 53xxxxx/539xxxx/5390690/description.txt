My first torrent!

OST for the Playstation 3 game 'Folklore'.

This is pretty rare, it took me quite a while to find this myself. I couldn't buy or download this anywhere until I came across a link a while ago, so I thought I'd post this on here for fans of the game to save them all that trouble I had, as it is a truly underrated and beautiful soundtrack to a beautiful game.

This contains all the full soundtrack, all three of the discs included in the OST.
Details can be found here:

Enjoy!


P.S

If you would be so kind as to seed this for a bit once you are done, as I mentioned before this is pretty hard to get hold of, so you would be doing a great favour.

Thanks!
