Finally! It's done!  My third themed mix of the year.  It's been a crazy year for me which has slowed me down a bit but with new equipment and software on the horizon things are looking exciting.

I've wanted to do a Blade Runner theme mix for awhile now so here it is.  One of my favourite movies and soundtracks of all time so I hope you enjoy the tribute! As always all editing and mixing is by me completed in a single take.  Some sick tracks here.  Starts off a bit slow but quickly builds a nice beat.  

Enjoy!
