Microsoft Office 2010 is one of the best productivity experiences across the PC, phone, and browser for what you depend on today and what you'll expect tomorrow. It helps you rise to the challenge of today's business environment without losing sight of what's needed for IT success.

For your people, it means helping them work in a way that's faster, easier, and more intuitiveâ€”whether they're on the road, in the office, working solo, or as part of a team. For IT, it means utilizing a set of smart, easy-to-integrate tools in a security enhanced environment that work with what you have now, so you can grow your business instead of your budget.


RTM will be available in June, 2010.


Cheers!
