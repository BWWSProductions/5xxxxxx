Treasury of English Song [c20] (Hyperion)[FLAC][twistle]

I thought I'd upload this CD as it would follow on quite nicely from my three BjÃ¶rling torrents.  

This CD covers a selection of twentieth century songs for tenor with piano accompaniment, by many different performers brought together onto one CD.

Samplers are, by their nature, "promotional" so I've broken my no-Hyperion rule here. The Hyperion label has oodles of very good CDs from this genre - if you like this one, perhaps you may care to explore their catalogue for further gems. (although the quality of the recordings is superb, I'm not too keen on the genre so I'll not be uploading any more from it).
