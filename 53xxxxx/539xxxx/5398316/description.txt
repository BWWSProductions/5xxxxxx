Madman (aka Frank Einstein) is not your average hero.  Frank was a hitman who was killed in a car accident, then stitched back together and brought to life by a pair of mad scientists.  This resurrection leaves Frank with supernatural reflexes and a slight degree of precognitive and empathic power.  Frank doesn't remember anything about his former life and now lives as a jack-of-all-trades wanderer, accompanied by a variety of allies.
