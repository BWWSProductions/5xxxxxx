,Tricari,2010-03-02T04:33Z,It's good practice to search before creating a Torrent. I've been seeding these exact same files for over a year. Same with a few other seasons.
[T],jonnoel1,2010-03-02T06:39Z,"LOL....you actually posted a comment to hate on my torrent? Go somewhere else to spam, thanks."
[T],jonnoel1,2010-03-02T06:43Z,"As a matter of fact, I see seasons 1-4 on yours..I uploaded all 14 seasons so people who wanted them all could come to one place. Not very many seeds on your torrents if you've been seeding for a year...4?...7?  Quit being a hater."
,NishuPTG,2010-03-13T09:33Z,"hello, any1 pls seed this, thnx!"
[T],jonnoel1,2010-03-14T09:56Z,"I'll re seed it, but I cant keep it alive unless others seed it too, thats the whole purpose of re-seeding people! If you DL, keep it seeding for a little while so it stays active in the network!"
,NishuPTG,2010-03-16T20:54Z,"thanks a lot, i will seed it for sometime."
[T],jonnoel1,2010-03-16T22:37Z, yvw! ENJOY!
,Tricari,2010-08-14T03:36Z,"""Quit being a hater.""
Stop being a dick. I was first to offer up the early seasons. What's wrong, getting all pissy because you weren't first? Don't go lieing all over other people's torrents. Fine, be elitist, I'll give you the exclusivity and delete mine."
,krawnik2,2010-10-16T09:12Z,Tricari has a moist vagina! What a whiny bitch
[T],jonnoel1,2010-10-21T09:49Z,Geez...he acts like he's the only one with top gear torrents....theres so many on TPB its ridiculous.
,tony4finger,2011-01-14T11:20Z,"super cool , thx alot for this one , appreciate"
,killerwolf1313,2011-07-25T12:27Z,dude u rock.. don listen to wat de other assholes say!!
,man_made_oblivion,2011-08-07T03:59Z,Tricari seriously is one nerdy bitch. Let's cry and moan over who stole what first. Guess Tricari is why they say there is no honor amongst thieves. Thanks for the upload though. I loved the one episode i had seen from this. They had to travel through a jungle or something and they all had four wheelers and just everything went wrong. Great show. Def. will seed for a while
,man_made_oblivion,2011-08-07T04:00Z,"Out of curiousity, how do you make a torrent. I have a very wierd collection of movies and then i also have torrents from other sites that i would share with TPB but not sure how to go about it. "
,Draco1985,2012-06-15T20:51Z,"Hey buddy Down Loading this and will all season's as i love Top Gear, Will seed each season for 2 weeks after DL, Thanks for the upload very much appreciated!"
