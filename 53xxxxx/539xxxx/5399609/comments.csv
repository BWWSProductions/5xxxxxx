,kneebutt,2010-06-21T12:03Z,"Thanks to those of you who leave A/V quality reviews.  There are many of us who trawl from copy to copy, searching endlessly for comments that offer more than ""thanks hero"" or the timeless classic: ""seed please"".  Seed Please is the catch phrase of the Fuckwit - quality reviews are appreciated.  So ta."
,CentCent,2010-08-02T16:28Z,"@kneebutt

I saw what you did there. ;p"
,Video_Veg,2010-08-11T17:58Z,"Always good quality and current movies from FXG_team - Thanks yet again.
Movie was good too, with elderly Michael Caine well cast."
,the_junkman,2010-08-30T00:37Z,Best British film of the year so far. Nice to see the chav hoodie scum getting what they deserve for a change. We need to round up the anti-social underclass in the UK and exterminate them like the fucking vermin there are. Get Carter fans will love this. Stroll on Harry Brown!
,Mr.Brow,2010-09-19T22:08Z,Thanks!

,pinpirin,2010-12-13T14:31Z,Thank you for the upload. A/V quality is fine and the audio is perfectly in sync.
,Eejanaika,2011-02-05T16:25Z,"@kneebutt

It's comments like these that make me wish for a ""thumbs up"" option for comments. Well said, mate. Thing is, in an open community there will always be hit'n'runners, begging for seeds and getting the fuck out as soon as they got what they came for. It's us who can make the difference by showing that we're still here for sharing. 

As for the torrent:

A: 9
V: 8
M: 8

T: Downed at 2.0MB/s with 177 seeds in the swarm. Thanks for that. I'll keep this seeded for a while. Cheers FXG, keep up the good work."
,uglyrtard,2011-02-10T06:18Z,"@kneebutt only thing better than your comment is your name ahhaha 

ps i havent downloaded torrent yet so dont have a/v"
,cire666siuol,2011-06-05T20:16Z,"@major9211:

rename the .srt file to:
Harry Brown[2009]DvDrip[Eng]-FXG.srt

then make sure the movie and subs are both in the same folder and play it...lol...

Or the easier way, just rename both the .avi and the .srt to:
Harry Brown.avi/Harry Brown.srt

@FXG
Thanks for the up... Great movie and great quality...
