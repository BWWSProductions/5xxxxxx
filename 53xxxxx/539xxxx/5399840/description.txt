Who, or what, is The Third Kryptonian?  

This story arc is rooted in the "Back in Action" story arc, in which a villain named the Auctioneer captures people as trophies until Superman and an alliance of heroes and villains unites to stop him.  The Auctioneer discloses that he came looking for the "third Kryptonian", a comment that confuses Superman. To find out what the Auctioneer meant Superman inlists the aid of Batman to discover the truth; is there another Kryptonian on Earth?
