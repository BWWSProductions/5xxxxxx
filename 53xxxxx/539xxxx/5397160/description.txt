Lark Rise to Candleford seems to be an on-going enterprise: a soap opera so to 

speak. Season One appears to be complete. Subtitles have been written and are 

available. Not so with Seasons Two, Three, etc. Although the video of Season Two 

is done, there are not yet English subtitles available. Spanish has been 

published. As well as I can tell, Season Three has none yet. So, if one uploads 

everything up-to-now, there would be a continuing need to publish updates.


Season One (2008) had a few small problems: several of the videos were recorded

early and included a bit of channel BBC One's intro at the beginning. These were

removed. The resulting files came out a bit smaller than the others using DIVX 6.8

compression. They appear to be all right, though. The subtitles had to be adjusted

on all the videos for proper synchronization. 


Unfortunately, the whole show is not well appreciated in my household. So, there is

some doubt in my mind whether I will continue riding herd on this thing as it 

evolves.
