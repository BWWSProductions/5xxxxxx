I looked around the torrent sites and couldn't find too many high quality rips of this, one of my favorite shows.  And I don't believe any include optional subtitles.

So I ripped these for myself and thought some might want to share in the enjoyment.  The file sizes are large (550mb) because I made them to stream to my 50-inch LCD.  While the quality is high, keep in mind that the source dvd's are not the greatest.  I did do my best however to clean up the picture and these look great on my 50-inch LCD. If you don't care about space, then these are for you.  My goal was to maintain a high quality and keep the entire series under 100gb.  If you think the files are too big, please feel free to not download them.  However, I am working on the entire series.  The ripping and subtitles are a lot of work.  But if there is an interest in this torrent, I will post the other seasons as well, as they get done.
