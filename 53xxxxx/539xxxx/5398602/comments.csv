No, this is not I Pod Junk
As you can see the Format is not AVI but MKV, which has been Compresed using X264 encoder.

I would suggest that you Comment About the Quality only after seeing it, not Before"

,jorss,2010-02-28T17:00Z,"Dude, I love your work!

All your torrents are perfect and at high download speed."
[V],RiddlerA,2010-02-28T18:23Z,"@ jorss 

High Download speed is all due to the support of all the seeders who have kept the torrentz Alive & provided with Excellent Upload Speed

Thanxs Guys"
,e114612,2010-03-05T00:47Z,"This is POOR QUALITY.
I had my doubts when I saw the file sizes, but wanted to try it anyway.

I download lots of anime and most of it is 720p. For 21 minutes, the file size is 300+ megs using MKV format and and X264.

Each of these eps should be at LEAST 600 megs to emulate 720p.

Quality is definitely BELOW EXCELLENT"
[V],RiddlerA,2010-03-05T07:43Z,"@ e114612

First of all this is not poor Quality, it may not be best compared to maybe a 2 gb size episodes

Secondly search for perfect Quality never ends. Better Technologies come,you increase the size, the quality gets better  & better

My basic aim of uploading these torrentz is to provide good quality in a smaller Sizes & I can gurantee that for given size the quality is Excellent

TY for listening"
,Lovejam,2010-03-11T03:38Z,"Thank you for all 4 seasons of Dexter.
I have just watched the first and second season and am addicted.
This show is incredible and i probably wouldn't have gotten into it if it hadn't been for these very small files that were so quickly downloaded.
Much appreciated. "
,oddhis,2010-03-20T12:17Z,"Hello!

Can some one seed on this torrent plz? i am on 8.3% and i really want this torrent."
,concord24,2010-03-26T16:12Z,"thanks 
please can you upload Alice in wounderland without useing X3 player to watching it 
i dowenloaded this movie two times but i cant see it because i dont have x3player "
,ilogikalbox,2010-04-03T00:34Z,what program should i use to burn this to a dvd or what methods? i tried convertxtodvd but on all of my dvd players they say no disc 
[V],RiddlerA,2010-04-04T09:25Z,"@ above 

You will need to download ""VSO ConvertXtoDVD ( download the latest version from Google)


CONFIGURING THE SOFTWARE:

-Go to ""Settings"" and then ""General"". Select the folder you want the temp files to be in (make sure the partition has plenty of space). Check the remaining 4 options depending on your preference.

-Move on to ""Chapters"". 5 Mins is a decent length, but you can change it if you like. Uncheck ""for videos longer than"".

-Next, ""TV Format"". Select your TV format annd leave the rest as it is.

-Now go on to ""Encoding"". Leave encoding quality on High. Select the type of disk you will be using, for the last one it is best to leave it as it is.

-Now for the ""Audio"". I would prefer having the bar somewhere in the middle, don't check ""Audio Boost"".

-Finally the ""Burning"". Uncheck the third opption. For the speed I'd select somewhere from 8x - 12x. Remember, the slower the better and never use the max speed.

....and you're done."

ITS A REALLY GOOD UPLOAD.
the speed is great."
,annichka,2010-05-16T20:25Z,"This is only the second item I have downloaded using a torrent and I just wanted to say thank you. I am just figuring out how all of this works, but your entire season took a day to download whereas one episode from another person took me a week and a half. Quality is great from my computer btw. Quick question: how do I get rid of the subtitles?"
[V],RiddlerA,2010-05-20T07:47Z,"@ annichka 

Easiest way if you definately don't want subs to be there is to just remove the srt file of each episode

You can also disable the subs.
If u r using WMP than Go to --> Play option(at the top) --> lyrics, cap & Subtitles ---> Off Subtitles"
,dearghoul,2010-06-21T01:44Z,"Thanks mate, you've got a goldmine of good stuff, I'm just starting to mine! I love the high quality/wee size o' these files!"
,vilivo,2010-06-22T00:16Z,"Love the quality, love 2 get lost in translation, but one Q, know where I can get the Bird cage with Robin williams? Anyway, TX 4 the great ups!!!Keep up the great offerings."
,Iyoossaev,2010-08-28T19:59Z,"QUALITY of this release is LOW. It uses x264 codec, but is still by far worse than regular 1 GB mkv files (= 720p). This series is simply way too good to watch it in anything worse than 720.

Also, the subtitles are typographically retarded, capitalization is missing, weird line breaks appear etc."
,Unit431,2010-12-07T16:40Z,"So why don't you fuck off and download the 1GB versions instead, you whiny little cunt.

Hey, did you ever think that maybe, just maybe, there's a percentage of downloaders out there who would prefer small file sizes and are willing to overlook quality degradation in favor of quick downloads? No? That's because you're an egotistical wanker who probably gets off on the smell of his own farts.

And hey, LOW quality? The fuck are you talking about, faggot? Considering the length of each episode and the small file size, the quality is actually extremely good."
,Omerta786,2010-12-10T18:44Z,Please don't mind me asking that season 5 is almost over (2 days to go). do we have any idea when will we get it on torrents? we don't get showtime channel in our country and am getting impatient due to the reviews i am getting. :)
,hotrod666,2011-02-21T12:56Z,"tonight is the night.. awesome, season 4 rip is ur best of all, amazing hd perfect subs.thanks."
,harry0023,2011-03-04T18:57Z,"download link to the "" English Subtitles"" for this series without any syncing problem.
