Quality rip as always.
The movie?  If I've ever seen a worse movie, I've forgotten it.  
I wouldn't want to spoil it for you, as anticipation of the exciting part is all you will get from this one.  
I stole it, and I still feel like demanding my money (my time?) back!  Why would they waste time making something like this movie???"
