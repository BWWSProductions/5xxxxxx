This is Black's Law Dictionary 2nd edition and it is officially shared as public domain document. The book has been scanned and made into an html e-book with easy to navigate pages. Ignore the copyright notice because it is invalid as this is public domain and someone was trying to earn some cash by selling it when it was free. I will however leave up credit within the book for those that made into an easy to use format. Dedicated to free men and women on dry land.

Edit. I see several people Downloading already after just publishing a few min ago. I will seed for a couple of weeks but please help me seed to keep this torrent alive. Thanks.
