Paul Merton in Europe 2of6 PDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Having travelled far afield to explore China and India, Paul Merton is ready to take things easy with a relaxing trip around Europe. "But things didn't turn out quite as expected," he says. Far from gorging on sumptuous food and wine, lying on ravishing beaches and enjoying breathtaking architecture, Paul will be exploring some of the lesser-known areas of the continent.

In this installment, Paul visits an American Indian Club in the former GDR before exploring the Wunderland miniature railway in the affluent city of Hamburg. His last stop in Germany is a visit to a family who make wooden sex toys! The next leg of the journey is the Republic of Ireland, starting in the 'rebel' county of Cork. Paul meets a solicitor called Colin who dreams of competing as a female synchronised swimmer, and an Irish monk who has opened an alternative sculpture park...
