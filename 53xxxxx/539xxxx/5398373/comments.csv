But am just wondering, the movie according to imdb...is supposed to be 240min...so what happened to the 80 min missing? "
,optikus165,2010-02-28T17:00Z,Who cares about the 80 mins .. this is a pile of crap!
,CthePalmrose,2010-02-28T17:08Z,@optikus....I agree...but it's sunday afternoon and there is nothing else to do...and this is pretty much the only thing that I haven't seen...so if I can get 80min extra to waste time...that would be nice...

Thx alot Kicks."
