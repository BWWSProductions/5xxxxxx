,XoLWoX,2010-02-25T21:45Z,Will see you with another name soon KnockV3 maybe if you know what i mean ---- but by the size of your brain i dont think you know what im talking about
,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-25T22:50Z,I'm afraid the mods have stated on SuprBay that they determine Knock and LW as a 'feud' instead of harassment. However LW seems to be on the right track as of late keep it up :)
,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-25T23:01Z,"Well considering he named this R5.Line and changed his nfo to reference that it was a torrent downloaded. But you are right Knock it should be labeled the original work unless LW has tweaked it to a lower size or brightened it here or there (I doubt that though).

Like I said the mods wont do anything anytime soon LW so you have two choices.

Kneel before Knock and submit to his requests of doing this and that about torrents or keep on the track you going on and be witch hunted endlessly by him.

And FYI i'm not taking any sides here I am merely neutral :)"
,XoLWoX,2010-02-25T23:14Z,lmao kneel down -- i think ill stand on my feet thanks
,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-26T00:00Z,Kneel before Zod :O
