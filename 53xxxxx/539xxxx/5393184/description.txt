  A successful cocaine dealer, who has earned a respected place among England's
  Mafia elite, plans an early retirement from the business. However, big boss
  Jimmy Price hands down a tough assignment: find Charlotte Ryder, the missing
  rich princess daughter of Jimmy's old pal Edward, a powerful construction 
  business player and gossip papers socialite. Complicating matters are two 
  million pounds' worth of Grade A ecstasy, a brutal neo-Nazi sect and a whole
  series of double crossings. The title "LAYER CAKE" refers to the layers or 
  levels anyone in business goes through in rising to the top. What is revealed
  is a modern underworld where the rules have changed. There are no 'codes', or
  'families' and respect lasts as long as a line. Not knowing who he can trust,
  he has to use all his 'savvy', 'telling' and skills which make him one of the
  best, to escape his own. The ultimate last job, a love interest called Tammy,
  and an international drug ring threaten to draw him back into the 'cake mix'.
  But, time is running out and the penalty will endure a lifetime.
