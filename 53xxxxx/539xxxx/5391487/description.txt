"Then You Look at Me" is a theme song from the movie Bicentennial Man. It was supposed to be released as the second single from CÃ©line Dion's album All the Wayâ€¦ A Decade of Song, on December 11, 1999.

"Then You Look at Me" was written by James Horner and Will Jennings, who wrote for Dion her 1997 smash hit "My Heart Will Go On."

Unfortunately the Bicentennial Man movie, released on December 13, 1999 and starring Robin Williams, became a flop and the single was cancelled. The second reason was the fact that "That's the Way It Is" became a hit and was still strong on the singles charts around the world. However, "Then You Look at Me" was included as a B-side to the "Live (for the One I Love)," The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and "I Want You to Need Me" singles. The movie soundtrack also included the track but in slightly modified version, produced by James Horner and Simon Franglen. The version from Dion's album was produced by David Foster, Horner and Franglen.

"Then You Look at Me" music video was directed by Bille Woodruff and released at the end of 1999. It was included on CÃ©line Dion's All the Wayâ€¦ A Decade of Song & Video DVD in 2001.
