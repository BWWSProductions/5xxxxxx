,troy1969,2010-02-28T02:21Z,"Works here 2. Thx  ;-)

Anyone got ""DragThing"" and can up it? It's a gr8 app to keep your desk tidy"
,zogulusnig,2010-02-28T05:16Z,"So, the app in the main torrent worked like a charm, right ""out of the box"".  I didn't need this preference file.

It asked for a registration key the first time it was opened, by you can put - literally - any number in there, and it works.

Personally, I used ""1234"" and hit the 'register' button.  All is well, and the app says ""Registered to: ."" at the bottom of the main window.

I dunno why it says it's registered to a period, but it works just fine and doesn't ask for a key, or complain in any way.

Thanks!"
