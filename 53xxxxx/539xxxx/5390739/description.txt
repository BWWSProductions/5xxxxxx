Kaya Yuno is an 18-year old student who attends the Murota Culinary School which trains aspiring chefs on the ins and outs of the kitchen and proper Italian cooking. While at the school, Kaya exercises diligence in learning how to cook (with gainful employment in mind) but also interacts with the mostly male students in a romance simulation which is aimed at Japanese girl gamers.
