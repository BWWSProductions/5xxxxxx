,crysisftw,2011-03-16T08:39Z,"---------------HEY EVERYBODY WITH THE BLACK SCREEN PROBLEM PLEASE SEE HERE FOR THE SOLUTION-----------------

Well I found a lot on the internet and finally realized that there is NO fix for the black screen since some video file is missing from this rip. DO NOT PANIC - I got a solution:

1. Just google a save file for this game. I don't have the link right now but you should not have any trouble finding it. If you do have trouble, just let me know, I will then search for the link and post it here.

2. You will get a file named : ""GameSettings.bin"" after the download. Copy and replace this file with the one in ""BFBC2"" folder in ""My Documents"".

3. Run your game from where ever it is.

4. Once your game starts, hover your mouse to ""Single Player"". Click on ""My Campaign"". Select the second mission from the list that appears.

5. Doing this, you will continue the story exactly after the submarine part but you will miss the video.

6. Anyways, have fun and let me know if this works. Cheers!"
,crysisftw,2011-03-16T08:49Z,"Hey just missed couple of things:

1. If you still see a black screen after the troubleshooting that I just mentioned, try opening the ""settings.ini"" file in ""BFBC2"" folder in ""My Documents"" and look for a string - ""DxVersion""

2. Change its value from ""Auto"" to one of the following:
     Windows XP - 9
     Windows Vista - 10
     Windows 7 - 11
Example, if you have Windows Vista, change the value so that it looks like - ""DxVersion=10"".

3. If still you have the black screen error, then may be your computer hardware is not good enough to support this game."
