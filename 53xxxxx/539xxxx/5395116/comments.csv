,TommyBlade2018,2010-02-26T18:16Z,Thanks FXG Team
[T],MelloYello,2010-02-27T20:38Z,This doesn't have the subs for the Japanese speaking part towards the end.  Why were they taken out?  They kind of seem important to the story.
[T],MelloYello,2010-02-27T20:48Z,I downloaded the english sub title file.  I tried to open just to see if I could read what was said.  I use convertxtodvd but I don't know how to add the sub titles.
[T],MelloYello,2010-02-28T01:55Z,Well I now how to add subs now.  Have to wait and see if I did it right.  Should hardcode them.
,eddn,2010-02-28T05:16Z,"FXG, Thanks for the movies, and especially thanks for including English subs when you can.

larrybomb, did you mean 'know how'?  Why should FXG hardcode subs?  Just so you don't have to figure out how to use them?
I'm deaf, and really appreciate FXG's including them, but even I realize that not EVERYONE would want them......"

,florabot,2010-03-03T19:10Z,"er for the people who say there are no subtitles, there's an srt file included so you can just play it at the end of the movie when the guy is speaking Japanese. I cried bucketloads while watching this, gahhh"

,Go90go,2010-07-03T11:12Z,The mere mention of Hachi's story brings tears to my eyes. Everyone should be lucky enough to experience that kind of love and devotion in their lives...

,permaponics,2012-04-19T05:59Z,"This Movie is fantastic, I see a lot of movies and am never that impressed with any. I am a hard ass, your not going to make me cry. this movie struck a chord in me that no movie ever has. I have had my dog (Chow) for 12 years, so I Know the type of loyalty inherent in japan-es dogs. I don't like this type of movie either, but it was just soo good. I did cry and if your heart has a beat you will too. great acting great cast, and directing.  Highly recommended.
  Puppys are not for every one, so know this: a dog will fall in love with the first person who gives it attention, so think twice when you acquire a new dog, will you be able to care for it? feed it? be there for it everyday? Dog ownership is not something you can do half ass. Your in it for the life of the dog, if not you failed.
  Mine has gone to work with me everyday and has only been boarded twice, he has traveled over 30,000 miles with me and is by my side 100% of the time, I tell people,"" If my dog cant come too, I wont be there."" that's dog ownership. Like this dog in the movie he is highly regarded in my community. people often ask me if he is not by my side,""where's Bugs?"". my answer:"" hes right out side in the truck."". and every one knows, if hes in there you don't touch the door handle if you care about your hands and face.
 also ""shake"" ""fetch"" and ""speak"". forget about it. A mans dog needs not perform useless tasks. 
Watch this movie you'll be glad you did.    "
,dap2012,2012-04-21T07:10Z,"This movie is a really good movie. Normally, I don't cry in movies, but this movie made me cry three times. It is one of the most heart-wrenching movies that I have ever seen. It gets me every time I watch it. I would recommend this movie to anyone because everyone needs the love and the devotion that Hachi gives to his owner. FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!!! "
,bragazar1710,2012-04-23T10:47Z,thanks.
,drexlord,2012-05-27T20:28Z,I dared myself not to cry the second time I watched it but i cried then again at the third time... R.I.P Hachi
