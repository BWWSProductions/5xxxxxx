,Vincent8,2010-02-25T20:24Z,The serial doesn't work.
,Vincent8,2010-02-25T20:27Z,"Sorry it does work, forgot to put in the patch folder."
,jigar7,2010-02-25T20:57Z,"Thanx a lot buddy! Works 100%
Though I still have to disconnect from the internet while starting the game... cuz my firewall in Vista somehow fails to block it from accessing the internet. Oh well... I'm happy that somebody came up with this crack! :) :)
Will just have to play for a few days and see if the 'savegame crash' is finally fixed!"
,z3rongod,2010-02-26T03:49Z,"Crashed one time in more than 12 hours of game play. Auto-save performs good.

I think I'm going to actually purchase this game, they really deserve it."
,RomanSPQR,2010-02-27T09:24Z,"works, still have to unplug the internet cable.  Tried using windows 7 firewall advanced settings, but to no avail."
,kronos87,2010-02-28T23:30Z,did above instructions but game is saying serial is wrong. have game blocked with firewall and worked before patch update to 1.13. have copied crack file over. any ideas anyone?
,kronos87,2010-02-28T23:31Z,perhaps a different serial?
,hawkesc,2010-03-02T03:53Z,I get a broken file error using both 7zip and winRAR.
,hawkesc,2010-03-02T04:09Z,Scratch that I got it to work
,z3rongod,2010-03-02T07:30Z,"Make sure you are disconnected from the net when you enter the serial.

Also i am under windows 7 and after i got in to the game once, the next times i did not disconnect, worked without problems. Though the case might be isolated.

Also i suggest you block the port which the game uses instead of the application. Maybe download wireshark and check traffic. I'm no expert but you may find a solution this way."
,aw3some0,2010-03-03T16:13Z,"It WORKS! i also did like vincent and forgot at first to copy the ""patch"" folder"
,karossii,2010-04-10T08:43Z,Where do I find the other patches (0.4 and 0.9) ?
,Captain_Planet,2010-06-02T20:46Z,"I copied over 1.04 then 1.09, now running this and everything looks good. I couldn't move the crack over from the folder but open the rar file and moving it from there worked. However online or off(during install and all) it says wrong serial. It simply will not take it. Yes I did copy over the patch folder etc. Any ideas? I have tried every method I've used over the past several years "
,raul1794,2010-09-27T21:00Z,will this work with the vitality release.
,patthebrat,2010-11-22T09:13Z,"i cant save my game as soon as it autosaves or i try to save manuallyit crashes.

any ideas how to fix it?"
,gunmaker,2010-12-05T15:45Z,"new notice for distributers and to ALL TORRENT USERS

anti p2p organizations are now ddosing users and sending invalidated data OR VIRUSES into our torrents!!

this chocking of our extending seeding is halt !! -able!

download 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/peerblock/files/PeerBlock-Setup_v1.1_r518.exe/download

and prevent most of them from choking you, and rapidsearch for a non viral loic.exe so u can legally retaliate against them!
(ps if u do get a viraled loic.exe u can simply prune the viruses before u reboot, they sit in the main program files menu and a funny looking icon in there as well as your temp folders. simply delete them before rebooting.

THIS IS THE FUCKING PIRATE BAY! WE DONT TAKE CRAP FROM SCALLYWAGS! YARrRrR!"
,Cgoff87,2011-04-09T03:51Z,"Very good, worked well, thanks!"
