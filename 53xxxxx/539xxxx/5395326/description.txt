H O L G E R   C Z U K A Y - Two Albums (1979 + 1981) -


Movies (1979) and O.T.W.T.T.P.O.N. (1981) for many reviewers are the most impressive albums Holger Czukay has recorded in his colourful career.
As a founding member of the German "Krautrock" group Can (until 1977) he was one of the first musicians introducing techniques of sampling and sound-collages long before the first appearance of computer music.
His name also stands for pioneering terms like "Ethno" or "World Music" notably by his first solo efford "Canaxis" in 1968.
