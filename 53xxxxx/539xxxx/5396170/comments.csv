EZTV and VTV constantly miss episodes of JonStewart/Colbert. You have made my day with this. 

Please continue to upload these if it is at all humanly possible. Don't make me beg..."

You're an idiot, plain and simple."
,kave786,2010-02-27T11:58Z,"in the 5/6 years i have been downloading vtv daily & colbert shows .. vtv has missed maybe one or 2 episodes (some may be a day or 2 late, but are eventually posted) 
VTV should be thanked and appreciated!! .. 

However i would really like to thank cenkota for keeping it going when vtv missed this week .. 
EKOLB usually posts them when vtv is late, but for some reason they both mssed them this week

Much appreciated Cenkota, for not letting us miss a very important show!!
People need to be informed of the hypocracy and lies that other media simply regurgitate from these corrupt politicians and businesses!!!"
[T],Elbart,2010-02-27T15:25Z,"For the seventrillionth time, VTV/EZTV are not releasing anything.

They distribute (not making!) scene releases. When there are no scene releases of TDS/TCR, they cannot and will not distribute anything.

Is that so hard to understand?"

Too bad these won't play in most dvd players because of the resolution."
,monkybizzz,2010-03-02T23:44Z,"EZTV/VTV are great and I appreciate their work, but I really liked the extra resolution in these uploads, cenkota. If you could continue with them that would be great."
