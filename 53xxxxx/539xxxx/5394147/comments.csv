The game is working fine.
If you have problems install the file:

It worked for me!!!
This game is one of the best, if not the best i have played.

And the ending is amazing.

Again, many thanks to the uploader."

With a seeds to leechers ratio of near 1, the download speed totally sucks!
Can you all please share your bandwidth such that the torrent gets shared much faster, sooner!
That way the completed people can also help with providing additional uploading seeds!
I'm ready to put it for uploading for 2 weeks @ 2Mbps! That is 256KBytes per second!
Come on people! Please seed this! Please!
Freaky Chokra"
