,gusiskirby,2010-02-26T19:59Z,I couldn't get this to work. The archive always gets stuck at 70.2%. Why didn't you just RAR it?
,petermark222,2010-02-27T08:33Z,"me neither...
i can't run Globe converter,and for me ther aren't any RARs or Temp files...
If i try to run the game without this step,it starts and sinc and the others coming to the screen,but i can't do anything..."
,josher_09,2010-02-28T00:21Z,if you morons would follow the instructions and do as he says it would be working just follow it step by step and if the mp3 file plays without wait for like 30 minutes(or lil less like 20 min depending) means you did something wrong
,biada,2010-03-07T00:27Z,"fake torrent.  All it is, is a 7gb file that plays the sonic intro menu.  That's about it.  No game play, no start menu..  Just intro and then it freezes. 

You can stare at the screen and read Sonic All-Star Racing.  That's about it.  Don't download, waste of time "
,biada,2010-03-07T01:22Z,"Ignore my comments.  After running the global.exe file, waited a few minutes, and EVERYTHING IS RUNNING FINE.

Great torrent.  And yes, I'm an idiot. "
,AboulSAM,2010-03-07T14:44Z,is this game worth downloading ?
,Wackoweasel,2010-03-19T16:38Z,"The game doesn't run for me. I ran Globe Converter.exe, and after the MP3 sounded, I tried running the game. It showed me an error saying it couldn't find d3dx9_42.dll. I downloaded the DLL, then it asked for another DLL(X3DAudio1_6.dll). After I got both, the game still didn't run. It opens up to a black screen, then it closes and says the program stopped working. I am on Windows 7 Professional 64-bit."
,fatguy1990,2010-03-20T05:06Z,hey biada how did u fix ur problem because i got the same prob as u

,ThePokemonMaster,2010-05-19T20:46Z,I thought this game would be under 100mb.
,Streidominating,2010-05-20T15:47Z,There would be no reason why a trusted member would upload fakes... this is working 500% - for average people and above
,Streidominating,2010-05-20T15:48Z,"sry for double post

,deepak_rokz,2010-05-29T17:40Z,"PLZZZ can sum1 help me i am having same problem as   Wackoweasel

,Sandywichsboy,2010-06-06T12:14Z,"I have followed the instructions to the letter, and the game works, but the config.exe does not work at all, meaning I can't configure my game controller. And i refuse to play the game with the keyboard.

Looks like I'm off to donbwload the iso elsewhere on this site."
,djdsp,2010-06-07T09:53Z,"Guys Please Dont Be Stupid

,mrcr0wley,2010-10-28T20:09Z,"Not debating whether it is working but what the hell is it doing for 20 minutes while you are waiting for Globe Converter.exe to do its stuff???
Some kind of visual progress would have been useful."
