,rlhq23,2010-06-24T17:57Z,"Thank you very much, Secret Myth. To everyone- the audio and video quality are great. In addition to that, the collection is incredibly well organized (in comparison to other torrents). It contains all the subtitles you could need, including english subs for the non-english speaking parts only. Includes sample and cover as well. I'll seeding this brilliant collection for quite some time :)"
,rlhq23,2010-06-24T18:01Z,"Oh, and the file plays as is on the Playstation 3 as well. However, no subtitles are attached so you'll have to run it through mkvmerge to turn it into an MKV file, then through MKV2VOB to attach the subtitle and mux it into an MT2S file. Only takes about 6 or 8 minutes though."

I've spent days messing with subtitles, and I've given up. I'd just like to find a copy with subs already on the movie, can anyone who has downloaded this torrent please tell me if it is worth my time to download this. If so I promise I will seed. Thanks"

,bychance,2011-04-10T03:49Z,"To start off with, I'm pissed off because there was only 3 1/2 glasses of wine in the bottle ( I
 was hoping for four). Anyhow , I downloaded
 the torrent and selected only the first movie to
 download. All files downloaded over night. I've
 never had it so good. Thanks S. M. and
 seeders. I've burned #1 to DVD using
 Convertextodvd 4  (thanks again ChattChitto
 RG). The results are fantastic. My only gripe
 is that the english subtitles for non-english parts are missing, outside of the Sicillian part
 of the movie and as a non-Italian speaker I am lost. They are are not there for the full english subtitles either, all other english subs.
 are there. Other than that minor inconvenience, I appreciate this excellent
 upload. "
