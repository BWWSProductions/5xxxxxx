When I started posting these series back in 2007, the majority of songs in the mixes were in fact rare, not anymore though. Bloggers and other internet heroes are blanketing what once was considered obscure. Add to this some labels that are doing an awesome job remastering older stuff. In any event another mix of these series would still be a treat to a few people out there. Remember, best way to thank the uploader is seeding as long as you can.
