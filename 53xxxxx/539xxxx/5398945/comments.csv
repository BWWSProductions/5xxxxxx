,digitpress,2010-05-14T01:49Z,"Maybe the best batch of ""Rare Hits"" ever... and I'm seeding all 46 of 'em! Especially love ""The Other Ones"" and ""Major Thinkers"". I grabbed The Other Ones album from you awhile back but would love to see the Major Thinkers album on one of your future compilations. Thanks again for all the great memories and NEW old music!"

Thanks ,
