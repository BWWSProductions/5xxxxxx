Gunstar Heroes Original Sound Version
Unofficial Veriphon 2010 Remaster

This is the 25 tracks that make up the Sega Genesis game by Treasure, "Gunstar Heroes".

This is neither the MrMonkeyman rip, nor is it the version from the Gunstar Super Heroes OST CD.  This is an unofficial remaster by myself, made purely for personal enjoyment.  However I am uploading the torrent here because I feel that both of the other versions available sound poor, and I have added some sympathetic mastering, made appropriate edits and rearranged the tracklist so that it makes for a better listen as an "album".  I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, it's one of my favourite Sega Genesis soundtracks.
