A solitary, middle-aged trick-shooter meets a much deadlier kind of weapon: the femme-fatale!

The movie is set in a backstage atmosphere- seedy, poorly-lit, a place where the masks come off and the pretense of performance is shed, to be reborn as naked envy, wizened cynicism, furtive lust, and unceremonious heartbreak. It is a fairly common setting for film noir, and is brilliantly exploited here by director Anthony Mann, who is a favorite noir director from the German-expressionist school. (Click his name in the tags above to find more movies directed by him.)

Compare this movie to Gun Crazy (1950), which is also a trick-shooter femme-fatale:
