hve NX2 2.2.4 downld fom TPB and it works overall on my WIN7 X64 Ultimate.  Maybe u havent install corr. acc to info in the downld file?"
,Painter2,2010-03-15T11:55Z,"When said that about NX2 - something stranges about Camera Control. Everything installed perfect, but crack does not seem to work. It still comes up with rq for serial number!! What did i do wrong. "
,colbonman,2010-07-21T21:06Z,"Thanks for that, works perfectly with D90. Got it working by installing the program, then replace the executable file with the cracked file, and then updated with the file included in the torrent"
,ljohnl,2010-09-28T10:19Z,"works great! did what ""colbonman"" said, thanks a lot!!!"
,Jaymog,2011-04-16T19:13Z,"I have installed NX2 with no problems and my nikon D90 is recognised by my pc and all grphics programs such as lightroom and photoshop, but although camera control starts it doesn't recognise my D90. what's wrong ?? I've been trying for hours and I see you other guys have had no problems. I read on another forum you must change the usb port to ptp, is that right and how do you do it? THANKS FOR ANY HELP."
,tonanti216,2011-08-07T12:13Z,"Help! I have not been able to unpack the crack to get the serial number?  Don't usually have this problem, can you help please?
Thanks... so far as I can see this is a great download. THank you"
,tonanti216,2011-08-07T16:29Z,Figured it! Replace the Exe files !! 
,kim4444,2011-08-16T21:32Z,"Cant get it to work .. It says that the cml9.dll is missing ..

Am i doing somthing wrong ?? "
,lastmoron,2011-09-17T18:36Z,kim4444: I had the same problem. you need to run update.exe too! That will fix the problem
,lukusmukus,2011-10-05T10:33Z,"CML9.dll if missing here is a cheat that works . go to the directory where the Nikon folder lives , locate the CML8.dll - copy and past it to your desktop , rename CML8.dll to CML9.dll , then copy past the new renamed dll into where you got the CML8.dll from ."
,fridal8,2011-10-18T20:38Z,thanks lukusmukus!!
,Squeazer7,2011-12-06T00:32Z,"Works great! You just have to crack it before you update it, otherwise it wont work (thanks colboman)"
,TheNukeZ0,2011-12-15T01:54Z,"Works great.  Running WinXP (on a Mac via VMware Fusion), ran install.exe.....ran update.exe....transferred crack into installation directory and voila.  Mare sure you have your USB settings set to NOT Mass Storage, but the option on your menu and you shouldn't have any issues."
,rgw666,2012-01-23T10:56Z,"I have a old camera D40, and the NCCP2 is compatibel with this camera but it still won`t detect it. can anyone help me with this?"
