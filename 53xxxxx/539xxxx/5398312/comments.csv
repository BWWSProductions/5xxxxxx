But I have one problem.. I need to do the ""registration"" everytime I open sony vegas, why?"
,mAwezeh,2010-03-14T03:02Z,Have i done something wrong because there is no plug-ins (for example transitions) in my vegas...
,RaitoKunRyuk,2010-03-16T05:48Z,"@action_

I guess it depends on what windows version you have... as long as it works you should be fine, if not uninstall and try using the crack first, keygen second.

@mAwezeh

Uninstall SV, make sure you are installing x86 or x64 depending on your system. RUN EVERYTHING AS ADMIN, EVEN SETUP."
,Lisforlachie,2010-03-17T06:56Z,why can't i get it downloading even after i press the download button

,Raider312,2010-07-22T20:30Z,where is the second patch?
,DinisR,2010-08-10T00:28Z,"Thx man this torrent was the only one i could download the sony vegas correctly.

Just follow the steps, always open as admin. And when open the keygen select vegas 9.0 32bit and 64 bit option and then hit generate 5 times and copy the serial and activation code to somewhere, click patch and go to the destination folder where you download it. Open the sony vegas and put the serial and activation code you copied and its done!"
,IvoryMinx,2010-09-05T13:02Z,"Hi, I need help the patch does not patch AT ALL..I get DI KEYGEN ""an error has occurred while patching the file (s)!"" 

What do i need to do to fix this?"
,Jivexxx,2011-02-28T10:34Z,"I was very excited on how well Detailed and Complete this torrent was put together. I can answer all the questions here...First I had the same problems as mentioned below. But got them figured out. I WAS the Administrator, but still got the error when I patched. Then for some reason a prompt opened: it said this program might need to be used as the ADMINISTRATOR, and  asked me if I would like to open as the administrator...YES, then it WORKED. Patch Successful. Then I opened the trial (after copying the CODES to Text) then put the serial # in...and then it asks to register online to activate. i chose OTHER COMPUTER off line....Continue with my info and THEN it said it will email you with the Activation code, which you don't need the email...the KEYGEN gave it to you and was PATCHED. Use it...and PRESTO! it workes! thanks...BEST Torrent set up yet! :)"

,onyxpartitian,2011-04-09T22:12Z,never mind i got it to work
,iloveblts,2011-05-25T20:47Z,"I've followed instructions exactly, I'm running as admin, and yet every time I try to patch it I'm still getting the error. There's no secondary patch in the file. What do I do?"
,gwarsux,2011-06-17T00:11Z,"for those having troubles getting the authentication to work, follow the direction in the readme file very carefully,
 i struggled for a while until i realized you need to run the foreign crack file first, then in the keygen use vegas 8.0 codes.
 after i did that it worked like a charm :) "
,mojowoikin,2012-05-02T22:32Z,"Thanks RatioKunRyuk, this one worked for me after trying two others that didn't work. I tried to post a longer comment here with step by step clearer instructions, but for some reason it wouldn't allow the comment. 

The main thing is that you run everything as administrator and be sure your antivirus program is not blocking the execution of the program. Anvi Defender and Avira will block the Keygen, Avast won't. Malawarebytes detects two virus's but it is a false detection. I re-scanned my machine after installation and removing the Keygen to a USB, and it came up clean. Av's will detect any operation that is foreign or abnormal - exactly what a Keygen attempts to do -  so it's a matter of determining which is legit and which is not. The caveat is always user beware. However, like I say, this one worked for me and my machine is clean after installation.
