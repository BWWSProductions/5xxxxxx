    Inquisitive young viewers will laugh as they learn all about methods 
    of scientific investigation in these amusing episodes from the popular 
    animated series, including "The Rolie Polie" in which Sid discovers how 
    to use a magnifying glass. Other episodes in this anthology include "The 
    Sticker Chart," "The Whale Episode" and "Enough with Seashells," in which 
    Sid learns how to estimate, rather than count, how many shells he has in 
    his glass jar.
