Well it sure works on PAL, but its a process i do not recommend.

Why?

First of all you can loose a ""ball"" or get ya dick stucked in the machine.

Because StudenK's - Amigo bl a b la b la.se
Does tell ya to buy their product and stick ya dick in the box, ""sorry girls"" you can't play, won't work with a dildo. must be the real thing.

Student K's Dick in a Box - NTSC TO PAL Conversion

Put ya dick in the X360, but be sure of not connecting the AC until your done.
you would not want to fry your balls before conversion is done, now would ya.

Get some lubricant, apply on the shaft, open the slot on the machine then pry the dick gently through, until you feel that you reached bottom.

No jerking, just light movements, if you start bangning the box, you void your warranty.

Keep this up a couple of minutes.

Use a dry cloth to vipe clean, plug in the AC, 
turn on tv and X360, put the game ""NTSC"" you want to play.

Voila!

Student K's Dick in box has now converted your NTSC Xbox 360 to PAL.

Works allmost as good as a modchip, without the pain in the groin, which can happen sometimes.

Cheap but painful

Get your Dick in a box now!
