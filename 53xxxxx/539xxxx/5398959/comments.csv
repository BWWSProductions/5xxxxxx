Am I doing something wrong?

PLEASE HELP!!!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-01T07:50Z,"@rob79: Well, everything is fine here. You should try maybe newer iTunes... newer iPod firmware, maybe you have old iPod... I really don't know. However, same things have been reported occasionally - but 0.004% is too low percentage to worry about."
