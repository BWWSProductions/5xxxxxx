"Electronic Kabuki Mambo is a stupefying pre-psychedelic vintage 50s affair featuring a tapestry of then local musical talents (One Henry Jacobs, Gordon Longfellow, David Talcott, and William Loughborough). Prepare yourself for a liberation of your senses. Prepare for an irresistible taste of the 50s in all of it's sonic sci-fi glory because this caravan of sound is where head music really began! Think Taj Mahal Travelers meets Harry Partch in an echo chamber. Think?Think? It's difficult to believe but for a period in 1955, Henry Jacobs, the grandmaster of left coast Zen Surrealism (known to some for his radio art innovations, his many recordings of Lenny Bruce, satirical forays as Shorty Petterstein, a fringe personality with the beat poets and a dear collaborator with Buddhist icon Alan Watts) and coveted experimental filmmaker Jordan Belson convinced San Francisco's fledgling Morrison Planetarium to allow the duo to put on the Vortex Experiments -- a quadraphonic sound and vision show premiering strange audio collages of works by famed composers Takemitsu, Stockhausen, Berio and countless ethnic field recordings with weird, tripped out oscilloscope flicks, excerpts from Belson's classic Allures, and other kaleidoscopic visuals to a regularly sold out, packed crowd of local residents interested in seeing what this new and crazy sensory experience was all about. Electronic Kabuki Mambo presents the first digital reissue of the original 1959 Folkways in its entirety. Fully remastered. Features new liner notes and never before published photos and other ephemera."
