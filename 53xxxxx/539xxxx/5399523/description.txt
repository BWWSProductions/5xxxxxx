This is Don Lawson's amazing book The French Resistance - The True Story of the Underground War Against the Nazis (1984) which describes the French resistance, the underground movement which through undetected acts of sabotage, intelligence gathering, and willingness to risk their lives, insured countless German defeats and strongly influenced the outcome of World War II. The grim reality of the Nazi occupation of 1940-1944 in France was broken only by the eternal hope and incredible courage of the underground freedom fighters of the French Resistance. Don Lawson, an American counterintelligence agent during World War Il, brings you close to the people who made this movement possible - personal portraits of courageous and determined individuals, most of whom had no military or intelligence training. He brings you top-secret details only an insider could have of code-breakers and spies against the dreaded Nazi Gestapo. All the more thrilling - because it's all true. 180 pages. A must read for everyone.
