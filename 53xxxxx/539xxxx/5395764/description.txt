This is my first torrent. Sorry in advance if it doesnt work properly, although it should.

I got Oakland about 2 weeks before Suffokate split up a couple years ago, and i'm sick of seeing 128kbps copies of this EPIC CD being thrown around. 

It's time. I bring you Suffokate's Oakland, in 320kbps!

I have almost 100gigs of not only metal, music, so if this works, requests will aim to be fulfilled. If you're having trouble finding stuff, hit me up!

Any and all feedback and contructive criticisms are welcome... but only if you SEED!

Enjoy.
