Auroras occur simultaneously in both the Arctic and Antarctic polar zones. In autumn 2003, NHK succeeded in capturing this phenomenon using High-Definition cameras, the first-ever attempt to film these mysterious lights in both the north and south at the same time and study the mechanisms of generation through movement and illumination. In addition to introducing the most advanced research into auroras conducted worldwide, the program also observes the daily life of northern nomads who have been living in harmony with the auroras for over 3,000 years.
