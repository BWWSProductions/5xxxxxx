,SiN-R,2010-03-02T18:01Z,i think you are the dumb one... there are a lot shared private server of final fantasy 11. eg: http://finalfantasy-server.gameonline4free.info/
,crimsonlung,2010-03-17T06:22Z,"This is not real, that SiN-R guy is in cahootz with this bs,  you absolutely can NOT have a private server to host FF 11.  If you look at the link he provided, it takes you to a website that says ""Final Fantasy X"" not XI, also, there is no links to anything on that website.  Forums would be HUGE for something like that. "
,mohoe,2010-03-21T04:13Z,"projectXI did exist. It worked at a basic level.  Unfortunately,  It recently got shut down by SE though."
,unrealdj,2010-04-26T22:52Z,"ok you 2 are fucking idiots.
""You can't have a private server for ffxi""
LOL, first off bitch and bitchette. Skim through some old blue gartr forum topics. 
PXI did exist, and it worked to some degree, and right when the server was about to hit playable BAM Square-Enix shut them down with C&D orders.
I also got a CnD from SE for scripting for a gran total of 2 days for them, and ironically I was one of the first ones to get it....

This does work, not sure who uploaded it though.

Basically you need to put the sql file into your mysql database.
start the server after changing settings.
more detailed info is in the file to download I'm sure......

As for meteorxi that simply bypasses POL, so you don't need a a pol account. It works you fucking idiots but it was never finished. "
,unrealdj,2010-04-26T22:53Z,"p.s. Sin-r does fail.... why the fuck did you post that, you just made this whole torrent look fake when it is indeed not."
,antarezx,2010-06-07T18:26Z,"umm.. guys.. im from indonesia with around 600USD/year salary. I badly wanna live in FFXI world. Theres no way i could pay for online. So, could u possibly tell me how to do it on my own PC? tunggaldjajatehnik@gmail.com"
,MeteorNixon,2010-06-10T23:20Z,"For those of you interested, I am trying to make available as much as I can the ProjectXI and Meteor-XI files. Since SquareEnix keeps C&Ding all the people that try to help, I decided to use Freenet. Give it a try: www.freenetproject.org

When you get on, enter this key where it says ""Visit a Freesite (if you know the key)"":
