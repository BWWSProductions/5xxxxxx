Rat.Race.2001.NORDIC.DVDRip.XviD-SweJimmy

		:PLOT:
Donald Sinclair owns the biggest, snazziest, flashiest, 
high rolling-est casino in Las Vegas. 
And to entertain some of his wealthiest patrons, 
he's staged the most original high stakes game that Sin City has ever seen! 
The contestants? Six teams. 
The jackpot? Two million dollars stuffed in a locker hundreds of miles away. 
The odds of winning? One in six. 
The rules? Well there's only one--get there first! 
What the racers don't know is that the tycoon and his rich buddies 
are betting on the outcome and are tracking every move the teams make.
It's only a matter of time before they figure out who really stands 
to win the most before switching course to look for a different kind of pay-off.

Personally I think this is "a must see movie". It's hilarious! 
Also I think there is a lot of great actors in this movie. 
Rowan Atkinson make a great part as allways!
