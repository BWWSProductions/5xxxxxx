First of all, Ratko Mladic is NOT convicted of war crimes, he is on trial (a big difference) for Srebrenica where only 3.500 are confirmed killed with another 3.500 missing which comes to total of 7.000 (not 8.300).
Second, even if he was the sole responsible for those killed and missing (which is total bullshit, anyone with a brain can find out how many Serbs were murdered by Muslims and Croats) many of those killed were soldiers led by war criminal Naser Oric who was acquitted in Hague when it's a known fact that he and his men were in big part responsible for 3.500 killed Serbs in villages around Srebrenica PRIOR to Serbian offensive.
Now you tell me, how the fuck can I give any credibility to this documentary now?"
