,humblebumble87,2010-02-26T14:46Z,"English? Yay! I've been checking back daily for this. 

How's the CAM quality? Is it bearable?

,william999,2010-02-26T17:56Z,A3V4 -- Just about unwatchable --- Thanks for the up anyway @.BONE. ....You cant ask much more on a first cam but its worth waiting for a better 1 i think.
,humblebumble87,2010-02-26T18:05Z,"Yeah, I checked out the sample now. I'm sorry it wasn't better. I think I will wait longer. But thank you anyway BONE. You are appreciated.

I think it's probably also the nature of this movie, which is very dark/medieval/rainy. Not a great fit for a cam.
