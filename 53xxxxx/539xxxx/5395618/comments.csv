Missing Maps from Cache

If your getting the error '*TEMP* one or more files which are needed to play this game are not available locally. They must be download first' you are missing the maps from your cache.
to update your cache you can download the missins maps from
Code:

http://www.nibbits.com/sc2/maps/

once you have the maps you need to place them in the correct Cache directory.
The directroy structure for the cache is 1st_&_2nd_characters_of_filename\3rd_&_4nd_charact ers_of_filename\filename.s2ma

example for the map Desert Oasis:
file name: 96669b00b9a1f85f1a228c8a04752aeca9af28706a47c3f4b7 e9aa45c1ab58c6.s2ma

directory to place file in: 96\66\
complete path: C:\Users\Your_Username\AppData\Local\Blizzard Entertainment\Battle.net\Cache\96\66\96669b00b9a1f 85f1a228c8a04752aeca9af28706a47c3f4b7e9aa45c1ab58c 6.s2ma"

,greatman3388,2010-02-26T22:40Z,"brokencow: After you patch, you then need to download some maps. Not sure what that link is. You then need to open the loader.exe (NOT THE BETA ITSELF) and load the map from there. You'll enter a game as a random race with no opponents."

3) Download and save a map somewhere to your computer - from this site: http://www.nibbits.com/sc2/maps/ .

4) Download and install the SC2 Beta - Offline Sandbox: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5395618/SC2_Beta_-_Offline_Sandbox_%5BFIXED_ZIP%5D .

And its no virus, this is no fake n gay ""crack"". Just a nice Sandbox mod and it makes waiting for AI and so on much easier."
,2weak,2010-02-26T23:01Z,"@everyone
i downloaded the crack and it works, i had problem with the version so i just redownloaded the beta and reinstalled and that fixed it.(i have fast connection so it only too about 15min) after that i re downloaded the loader.exe(the crack) and downloaded some maps from nibbits.com and put every thing on the desktop(the maps and the loader) and from here everything worked.

for me its just a  sandbox where its just you, i dont even see an ai on the map, its says victory at the start then you click return to game and you can play.(the race is chosen randomly at the start so you may have to restart it to get the one you want) but other than that its a good way to practice Bo's(build orders) and get used to the units and gameplay while you wait for the crack, a beta invite or the real game to come out.
"

it would be great if instead of making us be a random race they made us melee with all races that way we could test things out and see which units beat which units."

1. Install game from torrent.
2. Download patch, or download Sandbox, then drag and drop patch on to StarCraft II launcher. It will then update.
3. Launch LazyLauncher.
4. Select a map - to do this, you can either take a map from the cache, or download one from one of the links in the comments here. It doesn't matter were the map is located. I dropped a map into the local folder for SCII.

Once you've done that, just hit ""stay in game"" or ""return to game"" or whatever and then sandbox it up."

,lazytownteam,2010-02-27T02:17Z,"Hey guys,

Thanks for the support. We're happy to have gotten this out there for everyone to enjoy. It  took quite a few sleepless nights and energy drinks to get it together. I think we were quite successful if the volume of traffic our servers are getting hit with is any indication.

For anyone having trouble getting this figured out, here is a quick guide to getting everything set up:

-Download the client and install it to your computer.

-Download the torrent for the crack (this torrent).

-Download a Starcraft II map.

-Open the Battle.net folder, and create a folder called Cache. In the Cache folder, create another folder named after the first two digits of the filename of the map you downloaded. In that folder, create a folder named after the third and forth digits of the filename of the map you downloaded. Place the downloaded map in this folder.

-Open the ""lazylaunch"" program that you extracted from the compressed crack. When prompted, open the map you downloaded from the location you just placed it in. Click return to game and enjoy!

We're working on getting a version out that will allow you to play against AI in the next few days here. Also, we will be rolling out a multiplayer crack in a week or so.

We do need a couple of keys for our team to work with in order to both the AI and multiplayer crack running. If you have a key that you're willing to give up for the greater good, please send it to: lazytowndevs@hotmail.com

,archlvt,2010-02-27T03:33Z,"I just wanted to point out, like others have stated, that Lazytownteam is NOT the real user.  Do not send any beta keys to anyone, ever.  The real devs don't need keys.

If the username is not Lazy_Town spelled EXACTLY that way, then it's fake.  Most of you know this by now, but some might not.  Make sure every page has at least 1 comment letting people know not to send anyone beta keys."
,Artiscock,2010-02-27T03:35Z,"What the fuck is this shit? The file only contains a txt file saying ""This is not a virus""...and then an invalid zip file, that if you rename it to .rar contains a another txt file telling you to run lazylaunch. Very nice, but where is the fucking Lazylaunch?
This thing is bullsh*t all through and through!"

,Lazy-Town,2010-02-27T04:01Z,"Hey guys,

Thanks for the support. We're happy to have gotten this out there for everyone to enjoy. It took quite a few sleepless nights and energy drinks to get it together. I think we were quite successful if the volume of traffic our servers are getting hit with is any indication.

For anyone having trouble getting this figured out, here is a quick guide to getting everything set up:

-Download the client and install it to your computer - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5371903/Starcraft_2_Beta_Client_US_Build_13891

-Download the torrent for the crack - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5395618/SC2_Beta_-_Offline_Sandbox_%5BFIXED_ZIP%5D

-Download a Starcraft II map- http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5376948/

-Open the Battle.net folder, and create a folder called Cache. In the Cache folder, create another folder named after the first two digits of the filename of the map you downloaded. In that folder, create a folder named after the third and forth digits of the filename of the map you downloaded. Place the downloaded map in this folder.

-Open the ""lazylaunch"" program that you extracted from the compressed crack. When prompted, open the map you downloaded from the location you just placed it in. Click return to game and enjoy!

We're working on getting a version out that will allow you to play against AI in the next few days here. Also, we will be rolling out a multiplayer crack in a week or so.

We do need a couple of keys for our team to work with in order to both the AI and multiplayer crack running. If you have a key that you're willing to give up for the greater good, please send it to: lazytowndevz@hotmail.com

,WeezyPop,2010-02-27T05:55Z,"first wanna thank you guys! good job!

blizzard just released a new patch (version 0.4.0.14133), I just installed the patch, and sandbox works fine like it used to be in the first patch, however it seems that it does NOT load the new patch content such as Mothership's shield and hit poits decreased from 400 to 350
So i think sandbox needs to be updated in order to load the new patch content."

,SlayerNYC,2010-02-27T06:21Z,"It WORKS it is not BS, follow the instructions, the map/replay torrent has all the files in the cache folder in order already so copy the cache folder from it and drop it on the bnet folder of your installed beta, same for the SWF folder. Drop the maps folder on the install directory where all the other folders are."
,DoomKiwi,2010-02-27T06:25Z,Every last comment here asking for a Beta key is a scammer. The LazyTown Team has their own Mail server -- would they honestly use a hotmail or gmail address?

,Vish_nu,2010-02-27T18:44Z,"This works....virus free....Tried it last night, at first I was thinking it was a bad hack, but then after 5sec realized that I just needed to turn up the video options to ""Ultra"".........................ALSO.........This torrent is not a hack, though, if it were, it is a good one, because it requires you to turn off your Virus/antimalware protection to run it (at least it did for me)........so, Lazy_Town would have your IP address, and know that you had your ""Protection Software"" off.........ANYWAY......They want to keep their names trustworthy, so, DON'T worry about it, just turn your anti stuff back on when you are not playing the game and quit crying about Hacks and scams....(Except when people ask for Beta Key....that is SCAM BIG TIME...NEVER respond to that shit)"
,Vish_nu,2010-02-27T18:52Z,@methylik ...........u have to update your SC2 intallation before this will work

,Lazy-Town,2010-02-27T20:46Z,"Quick update. Update to play against semi-AI is out. It will attack if attacked first but nothing else at this point, a lot better than nothing though.

As always, any extra keys help getting more devs working on this so lazytowndevz@hotmail.com but don't fret if you can't contribute. Just a matter of time until full AI now."

anyone else experiencing this?"
,Pr0gramm,2010-02-28T16:01Z,"Yes Probez, same here. I was using Lazy Launcher even today and suddenly AVG started detecting as a Virus and when i downloaded few days ago it didnt detect it.

,Bennybo10000,2010-02-28T16:05Z,"To both of you having problems, that happened to me also with Avira. Don't worry, it is not harmful. Just turn off your Anti-virus (don't worry) when playing the game and it will be fine. I have been doing so for several days with no virus related problems."
