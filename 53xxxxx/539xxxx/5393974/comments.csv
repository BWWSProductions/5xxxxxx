and do you have a DEMONOID account ???"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-26T06:44Z,"@htctouch: I am really congested and I doubt that I can up Princess this week. Maybe Sunday, I'll do my best...

@HolyRooster:
Regarding Helo L., if you think a movie, it was done last month
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5327551/Halo.Legends.2010.BDRip.H264[REQ]
but, I have limited upload (60 kB/s) and I cannot support ongoing TV series.
Boondcock S. II - currently I cannot make a dupe for WS screener, even if BDrip for sure offers better quality for exactly the same reason.
Demonoid account: No, I don't have one. I have many accounts which I do not use since I am here."

,mattbdon,2010-02-26T09:56Z,Hi 2040 and thanks again for all your hard work. I know your schedule is totally full at the moment but at some point in the future would you consider uploading the house of cards trilogy? I would love to see it. Thanks either way.
,dannyw1981,2010-02-26T10:54Z,"can someone seed please, thanks"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-26T10:59Z,"@stev: Please, in cases like that you MUST be sure that you don't feed the ""gremlins"" and not give support to true leechers.
a) You MUST use PeerBlock, and he will block 106 millions of well known gremlins
b) You MUST use uTorrent or Bittorrent because these two are the only ones which show and are able to resolve host-names (country-flags or IP addresses cannot help you to recognize attacks from *above.net idiots or other engaged ckc-suckers). Using these you can spot their coming and block their IP range within your firewall.

You cannot allow more than 1:1 ratio during the download itself. You can go high as you want - as seeder, after the download.

Advice just for now: your sweet-spot is for now: UploadSpeed 19kb/s, DownloadSpeed unlimited. After you hit the 100% unleash your UL at max. as long you can.

@mattbdon: Yes, it is the trilogy - but every part has 4 episodes and as other UK shows, each is almost 1 hour long.
Based on that - I  really can't. It's too big."
,stev666,2010-02-26T12:16Z,"Thanks fot the advice 20-40 my peerblock is always running and utorrent is the only way to go, im still using ver 1.8.5 as vers 2 doesnt work on my local torrent site, see here in South Africa our international bw is really expensive, there is a South African torrent site (invite only priv tracker for south africans) i get some of my stuff from as i can use local only bw (much cheaper then int bw) to download from there. Thanks you for all the hard work, time and patience you put into your uploads. "
,lilars26,2010-02-26T14:44Z,"Thank you 20-40.
