Chaos in Paradise began to take its primary shape in October 2008...

With needed time and guided by one single imperative: â€œAll good things come with serenity and lucidityâ€, the suspects were joining, individual after individual, and in June 2009 Chaos in Paradise finally became a real family...

With very dissimilar personalities, everyone blend their experiences and histories to empower the reason of Chaos in Paradise existence.

The band spirit is guided by 3 â€œrulesâ€:  TALK, LISTEN and EXPERIMENT!
Those 3 words are always nearby in all of their work, assuming Metal as a starting point of it all and after that, all lanes are possible and all experiences are welcome...
 

NAME ORIGIN

The name CHAOS IN PARADISE is a result of a powerful sound mixed with nice melodiesâ€¦ That's their main feature!
They try to combine the most evil sound with an attractive tune, to combine power and magnificence!
