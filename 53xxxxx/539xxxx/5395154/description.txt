  New Rochelle, the 1960s. High schooler Frank Abagnale Jr. idolizes his father
  who's in trouble with the IRS. When his parents separate, Frank runs away to
  Manhattan with $25 in his checking account, vowing to regain dad's losses and
  get his parents back together. Just a few years later, the FBI tracks him down
  in France; he's extradited, tried, and jailed for passing more than $4,000,000
  in bad checks. Along the way, he's posed as a Pan Am pilot, a pediatrician,
  and an attorney. And, from nearly the beginning of this life of crime, he's
  been pursued by a dour FBI agent, Carl Hanratty. What starts as cat and mouse
  becomes something akin to father and son.
