This is my first attempt at a themed house mix this year and a start for many more to come.  Nowhere near perfect however I thought it was a decent first attempt.  There are a few slight beat mismatch errors and I'm still working on my sound levels (i.e. for vocals, and track transitions).  The mix was completed in one take.  I thought the theme of the mix was fitting after watching old school Kung Fu movies all weekend.  Some really good tracks here, hope you enjoy.  


Enjoy!
