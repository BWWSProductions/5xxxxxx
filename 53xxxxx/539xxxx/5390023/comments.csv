They have turned the middle class against the poor to fight out a dumb war, while the FEW, Very few ever growing rich reap the rewards.  The rest fight for table scraps.

Only a cool-aid drinking would look at capitalism and think oh, yeah perfect system... if you are rich!  I don't be grudge those who work & make out well, no one should.  But look at ass clowns like Bill Gates that cheat the system.  Now he & MELINDA have a foundation that SPENDS PIDDLY amounts of their BILLIONS on charity.  At least Warrent Buffet said, it all goes back to the people when he dies.  MOST OLD MONEY stays locked up un-circulated... TRICKLE DOWN my a$$!

,DemonicArc,2010-03-16T16:23Z,"lol @ FailedSuicideAttempt

You seem to misunderstand, I'm not claiming capitalism is good, I'm just saying that what I hate more than Capitalism, what I hate more than anything is Hypocrisy, and Charging the price of a Hollywood blockbuster for a movie centered around bashing Capitalism is, in my opinion, Hypocrisy of the worst kind.

If this movie was intended, truly intended to educate people of Capitalism's abuse of the working class, it would be distributed on a free medium, or merely at a price high enough to cover the costs of production, but charge as much as you would for Die-hard, or Avatar, and there is something seriously wrong with you.

Moore is nothing more than a Hypocritical hipster, he creates these movies that go against the norm and ""reveal the truth"" while he himself is profiting on these very things, He is a charlatan and a buffoon, and while his films might be slightly educational, I've no respect for the man, and I say that they are mildly educational because most of his info has already been covered dozens of times on a free medium."
,Phatfish,2010-03-16T22:46Z,"Michel Moore is probably not the right person to make this film.
It sort of defeats its own purpose.

Ironically I cant help but notice that its obviously dumb-down to ""sell"" better.

Some good points but lacks substance.

,spiderr,2010-03-20T08:38Z,"Everyone who thinks Moore's making millions off this is FUCKING RETARDED. This article is 3 years old but still works: associatedcontent.com/article/142548/the_independent_moviemaker_where_your.html

tl;dr: When movies were $7 a ticket, you are paying the theater $3.50, the studio $2.89, everyone else shares $.61 on a wide release blockbuster movie.

Ticket prices are always the strawman argument for piracy; that theater still has to train, staff, and insure the place whether you come to a movie or not. I pirate because I'm an asshole, nothing more."
,real-be,2010-03-22T10:48Z,"@Spider: Please do not call someone ""fucking retarded"" if you yourself are a beginner in the subject matter. In fact, you are rather gullible my friend. 

Assuming that the numerical example you have presented is fairly adequate to large scale film distribution (which is not the case, because as your article says, numbers vary wildly) then Michael Moore, as a director and screenwriter (which I am assuming are the only jobs on a variable remuneration - because the cast salary and other costs are covered by the studio) is earning 0.61 cents per 7 dollars. This may not seem like a lot, but it is! He is earning 9 cents on the dollar - a huge, mammoth proportion!

Let's work the numbers:

Domestic Gross: $14,363,397 * (as of Dec 2009 - might have grown!)

Directors cut: 9 % X $14,363,397 = $1,251,667.45 

In addition, as Moore is also the producer of the movie he is also making money out of production and distribution!!!

Resutl: Michael Moore DOES make millions out of his movies - With this I'm not saying he's a bad person, or this is a bad movie. I'm only saying he reaps the advantages of Capitalist society he is badmouthing.

,anarchistsdream,2010-03-23T02:51Z,"Great documentary.  Im at a 7.5 ratio, but don't worry, I'll be seeding this for a while.

,spiderr,2010-03-23T03:35Z,"@real-be I love how personal you took my comment considering you've not posted in these comments before now. This is the Internet, where people start random flame wars because they can. 

The 9 cent on the dollar number was based on a 50/50 split of a summer blockbuster... which this will not be. $1,251,667.45 is a single million as a director. 

As for production, there are 15 'producer' variant credits on the movie. Not knowing how much the film cost or if Moore paid for any of it himself like he did with Roger & Me, I can't guess if his production credit netted him this  'millions' in contest here. I could argue that the 'millions' number I was thinking of was $20,000,000 but that would be too much cover-my-ass at this point. I just don't see Moore getting 'rockstar' money off of a film.

Moore doesn't seem to mind direct Capitalism, his gamble with Roger & Me could have cost him his home but instead paid off. But whatever this system is where money can be gambled and lost but the government will let the rich continue to place bets with citizen money... isn't normal.

Anyway, you're going to have some sort of ""I'm a professional at this"" rebuttal or whatever, that I'm going to ignore because I'm hopping on some other torrent... probably porn. Enjoy your time on the Internet lolz"

[Full disclosure:  I'm somewhat of a libertarian progressive; think Glen Greenwald.]

Moore often makes good points; however, he's extraordinarily bad at doing it in an honest manner.  He tends to, basically, edit his films to create fictional events, takes scenes out of context, and glosses over things that disagree with his points.

Examples:

""Roger and Me"":  The ""Board Meeting Scene"" could not have happened the way he depicted it.

""Sicko"":  The nice hospital the people stayed at...sure...Communist PARTY members would go there, but the proletariat would be in crappy ones (albeit free ones none the less).

Not attacking or really disagreeing with you here.  ;-)

good movie overall, worth watching and definitely learning something too. go Michael, lets bring down the capitalist system.

I see people attacking Moore on this page, and thats fine, but dont forget one basic idea here; its not Michael that you should criticizes, forget about him and concentrate on the message the movie gives. who cares who Michael is , the important point is the message the movie has. 

Like the ancient Persians said; ""Remember the glory of Flight of a bird, not the bird itself, because the bird is a mortal and insignificant.""

Hence its the message that is important."
,USNgreen,2010-05-02T10:13Z,"@real-be

i agree with you 100% moore is very liberal, he make make millions off of his films but we don't know where that money goes. from his very first documentary(low production cost, you can see it) to his latest(higher and better quality). and he obviously donates a lot of his proceeds to combat the issues he is fighting. after watching any of his films i always do post research to see how the situation might have changed. He also gives alot of funding to his home town of flint michigan for witch he is very fond of. im a registerd republican and i love his liberal views. i think he deserves alot of credit(and a decent salery)"
,skullfcukyou,2010-05-20T04:38Z,"Attack him for his political views, fine. But quit bashing Moore because his movie was in theatres. That is out of his control. The crooks funding his films don't do it for the good of humanity. He speaks of this in ""The Corporation"". How he's found a loophole in their twisted system. He uses their money to fight them. Pretty smart if you ask me.

Also, the man supports file sharing. Google: Michael Moore on piracy. It'll be the first video.

,efeffess,2010-09-30T09:25Z,"Michael Moore, as anyone else, has the right to make money from their works. He does so not at the expense of the lifestyles of citizens, unlike Big Corporation in general.

Moore would, indeed, be hypocritical if he generated wealth from a movie denouncing capitalism. Such pretenses do not occur in his films, and he faces opponents on both sides of the political fence. Though I am convinced he creates for his own motivations, such creations only serve mankind as a people.

Micheal Moore is extremely good at documentaries if you've seen his other films too. He is definitively the person to make this film as he is even brave enough to say things straight out, even though most of America (at least used to) calls him a propagandist and betrayer. He has some good point, but he lets you think out the conclusions yourself so that you can convince yourself, instead of simply saying ""Capitalism is bad"". Not everyone would believe that, but they cannot refuse good and real arguments.
