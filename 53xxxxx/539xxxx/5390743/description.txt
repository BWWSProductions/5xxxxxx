From Wiki:


Collective Soul is an American rock band from Stockbridge, Georgia. They have enjoyed popularity on alternative rock, mainstream rock and pop music radio throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, recording seven #1 mainstream rock hits.[1] They broke into mainstream popularity with their hit single "Shine" from their debut album Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid, released in 1993. They were inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame on September 19, 2009. 






Hints, Allegations and Things Left Unsaid 1993


Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid is the debut album of Atlanta rock band Collective Soul. It was originally released as a demo on a small indie label in Atlanta called Rising Storm Records. However, the track "Shine" attracted attention to the band thanks to college radio. They signed on with Atlantic Records and, in 1994, re-released the demo as an official studio album under the Atlantic label.

The album's title is derived from the lyrics of Paul Simon's 1986 hit "You Can Call Me Al". The cover art itself is a modified version of the original logo of Stephen Sondheim's 1979 Broadway musical, Sweeney Todd. The album's opening track, "Shine," would become arguably Collective Soul's biggest hit.

Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid was recorded in a basement in 1992 and intended as a promotional demo. Band frontman Ed Roland hoped to sell the songs to a publishing company rather than begin a band. He gave the demo to a small college radio station in Atlanta, Georgia which began playing "Shine." The track quickly became their most requested song and the band was requested to perform some concerts for the station. Favoring an opportunity to perform a few shows with his brother, Roland agreed and regathered the demo's guitarist and drummer as well as his brother Dean.

However, the attention gained by "Shine" allowed it to chart and catapulted the band to stardom. They were soon picked up by Atlantic Records who wished to release the demo tracks as the debut studio album of Collective Soul. In a 1995 interview, Roland elaborated on his mixed feelings regarding the situation:

"It wasn't even remixed. It was the same demo. Before we got signed we'd already charted with 'Shine.' Once we got signed I said, 'We want to rerecord. This is not a band recording.' But they said, 'You're gonna lose momentum. You're looking at a three to five month process. So let's go with it and you can get your next record out quick.' We thought it would be great to sell 10-20,000 units. [When it went gold], we were sitting there with our eyes wide open."

Consequently, Collective Soul would regard their 1995 studio album under Atlantic as the band's official debut. Roland told Metal Edge, "It's so funny for people to compare the two. It's like comparing one band to another band. [Collective Soul] is our first record, flat out."

Collective Soul 1995



Collective Soul, also sometimes known as the "Blue Album," is the second and eponymous studio album by Collective Soul, first released on March 14, 1995. It became Collective Soul's highest selling album to date, going Triple-Platinum, and spent 76 weeks on the Billboard 200 charts. The singles "December," "The World I Know" and "Where the River Flows" all reached #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, while the first two singles also became major pop hits.

Frontman Ed Roland has considered Collective Soul the band's true debut album; Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid was intended more as a promotional demo and a means of acquiring a publishing contract for Roland who in 1995 noted "It's so funny for people to compare the two. It's like comparing one band to another band. This record is our first record, flat out."

Amidst the surprise success of "Shine," taken from the Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid demo recordings, Collective Soul insisted on remixing the songs for higher quality re-release. However, they were told the time required for this would drain their momentum. The band were instead convinced they could begin recording a new, sophomore effort immediately after finishing their tour schedule.

The recording and mixing of Collective Soul took five weeks, a strained scheduled due to added concerts in late December 1994 which finished on New Year's Eve. Ed Roland wrote thirty-five songs in 1994 and recorded fifteen of them in the studio. Four more were written in studio which allowed the band to disregard eight of the previous tracks. Lead guitarist Ross Childress helped write "Simple" and "The World I Know" which was greatly encouraged by Roland who wanted a band effort in the studio.

By the time "Smashing Young Man" was being recorded, drummer Shane Evans was on vacation and unreachable. This forced the band to loop a drum sample of his from a DAT before hiring a second drummer to improve it. After many takes, Roland was also disappointed with the final version of "Bleed" but liked the song too much to remove it from the record.

Mixing was completed in the first week of February 1995; mastering was finished on a Friday with the plants opened and the album delivered the next day. The band then went to New York for a week of publicity and photo sessions.[1]

Collective Soul opening for Van Halen on a tour which began in March 1995 in Pensacola, Florida and ended May 8. The band then performed at festivals in the United States before taking a break and then continuing with their own solo tour including club shows. Seven songs from the new album were performed on tour with "Shine" being the only played track from their previous release. A new unnamed song was also performed in concert.[1]

The band's self-titled release included five singles: "December," "The World I Know," "Where the River Flows," "Gel" and "Smashing Young Man." The three former tracks reached #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks charts and the first two became major pop hits. Music videos were also filmed for some singles and aired significantly on MTV.

Collective Soul received positive reviews with praise handed to its strong melodies and some indifferent towards an alleged lack of musical innovation. Paul Evans of Rolling Stone gave the album 3 out of 5 stars. He noted "Roland's flair for McCartneyesque melodic detail" and summed up with "the band proves it has the goods to continue to shine on brightly."

Allmusic's Tom Demalon chose "The World I Know" and "Gel" as AMG Track Picks. He, too, commended the strong melodies and stated "While not exactly ground-breaking, Collective Soul delivers the goods with a dozen, hook-laden songs for which they were awarded another multi-platinum outing."

Disciplined Breakdown 1997


Disciplined Breakdown is the third studio album by Collective Soul, first released on March 11, 1997. The album was recorded during a difficult time in the band's career, when they were going through a long lawsuit with their former management, and they also recorded the album in Cabin-like studio due to lack of money. Despite not being as successful as their past albums, Disciplined Breakdown earned Collective Soul a million-selling album (charting at #16), and produced a couple of hits, in the form of "Precious Declaration" (#1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks for four weeks) and "Listen" (#1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks for five weeks), which also charted on the Billboard Hot 100, at #65 and #72, respectively.

Dosage 1999


Dosage is the fourth studio album by Atlanta-based American alternative rock band Collective Soul. The album was released in February 1999 and peaked at #21 in Billboard's albums chart (see 1999 in music). The album's title was derived from a catchphrase they used to describe burnout after their previous tour.[1]

The first single from the album, "Heavy", gave the band another #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and spent a then record-breaking 15 weeks in the top spot. "Heavy" was also featured in the opening of EA Sports NHL 2001 video game. The second single released, "Run", also gained broad mainstream radioplay.

Dosage marked a change in recording and style for Collective Soul. Unhappy with the production and sound of the previous album Disciplined Breakdown, the band focused more on production and technique for the recording of Dosage.[2] The result led to an arduous six-month recording period where according to guitarist Dean Roland: "The way we recorded Dosage, we were really meticulous about everything that we did for that record."[2] More than before the band progressed to a high production pop-rock sound. This status was obvious with the extensive use of loops, Pro-Tools effects, and synth-pop sounds, especially in comparison with the band's previous three albums which are more organic and raw in sound.

It is made up of some of their greatest hits from 1994 to 2001 and included two new tracks Next Homecoming and Energy. Although many people complained that it left out many of Collective Soul's greatest songs and it only included their most popular or most successful songs, 7even year itch still got good reviews and was relatively successful. It sold 225,000 copies in the first year after its release. In the U.S. it reached number fifty on the Billboard but in Canada it got even better reception and more popularity, it reached number nine on the Canadian billboards and went platinum. All the songs in 7even Year Itch at one point had been on the US Hot 100, the US Mainstream Rock, or the US Modern Rock chart, except for Energy, which 7even year itch was its debut album.

7even Year Itch was the last album Collective Soul released through Atlantic Records and their last album to feature guitarist Ross Childress, who had been with the band since its 1993 debut.
