Did you try by rightclicking over the rosetta stone icon in applications, and choosing ""explore content"" then you search the folder and replace the file. I hope it's useful for you."
,ihaverights2,2012-02-19T22:52Z,"Okay, I'm new to this whole thing... But I copied the file and replaced it as said. But when I open the program it wants me to add a language level? Then asks for a CD? I'm lost."

,crazyiris,2012-05-08T00:34Z,"Hey guys, 

Registered just to let you know how to get this going! I'm so thankful to not have to pay for this overpriced bundle of poos that I'd like to help out. 

The readme included with this torrent does a great job of describing how to implement the crack, so install the .dmg and follow the readme's crack explanation. 

Once the program is installed, it'll ask you to install a language. NO LANGUAGES ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS--you have to download language packs (found on this site). Once you've torrented these, do the following: 

1. Language packs will have multiple levels (always, if I'm not mistaken, levels 1, 2, and 3); 

2. Once you've downloaded the language pack (Japanese, for example), double click on the .iso . On a Mac, double clicking on the .iso will automatically ""mount"" the file. This means your OS is creating a disk IMAGE, and your computer will recognize the mounted image as a ""disc."" 

3. Open Rosetta Stone. It'll ask you if you'd like to install any languages. Since you've double clicked the .iso you downloaded from this site (e.g. Japanese.iso), Rosetta Stone will recognize it as a viable disc from which to install the language. Proceed to press the ""Continue"" button when asked by Rosetta Stone to ""Please insert the Language CD in the CD-ROM drive."" 

4. Again, because you double clicked the .iso you downloaded from Pirate Bay, the file is mounted as a disc image. This means Rosetta Stone recognizes the mounted disc image as a physical CD-ROM. Hitting ""Continue"" on the screen mentioned in Step 3 will bring you to a list of languages to install. [Note: Since I downloaded the Japanese.iso from this site, I was asked if I wanted to install Japanese Level 1, Level 2, etc. After downloading the language of your choice, you too will be asked to choose a Level to install.]

And that's it! .iso files work for Mac and PC, so don't worry about finding an OS-specific .iso 

Sorry if the description is too convoluted--the process is quite straightforward, however, and if my instructions are confusing, there should be an abundance of guides on how to mount .iso's . google that shit!

,Hyyer,2012-05-15T04:17Z,"hey everyone, first of all thanks OP for uploading. 
install went great.

>>>technical issue. I'm on a MBP using built-in microphone and it seems to be 'clipping' sort of, if you know what I mean. Like when I speak and look @ the analyzer it sort of only gets the beginning of what I say, then loops it with more, etc. 

EXAMPLE: ""He...Hell....Hello....Hello man-...Hello mangia....""

Anyone else experiencing this, and do you think it is software or hardware side?"
,Hyyer,2012-05-15T04:22Z,"Great upload, install was fine.

Having some trouble with built-in MBP microphone. It's sort of 'clipping' and 'looping'. I can't really explain it sort of like this when I look @ it in the analyzer. 

EXAMPLE: ""Le-...Le don-... Le done-... Le done mangi-..... Le done magiano gl-...""

you get the point. thoughts? do you think it's software side or should I get a dedicated mic just to be sure?"
