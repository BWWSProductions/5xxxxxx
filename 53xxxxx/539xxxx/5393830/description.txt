Edited Razor1911 Crack

Heres a fix for 1.2.1 to connect to gamespy and bypass the 'update required'.
You need version 1.2.1!
This will let you connect to gamespy and not force update to 1.3.0,
you can have friends make a server and and you can play online,
but it wont connect to 1.3.0 servers (will just give an error),
if anyone else makes a server using this crack you can join only those.

So if you make a server using this start your server name with 121, 
that way people on this crack will know they can join your server.

This is just a temporary online crack for those who want to play
with friends until Razor releases 1.3.0.
(which probably wont be out until they crack the DLC with it)
Once the official 1.3.0 is cracked and out update to 1.3.0 and use that.

If you already updated to 1.3.0 THIS WILL NOT RUN ON GAME UPDATED TO 1.3.0,
This will only work on 1.2.1 that hasnt been updated!

Soooooo yeah just replace the borderlands.exe with this one lol.
