              We have gravity to thank that we remain on our feets at the
              earths surface, but Ryan want's to know how the human body
              will react to the opposite. He'll do a few 'tests' like
              putting himself in a centrifuge and jumping in to an
              airplane that'll travel at around 750km/h, how will his
              body react to the G-force?
