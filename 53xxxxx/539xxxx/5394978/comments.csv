,mrhozer,2010-03-30T19:11Z,"Not the best mix... Maybe it's the Greatest Crap songs of the 90's. I would say maybe 20% of these are hits, and maybe 3-5 songs that anyone would even want to listen to these days. Too many early 90's songs with the terrible beats and even worse lyrics. There were WAY better songs in the 90's in each genre.

No offense, just my opinion. Thanks for the upload though."
