A modern day retelling of the classic story The Frog
Prince. The Princess and the Frog finds the lives of
arrogant, carefree Prince Naveen and hardworking
waitress Tiana crossing paths. Prince Naveen is
transformed into a frog by a conniving voodoo
magician and Tiana, following suit, upon kissing the
amphibian royalty. With the help of a trumpet-playing
alligator, a Cajun firefly, and an old blind lady who
lives in a boat in a tree, Naveen and Tiana must race
to break the spell and fulfill their dreams.
