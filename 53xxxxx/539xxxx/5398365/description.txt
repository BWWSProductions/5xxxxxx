PART 1 

This is a torrent based off of an existing one available here on the PirateBay. I took the time to fix many issues with it, and to add in some extra "goodies".

 Things fixed include:
 
                - Track numbers, album names, and discogrpahies are completed.
                   - Not all tracks had track numbers, so I fixed this.
                   - Not all songs had albums added to them, so I fixed this.
                   - Discogrpahries are completed, namely:
                             - Chapel of Ghoul's "Prays to Nothingness".
                             - Belketre's complete discography - not just the split
                                with Vlad Tepes
                             - Brenoritvezorkre's discography is complete,
                                including the five and nine track versions
                                of the album Nevgzerya.
                             - Mutiilation's discography is complete, including
                                the Demo "Black Imperial Blood" which differs from
                                "Vampires of black imperial blood".
                             - Vlad Tepes Discography is complete.
                             - Has the four track version of "susvourtre".
                             - Also has artists all under the same name - for 
                                example, no more "Mutilation" and "Mutiilation".

                 
               -  This torrent is meant to be loaded onto an iPod, as well as for
                   use on yor computer. To this end, it contains a .MP4 version
                   of the rare "Moevot" tribute video to the LLN, which can
                   also be viewed on
                           - Other Goodies included:
                                   - Vordb's final statement, as shown on his
                                      myspace.
                                   - Magazine interviews with Vlad Tepes, not just
                                     "The black plague" magazine!

      - PLEASE HELP ME SEED! This cannot be stressed enough. You WILL reach a 
         ration of 1.00 before you finsh the download - this does not mean
         you can leave! Please consider seeding to a 2.00, 2.50, or 3.00.
 
   - THAT having been said, thank you all for downloading, and MANY, 
      MANY, thanks to the torrent creator for making this torrent.
       All I have done is fill in some gaps and make it easier to use
       on your mp3 player.


Sincerely,
Vzldrb.

 HAIL THE BLACK LEGIONS!
