  Battlefield: Bad Company 2 brings the award-winning Battlefield gameplay to
  the forefront of PC gaming with best-in-class vehicular combat and unexpected
  "Battlefield moments." New vehicles like the ATV and a transport helicopter
  allow for all-new multiplayer tactics on the Battlefield. With the
  Frostbite-enabled Destruction 2.0 system, you can take down entire buildings
  and create your own fire points by blasting holes through cover. You can also
  compete in four-player teams in two squad-only game modes, fighting together
  to unlock exclusive awards and achievements. Battles are set across expansive
  maps, each with a different tactical focus. The game also sees the return of
  the B Company squad in a more mature single-player campaign.

NOTE:

To all the people who cant get mouse working!
Actually read these comments and the solution is right here!

Copy ALL the items in the crack directory including the 2 text files over to the games root directory and that will fix the mouse and control issue. Thats all 4 files!!!
DO NOT COPY OVER THE â€˜rld-bbc2â€² file as this is your key generator.

Simple as that!!!
