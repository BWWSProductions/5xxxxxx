It would be a good idea to have complete knowledge before advising others.  If not, someone with 30 plus years in the trade just might call YOU a noob. 

Not **all** KeyGens are safe. Some have Trojans and Spyware imbedded. 

While it is true that the AV apps using typical or common heuristic engines will commonly flag a KeyGen as suspect the better AV's use heuristic engines that can comprehend the difference between KeyGens and the somewhat similar, but different system calls of a Trojan.

Continuing it's highest rated detection abilities and the lowest false positives, I would recommend Panda Cloud AV. The last test of Panda against that German machine capable of delivering over a million viruses, malware, spyware, etc, etc, Panda was points above every other Antivirus software available.   

Yes, I have read reports that see Panda Cloud is shown somewhere in the middle by one, but they based some of the decision making on speed differences.  Speed? Really? Anyone willing to accept the occasional virus because they find a faster AV essential, has a piece of brain missing. 

Then there is the true noob who contends ""I use Catch-em AV and have never had a virus. It must be the best!

Haven't had one yet, you mean, that you know of. I once pulled 63 malware, spyware, and viruses of a guys machine who claimed his AV was the best.

If you want the top performing antivirus software, there is only one. Panda Cloud Antivirus.  Panda Cloud preformed heads above all other contenders (all of the well known names and many not so well known) in tests on the German machine designed to throw more than a million viruses, etc. at an AV software. 

IT caught 98.6% of the viruses, and had a false positive rate below 3%.  The next closest was at 92% with about 12% false positives. It is not expensive, and they offer a free version with the same viral stopping ability but lacking the frills.

My Panda is free because I had a part in the development, but I still use the free version everyone can get off the internet.  It is one of the few that can tell the difference between a safe KeyGen and a closely coded virus.      "
,queeniegyt1,2011-10-06T01:25Z,downloaded this and guess what virus open it etc and my computer was fucked up people stay away from this you have been warned . as for yous calling people noobs for the anti virus showing up for the keygen you download it set it up and fucked your computer up 
,Piroc,2011-10-06T18:05Z,"Cojon you are obviously an intellectual guy who who seems to knows what he's talking about. Thanx for that story of info, I'm about to try Panda Cloud now!"
