[V],RobbingHood,2010-03-01T00:01Z,"@black47

You're welcome, and enjoy Norton. Probably this is the last upgraded version of 2010, since many upgrades passed by already."
,jediamit,2010-03-01T17:59Z,"Hey mate RH, can u please EARTHDESK frm xericdesign dot com. its a beautiful program. thanks"
,knkknk,2010-03-02T09:50Z," I didn't face any problem using the v2.5 with the latest engine which is 17.5.0.127? so which kind of problems does this release fix ? 

else, thanks for your gr8 work "
,brianxxx,2010-03-02T23:09Z,"I had some problems with 2.5 and NIS 2010 v17.5.0.127.

In some instances of test machines, the rest technically worked if I upgraded to v17.5. In other cases, direct install of v17.5 then using the 2.5 crack was a 80/20 deal. 80% it worked but when it didn't it was not bad, but not great. Like NIS was running but the icon was not in the task bar or sometimes would crash. "
,knkknk,2010-03-03T03:37Z,"basically I applied the crack on the previous version which is I think 17.1.0.19 and then updated via live updated to the current version .. tested on xp sp3 machine and vista sp2 machine ..both are working without a problem .. so I think the only way for there issued to happen is when you apply it to the final version .. not the previous ones .. thanks for the clarification brianxxx ... 

regards // "

,ocyrus70,2010-03-06T16:41Z,"gorean,  microsoft gave an update which is giving norton problems for me on 7 i keep getting info window saying norton 360 is not compatible with this version of windows.. microsoft do know and are working on this issue maybe it's part of the same bug and is not norton internet security or 360 v4!!.."
,figster505,2010-03-09T23:59Z,"Works, many thanks RH"
,locobans,2010-03-10T22:09Z,"Install on windows 7 32/64 bit correctly.

Updates and everything. 165 days remaining...one question what should I do once it expire after 165 days... re install?

Thanks (Y)"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-03-11T20:20Z,"@locobans

Before Norton expires just run the NTR again; that's kind of logical."

,moulican,2010-03-13T16:50Z,*****many thanks RH. TOP MAN! It does what it says on the tin*****
,g0tvtec,2010-03-14T08:44Z,"first of all thx for this.. we really do appreciate it!! one question though. if i currently have 250 days left on my NIS that I purchased a while back, can I just download the NTR and use it to reset the NIS that is already installed on my pc?"
,locobans,2010-03-15T18:59Z,"@RobbingHood 

Thanks...that did made some sense ^_^"
,crepesdrapes,2010-03-17T21:39Z,"Thank you very much for this,works perfect."
[T],MelloYello,2010-03-21T08:50Z,Why am i only getting 15 days instead of the 165?  I purged the old norton internet security that expired and installed like the instructions said but only have 15 days.  I followed all the steps so what am I missing?
,lolnoobyostk,2010-03-22T07:47Z,tyvm man 75 seeders god dam i cant get that any day i finsishd it in 1 min usally it takes like god dam 10 min for anything like this
,ocyrus70,2010-03-22T19:49Z,"gorean, see what your saying and you never know right plus i always like to try new internet securitys and then i buy it norton 360 2years for ?25..thats a good price remember when this software was 60? for 1year thats the great thing about pirate bay, vendors had to drop the price if it wasn't for torrents the price of music and movies,software would still be a sky high thats the side of torrents and pirate bay we don't hear about!!.."
,g0tvtec,2010-03-22T21:08Z,"ocyrus - where can I find it for $25 for 2 years? renewing my norton for 1 year costs $50. it costs $69 for buy it brand new.

Your info is MISLEADING"

,torrentaddictp,2010-03-31T12:18Z,"robbinghood u completely rock man...this is a nice upload.

@gorean 
Norton in India costs 950-1000 bucks...thats around 22$. in thailand it costs around 700 bahts i.e. 20$. the lowest i think. It's true it all depends on the region it's being sold."

Spy is just a troll, so ignore him. For an ""administrator account"" you should go to your bank and open an account using the name ""administrator"". Google has a few other explanations, so try google too, just to be sure."

,dnice215215,2010-04-06T04:17Z,HEY ROBBINGHOOD.....THANX FOR ALL THE TORRENTZ....ID LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION....CAN U GIVE ME SOME INPUT ON YOUR HONEST OPINION ON WHAT U THINK THE ABSOLUTE BEST ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE OUT THEIR IS...I HAVE A HP PAVILION LAPTOP WITH A WIN 7 64 BIT OPERATING SYSTEM...PLEASE RESPOND ...I TRUST YOUR OPINION!!!!
,SkillZ112,2010-04-06T20:13Z,@xamoj all you have to do now is run the NTR file and follow the instructions now. after you've done that it should be at 165 days 
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-07T03:42Z,"@dnice215215 

It all depends on your needs but there's no such thing as ""the best"", no matter what it is.
AV software with good reputations are:

1. Norton 
2. Avast! 
3. Avira
4. AVG 
5. Kaspersky 
6. NOD32 AV

What's most known from Norton is that they have one of the most advanced firewalls along with other features."
,kvttt,2010-04-07T22:24Z,"Everything worked great.

Only thing I'm wondering is that in the ""read me"" file, it said that after I'm connected to the internet, an error should pop up.. but I don't see one.

So I'm going to just ignore that...

10/10!!"

I would agree with most of these except you left off Trend Micro, Panda and Bit Defender.  And I would never put AVG in the top AV's, even the paid version.  Norton at #1, i would disagree with you there as well, since Norton isn't ranked #1 on any review that I have ever seen.  Check these sites out and you will find the top 10 AV's of 2010.

But none the less its a good list to go off of anyways

"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-08T18:17Z,"@jblack110 

My list is just in random order. And screw rankings, cause all are different."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-09T02:12Z,"BTW: My list is basicly based on popularity. When looking at that Trend and Panda definitely are less popular, and probably BD also. "
,brianxxx,2010-04-12T01:44Z,"To be fair...I would not trust any of the reviews at TOP TEN period. They just do not do pro level reviews. Best to trust a more reliable, in depth source, like Virus Bulletin or any source quoting, referring to Virus Bulletin.They are pretty much THE gold standard for AV reviews..it is ALL they do and focus on and are independent."
,g0tvtec,2010-04-12T10:18Z,"RobbingHood pls answer my question =)

if i currently have 250 days left on my NIS that I purchased a while back, can I just download the NTR and use it to reset the NIS that is already installed on my pc? "
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-15T00:03Z,"@g0tvtec 

Your question has already been answered by ""gorean"". 

For your information: the NTR gives 165 days of subscription, so you can appy the NTR once your own 250 days are about expiring. You don't need to be a wizkid to think of that, but if you can count it all makes perfectly sense, doesn't it ...

Now please post two hamburgers: one for gorean and one for me, with a vanilla milkshake large. Oh yeah, and also two QP please. From Mac please, no Burger King crap."
,st78,2010-04-15T13:08Z,"Hi RobbingHood, Thx for the great work as always! I've been using your uploads for years now and never had any problems :) If you dont mind could you give me a little advice.
I've just bought a new top of the range laptop and all it came with is McAfee, It was a 15mth subscription free with laptop. Should I ditch it and go with something like this? Last Norton I had was 360 v2 and it slowed down my desktop.
Im also after a good AntiSpyware, I used to use XoftSpy (removed a few things other wouldn't) but it is shocking on cookies! I download HEAPS so need a good combo. Iv'e read you fav lists but they were from early 09 so wondering if you have any updates? Im running windows 7 so need something compatible with it. Thanks heaps in advance and keep up the good work :)"
[V],maestral,2010-04-15T14:20Z,"Must say, WORKING LIKE A CHARM. Just read instructions, they are more than easily explained."
,g0tvtec,2010-04-17T11:19Z,"sorry but mcdonalds sucks =X

how about some in n out

anyways I thought of that but thought, hey what if Norton won't let members use a trial after their subscription is expiring. i wouldnt be surprised... those greedy bastards"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-17T22:19Z,"@st78 

At my account you can find several antivirus and antispyware programs, all up-to-date. The decision is yours, casue it all depends on your needs and wishes."

As long as you're hungry it doesn't matter which hamburger you get. Now who's gonna post me that hamburger, cause I'm hungry?"

The Avira 2009 trial resetter at my account also works for Avira 2010, as far as I know. Most of my other av torrents are up-to-date, as stated."
,spanky34,2010-04-20T18:14Z,The NTR works for the 2011 Beta that just came out as well.  Just used it and now have 180 days.
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-20T19:29Z,"@spanky34 

Thnx for the info; good to know. Each year Norton (beta) is released earlier, so maybe in januari 2011 Norton 2012 will be released. lol 

BTW: The NTR 2.6 is not tested yet on NIS 17.6 since it's just available through updating."

Everything went fine. Great torrent!"
,luxor9,2010-04-23T13:12Z,"@RobbingHood

I found out that NIS 17.6 automatic remove N* IP.. That's why automatic popup N* Account.

so anyone got idea to block it way?"

,100bugs,2010-06-08T09:12Z,"Hi RH

Only 2 simple questions:

Question 1
Is the firewall still working at the end of the trial period (when not reset)?

For now, the firewall is the only part I want from NIS and if it keeps working after the trial period then I will not need to reset it.

Question 2
Can the trialReset be used more than one time?

Thanbks"
