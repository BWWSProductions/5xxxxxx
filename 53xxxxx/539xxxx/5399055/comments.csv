Maybe it's just foobar2k but I had to fix the VBR headers on California and Disco Volante to display the proper track duration.  :)"

,BingoGuy,2011-07-11T09:24Z,"About the tags. I was using a great old player called ""media monkey"". I used it because iTunes was slow for me at the time and that thing boasted fast speeds with a library of over 100,000 songs. The new iTunes is far more compatible with more music, so these songs are tagged correctly for MediaMonkey and Windows Media Player.

In iTunes, they are simple to fix. Nugg explains."
