Mr. Bungle is an "Avant-Garde Alt. Metal" group from Eureka California, hens the name of their final album. Mr. Bungle released 4 demo tapes and 3 complete studio albums. The band was initially started by Mike Patton, Trey Spruance, Trevor Dunn, Jed watts, and Theo Lengyel. They were high-school buddies who released their first demo tape "The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny" in 1986.

This torrent includes every single recorded song by Mr. Bungle (with the exception of some covers and live recordings) The .zip file conceals the following:

Other:

     Covers................................(1979-2004)


The covers album includes a bunch of Mr. Bungle's most popular covers including "The Super Mario Brothers Theme." I threw that together myself from the "Caca VolantÃ«" (an old Mr. Bungle fansite) when it still existed. the covers album does not include "Hit Me Baby One More Time" BECAUSE IT IS NOT ACTUALLY BY MR. BUNGLE. It's actually done by "The Ping-Pang Band" and they certainly deserve credit for such wonderful works.

Just extract the .zip file to get your music. All files are in high-quality .mp3's and tagged correctly. (I made sure of that) The .zip file password is as follows:
