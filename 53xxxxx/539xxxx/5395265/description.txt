John Payne, Lizabeth Scott and Dan Duryea star in this western rife with McCarthy era subtext (Durye's villain is even named Mc Carthy ) and strongly influenced by High Noon. Duryea rides into town, claiming to be a U.S. Marshall with a warrant for the arrest of sheriff and model citizen Payne. With little actual evidence to support his charge of murder, Duryea embarks on a campaign of guilt by suspicion, while Payne tries to protect his reputation and his freedom. Made late in the career of the prolific Hollywood veteran Allan Dwan, Silver Lode was given high regard by Martin Scorsese in his A Personal Journey Through American Movies.
