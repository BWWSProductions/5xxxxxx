,AzatiPrime,2010-03-01T08:50Z,Great upload!  A big thank you to everyone involved.  I've been waiting for a good quality with english subs for awhile.
,HD-Troll,2010-12-10T18:07Z,"I think it's the sound-stream 5.1 AC3 is why it's 1.3 GB, I took the 700mb version, thank you."
,Tuppy,2011-09-15T16:51Z,"anyone find any better subs?

,Tuppy,2011-09-15T16:55Z,I just checked these subs http://subscene.com/english/Rec-2/subtitle-350400.aspx and they seem to work better. The example I gave before isn't present in these subs.

a few parts in those subs appear to be a little messed up too. don't think as bad though. "
