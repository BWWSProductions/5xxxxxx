      1933.  Writer, Janette Jones Parker, has booked a room in  
      Platte  City,  Missouri  to write her next novel. The Red  
      Crown  Tavern  was  once  a hideout for infamous outlaws,  
      Bonnie  and  Clyde,  and Janette is shocked to discover a  
      notebook,  which  Bonnie  had  used as her adventure log!  
      Travel  the  United  States on the tracks of two infamous  
      outlaws,  and  rummage  through  their  haunts:  a bar, a  
      hotel,  a  refugee camp, and of course, banks, all decked  
      out  in  '30s style. Can you help Janette to decipher the  
      strange message left by Bonnie during her journey?
