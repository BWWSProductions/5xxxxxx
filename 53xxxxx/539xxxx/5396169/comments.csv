EZTV and VTV constantly miss episodes of JonStewart/Colbert. You have made my day with this. 

Please continue to upload these if it is at all humanly possible. Don't make me beg..."
,kave786,2010-02-27T11:59Z,"in the 5/6 years i have been downloading vtv daily & colbert shows .. vtv has missed maybe one or 2 episodes (some may be a day or 2 late, but are eventually posted)
VTV should be thanked and appreciated!! ..

However i would really like to thank cenkota for keeping it going when vtv missed this week ..
EKOLB usually posts them when vtv is late, but for some reason they both mssed them this week

Much appreciated Cenkota, for not letting us miss a very important show!!
People need to be informed of the hypocracy and lies that other media simply regurgitate from these corrupt politicians and businesses!!! "
,greencalx,2010-02-27T13:45Z,VTV have been fine for weeks.  Without them you can see how difficult it is to get hold of these shows.
[T],Elbart,2010-02-27T15:26Z,"For the seventrillionth time, VTV/EZTV are not releasing anything.

They distribute (not making!) scene releases. When there are no scene releases of TDS/TCR, they cannot and will not distribute anything.

Is that so hard to understand? "

,brandi208,2010-02-28T13:01Z,thank you!!! :)

Calm down. I don't give a shit about the distinction between who releases and who distributes.  That's for people like you to worry about.  Understand?"
,monkybizzz,2010-03-03T00:32Z,"Clearly there are people who prefer the lower resolution provided by EZTV/VTV, for hardware or filesize reasons. However there are a lot of people who prefer HD. But for some reason the Daily Show and Colbert haven't been available in HD on the trackers I have access to. 

I hope you keep releasing these 544p releases of Colbert and Daily Show, the extra resolution really shows, and the file size is still small, it's the same size as a one hour show in SD."
