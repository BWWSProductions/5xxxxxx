The second feature from writer-director Park Chan Ok, Paju was the opening film of the 39th Rotterdam International Film Festival, making it the first Korean film to have such an honor. Park, who garnered great acclaim for her debut Jealousy Is My Middle Name in 2002, confirms her status as one of Korea's best rising directors with her outstanding sophomore effort. Winner of the NETPAC Award at the 14th Pusan Film Festival, the film takes its title from its setting, Paju, a gritty suburb outside Seoul with a strong military presence and conflicted politics that subtly come into play in the film. Talented young actress Seo Woo (Crush and Blush) delivers an anguished, nuanced performance as a young woman in love with her activist brother-in-law (Lee Seon Gyun, Romantic Island), whom she suspects killed her sister (Shim Yi Young). Their complex relationship of love and hate, doubt and dependence, anchors the nonlinear story which gradually reveals the characters' tense pasts and deep ties.
