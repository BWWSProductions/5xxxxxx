We're 5 months into the Record Club project now, and it's time for our third installment. 

This one took place last June when Wilco was in town for the release of their new eponymous album. 

They came by after a long day filming a TV appearance and still managed to put down 8 songs with us. 

Jamie Lidell was in the studio with me working on his new record. Leslie Feist happened to be in town 

editing her documentary and heard we were all getting together. Recording took place at Sunset Sound 

Studios in the room where the Stones did a lot of Exile On Main Street (and looking at the records on the 

walls it appeared that the Doobie Brothers recorded most of their output there too). Sitting in on drums, 

we had James Gadson, who's played on most of the Bill Withers records and on songs like 'Express 

Yourself' and 'I Will Survive.' Jeff Tweedy's son Spencer played played additional drums. Also, Brian 

Lebarton, from the last two Record Club sessions is back. 

The record chosen this time was Skip Spence's 'Oar.' Running sequentially, the first song up is "Little 

Hands". Our friend Danny Kalb engineered. 

Cripple Creek: Jamie takes the lead and Gadson gets behind the kit, while Beck and Brian back them up 

on this bare bones take on Skip Spence's Cripple Creek.

Weighted Down: Feist takes the lead this week with Nels Cline arpeggiating some ridiculous 64th notes 

on a toy guitar.

Book of Moses: Gadson lays down the heaviest RC beat ever, while Jamie loops his voice into a voice 

army and Brian plays some kind of octagon shaped synth.

Dixie Peach Promenade: This week Jeff takes the lead with his son Spencer stepping behind the kit.

Record Club is an informal meeting of various musicians to record an album in a day. The album chosen 

to be reinterpreted is used as a framework. Nothing is rehearsed or arranged ahead of time. A track is 

put up here once a week. As you will hear, some of the songs are rough renditions, often first takes that 

document what happened over the course of a day as opposed to a polished rendering. There is no 

intention to 'add to' the original work or attempt to recreate the power of the original recording. Only to 

play music and document what happens. And those who aren't familiar with the albums in question will 

hopefully look for the songs in their definitive versions.

====================

This torrent includes the original .mp4 video files posted on Beck's vimeo.com site 

(http://www.vimeo.com/videotheque). They were ripped with clipnabber.com and are the original files 

uploaded by Beck, not the vimeo stream, not the vimeo re-encode.

The flac and mp3's, therefore, are clean rips from the best possible available source (the original mp4 

videos) and are not sourced from the vimeo stream or the re-encoded / compressed vimeo files.

Enjoy this in the highest quality available until Beck officially releases it, if he does.
