[V],polisdavid,2010-02-27T18:45Z,"Mine was ""precracked"" but I'll, upload my preference file for you."
,zogulusnig,2010-02-28T05:15Z,"So, this worked like a charm, right ""out of the box"".

It asked for a registration key the first time it was opened, by you can put - literally - any number in there, and it works.

Personally, I used ""1234"" and hit the 'register' button.  All is well, and the app says ""Registered to: ."" at the bottom of the main window.

I dunno why it says it's registered to a period, but it works just fine and doesn't ask for a key, or complain in any way.

Thanks!"
