   * Create Disk Image Backups, While Running Windows             
    The Backup process will back up all your data into a single    
     file, containing all data, including system data and           
     registry, for total security, should your computer ever        
     crash.                                                         
     There is no restart (to DOS) necessary. Ever.                  
     * Continue your work, while the Backup is in progress          
     The new Snapshot technology ensures that all data are          
      consistent, and reflect the PC's data at the start of backup.   
      There are no difficulties with opened files. Ever.              
      This enables a very fast and easy way to back up servers and    
      other computers, that must run 24 hours a day.                  
      * Easy Use and Restore of single Files or directories           
      Drive Snapshot creates a virtual drive, containing all your     
      drive's data. You may use, compare, or restore these files      
      directly from the Disk Image file.                              
     This works with any program of your choice, including (of       
      course) the Windows Explorer                                     
     * Complete Restore of a disk in case of Disaster                 
      If a disk is restored to its original state, it will be          
       exactly the same as at the time of Backup - byte for byte.     
    Restoring a system partition will require DOS; other drives    
      can be restored using Windows                                   
     * Compatible with all Windows file systems (FAT16, FAT32,      
   NTFS)

     After more than seven years of supporting the scene with       
     quality releases, ACME is proud to break the barrier of        
     6000 releases, more than 4000 of them being keymakers.         
                                                                    
                                                                    
      As you may have noticed we always try our best to keep a high   
      level of quality. Therefore we do not take part in mass         
      releasing like midnight-mu-races or converter/ripper-shareware, 
      which gets released from different vendors with same look,      
      funtionality, version number and of course same serial over and 
      over. We tend to care for quality before quantity.              
                                                                      
     Finally we would like to thank our hardworking members, friends 
      and all people, who are affiliated to us.

    ACME can not be held responsible for any unlawful actions based on 
     or in conjunction with any of its releases. The enduser has to   
      decide whether to download, install, and use a release or not.   
      Software engineers have to spend a lot of time developing their 
    programs to improve their products in order to get new custo-  
    mers and to make a living. If you acquire one of our releases not  
    just for testing purposes but for everyday usage, we strongly  
      advise you to buy the software to support the authors!
