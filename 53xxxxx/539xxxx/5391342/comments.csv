I will help you with the upload ( at least 2.0 Ratio).
great job mate ;-) "
,LingvoX3,2010-03-01T17:55Z,"Thanks, any help is greatly appreciated! :-) I'm on 10Mbps connection, but 85GB is still not a pushover."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-03-02T14:27Z,"Perfect picture quality:

You guys who don't have enough space(not even on an External hard disk),
why don't you just download the files one by one ( 6-7.5 GB)?
Very generous peers so far, in 24 hours I got 32% of both torrents. My Ratio is about 1.1 but I will make it to 2.0 as promised. AVE !"

Thanks!

But next time save screenshots as PNGs. :-) JPEG compression does no justice to them. ;-)"
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-03-02T18:27Z,"""JPEGs are for photographs and realistic images. PNGs are for line art, text-heavy images, and images with few colors.""

""JPEG images are smaller due to more efficient compression, and (usually) higher quality, since they are 24 bit color.""

-------------------------------------------------------

On a 56K modem, an average JPEG will download in 1.6 seconds, the PNG will take more than 30 seconds. 

about 98% of the high resolution photos on the web are jpeg & jpg. Doing so we upload 10 x less in size and image hosts are thankful to us for it.

Here I took an other snap shot of the same frame and saved it in pgn , 10 times bigger in size(2.5 MB) then jpeg:

If next time you post your snap shots (in your fav format) then nobody will post the ""JPEG-s that do not justice to them..."""
,LingvoX3,2010-03-02T23:20Z,"> If next time you post your snap shots

I would, but there are some in the thread on rutracker.org I gave a link too. :-)

And no need to get mad, buddy. ;-)"
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-03-03T14:54Z,"I had a look in the logger to see the blocked ip-s and I found an ip from a university of a country with superfast internet.

I deleted that range of ip-s from ipfilter then in a minute magic happens; this peer uploaded 3 - 5.5 MB/s to me! He alone lowered my ratio from 1.4 to 0.9 in just an hour, lol.

It's worth checking the torrent client's logger (utorrent in my case) because many university's ip's with 10-20 MB/s (or more?) internet are blocked in the ipfilter. cheers"
