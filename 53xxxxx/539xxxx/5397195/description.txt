    In the frozen wilderness of Antarctica, where oceans ice over and        
    just staying alive is an achievement, one creature has perfected the     
    art of survival - the emperor penguin. Emperor penguins are sublimely    
    built to conquer the cold - but in a world threatened by climate         
    change, can they take the heat? Using Crittercam, scientists take a      
    virtual ride under the ice with the emperor penguin to study the         
    impact of climate change on the penguin's world.
