Alex welcomes back to the show Nigel Farage, British politician, former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, and member of the European Parliament for the South East. Farage faces an official reprimand by the European Parliament for criticizing its president Herman Van Rompuy on Wednesday.

Alex also talks with John Young, webmaster of Cryptome, a website that covers news on freedom of speech, cryptography, spying, and surveillance. The ISP Network Solutions shuttered Young's site earlier in the week after he posted a document summarizing Microsoft's dealings with law enforcement agencies. Microsoft has since withdrawn a Digital Millennium Copyright complaint and Cryptome is once again live.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
