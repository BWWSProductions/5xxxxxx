...continuing from last week, Elise, still roped up by the neck to the ceiling and standing on her tip toes in spite of her book, has just been caned before her feeding. While she works to pull herself together for dinner I go to fetch her meal. Oceans of slobber run out of her double gagged mouth and fully coat the whole of her torso. She's doing her best to suck it up. I spill her spaghetti noodles into the dog bowl positioned in front of her tippy toe feet and then pour sauce onto them. She's made to wait until the noodles have become cold before she can eat. And since she has a little time to kill waiting on that food to get cold her book is taken away from her. Immediately she begins to choke. Her feet are arched as high as she can get them as she coughs through her gag and tries to free her airway. That's when I flog her nipples -and I mean hard. She tries to dance away from it but the rope is to taunt around her neck, her movement too restricted. She cries. A long string of slobber seems to be permanently affixed from her gagged mouth to her chest, swinging all the time as she tries her best to get away from me. She just screams now. Blood curling screams. She even stopped trying to get away, resigned to her predicament...
