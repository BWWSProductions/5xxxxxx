For 40 days,40 kids took the challenge,to build the first ever 'Kid Nation' in the ghost town,Bonzana.They face many challenges along the way.They all divide up into four district teams,and have their own leaders.The district leaders make up the town council,and make the choices in what happen.
The challenges were interesting to watch along with the voting for the gold stars. Obviously the older kids were focused on a bit more but even they had something to contribute to the show. There seemed to be a few stereotypes in the town also...the brat, the brain, the idiot, the wise guy, 
The only show of it's kind and it is fun and interesting to watch! enjoy lcpj
