Pretty good quality. 

I did not rip this, and I don't remember where I found it originally. 




Video: XVID, 23.976 FPS, res 688x512

Audio: MP3 (320kbps CBR), 48khz




The audio was originally an AC3 track -- I converted it to MP3 for higher 
compatibility. I did not re-encode the video, it was left alone. 







Remember to seed folks!
