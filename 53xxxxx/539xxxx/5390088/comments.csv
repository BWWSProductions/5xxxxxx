,joshcole2032,2010-02-27T01:14Z,"what player did you use to play it, its not working on any of my players"
,jayski2008,2010-02-27T03:59Z,Its 3d but the pic is of its red to one side and blu to the other. Anyway to fix it?
,zodrakn,2010-02-27T11:11Z,"Use VLC player, this its for anaglyph glasses red/cyan"
,iGLGred,2010-02-27T15:48Z,"Is this just a 2d to 3D conversion, or the anaglyph version of the film?"
,theone_nr,2010-02-27T18:36Z,Guys take a look on description : Avatar DVD Scr 3D_zodrakn.avi.avi !!! =)))) If is not a fake is just a renamed stolen upload ! Get a life Dude =)))))))
,zodrakn,2010-02-27T18:57Z,"Yes, it is a conversion from 2D to 3D made by me"

,Win7Act,2010-02-28T03:15Z,SO FAKE  !!!!!
,wolf_ink,2010-03-01T14:19Z,"fair effort, not worth the DL though ... 3D effects way to heavy making it literally painfull on the eyes to try & watch, a brave attemp @ a conversion but it hasn't paid off on this occassion ... best to wait for a 1st gen release "
,unsharp,2010-03-03T13:32Z,"=NOT REAL 3D=

This, as most of you may rightfully suspect, is NOT a real 3D movie. It's not even a 3D conversion. Yes, it's red/green anaglyph (so you need those special red/green or red/cyan glasses, which I have), but it's simply the same 2D DVD screener that is circulating everywhere else (and it has the same skips and jumps at the beginning and around the one hour mark as well), anaglyphed to look like a flat 2D image floating about half an inch inside the screen. To make absolutely certain, a quick closer examination shows easily that both near, medium distance and faraway objects are displaced by exactly the same amount, making for zero parallax difference, which means no difference in depth.

Now, either zodrakn is an idiot, or he simply does not understand the concept of how anaglyph (or indeed any other kind of) 3D works. You'll be better off with any other ""non-3D"" version out there. Thank you zodrakn for wasting my time."
,pipopik,2010-03-06T02:03Z,"@unsharp you are very right.
Most people don't seem to know you can easely do this yourself with any 2d source, with a simple script and stereoscopicplayer, on the fly, realtime. Or with tridef player if you have it. The technique relies on motion and/or time shifting a 2d-source into an artificial 3d effect. "
,ProphetZarquon,2010-03-31T20:41Z,"Agreed, skip this download and watch it in 2D, watch it in theatres, or go shoot your own true polarized capture and post it here!

Read the description!  It clearly states that you need Red/Blue anaglyph glasses, not that this is true 3D anyway, just handmade cutout effects.

You can't watch this with RealD glasses.  In fact RealD glasses are useless outside the theatre unless you are viewing a screen (silver screen with dual filtered-light projectors) that produces polarized light.

Home 3D displays are using double framerate video (yes, 100-120Hz, sometimes even 200Hz), and synchronized left-then-right LCD-blanking glasses that block one eye then the other for 3D viewing.  I've got a pair for my PC from 1996.  It's nothing special or new, and hardly worth the premiums they expect to charge for both content and hardware.

The one thing 3D BluRay should be good for, is ripping seperate left/right frames and producing anaglyph 3D (red/blue) from the merged video.

Recording a polarized (RealD 3D) feature with one camera would be pointless.  Just as a standard television/HDTV/pc-monitor cannot reproduce polarized light, neither can a single camera, lacking a polarized filter, capture the polarization properties of the light entering it's lens.  You'll need two cameras, one using a left polarized filter (like from the glasses), the other a right.

Anyone know if RealD 3D uses circular, left, right, 270-degree, etc?  I can experiment myself using a few lab filters, but maybe I'm a bit lazy.

Why doesn't anyone shoot 3d using two cameras on a frame, each shooting through one filter cannibalized from the left & right lenses on RealD 3D glasses?

Seems offhand (granted I'm no expert on shooting Theatre Screeners) that this would be the way of the future for ripping 3D features before they get to BluRay.   Use seperate Left & Right recordings, check to ensure proper sync, then edit the red or blue out of each track & merge them as a 50/50 overlay to create an anaglyph version for average users viewing at home.  You could also keep the original 2up files for viewing on custom dual projection rigs, or create homemade 3D BluRay files for viewing on special ($7000) 3D-HDTVs.

All this mucking about with adding 3D effects to a 2D recording is a waste of time.  Yes you can watch it with Red/Blue anaglyph glasses, but it won't look like anything but cardboard cutouts."
