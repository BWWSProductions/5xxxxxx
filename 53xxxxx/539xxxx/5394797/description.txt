 Product Description
 This textbook provides a thorough treatment of all the central topics in public
 economics. Aimed at senior undergraduate and graduate students, it will also be
 invaluable to professional economists and to those teaching in the field. The
 book is entirely self-contained, giving all the equilibrium theory and welfare
 economics needed to understand the analyses. The author covers the Arrow-Debreu
 economy, welfare economics and the measurement of inequality and poverty which
 lay the foundations and emphasise the important role played by information.
 Within the competitive economy, he examines commodity taxation, income taxation
 and tax reform in a certain environment. He goes on to study the public economics
 of uncertainty, and then treats public goods, externalities, imperfect competition
 and tax evasion as departures from the standard competitive assumptions and looks
 at their implication for public economics derived.
