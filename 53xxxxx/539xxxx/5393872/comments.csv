Thank you so much for this cenkota!!!"

EZTV doesn't have The Daily Show anymore either. They probably got it from vtv. Maybe the problem is with the Olympics? I see a lot of Olympics related torrents these days, and it's probably the same people behind them as is behind the ""regular"" ups."

EZTV and VTV constantly miss episodes of JonStewart/Colbert. You have made my day with this. 

Please continue to upload these if it is at all humanly possible. Don't make me beg..."
