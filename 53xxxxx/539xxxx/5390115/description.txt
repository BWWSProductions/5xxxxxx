                               PLAYBACK INFO:

PLAYBACK XBOX 360: Tested running Windows 7 streaming on the network through 
Windows Media Center. Extension (MKV, M2TS) streaming available. Also, files over 4GB are able to stream fine but I prefer it 4GB to stream through my DVR problem free.

PLAYBACK PS3 : Not to familiar with this but I would think if streaming through Windows Media Center it should work the same way as XBOX360 or use tsMuxer to remux as a m2ts file. 

Playback PC : I suggest DivX7 Player as they now support mkv streaming for XBOX360 and PS3. Download here - http://www.divx.com/en/windows-7
