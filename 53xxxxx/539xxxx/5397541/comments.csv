Thanks for the encode/upload.

Really delighted that this has made it onto your schedule, long may it last.

That means all you downloaders SEED!!!!!

Cheers
Jon

P.S. Holding off on this until EOD 6 has finised seeding to 4:1 at my end.
P.P.S. That is what seeding and not limiting means people. I also do not have the UP speed required to join the initial seeds. PLEASE read 20-40's notes."
