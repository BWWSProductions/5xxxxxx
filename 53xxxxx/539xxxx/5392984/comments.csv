,Arkanoid808,2010-02-26T01:05Z,"Thanks for the upload!

And to the guys above...splitting files into lots of .rar's is the best way to upload becuase if the person downloading finds that their download has become corrupted somehow (bad RAM/power cut/torrent client error etc) then they only need to re-download the part that was corrupted and not the whole file. "
,solamande,2010-02-26T02:17Z,Well that makes sense. Thanks Arkanoid.
