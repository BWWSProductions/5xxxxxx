"We are here to remind you that pain and fear are not the only methods of growth; that you can more elegantly grow through joy and love. . . that you create your own reality . . . that there is a God/Goddess/All That Is who loves you, who knows your name. . . and that you love good enough"   â€”  Lazaris

Splendor can abound. Our majesty and magnificence, our personal greatness, the honorable and noble of our character, and the unrealized of our wisdom, intimacy, passion and inspiration: All can abound when we unlock the secrets of our Sacred Self. Our magic can deepen, and the texture of our lives can become richer as the very fabric of our being begins with the sacred.

This Evening with Lazaris, truly a working of magic, set the stage with preparation: What is the sacred? What are the sources of the sacred in our lives? Lazaris illuminates that stage with his step-by-step description of The Ritual of Sacred Awakening. This powerful working of magic culminates with an enchanting meditation where Lazaris works the Sacred Awakening ritual with us.
