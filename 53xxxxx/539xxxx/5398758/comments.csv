[V],MKVGuy,2010-02-28T12:12Z,"no 'quaternio' not yet, not even planning to, for notifications you can use RSS functionality.."
,newkastle,2010-02-28T18:02Z,"thanksss ,mkvguy,was waiting for yor upload as htey are always great ones"
,Bobbie619,2010-03-01T02:47Z,"Hey MKVGuy, i Love you torrents!! 

Thanks so much. is there anyway to contact you to ask what movies i want you to upload? or is this the only way?

Anyway, THANKS"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-03-01T05:11Z,"yes this is the only place or PM at ET.. but it takes a lot of time for me to post the requests as I have limited and slow bandwidth, still have 6gig to download which will take me a week, I always try to post the new once as soon as possible.."
,HeadlessFrog,2010-03-03T02:56Z,How do you make it so it shows the srt file which correct me if im wrong but thats the subtitle file isnt it? im watching it on my computer would like to know how to burn it dvd as well please...
[V],MKVGuy,2010-03-03T03:38Z,"yes its the subtitle file, media players recognize them when named same as the file name of the video..
I believe you want to burn the video with subtitles in a DVD? please use ConvertXtoDVD which is all in 1 solution for burning any format on DVD.
With the help of this software you can burn 3-4 movies of my rips in one DVD with good quality..
you can find the software on TPB itself.. hope it works for you..
n joy.."
,HeadlessFrog,2010-03-03T04:57Z,Ok thanks great movie btw.
