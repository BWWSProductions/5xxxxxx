Installed this on my W7 machine,- 3 newer HDD. Changed to pro mode. Says my HDDs are not SMART supported: Temperature function not supported."

You need to have SMART enabled in your BIOS for the software to work. Let me know if that helps!"

The single display is a bit of a bugger, but it's a novelty to flick through my running PC's on the network feature to have a looksie at the temps ect.

Any Idea how to get it to check the raid controller on my server, it's an Adaptec Serial ATA II HostRAID 1420SA PCI-X Controller on a precision 670 running 7 x64 and says not supported. As far as I can see SMART is enabled in all checkable places including the controller program in bios, this is the only important one and I would like to know when the hard drive's are ready to fry an egg for my breakfast!

Same prob as ex_pat3 I s'pose, these are SATA II drives so very up to date and as the controller looks for them on boot up it gives you a short SMART report so Adaptec can read the info. I wonder what it does with it?

Thanks anyway, good prog."

sounds like bios update for your motherboard is needed
check for newer versions "
