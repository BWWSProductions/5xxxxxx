First and foremost:
- This is my first torrent, be nice! I am open to any constructive critique!
- I am not the original maker of these keygens and/or scripts.
- I do not CLAIM to be the original maker of these keygens and/or scripts.
- I am NOT responsible for the usability or blah blah blah.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secondly:
- I hope you find these two programs useful, I have included:
-- Active@ Hard Disk Monitor Corporate v1.3.95
-- HDD Life Pro - v3.1.157 (vista-7 64)
-- HDD Life Pro - v3.1.157 (xp)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thirdly:
- These are compressed via RAR files. Do not ask how to unzip them as I will already have told you if you read one more sentence!

- Download WinRAR Here: http://rarlabs.com/download.htm (If you don't know what a computer is, download the x86 version to be safe)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fourth:
- I do not recommend using HDD Life. I downloaded it for initial use for Windows 7 64bit, and could not find a patch that would work. After you patch the program, unless you are running XP, the program would normally just crash. Compatibility options/run as admin, all combinations did not work. I tried!

- I DID however find an old cracked file for HDD Life 2.9.+, so after I installed v3.1.+, I used the patch file for 2.9 and it DID work for 7-64 and XP-32 flawlessly...except it would crash randomly (couple hours of use). This is the ultimate reason I got frustrated and looked for a better program.

- After that mess, I found "Active HDD Monitor Corp ...blah". The program is tested and DOES work on 7-64 and XP-32. 

- The reason I personally recommend this program (Active HDD) is: 
1) Stability!,
2) You can add networked computers (or even comps online) to your list and view that computers HDDs status alongside your own,
3) It can e-mail you incase of a critial problem, provided you have an SMTP server, 4) Mainly big thing for me was #2.

- The only thing I did not like about (Active HDD) is:
1) You cannot configure the tray to show multiple icons for each drive. (Not a big deal)

Lastly:
- I hope you found what you were looking for, I searched for a couple days to come up with this, and although it isn't much, I hope it helps someone out there!

- Take care,
- Ryan
