I also included Trilogy of the Fallen as 3 seperate PDFs and also altogether 
in a condensed PDF as well. You can delete what you dont need although I also included the source files if you want to call them that, the ones I used to reconstitute the pdfs in case you can improve on them. But you prolly wont need to all of them are flawless except a few pages which were just blank since I couldn't save them. And this was only of Fear to Tread and Earthbound but its all there just the format is a bit off is all but still readable on only those 2. Again all the others are fine. HEard there are more books out there and would like to have those myself if any of you have a copy post here or msg me on hamachi network name jbx9 password is jbx. Take care~ P.S. Hope you like this Tracie heres to a new addiction. (I hope =P)
