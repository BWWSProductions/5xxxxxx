,dingos81,2010-02-28T16:29Z,"i unpacked everything to a folder on my desktop and went to run MGEgui, but it almost immediately told me this:

MGEgui has stopped working.

i have Vista. what do i need to do?"
,mypaxep,2010-02-28T18:19Z,That's odd. Try running it in XP compatibility mode or disabling antivirus software. Also make sure that it unpacked correctly.
,dingos81,2010-02-28T23:07Z,i tried unpacking it again and got the same message. i'm not well with computers; what does it mean to run in XP compatibility mode?
,mypaxep,2010-03-01T06:59Z,Right click -> Properties -> Compatibility -> Run this program in compatible mode for Windows XP
,mypaxep,2010-03-01T07:13Z,"Alternatively, you can try redownloading it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/morrgraphext/ and unpacking to game directory."
,remorsechaos,2010-03-07T21:52Z,"I'm having the same issue with the MGEgui.exe; it immediately stops working. I tried doing what someone else suggested, downloading it and unpacking it into Morrowind's directory, still no luck.

I'm on Vista Home Premium, SP 2
4 gb ddr 2 RAM
QUADcore 1.80 cpu.
Radeon HD 4670, 1 gb of gddr3 ram.

Doubt any of that will help, but worth a shot. I've tried running in compatibility mode for XP, as well."
,remorsechaos,2010-03-07T22:55Z,"Alright. I finally got MGE working. Well, haven't gotten far with it as of this typing, but it no longer crashes, etc.

A fix for me required downloading and installing the directx9 redist 2010 bits, and whatnot. Also, it apparently helps to run Morrowind at least once before trying to run MGE.

Here's a link to the dx9 redist bit I mentioned:

,JasonOrgasm,2010-05-08T21:57Z,What image do I mount so the game will start?
,mypaxep,2010-05-14T15:24Z,"There are no images. Follow the instructions in ""Installation"" section."
,borgqx,2010-05-22T23:43Z,"you wasted my time with this torrent. download that directx thing from softpedia, and tried compability mode, tried older version of extended graphics mod and newest and newest beta...no luck getting the game to work. And when i run morrowind.exe it says save files are broken and i need to start extended graphics mod to repair them.

dont download people. this shit doesnt work....unfortunatly."
,ionmadness,2010-07-17T06:56Z,The Morrowind Graphics Extender has some trouble installing on certain computers unless you know how to use it. I don\'t recommend installing it unless you KNOW HOW TO USE IT. The game will work basically the same without it.
,nasch78,2010-07-18T00:01Z,Cant run the game without running MGE. Thanks a lot.
,ionmadness,2010-07-18T02:45Z,Yes well I did make a mistake. I thought this was and installer packages not RIP. Anyway can someone tell me how large this entire package is? I know its NOT 976.32 MB. Its lots more.
,pezevenchiul,2010-12-30T22:37Z,"This torrent seems nice but doesn't work for me, mgegui and morrowind didn't wanted to start...after a lot of work and trying every recommended step I came to the undocumented conclusion that the game didn't work because my video card doesn't support Pixel Shader 2.0. 

If it is any help for anyone, the following site is a good guide for installing MGEgui: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/morrgraphext/index.php?title=Installing_MGE_correctly"
,mr1black,2011-01-01T02:41Z,The whole unrared thing is 2Gb. Great package!
,RayBig,2011-03-04T19:15Z,"I found a way to fix the ""MGEgui.exe"" crach problem.

Just run ""Morrowind Launcher.exe"" and change the resolution to anything else than default.
""MGEgui.exe"" should work now."
,Bozobub,2011-03-05T10:18Z,"Oho!  Thanks for this, I wasn't looking forward to assembling the various graphics and sound improvement mods and then figuring out load order/conflicts >."
,Zartrauch,2011-07-15T05:05Z,"Thanks RayBig, worked for me!

Also, big thanks to mypaxep for this great torrent."
,kvltasfvkk,2011-11-13T00:05Z,"Ok, I tried all the steps, and it still won't open, changed resolution, redownloaded the MGEgui, updated my direct x, none of it works... what do?"
