The biopic of Noel Rosa, one of the best brazilian poets and composers.


Rio de Janeiro in the 30s. Noel Rosa is a funny guy with a twisted chin from the district of Vila Isabel. Middle-class and white, he writes poems and plays in a local band. He studies medicine but prefers the friendship of black guys from the favelas, factory girls and hookers. His friend Ismael Silva, a composer, introduces him to the world of samba and when challenged to compose he writes Com que roupa?, a parody of the Brazilian national anthem which becomes a magnificent success. He flies through the golden age of radio like a comet, changing the direction of Brazilian popular music. Between declarations of love and samba duels, the irreverent composer follows an intense rhythm until an overpowering illness complicates his life.
