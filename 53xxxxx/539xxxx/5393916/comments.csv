do u have 2004 season. if u have i would be grateful if u could upload only the round from indy because that was the last win of my idol and i never saw it"
,nnasdf,2010-02-27T04:18Z,"Hey, would it be possible for you to stream the broadcasts live? Since you already have a capture card, I think you have the necessary equipment."
,slicknick610,2010-02-27T06:48Z,"@ larocco
No sorry I dont have 04 Indy. There is a guy posting old races on demonoid maybe he does.

@nnasdf
I have a horrible upload speed. Plus capturing the HD video pretty much maxes out my computer as it is."
,nnasdf,2010-02-27T19:57Z,"Alright, cool. Thanks for all the uploading you do, I don't get speed at my dorm, so it's much appreciated :)"
,nnasdf,2010-02-28T22:54Z,"Hey, I noticed you're capturing at 60 fps. You could really reduce the file size if you captured at 30. TV only broadcasts at 30, so essentially you're capturing each frame twice by doing 60."
,slicknick610,2010-03-01T06:03Z,Actually Speed is broadcast at 59.94fps and CBS is broadcast at 29.97. I think I might know because I am the one that captures them.
,kimpa_kawa,2010-03-01T08:51Z,Where is the race from this weekend? are you gonna record the live races from now on? You are the man Slick!!
,mx_phreek,2010-03-01T11:36Z,"Hi slicknick, are you uploading this weeks race again, its just that with it being live again i would of thought you would of uploaded it by now like last week, as i had downloaded it and watched the race by this time last week. Thanks for keep doing these you are doing a great job."
,nnasdf,2010-03-01T16:20Z,"Is Speed broadcasting in 1080i or 720p for you? I may be completely wrong on this, but I thought that stations only do 60 fps on the interlaced resolutions and 30 on the progressive."
,khr0n1k,2010-03-02T14:45Z,"YO GUYS ARE BOTH COMPLETELY WRONG. CHANGING THE FPS TO 30 FPS WOULD NOT REDUCE THE SIZE AT ALL FIRST OF ALL......AND WOULD MAKE IT LOOK A BIT CHOPPY BECAUSE IT IS BROADCASTED @ 60 FPS.

TO THE GUY WITH THE LATS MESSAGE MOST CHANNELS BROADCAST EITHER 1080i= 30 interlaced fps which when deinterlaced correctly is 60 fps. and 720p stuff is usualy 60 progressive frames....especialy for LIVE SPORTS.

ALSO SPEEDHD UPSAMPLES THIS BROADCAST FROM A NON-HD SOURCE.

P.S. @ slicknick610 all of your recent HD encodes have been AAC audio not MP3..

thanx alot for ur work and encodes though. cant get these in high qual. anywhere else. especialy 60fps."
