This is the third instalment of the 'Faces Of Death' series. Again, it is not currently on tpb, so its worth putting up!

imdb info: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121261/

This is ripped from an original dvd, so there is unlikely to be a better quality version available, but if there is, please feel free to let me know!

Thanks ;)
