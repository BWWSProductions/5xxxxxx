,Spironic,2010-04-20T01:27Z,Is it purely coincidental that this torrent is the same size as xsaimex's 720P torrent? O_o
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-05-22T09:59Z,"I think, Spironic, that's because basically the 720p is on the large side considering that this is stop-motion footage with rarely more than 12 ""actual"" frames per second.

Looking at the screenshots, this looks to be a very nice encode.

Also, just consider all the god-awful ""2-disc"" xvid dvdrips that are out there - stuff that could be easily encoded better in a single-disc rip if you just enable CBAC, QPel and other stuff in your encoder, but more often than not, these groups are more interested in getting their encodes done faster than done properly.

Thanks for the up! :)"
