Additional information:
The "Muha" (en=Fly) produces its second album. Having talked with the representatives of music labels and radio stations, we concluded that the bright and positive music should be conveyed to the listener through a minimum number of intermediaries during economy recession. Part of why we have decided to put our "Album for drawing" on the internet for free download. Moreover, the "Muha" calls: download and encourage friends to download our album!
