This torrent illustrates the necessity of writing the LANGUAGE in the TITLE! Often you don't visit the details page before downloading and even if you do you can easily miss the spoken language if you have no reason to look such as when the programme is English and the title is in English. A person of primate-like intelligence would have called this torrent: ""Charlie och/og Lola / Samu ja Salla 2 Sv/No/Dk/Sf"" or something similar."
