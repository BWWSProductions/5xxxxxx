,SignalToNoise,2011-07-28T22:16Z,"Just a warning, the song titled ""Hate"" is actually the song ""All I Know"" by Stone Sour. It's rumored that Corey tried to bring it to the table and have it reworked by Slipknot, but it's unknown if that's true. Great song, just be aware that it's not actually Slipknot."
