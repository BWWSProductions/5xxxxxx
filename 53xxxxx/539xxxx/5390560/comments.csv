Is it possible to play 2 players on a  split-screen ?

Please answer me, please"
,marcusn,2010-02-26T02:53Z,of course it has split screen.
,Exabit,2010-02-26T07:29Z,"Great game, finished all race tracks!"
,cipher_phinx,2010-02-26T12:29Z,wonder if i can change controls?
,GreG975,2010-02-26T18:39Z,I'm trying to open your link but it doesn't work.
,karimirak,2010-02-26T21:36Z,"does anyone know how to change controls, and is it possible to use one keyboard and play 2 player split screen like in snes or pj64, thanxx in advance... GREAT UPLOAD = GREAT GAME"
,cipher_phinx,2010-02-27T08:47Z,i have a controller but not the xbox one. I tried to change the control but keyboard key for changing control in the settings menu.
,MitsEvX,2010-02-28T01:54Z,"Thanks, it works great on the best graphic settings! :D"
,Gamerfreak55,2010-02-28T06:28Z,"Will seed if this game works. By looking at the amount of seeds, it might work."
,TheKaotic,2010-02-28T10:12Z,"This does work! Everything works except i can't chnage my controls.. I accelerate with D?? but ive gotten used to it.. Also before the game even loads up, theres like a mini trailer, which for me is like really laggy or broken.. But APART FROM THE NON-IMPORTANT stuff it works and run smoothly..

(Btw what am I supposed to do with the split screen option?)"
,KOHb,2010-02-28T19:02Z,works good. thanks
,cipher_phinx,2010-03-01T06:49Z,still no updates on how to change controls?? how pathetic
,FREE-T,2010-03-01T23:23Z,C'mon dude don't you have any fix for the controls?The game is great but without possibility of playing on controller it's almost useless.
,fleetkid,2010-03-02T10:47Z,What are the keyboard key settings. Which is the start button etc?
,fleetkid,2010-03-02T10:56Z,"K got it. My firewall was blocking key events.

Enter button is start.

Drift - S
Accelerate - D
Look back - A
Use item - Space 
item behind - down arrow
steer - left and right arrows

Cannot change controls. damn"

"
,JamieA242,2010-03-04T17:42Z,"same problem as walnutlead, running on windows 7 64-bit and game starts as black screen and then crashes to desktop. copied crack over... tried changing compatibility settings. nothing. please help cos i cant find any solutions through the web."
,aragorio,2010-03-04T18:35Z,"it says 
that i have inserted the wrong disc what do i need to do is it the copy the cracked content because i have no idea how to do that"
,FREE-T,2010-03-04T20:47Z,"For all having problems with controls in this game...IF you have a usb controller check out program Xpadder 5.6.It easy and works just fine,you will be playing this game on a controller in no time.Best of luck!!"
,tonyd79,2010-03-05T18:23Z,worked great for me got it for my son playing with 360 controller
,JamieA242,2010-03-06T00:58Z,"if anyone is having problems with the game not starting, e.g. black screen that crash to desktop (just wont start) then go to audio device settings and lower frequency to 4800hz. also dont forget to run ""config"" where the game installed to get the best graphics settings."
,devincase,2010-03-07T08:53Z,"Had the same crashing problem with Win7 x64 on loading - gets part way through the splash screens and dies - the appcrash details mention XAudio2.

Turns out the game is badly prepared for audio configurations over 48kHz AND things llike quadraphonic speakers. Change your audio config to 24bit 48kHz and stereo speakers - that's what worked for me."
,Amjr,2010-03-10T05:04Z,"For those who are getting crashes at startup , download this DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer.

,UKMadDog,2011-10-25T10:58Z,Could not get it to work on Win 7 just kept getting a black screen then crashing but tried the lowering of the audio as described and it worked perfect i set mine to the lowest setting many thanks
,DanoDynamo,2012-01-03T20:23Z,Works fine once I install it. but keeps crashing after restarting my pc. it doesn't work until I reinstall it. what's the problem?
,DanoDynamo,2012-01-03T20:54Z,"I found the problem, It crashes because of ""XAudio2_5.dll"" and ONLY works when I'm using my headphones, but keeps crashing when I'm using the speakers. anyone knows how to fix this?"
