,Lester126,2010-02-27T16:49Z,"FYI... AV Scan of NOD32 came up clean..

HOWEVER, after executing NOD32, my software firewall alerted me to NOD32 Licencer trying to access the Internet. 

Dont see why it would need to access the Internet.?/?"
,Lester126,2010-03-07T07:23Z,"Lol @ Me.. 

NOD32 Lincenser connects to the internet to retrieve the latest Keys from Database/Website...

I was expecting a crack/patch type of scheme... 

It appears safe to use, AV scans didnt find a thing..

And It Actually WORKS! Tested with ESET Smart Security 4.0.474.0 64 Bit"

By the way, thanks for posting this software, it helped me alot."
,willov,2010-03-16T19:27Z,This is the 32bit Eset just so ppl now that. I donÂ´t know if the crack will work for a 64 verison but iÂ´l give it a go.
,draki85,2010-03-20T20:10Z,"@28_leslie
Try downloading the licenser again and retrying it. I've never ran into that error message so I can't help you much with that."
,draki85,2010-03-20T20:13Z,"oh, and make sure you have your .NET framework available. If it's dissabled then it won't function."
,dr00za,2010-04-17T12:53Z,"Only prob i had, was EEST hav now banned the webby attached to the liscencer/thumper. but went to 'NOD324.info' gota key works like a treat.
Ty uploader :)"
,draki85,2010-04-20T02:02Z,"yes, you have to disable the firewall after you install to use the licenser"
,wesman2232,2010-05-15T20:09Z,"The Licencer won't work for me. It keeps giving me ""No internet connection available."" My computer is directly set up to a cable modem. I downloaded and installed .NET Framework 2.0 (x86) Redistributable earlier."
