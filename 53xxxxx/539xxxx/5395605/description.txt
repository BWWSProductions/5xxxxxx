I've put these two programs together as I got tired of the nod123 websites and the insecent wrong serials provided by them. I've used the licencer on 3 different versions of ESET, ESET Antivirus v4 and twice for ESET Smart Security, and it worked flawlessly. So if you are tired of the websites and having to redo the licence every couple of days, this is for you. 

Also for those who are don't want to download the NOD32 because of the licencing problems, I've never had to redo the licence and I've used ESET for several months now. 


1. Install ESET NOD32 Smart Security 4.0.467.0, and setup update user name and password later.

2. Run NOD32 Licencer by Thumperâ„¢.

3. Write down the user name and password [if you use the licencer for ESET Antivirus you might be able to skip this step and step 4]

4. Open ESET SS and update, when the popup, pops up and asks for user name and password, enter the info you wrote down from the licencer.

5. You are done! Enjoy


Thanks to Thumper, or whoever uploaded it, I can't remember who did, for the NOD32 Licencer

Extensive protection of sensitive data is important in a home environment, as well as in any other. ESET Smart Security 4 represents a complex security solution for computers, which was improved and optimized to provide superior performance and small footprint simultaneously. ESET Smart Security 4 is created by a symbiosis of previously known and newly added features. These advanced technologies in combination with ESETÂ´s famous Proactive Protection ensure comprehensive protection against viruses, trojans, worms, adware, spyware, phishing, rootkits. In other words, ESET Smart Security 4 is the result of ESETÂ´s continuous quest for perfection in computer protection.

The four main modules (Antivirus, Antispyware, Personal Firewall and Anti-Spam) were optimized to provide even better integrated protection by maintaining a high level of performance and speed simultaneously.

Included is also ESETÂ´s famous Advanced Heuristics to protect from unknown threats and generic signatures for reliable detection of mutations of known viruses. ThreatSenseÂ® and ThreatSenseÂ®.NET technology minimize the vulnerability window after the virus outbreak and make the smart detection concept of ESET complete.

Main modules 

    * Antivirus
    * Antispyware
    * Personal Firewall
    * Antispam

 
Other technologies

 
ThreatSenseÂ®

Traditional, signature-based security solutions only react to known threats. The problem is that signature based solutions can only detect known attacks with identification signatures that need to be available in the usersâ€˜ system at the time of the attack, which often takes a few hours. With the speed the new malware can spread today, the risk that you become a victim of a new, so far unknown infiltration is too real. The solution of ESET is based upon the unique ThreatSenseÂ® technology utilizing a new generation of advanced heuristics. This technology offers proactive protection against newest infiltrations in the early hours of their spreading, while the experts in ESETâ€™s labs work on creating of a new signature which is to be added to the virus signatures database of NOD32.

    * Anti-Stealth technology against rootkits
    * Protection against phishing attacks
    * SysInspector
