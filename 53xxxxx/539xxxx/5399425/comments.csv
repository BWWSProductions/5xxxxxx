Copy the crack/paste the crack with original file.

@Davidization6
Whats the error you're getting while converting
Can you be more specific?

,eddiezia,2010-03-04T06:51Z,I am not clear how to install it first and then replace the exe with the cracked file? How the hell does it work? Once something is already installed then you cant see any files let alone replace it....Please I need help. May be I am just too dumb...

,kev2011,2010-03-13T05:11Z,"@zaoblu
have you tried looking in help files or on the AVS program site"
,SDnikko,2010-03-13T15:50Z,"I had to disconnect from the internet befoe installing the program.   The first time, when I didn't do that, the program automatically connected to the parent website.  After that it saw the program as a demo with zero days left (even with the crack).  So I uninstalled it, turned off my cable modem, and tried again.  Everthing was OK after that except for a few weird Windows XP problems when stopping active conversions.  

However,  I have tried ALOT of video converter software and this one produces the best quality conversions.  When converting from DVD to avi you might have to add some sharpness.  This is accessed with the ""EDIT"" button on the opening window."
,ecslipe,2010-03-19T16:05Z,6.4.2 version is out 
,SDnikko,2010-03-21T00:54Z,"Get an error when I try to convert DVD files to DivX (avi).  It says to use one of the built in profiles, but they don't work either.  Converting using XVID is OK and everything else seems to be working just fine.  Just make sure you disconnect from the internet before installing and running the program the first time."
,SDnikko,2010-03-24T04:32Z,"Figured out the problem converting to avi using Divx.  You can't select ""original"" for the frame size.  You have to specify the frame size.  Seems to only be an issue with DivX and is NOT a problem with this crack."
