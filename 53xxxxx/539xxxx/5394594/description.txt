QUOTE: Last.FM


    Fatty Spins was a group of threehaving fun with music.

    Their first song â€œDoinâ€™ Your Momâ€ was published on the channel RayWilliamJohnson, receiving over 3,000,000 views as of February 2010.
    However, despite this success, Fatty Spins was very short lived after the band had arguments over how Ray William Johnson was receiving more royalties than the other two members.

    This resulted in all Fatty Spins songs now being available for free, as Ray announced on his vlog on the channel BreakingNYC, 5th of February 2010 .

Opinion: The songs are funny, or at least I think so. It was basically just a group creating light-hearted songs for the enjoyment of it. It's a real shame they had to go and have a tiff and then split up. They're quite catchy songs too, I've listened to a couple many times and learned the lyrics pretty fast. If you're not one for comical music, don't bother listening to it.
