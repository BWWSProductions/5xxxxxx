,Magioo,2010-06-10T10:05Z,"Iamsougly, That is true ,Adria Route 3.0 has much better coverage of Serbia With detail maps but it's still missing most new built roads,which are made in last 10 Years..Thus, still is much better to use for Serbian and Montenegro,  SCG Route 2.20NT, than Adria Route 3.0..
Best Regards to all from Kraljevo"
