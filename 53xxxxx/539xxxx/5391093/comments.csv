,lazyazz,2010-02-28T21:29Z,"Not sure if it's just me but there are some issues with artifacting during playback.  Other 1080p movies play fine, though I don't have any others that are IMAX versions.  

Would be glad to hear back from others whether it's the release or just me that has these issues."
,lazyazz,2010-03-05T08:09Z,"Retract my previous comment about the artifacting.  For some reason, MPC actually blurs at times while MP12 doesn't.  Odd."
,leomahesh,2010-03-12T12:47Z,"Hey video is untouched right (bd-remux??)?????

,filmmaker007,2010-04-25T08:35Z,"looking forward to the huge size, thanks !"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-05-06T21:40Z,"wow.. 17GB ? :s 
What's the difference between IMAX and a regular Blu-ray rip ? "
,kritigr,2010-05-15T13:08Z,the subs is hardcode?
[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-05-24T06:24Z,IMAX is the same as a Cinema Movie :) 
,stixdogg,2010-06-04T08:47Z,"Thanks!  I can't help but wonder if this was closer to 12 GB if i could even tell the difference.  :D ....  @lazyazz .. if you look under the options for MPC I have got a lot better performance (slow pc causing trouble?) if i set it (under options > playback > output) to ""use texture surfaces and render in 3D"" ...  my old computer had trouble keeping up w/ 1080p movies due to my CPU.. when you set it this way it allows your GPU to do more of the work... or something lol"

,alphaecho,2011-08-21T10:08Z,"10GB with full 1080p would make it epic. eg. Avatar 1080p for reference if anyone has the a proper 16:9 copy not some run off the mill 800p version.

Does anyone know if this is 1080p or 800p+280p worth of black lines? I'm a bit suspicious since I haven't come across one transformers movie in constant 16:9 ratio yet."

,soberstud1120,2011-09-24T00:44Z,"When r u gonna upload a blu-ray of transformers: Dark of the Moon
"
,gorang,2011-09-28T22:49Z,"alphaecho
Its are 800p+280p black bars one whis, also the quality was lite strange, with much color bandings and artefact, where are better copies! and also in smaller sitze with better qualitys i download whis coz of the IMAX and seams not to be IMAX

Unsure if the pic problems is coz my codec, but bout using MPC HC and Splach pro movie is looking the same"
