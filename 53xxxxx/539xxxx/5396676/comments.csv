,h64,2010-02-27T11:57Z,rars are stupid
,SGAK,2010-02-27T15:04Z,I don't mind the rars since TvTeam is so great for getting this out so fast 
,stevenr21,2010-02-28T08:12Z,"there's a reason for rars... if it was just the video file itself and the download was corrupt, you'd have to download the whole video again. if just one rar file is corrupt you only have to download that single rar file again. perhaps you should think before you write comments."
