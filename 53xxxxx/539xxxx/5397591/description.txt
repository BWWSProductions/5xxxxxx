This contemporary version of the classic true story stars the acclaimed talents of Hallie Kate Eisenberg (THE INSIDER, BEAUTIFUL, and BICENTENNIAL MAN) as Helen Keller, and Alison Elliot (THE SPITFIRE GRILL, THE WINGS OF THE DOVE) as Annie Sullivan. Helen, who has been unable to speak, hear, or see since childhood, is increasingly difficult to educate, and her parents find Annie Sullivan. Although she is new to teaching, it is through Annie's strong will and unshakable faith that Helen discovers how to survive and thrive in the world through the eyes and ears of others. Your family will love this story of these remarkable American women.
