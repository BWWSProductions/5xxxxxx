In the beginning, some were against us
But we proved them wrong, and made them envious
		
Then all the talkin', all the squawkin',
Some tried to steal the Fame, but keep Skyy-walkin'

Steppin' together, movin' as one
sure NOT for the money... but for the Fuuun.

Being explicit straight to the freak
Not forgettin' the roots to an up-tempo beat

## about ##

Battlefield: Bad Company 2 brings the award-winning Battlefield gameplay to
the forefront of PC gaming with best-in-class vehicular combat and unexpected
"Battlefield moments." New vehicles like the ATV and a transport helicopter
allow for all-new multiplayer tactics on the Battlefield. With the
Frostbite-enabled Destruction 2.0 system, you can take down entire buildings
and create your own fire points by blasting holes through cover. You can also
compete in four-player teams in two squad-only game modes, fighting together
to unlock exclusive awards and achievements. Battles are set across expansive
maps, each with a different tactical focus. 
The game also sees the return of the B Company squad in a more mature 
single-player campaign.
