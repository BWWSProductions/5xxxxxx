,samhost,2012-04-18T11:36Z,ok guys.I am telling the truth.i am an experienced downloader of tptb games.none of them work.i must have downloaded at least 20 of them and not only 1 works.just a waste of space and time and bandwidth.i just exhausted my bandwidth with this game and finally what i get is a russian game.when i start a campaign all i get is some russian intro and a black screen.nothing on it.fuck you tptb!!!!
