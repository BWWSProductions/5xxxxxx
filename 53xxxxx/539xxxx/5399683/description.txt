When Frank loses his job in the shipyards after thirty six years he finds he has nothing to fall back on except his swimming which he has done regularly for the past twenty years. He has had a good marriage even though he has closed up his feelings since the death of his son, Stuart, many years previously. His other son Rob is a stranger to him and the two men cannot reconcile their loss. They bottle their grief up individually. With a group of friends to help and hinder him, Frank embarks upon a personal challenge - swimming the Channel! A comedy of reconciled feelings and new love.
