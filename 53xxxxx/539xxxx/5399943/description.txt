"Little Brother is my first young adult novel, a story about hacker kids in San Francisco who use technology to reclaim democracy from the Department of Homeland Security after a terrorist attack and the concomitant crackdown. It was published by Tor Books on April 29, 2008." (From Craphound.com)

This is a copy of the other download here on piratebay, I've just been through and split the chapters (I find this helpful for listening one chapter at a time on my MP3 player). The sound quality is OK, there is some distortion as there was in the original on here, it is encoded at 32kbps at 22kHz MP3 but since it is voice it's not bad. The total length is just short of 12 hours, with 21 chapters and an epilogue. 

Enjoy!
