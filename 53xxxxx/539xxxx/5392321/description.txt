Silent as a painting, the movie shows us day-dreamer Hermie and his friends

Oscy and Benjie spending the summer of '42 on an US island with their parents

- rather unaffected by WWII. While Oscy's main worries are the when and how of

getting laid, Hermie honestly falls in love with the older Dorothy, who's married

to an army pilot. When her husband returns to the front, Hermie shyly approaches her.
