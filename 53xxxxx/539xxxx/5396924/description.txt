        Since "No Win, No Fee" lawyers hit the high street ten years 
        ago, Britain has been swamped with adverts encouraging us to 
        put in a claim. The recent icy weather has led to a surge in 
        cases brought against councils, and talk of a growing        
        compensation culture has hit the headlines once again. Have  
        we really been convinced that where there's blame there's a  
        claim? Cutting Edge delves into the multi-billion-Pound      
        world of Britain's personal injury industry to find out if   
        Britain is developing an American-style mania for suing, or  
        if "No Win, No Fee" lawyers are finally giving the little    
        man a chance to fight back. Featuring the lawyers and local  
        authorities working on opposing sides, and following         
        real-life cases as they unfold, the programme looks beyond   
        the media headlines about personal injury claims to reveal   
        who are the real winners and losers in Britain's             
        compensation culture.
