,Frice,2010-02-28T17:01Z,Just testing the comment section and wondering why I cannot see this file when I search for it.
,Frice,2010-02-28T17:06Z,"Ah ok im retarded. I forgot to start seeding the damn thing.

Alright were open for business! Whoever wants some harder AI or just sc2beta come n get it."
,Frice,2010-02-28T17:07Z,"""or just sc2beta AI* come n get it. """
,Frice,2010-02-28T17:14Z,"I see i've been beaten by randomdude, he realesed his way before mine. I just was to tired to last night : /

Oh well the early bird gets the worm. This torrent has the exact same files as mine w/o a mappack:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5398982/StarCraft.2.AI-Maps.Easy.Medium.And.Hard-RANDOMDUDE"
,joeinfro,2010-02-28T17:51Z,"aha!

i always played starcraft with cheats, now i suck period XD

going to try your mappack, but are you sure there are easy maps on here? i need some practice....."
,Frice,2010-02-28T17:57Z,"Well mapwise doesnt matter to much unless u are terribad.

Try the ""SC2_MEDIUM_AI"" file. That is fairly easy and once u get the hang of it try the ""SC2 AI V 3.0 (STARCRACK)"" file. The hardest is ""ai_unsupported_usmc23"" as I believe the comps (yep more than one AI to play against!)have a maphack against you.

Hope that helps, the easiest is the standard ""sc2.AI"" which you need to use first in order to make the AI function I believe."
,Frice,2010-02-28T18:03Z,"Sorry the medium AI is actually retardedly easy and the ""harder"" AI is probably more of a medium.

Try tweaking for more difficulty by picking a map with alot of comp's (alotta spawns)."
,sinshixxi,2010-02-28T20:27Z,"@Frice ""Oh well the early bird gets the worm"". You mean the other torrent released before yours has worm?"
,hpack2010,2010-02-28T20:32Z,"For 4x4 AI maps + Ai difficulty loader + TERRAN & PROTOS Enhancement pack watch my video:

watch?v=7Uzgrxsfigs

Its not fake."
,Frice,2010-02-28T20:40Z,"@ Phrosty 
There is no race selector as of yet, you need to restart the map until you hit your desired race.
@sinshixxi
You know I just mean the analogy, his torrent was scanned and is clear of all malware.

...AND REMEMBER:

Ignore the spamming virus bots like hpack2010!"
,latm_kmol,2010-02-28T21:29Z,"Sorry for being a noob, but how to I ""run"" hacked maps? I placed the STARCRACK folder and SC2_MEDIUM_AI folder in the Starcraft II Beta folder. Do I need to paste any of the other files anywhere, like the maps?"
,Frice,2010-02-28T22:12Z,"You run the maps using lazylaunch. You must have a patched version of the sc2 beta to use this.

The only file you need to worry about is the ""Base.SC2Data"" file that goes in the ""StarCraft II Beta\Mods\Liberty.SC2Mod"" folder which is pretty much done for you in the starcrack folder.

This is the only explanation im giving on this subject as I know alot of people are just to lazy to attempt things themselves.
"
,sinshixxi,2010-02-28T22:30Z,"Frice, what virus did hpack2010 inject to? only to lazylaunch.exe?"
,Frice,2010-02-28T23:39Z,"hppack2010 injected a virus?

Lazylaunch is clean, im not sure what you mean."
,seanbirch,2010-03-01T00:06Z,"So I put the files into Liberty.SC2Mod and started lazylaunch, but no matter what map I take it's still only sandbox. Hacked AI maps don't show up anywhere.

please give this tard some tard-structions.

I attempted some things myself, but alas, it was to no avail."
,EmperorMaximus,2010-03-01T01:44Z,"Hi, 

thx so much for your work.

However, the difficulty settings don't work. The AI always limits itself to building a couple of buldings and maybe 3 or 4 units and nothig more. Even at the insane level it does the same thing, WHY? "
,LaughingX,2010-03-01T01:53Z,I cant seem to get the AI in the game. I can play the map but theirs no enemies on it. Am I suppose to put the AI rar file in lazy launch?
,Frice,2010-03-01T02:14Z,"Yea its still really crappy. The computers while I can get three at a time are on FFA mode and kill each other off way before I get a army, then when I do they only build a few high level guys and play really stupid w/ them.

There is a new ver out that is slightly better but in all we really need a breakthrough in the AI dept or atleast a function to set all the AI on a team against the player for some actual difficulty.

Sorry guys, I guess be glad we can even play the game."
,Frice,2010-03-01T02:21Z,"@ the people having issues installing this I don't really know what else to say or do to help you. I thought about repeating myself but I'm not going to. 

I will give you the URL for the wiki list of darkblizz sites so anyone interested enough about beta AI cracking can keep themselves informed. 
This is the wiki list for darkblizz/starcrack:

,Frice,2010-03-01T02:35Z,"I've posted a torrent with the official darkblizz v.4 AI crack that for some reason has disappeared from the best of the darkblizz wiki sites.

Will keep you all informed and here is the link to the newest sc2 beta AI:

if anyone knows the solution to this u will make me very happy!
To tired to search again for fake shit.."
,hpack2010,2010-03-03T16:47Z,"@lazystoner :

:)."
,Frice,2010-03-04T13:37Z,"@lazystoner

how ironic your name is lazy stoner as you do not read the instructions.

You need a fully patched ver of the sc2 beta client to work the lazytown crack.

Just open the sc2b exe alone and blizz should auto dl the patch and install.

This torrent aint fake but I do recommend the AI 5+, it is far superior to what is avail in this torrent."
,Frice,2010-03-04T13:38Z,Oh yea and plz dont listen to hpack2010 hes a lieing faggot.

,Frice,2010-03-06T01:44Z,"Expert AI 
(Has pwned me 3/6 games)

If you thought the other AI's were to easy (which they are) try this one. The ai's will do mean things like destroy your scv's right before you finish buildings, rape your economy if it gets the chance to do it and just generally be a whoring pain in the ass. If you like the sound of that, this AI add-on is for you.

I've placed all the files in the correct areas based on your readmes and what you have written in the comments, LazyLoader is saying my starcraft is out of date, and i have ran it multiple times and it has not patched.
