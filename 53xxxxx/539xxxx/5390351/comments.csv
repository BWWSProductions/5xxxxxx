[V],catflap,2010-03-05T16:29Z,"the next series, which begins at easter this year,
is officially labeled as Series 5. i didn't know that
when i posted this.

this video is from - as the picture shows - from
the box set called ""The Complete Specials"", which runs from Christmas 2008 until
tennant's finale in January 2010.

i called it S5 because to me it was the full 5th
series, even though it was only specials.

i don't know what the scene groups are going to call the next series with matt smith."

Laaa."
[V],catflap,2010-03-12T03:50Z,NOT NUKED! YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE. GET FUCKED.
,wwwired,2010-03-13T10:18Z,"@crustynudger... take some time to learn what ""nuke"" means. In order to issue a ""Nuke"" you should ideally hold the skull and cross bones beside your name or something liket that. Notice that catflap has the skull and bones. That means alot here.

The torrent is AOK and just as catflap describes... "
,wwwired,2010-03-13T10:20Z,Thanx mucho catflap... great torrent.
[V],catflap,2010-03-13T18:30Z,"being nuked for any reason is reserved solely
for scene releases when scene rules aren't
adhered to or when a file is noticeably bad.

nuking can only be done by scene groups, not
retarded outsiders and n00bs who don't have
a clue.

and since i'm not in the scene, i adhere to no
scene rules at all, so anything i post can never
be nuked by anyone.

i've already given my reasons above. if
someone doesn't like it, that's tough shit
and i'm not interested. download it and
rename it, or go out and buy the damn thing.

end of."
