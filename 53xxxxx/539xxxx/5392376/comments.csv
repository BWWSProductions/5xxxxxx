,dannykard,2010-02-27T10:52Z,"For those having trouble cracking this version, do the following:
1 - Uninstall it
2 - Go to the Registry Editor to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER folder and you will see 4 folders with the name starting with fv, delete them.
3 - Install the version again
4 - Open it and close it again
5 - Crack it

Problem solved?"
