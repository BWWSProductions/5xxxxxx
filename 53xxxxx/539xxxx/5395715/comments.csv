,highchecker,2010-02-27T21:50Z,"help!!
i mounted and the setup starts, and at one point it likes me to insert me disc 2, no matter what i do, it never accepts that disc 2 is mounted, i tried both, daemon tools and poweriso, any suggestion s?
now i try to install from extracted folder, and i am also asked to insert disc two, but i have no possibility to show the setup app where the disc 2 is, please help!"
,overallb,2010-02-27T23:23Z,"Im having trouble installing it.  I mounted the 1st dvd, started setup, then switched to 2nd dvd when it asks me to, then when it asks me to switch to the 1st cd again and I do, it gives me a bunch of errors saying a file isn't found and if I want to abort, retry or ignore.  how do I fix this?"
,Jonaaaazz,2010-02-28T01:02Z,"should this one works ? (:
downloaded the cloneDVD. But when i start up. i see the ""Napoleon Total war"" logo and the intro from sega and blink and miles.
after that, i get an error."
,Vincent8,2010-02-28T02:18Z,"This works. Only problems I've noticed is that every time when starting a game the whole UI is flickering, but its solved by changing the AA setting once, you can change back again to what is was before tho. Also the sound keeps repeating itself on every loading screen. The UI problem could be a driver issue, I have a Radeon 5850."
,avangard,2010-02-28T15:23Z,"Guys, help me please. I've mounted image, but when the extraction starts it stucks.What shall I do?"

,Sarguun,2010-03-01T01:21Z,Found the answer.  Do not try to install by mounting the images on powerISO.  Extract both ISOs to a C:\Users\***\Desktop\Napoleon folder.  Then run setup.

,lucky1979,2010-03-02T00:24Z,"thanx a lot for this torrent! the 14gb torrent from razor gave me hell, or: dll-hell, but this one works like a charm! It also runs faster and on a higher resolution than ETW, but I'm not sure whether that has something to do with the torrent. everything is there, sounds is supposed to be downscaled but no complaints from my side, and i run it on an aspire 9300 :))

anyways: everyone should download this torrent, no crack-copying or whatever, just download, mount with daemon, then be patient and (takes about an hour), and enjoy after!

thanx again noobish!

,sat1v,2010-03-04T14:19Z,"Here is how I did this ... ->

Download Power Iso. go to start POWER ISO and click on the powerISO virtual Drive Manager.
Then search for the Iso -> ntw_dvd1 and open it. the setup should start. otherwise u double click on the ntw_dvd1 Iso and run the setup by that(works also) let the setup do the work. The setup looked like it was getting stuck on 25% (it stayed there for 15 minutes) but actually the setup is doing good. when you get asked for putting the DVD2 in .. open the ntw_dvd2 by power iso. and click OK. when it's finished you can play the game inmediatly .. No crack needed for me and the game runs perfect. Played 2 hours no and no crashes or anything.

I play 1920x1080 2xAA and on Ultra High settings.

That was until I downloaded the later version (trial) of WinRar - V3.93 direct from rarlab.com.

Now they are visible and extracting as I type.

My initial method of mounting the ISOs and installing did not work.

If I have a successful install I might get back here with the method that worked for me. "
,hellonewman,2010-03-29T11:46Z,"What worked for me - and thanks to previous contributors who smoothed 

the path. Originally, mounting these ISOs and installing did not work 

for me.

I have Vista 32 bit running on an Athlon CPU (probably irrelevant)

My WinRAR v3.62 Corporate (Registered) could not read the two ISO's
I downloaded the 40 day trial version of WinRar V 3.93. Now WinRar 

could open and see the two ISOs

Mixing advice from previous contributors, I extracted ntw_dvd1.iso to 

a folder of my choice. After that, I extracted ntw_dvde.iso to the 

same folder - selecting to overwrite previous files when WinRar 

prompted.

After that was completed, I made a copy of the folder I made (hey, I 

am a worry wart)...

Executing Setup.exe I waited for 40 minutes as things took their 

course - unattended.  

After installation, I ran the shortcut that I allowed the setup to put on my desktop. I waited say a minute and up came the game.

At time of writing and off to bed to attend to marital duties, I am running a tutorial......

All good so far. 
Thanks to the contributors, who got me up and running. I would have given this away as a bad torrent due to mounting ISOs without success.

Wheeeeeeeee for tomorrow - it's Game time."

Any help?"

Great upload. Work perfectly fine, and all you have to do while extracting and installing is waiting. Well done!"

,ReVeal23,2011-02-22T02:59Z,Windows 7 64 bit here - torrent works perfectly. Thanks so much to the uploader. I've been trying to find one that worked for awhile and the download size is so convenient!
,fortune1265,2011-02-22T05:29Z,"This was my first game download and install and once I figured out how to do it, it works great.  For beginners like me, it is important to know that it helps to have a program like Daemon Lite or Power ISO to make this work.  Then make sure the files extracted from both CDs are sent to the same one folder.  Then when you run the install it will not ask for the second CD. "

thanx a lot lol"

,k802imbe,2011-03-12T10:25Z,my anti-virus Avira detect malware or maybe its just a false alarm. all i did was mount the iso file is there a keygen in the iso file 1. it just freaks me out
,nicqawsed,2011-03-17T04:39Z,"works beautifly just remember to extract every thing from the isos into the same file, hit setup and wait. it works"

,lolzillaXD,2011-04-03T07:49Z,"why the fuck do people keep bitching about keygen and mounting and shit?

you jsut have to do what kiranthd said

mount the isos, copy the contents to the same folder, run the installer... PLAY THE FUKIN GAME!!!!

and if it freeses or carshes or anything then your system specs are crappy. no moar to it."
,orange7,2011-04-04T02:26Z,"FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO:
Instrucitions:
1. download and REMEMBER where it goes.
2. install dameon tool or power iso (power iso is free)
3.Open tool from 2. set amount of drives to 1 and mount drive (J:) or whatever drive you want. it should open up a browser go to you're iso file (open 1st one)
4. Let it download, when it asks for disk 2, unmount drive (J:) or whatever drive you mounted, then mount the drive using the same method except with disk 2. Continue this process if it asks you for disk 1 or 2 agian.
5. Enjoy the game and SEED! (after it downloads dont stop it) let it seed until it has uploaded at least half.

Hope this helped partially, and thank you uploader, i seeded."

,Jurajsremec88,2011-04-27T16:45Z,"Hello! i downloaded this game and the setup was very easy but now i have a problem when i play it. I atart to play and everything is good but then after few minutes of playing the game crashes and it says ""windows is trying to resolve this problem"" or somethnig like that and i have to close the game, i mean it closes by itself. so if you can understand me and help me with this problem? :("
,azervayne,2011-05-15T11:25Z,"Works great.

Not sure why people are complaining about the extraction time...its highly compressed, of course it takes a while.

There is absoluetely no need to complicate the install by ""extracting"" the iso files. Just mount them in DaemonTools or something similiar, run setup.exe, and when it asks for Disc 2 mount Disc Two. It surprises me this needs to be clarified, but there ya go. If you extract the isos you're just making the process take longer than it needs to and wasting hard disk space (even if just temporarily, you'll have major fragmentation have moving so many pointless files)."
,Xkul,2011-06-04T17:06Z,looking forward to this...although from what im reading theres no crack involved?
,DubxXx,2011-06-07T17:29Z,"First Torrent I downloaded and work perfectly! Thank you very much noobish! My only issues is that graphics :/ and I can't play in high or very high settings, can anyone help me solve this problem greatly appropriately  :) "

,janjan56,2011-06-13T08:15Z,"OK i found it out heres my solution, first extract the download files to a folder (you must extract them both)..After that Make that folder to an ISO.file.(IF U HAVE REGISTERED Ultra-ISO.)Then Run setup.Then it will say error just click retry many times until it stops..Hope it helped"
,spence00,2011-06-13T19:28Z,yea it installed great with daemon tools lite but when I click the image on the desktop it just freezes on the first loading screen. help plzz

,snagacaba,2011-07-15T20:47Z,"Great Torrent! For all of you who are mounting the image and having problems, follow these steps.

1) Get PowerIso...Open the image and extract the files from both CDs to one folder on your computer i.e. ""Napoleon Total War""
2) Run Setup.exe in the folder when extraction is complete.
3) Play and have fun!


Thanks Noobish for this flawless torrent."
,CarpeDiem96,2011-08-10T23:36Z,so like fuck i heard this game was a buggy piece of shit no way im paying for it i cant either so this is cool i hope its easy to install and do i need to use a steam account?
,OLDLIMEY4,2011-09-24T20:57Z,"Works a treat,  tx"
,kendambu,2011-09-30T07:18Z,great thanks for the game . it runs perfectly.. only problem i had was that my antivirus told me there was a trojan so i turned it off.. prob a false positive.. as i ran the full scan an nothing popped up
,kendambu,2011-10-01T02:20Z,how do i play online????? Help
,manmohanth,2012-01-23T15:21Z,"Open the image and extract the files from both CDs to one folder on your computer.

Run Setup.exe in the folder when extraction is complete.

It might take about an hour or so for the installation to be complete, needs about 20 GB.

Enjoy when complete.

If still doesn't work, upgrade your PC or get a new one."
,Malthak93,2012-02-12T23:59Z,Great torrent thenoobish.I got really mad during the extraction because i though it crashed but i was wrong.I have already finished a whole campaign and on ultra settings!!!!!thanks again noob ;)

,darkrift12345,2012-03-10T09:01Z,anybody who asks why this download is so small is because its highly compressed and that's why it takes a while to install because its actual size is 20 GB when installed and just a tip... to ALL WINDOWS 7 64-bit USERS DO NOT MOUNT THEM BUT EXTRACT THEM AT THE SAME FOLDER AND YEAH ITS A HUGE WASTE ON HARD DRIVE SPACE BUT ITS WORTH IT... :)

,nz77788,2012-06-05T05:36Z,"This looks far more promising. I made the mistake of downloading Razor1911s 15gig version and installed it - kept freezing on the startup image. If this one works, why the hell would anyone download his one, at 3 times more data usage + extra bullshit for installation?

I'm going to report back here once downloaded and installed."
,nz77788,2012-06-06T03:48Z,"Works 100%. No problems at all.

Razor1911's one is 3x as big and more complicated to install, PLUS for me it froze on the startup image. THIS on the other hand was a simple install and it worked perfectly. If anyone wants this game, THIS is the torrent for it!!

Although the game itself isn't that great...I was hoping it was more like AOE3, but still...the torrent itself is perfectamundo"
,UbinTimor,2012-06-13T06:24Z,the weird thing is that Empire Total war runs perfectly on my laptop but sometimes Napoleon total war gets a little laggy even with the graphics set to low. what's even weirder is that Navel battles in Napoleon are 10X as less laggy as Empire. well at least that's what happens on my laptop anyway.
