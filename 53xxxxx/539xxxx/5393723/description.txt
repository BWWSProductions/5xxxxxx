Why Wing Chun Works - Beginning Wing Chun - Alan Gibson

Beginning Wing Chun by Alan Gibson is a well thought out and structured text that should be utilised as a continual point of reference to all Wing Chun practitioners.

In my opinion the main triumph of the book is that the authors obvious wealth of knowledge of the system is transmitted in an easy to follow logical format and accompanied by photo's that for once actually help the reader to understand the concepts and training methods being described.

It is a refreshing change to read a Wing Chun book that does not boggle the reader with science or confuse with drawn out, over-complicated explanations. As with the system itself this book is efficient and direct in its delivery and is suitable for individuals who are literally "beginning" Wing Chun to those who are accomplished practitioners.
