I spotted this guy on Vimeo in December 2009.  He was attempting to play the entire Pink Floyd The Wall album solo acoustic.  I was stunned by the quality of the performances.  In January 2010 he completed the project, and posted the videos on YEESHKUL! to much praise.

Here is Bill's own personal DVD image of the project.  Search for Acoustic Wall Project on either YT or Vimeo for a preview.  You'll be shocked how good it is and I guarantee you'll be back to download this.
