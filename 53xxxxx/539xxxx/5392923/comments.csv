,DSDO,2010-05-09T18:21Z,"I tried to play it with BSplayer, but it crashes every time... This is weird since I already watched SecretMyth movies with it and had no problem...

So is it just me (maybe the file got somehow corrupted ?), or do others have the same problem with this one ?

PS: I'm on Windows 7, with BSplayer pro 2.51, if it helps..."

,as14ever,2010-07-03T19:30Z,"Movie request to any one that can do it. I have a request for some very hard movies to find as mpeg4 BRRip H264 AAC3 in resolutions: 1280x544 or 1280x720 or even 1920x1080p

The Movies are: Appleseed 2004 
Tron 1982
Brazil 1985
Naked Lunch 1991
Conan the Barbarian 1982
Conan the Destroyer 1984
The Dark Crystal 1982
King Kong 1976
The Secret of NIMH 1982
Spike Lee School Daze 1988
Spike Lee Mo Better Blues 1990

If any one can find these movies in the format mentioned above, or can create them in the same quality as secret_myth I would be very appreciative and can maybe work on some type of compensation if needed.

Let me know at firstliight@yahoo.com "
