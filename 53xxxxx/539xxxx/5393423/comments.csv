,musicman_360,2010-05-11T09:58Z,I found a version of this with only Enterprise Server and it is working fine. If the patch is fine in this release than it should work. I wouldn't trust an all caps user like tommo39 for information. I can't verify this torrent but I can verify that the AGAiN release works. You must follow the instructions very closely!
