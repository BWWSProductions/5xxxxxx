Here is the first version of Speccymania, a large collection ZX spectrum games with screenshots and information for use with the new version of gamebase v1.3 beta.  A copy of the new gamebase is in the root of the speccymania folder and needs to replace the files within the gamebase folder.  You do need to have gamebase installed before doing the gamebase update.
