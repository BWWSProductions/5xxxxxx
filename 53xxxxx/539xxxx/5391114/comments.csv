[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-25T03:21Z,"fag - had some rig / encoding issues. Working on it now.

I'm not sure why, but on a different machine going from wav to mp3 it's taking longer than it should for O&A to encode. Counter started with an hour and 30 then sometimes jumps to 2 hours and 30! Says another hour to go as of now......

I will up it as soon as I can. Also running tests right now to see if A I've fixed the issues and B can I start doing my own R&F rips. I'm editing them atm, might as well do the rip (if it doesn't affect O&A encoding) if possible. I'll start upping them at d3m0n0id too if I can make it happen."
,noooblets,2010-02-25T04:33Z,"very cool, thx for sharing"
,go_yukuri,2010-02-25T16:00Z,Ah buddays. ???????
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-25T18:18Z,"Looking good on the R&F rips. 100% mg56 O&A + R&F rips should shut any future haters right the F up. BTW it appears as if ""darth"" bolted anyway, even though I stopped upping ""his work"" when he asked. I'm thinking I'm gonna keep R&F as 64k mono, unless peeps want something else. 

Also as stated, R&F will start going up on d3m0n0id starting today......

I just want say thanks to darth, schwigger and anyone else who is or was ripping, encoding and or editing XM202 for the fans. I have done my best to credit sources when I have used them, and will continue to do so (as needed when my equipment fails, lol) in the future. 

O&A PARTY ROCK!!!"
