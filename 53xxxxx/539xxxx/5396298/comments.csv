,AZkiller7,2010-02-27T03:46Z,"i don't think there's a need of a proof in here, so far, all extremezone's uploads are of quality"
,Thestig1968,2010-02-27T03:46Z,Downloading now but it will raise questions where there it's real or not since the release is mars 4.
[T],Antje14,2010-02-27T03:55Z,Needs a proper crack though :(
,glog73,2010-02-27T04:07Z,Im a bit confused right now. Antje14 are you saying there is something wrong with both extremezone version and xdccbots? 
[T],Antje14,2010-02-27T04:08Z,"@glog73
Well they are both the same release, done by RELOADED"
[T],Antje14,2010-02-27T04:11Z,You can still just download them but you will have to wait for a proper crack before you can play it
,bigturd,2010-02-27T05:28Z,Any idea if you can play this online at all?
,anuzbitt,2010-02-27T05:36Z,so any point to download this ? when its online game :P 
,7.62,2010-02-27T05:44Z,"There is a single player campaign.
You will not be able to play this online.

If you like it, then buy it for the multiplayer component. They have done a great job, and we need to be supporting PC games, or us PC gamers are only going to get console ports."

,choco.,2010-02-27T06:12Z,what do u think guys..will it be possible to get a cd key to play online?(without paying ofc;)) :S
,Kahai,2010-02-27T08:07Z,"It's legit and ""works"" however, my mouse does not work in game. Technically it 'does' but whichever way I move the mouse it looks up and only turns right as in I'm looking straight up and rotating right no matter what I do. Same with my Logitech controller, same thing.

It might be a routine to stop illegal playing but who knows. Menu mouse works fine it's just in game it doesn't do as you want."
,job_hunterx,2010-02-27T09:03Z,well im installing now its def real but lets c if the crack wrks i sure hope so.. i think ima end up buyin this 1 neway 4 the multiplayer
,houseofswing,2010-02-27T09:20Z,just a humble observation but i loved 1942 i loved BF 2 but this game i fear they have tried to make it too fast paced ......and yes i had the beta and yes i played for a couple of weeks before i made my conclusion. But I thought it was way to fast paced no strategy just go faster then your opponent to any given position.....Thx But no Thx I'll stick with BF2 Reality Mod
,gizmoobobbarna,2010-02-27T09:37Z,"Well...
i preorderd the game and have played beta for a while now....and i must say battelfield 2 has it´s charm but so does bad company 2
"
,Sharon3,2010-02-27T09:37Z,Downloading right now. THX 
,Tilatus,2010-02-27T09:47Z,"Bad Company was the one Battlefield that had a full single player campaing and it was very entertaining. I assume Bad Company 2 is the same, so you should have a lot to play even without multiplayer."

,Sirlimpit,2010-02-27T13:12Z,"This game is totally worth buying. it's the first time in a few months ive really felt this way about a game.

Only reason im torrenting it is because i dont want to wait til tuesday to play, might as well get my thirst for the singleplayer out of the way so i can just play multiplayer when i get it. (not preaching, but the multiplayer really sells this game)

thanks a TON for the upload."
,Azamato_the_Great,2010-02-27T13:16Z,"So there's no way I can play this online?

Already ordered it."
,tapper101,2010-02-27T15:52Z,"I usually download games, but I really can't support this. DICE is a small Swedish developer, stealing this game could ruin them. Maybe they won't be able to make another game, would you like that? Personally I love the BF series and I'd really like it if they'd continue making those games. You could at least have waited with releasing this pirate version 'til after the game had released.

Extremezone,you're a petty thief anyway, I mean how the hell did you get this game? You must have stolen it from their office or something?"

,Allimak,2010-02-27T18:22Z,"At tapper101: You claim to pirate games, and then advise us not to pirate this particular one because its from a small swedish developer. 

You sir are an idiot. There is no other way of putting it, you are a moron.

Its the same as if a developer would say: Feel free to pirate other games, but please don't pirate ours.  "
,Isti01,2010-02-27T18:34Z,"As Antje said before, you need to copy EVERY file from the crack folder to get the controls working!"

Use poweriso to mount the image and install the game. the keygen is in the crack folder.verification choice doesn't matter, you won't be doing it.

After install copy all files EXCEPT the keygen (doesn't matter) to the main install dir. This includes the two nonsense poems.

Run from BFBC2Game.exe

I downloaded it the other day, Ive been playing it and I absolutely love it. Ive been following the multiplayer side of it for ages and have it preordered, but I thought id download it to complete the singleplayer first and then focus on multiplayer when released.
The download worked great, easy install and the game hasnt crashed once. Had no problems at all, I am on the 12th level now and think I am near the end. Its well good!

My question is where does the game save the saved game files on my computer? I have been looking everywhere and cant seem to find it. Anyone know?

Thanks"

for anyone wonderin what i'm talkin about this is to get rid of the quite dialogue in the game.

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding.

1. Burn or mount the image.

  2. Install the game. Use the keygen found in the /Crack dir on the DVD when
     prompted for a serial.
  3. Copy over the cracked content to your install folder.
  4. Play the game.

Game works well, just finished it, not very long but well done.  If anybody knows where it can be tried in multiplayer please post, I like to do my homework before buying, and yes it looks like it might be very good in multiplayer
Some things I READ and found out:
 For mouse problems: Make sure to copy and paste the 2 txt files from cracks, weird fucking jews and their poems, the game will fuck with mouse controls unless you have them in the dir
2560x1600 gives lots of stutters and tearing of the screen, like vsync is not on, change to 1900x1200 with everything on and its 60 - 45 fps with 275sli and 196.34

--------------------------------------------------

I didn't have that problem, but you are 100% correct. Not only will this fix a bug, this will IMPROVE your performance by almost double!
SO.. use directx 9 if you're lagging crazy.
Before i did this, i couldnt even move my mouse on high. By switching back to dx9 its good enough to move...

So basically... High DX9 = Low DX11"
,ghostpilotcam,2010-03-02T03:33Z,"Please help: no it not the stupid problem with the pointer or anything

Any solution to this would be appriciated? I repeat this about 10 times."
,jan765,2010-03-02T03:36Z,"I GUARANTEE that this is 100% working with a WORKING crack.

1. Simply MOUNT (no need to ""unrar"" because it's already an ISO. No need for that)
2. Open the mounted disc and locate crack.
3. The keygen's name is rld-bbc2. Run it and generate.
4. Copy the key and paste when prompted by the installer
5. Copy ALL files in the crack folder into the main directory where you installed the game.
6. [For those with lag/fps issues] (In courtesy of McRulle. I simply copied and pasted this) Go to your BFBC2 directory (I've got Beta so my directory is BFBC2Beta). In Vista it should be located in Documents. Open the ""settings"". Count 3 from the bottom, you should be at ""DxVersion=[auto]"". Erase [auto] and type 9, should look like this:

7. Play, have fun. Hopefully your computer can handle it.

P.S This game is like... crysis lag level. SO basically, if you know your pc is just crap, dont even bother with this. If your pc is awesome, good for you."

just follow my instructions...

,amoghthegamer,2010-03-02T04:05Z,"@jan765

I did exactly as you said. When I pasted the code in, and continued, it shows up again. My PC can play Crysis at 45+ FPS. My specs are:

-Core 2 QUad(3.6 GHz)
-4GB DDR3 Dual Channel Ram
-(2) 500GB Caviars running RAID 0
-2TB External HDD
-GTX 260 Factory Overclock
-Antec 1200

I have seen that there have been some who have had problems with saving the game. If you follow this, I can guarantee that it works.

SAVEGAME PROBLEM

I had the exact same problem. Here is what I did to solve it.

1) I created a new windows user account which only consists of ANSI characters (English). Non-english characters cause a problem with this game. Changing the current username didn?t do a thing (maybe because its not changing the profile name of a user).

2) Then I re-installed the game on a path different from the default one. (Default was ?c:\program files (x86)\?. I used ?e:\Games\?)

3) And finally I ran the game by right clicking and using ?Run as administrator? command.

Now my game can create the savegame file called GameSettings.bin inside my ?%userprofile%\Documents\BFBC2?.

I hope this works for everyone out there as well.

if now have to complain so damn much about the game so why do not you buy the game instead.

FFS: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE YOU MAKE SILLY QUESTIONS.

FOR EXAMPLE  WHERE CAN I FIND CRACK AND CD KEYS."

,VictoryorDeath,2010-03-03T18:53Z,"Not working for me...
al worked fine.
i starded the game.

then i was on the menu.

can someone help me?"
,nimrodm,2010-03-03T19:20Z,"i begin the campaign and in that boat is do a lags 
(black lags) is close the game after 2 min
what i need to do?"
,defender_of_sunnah,2010-03-03T19:25Z,"hey, tips from the expert..

1. Extract those files

2. Install the game

3. Open ""rld-bbc2"" in the ""crack folder"" and then enter this serial number ""VPJS-4NU8-2Z7X-L2Z5-3RLD""

4. Once everything is installed, then copy ""BFBC2Game"", ""jabberwocky"", ""pitoni"" and ""rld.dll"" from the ""crack folder"" and then paste it into the installation folder ""c:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Battlefield Bad Company 2""

5. Right click the game ""BFBC2 on the desktop"" and start that as ""ADMINISTRATOR""

6. The game will start and works perfect

7. In the very beginning, the location will be at sea-side or shore in Japan, so once you get out of the boat and you will have a knife with you, REMEMBER, by clicking mouse button or try to zoom it, it will not work BECAUSE, the settings of mouse is correct BUT you have to ASSIGN a key for the ""MELEE BUTTON"" and i assign it as a ""V button"".. so kill that first enemy with this MELEE ""V button is mine"" and once he is killed, then you can simply jump by clicking spacebar and once you move forward, you will get weapon, so now you can zoom the weapon with right mouse and fire with left mouse

8. Enjoy, sometimes we act like a fool hahaha :)))"
,butcherbob,2010-03-03T19:51Z,"Works fine for me.Mouse middle button is melee(for the knife)a on-screen prompt tells you so.
Dl apply crack complete to install directory and play.

I cleared the settings by assigning the fire button to all the movement controls. The game then gives a warning telling you the button is already in use.

,lidyjan,2010-03-08T20:29Z,"You can not play online


Let's first get all the facts straight about the likelihood of BFBC2 cracked servers ever appearing:

- DICE and EA decided to only distribute the dedicated server files to certified ranked server providers, which means that unless some certified server provider leaks the dedicated server files, no cracker will ever get it's hands on those files.

- The game does not have listen server capabilities, which means that players can't host a server and that the files required to host a BFBC2 server are not included with the game. The game only has the client-side files to be able to join and play on dedicated servers hosted by certified ranked server providers.

The above points prove that there is currently no way for a cracker to crack any server hosting files, and remove the checks so illegal copies can join cracked servers, because there is no way for a cracker to get access to the server hosting files (dedicated server files).

If the dedicated server files are not leaked at some point (which is very likely, because the certified ranked server provided that would leak the dedicated server files would have to pay a BIG fine), then there is no way of ever playing BFBC2 online with an illegal copy of the game.

And for all you who think this is easier to crack than for instance MW2, it's not, and here's why: MW2 uses P2P for multiplayer, which means that a player is also the host of the server (we all know the annoying host migration when that player leaves the server). This means that the files for hosting a server are included with the game, because every player has to be able to be the host. This makes it a lot easier to crack because the files required for hosting a MW2 server (which are the files that have to get cracked to allow for illegal copies to join the server) are available to anyone who buys or downloads the game.

As described above, BFBC2 does not include any files for hosting a server and only certified providers have those files. So a cracker can't get those files and so he can't crack them either.

I bought the game (I actually pre-ordered it) and I can say from hours of experience that the game is absolutely brilliant in multiplayer. I had a blast finishing the singleplayer, but multiplayer is in a whole league of it's own. In my opinion the multiplayer of BFBC2 is even better than the multiplayer of BF2 or MW2, it's really that good.

So just go out and buy the game, and experience the excellent multiplayer for yourself, you won't regret it.

,mtk2a,2010-03-09T06:06Z,"White Screen of Death:
I experienced this problem the first time I loaded up the game. I fixed it by changing the field of view.
Go to ...User/Documents/BFBC2 and edit settings.ini. Under [Graphics] add or change the line ""FoV=X"" to something appropriate to your resolution. For me at 1680x1050 I used ""FoV=74"". Check this site to get your recommended FoV:
http://rjdown.co.uk/projects/bfbc2/fovcalculator.php

CD Key:
After you mount the image go to your computer, right click the drive and click 'explore', in the folder titled 'crack' there is a file called 'rld-bbc2.exe'. This is the KeyGen. Run it, click generate, and enter the key for installation.

Multiplayer:
It is currently impossible to play this torrented version in multiplayer. For the reasons lidyjan already stated, it is extremely unlikely there will ever be cracked servers, or any other way to play this online without a legit copy of the game.

BFBC2 is obviously a high-quality title and well worth the money to be able to play online. Dice is a good developer and they deserve to get paid for their hard work. So go buy it.

,dimebag81787,2010-03-11T09:40Z,"Incredible graphics and gameplay. I can't wait to get the original for Multiplayer. The installation was smooth and easy, there is a post-cracking version update that installs automatically on executing the game itself, but a second cracking will allow it to work as expected. "
,mibrons,2010-03-11T10:58Z,"Is there seriously someone that thinks that these graphics are actually in game ""good""?

I did see those preview pictures, I was really excited about the graphics and though this is going to be best looking game ever.

When I fired it up on 1920x1080, all maxed out, this might be the worst graphical quality game for PC in many years.

Draw distance is around 30m and after that everything is reduced to incredibly low detail and low textures.
That is because this is console game, PS3 and Xbox have the power of 2006 PC system, GPU is equivalent to GF 7600GT.

I have myself HD5870 and 1920x1080 resolution and yes, the game looks like fucking crap, mostly because the draw distance and weak anti-aliasing.

If you want to know what looks better, I might have to list every single game before this until 2007, which I'm not going to do.
If you find PC only game from respectable publisher before 2006, I guarantee that it has better graphics than this.

Destruction 2.0 isn't that incredible either, it is freaking coolest one I've seen, but it is quite generic. I couldn't code something even near like that though so I have to respect it.

If you are talking about cutscene graphics, they are indeed most impressive ones I've seen since Crysis, but shadows are croppy and environment detail consists of around 150 polygons and 64x64 textures.
Cutscening couldn't be done more annoying, you just think that you are immersed into the gameplay, and BANG cutscene throws you out to whole different place and ruins the immersion.

What I'd have to say about the graphics plusses are the character modelling that is really impressive and the detail shader that they use in lots of close range objects that makes the texture look very detailed.

There is no motion blur, not even fullscrene motion blur, no good post-processing effects, just the ugly bloom shader that is used for consoles to hide the bad detail.

Look, I know about this stuff, I've seen lots of games and I'm game maker myself and I know what they should look like in PC.
Game should look like this for consoles, not for PC.
I'd want to try the multiplayer, but this game is not worth buying because DICE seems to think that they can just urinate in PC owners cereals by copy pasting console games to PC."

,HyBriDxZ,2010-03-16T14:09Z,"Ok, I understand all the L33T comment posters insatiable need to appear to superior to other people that are asking for help, but at this point, instead of ripping into every person that has a problem with their mouse, maybe we could consider that there is a DIFFERENT issue with the mouse controls, aside from just not including all the files (YES INCLUDING THE TEXT FILES NOOOBZOOORXXXXSSS!! ARGH!!!! NOOBS!). It's been estabilished about 75 times that you need to include these files, so apart from the ocassional person that actually doesn't do the minimal upfront research, let's not flame people into having a fear just to ask for help in the future because for some reason people think it makes them look (cool? superior? smart?) to belittle people with questions that you problem only know the answer to because you had the same problem yourself.

Now, with that out of the way. A lot of people that have problems after they copy all the cracked files into said directories and still have a problem with bizarre mouse controls (inability to fire, bizarre movement patterns); I'm guessing the majority of these people are using a laptop with a USB mouse. Just like the controllers conflict with a mouse on desktops, the two pointing devices (HID-compliant and external [ps/2 compatible mouse]) are going to have similar conflicts with each other. Unfortunately, unlike the joystick controller you cand simply unplug the integrated laptop mouse, and your surely not going to get very far using that as your primary in a first person shooter, or any other game for that matter, so I'm pretty sure this will have to be an issue addressed through a patch, unless anyone else has an idea. It seems that its only an issue with the pirated versions of the game since its not addressed in any official help logs, so I'm guessing its the txt files that are going to be key here. Hopefully a solution arises soon, but the problem is that it doesnt seem to be a widespread issue which means its not going to receive widespread attention. Best of luck to you none the less though.

Then use Daemon tools to mount BFBC2Game.exe (yes, the one you just copied), click, play and enjoy.

If you copy everything over from the crack folder you dont crash on the Snowblind mission too btw."

,spygame2330,2010-03-17T08:17Z,Ok this is kind of a strange one. I have always dloaded extremezone releases and have always gotten great quality. This time though I am having problems with the controls of the games. Especially the mouse. I am not able to look around at all during the game. The Y axis does not work at all and when I move the mouse on the X axis the screen pans right and up wards until it cant go any farther up. I have played with the controls for a while with no luck. Just wondering if anyone else is having this strange prob. Please help if you can. Thanks

,newronuk,2010-03-17T10:46Z,"spygame2330: I've got the same problem, can't look anywhere but up and the x and y axis settings don't do anything. Quite frustrating...

,19alex93,2010-03-17T12:34Z,"***SERIAL NUMBER:***
To those that cant find the serial key.
go to the place you downloaded the game.
then go folder called crack.
and run the program called:""rld-bbc2""

***MOUSE CURSOR FIX:***
if you didn't see there's writen:

""Seems like some of the people are having problems with mouse cursor in-game. To fix this you need to copy *ALL* content from crack folder into install folder: BFBC2Game.exe, jabberwocky.txt, pitoni.txt & rld.dll.

,Kitetsu17,2010-03-17T15:02Z,I've seen this question asked over a dozen times but I haven't seen an answer. I have everything done and when I go to load up the game I have to re-enter the registration code and when I put in the code I used that the keygen gave me it doesn't work. And neither does any other random keygen code. What is the deal? How do I get past this?

give us some awnsers people!"

"
,newronuk,2010-03-17T17:00Z,"Ok the navigation, x and y axis issues, are fixed. It was just a matter of copying *all* files (except the keygen) from the crack directory to the installation directory, including the txt files which appear to be poems. Then it works beautifully. Was just a matter if following the instructions I guess :)

For the people that are wondering, you can let the game update after install and then replace the exe with the one from the crack directory. Works just fine in SP."

Open up the ""Battlefield Bad Company 2"" folder and paste the stuff that you copied from the crack file.

This is as easy as i can explain it if ppl dont understand... to get ur pc to think this torrent is a DVD u gotta Download Daemontools, with that program u mount the file u downloaded and when the install starts and asks for key u go to ""my computer"" where u click the CD and chose ""open"" (do not doubleclick) then u go into the Crack folder in and there u click the files til u find the keygen... there is also the cracks so just copy all of that into the game folder when the install is finished and exchange with the old files with the same name... then u click the game and then it should run... uve done everything right and if it doesnt work then it should be a compatiblity problem
With this guide even the newest to this should know how to do"

,reddevilslb,2010-03-22T10:07Z,"Hi everyone.
I gotta tell u that this is one of the games ive most apreciate in a long time and because ive seen many people having problems with this game, ill explain step by step what to do.

1-Burn or mount this image with PowerISO, Daemon Tools, etc;
2-Start instaling the game, and when it asks for a serial, just use the keygen located in the Crack folder inside the image (i personally like to create 2 or 3 keys before using it);
3-After the instalation is complete, u should copy ALL the files in the Crack folder inside the image except the keygen into the folder where u installed the game (copying all the files, including the .txt ones, will fix the mouse problem);
4-The problem of lines of pixels appearing black or something like that was fixed by putting the overall quality into low( i dont really think that quality low but ok ;D);
5-To fix the saving issue u just have to download this following patches and unrar them into the installation folder, overwriting some stuff(personally u can just use the first patch, but it works after u overwrite with both). These were the ones ive used, but theres probably more.

*********************************************
Q: Mouse look up only

So let's resume

Seems like some of the people are having problems with mouse cursor in-game. To fix this you 

need to copy ALL content from crack folder into install folder: BFBC2Game.exe, 

jabberwocky.txt, pitoni.txt & rld.dll.  EXCEPT the key generator rld-bbc2.exe.

Q: And then on second mission over the jungle a white screen then black and computer dead

To avoid that just don't go around the corner after you go up the stair on the frozen lake
just jump over the barber wire on the right and go trough the buildings, kill the bad guys 

...
 Get the truck, you will get to the bridge, and surprise white screen again.

But if you get white screen just disable the net, the game search for some protection on the 

Internet, get the Internet down while you play or use firewall to block it.

Q: how can i save my f...ing game here?

No save, are check point and save made automatic. Just resume when you enter game again.


=====
***SERIAL NUMBER:***
To those that cant find the serial key.
go to the place you downloaded the game.
then go folder called crack.
and run the program called:""rld-bbc2""
then press ""Generate"" and there you have the serial.
=========

So that's it, are some minor crashes along the way, so don't go to fast especially when you 

see choppers.
Have fun, and buy the game if you like it.

For those who don't know how to mount the DVD, well go read the manual on, daemon tool, 

alcohol, or whatever you use etc.

- I've read most of the posts here, but unfortunately I haven't found any useful information. 

PROBLEM:
- I'll try to be as specific as i can. I've done everything just the way how the instructions say and almost for 5 times for now. Always the same problem. 
- I've installed it, cracked it, tried it and it starts off perfectly. Checked the settings, all fine. But when i start a new campaign and when the first text (about WW2 and the bombing) appears and seems like to come closer, it disappears for a second, comes back and suddenly I'm back on my deskdop again with no error messages, with nothing.

- I've updated all my drivers, they are all up to date. Usually i have solved all my problems with everything by myself, but now I'm really confused what the fuck is going on.
- My computer specs should all be fine with the game.

- Does anyone have ANY information about that problem, i would be really grateful if you spared some of it with me.
Thank you!

,FELUXZ,2010-03-23T20:51Z,"Okey, Some of you guys have problem installing this game to make it work properly. so here comes a Noob proof ""installation manual"" 

1. Download daemon tools if you don´t have it already

2. Mount rld-bbc2.iso whit daemon tools.

3. If the installer doesn't  mount by itself go to My Computer and klick Setup.exe 

4. Press install

5. Go to> My Computer > Crack > rld-bbc2.exe (keygen) 

6. Generate a key Copy paste into the installer 

7. Select online installation (that will allow you to play whit-out a CD inserted )

8. Finnish the installer

9. Go to E:\Crack inside the rld-bbc2.iso and Copy ALL the files except the keygen. (INCLUDING pitoni.txt AND jabberwocky.txt Paste in C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Battlefield Bad Company 2

 The Text files will fix the mouse to work Properly

10. Create a shortcut of BFBC2Game.exe (the cracked one that you have pasted in  C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Battlefield Bad Company 2) to the Desktop

DONE! GLHF!!

This torrent will work in campaign mode. if you want to play online buy the game. "

this problem was already addressed... here is the solution i posted to tprkk - hopefully it will work for you too. (if people would just skim the comments we wouldn't have the same questions posted over and over).

-----------------------------------------------------------
@ tprkk

are you talkin about the part where you climb up the stairs to the roof and onto the helicopter?

if so, try this... there are TWO ways to get up to the helicopter, the direct method has been known to crash the game for some reason, the second way, by walking outside to the balcony and climbing up the ladder should bypass the crash.

lemme know if it works.

,dearghoul,2010-03-30T03:56Z,"Quick recap for those too lazy to read all 961 comments. May be a little out of order, my aged brain....
Use daemon tools or such to mount the iso and install the game.
When it asks to choose to use the disk or an online verification or something choose disk.
The crack folder is in the .iso, use poweriso or something to see the iso contents. Drag n drop the crack folder onto your desktop for ease of access.
Inside the crack folder, the file rld-bbc2.exe is the key generator. Run it to get your key.
After game installs, and you run it, go ahead and let it do the update, no way around it. 
Then apply everything but the keygen from the crack folder right into the main installation folder C:/program files/electronic arts/battlefield bad company 2. 
Overwrite when it asks. Don't forget those two insane text files with bad poetry. God knows how, but they fix a big bad mouse problem!
Play da game. No online available! SP only!
Any other mouse issues, even if you correctly copied all the crack files, read all them 961 comments for info on that."

SOUND EFFECTS: 10/10

- This game is a masterpiece! It's just freakin' amazing! I love this game. Probably on the top 5 of best games i've ever played! 
I'm gonna buy this for my xbox 360, for online gaming. 

I had the mouse issue too at the start of the game, but the issue is that many (like my self) didn't think that the ""jabberwocky"" and the ""pitoni"" files is just in the crack folder, just to look pretty. But it is not. Just copy those files together with the other cracks, and it's solved.

The game asked me to patch the game, when i rebooted my computer. I just patched the game, and put the crack into the BFBC2 folder. Remember to do this after patching, because when it patches it removes the cracks and installs the original ones.

- Happy gaming! I hope you like this game as much as i do. I recommend you support EA, by buying the game. It's really worth the online play too.

Another great upload from extremezone! Cheers!

here are some tips for newbs:
After downloading the torrent, use daemon tools to mount the .iso file. install the game, when it asks for the code look for the ""rld-bbc2"" file in the crack folder and open it. generate a code and write it in the setup wizard. After the installation is completed, copy over the files in the crack folder EXCEPT the ""rld-bbc2"" file to Start Menu>computer>C: drive>Program Files>Electronic Arts>Battlefield Bad Company 2

VOILA! Enjoy the game :)"

Great Gameplay & Great Graphic
Don't forget to update your driver first.

1) When the download complete, extract, unzip the rar file and install by running the Setup.exe file in the extracted folder ""rld-bbc2"".

2) Generate key in the ""Crack"" folder by running ""rld-bbc2.exe"" application. 

3) Once done installing the game you can either update the game online first or skip the update process... either way is fine.

4) Copy these 4 file from the Crack folder:

 BFBC2Game.exe
 jabberwocky.txt
 pitoni.txt 
 rld.dll

and paste it in the installation folder. Open My Computer, The default installation location is usually in
C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Battlefield Bad Company 2
Once done you should be able to play the game.

NOTE: Once the game started don't forget to set the keyboard configuration for the ""melee"" attack. you can use the ""v"" key on the keyboard for ""melee"" attack

Dont crack the .exe tell a new crack comes out or you will not be able to play it will just crash when you load a level.

if you have alredy put the crack over it you will need to back patch.

use that to backpatch. then repatch with the updater and insted of useing a small file mount the CD on demontools. it will think the CD is in. and just use the original .exe   ... so use this Battlefield: Bad Company 2 [MULTI8] No-DVD/Fixed Image

,tackfurlo,2010-05-05T03:50Z,"Probably a question I could Google and find out myself but I figure I'll ask here anyway.

In the last PC release, BF2142, they still had offline singleplayer with bots.  Yet, in Modern Warfare, the latest Ghost Recon, etc., there is a disturbing trend to remove that in favor of a campaign and then online multiplayer, and that's it, i.e. no way to practice.  The only FPS I've played in 3 years is thus UT3, and UT3 and BF are definitely not the same kind of FPS.  Hence, my question is, did they leave in offline singleplayer?"

,dudeface,2010-05-06T09:04Z,"@tackfurlo
theres no offline multiplayer with bots. the single player campaign gives you a variety of scenarios to prepare you for multiplayer battle (like taking down mcom stations and calling in strikes on tanks etc) but its disappointing you cant take on AI in a team deathmatch. BF is very diff to UT so good luck and think of it as a learning experience :P"

Like finding the crack folder and copy and pasting this and put it there.

So i just found a great u tube vid that shows a guy doing it all.

Just go to utube and write  battlefield bad company 2 crack reloaded.

The first vid that appears is the right one.Its german but theres no talking just copy everything he does.

First he mounts the thing u downloaded(i used magic disk)then as it starts to install it will ask for a code.

Go to your computer right click the drive with a picture on it..click explore...click on folder ""crack"" in it u will see ""rld-bbc2.exe"".double click it.......then generate ur key..

Then u put ur key in install..once done copy eveything from the crack folder and paste it into ur folder were the game installed..

Its all in the vid just copy exactlly what he does and u will be fine.."

,evilkim,2010-05-19T15:26Z,"!!!!! THIS GAME CAN __ONLY__ BE PLAYED IN SINGELPLAYER. FOR MULTIPLAYER YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY BUY $$$ THE GAME!!!

 MBY CRACKED SERVERS WILL COME, BUT NOT IN THE NEAREST FUTURE!!!!

Hope this helps the ones who is trying to play it in Multiplayer :-)"
,evilkim,2010-05-19T15:28Z,"- DICE and EA decided to only distribute the dedicated server files to certified ranked server providers, which means that unless some certified server provider leaks the dedicated server files, no cracker will ever get it's hands on those files.

- The game does not have listen server capabilities, which means that players can't host a server and that the files required to host a BFBC2 server are not included with the game. The game only has the client-side files to be able to join and play on dedicated servers hosted by certified ranked server providers.

The above points prove that there is currently no way for a cracker to crack any server hosting files, and remove the checks so illegal copies can join cracked servers, because there is no way for a cracker to get access to the server hosting files (dedicated server files).

If the dedicated server files are not leaked at some point (which is very likely, because the certified ranked server provided that would leak the dedicated server files would have to pay a BIG fine), then there is no way of ever playing BFBC2 online with an illegal copy of the game.

And for all you who think this is easier to crack than for instance MW2, it's not, and here's why: MW2 uses P2P for multiplayer, which means that a player is also the host of the server (we all know the annoying host migration when that player leaves the server). This means that the files for hosting a server are included with the game, because every player has to be able to be the host. This makes it a lot easier to crack because the files required for hosting a MW2 server (which are the files that have to get cracked to allow for illegal copies to join the server) are available to anyone who buys or downloads the game.

As described above, BFBC2 does not include any files for hosting a server and only certified providers have those files. So a cracker can't get those files and so he can't crack them either.

I bought the game (I actually pre-ordered it) and I can say from hours of experience that the game is absolutely brilliant in multiplayer. I had a blast finishing the singleplayer, but multiplayer is in a whole league of it's own. In my opinion the multiplayer of BFBC2 is even better than the multiplayer of BF2 or MW2, it's really that good.

So just go out and buy the game, and experience the excellent multiplayer for yourself, you won't regret it."

The instructions to install the game are on the reloaded.nfo file which you can open with notepad, and in this torrent file description.rnrn- To mount an image, download Daemon Tools (lite or not), create a virtual disk and mount the image through the rld-bbc2.iso file.rn- Install it, you can find the serial key through the keygen in the Crack folder, which you can reach going to My Computer, right clicking the BBC2 icon and selecting \""explore\"".rn- After installing the game, go to the same Crack folder and copy all the files but the keygen to your installed game directory.rn- Use the BFBC2Game crack to play.rn- In my case, I had to update the game through BFBC2Updater to be able to play. You can just cancel (or stop your internet connection) and a message will pop-up asking if you want to play the old version.rnrnHope this helps."

For those guys who are suffering from the mouse and keyboard keys(few keys not working)problem. I have got a 100% solution for them its because I am also a victim of this fucking problem.
First of all, you need to completely uninstall the game and its related directories and delete the BFBC2 folder in my documents. Then do a registry clean via any registry cleaner software. Then install a clean copy of the game and copy all the contents of the crack folder(except keygen) and paste it to the game directory and start the game and play either with the default keys or customize your own.Have Fun!!!"

As i am installing the game i get 2 options. one of them is if i would want to make a installation which requires a cd to be inserted each time i play. The second option is if i would like to make some kind of a online installation. Which one should i choose?

and another question is: should i download the update aswell? that pops up later in the installation.

,Hippiehomer,2010-12-30T08:44Z,"Here is what I did:

Step One: Drag the ISO file ""Golden CD-ROM"" into the main interference of PowerISO, I am not sure how it works for Daemon tools. After you have done that, you'll see a little golden CD-ROM, double click on it to open up the contents. 

Step Two: Find the ""Crack"" folder, it is most likely located toward the first few folders and is named ""Crack"", drag it to your desktop. 

Step Three: Close PowerISO and then go back into the original torrent file and instead of dragging and dropping that golden CD-ROM like we did before, right-click it, scroll down to ""PowerISO"" then click ""Mount Image to Drive [E:]"". After you have done this click ""Start"" then ""Computer"", look for ""CD Drive (E:)"", double-click it. Follow the directions to installing the game, when prompted for the key, use the keygen located in the ""Crack"" folder we dropped on the desktop, it is usually the last app in the folder...WAIT, we're not done yet. 

Step Four: Please don't try playing the game just yet. Click ""Start""-->""Computer""-->""Disk(C:) or where you installed the game on""-->""Program File (x86)...it varies, as long as you find the folder where the game is located""-->""Electronic Arts""-->""then copy all the files in the ""Crack"" folder except the keygen, all the files except the last one and then right-click on the folder called ""Battlefield Bad Company 2"" which is located under ""Electronic Arts"" and then click paste, Copy and Replace. Your DONE! 

This way worked for me, all the problems I read about from it not saving and the controls working are not issues I have experienced yet. Just so you guys know, this does not play online...buy the game and support the developer if you want that. Good Luck :) "

Just to keep things organized: As mailer666 said:

- Mount the .iso file using MagicDisc or Daemon Tools or Alcohol 120%

- Autorun will go on and the installation will start

- When it asks you for the serial code, go to the ""crack"" directory in the iso file (since you've mounted it) and run the .exe application it gives you the crack

- Install finished, now copy the files in the ""crack"" directory and paste them in your install folder (Program Files/Electronic Arts/Battlefield: Bad Company 2)

- THEN run the game. It works. If you run it before putting the crack files the update will go on. You don't need the update, DONT UPDATE ^^"

Find where it says DxVersion=10 or auto
Change this to DxVersion=9
Save the file.

,DreamerXristosGr,2011-08-15T15:07Z,"You have to understand that keygens and cracks are malisius but not for your pc! its malicious to the GAME because it CHANGES values etc, so antiviruses see them as viruses! its tricky cause some uploaders might aply real viruses in the crack, so you should be carefull where you download from. If you trust then follow next steps.
---------------------------------------------------
For All of you who have problems!
HOW TO INSTALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1)download DAEMON TOOLS here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6373115/DAEMON_Tools_Pro_Advanced_4.41.0314.0232_Incl_Crack
2) a)Uninstall any Daemon you might have 
    b)Install Daemon (select trial and then advanced tools in installation)
    c)reboot
    d)deactivate antivirus (at least the file monitor)
    e)open Crack.rar\Crack\Pre-Cracked
    f)right-click on taskbar -> Task manager and End any process starting with capital ""DT""
    g) go to folder (from step e) and copy those two files to where ever you installed and click ""copy and replace""
    h)reboot
3) open Daemon tools, click ""add device"". Then Drag n Drop the .iso file on the ""new driver"" inside the Daemon tools window (that's called ""mount"" .iso)
4) go to Daemon tools, on the ""new driver"" right-click -> open explorer or smthing like that (last option) and copy all crack files and keygen on your desktop with your antivirus (or file monitor) OFF
5)install game
6)copy all crack files into game directory
AND YOU ARE DONE!!!!
I suggest playing the game the first time without reactivating antivirus so you know if everythink is ok. then activate antivirus and play again, and if there is a problem that means that the antivirus deleted a crack file.

Thx extremezone for ALL your uploads!!!"

Please help me i have tried doing it in the settings, controls, the X and Y axis. Is there any way to correct this. Many people are experiencing this problem. Please help! "

,wviper,2011-09-23T04:37Z,"Error: Mouse problem (lag, slow, not moving, whatever)
Solution: Copy ALL files from the crack folder on the cd to the installation folder. So copy all these files: BFBC2Game.exe, jabberwocky.txt, pitoni.txt & rld.dll. When you did that your not done jet. When starting up the game you first need to set the Melee attack button. Go to options, and assign a key for the â€œMELEE BUTTONâ€, the V button is fine for this as you will have a gun later, and you only need to kill the first enemy with your knife. once set start the game, kill the enemy and jump off the boat using spacebar.

After download this torrent, write this in google

click the first link for download the crack that Fix the Mouse Problem 


After cracking, do not run the game from the shortcut on the desktop. Because it forces you to update the game. (You can leave update, but you have to wait). 

If you want to play NOW..... 

So run the game from the shortcut that is in the game folder ""BFBC2Game.exe."""
