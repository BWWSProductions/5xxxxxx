http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5389449/Lost.S06E05.360p.HDTV.H264

@stev: Bad... I have two more today: ""Stoning of Soraya M"" as BDrip and ""Mutant Chr."" as BluRay re-encode. Then, sometime during night, a ""Anvil - Story of Anvil"". You see, my ""cross"" is heavier than yours. ()"
,lilars26,2010-02-25T18:50Z,"...but you carry that cross so well.
Please slow down,take your slippers off,put your feet up and watch a movie(if you have one).
You spoil us too much.
Salute."
,madtown4,2010-02-25T19:12Z,"i was wondering if you had Wrong Side of Town (2010) if so i was hoping you can please upload it , when the [req] are off hold. thanks for what you do. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-25T19:49Z,"@madtown4: Please, don't get me wrong on this, but I must slow down, not in general sense, but I must drop-down: movies which are new, easy to obtain and - ""normal""-sized (according to today accepted standards).

I'll fall-back to my known ""mode"": Upload of re-encoded movies which are too big or hard to find for most people (or need to be ""fixed"" on some way). 

Otherwise, I feel stupid; in last few weeks too many disastrous uploads happened, and I can't afford that. 

Hope you'll understand what I'm sayin'."

[V],twentyforty,2010-02-25T20:04Z,"@lilars: Yes, she does... and sample too.
