     AmpliTube 3. The New King of Tone.
     More Gear. More Feel. More Power. More Tone.

     Theres a new king in tone, and its name is AmpliTube 3. A massive upgrade
     of the leading guitar and bass tone gear modeling software, AmpliTube 3 
     raises the industry standard of sound variety, realism and creative power.
     If your recording or playing rig is lacking in that rich, lush
     expressive analog warmth, then you need to check it out. With over 160
     precisely      modeled pieces of vintage and modern gear available in
     one package, AmpliTube 3 is the ultimate tone gear collection for the 
     player/producer/engineer suffering from tone angst.

     AmpliTube 3 gives you more.

     More Gear  Infinite Combinations. 
     AmpliTube 3 contains over 160 pieces of gear, more than double the amount
     of other packages, including models from the most sought-after vintage 
     collections and modern day workhorses. Youll get 51 individual stompboxes
     and effects, 31 amplifier preamp & power sections, 46 speaker cabinet 
     models, 15 high end stage and studio mics, and 17 post amp rack effects.
     Plus, with the new AmpliTube 3 open architecture, you can add more 
     packages as you need them, like AmpliTube Fender and Ampeg SVX.
