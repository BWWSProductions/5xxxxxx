,Burger666,2010-03-01T01:43Z,The Keygen is a malware worm. Avast found it immediately. Nice try guys.
,shodan5000,2010-03-02T09:52Z,"I've downloaded this and it works exactly as it should.  Learn how to unrar people.  Also Burger666, are you sure that's not just a false positive?  It is a keygen after all.  If anyone's worried about the keygen just use sandboxie to open it.  If you don't know what sandboxie is........GOOGLE IT, LEARN IT, USE IT!"
,Guitarhero66,2010-03-10T17:43Z,"I'm probally just very dumb,
but there is no keygenerator in my downloas -_-"
,hopsing2009,2010-03-12T23:50Z,seems like this guy has alot of torrents up loaded in the past few days. one of them set off my mocrosoft security with a bunch of exe files in the cache
,QuakeDirt,2010-03-17T19:25Z,"This torrent works perfectly, it's just a little confusing. First extract all of the downloaded rar files, you'll get another set of rar files. These are the files that have the keygen and installation. Extract all of those files and the keygen is not a virus, sandboxed it and scanned with Kaspersky."
,rolandignacio,2010-03-20T05:08Z,works perfectly. Thanks!
,kzzerpath,2010-03-21T05:05Z,"extracts, installs/keygens just fine, but ONLY works for me in stand-alone mode.  Can't run it in PT 8 LE, it reverts back to asking to be authorized with a 10-day warning every time.  Works fine by itself, w/ no PT involved."
,oppeiettre,2010-03-25T09:47Z,"Thank you!!!!
Work like a dream, but one question: I can't find the stand-alone ??"
,kylevaughan,2010-06-10T19:06Z,"FOR THOSE WHO CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXTRACT THIS! dont worry its not your fault, whoever made packed the files is a moron, you have to manually extract each zip file to a directory,,, each zip file contains a rar file .r00 .r01 etc. so manually extract each zip file to a directory and then extract the rars. i dont know why someone would pack a file this way, no a days everyone has high speed and personally i find it irritating dealing with stupid torrents like this just to save a few MB of bandwidth. not to mention it now take triple the hard drive space just to extract it and theres alot more work involved than simply packing the files into 1 archive. "
,kylevaughan,2010-06-10T19:11Z,"the easiest way to extract these files is by selecting all of the .zip files  and while they are all selected right click and hit ""extract files""  then select the directory you want the files to be in,  after they have extracted you will have a directory full of .r00 files   you may then extract those like a normal archive to get the files you want."
,Chardiieee,2010-06-16T20:31Z,"hey guys. look. here is how to do this.

1. HIGHLIGHT all of the .rar files.
2. right-click, and find 'extract files..'
3. extract them all to a folder of your choice.
4. find the contents in your folder, where there are a lot of 'd-ikat3w' .rar's there. open ANY ONE OF THEM and extract all contents to another folder of your own
5. run installer / keygen and enjoy!"
,drews_subin,2010-06-16T23:08Z,"Worked fine for me, thank you uploader !"
,chase6342,2010-10-17T04:03Z,how do you get the digital id?
,420Dankness,2010-11-17T22:02Z,I also had a problem with digital id; I figured it out though. When the program asks for Serial type it in > Request New Authorization code(recommended) > Connect using another computer > I don't have or dont remember my IK multimedia user account. And BINGO there's your digital ID for the keygen
,Laggy23,2010-12-19T05:52Z,Thanks man! this is an awesome program it was a little confusing to install i just kinda clicked stuff and got lucky i guess  pewww my feet stink anyways ill seed for awhile man! thanks again!
,OtakuNoEmpire,2011-01-25T17:32Z,Tnx you very much guys...Works fine ;)
,piratesvk,2011-01-29T09:32Z,Works good. Thx.
,kimpaj,2011-02-03T18:09Z,Does this work for mac??? i got the trail but the keygen in this torrent dosen't give me a serial that match up with the authorization code
,kizsge,2011-04-09T13:54Z,"Hello, I miss the file compression:  ia3w00.zip d-,  d-ia3w01.zip start from"
,voltron902,2011-07-17T16:12Z,"only works as a standalone for me. it's in my 'vst plugins' folder, but when i try to open it in cubase, it's not listed there."
,burger29,2011-07-28T22:44Z,wow that is a fucking stupid way of attempting to compress files. The files compressed once into one file would have been plenty..... Although thanks for the up.
,teo123inamoski,2011-08-06T09:51Z,"man, this is hard. xD idk what to do, im not noob, but this is causing me pain in the ass...damn."

,6789,2011-08-31T06:14Z,"ok for anyone with decompression trouble:
highlight each zip file and extract with winrar (right click menu, all files simultaneously), press no when it asks to over write existing files. once the zip files are extracted to single folder, you may extract one of the rar files as normal with winrar and it works.

to the uploader: in future dont split a split rar archive into split zips. that is retarded."
,Sploder,2011-11-07T23:37Z,"Holy crap I had this after about 5 mins, thanks a mil! Will be seeding."
,ubleader,2012-01-04T04:20Z,Thanks alot it works perfectly 
,imaclient,2012-03-10T17:44Z,"What kind of a moron splits this into 42 .rar files and then zips the .rar files...
Torrents break things into chunks by themselves. This is not necessary children."
