i am running ms sql 2005 enterprize, upgraded to SP2 on win server 2003 sp2 

upon completion of the ms dynamics installation where it shows successfull and unsuccessfull installations, i get 2 errors assiciated with the sql

1) MS SQL Reporting Service is not SP2 
2) installation has detected another instance of SQL that is not SP2
