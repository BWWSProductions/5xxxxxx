Decent movie. But not for the masses.
Liked it for being different from all the other movies in the industry. Psychological dramas are a rarity these days in Malayalam cinema.

I couldn't see the pictures hosted in Imageshack. So here's a few screen caps from the movie:

It's a shame this movie couldn't even hit the theaters...
Thanks for sharing, uploader."
