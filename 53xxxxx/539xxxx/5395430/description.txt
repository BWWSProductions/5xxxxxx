Hi all, just a little reminder, or a request if you will. 

It's disappointing to see that not many people bother to seed what they 
download. As a result the uploader often has to use bandwidth to keep older 
torrents alive for those who hop on later and it slows things down for 
everybody. It may also result in the uploader not uploading anything new as 
there is no bandwidth to spare. Keeping torrents 
open helps everybody. The seeder gets upload credit, the leecher might get 
the 
show a bit faster and it frees the regular uploaders to upload new stuff. 

So, if possible, please give what you take! Thanks

In the 1980s and '90s, numerous women recorded blistering rock, but things were quite 
different in 1976 â€” when female singers tended to be pigeonholed as soft rockers and 
singer/songwriters and were encouraged to take after Carly Simon, Melissa Manchester, 
or Joni Mitchell rather than Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath. Greatly influenced by Zep, 
Heart did its part to help open doors for ladies of loudness with the excellent 
Dreamboat Annie (reissued on a gold audiophile CD by DCC Compact Classics in 1995). 
Aggressive yet melodic rockers like "Sing Child," "White Lightning & Wine," and the 
rockmoreâ€¦ radio staples "Magic Man" and "Crazy on You" led to the tag "the female 
Led Zeppelin." And in fact, Robert Plant did have a strong influence on Ann Wilson. 
But those numbers and caressing, folk-ish ballads like "How Deep It Goes" and the 
title song also make it clear that the Nancy and Ann Wilson had their own identity 
and vision early on.
