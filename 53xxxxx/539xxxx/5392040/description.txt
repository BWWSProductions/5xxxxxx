And now for a complete discography that has Ian Boddy in it! Yes, this is the complete discography of Mark Shreeve's band, Redshift. A short description from last.fm:

Founded in 1996 by Mark Shreeve, the bandâ€™s lineup currently consists of Mark Shreeve, Julian Shreeve, and James Goddard. Rob Jenkins, a band member for most of the groupâ€™s existence, left prior to their seventh album Redshift VII - Oblivion. The bandâ€™s style ranges from Berlin School to dark ambient. Their sound is largely dependent upon older synthesiser technology, notably instruments such as the Moog 3C, which they combine with more recent digital technology.

You can probably tell that I was rushing with this one a little. The songs were renamed, but the names of everything else (e.g. covers and text files) are left unchanged. Whatever, it will remain this way now.

I will not make any more updates to this discography regardless if the band will have any more albums out. I have all of their albums to date and that's what matters.

Thanks to the guys at The Pirate Bay and at Soulseek for sharing these albums with the world.
