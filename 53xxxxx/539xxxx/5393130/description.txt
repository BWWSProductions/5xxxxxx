This is the second in Yoji Yamada's samurai trilogy.

The Twilight Samurai was the first.

Following this will be Love and Honor.


Careful viewers will note the touch of romance introduced in these three.

All in all quite a change from the swashbuckling Kurosawa movies of the

1950's and 1960's.
