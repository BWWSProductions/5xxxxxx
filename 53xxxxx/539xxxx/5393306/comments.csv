THX very much, really, I'm longing to watch it, but... 

Could you make an extra slight effort?

If you could point out to the non-norwegian speakers where could anyone find the english subtitles promised in you description of the torrent, it would be much appreciated. 

Well, if you wrote about them, you'll probably have them already. I don't think this one .srt file is gonna come along anytime soon, you see? We're not talking about Avatar or any other smash hit. Instead, we could be waiting ages for someone bilingual to accept that task.

Please, be so kind and reward us with yet another of your gifts, and upload it at subscene or any subs web of your liking. 

I know we don't specially deserve it , but I think it would be fair to all the people who, like me, have already downloaded the torrent and are seeding it without having the opportunity to enjoy it.

Thx again man, and keep it uo!"
