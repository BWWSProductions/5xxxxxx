A very proficient traditional group from Ireland, created by ace bodhran player Johnny ("Ringo") McDonagh when he left De Dannan; the band has been up and down, and has included Niamh Parsons, Sharon Shannon, Frances Black, Tommy McCarthy and Sean Keane in its lineup. Their first album, After the Ball, was a big hit, but then nothing was heard for a long time until "Many Happy Returns" which has marked a sort of resurection of the band.
