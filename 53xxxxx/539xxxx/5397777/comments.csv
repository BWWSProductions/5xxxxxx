Ah, the extraordinary life of the anti-communist, wingnut-invented prop known as 'Billy Graham'.

The man was a political tool of political sociopaths - look up his really friggin' history before watching the laughable pap offered here.

Buncha hoodoo-dazzled magical-thinking serfs, the lot of you.

Shame that 'to each his/her own' always ends up meaning 'We get to impose our anti-human bullshit on the rest of you, and you get to thank us for it'

""who jesus really was"". Yeah. Shame about the total dearth of historical evidence. Zip. Zero. No credibility whatsoever. Not that this fact bothers the crutch-dependent. 

Anti-human, anti-responsibility, anti-morality, anti-civilization, all dressed up in horseshit and circular reasoning. Delightful.

Blah."
