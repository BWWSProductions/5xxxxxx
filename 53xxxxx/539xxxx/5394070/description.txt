Visiter is the second album released by The Dodos. A special edition is being put together to include a DVD of live footage from the last show of their most recent tour.

In an April 2008 interview in the L.A. Record, Long revealed the origin of the name of Visiter. "The reason itâ€™s misspelled is because itâ€™s from a drawing this kid gave us. We played a show for a bunch of kids in South Central L.A.â€”Dorsey High. A friendâ€™s sister [Barbara Lempel] is a special-ed teacher there, so we went down there to her class and we played for the kids and it was super fun. Then it came to the kids asking us questions and then one of the kids came up to us and he gave us a drawing with that written on it. The drawing is the cover actually of the album, and justâ€”I dunno we liked it. Actually we used all of the drawings that the kids made in the artwork on the album. It was definitely a fun, interesting venture for us. Weâ€™d never played for kids beforeâ€”we didnâ€™t know what to expect but they were clapping and dancing."
