          A squad of American paratroop commandos is         
          ambushed and lost behind enemy lines. Fleeing          
        through dense forest, the squad makes an             
          amazing discovery.                                     
                                                                   
               Within the wreckage of an immense spaceship             
            are the bodies of two unhuman creatures. The             
           astonished paratroopers soon learn that Nazi            
              SS Elite troops are desperately searching                  
                for the crash site ... and other alien crew-                 
                men who may still be alive.

                  We've been meaning to fill this request and
                update our 2004 VCD of Zone Troopers for many
                moons now. We are aware it aired on MGM HD in
                2008, and there may be a copy out there, but
                until someone manages to catch it again for
                the scene this copy will be available.

                  You would think this was a Full Moon film
           when looking at the cast and crew. Many of         
            these actors were in or would go on to be in         
              Full Moon's Trancers series while the music           
              was composed by none other than Charles Band's       
             brother Richard (with complaints that he           
          ripped off John Williams, most noticeably           
          The Imperial March from Star Wars!)                  
                                                                     
                Thanks for your patience and enjoy!

            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-          
           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment             
            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,                
          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             
             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             
              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special
              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their
              many tools.

                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better
              days, we seek to relive those times, and share
              those memories. While our belief is that the
              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,
              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or
              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies
              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by
              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece
              just because it is dated.

                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital
              sources, there are still thousands of rare and
              out of print titles, many of which have no
              planned digital release. We've made it our
              mission to dig these out, clean them up using
              the best hardware and techniques available to
              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,
              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here
              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades
           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             
           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           
         get back.
