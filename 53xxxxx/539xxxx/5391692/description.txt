The Owl, also known as La Chouette, is a series of short CGI-animated episodes for children's television. The series features the eponymous owl, pink in colour, and with blue feet that "float" below his body. Each of the minute-long fifty-two episodes centres on the owl attempting to overcome unfortunate circumstances (sometimes created by his negative attitude and antisocial behavior), but end in his demise by his various appendages and body being dispensed of in unusual or comical ways. The series also feature a surrealistic world with floating objects and exploding apples.
