Judging by the poor PR campaing from label NoFormat you would think this record is worthless and should fade into obscurity. Except you'd be very wrong. Luckily here comes pastafari to save the day. The FSM will reward you in heaven with 70 noodle-virgins if you share this. And remember, sharing is caring. Download and seed! Don't let this gem fall into oblivion.
