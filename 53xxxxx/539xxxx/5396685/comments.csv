Good film but I wouldn't have paid to see it :-)
You know what though, when I put purchased DVD's after watching pirates, it just reafirms why we do it - ten minutes of trailers for other films, adverts saying 'you wouldn't steal a car' etc. If you've bought the bloody DVD why are they telling you not to buy pirate copys ?
Plus my dad, who in his 70's, can't navigate all the menus on the purchased DVDs but the ones I give him just play when he puts them in... Makes you think eh ?"

,njdss4,2010-03-15T12:22Z,"Great quality, but the movie itself is a letdown.  It's creepy, sure, but all the ""video evidence"" is made up.  It was part of a viral marketing campaign to make people see the movie.  If they hadn't said it was based off of real evidence it might have been better."
,Please_wait...,2010-03-21T23:45Z,Beware of spammers! Those that redirect you to their bogus sites so you can supposedly see the movie online. Ignore them of give them your best wishes but do not follow their links cos they often bring trouble. Also warn others when you see a spam comment.
,beyondgoodandevil,2010-03-27T00:14Z,"Exellent download, great quality for video & audio.

In widescreen, which I didn't realise, but that wasn't an issue at all.

I enjoyed the film, my other half was the opposite!

Thanks for the upload!"

movie really sucks!!!!!
one of the worst movies ever. And there are no special effects, smart plot twists or whatever hollywood normally use to make a bad movie intresting. 

real waste of time!! but thanks for the up, otherwise i would have payed 10? for this piece of shit"

,Curu82,2010-04-16T19:03Z,"This movie did something really special...
It took 3 things that I enjoy in movies (sci-fi, conspiracy plots and Milla Jovovich), combined them... and fucked it up royally.
Well done indeed. "

It seems you go out of you way to hit every single one of Extremezones torrents with your waahbulance pitchline.  Noone cares.

As to this movie not having any fucking or gang Bangs...people are getting abducted by aliens..  they're not having tea mate :D  Im thinking Multiple anal probage.. Wait for the extended version, im sure they'll show it"
,klearlycanadian,2010-04-27T05:01Z,"The aliens are here.  Like Dr. Hawking suggests, if they came they wouldn't be here for our benefit.  Probably normadic and here to conquer.  "
,Leignheart,2010-04-28T06:24Z,"Normadic? i dont think you meant that word. but steven hawkings is an idiot. seriously, anyone who thinks we have alien visitors here or had, are idiots. seriously? do you think if humans had advanced technology and we were able to find other intelligent beings we wouldnt atleast talk to them? i mean come on. they would want 1 thing or another, they would either destroy us or trade with us. but not hide from us and pretend they arent there, just so they can pick up the occasional farmer."

,remedyVenom,2010-05-26T04:40Z,"There may be spoilers in my comment!

i have to agree with njdss and curu82,
the fake 'real' footage is soo obvious, the lighting is often too bright for a 'normal' environment where someone just puts a camera there and tapes a conversation, you can see there`s professional lighting involved.. or the blurring at the shooting.. what a cheap way to save cost on those VFX bloodpacks ... ""hey lets just blur/censor it and save us an extra day of filming.."" they went for the 'Blair Witch' effect with this movie but failed badly.  It`s merely based on the topic of extraterrestrial intelligence, nothing more..i think the ONLY accurate and real footage are the recorded calls and reports people made about sighting, well at least some of them. So, i think it`s a mockery of any scientific approach on 'aliens' or unexplained phenomenoms which do exist, just not that crap. I`ve seen actual NASA footage of unknown objects being way more 'shocking' than this pisstake of a movie. And the sumerian references... pleeease.. are the japanese mangas proof of aliens cause the drawn characters have big eyes?? of course not, it`s an artistic style, and the sumerians had various styles and sculptures too, and aliens in a rocket?? arent they supposed to have fancy high-tech vessels? so it`s unlikely it was actual aliens but merely our interpretation. I think it`s more realistic that there was an advanced civilisation (no rockets though.. maybe condor-feathers ;) )before the sumerians who probably passed on some knowledge, by what i`ve read so far. If anyone else is interested to learn a little more about sumerian history and/or arts i found this link very useful http://www.crystalinks.com/sumerart.html

,Childosun,2010-10-16T19:46Z,Great download. quite thrilling movie! thnx
,ivHeroin,2010-12-05T04:03Z,"@njdss They said BASED off of real evidence meaning the original idea is from real evidence then they add things to make it more exciting for the movie. Of course its not going to be real evidence, its a movie.

@ Leignheart research ""majority 12"" or ""majesty 12"" aliens have come here and have made a deal to share technology with the united states and many meetings have happened between us higher ups and extra terrestrials. Majesty 12 was a group of 19 people specifically for alien intelligence gathering and interactions with aliens now i believe its around 40 members. Any government document with the word ""MAGIC"" on the top comes from majesty 12 you obviously have never researched any government documents about aliens/alien encounters let alone the hundreds of testimony from people with military and/or government credentials and hundreds of thousands of respectable citizen testimonies. Not including ""crazy"" people"

,Mt.RAM,2011-03-26T06:56Z,"@ Penguin76 - Why would you download it and watch the WHOLE movie before you decided it sucks this bad? The fact that you wasted that much time watching it and then writing a novel of a comment on the torrent shows how much of a life you have. And just so you know...no one really cares that much about YOUR opinion of a movie, and it is just that...an opinion...not even close to a fact. No one said that it was real...it's a movie...and you're no movie critic...so you probably would make a better convict shit-licker."

If you actually paid attention to the film, at the beginning it tells you that names and dates have been changed to protect the identities of the people. Also; no one cares about your worthless opinion. "
,jordangerlitz,2011-05-30T17:13Z,"@Penguin76 not to be a troll but of course there is no doctor with the name they used in the movie they changed it they said right at the start of the movie, and its fine if you're a closed minded and believe that we are the only life form in the galaxy but if every military in the world is investigating  and spending billions of dollar i think we should take notice cause something is there"

Everyone's entitled to have one and to voice it in a public forum, ESPECIALLY at TPB, where everything is free for the taking and for the dishing out.
