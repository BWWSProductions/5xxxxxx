Anadorei songs are like three-minute Ramones numbers compressed into less than a minute. Then the album ends with a cover of The Velvet Underground's "Sister Ray", which lasts 16 minutes! Padding? Hardly. Singer-guitarist Erieza's bansheelike wail marries bassist Maymie's hypnotic organ riff and it builds until, eight minutes in, an avalanche of white noise descends and the song gradually disintegrates into total bedlam. It's a more perfect aural take on a nervous breakdown than anything Lou Reed has done.

Ripped with XLD (116.4)

Brought to you by TQMP. (The Quality Music Project)

In this project we, fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase. Well, you all know the drill

Please feel free to join the TQMP project!

The "rules" are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include cue- and logfiles for the purists and the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)
