They're like little kids who pout when someone says the truth about them and the truth doesn't feel very good. Out of emotion, they make stuff up and lash out in ways that attempt to draw their adversaries into childish arguments and bring us down to their level. Soooo cute.. :)"

Michael Moore is fat, do you lash out at him? No? Al the Goricle? He's looking a little plump these days.. Any personal attacks? Probably not... Tiny Teddy Kennedy? He was a fat fat fatty...

Where are your personal attacks against the ""liberal lion""?

Bottom line - You attack him because you don't agree with him, not because he's fat. Unfortunately for you, you can't factually back up a single argument or provide even one instance where Glenn has been wrong so you resort to childish personal attacks. You can't use the truth because it's not on your side...so you sling insults like a monkey flings dung.

As for the claim of retardation...do you really think a multi-billion dollar company (and the most successful in its industry) would take a chance on a ""retard""? Do you really think they'd give someone with mental deficiencies or stunted brain development his own show in one of the most popular time slots of the day? Really? You actually think that?

This might be a case of the pot calling the kettle black..."
,cbair79,2010-03-02T18:29Z,"I'm sorry that Glenn has some how wronged you to the point that you feel you have to lash out at him... What did he do? Do you want to talk about it?

Can you give a single example of what makes him an ""idiot""? Can you give a single instance where he's been wrong and didn't correct himself? Do you even listen to his radio show or watch his TV show?"
,cbair79,2010-03-04T21:49Z,Still waiting for a single example...
,cbair79,2010-03-17T21:33Z,Typical mindless answer that oozes out of the mouths of liberals when they've are so filled with hate and vitriol that they can't see the facts. They are so bent on achieving a socialist utopia that they pay no attention to our history or the history of every other socialist failure.
