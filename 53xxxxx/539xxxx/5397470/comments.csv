,[TSAT]Flow,2010-02-27T22:10Z,"@latm_kmol
You have to run the launcher in the SC2 Beta folder..."
,Frice,2010-02-27T23:35Z,"You gotta run the sc2beta exe, you will get a b.net type window that auto-dls/auto-installs the new patch that is required to run this crack.

FYI this was out atleast a day earlier than this torrent was posted, check darkblizz 
""http://inquistor.info/darkblizz/wiki/doku.php?id=start""
has a list of informative sc2beta sites. Once they crack AI you will know it (although it isnt done yet, but they do the AI scripts already;or so i've read.)"
,Frice,2010-02-27T23:37Z,"To clarify to work this crack you need to update your beta client to the latest ver, that means running the 'sc2beta.exe' and getting it straight from blizz, altough I'm sure there are other methods."
,Fxteamz,2010-02-28T01:25Z,"We have the confirmed patch in our new blog that fixes the Sc2 beta.
And Beta Keys

,SmokeNchoke,2010-02-28T20:06Z,"I downloaded this yesterday and it worked great!! I tried using it today and it wouldn't work, also avg read it as a trojan. I'm guessing this is because of blizzard, but is there any other launchers i could use???"
