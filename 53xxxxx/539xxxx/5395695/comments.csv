,wutmast,2010-10-15T07:24Z,"there is just one problem for me: there are no files to UNZIP, only for files to ZIP, what am I supposed to do with those VTY files?

otherwise great torrent thankies :D"
,abc559,2010-10-15T22:48Z,"I have the same problem, when i joined all 25 files it just gives me a file, i dunno what the extensioln is, i have tried .zip and .iso, but neither worked, some1 help plz QQ"
,nisseman123,2010-10-24T11:47Z,"How to extract the files:

1. Start winrar

2. Go into the downloaded folder and mark the vty-0294.0** files.

3. Click on the button ""Extract to"" in the top."
,nonameform,2010-10-25T10:10Z,"I find it hard to believe that it's a retail version, but as long as it works I have no trouble with it. Works perfectly with Encore USA digital download patch 1.15 (that's why I doubt that it's retail; there is a small chance that I might have downloaded the other patch though since both pages look exactly the same -.-). It seems to me that Editor is present both on the image and is copied to the folder during the installation (not installed though, just copied!), so you end up with an image that has Editor on it and same file on your hard drive.

Game works without CD of course, no DRM or other annoying stuff."

,gadaver33,2011-05-31T18:07Z,"Hi, REALLY new to this whole unzip, mount/ burn business lol.
