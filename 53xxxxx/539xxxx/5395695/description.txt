GAME NOTES

This is the RETAIL boxed edition of Torchlight
and not  a  homemade  iso  or  preview  build.
The difference is quite clear as  ONLY  RETAIL
gets a bonus pet, the Ferret, as well  as  the
the full editor on a DVD. Install the optional
editor seperately after the main game setup.


Torchlight is an exciting new action  role  playing  game,
where players explore randomly generated  dungeon  levels,
battle a variety of monsters, and pursue endless fame  and
fortune. From the designers and leads  of  Diablo,  Diablo
II, Fate, and Mythos! This hack-and-slash adventure is set
in the mining settlement of Torchlight, a town founded  on
the  discovery of a rare and mysterious ore called  Ember.
This valuable ore has the power to enchant and corrupt but
its value is such that many  are  willing  to  risk  their
lives for it. Now,  miners  have  uncovered   Torchlights
buried past: a dangerous labyrinth of  caverns,  monsters,
and ruined civilizations beneath the ground that have been
corrupted by Embers dark influence. As Evil threatens  to
overrun the town, a Champion is needed. Players will  have
the opportunity to save the town of  Torchlight,  battling
through rock and fire, through  lost  cities,  and  across
ancient tombs on a perilous journey to cleanse the  mines.
As one of three Character Classes,  Players  will  explore
randomly  generated  dungeon levels, battle a huge variety
of  monsters,  and  pursue  endless  variations  of   fame
and fortune. The Ember beckons...how will you answer?
