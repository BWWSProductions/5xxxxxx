,cjaccardi,2010-07-01T03:45Z,im lost too how do you use this file ?
,sbdogmaz,2010-09-15T09:49Z,"I dnld another one with the same problem.  That one was 446mb RAR'd up and after a CUE file.  I burned it to disc to see if the contents were different from the folders I saw opening and copying to my hard drive.

What I did then was open up VLC and chose Media and Open Folder Option.  However this way skips the Introduction.  So I think a way around this is change the name to:  
00.00. Introduction

Ok that worked and then changed the Conclusion file around to the same format:

00.14. Conclusion

Now the Exercise one I have no idea.  I guess that might be worthless?

How do other Lynda video tutorials work?"
,sbdogmaz,2010-09-15T09:58Z,"Ok just found this from TopTenReviews about Lynda Photoshop review:

One organizational aspect we donâ€™t like is how the lessons donâ€™t play continuously. When you select a video tutorial to watch, it plays through and stops; even if it is only a 2 minute video. It would be nice if it played lessons sequentially like a DVD where selecting the first lesson in a chapter begins the video and then continuously plays through all lessons in that chapter before stopping.

So this is normal, seems weird.

Sounds like the Exercise ones you need a subscription:

The best value is the premium annual subscription which costs $375 and includes access to project files used in each lesson, which is helpful because most of the instructors ask you to reference the files to follow along."
