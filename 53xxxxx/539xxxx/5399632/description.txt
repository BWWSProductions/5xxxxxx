Since 1974, Lazaris has channeled through Jach Pursel, his only channel, offering his friendship and love and generating a remarkable body of tools, techniques, processes, and pathways for our Spiritual Journey to God/Goddess/All That Is.


"We are here to remind you that pain and fear are not the only methods of growth; that you can more elegantly grow through joy and love. . . that you create your own reality . . . that there is a God/Goddess/All That Is who loves you, who knows your name. . . and that you love good enough"   â€”  Lazaris

â€œBelonging: You can heal love's pain, and you can assuage love's fear. You can love in ways you can only yet hope and imagine; you can work magic and change your reality in ways that only belonging can bring." (Lazaris)

Our lives have become enriched; our love is more radiant; and our spirituality is exuberant with vitality.

We can lift to new levels of living and loving; we can reach new dimensions of magic and miracles. And yet we wonder: Are we wrong or unappreciative to want or to expect more? During this stunning intensive we found more: We found the miracle of belonging. After exploring the Bounty and the Power of Belonging, Lazaris guides us through the Seven Challenges to Belonging 
and through our Personal Dark Wood. 

Then we find our way to Encounter the Ancients. In this magical and mystical encounter we receive gifts . . . Seven Gifts of Belonging . . . and then the magic happens: The miracle of belonging can unfold.

These excerpts are not the whole of this incredible excursion, but with these excerpts we can remember and reunite. With these excerpts we can begin a journey of extraordinary value. 

Lazaris recorded a new meditation, The Miracle of Belonging, specifically for these excerpts and for those who are listening (part 3 in the files shared).

The length of these excerpts is approximately 7 1/2 hours.
