I had to delete \(install dir)\WillowGame\CookedPC\Maps\Menu_Map\IpDrv.u

This might be because I installed my BL via Razor1911's release + both RELOADED DLC releases + this release.  This torrent also works when using the RELOADED base version of BL (obviously).

Great job, RELOADED!"
,tdonkey,2010-02-27T12:22Z,"Oh, I also wanted to add that this is working in both XP64 (Abit AA8: P4 4.1GHz, 2GB DDR2, GTX260) and Windows 7 x64 Ultimate (EVGA 760: i7 920, 6GB DDR3, GTX285), both with settings cranked all the way up, no crashes yet!"

,Groyer,2010-02-28T01:12Z,"Will this crack work if I installed the Razor version of this?

I haven't installed any DLCs at all, just the 1.2.1 crack. Just want to double check this before I realize I've wasted my time."
,Kujajin,2010-02-28T20:15Z,"I can't get this to work. I am using the reloaded version of borderlands. I extract into the Borderlands folder (2k Games/Gearbox Software/Borderlands), and say yes to all when it asks to replace. I then run the application afterwords and it said it stopped responding or there was an error. Then it gave me a large error message, stopped responding or error'd again and that was it. Please help!"
,Kujajin,2010-02-28T20:18Z,"To add to that, for some reason now my normal borderlands file (as I made a copy) will not work. Wtf!"
,Zahny,2010-02-28T22:33Z,"@ Everyones Problems,   Iv Run this DLC with both reloaded and Razor1911 basic game, and workd what u have to do to get it working right from what i can tell,  is Download DLC 1 - 2 - 3 From Reloaded and copy them into the Install folder as they came out, so  Install borderlands, Copy Neds island, then copy moxxi, then copy this file replacing files as they ask, and it works fine for me."
,maheswar,2010-03-01T00:48Z,"Yes, that is exactly what i want to say. I dont know why problems come up with you guys.

Me, I installed razors Borderlands v1.0. Worked perfectly. I did not install any update (1.2.x). Secondly i unrared Reloaded's zombie island dlc 1 on the installation folder, overwriting. Worked perfectly. Third, i did the same with Reloaded's Mad Moxxis dlc2. Worked perfectly.

Then, the 3rd dlc was released. I was worried it might not work for me coz i didnt install any updates. Still, downloaded the 3rd Reloaded dlc from demonoid (at that time it was not yet in TPB)

It is a mystery that the file size is just 1.99GB because the 1.3 update is also included in it.Oh well, someone above stated the reason why it is bigger.

And then the same thing again. Just unrared it on the installation directory and started the game from the exe in the binaries folder. Again, works like a charm. No extra patches, no cracks, no messing around with files.

Tested this on Vista 32(my desktop) and 7HP 64bit.(my laptop). Played perfectly fine on coop lan with a friend.

So, what i want to say is that, if u r having problems, it is not with the game files. If u follow Reloaded's simple method in the nfo file, everything should be fine. The problem is with your hardware or software. If ur rig meets the sys requirements, check your drivers and other microsoft stuff.

If u r still having problems, uninstall borderlands completely, delete ur installation folder and also your save game folder manually. 
Run a registry cleaning software. 
And then go to start menu, run and type regedit. Go to edit and find. type borderlands and hit enter. Delete the entry that comes up.
 Dont worry about the warning. After that press F3 and then again delete the next entry. Press F3 again.Delete. Keep doing this until you see the ""finished xx registry"" comes up.

Restart  system and install Borderlands* again and the dlcs as i stated above in that manner. Dont install any patches or cracks. Should work.

*Install the main game properly. Follow the  exact instructions in the nfo. This one is not like other games. You have to do some copy pasting while installing. Its like a minigame.

If you havent downloaded the main borderlands yet,and you dont want to go through all these steps, it is better to download the torrent which all the 3 dlcs is included."

,CHOOKA03,2010-03-01T08:26Z,Why is it when I try to play online it says I have no connection? I do have a net connection and am logged into Gayspy.
,maheswar,2010-03-01T12:04Z,"meluckee. 
the message indicating new content should appear. At least for me it did.

Is your main borderlands the razor version? Have you installed the dlc the first and second dlc reloaded sucessfully? 
Did you do any updates from ver1.00 or any crack?

The way is the fast travel station for this. Browse the stations, scroll down. You should see T-Bone junction there. Go there to meet General Knoxx.

If you dont, here are a few steps.

Do a system restore somewhere before you unpacked the kaos one. Dload this reloaded version(for me, i dloaded the smaller ver from demonoid) and follow mentioned steps.

Dont do any patch or crack.

If still not ok, then u ve to reinstall using the process as stated above. Will take some time but it is worth it. This dlc is amazing.

It works even online play !

,Torx8,2010-03-07T13:38Z,"works 100%.. just extract and replace to the borderlands installation dir, replace all files, run the game... remember though, you HAVE to have the other 2 DLC's for this one to work.. if im not mistaken.. but shouldn't be =P"

,RhymesMatter,2010-03-17T16:30Z,Guyz so to clear out the confusion and for those whining about the patch 1.3...the dlc is PRE-patched in other words when u install the DLC go and check the binaries and see the Borderlands.exe.....File Version:1.3! Stop asking for patch and cracks reloaded did it for u!
,homeslice690,2010-03-23T04:36Z,"I downloaded this torrent and ran the game succesfully until I tried to go into either the Underdome or Jakobs Cove.  When i went in either of these places, an eror popped up that said ""general protection fault"" and then a bunch of lines that were all saying that files were missing from the borderlands.exe file.  Just in case anyone asks, i installed the game correctly, jakobs cove then moxxie then the armory, and everything else works fine, i can even get into the 3rd dlc location and get quests, just not go into he 1st or 2nd dlc.   thank you for your time"

,Judd85,2010-04-24T00:53Z,"This is a great upload, I started off with razors base bl. I then updated that to 1.2.1 with update bypass. Well to day I got all the dlc and installed them in order. With the first two I just copyed the DLC file in cookedpc. And checked the game after the install of each dlc, no problems. With the general knoxx addon in unrar to any file then went in a copied everything in the borderlands directory, prob didn't have to do it that way but it works perfect no problems. So all of reloaded's DLC works with razor's Borderlands. I made sure everything was up to date. People Google is a beautiful thing don't let it go to waste, and read all the comments. My thanks to Reloaded and Razor. "
