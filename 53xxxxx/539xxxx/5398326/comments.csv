,dest4mex,2011-03-01T03:00Z,"So, how does one use the .srt file. I dl'd it and I tried to drag into the movie as someone suggested, didn't work. MAn, looks like a great flick, too bad I don't speak french. why not just hard code it? "
,columbuzz,2011-03-20T16:04Z,Movie: 12/10 !
,AriGold45,2011-07-25T03:53Z,"My Subs work just fine, but I guess it depends on what Media Player you're using.  VLC won't work on my computer for some reason, although I used it for years just fine.

Now I use ACE DivX Player and as long as the .srt file is in the same folder as the movie, it automatically plays the movie with the subs included.  

Note: If you're making a movie for someone and want to fuck with them, you can open an .srt file in notepad and use the replace function to change all instances if the main character's name to something else... Your name, their name, Dirk Digler, & whatever else...  Then hardcode the subs or use ConvertX to burn to a DVD"
,AriGold45,2011-07-25T03:54Z,"@Alan1996-

Don't tell people the movie doesn't work just because YOU can't figure out how to play the subtitles.  The movie works fine... Google to learn how to use .sub files"
,torrentadikz,2011-09-18T04:52Z,in english????
,arc_lighting_100w,2012-02-04T01:47Z,"All of the previous mentioned downloads of sub titles do actually work, but aren't really worth bothering with. They only gloss over the overall plot of the Parisian suburbs and in-fighting with-in government. Along with references to a ""Harriburton"" industrial company.

Without the dark humour and sarcasm of the the genuine subtitles, plus the off the cuff banter between the two lead actors everything degenerates into a boring action film.

This is a film which I will either buy on DVD, or God forbid, start to learn French.
