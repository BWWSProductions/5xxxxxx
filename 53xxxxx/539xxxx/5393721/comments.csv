If your still having trouble, check your connection, torrent program, the time of day or find more trackers.
I'm connected to 51 of 61 seeds downloading at 1.2mb's - 1.4mb's (my peak speed) without more trackers."
,mattdahack,2011-08-27T19:00Z,"System admin here : Just wanted to say this DIDN'T work at all. I tried it on 3 Vista x64 installations. To reset some corporate laptops. No one remembered the passwords. This acted like it was changing the passwords, but nothing changed and I ended up wiping the 3 laptops because this could not reset the passwords. I tried both 6 and 6.5 versions of the x64 edition. I am not sure what is up with these copies."
,Streelock,2011-09-11T05:05Z,"@mattdahack This happened because you are not really a systems admin, are you? It states right on the Locksmith program itself that it only resets LOCAL account passwords. Since it did not work, this would meant that they were DOMAIN accounts. If this really was a corporate environment I would assume that there is a Windows server somewhere that has Active Directory running on it. It's very simple, go to Active Directory Users and Computers on said server, look in the users group for the idiots who forgot their passwords, and right click on the user and select reset password. "
,fluffy56,2012-01-25T19:28Z,"@mattdahack: Look at Streetlock's comment for a very high possible explanation.

if its not on a domain and its a local user account, use Offline password changer on hiren`s bootcd to fix this problem of yours. I've done it multiple times and it works perfectly."
