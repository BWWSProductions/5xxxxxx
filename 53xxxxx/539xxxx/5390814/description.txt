Here is my second themed mix of the year which took some extra time to complete.  It really gets tough when you try to make these things perfect in a single take (still havent come close).  The vast choice of new house tracks available at the time also made it hard to narrow down my selections; its sometimes a bit overwhelming especially when you're trying to keep a particular flow or feel. 

I recently downloaded some old school Doctor Who episodes which always remind me of when I watched them with my Father as a kid.  He used to watch the show all the time and I'll never forget the opening theme music so I mixed together the opening track....an ode to Doctor Who.  The Dalek's used to scare the shit out of me as a kid (am I alone on this?).


Enjoy!
