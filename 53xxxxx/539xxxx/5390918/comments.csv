,JClair,2011-10-18T09:15Z,HELP!!
,JClair,2011-10-18T10:01Z,"I tried to copy ""FLRegkey.reg"" into User/Library/Preferences/Image-Line, but that folder does not exist. There is no Library folder in the user folder, and if I go to my Library/Preferences folder, there is no Image-Line folder. I did find a folder ""Library/Application Support/Image-Line,"" but pasting the FLRegkey.reg there does nothing. Please help me out. I just switched to a Mac and I'm lost. Thanks a bunch."
