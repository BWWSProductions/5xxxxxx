Episode notes.................: Besides visiting exotic and remote ski areas, another niche of Jimmy Petterson's journalism has been to visit small,
                                little-known powder paradises in the heart of the Alps. Les Marcottes falls into that category.There, the Falquet 
                                brothers are local, world famous, freeriders and innovative ski-film makers with an interesting story to investigate.
                                They make films featuring off-piste skiing at night! They take their lives in their hands hucking cliffs in conditions
                                of darkness. There is some stunning night footage here. Jimmy looks at the current trend toward extreme skiing and
                                wonders if it is necessary to have one's life at stake to get a kick out of skiing? But this is not all.
                                Jimmy visits nearby Salvan, where future Nobel-Prize winner, Guglielmo Marconi, first successfully tested wireless communication.
                                He also meets a ski-instructor/farmer in this conservative Swiss village, learns to milk a cow with him and realizes
                                that the old traditions live on here.
