I don't have a detailed description of this show, but economic/financial news and the analysis of economic issues largely takes center state.

...and there's much more.

 


Familiar themes: US government warmongering, deceit and theft; the steady path to an ever more oppressive police state; wars and threats of wars being used to placate Israel and distract US citizens from economic disaster and the ticking debt timebomb



Mike manages to present powerful, persuasive stuff without screaming and yelling.
Please give his show a listen.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 part of all contents. 

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.

================================================================

Mike Rivero launched What Really Happened [initially called Rancho Runamukka] as a subpage on his business web site in 1993 asking pointed questions about the death of White House Deputy Council Vincent Foster.
As more and more investigations revealed more government deceptions, the project grew in size and eventually moved to its own domain [whatreallyhappened.com] where it resides today.
His WRH website is among the top ten ranked daily political news sites on the Internet, with a global readership in the millions.  What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.
Rivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening.
