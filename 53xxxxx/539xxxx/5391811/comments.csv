,iksi99,2012-05-07T22:34Z,"@vrgadin It does seem to hang, and I need to kill explorer.exe. It freezes Explorer totally. Next up, I try to unpack the .iso using 7zip, and end up trying to end the process from task manager. It froze at 99%, unpacking Setup.exe! Any suggestions? I think .iso might be corrupt."
