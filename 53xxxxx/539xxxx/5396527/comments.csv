,Nakmoshna,2010-02-27T08:31Z,If you want to play online buy the game.. for the most part cracked/downloaded games dont work online
,Bean-Bandit,2010-02-27T16:28Z,How stupid can you be. You need a legit cd key to play online.

,genraltx,2010-02-27T21:33Z,"FFS noobs didnt you read my post.

I have the fucking game pre ordered and i want this torrent so i can have it pre loaded (install and just wait to play)

So i want to use my cd key to play online obviously

I just want to know if i install this disc if its gona basicly want this disc to be installed all the time or can i just use any bad company 2 (obv) disc"
,KillTheNoob,2010-03-03T12:30Z,"I understood you man, I still can't answer your question tho. In theory a legit CD Key from a bought game should work but sometimes the server checks whatever bits it needs to check in the .exe, if it's cracked it can sometimes boot you depending on the game but if you install the game as normal then chuck your DVD in the drive and put the key in it might work. Does BC2 make you put the serial in when you install or when you play cause that might mean that you just have to wait to install with the bought disc. Enjoy."
