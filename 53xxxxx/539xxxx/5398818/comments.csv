Can you please write up some sort of instructions on how to use the files? I'm not a complete idiot I'm just not sure if I'm going to be able to figure it out. Thanks for uploading this."
,BRUNO001,2010-03-02T22:00Z,"I got it to run, but whenever I try to generate a level I get ""Client error! The game broke! [Java.lang.NullPointerException]"" after post-processing. I have the latest java and tried both infdev and sneakpeek folders."
,Onlags,2010-03-03T03:06Z,Oh man how do u got it to run? Are you using batch file or something else? I spend all day and cant figure it out. My head is hurts now lol
,NeMoD6989,2010-03-05T22:06Z,"Grab the indev files from the official site, drop these files into that folder replacing them, run the client. 

But it's glitched, a file is missing and it updates the replaced files. 

Good job uploader."
,Drake616,2010-04-06T14:01Z,"""Dont fucking complain if you dont know how to use the files.""

You're a dumbass uploader, you give us a torrent and no instructions and then even say ""No complain"" you're a fucking idiot.
