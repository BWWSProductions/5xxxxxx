[T],ADDdog,2010-03-16T13:16Z,"BioTube has no clue what hes talking about, this series airs in 16:9, the ""top and bottom cut off"" is in fact true, the part thats cut off is BLACK theres absolutely nothing there, so its just a waste of pixels"
,RThsA,2010-03-16T13:26Z,"ADDdog is right. FMAB is 16:9.

BioTube is just a retard."
