,aawaaz,2010-11-23T17:04Z,"click of Hindi=shutter of Thailand; Its a photo image of that movie. That's all. Nothing else. Why these can't think anything else other than copying? The direction of Shutter is far superior than Click. Ananda Everingham too surpasses in his acting compared to Shreyas Talpade. Whatever may be the movie, I thank the uploader for uploading."
