Having already watched 2010 Men's and Women's final games, I have become an addict of your superb uploads. I had never had a chance to watch Curling in widescreen HD format. Video and Audio quality is extraordinary. This is a Joy.

Please keep uploading future curling events and if possible round robin games of some other 2010 teams. Chinese, danish, Russian and German girls especially. I have not had a chance to watch Schรถpp for a long time.

Also, I should greatly appreciate if friends from other major Curling countries (!) could upload Curling events in such quality,  as we have no opportunity to watch Curling in our national TV's.

So tronik123 (!) Endless thanks for your superb  contributions. My best regards. "
