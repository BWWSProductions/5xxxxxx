Plot:
	Splinterheads tells the story of Justin Frost, a slacker whose life is 
	turned upside down when a traveling carnival rolls in to town for the 
	summer, bringing with it an outrageous crew of carnival workers, who 
	call themselves 'splinterheads' and earn a living by hustling an endless 
	stream of townies out of their hard-earned cash. When Justin begins to 
	fall for one of them, a striking, street-smart con-artist named Galaxy, 
	he finds that there are a few people in his life complicating his pursuit 
	of his dream girl: a love-sick police sergeant who happens to be his mom's 
	ex-boyfriend, his 116-year-old grandfather who is the newly minted 
	"World's Oldest Living Man," his best friend and current employer Wayne 
	Chung, and Galaxy's insanely jealous, belligerent carnie boyfriend Reggie.
