The reporter even goes along with a roadside bombing mission where one sees firsthand the folly of a fanatical, but amateur group of militias at work. I was so impressed by the documentary; I invited my friend who is fluent in English, Pashtu, Urdu and Persian to watch it with me to get his opinion. To my great surprise, virtually ALL of the spoken language was Persian. There is no explainable reason that a group being represented as Taliban/Hesbi fighters would all be speaking Persian. For one, the vast majority of Persians are Shia, which do not get along very well at all with the efforts of the Suni radicals (in spite of them both being Muslim, their differences are not unlike those between the Catholics and Protestants of Northern Ireland). If the language spoken by the fighters were even 50/50 Pashtu/Persian, there might be some reasoning. But it is 100%, in an area where Persian language is by all accounts virtually unknown. There is even a new fighter introduced whom it is claimed just recently came down from Uzbekistan. When he speaks... Persian. I've always had the greatest respect for the perceived independence of PBS, and its tendency to report/expose government conspiracies, etc. However, something is going on here. Why would PBS go so far as to produce such a staged act. This is a staged act by none other than PBS. I guess they figured nobody in the USA would ever be the wiser. Something is going on here. Now I can?t even believe PBS anymore."
