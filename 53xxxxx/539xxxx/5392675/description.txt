  A flying saucer orbits the 1950s Earth. It lands in Washington, DC, on the
  Mall. The lone occupant steps out and is shot by a jumpy soldier. Gort, a
  large and very powerful robot appears to save him and is able to melt tanks 
  with the slightest bit of his power. The wounded alien orders Gort to stop 
  his rampage and is taken to a hospital from which he escapes in order to 
  learn more about this planet, even moving in as a boarder with an Earth 
  family. When they begin to suspect him, he reveals himself, along with the
  news that Gort is a member of a race of super-robot enforcers invented to
  keep the peace of the galaxy that will destroy the Earth if provoked.
