THE SECRET ARMORY OF GENERAL KNOXX...

ABOUT THE GAME...
Borderlands goes to ELEVEN! You may have seen some games raise their level cap by 5, or maybe even 10, but with The Crimson Lance Assassination Squads wreaking havoc and Crawmerax the Invincible being all invulnerable and stuff we knew you'd need more than just 10. And that's why Borderlands goes to ELEVEN! The Secret Armory of General Knoxx adds new guns, new Class Mods, new vehicles, new missions, and increases the level cap by ELEVEN. Once you factor in all the new enemy types that need killing you're going to need eleven just to keep up. The Secret Armory of General Knoxx is an add-on pack for Borderlands that raises the level cap to 61, adds new guns, vehicles, Class Mods, shields, enemy types, and missions. In other words...best add-on ever. Of all time. Forever. The End.
