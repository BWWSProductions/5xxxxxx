Thanks, atleast somebody understands. I just checked. ~1100 peers. With only ~60kb/s I get from my ISP it's real hard to keep these people happy.

You know how to get an instant download? Support the developer and buy the game. I do this for fun. I absolutely love this game, and I hope it convinces some of you that would otherwise not buy the game that it is 110% worth the money."

People who have not installed Borderlands prior to downloading this torrent might get the following error when running Borderlands.exe:

""This application failed to start because the configuration of the application is incorrect, reinstalling might solve the problem.""

To fix this, people will need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable from here:  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=32BC1BEE-A3F9-4C13-9C99-220B62A191EE&displaylang=en

If you got 60kb/s then why havent you been using it for what is now at least an hour?

Trackers report no seeding for in excess of an hour.
And 60kb/s means the torrent would have been fully seeded in less than a day so your doing something wrong.

If your not in a fit state to seed a torrent then you should not be uploading it,let somebody do it for you.

,tdonkey,2010-03-08T00:36Z,"This torrent works great, folks - I have friends playing with me via this torrent in the new DLC.

There is no installer needed for this to work.  You just need to have the correct framework installed, at least DirectX 9.0c, and that's it.  For software requirements at least.

If you are experiencing crashes all the time, or can't get into the game, google your error.  There are posts on numerous workarounds on Gearbox's forums.  AMD Phenom processors require a workaround.  Certain older multi-core CPU's require a workaround (run the game, immediately open task manager, right-click on Borderlands.exe in the Processes tab, Set Affinity, CPU 1).

This game will not run well on older machines.  There are many different things you can try, but this is a somewhat GPU-intensive game.

This torrent works, and saves people like me hours of explaining file replacement during installation to technically-challeneged friends.  Thanks again Arctic!  Post your SPECIFIC errors here and I will try to help, people!

Include the exact file paths, take out your username if you want."

If you've had Borderlands working before, you should be set.  Otherwise, download the MS Visual C++ Redistributables mentioned on page two of these comments, along with DirectX 9.0c or better and the new .NET frameworks.

Now for the errors. One person said to just download another copy or buy one then just install this one after that. That is just ridiculous. The reason yours worked was because it gave you all your needed updates and components from the manufactured CD (or digital DL) and this is a game rip making the game believe it was installed via CD or Digital DL.  

These are the things you will need to make sure this game will work. I had pretty much all your errors as well and this is how i fixed them. First make sure all your Video Card drivers are as current as possible (considering this is a 5month old game) and that you have .Net Framework, Visual C++ 2008 SP1, and Direct X up to date as well. i will provide the links for the current downloads.

2) Copy the C:\Documents and Settings\YOUR-USERNAME\My Documents\My Games\Borderlands folder to your desktop.  Delete the original.

It doesn't appear fuzzier than the native resolution, in fact it seems to look better. My mouse also seems to move more fluidly.

1920x1080 can be selected at 60hz,65hz,70hz,85hz and 120hz. I would like to be able to play Borderlands in 1920x1080@120hz, but there appears to be no way to select the refresh rate from within the game.
