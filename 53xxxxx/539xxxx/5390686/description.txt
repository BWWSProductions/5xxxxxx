Scheduled Guests
................

[show description from the Infowars web site]


No guests scheduled today. [Alex says he cancelled all scheduled guests so that he can talk about news]


A lot of attention is devoted to Debra Medina's betrayal of all her 911-truther supporters.


In the 2nd hour Alex talks briefly with Karen Quinn-Tostado from Oregon, organizer of the grassroots April 15 national strike/boycott movement about that project.  Alex indicates his intention to have her on as a guest in the near future.


In the 3rd hour Alex addresses the criticism he's been receiving for Jim Cramer [globalist, Wall Street cheerleader on CNBC] running ads on Alex's show.  Ted Anderson also talks about this.  Both are very defensive -- "I guess we just can't do anything right!"


Alex also takes a number of calls.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume support or endorsement on my
 part of all contents. 

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
