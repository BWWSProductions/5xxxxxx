,whalesaver,2010-03-02T03:33Z,Cool man. I hope you are gonna do one for 301-350!! I need them bad
,left2die,2010-03-03T07:37Z,"I wanted to have them ready for MHRC350, but then packing took longer than expected and I had to repack them, because the Bay does not accept such large torrents. Well, here they are. As you can read in the .nfo, I put some effort in it :)"
