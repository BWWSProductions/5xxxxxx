Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell was a 1989 compilation album featuring bands that performed at the Moscow Music Peace Festival. It was put out by the Make a Difference Foundation. Each band covered a song from a famous rock band or solo artist. The bands and solo artists whose songs were covered had members who suffered a drug- or alcohol-related death. The liner notes include an extensive dedication list of such artists. The album closes with two collaborative efforts between the various bands: a cover of Led Zeppelin's "Moby Dick" and a live medley of songs from Elvis Presley and Led Zeppelin.
