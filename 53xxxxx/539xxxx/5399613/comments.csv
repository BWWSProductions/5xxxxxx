[V],bubanee,2010-06-13T00:39Z,"Cheers All! :))
As for missed items i only used what CD's i have as stated in the first 3 lines of the description page.. The Extra's folder was sourced from 'Known People' 
There's that many bootlegs and so called unofficials out there i could easily make that many Pts.. But this is all you need as a good start for previous and new fans alike.. :)))"

Pink Floyd for LIFE!!! :)))"
