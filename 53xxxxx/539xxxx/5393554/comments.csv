,sterfry48,2010-03-02T05:17Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD! HAS A VIRUS! The virus is av.exe and it goes under the name of vista internet security. It took me a long time to figure out what it was that infected my computer.
,thegreatdevo,2010-03-03T03:16Z,what the fuck are you talking about? there are no viruses in this or any of my torrents. get your spam bullshit out of here.
,sterfry48,2010-03-03T23:30Z,What the fuck does it sound like I'm talking about? Of course you'd say there aren't any.

,thegreatdevo,2010-03-04T04:41Z,clean. no viruses.
,adriaanvanderklooster,2010-03-05T14:30Z,"Bullocks, this torrent is completely clean according to the norton scanner on my laptop and the avg scanner on my desktop. Apart from that, the sound quality is good, although I'd have preferred a little higher bitrate."
,systemofadownlive,2010-03-05T19:06Z,"It's clean, thanks"
,exxodus37,2010-03-09T19:46Z,"Clean. 
This is an amazing album. Rolling Stone  gave it only 1.5 stars, but I think they were listening to it with the wrong idea in mind. I think it's a vary artful and interesting interpretation of his album.

Thank you thegreatdevo for being the first (and currently only) person to upload this. I appreciate it."
,exxodus37,2010-03-09T19:47Z,"....And by ""vary"", I mean ""very""."
,the_toasted,2010-03-12T15:23Z,"this torrent is perfectly clean, sterfry48 you are a stupid shitcunt


great upload, it kinda suprises me why there is only one single torrent of this album, since it's out for about 2-3 weeks on itunes (and 3 days in stores)"
,TGWGO,2010-03-15T21:43Z,If anyone wouldn't mind could someone people upload this in FLAC or 320kbps MP3? If not I'll upload when I purchase the album.
,Danman42,2010-03-17T12:11Z,This a great torrent thanks a lot thegreatDevo. Brilliant album too.
,sterfry48,2010-04-07T07:15Z,"@the_toasted:
I love shitcunts! Is that what your dad calls you before he tucks you in and helps you rub your 2 centimeter dick? And now you bestow this name with such prestige unto me?! I am flattered! Thank you so much. And as for me getting a virus from this, I was apparently wrong, and it was probably another torrent."
,thegreatdevo,2010-04-08T03:57Z,"@ sterfry48 thanks for realizing that. you can trust all my torrents, i hate getting viruses from stupid people so i don't put them in mine. no hard feelings."
