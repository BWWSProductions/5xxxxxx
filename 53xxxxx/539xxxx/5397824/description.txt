                         - RELEASE NOTES -                         
                                                                         

     Sylfid-f2 is a VSTi audio plugin that generates sounds by hitting
     "virtual strings" with "virtual hammers", computing the propagation of
     the waves on the strings, and converting them to sounds.

     It is based on the same technology as Sylfid-f1 but doesn't have all
     the complex tuning options of Sylfid-f1. It has one single type of
     hammer, and the parameters are global to all the keys.

     Sylfid-f2 doesn't use any samples: everything is computed in real
     time. This allows to create sounds that exhibit real-life properties
     like rich tones and long decays, without any samples, no loops and no
     reverb.
