The Deviants (formerly The Social Deviants) were an English rock group originally active in the late 1960s, but still used as a vehicle for the musical work of writer Mick Farren.

Farren has stated that The Deviants were originally a community band which "did things every now and then â€“ it was a total assault thing with a great deal of inter-relation and interdependence". Musically, Farren described their sound as "teeth-grinding, psychedelic rock" somewhere between the Stooges and The Mothers of Invention. The Deviants have been described as a transition between classic British psych and the Punk/Heavy Metal aesthetic of the 1970s. They were the first act to ever be introduced as a Punk rock band by the underground DJ Jeff Dexter at Tiles Club in Londonâ€™s Oxford Street, August 15 1967.
