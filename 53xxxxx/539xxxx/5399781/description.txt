Storyline: 
Ryan Bingham's job is to fire people from theirs. The anguish, hostility, and despair of his "clients" 
has left him falsely compassionate, living out of a suitcase, and loving every second of it. When his 
boss hires arrogant young Natalie, she develops a method of video conferencing that will allow termination
without ever leaving the office - essentially threatening the existence Ryan so cherishes. Determined to
show the naive girl the error of her logic, Ryan takes her on one of his cross country firing expeditions,
but as she starts to realize the disheartening realities of her profession, he begins to see the downfalls
to his way of life
