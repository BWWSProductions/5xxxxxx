I apologize for letting my other torrent die, but I recently swapped computers with someone, and had no way to transfer the file to this one. I would've just re-downloaded it but the 30 or so jackasses that downloaded my original file, decided not to seed so the torrent effectively died. God bless the leechers eh?




Anyway, here it is again. I'm sorry for the big file size but I'm not an expert in effective ripping. That's one of the things that stopped me from just re-ripping the file and putting it into the file directory of the first torrent: the file size wouldn't come out the same again. Since I've ripped it 3 - 4 times, including once with a different ripper, I'm just saying the hell with it and re-uploading a different torrent. 




Also, I'm only seeding this right now, and it's set on high (I use utorrent) so if you get lame download speed, bear with me, I can't do more then I am now aside from arriving at your door and handing you the DVD personally. 






Enjoy, and please seed.
