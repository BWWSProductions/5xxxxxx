Depeche Mode have done it again! Not only did they play a historic show today, but they may have topped themselves when it comes to their legendary performances. Not only did they play the Royal Albert Hall for the first time, but they made it such a unique performance that it might even rival their most talked about and revered live moments. And the appearance of Alan Wilder has made the show their most talked about in years, with press from all around the globe covering it.

The London Evening Standard, say Depeche Mode set the bar high for the following Teenage Cancer Trust shows: â€œThey couldnâ€™t have set the bar higher if they had personally placed it on the Albert Memorial.â€

LA Weekly wrote: â€œWhen we saw this video of Alan Wilder playing piano as Martin Gore sang â€œSomebodyâ€ on Facebook this morning, we thought it was some Depeche Mode fan inside-joke. After all, Wilder left the band about fifteen years ago and any speculation that he may someday return to the fold, even for one night, seemed to be little more than wishful thinking. But, itâ€™s true, at last nightâ€™s Depeche Mode show at Londonâ€™s Royal Albert Hall, Wilder appeared to play the make-out classicâ€. 

Writes Consequence Of Sound: â€œWilder joined Depeche Mode for a performance of â€œSomebodyâ€ during the bandâ€™s set at the Teenage Cancer Trust charity concert last night. Explaining the basis for the reunion in a newly posted blog entry on his website, Wilder wrote, â€œDave contacted me a few weeks back and asked if Iâ€™d be willing to join them on-stage. He assured me that everyone in the band was into the idea. I was very happy to accept, especially as it was all in a good cause and we were long overdue some kind of reunion of this sort. It was great to see everyone again and catch up a bit, and it was also the first time I have actually â€™seenâ€™ Depeche Mode perform!â€
