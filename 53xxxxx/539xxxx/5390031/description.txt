This riveting tale of murder and suspense stars Faye Dunaway as Laura Mars, New York's most controversial fashion photographer. World renowned for her sensational, erotic portraits of models in settings of glorified urban violence, Laura Mars exhibits a mystifying psychic ability. In her mind's eye, as if through the lens of her camera, she 'witnesses' a series of bizarre murders with terrifying clarity. All of the victims are people Laura has known. Police detective John Neville (Tommy Lee Jones) discovers a striking similarity between Laura's works and classified police photographs of the murders and he attempts to unravel the events which have taken control of Laura's mind. The film builds to a spine-chilling climax when the eyes of Laura Mars reveal the identity of the killer.
