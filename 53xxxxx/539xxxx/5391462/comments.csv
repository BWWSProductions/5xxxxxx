,X45JKD,2010-02-26T17:36Z,Thanks for the upload - but where is the seeder? Everyone has ZERO %. Waiting...
,Cadinot,2010-02-27T08:45Z,"Thanks for your first torrent. This is a film I wanted to see.

You need to download the torrent from here in order to seed. The file must be in the folder where your downloads go initially. 

If you have any questions --> evanses at gmail"
,Cadinot,2010-03-02T12:05Z,"Excellent rip. A/V: 10
perfect English subtitles.

Bleak fucking movie. Lots of twists and turns. Nonlinear. (a few holes at the end) Recommended."
,X45JKD,2010-03-02T21:52Z,"I downloaded this three times: twice via the torrent and again directly from the uploader's website (found in the description above). When played, the avi file just gives you a few seconds of a black screen with the following words displayed on the title bar: 
""3ajami__arab-films.net""

This is clearly a fake and a blatant ad. Total waste of time and bandwidth.

@Cadinot: you're talking to an advanced user. I usually only stick to 1080p x264s, not low res avi crap. You don't need to dole out irrelevant ""advice"" like the one above. The torrent had ZERO seeders for several days. ""Put it in the folder where the downloads go initially..."" Please. In fact, it's quite suspicious that you give this movie A/V:10. Are you part of this ""arab-films.net""?"
,ferociousk,2010-03-03T08:53Z,Fake.
,Cadinot,2010-03-03T15:13Z,"The personal attacks, I will ignore.

I am a moderator on a private tracker and I cannot agree with X45JKD that cashcity12 is ""an advanced user.""  Anyone who puts ""First upload, Enjoy."" in his description and then doesn't seed suggests to me that he may not be all that advanced. And, by the way, my irrelevant advice was exactly what CashCity needed to get this torrent moving. He also was polite enough to send me a 'thank you' email. 

Kudos to CashCity12 on your first successful upload. 

And I stand by my 3/2/10 comment. This is real, not fake. "
,X45JKD,2010-03-03T16:09Z,"@Cadinot: problems with reading comprehension? The ""advanced user"" was a description referring to myself, not ""cashcity12."" By the way, you should read your own masterpiece of a comment - seems your problems extend to writing coherently as well.

@cashcity12: kudos to you for uploading a fake file and wasting everyone's bandwidth and time.

Everyone else: I've already reported this torrent to the administrators at piratebay. Download at your own risk. And if you found it to be fake as well, then comment on it so others won't waste their efforts too.

@ferociousuk: Thanks for confirming that this file is indeed a fake."

,norbo121,2010-03-09T00:31Z,Fake a rama!
,ravi84m,2010-03-09T11:45Z,"Thanks, great movie and excellent quality"
,morph456,2010-03-09T13:05Z,"I just downloaded this and it is NOT FAKE.
It's 02:00:30 long and has hardcoded english subs.
The quality can be better but it's the best available for this movie at the moment."
,morph456,2010-03-09T13:08Z,"@X45JKD
I'm not sure whether you have some agenda for saying this is a fake or you really have technical difficulties opening the file.
It's definitely no fake."
,bigpops,2010-03-10T23:08Z,"not a fake. a/v 9/7,good up load thanks"
,X45JKD,2010-03-11T07:14Z,"@morph456: what agenda could I possibly have when I've posted english subs (albeit, poor quality) here on a real torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5133060/Ajami_%282009%29 ?

It is possible that the torrent is being corrupted, but that seems unlikely as I've downloaded directly from the uploader's website, http://www.foriegnmoviesddl.com/2010/01/ajami-russoun-2009-scandar-copti-yaron.html and still had the same result.

READ CAREFULLY: there is no problem opening the file, it is simply a blank screen with the words ""3ajami__arab-films.net"" on the title bar. 

Man, I don't even know why I'm wasting my time bothering to write in this thread anymore. If people want to waste their bandwidth downloading fake files then knock yourselves out. As for me, I'm simply waiting for a better version of the srt file that fits the real movie here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5133060/Ajami_%282009%29 to be released."
,X45JKD,2010-03-18T04:53Z,"The real deal with excellent subtitles:

The link to the subtitles can be found in my comments in the page above."
,windycitybluez,2010-09-05T14:37Z,I found a great copy on stagevu it's in spanish but you can add the english subs if you like
,Zenophobe,2010-12-04T02:17Z,someone on RT said this was better than Pulp Fiction... if it amounts to .25 as good as Pulp Fiction I'll be impressed
,FPDdoBR,2010-12-08T01:33Z,"This ""X45JKD"" guy obviously has technical issues, fot the release is NOT FAKE.

But, interestingly, the release he pointed out as the best so far is not fake either, and really has better quality and subtitles available!

I recommend you guus download the other one.
