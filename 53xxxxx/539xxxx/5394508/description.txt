Visual Watermark is a professional tool for digital pictures protection. It places visible watermarks on pictures that identify your authority and prevent illegal use of your images. The program places irreversible watermarks on the images for you, and these watermarks can't be removed using third-party software or using our software. This makes the protection strong. This tool doesn't embed any invisible watermarks. Visual Watermark has two modes: standard and wizard. They both provide the same set of functionality, but wizard mode is easier to start with and will help you become familiar with the program. We recommend you to start using Visual Watermark in wizard mode.
