IMDB: Saara is a middle-aged doctor who one day finds out that her architect-husband Leo is having an affair with a younger woman, Tuuli. Instead of revealing her true identity, Saara pretends to be someone else and makes friends with Tuuli. At the same time she is planning the best way to revenge her husband and his lover.

Thank you Kayleen for the great upload! Don't worry too much about the English grammer, it confuses a lot of us, i've heard that Finnish is much worse! =)"

No mutta kiitos tästä! :)"
