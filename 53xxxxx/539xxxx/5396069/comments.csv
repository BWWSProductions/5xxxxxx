now i can run my os just fine
i knew with the update only been 3 days ago that it would only take a day or 2 for the hackers of the net to assemble a crack for it"
,johnn2727,2010-02-27T11:13Z,"this is sweet! it got rid of those annoying pop ups....one question though,dose this mean that my os is reactivated now? cause after i downloaded the microsoft update witch said i had to activate windows i couldnt use any activators or loaders to reactivate..anyone with this problem?"
[T],Askeen.,2010-02-27T11:49Z,"johnn2727

of this you dont got activated windows with update, this remove the WAT so the time of trial dont expires. 

did you try Windows 7 loader 1.7.7 by daz before you did this?"
,alfrednelms,2010-02-27T13:47Z,"I use this before I use the 7loader (by Daz). This does not work, maybe because of ""19 days left to activate"". Daz's 7loader finally activates it."
,skCory,2010-02-28T12:29Z,"Ask3n, thank you so freakin much!!! i come home to see my computer all ""UNGENUINE!!!"" and freak the hell out. download like 12 different programs, nothing was working for me, and then i found you... i love you! this worked flawlessly! i dont really know what this means, will this somehow come to bite me in the ass a few days down the road? or am i in the clear to use this OS for a good while? eitherway, i'm very happy! thanks!!!! =D"
,killr,2010-02-28T15:56Z,Good job this worked sweet for me.
,lshcub,2010-02-28T17:31Z,awesome!! worked perfectly the first time.
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-02-28T19:12Z,"I can let Windows Update install KB971033. After this, I can use ""RemoveWAT"" to deactivate/remove it?"
,chuchunesme,2010-03-02T01:37Z,"Worked perfect! The nagging messages started popping up on my wife's computer this morning and it kept turning the desktop to a black screen, it was even shutting down Firefox after like 10 min or so. I ran this and no more issues! Thanks!!"
,HIVcIFE,2010-03-02T11:28Z,So if i just installed windows 7 should i activete the HAZAR loader and then use this or just use this?? Please repley someone id apriciate it!
,thantos123,2010-03-02T16:44Z,"Well folks, looks like it's the end of the line. Time to pry open those wallets, I'm afraid.

Since installing this software, I've just experienced a bi-hourly shutdown. This is my third in total since this morning. 

Despite claiming to do so in the documentation, I can confirm that this program does NOT disable the two-hour ""timebomb"" on evaluation copies. All it does is remove all the warning messages, etc. It's a completely cosmetic fix.

Looks like I'll be rolling back to XP."
,thantos123,2010-03-02T18:27Z,"Right folks, after a little digging, I believe I've discovered a solution to the bi-hourly shutdowns on evaluation versions of W7.

Google the following:

""Stop Windows 7 RC from expiring""

The first link should be a Coolbuster article with that title.

Follow the instructions in the article.

I've just applied the fix - I'll post an update here in an hour and a half or so (7pm GMT) to let everyone know if it's worked.

*crosses fingers*"
,thantos123,2010-03-02T20:18Z,"Sorry to say it guys, but the Coolbuster fix didn't work for me. Some people seem to be having some success with it, so try it out - it might work for you.

Right now I've just set back my computer's clock as a stop-gap solution."
,lobo345,2010-03-02T20:19Z,"I'm experiencing same as thantos (warning messages are disabled but bi-hourly shutdowns not)

Which solution # are you testing from that site?"
,rshbringer,2010-03-03T11:22Z,Same here. It doesnt work for me. It still shuts down. I have no solution for it yet.
,calman84,2010-03-04T15:51Z,thanks aks3n
,HIVcIFE,2010-03-05T19:29Z,So this downl. works or not?
,Noobhammer,2010-03-07T12:44Z,"It activates windows by removing the WAT stuff, that is what it does. If you have the RC version it will activate it, but after march 1st Windows will automatically reboot every 2 hours. It activates it, but the shutdown/reboot thing is a whole other problem.

You have to see the difference between activating Windows and the RC expiring."
,Natsuu,2010-03-10T06:11Z,Worked just fine for me. Thanks a bunch
,CreamFeeder,2010-03-10T13:17Z,"kaloo kalay!!  extacy ridden throes of orgasmic delight!!!!!    I was just about to reinstall win7 again, when I found this while desperately cruisin here for a solution on my lappy, I dpownloaded it on my ""non genuine"" ridden puta and lo and behold, NO MORE FUCKING WINDOWS GENUINE ADVANTAGE SHIT!!!! I fucking lvoe you, man, if I could I'd have your friggin babies!!"
,marflo,2010-05-09T18:13Z,"hey guys,
I used with now issue a bie86 of win 7 from oct 2009 till last week when I installed microsoft security essential on my pc, after two days i got the notice that the win 7 is not genuine and in system screen I got 30 days to activate.
today I used removewat22 and I got rid by the notifications and in system screen  there is no request for activation, no words written actually, is blank that section where it was suposed to be the activation notifying.
I wish to ask is it ok or I have to use this software? I mean removewat225"
,maneff,2010-05-10T16:31Z,"Haha this torrent is deleted\banned in the most trackers worldwide :>

Nice to have it"
,azervayne,2010-10-04T11:39Z,"ATTN!

This update will work for a while, but after update KB2158563, as MPAA pointed out, Windows caught on and broke this method. Here's how to get your copy genuine again:

Download this torrent and reinstall WAT (The exe within has that option, thankfully. Credit to author for allowing us the option to restore WAT. Restoring WAT *IS* necessary because the alternate way to activate windows tricks WAT rather than removing it.) or rerun it if you didn't delete the files from this torrent

Restore WAT (as i said above, just remind ya...)

Program will reboot your computer

Download this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5541849/Windows_7_Loader_v1.7.9_%5B_Windows_7_Activation_For_all_versions_ *

*If for some reason the above link broke, Google for the following to find it: ""Windows 7 Loader v1.7.9 thepiratebay""'

Run the exe within that torrent

The program will minimize to background immediately then a few seconds later ask you to restart your computer (this is normal, btw)

Upon boot windows will stay say it is not genuine with the pop up prompt, but you will notice that the ""This copy of Windows is not genuine"" in the corner is gone - this is your (and was my) first hint that this worked for you

Go to the Windows 7 start menu search bar and type in activate windows and you should see the program for Windows activation come up (it's named ""Activate Windows"" hehe) then click it.

It should say ""Activation was succesful""

Reboot your computer

Enjoy your ""discount"" copy of 7"
