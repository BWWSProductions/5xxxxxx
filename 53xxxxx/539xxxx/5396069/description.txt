NOT FOR VISTA/ORIGINAL SERVER 2008!!!!

IMPROVEMENTS SINCE 1.0:

This is a little tool I put together to remove WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) completely from the OS, whilst still retaining
genuine status and receiving all updates (optional aswell). You can also pass the genuine check in things like Windows Defender.
There will be no windows activation section in control panel (thanks to nononsence)
no slmgr
no nags, no prompts, nothing. WAT gone.
