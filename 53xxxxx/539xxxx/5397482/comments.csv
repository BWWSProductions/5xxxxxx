,pbfriend,2010-02-28T14:02Z,can't u guys rip gta4 and aliens vs predator. this is the 3rd time i'm requestng. plez accept this one.
,OmniNegro,2010-02-28T20:14Z,"pbfriend, what is wrong with you? Those are already available. Besides, this is not a place for requests. Perhaps if you ask another three times some nice officer will knock at your door to give you some nice chrome bracelets.

I swear you must be retarded or playing some joke. I clearly did not get the joke.

Oh well. Have a nice day."
,BungleFever,2010-03-01T06:22Z,"Great torrent, good speed according to the seeders, works flawlessly except for the extracter. Thanks for the torrent!


to meluckee:
First time I extracted the rars in the borderlands folder and used the extractor, nothing extracted even though it said it was done.

I extracted to a new folder and moved the files manually inside each designated folder, kind of long but its worth it and works great online.

Maybe I should have tried it a second time right in the folder but wtv it works now using reloaded's and its a Gb less than the other torrents. "
,prisondad,2010-03-02T07:23Z,"is thereno way to get this dlc for free without patching to 1.3? i dont play online but i like to mod weapons for shits and giggles and i hear 1.3 limits that because of the whole modding fair or unfair cheating, we all have a cry debate."
,gimp6667,2010-03-04T05:34Z,"ya hey can any one help me, im kinda a noob i guess idk, any way

,LilLizardReaper99,2010-03-07T02:34Z,"does the borderlands hav to be cracked, or does it work with the bought game version?"

,fleetkid,2010-03-09T09:15Z,Works perfectly :) Thanks 
,WarlockTM,2010-03-13T08:06Z,"Umm help please, i am a noob, and this is the first time i have done this, i have no idea where to extract these files, and how to use the ""unpack"" can someone please help?"
,Ezlin,2010-03-25T19:50Z,Verified.
,Ezlin,2010-03-30T04:06Z,P.S KaOs forgot to mention this but the videos have been downgraded @ 50%. It still looks fine and everything just might as well let people know.
,Ezlin,2010-04-01T21:32Z,"@13dk...
It should, you might as well try. It's only 1 gig. If it doesn't work let me know."
,Ezlin,2010-04-09T21:30Z,"@13dk13
It makes sense it works, seeing as how the Razor rip is just a different cracked executable than the Reloaded release. As for the freezes, I don't think it is caused by the KaOs or Reloaded releases of the games. I did have this DLC freeze on me twice and it also crashed on me twice but I believe it is a problem that Gearbox has to fix. I haven't had any problems with Moxxi DLC though. I would suggest posting something about this on some forums for Borderlands, although don't say a THING about it being pirated."
,daneroverg,2010-04-13T06:25Z,"Can anyone confirm if the videos have been indeed downgraded to 50%?

If so, i should be probably better off downloading this, right?:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5222289/Borderlands_The_Zombie_Island_of_Dr_Ned_DLC_REPACK-KaOs

It has a smaller size and its videos have been downgraded. But, I want to have better quality. So, which one shud i DL?"
,daneroverg,2010-04-13T06:27Z,Oh stupid me! It's Zombie Island. My mistake. Sorry 
,Ezlin,2010-04-14T22:56Z,"@daneroverg
Yep, videos downgraded @50%. It still looks fine. All KaOs Borderlands torrents have downgraded videos."
