,spikey7,2010-03-23T19:37Z,you have to copy GMAPSUPP onto a sd card and insert into garmin then you have to go to map info on your garmin and tick your new map.
,spikey7,2010-03-23T20:11Z,forgot to mention you have to create a new file on your sd card and name it garmin then copy over the GMAPSUPP FILE.

,pharmocy82,2011-07-08T02:09Z,many thanks for an awesome torrent. create a new folder called garmin on sd card and place the IMG file inside it OR in the Garmin itself you will also find a folder called garmin - place this IMG file here. Go to Tools>Settings>Map. Go to Map ingo tab at bottom of map and press --> Garmin City Navigator NT 2010.31 should appear - this proves you was successful
