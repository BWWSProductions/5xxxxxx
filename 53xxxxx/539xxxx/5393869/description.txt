My newest house mix contains some of my favourite tracks of this year.  I was fooling around with the intro and used a new release from a DJ named Maetrik.  It is un-fucking-real!  I've been playing it the last couple weeks and I can't get it out of my head.  There are a couple good remixes of it out there so look to hear it again in one of my future mixes.  I'll also give mention to the Claude Von Stroke track "Vocal Chords".....amazing track and a bit different then everything that's going around these days.  I love it. 

Well that's that!  Hope you enjoy my newest mix and stay tuned for more.  I'm already working on House Mix IX and expecting it to be completed by mid to end of March.  See you then!  Go Canada Go!
