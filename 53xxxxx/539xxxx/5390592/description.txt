Surrender - No Surrender

4 song EP from the band fronted by Alfie Zappacosta. After this mini album he went on to a successful solo career. His first solo album contained re-recordings of "It's All Been Done Before" and "Start Again", which has become his signature song.


By the way - if anybody has any of Zappacosta's solo recordings, we would be very thankful if you would upload them for us.
