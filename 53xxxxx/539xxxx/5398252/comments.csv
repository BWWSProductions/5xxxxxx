,odan47,2010-02-28T00:17Z,Seems so small - does it need a crack?
,WestlakeJager,2010-02-28T00:44Z,No crack needed. Drag and drop.
,efxr,2010-02-28T01:12Z,"Thanks so much. 

I've had my eyes on this app for some time now."
,dbreul,2010-02-28T01:33Z,You can't even print a check with it!
,odan47,2010-02-28T01:33Z,"Seems to work well, thank you!"
,WestlakeJager,2010-02-28T03:33Z,"Yes dbreul - there is not much you can do with this app, compared to previous versions. I requested a refund for it and am going back to Quicken 2007. However, it may be of some use to some people."
,gatesbuster,2010-02-28T13:47Z,"After install, when I double click on it nothing happens; the program does not start. It does not work for me. Anyone with the same issue ? It must be a fake or the file is corrupted"
,danz444,2010-02-28T15:18Z,"Works for me, this new version lacks many features of Quicken 2007,thanks WestlakeJager for the app,may be Quicken essentials will have an update to add at least password protection."
,ChiefCook,2010-02-28T16:56Z,"This app works fine for me. I don't know why Quicken stripped this app of much of it's high power functions, but it does everything I need it to do. I do like the the new interface. I converted all my Q 2007 files successfully. I intend to use this permanently. Thank you for the upload."
,gemkeeper,2010-02-28T17:18Z,Thanks!
[T],g-roid,2010-03-02T00:24Z,"Thanks, works fine. Very different, but most of Quicken's upgrades are worth learning. I've been using this program for almost 20 years now and it's very handy."
,Dragonforce79,2010-03-02T01:25Z,"Hmm, same problem here. After dragging it to my applications directory and double clicking it, it jumps one time in the dock and then disappears. No crash message, just vanishes. I was able to find a line in the console:

Unable to load nib file: main menu

No clue whats wrong. Running 10.6.2 in 64bit kernel mode"
,kenwood17,2010-03-08T23:10Z,"same problem, the program does not start. Any solution?"
,creativeye,2010-03-28T00:25Z,"For the users who have no English language by defaut.
Change the order into preferences system: languages.
Re-start the computer.
Launch Quicken Essentials 2010. Made the update.
Restore the order of the languages into preferences system.
Re-start the computer."
,Sir_RUSH,2011-02-02T08:10Z,"Thanks a lot for sharing.  It is working well.  I was even able to get the Quicken for Windows to work for Mac. Even less reasons to use Windows...otherwise since the Amiga PC we called Windows the ""Dark Side"".  Appreciated!  I will probably buy this version."
,dylemma11,2011-04-26T14:28Z,someone please seed this morning
,madyastha,2012-01-04T14:32Z,is it ok if i update this?
,ninth1der,2012-04-12T00:43Z,"When opening I get ""Unable to create new file"" error.
When trying to Import converted files from 2005, the app crashes and tries to relaunch in a terminal loop.  Keeps popping up on the dock then exit, and continues until I reset.  I have removed, looked for App Support files in Library to delete.  Then reinstalled.  Problem continues.

Running H@ck!nto$h with C2Q 9400 on a Gigabyte mobo.  Running iAtkos 10.7.1 L2 with Apple update to 10.7.2. Vanilla Kernal and nothing special.  Everything else runs fine, even QBooks 2011.

Just purchased retail download and am starting a new torrent.  I will probably jump over to Moneydance, since the free version of Moneydance supports up to 100 manual transactions.  If your bank supports import options you can probably survive on Moneydance free edition if QEss is good enough (considering the new version is stripped of function)."
