PS - What app do you use to make an ISO? Without burning it to disk first...."
,spal2ky,2010-05-31T01:15Z,"Aparrently it's the Windows installer that gives probs... 

""Windows Installer 5.0 is available for Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2""

But the 5.0 installer is not available for separate download yet... :-("

Can someone please seed this ISO as the other FastAccess that sh.aviate uploaded does not work on my Vista 64bit, says this version is not compatible half way through the install and quits."

""This version cannot install on this computer. Code = -3""

Any suggestions?
