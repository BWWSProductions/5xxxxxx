Haley Joel Osment (Secondhand Lions, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, The Sixth Sense) and Willem DaFoe (The Aviator, Spider-Man 1 & 2) star in "Edges Of The Lord", an inspirational and enthralling story that's seen through the eyes of a child.  To escape an unthinkable fate, a Jewish boy's (Osment) parents send him to the countryside.  And that's when his adventure begins.  Spirited away from the Nazi occupied city in a gunnysack, he's taken in by a kind village farmer with children of his own, masquerades as the farmer's nephew and is coached by the parish priest (DaFoe).  Filled with outstanding performances and brilliantly written, this triumphant film is sure to capture your heart.
