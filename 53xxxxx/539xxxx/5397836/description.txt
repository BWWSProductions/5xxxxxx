     After more than seven years of supporting the scene with       
     quality releases, ACME is proud to break the barrier of        
     6000 releases, more than 4000 of them being keymakers.         
                                                                    
                                                                    
      As you may have noticed we always try our best to keep a high   
      level of quality. Therefore we do not take part in mass         
      releasing like midnight-mu-races or converter/ripper-shareware, 
      which gets released from different vendors with same look,      
      funtionality, version number and of course same serial over and 
      over. We tend to care for quality before quantity.              
                                                                      
     Finally we would like to thank our hardworking members, friends 
      and all people, who are affiliated to us.

    ACME can not be held responsible for any unlawful actions based on 
     or in conjunction with any of its releases. The enduser has to   
      decide whether to download, install, and use a release or not.   
      Software engineers have to spend a lot of time developing their 
    programs to improve their products in order to get new custo-  
    mers and to make a living. If you acquire one of our releases not  
    just for testing purposes but for everyday usage, we strongly  
      advise you to buy the software to support the authors!
