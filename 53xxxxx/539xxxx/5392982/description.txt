
Pavement is an American indie/alternative rock band. Although they experienced only moderate commercial success, they achieved a significant cult following[1] and were one of the most popular and influential lo-fi rock bands of the 1990s.[1][2] In their initial ten-year career, they released five full length records, and a slew of EPs. The group remained signed to an independent label throughout their entire career. The group disbanded in 1999, but after a nine year hiatus a reunion was announced in late 2009. [3] They are set to play their first show in ten years in March.
