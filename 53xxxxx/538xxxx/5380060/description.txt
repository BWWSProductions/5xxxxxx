          PLOT                                                    
           In  1959  Brighton,   disgraced  cop  turned  private  
           detective  Tony Aaron  works  largely  on  falsifying  
           adulteries for use  as evidence  in divorce cases. He  
           involves  his wife as the fictional co-respondent for  
           painter  Carlo Stasio  but  the pair are shot dead in  
           the  hotel  room.  In charge  of the  case  is Frank,  
           Tony's  ex-partner still  on the Brighton force.  His  
           most likely suspects  are Angeline, Stasio's mistress  
           who  is set  to inherit  his house and pictures,  and  
           Tony  himself,  parts  of  whose  story don't seem to  
           add up.
