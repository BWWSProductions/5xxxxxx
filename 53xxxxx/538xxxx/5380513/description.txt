Includes:

ALL CARDS CRACK, installed with setup
NEW CARDS UPDATED 2010, installed with setup
ACCESS TO MULTIPLAYER SERVERS VIA HAMACHI2 Technologies, included with setup

Run the setup, and you're good!

TESTED WITH WINDOWS XP! WORKED 100%

Issue with the reg files, if you run into a problem not being able to import/export your deck, navigate to the folder where the program file for the yuigoh game itself is located (yuigoh_pc.exe is the file) and run the reg file there. It fixes the issue.

Also with Windows 7/Vista Users the reg files need to be modded for those OS's so if someone wants to whip those up, much appreciated. The hamachi servers address directs to the main blog for support, questions, tourneys and more!
