[T],n2kmaster,2010-02-22T23:44Z,"Also theres been an issue brought up about it having issues importing and export, k to fix this make sure you follow the instructions i gave, after you install, navigate to the main folder with the yugioh_pc.exe file and run the reg file in there. Vista and Windows 7 users will have to mod their reg files for regedit to work. There are 1114 cards in this pack i should add."
