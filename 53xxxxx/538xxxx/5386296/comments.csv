I think you're the moron here. Obama is not black. He's white. He has a white mother, a white grandmother that he grew up with, he went to white schools and is president in in a predominantly white country. How the hell do you become ""black"", if your mom is white? Does having one black parent count more than having a white one? Are you a racist?

And Beck is actually both funny and interesting. Stop watching the politically correct and corrupt media like CNN and their ilk. They've been lying to us since the first hour of broadcast. He's fresh, new and tells things from a different perspective."
