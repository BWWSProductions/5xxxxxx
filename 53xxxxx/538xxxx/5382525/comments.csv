Thanks To twentyforty for another up!!!

A-7
V-6 

Watchable If A MUST SEE (Which It Is LOL)

But If Not A Necessity To Watch Right Away, Wait For TS or R5 ... My Opinion

Thanks Again Homey!!"

,lilars26,2010-02-22T01:30Z,"8.5 IMDB
Scorsese,DiCaprio and 20-40
Sounds like a winning combination.

Thanks 20/40"

,Demise69,2010-02-22T05:17Z,"Bdw Hats off to you bro ....

em about to download it ..  bin waiting for this one 

much appreciated ... 

And yeh .. em wondering .. how come DEAR JOHN isnt out here yet? "
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-22T05:46Z,"@william999: Nope. As many times before, you get things wrong:

YOU BROKE RULE No2: ""Do not post stupidities.""

Second, this re-encode IS MANY TIMES BETTER than other cam of Shutter Island.

Third: I never lie. READ WHY Sh.I. was upped:

"" twentyforty at 2010-02-21 17:11 CET: 

@drunkchef: I have it, but with Cam man cannot be sure. It's small file (700MB), maybe too small for decent quality. I will look into and try to do ""something""... and IF watch-ability can be achieved, I would re-encode Sh.I and up after ToothF.
If it's bad, better is to wait day or two for some decent German or Russian CAM or Telesync. ""

YOU HAD THE SAMPLE.
Are you blind? Have anyone forced you to download anything?
Nope. Stop blaming others, look at yourself  - you are silly and pathetic.

Changing your screen-name can't help."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-22T05:51Z,"@Demise69: It was but went under the carpet. It was bad, unwatchable cam someone released few days back, maybe a week..."
,william999,2010-02-22T06:23Z,Whos rules are they @twentyforty . heres another of your rules broken twice -- Go fuck yourself you condescending cunt!!!!!!!!!!!
,jjabrams,2010-02-22T06:40Z,oh - someones feelings got hurt on the internet - *hands tissue*
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-22T07:12Z,"LOL william, how does it feel?
Get your meds as GP prescribed.

BTW, my torrents = my rules."
,rnsxypapa,2010-02-22T07:20Z,please have it in avi format...   thanks  low slap five to ya...
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-22T09:14Z,"REQUESTS ARE ""ON HOLD"" TILL FURTHER NOTICE."
,drunkchef,2010-02-22T14:08Z,many thanks 2040 been waiting ages to see this ! 
,a.brignall,2010-02-22T14:34Z,Many thanx 2040 its spot on keep up the good work
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-22T17:01Z,"@rnsxypapa: It's suicidal, as far as I know only one media player accepts H264 video and AAC audio in old and obsolete AVI container.
It is also non-standard and in the future I would never do such thing."
,lilars26,2010-02-23T18:57Z,"Yes,this is a cam,but a very
watchable one.Scorsese has
another hit on his hands"
,hwb3517,2010-03-09T04:01Z,im a newby 2 all this but i just think it only fair if you have it and are watching it why not seed at the same time? also 2040 i always look for ur stuff luv small size hiqulity i dont understand the setings im at default 0 0 is that ok
,hwb3517,2010-03-14T00:01Z,for a camera copy pretty good quality video and audio the only thing in audio is the audiance noise and i don't think you can do much 4 that
