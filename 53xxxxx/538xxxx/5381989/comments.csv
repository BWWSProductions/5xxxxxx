Think of the rest of us - remove the dutch subs!"

Hardcoded dutch sub.

This is _not_ high quality!"
,adm69,2010-02-23T12:41Z,You do have a choice! Download or don't. If people uploading want to add subtitles it's their call! Who the hell are you to demand this and that?

,creni,2010-02-25T10:03Z,how hard could it be to make subs optional? Pirate bay is supposed to be international. 
,misterb,2010-02-28T12:56Z,"As mentioned by others, this is *NOT* high quality. It's shite. The screenshots someone linked in here are *not* from this torrent."
