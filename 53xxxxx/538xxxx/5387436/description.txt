Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
Were a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We dont earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then dont hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.



twice the fun   / double the trouble


On with the game release information:

Do you speak Extraterrestrial? You dont? Thats too bad -
Simon doesnt either! Of all people, our cheeky, favorite
sorcerer has to save the Magic Kingdom from an invasion from
outer space in this point-and-click adventure. During his
adventure, he meets a number of vain and dubious characters
which he turns into helpers of the third kind: goofy mole
agents, giant octopuses, and a transvestite pirate - Simon is
spared nothing! For his fifth adventure, TGC gives Simon not
only a modern 3D comic look, but also different solutions to
the many challenges he faces on his odyssey. In its course,
our sorcerers apprentice can not only act in his usual mean
and vicious way, but also present a whole new side of himself:
friendliness!
