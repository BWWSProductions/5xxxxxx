,ikoberry,2010-02-24T17:18Z,"Enjoy all, I ripped this from a DVD but you can see that it was just thrown together probably from an old print.. 
Still it's a fun film :)"
,themdg,2010-04-18T07:49Z,"Thanks for this movie.  Been looking everywhere for it.  No one local has it to rent to buy.  

And thanks for including the MPAA rating.  First time I've seen someone include it.  "

,ikoberry,2012-04-17T19:04Z,"@departure, lol thanks for that, I took that straight from the dvd box, shows how much thought the studio put into it! still fun though and I love all the actors even if it was just a paycheck for them :-) sometimes a really ""bad"" film is a whole lot of fun!"
