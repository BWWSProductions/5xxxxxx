A film adaptation of the mother of all stories produced by Francis Ford Coppola

with Armand Assante, Greta Sacchi, Isabella Rosselini, Vanessa Williams

approx 2h 58min, hence the hefty size. 

Please tolerate the glitches at the very beginning, these originate from the DVD this has been ripped from. The rest is decent SD quality.
