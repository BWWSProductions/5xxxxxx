PLOT: Itâ€™s all in a dayâ€™s work for high-flying literary agent Alexander; manuscripts to read, deals to be done, celebrity clients to be taken out to lunch, but first there is an author to deal with whose latest book the agent thinks is, frankly, not up to scratch. However he hadnâ€™t counted on the authorâ€™s resourcefulnessâ€¦ This bitingly funny film takes you behind the scenes of the publishing world to witness the wheeling and dealing required to create the next best-seller.
