#

 eXPerience Presents...

#

 

#

 Windows XP Professional SP3 - February 2010

#

 ________________________________________________________________________

#

 

#

 To boot from this DVD, set your PC up so it will boot

#

 from the DVD drive in the PC's BIOS.

#

 ________________________________________________________________________

#

 

#

 When you boot from this DVD you will see 6 options.

#

 

#

 You have a choice of 3 different Windows installations:

#

 

#

 1. Full Windows XP (nothing is removed)

#

 2. TinyXP (large components removed, but usable for most)

#

 3. MicroXP (extremely small, only takes 221Mb of HDD space)

#

 

#

 All three versions are updated to February 2010.

#

 

#

 There are also three more boot options:

#

 

#

 4. Acronis True Image EES v9.7.8353 (Backup\Restore)

#

 5. Hiren's BootCD v10.1 (Includes Live Windows XP)

#

 6. SpinRite v6.1 (Hard Disk Testing and Repair)

#

 

#

 ________________________________________________________________________

#

 

#

 Tons of drivers included!

#

 

#

 After the first reboot, on all installations, you will see a pop up

#

 "Driver Selector" window, This has a 1 minute timer. If the minute

#

 counts down, you will get important driverpacks included.

#

 

#

 This selector has a lot of drivers and you can pick and choose any

#

 combination you want, but remember that you must be sat at the PC

#

 after the first reboot.

#

 

#

 All three choices include 22 different driverpacks, all are optional,

#

 but you will always get basic drivers included even if the timer is

#

 left to count down. That is, CPU, Chipset, LAN, Mass Storage, Sound,

#

 the main nVidia and ATI graphics drivers and Wireless LAN.

#

 

#

 Even if you choose to create a smaller CD sized ISO (which you can

#

 easily do by just double clicking a batch file in the ISO folder on

#

 this DVD) those still include drivers and the driver selector, but

#

 they are on a 700Mb CD so have to have less driver packs.

#

 

#

 ________________________________________________________________________

#

 

#

 Options 1 and 2

#

 ---------------

#

 

#

 - NOT unattended.

#

 - You do not require any product key

#

 - Allows you to do a "Repair" installation

#

 

#

 You can install Windows the way you want, choose your own username,

#

 regional and language options etc.

#

 

#

 

#

 Option 2

#

 --------

#

 

#

 Option 2 is TinyXP Rev10 (February 2010).

#

 

#

 This is usable for most people, but it does not include Chinese,

#

 Japanese or Korean languages. It also has a lot of other things

#

 removed that are classed as a waste of resources, or just bulky

#

 and useless. For example the upgrade option is removed, since

#

 only a clean install is advised, also the Tour is removed, MSN

#

 Explorer and many other items, but whilst keeping all of the

#

 functionality (services) in Windows. This means you get a smaller

#

 install and it uses less RAM, but you get almost the whole of

#

 Windows and will not miss anything taken out.

#

 

#

 To see whats removed from TinyXP, see the file here:

#

 

#

 XP02I386SVCPACKNLITELast Session.ini

#

 

#

 You should only install this Windows onto a freshly formatted

#

 partition or hard disk.

#

 

#

 

#

 Option 3

#

 --------

#

 

#

 Option 3 is not for the faint hearted, it is an extremely small edition

#

 of Windows with a lot of components removed. I actually use it myself

#

 though, as my main OS. It seems to do everything I need it to do.

#

 

#

 There are advantages to MicroXP:

#

 

#

 - Extremely fast installation

#

 - Fast to scan for viruses

#

 - Making a backup is fast

#

 - Defragmenting is fast

#

 

#

 Those are just some advantages - the OS is also less prone to viruses

#

 because there are so few files left to attack and it runs very fast.

#

 

#

 This boots up in probably a third of the time of normal Windows XP.

#

 

#

 This installation is unattended and set to US English, but you can

#

 change the country for your keyboard afterwards.

#

 

#

 You should only install this Windows onto a freshly formatted

#

 partition or hard disk.

#

#

 Other boot options

#

 ------------------

#

 

#

  - Acronis Backup + Restore

#

 

#

 Allows you to backup your existing partition(s) before installing

#

 Windows, or you can quickly restore a backup made previously with

#

 Acronis.

#

 

#

 

#

 - Hirens Boot CD v10.1

#

 

#

 This includes a bootable "Mini XP" that you can boot into in case

#

 you cannot boot into Windows anymore. From there you can access

#

 your disks again and use any of the dozens of tools included. This

#

 is a massive collection of more then 200 tools! Including Partition

#

 Tools, Disk Clone Tools, Antivirus Tools, Recovery Tools, Testing Tools,

#

 RAM (Memory) Testing Tools, Hard Disk Tools, System Information Tools,

#

 MBR (Master Boot Record) Tools, BIOS / CMOS Tools, MultiMedia Tools,

#

#

#

 EasyRecovery.

#

 

#

 

#

 - SpinRite v6.0

#

 

#

 SpinRite attempts to recover data from damaged portions of hard disks

#

 that might not be readable via the operating system. When it encounters

#

 a sector with errors that cannot be corrected by the disk drive's error

#

 correcting code, it tries to read the sector up to 2000 times, and

#

 tries to determine the most probable value of each bit by comparing

#

 the results. The data is then saved onto a new block of the same disk.

#

 

#

#

 

#

 ISO folder (CD)

#

 

#

 If you want to make a <700Mb CD of any of these Windows

#

 installations, you have 7 different options to choose from...

#

 

#

 You can make an ISO file (bootable CD image) by running one

#

 of the batch files included in the ISO folder on the DVD.

#

 

#

 You must have the DVD in your DVD drive OR the main DVD ISO

#

 file mounted in a virtual drive for this to work!

#

 

#

 The last option here gives you TinyXP and MicroXP with all

#

 the other boot options like Acronis, Hirens and SpinRite

#

 and it also includes a good selection of driver packs.

#

 

#

 See the ISO folder for more info.

#

 

#

 The 7 batch files are as follows...

#

 

#

 01a - Full XP + 4 Driverpacks [694Mb]

#

 01b - Full XP - No Added Drivers [672Mb]

#

 

#

 02a - TinyXP + 16 Driverpacks [699Mb]

#

 02b - TinyXP - No Added Drivers [346Mb]

#

 

#

 03a - MicroXP + 20 Driverpacks [695Mb]

#

 03b - MicroXP - No Added Drivers [109Mb]

#

 

#

 04 - TinyXP+MicroXP+Multi-Boot+6 Driverpacks [698Mb]

#

 

#

 

#

 Running one of those files produces the following ISO file:

#

 

#

 XP01a.Full.XP.With.Drivers.iso ................................. [694Mb]

#

 XP01b.Full.XP.Without.Drivers.iso .............................. [672Mb]

#

 

#

 XP02a.TinyXP.With.Drivers.iso .................................. [699Mb]

#

 XP02b.TinyXP.Without.Drivers.iso ............................... [346Mb]

#

 

#

 XP03a.MicroXP.With.Drivers.iso ................................. [695Mb]

#

 XP03b.MicroXP.Without.Drivers.iso .............................. [109Mb]

#

 

#

 XP04.TinyXP.MicroXP.Hirens.Acronis.SpinRite.With.Drivers.iso ... [698Mb]

#

 

#

#

 

#

 ----------------------------------------------------

#

 WHAT IF YOU ONLY HAVE A CD BURNER AND NO DVD BURNER?

#

 ----------------------------------------------------

#

 

#

 As stated above, you can just mount the main DVD ISO file in a

#

 virtual drive and then run one of the bat files to create a

#

 new ISO file.

#

 

#

 If you don't already have any software to mount this ISO file with,

#

 just open this ISO with WinRAR and drag out the "Daemon Tools" file

#

 from the "APPSSilent" folder. Install that Daemon Tools program.

#

 Then after installing Daemon Tools, reboot.

#

 

#

 Now with Daemon Tools, mount this ISO file of the DVD.

#

 

#

 Now open the virtual drive in My Computer and open the ISO folder.

#

 

#

 Simply click any .bat file to make a .iso of the CD you want.

#

 

#

 ________________________________________________________________________

#

 

#

 OEM folder (CD)

#

 

#

 If you want to install the drivers on this CD independently of

#

 installing Windows, this is now possible by running one file.

#

 

#

 In the OEM folder on the CD you will find a file called:

#

 

#

 DP_Install_Tool.cmd

#

 

#

 Run this DP_Install_Tool.cmd file and sit back whilst the process unpacks

#

 the drivers, then tries to find any drivers you might need installing,

#

 then installs the drivers, then removes the initial drivers that were

#

 extracted, because they are not needed afterwards.

#

 

#

 You can run this DP_Install_Tool.cmd file anytime, on any x86 Windows XP

#

 or Server 2003.

#

 

#

 Do not move the CMD file from the OEM folder. If the CMD file is not left

#

 where it is inside the OEM folder, it will not work.

#

 

#

 ________________________________________________________________________

#

 

#

 eXPerience folder (Desktop)

#

 

#

 Most of these folders contain quick solutions to things that otherwise

#

 would be buried away in the Windows GUI or require DOS style commands.

#

 E.g. "control userpasswords2" will open the screen to change your

#

 Windows XP login password.

#

 

#

 Check WGA Status - This lets you see if Windows passes the WGA check.

#

 Desksave - Allows you to save your icon setup on the Desktop.

#

 Driver Install Tool - Info about the driver installer (OEM folder).

#

 Hibernation - Turns Hibernation on/off with one double click.

#

 Registry Backup - Easily backup your registry in one double click.

#

 Services Configuration Files - Configure Windows to use less RAM.

#

 ShrinkXP Scripts - Removal of components whilst Windows is running.

#

 System Restore - Enable (or disable) System Restore.

#

 System Volume Information - unlock (or lock) this folder.

#

 User Password - Easily change your password for Windows.

#
