It was well made, and with damn clear instructions.
If i had a hat... i would most certainly tip it for you!
... since i don't... Please accept my humble thanks :)"

,netaddict,2010-03-28T17:57Z,"Hi eXPerience-beeing,

is this better than the TJ releases?

(e.g. March or April 2009 versions, the ones with all language support)

May the force be with you!"
,netaddict,2010-03-28T18:01Z,"Gosh, now I see....1800 MB (tiny?) vs. 247MB of TJ's Performance Edition.

Can't be faster....

But may have other amenities. I'll see.

Keep up the good work!"

From the ""ShrinkXP scripts"" the readme says it got about 212 batch files.
