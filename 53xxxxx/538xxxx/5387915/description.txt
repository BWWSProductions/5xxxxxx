Paul Merton in Europe 1of6 PDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Having travelled far afield to explore China and India, Paul Merton is ready to take things easy with a relaxing trip around Europe. "But things didn't turn out quite as expected," he says. Far from gorging on sumptuous food and wine, lying on ravishing beaches and enjoying breathtaking architecture, Paul will be exploring some of the lesser-known areas of the continent. "Prepare to see Europe like you've never seen it before," he promises.

Part1:
Beginning in Germany, Paul meets the leader of a political movement known as the Apple Front, before enjoying a 'chess boxing' match in a Berlin sports hall. Next, he meets a former truck driver who practises the dying art of giant bunny breeding, and samples the delights of naked bowling. The first leg of Paulâ€™s tour ends with a bizarre spa treatment in a hotel on the Austrian border.
