Debut album, originally released by Island, 1969. 
"Ireland's answer to the Incredible String Band, Dr. Strangely Strange engaged in the same type 
of psychedelic acoustic music with folksy arrangements. With traditional instruments like penny 
whistle, fiddle, harmonium, and mandolin, Dr. Strangely Strange was more solidly rooted in 
melody and structure than the group's flaky Scottish counterparts. Produced by British modern 
folk guru Joe Boyd (Fairport Convention, Incredible String Band), Kip of the Serenes is built 
around simple and repetitious melodies occasionally interrupted by stream-of-consciousness 
musical and lyrical diversions."
This simplistic approach would be abandoned with their 1970 follow-up, Heavy Petting, which saw 
their first partnership with electric guitarist Gary Moore.
