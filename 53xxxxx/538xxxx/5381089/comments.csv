,oifwolf,2010-05-10T02:59Z,it is still in the initial seed period the uploader has to turn on his computer so yelling at other people wont do anything. this sounds like it just activates it. if you want to download updates pick a different one. with the wat remover. untill someone comes out with a keygenerater. like they did with xp.

,mikadraca,2010-12-14T20:48Z,"It works great, one big thank you to the uploader! "
,mikadraca,2010-12-14T20:55Z,"@mondeo98

You either don't have Win7 or you just playing dumb, cuz two steps is all there is to install this. 1.)Run the application and 2.)One click on ""Install/Remove loader"". And your system do rest of the stuff for you. I guess even that's to hard for some people."
,seeda94,2010-12-23T15:39Z,"So oifwolf said that if you want updates you need to find another torrent is this true. Can you still receive updates and install them the normal way, is this the full activator as if it were real."
,laurabarel,2011-04-13T19:51Z,"i downloaded this and now my computer wont start....i get this message that saids:
error 15 file not found
