Though her earlier releases were simpler, guitar-based affairs, Pamela Valfer's first full-length Kitty Craft album Breaks and Beats From the Flower Patch spotlights her bewitching, homemade loop pop. Hypnotic flutes, guitars, and harmonies float over simple but catchy beats, creating a dreamy, nearly Eastern-influenced ambience on songs like "Locked Groove" and "Half Court Press," while "Par 5" and "Mama's Lamp" wear their '60s folk, soul, and pop influences proudly. While individual songs tend to blend together, Kitty Craft's sound is so distinctive that it makes the album almost like a vacation to a mellow, cheerful, sunny place -- the flower patch itself, perhaps? Unabashedly pretty, ethereal yet down-to-earth, Breaks and Beats From the Flower Patch is a completely charming album.
