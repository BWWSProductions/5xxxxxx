First be patient with this download.   I'll upload as much as I can as fast as I can.

Second Seed bitches!!11 :)  Seriously, Pac fans should always seed and never buy Pac tracks. 

Edit I mean never buy from people online selling Pac Tracks.  Support 2pac and cop every retail release like all real 2pac fans do.  I am sharing this because I love Pac and want others to hear his genius.

3rd Enjoy.


Presenting the long awaited OG bootleg reissue set, entitled 2Pac: Evolution. This set represents a history of tracks that have leaked from late 1996 up through today, all in exceptional sources and quality. The mission of this project is not to offer the "best" remasters (a subjective assessment based on one's own preferences and hinging upon the technology of the day), 2Pac: Evolution is designed to present to you every available leaked song without all of the generational re-encoding and editing that continues even today. Listen to each song knowing that itâ€™s from the source, and not a bootleg of a bootleg of a bootleg. 

In light of the recent posting of court documents showing how 2pac's music inventory was cataloged and stored at Death Row, we have re-constructed the four DAT tapes as possible. Interestingly most of that content came to us in that same order. In subsequent discs we have worked hard to create logical tracklistings, and kept related songs (both in terms of how and when we obtained them and in regard to playback quality) together either within tracklists or as individual discs. Organizationally the set makes a lot of sense, and again, the quality of even the worst sounding tape rips is night and day better than whatâ€™s available onimeem, or most forums. It is noteworthy that we have made effort not to overlap this project onto past projects too much, so for a fully complete set the end user will have to purchase or already own the Thug Life Demo, Paper N Pen, Free 2Pac and Sessions releases. This project ships in a very professional 12-disc capacity hard plastic shelled case, full color covers, and thermal pressed discs (these are not CD-Rs with Sharpie writing on them).

We have worked very hard to ensure this set is as complete as possible, and new-coming and long-time collectors alike can buy the set and know that they have the original material before it was degraded, shortened, or otherwise altered. There are many treats tucked away in the set, such as the original tape rip of Friends - which all other versions came from. This definitive set truly reflects Pacâ€™s evolution as an artist and his prolific nature in producing 12 discs worth of non-retail material. Support of this project may also result in an invitation to participate in future exciting projects!

Do not be fooled by knock off imitations of our products by people who sell second and third generation imitations. These songs are not your average Limewire "cdq" download versions that do nothing but disappoint. You will be quite pleased with the thoroughness quality of the set for years to come!
