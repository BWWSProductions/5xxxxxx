PLOT
Jack Parsons grew up in poverty while suffering through childhood at the hands of an abusive, alcoholic father. Jackâ€™s brother-like bond with his wealthy neighbor Freddy, and his secret love for Anne the neighborhood beauty, were all that made life tolerable. Now at college, Jack attacks life with a vengeance. Fuelled by narcotics, alcohol, and a â€œcanâ€™t lose philosophyâ€, he runs with the popular crowd, pledges the schoolâ€™s most exclusive fraternity, and continues to pine for Anne even though he knows Freddy loves her. The drugs, booze and death defying initiation process cannot stop Jack, but a series of devastating blackouts that force him to question reality stagger Jack like a backhand smack from his old man and threaten to end his perfect life.
