It's got so many party songs on and you think it's good 
when you get to the next track it gets even better.

Ok people i have to say that this is the best party CD 
ever made and i would know! 

This pure cheese cd gets better and better by each track. 
It's like no other party cd i know off, but the crazy thing 
is people they discontinued it.
 
The copy i had was not mine im sorry to say. But theirs gotta 
be a copy out there somewhere.

BUT Remember this is by far the best. No Joke.
