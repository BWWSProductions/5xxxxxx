,altemeldo,2010-02-25T22:38Z,"Good job MKVGuy. U've wised me up to the MKV format. U suggested StaxRip and HandBrake. I just came across MakeMKV. It's also very good and quite fast too.

I'm looking forward to you uploading Sherlock Holmes and Book of Eli. Cheers."

,Mascun,2011-02-01T12:33Z,"Re. subtitles for Mahfuz2009 
I use Subtitle Workshop (freeware), but since it does not accept MKV format, I first made an .avi copy of the movie, worked on the subtitles to fit them into the time frame, and used the result on the MKV version which is far superior to the .avi "
