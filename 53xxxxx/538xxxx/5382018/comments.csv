[T],skJGZV6z,2010-02-26T11:30Z,"I'm only equipped to receive SD signals for the time being.

FBNHD is geared to stock traders, with tickers and headlines run in the pillars left from the 4:3 aspect main-program. The SD channel is simply missing those data pillars. You're not missing anything."
,Bonodogo,2010-02-27T04:41Z,"Thank you for all you do,
HD or not, it's all good."
,Libertywithout,2010-05-04T00:58Z,"I had the same HD questions expressed here.  Never thought shows like Glenn Beck and John Stossel would appear. 

Thank you so much for posting these programs for those of us without FBN.  Please continue!"
