Each week Aled Jones plays tracks from a broad musical spectrum, that celebrates both our choral traditions and the vibrant world of modern music as well as spiritually uplifting and reflective music. He also discusses religious and ethical issues of the week with faith representatives.

This week Aled says Good Morning Sunday to The Hollies, who had more hits than The Beatles in the 1960s and 1970s, and who are about to be inducted into the 2010 Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame. Faith Guest Alison Murdoch discusses the week's news from a faith perspective, and gives the Moment of Reflection.
