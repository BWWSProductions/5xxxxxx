,bil_gr7,2011-10-24T15:38Z,YOU HAVE SPAMMED EVERY FUCKING ROCK TORRENT OUT THERE! Your band must really fucking suck if you need all those lame spam ads to promote it.
,eatmecaptain765,2011-10-25T12:41Z,"bil_gr7,   Not my band.. But I know the keyboardist...  Sorry if I annoyed you with some comments to promote a free cd.
Hope you checked it out..  I'm sure you'll love it!  Respect!"

,cranberryEve,2011-10-26T08:34Z,Thanks!
[T],raidy,2011-11-06T02:19Z,"I would have seeded it, it's ok.. But the spamming? Seriously? WTF dude. Now, I promise you; HHI will *never* rip and release anything this group creates."
,eatmecaptain765,2011-11-07T09:17Z,"HAHA oh please, raidy...  At least I get permission from the artists I upload here.  (Just like you, right? ;)

 Who cares if I try and 'spam' these artists a little??  They deserve a few listens.   
Rock ISN'T Dead.   People just need to hear some new rock again.  I'm sure you agree.   

Don't act like you guys really get upset that I posted some comments in other torrents comments section to support other TORRENTS..

I hope you enjoyed the music as much as I did!  We are all on the same team, silly!"
,eatmecaptain765,2011-11-07T09:19Z,"If you guys like this group you might dig these guys!  Check them out.  They kick ass!!

,BBpartY,2011-12-02T00:26Z,This is fucking Great.
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-01-10T20:53Z,"The spamming doesn't bother me, because the only places I've seen it are on torrents for shitty rap music or torrents that have already been uploaded 200 times (Nevermind, Dark Side Of The Moon). People need to stop wanking over ""classic rock"" and expand their horizons a little."
,Ghostmorph4,2012-02-14T21:09Z,"Frigging loved it, Thanks Man!! Thumbs up :)"
,krikri3,2012-03-10T13:32Z,"GREAT MUSIC

,JoabW,2012-03-26T19:46Z,"You are a fucking cunt, that fucking spamming. Fuck you, the band is obviously shit if you have to resort to dick tactics. I actually heard about this band elsewhere and was going to download, but no. Just as a point. I will also make sure nobody that I know even looks in the direction of this band.
Yes I mad"
,AlHubbard,2012-03-28T00:39Z,"@JoabW.. U mad bro??!  Haha.  Maybe this torrent was spammed alittle on this site, but I'm glad.  This record was actually really good.  I'd like to hear more from this group. "
