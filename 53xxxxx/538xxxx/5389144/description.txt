What was originally a collaborative side project of instrumental jams, The Botanist is structurally redefined in 2009 with the assemblage of Kyle Comeaux, Mike King, Tim Hebert and Jesse Lasala. Along with prevailing riffs and lyrics of imagery, The Botanist brings to the table a psychedelic/stranded sense of rock with a flavorful hint at sex and devilish nature. The self-produced debut EP â€œAbout Ghostsâ€ containing vocals captured in a closet under a set of stairs was released on Mardi Gras 2010 and will provide the basis for what is to come.
