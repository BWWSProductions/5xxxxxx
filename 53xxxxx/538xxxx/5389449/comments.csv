[V],twentyforty,2010-02-25T11:57Z,"@lover: I did it twice - I do not know why but both encoding ended as - ugly.
Both were from DVD, and now I am in waiting for new source, HDTV airing of R&J.1996... 
Not to bitch about, but I have downloaded 9.9 GB so far - and now that 5 GB... please, show more patience, you can see what takes to get one 300+MB encoding out, its not easy and for sure costs lots of my time and few other things."
