Doctor Spektor is a "occult detective" that appeared in Western Publishing's Gold Key Comics and was created by writer Donald Glut and artist Dan Spiegle.

After his first appearance in a 10 page story in Mystery Comics Digest #5, Dr. Spektor was spun off into his own title, The Occult Files of Dr. Spektor.  The series ran for 25 issues (May 1973 - May 1982), the final issue a reprint of #1.  Jesse Santos replaced Speigle as artist on the series, and remained there for the entire run.

Dr. Spektor appeared in four issues of Gold Key's Spine-Tingling Tales, where he provided linking narration for the stories within.  He also appeared in one issue of Gold Key Spotlight (#8, August 1977), which was his last original appearance.

Don Glut had Dr. Spektor crossover with several of his other Gold Key characters such as Tragg and Dagar. Tragg and Lorn make cameo appearances in issue #19. Ostellon, Master of the Living Bones (from Dagar #1) appeares in issue #7; issue #15 concludes a story begun in Dagar #13, and Durak from Dagar appears in #16. Doctor Solar appears in several issues (#14, #18, #23), and Gold Key's The Owl appears in #22.
