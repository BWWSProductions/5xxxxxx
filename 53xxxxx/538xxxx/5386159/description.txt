           Edwardian child Enid Blyton begins to tell stories to her      
           brothers as an escape from their parents' rows before the      
           father deserts the family. Whilst training as a teacher        
           after the Great War she sends her stories to publishers,       
           one of whom, Hugh Pollock,takes her on and also marries        
           her. They have two daughters but Enid is a terrible            
           mother, letting a nanny rear them whilst she, ironically,      
           bestows treats on anonymous children who worship her for       
           her stories. She is completely self-absorbed,driving Hugh      
           to drink and then to another woman. Enid uses the              
           children as emotional blackmail to get a divorce on her        
           terms before marrying Kenneth Waters, a weak man similar       
           to her father. After World War Two she is as popular as        
           ever, despite accusations of using a syndicate to pen her      
           books and will carry on,adored by children who do not          
           know her true nature, for another twenty years and her         
           death in 1968.
