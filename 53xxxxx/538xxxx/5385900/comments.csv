But one of them is full of viruses. Such a fucking pain in the ass getting these off. I suppose the uploader is targeting the right people, though. >_>"

,JenniLee,2010-04-27T05:30Z,Fuck me! I didn't read the comments first now I have a Win 7 thing! Bullshit! this didn't work!
,JenniLee,2010-04-27T21:21Z,"PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT! It is loaded with some of the most malicious viruses and malware that I have ever come across! I had to completely restore my system to factory settings. Which means I lost everything! (It even infected my  external hard drive that was plugged in at the time making all the .exe files unusable. It deleted all my ant-virus software. It had this win 7 (anti-virus faker) go nuts on my system telling me I was infected from here to tim-buck-two. Avast was the only one left standing and it wasn't able to remove it (error). So I decide to run a deep scan on start-up with Avast. BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER! That allowed to Virus to truly embed itself on my computers operating system (by the way, I'm stuck with Vista again! Bleck!--had windows 7). At this point I can't enter safe mode on any level or do a system roll-back. No, the only option I have is to completely restore my computer to factory settings. I had assignments due, I lost word, photoshop, and many other very important programs for me to have. 

To the poster: I hate you! I hope you get into a horrible car accident and become a paraplegic retard and that your children hate you and your wife find someone better. You are not worthy of death."
