@CARPO0911

Download the missing .DLL file from: www.dll-files.com or ask our Support to send the file to you: Games4theworld@hotmail.com
Then, when you have the .DLL file, copy it too: C:\Program Files\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2010

The Game should work now."

,MikeSully09,2010-05-15T00:14Z,Hey! Wondering if anyone can help? This is my first time using tpb and am not exactly sure what to do! I have downloaded the torrent and the fix from the forum listed below. Torrent is saved in my miro folder but could not put the fix there so I saved it onto my desk top. Tried to use winrar to install and followed the instructions but nothing has happened. Any ideas what I am doing wrong?
