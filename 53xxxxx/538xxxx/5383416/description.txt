With Smoke & Mirrors, Lifehouseâ€™s fifth studio album, lead singer/guitarist Jason Wade, drummer Rick Wollstenhulme, bassist Bryce Soderberg and newly added guitarist Ben Carey, along with long time producer Jude Cole, have created a set that combines their live sound with great record making.
Smoke & Mirrors started out with a mission to capture the live, rock side of the band: a sound they had perfected after three years of solid touring. However, after living with the early tracks and experimenting with others, a piece of the puzzle seemed to be missing.
