and im into dnb since end 2008
and into dubstep since beginning 2009 =)
i really like this sample ive got it like one week after it was up

but ive got one question to all ya junglists warez-guys and dubheadz out there

how do you sort your music ?

because i use itunes and do it like this:
example on this torrent
1. load all files into itunes
2. mark all loaded music
3. name it to ""Deluxe Dubstep From Pirate Station ""
4. change album artist to ""various artist""
5. search in google for ""Deluxe Dubstep From Pirate Station "" and take a funny or cool pic for cover

so i have all the music from this torrent on one album and not so many separate icons in itunes

but im not as happy as i want with this method
how do you manage this better ??? "

,sister_kelly,2010-06-26T18:49Z,"eagertestical, there's a program called Stash, Store, & Sort for hiding/organizing drugs. it's what i use. there's so many options, such as sort by weight, by type of high, or anything! it's only $4.20 to buy the program on

,smokestacksunrise,2010-09-01T08:49Z,Such an awesome upload. One of the best on the net for sure. Pity all the artists aren't tagged properly but no complaints. More please!
,Tulkoju,2010-09-14T10:52Z,"@eagertestical-you should do like chong in up in smoke & just swallow all your drugs at once. that way the cops can't bust you.
@Don139 - the best way is to just make a playlist in itunes before uploading it to your iphone.

I personally think that music players should have two or three album possibilities for the mp3 tags and two or three artist names and two or three genres. What do you do with tracks listed ""artist A vs. artist B"" If you list it under one artist's name you don't find it under the other's name, if you list it under the other, you don't find it under the first.... and so on an so forth."
