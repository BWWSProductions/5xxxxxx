  Please do not comment about Seeding, since this Torrent has just been Uploaded; the only Seeder at the moment is our Seeding Central. We can't seed 24/7, but we do our best to Seed as much as possible, until the Torrent has been fully-seeded.
So please be patient."
,Sentinalh,2010-02-27T02:42Z,"Hi, I just finished downloading this and it isn't working. First of all I couldn't find the registry key you mentioned in the install guide, it simply wasn't there. There wasn't even a Sims folder in the path specified.

I skipped that step then and did the next two steps but when I tried to run the first patch in crack 3 folder I got an incorrect game region error.

Would really appreciate some help here, and yes I did get the base game from you."
[T],Games4theworld,2010-02-27T11:49Z,"Hi,

If you don't do the first part, yes, you'll get the 'invalid region' error.
After you've Installed The Sims 3, restart your PC. If you're using Vista, open ""Start"" and type ""regedit"" in de search box and then press [ENTER]. Now you're in the Register Editor. Be sure you go exactly to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Sims\The Sims3
There you'll find a file called 'SKU'. Double-click on it and change the value to 2. Click 'OK' and close the Register Editor.

For XP you'll have to open ""Start"" and then click on ""Run"" and then do the same as I said above. (Type ""regedit"" and then press [ENTER])

The file should be there in the Register Editor.

[T],Games4theworld,2010-02-27T19:29Z,"Hi,

   It may be different for Windows 7, as we tested it on Windows Vista. Please go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Sims\The Sims 3    and see if the 'SKU' file is there."
,KameronA,2010-02-27T20:18Z,That did the trick! It worked just great followed all the instructions and did it on Windows 7. The SKU file is in: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Sims\The Sims 3. Thanks so much Games4TheWorld! I also received all the latest updates and the game is running fine and smooth!
,Sentinalh,2010-03-01T16:54Z,"Thanks for the Windows 7 update, the game is working perfectly and I'm very satisfied with it. I got this primarily to see if it would fix a problem I had after getting the base game where it would kick me out all the time. So far this seems stable and I'm now seeding this most of the time, thanks alot. Any plans for a Bioshock 2 torrent?"
[T],Games4theworld,2010-03-01T18:56Z,"Hi,


 @Yusshin

If you backed up the Save file from the previous Game, you should be able to Import it to World Adventures. I'm not sure, since we did not test that.


@Sentinalh

Yes, we already got the files for Bioschock 2, only needs testing and an Installation Guide. It'll be uploaded as soon as we got it all finished.

Have fun playing,

You forgot to replace the original .exe with the Cracked one. Do the following to fix this:

Open the 'Crack 4' folder in the '# Crack' folder ín the .rar file you Downloaded and drag & drop the two files in there to: C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 World Adventures\Game\Bin  and REPLACE them by the existing ones.
The Game should work now.

,IZZY-E,2010-07-24T08:33Z,"Ok I figured this installation out. You need all expansion packs and the base game from Games4theworld to install this. So you need to download The Sims 3 base game, World Adventures, High End Loft Stuff, and Ambitions all from Games4theworld which all can be found here on thepiratebay and neet to be installed the order i mentioned. Just follow their guide until you get to the point where you open up the launcher to update the game as directed. The essential key to being able to install these expansion packs is to avoid updating ""The Sims 3"" base game to version 1.14. If you do, then the games will not work. So after you got the expansion pack ACTUALLY installed on your computer, you will eventually be instructed from the installation guide to update the game. Go ahead and go to the update tab from the launcher as directed and download the updates. Note that when you clicked update now it will bring up the download manager and download two updates. The first update is so you update the expansion pack which is ok because it will not update The Sims 3 base game to 1.14. The second update is to update The Sims 3 base game to 1.14 which YOU CANNOT DO. So when the updates are done downloading, a window will pop up and ask you if you want to allow the installation of the updates to continue (giving you the option of yes or no). ONLY CLICK YES FOR THE VERY FIRST POP UP WINDOW. Because the first window that pops up, is for the installation of expansion update. The second is for the sims 3 which will update the sims 3 base game to version 1.14. So one your done installing the first update a second window will pop up and all you have to do is click no and the sims 3 base game will not update to version 1.14. After that update step go ahead and crack it and move on to the next expansion pack and repeat what i just explained. Note that when your about to install the next expansion pack, it will tell you that ""The Sims 3"" base game needs to be updated. Go ahead and allow it to update because it will update The Sims 3 but not to version 1.14. So all in all your final versions of all the games should come out to this.

The Sims 3: 1.12.70.006001
World Adventures: 2.9.10.007002
High End Loft Stuff: 3.5.8.007001
Ambitions: 4.0.87.006001

Installing our Ambitions release from www.games4theworld.org should fix your problem.


@IZZY-E 

That's right, the EA Download Manager has nothing do to with the Game, so it doesn't matter if you do or don't uninstall it.

 Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself.

Please first install Late Night, Outdoor Living Stuff and then all other expansions you'd like. When you've installed those, install WA.

I have the Retail version and upon trying to get this expansion (my first expansion so far) I found that I pulled my hair out for around 7 hrs trying to figure this thing out.  Finally, I found a solution that seems to work.

1. Install The Sims 3 over (if you have it currently installed, uninstall it and then reinstall).

2. Assuming your game is at v 1.0 (like it should be), google a patch that will update your game from v1.0 to v1.8.  DO THIS BEFORE YOU EVEN TOUCH ANYTHING IN THIS EXPANSION PACK.

3.Once done, continue on with changing the region code to value 2 and with installing the things in the ""crack 1"" folder and putting the things in ""crack 2"" folder into your game files.

4. Install the expansion pack as the instruction guide tells you, using one of those codes provided.

5. Search for a patch that will update your game from v2.0 to v2.5. MAKE SURE YOU GET A WORLD WIDE VERSION OF PATCH.

6. Put the files from ""crack 4"" folder into your world adventures folder.

And that should be it... Or at least that's what I did and everything seemed to work out right :)

Hope this helps someone."
