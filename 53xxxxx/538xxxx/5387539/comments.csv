,meandrunk,2010-02-28T12:56Z,use revo uninstaller its here somewhere  
,ndva85,2010-03-26T02:29Z,"Patch.zip ended up showing as corrupted to both 7-zip and windows compressed folders plugin.  Not likely to be an error with the rar archive, I think, as I was able to extract the keygen and the rar containing patch.zip successfully from the multi-part rar.  What unzip tool works with the patch.zip file?"
,aim4it,2010-04-02T00:08Z,"The archive is fine, you just have to extract all archives ag-3803a through ag-3803-i, then combine all the .r00 parts.

Honesty I don't understand why people pack this way, it makes more work.

Also virustotal didn't like the keygen (6/42)

,knighton,2010-04-09T17:10Z,What a truly stupid way of packing it - AVOID!!!
,Tiny Turtle ,2010-07-02T15:35Z,"Exactly how do I apply the patch? I expected an .exe, but the ""patch.zip"" instead contained a big bunch of .dll files and a .dat file. - Can I run the .dat file somehow?"
,Tiny Turtle ,2010-07-02T16:11Z,Nevermind. I'm a klutz for not reading the nfo which clearly states I should just copy the contents of the 32 bit or 64 bit folder to the installation directory.
