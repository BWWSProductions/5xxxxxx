Who could have known that the much-loved Orbison would record his best album at 
this late stage in his career; furthermore, that he would be dead a few months 
later. The success of his role in the Traveling Wilburys gave him a much-deserved ... 
Full Descriptionboost. Orbison had the great voice of pop and after many years of 
indifferent material he finally hit gold with great songs such as 'You Got It' 
(written with Lynne and Petty), 'Careless Heart' (written with Diane Warren) and 
'A Love So Beautiful' (written with Lynne). Orbison's tragic dedication to us when 
he finished this album was 'don't give up before the miracle happens'. 

Although it had been years since his last recording, Roy Orbison was inducted into 
the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. Perhaps as a result of the newfound interest 
in his music, he was invited to record with the supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. 
Orbison had a renewed sense of purpose, and also began recording material for a new 
solo album. Collaborating with Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty, Orbison re-creates the feel 
of his old recordings while sounding modern. His voice sounds as strong as ever, and 
he is still able to hit the high notes that convey a sad, lonely ache. The highlight 
of the album is "She's a Mystery to Me," a haunting ballad penned by U2's Bono and the 
Edge that perfectly plays to all of Orbison's strengths as a singer. Released in the 
months after his death, Mystery Girl was the highest-charting album of his career and 
spawned the hit "You Got It" -- it is a shame that Orbison was not around to experience 
his success. This comeback album represents Roy Orbison at his best.
