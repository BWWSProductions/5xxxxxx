,MrDrado,2010-09-02T19:35Z,A Great series. Probably one of the best. Read all issues and play both games again and ull get a  totally different experience. Worth the read!  Unfortunately issue #47 is missing otherwise all is well. Thanks for the upload!

,Random_for_Fun,2011-07-16T20:01Z,"Hey man, I love the torrent.  I was wondering if you could upload the Darth Maul series for me.  I have been looking for that for a while.  But anything would be great.  I can't afford to buy comics right now because of the economy, but once I can I plan on buying them again from my local comic store."
