Release notes:

Fifth album, following 2007's 'Puzzle', from the Scots progressive indie
rockers. Here they forgot the over commercialism of 'Puzzle' in favour of a
return to their classic style welding emo-style structures to technically
complex math- and jazzcore elements. Named for the novel by Mark Danielewski,
produced once again by Garth Richardson (Gallows) and with striking cover
artwork shot by the legendary Storm Thorgerson, the album includes the singles
'Mountains', 'The Captain' and 'That Golden Rule'.

Enjoy!
