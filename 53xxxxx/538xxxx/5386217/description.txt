A little something to offend everyone!  Mel Brooks' uproarious version of history proves nothing is sacred as he takes us on a laugh-filled look at what REALLY happened throughout time.  His delirious romp features everything from a wild send-up of "2001" to the real stories behind the Roman Empire (Brooks portrays a stand-up philosopher at Caesar's Palace), the French Revolution (Brooks reigns as King Louis XVI) and the Spanish Inquisition (a splashy song-and-dance number with monks and swimming nuns).  It's Mel and company at their best.
