The Fall Of Berlin (Padeniye Berlina) made in 1949 is Mikhail Chiaurelli's epic Stalinist reconstruction of World War II.

Presented to Stalin as a gift on his 70th birthday the classic film is now presented with fully restored picture and sound and fully updated English subtitles.

It is a brilliant film and one of the best Soviet and War films ever made.
