For those wanting some background on BA work then this is an essential guide.

However, please note - this is a DRAFT FOR PUBLIC REVIEW of the BA BOK.  It is NOT the final release.

Therefore, it is not complete.  The text won't be 100% correct, and the later sections are missing.

I've been searching everywhere for the release version, but sadly have yet to find it.  I got this hoping it would be better that I already have - sadly it's the same.

I'll keep looking.  This is a good copy if you have nothing, however you can also grab it at the iiba web site.......  Hopefully someone will find the real deal......."

Do you happen to have Security Risk Management Body of Knowledge? Would help me so much! Need it for school.

Please post it here if you have any idea how I could get it :)

Thank you in advance"
