,JSMURF19,2010-03-07T15:07Z,CAN U DISABLE ALL THE ANNOYIN FEATURES THT POPS UP ON U MORE WHILE?
,Torrent_Meister,2010-03-13T01:02Z,"What in the hell are you talking about? You mean Security Centre? Go to control panel and work it out from there or google ""Disable [Feature here]"""
,danz207,2010-05-22T07:27Z,"ummmm, when i installed it said XP Pro!
Is this pro with MCE features installed or is this just Pro!"
,danz207,2010-05-22T07:48Z,"nevermind, its XP Pre with Media Center SLIPSTREAMED, i give it a 5, i wanted the ORIGINAL MCE!"
,danz207,2010-05-22T07:49Z,Pro*
,Torrent_Meister,2010-05-22T22:05Z,"I can upload the original MCE, however I find this easier as it only uses one disc, whereas the standard one is 2 discs. And there is no discernable difference between them both :)"
,ndame121,2010-11-28T22:04Z,sounds great downloading now great instructions and i like how you include poweriso although i already have it.
,ndame121,2010-11-28T22:10Z,desperately needs seeders will seed when done
,kosta032,2010-12-01T03:26Z,downloading now will pos review
,appjock,2010-12-20T21:39Z,"Torrent_Meister, you mentioned that you can upload the original MCE that comes in 2 Disks.  I have been removing viruses and from my laptop and now it keeps asking for disk 2 of MCE.  I really need this 2 Disk version (specifically XP MCE 2002 SP2).  Can you please upload?  It would help me out greatly.

,calanthe2,2011-09-13T18:45Z,Works perfectly. No issues at all on an ancient Vaio RZ 22G. Thanks so much. 
,sheiep,2012-03-23T23:41Z,Fine work sir!  Works like a champ.
,mike18xx2,2012-04-25T03:26Z,"If you cannot use this to repair-install an existing Media Center installation, then it is NOT ""kosher"", and you didn't make it right.

So....does it?

= = = = = =

FIRST RULE OF WINDOWS XP CD ""BUILDS"":

-- If they don't support ""repair-install"", then they are:

SHIT.

Why? A clean-install of XP is the biggest fucking pain in the ass if you have anything newer than a Pentium III, because you'll be missing half the drivers, and it'll be a goddamn chore to hunt all the fuckers down.

And every uploader who doesn't say whether repair-install is supported needs to be punched in the head until he shapes up.

(Been looking, for years, for a clear repair-install capable CD of Media Center which does NOT demand a serial half-way through.)"
,mike18xx2,2012-04-25T05:33Z,Asks for a product-key halfway through the install.
