PowerISO is also included, to allow you to burn the Windows XP image if you have no ISO software installed.

Shown below is the content of the ReadMe

Windows XP Media Centre Edition 2002

FAQ's

Is this version of Windows XP activated?

YES! 100%

Does this version of Windows XP work with Automatic Updates and Windows Genuine Advantage [WGA]?

Yes! 100%

Ok, great so what do i do with it now i've downloaded it?

Well, simply use your favourite ISO burner, or install the copy of PowerISO i have provided with
the torrent, and slip in a CD-R/RW or a DVD-R/RW and burn the image. This disc will then be bootable.

Umm ok well why won't my computer boot from the CD/DVD?

Check your BIOS! There should be an option somewhere something like "Choose first boot Device", make
sure that this option boots from your CD/ATAPI drive FIRST. Then when it asks you to press any key 
to boot from CD, just press any key to start Windows Setup.

So, i plan to install this on my computer, what features does this edition come with?

Well, the features it comes with are:

- .NET 1, 1SP1, and 2 are fully integrated and have been slipstreamed.

- Service Pack 3 is also fully slipstreamed.

- Windows Media Player 11 is installed by default

- Internet Explorer 7 is also installed by default

- No need to enter a product key, as that too is slipstreamed

- Also comes with Windows Dancer and all of the extra Media Centre features.

- x86 [32bit], so it is compatible with most software made for Windows

- Includes the Royale theme for Media Centre
