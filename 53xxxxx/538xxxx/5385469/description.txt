Mike, a freelance journalist, sees a pretty blonde, Claire, for the first time at the pool of his apartment house. For him it is love - or at least strong attraction - at first sight. Moreover, she seems to respond to his attention. Mike decides then and there to win Claire for himself. 
He next sees her in the laundry room of the apartment building and strikes up a conversation. They enjoy talking to each other but when he invites her out, she turns him down. Later, when he visits her apartment, they talk again and there is an unmistakable spark between them. Still, she refuses to date him even though she admits that she hasn't a boyfriend. Mike is puzzled. 
Shortly afterward, he learns the truth. Arriving at her apartment one evening he finds the front door ajar. Looking inside he sees Claire locked in a passionate embrace with her roommate lnez, a beautiful brunette. 
Mike's discovery of Claire's lesbianism is a challenge to his male ego. He is certain 
that he can win Claire away from lnez, and he resolves to do just that. He leaves, and the girls enjoy a night of passionate, tender lovemaking.
