I thought I knew a little bit something about jazz, but since I discovered your CDs, I go from one wonder to the next. I always wait and monitor eagerly the delivery of your latest musical jewels.
Thanks. Patrick"

Thanks again!"

I have already seeded 2.75X more than I downloaded; and I will continue to seed this for a while."
