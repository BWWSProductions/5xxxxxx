Sonny Stitt  - Sits in With Oscar Peterson Trio 
Year: 1957/59
Label: Verve (1991)
Total time: 51:06
Quality: 320 kbps

This CD combines together a complete session that Sonny Stitt (doubling on alto and tenor) did with the 1959 Oscar Peterson Trio (which includes the pianist/leader, bassist Ray Brown and drummer Ed Thigpen) and three titles from 1957 with Peterson, Brown, guitarist Herb Ellis and drummer Stan Levey.  The music very much has the feel of a jam session and, other than a themeless blues, all of the songs are veteran standards.  Highlights of this fine effort include "I Can't Give You Anything but Love," "The Gypsy," "Scrapple from the Apple," "Easy Does It" and "I Remember You."  Lots of cooking music. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG
