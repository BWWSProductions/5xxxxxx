But all in all thanks alot :)"
,angl.top,2010-10-14T18:47Z,I was wondering if you have Clockwork Angel as well?
,Animal1000000,2011-08-20T05:25Z,"Clockwork Angel is technically a different series, though it is in the same universe. It's set a 100 years earlier, and I believe shares none of the characters. I'm not sure as I haven't had time to start reading it yet.
Maybe tomorrow, since I'm now on holiday."
,TtToker,2011-11-23T01:07Z,well is it tomorrow yet??

,XxAnthony8xX,2012-04-03T10:31Z,"The infernal devices book 1 and 2 is set a couple thousand years before the mortal instruments, and serves as a prequel to the mortal instruments series.  The only character that is in the mortal instruments that is in the infernal devices as far as i know is Magnus Bane who is a warlock. It gives insight into the future in the infernal devices about two boys who are similar to the two boys in the infernal devices that are in the mortal instruments. Granite i have only started reading the mortal instrument book one city of bones so I dont know if there are any other characters from the infernal devices. in the series, but rumour as it that the mortal instruments is soon to be made into a major motion picture and should be a great movies series as the book have so far been a great series."
