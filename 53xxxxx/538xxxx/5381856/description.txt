This series is on DVD now, I ended up watching the entire season the first night. It was pretty funny and made me nostaligic for the films. I really wish they had a chance to come back for another season but I guess the fanfare wasn't there the first time around.I really hope they come back with one last movie with the entire cast past and present! Honestly could anyone even imagine a Friday movie with Craig, Money Mike, Smokey, Day-Day, Pinky and Deebo? Plus the other random characters like Ezhel the crack head, Uncle Elroy and Damon. I think Ice Cube and company owe that to us fans! Who do I call to make that dream come true lol??
