,DubMD,2010-03-27T06:41Z,"This is the most recent to date, I'm not sure when there will be more episodes, but I'll post a complete torrent of the season when it's done."
,techhippie,2010-05-07T05:39Z,"This season will actually be the longest yet. Rather than airing 13 episodes in one go, it will be 2 separate installments of 8 each. episodes 9-16 are scheduled to air starting summer 2010. Can't wait to see what plot twists are in store in the next part of the season!"
,xan175,2010-07-29T01:34Z,"Thanks, awsome seed"
,subversion,2010-08-06T00:53Z,The second half of the season airs in September. There's a trailer up on adultswim.com!
,TaiTheGuy,2010-10-31T01:25Z,One of the most well written animated series ever- and not imo... That's a fact
,hukelarper2010,2011-03-14T23:36Z,"thanks man dubMD, good sharing action...
