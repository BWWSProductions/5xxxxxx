Release Notes
Comments :
In New York, the experienced art thief, Keith Ripley, invites the bold thief
from Miami, Gabriel Martin, to team up with him. He plans the heist of two valuable
mysterious antique Faberge eggs, located in a safe, of the well protected Russian
jewelry Romanov. Each egg is worth twenty million dollars on the black market, and
Ripley needs his cut to free himself from his debt to a powerful mobster, known as
Nicky. The reluctant Gabriel agrees to participate, after having a one night stand
with Ripley's goddaughter Alexandra Karolin. Meanwhile, the persistent Lieutenant
Weber, who has unsuccessfully tried to put Ripley in jail for twenty years, figures
out how to anticipate the movements of the criminal in order to catch him.
