Please try to get newer version of you unpacking tools... because i think it's weird to blame it on ALL my torrents :)

search rarlab on google.

then select all the zips, and choose extract to here, then same again with the rars inside, that will extract it for you, i know these zip releases are annoying as you have to unzip and then unrar them,  which to me is a waste of time, but anyways...
