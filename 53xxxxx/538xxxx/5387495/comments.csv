,rrmerlin51D,2010-02-23T16:23Z,"Instead of uploading a show from 10 days ago how about last nights Damages?  With respect of your excellent work, just curious.  Be well and thank you."
,lilars26,2010-02-23T18:01Z,"Bill Maher is funny,relevent and on the ball.

I will thank you now 20-40."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-23T18:02Z,"@rrmerlin51D: Well, there are no ""Damages"" out yet. By no one. When they came out, after such nice call of yours, I would not care about.

BTW, I upped a movie from 1990. just last night.
I shouldn't keep doing that...

@Hhiiimmmm: Why in hell morons have been thinking that I watch, encourage every damn show or movie I up - for perfect strangers? Is that on some unimaginable way political incorrect thing to say or do? ""Forbid Bill Maher, he is against us!"" - is that you wanna say? "
,jiveclive,2010-02-23T19:02Z,"Good job, twentyforty. Thanks for this. I enjoy Bill M. And since I'm overseas, TPB is my source of choice. I'm not going to mention any names, but as you surely know, there are a kind of jerk that thinks everything centers around themselves and they reveal that in stupid comments that serve no purpose but to establish ""Hi, look over here, see an idiot.""

What I always say to them is, ""I'm so very sorry for you. Unfortunately, there is no cure for your condition."""
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-23T19:49Z,"LOL jiveclive, so true. Beside, it was very hard to find, even for me.

To all: do not hit&run. Seed to max. of your capabilities. Show to the brain-washed morons that freedom of speech cannot be stopped."
,rrmerlin51D,2010-02-23T20:12Z,"Dear twentyforty, if you check one of your long riot act statements you will notice that you would upload Damages Tuesday.  This Tues. or next?  Don't make statements that you can't cover.  You preached the sermon so don't cut someone that reminds you of its contents.  By the any Charlie Chaplin movies in your holdings?  I love old movies, some of the oldest.  I just expected something newer today.  Sarcasm often is as bad as straight out name calling.  Best wishes, and I mean that."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-23T20:35Z,"As said by jiveclive:
""I'm so very sorry for you. Unfortunately, there is no cure for your condition.""


Just - disappear. Now you look stupid AND evil. Damages was upped as my choice, in the past.
But never have entered my schedule on permanent basis."
,jon4fun,2010-02-23T20:50Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for this one. You can never have enough Bill Maher!

@ hhimmmmmm(whatever). You should consider yourself lucky that you had the oppurtunity and could afford to see Bill. You chose not to see him. Your CHOICE! Can I be any clearer?

@ rrmerlin51D. You are an idiot! I can't believe what you just did. You just pissed off one of the few people who listens, cares and appreciates  his fans.

Is it the winter olympics? Instead of watching anything and everything for 'x' hours a day, you now have the time to 'comment'.

@ 20-40. I apologise on behalf of all the idiots. It may seem trite but someone has to say ""I'm sorry""."
,rrmerlin51D,2010-02-23T20:56Z,You are the one that preached about using bad language yet you call  someone stating a fact as having a condition and being evil.  I just wondered about a TV show. No more no less.  I tried civility and get called names.  I still prefer civility.  Try it sometime. Thank you for the work you do. It is much appreciated.  Enough with this.  Be well.  I am. Thank you.
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-23T21:21Z,"""Check one of your LONG RIOT ACT statements you will notice that you would upload Damages Tuesday""

Check your wording. Then bitch about how people treat you.

""I just wondered about a TV show. No more no less. I tried civility...""

Nope. You are too stupid and too obvious:

""Don't make statements that you can't cover.""
""You preached the sermon...""
""By the any Charlie Chaplin movies in your holdings?""

Practically EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE is insult. Indented one, and unfortunately for you - sarcasm is a virtue of really smart people. As been funny."
,jiveclive,2010-02-23T22:50Z,"The beauty of not naming names is that someone comes along and we discover the cap fits. That's always interesting to observe, and comic (or karmic) relief as well. As Borat would say, ""Great success!"" "
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-24T07:59Z,"You should know better than this, zmacdaddy. What is funny differs from man to man. As in music, art, movies, beauty... et c. You know that for sure, and anything else is just imposing personal taste to anybody else.

Aside from that, I do NOT find Bill M. extremely funny, BUT I found extremely funny and silly how the subjects he touches responds. That IS funny, especially when morons try to convince other people that they got things right and anybody else is wrong.
We all know from where they come, from what mind-set - and from which country. I am sure that Bill Maher SOUNDS FUNNY to people outside the US. And the States aren't the World, right?"
