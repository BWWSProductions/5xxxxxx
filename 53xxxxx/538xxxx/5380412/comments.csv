,doiselldrugs07,2010-08-21T01:59Z,"i just hacked my psp (broke my old one) and now have the 5.00 GenB version or whatever it's called.
int he description it says that the game requires 6.20 OFW, does this mean if i actually buy the UMD i won't be able to play it without getting rid of my CFW?"
,Drexnaw,2010-09-01T04:29Z,"doiselldrugs07, go to psp-hacks, it has everything you need to get to 6.2. You need 5.50 Prometheus.
Now if I could only understand how to get further in the game..."
