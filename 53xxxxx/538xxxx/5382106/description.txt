"This book is designed to be the only book or course you need to prepare for and pass CompTIA's Linux+ Certification exam.

This books deals with all the objectives stated by CompTIA for the Linux+ exam. You learn how to deal with planning a Linux implementation (including installing Linux in a GUI or text-based environment) and configuring the Linus operation system after installation. This book also teaches you how to administrate and maintain your Linux system, troubleshoot common problems and how to identify, install and maintain system hardware.

My hope is that you'll find this book the most helpful Linux+ Certification product reference that you've ever read. I also hope that you'll use it not only to prepare for CompTIA's Linux+ Certification exam, but that you'll com back to it again and again as you perform your day-to-day Linux professional tasks."
