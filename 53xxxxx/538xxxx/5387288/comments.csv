,steph_raven,2010-03-15T23:36Z,very good copy but how do you get it to play as a dvd without a video_ts.ifo? 
,younggod,2010-03-17T02:39Z,"I'm not sure that I understand your question steph_raven, but, are you implying the files are missing a video_ts.ifo, or you want to burn a copy without the video_ts. ifo? I just merge the files with vobmerge, and burn the files, if the burner co-operates, and if not, I just convert the file. However, when I do merge the files, the vts_01_5 seems to be problematic and won't merge properly except for part of it, but it's just the end credits and the rest seem to be fine. I don't know why, I found out last night and I've never had this problem with the file before. I could just do a fix and upload the movie again."
