,bharatrn,2010-02-24T08:59Z,"Do you  have any idea when we will get HDrip of Precious?
The release date is the same as that of this movie."
,villeek,2010-02-24T23:56Z,"hmmh, is this really blu-ray? blu-ray.com says that this comes available at march 9th. answers please"
[V],-jonny-,2010-02-25T02:36Z,"Retail dates mean (almost) nothing. Things do exist before your see them in stores...

Also, the uploader is a vip, which should be confirmation enough for you.

Thirdly, you don't get fake torrents with this many seeds and nobody even questioning its legitimacy.

You must be new to all of this :)"

,Agantyr,2010-02-26T18:20Z,"I like the new studio policy of releasing movies after only relatively short runs in the theaters. 

Now seed. Remember: Seeding will make your willy thicker! Seeding will make you irresistible to highly attractive women! Seeding will make you not gain any weight what so ever, even on a diet consisting only of pizza & coke! "

,Denny33142,2010-04-07T02:28Z,"Just a heads up the file is to big to fit on a single layer dvd, if the file was only 200MB smaller it would have been perfect."
