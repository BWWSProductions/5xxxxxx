,goalie75,2010-02-23T23:56Z,seed. this shit is gonna take forever if theres only one seeder
,10011,2010-02-24T01:58Z,"Lol, 2h 35 min and 1%. I think most people are better of waiting for someone to download and reencode this file... this is just stupid - will my laptop even be able to handle playing a 37,9 gb avi-file? We'll see :)"
,Porkster,2010-02-24T02:59Z,This is fake for sure!!!
,goalie75,2010-02-24T03:13Z,c'mon only 2 seeders and 277 leechers?
,Paindrain,2010-02-24T06:33Z,"This is the Avi of Beavis and Butthead King Turg Collection, great collection, but not as advertised, i have the 16 dvds already!"
,k_semler,2010-02-24T22:28Z,"It's the real deal.  I used BitRipper 1.31 (018) to transfer the video to *.avi.  So unless you know of a better DVD-->AVI compression software, this is as small as it's going to get.  Ht hash value is as follows:

,iamadonut,2010-02-25T00:31Z,Could you make the download any fatter and less attainable?
,10011,2010-02-25T01:20Z,"No reason to whine at the uploader really, this is better than not uploading at all... This is the only available torrent at the time, and someone can download it and reencode it thus making it easier to obtain... For me, I can't wait. Only 20 weeks to go! "
,Paindrain,2010-02-25T01:29Z,"Bitripper must suck if all this is true (I played some of the file, and it was B&B)  To answer the question at hand about a better avi encoder then AutoGK would be far better, and you get to set the output size... also upping the dvd would be far far smaller!"
,SerSpec-V,2010-02-25T02:13Z,37.9G!!  Ha ha newb. If you don't know how to compress video then don't waste peoples time and leave it to guys that have a clue.  
,goalie75,2010-02-25T03:27Z,"It actually does download much quicker on vuze. On utorrent I was lucky to get over 15 kb/s, but on vuze its going up to 700 kb/s"
,k_semler,2010-02-25T09:22Z,"@Paindrain:

Thanks.  Re-encoding now."
,10011,2010-02-25T16:31Z,"It actually is MUCH faster with Vuze, how is that possible?"
,thevicar013,2010-02-25T19:12Z,"seriously deluded ppl, theres so many blatant indicators this is fake. One guy has said twice that this is b&butthead.
Yet the dicks in yr ears festival continues.
nice one k_semler is yur last name booth?
re-encode my bumcheeks"
,goalie75,2010-02-25T20:54Z,it isn't beevis and butthead. I just played some of it and it is definitely a marijuana doc
,10011,2010-02-25T21:32Z,"@ thevicar

Well I was doubtful so I just tried playing the file... and voila, the beginning of this movie. It's real..

Yeh, I only just realised the many pun opportunities but I won't apologise for that."
,Paindrain,2010-02-26T07:33Z,"not Beavis and butthead, must have been playing latent files. 4hope and quto gk comes out soon"
,goalie75,2010-02-26T18:32Z,has anyone actually finished downloading this yet?
,cj1404,2010-02-26T19:00Z,"@ k_semler

I found nobody complaining BitRipper 1.31 created AVI files 8 times the size of an un-compressed DVD.  This software creates AVI files on the fly.  It does not need 10 Gig of free disk space to create the AVI file.  So how could you have possibly had this problem?  

You work for the MPAA don't you?"
,cj1404,2010-02-26T19:06Z,"@ Phesage

This DVD is not available on BluRay."
,r2l,2010-02-27T01:56Z,"k_semler
You should just download Poweriso.
Create an iso from the dvd. If you need help I can easily post step by step guide.
BAM 4.x gbs
Then we get the whole dvd. :D"
,Paindrain,2010-02-28T04:04Z,"ty for continuing to seed this... if you use utorrent you should right click the torrent, click properties and enable Initial Seeding, this will share with those who are actually sharing, which should help speed this up if you arent going to up the dvd or do another encode. btw with autogk, if you didnt figure out the dvd stuff just choose this avi and encode it."

,Paindrain,2010-03-01T07:04Z,"anyone who isnt at the 37% or so right now should stop the download, it makes it slower for the rest of us,  many of which (like myself want to re encode this beast asap).   additional leechers slow this down"
,davidtres2003,2010-03-01T16:37Z,i just ordered the dvd as soon as i get it i will rip and up it should be here 3-4-10
,davidtres2003,2010-03-01T16:51Z,"also when i get it i will be ripping it to 3 different formats: AVI, MKV, AND M2TS that should cover everyones needs for a rip"
,joe_nobody,2010-03-02T02:15Z,"Dude what the fuck? 38gb? dvdshrink could have ripped this to a dvd5 1000 times in the time it will take you to seed this peice of shit. Do us all a favour and try again, please."
,10011,2010-03-03T00:57Z,Hasn't anyone found a different torrent of this somewhere yet?

50% downloaded already :)"
[T],FaeGiN,2010-03-05T16:18Z,"For the moaners who also seem to have no fucking clue.
It is EASY to create a massive sized avi like this if you are unsure of what you are doing. This can happen with ANY software so it isn't because he used a certain program. It is all to do with one simple little IMPORTANT setting: the compression, codec selection. A lot of first timers will use some software to rip to avi and not change or set the codec up. Usually in that case, on Windows at least, you have microsoft uncompressed selected by default so you end up with the biggest avi file ever.
So the guy tried, at least give him credit for that. but honestly, to the uploader, I would have stopped this one and made a new rip, deleted this seed as so many folk are going to be waiting much much longer than they would if you even just upped the whole DVD as an image file.
Anyway, that's me done."
