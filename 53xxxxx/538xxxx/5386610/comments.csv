,Bean-Bandit,2010-02-24T04:46Z,I'm having a issue with this copy. The movie starts off with the 20th Century Logo and then it crashes the player. Both VLC and my A.C.Ryan Media Player would not play this at all after the logo.
,Bean-Bandit,2010-02-24T15:53Z,Ignore my 1st comment. Come to find out I wasn't even finished downloading it yet. O.o

,Bean-Bandit,2010-02-28T10:56Z,V-7 A-9 Problem with these older movies is just that there old and so was the stuff to record it and print it out on DVD. Even though the box in stores say 1080p it's better viewed at 720p instead and you'll see when you watch it. Nothing against CHD242522 for the effort. When they convert these older movies to BluRay unless it's a digital remastered version your really just getting a upscaled version is all.
