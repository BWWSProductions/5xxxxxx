,jahnee,2010-02-26T19:51Z,No sound?
,figrindan,2010-02-27T03:42Z,"Playing with VLC and getting no audio.
Anyone else?"
,alcutter,2010-02-27T19:52Z,"Where's the audio, you jackass!"
,michaelrwatson,2010-03-04T03:39Z,"No audio, and WTF is x264..? Is that same as h.264? If so, then you are a real dumbass, aoloffline. H264 is not noticeably better than Xvid or DivX, so use those. They're much more compatible. 

And 4.37 GB????  **What* *The* *F*ck**? "
[V],-jonny-,2010-03-09T02:56Z,"What a load of pricks. x264 is much better than xvid. Anyone who knows anything about HD video knows that.

And this film ONLY HAS MONO AUDIO! It isn't possible to get anything else. It's not aoloffline's fault, or even DIMENSION's. That's all the disc offers. If you can't work out how to play it, you're a waste of space."
,Internet-Thief,2010-04-16T13:57Z,"I agree what a bunch of total dumb-asses. It surprises me they figured out how to work a torrent program.

Thanks for the great release, aoloffline!"
