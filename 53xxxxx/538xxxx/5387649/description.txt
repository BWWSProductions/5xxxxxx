The summer of 2005 was a productive but painful time for the late Ali Farka Toure. The great Malian guitarist came to London in the company of the kora star Toumani Diabate to give a concert and record what would be their final album together. Toure was seriously ill, but he was still on tremendous form â€“ as can be judged from this album. It's a set that's remarkable both for the delicacy and composure of the playing, and the sheer variety. There are languid, blues-edged treatments of ancient songs, along with such surprises as the lilting, Cuban-influenced Sabu Yerkoy, on which Toure sings against a flurry of kora, and backing that includes his son Vieux on vocals and congas. This is a magnificent and poignant farewell.

An album of spellbinding beauty.

You get the feel of two of the world's greatest musicians in a room together, having a conversation and creating a document that will carry their legacy into the future.
-- Pitchfork

Beautifully recorded, Ali & Toumani lives up to and perhaps exceeds expectations.
-- BBC

Ali and Toumani will certainly join the ranks of recordings that are "beyond criticism."
