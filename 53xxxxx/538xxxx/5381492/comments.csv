Anyone tried this, always dubious of anonymous up loaders, been a number of downloads, but no valid comments, apologies to the up loader and kudos to you, if this is indeed a clean, working soft-mod"

even better!
I found out that if you press + in the configurable usb loader it gives you the option to store a DVD to the hard disk !!!! So you just enter any game into the dvd slot and it makes a backup on the external hard disk!!!  afterwards you can once again use the ""WBFS Wii FileSystem for Windows"" also included in this kit, and use the disk on your windows, and use the ""04. extract ISO"" to make a safe backup to your PC. Notice that all backups will be 4.5GB, altough they were smaller on the external HD in the wii filesystem. Also don't be suprised when extracting the ISO the percentage goes up to 48% for example and says ""done, press any key"", I first thought this was faulty but apparantly the ISO is just fine...

even more crazy: I put a NTSC game in my PAL wii that couldnt be read by read by the wii itself, launched the app and pressed + and it read just fine!! Afterwards when it was on the hard disk I launched it and it played just fine!! an NTSC on my PAL :)))

take care you'all
