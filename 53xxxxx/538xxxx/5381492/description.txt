                                                ------------- 

I've converted consoles before, installed modchips and so on. So far my earlier experience with
the wii was installing wiikey v1 and argon modchips, but that was a while ago...

This morning I started working on softmodding my best friend's wii. Strange enough it took me
a very long time to figure out all the files to use. I can see A LOT of people out there are
doing some effort to make all kinds of wii software, but unfortunately a lot of them don't work
properly. I've also seen a lot of video tutorials that only explain part of puzzle...

What this 'kit' does is converting an official Nintendo wii to a hacked wii that can run homebrew
software or even backup games from a USB harddisk or memory stick. Also included is the full guide
how to play the new super mario bros on ur new hacked wii, as this was the final goal...

First of all you need to know what version of wii you have, go to Wii options (the ball in the lower
left corner of the wii menu that says 'wii'), there choose settings and you can see your firmware
version. This kit should be able to convert ANY wii from 3.0 to 4.1, but personally I only tested
it on a 4.1E, so I don't know about the others...

You need to have a SD card (doesn't matter how big) and a SD Card reader/writer in your PC or laptop.

Make sure the SD card is empty to begin with and unpack FirstSD.rar onto it.
Put it in the wii afterwards and click on Wii Options, Memory Management, Channels, SD
It will ask you if you want to load boot.dol, say yes
A message will appear saying you shoudn't pay for the software, be patient and wait 8 secs
Press 1 to continue and follow the installation of The Homebrew installer by pressing a lot
of times 1, you'll see...

Afterwards reboot your wii and you should have another icon that says 'The Homebrew Channel'

You can take the SD card out of the wii again and put it back in your pc. In the meanwhile,
make sure your wii is internet connected via wifi or LAN, preferably WIFI
Go to the wii options menu, choose settings, internet, and so on, do a test to make sure

Remove all contents of the SD card and unpack SecondSD.rar to it. This time go into the Homebrew
Channel and launch it, put in the new written SD Card and multiple programs should appear on the
screen. 

First of all go to "USB 2.0 snelheid" and install and run this. This modifies the USB read speed

Next choose "Trucha Bug Restorer". 

Load in the first screen ISO36, press 1 and so on until you get a menu where you can choose
"downgrade IOS15", select to load IOS from the SD Card and let it complete.

Afterwards run Truch Bug Restorer again, this time in the FIRST SCREEN use the pad left/right
to change the IOS, load IOS15!!!, continue on and when you come to that menu again select the 'Install IOS 36 menu'
(select 'yes' on all 3 patches) IOS36 to slot 36, again using IOS from SD card.

Run Trucha Bug Restorer again, in the first screen load IOS36 again, carry on to the menu and choose
this time 'restore IOS15'

When back in the Homebrew Channel, Run cIOS38r17 installer select IOS36 as the one it should use and then select wad install.

At this time your wii is actually hacked and ready, but we want loading from USB, so...

Back in the Homebrew Channel, Run ciOS 222 installer and complete it.
Normally you can now launch "Configurable USB loader" and play any game from usb you like, but you first need to prepare
the usb device. So get a USB stick of over 4GB or an external USB hard disk and connect it to your PC.
Format it completely using FAT32 filesystem. If windows doesn't allow this use Partition Magic 8.0
to format your external hard disk to it. For USB sticks there's a tool called HP usb format tool or something.
Remember the drive letter the new formatted USB device got. Go to the Software folder that came with
this kit and find "WBFS Wii FileSystem for Windows". Run it, specify the drive letter your usb device is on
format it to WBFS, choose option 01. Add to start adding .iso files. After all this is done reconnect the
usb device to the lower USB port of your wii. Launch "Configurable USB loader" and play the iso-game directly
from USB..... ALL DONE !!

                 I wish ALL other release groups the very best. "Scene" or not, who cares anyway?
