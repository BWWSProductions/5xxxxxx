,listenherenow,2010-11-12T15:20Z,"I am not sure about this one - i am going to do my best to convert this to DVD so it can play on any player. 

   I downloaded matriska before and it was some bogus crap.   I hope this isn't. 

  does anyone have any tips?    Why does this mention Iso  in teh codec ID? do I need to burn it with alcohol 120% ?  
  I will check back - I download very quickly if the seeders are up."
,listenherenow,2010-11-13T20:13Z,"Well. I am all done - plays Nice - excellent audio. 

  I guess in all my days I never moved a 4gig plus file to another drive. THIS WILL NOT MOVE.  i cannot move this file to my tb external for storage becuase windows 7 64 bit is so lame that it says its too big for the destination file. LOL

  I converted this to HQ DVD 8000kbs per second - PAL.  and when I was done the movie is only 1.59gigs.   But i wanted to save teh ORG mkv file cause i am a pack rat and I did that kinda shit. 

  I guess I will have to burn it to a DVD and then save I could copy the dvd to the HD if I wanted - or just stash the dvd some where to save some space.

 Just thought of that dvd thing. LOL

  Problem solved I suppose. 

This seems a little jittery on my conversion occasionally. 

  Also - the movie says HDnet or something like that in the right hand corner every so often. Kinda snaps ya back to reality when your buzzed and that sucks.  but it's still a great copy.

 I don't see how it could be copied from the reels and say HD Net in the corner like that. But whatever. "
,listenherenow,2010-11-13T20:46Z,"This is really odd, 
I was playing with this file - opened it with windows live movie maker and found all kinds of cool shit I can do with it . 

  I burned it to a DVD like I said I would do in the previous post to save this file for later when I want to try some other shit on it. That went well. fits right on the dvd almost exactly to the end. 

I discovered another little oddity as well. 

  when i deleted it i sent it to the recycle bin - then - just out of curiosity I checked the bin before I deleted it entirely and I found there was a file in there labled like this.

   Pink Floyd The Wall (1982) Limewire Torrent. 

  No Kidding?    "

@listenherenow
If the drive you're moving the file to is FAT32 formatted, it HAS a max file size (this isn't a windows thing). Look up what formatting the hdd is.

""The maximum possible size for a file on a FAT32 volume is 4 GiB minus 1 byte (232â1=4,294,967,295 bytes)."""
