,Spartanus,2010-02-22T22:11Z,Will you also have the sprint semi-finals? Or just the finals?
,BasilBrush,2010-02-22T23:47Z,It includes some of the semi finals from both the mens and womens heats but mainly it's the finals. It's 1.5 hours long with adverts removed.
,BasilBrush,2010-02-22T23:51Z,I'll devote all my upload bandwidth to the sprint so you should get it by the morning of 23rd Feb.

Thank you for your efforts in posting all the biathlon events. It is very much appreciated! Any possibility of re-seeding a few older races I am trying to download:

IBU Biathlon Youth World Championships Sprint Junior Men Canmore

IBU Biathlon Youth World Championships Pursuit Canmore

Thanks!"
