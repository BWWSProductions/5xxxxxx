The band's second album, War is the Answer, was released September 22, 2009. It was co-produced by Kevin Churko (Ozzy Osbourne) and mixed by Randy Staub (Metallica, Stone Sour, Nickelback). The album landed at #7 on the Billboard 200, moving over 44,000 in its first week of release; living up to the hype generated by leading UK heavy metal/hard rock media such as Kerrang! and Metal Hammer. The first single off the album, "Hard to See" entered US rock radio's top 10 after only a couple of weeks on the charts.

To promote War Is the Answer, Five Finger Death Punch embarked on the Shock and Raw US Tour. Main support on the tour was provided by Shadows Fall, with additional support coming from Otep and 2Cents. Upon completing the US run of the tour, Five Finger Death Punch then brought the Shock and Raw tour to Europe, finishing off with a run of dates in the UK. Main support for these dates was again Shadows Fall, and opening acts for the UK portion of the tour were Rise To Remain and Magnacult. At the conclusion of the band's show at the Electric Ballroom in London, Ivan Moody announced to the crowd the band would be playing the Download Festival in 2010[4]. Since the UK tour concluded, the band has also been announced as one of the headliners for the Metal Hammer Hammerfest II Festival in Wales in March 2010. They will also be performing on the main stage at Mayhem Festival 2010 from July 10 through August 14, 2010.
