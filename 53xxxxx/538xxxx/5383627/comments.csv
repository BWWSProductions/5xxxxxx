,wilsonamon,2010-03-02T10:20Z,Program would not load as I had disabled internet as instructed. Crack did not work because a bluRay DLL was missing. Quick download though. 
,elition,2010-03-13T05:59Z,"Fast download speed, works great.  If you're using windows 7, set inbound/outbound rules for the program in the windows firewall so it doesn't update.  Great bluray rips/burns as well! A++  "
,Niko2115,2010-03-16T04:05Z,"Ok so it downloaded very quickly, but I'm having some trouble using it, it says I need a license? I don't know I'm not very savvy with stuff, I'm sure it works fine I'm just not sure how to use it if I can get some help?"
,tavery80,2010-04-11T08:42Z,"Doesn't work for me.  After d/l, disabling internet, installing and then setting up firewall block, I replaced the existing DNC4 file with the cracked one.  Win7 pops up with ""DVDneXtCXOPY 4 Main Client has stopped working""."
,Admail,2010-09-20T22:50Z,Try to use the crack to patch the exe file and says this is a trail version or need key #.  Help!
[T],Oceanhawk,2010-10-30T05:26Z,"Thanks again RobbingHood for another great program. For those that cant get it to work....

1) Turn off internet
2) Install (DONT LAUNCH after it installs)
3) Go to the CRACK folder and Copy ""DNC4.exe"" (right click it and copy)
4) Paste ""DNC4.exe in the install directory (before you click ""install"" it will show you your install directory. Mine looks like this.. C:\Program Files\DVDneXtCOPY4. So i had to copy ""DNC4.exe"" in the DVDneXtCOPY4 folder. Now ""copy and replace"" (its an option that will pop up.
5) NOW launch program. 
6) Turn internet back ok. "

,Buckalou,2011-04-22T08:11Z,"thanks robbinghood, quick question I downloaded and installed everything went smoothly afterwards I got a message from AVG 2011 saying that malware was detected one I ran the program. THe file was named NSL8A75.TMP\STL_BBL.EXE, is it safe to allow this file to run? thanks"
