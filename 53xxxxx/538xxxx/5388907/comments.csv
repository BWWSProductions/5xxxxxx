,wickbus,2010-03-03T00:33Z,"People, please...if you got the whole download, start it again so others can get a completion (its called seeding).  As a guideline, if you complete a download, you should seed to a ratio of 10 to 1.  This will allow enough for others to have at least enough to create 1 full download again...otherwise the torrent is dead.  You completed the download by others keeping their torrents active, now you need to share otherwise the torrent dies and others get stuck with a partial torrent with no way to finish.  If you have this torrent, please seed for a while so others can finish"
,helmutlord,2010-03-03T01:52Z,"Wickbus, I'm still seeding constantly - though a bit slower, I agree.

I'll take you up on that generous offer (as well as continue to seed myself) but I can't seed much more than I am at the moment.

Is there a way I can seed directly to you, to help finish your download?"
,wickbus,2010-03-03T02:56Z,"I dont think so without resending the whole file...im at 97% now, just keep that seed going and after it completes...ill keep it going, this audio book is not just rare, its Super-rare, I'm not sure people know how lucky they are to be getting this complete 1-8.  Nice work on the accompilation Helmutlord, like I said, after this finishes, I'll keep it alive as long as I have internet connectivity...

Thanks again!"

,ABman18,2010-08-30T23:55Z,Now its stuck on a year...
,Pogmog,2011-04-05T10:35Z,"I have the books in my garage. I loved them so much when I was younger. 

I'm going to download this just so I can seed it after. ;)"
,jimmy.02,2011-08-07T15:35Z,SEED PLEASE!
,Wolfwithers,2012-04-08T20:59Z,"Thanks heaps guys took a little longer than I would have liked to get buy worth the wait for how rare this thing is.
