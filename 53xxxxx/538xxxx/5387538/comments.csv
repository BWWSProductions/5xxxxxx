[V],RiddlerA,2010-02-23T18:18Z,"@ Womenball

Will upload PB S 2 after 4 seasons of Dexter
PB is taking time as I don't want to compromise on the Quality & also Extras are creating Probs

@ gary2u

I only upload the series I follow
Unfortunately, never been a great fan of the series. "

,spartacu5,2010-03-05T00:23Z,"Newbie or NOOB as I am seeing it on here. I have the VLC media player. Can i burn this series to a disk to watch on a regular DVD palyer? If so, what program do you recommend to burn it with?"
[V],RiddlerA,2010-03-05T07:35Z,"@ Above 

Use VSO ConvertXtoDVD. Its a good Software to convert MKV files for playing in a dvd player"

,imzima,2011-07-31T21:23Z,"anyone noticed episode 4 dies at 4:51 ?
i'm using VLC so its odd cause it NEVER fails on any of the torrents i've watched from Riddler
not complaining, just thought i'd put it out there
rest of the file is perfect if u forward over this short part"
