,JackMack10,2010-02-21T21:50Z,hello do u need the other patches before installing this one ?
,Dido_SMK,2010-02-22T01:15Z,"no, only this"
[T],gunnersrock,2010-02-22T09:56Z,"thank you for the patch dido and thanks for naming the bin files which makes it easy to edit 
when i try to use 3rd kits the game crashes 
and could you add 3rd kits,scoreboard selector,xbox 360 buttons and emirates stadium in version 2.4 and add premier league's original replay logo(the spinning trophy)"
,JackMack10,2010-02-24T00:01Z,ok well I installed it and it works but i have a little problem with some kits like romania and nigeria first kit look all weird do you have any idea what the problem might be ?? i m pretty sure i got it installed correctly
,Milosevic61184,2010-03-02T14:37Z,"It's a great patch, but there is a problem..... Become a Legend mode in the game doesn't work with this patch.... and that's a shame... maybe it has something to do with 3rd kits, because first couple of games after you sign with a club are training matches... I don't know, please do something about this... is there a way to fix this?"
,zaka_7.8.9,2010-03-05T10:43Z,guys please share PES2010_EDIT.BIN and PES2010_OPTION.bin files separately...........i accidentally delete them
,Dido_SMK,2010-03-16T23:11Z,"there is a smoke patch 2.3.5+fix that is released , sadly not available in torrent (direct download only).
a lot of issues was addressed and fixed.
will release a torrent file when the 2.4 comes out."
,Maul99,2010-03-24T16:47Z,"This patch is pretty fucked up. Some real players are totally deleted from the game, for example Manuel Fernandes(Valencia) doesn't even exist."
,glasswings21,2010-03-31T20:43Z,This is a nice patch.....but is there a way i can use some of the faces i downloaded of the internet because there are few players of which faces i am not quite convinced of please let know if i can replace some faces and how? thanks!
