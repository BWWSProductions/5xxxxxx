1-st rip (test) made in a new mode ... mp3HD ! Only from MAE_INT.

- About mp3HD -

mp3HD is a new scalable format for high-quality lossless compression
of audio signals. It guarantees bit-exact reproduction of the
original PCM samples at state-of-the-art compression ratios. As for
all lossless compression formats, the compression ratio and resulting
data rate depends on the compressed content. As a rule of thumb, the
mp3HD codec can compress WAV files to about 30% to 60% of their
original size for typical audio content. Typically, smaller data
rates are needed to encode classical music or audio books, while Rock
and Pop music requires larger data rates.

mp3HD has been designed with the explicit target to be as compatible
as possible to the ubiquitous MP3 format. As a consequence, the mp3HD
format uses advanced compression algorithms and a special bit stream
format in order to be compatible to most of the available MP3 players.
Therefore mp3HD is both a lossless format for the reproduction of the
original PCM samples and a standard MP3 file that play's on your MP3
player.

The mp3HD Format supports tagging the files with meta data according
to ID3 Version 1.0, 1.1, 2.3 and 2.4. That is, you can use many
existing tools to add ID3 tags to your mp3HD content, and to manage
and organize your audio collection.
