,DikkatDeliVar,2010-02-23T11:50Z,Thank you so much. You made my day brighter mate. :)
,Jpsgreen,2010-02-23T12:10Z,Thanks!!!
,FPChris,2010-02-23T17:12Z,"Great Torrent, Great Seeders, Great Game.

Will be seeding untill tomorrow, cheers."
[T],Knaster,2010-02-23T17:58Z,Swedish game developers are THE best.
,Sematary,2010-02-23T18:26Z,"Great release!

But remember that this is a game made by fans, who put the effort that companies don't. Once it gets properly patched, buy it!"
,herniator,2010-02-24T04:12Z,"Definitely buy this game if you like it.  I have played the original hearts of iron 2 game for uncountable hundreds of hours over the years.  This is a game made by people who care, and has immense single player value (basically limitless unique replays, compared to the 4 to 10 hours of scripted action available in most modern FPS games or whatever).

Regardless, thanks for the torrent.  I will try the game and if it works well without the need to wait for patches, I will buy from steam for $20 (probably be $10 in a few months anyways)."
,Superbus,2010-02-24T05:02Z,"Yep, I bought this.

If you get a chance buy it later on. So great Grand Strategy is supported. Even if not DL it and try it out its great. 

If you have never tried a Paradox game because you thought the graphics are not the best then you are missing out.
"
,Redb123,2010-02-26T13:12Z,"Great game. Made by fans, if you like, buy it! It's very cheap and will allow the developers to keep developing this great game for you."
,elnerico,2010-03-12T06:13Z,File won't load after I've put it into daemon tools. Clicked the setup exe something pops but then it disappears. Will have to see what I can do...
,Tactical__,2010-03-13T13:01Z,"Thanks a lot for this! I loved HoI and HoI 2, but HoI 3 was a huge disappointment for me, so I've waited for this for a long time!"
,Juden_mingus,2010-03-29T19:10Z,"Got some nasty virus after installing this game, cant say Iam 100% sure if it was from this torrent but 99.9%. At the end of the installation when asked if u wanna install direct X I did and imedietly after that AVG and windows alerted that core files in windows had been infected. Found out later that AVG had blocked and removed D-tool and other programs aswell.
Trojan.Agents found:
Gen-SSHNas
Gen-Clickspy
Gen
Gen-RefPron
Gen-Scatter
Gen-EVid
Adware.Vundo Variant


The game itself worked like a charm though."
,Wopatoolie,2010-05-12T07:34Z,nice up
,knox666,2010-05-16T04:33Z,I have a beta 1.04 patch I got from the paradox forums. but it's not up anymore but I still have the .rar copy.
,knox666,2010-05-23T21:10Z,Now I have the official 1.04 patch if anyone wants it.
,Trijack,2010-05-28T18:37Z,"Sure, I'd love an upload"
,CzudakX,2010-07-24T15:41Z,This game is just super-killer piece of software.
,sonofus,2010-08-13T17:58Z,"Thanks for this game :)
(Some bug and sometimes really slow, but that's the game. A great one still.)"
,erikdell,2011-01-24T23:14Z,"thank you for this masterpiece
greetings from argentina"
,Bimarc,2011-02-02T19:25Z,"Great game, uploaded 2.5 gb"
,a1s,2011-02-28T02:33Z,"So, what about the patch?"
,a1s,2011-03-02T05:49Z,hm... you can apparently get that without a torrent. My bad.
,cuekr,2011-03-04T20:47Z,"Please answer someone. When I mount image, nothing happens. It seams that setup file is damaged... elnerico already reported the problem, but no one answered. "
,Varcalox,2011-08-09T10:45Z,"Very nice torrent, working 100 procent.

The game is okay.
I've played HoI2 for hundreds of hours and this game is slightly better, it is said.

I like the statistics thing and the improved AI.
However I dont like the fact that you can build the infrastructure to 200 procent, it often bugs itself."
,nz77788,2012-06-13T08:02Z,"Many thanks 'thenoobish' - works fine. Piece of cake to install. Awesome game, kind of like Risk "
