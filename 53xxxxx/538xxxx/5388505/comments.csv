,Esmad3,2010-06-07T12:08Z,"Very boring compared to the remake. Way to few ""crazy"" scenes, and good call by the remake-director to eliminate the military/biologist angle. It's tedious and gives the movie a documentary feel at times, resulting in the military being not the scary boogeymen they seem in the remake. Also all the military gear looks like it was from the 50's I guess since Nam was still going on new gear would be too expensive :P "
