Burnout 2: Point of Impact builds upon this strong speed-driven franchise with improved gameplay, new game options and bigger, better and more insane crashes. Players can test their nerves and skills by taking to the air, sliding through corners, and swerving to avoid head-on collisions, while filling their meter to unleash a burst of speed previously exclusive to airplanes. In addition to an offensive driving 101, Burnout 2 features a four-player crash mode, six different locations with 30 stages, realistic weather effects, and 14 cars (plus hidden ones). On the technical side, the game also offers Dolby Pro-Logic 2 sound and 480p progessive scan support.
