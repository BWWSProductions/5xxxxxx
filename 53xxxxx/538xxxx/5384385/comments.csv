Keep your torrent client open and keep the torrent you have downloaded running.

That's it bud"

,lilars26,2010-02-22T16:37Z,"Thank you 20-40.I must
apologize.I accidentally got into
initial seeding.I didn't know if I should
1)pause it 
2)delete it
3)turn down download speed to get 1:1 ratio
4)leave it alone
So I left it alone.I will be more careful
in the future.Any thoughts,if it should happen again."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-22T17:23Z,"@lilars: I hope that server didn't kick you out. On next download look if you can connect to me (receive traffic from me). If not, you've been banned and immediately find your IP number and post as the comment first two groups of numbers.

OK? Further, if you step in the minefield, step back and do not stand still. Bomb may go off anyhow... (unload the torrent and wait - pausing is like playing sitting duck and you may get tagged as ""uncorrectable or invalid peer"" who has some technical problems, cannot connect and must be tossed to make initial seeding possible). "

No,the server didn't kick me out. The download 
finished and now I'm seeding,but my action 
probably slowed you down some.If I have a problem with my next download I will do as you
suggest.If I find myself in the minefield again
I will jump out fast.
      Thank you."
