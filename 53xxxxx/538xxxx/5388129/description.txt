When a wealthy Rio socialite takes a poor lad away from the slums to be her boy-toy, the result, far from being a Cinderella story, is a tragedy. The story is based on a novel by Carlos Diegues and Antonio Pitanga. Director Antonio Pitanga co-wrote the novel, produced, directed, wrote the screenplay, and plays the lead in this well-received Brazilian film. This is AntÃ´nio PitangaÂ´s only movie as a director (although he also plays the main character). HeÂ´s known as one of the great actors of the Brazillian Cinema Novo, staring on films of Glauber Rocha, Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, Caca Diegues and others. His real name is actually AntÃ´nio Sampaio, but his role as a character named Pitanga in his first movie "Bahia de Todos os Santos" was so effective that he came to be known as Pitanga.
