We (Don't) Care was the first release by the indie rock band MGMT (at the time known as The Management). Newer versions of the tracks "Love Always Remains" and "Kids" were later released on MGMT's Cantora Records release Time to Pretend (EP) (2005) and additional versions of "Kids" appear on both their major-label debut Oracular Spectacular (2007-2008) and their demo album Climbing to New Lows (2005) recorded shorty after this EP.

The EP was recorded with friend and engineer Billy Bennett in Athens, GA at his father's plumbing office.


All songs written and composed by Andrew VanWyngarden and Ben Goldwasser.
