Got a question about subtitles though.
I'm not really familiar with m2ts files, but when a try to load a .srt file VLC stops playing the film. What format does the sub need to be?"
,L0xias,2010-12-14T10:58Z,"Ok. I've tried renaming the .srt file and give it the same name as the film. In VLC the entire film won't play anymore. However, when I play it with Media Play Classic it's runs fine, with subtitles."
