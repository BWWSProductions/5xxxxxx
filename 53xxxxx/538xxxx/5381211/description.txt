THIS SOUND PACK WORKS IN BOTH FSX AND ALSO FS9, L DOWNLOADED THIS TORRENT LAST YEAR BUT, IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN DLETED NOW, GOOD JOB I BACK UP ALL MY DWNLOADS!!! JUST RUN THE .EXE FILE TO THE DESKTOP THEN COPY THE SOUND FILE TO THE AIRCRAFT YOU WANT, MAKING SURE YOUVE DELETED THE PREVIUOS SOUND FILE!!

ENJOY!!!!
