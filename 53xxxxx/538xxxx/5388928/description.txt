A Gift from a Flower to a Garden is the fifth album from Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan, and marks the first double album of his career and one of the first box sets in rock music. It was released in the United States in December 1967 (Epic Records L2N 6071 (monaural) / B2N 171 (stereo)) and in the United Kingdom on April 16, 1968 (Pye Records NPL 20000 (monaural) / NSPL 20000 (stereo)). In December 1967, Epic Records also released each of the two records from A Gift from a Flower to a Garden as separate albums in the United States. The first record was released as Wear Your Love Like Heaven, and the second record was released as For Little Ones. This was done to allow budgeting for the double album package, which included a folder of the printed lyrics to the second disc with artwork, and a cover featuring an infrared photo of Donovan by Karl Ferris who was his and Jimi Hendrix's personal photographer (requiring six colour separations for printing, instead of the usual four separations). The back cover photo was also a shot taken by Ferris in LA during Donovan's and Karl's initiation into Transcendental Meditation, and depicted Donovan visiting with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
