[V],DVD-Uploader,2010-02-23T20:38Z,"how can you be so surtain to this is a vhs rip??, it say source dvd 5 /9 sĂĽ its a dvd screener ;)., gets the fact before you claim."
[V],DVD-Uploader,2010-02-23T22:50Z,"it maybe be a vhs screener, but if its so it has strange resolution and fault in the info, the info say: Source (DVD/DVDR 5,9)..................: SCR

But why do you even download it? if you write english you shudnt download it, because this is swesub. ;)."
[V],DVD-Uploader,2010-02-24T01:17Z,"but vhs dosent have this high resolution like this movie has 720x320, so let this be open ;), it looks like a dvdscreener, if we looks at the nfo and the picture is like dvdscreener,"
[V],DVD-Uploader,2010-02-24T01:18Z,"and i have noot say its a dvd rip, i have say its a dvd screener, like the nfo say and tells us."
[V],DVD-Uploader,2010-02-24T16:07Z,"we can both have fault, this can be a PPV scr, like this:

 Twilight.Saga.New.Moon.2009.WS.PPV.READNFO.XviD-SilentNinja 

It has the same size, so it maybe be a PPV scr instead to a vhs scr, maybe,"
,scrappylane,2010-02-26T12:39Z,"im shocked that even if theres a despute over the quality,that angel 40204 goes straight in for kill with abuse and attitude,no one has to spend there time uploading anything,you could go cinemas to see it,,lets not forget what this site really is and be greatfull you big spoilt baby???what the fucks your problem??its not like you just paid ÂŁ6 entry fee to the cinema,it sounds like it lol,un greatfull people"
