,halomoe,2010-05-10T14:58Z,"For some reason, the activation file lags my PC and my Pc doesn't let me access it. As in, its nothing got to do with my AV program. :("
,moah9998,2010-06-04T21:22Z,ok works but you have to put the activator in the avs path (C:/programs files(86x)/avs4you/avs video editor) then do the activator and it works! (i have windows 7 64x)

,Dvad-out,2010-07-13T17:35Z,The Activator doesn\'t work.  Says nothing in the file.  Did I miss something?  Thank you for the upload btw.
,squashme10,2010-08-23T23:37Z,The activator wont load at all from the folder just keep getting an error and avg reports its a virus a trojan horse back door virus it also slow your pc down alot when the folder is opened with the activator in it. can you post a serial number for everyone please . and start putting 1 in your torrents instead of viruses that slow your pc down 
,Damien74,2010-08-24T21:16Z,test
,Damien74,2010-08-24T21:18Z,squashme10 your antivirus app is messing up your putor. RobbingHood is a trusted user and I used lots of hes releases. Configure your antivirus or simply switch from Norton to a good one.
,cAnDySwAgG,2011-05-23T22:13Z,downloaded hellafast but 1 prob. no activator? in the folder there was only a .jpeg image file and installation notes semin00bish but a lil help?
,LloydChristmas,2011-11-01T19:12Z,This torrent works. I've been editing videos yesterday and today. Very good software. I may just buy the latest version myself.
,LloydChristmas,2011-11-01T19:14Z,"cAnDySwAgG, I'm almost certain your anti-virus software has either quarantined the activation file or simply deleted it."
