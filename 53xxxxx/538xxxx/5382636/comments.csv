,Bujaaa,2010-02-28T20:41Z,This movie is superior to any other made in human history. Quality of this rip is nothing special. I suggest waiting for a BR rip.
,Antimaden,2010-03-01T18:56Z,having serious problems with burning this download. I've tried it on a single layer ( compressed ) and a dual Layer as well. Both times an Error ( Toast/Mac OS 10.6.2 ) The quality ( as far as I saw it ;-) is brilliant !

,rudi_k,2010-03-02T09:09Z,"There is a fix posted some day's ago on UseNet !!
Torrent FIX van r.k. - Avatar 2009 - Torrent Fix - [1/7] - ""AVATAR_TORRENT_FIX_DVD9_RK
Posted in a.b.boneless!!
Only the VTS_01_1.VOB is slightly corrupted in the first 10min (1m22s, 6m13s, 6m47s, 9m29s)

Futhermore this is a great Torrent.
Nice picture and audio quality and a fine Retail Style Menu !!!!

(P.S. Meybe someone can make a torrent of this fix !!!
Please contact me if some additional info is requered !!)"
,greenfrog,2010-03-03T03:54Z,"bro, the glitch fix is crazy. asking me to create nzb's? wtf are nzb's. I've been sharing since aol3.0 server rooms and have never heard of that.?"
,rudi_k,2010-03-03T16:04Z,"@greenfrog
A nzb file !?. Try google !!
You can download movies from the internet via torrents or newsservers.
With newsservers you might want to use nzb-files which are about the same as a .torrent file !!
It includes all info to download. Nzb for UseNet and .torrent for torrent !

The fix which i have made  include a sfv file which will check this torrent post.
Also it includes Par2 files (QuickPar) which are quite common an the UseNet (newsservers).
These Par2 files check and can repair faulty downloaded files.
If you are not familiar to UseNet maybe one of your friends do !!
It is as easy torrent !!

Succes !"
,greenfrog,2010-03-04T21:50Z,im happy its so easy for you. why don't you take the 2 minutes you've implied it takes and make the torrent for us. I will seed it for 2 weeks. Promise. Thanks
,ohrton,2010-03-06T04:48Z,"Translation...

Additional Info:
============
This version was created by myself (ge-authored) in Retail Style "".
If you do not know better you'd think that the menu ""just"" really is.
It has a main menu, chapter menus 3 '(18chapters) and a settings menu (Subs on / off, Audio 2.0DD/5.1DD/DTS).
Of course there is background sound be added to complete the picture.

Further, the aspect ratio has improved a little bit and the subs are slightly better align broken!
Start and end are a little ""cleaner"" and the warnings have been changed in bmp!
Everything is now fully complete!

The version is almost identical to the DVD-5 version 2, however, the surround audio tracks have been added.
A few minor flaws (chapter navigation) in the menu are removed!
Further, the subs in the video log something else on top making them more readable!
There are 2 commandsequences been added so you can see which sub / audio setting is active.



See screenshot own ...
I've actually seen him, his amazing version.


Surround Sound:
================
The surround sound is created with a Dolby Pro Logic II (movie) what the original encoder 2.0DD upconvert to 6 channels.
Below are the levels adjusted slightly to slightly improve the surround experience.
All this is made into a multi 4608kbps wav format around 5GB!
Then this is used for Sony Sound Forge WAV Dolby Digital and DTS Master Audio Encoder Encoder!
The end result is very good even though it will never be ""real"" or DTS 5.1DD be discreet.
Yet I am sure most people this will sound like very well qualify.
Self I prefer the slightly softer since 5.1DD track handle and making the bass more beautiful.
The DTS is very tight and that may have preferred the DTS sound fanatics!?"

,superepicw1n,2010-03-19T10:56Z,this may sound very stupid but does this version have english audio? its just that quite a few downloaders appear not to speak english and im a little bit confused. answers very much appreciated. im downloading and will seed as much as possible.
,rudi_k,2010-03-19T16:37Z,"Yes it is English spoken and if Navi is spoken there are hard coded tekst in English !!

However, please continue with the FINAL version ;
Avatar /2009/Super-Special Edition/DVD9/DD2.0-DD5.1+DTS/FINAL

The FINAL version has a vts_01_1.vob which is being corrected since this torrents has a ""faulty"" vts_01_1.vob!!!

Do not delete the torrent data of this version.
Just stop it and contineu with the FINAL version since all data is identical. 
Only the vts_01_1.vob is diffirent and will be automatically corrected !!!"
,superepicw1n,2010-03-20T05:44Z,"thanks a lot, i started to download the final version and not this version after reading previous comments, should be done in a day or so, great movie."
,rudi_k,2010-03-22T22:09Z,"The fix has been removed by me since it was kind of complicated !?

The fun part is is that the FINAL version will automatically FIX it.

Just STOP this NLsub version and keep the DVD files .
Then START the FINAL version and the ""corrupted"" vts_01_1.vob will be fixed by downloading about 68mB !!

Just that easy !!!
Success !!!"
