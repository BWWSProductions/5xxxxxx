,Lum4r,2010-02-27T17:24Z,"142 seeders in 6 days?
Installs msa.exe which gives repeated popups about allowing adobe flashplayer to install. If you get this virus, just kill the suspect processes and clear your temp folder."

I'd skip this torrent.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5192645/Acronis_Backup__amp__Recovery_Workstation__Uni_v10.0.11345(__Murlok

is a known good torrent, see the uploader. (been using it since Murlok released it)

Now, if we could just get the updated version of this, with the Acronis Deduplication addon too :)"
,deputymarshall,2010-03-06T16:58Z,You are a real puke! This freakin torrent has a MAJOR tojan in it! You are a worthless piece of crap!
,sp3c1al1st,2010-03-19T17:30Z,"Lots of very, very bad things in this one.  Avoid."
,sp3c1al1st,2010-04-17T20:10Z,This torrent installs the Kryptik.DDR trojan as well the Olmarik.WE trojan.  You'll know you're infected when you see the black DOS boxes pop up during install.
,Ripper2006,2010-05-23T22:01Z,"Same problem as pelado123, cannot install Management Console, any one got a copy of 9.7.8398 that is fully working?

tsd6, the version you linked is for a Workstation and therefore will not work on a Server platform + v10 is buggy at best ;)"
