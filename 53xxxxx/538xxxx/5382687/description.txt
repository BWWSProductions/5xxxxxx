        |   This CD is the best, most complete utility CD for Acorn machines.  |
        |   It blows other shareware compilations out of the water. If it's    |
        |   PD or shareware it's on the CD. But only if it works and it's      |
        |   StrongARM checked. This CD will save you days of downloading.      |
        |   All of the software has been sorted into logical directories,      |
        |   ie 'databases' or 'program tools'.                                 |
        |                                                                      |
        |   Part of the Mega CD range. These CDs contain mainly Shareware.     |
        |   Both collections are fully Strong ARM checked. Unlike many other   |
        |   shareware CDs all programs can be run straight off the CD, thanks  |
        |   to our CoreFS filer. On many other CDs you have to unzip/dearchive |
        |   all the files first before you can run them from your harddrive.   |
