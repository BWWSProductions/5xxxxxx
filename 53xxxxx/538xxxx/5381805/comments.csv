,slip_out_kayz,2010-07-24T18:16Z,"its legit but don't bother

The compressing procedure damaged and corrupted the archives and files, 

so its not working

no other way around to install this

i guess we have to find another torrent or just BUY THE GAME  "
,SpeedKiller49,2010-07-30T00:04Z,dont uses my bit version -.- 
,SpeedKiller49,2010-07-30T00:14Z,Please help me i downloaded it and tried to start autorun or setup both say please check for 32bit or 64bit when u know ask the creator of game
,Oxyntas-Kovacs,2010-08-20T04:31Z,"Downloaded & tested (Not Working) .Well thanks anyway . Mr.Anonymous
I tried Drake_1997's method ,Copied the link he posted to IDM ,It's a Full ISO .The cool thing is you can resume the download any time due to the good server ,but Damn it took almost 2 days 2 finish. But i can tell you the 7.41 GB worth the download .The game works perfect , & If you want to play online with other players you just have to purchase the game because you're gonna need the CD-Key for that .
I think i said enough .Great thanks Drake_1997 .
Up yours Ubisoft .I love ""The Flying Tomato"" .
Important : IF the download stops at 99.99 & says something like can't connect to server or do you want to download from the begining . Don't panic just CLICK ""NO"" .then Resume ,it'll take a lil time to rebuild & shit ,meanwhile do something till it completes .       ""THE END"" ..."
,tristene,2010-08-26T10:59Z,hey @slip_out_kayz GO FUCK YOURSELF
,.7z,2010-10-31T15:02Z,"doesn't work for 64bit users, so don't download if that's you."
,AkA_Nomad,2010-11-18T21:48Z,what the fuck how did you compress that much O_O
,Moedervlekje,2010-12-01T12:46Z,".7z, I use 32bit vista home premium & I have the same problem as the others..

any way that the setup might be crooked but the other files not? So if someone just reuploaded the setup it would work

I'll try unzipping & mounting once again.."
,elturbo9077,2010-12-24T04:08Z,works perfect its compressed unrar its more than 7gb no prblems but has alot of bugs not becuase of the pc becuase of the game 
,urals,2011-01-22T20:31Z,when i press setup it only shows black little config screen.. like this http://www.bildites.lv/images/p4rjrcltf2rpaydanmfg.png
,Nideling,2011-02-12T13:26Z,doesn't work with my 64-bit version of windows 7 :( still its a good rar and a fun game i think...

,CantYouSee,2011-07-12T00:48Z,I think it wil not work because it's compressed he missing files or its damaged
,wlasto,2011-07-23T17:37Z,"Well i have Unrar/Mount but can't play it O.o if i press setup it only shows black little config screen thingy that opens for 1sec and closes down again, i try mount it nothing happens... so please post a ""How to Install""???"
