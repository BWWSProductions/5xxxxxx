Ubisoft brings you the freedom of the mountains with Shaun White Snowboarding for Windows Vista/XP. Developed in close collaboration with Olympic Gold Medalist Shaun White, Shaun White Snowboarding lets you create your own experience in the game. Whether you choose to compete and do tricks in the terrain park, or carve new paths in the back country, the choice is yours.

Gamers have their choice of four mountains -- Alaska, Park City, Europe (Alps), and Japan -- each offering a different kind of terrain and feel, as well as landscapes and views. Alaska, for example, has a lot of peak boarding with features such as avalanches and ice chasms. Park City, the famed resort in Utah, features buildings and layouts from the actual resort.

The mountains are huge, with incredible graphics that allow you to see dynamic elements up to 20 miles away. As you ski, objects and locations far away in the distance, such as the base of the mountain, become larger and larger, and the background has the feel of a real, live environment rather than a static image.

Within each mountain, there are peak, back country, and park (resort) areas that provide a variety of gameplay. Just as you would expect, there are plenty of trails on each mountain, with each slope rated from green circle (easy) to double black diamond (extremely difficult).
