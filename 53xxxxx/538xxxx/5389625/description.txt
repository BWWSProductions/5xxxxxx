 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Napoleon: Total War is the newest chapter in the critically acclaimed Total
 War series from The Creative Assembly. In a vividly detailed, war-torn world,
 players assume the role of Napoleon during his extraordinary rise to power or
 play as his enemies in an attempt to rewrite history. This epic RTS adventure
 follows NapoleonÃ†s devastating path of conquest and victory through nearly two
 decades of warfare from the early Italian campaign to the Battle of Waterloo.
 Napoleon: Total War also marks the single biggest innovation in the history of
 the franchise with an integrated multiplayer campaign that allows two players
 to fight for control of the campaign map and the fate of Europe.

 
 Install Notes
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1. Mount or Burn images
 2. Run Installer.exe (when it ask for SID file you have to select it on your
    dvd drive)
 3. Copy the content from crack dir on dvd1 to your install folder
 4. Have Fun!
 
 JFYI, the 'Preview build' tag in resourcessetup.bmp is obviously a product
 of a rushed mastering process by the publisher and is present on the original
 boxed retail disc which this release is based on.
