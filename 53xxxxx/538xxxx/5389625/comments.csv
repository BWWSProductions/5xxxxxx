,Mojito_619,2010-02-24T18:19Z,"Hi, when I'm installing the game, Steam asks me to activate the product before actually installing it on my hard drive, is there a way round this. It's the first time I DL a steam product, so excuse me if the solution is obvious. Would the installer.exe from Razor work? If so could someone kindly UL it, I and many others would be extremely grateful as it would avoid us reDL the Razor version of the game."

,isegal,2010-02-24T19:15Z,"extremezone: Tyvm!

iverieli: relax.
The number of seeders/leechers shown here is nothing near from accurate.
No one ever really knows for sure how many seeder a torrent currently has... its the way the protocol works.
And on top of that a ""seeder"" is someone that already has 100% - however, your client will start seeding as soon as you have acquired the first junk and still only show up as ""leecher""."
,NeoOhm,2010-02-24T20:33Z,"Anyone, plz upload installer :)
I got the steam game, but need installer.. or do i?"
,Xan1ty,2010-02-24T21:19Z,"Right
Ive downloaded the CLONEDVD version.
Seems okay, works n all but its installing through Steam and wants a CD key to activate the product, on steam.
Ive looked around and had a read, people are saying to install it with Pheonix.
Ive no idea what Phoenix is, some kind of custom installer Id imagine.. 
Anyway I googled some stuff, and even tried searching for Phoenix on torrents but I cant find anything, and theres no mention of Phoenix in any of the files ive downloaded either.
Anyone able to put me out of my misery, where do I get this 'Phoenix' from so I can install the game?"
,svadilfari,2010-02-24T21:20Z,downloading with 0.3 no wait! 0.4 kb/s ahahhaa
,Br0dY,2010-02-24T21:29Z,"Well, I for one will seed this one. And I think it should be self explanatory that you seed a game/move/whatever as soon as it's done. You don't have to seed ALL THE TIME, but at least give something back to these people. Fucking meatheads..."
,Xan1ty,2010-02-24T21:29Z,Thanks gona give it a try now
,Xan1ty,2010-02-24T21:37Z,"Damn that Phoenix looks a little more for the advanced user, and Im not exactly dumb with pcs. Yikes!
Has this Razor version got its own installer, or do I need to use Phoenix with that too? If not I think Il just download the Razor version instead.
Pheonix = headache :P"
,Br0dY,2010-02-24T21:42Z,"@Xan1ty
It says in the readme ""Run Installer.exe"" so I guess they have their own installer, just like they did with Empire - Total War I suppose. It's very user friendly, and should work.

I always trust Razor1911 products..."
,Br0dY,2010-02-24T21:44Z,"It most likely is mounted with Daemontoolz and in the DVD you should find Installer.exe. The only thing you have to monitor yourself is to change to the specified files when prompted, so... very easy :)"

,Xan1ty,2010-02-25T12:27Z,"I downloaded the Clone version like Ive said and was unable to get that to work, I did manage to install it, but when it installed, I just couldnt even find the .exe to launch the game lol.

I uninstalled that, and then redownloaded this Razor version overnight. Got it installed easy enough, but I had the same problem.
I went through all the folders where I installed it too, but there was no .exe to launch the game! So I wasnt 100% sure where to copy the crack too, so at first I put it in the main dir and put the data files in the data folder too.
Didnt work, I tried the .exe crack in a few of the folders, it just wont launch up.
It says this when I open the .exe crack

The program can't start because steam_api.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.

If this has anything to do with steam, steam IS running on my computer perfectly, it always is as I play other steam games so..

Cant seem to figure this out, lots of hassle and the best part is, I only actually wanted to try the game out. I already know I wont enjoy it all that much, these arent really my prefered type of games. I just wanted to give it a try and cant even figure out how to do that :( 

30GB of downloads for nothing so far :P doh lol good job im unlimited hehe"
,mantasLT,2010-02-25T13:24Z,"hi, if you downloaded game plz seed for others"

,Erocy,2010-02-25T14:38Z,"yap, same steam_api.dll problem here :("
,Br0dY,2010-02-25T15:33Z,"one solution to the .dll problem could be pretty easy to solve. try http://www.dll-files.com/ and see if you can find it there. I've had numerous .dll problems in the past and this page saved my life. just find out where to put the .dll file. in 98% of the cases it's in the win32 folder, but I could be wrong this time. good luck!"

,Havoc1002,2010-02-25T18:02Z,multiplayer is deffiantly out of the question with pirated steam games..? i am guessing from the silence.
,Xan1ty,2010-02-25T18:28Z,"No mate unfortunately not :( 
I had already done that, I got a good enough idea from what u said first. I think its installed properly, I just cant seem to load it so there must be something missing or I duno.

I went on the .dll site and got the steam_api.dll file, put it in the system32 folder and now its saying this

""The procedure entry point SteamUserStats could not be located in the dynamic link library steam_api.dll

Not sure what to do now lol kinda giving up

p.s
This wont be interfering with my steam account will it? As I dont want to be getting my account banned ive got games on there I paid for. Ill make another account if it does, let me know please"

,Xan1ty,2010-02-25T18:53Z,"It works now woohoo
I did the instructions above and I installed it to steam/steamapps/common/ and it works now. Dont know whether installing it to the steam folder would makea difference or not, but that is where it would go if you bought it through steam.... and well, mine works without steam even running :]
Thx all! "
,Xan1ty,2010-02-25T19:00Z,"Copy the .exe crack and the Data folder to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Napoleon Total War
Select yes to over right the folder data, it only effects the new files so its ok.
Thats all I did anyways, 

Before this I had problems installing King Arthur, it turned out I needed to have nVidia PhysX installed and Visual C+ Or something like that. IF nothing else works, be sure to try out these 2 software and try again with them installed. I think they may be a key part to this working.

Then I run this .exe file from Razor 1911 and then the game starts but keeps freezing in the opening screen. Nothing happens after that so I have to press ctr-alt-del. 

But now I aks myself if this .exe file is the only file you need to copy to the install folder or also the other files which are in that razor 1911 folder like. Because there is also a map named Data here and maybe I should also copy this map? Or do you only need to copy the .exe file?"

Then copy both the crack .exe file and the data files in the Razor 1911 folder on disk 1 to your installation dictory. Then you have to merge the data folder with the already excisting data folder and during this process you have to replace two files. After this it works!!

So do not only copy the crack but also the data folder in the razor 1911 folder!"

Put in .sid2 from disc 2 ( etc ) and does that 2 times again without progress, then it says its complete. and what do i find in my install map .. i find a shortcut.. nothing more.

 Anyone who bought Empire Total War will know that the people who made this game are the most low life pieces of shit that ever graced the video game making world. Empire went for 60 - $80 and after a year its still a broke beta with thousands of buyers crying out for some kind of fix to no avail. Don't take my word for it go to Total war forums. Instead of patches to correct a broken product they released DLC's with a handful of reskinned units to further milk their customer base.

sometimes the SID ask for a file and after a while again for the same file. Just do wat the installation program asks for.

About the game itself, it is really not my thing, rather boring, and to much strategion handling.
the game is well designed, the graphics are pretty good, but for freaks like me who prefer action, do not download, it takes such al long time to get the game, and I was rather dissapointed about it."

I unpacked and installed twice now. both times, when clicking the .exe file, i get this message:

steam_api.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error try installing again blabla...

after that I get a Windows window that tells me that Napoleon:total war has stopped working.

What am I to do? i re-unpacked and installed because the first time i unpacked everything in the same folder, now it's neatly in two but it makes no difference.

I used to play ETW from Razor on my system without a problem, and I can't remember any installation problems them

can someone help me out? 

thanx a lot!"
,rusky-22,2010-03-01T00:23Z,"If you actually follow the install instructions, this game works like a absolute charm, install takes about 20-30 mins though, but it works just seamlessly for me. All you have to do, Mount the images(both of them.) Then run the extract, when you get a message asking for the other files, just hit the ""..."" or Browse button, then find the virtual drive you mounted it on with that, select the file and let it do the work until prompted for another file, then just do the same thing until it finishes. Then once installation is finished, go to the first .iso find the folder ""razor 1911"" and extract to wherever you have installed the game. Then done.  


So i do have a question though, is there anyway of bypassing the steam issue for Local network, i would really like to do a LAN game with a few mates. Any idea's / Solutions :( ?"

,Rohan151,2010-03-01T15:31Z,"Alright guys, I had to register here just to help some of the people screaming about install problems. I had problems with it also, but here is what I did to get the game installed properly - 

1. Mount the first disc with Daemon Tools, and run the Razor installer.

2. It will ask for a specific SID file, but will default to some Windows folder to search for it. Browse to the disc mounted with Daemon Tools and it will be there in the base folder. Click ok.

3. After being prompted to do so, mount the second disc and do the same with the SID file it asks for. 

4. Once the install is complete, mount the first disc with Daemon again. Run the Phoenix tool (download at - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5161938/Phoenix_1.2_%28for_installing_Modern_Warfare_2_Steam_Version%29) and select Instruments > SID Unpacker. Choose that same SID file the installer first asked for. Tell the program to unpack the files from that same SID file first mentioned. 

5. Do the same with the second disc, and the second SID file.

6. Once done, mount the first disc yet again and browse to the Resources > Redist folder. Run the vcredist_x86-sp1.exe file, then go to the DirectX folder and run DXSETUP.exe.

7. Update your graphics card drivers. For Radeon cards, go to (http://www.amd.com/uk/Pages/AMDHomePage.aspx). For GeForce cards, go to (http://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-uk).

8. Go to the first disc and navigate to the Razor folder. Copy every file in there to your Napoleon - Total War folder and replace them all. 

Et voila! The game should now be unpacked properly, and with the DirectX, VisualBasic Redistributable and graphics card updates, you should experience no more problems such as black blocks, missing text and sounds, etc. I don't know why Razor have packed the game so badly but I never want to use their stupid installer ever again - I had to use the same method with their AvP distribution.

Now go forth and kill lots of people :)"

,Rohan151,2010-03-02T16:28Z,"Okay, it's obvious the people asking for LAN play have no clue how Steam works. You will have to wait for someone to develop a lan launcher for the game, and considering the complexity of this game's code and the fact that there never was one for Empire, you shouldn't be holding your breath. If you want multiplayer, you will have to buy the game.

There is almost a 0% chance of lan play being cracked at any point."

If you want to change the game language, look for 'setup.dat' in your language on torrent trackers once you d/ld this 800ko thing, delete the setup.dat on razor iso 1, place the new one and rebuild the iso with the new setup.dat inside, install the game.

once the game is installed delete the patch_en.pack, if you don't delete it, you'll have the sound in your language ( because of the new setup.dat ) but not the text.

I think I also renamed the patch.pack onto patch_fr.pack to have all texts in Napoleons language, french ;)

Here I go, the game is working fine, no more crash, everything in my language so i say you goodbye and a big thank you to the crackers and uploaders."

,TITIBUTI,2010-03-11T17:24Z,"Deal all,

I donÂ´t understand all the comments most of you wrote saying that the installer doesnÂ´t work, the game doesnÂ´t start, it freezes, etc.
IÂ´ve downloaded the game and just followed the instructions:
1) Mont the image with Magic Iso
2) Start the installer.exe (razor 1911 installer)
3) When the installer asks for the sid files just path to the image you have mounted and the file is there (everytime it ask (three times I think on disc one and two altogether).
4)When it finishes just mount again disc 1 and copy the files inside razor 1911 directory and past in the game directory
5)Finally execute the napoleon.exe file you have copied on previous step.
6) It will start and shows the logo and after 30 seconds to 1 minute it will start the game. It seems that itÂ´s frozen but be pacient and it will start.

This torrent and game have absolutly no problem. I installed it on Vista 32 and XP 32 and no problem. If you have any problem probably is because you nedd to update the direct x or the c++ redistributable or the physycs. All of them come with the torrent and you just need to go to the directory and execute the setup or just download them from the internet and run the setup files for each one.

My specs:
intel quad core duo q6600 2.40ghz
4GBS RAM
NVIDIA GFORCE 8800 GTS 512

Thanks razor 1911 team for thge excellent work as usual.

I hope this help all of you folkes. "

,MorningStorm,2010-03-14T12:16Z,"Guys, I've found a working fix, if you have the same problem as me and crashing at the napoleon logo.

First you install the game in any directory (say c:\\napoleon1) with the installer from Razor1911.
Now crack the game, just paste the content from 1911 into your map and press overwrite.

Now, install the game -anoter- time in c:\\napoleon2. But this time you do it with the pheonix installer (look above on how to install with pheonix)

Now, when you did this crack the pheonix installation like you did before.
After this cut-paste your pheonix installation onto your 1911 installation.

This will add any files pheonix and/or 1911 installers didnt add. And since the crashing at the logo means your missing files this will most likely do the trick.

It did for me anyhow, in my case eng_lang.pack or something was missing from pheonix, and something else was missing from the 1911 installer.

I hope it works!"

one or a few clicks 'try again' and the game goes on for a while.
it's playable, but only in window mode... :/

In the Razor1911 folder there is the .exe and a folder. 1st you need to copy the cracked .exe to the game directory. 2nd that folder with files in(in Razor1911) you need to replace each file to the game directory.
ex: F:\Razor1911\Data\campaigns\tut_napoleon there's a file called ""scripting.lua"" , you need to move that file to C:\(gamedirectory)\Data\campaings\tut_napoleon

I'm sorry if it's sound complicated because it's hard to explain. Hope you figure it out.

PS as LordDakier said it would be nice if we could update the game let alone get the DLCs. If any1 has a solution plz let us know :)"

,Obseve,2010-07-05T00:01Z,"Yes i got it working! People follow these steps:

1. First of all, download Phoenix installer. search on google or look at it in page 2 of these comments to download torrent. The Razor installer does not work for some. This is because it does not unpack all files, and so the game will no start as it misses files like steamapi.dll. If it works, good for you, but this is a tutorial with Phoenix.

2. Now download Deamon Tools, or Alcohol 120%, or whatever program that mounts images. I recommend Deamon. 
With the torrent finished, go to the file and mount the first image, called rzr-ntw-1 or something. Now do not start installer.exe, as that is the razor installer. Simply leave that for now. 
With the first mounted, create a new device in daemon, and mount the second image called rzr-ntw-2.

3. Open Phoenix installer. Now in the Instruments tab, click Update ContentDescriptionRecord-Internet. When thats done, click Instruments-SID Unpacker.

4. Click Scan a SIM-File. Choose there the file of the first image. There you will see various SIM files. choose the one called Napoleon total war_disk1.sim.

5. You will se that in the second window, there are various things now. You can now do two things. Either Select all, or select all of the first (exe,data, redist) and only the language of your choice.

6. Now click Unpack. Choose the directory and wait until it installs. WARNING, it may look like the install froze, or stop. But do not do anything, wait until the phoenix tells you the install ended.

6. You will notice that the installer asks you for various SIM files throughout the install. When it ask you for one, go through the files of either the first CD or the second, and find the one. It usually asks for 3, one in the 1st CD and two in the second.

7. When the install is finished, go to the directory you installed it in. Check that at least there is an exe file called napoleon. Now go to the files of the first CD, and go into the file called Razor. You will see one file called data, and the napoleon exe. Copy both.

8. Go back to the directory, and paste them there. You will be asked to overwrite somefiles. replace them all. 

Now it should work. If in the game things are wrong it is probably because of your directX, c++ or physics thing.

Do not use Steam installer or any of that bullcrap. enjoy."

Step 1. Download.
Step 2. Use Daemon (or whatever) to mount the disk 1 iso.
Step 3 = Step 2 of Razor instructions.
This is where the 'stops at first screen' problems occur.
Step 4. Manually copy each individual file from the DVD drive to its corresponding folder in your install folder. Don't just copy the folders.

It's really not that difficult.

And 'fquaresma': They're separate pieces of software you dipshit. If you've got any other recent game on your computer, it's almost certain you have them already. They're not included because most people aren't fucking retarded."

I do not really know much about this torrent, because I havenÃÂ´t download it yet.

Proberly this file is sepereted in 2 folders named DVD1 and DVD2.


Mount DVD1 with Daemon Tools (Recommanded). Remember, just because the icon on the folder/file is another than an ISO program, it could be an ISO associeted file. Like If an Ziped file is namned PanterTack.iso. It works to open with daemon tools.

1. Mount with Daemon Tools the folder/file. Check (If it is many files, ziped, choose the first one always) what one that is associeted with ISO. Then Run the Installer, this part is like any installer in any game (for the most, youÃÂ´ll get it anyway or youÃÂ´r a retard) Copy the content Crack dir  from DVD1 to the install folder.

Crack dir is the directory that the crack is in. Install folder is where you installed your file, often. C:/program/xxxxx

If you do not get it or it still errors, try a different torrent. Remember many things can happen between the torrents sources and when youve installed it! 

P.S Search on internet, there is proberly guides how to and so on..."

,Koekjeseter,2011-08-10T12:30Z,"_____INSTALL GUIDE_____WORKING_____

1. Download this torrent & Alcohol 120% (DO NOT CLOSE THIS PROGRAM DURING THE INSTALLATION)

2. Open Alcohol 120%, at the bottom of the program you choose underneath 'Virtual DVD/CD-ROM' your (J:). Rightclick (J:) and 'Mount Image'.

3. Locate the file you want to mount: open bittorrent, ÃÂµtorrent, Vuze... > Options > Preferences > Directories > here you see where your downloads save. Mount the image called 'RZR-NTW1'.

4. Go to 'My Computer' open the station (J:) and run 'Installer' (between icon and msvcr80.dll).

5. Click 'Install' > now it'll ask you to locate the path to the file, click the '...' at the right side, and go to: 'My computer' > (J:) station > doubleclick 'Napoleon Total War_disk1_0.sid' > OK.

6. W8 a couple of minutes while installing, open Alcohol 120%, at the bottom of the program you choose underneath 'Virtual DVD/CD-ROM' your (J:). Rightclick (J:) and 'Mount Image'. Mount the image called 'RZR-NTW2'.

7. Go back to the 'Razor1911 Installer', it'll ask you to locate the path to the file, click '...' at the right side, and go to 'My computer' > (J:) station > doubleclick 'Napoleon Total War_disk2_1.sid' > OK. 
8. Just keep locating the files when the installer asks you, there may follows 2 more files to locate I guess.
9. Congratz, the game is installed. Click 'OK', now a window will open, just close it.

10. Search where you saved the game; (IN MY CASE) C:\Program Files (x86)\Napoleon Total War (LEAVE THIS WINDOW OPEN)

11. Open Alcohol 120% and mount the first image again 'RZR-NTW1' > 'My computer' > open the (J:) station > open the map 'Razor1911' > Copy 'Data' and 'Napoleon.exe' > paste in C:\Program Files (x86)\Napoleon Total War (REPLACE THE EXISTING FILES)

12. DOUBLECLICK NAPOLEON.EXE AND PLAY!!!!!!


Please leave a comment so everyone knows this is the right installation!"
,Armafry,2011-08-13T14:37Z,if i run the installer exe it doesnt ask for the file and nothing happens except it sais game installed
,Banzay27,2011-08-20T15:53Z,"Installed and ran smoothly. No hitches whatsoever.
The game's content, however, is another matter. While this is better than Empire for being an upgraded version of it, mostly, Shogun 2 is indeed better. Though I do prefer the theme and timeline here. But even here the musket fire didn't have that _feel_ that it has on Shogun 2 and the impact it has in gameplay to make it so enjoyable. In Shogun 2 I could truly turn away charging melee units with a barrage of matchlock fire. Here, it never happened without the aid of cannons. And while cannons and miscellaneous artillery are good inclusions, you know they're much more powerful than in Shogun 2, they still miss far too much and have too small areas of effect to be much enjoyable, such is the case with the explosive rounds of the howitzers and the rockets. Feels like it goes beyond historically correct. Anyhow, even with the historical campaigns, the game is still just running on strategy. You can't expect any actual scripted events or much story telling. It's just conquest, diplomacy, managing cities, regions, armies and fleets. A lot of rinse and repeat. The AI is far too limited; for instance, I was France, Europe campaign, I was by far the most greatest power and had a dozen protectorates under my wing - when I wanted them to declare war on my enemies, I had to goddamn pay them! How stupid is that? Well they corrected that in Shogun 2, but it's only one flaw in many occasions. When you make an ally, or take a starting ally, breaking your alliance will ruin your diplomatic standing with every already existing nation for half of that campaign, which is the longest. It doesn't matter if it makes no historical sense, or common sense, at that. Simply the fact that we betray an ally mandates that all others gotta watch out. It's dumb and simplistic. This happened to me when I gave Great Britain England back - I couldn't make a protectorate out of them from Gibraltar, their last region at the time - so I could beat them there and make them my protectorate. I then gave then the Balearic Islands and took England back, obviously through force, a home region can't be bought. Well, my diplomatic record sunk to hell. The idea of exiling them to a few small islands as my vassals was amusing, playing as France, but the game is so lacking any awareness that that amusement quickly faded. Nations are just there and that's it. There is no subjectiveness, no opinion, scripted or otherwise, so the game feels too dead or mechanical for someone like I  to enjoy much.
If it's for strategy alone though, try it."

So to clarify...I have a brand spanking new pc with more than enough juice to run this game. Installed fine but freezes at main startup image.

Alot of people claim to get this going, but FAR MORE people are having issues. It's a waste of time, HDD space and data usage. Definatly deleting this crap and when data flips over, will be downloading a different one."
,hongichhan,2012-06-10T01:44Z,Good torrent !!! But how do i update this game (to Peninsula War) or use mod (unlock all factions mod) 
,00TuTu00,2012-06-10T07:43Z,"Hi, i don't know if anyone still replies to this post, but I'll try anyway...
When I try to play the game, I click the icon but nothing happens.
Also, when I run as administrator a file appears in the game directory called ""napoleon_1372_crash_2012_6_10T5_35_16C0.mdmp"" I believe the end is just concerning the date and time of the crash but i thoght it could give me some clue on what was causing the crash.
I would apperciate a lot any suggestions.
Thank you :)"
