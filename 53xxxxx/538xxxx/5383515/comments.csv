,Casowsky,2012-01-29T13:01Z,"Downloaded and installed fine, but I get a black screen upon opening that hangs and persists unless I use Ctrl+Alt+Del to open task manager. Tried running in compatibility mode as administrator but that didn't work either; I'm running Win7 64-bit, any ideas?

Thanks for the upload"

Figured it out... for me the game won't start properly with my second monitor connected. I switched it off through the Nvidia control panel, started the game and it worked, no need to physically disconnect the cable. Was also able to re-enable the monitor while the game was running with no problems, just in case anyone else had the same problem :D"
