It's not available anywhere.
Did you do it yourself or what ?
Thanks."
,gonzalo76,2010-02-23T14:25Z,"No log, no cue, no artwork... mmm, I guess this is a fan-made compilation. I wonder who did the remaster and why :("
,zappa100,2010-02-23T20:07Z,"This is the official remaster released as part of the Genesis Live 1973-2007 boxset remixed by Nick Davis,have a look on Amazon if you don`t believe me."
,Scott2112,2010-02-23T20:58Z,Thank You Very Much for the Music!
,miguel_n,2010-02-23T21:12Z,"Yes, zappa100 is right !

,gonzalo76,2010-02-23T23:16Z,"I was looking for ""The Way We Walk"" in Amazon, that's why I didn't find it and wrote my previous comment.

I'm sorry, I found it as Genesis Live 1973 2007 and you're correct, it's part of an 8CD+3DVD boxset.

Since this is ""Internet"", every torrent with no log and/or no cue looks suspicious to me, I apologized once again.

Thank you very kindly,
Gonzalo"
,zappa100,2010-02-24T18:43Z,"No probs gonzalo,will include log + cue in future torrents"
,domaric,2010-03-09T16:32Z,THANK YOU!!!! For all the genesis remasterd albums!!! I was wondering will you be uploading albums from the 1983-1998 box set???
,22man2,2010-10-30T18:38Z,"If you searched ""The Way We Walk"" on Amazon after the upload date of 2/22/2010, you should have been able to find this.  It's made in Japan, so it's more expensive, but it's on Amazon and it's been there for almost a year now."
