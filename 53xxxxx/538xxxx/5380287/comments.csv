If there is a fix for this that i missed please fill me. It will work if you use the backdoor ftp route but it wont access the client. I think its patched. Anyone who has installed this should change there ip. Thanks for the upload anyway. Keep on postin."

Furthermore, why are there two RAR files of the same thing?"
,CainUAC23,2010-07-30T02:30Z,they are identical... but one is 1MB bigger
