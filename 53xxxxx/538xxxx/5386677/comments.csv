,alienguy,2011-06-20T06:50Z,"All the songs are downloaded seperatly off limewire or some shit.. not the proper ripped albums, so useless if you want the legit copys. Some songs are really bad quality. Only download this if you desperatly need to hear these albums again, otherwise..."
,alienguy,2011-06-20T06:51Z,"Also, its REALLY messy. Songs are all over the place. Lazy titles. FUCK THIS just dont bother.."
