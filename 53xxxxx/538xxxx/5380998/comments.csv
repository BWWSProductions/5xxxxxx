,amiantos,2011-01-02T05:30Z,"Dang, in my list, I screwed up a little. I dunno why MZvsAOD #13 is at the top, put it somewhere else, I don't even know where that comes in really and the internet isn't much help. Also, 19 & 20 are the same, so fix that too."
,The_Wx13,2011-01-07T15:20Z,Very awesome thanks.

,JamJulLison,2012-06-02T07:26Z,"Marvel Zombies, Army of Darkness #13.cbr I believe leads up to Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness #1 of 5.cbr.  I just read it and that is what it seems like to me.  It leads up to the crossover. So your order appears to be correct.  "
,nasovic,2012-06-03T14:56Z,"(more accurate order found on comicvine)

marvel zombies vs army of darkness issues #0,#1,#2

marvel zombies - dead days

marvel zombies vs army of darkness #3, #4, #5

ultimate fantastic four #21 #22 #23

marvel zombies volume 1

ultimate fantastic four #30 #31 #32

marvel zombies volume 2

marvel zombes the return

marvel zombies volume 3

marvel zombies volume 4

deadpool - merc with a mouth (tie-in)

marvel zombies volume 5

marvel zombies supreme

NOTE- from 'vs army of darkness' to 'return' is one straight story

MZ volume 3 and 4 are on a seperate timeline (merc with a mouth ties into this story)

MZ volume 5 and supreme are seperate to the main story and involve different causes of the zombie virus compared to the the other marvel zombies books

Additionally if you have Evil Evolution put it in either after Dead Days or the last Vs Army Of Darkness chapter,

and Zombie Christmas Carol seem as if it can be read anytime."
