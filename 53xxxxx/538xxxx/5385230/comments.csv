,BoingBoomTschak,2010-02-23T12:52Z,I added a few more instructions on my torrent of AnyDVD that might help you bambong. You might have to add the Slysoft hosts to your HOSTS file to get it working. Let me know if that helped.
,topgun417,2010-02-23T17:27Z,"  Figured out the problem.  After using reg file,  you have to rename an extension to a file usually at C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\SlySoft\AnyDVD\AnyDVD.chk  just rename to bak or something."
