,ZirixZero,2010-03-07T23:02Z,"If you don't want an OEM, or can't burn one, don't get it. It contains more GBs."
,SirPhobos,2010-03-08T06:21Z,"This is just what I needed (I hate HP's ""customization""), but we need more people to seed and in turn, more people (including meh) will re-seed."
,redwalnut,2010-03-10T14:44Z,"which OEM is this bro?

,DijitalD,2010-03-15T01:41Z,"The title of the torrent should give you a hint.....""DELL"" OEM....duh"
,ZirixZero,2010-03-15T16:07Z,"@DijitalD

,ZirixZero,2010-03-23T20:27Z,"Every time I go to school, I leave my computer left on and seeding full speed. No one uses a computer during those times. You're welcome."
,redwalnut,2010-03-24T01:47Z,"alright guys,
moment of truth..

,ZirixZero,2010-03-24T21:10Z,"@redwalnut
Don't advertise on other torrents.. that's just plain rude, and you're just seeking to get a symbol on your torrents. And don't just bash into other torrents like this doing that. It's just not cool."
,joeltres,2010-03-25T02:31Z,time zone????
,ZirixZero,2010-03-25T11:39Z,"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Eastern Times only "
,redwalnut,2010-04-01T03:22Z,"@ZirixZero:
let me tell u something, it's not just about getting the symbols, it's always about getting the proper activation....

& the other thing i said about unlocking all 4 versions is a fact, try it urself & u'll thank me for that one!!

there's no point in getting furious over me just cuz i know few more things than u do..."

,ben02746,2010-04-26T05:09Z,is this rtm ive downloaded so many copy's that claim to be a real oem but there rtm and it wont accept the key on the side of an hp laptop
,osa1011,2010-05-13T02:05Z,So I assume this is dead since it only goes to 92.8% and I never connected to a seeder.
,mahendra26,2010-05-19T16:55Z,hello. please seed... the download has stuck at 92%. need it badly
,joesmoe66,2010-06-09T03:30Z,"This is exactly what I needed. I bought a Dell laptop on e-bay with the hard drive wiped and no restore disk for the op system, which was originally Win7 home premium. With this disk I am able to reload the factory op system on it any time I want."
,ZirixZero,2010-06-11T17:54Z,I'm not seeding this anymore. It's probably dead now.
,jojo_woodsy,2010-06-16T11:32Z,realy need this please seed!!
,ZirixZero,2010-07-03T07:04Z,I'm going to make another torrent of this. I will post a link in the description when I have done so.
,SzuruDusk,2010-07-22T15:12Z,Dunno how I'm going to get this onto my new computer. Is there anything I can store this on to transfer to it? That is a pretty big file size..
,howudoooin,2010-08-12T11:38Z,"Hey ZirixZero!

If I want to format my computer with an original version, is this the right download?

I got a CD key, but I dont got the Windows CD.
And does this version include a Norwegian languagepack?"
,adamwentzell,2010-11-01T17:59Z,Downloaded this for my computer I bought second hand that had the Windows 7 COA sticker but got no CD's after downloading so many other copies and they were all no good I thought I would give this one a try. Slow to down load at first but after about 2 hours the speed was fast. It took less then 12 hours to down load. I will leave another comment after I installed to let you guys know how it worked.
,adamwentzell,2010-11-02T00:38Z,Just got this installed and it works great with no problems using my OEM key code thanks. Well worth the download since Dell won't send you a new DVD and Microsoft won't since it is a OEM product. 
,crucknel,2010-12-19T20:04Z,Does this copy include data Safe local back up 2.0
,letaj777,2011-03-13T21:13Z,"Does not include Dell data safe, but it installed fine on Dell Inspirion Tower. Clean install after burning iso image to DL-DVD."
,rickydwalters,2011-05-20T08:19Z,"This works!!!! Thank you thank you thank you so much!!! :D I had a corrupt recovery partition, and of course stupid dell not providing a dvd. Users won a suit against HP for not providing OS disks with computers, too bad dell still doesn't. thankful for this."

,elliwyn,2011-08-07T07:08Z,"I have downloaded this twice. Both times I was unable to open the .zip because it was a corrupted archive. Useless. Utterly frakking useless. Nevertheless, trying a third time because I need it. Hope it works this time."
,jandeman10,2011-12-26T21:23Z,werkt perfect is ook nog legitiem heb hem zo van de hardeschijf geinsyaleerd en toen windows old van de c schijf verwijderd bedankt gr jan deman uit nl
,basilyok,2012-05-01T23:05Z,"So, how come when I do a clean install with this, it never asks me for my product key? And apparently it's already activated, although I never did it..."
,Tek28,2012-05-25T20:38Z,"Instead of burning (old tech), use a flash drive/external hdd. Prices are dirt cheap for 16gb flash drive and external drives are affordable. You can make a bootable Windows 7 usb installer or install Windows 7 straight to external drive for portable Windows."
,lauri1989,2012-06-23T14:52Z,"Does this OEM include Estonian language ?
Thanks!"
