,blamotoys2,2010-03-20T06:33Z,"you re welcome sirspamlost! I have to clean the dust from an old G3 266 just in case i want to play this stuff... but im glad about the people that still today appreciate the creativity inside these games. Some of them were downloaded from http://mac.the-underdogs.info/, the coolest site for this kinda stuff... but theyÂ´re offline now. Enjoy."

It has a superb collection of games (many within this torrent are there) for the old mac systems, and mac emulators"
