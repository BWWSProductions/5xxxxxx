[b]TVO Allan Gregg in Conversation, Jun 26, 2009: Joseph Heath on economic fallacies[/b]

The economy is on everyone's mind these days. But according to Joseph Heath, almost everything we think we know about the economy is wrong. In a new book, he challenges what he calls the "favourite economic fallacies" of both the political right and the left. It's called "Filthy Lucre: Economics for People Who Hate Capitalism".
