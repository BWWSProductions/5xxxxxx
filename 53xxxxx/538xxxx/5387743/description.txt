        Quiet Your Mind. They Can Hear You.

        Jason,  Lee  &  Alec  have  developed  the  next  step  in the
        communication  revolution: a  cellular chip  implanted in  the
        brain that allows telepathic calls between two contacts.  When
        the  largest cellular  corporation in  the country  passes on
        funding  the  research,  Lee  (Kathleen  Robertson  from  TV's
        Beverly Hills 90210) suggests  to her partners that  they take
        the next inevitable step: use the three existing prototypes on
        themselves. Things turn  deadly when the  side affect of  this
        experiment enable the three to read people's minds. Alec  then
        discovers that  he can  manipulate people's  actions to deadly
        effect. Jason  and Lee  fear this  unimaginable new  gift will
        make them  the next  targets in  Alec's terrifying powerhungry
        game.  But where  can they  run when  the hunter  knows every
        single move they make?
