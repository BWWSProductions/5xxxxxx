,2vsm,2010-02-23T20:23Z,"Thanks FXG Team... I love your work..

I think in DVDRips you guys are number 1...

One reason I preferred you guys was you kept the size within 700MB... though quality always comes first...

You guys have started uploading BDRips which is great.. The size is OK for such resolutions...

I stumbled upon this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5305273/The_Informant__2009_BRrip_720p_5.1_h264_avchd_mp4_-RipMinion

And the quality is mind-boggling awesome ... and the size... just 500MB... its TRUe 720p.. The ripper has given the method... I know you guys are great, if you can replicate the same for all your torrents, you guys will rule the torrent world..

Cheers to FXG Team !!!"

,jetpower,2010-03-09T18:27Z,"@clover323
There's no 1-click converter like this yet AFAIK.
First understand that MKV and AVI are containers for A/V streams. Think of them as boxes where you put video track and audio track.
To ""convert"" you take both video and audio stream out and put it into another container. 
Google MkvExtractGUI for the former and AviMuxGUI for the latter.

However I suspect that you need AVI for some device - then, most likely, it won't like these A/V codecs anyway so you'll have to TRANSCODE (google what that means if you don't know) to the codecs that your device accepts. This will obviously take usual time as every frame has to be recompressed.

,boxorats,2010-12-23T21:26Z,"@somedude.1001 -

I'm American and didn't go to see this in cinemas because, if I understand your comment correctly, I agree - the Iraq war was/is not a backdrop for soulful American soldiers to have a journey of self-discovery or whatever - it's terribly offensive to make a movie about American soldiers in Iraq and have the film be about the soldiers, not Iraq and Iraqis and the atrocities we Americans inflicted on their people, society, and culture. Basically the movie is a way for Americans to see themselves as the ""underdogs"" - even when they've invaded and occupied a previously peaceful country! It's perverted and ugly that this movie exists, really (although it is only one film, and just a symptom of the way Americans prefer to think about the world & themselves in general). The problem, of course, is that it also sounds like it might be an interesting film to watch, so for example even though I feel bad about it, I went looking for a copy online because I thought it might be a good/fun/interesting movie (""at least I won't be giving any money to the filmmakers if I steal it!""). If there is any point to me saying all of this besides trying to look like I'm not as purely evil as ""the other"" Americans, it's to illustrate that it is possible for an American to understand more than Americans generally feel like understanding; that means people can, in a practical as well as theoretical sense, expect a lot more of us as individuals than they usually seem to resign themselves to accepting. What I'm trying to say is, everyone should be _more_ angry at we Americans (me included; don't let the individual off the hook just because of some ingratiating words and because he's a human being too; he's a _bad_ human being for being part of America, even if we don't choose where we are born, because somebody IS responsible when Americans burn down cities and murder everyone)."
,boxorats,2010-12-23T21:27Z,"... Anyway, for these reasons I think Shakespeare in Love wasn't as irresponsible as this movie! (Actually I remember liking it, although that probably had a lot to do with Gwyneth Paltrow and how great she is to watch, even in the scenes where she has her clothes on...) But of course, as you suggest, both movies are a stupid American fantasy about how cultures or history that are fundamentally different than American culture are things Americans can understand without trying to know anything new, to make our lazy assumptions that everything is really the same as America make sense, even if only in a stupid Hollywood movie that has nothing to do with reality."

The movie probably does suck if the lady is suing everyone for downloading it.  She probably is frustrated that she hasn't made a dime yet!

Better than most torrents I've seen. As for the movie itself, this ain't CNN - comments about America's political system hardly matter on this site.

For those having issues, the latest version of VLC will play it just fine as long as your computer meets the minimum specs to play high-res movies. I don't got 'em off the top of my head but your system needs to be capable of running a high-def movie for it to work properly.

Yes, you can play Blu-Ray ripped movies straight from your hard-drive without a Blu-Ray player. Though as I stated above, don't use Windows Media Player, use VLC or something like it."
