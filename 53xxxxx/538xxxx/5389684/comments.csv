,kmanmarr,2010-03-29T12:21Z,"When i try to start a flight through AH, the FSX screen pops up and I get this message ""the requested file is corrupt or cant be found C:\Program files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Flights\AH""
Any ideas"
,rypson,2010-05-13T00:50Z,PLEASE AIR SHOW PILOT !!!! from Just Flight !! please...please.... 
,bigough,2010-12-26T08:13Z,"Downloading now.  If you can change it, I would recommend that you put either fsx or fs2004 in the title.  Most people only search those two key words, I only stumbled on it.  

Just to be clear, this is the update and this version does not work, or do not update because it causes the crack to not work?  Thanks."
,ShadowLuna,2011-01-17T14:04Z,"Well, from the looks of it, this program is compatible with both FS9 and FSX. And the update.. well, that will make the crack fail, so don't update is what I'm getting anyway."
,minisherl,2011-05-15T04:46Z,I don't usually comment but i wanted to say thanks. I really wanted this and it works perfectly. I am running it on windows vista 32bit with fsx. THANKS!!!

,Husky_65,2011-09-28T03:22Z,"One or more of the files are corrupt. Not able to write on DVD or CD, not able to install because of a CRC error. Please upload a new healthy torrent of this. Thank You."
