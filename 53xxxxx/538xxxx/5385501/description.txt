Jimmy Olsen, staff photographer of the Daily Planet, has always been Supermanâ€™s buddy but he usually plays second fiddle to the omnipotent Kryptonian. Until, that is, he develops his own selection of super powers and unveils himself to Metropolis as a new superhero - Mr Action. As his powers only manifest themselves when heâ€™s in danger, Olsen has to tread a fine line between power and danger, but can he really handle his new found powers? And can Superman train him to use them responsibly?
