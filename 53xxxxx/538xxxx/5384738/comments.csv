[V],RiddlerA,2010-02-22T16:13Z,"Hey 
Can Anybody Help Me 
I am trying to upload  a movie & i am repeatedly getting the message that torrent Already Exists in the system"
,Rod321,2010-02-25T04:02Z,"Download speed was 8/10. I tried to download DUPLICITY_2009_DVDRip_ENG_H264_AAC-MET & it was VERY slow (it had a lot of seeders but no speed) so I gave it a miss & went for this copy.
Visuals 9/10, Sound 9/10.
Converted & burnt with (Convert X to DVD4).
Thank you very much Riddler A, Seeders & Peers"
,Rod321,2010-02-25T04:17Z,P.S. The download file is in 2 files CD1 & CD2. Be sure to load both of them into ConvertX & it will convert them sequentially onto one DVD automatically.
,Lovejam,2010-03-02T09:47Z,"Uuh... why was this split into two files? The whole thing is less than 400mb and some of your other films i've downloaded were a single movie file. Don't get me wrong i love your work and greatly appreciate it but more like a request i'd love to see the movies in one file for convenience.
Thanks in advance for listening."
[V],RiddlerA,2010-03-02T14:57Z,"@ Lovejam 

Sometimes, the source of movie is in 2 CD format, which was the case in this movie

I try to avoid 2 cd format, but sometimes the good source is in that format "
,Lovejam,2010-03-03T00:15Z,"Thanks for your reply.
No problem.
Then keep up the great work.
Many thanks and blessings."
