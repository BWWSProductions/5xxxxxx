,sinshixxi,2010-02-24T01:58Z,wow 4 different torrents on same release?
,slitoke,2010-02-24T07:35Z,I cant seem to stealth patch this.........any expert might know what is wrong? Used both auto fix 2 & 3 but saids theres no known  Xex and patch failed but stealth is uncertain

M8 you must wait, this game is to early. There is no database of it get. Just because the game is released dont mean the ""database/Verified/abgx360"" is."
,slitoke,2010-02-24T15:52Z,"update: ok, i just wasted 2 verbatim dvd's and i need someones help! I burned many 360 games befor so im not new at this. I usually use abgx to stealth check n patch and then i burn it using img burn. I couldn't patch it under auto patch 3,2 or 1 so i decided just to burn it at 2X speed....my xbox couldn't read it so i check everything again...laybreak, outdated, etc etc so then i burned again assuming it was a bad burn....2nd cd didnt read on my xbox and i dont know if i should give up on this game.....does anyone   know if the 3or4 wave is causing the problem, i know im doing something wrong but i dont know what"
,jobreak,2010-02-24T15:53Z,merci pour ce torrent ;)
,slitoke,2010-02-24T15:55Z,"@Sunblock
oh, thanks...disregard my 2nd comment as it took somewaht 5 mins to write and didnt see your response. so i just have to wait ulti abx is updated then burn?"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-02-24T17:12Z,"@slitoke

1. If your console is not banned then Yes.

2. If your console is banned No.

Its up to you what you want. You can burn it when ever you like. But the risk geting banned is higer if dont wait for the game to be ""Verifieded""."
,traxstar7,2010-02-25T00:08Z,"Thanks, works great.
Wave 4 but I patched it to Wave 3, so i dont need the activation disc.
My 360 is already banned so...

This is the same as:

,slitoke,2010-02-25T22:53Z,"I cant get this to work....Im down 4 discs. I have IE 1.6 firmware, I burned an activate.iso, and then tried changing the 4th wave to 3rd using 360wavepatcher but none of them worked at all"
,traxstar7,2010-02-25T23:43Z,"Use IMGburn software to burn.
And DVD+DL Verbatim, those disc are better.

Dont know, what you are doing wrong, but it works for me.

I patched it to wave3.

,tyan76,2010-02-28T15:58Z,"I patched this to wave 3, but it want's to update in the start up. What could I do, I'm not going online with my box."
,forsberg_80,2010-02-28T16:58Z,I've got the same problem as Tyan76. Have wasted 3 dvd:s so far. Patched two of them to wave 3 but it won't install the update needed.
,traxstar7,2010-03-01T14:31Z,"You have to update the dashboard, I think you can do it by downloading the file from xbox.com.
Instead of going online and be banned."
,champ006,2010-03-02T22:49Z,people who are worried about ban.. why don't you get a second hard drive and set up a new account and use that hard drive for your downloaded games but don't go online. games you like for online play stop being cheap and go purchase the game and use your original gamer tag online. problem solved..
,champ006,2010-03-02T22:52Z,"Also for the guy patching the game to play. try the ppf - o matic patch with the 1.4-1.5. this is what i use for all my games cause i'm on a banned xbox360 with the 1.4 firmware. if it doesn't work redownload. maybe this game isn't region free too. some put region free then it's not. i got fifa 10 saying region free, then i got the message when i put the game into my xbox not being compatible or something.

,alexanders83,2010-03-10T11:16Z,"How long does it usually take for the game to get verified for ixtreme LT?

And what's the list on http://www.abgx.net/filename/?ch=6

there it says ""yes"" on ""stealth for ixtreme lt""?"
,Powerfool,2010-03-22T17:06Z,Just wanted to say this IS a good download.
,dynapacker,2010-05-01T23:25Z,"Does anyone have the same problem as I?
The circuit ""Billy Hatcher"" doesn´t work. The box just locks and I can´t do a thing. Every thing else works just fine. Checked it with abqx360 and used iburn360 to burn. Got it right the first time. But its still a problem with track no 2 since I can´t get passed it in Championship mode. Please help!
Thanks for the ul"
