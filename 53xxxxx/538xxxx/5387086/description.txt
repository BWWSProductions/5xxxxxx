Release Notes
Comments :
When Jess sets sail on a yacht with a group of friends, she cannot shake the
feeling that there is something wrong. Her suspicions are realized when the
yacht hits a storm and the group is forced to board a passing ocean liner to
get to safety, a ship Jess is convinced she's been on before. The ship appears
deserted, the clock on board has stopped, but they are not alone... Someone is
intent on hunting them down, one by one. And Jess unknowingly holds the key to
end the terror.
