Come with us on a wonderful journey... skip along a magical yellow brick road... visit a land peopled with Munchkins and Good Witches, winged monkeys and talking trees... There's only one place like it in the whole world... and waiting there are some dear and brave friends: A spirited Kansas farm girl, a spunky terrier, a tender-hearted Tin Woodsman, a resourceful Scarecrow and a timid Lion. Once again they're on an extraordinary, fun-filled search for their wise, wonderful, and occasionally inept leader, the Wizard of Oz.
