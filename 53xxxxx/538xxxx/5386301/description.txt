faktor & vektor is a collaboration project of dominator and trut, 
belgrade based computer+drums duo producing experimental music ranging
from drum and bass, jungle and techno all the way to abstract ambient.
it is founded in 2005 and to this date have no official releases,
although their music is already featured in some movies and tv series,
and also in public on various events ranging from dnb to abstract noize,
performed and remixed by phase, codex, dominator, kdes and kosmoplovci.

dominator is active in music scene since 1993, producing all kinds of
electronic music under various names. he is also  a wide known demoscene,
music and art activist, being the main person  behind corrosion and
kosmoplovci groups, involved in numerous projects  as music, video,
design and programming artist.

trut is best  known as being a long time collaborator with serbian
musician rambo  amadeus, following him and supporting with live drums
for most of his  carreer, starting back in 1988. he is a bit less known
for being a huge  music activist, especially supporting and spreading
jungle and  drum'n'bass scene starting from the early days, but also
having an open  ear for the experimental side of electronic music.
his drumming skills  are exceptional and he is widely respected as
being one of the best  serbian drummers (if not THE best...) but he is
also quite open-minded  and interested in collaborations that can bring
him to situations to  develop and create new sounds and ideas by merging
best of both analog  and digital worlds.
this was the point where dominator and trut met and  understood each other,
and started to make music together as faktor & vektor.

the name of the album 'dolaze teska vremena' means  'hard times are coming',
it is not a prophecy it is a fact. however, as  dark as it may be, the truth
will be ultimatelly be found by brave  warriors.
faktor & vektor are doing their part in the continuum.

this is faktor & vektor first public release.
