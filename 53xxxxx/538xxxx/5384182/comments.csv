,audi0cide,2011-06-29T23:14Z,(N00B ALERT) yeah... how do i seed? cause i really want to..
,audi0cide,2011-06-29T23:16Z,does it just mean downloading the torrent?
,tobiat,2011-08-15T10:51Z,bit rate?
,nothaz,2011-08-16T03:39Z,"After you download the torrent, and the files to your computer, you just leave the file on your bitTorrent or w/e program you use. That will let it seed.

The bitrate is not great, I will admit. A lot of this stuff is very hard to find, so bitrate doesn't matter cause you won't find better. As for the albums, it could be a lot better. =\ Maybe i'll update this torrent and get some nice 320kpbs for what I can. But for now, sorry!"
,tobiat,2011-08-16T17:36Z,"thanks anyway man, good job. let me know if you upload it with 320kbps albums :)"
