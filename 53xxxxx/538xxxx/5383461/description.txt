Includes the two bonus tracks at the end of the main program.

Decent tutorial, with a wide range of equipment and lighting setups for basic 1 to 3 light setup portraits.  Seems to be a mix of tutorial and equipment sales, but overall a nice video and a good trainer for someone looking to do some basic and good portraits.
