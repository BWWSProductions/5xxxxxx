,yeesnaw,2010-05-21T18:15Z,"Holy Shit, what a fucking mess you've made on itunes, i have to go through my whole library hunting down your shit all because you havn't labeled them correctly. next time (and i assume #1 and #3 will have the same problem) label them so i know what the fuck is going on.

Guys, don't download this, that's my advice, this is utter shit (not the music)."
,Assassinxkilla,2010-05-22T09:14Z,"unfortunately im not gonna go hunting for the exact mix of the song and name it correctly with the album and artist included, do you know how hard it was to track some of the songs down let alone get a high fucking quality version of it...names matter to a point but why don't you label everything yourself if your that OCD plus this was mainly to get the music out there, half these i bet you couldn't find without getting a virus yourself sooooo enjoy."

Dude, hands down you're a bad ass for this collection, gonna be downloading 1 & 3 after, keep it up bro!!!!

@yeesnaw

Quit bitching, simply put. He didn't have to go out his way to upload in the first place. I'm tired of ungrateful lazy ass fuckers like you who always whine about the smallest things, that takes hardly any effort to take care of...."

,ovn030,2010-12-06T17:29Z,thnx man great speed
,parona,2011-02-03T20:04Z,"Thnx! Fast download: I downloaded the whole 500 MB's in 10 minutes :-)

I read the remarks about the tracks not properly been labeled, but for me it's no problem. I mixed them all together for one of our danceparties, so no interest in labels ;-)
