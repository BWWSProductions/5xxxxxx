Numbers-obsessed Sarah "Saz" Paley (Bionic Woman's Michelle Ryan)
has just married her perfect man. Or so she thought. She believed
hunky doctor Dan (Krod Mandoon's Sean Maguire) was her Mister
Eleven--the eleventh man she'd slept with thus statistically her
perfect man--but he wasn't.

During their wedding reception Saz comes face-to-face with an old
flame (Britannia High's Adam Garcia) who informs her that when she
thought they'd drunkenly made love she'd actually just passed
out--meaning that Dan wasn't, mathematically speaking, the right
man for her.

An emotional rollercoaster ensues as she doubts her marriage and
lusts over Alex, the-man-that-could-have-been. Unsurprisingly, her
new husband is less than amused and their relationship soon breaks
down, leaving Saz with a tough decision--should she try to make
things work with Dan, or pursue her true Mister Eleven?

i haven't seen any group post a torrent for this
show, so i'm doing one.

this is my own recording and encode.
