thanks for this. There are not Audio Described movies out there!!
I would love to get a few more Audio Described movies. I have an 11 year old blind nephew I he loves movies. I can only convert .avi to MP3 for him so he only has the normal soundtrack. I am sure you realise how much more entertaining it is for him if I could get movies with the the Audio Described track on. Can you help me get some more?
any advice appreciated.
thanks
Michael"
