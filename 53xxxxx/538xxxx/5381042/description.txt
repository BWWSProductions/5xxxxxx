Enemy at the Gates [2001] [Audio Description script] (oan)

This isn't actually an audiobook..

Ripped a dvd and this was one of the audio tracks. I give it to a friend who is visually impaired.

And he thoroughly enjoyed it so I thought some of you might like it and see what you think of it.

Tell me what you think I might post some more you never know...
