,Blackwisdom,2010-02-23T18:26Z,"At last a full version off the game no more
shareware for me.Love it.
Thanks uploader."
,Kit_Styx,2010-05-05T10:11Z,"I am seeding it for now, but I am unable to get the game to work. Can you explain the installation process? Thanks!"
,Kit_Styx,2010-05-05T20:51Z,"I have figured it out, I needed to download a program like CloneCD that can burn .ISO files to a CD. I'll keep seeding!"
,Kit_Styx,2010-05-05T23:48Z,"Well I tried, but the game only gives me an error message. "
,EpicFishFingers,2010-05-20T08:56Z,"I burned it to a disc and everything, but when it comes to installing it. I pick my sound card and ""high speed PC"", and press enter, and it just closes.
If I try and open it without installing, Vista just says that it doesn't support full-screen games, and the message keeps appearing over and over, and the game does nothing :("
