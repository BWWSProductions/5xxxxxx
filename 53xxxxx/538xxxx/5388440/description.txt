NOTE: If you try to say there is a virus in here you obviously suffer from some sort of disorder that caused a defecit of higher brain function, and for that, i apologize for your affliction.Since you know...There's no executable files in here..just a .txt and some .asp which your computer wont know wtf to do with.

IF YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO WORK AN ASP don't even ask this is obviously not for you. You can however take a look inside by telling your pc to open them with a text editor.
