Rekevin music combines melancholic downtempo and tender acid jazz, played exceptionally live and supported by emotional vocals of charming singer Ksenia.

The debut album â€œA Peacockâ€ was released in January 2008, and the second album â€œNulukatukâ€ was released in March 2009. Musicians produced both of albums independently of any labels and companies. The band loves analogue sound and used unique instruments for recordings: Fender Rhodes, Hammond Organ, Minimoog, Theremin, composers Ritm-2 and Aelita, piano, double-bass and others. In addition a string quartette participated in record of some tracks.

Rekevin played on the Stereoleto festival in Saint-Petersburg in Juneâ€™08 with trip-hop legends Massive Attack. In Septemberâ€™08 they won the audience on Ukraine fest Jazz Koktebel, playing on one stage with Red Snapper. â€œEuropean sound quality supported with strikingly beautiful music. Itâ€™s hard to believe that they are from Moscow, but not from Bristolâ€.
