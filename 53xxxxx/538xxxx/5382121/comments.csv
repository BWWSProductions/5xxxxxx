Thanks for the Time Life Classics.  First time I've ever burned cd's from NRG files, but I have Nero so I gave it a try.  It took a while but the cd's came out fine. Nice sound on the Time Life discs.

,SKIPPY6,2010-03-15T23:01Z,Using Nero the NRG file only shows tracks 1 thru 22 after burning but no description of the singer or name of song. Can anyone advise.

I used nero to make a CD from the image, only track show no names of songs etc. then I used dBpoweramp CD Ripper and converted the songs to a folder there all the info of the CD is shown.
( dBpoweramp CD Ripper is part of dBpoweramp Music Converter )"
