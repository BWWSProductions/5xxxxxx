,DrJabo,2010-03-08T17:21Z,Nice work on the rips. It held up surprisingly well for a kinda silly kids Saturday morning show. Seems like it could have been more of a prime time showe if the dialog wasn't so ridiculous at points. Pretty good guest stars. The environmental/societal messages are still relevant today. An added plus is that the female asian star is quite fine.

Started thinking I was dreaming lol. Hopefully my 8 yr old'll get a charge out of it even tho 8 yr olds arent the same these days. The jet pack ruled!

Thank-you!"
