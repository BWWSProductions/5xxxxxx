NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
This time it's Valentines Day........Sources used are mentions repack xvid(thanks) and our own line audio.
Now the video was pretty nice as it was but thought the blue was a little strong and also also the...aswell as being
too colourful.....so fixed the colouring with RGB EQ and also increased the sharpness a touch.
Audio.....filtered and synced .

To pre warn ,not that it's anything major........our audio has some static which we clean 90% of  and also theres some
audio drops,that last less than a second each time,but theres not many.

Anyway enjoy this nice looking TS
