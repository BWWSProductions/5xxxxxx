Performed by The Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski. 

Leopold Strokowski's 1940 recordings with the Philadelphia Orchestra for the 
movie Fantasia were landmarks on several counts. Apart from attempting to bring 
classical ... Full Descriptionmusic to the masses in the theater, the 
soundtrack album -- which came out on LP in the 1950s -- was one of the earliest 
stereo recordings, featuring some of the most enjoyable high-fidelity sound of 
the period and boasting impeccable performances (even if the pieces were mostly 
re-edited and shortened). Apart from his reputation as a fiercely independent 
musical personality, Stokowski was also a showman with very few peers, and his 
careful yet extroverted performances of these pieces (including Stravinsky's 
"The Rite of Spring" and the summary of Beethoven's "Pastorale Symphony") introduced 
many listeners not blessed with classical music educations to these pieces for the 
first time. (As the film wasn't a success on its initial release, there weren't 
millions of such listeners, but at least many tens of thousands.) The performances 
on Fantasia retain their luster in the modern era, with sound clean enough that 
they do not need to be considered "historical" recordings. The recordings are also 
infinitely preferable to the mid-'80s attempt to re-score Fantasia with a modern 
orchestra and modern sound -- not only did the latter fall considerably short of 
what people expected, but the interpretations were flaccid and dull by comparison 
with the originals. ~ Bruce Eder
