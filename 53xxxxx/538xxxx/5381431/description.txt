The film begins with hassled college student Hee Jin (Nam Sang Mi) receiving a mysterious late night call from her younger sister So Jin (child actress Shim Eun Kyung, recently in â€œHansel and Gretelâ€), only to be told the next day that she has gone missing. After her newly religious mother (Kim Bo Yeon) proves unable or perhaps unwilling to help, she turns to the police for help, in particular to an embittered detective (television actor Ryu Seung Ryong) whose own daughter is dying from cancer. Hee Jinâ€™s investigation uncovers the bizarre suggestion that So Jin may have been demonically possessed, something which begins to seem increasingly possible as a number of neighbours connected to the missing girl commit suicide under strange circumstances.
