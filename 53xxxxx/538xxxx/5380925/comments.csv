Did you just crash land from Planet Stupid? It was filmed in a theater. Do you people have no idea how new movies get mysteriously posted on torrent sites? 
Don't take it personal you are about the tenth clueless comment about cams I have read in the last hour. We need a screening process for newbies!"

Don't bother this is a crappy CAM quality. Watched this at watch:full:movie:now . com (remove the "":"") instead

Halo Legends, My Name is Khan, Shutter Island, Wolfman, Avatar and many more new titles"
,Andozer,2010-02-26T10:49Z,"v-6
a-5 with some background noise(or this constants *wind* effect)

Download this ONLY if you don't care too much for quality, but really need to see the movie. I'm not going to watch this because of poor quality. I'd rather wait a little."
