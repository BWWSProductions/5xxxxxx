SEE Torrent files for Track Listings

Some quite hard to get Audio here let alone VIDEO!  Part 2 of a collection of 3.   I have spent quite a bit of time splitting these into tracks for Video Discotheque use.   If you prefer the original DVD Menu system (and there is no difference in the video quality I can assure you) the original Seed is up on the Pirate Bay called Remember the 70's.

Source DVD (VHS Tape quality)
Video 4:3 some black and White MPEG 2 tagged files
Audio 320 mp3

Enjoy the super fast original seed I can now give from a T1 fibre optic connection on the internet backbone http://www.zazeen.com
