,modestoman1980,2010-03-09T00:10Z,this not a good quality. on my 19 monitor it starts to get blocky. i hate to see it on my 42 inch tv. its great quality only if you keep it really small on play size
[T],jonnoel1,2010-03-09T02:13Z,"I dont know why your computer looks blocky...maybe your vid card sucks...heres a screen shot using VLC media player, taken from my 24"" monitor, and its not blocky at all. Its not Hi-def, but its a very good quality.

,Elekesi,2010-03-11T18:18Z,"Hmmm, the quality is good, but the film is far away from 6-7 Oscars!!!!Of course it have to be like this because it is an American propaganda-film..."
,iverieli,2010-03-17T13:59Z,"Elekesi, you're a bloody idiot.

Either that or another osama bin haji."
,jiggysiggy,2011-03-09T15:09Z,"warnung an alle deutschen nutzer!!! dieser torrent wird von der kriminellen abzocker-kanzlei ""waldorf und frommer"" ueberwacht. mit dem download dieses films riskiert ihr eine abmahnung von 1000 euro. ehrlich gesagt ist dieser film eh ziemlich kacke, er ist es jedenfalls nicht wert dafuer geld auszugeben. wenn ihr den film unbedingt haben wollt dann holt ihn euch bei einem one-klick-hoster, dann koennen euch zumindest die waldorf-frommer-hurensoehne nichts anhaben."
