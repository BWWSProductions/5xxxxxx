The full soundtrack from the game Cythera:

Composer: Randy Pringle

This soundtrack was, to my knowledge, never officially released by Ambrosia, which was a shame for those who were as hooked by it as I was. One of the most immersive, detailed RPG's out there - second only to Nethack in my book.

The music is strangely evocative, strange and atmospheric. Especially so, since it was all made with simple synthesisers.
