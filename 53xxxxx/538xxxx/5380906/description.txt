Searching For The Young Soul Rebels spoke to the world with a 
clarity and confidence that had rarely been experienced before 
(or since). For children of the 80s it was the initial introduction 
to Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, The Foundations all those ancient 
soul men.
 
It was the first time a generation came close to understanding the 
romance of singer Kevin Rowlands Irish precursor, Van Morrison.
 
It was (and is) an album to die for, with its crystal-bright horn 
sound and the way it spoke with words that left no room for doubters
on songs such as "There, There, My Dear" (a letter to wannabe hipsters
set to music), "Keep It" and the triumphant "Dance Stance". 

The albums Number One single "Geno"a shout-out to the UK 60s soul 
journeyman Geno Washington was pure inspiration. 

When Dexys appeared on Top Of The Pops to celebrate the songs ascent,
they were all Mod-sharpness and mirror-bright brass. 

SEARCHING FOR THE YOUNG SOUL REBELS captures the original eight-piece 
group infusing passionate self-belief into songs based on 60s mentors 
Geno Washington and Jimmy James. 

Rowlands expressive voice is perfectly matched by pumping horns and punchy
rhythms, But the intensity of their performance ensures the set never falls 
into pastiche. 

Each song bears the stamp of a manifesto, one that was largely Rowlands, 
a myopic vision that brought this line-up to an acrimonious, premature end. 

His commitment, however, ensured the lasting qualities of this album.
