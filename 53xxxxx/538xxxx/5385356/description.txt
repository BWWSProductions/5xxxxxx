Back in the summer of 1998, I was enrolled at the University of North Texas in their Radio Television and Film departmentâ€™s Masters program, Documentary Production tract. Having paid attention to the adult services advertised both in the Dallas Observer and the Fort Worth Weekly, I was curious how such blatant public displays of illegal behavior were accomplished. I thought it would make for a good production project for my class. I was aware of the ethical, logistical, and legal snares that would be encountered in covering such a subject (especially considering the necessary intimate proximity one would have to achieve in order to tell the story accurately.) I knew there were numerous lurid parts of the story that couldnâ€™t be told. But, I was becoming more and more interested in another genre: the mockumentary. Thatâ€™s where creativity and venality can run free.

So, ten years later, I approach my good friend Angela Gant, Phd. with a proposal: BackPage.

In March of 2008 we assembled thirty seven actors, twenty extras, a dozen support personnel, and met for week of insanity. Over the next twelve days, we shot for seven half-days, two golden-OT days, and three days of setup and strike. We utilized every format we could get our hands on: HDV, DVCAM, VHS, Hi8, MPG4, Camera Obscuraâ€¦

The resulting film exceeds my wildest dreams. The experience was life altering. I am so impressed with the friends and colleagues I know. Their camaraderie and creativity are an inspiration to me. I canâ€™t thank them enough.

So, look for our effort at various film festivals across the country over the next year.

Thank You,
