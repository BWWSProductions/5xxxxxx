Created by Rocks Team, this is a Windows XP x64 Professional version (64 bit) with SP2 which is updated upto Feb 2010. Note that Microsoft has not released SP3 for x64 version. But have no doubt - it's an absolutely wonderful Operating System. 

No Nlite!

We have not used Nlite to build this version. Normal Nlite based modified Windows might show some problems when updating/repairing a current windows setup or performing a RIS setup. Note that we have nothing against Nlite - its a great tool to have a customized windows installation. We don't hate Nlite. Its a great tool in the hands of a master. But most of the modified versions running around doesn't seem to the work of a master...Our aim was to create a regular version which is fairly stable with no flashy content like the other modified Windows running around. 

Size? OOPS!

So about RockStable - Though we got the final aim of having a pretty stable edition, it has just one problem - its huge size. You must already noted this - its almost twice as much as the other versions that you are likely to encounter. But we feel that our OS will be worth every bit.

It's Stable - not Freaking Fast

And one more thing guys, this edition is for those people who want a Rock Stable OS and not for those guys looking for a Freaking fast OS. 


Its Attended - not Unattended

This is not an unattended version. Rather this is a version which is attended and it can be used for repairing an existing Windows XP x64 (64 bit) installation or for RIS (Remote Installation Service). 

Purebred

This is a purebred version of Windows with only the critical updates integrated into it. Purebred? lol.. I am sounding like a Nazi.. Well I am not. No new versions of Windows Media Player, DirectX or any other stuff is present.  Though we thought of doing this, we had doubts that this might compromise the overall stability of the OS. 

Bugs?
Yes, if you say it that way.

Please be aware of the fact that there are some so called RockStable unattended versions running around with all sorts of shit integrated into them - we are not responsible if they crash on you.. lol..
