,Jedor,2010-04-05T02:19Z,So far so good. Only one annoyance. Even though I choose to install updates AFTER I've viewed them they are installed automatically. I'm bound to get some validation shit any second... Guess I'll have to turn updates off. Cheers!
,virdicyer,2010-04-09T19:24Z,So why isn't this integrated with the updated drivers iso I've seen around?  Then it'd really be updated since we wouldn't have to find and manually install it all.
,djfrancis,2010-10-09T16:12Z,Yes i can install XP now with my dell with the product at the back. Thanks for the upload :)
