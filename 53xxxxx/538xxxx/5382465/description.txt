BBC Sue Johnston's Shangri La HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Sue Johnston goes in search of her lifelong dream - the lost, fantasy world of Shangri La. Sue first came across the story in 1959 with the movie Lost Horizon, which was based on a book written by Englishman James Hilton. As a child she was fascinated by the Far East, but amid post-war austerity it seemed unattainable and as her career and family life took over the dream slipped away. Recently she recalled her longed-for Shangri La and decided it was time to find the inspiration for it. Sue's quest takes her through China's Yunnan province and into Tibet, over mountain passes and into valleys and gorges, through bustling towns and on horseback to the sacred mountain of Kawarkapo and the tiny, isolated village of Yipung - the basis for James Hilton's novel.
