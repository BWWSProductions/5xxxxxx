thank you very much !!!

really !

If you permit I would like to share with you some reflections, securing windows is a hard job, there are many tools for that, the majority are open source and the others like Symantec Endpoint Protection we get them from PB thanks to people like you, but i think that a closed source OS like windows is priority a in secure platform !!
what do you think about a OS like Openbsd with kde or gnome, for example from this link :

ps : i remember have seen a linux version of Symantec Endpoint Protection, what do you think about, i'm very interested about your answer, so be modest and answer please :):)
