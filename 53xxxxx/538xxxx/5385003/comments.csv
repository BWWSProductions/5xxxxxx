,Mavin,2010-02-22T23:10Z,Is this a continuation or a remake?
,soagg1,2010-02-23T03:09Z,It's a remake but this follows Manga very closely. Actually if you see this the story is quite different than the first series.
,siahVasch,2010-02-23T11:34Z,"thanks man, the quality was pretty, so was the sound n it completed pretty fast"

Hes doing us all a great kind, don't look it in the mouth."
,Madaz13b,2010-03-08T14:12Z,"Capt.klaa - lol if you botherd to read what i said did it sound like i was having a dig at soagg.... NO i was not i was just wondering why it was so slow lately, and before you jusmp next time maybe you should think that not everyone is a long time anime fan i am only fairly new to the scene, thank you for you information, now i know something new, and i do not look anything in the mouth i never complain about any of his work unlike some ungreatful ppl on this site.

,Remonalx,2010-03-17T16:34Z,Whats happening soagg? been waiting for some more  Naruto: Shippuden u haven't posted much lately and there's a bunch of new episodes that have been out for a while

,Dreadnote,2010-03-19T10:42Z,Good to know. Thanks man!
,ThePalindorme,2010-04-26T08:45Z,no seeds DAMM!!!
,DocEvil,2010-05-27T00:57Z,"Seeds are low, but damn, this is fucking great! The new story is VERY different, even in this first episode. New villians, twists to familiar plot (Hughes family is introduced differently, that kind of thing), and the quality of this upload is fantastic. If you're patient enough to suffer through the shitty seeders then download it!"
,Sarracenia,2011-03-18T16:40Z,"So, apparently there are no seeds, could you get these up again by any chance soagg?"
