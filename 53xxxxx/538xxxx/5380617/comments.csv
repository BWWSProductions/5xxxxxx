,fruityloop7,2010-04-20T03:53Z,"This film is the worst pile of shit I have ever seen.  It is populated with pretty people who must have been hired from a modeling agency who cant act their way out of a paper bag.  Its cringing how bad the actors are and the only reason they are on screen is cus they are pretty - and this is a film about truth and integrity in the media???

Its like a pretty cake with lovely icing and shit in the middle - dont waste your time downloading this, not even for ""free"""
