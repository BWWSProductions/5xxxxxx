VoMiT NOTES
Previous release used a watermarked dvd, the watermark is not from dvd authoring company but rather the vendor/shop. The bollywood market sadly watermarks the dvd's they sell due to piracy, Moserbaer being one of them

Previous source was film hence their rip went to 23,976 (02:17:17), ours went to 25 fps (02:11:11), hence the difference in playback speed and runtime, no scenes are skipped. We have included a sample from our dvd as well and also comparative samples

Note : Variable crop throughout the dvd, we did not overcrop.

Enjoy are non-watermarked retail dvd ;)
