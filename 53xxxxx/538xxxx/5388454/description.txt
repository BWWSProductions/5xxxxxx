Included in download is windows genuine check utility (first you need WGA plug-in, get it
from microsoft from a download that requires validation
for example: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=es&FamilyID=1d224714-e238-4e45-8668-5166114010ca
only install the plug-in) WG check utility lets you see if your copy is genuine
(if not, change key with "genuiniser.exe", double click it, enter a number
between 1 and 4500, then hit enter, click "OK", and hit another enter, and then recheck if itÂ´s genuine,
it should be)



I included some XP Themes (theyÂ´re actually skins), since UXTheme dll is already patched,
you DONÂ´T need to patch it

first copy .ttf files (theyÂ´re 4) to c:/windows/fonts
then copy the following folders to c:/windows/resources/themes
SevenGlass
SevenVG Black RTM
VistaVG Black
Zune MultiColor
you have to copy them to c:/windows/resources/themes
only copy them

then change appearance in DISPLAY PROPERTIES (Zune MultiColor skin has different colors!!!)
