Grafpedia provides a lot of content primarily for web designers. They have quite a few tutorials on building web layouts in Photoshop, as well as resources such as icons, vectors and Photoshop brushes. All source files and resources need a paid VIP account in order to download. The tutorials also require VIP access to download the source PSDs.
This pack includes all content as of February 10, 2010 6:50 EST. Here is a list of what is included for those who have not browsed their site:

Everything is dated as on the site. All tutorials have been included in PDF format and a preview JPEG showing the final result. For those tutorials that include extras such as free background textures or links to external images I have included them for convenience. All folders have folder.jpg thumbnails for easy identification.
