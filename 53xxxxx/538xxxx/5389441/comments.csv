The movie sounds so much better than it is... but is still entertaining enough for it's abstract composition.  Really does look like a 1987 movie or later rather than a 1977 movie.  That doesn't mean the special effects are very good, some are bad but all in all the movie does work.  in what way it works precisely I can't say, it isn't scary, it isn't funny, it isn't a drama or a romance.  A twisted fairy tale that does seem to have a huge dose of Evil Dead 2 in it.  Just a brighter, bubble gum Japanese super fun time Evil Dead.  See I make it sound better than it is.  I do think it is worth a second viewing."
