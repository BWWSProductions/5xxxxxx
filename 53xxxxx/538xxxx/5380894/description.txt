A monstrous 42 track, double CD collection, the album features K! legends such as Green Day, Marilyn Manson and Slipknot, key tracks from some of 2009's finest releases and the cream of the UK's emerging talent.

"Kerrang! has changed the lives of three generations of rock fans across the globe," says K! Editor Paul Brannigan "but we're not about to wallow in nostalgia. We believe that our world has never been more alive and we hope you'll find your new favourite band on this year's state-of-the-nation address."
