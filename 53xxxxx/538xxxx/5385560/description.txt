Antunes Filho's Em Compasso de Espera is a film which promotes the idea of race equality by means of showing various struggles that the main hero has to go through. Black self awareness in Brazil triggered social conflicts that were a large part of the countryâ€™s history. The film director wants to illustrate some of those conflicts through the prism of his characters. 

Compasso de Espera focuses on a black poet and advertising agent named Jorge de Oliveira (played by ZÃ³zimo Bulbul, who also collaborated on the script). Jorge publishes books of poetry - Compasso de Espera is the title of one of his collections - with the help of his sponsor, a childless white millionaire (an allusion to the Brazilian institution of the padrinho, the patron "godfather"). The impeccably dressed, dignified, articulate Jorge at first glance resembles a number of Sidney Poitier characters, but he lacks the moral stature of the Poitier persona. 

Romantically involved with an older white woman (Emma), Jorge feels sorry for her, but also resents his financial dependence on her. (Jorge's professional prestige is "traded," as it were, for Emma's real wealth and for the cultural capital of her whiteness.) Emma's relatives suggest that the couple not appear too much in public, so as to avoid "talk." Jorge's subsequent infatuation with the upper-class Cristina (Renee de Vilmond) leads to confrontations first with Emma and then with Cristina's family. When Cristina's parents encounter the couple in a restaurant, the mother sneeringly tells her daughter: "I never thought you would stoop so low."
