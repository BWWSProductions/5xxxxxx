,tooticki,2010-06-14T16:02Z,"I tend to agree...

If you haven't seen the very first series with Rolf Lassgì±…rd as Wallander though, you should try to get those movies. They are very good. The later swedish movies with Krister Henriksson are just mass-produced crap, but are fun to watch nevertheless, at least the earlier ones!

P.S. I am swedish so I have a right to say the above. ;-)"
