"In the near future.

In a not so distant place.

There exists a society where law is based upon deterrence and criminals are assigned "obligations" fitting for their crimes.

Within this society, a man named Morita Kenichi aspires to the position of Special High Class Individual, one who holds authority over said criminals.

For the purpose of fulfilling his ambition, Kenichi returns to the town he once called home. There he will encounter three girls bearing "obligations" and there he will encounter the past he left behind.

Won't you join him in this story about how people relate to their society?

In this story about how a society relates to its people.

In this story about the girl amid the sunflowers growing in the country spinning like a wheel."
