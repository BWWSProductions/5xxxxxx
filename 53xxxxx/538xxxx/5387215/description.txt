        Mary Steenburgen and Roddy  McDowall star in a  pulse-pounding
        thriller in the tradition of the legendary master of suspense,
        Alfred Hitchcock. "You'll  find yourself on  the edge of  your
        seat" with this bone-chilling tale of deception, blackmail and
        murder in which no one is who they seem to be and any  mistake
        could be your last.

        When actress  Katie McGovern  (Steenburgen) is  summoned to an
        isolated  estate  for  a  screen  test,  she  finds  that  her
        mysterious hosts, Mr. Murray  (McDowall) and Dr. Joseph  Lewis
        (Jan Rubes), have plans for  her'that have nothing to do  with
        acting! And when  the deadly money-making  scheme erupts in  a
        firestorm  of  double-crosses and  cold-blooded  murder, Katie
        realizes she has  only one chance  at survival: She  must turn
        the tables  on her  enemies by  giving the  performance of her
        life!
