I'll trust you after the download it done man, its nothing against you ;)

,Ikuve,2010-02-24T05:57Z,"The subs are missing the letter ""o"". Need fixed."
,Ikuve,2010-02-24T06:06Z,"My mistake. The problem with the subs is that everywhere that there is an ""o"", there's an ""r"" instead. I guess it could be manually changed."
