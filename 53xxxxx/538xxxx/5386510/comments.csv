,mrpunk50,2010-04-09T00:49Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I'm having problems with the crack.

After replacing the program's original files, as per instructions, I get this everytime I try to use the program:

""WARNING: Your copy of Bulk Image Downloader is corrupt!

This may indicate the presence of a virus, trojan or other malware on your PC.

You are strongly advised to update your antivirus definitions and perform a full system scan.""



I can click ""yes"" or ""no"", but either way the program wont run. Any ideas on how to resolve this?

thanks,
SR"
,stillnotcoolenough,2010-05-09T23:08Z,i wish their was a newer version of this on TPB
,kingjames100,2010-05-16T02:13Z,"You have to make sure you're not connected to the internet when you install this. 

After you've copied the crack, start the program and select 'Configuration' and you'll see an option to automatically check for updates. Make sure that option is not selected (unchecked) and then save. 

Hope this helps those who were having trouble."
,ava2009,2010-05-16T22:15Z,"some one help, the same problem, the version wont work!!!"
,drtofuu,2010-08-22T01:35Z,"yup, this does not work anymore... I mean, i guess it would work if i wont let the program connecto to the internet to update itself, but that way, images cannot be downloaded either..."
,mrpunk50,2010-09-10T02:17Z,"Thanks to kingjames100 for the reply! Ive been using the program for a few days now without any error messages.

As kingjames100 stated: you need to disconnect from the internet, install the program, install the crack, then open the program and configure it to NOT update itself. Then you can reconnect to the internet and you're good to go.

One more thing: I downloaded the firefox plug-in and found that it wouldn't work with this cracked copy of the software. So you need to paste the url into the program. If you are downloading from a site that requires a login (e.g. a private forum), use firefox to save the relevent page as (you can select ""html only""), then in Bulk Image Downloader select ""load from file"". Sounds like a drag, but it takes a few seconds."
,MagikLair,2011-09-05T05:59Z,"still works good if you follow the instructions listed.  Thanks for the download!

Brian"
,MrMikaLee,2011-09-19T21:19Z,"works like a dream!
It's going to save me lots of time on the web!
Found kingjames100 advice really useful , since i had the same prob as mrpunk50.

Thanks leomahesh"
,Bevappha,2011-09-20T20:11Z,"Worked For Me. Its Simple. After downloading  first disable your internet connection. Now install. Keep remember unchecked all option of creating shortcut on desktop Next go to bulk image downloader folder and delete BID.exe and BIDQueueManager.exe. Now copy the same .exe file from crack and paste there. Now open BID. Find under URL bar configuration button. Go inside and unchecked automatic update option. 

Please upload crack for latest version of Bulk Image Downloader. Please Please Please.

Many many thanks for this torrent."

,coma73,2011-10-27T17:59Z,"iave downloaded thsi a bunch of times from different torrents, followed directions to the letter. only alows one usage. anyone saying it works is probably posting after one use only. can anyone confirm theyve used it twice?"
,Exotic888,2012-04-13T07:44Z,"can someone please provide serial number(s)?
i no longer use keygens..

the last time i did, it gave me ""hacktool.lte"" and was forced to clean install of everything"
,cladiel,2012-05-30T11:58Z,"@ coma73:

You're right. It doesn't work anymore. After restarting, it says the ""file is corrupt"". Too bad, it's been useful software."
