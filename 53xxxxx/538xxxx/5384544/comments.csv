,lost45,2010-03-12T04:28Z,"Regarding him making torrents: ""Well releases are halted until I find new gainful employment. Many people were let go today in my company. I worked there for a long time. I have some good leads already, but of course they want a resume, which I haven't kept up to date in eons... opps. Lots of times loosing a job doesn't have anything to do with your skill set, your person, its just numbers. My co-workers also bye bye."""
