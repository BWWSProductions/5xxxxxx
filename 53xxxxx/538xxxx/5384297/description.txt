Ghostly Houseguest

The Gibbons family, in Seattle, WA, ask TAPS to investigate their home. The whole family has been having seemingly paranormal experiences ever since their orphaned niece has come to live with them. The family wants to find out what is going on, and whether the ghostly presence might be the girl's lost mother trying to make contact. While in Seattle, the team decide to go to the Moore Theater, a place that has been considered haunted by employees for years.
