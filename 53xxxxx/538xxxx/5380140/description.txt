Straight Lines - Straight Lines

Debut album from a Vancouver-based band that later had a big hit with the ballad "Letting Go".

"Heads are Gonna Roll" is probably the best-known track from this album, and is probably the best song on here as well, even though nearly every track is solid.

The sound is very remeniscent of Little River Band.
