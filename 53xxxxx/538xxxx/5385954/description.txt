Black Widow were a rock band that formed in Leicester, England in September 1969. The band were mostly known for its early use of satanic and occult imagery in their music and stage act. The band were often confused with the better-known heavy metal band Black Sabbath, but the bands were only superficially similar.

This album was recorded in 1969, but it was released only in 1998. It contains the original versions of material that would be re-recorded and released as the band's debut album Sacrifice (1970). The group is usually compared to Black Sabbath mostly because of early use of satanic and occult imagery, but musically they sound more like late 60s Hard Rock with strong progressive influences and male/female vocals (playing sax, flutes, organ, percussion and others). Kay Garrett was one of the original vocalist who left the group before to the recording of Sacrifice (all official albums have male vocals only).
