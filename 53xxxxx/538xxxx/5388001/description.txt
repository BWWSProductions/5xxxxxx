About the Actor: Ben Bolt was playing lead guitar in rock bands at the age of 12 and performed professionally at 16 in Miami. After high school, Ben left his band to study classical guitar in Spain. At the age of 19, he studied with Andres Segovia in Madrid. AndrÃ©s Segovia, the father of the classical guitar, said, "Ben Bolt is an excellent guitarist with fine tone." Segovia personally paid for a scholarship so that Bolt could continue his studies at the Musica en Compostela, which Segovia founded. Later in Paris, Ben Bolt sought out and studied with Abel Carlevaro, one of Segovia's students, who continued to teach Bolt in Brazil at the International Guitar Conservatory. There, under full scholarship, Bolt was introduced to more Segovia information and, equally importantly, to the Carlevaro school of technique. During the next several years he went on to Montevideo, Carlevaro's home town, and complete his music studies under the direction of Maestro Carlevaro and Guido Santorsola, the distinguished Italian composer and conductor. Carlevaro invited him to attend the 1974 International Guitar Seminary in Brazil under full scholarship. In that same year Ben won the coveted Merit Prize as Outstanding Student at the First International Masters Class in Montevideo, Uruguay.
