

Alive Task Manager is a unique electronic task manager allowing you to schedule various tasks and control how they are fulfilled. Using Alive Task Manager does not come down to keeping the record of things to do. It also allows you to generate and view your personal schedule, remind you about various events in advance, create repeated tasks, set rules for moving tasks, etc.

Alive Task Manager lets you arrange the entire list of tasks in the form of folders by topics (a tree of folders as in Windows Explorer). You can create various folders (for example, business, personal events, employees, etc.) and to place the corresponding tasks in them. A special folder will allow you to display a list of all the events you have created, which is really convenient for searching and viewing.

Each record in Alive Task Manager contains various fields grouped by tabs in a smart and convenient way. The Export/Import features implemented in Alive Task Manager will make it much easier to move data, while those users who have to work on several computers (for instance, on a laptop and on a desktop) are sure to appreciate the Synchronization feature.
