Cheers for the upload matey.

But it looks like your upping in superseed mode, which means everybody waits a lot longer before cascade speeds everything up.

Seed conventionally and more will finish faster and add to your seeding and increase swarm speeds overall much faster.

As it is, 4 hours for under 400Mb and peers are %31 and under, while FCW upped at 17:48GMtT and 2 hours before you, is nearly at peer cascade and adding plenty of seeds, about another few mins from this comments time stamp and it'll be at full kilter swarm speeds.

Scotch that, just looked and top peers are going into seed now.

Difference between superseed and conventional.

Appreciate your upping for us though matey.

Peace. :)

In another torrent site, there was something about copyright ._."
,fabiomoron,2010-02-24T21:01Z,"""Sorry, the Copyright/Trademark owner has requested to filter these results. ""


That happened in the New Torrents... hope i'm wrong ._."
,t.shingen,2010-02-25T01:33Z,"Well, ladies and germs, I found someone who did a not-so-nice thing. They took the file from this torrent, put the URL for another site on it, and started another torrent on another site. Bit for bit it's identical to this torrent. So, time for this torrent to kick it into high gear and go beyond 30%"
,t.shingen,2010-02-25T01:36Z,Sadly my upload is quite poor... but the seed to leech ratio will get better as I'll be leaving this overnight
,TheAnt317,2010-02-25T02:45Z,"Well I don't want to spoil anything too major about this episode, but I hate Cole so much. He's such a terrible, idiot announcer and in NXT he's even WORSE by trying to play a 'heel.' What a jackoff."
,t.shingen,2010-02-25T02:48Z,"Really? He's trying to be a heel? I'm sorry, but I've been tuning Cole out for months."
,afgaviria,2010-03-03T06:08Z,i like michael cole cuz is he know that his caracter is annoying and he keeps doing even further!!
