This is a copy of Fable-The Lost Chapters. I have taken the original four disc game and made it into a single iso to remove the hassle of mounting and unmounting many images. This torrent includes Fable, a serial, and a NoCD crack. This is my first upload so i hope you enjoy.

Minimum System Requirements:

* One of the following Windows XP operating systems:
o Windows XP Home Edition
o Windows XP Professional
o Windows XP Media Center Edition
* A computer that has a 1.4 gigahertz (GHz) equivalent or a later version processor.
* Microsoft DirectX 9.0 or a later version of Microsoft DirectX. Microsoft DirectX 9.0c is installed by Fable: The Lost Chapters.
* 256 megabytes (MB) of system RAM.
* 3 gigabytes (GB) of available hard disk space.
* 32x speed or faster CD-ROM drive.
* 64 MB shader-capable video card.
* A sound card and either a set of speakers or a set of headphones are required for audio.
* A Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device.

1. Mount "FableSingleCD.iso" with your favorite
disc-mounting software, and run "setup.exe" off the disc.

2. Use the serial provided in the "serial.txt" file.

3. Run through setup untill it is fully installed, making sure not to select launch fable now.

4. Copy "Fable.exe" from the "CRACK AND SERIAL" folder to the folder where you installed Fable (usually "C:Program FilesMicrosoft GamesFable - The Lost Chapters"), overwriting the original file.

5. Enjoy!
