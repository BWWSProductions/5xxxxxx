Also I would like to here whether you liked or disliked the torrent, and whether there were any problems or not.

Thanks, Chrisman14"
,dsafjaly69,2010-02-25T15:42Z,Seeders?? Please. The torrents up for two days and its dead already???
,Chrisman14,2010-02-26T23:02Z,"Sorry about the loss of seeders, had to send my computer off to toshiba because the screen had stopped working. Will begin seeding again."
,oblegod,2010-03-04T14:03Z,"i havent actually downloaded this yet, but my torrent downloader says the download is only the .ISO O.o"
,Chrisman14,2010-03-05T13:31Z,"This is not supposed to sound mean. If you would have looked in the description, it clearly says under the installation section that there is a folder inside the .iso called CRACK AND SERIAL, which contains the serial and crack. So yes your P2P application will only show the .iso. I hope this helps.

,Paradox666,2010-05-04T07:49Z,"when I first started dling this my anti virus said I had some malware. Hope this is clean. Will continue and hope you haven't fucked my computer.

Thanks for the upload. I've only played a bit of the 2nd fable and I enjoyed it. Hope this is really good as I'm losing all hope in Final Fantasy now a days to provide me with entertainment."
,Paradox666,2010-05-04T20:56Z,"I've finished and this works great, thank you.

For anyone that can't find the serial and crack. When you first mount the iso using daemon tools, power iso, whater iso mounting device you have. When the auto play comes up, click on *open folder to view files* 

There you should find a folder that says serial and crack.

Enjoy"
