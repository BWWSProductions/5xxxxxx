What are you? A retard or something?? This episode was not bad at all. It wasn't the best but it was very very amusing. 

You can go back to your stupid shows like ""Big Brother"" and ""Paradise Hotel"" if you don't like intelligent shows.

When Lisa went on the attic, there were reference to like 300 or so earlier episodes in the background... The ending was also surprising. The story was interesting and well told. You must be some sort of retard or something.. calling this worst episode ever... well.. there are idiots all over the place.. I mean, even Sarah Palin has followers...

I give this episode 7/10
Audio: 10
Videoquality: 10"

,TDG,2010-02-24T07:14Z,"Lol And all the time fanboys said family guy rips off the Simpsons. The Simpsons rip off family guy..



The Family tell/read old family ancestry Peter/Homer BOTH turn out to be black.

""The Simpsons Did It!""
No, No son...
Family Guy Did it.

Anyway, simpsons was good, recent some have been ok.. but Family Guy Dominates. Seth has 3 slots, once simpsons keal over soon he'll get 4 XD   and he did have 4 slots awhile back for his special.. Owned"
,drax12,2010-02-25T15:01Z,"TDG- Why would you have to choose between Simpsons and Family Guy? I like 'em both and wish there were more cool toons. Fans are just backseat drivers, pretending they had a roll in production. Over competitiveness is a mental disorder resulting from capitalist propaganda."
,paradox09,2010-02-25T22:17Z,seed for me plz
,TRONIC777,2010-03-01T16:16Z,"YuvShiR: thanks for the info! eztv: your autonomous activity is greatly appreciated. Let´s keep sharing and seeding for years to come.

I´ve got a 70 kb/s upload rate fixed at all times. It ain´t much, but then again, it´s never less than that.  Peace
"
,bird4mspace,2010-03-14T12:00Z,Any info on when a new episode is coming up? Can't wait any longer!
