The Re-Education of Fantasia

Nine long years after dropping out of high school, Fantasia hires a teacher and takes a diagnostic test to discover her grade level. Problem is...the test is boring. And after about three hours, Fantasia peters out, disappointing herself and her teacher. In Atlanta, Fantasia's singing a Soul Train Awards tribute to her idol, Chaka Khan. But when her manager, Brian gets the bright idea to hire star-maker Frank Gatson to choreograph Fantasia's performance, she digs in her Louis Vuitton heels and vows to just be 'Tasia.
