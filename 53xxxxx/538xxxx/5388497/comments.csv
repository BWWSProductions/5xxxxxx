@20-40 Thanks for the up."
,madtown4,2010-02-24T03:04Z,"@lilars26 that would be great , theres so much i need to learn"
,lilars26,2010-02-24T03:42Z,"@ madtown
I don't know if one is better than another.
I use Norton and it's been good to me.I think the
rule for file sharers is not to use one that comes
from your internet provider.But don't quote 
me on that.You should be able to get a free one at downloads.com."
,madtown4,2010-02-24T04:04Z,"@ lilars26 thanks for your help , some people dont want to help a person at all , and then there is you and 2040 that will share everything . i wish everyone would be that way.. thanks alot."

do not use norton it shall kill ur ram it takes around at least 512 MB.i prefer nod 32 its light and good security even u can work manually.even avg 10 is also good"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-24T05:59Z,"@madtown: Norton is fine, but cost few bucks.
Firewall, anti-virus and anti-spy programs should not be pirated-hacked versions (that would defy the purpose).
By public vote out there is best free software COMODO firewall. I use that one, for years. It IS the best one - and for free."
,madtown4,2010-02-24T06:06Z,"thanks 2040 im going to look in to it now, thanks again"
,demonicjack,2010-02-24T07:07Z,Hey 2040 can u please upload The Boondock Saints 2 : All Saints Day  
,demonicjack,2010-02-24T07:15Z,I know you already did it from the SCR source but can you do it from the DVDrip or Bluray source also since its better quality.
,lilars26,2010-02-24T19:57Z,@madtown4 It was a great time for you to bring up firewalls.I got my Norton 360 free when I bought my laptop.It runs out in 7 days so I will grab Comodo as well.I already installed a new antivirus called Avast which is also free.Another great program is Peerblock which 20-40 has suggested in the past.Also free.
,lilars26,2010-02-24T20:10Z,One other program that I installed recently is called Hotspot Shield.It allows people who do not live in the U.S. to use sites such as Hulu and get free stuff from itunes.
,madtown4,2010-02-25T00:26Z,@lilars26  HEY THANKS FOR THE TIP . GOOD LOOKING OUT .
