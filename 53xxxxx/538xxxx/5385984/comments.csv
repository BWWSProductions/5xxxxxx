the torrent is twice as it needs to be"
,xxx-zone,2010-03-12T17:50Z,"Thanks for this, ignore the above comment.. The rar contains 2 other rar files, this is just the issues 1 - 12 once but is split across 2 rar's. There is no duplicates"
,DragonoftheUSP,2010-03-14T02:47Z,Thanks for the upload but what is the password for PDF's ? I go to load up photoshop and it requests a PDF password.

rubbish 

the issues are not split across 2 rar files( you dont need two rar files for each issue
there are 2 sets of the same issues 
one under mac and one under pc"
