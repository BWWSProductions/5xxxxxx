,MacaroonAvenue,2010-06-26T01:49Z,"For someone as musically diverse as I, saying with any certainty what band, artist or group can be called a ""favorite"" is very difficult. That being said, I have no trouble designating this band as my true favorite.

They have such a lovely sense of melody, and a more-than adequate level of playskill to pull of their densely packed, mile-a-minute compositions I couldn't help but fall in love (even years ago when I so naively admonished this style of singing).

That certainly doesn't mean they're perfect. I know a quite a few bands that have more talented musicians, better studio work or more clever lyrics (Daath, Slipknot, Between the Buried and Me, Dethklok, etc), but none of them get anywhere near pure, unfiltered awesome-in-a-bottle this band can crank out. I mean, what other death/black/whatever metal band do you know that can write songs that play out so aggressively, yet stir up deep feelings of hope and joy? Even with the inevitable decline in quality (almost) every band faces sooner or later, they manage to keep their head above water and remain far ahead of most of their peers.

...Oh, but Come Clarity WAS awful. I'd actually recommend not even downloading it, since whoever produced it was obviously going deaf (Terrible overcompression, 'smileyface' EQ, no clear attempts to separate any one element in the mix, the tom-toms seemed to have more bass than the kick drum, and '...bassist? What bassist?') and Anders tried whining his way through some pretty lame lyrics rather than growling or trying to sing in, well, ANY key... A stain on their track record, for sure."
,NewWorldOrphan9,2010-07-05T05:21Z,Thank you for the download! My favorite band for years. PLZ SEED

,WarsandRumoursofWars,2010-07-30T19:53Z,"MacaroonAvenue, just like to say one thing. You are a moron. ""For some as musically diverse as I?"" Wow, how self-righteous are you? You make me sad to be the same species as you."
,NewWorldOrphan9,2010-08-07T07:59Z,Hey now be nice

,jestered666,2010-12-30T19:54Z,"Relax dude . What he meant by ""diverse"" is that he enjoys a range of music. For you to be so offended by his complimenting statements about inflames almost sickens me. "
,NewWorldOrphan9,2011-01-02T02:14Z,"Here is a link to the IN FLAMES - Trigger EP for Track 2, Watch Them Feed. Sorry, didn't realize the track wasn't in the torrent.

,metallica101.2,2011-02-23T06:21Z,"wow, that was a very ignorant statement, i dont understand how you got self righteous out of that, the guy is just saying he listens to a lot of things, which i appreciate, i agree with his statement, and i personally dont have much respect for people who listen to one genre, so WarsandrumoursofWars, calm down you arrogant prick. let people express their love for music, like fuck."
,Zedlav,2011-03-05T06:33Z,"Awesome! it even includes Man Made God! love that track i had never been able to download a discography with it before, thanks for the share! :)"
,hemne,2011-03-11T23:35Z,"Hello i wonder if its worth to download the Discography with the live albums or should i just go with the originals? its either this one, or this one here ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5426550/In_Flames_Discography ) 

I would appriciate anser & advise "
,alexp0,2011-03-18T02:24Z,"Great stuff man, thanks!!!"
,NewWorldOrphan9,2011-03-18T04:10Z,"The live albums are epic! crisp, clean, and brutal!"
,SunShiny_Sunflower,2011-04-02T13:24Z,"Oh well I had heard some In Flames, but not much. However people say that after they became famous, the fame kind of ruined their music. *Shrug* I cannot judge yet, but will compare now. :D "
,NewWorldOrphan9,2011-05-28T08:29Z,"New Album, 'Sounds of a Playground Fading' is going to be released in the middle of June. Keep you eye OPEN! Check out the new single 'Deliver Us'!
