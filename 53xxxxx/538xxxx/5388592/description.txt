Rhino and Bright Midnight Archives unleash four inspired performances from The Doorsâ€™ final tour with LIVE IN NEW YORK.

This six-disc collection contains all four of The Doorsâ€™ performances â€“ in their entirety â€“ recorded in 1970 at the Felt Forum in New York City. Recorded January 17 and 18, 1970 â€“ just a few weeks before the release of Morrison Hotel â€“ these concerts find Jim Morrison, John Densmore, Robby Krieger, and Ray Manzarek locked in tight as they deliver smoking takes on soon-to-be-classics from their forthcoming album.

Fans will be blown away by the crisp sound found on LIVE IN NEW YORK. All four shows were mixed and mastered by the bandâ€™s longtime engineer, Bruce Botnick, who recorded a number of shows from The Doorsâ€™ 1970 tour on multi-track tape for the Absolutely Live album. Sadly, these shows represent The Doorsâ€™ final New York City performances with Morrison, who passed away July 3, 1971.
