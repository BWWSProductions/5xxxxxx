,Tastelikechicken,2010-02-23T03:05Z,Hey this worked great! No problems found. It did have a problem with an encryption but the software told me where to download a plug in. Anyway good one RobbingHood. This blows DVD Fab away.
[V],RobbingHood,2010-02-28T04:38Z,"Actually DVD neXt COPY neXt Tech v4.0.2.8 is better, but for some reason most people use this.

DVD neXt COPY neXt Tech v4.0.2.8: DVD neXt COPY neXt Tech v4.0.2.8"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-02-28T04:39Z,"Link correction :doh:

,DJScotty27,2010-03-01T01:32Z,Where is the crack file they are talking about?
,DJScotty27,2010-03-01T01:43Z,Please I need help with this.
[V],RobbingHood,2010-03-01T06:45Z,"@DJScotty27 

From the install notes in the Readme!.tx file:

Installation notes:
***************

- Disconnect internet during installation, and/or make sure to BLOCK the prog 
  from accessing internet (block unwanted traffic by using e.g. a firewall).

- After install copy the cracked file from the crack folder into the install dir 
  of DVD neXt COPY Ultimate (to have it replaced with the original file).
  Default install path is -> C:\Program Files\DVDneXtCOPY 3


Which part is hard to understand?"
,DJScotty27,2010-03-01T07:23Z,I dont understand where the cracked file in the cracked folder is.

If you believe in a God then try praying real loud. That didn't work for me, so I used the crack."
