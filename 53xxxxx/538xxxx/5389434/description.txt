PLOT
Unholy Women (Kowai onna), is a composite of three unrelated half-hour horror movies. The first segment, â€œRattle Rattleâ€, tells the story of a young woman who is pursued by an evil other-worldly being.

The second movie, â€œSteelâ€, concerns a young man who agrees to take the sister of his boss out on a blind date, drawing him into a world more frightening than he ever dreamed possible.

The third and final episode, â€œThe Inheritanceâ€, is a supernatural tale of a woman and her young son, scarred by abuse and psychological trauma.
