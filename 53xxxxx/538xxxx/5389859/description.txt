Only murder, wanted and unexplained deaths..real crime stuff.
The quality is very poor. Old vhs tapes which has been compressed into small file size. Typical vhs noise on most.

Time: About 6 hours

How to burn:
I have chosen .iso file this time.
If you use ImgBurn: WRITE IMAGE FILE TO DISC
I tested it at 6x write speed and it worked perfectly...
Remember to keep the .iso file on your pc so you can seed.
