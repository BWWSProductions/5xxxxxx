Johnny Cash American VI Aint No Grave(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
_______________________________________________________

Whatever Bob Dylan meant when he sang that death is not the end, 
this â€” Johnny Cashs second posthumous studio album â€” probably
wasnâ€™t it.

Before his death in 2003 Cash seemed to spend the best part of a
decade contemplating his passing in song.
American I-IV, the predominantly covers-based series of albums that 
he recorded under the aegis of the producer Rick Rubin from 1994, 
depicted an artist not so much willing to stare his Maker in the 
face, as goading Him into delivering him from his Earthly container. 

Even before the Oscar-winning film I Walk the Line depicted him as 
an alt-country Fonz for the new generation of fans, Cashs reputation
â€” his friendship with Dylan, his prison shows, his left-leaning 
politics, the drug addiction and the fact that many people thought 
he actually did shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die â€” meant 
that Rubinâ€™s rebranding of the singer as a musical outlaw with one 
more battle to fight was an irresistible sell. 

Cash was an honorary rock star, so Rubins idea of swapping the boom-
chicka-boom freight train rattle of his best-known tunes with darker
songs from rocks corpus made a perverse sort of sense. 
Nine Inch Nails Hurt, Depeche Modes Personal Jesus, Nick Caves The 
Mercy Seat â€” Cash turned them all into the Gothic mutterings of a 
man who has finally found a senseof belonging in St Peterâ€™s candlelit 
anteroom. 

It was perhaps naÃ¯ve of us to imagine that the series would expire 
with Cash himself. on the face of it, American VI smacks of the 
posthumous exploitation that hangs over the continuing output of 
Tupac Shakur and Eva Cassidy. 
Perhaps pre-empting similar criticism, Rubin claims that Cash set 
the pace of his output in the final two years of his life. 
Sometimes he felt well enough to record; sometimeshe could not. 
Rubins job was to have musicians ready to spring into action on the 
good days. 

On the sixth instalment in the American series, outre covers take a 
back seat. â€œThere aint no grave that can hold my body down,â€ he sings 
on the title track, but â€” placed at the top of the album â€” thisnear-
delirious delivery from Cash is something of a red herring. 

Elsewhere, he sounds peaceably reconciled to the ramifications of his 
own frailty. â€œTheres a train/ Thats heading straight/ To Heavens gate,â€ 
he sings on a sparsely ornamented version of Sheryl Crows Redemption 
Day, switching between images of human conflict and his own unshakeable 
faith. 

Seemingly sung verbatim from his Bible, First Corinthians sees Cash 
singing, â€œO death, where is thy sting,â€ over a back-porch waltz-time 
shuffle. 

Cash may have once been welcoming of Rubins more unusual song choices 
on Previous albums, but his most soulful performances on American VI 
are invested in Nashville standards. 
Kris Kristoffersons For the Good Times, named Song of the Year in 1970 
by the Academy of Country Music, should have long since emptied itself 
of the power to move, but Cashs elementary delight in one of the genres 
set texts takes on an eye-misting beauty. In the circumstances, Satisfied 
Mind â€” a song that has passed through Porter Wagoner, Bob Dylan and Jeff 
Buckley before him â€” is no less of a shoo-in. 

It would be nice to think that the curators of his legend will see fit to 
shut the book here, in the accompanying notes, Rubin echoes the point, 
confirming that this is where his involvement with the American series ends. 
Others may beg to differ, of course. This year (on a different label), 
we have already had Johnny Cash Remixed â€” a self-explanatory â€œprojectâ€ 
starring Snoop Dogg and Pete Rock that Cashs son claims his dad â€œwould have 
lovedâ€. 

But anyone else seeking a full stop to the longest goodbye in music history 
is better advised to find it at the end of American VI. 
To hear Cash serenely intoning â€œUntil we meet againâ€ on Aloha Oe amounts to 
more than closure. Indeed, no man ever sounded so delighted to be to be 
serenading his own wake. 
In honor of Johnny Cashâ€™s 78th birthday, the release of this album, Cashs 
life, and all he stood for as a voice for those in need, Lost Highway Records 
is dedicating February 26th as â€œWear Black For Johnnyâ€ Day. On the labels 
website are details about the commemorative day, the new album, a stream of 
the title track, and the lyrics to Cashs poignant classic â€œMan In Blackâ€ â€” 
words that remain as relevant today as when Cash first wrote them.

A man, a songwriter, a legend; he is truly missed.
