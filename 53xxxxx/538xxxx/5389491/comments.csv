,Ardroth,2010-03-11T03:47Z,"@ madmorro:
So, because it's not compressed to a shit size (the way YOU want) then it's the ""wrong size""?  Wow.  This is a Blu-Ray rip, not a DVD rip... this is not the ""wrong"" size - You're just a selfish moron.

Thanks for the upload - can't wait to see this."
,downpayment,2010-03-11T20:03Z,"I thought 720p was supposed to be 1280x720, so why the 1280x544? black borders or something? anyways, thanks for the up."
,madmorro,2010-03-14T16:09Z,shut it dick wart...
,Evilution,2010-03-15T12:24Z,"Thanks for the upload!

downpayment: the pixels are 1280x544 because it´s shown in full 2.35:1 ratio (the one Cinemas use
as standard i imagine), 1280x720 is ~1.78:1 ratio or 16:9(Widescreen) as it´s more known as in everyday situations.
-""Hey buy this new fancy widescreen TV, superflat extra crisp image etc. etc.!""
I think 97.6% of the TV´s that are sold today are  16:9 :) just guessing... but it seems to be the stick-to standard."
,Evilution,2010-03-15T12:29Z,"and working english subs for the part where they don´t talk english: searched for ""All Saints Day""(i grabbed the bottom one worked ok)

,mosmooth,2010-03-22T08:39Z,"Its 544p because it is compressed for cinema size, not 16:9 TV, as stated. 

This was originally uploaded 25 days ago on another site by aoloffline. 

It is originally a Russian AC3 dubbed upload. The Russian was set as the default audio track with the original English DTS non default, hence you hear the Russian audio. 

There are English subtitles available across all the subtitle db's, again as stated."
,mosmooth,2010-03-22T08:50Z,"This has a jittery English DTS track (as has every other 720p one out there, including 1080p's that were re-packed and re-compressed from the original Russian crack).

There are alternative English only uploads available that do not suffer from that problem but the best is a 1080p at 12.2 Gigs. As size isn't a problem for me (1.5TB PCH A-100 and 4 1.5TB hard drive caddys) I went for the alternative upload (with English full and non-English speaking parts subtitles)."
