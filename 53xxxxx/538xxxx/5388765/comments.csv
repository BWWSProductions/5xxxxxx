,clauge,2010-02-24T00:37Z,"You never disappoint, thanks goosey! How the fuck does Steve C still have a job anyway?"
,fzdolfan,2010-02-24T00:40Z,Thanks again for your invaluable service!

I heard it this morning and didn't think it was that big of a deal.

thanks again goose"
,TokenWGuy,2010-02-24T00:42Z,Thank you Goose. O&A make the world go round.

[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-24T21:29Z,"Head's up pests. Getting some odd encoding errors while going from WAV to MP3 on todays (02-24) O&A. I'm not exactly sure what's going on, just to be safe I'm grabbing the replay (although the rip may actually be the issue). I'll update later this evening when I get hands-on with things. Thanks......"
,Formless1,2010-02-24T22:28Z,Does anybody have the 11-21-2008 episode where Patrice Oneal hosts the show...the torrent is here but noone is seeding it
,charliedawg,2010-02-24T23:07Z,YAY PUDDING!
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-25T01:00Z,"Jesus, I don't know what's going on but the files are a corrupted mess. I have another 128k source on it's way (pretty slowly unfortunately) that I might be able to have posted in an hour or so, then I'll post R&F after it seeds out a bit. In the meantime I'm going to reboot my ripping rig, try another disk drive and grab the 8pm replay. Unless the 3-8 rip turns out OK but I'm not ""going home with hope"" as they say. As long as I figure out the snafu I'll post a true mg56 vbr 128k tomorrow morning or afternoon.

Sit tight kiddies, I'm working on it........ "
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-25T01:19Z,"CBR non-mg56 128k mp3 up sooner than I thought, probably 20-30 min or so. "
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-25T01:42Z,"Alright, scratch that. The original WAV files are fine, yet get corrupted during re-code on that particular machine. Rather than up the crappy 128k and then the good one two hours later, I'm just going to use a different machine to recode them into mp3. 

It will take an hour or two to get O&A up, unfortunately - enjoy shauz's 64k in the meantime. I'm actually gonna edit R&F now and get it up first, probably up in 30 or so. 

Thanks for understanding......."
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-25T01:43Z,"..and trust me, you don't want the cbr 128k anyway. Bigger size and more artifacting as it was encoded quickly and on the fly. "
,go_yukuri,2010-02-25T02:20Z,No worries while there's Olympic Hockey.  Cheers for the effort budday!
,mancation,2010-02-25T02:28Z,got an email to send a link to?
,Thuggles,2010-02-25T03:01Z,"Thanks for all the time you put into this, must be a pain in the ass sometimes but it's appreciated."
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-25T03:20Z,"I'm not sure why, but on a different machine going from wav to mp3 it's taking longer than it should for O&A to encode. Counter started with an hour and 30 then sometimes jumps to 2 hours and 30! Says another hour to go as of now......

I will up it as soon as I can. Also running tests right now to see if A I've fixed the issues and B can I start doing my own R&F rips. I'm editing them atm, might as well do the rip (if it doesn't affect O&A encoding) if I can. I'll start upping them at d3m0n0id too if I can make it happen."
