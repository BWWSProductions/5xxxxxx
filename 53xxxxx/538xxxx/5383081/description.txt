William James "Willie" Dixon (July 1, 1915 â€“ January 29, 1992) was a 

American blues double-bassist, vocalist, songwriter, arranger and record 

producer. His songs, including "Little Red Rooster", "Hoochie Coochie 

Man", "Evil", "Spoonful", "Back Door Man", "I Just Want to Make Love to 

You", "I Ain't Superstitious", "My Babe", "Wang Dang Doodle", and "Bring 

It On Home", written during the peak of Chess Records, 1950â€“1965, and 

performed by Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter, influenced a 

worldwide generation of musicians. Next to Muddy Waters, he was the most 

influential person in shaping the post World War II sound of the Chicago 

blues. He also was an important link between the blues and rock and roll, 

working with Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley in the late 1950s, and his songs 

were covered by some of the biggest artists of the more recent times, 

including Bob Dylan, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Foghat, The Yardbirds, The 

Rolling Stones, Queen, The Doors, The Allman Brothers Band, the Grateful 

Dead, and a posthumous duet with Colin James.  [more:
