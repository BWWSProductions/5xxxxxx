,tyrone69,2010-02-23T17:33Z,"nice job, 2040.

however, is this a proper copy? it's like every few seconds the picture would stop, then get messy, followed by the disappearance of audio.

am i the only one experiencing this? i'm using vlc, by the way.

thanks, man."

Check and double-check your system, maybe you should try with restart/reboot. Do not raise questions which sounds alarming to other people, who may think that is something wrong with my work."
