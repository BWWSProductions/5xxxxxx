Description:
It happens just on New Yearâ€™s Eve: As Simon opens the door to his magic shop, he stares right into the face of two green, grinning creatures who immediately charge their ray guns and fire at him! With a trick, he manages to shake off the invaders, but this is just the beginning. Beyond the gates of the city, an entire army of these green aliens seems to be preparing themselves to destroy not only the Magic World, but Earth itself. Facing this overwhelming threat, Simon has to make use of all tricks he can think of in order to prevent the destruction of his world. Does he have to fight by himself? No, of course not! As the story unfolds, Simon is reunited with various old friends like the Swampling, the nasty little Red Riding Hood or Goldilocks, who are â€“ more or less â€“ willing to help.
