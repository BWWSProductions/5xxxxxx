COMMENTS: Its widely acknowledged that the last episode of this trilogy of stories inspired by Edgar Allan Poe short tales, the one directed by Federico Fellini, is the best of the lot. Theres little doubt about it. However is possibly the least Poe-ian of the three. Besides, the fact that fellini's segment is the best is not detriment to the others. The fact is Toby Dammit is without a doubt amongst the best work Fellini ever did, a disturbing masterpiece that abandoned all Poe material to become a pure Fellini.

But I'll give you two powerful reasons to watch the other two segments:

1. Jane Fonda: She looks absolutely gorgeous, even sexier than in Barbarella, who was also directed by his then husband Vadim. Its not only about Fonda, though. Metzengerstein is the episode that captures better Poe's universe. The strange and 
gradual descent into madness, but more importantly in Poe's work, how fascination turns into obsession. The story is very well directed by Vadim, who wasn't a great director by any means, but in this one does an excellent job at portraying a complex and evocative atmosphere. Visually is a stunning work, those wide shots of Fonda riding the imposing black steed are ones of strange beauty, again, very Poe-like.

2. Brigitte Bardot as brunette, and alain Delon playing two parts. Theres also more than a bit of nudity in this one, from ms bardot, but being honest Malle disappoints a bit. The pace and the Poe feeling isn't quite there, despite Delon's very competent work (did he ever was less than competent?)
