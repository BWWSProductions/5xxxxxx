A studio group comprising two Norwegians and one Englishman. They were offered studio time in London by a budget record label, augmented by strings and several studio musicians (the presence of Junipher Greene members Bent Ã…serud, Freddy Dahl and Geir BÃ¸hren is confirmed, but Helge GrÃ¸slie was most probably also there). The material is rather variable, starting with the excellent "Witchita Falls" but this standard is not maintained throughout - indeed most of the remaining tracks sound more like late sixties pop. "Neptune's Empire Parts 1 and 2" consisted of music for strings only. A mediocre curiosity piece only of historical value.
