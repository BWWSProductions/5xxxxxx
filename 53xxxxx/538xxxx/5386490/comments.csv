[V],twentyforty,2010-02-23T10:54Z,"@allensteiner: I seed from second one - but... if you have read what was written above - others did not. This swarm was in complete ""halt"" five times - and each time I must to manually  ""un-break"" (keep initial-seeding going).

But - how many times more? Should I delete this torrent and forget about MoA altogether?

Unleash your upload to others, THERE IS 1.1 FILE SHARED BETWEEN 8 PEOPLE!!!

People must learn to share. Even if I stop to seed, there is more than enough bytes in the swarm. I usually have first one out when 1.0084 ratio is achieved.

Enough is - enough."
