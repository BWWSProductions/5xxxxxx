I'll bite

Torrents work on the principle of sharing. Seeders are uploaders, leechers are downloaders. At the start of a torrent you are a leecher, when it is finished, you are a uploader.

There is a forum link below, that has much more advanced explanations, also you could use google.

These comments used to be for the quality of the torrent, now they seem to be to report the many people that are attempting to destroy TPB through spam and malware. Anyway, conversations like this belong in the forum."

Would you PLEASE at least make comments ignore *extra* linefeeds so spammers and other assholes can't take up half the page with a single comment??"

Thanks uploader. But it's not worth it in my opinion. Scorsese is a director who pays great attention to visuals. This cam torrent is not good enough to enjoy ""Shutter Island"" (it would be good enough to enjoy ""Valentine's Day"" and stuff, but not ""Shutter Island"").

 I don't want to moan and I honestly appreciate the uploader's effort, but this torrent ain't doing ""Shutter Island"" no justice."
