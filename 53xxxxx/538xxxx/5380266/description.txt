              A french docu from 2002.
              The worlds largest 'nuclear-loaded submarine' was built in
              Russia. 179 meters long, 20 missiles that can lay in wake
              for months before exploding, the force within the missiles
              are so great that they can destroy an entire country within
              30 minutes. For the first time we'll set our foot on the
              worlds largest death-machine and the pride of the russian
              fleet. Together with the crew of 130 men we'll dive deep
              in to the ocean on a topsecret military mission.
