The title is perfect too....MYTH.
The guy was never 14 inches.

Here is some interesting history just for fun - 

Holmes himself made outrageous claims all the time...he lost his virginity at 6 years old, for years he claimed it was 12 inches, 15 inches, then it suddenly became 16 inches. lol His 1st wife seems to be the best authority. She has told the story of how Holmes used to measure it all the time (he was sex and cock obsessed) and it was always about 10 inches. Yes, it is true that Johnny did gay porn at the end of his career and did hustle on the streets for cash for his drug addiction.

10 inches seems about right.  Look at his movies and compare it to the size of his hands and the size of it when the ladies hold it.
Now, grab a ruler, and add 2 more inches to it, hold it like he does, have your girlfriend hold it. Does it even look close in size??? lol NOPE!

But to be fair, he was never fully hard in the movies. Ever notice that? He was always half firm. In numerous books the old pornstars he was with always used to say it was never much fun as it seemed because he could never get it up all the way. Probably the drugs..who knows. Maybe fully hard he was 14 inches but you will never see proof on film."
