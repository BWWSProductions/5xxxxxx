Sinopsys (from Amazon and others):
The planet is called Banshee. The air is unbreathable, the water poisonous. It is the home of the most implacable enemy that humanity has ever encountered.... The Ants!
Body armor has been devised for the commando forces that are to be dropped on Banshee. A trooper in this armor is a one-man, atomic-powered battle fortress, but he will have to fight a nearly endless horde of berserk, hard-shelled monsters.

Description (from Wikipedia):
"Armor" is a military science fiction novel by John Steakley. It has some superficial similarities with Robert A. Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" (such as the military use of exoskeletons and insect-like alien enemies) but concentrates more on the psychological effects of violence on human beings rather than on the political aspects of the military, which was the focus of Heinlein's novel.
It was first published in December 1984.
"Armor 2" is apparently on the works.

John Steakley is also the author of "Vampire$", the novel in which the film "Vampires", by John Carpenter, was based.
