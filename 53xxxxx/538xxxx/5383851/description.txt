On the 20-year anniversary of his groundbreaking masterpiece Roger & 
Me (1989), Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story comes home to the 
issue he's been examining throughout his career: the disastrous impact 
of corporate dominance on the everyday lives of Americans (and by default, 
the rest of the world). But this time the culprit is much bigger than 
General Motors, and the crime scene far wider than Flint, Michigan. From 
Middle America, to the halls of power in Washington, to the global 
financial epicenter in Manhattan, Michael Moore will once again take film 
goers into uncharted territory. With both humor and outrage, Michael Moore's 
Capitalism: A Love Story explores a taboo question: What is the price that 
America pays for its love of capitalism? Years ago, that love seemed so 
innocent. Today, however, the American dream is looking more like a 
nightmare as families pay the price with their jobs, their homes and their 
savings. Moore takes us into the homes of ordinary people whose lives have 
been turned upside down; and he goes looking for explanations in Washington, 
DC and elsewhere. What he finds are the all-too-familiar symptoms of a love 
affair gone astray: lies, abuse, betrayal...and 14,000 jobs being lost 
every day. Capitalism: A Love Story is both a culmination of Moore's 
previous works and a look into what a more hopeful future could look like. 
It is Michael Moore's ultimate quest to answer the question he's posed 
throughout his illustrious filmmaking career: Who are we and why do we 
behave the way that we do?
