[b]Razorlight Annihilation Windows 7 N Edition x64[/b]

Razorlight Annihilation windows 7 N comes without media cetner and Internet Explorer it does include
windows media player and all releated media dll's.
I owe a number of thanks to ppl for the creation of this build,
I would like to start with THE BLACK PAGE bud all those long nites all that testing all the help you gave,
finding images us looking at this or that to make sure was the perfect fit I could not have done this without
you bud many thanks for all your help
To Mark ( aka MR. GRIM ) from virtual customs for his awesome black glass aero theme and allowing me to
mod it to fit the looks of this build along with you custom windows media player that I modded a bit and your
timedate.cpl. I have included everyone of your themes in this release you do amazing
work bud keep those themes rolling and thanks for all your help
To Neuropass for letting me take his silent install of messenger and letting me modify it to match
the build theme
To all the other silent install makers like jamesbebby for helping me and helping me to learn to make
my own silent installers you guys do great work.
A big thanks to Buster67 and all the members of newage-os  
This build has a default theme to be used with full glass or without, with the fullglass app
that I have included in a folder on the desktop with instructions on where to place it to have
it start up with your os. The full glass application will give you glass windows as you see in
the screens below. Without full glass you will have a black shell. The full glass app uses
almost no resources. I have also included blend.exe which will make your applications glass.
Along with start menu animation that I have customized for this theme with instructions on
where to place them to have them start with the os if you would like to use them. There is also animation
in the details pane where information is displayed for files and the same animation in explorer
for showing all of your pictures folders and files. Also included is black copy move animation.
I have included a custom rocket dock install I made for this theme along with some stand alone apps
like glass calculator, glass notepad and others will be listed below. In the build I have included 70+
of the best themes so thanks to all the theme makers out there for the wonderful work you do.
There is now double the amount of registry tweaks in the build also will be listed below they come in
.reg format in a folder on your desktop or as silent installs from the wpi apps menu.
This build is a special edition and will only come in the x64 edition sry no x86 for this one.
