The Cleveland Show is an American animated series that premiered on September 27, 2009 as a part of the "Animation Domination" lineup on Fox.

The series was created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Henry, and Richard Appel as a spin-off from Family Guy, which was also created by MacFarlane.

In the beginning of the series, Cleveland Brown and his son, Cleveland Brown, Jr., move from Quahog, Rhode Island to the fictional town of Stoolbend, Virginia.

Cleveland has kind of had enough in Quahog â€“ he kind of realizes that he wants his own friends, his own sidekicks, his own stories. So he sets out to California to make it in a way that we'll have to keep a secret until the show starts, and then he ends up somewhere else, which we'll also keep a secret until the show starts. But he basically goes home â€“ he goes to his hometown in Virginia and rekindles an old high school flame.
