Multimedia 'Learn Chinese' Package

Rocket Chinese is a beginnerâ€™s course on Mandarin Chinese, which is the modern and official Chinese language spoken in Mainland China, Taiwan, and in Singapore (where it i one of four official languages).

The course
comes in three main components:

1) audio lessons, which you listen to;
2) textual lessons, which you read; and
3) learning games, which you play.

But all three components have one thing in common: each one of them involves your own active participation.

With the audio lessons in the Rocket Chinese Interactive Audio Course, you will add your own voice to the conversations that are the focus of each lesson, both by repeating words to practice your pronunciation, and by saying the correct word or phrase when prompted by your host.

These audio lessons come with supplementary written transcripts.

With the textual lessons, which focus on the grammar of the Chinese language and view it in its contemporary cultural context, you will walk through the various steps of how to use Chinese articles, adjectives, and verbs, how to build more and more complex sentences, and how to write in Chinese.
