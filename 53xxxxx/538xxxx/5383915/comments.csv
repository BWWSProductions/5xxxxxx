@Serpant28 : im playing it on a Win 7 x64 as well, had no problem at all, used this patch with this trinity release : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5341343/Sins.of.a.Solar.Empire.Trinity-SKIDROW.iso"
,Bongo2,2010-05-14T17:32Z,"So the reason we can't play anymore is because we don't have 1.011?
Am I correct on this?"
,Bongo2,2010-05-14T17:32Z,"So the reason we can't play ONLINE anymore is because we don't have 1.011?

,war_peanut,2011-02-18T19:20Z,"Thanks man, works great. If you're feeling up to it, maybe you (or anyone else) can upload a more recent version?"
,Irishramb,2011-04-07T04:20Z,crack for 1.2 would be fantastic :)
,battle21,2011-04-17T11:23Z,Diplomacy 1.011 hotfix please!
,supahblah,2011-05-07T01:25Z,"Patch 1.2 + crack would be the thing to upload right now, it's been out for at least a month, still nothing from no one"
,jasperz0r,2011-05-17T01:23Z,somebody upload patch 1.2 already
,wck,2011-05-31T08:13Z,"wtf is up? the 1.2 patch balances out the game so much, it's made so many changes that have been needed for a long time but there's no download for it anywhere. It came out almost 3 months ago. Why is nobody uploading this and a crack for it?"
,m.rafay31,2011-08-06T09:51Z,"We need uptil patch v1.03. PLEASE.

I'll seed for weeks."
,Xoatl_169,2011-09-04T09:34Z,"@wck

I agree, its a fun game. But there are glaring problems that the patch balances out. I guess people with the know how aren't interested in Sins."
