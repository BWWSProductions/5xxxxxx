                          - The Geese & The Ghost -

Ant Phillips was the guitarist of the legendary progessive rock group Genesis until Trespass in 1970.
When you listen to this, his first solo album, the evidence is clear how deeply this man's influence on the early music of Genesis had been. It's very calm music in a medieval and pastoral mood. This album will grow on you in spite of the shallow impression at first listenings and is an absolutely must-have for fans of the early Genesis stuff.
