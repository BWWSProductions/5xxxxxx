,Danman42,2010-02-24T16:30Z,"Is this a fake album. I am sick and tired of fake stuff man. Sorry to the uploader if it is legit.
My connection is super slow. So I like to know before I spend 2 days getting a fake album"

,larrwood,2010-04-10T00:36Z," Yeah it's a compilation that someone
came up with...but it is Akon singing with
other artists...it's not very good but I love 
One Day which I couldn't find elsewhere with
Akon...the quality is 160kb/s on that one."
