,xx21playerxx,2010-02-25T16:44Z,"Confirmed Working!! On a softmod NTSC 3.2
Patched it to 249 from 55 using IOS patcher and used Brickblock to remove the updates on the ISO image.
One more great release from Markuf :)

,TheRuthlessOne,2010-02-26T03:40Z,"I was wondering if someone could help me, I have an NTSC Wii, with a mod chip, which is also soft modded and I have Neogamma 8. However when I insert the disc the system look for an update and when I use Neogamma the game play is in black and white. Are there any settings that I have to change in Neogamme to play a PAL game? "
,xx21playerxx,2010-02-26T14:17Z,"@ TheRuthlessOne
Just force video(Neogamma settings) to NTSC480i [I use R8 rev 17]
Like I said there is an update on this ISO image. Use BrickBlocker(Google it) to remove updates, also use RegionsFri(Google it) to change the region on the ISO file. 
Hope it works cause it did for me. GOOD LUCK!!"
