,KendiAdam,2010-03-24T22:50Z,"Hi! Is it the application interface or just a map or what? If I do what the readme says, i will have a garmin software on my BB and then i'll be able to import a map to the BB? Can you or anyone help me please? "

this is the whole application for your phone, includes CrackUtil.exe so you can use to upload this cracked version to your phone.

thanks !!!"
,JVS0R,2010-04-10T13:43Z,"Thanks for the upload! Works great for my Blackberry Bold 9700. Crackutil didn't work for me for some reason, so I had to write my own .alx file and just loaded the app in with Desktop Manager. Here's the .alx contents if anyone needs it:



    Garmin Mobile
    Provides audible turn-by-turn driving instructions.
    5.4.5
    Garmin International
    ÂŠ2009 Garmin Ltd. or its subsidiaries


      gmbb96xx.cod




Just make a new text file and title it gmbb96xx.alx, then copy and paste the above into the file and save."
,JVS0R,2010-04-10T13:46Z,"Ugh, the .alx coding didn't get displayed after I submitted the comment. Here it is on PasteBin: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=VeN4H72s"
