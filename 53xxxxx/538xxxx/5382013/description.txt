Ok so I uploaded the vhs rip but the video quality was pretty bad. 

I have ripped the video from the dvd version and combined the audio from the vhs version with a few tweaks to remove background hiss and whatnot.

Basically this is a better version of the torrent i previously uploaded..

Have tried my best to sync up the audio but as you know the speaking will be slightly off anyway due to the dub.

This has took me a while but I really wanted a good quality version with the original English dub which was replaced on the dvd version.. Why they did that I will never know!

So show some love and dont forget to SAM SEED !!!!
