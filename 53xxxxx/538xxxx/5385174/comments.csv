,aagaliarept,2010-03-11T01:49Z,These are the same keys as the old generator. I am assuming you are just scrolling through 50+ pre-made keys. If so these won't last too long.
,JVIixxster,2010-03-11T08:24Z,"thanks for all the comments guys :D

@aagaliarept:
these keys are from the keygen of robbinghood,
but most peaple dont trust that one, so yeah i copied the serials, and pasted them in a clean one...

just to help you guys out ;)"

,Evenol,2010-04-26T18:17Z,"Thanks for the upload, JVIxxster.
I got one question, I can't get the AVG Internet Security Pack 3 to work, it wont generate any keys for it. Can you check it out? Thanks in advance."
,JVIixxster,2010-04-28T20:43Z,"gosh, ur right :O

here are some serials, sorry :/

""8MEH-RO9SN-AVE3P-E3SMR-PE4DA-HEMBR-ACED""
""8MEH-RTN2Z-UDAMK-6RWGA-AHEG6-VEMBR-ACED""
""8MEH-RMXLW-HNS4A-BABPA-SJZCG-PEMBR-ACED""
""8MEH-RBG6H-9CUPW-G499A-L2KEL-8EMBR-ACED""
""8MEH-RQPO6-7Z498-HGY9A-FUSKC-XEMBR-ACED""

well, if i upload new one then everyone gotta seed...."
,moeyyy,2010-05-02T03:46Z,"thanks! good seeds, and it works! no trojans or anything."
,Evenol,2010-05-06T16:59Z,"Cheers again, Mixxster. The problem now is that I get reminded every day that ""This is not a valid AVG-Key"" etc. when I start my computer. So I think the keys have been blacklisted by AVG?"
,JVIixxster,2010-05-07T22:13Z,"hmmm, that would suck...

are you sure you matched the keys with the right version?
i use internet security myself, but i didn't had any problems :O

i don't know, i hope they did'nt, and else ill upload some new alternatives ;)"
,Evenol,2010-05-11T19:45Z,"I fixed it, no worries :) I uninstalled AVG and installed it with one of the keys you pasted here. It was a tip i read somewhere, so it works great now. Thanks again :>"
,JVIixxster,2010-05-11T21:46Z,"as long as i can help you out :D
