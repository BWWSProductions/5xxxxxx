A Film by Arthur Mac Caig 

Rich in emotional images, often tender but more often terrifying the patriot game tells the story of the long and bitter battle for the 6 counties of the north of Ireland. The films introduction covers Irelands history from colonization to the territoryâ€™s division in 1922. 

The Patriot Game then details the events of the decade that began in 1968. Through powerful portraits as the infamous â€œBloody Sundayâ€ 

The film show the IRA at work â€“ much of it filmed clandestinely â€“ as they argue their cause. 

Thorough and thoughtful â€¦. Mac Caigâ€™s film by dissecting the situation so coolly, helps emphasize, the bitterness and the confrontations. Regardless of how one may feel about politics it is a worthy and well made documentary.
