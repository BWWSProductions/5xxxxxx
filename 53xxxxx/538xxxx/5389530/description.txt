As my first .torrent upload, I thought it would be fitting for that to be an application; the name of which, involves my trademark 'x3'. 
Really though, people, I look at the amount I've downloaded from others, and the insanely low uploads, and want to give something back. 

Enjoy...

...someone? Anyone?!


Finally I have the pleasure of introducing, to the Macintosh users of ThePirateBay; 

EndNoteÂ® X3 ...Bibliographies Made Easy? No, Free!


With its world-class speed and track record, EndNote X3Â® puts your publishing in the lead and keeps you there. Out of the blocks with new features like faster start up times and seasoned favorites like our Cite While You Writeâ„¢ technology, EndNote X3 is moving fast to deliver the worldâ€™s most complete bibliographic solution.
 
Create new bibliography styles in new places
Youâ€™ll find new speed in Cite While You Write for AppleÂ® 
Pages â€™09, MicrosoftÂ® Word and now OpenOffice.org Writer 3
for Windows. With EndNote X3, you can create multiple bibliographies within a single Word documentâ€”specify end of chapters, end of document, or both. Chemistry styles are now supported with composite references that group citations.
 
Simplify collaboration with EndNote Web and ResearcherID
EndNote X3 includes your personal EndNote Web account that not only transfers groups swiftly between desktop and Web but also organizes your own publication list for the free ResearcherID author community. By creating a seamless system,you are able to view personal citation metrics in ResearcherID, complete with dynamically updated links to Times Cited detail in the ISI Web of KnowledgeSM.
 
Improve organization with new grouping options
You can now create groups containing both custom and smart groups for easier organization. The main and sub-groups can be
re-arranged any time with a simple drag-and-drop action. And,
you can locate more full text by setting up your institutionâ€™s EZProxy authentication in the EndNote preferences.
 
Other new features:
Faster startupâ€”EndNote X3 installs the 100 most popular styles to make Cite While You Write faster. You can easily select additional styles as needed.
More options for compressed librariesâ€”define an entire library, a group, or selected references to compressâ€”with or without file attachments.
Compare duplicate records side-by-side for easy review.
Use new and improved Mac AppleScripts to enhance searches and match existing references with local PDF files by uniquely identifying DOI and PMCID data.
Access more online resources and publishing stylesâ€”3,900+ online connection files, 700+ import filters and 3,700
journal styles.

Also, a big thanks goes to the user alevill, as they were the one to provide the initial location. All credit should be directed toward them, as the original uploader is unknown to me. 


**Anyone who happened to stumble upon this while looking for the Windows version, I will upload that, upon requestâ€“â€“unless it is already elsewhere on ThePirateBay.
