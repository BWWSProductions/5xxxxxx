Now, there are a couple of things within this download that gives me pause:

- There is a readme text file that references a videomentor.exe file; however, I did a search of the file folder and there are no *.exe files included within the download.

- Since there is no *.exe files, the rest of the contents of the folder really means nothing. The only folder that means anything is the ""data"" folder. Within this folder, there are numerous *.flv files that are, in fact, the CISSP Lessons and Labs. There is also a *.html file that links all the lessons together.

Overall, this is a very good tool that I am sure will help prepare me for the CISSP exam. However, I believe it is missing a major component to make it fully functional."
