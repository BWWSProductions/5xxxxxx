Ol' Brown Ears is Back is a 14-track album featuring Rowlf the Dog. Rowlf, at the piano, gives ebullient introductions and banter as he sings and plays some of his (and the Muppets') hit songs. The album was released on CD and cassette in 1993 by BMG Kidz/Jim Henson Records. The cassette release included a poster depicting Rowlf behind the scenes, recording and prepping for the album.

Although the album was first released in 1993 (three years after Henson's death), the songs were actually recorded by Jim Henson (as Rowlf) and Derek Scott (on piano) almost a decade earlier, in January 1984.

The original recordings by Henson and Scott were re-worked by producer Robert Kraft and associate producer Chris Boardman for the release, adding a backing orchestra to the seasoned vocal and piano tracks. The original intentions for the raw tracks and the reason for the 9-year recording-to-release gap are unknown.

The album's title, Ol' Brown Ears is Back, is a reference to Frank Sinatra's 1973 album Ol' Blue Eyes is Back.
