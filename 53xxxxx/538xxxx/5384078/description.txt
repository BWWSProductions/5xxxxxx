This in turn causes her wish to come true, and her parents forget about each other and about their kids Alex, Max, and Justin. Justin figures his father must still have his powers since his dad and mom had never met and asks his father, who has no recollection of Justin and just regards him as a random tourist and wizard on what to do about the situation, he tells him that they must find the Stone Of Dreams, a magical stone that can reverse any spell and grant any wish. Justin and Alex then embark on a journey to find the Stone Of Dreams along with a not so great street magician and his parrot who have their own plans for the Stone Of Dreams.

File Size:              4.36GB  4.10 GB (For The Rar File)

Type Of DVD:            VIDEO_TS  


This is the full DVD including orignal DVD menus, bonus features, Disney Fast Play so that you can skipp to the title menu screen and skip the previews, Setup Menu including audio languages, subtitle languages, scene selector, and previews aka ''Sneak Peeks'' The only thing that has been changed to this is the file size which was orignaly 7.02GB and is now 4.36GB so that it could be fit on to a regular 4.7 blank DVD instead of using a Dual Layer blank DVD so the only way you would really see a difference in the audio and video is if you had the orignal DVD copy on a DVD or stored on your PC somewhere and compared it. This is how all my releases are if the file size is bigger than what a normal 4.7 blank DVD is but I just wanted to make that clear.


                        How To Burn The Movie To A DVD


Extract the VIDEO_TS folder to your computer using WinRar then use Clone2DVD, Nero, ConvertXToDVD, or if you have some other program that you have that allows you to burn DVD's from a VIDEO_TS folder. 


If you use Clone2DVD:


When you start it up and click ''write existing data'' NOT one of the other 2 options. Then under ''source'' have DVD movie titles selected and make sure over in the top right corner you have the ''DVD writer'' button selected. Next select your preferred speed but if you bure it and a lower speed you reduce the risk of getting any errors which you shouldn't but it will take longer. Next change your volume label this it what will show up when you see your disc inserted on my computer. NOTE once you have made a volume label for a DVD and close out of Clone2DVD and go back in to burn a different DVD it shows your previous volume label that you put on your previous burn so make sure you change that each time. You should label it how DVD's are usually labeled in all caps and use underscores for a new word instead of spaces but you dont have to. Then click ''Go'' once you have done all those settings and have a blank DVD in your burner. If you dont it will just ask you ''to please insert media into drive:'' then it gives the letter of whatever your bruner drive name is and it will make a ticking clock sound til you have inserted a blank media. Once you have done that it will automatically start burning. While its butning you also have the option to shut down your PC once the burning has successfully completed. If you do not want it to shut down then don't check it. It will make a sound when the movie has sucessfuly burned or will say ''Oooohhhh Nnnnoooo'' if something went wrong but there shouldn't be anything wrong with my file itself because I have sucessfully done a test burn with no problems so if you get that there is something wrong with your PC or burner. Thats it!!!!!!


If You Use ConvertXToDVD:


If you want a different DVD title name for this movie just right click the folder and click rename. Then open up ConvertXToDVD and click ''Action'' on the menu at the top. Then at the bottom of the drop down menu click ''Burn an already converted project''. It will ask you to insert media into your burner so insert a blank DVD if you already haven't. It will then bring up a window to search for your converted file. Go to the location in that window of where the Wizards Of Waverly Place Folder is or what you change the name to and click that Dont't click the VIDEO_TS folde just click the root folder. Then click ok and once that closes it will start burning. That It and Enjoy!!!!!!
