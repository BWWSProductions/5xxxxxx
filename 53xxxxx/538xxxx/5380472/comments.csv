,Superman169,2010-02-22T09:23Z,Thank u very much for this been waiting for this
,nojesus,2010-02-28T03:14Z,"Thanks for the upload. Unfortunately, this movie sucks a MASSIVE cock compared to the first film. The entire script is laden with part 1 flashbacks and references to the one-liners in the first film. It seemed far less serious than the first Boondock Saints, but not in a way that amused me. Detective Greenly appears to have aged rather poorly in the last 10 years. I had really high hopes for this, but the only thing I could think after watching is how I hope this marks the end of Troy Duffy's career as a director."
