CAN U DO IT IN ENGLISH.........."
,777Faron,2011-03-23T20:15Z,"One question: Where the fuck are the subtitles. There clearly reads ""subtitled languages: English"" in the torrent description. This is not the first time i've encountered this problem. Is it some kind of sick inner circle joke for torrent loaders to leave the subtitles out, but stating that they exist? This fucking thing is making me so mad i wanna kill somebody. Just put ""NO"" on the place where there now reads ""English"". Thank you."

,JUSTlN182,2011-06-05T19:29Z,commentary is a separate audio track. Play it with a program such as splash where you can choose which audio track to play. windows media player automatically plays both at the same time
