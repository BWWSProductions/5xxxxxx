NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
Here's our first version of when in rome....sources used are the russian cam (thanks) and the
audio is by LU (thanks).
The video was another one of them "blue" coloured releases and there is several camera
movements through.
Audio for cam was half decent .......
Work done,firstly stripped LU's audio and jazzed it up a touch in adobe and resaved and resynced
as it wouldn't mux straight over the russian cam we have....
The video we needed to play with the colouring and yet again same as shutter island.....once you get one
part looking good theres other scenes that aren't as good Anyway done the best we could and also sharpened and
cleaned up the video a touch aswell.
Oh the video also contains some glare and is worse in some scenes than others.....toned the glares down the best we
could without making the film too dull.
