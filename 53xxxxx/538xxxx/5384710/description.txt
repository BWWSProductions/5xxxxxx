Another day, another batch of videos. However, this time, I've decided to add replays. So, in addition to the videos, there will be replays included in the torrent.

Just a note: it takes some time for seeders from past torrents to switch over so if you start out on the new torrent with slow download times (less than 300kps :D) and you do not already have the videos from past torrent, you might want to start off with those. You can find them in my profile.

So far, the torrent has been hugely successful. Far beyond what I thought it would. I figured I'd be seeding by my lonesome but it turns out that there's usually about 40 other seeders. Thank you for your support. My ISP thanks you.
