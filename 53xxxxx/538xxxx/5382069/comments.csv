[V],thethingy,2010-02-21T19:45Z,"just a sugestion but have you downloaded the torrent yourself?, that works better than placing the torrent you made into your btclient "
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2010-02-21T19:58Z,"I did upload it straight to my bt client, iyo is that where i went wrong? so ive removed it now and im gonna d/l it, but totally noob question, if its my torrent, where am i d/ling it from? cheers"
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2010-02-21T21:01Z,"still nothing is happening, any suggestions? anyone?"
[V],thethingy,2010-02-21T23:12Z,"youre downloading it with trackers on it, its working now as you have 13 seeders,

oi 13 seeders does this work?"
,stukaville,2010-03-06T18:25Z,I updated this to 1.2.0.9 then re applied the patch. Loaris now asks for an activation code before it will delete threats. Does anyone know if using the registrationn inc in the keygen will work or will i need to roll back to 1.2.0.6 ?
,stukaville,2010-03-06T18:43Z,"Answered my own question, this will not update the virus definitions. When you try to update it just downloads a new version '1.2.0.9'. The keygen.exe appears to patch it ok, but when you run a scan it will not remove threats anymore. I tried entering the same info from the keygen again and clicked activate. This just takes you to a payment page."
