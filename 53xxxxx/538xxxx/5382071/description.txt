Does this driver improve sound quality or performance? Are there any tweaks?


No, this driver does not improve sound quality nor increase performance.

No, there are no tweaks.

If someone states that its driver improves sound quality and performance, you are being fooled, cheated.

 

It is even worse that the so called tweaks come from a person who is not EVEN technically acknowledged, does NOT know anything about Windows internals, software engineering and sound fidelity that all audiophiles always look for.

 

If you "feel" the sound better, that is the infamous placebo effect and there is no real proof that any tweaks work.

 

In fact, I have yet to see a driver that states in its release notes that it improves sound quality.

 

I've disassembled about every single .SYS driver, .DLL libraries and .EXE executables and found nothing.

 

There are some undocumented registry values, but nothing related to sound quality or performance.

 

Would the so called tweaks even exist, they would be in my Support Packs, you can bet that.

To use the built-in decoder, make sure it is enabled in Audio Console.

 

Select "SPDIF Out (Creative SB Audigy (WDM))" as the output device of your player and then configure the AC3/DTS filter to send the stream through SPDIF.

 

When you restart your computer, the Tone settings (Bass and Treble) are not applied.

DTS Encoder Switcher

 

The Encoder Switcher is now part of Audio Console.

 

A shortcut is created in the Programs -> Creative folder in Start Menu.

 

For additional info, read thoroughly the ReadMe.txt file included in the EncSwitcher folder where you extracted the Support Pack.

 

 

Hardware CMSS Headphone

 

To use the hardware CMSS you need to select "Disable all enhancements" in the "Enhancements" tab on:

Playback Devices -> Speaker Properties

 

Now check the Speaker configuration in "Playback devices".

 

If it is Stereo, run Audio Console and change it to 4.1, 5.1 or 7.1 and only after that change it to Headphones.

 

This procedure ensures that CMSS(1) will work after a Windows restart, otherwise only CMSS2 will work.
