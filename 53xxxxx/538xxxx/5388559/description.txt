Plot Outline


Beyond Sherwood Forest is a story of danger and derring-do, 
of fantasy and phantasms. The Sheriff of Nottingham has unleashed a 
hideous winged monster â€œa tortured forest spiritâ€Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to destroy the 
gentle towns and woods of England, massacre Robinâ€™s men, and capture 
his Maid Marian. Hearts will run cold with fear, and streets will run 
red with blood. Can The Prince of Thieves and his gallant men defeat this
beast from another world and her cruel master?
