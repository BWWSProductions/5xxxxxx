,DavidM86,2011-03-19T16:28Z,"This is a broken Torrent. Some Files are there, some AREN'T. And then half way through season 4 the file format changes, and so does season 5. Glad to have it tho. and it is a TV rip. not the best quality if you care. took me a a day and a half to Download. Considering that there is files missing. for eg: you WONT have eps 1, but 2, and then 3 is missing and there is 4,5,6, then 7,8 are missing. "

For the episodes that you say aren't there, just go into Folder options and choose the option to show extensions for known file types, and then add .avi to the end of those files, after the episode title. For the VOB files, just convert to Xvid."

,perril,2012-02-10T04:39Z,"/Season 5/03 - Pop's Campaign	76.87 MiB is fake.
Its a RAR file and has fucking 22 original gospel greats IN IT!

+ the rar file has a password"
,El_Foosay,2012-03-30T19:04Z,"S05E03 The Pop's Campaign File doesn't work but the rest work. you just rename the unnamed files to .avi or .vob whichever matches with the rest of the files in the folder and they work. 

However it is missing another episode. S02E17 Love Letter. Other than that it's the best available. Would like to find those 2 episodes tho"
