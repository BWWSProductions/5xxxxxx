,danroberto,2010-03-14T19:36Z,skips also with DVICO Tvix... 
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2010-03-21T22:59Z,it might be the fact that you are using an external HDD [on usb] fat 32 formatted [it seems to be a bug related problem in this situation!]....maybe with a later firmware update.....
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2010-03-21T23:02Z,it happens with >500gb usb HDD fat 32 that moves slower [external]....maybe with an update of firmware....

[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-08-14T12:00Z,"It was one of my first rips in HD: I'm pretty sure that this one has QPel and GMC activated [ not recomended for most of today players....Sorry for that]

@shanebb :  It plays OK on a PC with the proper codecs installed and..capable to render HD video

Enjoy! 
P.S. I can Rerip this one...sometime ... with the standard settings for aviHD [.H263]"
