 Original French production was called "Les Filles de Caleb". It was redubbed
in English and renamed "Emilie" for Anglophones. The tapes I used were in
decent enough shape, more or less, but the colour was still kinda washed out
(25 years old). I played with the contrast and brightness a bit, tried to
sharpen as best as I could, but ultimately this is just an analog rip through a
composite cable. Additionally, I had some problems with Tape 03, about 32
minutes in, there was a flaw in the video feed which my recording equipment was
unable to recover gracefully from, so there is about  thirty seconds of bad
video. I patched it together as well as I could, and the audio stays continuous
& clean, so it's minor (relative to the rest of the series), but it's present
and obvious.
  I ripped the series as it's presented on tape. The editting and production on
the original tapes weren't that great to begin with, and trying to accomodate
for that created more issues than it resolved, so I just left it as a straight
rip true to its commercially distributed nature. I had to crop a bit, but
resized the video stream into an SD-standard frame for easy DVD conversion.
Files should recode to NTSC-compliant DVD without difficulty.

PS :
If anybody has a copy of the last episode of "Man Alive" (with the three devils posing as old men), I'd sure appreciate you posting it.
