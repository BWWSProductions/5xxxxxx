,cbair79,2010-02-23T18:09Z,"Oh, Praetorian, go back to your pornos of girls that look like they're 12 and let the adults talk..."
,evilmofo,2010-02-23T19:38Z,"Beck, when asked why he doesn't like Obama: ""i can't put my finger on it"" 
hhhmmmmm... maybe it's the ""n"" word?
He spreads misinformation and disinformation. 
Beck's a loser!"
,thePraetorian,2010-02-24T02:36Z,"Haha. Adults. That's funny. If Glenn Beck weren't on Fox, no one would be able to tell the difference between the stuff he says and the stuff crazy preachers with signs rant about on street corners. Lucky for him, Fox News is an entire network of crazy sign-wavers."
,wafwot,2010-02-25T01:42Z,"You have to love the comments by those on the left, thePraetorian, I'm talking about you.  I suppose they prefer MSNBC or PBS to be 'informed'.  Fox is #1 for a reason, and it isn't the reason you gave."
,thePraetorian,2010-02-25T07:35Z,"Actually, I prefer John Stewart, like most intelligent people my age. Which is quite awful that a comedian is the only TRULY objective journalist.

Oh, and Fox news is #1 because stupid people outnumber smart people. Especially in the US. It's sad, but it's true."

,Dadutta,2010-04-16T13:03Z,God bless you Glenn Beck
