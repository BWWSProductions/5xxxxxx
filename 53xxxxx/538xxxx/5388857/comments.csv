,rolls7s,2011-02-25T20:46Z,Just installed Windows 7 service pack one and needed to reactivate Windows. This patch worked just fine. Checked with system properties and Windows is activated. No problems. Run as administrator without antivirus and you're home free. This works great. Good upload. FMS (Fuck Micro Soft)
