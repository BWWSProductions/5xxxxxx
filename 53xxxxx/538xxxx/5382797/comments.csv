I didn't notice before I downloaded. If you want individual tracks you'll have to split it yourself."

It doesn't require installation, you just have to extract it.

You load the .cue file in there then choose ""save split"". Really simple. It's also a great program to use if you want to cut parts out of songs/tracks without re-encoding the file(so you won't lose quality).


Oh, also it doesn't say what VBR setting it was ripped on in the info so for anyone wondering:


Sample Rate 44.1 KHz{CR}
Sample Size 16 bit
Bit Rate 185 kbps
Encoder LAME 3.97 
Encoder Settings Variable Bit Rate  -V 2  (Standard)"
