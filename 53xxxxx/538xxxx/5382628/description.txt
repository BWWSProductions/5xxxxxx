The original Seed is DVD which is no use for video DJ use, so I have spend a half day splitting the Vobs into tracks and tagging them so this lot is good to go.

Vol One of Three, some quite rare stuff too still to come and seeding T1 at 20mpbs on a fibre optic backbone connection, so you should max out your download speed if you know what you are doing on Bit Torrent (very few do IMO!)

Video MPEG2 4:3 Ratio some black and white
VHS quality
