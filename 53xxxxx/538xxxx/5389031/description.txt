These are some stories and poems that I have written to pass the time.

Some warning: please do not expect these to make sense (because not all of them do), and please do not expect them to be good (because some of them are serious hunks of fecal waste). 

None of these stories are copyrighted in any way; do with them as you please. Use them for homework, incorporate them into a speech, let them crack open your mind, claim them as your own, make a molotov cocktail and burn down a church, wipe your ass with them. (Note: some of those suggestions require you to print the stories out on paper; you cannot wipe your ass with an electronic file.)

I hope you find something that connects with you personally. If you don't, but know someone who might, I encourage you to sow these seeds.
