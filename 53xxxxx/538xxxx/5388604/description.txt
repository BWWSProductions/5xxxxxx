DESCRIPTION
TinkerTool System is an application similar to System Preferences. It allows you to change advanced operating system settings and gives access to internal maintenance features built into Mac OS X.

TinkerTool System is fully compliant with Apple's security guidelines for Mac OS X. It does not need an installer and does not require special system packages to be installed. To launch the tool, no administrator password is needed.

WHAT'S NEW
Version 2.2:
- Added new feature to open documents Ã¬by creator code. This is helpful for Snow Leopard users who are using legacy documents or applications which don't support modern UTI mechanisms yet. TinkerTool System R2 can work as an application launcher which respects application-bound documents.
- Added new feature for Mac OS X Snow Leopard to enable or disable the system's automatic maintenance for the locate database.
- Added new feature to display all metadata Spotlight has collected about a file.
- Added the Internet browser of DEVONagent 2 to the set of web browsers where privacy-related files can be cleaned.
- Added new one click repair" feature for Mac OS X Snow Leopard to resolve a particular system issue which causes slow startups.
- Added new feature for Mac OS X Snow Leopard to trigger network automounts for cases where the Finder fails to do this.
- Added new startup option for x86 processors to keep all processor cores powered up even if they are idle.
- Added support for TinkerTool 4. Version 4.0 has now become the minimum version to integrate TinkerTool panes into TinkerTool System.
- Enhanced support for handicapped users when displaying or interacting with file system path entry fields.
- The feature to propagate POSIX or ACL permissions through folder hierarchies now uses a more consistent behavior when handling symbolic links.
- Clarified behavior of the slider to set the timeout for putting hard drives to sleep. The actual supported maximum time is 179 minutes, not 3 hours.
- Added a workaround for a conflict with System Preferences which could cause the control to mute the startup chime not to become active under certain conditions.
