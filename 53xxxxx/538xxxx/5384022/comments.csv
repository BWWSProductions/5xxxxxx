,RMJ13,2010-02-22T11:13Z,another nice fps???    lol   If you havent played a game since 2001 !   this game is JUNK!   WORST GRAPHICS  OF THE year AWARD!   the ORIGINAL  CALL OF DUTY  looks better! 
[V],globeplus,2010-02-22T11:36Z,"Why you resolved to express your feelings in my file ? 
 the true is that this game is a nice first person shooter and is many users out there that don´t mind to play the game . "
,AZkiller7,2010-02-22T16:36Z,"that's right globe, Hi 5
probably there're even a bunch of people that still play tetris on the Commodore64"
[V],globeplus,2010-02-22T22:15Z,"Thank you for the comments , but i reacted because i think the graphics are acceptable , maybe not fantastic graphics and i understand the users counting probably with better but saying that they are the worst graphics is really a little bit too much , you still have understanble nice cenarios and the movement can look a little strange but after get used to the gameplaying is ok ... Thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-02-23T00:57Z,"To Titikab . who are you ? and what you want anyway ? you normaly come to my files talking like an expert complaining about things , i ask to myself what is your profit acting like that , go borring your mama or something . lol "
[V],globeplus,2010-02-23T03:19Z,You are a morron with no respect for uploaders just get out of my files once for all !!!
,neodubbz,2010-02-23T15:43Z,"to titikab... dude who gives a fuck about you teaching ppl english?! who the fuck are you anyway to come here and open your ass with stupid bullshit you dicklover, the guy is doing a great job,actualy 1 of the greatest uploaders there is. he could be german,polish,sweedish,chinese..watever , you understand me fucking moron?
if you dont like  it, get the fuck out and go to some language grammar teaching shit forum,you fucking noob. "
[V],globeplus,2010-02-24T03:03Z,"Thank you for your comments but this user normaly come to my files only to criticate no matter if the file is ok or not and he have a obcecated atitude for other concorrence files , so this other files he come to here to borring my files more as possible and with that he feels ok about his prefered files , i think with the best of the intention that if more positive files are available , the possible users have more files to choose , when you go to a supermarket and you want some type of product that you really like , it is nice to see more options as possible with different prices then you can choose what is the product you want , so i don´t think beeing disrepecting other concorrence files will improve the ones that we are defending and it is not a correct atitude at all . Thank you again and long live the pluralism in choosing files ."
[V],globeplus,2010-02-25T00:06Z,"If it wasn´t for the persistent borring way of this user criticizing no matter what my files i answered correctly to the designated interpelation but even in this situation i can explain .
What it will be the correct word to define the analysis of the playing of the game ? I have write really like this ""analysis to the playing of the game"" or i can simply say gameplaying of the game and who reads the presentation of the file get the picture immediatly about what i am talking about , now post this my explication of the word , i ask what it will be the correct pratical word to define the analysis of the playing of a game  ? Any suggestions in words that i can use to pratical define the designated continuous action inserted in a games context , will be welcome . Thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-02-26T14:27Z,Thank you for your concern titikab but just stop putting comments in my files !!!
,rubak0,2010-02-27T13:24Z,"What is going on ,is this a circus.This area is for comments on uploads not for your personal shit."
,powerchord,2010-03-07T01:37Z,"Great Upload Globe! Keep up the great work!

@ titikab Why do you bother engaging in forum text battles? No one wins and you clutter up the forum with useless crap. Just drop it. Your opinion on the game DOES NOT reflect the quality of the upload. Why cant we all just get along?"
,powerchord,2010-03-09T00:12Z,"Hello Globe, Im having some issues wthh this game.
