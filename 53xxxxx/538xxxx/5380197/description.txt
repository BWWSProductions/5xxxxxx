Weeee daaawgeeee, if ya love watchin' crazed rednecks wile away their days by shootin' tiny defenseless furry creatures to smithereens while justifying it as being in the service of humanity, then pop open a can of lube and grab yourself a pack of tissues, it's fappin' time! 

Product info:

"Let's face it, prairie dogs are a nuisance, costing farmers and ranchers millions of dollars each year. These costs are passed along to consumers in higher food prices. These varmints need to be "controlled" and rather than use poison that would pollute the water, many farmers and ranchers choose to have them shot. Watch this exciting video containing over 500 confirmed, exploding kills. Plus, learn how to approach landowners to hunt on private property."

Rip Info

A/V quality is nothing to write home about: the audio has a slight distorted hiss, and I left the video undercropped on the right side since the frame keeps shifting. If anyone has a better quality copy, and/or Part Two, don't hesitate to up that shit! :)

Please do share this file on other trackers, usenet, ed2k, and everywhere else. Share the rare!

This was originally upped to T3, but was banned from there :P. Enjoy!
