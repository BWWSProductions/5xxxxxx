"Live With Architect Richard Gage"

We discuss Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, the organization Richard Gage has founded, and celebrate its milestone achievement of over 1,000 signatures of architects and engineers calling for a new investigation into the events of September 11th.  

A press conference and luncheon featuring speakers Richard Gage, Dr. Steven Jones and Dr. David Ray Griffin, will mark this extraordinary achievement on Friday, February 19, 2010 at the Marines' Memorial Club and Hotel at 609 Sutter Street in San Francisco starting at 11:00am.  


This event will be live streamed at http://www.ae911truth.org 



================================================

"Guns & Butter" investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, "Guns & Butter: The Economics of Politics" reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
