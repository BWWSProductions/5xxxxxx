Quality: 10 / 10. Couldn't ask for better.
Album: 9 / 10. Personally, I preferred Slania, but this is by no means a bad album. Definitely one for the fans of the band.

Extras: Very good. Torrent has album art, including CD art and scanned-in pages from the booklet. 

There, information. Have fun."

Great quality.

Fantastic album. Thanks!"

You can tell they are changing alot.

It's not the bands fault though, almost every band that Nuclear Blast Europe touches turns to shit very quickly.

Case in point: In Flames
We all know Claymen was their last good album
And it was their last album not published by Nuclear Blast Europe.

RIP future Eluveitie"

As if to say, writing music must be conformed to previous works or they are somehow slighted by not sounding the same. As if to say the band is enslaved to releasing music for one group or type of people rather than writing + playing their own creations. stfu Aus."

In flames is still releasing quality tracks. Not every album they create can compare with their masterpieces. Put things in perspective."
