Lang.:         English
Discs:         1
Image:         MDS/ISO
Genre.:        Action, Sci-Fi.
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 


Compressed with 7Zip, Game was tested and works.


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

And here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description:

The game begins in large urban area. The night is young and a heat wave has spread across the city. A light rain sprinkles the ground as a large figure jumps across the roof tops, landing with the massive thumps of a large inhuman creature. The Predator has been wounded and now seeks to return to his ship before the humans find him and kill him. Thus is the opening for Predator: Concrete Jungle.

The game begins in 1930 and moves on to the year 2030 as the player controls a Predator from a third-person view in expansive levels. The Predator's arsenal includes a staff, maul, glaive, explosive mines, spear gun, and a set of claws that appear from the forearm. With those weapons the player is able to skin, slice, stab, crush, and mangle the many enemies in the game, ultimately hunting the alpha male whose skull would make a worthy prize.


Features:

* Experience the hunt from the perspective of the Predator â€“ kill at will or hunt
  with honor. 

* Original story ties into established Predator mythology, including back story
  about the origins of the Weyland-Yutani empire. 

* Arsenal of quintessential Predator weapons such as wristblades, plasmacaster, 
  combistick, speargun and smart disk.

* Highly responsive combat system that enables the Predator to stylize its attack 
  moves for different prey.

* Four different vision modes to enhance the hunting experience: Thermal Scan, 
  Neural Scan, Prey Scan, and Tech Scan.

* City environments of the "concrete jungle" are the perfect hunting grounds for 
  the Predator.
