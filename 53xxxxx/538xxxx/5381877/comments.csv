,MyCPUGuy,2010-02-21T23:50Z,"Won't install on Windows 7.. Pity.. Gives missing required script file -error (error 3).  Tried using troubleshoot compatibility mode, to install with Windows Vista and XP settings-- no luck.  Instead, went to the corp. site, and requested a demo copy. Should have link in 24 hours.  Will post if I can get this to install over the top (and crack their demo version).  -- Thanks anyway!"

,sh.aviate,2010-02-25T18:18Z,guys... ur inputs please... suggestions welcome
,MyCPUGuy,2010-02-27T07:55Z,"I did try to install on 2 machines using the setup files.  I followed the instructions to the letter- and got the same error both times. - ""missing script file"" - I'm going to try to download this again, and if I can install it- I will post.  Comments would be great.  Also- I DID get my hands on a demo of the retail / consumer version (it's a process as you have to deal with a sales rep for about 2 days).  That DID install- and this software is Excellent.  - Are you running the Dell version? I thought that may be the problem, as I'm not installing on a Dell- and I'm using Win 07 - x86 -- NOT x64.  Great software either way.. I love it. I hope to get yours to work, as my trial will expire in about 50 days."

,Ariusjc,2010-03-17T01:34Z,"I don't know what to say. i were searching over the internet to download a compatible version of FastAccess on my Dell Studio 1555 which got windows 7 Ultimate.
Dell official webpage doesn't have the previous version of FA which your torrent has that and  it won't start by installing only that (which i think is sufficient for win xp) but is the base to install the update which will work wonderful .
Anyhow, My friend i think here i should thank you for your very very useful software.
Download this torrent and enjoy the FA on your windows seven.
regards.
Arius."

,xuburant,2010-04-25T05:00Z,I have Win7 and it did not work for me. It had me close my antivirus (dumb move) and then it gave me error -3. Oh well. Maybe when they release a new version I'll be lucky enough to use it.
