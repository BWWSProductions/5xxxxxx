Bryan Peterson - Learning to See Creatively: Design, Color & Composition in Photography

Bryan Peterson is probably my most influential teacher whom I've learned tons from via his books and video.  His teaching style and ability to easily communicate new knowledge in an easily approachable method are key to learning the craft.  Whenever I start working with a new photog, the FIRST set of books and video I point them to are ALWAYS from Bryan!

My recommendation is to use all of his offerings:
The Perfect Picture                -  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5333457 
Learning to See Creatively         -  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5383729 
Understanding Exposure             -  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3899818 
Understanding Shutter Speed        -  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5383482 
Understanding Close Up Photography -  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5384888 

and you will be well on your way to being a photographer!  :)

Almost everyone can "see" in the conventional sense, but developing photographic vision takes practice. Learning to See Creatively helps photographers visualize their work, and the world, in a whole new light.

Now totally rewritten, revised, and expanded, this best-selling guide takes a radical approach to creativity. It explains how it is not some gift only for the "chosen few" but actually a skill that can be learned and applied. Using inventive photos from his own stunning portfolio, author and veteran photographer Bryan Peterson deconstructs creativity for photographers. He details the basic techniques that went into not only taking a particular photo, but also provides insights on how to improve upon itâ€”helping readers avoid the visual pitfalls and technical dead ends that can lead to dull, uninventive photographs.

This revised edition features the latest information on digital photography and digital imaging software, as well as an all-new section on color as a design element. Learning to See Creatively is the definitive reference for any photographers looking for a fresh perspective on their work.

About the Author
Bryan Peterson, a professional photographer, is the author of Understanding Exposure, Beyond Portraiture, Learning to See Creatively, and Understanding Digital Photography. A well-known instructor, he is the founder of the online school The Perfect Picture School of Photography (www.ppsop.com).  He is also the best-selling author of Understanding Exposure, Learning to See Creatively, Understanding Shutter Speed, Understanding Close-Up Photography, Understanding Digital Photography, Beyond Portraiture, and, most recently, Bryan Peterson's Understanding Photography Field Guide. His easy-to-understand writing and teaching style breaks down the complex and often confusing aspects of photography, translating them into what his students routinely describe as "aha" moments. In addition, he has been a commercial photographer for over 30 years, shooting annual reports for many Fortune 500 companies, and his trademark use of color and strong, graphic composition have garnered him many photographic awards, including the New York Art Director's Gold Award and honors from Communication Arts and Print magazine. He currently splits his time between Chicago and France.

Personal addition:  He has also managed to marry one totally SMOKING hot wife, whom I can only guess he met while on a photo assignment...  or at least, that's what it would imply as while he's a terrific instructor/author, and a FABULOUS photographer, he's certainly not what one would call "classically handsome" so if you want to meet a model and have them be impressed with your work and set yourself apart from the GWC (Guy With Camera) gaggle, take a hint from Bryan and become the kind of photographer that stands out apart from the rest and learn all you can from his books and video.  Then, I would recommend practice practice practice for 6-12 months, and then see about signing up for his online School with a solid foundation in the fundamentals and see where he might take you to the next level!  Who knows, before you know it, you just might one day find yourself also in the category of "How in the world did a guy like THAT, manage to get himself a gal like a HER?!?!?!" :)
