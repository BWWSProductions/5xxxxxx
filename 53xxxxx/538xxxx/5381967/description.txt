Revolution is the third album of the Swedish band BAD HABIT. Originally released in 1995 via Megarock, the record turned into a collector's item over the years. In 2003 the album got re-released under the title "Revolution r.e.d.u.x.", but many fans are still in search for a copy. With the 2009 re-release they finally get another chance to fill the gap in their collection. The re-release is limited to 500 copies and features two bonus tracks: an alternative version of BAD HABIT's first single "Need Somebody" and a cover version of the BALANCE classic "In For The Count". Both songs were recorded in 1989 and match well with the sound and style of the original tracks. Revolution is definitely BAD HABIT's heaviest album to date and comparable with TREAT, ALIEN and STAGE DOLLS of that time. This album is recommended to all the lovers of Scandinavian Melodic Rock and AOR.
