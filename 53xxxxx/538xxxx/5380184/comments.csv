,jon4fun,2010-02-21T02:57Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

I won't start downloading this yet as I see a huge amount of leechers and only 1 (presumably you) seed.

Please seed people and don't choke the bandwidth.
Do you know the message of this particular movie? 
Don't be GREEDY & SHARE!

Cheers
Jon"

Thank you very much 20/40.
I think Michael Moore would 
be quite proud of us.At least we
waited for the DVD."
,jon4fun,2010-02-21T04:01Z,"@lilars26: You know I have a feeling that Michael Moore would be proud in one way in particular.
I saw him on an internview on Real Time with Bill Maher (about this movie) and he was 'rather annoyed' about rampnant capiltalism and top down trickle economics.

I haven't seen this movie yet but MM was always for the 'little man' and P2P is certainly a strike at rampant capitalism.

Except, of course, for those capitalist H&R scum.

Dare I say the word, P2P is socialism. 

Ah!!! The tea-baggers are outside with mis-spelt placards and burning effigies of ... sorry can't make out what the effigies are supposed to represent. These people really need to take a craft class.

My two cents.

Jon
P.S. I apologise to 20-40 and everyone, I just couldn't resist and I think I'm much funnier than I actually am. 

Stay shiny."

I think we may have similar mindsets.
Trickle down economics doesn't work
so good for the guy on the bottom.And
don't get me started on teaparties.If
you want a political rant,this is the torrent
to do it on,so thank you.
