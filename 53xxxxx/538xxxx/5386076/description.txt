Release Notes:

Ditching the â€œliveâ€ method of recording that hallmarked Frightened
Rabbitâ€™s 2008â€™s sophomore release Midnight Organ Fight, 2010â€™s The
Winter of Mixed Drinks is described by vocalist/guitarist Scott
Hutchison as â€œa real studio effort. Everything has been separately
recorded and thatâ€™s the way I like to make records.â€ Mixed Drinks
follows a fictional protagonist, possibly male, through the highs and
lows of a breakdown. Kick-off single â€œSwim Until you See Landâ€ finds
the Scottish lads toying with a more polished production as the song
swells into a chant-along â€œare you a man or are you a bag of sand?â€

Deluxe edition including 2 bonus tracks.
