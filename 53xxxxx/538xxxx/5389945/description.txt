My first movie torrent - the source was http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4117133/Cannibal.Holocaust.1980.WS.DVDRip.XViD.iNT-EwDp i think, but no promises.

It was converted with EncodeHD, a FREE encoder that is available here -  http://dcunningham.net/media-tools/encodehd/ - with the iPod Touch preset.

Comments are appreciated, even if they are criticism.

Cannibal Holocaust is a well known exploitation film because of the controversy following its release. After premiering in Italy, the film was seized by a local magistrate, and Deodato was arrested on obscenity charges. He was later accused of making a snuff film due to rumors which claimed that certain actors were killed on camera. Although Deodato was later cleared of these charges, the film was banned in Italy, the UK, Australia, and several other countries due to its graphic depiction of gore, sexual violence, and the inclusion of six genuine animal deaths. Many nations have since revoked the ban, yet the film is still barred in several countries. This notoriety notwithstanding, some critics view Cannibal Holocaust as a social commentary about civilized society.
