       This release contains ~13 mins of footage than KYRs release. Additionally, ESPN     
       inserted ~7 mins of ads into this feed, meaning KYRs release is missing around 20   
       minutes of footage total. If anybody feels this release is nuke worthy then I       
       apologise for wasting your bandwidth.
