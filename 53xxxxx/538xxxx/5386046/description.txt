Yes, its made to make you cry aka motivate, for a good reason.

Getting this song for free or just listening it online is easy, so is supporting Haiti victims.
Remember, any amount helps. Redcross around the globe is one of the most reliable ways to support.
You can always use the redcross of your own country, just google "redcross".

You might think "that 5$ wont help anything", but if a thousand people think the other way, many Haitian families will get their home back or that 4 years old starving boy somewhere in the crisis-area might get hes first meal for weeks because you decided to support.
