                 - Si On Avait Besoin D'Une Cinquieme Saison -

==================================================================================
...the album revolves around a seasonal concept: the first four songs each covers one of the traditional four seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn/Fall, and Winter), whilst the final track, the 17-minute long "Histoires Sans Paroles", represents the imaginary fifth season. "Dixie" is also a notable track because of Locat's unforgettable piano solo. Si on avait besoin d'une cinquiÃƒÂ¨me saison, while a transitional album, became an influential album in Quebec's music history...
