""The Palm Reader"" is a very modern serial. It has 10 episodes and is 470 minutes in total.
If you are able to stop watching this once you start, you will be the first person I know that was able to do that.

This movie has Russian subtitles and no other language subtitles.

It's about Sergei whose father left the family when he was a small boy. His father was a palm reader and leaves Segei his book on palm reading when he dies. The book is delivered to him by an stranger who was a friend of his father. From that day on Sergei's life takes on a whole new direction and the series is about what happens after that moment."
