The dark mysteries of power revealed. The other day group VoMiT released this 4 part documentary series called â€œSecret Societiesâ€. Donâ€™t know which category this belongs to, I will put it in the movie session.

Behind closed doors, cliques of the worldâ€™s most powerful men form societies so secret and controversial that their very names spark fear in our hearts and minds: the Freemasons, the Illuminati, Skull and Bones. What are the intentions of these secret societies? Are the members of these brotherhoods the innocent victims of mudslinging conspiracy theorists or are they untouchable elitists who control the world? One way to find out is to explore their mysterious and covert histories in this illuminating DVD set.
