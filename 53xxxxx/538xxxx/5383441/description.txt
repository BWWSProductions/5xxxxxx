Release Date  :  16 October 2009 (USA)
Release Length:  1h 41mn
Storyline: 
 An adolescent named Max has an active imagination, and he will throw fits if others don't go along with
 what he wants. Max - following an incident with Claire (his sister) and her friends, and following a
 tantrum which he throws as a result of his Mother paying more attention to her boyfriend than to him - 
 runs away from home. Wearing his wolf costume at the time, Max not only runs away physically, but runs
 toward a world in his imagination. This world, an ocean away, is inhabited by large wild beasts, including
 one named Carol who is much like Max himself in temperament. Instead of eating Max like they normally
 would with creatures of his type, the wild things befriend Max after he proclaims himself a king who
 can magically solve all their problems.
