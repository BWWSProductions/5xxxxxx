,oldSMfan,2010-02-24T07:16Z,"Nice GreatMagician. Great work! Beautiful quality!

:O)"
,LCG1138,2010-03-11T17:36Z,"The original file was not recognized by my PS3 Slim (having had no previous problems with .mp4 files, apart from Batman Begins/Dark Knight, but I think that's to do with the IMAX camera/aspect ratio, another story!), so i used tsMuxer to try and correct this (using both the TSMuxing and T2SMuxing options), which allowed PS3Slim to recognize the file and play the video, but with no audio.. Anyone had same problem? Fix?"
,LCG1138,2010-03-11T17:37Z,"Sorry, that was meant to be TS Muxing and M2TS Muxing options."
,supertrixxan,2010-03-12T01:00Z,Is GreatMagician = SecretMyth?
,sy8,2010-03-16T23:49Z,"Heads up, does not work on PS3slim, says ""unsupported data"".

I wouldn't mind converting it if the description didn't say ""PS3 & Xbox ... Compatible"""
,jktrigger,2010-04-15T09:39Z,"Thank you GreatMagician, amazing quality as always!"

,fartylips,2010-12-16T03:58Z,Thanks GM...very nice A10 V10 :-)
,cryskonig,2011-09-28T21:31Z,Why does everyone want to watch movies on a PS3? Connect your tv to your pc via hdmi and watch a movie...... 
,SatisMaMa,2011-11-03T04:47Z,Sorry but this wasn't compatible on my 360. I like streaming from my comp to the 360 especially for family movies! Thanks anyway
