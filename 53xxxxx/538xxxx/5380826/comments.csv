,don139,2010-03-09T20:45Z,"peace im 16 y o
and im into dnb since end 2008
and into dubstep since beginning 2009 =)
i really like this sample ive got it like one week after it was up

but ive got one question to all ya junglists warez-guys and dubheadz out there

how do you sort your music ?

because i use itunes and do it like this:
example on this torrent
1. load all files into itunes
2. mark all loaded music
3. name it to ""Dubstep 2010 ""
4. change album artist to ""various artist""
5. search in google for ""Dubstep 2010 "" and take a funny or cool pic for cover

so i have all the music from this torrent on one album and not so many separate icons in itunes

but im not as happy as i want with this method
how do you manage this better ??? "

,FireFight9,2010-03-15T10:45Z,"@don139
i usually make an iTunes playlist named just say ""Dubstep 2010"" and throw it on shuffle and bam, i'm good to go."
,don139,2010-03-21T22:42Z,"bro thats not cool =(
