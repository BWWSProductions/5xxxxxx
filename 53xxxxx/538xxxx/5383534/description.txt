This is the 2nd album from the band Wolfmother, titled The Cosmic Egg. I ripped this directly from a CD into iTunes as Apple Lossless (high-quality m4v). This is zipped using Winzip (sorry about this but I didn't know how else to upload folders into 1 torrent) and is separated into Disc 1 and Disc 2.

There are 16 tracks total:

Disc 1

1. California Queen
2. New Moon Rising
3. White Feather
4. Sundial
5. In the Morning
6. 10,000 Feet
7. Cosmic Egg
8. Far Away

10. Pilgrim
11. Eyes Open
12. Back Round
13. In the Castle
14. Caroline

Enjoy!
