,OompahLoompah108,2010-02-24T04:26Z,"Thank you so much for this. By the way, for those of you who read these comments, some troll(s) come(s) here and post fake spoilers. Please do not be alarmed as they usually turn out fake. But be cautious anyway.

Lost rocks!"

what kinda spoilers could anyone post that isnt already fairly obvious its the last season if ya havent figured out the spoilers yet you must be dull this season is just wrapping up the loose ends "
,OompahLoompah108,2010-02-24T05:24Z,"Well, let's not jump to conclusions who's dull (^_^).  Last week, and the week before that, there were foilers about the episode of the week posted in the comments section (check it out by searching last week's episode).  There were statements like ""omg I cant believe Ben dies!"" or ""the MIB is Aaron wtf.""  I didn't really buy it, but so many people responded angrily as if they believed the one giving the foiler.  Since it seems like an ongoing trend I posted this as a courtesy, in case someone does."

,stoobloke,2010-02-24T23:04Z,OompahLoompah's point was that they were *not* spoilers... think that proves OL isn't the idiot
