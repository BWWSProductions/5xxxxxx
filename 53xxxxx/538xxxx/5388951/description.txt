Harry Harrison's story about corruption, power and war.
Says near as much as Catch 22, but in plainer prose, half
the space, and with double the laughs. A work of genius.

Summarised from the BBC's 1984 blurb: Read by Kerry Shale
supported by elaborate sound effects and electronic music
for added dramatic impact. Kerry Shale trained in Canada,
but has been based in Britain since 1978.
