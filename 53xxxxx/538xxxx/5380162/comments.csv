,Clerk13,2010-02-21T19:51Z,Finally!! A BDS II torrent that isn't some crappish PPV rip. I have recommended this torrent to many friends so hopefully more people will download this one.
,CherryxDarling,2010-02-24T16:07Z,"A: 10 V: 10 

This torrent is better quality than other ones I've downloaded from here. Thanks raymondhome.

Anyone recognize the short dude (don't want to spoil anything in anyway...)? He's fucking Tucker from Are You Afraid of the Dark. I kept thinking to myself during the movie where the hell do I know him from? But yeah, seriously, anyone from my generation that used to watch Nick at Nite will definitely know what I'm talking about.
