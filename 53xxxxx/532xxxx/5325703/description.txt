Heartland S03E14: The Happy List

In this episode, Ty purchases a vintage Norton motorcycle - with Jack's endorsement - while Caleb goes off to a rodeo in Montana despite Ashleyâ€™s growing concerns about his life on the circuit. Lou is obsessive in her attempt to out-do Peterâ€™s first wedding, which causes some serious second thoughts about their engagement.

Also, Val decides to return to show jumping and enlists Amy's help, while Mallory learns that Jake has not exactly been pining away while she has been ignoring him.

This episode was written by Heather Conkie and directed by Chris Potter! You will not see Tim in this episode but Chris was behind the cameras the entire time directing this episode of Heartland.


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Jan 31, 2010. 

The next new episode will be in March (due to the Super Bowl and Olympics). The last 4 new episodes of the season will air from March 7 to March 28. That is going to have to tide everyone over until Season 4 premieres in the fall. Yes, the rumours are true - there is going to be a Season 4, which will begin filming in the spring.
