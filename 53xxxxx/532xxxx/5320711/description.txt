Oh, how I love exploring a theme! This session uses confusion techniques, some blatant, some more subtle, to bully your brain into surrender. Do you often find that you have difficulty filling yourself with hypnotic instructions enough to empty yourself of anything else? This induction is unique and challenging enough for the most resistant, over-thinking minds. These techniques are particularly designed for a very intelligent and eager Treasure audience.

And once youâ€™ve been whirled about and pummeled into trance, I have some important training for you on the topic of confusion. Because I know how good and confident you feel when you have a very clear understanding of how much you need and want me. The more desperate you feel, the less confusion you feel, the happier and safer you are, isnâ€™t that right, Treasure? In fact, any time you feel less that simply certain about expressing unrestrained adoration for me, itâ€™s sadly confusing. Donâ€™t worry, just listen to â€œConfusionâ€ and I will get you all sorted out!

â€œConfusionâ€ is the first in what I anticipate will be a collection of recordings I think of as â€œHypnoQuickiesâ€. An HQ is going to have three important characteristics: 1) High replayability â€” the training and instructions involved will have a lot of solid repeat value; 2) Moderate length â€” between 30 and 40 minutes; 3) Guided release â€” the program incorporates orgasm as a training tool.
