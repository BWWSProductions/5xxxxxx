As many of you know, in the original release of this album, the tracks "Bad Romance", "Monster", "Dance in the Dark", and "Teeth" contained censored lyrics. This release contains the full uncensored tracks. No more free "bit".

The original release of the track "Teeth" had the word "shit" uncensored, but "bitch" was missing the "b" sound. In my previous upload of this album, that track was still partially censored. Thank you, DLBeLL84 for pointing out that there was an uncensored version of "Teeth" availible.

This is the second version of this upload, the first one didn't have the explicit version of "Teeth".

The explicit tracks are from the Amazon MP3 Store, and the other tracks were encoded by me from Bubanee's FLAC upload of the original release.

Amazon encodes its tracks at ~256 kbit/s, and I encoded the other tracks in LAME at VBR -V 0. All tracks have a bitrate of ~260 kbit/s.

Enjoy!
