Fully updated chapters of Full Metal Alchemist manga from chapter 1 to 103. Watch out for the latest chapter 104 which would be coming out 10 Feb 2010. Fans, keep your eyes peeled on http://www.onemanga.com ^_^  Due to licensing restrictions FMA isn't downloadable on these manga sites, you can only read them online. Thats really frustrating if you want to take it on a PC offline and read it peacefully (and without that IM window popping up of course). So I made this. 

I only collected the images, grouped them, zipped them and renamed their extensions. All thanks go to the original 'scanlet'ors :)

87 chapters are in lossless png format, the rest in normal jpeg format. You can use any comic book reader supporting cbz format. I use coview. This page on wikipedia describes what is a comic book reader and also links to some of them http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Book_Archive_file

If you don't want any extra software then you can just open these files in your Compression utility like WinZip, WinRAR, 7Z etc.

Keep seeding and enjoy!
