,grieferiksson,2010-04-17T17:45Z,"^ GAZZA2008 makes an eloquent point.  I've seeded this torrent to a ratio of 30.339 (25.0 GB) and where are all those peers now? Chronic leechers need to learn how a community works!  You take a little and you GIVE SOME BACK.  Its called ""file SHARING"" not ""file taking"".  Especially in cases like this torrent, where you've got an excellent independent film that you will *never* find in Blockbuster, and it just needs just a little support to get healthy.  FFS and people wonder why private trackers are so elitist."
