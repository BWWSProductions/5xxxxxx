I am back with more great music from the 80's. This time I am posting 8 records instead of the normal 4 records due to my long hiatus. I hope you like some of them, if not all for sure. The record, The Wild Swans - Music And Talk From Liverpool, is dedicated to Liverpool, a city with lots of fantastic and talented bands, now and then.
