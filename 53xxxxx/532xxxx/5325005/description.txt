Audio Book the Witching Hour by Anne Rice

Read by Lindsay Crouse

Demonstrating once again her gift for spellbinding stoyrtelling, Anne Rice makes real a family of witches--a family given to poetry and incest, to murder and philsophy, a family that is itself haunted by a powerful, dangerous and seductive being.

Abridged to 3 hours.
