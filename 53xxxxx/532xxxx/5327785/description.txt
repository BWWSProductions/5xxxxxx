                    Sacrifice.                               
                    Drama based on the hit US show. DS Ronnie  
                    Brooks and DS Matt Devlin investigate a  
                    shocking crime in which a man is attacked and  
                    has his kidney removed. Suspecting organ  
                    trafficking, they discover that the kidney was  
                    earmarked to be transplanted into a wealthy  
                    recipient. When the case comes to court, Crown  
                    Prosecutors James Steele and Alesha Phillips  
                    are surprised to find a familiar face leading  
                    the defence team, and realise that the crux of  
                    the issue is the question of how far one should  
                    go to help a loved one.
