MacunaÃ­ma is a black native from the forests of Brazil in this satirical comedy. When he bathes in a magic stream, he is turned into a white man. He goes into town and becomes the lover of a female revolutionary. She is killed by her own time bomb and her good-luck charm is found by an Italian. The man becomes a millionaire. MacunaÃ­ma goes to visit the lucky man and almost ends up on the menu. He returns to the jungle where he is abandoned by his followers and family for lying about food. The once-fortunate man sits alone as he tells his story to the only creature who will listen, a parrot. (from [url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/macunama-141048]AllMovie[/url])
