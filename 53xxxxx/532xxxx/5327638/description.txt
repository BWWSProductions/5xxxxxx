This film is the story of a group of unruly teenagers whose parents send them to a rehabilitation Boot camp (correctional) to turn them around. The camp collects each child individually, then delivers them to the boot camp facility on a remote island in Fiji. There are no walls to stop the teenagers from leaving, but escape is impractical due to the surrounding sea. On arriving at the camp, the teenagers are forced to wear cuffs with sensors around their ankles â€” if they attempt to escape, security will be alerted.

Dr. Hail (Peter Stormare), who runs the camp, forces the teens to work constantly. He has them clean the camp, grow plants, and has them rebuild the camp after it was damaged in a storm. Campers are required to wear color coded t-shirts. First, new arrivals are given black t-shirts. They progress to yellow and then white. The teens earn a white shirt once they have been "corrected." They do not do work; they become staff members and abuse the other inmates and monitor their work. Among the staff is an ex-Army recruit. He is very tough towards the inmates and makes deals with girls in exchange for sex.
