Featuring a relatively large number of musicians, this record shows how Simon's view of the PCO had changed since volume 1. Possibly as a result of Simon's experience of orchestration with 'Still Life' At the Penguin CafÃ© (volume 6) he felt confident enough to write new pieces for large sections. 

Nevertheless, this record retains the intimacy and charm of all previous works, featuring a recording of the electric Aeolian harp on Cadbury Hill, Somerset, and a piece dedicated to the memory of John Cage recorded at the Real World recording week in 1992. 

A very diverse record, an image painted on a broader canvas.

From Glasgow Herald 
"Penguin CafÃ© Orchestra are a logically illogical blend of learning and instinct; technique and natureâ€¦" 

From Johnny Black 
"Penguin CafÃ© music combines orchestral instruments with folk instruments, classical ideas with electronic rhythms, stately melodies with a nice sense of swing. As a result although Jeffes considers himself "an eccentric English composer" his CDs are mostly filed under 'rock'â€¦"
