[T],CHD242522,2010-02-16T10:59Z,Enjoy guys! :)
,swinburne,2010-02-16T11:43Z,there are 9 episodes.. where is the 9th episode?
,Glen_Quagmire,2010-02-16T22:44Z,While I appreciate the effort the episodes barely work.  They keep crashing my VLC player and they constantly start and stop repeatedly as they play.  It's probably because they are encoded with such insanely high video kbps that my computer can't run it.

Seems there are only eight. From the official website:

"". . .Halo Legends, a seven-story anthology - told across eight spectacular episodes ? that explores the origin and historical events of the Halo universe and its intriguing characters."""
,swinburne,2010-02-17T20:29Z,"the episodes are: 
""The Babysitter""	
""The Duel""	
""The Package""	part 1 & 2
""Origins""	part 1 & 2
""Homecoming""	
""Prototype""	
""Odd One Out""	

there can only be 8 episodes if either the 2 parts of package or origins is in the same video....

can anyone confirm this???"
,Azbulldog,2010-02-18T08:09Z,"The episodes in this torrent are:

,BooDaddy,2010-02-20T16:29Z,WTF?  English subtitles for English audio? What a waste?  The stupid subtitles ruined this download for me.
,scooterbaga,2010-08-17T18:17Z,"I'm viewing the first episode, the subtitles are NOT hardcoded.

Great quality, thanks for the up."
,zeniht,2011-05-29T22:45Z,"retards talking shit about subtitle, it doesnt affect quality if it's not hardcoded, it's optional."
,noobsicle,2012-03-08T23:05Z,Please SEED!!!!
