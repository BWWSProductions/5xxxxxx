Here it is folks.  The movie that no one can find in Torrent land ! ! !  I looked for this movie for AGES ! ! !  And all I could find was a broken ISO.  You cant find it at Busterblock, or any of the other movie stores.  And you can rarely find it for sale anywhere.  And you DEFINATELY can't find it online.  (I've tried forever)  So I finally found it on DVD and quickly made a quality RIP and now here it is.  It's a great movie.  Ben Stiller truely outdoes hisslef.  Not a comedy but a serious role about drugs. And a true story to boot ! ! ! I tried Ripping the subs but discovered that they are actually Closed Captions and I for the life of me CANNOT figure it out.  I tried many programs but just couldn't get any to work right. (So if anyone has any ideas or tips or suggestions for me to get the CC's off of here I will add them to the torrent.)  Anyway, Been Rippng for awhile just never posted anything.  Please comment, maybe I'll do more.  If the quality wasn't excellent I wouldn't put it up.  I'm not here to waste anyone's time or bandwidth. lol.  Anyway here it is so . . . ENJOY and SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
