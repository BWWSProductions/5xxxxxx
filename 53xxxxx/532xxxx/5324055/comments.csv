February 1, 2010

After nine months of waiting, the end begins. Over the past 5 years, Lost has been one of the most watched, most cherished, and most debated shows ever. Saturday night, ABC premiered the first hour of what will be Lost's last season on the beautiful Waikiki beach in Honolulu, Hawaii. In front of over 10,000 fans, on a perfect Hawaiian day, most of the cast and crew of Lost made appearances to thank the fans for all of their support and to avoid letting any of the details of Season 6 slip out."
