Classic, burlesque black comedy about a group of men who hire some prostitutes and go to a villa in the countryside. There, they engage in group sex and resolve to eat themselves to death. In typical French fashion, the opening credits state which firms have delivered all the delicious food! In spite of its black undertones, this film always makes me hungy.

I am old enough to remember this film from its opening night controversy, and how it created a renessaince for the beauty of fat naked women.

Widescreen DVDrip XviD 2-pass 672x384, original mono sound AC3.
Runs well with or without subs in both my standalone DivX players.
My ripping procedure now produces decent quality for such a long film compressed 
into just 700 MiB.
