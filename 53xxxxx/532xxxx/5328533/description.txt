Universal activator (for any version of Windows 7, x86 and x64)
The test of time and tests!


What is Windows 7 Loader eXtreme Edition v3?
This activator, brought together a whole set of elements of the equipment used in the processes associated with activation of Windows 7:
Windows Software Licensing Management Tool - operations to activate and display information about its status.
Everest / SLIC Dump TooKit - physical verification SLIC in the BIOS.
Product Key Checker - display information about the key.
The rest of the majority of development is based on China's achievements, now adaptable for other Windows 7, but already well-known people who became to us:
OEM logo and accompanying information - Orbit30.
Loader SLIC WOW7 - Hazar.
Loader SLIC Bootmgr - stupid_user.
Loader SLIC Vistaloader 2.1.2 - used by almost everyone who is involved in the release of activators.
KMS server, accessible via the Internet - the contribution of local enthusiasts who support their work.
Choose for you the best of all varieties - the purpose of the activator, or give you the opportunity itself-choose - getting all the necessary information.
In conjunction with the original decisions of the author is allowed to expand the applicability of the activator on the whole line editions of Windows 7. However, as a rule, there are two alternative ways of activation, which dramatically increases the likelihood of a successful outcome.
