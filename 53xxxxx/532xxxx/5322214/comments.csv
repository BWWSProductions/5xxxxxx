,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-29T11:39Z,why cant movies be uploaded in its original language? are you too stupid to read? moron.
,pplot,2011-07-11T04:09Z,"I could explain the instrinsic value of the non-original language versions of chinese martial arts classics. And perhaps even get into a debate about german-made ""swedish erotica"" during the 70's. And other fields where linguistics meets the arts.
But I won't. Because it is plain to see you are not a fan of the arts."
