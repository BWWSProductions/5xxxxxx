BBC R3 - Edward Albee's 'Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?'
Directed by Cherry Cookson
Broadcast December 5, 2004
Coded from tape at 128/44.1

Play first performed on Broadway, October, 1962.

Two couples trapped in corrosive marriages descend into bitter
mutual examination in the aftermath of a drunken faculty party.

Selected for the 1963 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, however, the
prize's advisory board overruled the drama prize jury, and did
not award the drama prize that year. They said that they thought
the play too profane. But given that the prize's board were also
Trustees Of Columbia University, it's more likely that they did
not like the picture of faculty life it presented.
