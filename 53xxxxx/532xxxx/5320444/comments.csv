,DeusExMachina76,2010-01-30T17:01Z,seems to be a problem with the seed...
,dub.dk,2010-01-30T18:21Z,The problem is my incredible slow upload. But i will keep seeding.
,DeusExMachina76,2010-02-03T17:29Z,Thanks man! Would it be too much asking for this week episodes? Ferguson is my favourite and it seems I can't find anywhere even though jay leno's crap is everywhere... Thanks in advance and long live the punk puppet master! :)
