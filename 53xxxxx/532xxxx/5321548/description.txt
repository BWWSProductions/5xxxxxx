1. Getting Started:

- Download the ISO file, then either burn to CD, or install to a USB drive.
- Insert your media and reboot, making sure your PC's set to boot from either your CD or USB.
- When Puppy Arcade boots, choose your keyboard and display options to load the desktop.

2. The desktop:

- left-click on the deskop for a small 'apps' menu, with links to the most useful apps and tools
- right-click on the desktop for the full puppy menu
- you'll see an animated icon bar at the bottom, showing all the emulators available
- left-click on the emulator you want to load, then browse for a rom file.
- right-click on the emulator icons to reset/refresh the menu
- you've got a start menu, quick links menu and taskbar at the very bottom, set to auto-hide
- the wallpaper can be changed by right clicking on any image any choosing 'Set as wallpaper'
- the file manager has all the most important bookmarks added already, in the toolbar

3. The control panel:

- a tabbed navigation panel showing most of the settings and tools available
- choose the 'Gaming' tab to configure your emulators config files
- if needed, use one of the network wizards to setup your internet connection

4. Configuring emulators:

Some emulators require not only roms, but a system file too.

- Amiga: Find and download a kickstart file (kick13, kick20, kick31), put it in '/usr/lib/uae' and rename (or symlink) to 'kick.rom'.
- Commodore:You'll need to download a pack of system roms, and extract to '/usr/lib/vice/[system]'
- Prboom: get doom2.wad or freedoom.wad. You already have '/usr/share/games/doom/prboom.wad' installed

NOTES: You are not allowed to own the BIOS of any systems that you have never purchased.
Mupen64Plus also requires OpenGL (3D acceleration, see below)

5. Getting ROMs

- I cannot include roms with this release, but here are some links where you can get them:
- Rom-World.com, Romhustler.net, Emuparadise.org, Snes-O-Rama.us, CPS2 XOR Files, ROM Keeper, LemonAmiga

NOTE: You are not allowed to own the ROMs of any games released commercially, that you have never purchased.

6. Accessing your drives:

- all your storage drives can be found at '/mnt/' - but not until you 'mount' them
- left-click on the desktop and choose 'Drives' to see all your drives
- hard drives are listed as sda1, sda2, sda3 and so
- double-click on a drive to mount it, it will then open up in a file manager window
- after saving your settings (see below), you can use 'startmount' you open your drives at boot

7. Saving your settings

- choose 'pupsaveconfig' from the 'utility' menu to create your save file before you shutdown, so you don't lose any changes
- when you shutdown for the first time, you should be asked to save your session
- a nice menu should popup when you shutdown to help you create a savefile, if needed
- after creating a savefile, you will be asked whether to save to it or not, at each shutdown

8. Tips & Tricks

a. Run Puppy Arcade without a hard drive:

- After booting, you can simply replace your Puppy Arcade live-CD with a CD/DVD full of roms.
- Mount the DVD/CD drive and your roms will be available at '/mnt/sr0/'

b. Hard drive/USB install:

- Put your savefile on the same drive as your roms, and your roms will be available at '/mnt/home/path/to/your/roms'

c. Create an easy to remember ROM directory:

- You can symlink your roms folder to /roms/ - so it's easy and quick to reach them
- To do this, type 'ln -s /path/to/your/roms /roms' in the terminal

d. Use you joypad or joystick:

- Plug in your device before the Puppy Arcade deskop loads
- Your joypad will be loaded automatically and should be called '/dev/js0'
- You can now update the controller settings in your emulators to use your joypad

9. Enabling OpenGL (for 3D acceleration - only required for N64):

You'll simply need to download and install the correctpet file for your graphics card.
Then (optionally) follow the softwares' instructions and restart X.

10. Install to Hard Drive or USB (optional):

- See scottjarvis.com/page105.htm, to download the files below

- Installation is not required - you can simply boot Puppy Arcade straight from CD
- However, Puppy Arcade can also be installed using a number of easy methods:

- Install to any USB drive, using Windows: Download the ISO file and this USB installer, then follow this great guide at PendriveLinux.com
- Install to anything, using Puppy Arcade: Load the live CD, select 'Menu->Utility->Universal Installer' and follow the guide
- Install a dual-boot system, using Windows: Get the exe installer. You'll need either a FAT32, or fully-defragmented and uncompressed NTFS drive!
