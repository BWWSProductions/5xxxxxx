One of the most traumatic events in American Military history, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor fuelled national determination both to have revenge and to ensure that such a thing could never happen again. But how was such a mighty force surprised by 350 aircraft in broad daylight?

Were the Japanese brilliant strategically or just lucky? And how and why does the memory of that bloody attack in 1941 still direct US Naval military thinking today?
