Note:  Fixes some minor glitches in original encode.  This encode uses 1080p source as well.  Recycling the screenshots as its virtually unchanged from last.  Perhaps 10% better than last version in video quality.

If you already watched the original and don't plan on watching multiple times then don't waste your bandwidth.  After a while the original torrent will most likely be taken down.

Only reason I even release this is because it was nagging me and now I can sleep better at night! ;-)

WDTV users change extension from .m4v to .mp4

Apparently there is a sync problem with MP4 for WDTV Live with the latest firmware.

It is discussed here

and here 
http://community.wdc.com/t5/WD-TV-Live-Firmware/1-0-17-MP4-Audio-Sync/td-p/6146

side note:

To get the most out of HR releases you must be using Apple devices.  I recommend the new iPod nano, iPod touch, iPhone, Apple TV.  These are the platforms the releases are designed for and tested on.  Any other platform is just an added bonus.
