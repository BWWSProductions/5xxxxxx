This program is primarily meant for people who need to protect video or graphics files from illegal copying by putting a watermark 
(text or graphic information) over an image. Simple text, image file, animated GIF or video file can be used as watermark here. 
Besides, Watermark Master provides ability to apply a great number of various effects to a watermark, including dynamic effects. 
A dynamic effect implies variation of the watermark in time, for example, smooth appearance or disappearance of the watermark, 
movement of the watermark, etc.

With Watermark Master it is possible to put subtitles onto a video film. As the source one can use DVD subtitles or SRT files.

from a video or graphics file. Two functions have been developed for that purpose:

-blurring the object - in this case the object is simply blurred according to the specified blur parameters
-removing the object - in this case the object is removed, and the removed pixels are compensated with the pixels adjacent to the removed object.
