Alexander III of Macedon (356â€“323 BC), popularly known as Alexander the Great (Greek: ÎœÎ­Î³Î±Ï‚ á¼ˆÎ»Î­Î¾Î±Î½Î´ÏÎ¿Ï‚, MÃ©gas AlÃ©xandros), was a king (basileus) of Macedon. The most celebrated member of Greek Argead Dynasty, he created one of the largest empires in ancient history. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander received a classical Greek education under the tutorship of famed philosopher Aristotle, succeeded his father Philip II of Macedon to the throne in 336 BC after the King was assassinated, and died thirteen years later at the age of 32. Although both Alexander's reign and empire were short-lived, the cultural impact of his conquests lasted for centuries. Alexander is one of the most famous figures of antiquity, and is remembered for his tactical ability, his conquests, and for spreading Greek civilization into the East.
