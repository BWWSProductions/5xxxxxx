,TaiTheGuy,2010-03-30T22:27Z,"24 minutes is a long time. usually, for TV purposes, episodes that fill 30 minute slots contain 22 minutes not counting commercials. 1 hour shows are 44 minutes give or take 30- 40 seconds"

I am a 6th grade social studies teacher and although I couldn't use either of these for class, I still would watch the other documentary over this one."
