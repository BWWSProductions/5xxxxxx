She is a lively and sociable child, but she spends a lot of time alone at home. Too much. Estrella enjoys fantasy and horror stories and, in order to exorcise the fear that the 'big monsters' cause her, she makes friends with them: she gives them a body, talks to them, they go to school with her, they protect her.... One day, Estrella makes friends with a new companion, a vampire. But could it be that this 'friend' is not merely a product of the girl's imagination?" .
