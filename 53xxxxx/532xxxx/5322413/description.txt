World Crisis Radio with Webster Tarpley
Saturday, 30 January 2010

[sebaygo1]





Tarpley analyzes the State of the Union Address [including the pre-speech ostentacious display of affection between Obama and Geithner].

Phil Berg [ObamaCrimes.com] makes his usual weekly visit and there is the now regular update on the Icelandic debt situation.




NOTE :: This torrent uses audio sourced from Tarpley.net this time [on a trial basis].  It is commercial-free.  Most of the editing I did was to shorten the classical music interludes.  Downside: this is 32K bitrate rather than the 64K I have been uploading.  Upside, there's none of the content chopping that occurs sometimes on the GCN 64K podcasts.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
