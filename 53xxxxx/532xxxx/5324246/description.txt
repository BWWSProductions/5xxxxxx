The world's FIRST 7cm/pixel airport! Prepare to be stunned at the detail of the airport aprons, taxiways and surrounds with the first ever FSX airport to be released using incredible 7cm/pixel digitally sourced aerial imagery, taken using the very latest direct to disk mounted cameras on aircraft. 

Tamworth airport is a busy regional hub and also the home of the Basic Flight Training Skills (BFTS) school, which is the first stop for any "top gun" candidate wanting to fly with the Australian Defence Forces. 

As well as BFTS and the airport, this scenery features over 150km of pristine 60cm/pixel photoreal imagery of the Tamworth township, farms, hills and surrounds and uses a custom 5 metre resolution terrain mesh. You'll be impressed by the tour-de-force which is YSTW!
