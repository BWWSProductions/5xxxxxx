Carmen is a French opÃ©ra comique by Georges Bizet. The libretto is by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic HalÃ©vy, based on the novella of the same title by Prosper MÃ©rimÃ©e, first published in 1845,[1] itself influenced by the narrative poem The Gypsies (1824) by Alexander Pushkin.[2] MÃ©rimÃ©e had read the poem in Russian by 1840 and translated it into French in 1852.[3]

The opera premiered at the OpÃ©ra-Comique of Paris on 3 March 1875, but its opening run was denounced by the majority of critics.[4] It was almost withdrawn after its fourth or fifth performance, and although this was avoided, ultimately having 48 performances in its first run,[5] it did little to bolster sagging receipts at the OpÃ©ra-Comique. Near the end of this run, the theatre was giving tickets away in order to stimulate attendance. Bizet died of a heart attack, aged 36, on 3 June 1875, never knowing how popular Carmen would become. In October 1875 it was produced in Vienna, to critical and popular success, which began its path to worldwide popularity.[6] It was not staged again at the OpÃ©ra Comique until 1883.

Since the 1880s it has been one of the world's most performed operas[7] and a staple of the operatic repertoire. Carmen appears as number four on Opera America's list of the 20 most-performed operas in North America.
