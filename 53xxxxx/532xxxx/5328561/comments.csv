,ralphvin,2010-02-02T12:11Z,"thx....20-40. 

can u up 'Warriors of Heaven on Earth' if possible!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-02T12:58Z,"@ralphvin: I found one, but on slowest server in universe. I can get one till tomorrow - max. speed on server-side is 34 kB/s BUT:
- it is Chinese, older movie (2005) with subs, 4.43 GB
- it is fairly LONG one, almost two hours
- two hours translated in H264 means a file-size of 400-500 MB (depends on complexity)

You must find some friends, you should have wing-men/helpers/interested-in, there is no point in going through so much trouble for maybe half-dozen people."

[T],Robin86,2010-02-05T03:15Z,"Huge thanks for these! I'm on a very limited DL cap for the time being ($10 per 1GB..) so downloading the 350 MB caps is out of the question. Please keep these great rips coming!

I'd like to see Lost too though, anyone know if there are any small caps like this of the premiere?"
[T],Robin86,2010-02-05T03:17Z,Never mind! It was right there in your torrent page all along. Thanks!
