"Can't Leave 'em Alone" is a pop song recorded by American singer Ciara and rapper 50 Cent for Ciara's second album, Ciara: The Evolution (2006). Written by Ciara, LaShawn Daniels, Rodney Jerkins, and 50 Cent, it is the fourth release and official third single from the album. It was solicited to Mainstream Urban radio stations on June 12, 2007 and Rhythmic stations on July 10, 2007.

The song is a 1980s-inspired mid-tempo ballad, featuring the 808 drums. Ciara described it as a "big record", and said that she invited 50 Cent for "some kind of flavor". It was originally titled "Dope Boys".

The Fat Cats directed video was shot on June 9, 2007 and June 10, 2007 in Atlanta. The video was scheduled to premiere on Yahoo! Music on June 25, but it was changed to July 2, 2007.

The video reached #2 on 106 & Park.

The video begins with Ciara walking down the street, sporting a purple bikini top, as well as a yellow jacket and yellow booty shorts. 50 Cent appears in front of a convertible Pontiac G6 and a large building with styled graffiti on when he recites his beginning verse. During Ciara's first verse and chorus, she interacts with the neighborhood's residence and meets up with close friend, and MTV VJ La La Vasquez. As the video progresses, we view somewhat of a semi-nude scene, which features footage of Ciara and 50 Cent holding each other closely, while a black backdrop circulates around them. Afterwards, Ciara and 50 Cent head up to the roof of a building, each seat themselves in two separate chairs situated across a black table, and Ciara smiles at 50 Cent with compassion as he recites his last verse of the song. During the end, there's a collage of clips of Ciara up against a wall, the semi-nude scene, and the earlier shots of Ciara in the yellow attire.

The MTV version of the video edits the part of the song when she says, "I tried that good boy game but the *dope* boy's turning me on".

Ciara: The Evolution is the second studio album by American singer Ciara, released on December 5, 2006 (see 2006 in music) in North America on LaFace and the Zomba Label Group. It was released in the United Kingdom on April 9, 2007.

The album received generally favorable reviews from critics, scoring a 65 on Metracritic. It was able to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 338,000 copies in its first week. Overall the album has been just moderately successful in comparison to her debut album as it was only certified platinum by the RIAA after five weeks of its release. The album is composed of Miami bass, Atlanta crunk, ballads, dance tracks, and old school songs with "big fat pop hooks".

The album produced the U.S. top ten single "Get Up", which features rapper Chamillionaire and also appears on the Step Up soundtrack, the top twenty singles "Promise" (which is Ciaraâ€™s first single to enter the top twenty without a featured act) and "Like a Boy". "Can't Leave 'Em Alone" which features rapper 50 Cent, was the fourth and last single from the album.
