,MrMustachio,2011-03-01T10:13Z,I had absolutely no idea that Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was in this movie!
,tfrank2000,2011-04-20T08:46Z,"First off, this is the directors cut, with the alternate (shit) ending.
Second, its split into three files, skimping on the Eng track (dolby only, not DTS).
What fucking moron splits these up into 3x files to fit on DVDs? If it is indeed an HD rip, then size it for bluray. This torrent deserves to die. Waste of bandwidth."

Google MKVToolNix."
