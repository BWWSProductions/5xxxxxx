Midnight Sun, known in Japan as Song of the Sun (ã‚¿ã‚¤ãƒ¨ã‚¦ã®ã†ãŸ TaiyÅ no Uta?), is a movie directed by Norihiro Koizumi starring the Japanese artist and singer Yui. In the movie, she plays the role of Kaoru Amane (é›¨éŸ³ è–« Amane Kaoru), a 16 year old girl who has the rare skin condition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a disease that makes the ultraviolet radiation of sunlight potentially lethal to her. Yui's character is partly based on herself, as she is an amateur singer and guitarist, and she performs three of Yui's songs in the movie; It's Happy Line, Good-bye Days and Skyline.
