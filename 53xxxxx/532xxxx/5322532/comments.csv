I have had NO sync issues and Im at about the 20 minute mark, also skimmed through parts and there voices match there mouths throughout the movie all the way towards the end without ruining it, so take it or leave it, my copy is great and IN SYNC!"

,piratepobe,2010-01-31T20:06Z,"v:6 a:4. watchable, but video not crisp and audio has sync issues. not too bad though"
,bigghands,2010-01-31T20:31Z,"easy way to explain a/v quality:  the movie looks and sounds bad on a tv or large computer monitor, but when I moved it and watched it on my  laptop it sounds and looks fine.  Hope that helps.

Also, quality of movie and story is awesome the first half.....second half turns into just violence and the storyline suffers because of it."

,Goblin77,2010-01-31T22:12Z,"I think it's an R5 and not a DVDSCR.
Thanks for the movie."
,libzz,2010-02-01T03:36Z,"This is watchable by far. Audio's decent. Video is good.

,bigough,2010-02-01T14:43Z,"It definitely isn't a dvdscr, it is a cam, but a very good cam.  a/10 v/10 for a cam, a/6 v/8 for a dvdscr. "
,parasites,2010-02-01T19:58Z,"Looked through this' Its a cam.
V 5. A5. Will wait for a better copy before I watch it.
Thanks up loader."
,tinuviel949,2010-02-01T21:56Z,"clearly there are too many idiots in the world who cant figure out a rar to save their miserable existence of a life:

a/v 8/8 the audio is quite good and is MOST DEFINITELY IN SYNC, it is a dark movie-we're talking about VAMPIRES here so what did u expect.

NOT a scr however it IS a R5-hence the Russian giving moronic fucktards instructions on how to kill all Texans

not a bad movie overall & many thanks for the up"
