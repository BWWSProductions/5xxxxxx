,crossfire6,2010-01-31T02:35Z,"'Superstition', sistromo?
Same as Christianity, I guess.  These beliefs are instrumental in guiding the thoughts and actions of, shall we say, about a couple billion people.  That alone is worth discovering something about why people think the way that they do.  Don't worry, you're safe.  Just reading and learning about something doesn't mean you have to kneel on the mat."
