Thank you seeders! All 240 of you and counting!

[T],Vitamin_X,2012-07-13T13:12Z,"Thank you! to the uploader and whoever who visited here and is reading this comment right now.

I wish more and more people came by this and spent their time listening to this spending their time positively and giving themselves a good feeling rather than wasting their time playing games and browsing websites which feeds ego in them and thus hampering their overall well being."
