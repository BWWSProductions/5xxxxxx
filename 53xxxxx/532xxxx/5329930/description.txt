The album kicks off on such a fast pace and pulls the listener in right away. â€œHow Joey Got His Groove Backâ€ is probably one of there more renowned songs if anyoneâ€™s ever heard of this band. The contrast to melodic and screaming vocals present equilibrium to the listener and blend in nicely. The screams are powerful and horse and shows a good introduction to the band. The hardcore styled drumming at around the 2 minute mark will make you circle around and get you off your ***. This band is no stranger to breakdown and the palm muted heaviness of the guitars will put you through the walls. â€œDressed to thrillâ€ continues the rampage at a high octane pace. By this now you should be able to see the resemblance of Neal Carters murderous voice to Keith Buckleyâ€™s from the Last Night in Town era. The song seems to be split into two with a short pause in between that sometimes even confuses me.
