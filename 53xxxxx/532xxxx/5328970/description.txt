Die Hard: Nakatomi Plaza is a first-person shooter for PC made by Piranha Games. The game originally used a modified Build engine, later the GoldSrc engine, before it was finally moved to the Lithtech engine. The game features the voice of Reginald VelJohnson, reprising his role as Al Powell.

The game is a first-person shooter that follows the plot of the first Die Hard film. Players take the role of John McClane, and try to stop the terrorist attack on the Nakatomi Plaza. The game's levels are based on the sets from the film. The various action scenes from the film have also been recreated.

The game expands on the film's plot, and adds a few missions not found in the film, such as escorting a SWAT team around the building or saving various hostages stranded on various floors of the building.

The game features standard first-person shooter gameplay. There are five different types of firearms, as well as items such as a zippo lighter and a radio that can be used to accomplish various tasks.
