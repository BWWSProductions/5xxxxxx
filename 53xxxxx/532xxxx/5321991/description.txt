The First World War (1914 -1918) was supposed to be the war to end all wars. For the young eager and patriotic men who enlisted in their thousands to fight for King and Country it was to be a marvellous adventure - an opportunity to march to Glory with the battalions of pals and chums. Nothing could have prepared them for the nightmare that beckoned. 

This video explains what it meant to live and fight on the Western front from the innocent patriotism of Kitcheners Army to the war-weary anger of the war poets. This is the story of the horror of life in the trenches. 

Powerful contemporary film footage and photographic images are revealed in this DVD featuring the latest computer graphics and dramatised accounts of those who were there with comment and analysis by Dr. David Chandler and a special appearance by Brian Blessed.
