Here comes trouble! The adventure never stops as Lilo and Stitch face the challenge of their lives in Disney's hilarious, all-new movie Leroy & Stitch.

As a reward for rounding up all 625 experiments, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley have been placed around the galaxy in a spot where each of them thinks they truly belong. Their lives are all shook up when the dastardly Dr. Hamsterviel breaks out of prison and forces Jumba to create a new experiment - Leroy, the evil twin of Stitch. To make matters worse, Hamsterviel soon clones the nasty little creature to form his own mischievous army. Now it's up to Lilo to gather Stitch and the rest of the gang from the far corners of outer space to battle the legion of Leroys. When the going gets rough, our friends discover that one place they all truly belong is together.
