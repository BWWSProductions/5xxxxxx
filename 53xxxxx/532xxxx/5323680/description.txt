    In the third programme in this epic four-part series on    
    how the Navy has shaped modern Britain, Dan Snow sheds    
    light on the evolution of Nelson's Navy in the late      
    18th century. It was the most powerful maritime           
    fighting force in the world, with highly trained crews     
    and ambitious officers. He explores the national          
    enterprise which supported it, and explains how the      
    empire it helped create put Britain on the path to war    
    with France.                                               
                                                              
    Through the stories of naval heroes like Captain Cook,   
    naval administrators like Charles Middleton and of        
    course Admiral Nelson, Snow explores the elite training    
    the growing naval meritocracy and the years of tough      
    experience which created a ruthless and professional     
    'Band of Brothers'. He looks at the impact of             
    innovations such as the copper bottoming of the navy's     
    ships and the introduction of a new tax - income tax -    
    to pay for the fleet.                                    
                                                              
    Pushing back the boundaries of the known world, the        
    navy's highly trained crews and ambitious officers laid   
    claim to a burgeoning empire, but at a huge price. By    
    1800, Britain had been dragged into the greatest          
    sequence of wars the nation had ever seen.
