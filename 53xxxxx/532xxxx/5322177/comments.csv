If you like to see people die in different illogical ways- and see some bad actors act really bad about seeing people die in different illogical ways .. you've already got the entire story -and if you like such stuff, it's probably nice to see someones head getting smashed up close in 3D. If not, I'd recommend watching the 12min. Shrek 3D-movie, it has a longer storyline."
