A documentary on Michael Ruppert, a police officer turned independent reporter who predicted the current financial crisis in his self-published newsletter, From the Wilderness.

In this documentary, he explores his apocalyptic vision of the future, spanning the crises in economics, energy, environment and more.

Whether Michael Ruppert is a madman or a prophet, you must decide for yourself. What I do know is that all of his suppositions are based on the hardest and most chilling of facts. You will recall your teachings on Cassandra and the famous Cassandra Complex, whereby a person who bears valid warnings and terrible foresight is doomed to watch it happen. They are helpless to stop it because no one will listen to them.
Meet Cassandra.
