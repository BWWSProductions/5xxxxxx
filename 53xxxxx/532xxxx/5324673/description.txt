The first torrent of Eng subs had a problem with the second half. The link to allsubs.org were semi fixed on the second CD but on my player it wouldn't play until I fixed the srt formatting. Dunno if that's just mine but here's the fixed file (and the first half) for the second half of the movie. Anyone have translations for the on-screen text?
