,whats_his_nuts,2010-03-08T08:04Z,"Crackly and poppy. Completely pointless use of FLAC. sounds like they recorded the album with a rusty patch-cord from a discman

,eGaTS,2010-03-29T05:40Z,i can confirm. horrible quality
,hyeguy123,2010-04-22T04:07Z,This has the best FLAC quality on tpb for Only By The Night. But that's not saying alot considering that these FLAC files aren't entirely impressive.
