but if you want to reencode to xvid/ac3 in an avi-container:
this file has AC3 Audio with a variable bitrate! (although it says CBR in for example mediainfo) means if want to mux audio/video later on into a avi-file, you'll get playback problems because of the VBR - convert to CBR with besweet to fix 

thx for sharing!"
