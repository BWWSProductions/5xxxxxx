Poser 8

Poser 8 is the world's most complete solution for creating art and animation using 3D characters. With Poser, it's easy to make 3D art, whether you're an experienced artist or you're dabbling in graphics for the very first time. Poser includes over 2.5 gigabyte of ready-to-pose, fully textured, human and animal figures, basic accessories such as hair, clothing, pose sets, real world props and 3D scene elements so you can start creating 3D character art and animation in minutes.
â€¢	Generate new characters from your facial photographs.
â€¢	Add hair and clothing.
â€¢	Dress Poser's virtual stage with props, lights and cameras to construct 3D scenes.
â€¢	Automatically generate walking or running animations and talking characters.
â€¢	Import motion capture files for even more animated realism.
â€¢	Animate lights and cameras, and then render your scene into photorealistic images and video for web, print, and film projects.
â€¢	Export 3D figures to add characters to other 3D applications.
Along with 8 brand new 3D humans, Poser 8 includes an improved user interface to maximize your workspace while providing better workflow, a new search-enabled library so you can find, organize and use your content easier, a dependant parameter tool that lets you teach objects in the scene to interact with each other, cross body morph brushes to smoothly sculpt a figure across every body part, new photorealistic rendering features that more accurately reproduce light and shadows, and improved character rigging for even better character bending. To save time, Poser 8 has been performance optimized so you can pose your characters and render them faster on today's multiple processor systems.
