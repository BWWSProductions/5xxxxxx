,juanLsanchez,2010-02-02T03:34Z,"i was wondering when you would upload New Moon, since it can be pre-ordered on itunes already?

thanks HR."
,MetallicDivision,2010-02-02T04:22Z,"HR, absolutely love your work. You are the best handheld video uploader bar none but whats up with all the chick flicks? 

While this is a good movie its unbelievable how many of your recent uploads are chick flicks: the notebook, love actually, twilight, paper heart, fame, time travelers wife, the list goes on and on and on....

how bout NOT leaving us guys out to dry and up some ""guy flicks"" such as the godfather 1 and 2, scarface, the bourne trilogy, goodfellas, casino, snatch, lock stock and 2 smoking barrels, heat, etc...

anyway, thanks for all your hard work, keep it up but give us guys a little taste too!"
,elvivenmi,2010-02-02T08:23Z,"Hey Holy, thanks for getting me Trading Places last time. I have a couple of new suggestions:

The Count of Monte Cristo- Jim Caviziel?
Roadtrip- w/ Tom Green
The Man in the Iron Mask- w/ Leonardo DiCaprio
the Friday trilogy- Ice Cube (especially part 3)
Apollo 13- w/ Tom Hanks
Orange County- w/ Jack Black
The Time Machine- w/ Guy Pierce

Whatever you can at your discretion. Thanks buddy. All the best... :)"
