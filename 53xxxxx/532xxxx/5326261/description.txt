CHEW #8
By: John Layman, Rob Guillory

Introducing Poyo! In the cockfighting ring, Poyo is almost impossible to defeat. This makes Poyo's owners very, very rich. It also has a habit of making Poyo's owners very, very dead. Guess who gets assigned to track down Poyo, and the murderers who have stolen him?

Thanks to CPS for the excellent scan.
