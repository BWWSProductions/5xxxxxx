damn you man! your audio tweaking;

you need to change your audio quality
go to:

Playback Devices > Speakers > Properties > Advanced
Then change your Default Format to: 24 bit, 48000 Hz (Studio Quality).  
fixed the  ""unhandled exception caught!"" works!

1. Unrar
2. Run setup
3. Play

It seriously is that simple. Don't even bother about multiplayer, it says so right in the instructions. It's a cracked copy, ain't gonna work. LAN on the other hand, I dunno. Haven't tried; I'm in these games for the campaigns anyway, and in that area this torrent gets top marks."
