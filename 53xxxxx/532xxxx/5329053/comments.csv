You must be...gettin' those episodes uploaded so fast.  Hey, I really appreciate it guy.  *throws you a big worm*  If this isn't the original Bigfish, thanks for sharing these!"
,abbiasha,2010-02-02T23:35Z,"Message for bigfish5.....

Is it me or have some of these episodes been heavily edited?  There was no proper lead-in for Episode 1. 
No introduction of either of the trainers...
And a whole heap of training that seems wasn't shown.

Take today's for instance.... length 23:41?  WTF?
Don't get me wrong - these uploads are highly appreciated but there seems a lot of cropping!"
,pruer,2010-02-03T02:05Z,"I watched E1 .. that is what it looked like on tv .. there was NO training etc .. went from introduction of the contestants to an elimination !   23.41 would be about right without ads !    they are not all 1 hr episodes on weeknights.  
So thanks for the upload :-)  much appreciated."
,ghoull,2010-02-03T03:53Z,The reason for the heavy edits is because one of the contestants is up on charges so they had to edit all the segments out. Usually the first training session with the trainers is the best part yet they didn't show a bit of it. 
,abbiasha,2010-02-03T16:10Z,"WOW!  Thanks for that info people! Now it all makes sense.  It must bite Bob, Jillian and the producers that they had to hack a bunch of airtime off - not to mention losing ad. revenues....:P
I'll have to go back over the couples on the Loser web page to figure out who the naughty person is!  LOL"
