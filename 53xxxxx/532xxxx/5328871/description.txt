Alecia Beth Moore (born September 8, 1979), better known by her stage name Pink (often stylized as P!nk), is an American singer, songwriter and occasional actress who rose to fame in early 2000 as an R&B singer, but then switched to a more rock and pop rock sound after her sophomore record.

She released her first single "There You Go" and first album, the R&B-oriented Can't Take Me Home, in 2000 via LaFace Records, which garnered commercial success. Her more pop rock-oriented second studio album, Missundaztood, which began a marked shift in the sound of her music, was released in 2001, and was very successful worldwide, and is currently her best seller.

Pink released her third album, Try This, in November 2003, and her fourth in April 2006, I'm Not Dead. The latter generated seven hit singles, including "Stupid Girls", "U + Ur Hand" and "Who Knew". Her fifth album, Funhouse, was released in late October 2008 and was preceded by her first solo number one on the Hot 100, "So What". The album hosts Top 20 hits "Sober" and "Please Don't Leave Me", and is Pink's first album to spawn five worldwide singles. Pink revealed that she is in no hurry to record a sixth album because she "has nothing to say." 

She has sold more than 10 million albums in the US and over 30 million records worldwide, and scored eight Top 10 US hits, won two Grammy Awards and became one of the best known female pop rock acts of the decade.

On November 23, 2008, Pink performed her second single from Funhouse, "Sober" at the American Music Awards. The third single was "Please Don't Leave Me", with a video directed by Dave Meyers. The fourth single was "Funhouse", although "Bad Influence" was released in Australia prior to "Funhouse"'s release as a promotional single for the tour.

In May 2009, Pink released a four-CD set of her albums Can't Take Me Home / Missundaztood / Try This / I'm Not Dead, excluding her current album Funhouse. The album peaked at number 1 in the UK Album Chart.

On September 13, 2009, Pink performed "Sober" while doing a trapeze act at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, where she was nominated for Best Female Video.

The music of Pink was the theme of the October 4, 2009 episode of Australian Idol.

On January 31, 2010, Pink did another trapeze act at the 2010 Grammy Awards, this time performing the song "Glitter in the Air". She received a standing ovation from the present guests.
