NOTES:
22 Funky Soul Grooves from New Orleans and the Deep South

Soul Music from America's deep south is typically distinguished by its raw human spirit and its earthy down-home feel which so often mirrors the people who made it and the places where it was made.
But, despite its apparent simplicity, the music is not very easily defined - and it even more difficult to emulate.
The essence and atmosphere of the music ws fiercely retained by many southern soul artists and producers - particularly the independent operators - at a time when music from other parts of the USA became more sophisticated and began to lose regional idenitity. The flavour is everything
Here we present a selection of funky tracks from a rich period in the history of southern soul.
