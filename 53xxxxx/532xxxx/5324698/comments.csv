Thanks, flu dude."

Dude, how in the hell do I get this to burn on a regular DVD??????? "
,kimiani,2010-02-06T18:30Z,Thanks man......I had been requesting this movie for a while....Thank U Very Much.....Its my Favourite Movie.....and thanks for a Full DVD.
,fredfan,2010-02-08T15:57Z,"hjsn1:  I looked a bit and can't find the comment, but it looks like something I asked at one point.  Aside from a couple mystery downloads, I think most of the burning issues I've had from here in the past were either a failing burner or something on my secondary computer, or the days when I learned that DVD+R held slightly less than a DVD-R.

Otherwise it was data corruption in the DL process (rare) or a bad upload on the Fred team's side (EVEN RARER).  Thanks for asking."
