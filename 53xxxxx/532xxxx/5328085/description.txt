The room is painted a plain white, a table with food and drink set up in the corner. There are no visible doors and no windows. There is a vent near the ceiling, and a surveillance camera on one wall. A TV is also attached to one corner. When Vincent wakes up and sees his predicament, he panics. Along with five complete strangers, he's locked in this location with no explanation as to why. As everyone else wakes up - lawyer Georges, TV personality Alex, and corporate career gals Alice, Elise, and Marie - no connection can be made. And then, a disembodied voice announces the project's intentions. The six captives will compete in a series of "tests". Whoever fails or interferes with their completion will be removed...and executed. Between the panic and paranoia, the sextet must learn to listen, and work together. If they don't, this stay inside a social experiment Aquarium will be fatal for all involved.
