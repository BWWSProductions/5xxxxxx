If nobody wants to seed this torrent after downloading, then I won't start with season 2."
,biertjeu,2010-04-19T20:17Z,"Thank you very much for this season.
Hope you are going to upload more.
Can I also choose Dutch subs with this one.

Greetings BierTjeu"
,biertjeu,2010-04-20T20:50Z,"Hey Dionysos69,

would you like to upload more Boston Legal for me?
I'm begging you please...

Greetings BierTjeu"
,wokke,2010-11-10T20:24Z,"Friends, PLEASE SEED!"
,johncroc,2011-09-28T02:34Z,"Please, please, please seed this.  There are 2 of us who would like to get it, and 0 seeds.  I will be happy to seed once I have it.  In general, I seed anything I can that has fewer than 5 seeds (hint, hint).  Thank you Dionysos69 for making the tor available!"
,johncroc,2011-09-28T02:50Z,"Nevermind...didn't realize this was VOBs.  Was hoping for 720p so thought this might be it, but would rather have avi, wmv, etc.  Thanks."
