Aside from the fact that the existance of Black Holes has been predicted since Einsteins work on relativity (though he felt it was probably a fluke, just like he failed to notice that his theory predicted the expansion of spacetime), check out Dr Andrea Gez et al. and their work on the central hole in the Milky way. Explain 4 million solar masses of gravity in an area less than a light week without ending up with the math giving you a... black hole. :)

But my bet, like the previous speaker, is on creationism. The denial is just as strong as theirs. :)"

Empirical thought and rationalism are ""a candle in the dark"" ie:the best tools we've got to figure out what's out there, deducing from experimentation rather than having a preformed answer which one tries to fit ""evidence"" into, and disregard anything incongruous.

So, I'd say you're all wrong.

But TroxDrippen gets a consolation prize of four internets for being the closest to the truth, even though there's a black hole at the middle of the truth.  Oh no, the internets are not in the black hole.  Good thing I bought an extra internet on ebay."
