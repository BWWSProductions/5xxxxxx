       Black holes are one of the most destructive forces in the universe, 
       capable of tearing a planet apart and swallowing an entire star. 
       Yet scientists now believe they could hold the key to answering the 
       ultimate question - what was there before the Big Bang?
       
       The trouble is that researching them is next to impossible. Black 
       holes are by definition invisible and there's no scientific theory 
       able to explain them. Despite these obvious obstacles, Horizon meets 
       the astronomers attempting to image a black hole for the very first 
       time and the theoretical physicists getting ever closer to unlocking 
       their mysteries. It's a story that takes us into the heart of a black 
       hole and to the very edge of what we think we know about the universe.
