,kdavies9688,2010-02-13T03:19Z,your awesome soagg keep up the good work i know iv already requested Gantz but another amazing series that would be awesome if u could get is Neon Genesis Evangelion
,Z.Z.,2010-02-13T05:27Z,Thanks for this. Your torrents are awesome. I've gotten Code Geass and Death Note from you which are now my favorite anime. I've been looking for this for a while as well. I was only able to find a dual audio set. I really despise dual audio as I never end up listening to the Japanese w/ subs. It just takes up space. So thanks for this. I now have 3 Gigs free from this. :D
,saiyonmonkey,2010-02-15T17:46Z,"this is an awesome anime, definitely worth downloading!!! good stuff soagg :)"
,soagg1,2010-02-15T18:57Z,Thanks saiyon and being such a small series as well it made quite an impact. I hate when they unnecessarily drag things to elongate seasons. Just takes more effort from me to upload them :D

,Mercer-6,2011-07-29T03:54Z,This is a short series? I've watched a lot of anime and this is pretty standard length. People watch too much damn Naruto...
,Yenrock7,2011-08-16T10:53Z,This is the only Anime that made me cry. It's a very touching story. Specially the episode where a robot girl fell in-love with a human but she got hit by a truck. I forgot which episode it was. Is this English Dubbed from Animax? thanks.
