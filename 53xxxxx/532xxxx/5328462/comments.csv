:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-02T09:07Z,"@zmacdaddy8: Regarding my yesterday's no-go for your request - absolutely. As side note - I did first ep. of MoA but it was disaster.

@harouha: Thank you. Your recent number of Thanks qualifies you for my question:
Do you have a wish? It wont be treated as request - no-strings-attached."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-02T09:49Z,"@zmacdaddy8: I asking myself same question last three years, after the ""explosion"" of Matroskas of several Gigabytes. People, for reason buried down there, burn their money away. I guess, hell no, I am sure that this money isn't theirs or haven't earned hard enough.

Long ago, I've done a pool, and know what: shelf-life of TV episode is about - 4 hours...
That's how ""investment"" in best quality is ""appreciated"". Of course, it is directed to people who download ""720p exclusively"" for ""perfect pleasure"" and came here to bitch about my work when Scene misses something they watch.

In whole history of ""our"" work only 38 TV shows are so called keepers, movies aside."

hey would you be able to upload the new House episodes? 
would be much appreciated :D "
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-02T10:11Z,"@azzarough: House was one of the shows which were kicked-out for my schedule last year... to never come back. Ugly Betty and House are mega-popular shows, and eztv guys are more than happy with quality of such huge fan-base. I am not happy, but sad. It's about people, not shows, I enjoyed first two seasons of House very much. It is good show, but IMHO, should ended back then or maybe season after. Ugly Betty ... was and is out of my picture.
Sorry."
