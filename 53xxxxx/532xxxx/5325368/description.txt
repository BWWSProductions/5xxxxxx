''A fixed-gear bike is a thoroughbred racing machine, the cycle messengerÂ´s workshorse and,for many street riders, an aesthetic choice. Each bike is a statement of individuality that stands out from the hundreds of grey hybrids lined up at the traffic lights. A global fixed-gear culture has come into being.

FIXED is the first book to document global fixed-gear culture. It joins thebetween the bikeÂ´s design, its racing heritage and the customization that marks its appearance on our city streets. It meets the track stars, tricksters, messengers, hill bombers and polo players the world over, linking them to the artists, designers and framebuilders whom the bike has inspired.

It tells the story of why these bikes are special through interview, image and archive exploring the form, function, style and culture at the heart of the obsession.''
