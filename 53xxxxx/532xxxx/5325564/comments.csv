,danconia3873,2010-09-19T04:58Z,"It works on Win 7 64-bit so far.  One problem I am having though is that I apparently can't set up a localhost or testing server, and it won't let me work on projects without that.

Anyone know how to use Primavera P6 without an actual server?  Any help would be appreciated!"
