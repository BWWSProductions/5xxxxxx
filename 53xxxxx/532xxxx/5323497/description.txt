John Coffey - Vanity (2009)

Have you ever created something beautiful? â€¨And then shot it to pieces?

JOHN COFFEY have worked on their debut album in an abandoned factory in Utrecht, The Netherlands and in tourbusses throughout Europe. The result is a record that will hit listeners like a speeding bullet. Catchy melodies are ruthlessly shot by loud guitar riffs. An unheard form of rock 'n roll in which the band leaves listeners in the dark, not suspecting anything, and pulls the trigger at some point in their songs. A record with a bullet hole straight through it. Vanity just got shot.
