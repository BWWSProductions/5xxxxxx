They may seem like regular people with everyday jobs but they're actually real life heroâ€™s firemen, police, military, medics and even teachers. We count on them to keep us safe, teach us about the world, and sometimes even rescue us from danger. It's easy to see why we're so attracted to them. And if you're lucky, sometimes you'll get a little extra care from these professional heroes. Saving your ass is only part of the job!
