The funk soul brothers return for the first time in five years, with the first classic, fantastic party album of the decade, featuring collaborations with Roots Manuva and Paul Kaye.
A party album built in a psychological bunker; itâ€™s a phenomenal testament to the power of unbound optimism. â€œThereâ€™s this thing called Noetics,â€ announces Huey.  â€œWhich says if everybody thinks the same good thoughts, good things will happen.  Likewise, negative thoughts - itâ€™s not rocket science.  And we all want the same thing, to be a Fun Lovinâ€™ Criminal.  You have to go through hell to get to heaven and now weâ€™re finally out from under a lot of our problems, itâ€™s a brand new day.  So letâ€™s go out and do what we love to do.â€
