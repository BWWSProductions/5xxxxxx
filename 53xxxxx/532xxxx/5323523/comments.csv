But, I will warn people, this game blows! Even for a diehard fan like myself I had a hard time playing it for more than 30 minutes. For 1 the controls are screwy and I couldnt find a way to change them. Arrows for ""rotate left/right"", pageup pagedown to look up and down, ctrl+arrows to strafe... yick.

Then the graphics are lame, and the story... well you dont even play a doctor, or a companion. You are a swirl of mental energy created by the doctors to save the doctors. You just float around.

But seriously, if I could setup the controls better i might have played it more."
