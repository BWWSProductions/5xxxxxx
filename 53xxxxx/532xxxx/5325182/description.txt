Panorama - A Walk in the Park
The fight is on for the holiest city in the holy land. The Israelis say Jerusalem must never be divided; the Palestinians say the east of the city is theirs and must become the capital of a new state.

Jane Corbin walks through the disputed streets and parks, meeting families thrown out of their homes, witnessing bulldozers demolishing houses and goes underground to explore tunnels excavated deep below the biblical sites.
