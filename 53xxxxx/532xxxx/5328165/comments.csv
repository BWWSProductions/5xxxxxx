,Vossiej,2010-02-03T14:05Z,When will Sherlock Holmes be released? I'm really looking forward to this movie!
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-02-05T21:13Z,Fuggers are you sayin' for us 3 to form a group to rival the Secretmyth group? :))
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-02-06T17:37Z,"I encode for PC and other platforms come in second but I am trying to make the movies more versatile.It would be nice to make a group but I like to rip certain movies ,you like to rip certain movies and so does 3li so there would be differences.Unless we have the same goal it doesn't look like it's gonna happen."
,Cespur,2010-02-06T18:57Z,The fact that you all like different movies is a good thing: That way you get a lot of different movies.
,Cespur,2010-02-06T21:43Z,"How do you put the HD tag on your videos btw, HR?"
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-02-07T02:20Z,Well here's the thing.I care about the content.I'm selective when it comes to what I rip.I'm not picking every straight to dvd movie I can get my hands on and start ripping it.No pun intended just my 2 cents on the matter.
,amitarora78,2010-02-09T14:48Z,"Is yours rip better or sinners one that can be downloaded from here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4643872/The.Notebook.2004.720p.BluRay.x264-SiNNERS

i am kind of pissed off with sinners releases since they are not crisp as those of secretmyth's

Please reply and tell me which one is better don't worry about the size."

Thanks"
,analingus12345,2011-02-13T09:13Z,love dis movie alot but hate dis torrent!!
,Mathlol,2011-03-05T20:51Z,"The rip is good.  And why the hell would you compare one group to any other?  For those who know no better, they stick with certain names b.c they haven't realized a better qual.  Secret Myth is fine like noir or fxg but don't upscale their level of rip to that of a higher quality rip.  The road does NOT work both ways."
,x_PseudoAnonymous,2011-04-12T23:44Z,"how about english subtitles? i don't mean to be a nuisance, but it'd be great if all brrips came with subtitles. :] nevertheless, thanks for the upload!"
