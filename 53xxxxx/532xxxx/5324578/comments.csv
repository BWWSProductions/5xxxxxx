,Sanctun,2010-07-30T18:11Z,what sort of problem it may cause?
[T],nystrand,2011-04-13T08:02Z,please seed stuck at 99.99%
,demirvader,2011-07-20T16:08Z,DON'T download.FULL OF VIRUS!!!!!!!!!!
,jack_mustang,2011-07-21T01:53Z,"There are no virus. And the .nrg file included is useless, it just download untill 99.9%, but it installs anyway. The files that don't download are jpg's and this NRG file that is simply Erotic Dreams without translations.

But this is useless, there's nothing cool. Only some sexy clothes, not so cool naked skins, lot of makeups, eye colors, some mods that let your sims stay naked in front of other and have sex with anyone, and no custom objects.

If you want something really erotic, go on http://sexysims2.com/ and download some skins and custom objects.
And go to http://paysites.mustbedestroyed.org/ and download ""xxxsims2_woohoo_everywhere.rar"" under 'TS2/xxxsims', it gives you the ability to have lots of sex positions.
And download ""teen_woohoo_apartmentlife.zip"" under 'TS2/sims2living', this make teens have sex and also have ability to remove shooing or/and jealousy and also love required to have sex.

Hope I helped you how to make your sims hotter!"
