Plot Outline
In the year 2019, a plague has transformed most every human
into vampires. Faced with a dwindling blood supply, the
fractured dominant race plots their survival; meanwhile, a
researcher works with a covert band of vamps on a way to
save humankind.

Plot
In a world 10 years into the future, vampires make up the
vast majority of the population with only 5% of the human
race remaining. This presents particular challenges as the
vampires' food supply - human blood - is dwindling and
rationing is now the norm. There is growing evidence that
vampires deprived of an adequate blood supply are themselves
evolving into wild, vile creatures that attack anyone and
anything in order to survive. Dr. Edward Dalton, a vampire
and hematologist who works for a pharmaceutical firm, has
been working on finding an artificial blood supply that will
meet the vampire society's needs. He is sympathetic to
humans and sees his work as a way of alleviating their
suffering but his views on finding a solution change
considerably when he meets someone who found a way to
transform himself from being a vampire to again take human
form.
