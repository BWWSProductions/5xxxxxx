Thank You Guys For Commenting About Quality.


All My Rips Have Proper Descriptions And Screenshots.

So Just Use A Little Brain. This Is Not HD. 

Here 'HQ' Stands For Superior Quality Than Other Larger Torrents Using Older XviD Or Such Codecs In Reasonable Size.


Compare With Something That Have At Least Nearly Same File Size.

You Are Compairing 282MB With 20MB.
That's The Joke Of The Day Man.
Even That 282MB Torrent Is Not Good At All Considering The Huge Size.
