,the_dewd,2010-02-26T16:49Z,"i've been trying to download the Royal Rumble Anthology but every single time i download it it just has stream but no sound. Does anyone know how i can get sound into it? WMP works with everything else i play on it, just not the rumbles. Any help would be very much appreciated!"
