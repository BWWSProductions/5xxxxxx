,Pavow,2010-02-05T04:22Z,"I downloaded the program and ran it, but nothing seems to happen... how do you use it?"
,H4rM,2010-02-06T03:24Z,"You must install the sim, and then instead of starting to play, just start the Launcher for G5. Then start the GetSerial.exe. Once it opens, change the delay to something like .001 and hit start.

But 1st set your number counter in GetSerial to 
02000000   2424138852 which is where I am at."
,alex-rybakk,2010-02-06T17:10Z,any one find it yet ? 
,stamphead1,2010-02-15T01:44Z,Is the code available for this program?
,stamphead1,2010-02-15T01:46Z,I've started at 07000000 and 0800000000 as my g3 and g4 both start here. Does anybody know why it won't accept my interlink number? Changes back to default as soon as I start.
,chronobono1,2010-02-16T21:10Z,"Virus Alert!!

I ran this program and it stayed resident in my process list. After this my norton internet security was disabled and my internetbrowser went crazy!!"
,metaliica,2010-05-11T23:53Z,is this working for anyone?
,badasspunisher,2010-05-28T17:09Z,"I am still running this application. The nice thing is that if ur machine reboots itself or swithches off, it will remeber the last position so u can start again where it left off. Howz other ppl doing with it?"
,badasspunisher,2010-05-28T17:12Z,Maybe because G5 is a whole new release it needs the G5 hardware serial? I only have G3 hardware serial.
,duarte,2010-06-15T18:47Z,"hi, mine is

,_Stormy,2010-08-01T15:17Z,"emu V3.3 does not work with RealFlight G5

Neither could I locate the mentioned V3.4 anywhere.

Can someone confirm the latest emu available for G5 ?"
,leezaal40,2010-11-02T21:45Z,"Interhead did you EVER get this to generate a valid serial ! lol. i think not ! totally fake in my opinion!
in the write up you say,""if we can work together, then we can find the serial"". so you obviously have never got this to work..lol"
,bullseye[0],2011-01-27T17:34Z,"So now that everyone is using 
Interlink Elite: 3987906-I3-399835
and:
RealFlight G5: 61546410-G5-1415546494
It will take but in order to play you have to email this information back to tech support and then they email you an activation key to initiate on-line ! "
,Relsmurf,2011-02-23T18:54Z,"installed realflight G5, but does any one know to get it to work? is there a emulator for it of does some have a useable serial number or is there a crack for it? please help"
,mavericklx70,2011-04-28T21:30Z,"Guys,
