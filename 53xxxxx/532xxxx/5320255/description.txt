A recently retired, convalescing Jim Gordon, takes a trip to the shore for some much-deserved rest and relaxation.  Soon after he registers at an old seaside resort, a body shows up and a murder-mystery is suddenly his to unravel!  But will his investigation be derailed by a Batman-obsessed youngster? 

Written and Illustrated by Scott Morse (Soulwind).
