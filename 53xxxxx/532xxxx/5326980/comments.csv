A little hint: Uploading torrents sort of gives you the obligation to seed them at the start, until a few people have finished the torrent atleast. If you don't, you will get a fuckload of angry people yelling at you for wasting there time and whatever.. So yeah. I would seed if I was you.

(That goes towards your other two torrents as well btw.)"
,LubnanMan,2010-02-17T01:27Z,"agree with lykknis...
