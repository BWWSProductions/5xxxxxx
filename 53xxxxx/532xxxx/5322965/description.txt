 Dating back to the time of Jesus Christ, an ancient relic known as the Loculus 
has been fought over by the forces of light and darkness down the centuries. 
Created in 50 AD, the wood panels of the Loculus are emblazoned with two images: 
the Ankh symbol - a looped crucifix - and the Caduceus - a rod entwined with two 
serpents. On its perilous journey through history, the Loculus was further adorned 
with more arcane mystical imagery including pentagrams, hexagrams, a crucified 
serpent, the naked human form divine and a hermaphrodite. And many have tried to 
unlock the secret of the sacred artefact - a secret only a chosen few know contains
 profound and overwhelming ramifications for mankind. In 1299 a Jewish alchemist's
 attempts to unravel the enigma ended in disaster. And in 1710 Sir Isaac Newton,
 discoverer of the laws of gravity and a foremost member of the Masonic Order of 
the Knights Templar, also strove to answer the riddle. But with the art of science 
in its infancy, Newton realised the Underground Stream of research needed to solve 
the puzzle would have to flow for several more centuries before the prophesied 
ultimate Great Work could be wrought in all its glory. Now, the Loculus, missing
 for hundreds of years, has reappeared again... Revelation tells the story of the 
final search for the Loculus and its effect on the Martel family and the whole world.
