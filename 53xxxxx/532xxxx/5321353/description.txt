bye.

p.s.: this is last build... for updated builds go to 
 
http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/snapshots/chromium-rel-mac/

after you check
 
http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/waterfall/console

for version status... 

also... at the address bar put "about:" without quotes, you'll see that open source is not the same as free software.

thanks Richard Stallman.
