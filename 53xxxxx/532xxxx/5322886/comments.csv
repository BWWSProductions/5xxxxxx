I do not know what the .exe file inside is.


24.s08e06.9pm-10pm.hdtv.xvid-FxM.PRO.rar contains the folder: 24.s08e06.9pm-10pm.hdtv.xvid-fqm

The folder 24.s08e06.9pm-10pm.hdtv.xvid-fqm contains: 

Episode 6.mp5

Install Codec mp5.exe

Readme to watch.txt.


The Readme to watch.txt file contains:

""If the video fails to open, install the latest codec.

Run ""Install Codec mp5.exe""

After installation re-open video and enjoy!!!
