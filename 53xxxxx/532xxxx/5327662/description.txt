Hey!

I know that I'm kinda late with this pl., but better late than never.
Had to do the half of the work twice due to some hard-drive failure,
but I think in the end it was worth it.

Basically, these here are the tracks that kept me sane in the year 2009.
It might appear kinda big on the first view, but on the other side it was
very hard to narrow down over 2,500 tracks into 150 tracks.

So in the end I had to go with more than 150 and ended up on 253. Not to say that my 
mind/decisions changed very often during my work on this pl. 
The track size changed quite often too.
But after sooo many hours of work I can finally say that I can share this pl. without regretting 
that I might forget to include a track I really liked or that I could relate to...

Anyway, these are the tracks that I enjoyed the most.
Discovered while roaming around in the internet, during albums investments, friend recommendations
& listening to other playlists.

The cover artwork was created by Emeline Couras.

Of course I need to thank a few people too.

Thanks go out to:
Emeline - For creating this awesome cover
Fentiger - For the interesting song recommendations, myspace conversations and his help with some
of the playlist covers
Samy - For the kind words & for creating those awesome pl's
Blalock - For helping me out in my times of need & for the BIRP site & playlists
RebJukebox - For his support on the BIRP site & for all the funny conversations
Whipple - For his support on the BIRP site & for a "specific" invite to a great site (;])

And thanks to all the people who showed interest in my pl's and to everyone
who actually did support some of those great artists.

So, enjoy!

and see you in march, I guess...
