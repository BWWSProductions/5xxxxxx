From Wiki:


SNFU is a Canadian punk rock band which formed in 1981, was disbanded between 1989 and 1991 before reforming, broke up in 2005, and again reassembled in 2007.

The band began in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, later relocating to Vancouver, British Columbia. They draw influence from various sub-genres of punk rock, including hardcore punk, skate punk and melodic hardcore, utilize sardonic lyrical content and visual aesthetics via lead singer Ken Chinn (Mr. Chi Pig), and initially built their sound around dual guitar work by twin brothers Marc "Muc" and Brent "Bunnt" Belke before being reduced to a single guitar group in 1998.

Since their genesis, SNFU has released seven full-length studio albums, two live records, and an EP. The band has an unusual quirk of releasing albums with seven words in the title.
