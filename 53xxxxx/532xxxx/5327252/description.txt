  In 1989, a breakthrough in advanced parasitic research 
on Cuttyhunk Island, gave scientists a jump in human 
evolution. Initial tests proved promising as subjects 
were experiencing heightened physical and mental strength 
and awareness. But, something in the experiment went horribly 
wrong and the island mysteriously lost three quarters of 
its population. Jamie Akerman fled the outbreak, which 
took her mothers life, twenty years ago. She now returns 
with her boyfriend and step brother, to sell the family property.
