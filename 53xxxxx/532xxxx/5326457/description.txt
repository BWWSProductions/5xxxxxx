Welcome to 2010. Shankly's music collection for the first month of the New Year begins by recognising the Dandelion Radio Festive Fifty as the yardstick that all good music should be measured by. Shankly's collection of these fifty tracks is incomplete and he would be happy to hear from anyone who could help add to it. 

The next 4 CDs worth of tracks are the best of the rest of 2009. These are tracks that came to the ears of Shankly too late to be part of the 2009 compilations, but are included here as songs that no one should have to live without. 

After this you will finally get to the best songs that Janaury hs had to offer us. The usual 4 CDs worth of music is included here with the usual array of cover versions, new singles, new album tracks, remixes and a few live recordings and rarities to boot. 

Enjoy!
