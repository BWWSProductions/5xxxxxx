Every torrent file you upload to TPB is automatically edited to add trackers of our choice, and remove trackers that we do not approve of. It is not necessary to add any trackers.

A tracker just looks up IP addresses of users interested in the torrent. Anyone dumb enough to believe that having a whole bunch of trackers will make downloading work better, should also be prepared to believe that if you owned a large collection of phone books, then the people you reach on the phone will talk faster.

I have therefore deleted your tracker list comments.

The only tracker you need while seeding your torrents is this one:
