1938. Hampstead. Sigmund Freud's study. After some stage shennanigans,
Abraham Yahuda - another psychiatrist - arrives, and starts analysing
Freud to understand why he is wearing his raincoat and has ladies' undies
in his study. Soon Salvadore Dali seems to be the only sane one there.

The play shows Freud with obsessions that led him into weird
misdiagnosis to the significant detriment of some of his patients.
