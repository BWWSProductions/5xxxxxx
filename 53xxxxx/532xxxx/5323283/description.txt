Leona Lewis - I See You (Theme From Avatar) Music Video. MPEG

This video seems to be the only one available on torrent sites at the moment. Looks like a pretty good copy fromalthough I have swapped the audio and used the song from the original soundtrack which is perfect.

You will find 2 versions of the video. One of them being original. The other I have used audio fromsinger Joeypiano1 who does an awesome duet over the top and I think you'll be suprised if not amazed at his vocal ability. 
I have added both the original sountrack version (FLAC) and Joeypiano1 version as mp3 as well.

Just select what you want to download.

Enjoy!
