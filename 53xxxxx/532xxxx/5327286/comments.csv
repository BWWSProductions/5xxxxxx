,blackcanary,2010-02-02T04:41Z,Thanks a lot for this.  I had no problems with this at all. It plays perfectly.

,drawsy,2010-02-02T09:44Z," Hey, kind of new to xbox game downloads, but will Region RF work in Europe , i doubt it since its PAL. But maybe im wrong"
,drawsy,2010-02-02T09:46Z,"Ocrap , does it mean region free ?x D "
,lam4747,2010-02-02T12:49Z,"Is anybody else having trouble getting this to play?
I am using an NME chip.
Every game up until now has been fine no matter what wave etc.
Any advice would be appreciated."
,Isik1987,2010-02-02T13:26Z,"Cant get it to work.

 I haven't had any problems playing wave 4 games using my Boot-disc. But with this game i just  get ""Open disc"" when i insert the game?.

Anything i missed?"
,trunkler,2010-02-02T13:55Z,ntsc?
,lam4747,2010-02-02T14:12Z,"@Isik1987

That is the same as I get.
The drive makes some horrible noises then it says open tray.
Its not NTSC its RF, I checked the image.
There must be something else thats causing the issue."
,willywonka111111,2010-02-02T14:17Z,"I had no problems with this game. Works fine, but i change all my games to wave 3 now to avoid the pain in the ass boot disk. The game itself just didn't captivate me, another devil may cry variant....yawn"
,lam4747,2010-02-02T14:29Z,"Well thats interesting that it worked for you.
I want to play this because I am a huge fan of The Divine Comedy and wanted to see how the imagery had been realized.
Such a shame its not working.
Perhaps I could try wave patching it despite the NME not requiring it."
,lam4747,2010-02-02T15:19Z,"Patched it to wave 3 then associated with NME but still have the same problem.

Any ideas?"
,Phlegeton,2010-02-02T15:36Z,If you dont have the right flash and you dont want or cant do it just use xbox wave patcher works fine for me... great game by the way thou not as good as the book;)
,lam4747,2010-02-02T15:44Z,"My drive is not flashed though. I have an NME chip installed. All other wave 4 games run fine. There is something different about this one.

I have tried it as Wave 4 and as Wave 3 and neither will work.
"
,baxstar_3,2010-02-02T16:53Z,this maybe wave 6 if so it wont work will dl and let you all know
,baxstar_3,2010-02-02T17:04Z,seed seed seed seed seed seed seed 
,lam4747,2010-02-02T17:31Z,"This could be a complete coincidence but I just downloaded the Binaries4ever release from newsgroups and it loads fine without the need for wave patching.
Can't say why it works when this does not."
,Isik1987,2010-02-02T18:21Z,"@lam4747

What is this Binaries4ever?. i guess if it works for you it should work for me too.."
,manetho123,2010-02-02T19:08Z,"Sorry for being noobish but could anyone possible tell me how to make it possible to play pirated games on my xbox 360. Maybe link a tutorial or something, would be really cool if you did. Thanks."
,lam4747,2010-02-02T20:03Z,"@Isik1987

Hey.
Its just another scene release of the ISO.
I downloaded it from newsgroups. 
I would think it would pop up here.

Perhaps if you download any one that is not the STRANGE release you will be OK.

Good luck."
,wolf91man,2010-02-02T20:39Z,thanks:D
,whnunlife,2010-02-03T05:40Z,"If any of you noobs need help with this, you need to install ixtreme firmware.

,bjs123,2010-02-03T09:23Z,"works great, i got 1.6 and just patched the iso to wave 3, no problems at all, nice game. worth the download!"

,dragkhar,2010-02-03T15:35Z,"For anyone who may be having trouble, This game fails every check in the book on abgx360, And thats with it set to level 3. So in other words you should be fine on a banned Xbox, But as far as Live goes your good as banned!"
,baxstar_3,2010-02-03T16:27Z,to play this on xbox live you need the new lt firmware for your drive unless you have a lite-on and you need the update for abgx which is not out yet.......if your going to play off line use an offline profile not your xboxlive profile.......hope this helps...
,baxstar_3,2010-02-03T21:46Z,sorry just read what i wrote if you have a lite-on drive you can get the lt firmware now waiting for the rest you still need the update for abgx which is not out yet.....this is to play on xbox live and your live profile
,tareqshbat,2010-02-04T22:43Z,"hey man I have a fucking problem evry time I download a game and would like to check it out at XDVDMulleter and when I check out iso file so there will be a link that says vidoe file is broken, invalid, ore not present. what does that mean it many time I download a games and would like to check it so it appears here what I can do about it pleasss help ??? 
"
,dragkhar,2010-02-05T05:39Z,"@ baxstar_3, Offline profile or Live profile makes No diffrence, If your disk fails a check and your playing on LT you WILL get banned, So playing on your xbox with an offline profile wont save you from the Hammer when you get on your Online profile.  

Agbx dosent typically take this long for an update, I figure its the game itself or how it was ripped. Long story short, This will get you banned"
,dragkhar,2010-02-08T08:09Z,"Noob moment, Game checks out now. Aparently were up to wave 6! Seems the game is good, but agbx hasnt gotten a video update for waves 5 and 6.  Good gaming!"
