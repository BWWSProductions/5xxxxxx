The Swell Season is a musical duo formed by Irish musician Glen Hansard and Czech singer and pianist MarkÃ©ta IrglovÃ¡. "The Swell Season" name is derived from Hansard's favourite novel by Josef Å kvoreckÃ½ from 1975 bearing the same title. Their debut album goes by the same name.

Since their rise to prominence after starring in the 2007 film Once, they increasingly referred to themselves as "The Swell Season" in promotion of their performances until it has unambiguously become the formal name of their collaboration in 2008.

Enjoy & Seed!
