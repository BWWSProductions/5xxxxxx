MegaPlay NOTES
-The source video is a Telecine, which has been released as a mislabeled screener.
A telecine is the result of capturing each frame of footage directly from the
film reel.
-Compatible with the PS3, XBOX 360 and DivX players.
-The "SAMPLE" folder includes a short video sample, screenshots and a cover
sample.
-Beware of fakes. Anti-P2P groups will post false comments and
fake files. No password or special media player is needed.
-If you Love it...buy it!
