First Gear Pinned 4 - Hardcore Amature Rebels

Since 2006, the First Gear Pinned crew has faced many 
setbacks like broken bones and concussions. After a 
long raw and   emotional journey since the release of
their last movie, they finally found the strength 
to start a new rebellion. This time they even fight 
beyond the borders of Sweden to prove that after this 
war, they are idiots the world will remember. This war 
will be fought on numerous locations like the cold Austrian 
Alps, near the windy beaches of Sweden, and in the humid 
forrest of North America. Their hard work and training 
at their compound will show you that they are more hardcore 
and amature than ever before. Wheelchair Racing Entertainment
would like to present: First Gear Pinned 4!
