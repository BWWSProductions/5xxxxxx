Werner Herzog short film about how there is no bad kids only bad parents. The premise of the film is that a young boy is kept segregated by the rest of his classmates who refuse to have anything to do with them. One day he ends up making friends with a girl in his class and we see what was behind all of the dislike of the boy. Awkward short film that doesn't quite work completely. Certainly its short nature seems to indicate that Herzog had an idea that he went for and that seems to be the problem it's a little too straight forward. Worth a look if you run across it but not something to search out unless you're a Herzog completeist.
