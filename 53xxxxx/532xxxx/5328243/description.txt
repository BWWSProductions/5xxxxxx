ABOUT:
-----------------------------------
This is a rare UGK mix I found on the web and ripped from the original CD in aacplus format (more efficient than mp3s), but just read what Bun B had to say about it...

Bun B: Trill Azz Mixez was originally conceived by DJ Wiz in Nashville. He begged us to do it. This was back when mixtapes were actually "mixtapes" and was only available in mom and pop stores. Wiz used to do a lot of Cash Money and No Limit mixtapes and he always wanted to do one with us. We'd always just be like "yeah, aight, whatever." But, when we started having all of the label trouble we said we should do a mixtape and go ahead and put it out with Wiz. After it came out everywhere we went, people wanted it. We'd never have enough copies of it. To this day we still don't. We'd always talk about bringing it back and re-releasing it. We actually did shows in the Midwest and the majority of the show would be based off the mixtape. It created income and we sold them at shows. Big up to DJ Wiz, he was an undying supporter of UGK. He helped us understand the scope of our spread. Doing that tape with him is the reason why we put the UGK logo big as hell on all of our CDs now.

P.S.: m4a format is more efficient than mp3 so don't get mad cuz it's works most players (winamp, wmp, itunes, ipod etc.) and sounds better than huge 320kbps mp3s. you should consider switchin to m4a like I did.
