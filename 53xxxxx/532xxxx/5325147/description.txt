The Gods of Times Square.avi
Props to ryder275 for the original up and summary, props to Turdis for the encode.

I saw this movie last week and I just can't get it out of my head. It's a feature-length video document of all the street preachers and religious fanatics that used to hang out on 42nd Street before Disney cleaned it up. The vignettes range from scary (black militants advocating a genocidal religious war against the white man) to ridiculous (a man who thinks he's Jesus and is predestined to marry Madonna) to comical (another man dressed as a priest carries a huge stuffed Mickey Mouse into the Times Square Disney Store yelling "Mickey Mouse is the Anti-Christ!"). As this video was shot around 1993-94, we get depressing footage of those grand old 42nd St. grindhouse theaters being torn down and a family-owned hot dog stand with it.




Doin' Time in Times Square.avi
Props to Webster for the original up and summary, props to drone139x for the encode.

Watch as Charlie Ahearn (director of Wild Style) captures life from a few floors above times square. A mix of junkies, prostitutes, and deals gone wrong mostly observed from his window. All this juxtaposed against his children's birthday parties and chistmas get togethers. The footage is woven together to show Times Square in its final days.

This is the DVD-R with all the extras... There are actully 3 documentaries on this DVD, all the same kinda of documentaries but different neightbourhoods and times filmed..

Richard Sandlers documentaries film different neighbour hoods in New York City over long periods of time, filming the most depressing, crazy, sick, and just rough people on the streets of New York.  Everything from religious zealots preaching insanity to almost normal looking man pretend to strip as tourist walk by... These doc's are very raw and unedited footage that is highly original...

Richard Sandler is a New York photojournalist and documentarian, and it's important to place the city before the profession, since so much of what he does is informed by where he is. Whatever the medium, the aim is authenticity--Sandler pushes to capture the "real" New York, warts and all, from street level and below.

His 2004 documentary Brave New York is an extended montage, assembled from roughly 12 years of camcorder footage shot in and around the East Village. Sandler takes his camera out to parks, street corners, and sidewalks, hanging out and shooting what he sees. He also lets people talk--street people and artists and passerby, mostly the kind of folks who would be talking non-stop anyway, whether there was a camera pointed at them or not.

Sandler's camera drifts from person to person, place to place, time period to time period. He spends some time with the drag queens at Wigstock '92, joins protestors of the Tompkins Square Park curfew (they chant "Fuck Giuliani!," a lot), and observes various subway happenings. New Yorkers can always find something to protest or boycott, and we see the notorious anti-consumerist street performer Reverend Billy promoting boycotts of the neighborhood Starbucks and Barnes & Noble.

There are flashes of 9/11 imagery throughout the first half of Brave New York's hour-ish running time, until that event takes over the second half of the film. Strangely, Sandler doesn't quite capture the strange atmosphere of the city in those first days and weeks following the attacks; instead of the poetic images that dominate the first half, he tends to let his interview subjects ramble on for too long on the subject of terrorism and America. There are some interesting insights, but the film could have benefitted from some tightening in the home stretch. It also could have done with a little less of Sandler's tinkering with shutter speed and other in-camera effects; these touches are sometimes effective, but sometimes merely amateurish.

Brave New York is occasionally aimless, but it is consistently fascinating--in its patience, voyeurism, and attentiveness to detail, it captures the real New York in a way that few films have (especially in its perfect closing shot). Some audiences may be put-off by its free-form structure and homemade feel, but it is a valuable document of a neighborhood that seems to be quietly slipping away.

Extras:

Two of Sandler's later, shorter documentaries are included as bonus features; both are interesting (and stylistically similar). The 2006 film SWAY, (34:10) is comprised entirely of subway images and audio, reportedly assembled from a decade's worth of underground shooting. There's very little in the way of dialogue, just occasional words and music; the aural focus is the train. SWAY is fascinating, voyeuristic, accurate, and entirely too long; as it passes the thirty-minute mark, you start to think you missed your stop. Worth a look, but hop off whenever you'd like.

His most recent montage doc, Subway to the Former East Village, (32:23) is comprised of more East Village street scenes, feeling like outtakes to (or an extension of) Brave New York. Sandler returns to Woodstock, checks back in with Reverend Billy, and so on.
