,jactor299,2010-02-01T18:31Z,"thanx for ur upload Kk, i m new to using patches, could u pls elt me know how to use the license or patch file? i installed it says 30 days. clicked the license file it opened in some language other than english which i couldn't understand............could u pls help? ty"
[V],kentucky-kid,2010-02-01T18:45Z,"**MAKE SURE THE PROGRAM IS COMPLETELY CLOSED BEFORE DOING THIS(FROM TASKBAR AS WELL)**

1. Apply the patch(lavalicense) first. Run it, and click the ""Instalar"" button. 

2. Next, copy and paste the crack (lavalicense.dll cracked) into the installation directory(C:/Program Files>Lavasoft Adaware) 

3.After copying that file, rename it to lavalicense.dll(note that i removed the word ""cracked"" there). You will be prompt if you wish to over-write the existing ""lavalicense.dll"", click yes.

4. Done

**My bad for not including this instruction file in the torrent itself, was rushing while creating this. :)"
,jactor299,2010-02-01T18:57Z,"thnx for ur quick respose kk..............i did exactlly as per ur instructions..........but after renaming file, it didn't ask me if i want to overwrite exisitng file. Instead it is just there, but the difference is, its an application file whereas the original lavalicense.dll file is an application extenstion............btw all this is on windows 7 64 bit.....what could be wrong? or will it work as it is?"
[V],kentucky-kid,2010-02-01T19:19Z,"@jactor299
you tried running the program? what did it say? i've not tested it on x64. only tested on windows xp pro :/"
,jactor299,2010-02-01T19:21Z,no i haven't tested runing the program as yet...........will try shortly and see what happens.....thnx kk
,jactor299,2010-02-01T19:38Z,"i restarted my pc and started adaware pro........its stilla trial version with and expiry date of Feb 1, 2010........crack doesn't seem to have worked for me..........can something be done to fix it??"
,xhail78,2010-02-05T21:04Z,the crack aint working...the program says error in license please buy new!!!i copied and pasted and over writed the dll file but still doesnt work ...any help on this is
,chacki111,2010-02-10T16:48Z,"all work very good, phanks
crack is working.
1) install programm
2) use crack
3) delete file lavalicense.dll, because windows 7 was not change, and restart
4) update and use until 3.12.2010"
,jack_the_pirate,2010-02-17T05:10Z,Program is perfect and words fine but word of WARNING!!! any cracks or patches and keygens you have from other programs are AUTOMATICALLY scanned and REMOVED by this version of Ad-Aware!!! It was gay 1/2 my games done work b/c it removed the .exe's for them.
,spriteyone,2010-03-08T22:24Z,"Yikes..anyway to override the auto removal of the keygens and cracks?  

Also...new here, but....could the crack not working and the expiration date issue have anything to do with the fact that there is a newer version of this software released?"
,mrhozer,2010-06-30T20:54Z,"Looks like the cracked file is supposed to be a dll file, instead it's an exe file. I don't think windows 7 allows you to modify dll files like you could in win xp.

Even though the crack file is called lavalicense.dll it's actually an exe file as you can see in the properties. I'm guessing the goal of the crack is to replace the actual lavalicense.dll with another true dll file. I don't see how this can be done in windows unless you go through a program that allows you to save files as dll format."
,ivianny,2010-07-02T18:27Z,"Doesn't work on Win7 x64

Kid tested mother approved lol...

Good job anyway k-k"
,Mythed,2010-07-03T01:58Z,"installed on my win7 x64 just fine but couldnt get the crack to work, first time it said expires 1 month from now, next time it said expires tomorrow and on third time it was already expired, doesn't matter to me tho since i only need to use it right now
mrhozer>
on your explorers hit Tools > Folder options > View > uncheck ""Hide extensions for known file types""
also, yes. after scan it just removed everything it found without asking anything but since i used the smart scan it didnt check for my games & apps.

cheers"

,biplob361,2010-08-09T14:12Z,"Hi, I just dowload it, not tried yet. How long it will work? "
,free2flie,2010-09-14T02:25Z,"Scanned with AVG and came up clean. 

Not to say i doubted our good friend KK's honesty, but just to pacify a few paranoid people out there who don't trust the TPB VIP tag. 

Cheers KK! :)"
,free2flie,2010-09-14T23:26Z,"KK: now i'm really pissed! i tried EVERYTHING, followed your instructions, uninstalled and reinstalled, turned the computer off and on, but it STILL DOESN'T WORK! what do i do?? "
,banJo07,2010-09-22T04:38Z,"I finally made it work. But when i updated it. It went back to being a ""not full"" version. So i guess that the license, re. to the old version..?"
,Dufuzsky,2010-09-25T00:52Z,"I've done everything that I need to do, to get AD-Aware to work. And it did until today, when the licence expired. (25.09.10) Did you only use a 1month period licence or what?
I don't question your torrents or you, because I have been downloading some of them and they work 110% :) Just want an answer to my problem :P"
,dearghoul,2010-10-16T11:55Z,"I haven't grabbed this fully yet, but generally, you have to recopy the .dll over again after every update. And turn off auto updates if you don't want it reverting to the trial on you! Shut down the program totally from the toolbar before you copy that .dll too!"
,dearghoul,2010-10-16T12:42Z,"OK, why is there an .exe file called lavalicence.dll? This is majorly bogus.
I changed the name, stuck it in main folder and there it sits. It's not a .dll, it's an .exe and does nothing.
I cry bullshit."
,6545342de7,2010-12-18T17:50Z,"i got theworst kind of virus ever.
the famous svchost 100% virus.

i got a nasty backdoor trojan on my pc , problem is avg and spywaredoctor cant trace the virus.
but i know its there , goz my svchost is going nuts in task manager and is showing 100% cpu and a mem  above 40000kb which should be around 20000kb at normal state.
norton can detect and remove the trojam virus. 
but somehow it returns .
ive disabled system restore and deleted all files in my temp folders .

still the virus can restore itself.

so i hope ad aware can trace the exe file were this nasty backdoor trojan hides in.

wish me luck .
i will post a comment if your upload  helped me out.
cheers and thnx"
,6545342de7,2010-12-18T19:13Z,"the crack has extended the trial period ,but its still a trial.

however i was able to run a full system scan and it removed a nasty trojan,
that was the whole idea in the first place .
so your upload helped me 100% .

i will try to download the latest version and see if i can find a crack to go with it.

thnx again m8 "
,Barroquecore,2011-01-28T05:59Z,"Thanks man. It looks like it's working but I just got it today so, we'll see what happens along the way."

,akhnaten,2011-07-21T06:41Z,"Tried it a couple of times on Windows 7 Ultimate x64bit...no luck. =( Thanks though! And yes, I went to compatibility and changed it to Windows XP SP3"
,longjohnshane,2011-09-08T15:06Z,What's with the spanish writing.. on the lavalicense file
,Hlussus,2011-11-01T14:07Z,"from Dearghoul: ""OK, why is there an .exe file called lavalicence.dll? This is majorly bogus.

I have the same shit problem, does anybody know how to change the .exe to .dll file format??,cuz renaming wont work."
,manicgirl,2012-01-02T20:31Z,the crack that come's with the program is not english
,po2reyes,2012-01-18T05:34Z,Tried it like 7 times before it worked. Remember **MAKE SURE THE PROGRAM IS COMPLETELY CLOSED BEFORE DOING THIS(FROM TASKBAR AS WELL)** Thanks kentucky-kid
,wakaju,2012-07-08T20:55Z,"Installed.Cracked
Won't run.
Automatic update...ok go ahead.
Even after downloading the torrent...the update manager re-downloads and re-installs the whole damn program.

and the best thing is....IT STILL WON'T WORK"
