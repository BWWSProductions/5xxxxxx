,flip69,2010-01-31T18:31Z,I wonder what this is. The companies web site still says V 8.0 is the current version. I know a newer version is overdue but this is strange. K-K please explain.
,theone_nr,2010-01-31T19:02Z,REAL Thing ! Posted from a TRUSTED source ! TNX !

go here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Video-Recording/WinAVI-Video-Converter.shtml

Click the download button, after download finish, run the installer. It will state there it's version 10, although the site itself says it's version 8.

is that enough for you? or should i give links to other trusted download sites like cnet, majorgeeks etc? :)"
,flip69,2010-01-31T20:22Z,"WOW!!!! This is really version 10!!!! Thanks KK!!

Now all I have to do is figure it all out. Winavi V8 was my favorite program but this is very exciting.

Thanks again."

,Sublime420,2010-02-01T15:14Z,"Hey guys when I go to burn files to dvd now it says select a burning software in the options.

What burning software do you guys use?"
[V],Mbb15,2010-02-01T21:55Z,hmm it crashed when I add a file...
[V],Mbb15,2010-02-01T22:03Z,Database error.
[V],Mbb15,2010-02-01T22:04Z,I cant convert avi to avi it did that because fraps files are hugh but wmv to avi works etc
[V],kentucky-kid,2010-02-02T02:10Z,"@Mbb15
The problem lies at your end. This torrent didn't come with patch/crack, so it's got nothing to do with this torrent. Maybe you should get a new PC. :)"
,Sublime420,2010-02-02T06:22Z,Hey what burning software should I use with this program? Any suggestions please.
,Killbill21,2010-02-02T14:02Z,Thank you KK.  Just what I was wanting to review before buying.  Thanks again.
[V],Mbb15,2010-02-02T16:49Z,I noticed now that winavi crashed when I use recorder files from fraps... and that was the main reason I used that converter so I go back to version 9 but thanks for this upload.
,dragon766,2010-02-03T05:35Z,Another great one kk works great Thank you! I have been looking for a simple app to convert DL vids to something that will play on a regular dvd player not up on all this conversion stuff but this looks to be working
,Ouzotime,2010-02-22T22:11Z,tyvm for another fine app hope it works for me also been using this for a few years shame it only converts but no burning software...cheers

,fairytales,2010-05-11T00:05Z,"I D/L this torrent , it is similar to format factory ( free program here and easy to find direct on the net ) , I dont know why they changed their style dramatically , I use format factory and their old winavi 8 or 9 ( same just look different ) and from the options I ask it to use external coding using both is ok for me for most of my use"
