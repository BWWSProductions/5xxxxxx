,zippyderppyguy,2011-01-26T07:41Z,"Plays fine Globe. Stayed up all night killing my fingers on this game. Will buy soon! Game runs fast, even off the drive and I have a slow storage drive lol No skipping, not stuttering, loving it. A bit graphic heavy, so you guys have to make sure your system is up to date :)

One more note, if you're a TR fan, this game is going to make your heart stop. Plays just like the older ones, with a few up dates. like graphics, new pop up map, gun caring is limited to two types plus grenade. Not sure about vehicle use, only on the 3rd or 4th level, but I did see a motorcycle already... So who knows what the future holds :D "
,crants36,2011-02-11T00:49Z,"25 mins to extract the archive, 36 mins to convert the globe file, 134 mins to unrar the bigfiles, extract maxed out me memory, convert maxed out me processor... to cut a long story short, prefer to just download a bigger file, it's much simpler (and possibly quicker, at least less arsing about)."
,StellarVision,2011-04-21T15:40Z,"Time consuming but at least it was easy. I didn't have to insert any patches, and for an avg user, it was simple. Finally software from a torrent that is easy to install, and works. Thanks uploader-this game is kickass compared to the one's I grew up playing on PS1"
