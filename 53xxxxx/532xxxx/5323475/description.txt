Download entire Web sites off of the Internet, and save them on your hard drive...

 If you are viewing a Web site with your browser and you decide that you would like to make a
 copy of it on your hard drive, you have to manually save each page as you view it along with
 embedded pictures, sounds and so on. This can be a very long and tedious process, and in many
 cases it's more trouble than it's worth. It doesn't have to be that way, however, as Web Dumper
 makes this whole process very fast and easy.

 With Web Dumper you can download entire Websites off of the Internet, and save them on your hard
 drive for later offline browsing. Downloaded Web sites are saved on your hard drive with their
 directory structure intact. Web Dumper automatically downloads HTML documents along with their
 embedded pictures, sounds, movies and so on while it screens them to look for any enclosed links
 to other documents.

 Web Dumper lets you select which kinds of file you want to be dumped between more than 60
 available standard types, the folder depth level, how links must be processed and if it must
 re-link your HTML documents for offline browsing.
