,crownluv,2010-02-09T06:36Z,"I downloaded everything fine, but I'm getting a msg in system saying 3 days until automatic activation.  Is there a problem with this, or will it activate and I don't need to do anything?  Thanks"
,redwalnut,2010-02-09T06:52Z,"@crownluv:
u need to b connected to the internet while u do the setup.

refer previous comment.
DELL can get auto-activation, make sure u've updated ur BIOS to match the SLIC 2.1 !

if u r using it on a non-DELL PC, u need activator / loader which u can get on TBP.

if u r using on DELL PC but were not connected to internet while doing the setup, insert the setup disc in the DVD drive & locate ""autounattend"" on the root. open it, & u'll find the OEM key, use it to activate ur WIN 7 online.

[T],torrentshredder,2010-02-09T18:50Z,"what language is this dell oem? from what country was this iso created? what country was this dell system sold in/to ?

us-en? some other place?

what do you mean slipstreamed from professional? not sold directly with ultimate? how did you do the slipstream? what is the source for the ultimate key, or how does it activate for ultimate? i am wondering how this is supposed to work if the dell slic was originally signed for the professional version only.

care to enlighten us?
greets."
,derbuzz2001,2010-02-09T19:08Z,"i did what you said i opened the file autounattend and pulled the key 342DG-6YJR8-X92GV-V7DCV-P4K27 from it and i get a message telling me....
The product key you have entered does not appear to be a valid Windows 7 product key.
Please check your product key, and type it again
so this key does not work any other ideas....."
,derbuzz2001,2010-02-09T19:09Z,o by the way I'm on a dell precision 380.. 3.20 ghz processor 6gb of ram running this x64 bit os
,redwalnut,2010-02-09T22:12Z,"yes, it's EN-US.
OEM key was taken from the forums on which it was shared.. it's DELL OEM key for WIN 7 Ultimate. u can verify that..

how did i slipstream?.. now that's real funny, there r utilities like VLite for that, it's not a very complicated process anymore.

i did not get DELL OEM for WIN 7 Ultimate, so i slipstreamed it from Pro.

""autounattend"" was created for the sole purpose of activating Ultimate version.

& above all, DELL SLIC is a BIOS feature. it is not designed for any particular edition of windows..but it is universal for all.

The DISC only verifies if the PC on which it is being installed has the SLIC for the particular BRAND.

I installed it on my DELL Studio 1555, a couple of times & tested for a week if everything is normal & then only i posted it on TPB.
i had to update my BIOS to ""A09"" [which is not available now on DELL support center, they've reverted back to ""A08""] & it never gave me any problem for activation..

if anyone wants that BIOS i can post it too.. let me know.

hope i cleared most of the doubts."
,redwalnut,2010-02-09T22:35Z,"@derbuzz2001:
did u update ur BIOS?

check if it is SLIC 2.10 compliant..
u can use RW everyth for that, google it & u'll know how to find out the info. refer mydigitallife.

when Vista was launched SLIC v 2.0 was created and all the laptops/Pcs that hit the marked from a vendor came with that version.Now when people installed vista from the OEM DVD in the OEM machine they never asked for any product key and it was already activated whareas if the same DVD is used for installation in any other Pc (Non OEM) then it will ask for a product key and also you would need to activate the product with in a period of time. So the hacks that came out for Vista was a Bios emulator which actually emulated the Bios of a real OEM , and it used to load while booting and post boot the certificates used to pass thinking it was a OEM. That was SLIC 2.0. but now M$ came up with SLIC 2.1, that means the laptops that has 2.0 will not install and activate DVDs created for 2.1."
,redwalnut,2010-02-09T22:38Z,"happy to help brothers...

is there anyone who has got this working right???"
,crownluv,2010-02-10T02:32Z,Thanks....I did the bios update and it automatically activated without me opening the other file to get the key.  Thanks again.

ur BIOS was released on 02.12.2009,

,Snippet90,2010-02-24T22:20Z,"I'm proud to say that I finally got this version of windows 7 working on my Dell studio 1555 :D

Anyways here's how i did it:

1. Please note that this only works on Dell computers!

2. Burned this iso to an empty dvd, bootable ofcourse.

3. I made sure that I updated my BIOS to match the SLIC 2.1. (See other comments to see how you do that).

4. Did a clean install of this version of Windows 7. Formated the old OS harddrive and installed.

If you get the error: ""No drives were found. Click Load Driver to provide a mass storage driver for installation""

Do this:

Download SATA Drives for your dell from ""Dell Support"" and copy them to an usb flash drive. Try a new clean install but this time with the usb flash drive (with the SATA Drives) connected to the computer.

And with this shity guide I was able to install a genuine windows 7 on my dell pc! :D :D :D Thx a lot for posting this windows 7 ""redwalnut"" :D :D And thank you for posting the A09 bios even though I think I didn't need it. A08 from Dell has SLIC 2.1."
