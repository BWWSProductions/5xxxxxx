,gdex0p,2010-11-23T15:20Z,Are the subtitles hardcoded? 
[V],thegoldman,2010-12-08T13:40Z,"Nopes, that subtitles are not hardcoded... .SRT file is present, which is the separate file. Delete it or don't download it and the movie will play without any subtitles.."

,nomadgen,2011-02-06T01:45Z,"TY for the movie. 
May I know how to activate the subtitles? I'm using WMP 9 and there's no subtitles. :/"
,Pakosje,2011-04-07T21:40Z,"@Nomadgen,

You don't need to activate something. 

But you have to Download, K-Lite Mega Codec Pack. Wich you can Search and download From Google.

After installing it, just make sure the name of the movie and SUB are the same one. And make sure that both files are in the same Directory..

And then just playit with Windows media player."
