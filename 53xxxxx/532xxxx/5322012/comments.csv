I can't vouch for this utility but it claims to be able to convert to MP3 for you... http://www.maniactools.com/soft/m4a-to-mp3-converter/

M4A = audio only with alleged improved compression and fidelity beyond MP3

M4B = adds bookmarking "

haven't gotten to listen to book yet, anyone enjoy it and was it up to par?"
