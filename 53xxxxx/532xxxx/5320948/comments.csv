I have a huge problem - an hour ago Songbird erased my entie harddrive with almost all my music. Most of it I can replace myself - but a lot I think I got from you. If you could assist me, with the albums I really canÂ´t get hold of - I would be i debt to you.
The list is as follows:
Barry Goudreau - same name.
City Boy - as mny as you have.
David Pack - all you have.
David Roberts - All dressed up
Franke and the knockouts - all you have.
Honeymoon Suite - The big prize.
I-Ten - Taking a cold look.
Joseph Williams - all you have.
Marc Jordan - All you have 
Michael Landau - all you have
Mr. Mister - all you have
Nielson - Pearson - all you have
Orion - The Hunter.
Pages - Pages
Pilot - all you have.
Prism - all you have
Scandal - The Warrior.

I know its a lot to ask - and if you wonÂ´t help I will understand perfecly - just hope - HOPe you will :-)

Many warm thoughts
Jennerden"
