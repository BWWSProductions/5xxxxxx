Short film directed by Peter Mullan

Author: Drew Leavy

Fridge is set in a Glaswegian slum, where a homeless couple struggle to free a child trapped in an abandoned fridge. The action unfolds simply, with indifference and misunderstanding, compounded by the couple's own alcoholism and vestigal existence, leading towards a potential tragedy. The photography and performances are beautiful and compelling and natural. There is no sign of artifice, just anger and indignation. These are people who do not ask for pity or even understanding, just that they be allowed to live their lives unjudged and undisturbed.

This is compelling, beautiful film making, which has not left my mind since I watched it.
