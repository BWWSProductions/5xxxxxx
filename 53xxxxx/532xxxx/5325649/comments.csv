Open it with notepad and replace fullresolution=1024x768 with your current screen resolution.
Save the changes and try again."

Thanks so much for this torrent."
,Eqa5cro,2010-10-16T03:05Z,"To run in windowed mode, go to the DOSBox folder, and open dosbox.conf.
Go to the line 20 and change it from fullscreen=true to fullscreen=false.
Save the changes and start the game. ;)"

,Eqa5cro,2010-11-30T01:34Z,"@bloodplayr1989
Blood with Plasma contains original 4 episodes of Blood and an extra episode from Plasma Pak (postmortem).
If you played Blood with Plasma, you played the original Blood. :)"
,MexMeRcUrY,2011-03-01T03:11Z,"OMG dude! you are my heroe! I have the original CDs and Sharing on my web site 

www.undergroundgeeks.net

,matthew_rs7,2011-03-29T18:37Z,"This torrent is FANTASTIC! I own both blood 1 and 2 (but not the Nightmare levels) and I am very excited to be able to run the game so easily on Windows 7.

The 2 best things about this torrent are:

1.) In blood 1, the controls have been re-defined. Using WASD (making the change is easy) but to aim, you use the mouse like in modern FPSs as opposed to the arrow keys. This was a change that I tried to do but failed.

2.) Blood 1 uses Dos Box. I haven't used Dos Box in a while and it looks very different, but with this, you run from the game's .exe as opposed to launching Dosbox and typing in all the crap.

On the negative side:

Intro videos were removed, even the Monolith logo and the GT Interactive logo was removed.

Blood 2 also has a tenancy to have a window around the border of the screen to flicker for 1 frame."
,Efunkmaster,2011-04-06T13:20Z,"carefull with both files. they are contaminated with a Suspicious.Cloud.5 trojan.
i suggest the host removes the upload. or just simply reupload a clean one"

,matthew_rs7,2011-04-10T02:08Z,I am having problems with Nightmare levels crashing. during the intro cutscene. It keeps crashing and it won't pass that part and I can't skip the cutscene.
,Eqa5cro,2011-04-26T11:44Z,"@matthew_rs7
Nightmare levels work fine for me, sorry but I can't help you with that.
As for intro videos, only Monolith and GTI logos ware removed as OUWB has them, but doesn't use them for some reason.

@efunkmaster
Stop trolling, there is no fcking virus or anything similar in this torrent."
,Blarg5290,2011-04-27T20:14Z,"I just downloaded it and when i tried to extract it, Norton says that it detected and deleted a virus. Its the same Suspicious.Cloud.5 trojan that Efunkmaster mentioned. I don't think he's trollin. These files are definitley contaminated."
,Blarg5290,2011-04-27T20:28Z,Got the same Suspicious.Cloud.5 trojan that Efunkmaster mentioned when I tried to extract it. Good thing Norton blocked it. These files are definitely contaminated.
,vinnie528,2011-05-02T10:13Z,"thanks man great game and has the cutscenes too, many thanks ure a star,..."
,Eqa5cro,2011-05-19T03:18Z,"@Blarg5290
Ok, go and buy an official Half-Life: Opposing Force disk.
Now scan it with your precious antivirus software and start flaming Valve for including infected files.
These files are note infected, these are false detections by your antivirus."
,Blaxraptor,2011-06-02T01:53Z,"thanks for the upload, i was having lots of trouble getting my copy of blood to run in windows 7 until i found this. torrent finished in ~20 mins even with other p2p progs running. fast and efficient yeah!!"

,GSTAR321,2011-10-21T03:37Z,"I tried running the setup file but I get the following message ""The version of the file is not compatible with the version of windows your running ... ""

Any ideas?"
