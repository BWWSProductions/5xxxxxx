Game Info
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Blood" is a horror science-fiction first-person shooter video game developed
by 3D Realms and Monolith Productions and distributed by GT Interactive. The
game contains excessive graphic violence and a crude style of humour. Year is
1928, you start as Caleb, a gun-slinger from western Texas born in in 1847.
He was one of the four supreme commanders (Chosen) of a cult called the Cabal,
worshippers of the forgotten god Tchernobog. After all four of the Chosen were
betrayed and killed by Tchernobog, Cabal raises back from dead seeking 
vengeance. Armed with a pitchfork, you begin your way from a hollow grave...
It was released on May 31, 1997.

"Blood: Cryptic Passage" is the first expansion for Blood. It was published
by Sunstorm Interactive and is the only officially authorized commercially
available ten-level add-on episode for Blood that was not made by Monolith.
Having heard news of an ancient scroll, Caleb sets out to retrieve it for his
own dark needs. He arrives on the Boat Docks, which later open onto a large
cave, a cabin and a lighthouse; structures overrun by the Cabal.
It was released on June 30, 1997.

"Blood: Plasma Pak" is the second expansion for Blood. It adds a new episode,
new enemies and numerous bug fixes. The new creatures include two new Cabal
loyalist types, Crysalid pods, the miniature Calebs and a new boss. There are
no additions to Caleb's arsenal, however several innovations are introduced;
the Tesla cannon can now be wielded akimbo, while the Napalm cannon and the
life leech have new secondary attacks. The story is based on Caleb learning
that the Cabal is training replacements for the fallen Chosen. He sets out to
stop the cult's plans. It was released on September 01, 1997.

"Blood II: The Chosen" is a sequel to Blood. Unlike the first installment, 
which was set in 1928, Blood II takes place in the year 2028, so in addition
to conventional weapons and magical items also incorporates science-fictional
technology. After killing Tchernobog, Caleb has spent the last century
searching for a way to resurrect his comrades. In the meantime, Cabal has
turned the cult into a global mega-corporation called CabalCo, which uses its
economic influence to control the world's populace. This is all thanks to
Gideon, the Cabal's current leader who has been raised to restore Tchernobog
and destroy Caleb, who is now called the Great Betrayer.
It was released on October 31, 1998.

"Blood II: The Nightmare Levels" is an expansion for Blood II. It provides
background information on Caleb, Ophelia, Ishmael, and Gabriella, narrarated by
a deceased Gideon. As the Chosen continue to walk home to their world from the
invading reality, by telling scary stories they attract a beast known as the
Nightmare that captures Caleb. The player then has to relive some of the most
horrific moments of the Chosen's lives - Caleb fighting the Cabal in the frozen
north, the Cabal attack on Ophelia's sorority which led her to join, Ishmael's
escape from his life as a circus freak into the Cabal, and Gabriella's spooky
night in a haunted mansion. It was released on August 01, 1999.

Blood was one of my favorite games during the time of my youth.

Recently I recalled of this game and wanted to play it again.
Since Blood was made back in 1997 for good old DOS, it won't work on newer
GUI operating systems like Windows XP and Windows 7 that easily.

If your operating system is 64-bit, then you won't even be able to install it
since installer, and the game itself, are 16-bit applications, and Microsoft
dropped support for 16-bit applications in 64-bit operating systems.

After I've done some adjustments and finally managed to make it work,
I decided to share it with others as I believe there are people who might
want to try it out, or play it once again.

I've packed the games in two self-extracting archives.
These are all the games form Blood series.

Blood archive was made from installed game of One Unit Whole Blood,
which is the latest official release of this game.

The only thing I removed are the intro videos, but everything else
including ingame cutscenes have been left intact.

All you have to do is extract the archives to some folder and run batch
files to create the shortcuts on your desktop.

You might want to play with video resolution of Blood,
but I don't recommend it unless you know what you are doing.
Files you might want to look at are dosbox.conf and blood.cfg.

As for Blood II, run any of the shortcuts, set up display and
advanced settings to your likeness and play.

Both Blood and Blood II support widescreen resolutions!
Actually, default resolution of Blood is in widescreen format.

I can't assure you everything will work fine because these are very
old games, but at least I made it easier for you to solve the errors
if you encounter any.

Have fun! :)
