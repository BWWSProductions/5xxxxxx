Product Description:
Mad King Ashnard. His country of Daein suffers under the rule of the war's victors. Now, a small band of freedom fighters struggle to end the long, dark night of Daein's oppression. Micaiah, Sothe, and a host of othersâ€”the infamous "Dawn Brigade"â€”rally under the banner of Daein's long-lost prince to bring a new day to this ravaged land. 
>Command the Dawn Brigade and learn the story of their struggle. Then, gain a new perspective by joining Ike and the Greil Mercenaries as they watch Daein's battles spread throughout all of Tellius! 
>Shape your army to suit your strategy by choosing from dozens of unique characters. Will you use close-range attacks, like the brash Edward's sword, or will you attack from afar using Leonardo's bow or Ilyana's lightning magic? 
>Build support relationships between your charactersâ€”as their relationships grow, so do their strengths as they fight together on the battlefield. Guide your army wisely, because if a character falls on the battlefield, he's lost forever! 
>The best-selling strategy title makes its Nintendo Wii debut, with 16:9 widescreen support, newly added for the North American version, bringing you a truly epic experience.
