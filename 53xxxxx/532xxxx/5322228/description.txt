                        |Realism Patch V2.14 for any OF version|
                         --------------------------------------






THIS PATCH CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY OPEN FALCON VERSION, REGARDLESS OF ANY PREVIOUS REALISM PATCHES...!
THE "REALISM PATCH V2.0/2.1x OF" IS ALREADY INCLUDED INTO THIS PATCH, SO YOU ONLY NEED TO APPLY THIS ONE OVER "Falcon4" FOLDER



	It comes with small adds and improvements over realism patch V2.121, increasingly closing the edge around the data reference of some missiles,

once again bringing them to a higher level of realism!!!



These modifications are as follows:



-All of the air to air missiles have been reworked and now they reach their maximum potential range depending on altitude and target aspect, more realistic...,
and now, they cannot reach tremendous speeds and outranges anymore at higher altitudes

-The AIM-9X may now be fired from 120 degrees off borsight using the padlock as the real missile, the AA-11 Archer can only be fired from 67 degrees off borsight,
the IRIS-T can be fired at targets that are behind the launching aircraft from a 160 degrees off borsight position(same as the real one), and the AIM-132
Asraam can be fired from around 90 degrees off borsight!
