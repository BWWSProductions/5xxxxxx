Your going to track his ip to his house huh? Good luck, considering about the most information your going to get is his Internet service provider and city, and state he lives in...from there you would have to contact his ISP and request the address for the IP at that given time...and guess what they dont release that kinda information out to everyday citizens...especially those who talk about putting pistols in peoples mouths.

that being said im gonna download this movie now and watch it with little fear of anyone coming to my house with a pistol :P"

Stop spread your hate around here just cause you dont get any of what you love so much its just disturbing listen to this type of comment instead of actually being helpful, kind and productive. we are all leeching free products. stop attacking people and i dont point that to you. but to everyone. stop attack people and stop being a prick there is no use for flame violence on a site where all share the same interest.

Never failed to have a laugh while waiting for the movies finish downloading.

As for the copyright letters some of you have been getting. You gotta check on several factors but mainly, are you on fix IP? IF you are, do get a IP duper/masker. They can't trace what they can't verify. ALthough SOME may have you believe they can trace your IP to your door step, kindly ignore that. 

If you are connected via DSL with no fix IP, the best they can do is get you ISP to spill the beans. No amount of HACK programs can leech information like that from your ISP's database. If your ISP spills the beans, the most they can get is your phone number, the LAW can't do jack with information like that. Anyone can splice into your phones DSLAM. Basically, it's just not conclusive enough to nail you at court. 

And if you're really paranoid, there are ways to bounce your connection through several DNS and crap.... too technical to explain, easily understood by the initiated.

Peace~ 'Fuck' should be uttered in joy and excitement. Don't degrade it by using it to spread hate."

LERNIN 2 INTERNET 101

1) do not spam comments with your bullshit. We don't care if you run a site full of trojans and malware with the promise of ~streaming the video online~ your site is not better and is full of adware and viruses. gtfo and quit commenting every goddamn top 100 torrent with your advertisements. 

2) Stop spamming with the OMFG DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS THE PARTYVAN IS WATCHIN U bullshit. Columbia/Paramount/Tristar/FBI does not give a shit. You won't get fucking V& for downloading a torrent. The worst that will happen is you'll get a cease and desist notice or they'll block you at your IP and you can just switch providers. STFU and GTFO. Why are you even here, you noobs.

3) Don't expect to get any A/V quality better than a TS or a CAM if the film's still in theaters. Jesus, are you people retarded? either wait for it to come out on video for a better rip or stfu until you can contribute something better.

4) the main purpose of comments on these sites is to warn other users whether a torrent is legit. If it's spam, if the sound or video quality is so bad it's unwatchable, or if it's got malware. This is not he site for your shitty, pseudo-intellectual review tripe. Save that shit for your emo livejournal. Any other comments are useless here.

SO WITH THAT I SAY

For a CAM, it's not bad. The quality's decent enough for you to hear and see everything well enough.

FYI, the reason some movies wont play on some media player is because your computer doesnt have the codec that the movie file was encoded (made) with. using VLC will usually fix that but for some reason if youre still having trouble download and install a codec pack. for Vista something like this; http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Codec-Packs-Video-Codecs/Advanced-Vista-Codec-Package.shtml

1) do not spam comments with your bullshit. We don't care if you run a site full of trojans and malware with the promise of ~streaming the video online~ your site is not better and is full of adware and viruses. gtfo and quit commenting every goddamn top 100 torrent with your advertisements. 

2) Stop spamming with the OMFG DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS THE PARTYVAN IS WATCHIN U bullshit. Columbia/Paramount/Tristar/FBI does not give a shit. You won't get fucking V& for downloading a torrent. The worst that will happen is you'll get a cease and desist notice or they'll block you at your IP and you can just switch providers. STFU and GTFO. Why are you even here, you noobs.

3) Don't expect to get any A/V quality better than a TS or a CAM if the film's still in theaters. Jesus, are you people retarded? either wait for it to come out on video for a better rip or stfu until you can contribute something better.

4) the main purpose of comments on these sites is to warn other users whether a torrent is legit. If it's spam, if the sound or video quality is so bad it's unwatchable, or if it's got malware. This is not he site for your shitty, pseudo-intellectual review tripe. Save that shit for your emo livejournal. Any other comments are useless here.


THANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT, NOOBS."
,danthedan,2010-02-12T22:00Z,"can someone plz help me... i can't figure this out. almost all the movies i get won't play. they used to work but i had to factory reset my pc and i dont know what i did different this time. i use divx player and i have all the codecs and everything. my files are complete. sometimes i can go to a spot in the movie and it will freeze with no audio, sometimes it plays for a few seconds, and sometimes divx player has encountered a problem. any ideas?"

Not even worth the price of a rental though, much like Surrogates, but at least it's over before you know it."
,djME27,2010-02-14T09:27Z,"@danthedan:

First... ""DivX Player?!""  That would be your first silly mistake, and probably the primary reason you can't play this video.  DivX ""player"" is a total waste of hard-drive space, existing only as part of the bundled junk that comes on top of the DivX codec download. It is basically a light-weight player developed to showcase the .divx format it came bundled with; it should not be mistaken for a universal video player that can play all formats without freaking out.  Download VLC player, or something similar, like GOM or Media Player Classic.  All free, all with built-in codecs.
Second: If you have a technical problem with a downloaded movie, etc. that came from a file, please THINK about your issue and who you should ask BEFORE YOU ANNOY EVERYONE HERE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. It's not about your experience or lack thereof; think about it. If you just GLANCE at the posts here, the video obviously works for a LOT of people.  Therefore, your issue is a technical issue, on YOUR computer.  This is not a tech-support forum, and since the uploader is not the creator and designer of the ""complicated and cutting-edge"" .avi technology, he doesn't need to include instructions on how to view it. Come on.  It's an AVI file, the most common shit out there.  AVI=hellacommon + works for everyone but you = stop ANNOYING US and post your questions on a tech site.  I have to scroll through 9 pages of posts just like yours to find audio/video ratings. ...look.  Not tryin to pick on you, this is a blanket angry vent cuz we get this exact crap ALL THE TIME, and you need an explanation of what a ""noob"" is so you know what it means as people much angrier than I throw a handful of expletives at your next post (or, like this time, just ignore your question entirely).  So, all done.  Rant complete.  What have I achieved here? Lets cover the facts.
- Read your post.  Caused annoyance levels to spike, triggering level 3 tantrum. Considered throwing a pencil.
- Thankfully, managed my wild recklessness by writing a post, to you and all the other ""noobs"" of the world, conveying how you all suck for polluting the boards with dumbness that takes time out of our day as we search for REAL info. 
-Ironically, wasted WAY more time than if I would have ignored it.  ...probably also the other board viewers, too.  Shit.  It's for a good cause!! ;)
-Answered your question. (Gotta admit, I ain't all THAT mean!)"

who are these people, you are OBVIOUSLY paid by movie companies to write crap about torrents on this and other sites to stop (some)people from downloading them. 

GO FU@K yourselves, from day one the internet has always been a free for all in terms of anything that can be converted in to data, and it always will be. becasue we still have old schoolers who are passing these ideals on to the younger guys this will continue. Hats off to you people out there.

Sharing is caring and there is nothing you can do about it.

Your feedback is the ONLY RELEVANT feedback here, and is the very reason 'commenting' exists - you save the rest of us frustration and wasted time/money.  And to those who blindly support any old bullshit and leap so readily onto extremezone's dick simply because you're getting something free - and despite the fact that he puts inaccurate bullshit info in his titles - I pity you all.  Your 3rd world lust for any freeby suggests you were raised by a covern of bankrupt prostitutes.  Your mum thinks your special, we all know you're a cunt.
