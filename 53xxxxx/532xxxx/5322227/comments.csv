(1.) I installed, copied xlive.dll, 1911.dll and the gtalauncher.exe into the program directory. Everything works.
(2.) I use the only update in the file labeled with a 1.0.4 and it is missing a resource and the game needs to be reinstalled.

Is there a step three I'm missing? Do I need to do something before patching? Thanks uploader. Everything else seems in order. Oh. The readme keeps pointing out 2nd, 3rd, and 4th folders... are they a different torrent?

Thanks again!"
