'Words and Music' goes out on Radio 3 late on Sunday nights
after the 'Sunday Feature'. Its standard format is to  employ
male and female actors to read prose and poetry related to a
selected topic, and to play extracts of relevant music. The
ratio between speech and music is about 60-40.

This edition of Words and Music was devoted to Harold Pinter.

BBC Blurb
A programme devoted to the playwright and actor who died in
December 2008, featuring archive recordings of Pinter himself
reading poems by Thomas Hardy, Nazim Hikmet and his own work.

Plus new readings by Michael Gambon, including the passage from
No Man's Land which the actor read at Pinter's request at the
playwright's funeral. He also reads a passage from Proust's Time
Regained, a poem by WS Graham and an unpublished poem heard for
the first time, To My Wife, dedicated to Antonia Fraser.

Penelope Wilton's readings include a passage from Old Times and,
with Michael Gambon, she reads the passage from TS Eliot's Little
Gidding chosen by Pinter for her to read at his funeral.

Some of the late playwright's favourite music is also featured,
including Miles Davis, Bach, Thelonius Monk, Schubert (played by
his friend Mitsuko Uchida) and Beethoven, alongside music from one
of the films Pinter worked on - The French Lieutenant's Woman.
