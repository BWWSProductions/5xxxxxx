[V],twentyforty,2010-02-01T13:30Z,"@tanban: Yes, I'm working on Hello Legends since yesterday, but because I am not into Animated films I really do not know if ""The Duel"" (Part 3) should look line some special type of animation - like collage or made with water colors. If its OK, I can up ""Hello Legends"" as one file, all parts in one mp4. It would be, I guess, fairly big one, 400...450 MB.
If I get answers from you or other fans (about ep.3) I can proceed. If not - forget about it and get one from another source (beware, even ESIPSE' XviD is 1.4 GB)."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-01T13:32Z,"look line = look like
Sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-01T13:50Z,"@tanba: LOL, mystery solved. Part Three (""The Duel"") should look differently. It has been confirmed, so... expect ""Hello Legends"" after announced Lost specials and Being Human from my schedule (approx. 8-9 hours from now)."
