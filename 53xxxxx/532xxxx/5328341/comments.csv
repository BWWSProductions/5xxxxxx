,lotsofpie,2010-09-26T05:22Z,The synopsis should include the part where master chief kills everyone.
,Kevin925,2011-03-21T03:05Z,Note: This is NOT for the Harper Perennial publication.
,woktoss,2011-04-30T07:35Z,doesn't the book have 18 chapters?
,pmyy,2011-05-26T10:29Z,This is not the whole book :(
,quickyman101,2011-07-23T02:55Z,"This is in fact the full book, from start to finish, thanks Man great upload :D"
,dana894,2011-10-27T01:05Z,Its the whole book. But a lot of the details and such are left out. I listened to it along with the book so it skips a lot of lines. But its good if you dont have the book. Reading the book is a lot better because Huxley describes a lot of things to really put you in the moment.
