,Dhaiwon,2010-04-05T08:34Z,"This looks really nice, too bad the link to the software that can show it is broken :S

Here's to hoping it can be made whole, since it'd be a shame otherwise :)"
,deskbabesvghd,2010-05-28T15:05Z,"Captain,
some days ago, i saw this message in the software  (with your cracked version) with my *REAL* IP address:

""You are using an unauthorized version of this software. Your IP has been logged... blablabla .. ... Try to continue to use the pirated version and be contacted shortly by your local police department.""

trust me or no, today i received a letter from my ISP, warning me about illegal activity coming from my IP address. if i continue, they will suspend my internet access.

i do believe i have really been logged by them, i won't use your crack anymore and i advice people to do so... i guess Captain forgot a MAJOR thing in is crack, it is very unsafe :(

Mike19034:
yes, forum is blocked for me too... that's what make me think that totem is really fighting against all of us :((

,trancemix07,2010-07-22T00:08Z,"I am Back, and feeling great. I will seed forever because this is the best godamn software ive ever seen. Trancemix07 is here to save the day. Im sure a few of my inventions could help serve this to the public. Just give me a few days."
,trancemix07,2010-07-22T00:08Z,"But 1st can anyone honestly tell me that is is finally cracked. If so, i have Optimum Online speeds, and a brand new dual core technology with 3 TB 's to save the data. Oh, and by the way, if anyone wants 253  DVD's of Girls Gone Wild, i have that collection already, 253 GB's"

youre commenting too fast, but yet none uses their pirate chat

anyway, im battling a six month old bug in one of microsoft windows automatic updates, which makes your computer restart continuously. The solutions are to repair the startup, which effectively erased 132 GB's of my last 4 months work ripping websites with a lously escuse of a program, called metaproducts offline explorer, which serves only one real purpose, count as many webpage files you can untgil the $500 program crashes just so you have to start over again. Who knows what else was erased, countless hours of help documents bugs and solutions to the unquenchable thirst of a dump that is windows. Ive had it, even this backup comter is no match for evil sisters and terrorist plots. 

Fuck the whole game, lets seed 40 dvd's at under 1KB's speeds so that i can gain popularity on the internet as nothing much more than an asshole.

what a big waste of time, im been at it 4 5 years, that shows you that most people probably just bought the fucking porogram, just to get5 on with their lifes. for 16 hours now ive been fighting to recover any traces of anything salvage, that not even $3000 in hard drives, and slim line hp invent technology could save. Ive got the 64 torn apart and fuck it im tearing the processor out of it and putting it in my newest board with all the right connectors so i dont have to fuck around with cheap chinese electronics that bget frighed in 15 minutes of sun exposure out doors. There is no doubt evil surrounding me, i knew this lousy VirtuaGirl Project was going to lure me in, just to rip my soul out.

If i find out that this doesnt work, and it is a virus, or there are people out their lurking and preying on these connections, i swear to god i will put an end to all you muthafuckers for good. Shouldnt their at least be someway to protect the downloaders this day in age. Proxify and randomise every connection through a maze of dummy networks, so that hollywood, and the rest of the scumbags wont be able to destroy the only thing that keeps them in business, or maybe thats what they want, they dont want to have a job at all, because they have so much money it doesnt matter anymore

Fuck MiCrOsoft 4 Life
Now is the time to port everything to linux

fuck you and have a nice day!"
