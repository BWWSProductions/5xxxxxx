As I noted in the scene releases by HD1080 and iNFAMOUS there is something funny with the audio.  At appears most of the music comes out of the left channel.  Dialog seems ok.  I have no idea if the master bluray is this way or not.  I just thought I should mention it.  Considering neither release has been nuked, either no one else has noticed it or this is the way the master is.
