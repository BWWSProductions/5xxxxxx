Zelda Universe (http://www.zeldauniverse.net/) presents the unofficial soundtrack for The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks. Compiled from music ripped directly from the game, this is the most complete Spirit Tracks OST out there.

Contains 143 tracks compressed with LAME 3.99 in VBR Quality 0 and Joint Stereo. Also includes special album artwork, just for the soundtrack!

A lot of hard work went into getting it all together and released. This soundtrack just wouldn't be possible without...

	- Keith Alagha (aka silver-hero), who contributed all of the high-quality music rips that make up the soundtrack, and gave them all lovely fade-outs when desperately needed;
	- Jason Rappaport, who organized, tagged and named all the tracks, as well as created the album artwork for the project;
	- And of course, Nintendo and the brilliant Koji Kondo, Toru Minegishi, Asuka Ota, and Manaka Tominaga who spent their days composing and rendering the music we love.

We at Zelda Universe hope that everyone who downloads this soundtrack enjoys the music of Spirit Tracks!
