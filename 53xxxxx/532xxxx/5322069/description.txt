A bourgeois Dostoyevsky. Everything about this film is so perfect. The styling is so Seventies - wallpaper on the ceiling, wallpaper on the door - it might have been designed by a retro 1990s designer tryin to reproduce the Seventies, and the extraordinariness of the bourgeois's Hypermodern House is exactly appropriate to the theme of bourgeois superstrangeness - so a plot which seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with any kind of nietzschean ubermensch or Hitchcockian ROpe ends up reflecting on an unexpected kind of bouirgeois exceptionalism. Michel Bouquet is perfect as the blank but functional bourgeois. This is a really camp film which negotiates and rises above its own campness superbly. Quite Astonishing. I always have time for chabrol, but here he was very different, clearer and more sinister than ever.
