,LazarusL,2012-04-20T23:29Z,"Wait, I figured it out. You have to start the transfer, pause it the moment all the metadata is there, and then deselect what you don't want."
,LazarusL,2012-04-21T00:38Z,"Now that I've downloaded it I have to say this is an outstanding torrent. All the metadata are in place; I was able to simply drop all 5 cds into iTunes with virtually no typing. The mp3 used is superb: high-quality audio in extremely compact files.  And my God, the music is AMAZING. Her interplay with Vishwa Mohan Bhatt on RISE is stunning. Thank you, primusmaximus, for a perfect upload."
