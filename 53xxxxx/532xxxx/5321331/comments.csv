I will be seeing about getting Cable broadband tomorrow.   Once there is a whole copy out there this torrent will be serviced from my new Internet Virtual PC backbone server at 20mbps T1 balanced connection so it should really fly as the limit will be most peoples max download speed."
[T],towerelect,2010-02-01T15:32Z,A little PS here.  Promo Only UK have managed to mess up the Widescreen by ripping this lot as 4:3 not a problem as the pixels are still widescreen and you can expand them out again if you have the know how.  Bit of a Pain in the neck though seeing all these tall thin people grrr... I do wish the music industry would just DROP 4:3 support and move on.. HELLO it is 2010 and CRT based TV's are yesterdays news
