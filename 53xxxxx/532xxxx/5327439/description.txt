Background

The Soul Sessions was produced by Miami soul singer Betty Wright and S-Curve
Records chief executive officer Steve Greenberg. She worked with veteran Miami
soul musicians Benny Latimore, Little Beaver, Timmy Thomas, and Wright herself.
She also worked with contemporary musicians such as neo soul singer Angie
Stone and the alternative hip hop group The Roots.

Stone told MTV News that she felt intimidated by the credentials of the musicians
that worked on the album. "It was weird because they've worked with so many
great, great singers I'm talking the best. I kind of walked in, just like this little girl
and started singing." By the end of the session, she had impressed everybody with
her talent..[/b][/color]
