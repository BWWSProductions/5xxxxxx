,nicholes,2010-02-07T13:54Z,"you do not know how to seed the game?? ok to seed the game you have to do nothing!do not understand? see when your game is 100% complete downloaded it will be seeding automatically.you do not know how to seed the game?? ok to seed the game you have to do nothing!do not understand? see when your game is 100% complete downloaded it will be seeding automatically.seeding means Seeding is the process of connecting to a torrent when you have a complete file.

Yes it is important to seed 1 to 1. The more seeders there are on a torrent the faster the torrent is. You are not downloading the torrent from the actual site you get it from. You are downloading it off another user that has it on their computer.

Let?s say someone uploads a torrent to a site and that person seeds at 100kbps. At first every single leecher is trying to get the file from the uploader which if there are 10 leechers then each leecher is approximately getting the file at 10kbps.

Let?s say the 10 people finish downloading the torrent from the uploader. Each also is seeding at a speed of 100kbps.

That means the total speed of the torrent after the 10 get done downloading the file is 1100kbps. Because 10 are seeding at 100kbps and the original uploader is seeding at 100kbps. So if there are 11 more leechers getting the file now each of those leechers are approximately getting the file at 100kbps instead of 10kbps because there is a 1 to 1 ratio per seeder & leecher.

If everyone just downloaded the file from the uploader and stopped seeding without seeding the torrent 1:1 then the uploader will always be stuck seeding. Which the speed of the torrent will hardly go up because the leechers will always outnumber the seeder.

So it is important to seed back at least what you take. So if you download a file that is 1GB then seed back 1GB. That is why it is called FILE SHARING. People are considerate enough to share their stuff you can repay them back by seeding back what you take so others can enjoy it as well."
,nicholes,2010-02-07T16:48Z,"yes this game works perfacly.

about stuking torrents the file you are downloading may be fake(the file extention might be changed) or cruppted or it may have no seeder(they may be offline so wait for them)and some times you can try forced start. I had a torrent stuck on 99.7 or something for about half an hour. forced start and it finished in 20 seconds.. might be worth a try. 
and here are some tips to start downloading new torrnts!!
Check the contents of the torrent, a single rar files is often an indication for a passworded file, especially if it is accompanied by a readme.txt/.url 

A good way to find out if a .torrent is real or not is to find out who uploaded the file. There are several well known users that always release new torrents on the same account, aXXo and EZTV are some good examples of such users. If the user is anonymous, you could look at the tracker, and see if it?s widely used. There is no guarantee that files on a well known trackers are safe, but you can almost be certain that files tracked by trackers such as bittorrent.isthebe.st are fake.

Before downloading any torrent, it?s always prudent to read the comments on the site. It only takes a few seconds but it?s time well spent. Very often there are requests from previous downloaders for a password to access the file.

Most important: install a good (up-to-date) virus/spyware scanner and scan before opening"
,FiZZ52,2010-02-07T21:15Z,Nicholes there is just 1 problem.This Torrent works perfectly well in my friends slim ps2 but does not work in my fat ps2 though its modded and plays all the other games can u help

,nicholes,2010-02-09T12:33Z,"well i think you need a disk called swap magic.creat this disk and then you will be able to play it on ur fat ps2 .what this swap magic does that this cd boot ps2 and open its tray without knowing the ps2(that the tray has been opened).and then insert ur dvd game which deos not boot in ps2 and show an error,that should run the game.about how to make a swap magic disk search yout_ube or afterd_awn they would help you a lot(i can tell you each and every thing here).good luck!"
,FiZZ52,2010-02-09T13:46Z,"I know bout that swap magic disc in which u have to open the ps2 and replace cd with the ps2 disc and so on...

But my ps2 is modded that is its chipped with a mod chip which alows ntsc as well as pal games to work fine on it also downloaded games or home made i.e burnt disc work fine i have downloaded a lot of games and burnt and played each 1 works fine,xcept this 1 which has got a strange method of playin in the slim 1 rather than the fat 1 i guess ,just dont know what is the problem may be it dosent like my Fat old skool PS2

Ne wayz thanx man and i guess u meant (I CANT  tell you each and every thing here)
its totally fine cause typing each and every step is a headache but dont worry i have done my masters in PS2 heheh LOL....
