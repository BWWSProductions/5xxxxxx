,Coldblackice,2012-06-19T09:27Z,"Ahh I just figure out what the problem is, why the Extras appear interlaced and why media players won't deinterlace them --

Grandy88 encoded them as Progressive, when they're actually Interlaced. Although the main episodes are progressive, these extras should have been encoded as interlaced. I wish there was a way to change a ""flag"" in the clip to change it from Progressive to Interlaced, so that media players correctly deinterlace the clips (to get rid of those jaggy lines on motion), but unfortunately, the only way to do this is to re-rip and encode the video from the blurays :( 

Grandy88 (or anyone) -- do you happen to still have the blurays, that perhaps you could re-rip the extras content as Interlaced?"
