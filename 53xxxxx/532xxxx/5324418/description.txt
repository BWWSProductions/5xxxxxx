From the Back Cover
Join Bella, Milo, Fizz and Jake as they all have lots of fab-a-roony colour fun...

Bella, Milo, Fizz and Jake sing one of their favourite tunes--"She'll be coming round the mountain". Fizz sees a beautiful rainbow but when it disappears they all decide to make their own rainbow. Jake is ato the rescue! All the Tweenies have painted their own animal picture. Fizz is shocked when Milo claims pink is yukeroony, but when it turns out he does like some pink things after all, Milo is the one to be in the pink! Max, Bella and Jake sing the Red Banana song. Bella, Milo, Fizz and Jake use just three colours of paint to make lots of brand new colours and mix together green, orange and purple paints. Max and the Tweenies play a coloured dice game.

DVD Description: the Tweenies ask "What is the Colour Of Doodle's Nose?" They learn about camouflage and Max reads the story of Elmer, a very colourful elephant
