This is going to be a long time before you all see another seeder cause i block my uploud to these leechers as well, and now instead  of uplouding with full speed i do with only 20kb to one peer."
,nukeZ3r0,2010-02-02T17:55Z,"This isn't true BluRay formatted rips.  True rips are ~2.19GB an episode.  I have Seasons 1-3 in this format and it's a little over 75GB, so these seem to just be HDTV rips...not bad by any means, just not the quality of my 2.19GB rips."
,penandpike,2010-02-02T21:45Z,"Yes these are bluray rips.
And you can always download an episode to check the quality .
there is no such thing as true bluray rips.
you can rip at any size you want."
,oxycodone,2010-02-08T02:19Z,yea nuke size has nothing to do with the source. you could rip a bluray into a 400 meg file if u wanted.

,DSDO,2010-05-28T18:54Z,"Hi, nice torrent !

However I've been at it for a about a month and a half now and it still isn't completed yet... Ok I have a crappy connection, but this torrent is incredibly slow compared to some others !

Any chance that you people could seed a bit more ?
Thanks !"
