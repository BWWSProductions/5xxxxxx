MP4 of Feb.1/2010 Art Bell hosting Coast to Coast.

Joining Art Bell for the entire 4-hour program, physicist Dr. David Anderson discussed the state of time technology from his research, as well as other labs around the world. He recapped his work from 2002, when his team had created small time warp fields that he said could accelerate time by 300%.
