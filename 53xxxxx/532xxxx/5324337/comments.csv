,jimitridos,2010-02-08T19:54Z,"episode two content.gcf - source file is CORRUPTED

portal prelude - adrian_charkman_in_the_beginning.mp3- source file is CORRUPTED

HELP"
,SubGum,2010-02-22T02:51Z,"First off, this is an awesome torrent!
There's no easier torrent out there for getting these programs running.

It does indeed however suffer from ""corrupted"" error messages during install.  I installed the ""Single Player"" pack, and was given the same errors that jimitridos mentioned above.

As a result, ep2 WILL NOT work.  After the ""Valve"" intro screen, it crashes with the message ""Engine Error - Could not load library client""

Everything else works well though, and I'm going to look for a workaround to get ep2 working."
,SubGum,2010-02-22T10:58Z,"I got ep2 working.  All I had to do was download the HL2:ep2 part of this orange box torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4015192/Half-Life_2_The_Orange_Box_[DVD]
And extract the ""episode two content.gcf"" in it to the ""StreamApps"" folder in the install dir of this Ultimate Edition.

As for the ""adrian_charkman_in_the_beginning.mp3"" I'm sure I'll run into some part of Portal Predlude where the music will be mission, but that's bearable."

There may problem with UAC under Windows systems Vista and 7 occur. Solution is plain enough. Since RevEmu cannot take up admin rights for startup ""Start HL2.cmd, Start HL2 Episode One.cmd etc"" is to be for the first time start every *.cmd with help e.g. Total Commander launched as administrator. See picture below.

,elessarGObonzo,2010-11-29T03:43Z,why don't you redo this pack with uncorrupted files?
