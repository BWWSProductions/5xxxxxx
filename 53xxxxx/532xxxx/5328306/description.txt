Money talk for Monday on the Mike Malloy Show. Obama releases his Big Budget today and weâ€™ll get to see exactly what is frozen and what is not. Then heâ€™ll participate in a new journalistic social-media session by answering policy questions submitted byparticipants. Whether or not heâ€™ll also give a little nod to Apple by using an I-pad during the session remains to be seen. Rumor is that Coke is offering top dollar if he swigs from a can of Sprite at least once during the video stream. Too bad the camera angle isnâ€™t suited for a full-body shot, Nike wouldâ€™ve LOVED that opportunity!

Hey, itâ€™s all-corporate all the time now, right? Wait until mid-term time, when politicians start showing up for debates dressed like NASCAR drivers. At least the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United will allow the hypocrisy to be displayed out in the open from now on, drop all the ridiculous pretense that our elected officials are impartial representatives of our wants and needs.
