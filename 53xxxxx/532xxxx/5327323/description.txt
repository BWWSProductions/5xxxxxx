Dear All,

This is the Multi Windows 7 x86 version in Dutch (WIN7MULTIx86_NL).I have created this version from te original NL-Professionalfor windows 7(no doubt).
This manupilated version (WIN7MULTIx86_NL) includes:
â—¦Starter x86
â—¦HomeBasic x86
â—¦HomePremium x86
â—¦Professional x86
â—¦Ultimate x86

The activation folder is also included in the .iso file (Thanks to Orbit30, Hazar & Daz).

Installation instructions:
1.Burn the file with imgburn, nero (or a burn program of your choice) on a DVD.
2.Install the version of your choice on your Desktop PC or NOtebook. After the installation it will ask for a key, just ignore it.
3.When the installation is done browse your DVD for the Activation folder(there are two activators in it) and follow the instructions carefully in the "LeesMij" notepad. Some peoples need all two activators & some peoples need only one activator.

And After that enjoy.......and dance around the room.

Please seed after download. A share ratio of one for every downloader would be very nice and kind.
If there are questions i will here it from you.(je mag ook in het nederlands vragen stellen)

Greetings & Succes.
