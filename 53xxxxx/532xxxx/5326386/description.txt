About the Video:

And if you take a precious stone and you cut a very thin slice and shine 
pure light through it, one of two things will happen. It will lose all of 
its colour and look like a piece of coal or, it will change from its present 
colour, red, blue or green, into all the colours of the rainbow and the most 
fabulous patterns you have every seen. The scientific term for those that 
lose everything is 'isotropic' and the scientific that gave ALL the colours 
and wonderful patterns is 'anisotropic'.

There are 12 stones which will be used as the material for the New Jerusalem and 
everyone of them is anistropic. Now some of you ladies are going to be 
disappointed here - diamonds are isotropic. 
Don't take them with you to glory - they have no colour, no brilliance. 
Rubies - my wife will have to leave her ruby brooch behind because it has no colour 
in pure light. Garnets - no colour, but look at these...		

Great Video Only 6minutes!
