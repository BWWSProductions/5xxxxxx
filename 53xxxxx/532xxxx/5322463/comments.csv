(N)"
,Tamaria13,2011-01-16T14:31Z,"i don't see why you needed so many rars. open the first rar in both folders and the episodes are in seperate avi files. note i'm using VLC media player, and it showed up fine. "
,DaveTehSlave,2011-04-07T10:31Z,"To all of you saying this is fake, it isn't. I'll be nice seeing as we were all noobs at one point. The movie is in 2 parts (CD1 and CD2), and split into several zips for faster download speeds. After you are done downloading just group extract all rar files (.rar through .r47) using winrar or 7zip. Easy :)"
