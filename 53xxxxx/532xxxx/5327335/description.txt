ok we got problem, but not unpleasant one. the times are coming when mr suzuki's "branded to kill" tine will come. there 2 options

1. the criterion SL issue - is from the begining of the collection and rather disguting
2. a PAL DL issue, with eng, fre and ger subs, really much superior to the criterion

as I know there are many cc fanatics and I don't want to get shot in the back I'm asking you: which do you prefer?


OBS: Don't say both, that doesn't work
