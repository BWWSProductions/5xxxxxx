*******************

To disable downloading product updates: Start Avira-> Configuration-> General-> Update
(also for disabling ""Notify if product updates are available"").

However, so far the Avira9_Trial_Reset_v2.2A works for all the latest program updates as well."

Your da man!! works perfectly on Avira Premium AV

Thanks dude."
,fu_manchu,2010-02-03T19:00Z,you finally realised your previous crappy release of avira went south... Dont download this and risk messing up your computer from a dumb douche robinhood. Ive learnt my lesson I gave you 2 chances and you fucked both of those up.. FUck all your stupid releases. They end up not working... Worthless use of bandwidth
