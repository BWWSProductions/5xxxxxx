,Dark_Wrath,2010-01-31T10:39Z,"Sup HolyRoses? Ok, I got ffmpeg working perfect using Winff. One question. You convert your movies into m4v right? But I'm quite sure that m4v doesn't play on the PSP. Does it? And if you convert to mp4, what options would you use? Thanks. :)"
,tjack360,2010-02-03T08:35Z,Dark_Wrath - M4Vs do play on the PSP provided they are encoded to the PSP specifications. MP4 and M4V are the same thing. The extension is just different. iTunes recognizes mp4 files as audio and m4v as video. Hope this helps.
