shows that I watch but don't tell anybody.

Just finished watching El Trespatio.It was 
a very powerful movie but very sad.Those
statistics at the end make me wonder what 
is going on in that gov't and police force.In 
the last few years there have been people 
from my country murdered there.Still unsolved!"
