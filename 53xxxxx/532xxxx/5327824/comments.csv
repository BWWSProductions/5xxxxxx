,BoobyFace,2010-02-07T02:23Z,"I think I know what this doofus's malfunction is:
Because there was this huge gap between the airing of episode 7 and episode 8, this [eztv]-ninny has got it into his cpu that anything after ep. 7 is season 2.
Sorry [eztv], but that just aint the case.
Season 1 runs from ep.1 right through to ep. 13.
Perhaps you might like to update your list? "
,PegasusAR,2010-12-26T13:50Z,IMdB Pro must have it wrong as well as far as the doofuses that wrote that there have only been 2 seasons of this show because IMdB Pro lists 7 episodes for seasons 1 and 3 and 6 episodes for seasons 2 and 4.
