For anyone unfamiliar with Alfred Deller (1912â€“1979), his voice is extremely distinctive and a bit like Marmite: either you love it or you hate it!  He was key to the revival of the solo countertenor voice, and (once one gets used to his tone) he is, to my ear at least, far more suited than modern countertenors when singing from this early repertoire, being extremely expressive and effortless in addition to being simply polished.  You can read  more about him here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Deller

The tracks on this CD are not exclusively Elizabethan.  In fact, far from it, though many of the tunes and texts have roots from then and earlier.  Most of these are listed in Child's Ballads (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_ballad) and are melodies and/or texts from a wide array of published sources including Ravenscroft, Playford, broadsides and Shakespeare songs.

If you are interested in music of this genre and period, this CD is an absolute must-have.  The sound quality is astonishingly good, especially considering that this is a (remastered) 1956 recording.  Beautiful stuff. 

There are some sixty other albums of Deller on the Vanguard label! Do dip in and support the label if you can :)
