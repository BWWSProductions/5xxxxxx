,bulby,2010-02-07T15:56Z,Thank you very much!
,PiperMp3,2010-02-07T21:20Z,"Thanks for the torrent, but im not sure how to install it :/ Its just many files. Not sure how to continue the Update and Adding of the Locomotives... Any help?"
,Railgamelover,2010-02-07T22:42Z,"@PiperMp3: For the *.rar, *.zip and *.7z files: Extract the ""Assets"" and ""Content"" folders with WinRAR to your RailWorks folder (like C:\Program Files\RailWorks\), in the ""Manual"" or ""JustTrains"" folders you find the driving manual.
If there is a *.rwp file in the package, open Railworks, go to tab ""Package Manager"" and click ""Install"" and select the *.rwp file.
For the update: Copy the content of ""Railworks_V93.8c_to_V97.6_Update.rar"" to your ""Railworks"" folder.
If you have any further questions, ask it ;-)"

When I install the updates the language changes to some chinese looking language. How to solve this problem?"
,Railgamelover,2010-02-21T22:38Z,"So as I said in the description of the torrent:
Save Railworks.exe Gamemanager.dll and Languages Folder.

Then, in the middle left screen, click the littel blue icon with the orange arrow.
On the right screen, you select all developers.
Maby the route is then in the list."

Also having trouble getting Isle of Wight to work"
,tatterss,2010-11-11T07:40Z,"Okay, trying to install this addon pack for my hubby and about to give up. 

Using Railworks2, Akira said that these will work with it. Where on earth am I meant to paste these files? 

Please, by all means, feel free to treat me as a complete ignorant, I did manage to get this addon to work in the original railworks but that was quite some time ago, and what little I remember doesn't seem to help with Railworks2. Please tell me the directory to use because I am tearing my hair out here.

Thank you very much in advance."
