  No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle continues the tale of punk anti-hero     
  Travis Touchdown, the Japanese anime Otaku, and pro wrestling-obsessed        
  assassin. Travis finds himself at the bottom of the UAA (United Assassins     
  Association) rankings and must wage war to become the No. 1 assassin once     
  again. The follow-up to the popular No More Heroes will offer fans infectious,
  fun gameplay that allows you to wield not just one, but two swords and face   
  multiple bosses simultaneously in bigger-than-ever boss battles.
