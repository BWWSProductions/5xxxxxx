Paul Robertson in discussion with Anthony Holden,
[who had just published a biography of Da Ponte,
'The Man Who Wrote Mozart'] about Lorenzo Da Ponte.

Lorenzo Da Ponte (1749-1838) was born a jew, and became
a Catholic priest. He took a married woman as his mistress.
Together they opened a brothel next door to his church.
Da Ponte provided the brothel's musical entertainment,
playing his violin for the customers while dressed in
his priest's robes.

Finally banished from Venice he moved to Vienna and was
appointed 'Poet to the Theatres'. He collaborated with
Salieri and Mozart. He wrote the librettos of: 'CosÃ¬
fan tutte', 'Le nozze di Figaro', and 'Don Giovanni'.
