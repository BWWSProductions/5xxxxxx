Hi, there. fist time i upload any torrent, so im sorry if i've gotten anything, wrong 

what i've done here is follow Tonitonichopchop's guide on gbatemp 
http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=206141

and replaced the background music on the stages as per the first post after the above link. so yatterman's workshop how has yatterman no.1's music from "cross generation of heroes" and so on. 

also i made it so that everytime the game starts the video that plays is the original opening video from CGOH (also as per detailed in the guide after the above link)

for anymore info follow the link above, it's a great little thread i stumbled on 

kudos go to tonitonichopchop and the rest of those guys at GBAtemp.

I did none of this work, i merely followed a tutorial. i'll do my best to seed for a couple days or longer depending popularity, but my upstream can be very changable, so before long i'll have to give it a rest. 
 sorry for waffling btw.
