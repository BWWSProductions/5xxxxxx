,IndIka420,2010-02-10T12:29Z,1 - 2 - 8 were awesome. The rest were kinda lame. I didnt like their take on Halo.. the samurai shit.. the DBZ rip off.. but 1 -2 - and especially 8 were awesome. 
,chuckasarus,2010-02-16T13:31Z,Please SEED!
,marine_6,2010-02-20T05:50Z,lol.....Dr Halsey looked so young in the 8th episode! ...then more scarier lol...
,Jake415,2010-03-10T22:46Z,"Hi
I downloaded this and all the files were MKV files...how do i watch them? :/"
,Screamokid,2010-12-20T12:41Z,"tatasGR - Graphics? It's not a video game, it doesn't have a graphics engine built into it, anyway, I hope they are good, the comments don't look promising but it's worth a look.

I was really hoping for something a little closer to the game than a DBZ rip off and oiled paint, I like the cartoons I saw in some Halo 3 cutscenes, they were beauty at it's finest."
