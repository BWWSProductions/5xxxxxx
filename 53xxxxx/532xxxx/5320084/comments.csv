@zoohang: All shows suffer because of breaks, it sometimes means a death for show. I hope Smallville fans can pick up - and keep up.
Thanks."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-30T12:39Z,"@danny: I am huge fan of Lost, but whole season is beyond my upload capabilities.  This is best I can do on my two year old PC and semi-decent connection."
,dannyw1981,2010-01-30T13:09Z,"ok m8, cheers anyway, carry on the good work"
,lilars26,2010-01-30T14:53Z,"Thanks for putting this show
into your schedule.When is 
he going to learn to fly?"
,danbye79,2010-01-30T15:42Z,"V and stargate universe dont come back on TV untill March/April 2010.

2040: will you be uploading doctor who season 5 episodes when it comes on TV ??"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-30T17:31Z,"Thanks guys.

@danbye79: Like salt on bleeding wound, danbye. Dr. Who - WITHOUT any doubt always was a real nightmare. I do not understand how VTV and MM get such huge numbers on English doctor for big files and I got bunch of hard-fisting kids which have problems with concept of sharing. Seeding completely aside,ALL specials I have upped dragged for whole day without reason other then aforementioned. Sorry, but - never ever Dr. Who, even if I watch and keep all Special episodes.

BTW, last special was the first one filmed for HDTV with HighDef equipment and it is such shame that fan-base are just kids."
,danbye79,2010-01-30T18:30Z,"thanks for your response , doctor who fans are not just kids , such as myself I am 30 and my dad is 54, myself and my dad love the show and never miss a episode,doctor who is the only thing that me and my dad have in common."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-30T20:46Z,"@danbye79: LOL, neither I... but it wasn't a word, just a commone, plain word, but more sarcastic and more complex:
I have found what I wrote back then, and you can (or cannot) see who are the kids from my previous comment:
QUOTING MYSELF:
--------------------------------------------------------
""Yes, you're absolutely right. I deleted torrent even if I have announced in Schedule as ""Regular"".
 I see who the audience of this specific torrent is:
Immatures, probably first graders of elementary school, playing hard-fisting, but this time not with some colorful rocks but with candy which melted in their hand because they squeezed too hard.

Less ""poetic"": I have seeded in FIXED size swarm of sixteen people 2.2 file-sizes within 2 hours. 2.2 files at 16 peers, and when I looked in - TOP one has 56.3% next one 53.8%, next 52.9% next 46.3 and so on and so on....

I had 6 come-and-goers and I have left the swarm alone - waiting to see some EQUALIZING. Nope. An hour, two hours - nothing. Absolutely nothing. Few lousy bytes were exchanged between peers but nothing changed the fact that - 16 people HAVE 2.2 FILES, BUT DECIDED NOT TO SHARE, but to hold for/by themselves pieces they have. ""Oh, my precious."" - said Gollum.
They have chosen rather to die of hunger, than to share.""
------------------
So, my dear danby - these ""kids"" I have in mind. Age doesn't make a difference."
