The year is 1614. Japan is finally a unified country under the first shogun, Tokugawa. Gennosuke of Kohga and Oboro of Iga, are the last hope of two isolated ninja villages wracked by endless tragedy and a cycle of revenge. The blessing of their love should have brought peace to the suffering people. However, the conspiracy brought by Tokugawa once again tears the two villages apart. Gennosuke constantly speaks in favor of peace, while Oboro takes the choice to fight to resolve the conflict. With each Ninja having super human powers, the battle is set to fight off each other for their own existence. Now destined to meet as enemies, will Gennosuke and Oboro find a way to pursuit their star-crossed love?
