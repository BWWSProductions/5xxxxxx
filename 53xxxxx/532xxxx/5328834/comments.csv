,zimsmoke,2010-02-13T16:29Z,"Why the fuck would we go watch a steaming movie from your shitty spam site.

When we are right here on a downloader site.  Still transfer as much data as stream watching would.  And get to keep the file if we want.   

With no shitty spam ads while we watch.

darkmovies sucks ass.  and i'm pretty sure they're stupid as well."
,lilzac26,2010-02-14T02:00Z,wtf the whole movie is green? i downloaded it twice...
,frostyvision,2010-02-15T17:44Z,"V: 9/10
A: 6/10

Audio lags behind, and no my codecs/players/computer is not fucked up. The audio is about .5 seconds behind the video."
,MayZinG,2010-02-15T17:49Z,Thank you from Sweden ! =)
,RitchieRich,2010-02-16T02:34Z,"Thank you for all your quality ups FXG!!! Your work is greatly appreciated! 

To all the damn spammers, why can't you guys stop flooding this site with your bullshit malware filled sites??!! THE COMMENT FIELD IS FOR COMMENTS ABOUT THE TORRENT NOT YOUR SITES!!

I wish I had the ability to remove their accounts. Oh well, wishful thinking. "
,FreddyGeorgeOo,2010-02-17T02:58Z,"XD forgot to shut off my computer, I came back, I had uploaded 78.6 gigs xD"
,FreddyGeorgeOo,2010-02-17T02:59Z,"Also to those who complain about random issues such as audio lag or video color being green, It was perfect for me, great quality, no audio lag whatsoever, so even though you deny that your codecs could be bugged... CHECK YOUR CODECS *maniacal laughter*"
,Kooblukhan,2010-02-17T11:21Z,"If your video and audio arent in sync, dont be a tool, use vlc, and fix it in the options.  there are even keyboard shortcuts for it for christ's sake.."

,somedude.1001,2010-03-05T17:48Z,"Movie has a great premiere but shittyass ending. Would be much better if it was darker.

The main character had potential to become an anti-hero like Dexter or the Punisher but whoever made the last call fucked it up with a pussifed ending and the main villain fucking won. Fucking morons."

,5ynic,2010-04-18T12:04Z,"@ishywozere
hi mate - the best media player is probably VLC (download from videolan.org if you're not already using it). Assuming you're using VLC, then from the ""Media"" menu at the top, select ""Advanced Open File"" and then it gives you the choice of both media file and subtitles file.
HTH,

,CBR_600rr,2010-10-08T06:26Z,"Excellent download, it was quick and easy. I'm having a problem where the video stops at a certain point and doesn't continue playing without moving the slider. What causes this? "
