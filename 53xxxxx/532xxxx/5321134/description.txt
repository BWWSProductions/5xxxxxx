I have not always fully responded to Vladimir Horowitzâ€™s playing and have sometimes been repelled â€“ too much the showman, the crowd-pleaser â€“ but this recital, the pianistâ€™s â€œlast performance in publicâ€ (at the age of 83, or 82, birth-dates of either 1903 or 1904 can be found, and he died in 1989) proves to be not only a fine memento but includes some fine performances.
