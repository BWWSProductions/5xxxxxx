,Alescio,2010-02-07T15:53Z,"Automatically installed versions 32 and 64 bits. The crack ran STANDARD VERSION FOR 32 BIT, but did not work in 64-bit version.

For 64-bit message the following message:

""This program cannot update the installed version of Adobe Photoshop CS4 because of the following reason:

C:\PROGRAM FILES\ADOBE PHOTOSHOP CS4 (64BIT)amtlib.dll:unknown version."""

,Vetteaus,2011-11-30T05:53Z,"Installed the program and followed the instructions properly. I'm having trouble with the activator though...When I run it, it gives me ""Extracting File failed. It is most like caused by low memory (low disk space for swapping file) or corrupted Cabinet File.""  Any one know what to do? Thanks for the download!!"

,ChynnaGirl,2012-05-30T06:55Z,"Avast is showing the activator.exe file as

Threat: Win32:Zbot-MPQ [Trj[

If you ran that file, your system may be infected. You should run some checks to see. Apparently a nasty one that can steal your banking information and passwords (Identity Theft)."
