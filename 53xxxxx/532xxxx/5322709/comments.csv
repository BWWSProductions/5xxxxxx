,3xp3ri3nc3,2010-02-03T15:19Z,Playing this video file from a DVD disc on a Xbox 360 won't work?
,champion23,2010-02-04T19:12Z,"hi, PLEASE RESPOND, there are alot of websites that have PS3TEAM torrents, should i just download them? or could some be fakes and messed with by other users who probably messed with the quality then reuploaded them?"
,champion23,2010-02-04T19:14Z,"ALSO,which website did PS3TEAM originally uploaded torrents? demonoid..com ? should i be worried to where i download your(PS3TEAM) torrents?"
,dmon0069,2010-02-05T16:11Z,"Hey, I don't comment much, actually, only one other time, but apparently my account doesn't work anymore or something.  Anyways, I was just wondering, do you use Ripbot to encode and would it be a best to build a separate pc (looking into a quad core) for encoding?  I wouldn't mind doing some encodes and uploads of my own sometime.  I tried doing a 1080p w/ handbrake, but it seems my e8400 can't handle it.  Any advice would be awesome, thanks!  (Thanks for the UPs as well!)"
,myname134,2010-02-07T00:10Z,"I started downloading this and at 21% i opened it to try it out and it was a different movie: ""steal this film"", it had pretty much the whole movie to, should i keep downloading, start over, or what?"
,dmon0069,2010-02-07T01:39Z,"hey my name, if your using vlc player, sometimes on my pc if a download doesn't finish all the way, it glitches or something and opens up a file I've already got downloaded.  But, this one should be correct, as I tried previewing it before 100% and it gives me law abiding citizen at 1080 res"
,lordshadows,2010-02-09T08:14Z,No way this is a true 1080P as the minimun size for 1080P blue ray is 25 gig...thats minimum...most are as much as 50 gig.
,Astrograsss,2010-02-09T15:15Z,"Hi, im using a ps3 through hdmi set to a 720p TV, will the resolution effect the picture if not set to 1080p? just thought best to ask before i download a 4gb file, regards..."
,McGudge,2010-02-09T16:23Z,"(Gay) Lordshadows

Download it and check it out before you Diss it!

I'm sure ull be pleasantly surprised with how good the quality is"
,lordshadows,2010-02-09T18:02Z,"McGudge retard...read what i said carefully!!

Never said it was not good quality i said it was not a true 1080P"
,McGudge,2010-02-10T00:58Z,"Lordshadow retard!

Yes it is ""true"" 1080p, read the info - resolution 1920x1080.......Dumbass

1080p is a definition for resolution, read your own comment carefully if you wanna be specific dickhead."
,lordshadows,2010-02-10T06:40Z,"McGudge...wrong again buttwipe as it is what your HDTV detects it as or your blu ray player detects it as..The format it was uploaded as is a AVCHD Video (.m2ts) which is an HD cam corder
resolution...burn it to a DVD and trying playing it back in a Blu ray player and see what you get..an upconversion since it is not blu ray!"
,McGudge,2010-02-10T11:12Z,"gaylord.. what the hell are you talking about?

.m2ts is a file format - not a ""HD Cam Corder resolution"". completely different thing altogther!

No one is claiming it is Bluray. why the hell would i burn it to dvd to play in my bluray player. take the hint in the torrent name ""...PS3-TEAM"", its primarily for watching on the PS3 and kept to 4GB or less so it can bee easily transferred since PS3 will only recgonise FAT32.Blu-ray is in the name because that is the source.

and for the record, .m2ts file extension is what gets used for bluray video files asswipe. If you were to take an image of a bluray disk you would find many .m2ts files!

As for ""True 1080p"", i have no idea what you think this means, do you think its another way of saying bluray.

Try this, burn this file onto a bluray disc and play in your bluray player, then compare to the official disc. you will be hard pushed to see a difference.

Lesson over"

,Byjum,2010-02-22T17:24Z,"I can't figure out how to play this on my PS3, can anyone help?"
,Mayenard,2010-02-22T17:43Z,"Thanks for the download!  This is my first m2ts download and and the quality couldn't be much better if it could when it comes to rips. Well done.
@SuperBad
Move to another country or get NetFlix.  I believe these are your only options."
,JohnFolds,2010-02-26T15:36Z,"Great quality, keep that way, Im sending invites for lockerz,just send me mail and Ill send you an invite(karlobarisic@yahoo.com) "
,dcoleman,2010-03-01T21:03Z,"Great Download and Great movie. 
A:9
V:9

Personal on the PS3 Team do qual. work.....
Thanks for this one."
,dcoleman,2010-03-01T21:06Z,"How to play on your PS3
Load to External HD
Go to Video and hit Triangle
Hit Display all
Find File and hit X
Your good to go.

Also if your TV does 1080p set it to 1080p not 720p
If you do have your PS3 to 720p it is ok but you are not going to see the full potental of this movie. 
Enjoy....."
,dcoleman,2010-03-01T21:08Z,"Bricktop can you or someone on the PS3 team do Boondock Saints 2?
Thanks!"
