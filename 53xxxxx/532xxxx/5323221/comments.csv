http://forums.amd.com/game/messageview.cfm?catid=227&threadid=96638

To make the blackgrey screen dissapear and when u get attacked u wont see sh*T!

These are the settings you need change in the ""global"" setting file to make it all work fine! My Documents\Empire interactive\SST\Settings open up global.settings and these settings below:

PostProcessing: { ""0"" }
Distort: { ""0"" }
DisableSM2: { ""0"" }

Shader Quality (in the game options menu, at most) : MEDIUM
everything else in the ""graphigs menu"" can be set to any thing u want as long u change these things in the ""global"" file! =)

Check out other posts in this forum but this one solved all of my problems
Thanks a lot to noob007 for this post!"

""Hey how do you change the language from Russian to English??""


You change the language during setup, it won't change the setup language tho.. For some reason? But anyhow, if you change it there, I think it is during the second or third window? Not sure, but yeah if you change it to English, you're all good to go!"
,PhilioUK,2011-01-16T00:31Z,"Thanks BlackDestiny,

Went through setup too quickly didnt notice it had the option.

,Ears14U,2011-05-30T19:55Z,"ENGLISH READERS? ok...Here's how to convert to English..
On the install with Daemon. When autorun runs the install, the first screen you will see is the one with the STARSHIP TROOPERS in the upper left hand corner of the screen. Click the 1st box on the left..next click the 2nd box from the left..The 3rd screen is where you click the middle box to drop down to ENGLISH. Then install like usual. I hope that helps other people, because that was one pain in the ass! "
