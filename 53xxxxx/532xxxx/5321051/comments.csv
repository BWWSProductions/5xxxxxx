I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

we had 1000 points of light
for the homeless man
well, but maybe we're here tell bout health care plan

we got to stop the war
bring home our vets
legalize marijuana
and pay off our debt

we got a brand new man
he's keeping hope alive
and we even got electric cars to drive
