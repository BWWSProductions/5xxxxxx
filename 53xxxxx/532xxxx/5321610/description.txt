IMDb:         http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407362/

Release date: 14 january 2005 (USA)

Genre:        Action, Adventure, Drama, SciFi

Plot:         The second war against the Cylons is over and The Twelve Colonies 
              have been destroyed. Now Commander Adama of the Battlestar 
              Galatica and President Laura Roslin lead a ragtag fleet of 
              refugees in a supposed search for the fabled lost thirteenth 
              colony, Earth. However, the dangers they face are many which
              compound an already difficult situation. In addition to the Cylons
              hunting and attacking the fleet in space, their infiltrator units 
              carry out a more subtle plot even as their former unwitting pawn, 
              Gaius Baltar, helps in the hunt for them while hiding both his own
              guilt and the strange presence that haunts his every thought. If 
              that wasn't enough, the fleet also faces internal political 
              conflict in which the rabble-rousing figure, Tom Zarek, is merely 
              the loudest dissenting voice. In the midst of these trials however, 
              clues begin to appear that suggest that Adama's simple bluff about
              Earth may be more truthful than anyone could have guessed.
