,Krenzathal,2010-10-12T21:14Z,"Can the original uploader of this torrent please come on and seed.

It's a bit pointless to take the time to rip, organise, upload and write the description of this page if no-one has a chance of getting the full download."
,AnastasiaA,2010-11-30T09:26Z,"I'm doing my best to seed, but its really difficult to get anything out of zero.
I doubt anyone's gotten a full download of this, but, are these files legitimate? I don't want crazy fake virus files..."
