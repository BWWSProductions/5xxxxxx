,larry_braverman,2010-02-12T17:12Z,None of the files marked as .cbz work.
[T],Juan.Too,2010-02-19T12:41Z,Yes they do.
,YuiSnape,2010-07-26T01:52Z,"The .cbz files have internal filenames containing a backslash, not all readers will deal with them properly. (In my case, Comix under Linux.)

Don't sweat it, all the files are intact, just unzip 'em or use an alternative reader."
