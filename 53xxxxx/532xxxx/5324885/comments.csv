,enjoypolo,2010-02-09T14:51Z,Thanks a LOT ! I've been using this for quite a time now and was considering buying it. It'll be for later though ... thanks !
,segmentation-fault,2010-02-26T16:55Z,"I'm using Mac OS-X Snow Leopard 10.6.2, and had previously installed an original copy of Traktor LE 1.2.4 + Service Center + Controller Editor + Audio 4 DJ Driver + Traktor Kontrol X1 Driver.

I've uninstalled Traktor LE through NI Uninstall Utility 1.0.4.

But when I try to install the Traktor Pro 1.2.4 from this torrent, the installer fails every time. I don't understand why. I've tried everything.

Traktor Pro 1.2.1 released by UNION works fine, though.

But I really need 1.2.4, because 1.2.1 doesn't support properly the new controller Traktor Kontrol X1.

Any help? Thank you."
,sm00sh,2010-03-07T03:15Z,"The installer also fails for me. 

osx, 10.5.6 "
,cYberGlobe,2010-03-08T15:19Z,"Ive downloaded the demo version 1.2.4 from NI site and i was trying to crack it with this torrent...but i dont understand how make it work.
if i copy the cracked app. after demo installation it doesnt work at all...the application doesnt start.

which files ive to copy?"
,Shabaam,2010-03-19T15:23Z,"Installation Failure FIX:

turns out it has nothing to do with snow leopard. it was just too simple to think of:

COPY THE INSTALLATION FILE (Traktor Installer Mac.mpkg) to an external harddrive, THEN RUN IT.

spread the word."
,kn3h,2010-04-11T23:06Z,"For anyone with experiencing the 'won't start up' behavior of the K-ed app: Files in the .app might not have executable-bit set. 

You can fix it in an OSX-terminal:
1. Start Terminal
2. cd to the application folder:

cd ""/Applications/Native Instruments/Traktor/Traktor.app/Contents/"" 

3. Set the exec-bit:

chmod 755 MacOS/Traktor
chmod 755 Resources/Traktor.rsrc
chmod 755 Resources/TraktorStudio.nrc

4. Done

,GHOSTBALLS,2010-04-20T15:56Z,"THANK YOU KN3H!

,jdhope,2010-05-10T06:33Z,"everything works fine, but for some reason everytime i try to do this it installs traktor LE instead of pro, i assumed this was happening because i had traktor LE on my mac already, so i deleted everything that had anything to do with traktor from my mac and my problem is still continuing, anyone know why?"
,globez,2010-06-06T14:54Z,I have that problem... Doesn't change from LE to Pro. Does anyone know which file i need to delete?

,davish123,2010-11-25T23:49Z,"PS Works fine. No install problems for me (10.6). Just ran it up, installed, restarted. Fired it up--had to import my old Traktor settings tho, so make sure you export before you upgrade. Thanks for this. Needed it."
