this is very simple first you will want to run it through utorrent then once done fine the file (look around c drive,desktop,documents,or games) and download 7-zip you will extract the file with it then all you got to do is install the game and boom your playing

notes:
.the game may have a error every time you press new game
.might crash at gnr door
.could crash loading 
.could crash almost anywere at any time so remember to keep saving every time you do somthing



NO DISC AS LONG AS YOU USE 7-ZIP TO EXTRACT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
