,lilars26,2010-02-02T17:42Z,"Hey 20/40.I don't know what happened but
I am finally getting decent upload
speeds.If it stays like that I may be able
to help with initial seedings"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-02T18:18Z,"I was not able to watch it (later today), but director and cast is great and imdb rating is one of the highest.

Lilars, that is great, badly needed (especially on this one /illiterate people I guess/)."
,lilars26,2010-02-02T22:44Z,"485 connected,48 seeds.That's about 1/10.Not good.I don't know if I helped but I tried to keep my ratio >1 during seeding.I figured if it was "
,lilars26,2010-02-02T23:33Z,...less than 1 then I wasn't helping
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-03T10:11Z,"@lilars: Do not worry about unconnected peers. You use PeerBlock (replacement for PeerGuardian), right? I you don't - install and use, it is a ""must"" in P2P.
OK, those ""ghosts"" are mostly gremlins (of all kinds), people who are stupid enough thinking that somene will seed movies without encrypted traffic, ones who are blocked either by added IPs to firewall or blocked by aforementioned PeerBlock. They should be ""out"", that's the point.

About seeding: Any decent human being, seeing who I am, what I share and how small are my ""swarms"" should achieve as minimum that famous 1.084. Those who do not worry about traffic should go high as they want. Initial-swarm however, is totally different story: only FAST people without ANY worries about ANY figures should join - rest of the people can wait and come later and then download ... and seed as told. 

Every frikkin day, every initial swarm get stuck because of stupid or illiterate people. They are be so blinded by greed or gains that he cannot see STOP sign all over, and for worse they make others to share their stupid destiny: downloading the file two hours instead 46 minutes."
,lilars26,2010-02-03T16:56Z,"O.K. and thanks.Now I know what the numbers mean.
Unbelievable,all the gov't agencies from around the world trying to see what I'm doing.Guess we can thank terrorists for that.I just hope they realise that I'm not a threat and go away.With my 60 gig cap and unreliable speeds,I will stay away from initial seedings. Thanks again."
[T],MelloYello,2010-02-27T21:15Z,Thanks for the heads up about peerblock.  Always used pg2 with my desktop and XP.  I got a laptop with vista and couldn't use pg2.  Does this have the subs for Japanese speaking part towards the end of te movie.  They seem kind of important.  I watched The FXG one and they didn't have them.  There was a sub folder which i can't open and read.  I use convertxtodvd and don't know how to  add subs myself.
