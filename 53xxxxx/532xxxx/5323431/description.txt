Magician: How dared you not to kiss the girl? How could you do that?

Bear: You know what that would lead to.

Magician: I don't! You don't love her.

Bear: That's not true!

Magician: You don't love her, otherwise the power of passion would have taken over! Who can tell what will happen, when someone is seized with strong noble emotions? Poor unarmed people overthrow kings! Out of love for their fellow brothers. Out of love for their nation soldiers defy death. Men of wisdom rise to the sky and plunge into hell. Out of love for Truth. And what have you done out
of love for a woman?
