Product Description:
In this unique predator-themed action-thriller, itâ€™s hunt and be hunted as you become two of the desertâ€™s creepiest predators: the Desert Tarantula and the Giant Desert Scorpion. Travel across a vast, detailed world, where every area swarms with enemies and natural hazards. Ambush and feed on your prey. Use the Wii controls to unleash a variety of fierce attacks against vicious enemies: rival spiders, lightning-quick lizards, divebombing wasps and hungry rats. Stalk, battle and explore from a unique and constantly shifting perspective as you crawl along vertical walls, through twisty underground tunnels and even upside-down! And if you survive the dangers up the food chain, youâ€™ll face larger predators, including the most dangerous creature of all: man. Combining the ferocious, fascinating behaviors of real-world creatures with the epic landscapes and cinematic excitement of fantasy/action movies, this is a game experience unlike anything you have ever encountered.
