Carmen Luvana is Christie, a nice girl whose life is not going real well. She's being hounded by bill collectors, her car has broken down and her cell phone battery is dying. She decides to go to the nearest house and ask for help. Gary and Constantine are shooting a porn film at the house that Christie visits and they're without their lead performer. Constantine, the director, decides to inflict a little amnesia to get this nice girl, who looks like she has all the right tools, in front of the camera.
