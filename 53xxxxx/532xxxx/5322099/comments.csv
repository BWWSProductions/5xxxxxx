1.Go to the installation directory where the game is installed
2.Next locate the Commando configuration file in the output folder.
3.It should be in .cfg or.CFG format
4.After locating the file, openit with Notepad
5.Replace the text in the file with the following text: SAVA
.SONIDO [ .VOLMUSICA 1.000000 .VOLEFECTOS 1.000000 .ACTIVO 1 ]
.SIZE [ .INITSIZE 2 ]
.PROFILE [ .USER 0 ]
.NETGAMEPLAYER [ ]
.SERVERADDRESS [ ]
.DEVELOP 1
6.now save the cfg file and start the Game
7.The save and load options should work now....
