American and British artists sing in German language - a fascinating as amusing part of the boundaries of popular music.

Singers who got to sing in German language sang their ways through the most different styles. The order went out not only to the lesser known artists - also the big names got called to do their duties.

If the sixties were the high tide of this trend to have American and British stars singing in German language, the following decade showed less releases of this kind. Anyhow - it was not the end of this kind of play.
