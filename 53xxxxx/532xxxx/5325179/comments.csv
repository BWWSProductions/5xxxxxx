,kingoflight,2010-02-01T05:25Z,"Yup its the catch up episode, i think the last one was narrated by ben pretty good reminder of whats been going on."
,herniator,2010-02-01T07:26Z,"I watched it on TV.  Useful recap considering the show is already 6 years on, and with all the bloody time travel and twists..."

,foxeye725aaaa,2010-02-02T13:53Z,"they waited  so fucking long for this season:( so that hey have to start the first episode with a 5 minutes view back... :( great method to waist minutes... 
i am pretty curious if all questions getting answered at the last season, or if this strange things happens all the time were only brain-jerking and have no connection to each other, so hopefully this pisser deliver a cool last season, cause i was start getting pissed of waiting so long, of unlogic splitted seasons, and no answers, but more question-marks...;)"
