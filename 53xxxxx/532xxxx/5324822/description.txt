                    Costume drama. It's harvest time - the most  
                    important time of the year in Lark Rise, when  
                    everyone helps to bring in the wheat that will  
                    feed them through winter. So when an epidemic  
                    hits it couldn't come at a worse time - with so  
                    many sick, how will they gather the wheat and  
                    prevent a winter of starvation? Help comes from  
                    an unlikely source, but just when it looks as  
                    though their problems are solved, they discover  
                    the worst is yet to come.
