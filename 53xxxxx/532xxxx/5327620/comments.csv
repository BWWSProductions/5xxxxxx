This Beta version will automatically expire in April 2010 when the final release version is released.

Thought I would just post this, as it is freely available through Adobe Labs Site, although however Adobe is being tight lipped with the new Photoshop CS5. I believe there is a Beta Version floating around, however with the latest CS5 they have apparently increased the security within the software...

Hope this information is of some use to all... "
