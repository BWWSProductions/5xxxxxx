,heffy_inc,2010-02-07T08:00Z,"I have just tested EP 10 on my machine using Windows Media Player, WinAmp, VLC and Real Player, and all played it OK. QuickTime didn't like it, but I don't have the codec for QT to play it installed. For those calling this a fake, please advise what you are using to play the file?"
,codgecodge,2010-02-15T05:39Z,"It's not fake.It plays fine with GOM player too. You just need the right codec.
I'll take the chance here to thank the uploader again for this great series. Am hanging for Ep 12 and 13 so please ignore our ignorant noob 'friends' here and upload for us who are very grateful indeed."
