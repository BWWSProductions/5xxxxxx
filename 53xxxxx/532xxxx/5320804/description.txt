Mary and Max (2009) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0978762/

The friendship between two unlikely pen pals: Mary, a lonely eight-year-old in Melbourne, and Max, an isolated older New Yorker. Spanning 20 years and two continents, Mary and Maxâ€™s friendship survives much more than the average diet of lifeâ€™s ups and downs.
