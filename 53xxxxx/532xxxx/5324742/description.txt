    Game Notes:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    While the war waged between the Allies and Soviets - from the sunny

    Florida Keys to a frozen Moscow - Yuri was quietly scheming, planning,

    testing, and devising. History went on without him - Russian Premier

    Romanov signed a historic peace treaty with the Allies and the free

    world remained free. Now it's Yuri's turn to make history, and wreak

    vengeance on his foes.

    

    In hidden bases and underground labs, Yuri has been perfecting his own

    means for his turn at world domination. Refining his mind-control

    technologies, he's created an army of terrors, from mind-controlling

    tanks to long-range psychics, whose brains are their biggest weapons.

    After all, a mind is a terrible thing to waste.

    It's time for Yuri's Revenge.
