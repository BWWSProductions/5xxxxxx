But,Waik is needed to work with SP1 or Higher WIM files,no?"

it might be. But i'm not the only one with the problem. I tried it also on a comp with vista home premium 32-bit and vista business 32-bit. And i'm using windows 7 professional 32-bit myself. I think it is a bug, that prevents vlite to recognize the needed files (WAIK or wimfltr). But finally i solved the problem as written above.

But thanks for the reaction."
