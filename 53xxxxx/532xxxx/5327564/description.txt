A lot of peoples encounter a problem if they want to use vlite 1.2. The problem is that the program always wants to install WAIK(windows automated installation kit) what is a huge file of about 1.3 GB. And after the installation the problem still occurs. I had the same problem and after som research i found a solution on some forums. I just want to share that solution with you.

The upload consists of:
1.vlite1.2 installer(you can spare time to search it on google) 
2.a rar file and 
3.a readme file with instructions.

I hope you will appreciate it.

Please seed after downloading.

Greetings & Succes..
