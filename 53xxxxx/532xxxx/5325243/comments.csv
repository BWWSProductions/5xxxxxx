,Konnisu,2010-02-25T20:57Z,I mean the one in which you said that it was not available in stores.
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-25T21:35Z,"Hi there, thanks for your comment.  I have just received your message, in regards to this DVD.  Yes this one is the official verison.  I have uploaded this because I am a huge Spandau fan and this is the one you would typically buy in the shops now.  The one I originally did which was my first torrent on here was actually the one I made myself before this one was made.  Obviously this is the best quality as these are taken from the original videos that were never released until now.  The one I made I had to do the best I could at the time because there wasn't such a thing and I had to get the video (not the sound) from the VHS as that was the only one available.

Hope this helps!

These videos are great now in this quality!  I luvs Spandau :-)"
,Konnisu,2010-02-25T21:39Z,"Thanks for the reply, i have one question.
How long do you think it take before the download will be finished.
I am using utorrent."
,Konnisu,2010-02-25T21:46Z,"Sorry, but i found out, it's about 4 days.
Can you give me instructions how to burn it to dvd."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-25T22:01Z,"Hi again!  Yes, thanks once again.  Really the answer to that question is it depends on your ISP to how fast or slow your torrents will download in uTorrent.  I don't have any problems myself, things work very fast for me, I can upload quite quick also because I have a good provider.  If you're having trouble then maybe think about getting a different one.  Best advice is really to read the reviews on ISPs to see what people say about them, that's how I learned."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-25T22:06Z,"Ok, here's what to do about burning a DVD.  If you download this you should get 2 folders called AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS.  If you don't have AUDIO_TS folder don't worry, it doesn't always upload that folder when you make a torrent on here because it's always empty.  Make sure you have your 2 folders named as above, AUDIO_TS empty and VIDEO_TS with all the DVD files in.  Then download a program called Img Tool Classic and use it to create a image of you DVD.  Have a couple of goes first using Img Tool Classic and you'll soon get the hang of it.  Then use Nero 8 or something and use the Burning Rom program to burn your image, very simple and easy really.  Remember and take this from me, it's always better to burn a DVD as an image because if you burn the individual files in Nero it can go wrong and give you a bad result.  The correct way is to always burn a single image file to a DVD.  Make the DVD first on the computer using that program I said and then just transfer it to a DVD using Nero 8.  That way will be fine."
,Konnisu,2010-02-25T22:36Z,"Thanks for telling me.
The download speed is currently 3 seeders with an estimated speed of 10 kb/s, with 4 days remaining."
,Konnisu,2010-02-26T20:38Z,"Hey, it's me again.
Downloading goes very slow, is there another way you can send this file to me besides torrents."
,Konnisu,2010-02-26T20:39Z,Maybe via e-mail.
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-26T21:19Z,"Nope, sorry.  This is the best way to send you this already.  Is it because your internet provider is blocking you from downloading using peer 2 peer?  I know there are a lot of providers that do that and they are shit!  You want to get something decent really if that's your problem.  It's what they call packet shaping or traffic shaping.  They use software to detect that you are downloading peer 2 peer and they slow you right down on purpose.  Obviously depends on which country you are living in."
,Konnisu,2010-02-27T10:37Z,"Ok, thanks for all the help and explanation."
,Konnisu,2010-02-27T10:37Z,Can i use Nero 9 to.
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-28T01:07Z,"Yes, Nero 9 is fine.  I use Nero 8 myself at the moment.  I have found a very good version of Nero 8.  I have found sometimes that recent versions of Nero can be a bit weird sometimes like say for example if you're buring a audio CD and you try and drag the tracks over to the layout window the order of the songs will get mixed up and stuff like that.  That happened to me before, it wouldn't allow me to put them in the correct order, kind of odd but I guess with Nero you can find weird little problems.  Usually though burning images is pretty straight forward and I've never encounted a problem from doing that."
