,djetaine,2011-06-08T23:05Z,"Could not get this working on on Win7x64 Ultimate. I get through every step and then at the last one it launches the white window that should say ""Please wait"" but it's just a blank white window. Eventually it sits at not responding and i have to kill the task. 
It then gets to the launcher screen, I click play and I get the same windows. 
Alas, guess I wont be playing this game. "
