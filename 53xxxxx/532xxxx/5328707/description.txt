PLOT SUMMARY:
Documentary on Near Death Experiences and trip`s to HELL And Back:
(+ 2 Heaven Videos)

23 Minutes in Hell by Bill Wiese:
---------------------------------
Bill Wiese saw the searing flames of hell, felt total isolation, and experienced 
the putrid and rotting stench, deafening screams of agony, terrorizing demons, 
and finally, the strong hand of God lifting him out of the pit. Bill was placed 
in Hell not as a casual observer, but as someone who was not saved. He recounts 
all the horrid details with such precision that it captivates the listener 
from start to finish. His soul was returned to his earthly body with a warning 
and message for all.

To Hell and Back - Dr. Maurice Rawlings:
----------------------------------------
Dr. Maurice Rawlings, MD, a heart surgeon, has written a number of books on the death experience and clearly shows from his own practice and from the experiences of his patients, that not everyone goes to the light when they die, where there is total love.  
Many of his patients, after being resuscitated on the operating table, spoke about hell.


Tyrone went to Hell:
--------------------
This is a "True Life after Death Story" of an individual who lost his right arm in a car accident then flat-lined. Watch and listen Tyrone tell his own experience while in hell.

God's Wrath is Hell:
--------------------
Watch and try to imagine people you know who are not saved in these shocking scenes. In this story, you will see a woman die and be cast into Hell. After watching the entire video, you should begin to grasp the horrors that await all those who are foolish enough to go to Hell.

"A Glimpse of Eternity" - by Ian McCormack:
-------------------------------------------
A Glimpse of Eternity One man?s encounter with death and the realms beyond it. 
What happens to us when we die?  ?A Glimpse of Eternity? is the incredible true 
story of one man?s encounter with death and the world beyond it. Stung by five box 
jellyfish while diving off the coast of Mauritius, Ian later died in hospital 
for between 15-20 minutes. During this time he experienced hell and heaven and 
came back to tell the story! Dying was his doorway to true life and his story 
is still transforming lives around the world as it touches on some of the 
deepest questions we all eventually ask.

Don Piper - 90 Minutes in Heaven:
---------------------------------
As he is driving home from a minister's conference, Baptist minister Don Piper 
collides with a semi-truck that crosses into his lane. He is pronounced dead at the scene. For the next 90 minutes, Piper experiences heaven where he is greeted by those who had influenced him spiritually. He hears beautiful music and feels true peace. Back on earth, a passing minister who had also been at the conference is led to pray for Don even though he knows the man is dead. Piper miraculously comes back to life and the bliss of heaven is replaced by a long and painful recovery. 
For years Piper kept his heavenly experience to himself. Finally, however, 
friends and family convinced him to share his remarkable story.

90 Minutes in Heaven offers a glimpse into a very real dimension of eternity. 
It encourages those recovering from serious injuries and those dealing with the 
loss of a loved one. The experience dramatically changed Piper's life, 
and it will change yours too.

It s Supernatural - Mickey Robinson:
------------------------------------
After surviving severe burns resulting from an airplane crash while skydiving, 
Mickey Robinson had a "Death's Door" experience and spiritual rebirth that 
radically changed his life. During the long period of time required to recover, 
he not only received several miraculous healings, but also struggled with finding 
his purpose in life.
