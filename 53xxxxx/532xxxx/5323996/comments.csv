,davidlissfan,2010-05-31T19:39Z,"I do not know why you added ""Doom 3"" as a tag, but other than that you will get nothing but praise from me. Great upload, Sephiroth93."
,Payback1991,2010-06-04T17:01Z,why is there no hud or crosshair in doom 2???
,Sephiroth93,2010-07-09T17:25Z,"There is, on me... so.. Dunno really, I need redownload this xD"
,Sephiroth93,2010-07-09T17:27Z,"@davidlissfanrnrnThanks =) I just wanted to share great and legend game =) Zdoom is our saviour, without it, doom wouldn\'t work in vista or Windows 7 :/"
,Arse_Done_69,2011-01-17T08:00Z,Thanks a lot. I actually have this game for real. I have the actual disk with them on here. I downloaded this so I can play on windows 7. I needed zdoom. So thanks for helpin me out.
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-11T06:28Z,"better upload! http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5834922/Doom_Collection_%28all_the_older_doom_games%29

has zdoom too but has another fix included so you don't even have to use zdoom."
,Sephiroth93,2011-02-16T03:54Z,"Actually on my windows 7 ultimate 64-bit, that doesn't work and hey... Mine is unrar and play, your is unrar, install and play... Why? Why you need installer?"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-03-09T11:03Z,"im on windows 7 home premium 64-bit with intel i7core 920 cpu with 2.8 ghz per cpu with 8 cpu's total, 4 virtual and 4 physical. nvidia geforce gtx 260 with 1.5 gb video ram, 9gb ram, and 1tb hd. IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY ON MINE :) (and my other 3 pc's too) i think i might report you as a spammer, i see no reason as to why you had to post a link on my torrent to yours, mine has zdoom inside too btw. oh and if people want they can use mine without installing too, but itr's better to just install because than it creates shortcuts for you so you don't have to do so. it also places the folder somewhere out of your way so your desktop doesn't get all cluttered. for some people (believe it or not) they don't understand what to do if you can't install it, even though it says what to do in the instructions.....

,Sephiroth93,2011-03-10T20:46Z,"Well, I had a bad day earlier and advertising an exact same product was stupid anyway. Forgive me."
,sharck1970,2011-03-11T05:10Z,"Dude! This is awesome! So easy to run! Thanks to infinity! Two requests? Heretic and Hexen, both also by the ID group. It would be greatly appreciated. I am not going to sleep for the next 48 hours now. "
,Sephiroth93,2011-03-11T23:23Z,"I have Heretic's and Hexen's Wads, you could play them with zdoom though... I upload them then."
,Sephiroth93,2011-03-11T23:45Z,"Well, here is all Heretic's and Hexen's.

Enjoy.

,jolle747,2011-03-19T17:58Z,Thanks man
,ChikinMan,2011-03-23T04:28Z,"Just for some info, there's a way better program for these games than ZDoom. It is called Skulltag, and its similar to ZDoom only it has super beefed-up graphics with OpenGL. You can even play Doom online with it, no joke. Just google it and you'll find it."
,Sephiroth93,2011-04-17T03:23Z,OR Zdaemon^
,Igneous_X4,2011-05-09T09:06Z,Thanks for the upload. Clean and with high ease of use: simply unpack and play. Why did this torrent receive negative ratings?
