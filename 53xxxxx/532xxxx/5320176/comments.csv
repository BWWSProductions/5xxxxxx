very nice quality, sounds and images are perfect no problems at all.

Max354,
check in device manager and see if there are any yellow question marks if not then it could also be that your audio is using a different default program, if it's not that then maybe you have the wrong version of VLC media player installed, hope that helps, let me know how you went.."
