Another Friday, another chip in the once Mighty Ship of States.  The shine is off the Obama apple, so to speak, and depending on how you look at it, Obama has either failed to deliver on the promised change or hasnâ€™t had time or resources to undo the damage wrought by the Bush Crime Family.

Weâ€™ll discuss the aftermath, the coming midterm battle, the future of Donâ€™t Ask/Donâ€™t Tell, the Unsinkable Ben Bernake, The forgotten health care reform, and much more!  And weâ€™ll play political podcast trivia and give away ONE annual subscription to the commercial-free podcast tonight!
