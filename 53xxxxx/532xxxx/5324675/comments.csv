,gearofwar,2010-02-05T01:47Z,"Once again, sublime."
,blingpig,2010-02-06T06:46Z,"Thanks again SB. I am fairly lacking in Italian bands so this should prove beneficial. I wonder if there is any from the orient like Japan et al or the Latino world available. It seems like they do not stay seeded long so I can only hope to hear them one day. I think I got one album from Spain from the seventies, but they just weren't available. Come on you worlders, educate us with your progressive rythyms! Pleeaasse."
,grubtrot,2010-02-08T00:11Z,You make me smile on the way to work
,dagseoul,2010-03-06T03:16Z,"love it all (well, I'm not into the jazz fusion & symphonic prog:  could never get into that stuff, don't know why)

but these are seeding well and on this part I'm really looking forward to Improve Sound Ltd albums.  I have never had anything complete.

cheers"
