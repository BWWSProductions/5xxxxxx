The First Age are depicting the struggles of the mortal races after the Gods have abandoned the world,and the magic energies are slowly dissipating from reality.

Short introduction to the races created so far:

The Alliance:
Sofisticated Ogres with a reforming mindset has decided to expand their Empire, with the help of allied barbarians in the form of Orcs and Goblins

The Pact:
The major resistance versus the Ogre Empire expansion, the pact consists of feudal Humans, hardy Dwarves and the bloodhungry Elves.

The Risen:
Ever since their God was banished from existence, the Risen lacks an afterlife and so their bodies ages but does not die. The hints of vanishing magic promises eternal oblivion and final release, and so the last of the worlds Magic resources must be stretched and used so terminal rest can be found.
