,spartan22,2010-10-05T18:05Z,"first extract the files with winrar, then open them with magic iso"
,biotronic.project,2010-11-19T03:47Z,"How do I unzip?
I gathered the parts using the ""HJSplit""

And he created a file ""FLT-RA21"" without extension

I've tried to rename as ""FLT-RA21.RAR,"" but he asks me:

C: \ Downloads \ Command_And_Conquer_Red_Alert_2-FLT \ CD1 \ FLT-RA21.R00

but there is no file like this ...

help me"
,Dokter_Kodive,2011-02-07T07:53Z,"Works like a charm
Heres what you do:

1) Download
2) Open any file by double clicking then open it with WinRar
3) Mount the disc image in PowerISO
4) Goto My Computer
5) Double Click On The Disc
6) Goto Setup
7) Install"

,MrDavide,2011-04-16T03:45Z,"Excellent torrent, only prob is no cd key for this one. and for those that complain like little fuckheads STFU theirs full instructions on how to install in comments if your so fucking dumb then leave."
,Ryucosu,2011-05-19T09:50Z,"Hey im a nice guy so ill tell any new person how to actually get this working, this was new to me as well the FLT files but heres what you do
1.open the folder you saved your Command and conquer files
2.rename ALL the FLT-RA21.001 to FLT-RA21.r01 replace all the first 0's with the lowercase r.
2.1/2 DO NOT RENAME FLT-RA21.RAR that will make you a dumbass and not let the file be reconized
3. click the first file theFLT-RA21.r01 one then use winraw to extract it. you get a CUE. flie and a BIN.
now theses files show up as blank pages seems they arnt reconized by daemon tools or the programs you have right?? WRONG
4. click mount in daemon tools (or whatever program you have to mount) go to the file and mount the file that appears, its usually the CUE file.
--------------------------------------------------------
There ya go people, the info has the Ser key but if you cant open it (like me) just open it in notepad/wordpad.

and yes to all the idiots who say DIS DOZZENTS WORKZ. you need some basic file/program knolige to do alot of stuff on thepiratebay so stfu and just say you dont have a fucking clue"
,sami1080p,2011-06-21T14:54Z,@ryucosu its a long work just change name of first file and then extract it its easy
,Onlyonetarget,2011-07-05T12:12Z,"If you need a Key, You and do 2 things. 
1) go to Serials.ws and try finding a key there for free.
2) Download a ""Crack"" for your game and copy the files over. 
So now that you know, politely, stop bitching and play (:"
,foreknowapparel,2011-10-10T04:13Z,do you guys know if this works for LAN. (obviously with two different keys.)
,foxyice,2012-02-23T11:18Z,for LAN EAkeygen works
,aminehacker,2012-03-22T07:47Z,i need key to extrait the file
,gr33nday,2012-04-29T17:56Z,022631-155039-312171-0010
,DevilsLove,2012-05-23T00:58Z,Yeah...so i cant get this thing to work and..ryucosu that shit didnt work either. neither does the normal way of using winrar and daemon products...unless you have a better way of dealing with Flt files. because nothing anyone has suggested..even following it step by step has worked
