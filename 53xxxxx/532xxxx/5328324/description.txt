Dead Set 2008 true horror zombie movie +subs +sample FE_CBB 2hrs .mp4  [RipMinion]

"The idea was simple; the editing not so much... Turning DEAD SET (2008 TV Series) into a True Horror Zombie Movie takes all the best Horror elements, then leaves the distractions on the cutting floor, plus the plot has been trimmed for better pacing.  Dead Set was an incredibly great TV show and the most shocking one for a long time. Responses all over the globe were praising it and rightfully so; from the plot, to the cast, to the filming and the special effects, it was a really well crafted horror show.  The worst over-the-top moments have been removed (eg. scenes with Patrick â€“ the producer) as well as dragging conversations, scenes that lead nowhere or are stupid in trying to be funny.  Thatâ€™s where I wanted to get in.  This show had so much potential for a cool fanedit movie that I just could not let it pass and I think the outcome is among the best zombie movies of the entire genre."~  -CBB aka Boon

Encoding 'inspired by newartriot, also llt, lifechanger & secretmyth' for an Optimal blend of Quality, Compression, plus I add full AVCHD-Compliancy (eg. burn multiple movies to DVD-R disc then playback on BluRay Players & PS3 up to 1080p quality - see below).

Playback issues? Here's the easy fix:  http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

For fast & easy Convert-to-DVD, Burn, and Play on any DVD Player from DVD-R or DVD+R_DL media, I recommend 'ConvertXtoDVD' software. Either buy or search for the Torrent.

For fast & easy Convert-to-AVCHD, Burn, and Playback on BluRay Players & PS3 in full 720p quality from a variety of disc types (DVD-R, DVD+R_DL, BD-R, BD-RE, etc.), I recommend 'multiAVCHD' freeware {link follows}.  It can auto-generate a slick customizable iTunes-style slide menu for multiple movies and burn everything to a single disc!  100% AVCHD Compliant Video, such as this, is quickly made ready (Non-compliant video is automatically re-encoded thus reducing quality, wasting lots of time, and bloating file size):

  http://www.videohelp.com/tools/multiAVCHD        (Note: the latest version broke AAC-HE 48KHz audio, so...)
  http://www.videohelp.com/tools/YAMB              (1. extract AAC audio track to .aac file)
  http://www.videohelp.com/tools/dBpowerAMP        (dbPowerAMP is free forever, only a few features expire)
  http://www.dbpoweramp.com/codec-central-m4a.htm  (2. convert .aac to .wav, 3. In multiAVCHD: replace audio track)
  http://ImgBurn.com/  (Tip: If subs are stuck On or doubled then use YAMB to remux, Un-Checking the Imbedded subs)
