,fluxocity,2010-02-26T18:54Z,"I've no idea of the quality of this upload but the film itself is a piece of crap.  I watched this when it was on TV and it bored me to death.  The effects are poor, the actors are useless and the script is horrible."
,RipMinyn,2010-02-27T03:42Z,">""I watched this when it was on TV""

If the description is read, one discovers that this film is an ""Unauthorized re-Edit"" designed to vastly improve upon the original.  Thus, it would be unlawful to broadcast an unauthorized version on TV; so, the above comment actually belongs here...

Please set up Port Forwarding to receive Incoming Connections.  All of my uploads are permanently seeded (unless specified otherwise), but unfortunately the seeder doesn't accept incoming connections (for security reasons); thus, the swarm needs at least one downloader that accepts incoming connections to forward data on to those that may not or cannot.  Thank you for understanding.

You're most welcome!  They really help so much with thick British accents and very fast speech.  I had to OCR the DVD format Subtitles and manually correct all the misspellings, typos, etc."
,mitcjase,2010-10-31T08:33Z,"The last I checked, two ""F""'s does not equal an ""M"". ""Omice"" is not ""office"" in British-talky-speak. Office spells office. If you're going to edit everything and add subtitles, at least make the subtitles optional, or even line up, not take up half the screen OR even match what is being said! If you're going to go and edit movies, learn to spellcheck and typeset. 

TL;DR

Don't waste your time downloading this bag of cock-sucking shite! Go download the original! Good day, sir!"
,NerdyJustin,2011-03-30T11:43Z,"this was REALLY bad. since the uploader is so ""dead set"" on replying to negative comments, it only proves that concern over this monstrosity is still great.
(btw, did ya like that little joke I did there? I just wanted to give the readers some form of entertainment since this download will not.)"
