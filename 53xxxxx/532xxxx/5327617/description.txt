When a bullet ridden Angel of Death, known as Azrael, crashes into Gotham City, Batman is drawn into the mystery of Azrael and the Order of St. Dumas.  The quest leads both Batman and the young replacement Azrael to Europe where they separately investigate the murder of elder Azrael and the trail of death he followed.

Created by Dennis O'Neil and Joe Quesada Azrael would later go on to play a pivotal role in the Knightfall saga and be a regular member of the Batman Family.
