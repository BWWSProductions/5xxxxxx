""thanks I looked at your link... but man that's complicated...""

The steps in the comments on the single-layer link are for booting on a Hackintosh.

That DVD will boot and install on a ""real"" Mac-you will just have to uncheck extra languages, printer drivers in install>options since they have been removed from the disc, to make it single layer. I've used it to install on a few ""real"" Macs and also (with a boot disc) on a few Hacks ;-)"

,cp22,2010-02-04T08:34Z,"Thanx to the torrentmac.ru team for producing this installer.

I have managed to do a basic install on my Dell Inspiron 1720, but my keyboard doesn't work and any of the Kexts for Audio (Sigmatel 9205), Video (NVidia 8600 GT), Lan (Broadcom 440) didn't work with 10.6.2 :(

Anyone got any ideas where I can find working solutions for these? I have tried Googling, but only seem to find old versions which don't work.

Tnx again, and keep up the great work."
