Synopis: A Turkish coastal town, in 1990: The unexpected visit of his long lost brother Asaf disturbs Azmi Arifoglu. 40 years ago Asaf was a prisoner of war, and Azmi managed to let him pronounce dead to marry his fiancÃ©e Nevin. After Nevin's decision to live with Asaf, Azmi feels his honor insulted. The conflict shakes the whole family. Meanwhile 13-year-old Arif falls in love with Bahar his age. An unexpected rival shows up and he gets jealous. But Bahar stands by him. When Bahar has to move far away, both are sad. But many years later they meet again, marry and become a little family.
