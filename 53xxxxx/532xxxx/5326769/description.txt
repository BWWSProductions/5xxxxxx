Life and times of Prince Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921),
Russian patrician, geographer, anarchist and author
of 'Fields, Factories and Workshops'.

The story, told retrospectively, picks up just prior
to Kropotkin's famously farcical break-out from 
St Petersburg's Peter And Paul Fortress, in 1876.
