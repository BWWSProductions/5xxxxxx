Richard Kern: Extra Action (And Extra Hardcore)

Photography: Richard Kern
Music: Thurston Joseph Moore

Photographer Richard Kern likes real women: unpretentious, unadorned, and definitely undressed. Those who love Kern's books know each is an invitation to join him as he follows them through their homes - or his New York apartment - from backyard to kitchen to bathroom to bedroom, capturing every sexy and embarrassing moment. Whenever Kern photographs one of these energetic, clothes-dropping exhibitionists, he brings out a video camera and asks them to "roll around and do something interesting for a few minutes". Extra Action documents 60 of these innocent amateur incidents set to an original musical score by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth.
