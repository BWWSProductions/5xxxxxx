Afghanistan: Behind Enemy Lines.

By the middle of this year, over 150,000 foreign troops will be stationed in Afghanistan. While most of the new troops will head to the volatile south of the country, a new frontline, operating almost under the radar of NATO, is encircling the north of the country.



The insurgents are aiming to take over the countryside surrounding the towns and cities and to block the main supply route, the Kunduz-Baghlan road, which services coalition troops across much of Afghanistan since the traditional route through Pakistan became too treacherous.



Dispatches goes inside the enemy camp in northern Afghanistan as award-winning Afghan reporter Najibullah Quraishi is granted access to an army of extreme Islamic combatants.
