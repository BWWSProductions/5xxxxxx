It's watchable, just. Very blurry, soft-focus, strange bleeding at the edge of the screen whenever the screen is white, etc.

V/5
A/4

Thanks anyway."

,superfido,2010-01-31T22:14Z,"yes, it's a good copy.  the a5 v4 given by artpeppar is too low. while not perfect, the sync, video, and sound is all good.  the russian comes only as a credits description in the beginning and end (voiceover).

i'd say a a8 v 8 and i am generally critical of ts.

this is good. download and seed.

the movie is even pretty good.

cheers and thankyou zingooo"

,13art,2010-02-03T02:31Z,"not bad, but it is being tracked by the studio"
,spiketank,2010-02-14T07:35Z,"the screenshots make it look like it's R5, regardless of the catch-phrase ""dvdscr""..."
