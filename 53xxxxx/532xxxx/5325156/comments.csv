I realized today that I?ve been tagging CTC Playlists incorrectly since the very beginning, which has been making iTunes play them out of order for anyone who downloads them. Most people won?t care about song order, but if you do (yay!), here?s what to do: select all the tracks in a playlist, right-click, click ?Get Info? and set Album Artist to ?Various Artists?. The result will be the playlist that I spend hours compiling every month. Cool.

Sorry about the possible inconvenience!"
