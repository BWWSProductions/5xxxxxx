`       CUT THE CRAP PLAYLIST - SERIOUSLY UNCRAP - JANUARY 2010        `
       ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This month: New Gorillaz, Vampire Weekend, Owen Pallett (previously known
as Final Fantasy), Broken Bells, Caribou and more! Plus, two fantastic
remixes by my favourite remix artist, Diplo, one of which has been making
the rounds on the music blogs lately (for very good reason). 

I'd like to apologize in advance for putting "Haiti" by Arcade Fire on
this month's playlist -- shamelessly topical, but also a genuinely great
song. Everyone likes Arcade Fire, right? They must.

Also, Valentine's Day is coming up... hope you have a good one!

Cheers,

Josh

P.S.: Thanks to the people who introduced me to Givers, Just Jack, Miami
Horror, The Presets and all the other artists I couldn't fit on this
month's playlist!

Know of a song or artist that deserves to be in a future CTC Playlist?
