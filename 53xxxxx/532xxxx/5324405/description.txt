Technical resources used by radio amateurs have varied widely over the past century â€“ magazine articles, textbooks, application notes, CD-ROMs, and Web pages have all provided training and tutoring. Yet one reference has been a constant companion to the Amateur Radio service since 1926 â€“ The ARRL Handbook, known as simply, â€œthe Handbookâ€ to hams and radio professionals alike. From its position on a workbench, in a technical library, or at the operating desk, there is nothing like the Handbookâ€™s immediacy and accessibility, providing instant consultation and guidance.
