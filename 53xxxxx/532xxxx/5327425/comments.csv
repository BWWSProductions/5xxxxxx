,filfiesta,2010-02-02T10:33Z,Is this movie compressed to dvd5 or just the extras been stripped and the quality is 100% ??? Are there any greek subs?
,SirSaWa,2010-02-02T12:25Z,"filfiesta - I compressed the movie. From the beginning, the file was over 7 gb.
But I think that the quality is pretty good on my 50-TV. I think there is greek sub. On the meny, on subtitles, there is a language that i can't read, so I think that it is greek, but i'm not 100% sure."
,filfiesta,2010-02-02T13:39Z,"thanks for answering! i have 2 final questions: how that sub on the subs menu u believe it's greek look like, does it look like this ''????????'' or ''????????''? (Ellinika in greeklish, i hope the font here illustrades greek). and are there any bonus features in this dvd? excuse me for all these extra questions, it would have been easier for me by watching the total number of dvd files & downloading only the menu files to find out the answers but now is difficult because it's one iso format file. i really love this movie and hope to find it in full dvd-r uncompressed some day, thanks again for your effort."
,SirSaWa,2010-02-02T15:19Z,"Yes, there is bonus materials. ""The making of Tremors"", ""production notes"", ""cast & filmmakers"" and ""theatrical trailer"".
The subititles I really don't understand, is something like this _ _ _ _APCKH."
,vertigo_81,2010-02-02T20:35Z,Varför har du snott min Torrent och komprimerat den och säger du själv gjort den?
,vertigo_81,2010-02-02T20:40Z,"By the way, this is a Torrent I uploaded and during the upload SirSaWa complained regarding my uploadingspeed...
But if you want the ""Clean"" and uncompressed Torrent, you can visit
thepiratebay.org/user/vertigo_81"
,SirSaWa,2010-02-02T23:52Z,"vertigo_81 - Snott och snott. Jag tycker du har snott den lika mycket som jag har.
Eller hur?
Du kan få all ära. Inte bryr jag mig alls! Jag förminskade den (så att folk som inte kan sånt), så att man kan bränna den på en vanlig DVD-skiva.
Något fel med de?
Om alla skulle hålla på som du, skulle det knappats funnits några torrentfiler att ladda ner.
Pajas!"
