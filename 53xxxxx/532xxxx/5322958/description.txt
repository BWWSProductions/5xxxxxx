Roger Bolton travelled to Assisi to examine how the church
betrayed St. Francis [and implicitly, Christ].

St Francis pressed the church to return to Christ's core
message, the beatitudes. The church stayed with the wealth,
the loony preachers, & the Old Testament, and celebrated
Francis' life of poverty by building sumptuous churches.
