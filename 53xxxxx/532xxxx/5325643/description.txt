Synopsis:

    In this feature length documentary, directors German GutiÃ©rrez and Carmen  Garcia present a searing indictment of the Coca-Cola empire and its alleged  kidnapping, torture and murder of union leaders trying to improve working  conditions in Colombia, Guatemala and Turkey. The filmmakers follow labour  rights lawyers Daniel Kovalik and Terry Collingsworth and an activist for  the Stop Killer-Coke! campaign, Ray Rogers, as they attempt to hold the  giant U.S. multinational beverage company accountable in this legal and  human rights battle.

    Listed below are union leaders at Coca-Cola's Colombian bottling plants who  have been murdered. Hundreds of other Coke workers have been tortured,  kidnapped and/or illegally detained by violent paramilitaries, often  working closely with plant managements.
