NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
Well lets get this straight before we start.....This is NO dvdscr what so ever :lol: and far from it!!
Also there is no dvdr for it either (maybe a custom made upscaled one).We got the source file of
ELEKTRI4KA and all it is,is a 1.37gig avi file and alot of that is taken up by the russian AC3 audio track....
after removing it your left with around 1.15gig avi file.
Many reasons why this isn't : colours are well fooked compared to the trailors for the film but the main reason is:hmmm: never seen cig burns before in any type of screener......

Anyway that explains our tagging of this,as we think it is a old fashion TC....straight off the reel.
Sources....well video like stated of elektri4ka (thanks) and the audio is off mentions (thanks).....Audio we have
left untouched but the video we have filtered the colouring,sharpnes,resized and gave it a good clean.
We've tried to match up the colouring to the offical trailor the best we could....of course your never going to get 100% but
we've got it pretty close.......so enjoy this nice TC
