,wazwinzard,2010-02-02T03:43Z,Use the WoM client.
,rutoy,2010-02-02T06:26Z,ive tried putting the files in the latest client but it just gives me an error
,wazwinzard,2010-02-03T05:13Z,"God, just look at the webpage."
,rutoy,2010-02-04T06:37Z,i said i looked at the source of the indev page and that i cant figure it out.im clearly a noob at this.so why cant u be kind and remove 1 less noob from this existence and help me out
,C-A-G-E,2010-02-09T07:11Z,Do you actually know how this is supposed to work or are you just messing with us?
,ShadowLuigi147,2010-02-10T04:36Z,"Yeah...this is confusing. I don't know java, and I don't think rutoy does either. So, what do I put where and what do I do?"
,castrathica,2010-02-10T19:11Z,"Oh this is great. Notch himself said he'd pull the indev versions if people start spreading them elsewhere. You've just dug our and your own grave to play some of the best stuff out there, asshole."
,kingjoe,2010-02-21T23:11Z,So I have tried using the wom client and looking at the source of the page but I too am lost.  Any advice here would be extremely welcome.
,rage08,2010-02-25T18:22Z,"Seriously, someone tell us how to get this shit working."
,Ausfriend,2010-02-26T05:21Z,"...

Notch said he'd cancel Indev and won't do any more sneak peeks if it's pirated, and it's only 10 euros, which is like $14 USD or something.

And pirating a small indie game like this is stupid as fuck anyway, it's being updated every day, and i sure as hell no-one is going to rerelease or redownload another client every day.

Buy the game you fucking leeches"
,Gyve,2010-02-26T13:16Z,"This torrent missing key data to be able to be run at all. It just sort of ""looks"" legit."
,Slothmoss,2010-04-25T14:47Z,"ausfriend, over 20,000 people have downloaded this 20 dollar game...so i think $400,000 split between two people is quite enough where pirating doesn't really effect them..."
,professor,2010-04-29T03:44Z,"@castrathica

No, by saying that he basically made sure it'd be spread around. Basic, human psychology. I bought it though, so worth it."
,Zerothis,2010-05-13T01:03Z,"LOL. Piracy takes skills. Some of you need to face facts, you don't have what it take and must go back to being consumers.

""i think $400,000 split between two people is quite enough""
We think about this. The game is currently in development, as in not finished. Suppose people stopped paying? Would developers be as eager to finish the game?"
,DJkeemstar,2010-06-28T13:54Z,"alright ive managed to fix it, please email me, its a bit of a shpeel

,CheesusTehLord,2010-07-02T11:29Z,"A lot of content in Minecraft was stolen from a much less popular game.
It's fairly ironic; if you purchase the game, you're supporting intellectual property theft. If you pirate the game.... well, that one is self explanatory."
,sirmot,2010-08-04T20:08Z,"@CheesusTehLord
Yea i think you're right. I saw my little brother playing a game JUST like minecraft... except it had a lot more features. There was even something like a FPS in the game. "
,Ryucosu,2010-10-25T01:20Z,"For the people who say 
""OO GOD I CANT PALY THE GAME THE FILES THE FIELS I DONT UNDERSTAND HEHLPSZ!!!""...You are a idiot and should go back to being a consumer. it takes skill and time to pirate, its complicated but you gota learn on your own...Besides i Refuse to pay 15 bucks for a game that isnt even in its goddamn beta stages yet"

,Mothaload,2011-04-05T19:35Z,"FIRST: you're an asshole, why is it so hard to explain to us how to use the game ?
SECOND: For the game to work, you can download 
the fiddler version from TPB (youll find it) and put these files instead.
THIRD: THANKS, the game is awesome, i saw the Steves and Beasty Boy..."
,gamer55567,2011-09-21T21:25Z,"You guys are such idiots. All you need to do is delete your files from your .minecraft folder, install the files with WinRAR, 7-Zip, or any other archive program into the folder, and you are ready to go. It's that simple."
