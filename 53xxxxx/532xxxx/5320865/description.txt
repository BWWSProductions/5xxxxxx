July 7 we are honored to serve" Arenes de Nimes ", an ancient amphitheater in the French city of Nimes,which was built by the Romans and is considered one of the most interesting concert venues in the world. We thought that this evening will be memorable, so we asked our French friends invited a film crew and record the history of this holiday. The result is a â€˜Francais Pour Une Nuitâ€™ (the title translates as "French for one night"), which Release Notes recorded the entire concert, interview us and video taken with YOU, our enterprises in the audience. All this and much more will go on sale November 23, 2009! 
â€˜Francais Pour Une Nuitâ€™ has become for us a special release, because he was not only filmed in France,but all aspects of it are French, because the concert was filmed, written and assembled by the  French operator and editor cover and box design (more on this later!) did the French design team, even all the output disc written 
in French. The only thing on this disc is not French, itâ€™s three Americans and a Dane on the scene, as well as photographs taken Englishman Ross Halfin (Ross Halfin)
