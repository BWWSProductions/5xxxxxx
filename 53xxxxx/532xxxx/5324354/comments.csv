,President_Kush,2010-06-06T15:20Z,"Thanks for this one man.  Saw the previews a while back, then couldn't remember the name, just found it out last night by accident.  

was whatching resident evil on tv, checked wiki to see what else milla jovovich was in, and there it was, also didn't know steve zahn was in it, he's pretty funny.  

just wanted to comment on the file though...don't get why its in .RAR's ????  it should already be compressed in .ISO file.  the .ISO is only 4.32GB, but then you packed in .RAR and it goes up to 4.36GB plus its just an extra hassle to unpack .RAR's and the unpack seemed to take longer than normal for a file this size."
