BTW any recommendations on annomoys downloads. 

SHAME on you TTC. Gorilla methods will get you now where. I buy a couple product a year from you, but as a struggling student I can't afford, but want more. "

,ut1880h,2010-05-14T16:01Z,"Wow! This a great course. Dr. Fovell is a helluva communicator. Thanks much to the uploader.

As you'll quickly find out, this course would actually be be much better as avi movies since he refers to visual aids quite often. The weird part is, Fovell is so skilled at communications that he actually does a pretty decent job at verbally painting the visuals in your mind. If the movies are ever available I would still highly recommend downloading them over the mp3s.   "
