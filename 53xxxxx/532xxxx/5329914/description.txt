SCARED proudly presents:
New mixtape from Evil Empire featuring new tracks from Camâ€™Ron. A lot of them are leaked off of the upcoming â€œBoss of Bossesâ€ tape. Naturally, the tape features a lot of exclusives on it. Iâ€™ll post some of the standout tracks on this one. Not sure about you all, but Iâ€™m getting real tired of the Evil Empire drops with the old guy talking about driving in lanes and selling this and that and all that other nonsense. Evil Empire, Kill The Noise, and let the music play. Always a free mixtape download over here. Home of the free mixtape downloads. Tracklist and downloads below. Get Rightâ€¦
