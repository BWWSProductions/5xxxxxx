,kvestantin,2010-02-02T07:52Z,"2nafish, thanks for answering about Nancy Wilson. If you'll find the good quality video for her 'All For Love', please upload )

There are few Heart's videos that I am still looking for in good quality, maybe you have them?
They are ""Stranded"" (1990), ""Secret"" (1990) and ""You're The Voice"" (1991). I made upload with Stranded and You're The Voice here at TPB, but the quality was not so good - it was from DVD5 ""Heart - Video Anthology"". I think if you (or somebody) have rips from VH1 with these videos, they must be MUCH better quality."

Would you happen to have a rip of the video for ""Lunatic Fringe"" by Red Rider ?

Cheers"
[V],2nafish,2010-02-02T13:12Z,I don't have the Red Rider video or Stranded or You're The Voice. I have Secret from VH1 with no logos or titles because they left their logo machine off. I'll try to upload it tonight if I can find it.

Secret from Heart is the most wanted among all mentioned )))"
