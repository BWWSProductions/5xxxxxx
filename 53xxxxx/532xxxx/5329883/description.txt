Future rock historians may point to the early 2000s as the point at which hardcore died â€” not because of the creeping influence of emo or the hegemony of major record labels, but because that's when hardcore bands decided that pretentious literary references and arty song titles were cool. Hence the band name Anterrabae, for example. In the proto-chick-lit novel I Never Promised You a Rose Garden, Anterrabae was the name of a god forever falling to earth in a shower of fire â€” at several different levels, an irresistible name for a hardcore band that aspires to depth. Hence also the faux-sophisticated album title And Our Heart Beat in Our Fingertips, Without Reason, and song titles like "I Lifted Her Dress over Her Head and Unscrewed Her Leg" and "My Wrists Are Rivers, My Fingers Are Words." Musically, this stuff is actually lots of fun: there are plenty of unusual and challenging song patterns (note the 5/4 intro and subsequent structured chaos of "The Filthy Habits of Ex.Lovers") and the subtle complexity churning beneath the surface noise on both "Pink & Tender" and "Stay Moist." The instrumental bits offer some of the most powerful moments on the album, but the tag-team screaming (and, hey, singing!) on "I Lifted Her Dress and Unscrewed Her Leg" is also very effective. Good stuff, and it would be even better without the crust of whoa-dude pseudo-philosophy on top.
