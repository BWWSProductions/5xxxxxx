Currently I'm still seeding episode 1.
Tomorrow 31st Jan 2010 is episode 2 ...etc"
,BasilBrush,2010-01-31T04:51Z,It might be a good idea to ring up Sky and get the engineer to check the alignment and signal strength. The front plastic cover over the LNB can sometimes attenuate the signal if the LNB is old. Replacing the LNB and re-alignment of the dish should help improve the signal.

These are superb quality, well done.
This is possibly the most enjoyable series I have ever downloaded.
The quality is awesome."
