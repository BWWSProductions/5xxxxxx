,mark.taiwan,2010-02-07T14:09Z,The video was very laggy for me both in Windows Media Player and VLC. What codec do you use?
[V],2nafish,2010-02-07T15:02Z,The codec is the mpeg2codec or mpeg2 filter for wmp but if you are using the VLC player I think the codec is not necessary. The VLC player should play the video just fine. I don't know why it doesn't work for you.
