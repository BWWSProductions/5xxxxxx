,jksharp,2010-01-31T20:51Z,is this a good copy?
,sman301,2010-01-31T22:50Z,"This is IMBT version of the movie
All i did is re-encode it in h264 format to make the movie file smaller so that it will take less time for people to download.
The quality is pretty good i think for a 700mb.

All credits to IMBT"
