"Need You Now" is the title of a country music song recorded by American country music group Lady Antebellum. It serves as the lead-off single and title track to their second studio album, which was released on January 26, 2010.

The three group members, along with Josh Kear wrote this song about yearning for companionship in the middle of the night. Hillary Scott explained that this song, and many others on their second album, "are about what we are learning as we go through the ups and downs of different relationships." She added: "All three of us know what it's like to get to that point where you feel lonely enough that you make a late night phone call that you very well could regret the next day. But you do it anyway because it's the only thing that's going to give you any relief in that moment."

"Need You Now" reached #1 on the Canadian Radio & Records Country Singles for the week dated October 16, 2009; it also became the first single to spend more than seven weeks at #1 on that chart since "Better Life" by Keith Urban in 2005. It became the trio's second Number One hit on the Hot Country Songs chart on the chart dated November 28, 2009, where it stayed for five weeks, making it the first song to hold the #1 position for more than four weeks since Taylor Swift's "Our Song" spent six weeks at #1 between December 2007 and January 2008. "Need You Now" has also reached a peak of #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 making it their highest charting single on that chart.
