       Graham Bell and Ed Leigh present coverage from the men's downhill 
       in Kitzbuehel, Austria, on the infamous Hahnenkamm mountain.
       
       Swiss sensation Didier Defago was victorious on the Streif in 2009, 
       so the Austrian contingent, led by 2006 winner Michael Walchhofer, 
       have an added incentive to strike back this time.
       
       Meanwhile, with the Winter Olympics edging ever closer, Ed is 
       tracking the progress of Nicola Minichiello and Gillian Cooke, 
       Britain's golden girls from last year's bobsleigh world 
       championships, as well as sampling life on the World Cup tour with 
       British snowboarder Zoe Gillings.
