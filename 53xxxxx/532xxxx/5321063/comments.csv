,shuichinz,2010-02-01T22:38Z,hi this album is awsome... thank you BT and dont forget to actually buy the album hes a good dude and deserves it :) im only download cause it hasnt shipped yet
,FLG_0XiDE,2010-02-03T06:05Z,shuichinz I completely agree. Preordered my copy but can't wait any longer. BT is a good dude and deserves our support for such an amazing piece of work. Even if you dont buy the album just grab a few of his other songs off iTunes; they are well worth it. Thanks for the upload =)

,shuichinz,2010-02-03T23:51Z,"^

totally wrong love his lyrics ever since he started writing and singing i think hes moving in the direction he wants not the direction people want from him and i like that, hes no longer contrainted by the club genre and hes in league all on his own.

Thanks for this brian and keep up the good work man one day ul come to newzealand huh :)"
,kevolito,2010-02-05T10:23Z,"Eh... I don't know. Movement in Still Life (UK version) was in a league of its own. This just seems like dance music with a BT touch. Some of the tracks did grow on me though, like Suddenly and Always. 

I'm honestly considering not buying this (it would make this a first for BT's albums). On one hand, I'm not too impressed. On the other, it's only like $10 and he still ranks in my top 10 favorite artists for nearly everything else he's done."
,DJDestruction,2010-08-10T07:43Z,"I'm sorry all these ppl don't like it. I have followed BT for over 15 yeas, had numerous personal contact with him and respect all that he puts into his music. I love the fact that his music is constantly evolving and growing as he grows and evolves. People do not stay the same and good music should not stay the same. Go BT! I buy every album and own every record. Even the white labels. "
