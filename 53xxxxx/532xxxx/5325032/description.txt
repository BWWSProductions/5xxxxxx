Murder drama/mystery with night-club-owning gangsters, heart-broken alcoholism, and the obligatory femme fatale and good-girl.

In noirs, musicians are often sweaty, horn-blowing black men, for example D.O.A 1950:

But in the genre, piano seems to be an instrument that white men might also play, as in this movie. For another piano-player starring role, see Detour:

Dan Duryea also plays in Too Late For Tears, a movie I like much more than this one:
