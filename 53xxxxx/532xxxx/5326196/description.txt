Plastic Made Sofa first release


**Plastic Made Sofa**


Indie rock band from Italy, around since 2008.
Their sound is an alternative mix of modern and classic rock, full of British and American influences. The band astonishes with its ability to move between hard, driving rock songs and melodic ballads, shifting from the cutting distortion of electric guitars to a refined acoustic sound. 
In 2009 they recorded their first EP, thanks to which they found a place in the underground (alternative) scene in Milan, where 'Smoking Kills Records', an independent label, discovered them and decided on a collaboration with them.
At the moment the band is recording their first album, due out in April, 2010, and they are planning a summer tour.
