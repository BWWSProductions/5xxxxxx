[V],kentucky-kid,2010-02-02T02:08Z,"Of course, it's a patch. Expect false positives from AV companies. =)"
,rocketero,2010-02-02T06:05Z,"I'll give it a try. I'm  not a hulu fanatic but I like some TV series from there and would like to have one or two chapters of the ABC's series ""Lost"""
,beezug,2010-02-08T18:31Z,"Patch fails for me too - ""A referral was returned from the server"""
,arcadi_tepes,2010-02-10T20:21Z,"patch does not seem to run on 64bit os (at least not win7 with any kind of compatibility mode).  runs fine on 32bit win7.  probably run fine on any 32bit os.  

workaround-use a second comp or a virtual machine to install and patch, and copy patched exe to the 64bit machine you wanted to use in the first place. worked for me (win7 32bit installed and patched, copied to second comp with win7 64bit)."
,lostrodents,2010-03-19T13:23Z,"I have downloaded it, but can't get it to work. I have Vista. Could someone go slowly through the steps for a newbie like me? Thanks if you can."
,Mercury8,2010-03-25T07:16Z,"Contains the spoolsvc.exe virus, which allows remote access to your computer. -Not- a false positive. Just a trojan virus."
,Ruby1,2010-05-23T17:05Z,"Is it a full version or trial version? The patch seem to be ok for me no viruses detected. However, the program itself seems to be only detecting commercials, not videos themselves :( I used the trial version for a short time and I was able to download a couple of videos from the CBS site. Now it seems finding only commercials. Am I doing something wrong??"
,Erik_O,2010-12-05T00:20Z,"No virus/malware, but can't make this program to work. Patch works, but the program don't detect any streams."
,jojjer134,2011-01-13T22:02Z,"it works with win7 32 bit
follow the instuctions.
rightclick on patch.exe choose properties. Compability run as windows vista and run as administrator"
,rocketero,2011-03-13T11:16Z,"too many false positives for me to trust this program. and as someone point out, a trojan is not a laugh matter."
,Twizted1,2011-03-24T09:16Z,"For those who want to know..

The patch DOES NOT work with version 8.9.9.3

** I did not test this patch with the version provided
within the torrent.. am on the search for a patch that
works with version 8.9.9.3"
,alllvalio,2012-05-24T06:11Z,"Waste of time. When I run it after the patch+register, the software crashes(freeze) when I play a video, and ain't able to do nothing."
