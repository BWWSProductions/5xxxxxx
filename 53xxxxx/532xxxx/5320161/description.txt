This is the story of 1970s African-American action legend Black Dynamite. The Man killed his brother, pumped heroin into local orphanages, and flooded the ghetto with adulterated malt liquor. Black Dynamite was the one hero willing to fight The Man all the way from the blood-soaked city streets to the hallowed halls of the Honky House. Black Dynamite is directed by Scott Sanders and co-written by White, Sanders, and Byron Minns, who also co-star. The look of the film is a retro homage to all of the blaxploitation movies of the seventies, but unlike Grindhouse (Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s exploitation homage) Black Dynamite does not employ â€œfake scratches or digitally generated retro deteriorationâ€, according to director Scott Sanders. The cinematographer Shawn Maurer tested a Super 16 Color Reversal Kodak film stock to get the high contrast and saturated look for the movie. The filmmakers supplemented their shoot with the use of period stock footage from several blaxploitation films and from Sony Pictures Stock Footage. The film has been discussed with approval on numerous movie-related websites.
