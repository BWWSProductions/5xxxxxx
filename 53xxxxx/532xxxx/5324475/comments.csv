I'm speaking on behalf of 20-40 as I know your request will annoy him as it means you haven't read earlier comments (last 2-3 weeks).
You are not the first to ask for Avatar and 20-40 has said that he will NOT release a copy of this until it is available as a BRRip or DVDRip.

@20-40: Sorry for speaking out of turn but I thought I would as your decision was a good one. I can't imagine any 'screener' of this movie will do it justice.

If you've changed your mind then my apologies to both of you.

For sure, when BluRay or DVD comes out. I even can consider of doing announced DVDSCR, but it will be last H264 Avatar ever. What's gonna be, lets wait and see. (Rhyme, LOL)

@FSallATP: Thank-god, someone noticed that too. Funny, 'cause I wrote about ""byte-thrashers"" while ago, it is The mother of our problems and - we must do somethin' about and inform the people.

@Jon:
Thanks...and exactly that...

@zmacdaddy8:
How 'bout ""Strikeforce Miami 2010 720p HDTV x264-KYR 
Size: 4.4GB""

Speaking of ridiculous file-sizes, people do not want to know what I must download for input.
Regarding that this is live event I am sure that quality wont be good, BUT also; this is martial arts event, a type of show I never have done before, VERY long one and even as my small H264 would be TWO MOVIES in size(I guess 600-700MB), too big and therefore not attractive to many people.
Unfortunately, because all of that - I must say no.

zmacdaddy8 , sadly I must say No, but next request is for sure, on me, just - please, choose what's gonna be little differently."
