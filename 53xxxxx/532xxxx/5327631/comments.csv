,mspakousky,2010-02-06T02:00Z,"I have only watched Empire from this torrent.

I know it's been a few years since I've seen this movie, but I'm pretty sure I have it memorized from the hundreds of times I watched these things when  I was younger.  

Is it just me, or does it seem that the play speed of this torrent is just a little faster than it should be.  The voices are all a little high-pitched and rushed...or I'm just senile.  "
