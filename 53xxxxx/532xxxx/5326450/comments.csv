,mx_phreek,2010-02-02T20:31Z,"Any idea when the 450's will be up.  Or anyone know were i can find a sd 450 torrent, would rather have the hd version but it killing me not being able to surf site's in case i see race results"
,andycktm,2010-02-02T20:54Z,"Hate to say this but as nick is having trouble with 450s,the other torrent on here is good just needs unzipping(get winrar and double click the last R file).
This file will not play on my usb dvd player (60fps) i think 30 fps is easy enough nick. Cheers for the 250's."
,baajes,2010-02-02T21:01Z,"dude :), i fucking love the hd. I hooked it up to the TV and played like a charm. Any news yet on the 450's i'm hooked to hd now, can't go back :D!"
,jeffro30,2010-02-02T21:38Z,"I'm using VLC as always, but I noticed on this HD video  a ""pixel crawl"", does anybody know why is this happening ?????? "
,projekttm,2010-02-03T10:22Z,thanks for sharing :-)
,brownie82,2010-02-05T12:52Z,"Slicknick I am an absolute fan of your stuff. The only thing i'm not sure of is these HD files. I usually stream from my PC to 360 and all is good. But this big file seems to slow at streaming. Dont get me wrong I'm not complaining, just wondering if it were possible to the SD as you were?? Worst case i burn it to disc. 

Thanx for all you from Aus, cant wait for the Outdoors..."
