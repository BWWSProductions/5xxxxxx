,hiddendragon,2010-02-02T17:27Z,"This is NTSC USA,just downloaded and checked in regionfrii.Have no idea if wii brickblocker is enough to make it work ok on PAL console as i have'nt burnt and tested yet."
,bundoodle,2010-02-03T22:34Z,"thx gamerguuy for the upload , mega fast download . BUT .....& it's a big but , the game is total crap . it plays like a shite version of conflict desert storm only much much worse with jumpy frame rate and shoddy looking graphics . if anyone had the misfortune of downloading skyscraper for the wii , you would understand when i say that the A.I on this game reminds me of that game . .........just played abit more just to make sure & it's not total crap .........it's just crap . looks like there is a heatwave on the screen all the time due to the bad frame rate . disapointing"
,bundoodle,2010-02-03T22:43Z,"forgot to add , played on Gecko 1.9 & neogamma r8 beta 15 on a 4.1 PAL wii"
,maxigawa,2010-02-04T10:14Z,"hells bells dude whats with the green stripe across the bottom of screen 4"" thick??????? and why is it stuttery. and no its nothing to do with me at my end before you ask."
,maxigawa,2010-02-04T10:20Z,ok i apologise the green stripe is not there with neo gamma.but the game is slow to load and jumpy
