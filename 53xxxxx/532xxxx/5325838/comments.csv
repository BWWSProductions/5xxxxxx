thanks EZTV =) 


leechers--- go die in a fire "
,Xander_Dean_Macio,2010-02-01T13:27Z,"tfizz.... not all of us have tonnes of free space we can dedicate to seeding every torrent we download..... we have personal lives so our hard drives are filled with pictures, home movies, correspondence and work related material..... unlike you theres more to our lives than just torrents.... some of us may very well be scumbags and faggots but thats another thing altogether..  you on the other hand are pathetic ... because anybody who cant fill the extra 20-60 mins it takes to download with fewer seeds must really have nothing better going on in their lives... and for that you have my pity.. whether you want it or not"
,TKOG13,2010-02-01T18:37Z,"I usually download at 1mb/second, im connected to 300 seeds and am downloading at less then 10kb/s wtf?"
,iwantmyblanket,2010-02-01T18:46Z,"Wow this is seriously awesome. It just aired earlier and the torrent is out already? Kudos to you eztv, and thanks for the upload. Will seed for at least a week after downloaded."
,.x7x.,2010-02-01T20:47Z,"Is S03E06 the last one/newest one right now?
I mean, is it some S03E07+???"
,Crazy Bastard,2010-02-01T20:58Z,"@ .x7x.

yes, it's the newest one right now! ep.7 will be out next monday :)"
,FlamingFuzzbal,2010-02-01T21:12Z,"Thanks again EZTV. Great Upload

@ tfizz

Man I hope you don't start posting on everyone of EZTV's ""Chuck"" torrents. Everyone on ThePirateBay does not want ro hear you whinge and moan about how bad your download is. Chances are if it's bad for you, it's bad for everyone else. Also i'm willing to place a wager that you don't even seed 1:1, everyone has said it to you before and i'll sum it up for you.

(Keep in mind these are just from other torrent pages of people who don't like YOU)
""OMG This is free. How can people complain about something free.""

""tfizz dont be a jew n get rapidshar3..... u impatient shitcunt""

""I can't believe these idiots actually complain, get a life""

""tfizz How old are you? Regardless ... Grow up""

""oh and if you didn't catch on tfizz. Go fuck yourself."""

,Pinnemand,2010-02-03T01:54Z,"Just wanted to say thank you eztv, allways top quality and early out with the episodes!!

You are one of the guys who makes this place a great place to be! :)

Keep up the good work!"
,kastrater,2010-02-04T15:51Z,"tfizz i apreciate it that u seed, i on the other hand live in a country where u pay, if converted, about $20us to downlad a gig if over 5gb a month is dl, this episode is costing me about $5 if i upload still another $5 so if i this with every thing i will  pay about $100 a month so maybe im a scumbag for not wanting to pay $100.. or maybe ur an ungratefull son of a bitch not wanting to w8 20-60min for a episode u decide.."
,nouda333,2010-02-05T16:18Z,thaanxx alot 
,TKOG13,2010-02-09T01:32Z,when is episode 7 coming?
,Simielli,2010-03-01T00:36Z,"Seriously? ""I don't have time to seed my FREE FUKKEN DOWNLOAD""? Fuck you all leechers, you're all killing the P2P community. I hope you get aids. No, just kidding. But you suck, seriously. I'll seed for the great justice."
,Chaos545,2010-03-04T21:41Z,"Wow I can't believe the audacity of some of you leeching asshats. With the exception of kastrater who claims he has to pay, which maybe he does in which case I understand. But for the rest of you jumping on tfizz YOU are the assholes. You are bitching about him saying that he is a douche for not wanting to wait an extra 20-60 minutes because of no seeding. Thank god not all of us in the P2P community think like u selfish assholes because if we did there wouldn't be any torrents for you to dl and I don't remember who made the argument about hard drive space but that is pathetic. You had the hard drive space to download it just store it for like a week before you delete it after watching it because uploading doesn't take up hard drive space. Although if you are so retarded as to not understand how this P2P stuff works, WITHOUT SEEDERS NOBODY DL'S ANYTHING! Not even you selfish pricks. I am with tfizz all you leechers who can't at least seed a 1:1 ratio go die in a fire, or at the very least play in traffic. Have a nice day! :-)"
,colinb74,2010-06-13T11:36Z,Thanks eztv!! Damn I am sick of reading tfizz comments on eztv's torrents. This child needs to be banned. Who agrees?
