,earl4you,2010-02-25T08:15Z,This does not work. It got corrupted when it got compressed. You will download 17 of the same file
,nycka,2010-04-26T00:38Z,"just downloaded, unzipped and installing now!
No complaints so far!!!
thank you!"
,tufgong,2010-06-09T00:04Z,"@earl4you  - how long you been around man????  It's a great way to compress files, just open up the .r00 or whatever and it unrars all of them at once.  Come on Man, get with the Mother fucking Program!!!!!!!"
