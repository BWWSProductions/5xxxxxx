,MemoryWipe,2010-02-02T09:59Z,"@ yellowgowild : You come to a torrent site to downlad a show and then dis it? you sought it out... obviously its still appealing in some way, stoopid... not stockholm syndrome... more like bored asshole syndrome. you're an idiot. dont take the time and effort to DL if you dont like it, and why dis the show on the link page? just to get attentention? i suspect so, because who else would read your comment, but the people who actually enjoy this show? youre cynicisim is tiresom and juvenile. next time a comment like that comes to mind, hold your breath and count to a million ;)"
