,Master2873,2011-10-10T20:38Z,"I can tell you right now that these videos are not compatible for streaming on the Xbox 360. But there is a program you can get called Handbreak. The down side to it is you will have to Re-encode the video. But Handbreak also supports the ability to hardcode subs in the video if you wish. the only thing I can see so far that makes these Incompatible for the 360 is the Audio tracks. This should be your outcome if you wish to Re-encode, or for the Uploader, if you wish to upload a separate version for consoles.

The Xbox 360 console supports the following for H.264:

    * File extensions: .mp4, .m4v, mp4v, .mov, .avi
