[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2011-06-28T11:15Z,"incredible torrent.

i have seen the Spike HDTV 720p rips but they contain the Spike watermark and commercials.

i am starting the download right now.
this will take me a few days.

But i can promise you, i will upload 100GB.

well worth it~!

Thank you NLUPPER, the amount of bandwidth and time you have shared is incredible."
[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2011-06-29T16:38Z,"hey .. we need seeds here..

i've uploaded 68GB in 2 days and i've downloaded 10.1 GB (30%).

we need some of the seeds to seed more than 5KB.

if everyone seeds.. we all benefit."
[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2011-06-29T19:38Z,"F.Y.I

there are 6 seeds.
1 is seeding at 5kb.
the other 6 just sit there at 0.

no one is seeding.

everyone is just sharing what they have, most is stuck at 40 - 50%.

if you are considering downloading this, dont waste your time. 

Usually if i seed like hell, people usually seed back. But this torrent, it's not the case.

my ratio is over 2:1 and im stuck at 30%. lol"
