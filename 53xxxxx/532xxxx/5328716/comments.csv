,sriraama,2010-02-20T08:16Z,there seems to be a delay in A/V... is there a fix!
,nemozeen,2010-04-06T04:00Z,BIG SYNC DELAY!!!
,chaosheritage,2010-04-27T22:36Z,"Good cut.  Audio sync is bang on for me..  Compression artefacting is noticable on monitor fullscreen, should be fine on normal TV tho."
,trilliouk,2010-05-03T03:35Z,"The video/audio tracks are out of sync.
+5.700 is the amount to ajust by in VLC
I dont think you can adjust this with Windows MP

(In VLC open the tools tab at the top of the screen and select Syncronisation.)

Hope this helps!"
,hurlhurl,2010-05-19T20:09Z,Ty trilliouk. Great help :)
,iamcims,2010-09-20T04:32Z,"this rip is trash. the quality is not great. and there is a watermark at the beginning. I don't really care who uploaded this movie. sure i could delay the audio to make it match up better. but why even bother. ill find a rip from someone who knows what they are doing.

this torrent should be deleted."
,Fullmetal2112,2010-11-14T21:16Z,I had the same problem with the A/V delay. But when I played the file in Windows media player everything worked fine. Good quaility too.
