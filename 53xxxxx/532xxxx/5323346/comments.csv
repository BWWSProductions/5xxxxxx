Anyway, i'm pretty sure soon this will be the number 1 torrent for those fakers(trojan uploaders) to upload. So, if you come across any of it, pls report it here:

,hannibal0,2010-02-01T17:58Z,"works great and updates no problem, still say avast is one of the best security programs out there.

just hopes it last for the year as it should. :-)"
,ExTRM,2010-02-01T18:14Z,"Thanks for UL.
I downloaded and installed Internet Security, but when i tried to install Anti virus it said its already installed.
It should be two different programs? 
Peace."
,ExTRM,2010-02-01T18:16Z,"btw downlaoding Robbinghoods AV now....but thought this was both, cus it has two exes in the DLed folder."
[V],kentucky-kid,2010-02-01T20:17Z,"** THIS CONTAINS TWO DIFFERENT FILES. ONE IS AVAST ANTIVIRUS ALONE, WHEREAS THE OTHER IS THE AVAST INTERNET SECURITY ALONE**

@ExTRM
Pls don't install both, only install either one of it. Basically the internet security comes with the firewall, thereas the antivirus alone don't. So, make your choice on which one to install. :)

,hannibal0,2010-02-07T20:16Z,"before installing make sure you remove any exiting avast security completely first,

,hannibal0,2010-02-07T20:17Z,Also make sure you don't update the program itself!! just the virus definitions.

So: Include a key generator, or the ENTIRE torrent is WORTHLESS."
