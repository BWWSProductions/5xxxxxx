A short film directed by Peter Mullan



Author: Mondo_Giallo from Edinburgh, Scotland

Vincent lives in a Glasgow close. He has newly become a father. His neighbour makes a highly derogatory remark about his daughter. Vincent doesn't like it. Vincent gets mad. Vincent goes to get his hammer. In fact, Vincent doesn't have much time for any of the neighbours in his insect-infested close. He wants to wash the close of it's scum. And today is the day that the close shall be cleaned. After all Vincent has a new baby. And it would be wrong to bring her into a world of deviants, cheats and layabouts. And Vincent's got a hammer.

Peter Mullan's short feature can best be described as Taxi Driver meets Eraserhead in a Glasgow tenement. A short, sharp blow to the head.
