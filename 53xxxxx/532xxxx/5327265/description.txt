This torrent contains all six episodes of Ali G's show on Channel Four, before he did those two seasons on HBO. Also contains three video releases with extras from the Ch. 4 show plus even earlier Ali G stuff from the Eleven O'clock Show. 

As far as I can tell none of these have been released in the United States. I have no idea why; this stuff is hilarious. Enjoy.
