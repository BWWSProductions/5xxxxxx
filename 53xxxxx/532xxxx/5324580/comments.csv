,donRauno,2010-01-31T22:15Z,is it real?
,XoLWoX,2010-01-31T22:23Z,Yes Look At The ScreenShots :D
,TheAwesome2012,2010-01-31T22:26Z,In before Knock...
,TheAwesome2012,2010-01-31T22:28Z,Plus some other releases are labeling this as a Telecine instead of a DvD Screener.
,TheAwesome2012,2010-01-31T23:11Z,Yup definitely labeled as a Telecine on COUNTLESS scene websites so not only is this probably stolen it is a stolen source mislabeled LOL Good to see you done your homework again and trying to release this to be one of the heroes being first on the scene.
[T],jerry7_57,2010-01-31T23:17Z,"@TheAwesome2012
In your hast to criticize you failed to do your own homework because this screener has been out since early this morning.  "
,TheAwesome2012,2010-01-31T23:29Z,"Mislabeled Telecine on countless websites dude. Check the cigarette burn that someone posted on Demonoid you don't get them on DvD Screeners only on Telecines. Unless a DvD Screener were released on both days i'm gonna stick by my original statement.
"
,RIggsta,2010-02-01T00:08Z,SCREENER!
,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-01T00:33Z,"Thank you, Knock."
,XoLWoX,2010-02-01T00:43Z,SCREENER!
[T],jerry7_57,2010-02-01T00:53Z,"The one I got was FLAWL3SS and if it was a TC then it fooled me. It did have line audio but it was in syc, unlike the MENTiON version."
[T],Emery2010,2010-02-01T00:55Z,"wow u really havent any brains at all
there is no ""SCREENER"" out
this is a TC just ask the other release
groups who released this as a TC...
Even IMAGiNE said the DVDSCREENERS out arent real
DVDSCREENERS but TC's learn how to read ok..."
[T],Emery2010,2010-02-01T00:59Z,also the source flaw3ss used was the mention dvdscreener which isnt a screener but a TC...
[T],Emery2010,2010-02-01T01:01Z,also if u had any idea and read up on this its a TC.... DVDSCREENERS have water marks this does not...so its there for not a dvdscreener...
,XoLWoX,2010-02-01T01:14Z,"not all dvdscr's have watermarks dumbass if YOU were smart you would know that

P.S try not to triple or double post in comments retard"
,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-01T01:14Z,"Three people have proved it's a Telecine and he is still ranting in caps that is a screener.

I take it these two V.I.P's are delusional? Didn't think so. You merely stole someone elses source AGAIN and you got found out again.

And before you start yes nearly everyone else posted it labeled as a screener before correcting themselves."
[T],jerry7_57,2010-02-01T01:36Z,"I too correct myself, after reviewing the FLAWL3SS copy that I have, it is a TC "
[T],Emery2010,2010-02-01T03:37Z,"lmao LW u are the dumbass who cant read up on shit.... this is clearly a TC...at least i know my sources unlike you, and are you questioning someone whos encoded with popular release groups such as vision and voltage? better not be, because i have ur IP and all that, so enjoy ur stay....better be nice to me bitch"
[T],Emery2010,2010-02-01T03:38Z,"and once again you put wrong release date
the movie was filmed and released in 2009...
there for u put 2009..."
,LH-oswald,2010-02-01T09:07Z,"great copy and in sync thanks XoLWoX

,heavydiamond,2010-02-01T17:40Z,"much thanx but this is a tele sync /no brainer #

,XoLWoX,2010-02-01T21:42Z,wow emery posting on all my torrents now just cause i said somthing about noir ---- go with noir and have his babies 
,funkyfifer,2010-02-01T23:12Z,"OMG you guys sound like a right bunch of little bitches!

TC.... DVD SCREENERS, Telecine, screener, dvdscr's,  all that went right over the top of my head!

All most of us in here want to know is whether or not this particular torrent is any good!

Is it really about 'trying to release this to be one of the heroes being first on the scene'? 
HEROES? A bit delusional do you not think?

Nobody actually mentions anything about the quality, not once!

I appreciate and admire uploaders, but some people are getting carried away, we r talking about illegal rips (or wotever) yet EMERY2010 is name dropping all over the place, (slightly threatening)
 KNOCKX2 is practically stalking LOLWOX, admitting that he scans other up-loaders files to see if they actually broke the sweat and god help them if he suspects! (yet, has never uploaded any movie torrentts lol)
THEAWESOME2012 actually says 'so not only is this probably stolen it is a stolen source mislabelled!' 
So what is the issue again?
Stolen torrents, stolen from stolen torrents, stolen from the movie makers (somewhere down the line) HAHA

The way I see it is if there are 2 people with the same (or similar) torrent on offer, and 400 people want it, is it not better if two people are offering it?
Please tell me if I am missing something!
Please, LOLWOX if you are doing whatever then, well first, thanks for taking time to do it I think u rock, but PLEASE can u just admit it if they are re uploaded torrents and say thanks to whoever, cos I think if u r looking for fame & glory, u choose the wrong path!   

And one very lovely uploader, mentioned few times by BLOODY KNOCK, even says 'Love for All and Sharing is the first step to solving all the problems of humanity, 
'No credit for me...credit to EVERYONE for sharing' and 'credit Noir BIG TIME & to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone!
 This person is a huge up-loader yet he never once mentions anyone copying or whatever!
So, basically, get a grip, if u want to comment on the quality of the film, bash on, cos to tell you the truth, when I get up tomorrow I will probably not even remember any of the names I just quoted! 
Is there not a forum on here for comments like these?
Anyone ever visited the forums?
So this movie GOOD or BAD? Cos if I see anything else its just like blah blah blah to me!
HEROES hehe sorry"
,XoLWoX,2010-02-02T00:10Z,lol that was alot the read but well put together :D
,heavydiamond,2010-02-02T04:18Z,i have just finished watching this release . very good .never missed abit  above average movie blade 1/2 without the action and soundtrack.  much blessing upon u wolwox
,40_Thieves,2010-02-02T16:38Z,"I couldn't give a shit what it is. Anyone who bitches about getting something for nothing is an ungrateful parasite. Fuck em XoLWoX, keep up the good work."
,moviebuff87,2010-02-03T02:30Z,IS there a single copy out there that is actually in sync.  This one is still out of sync by .8 seconds. BOOOO
,u2r1,2010-02-03T17:21Z,just 8  secs omy god
