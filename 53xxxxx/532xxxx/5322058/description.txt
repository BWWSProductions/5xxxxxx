Killing for Sport: Inside the Minds of Serial Killers
Phoenix Books | 205 pages | 2008 | ISBN: 1597775754 | PDF

Killing for Sport is the most valuable insight into the minds of serial killers you'll ever read. While other profilers tend to conceal the clear facts behind complex technical language and psychobabble, Pat Brown actually tells it like it is. Killing for Sport will intrigue you with its honest portrayal of the predator-next-door, how he hunts for him victims, why he likes to torture them, where he tends to stash their bodies, and more. Movies such as Silence of the Lambs, Seven, American Psycho and many others have created myths about serial killers that need to be dispelled: If you think that most serial killers are eccentric, white, male intellectuals, then you had better read Killing for Sport to learn the truth. The more our society is informed about these predators and what really goes on in their minds, the more equipped we will be to protect ourselves from them. With the same dark wit that gets people who work with the criminally insane through their workday, Brown speaks frankly about the monsters among us who kill for sport.
