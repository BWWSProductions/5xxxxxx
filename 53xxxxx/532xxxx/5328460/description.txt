Harpsichord played by Ivor Boulton

Mysteriously, long after his death, there was discovered
among Casanova's papers a sketch, in his own hand, for a
redrafted scene from Mozart's opera 'Don Giovani'.

This play dramatises chunks of Casanova's memoirs to set
the fancy that Casanova wrote the libretto for Don Giovanni
from personal experience.

Very funny it is too.
