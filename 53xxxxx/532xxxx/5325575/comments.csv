All entries are in Alphabetical Order.  5.306 Entries.  Each on its own page (unless entry is too long to fit on a single page).

The pdf's pages however, are NOT numbered in order.  There are only 10(?) pages (the # on the Lower-Right corner of each page)...and those are NOT in order from front to back.  All Photos in the book are B/W."
