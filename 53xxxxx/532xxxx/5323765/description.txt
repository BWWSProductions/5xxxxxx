Award winning play by Kwame Kwei-Armah which received
rave reviews at the National Theatre in 2003. Ex-boxer
Deli runs a cafe in Hackney. Keeping his son safe, his
business alive and staying out of trouble is a full time
job in East London's notorious Murder Mile.
Unquote

Lively, and not at all preachy. The first play to get West
Indians along to the National Theatre in large numbers.
