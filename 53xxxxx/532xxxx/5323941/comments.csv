,sistromo,2010-01-31T18:21Z,Different and obscure indeed! Terrific stuff! Thanks.
,twistles,2010-01-31T19:10Z,"Hi sistromo.  Glad you're liking this.

The CD was very much a lucky-dip for me.  When I purchased it, it was wrapped up in cellophane, and the outside of the box bears the title, and nothing else!  I had no idea what I was paying for, beyond some choral music in Icelandic.  

I hesitated a bit, but decided to go for it.  Rather glad I did, as a few of these tracks are great (for me, 11 for its pretty tune, and the mass, which reminds me of some of Rubbra, particularly)  :)"
,sigurros999,2010-01-31T23:26Z,This looks wonderful...any chance of it going up in mp3?
,twistles,2010-02-01T00:10Z,"Mmmh.  Why do you need MP3 specifically?  OGG aoTuV/Vorbis is a better format than MP3 for so many reasons and poses no issues for any desktop systems.  Presumably you want MP3 for a portable device? But OGG is supported by many portable players ...  

Failing that, you could transcode this to 128kbs quality MP3 easily, which is generally sufficient for portable use (the OGG files, while lossy, are transparent at q6, and this also isn't particularly complex music, so a transcoded MP3 will be of reasonable quality).  

I could upload an MP3 version, I suppose.  But do give me a good reason why uploading this in MP3 will be better than me using that bandwidth to upload something else that is new :)  Perhaps I've missed something about the OGG format - is it not popular with people?

Not overly keen on duplicates, as it's a constant battle against leechers, and I'm maxed 24/7 trying to keep stuff alive as-is. 

Also, the link above to the label's site offers a (purchased) DRM-free MP3 download option, if you're desperate ^^"

,acorn2oaks,2010-06-24T11:11Z,"This looks really interesting and I would love to listen to it!  Somebody please seed.  Thanks in anticipation, and many thanks to twistle for some fantastic music."
,twistles,2010-06-25T02:18Z,"Hi acorn.  I've been away a few weeks, but return Sunday.  If you can wait until then, will seed when I get back. :)"
,acorn2oaks,2010-07-13T14:58Z,"Hi twistle.  I\'ve just found your post after having given up a while back. A lucky re-visit! After a quick dl I\'m listening to some really lovely \'different and obscure\' music. Many, many thanks.n(I\'m just starting to learn about this torrent stuff and realise patience is required!  Been stuck for ages with Ravel\'s trio sonates and Buxtehude\'s membra Jesu nostri.  When I\'ve got the courrage I\'ll have a go at sharing some of our music.)"
