,martronn,2010-02-01T07:56Z,Try Microsoft Flight simulator X insted! way more realism. ;-)
,icebows25,2010-05-11T23:50Z,"for all downloaders I will be posting games, apps, video, music, and apps.
by the way,the flight simulator that im posting will work great. All of my apps will work.
Also I will test out the game that I posted on my 
other pc to make sure everything works.
The next flight simulator x will be posted on the date below:

5/12/10
or
5/13/10"
,pissedamerican,2010-05-24T11:06Z,X-Plane is and always has been the MOST accurate flight Sim. Written by an Aeronautical engineer and Pilot and Apporoved by the FAA. Microsoft FSX is a GAME Written by a Game studio AND no longer in production!   while X-plane is still going strong period end of story....
,pi_loto,2010-07-21T17:36Z,"pissedamerican, get your facts straight... Xplane is the biggest piece of crap I have purchased. I even request my money back and they refused.
Flight simulator has never been a game!, It was not developed by game studios, that didn't exist.

It was develop by Bruce Artwick as THE FIRST CONSUMER  FLIGHT SIMULATOR DEVELOPER. not by Microsft. Bruce founded Sublogic, later BAO LTD, created the first satellite sceneries for FS, (there was no pc that could run it full at the time). Bruce was one of the first to use rastrer graphics for a simulation. Join Microsoft (as partners) and produced the 3rd version (retaining the rights), the product didn't belong to Microsoft. Microsoft then aquired BAO and the rights to the SIMULATION.  Bruce also created the Space SIMULATION. This started in the 70's before xplane existed. FS was certified by the FAA BEFORE XPLANE. Used by the Navy and Air Force. Then and only then Microsoft created a dept. called Games Studios and transfer the Simulator to that dept. Not the Game. Is sad that a lot of newbies think that this is a game...MIcrosoft as of May 2010 is manufacturing a WHOLE new batch of FSX DVD's because they run out of media for the stores. Fs is the most realistic simulator in the market. I am a REAL pilot with hundred of flying time hours. Microsoft open the code when realesd the SDK's. Microsoft can close their doors today. That doesn' affect FS, The biggest support for FS IS THE COMMUNITY AND VENDORS, with planes certified by REAL CAPTAINS.  ARianne 737 is the ONLY 737 certified by BOIENG...not xplane Microsoft is not needed!... now this is really the end of story!!!"
,pi_loto,2010-07-21T17:45Z,"And I forgot also PMDG Boeings! Thats how I ended here trying to find a decent plane to try in Xplane. So flying xplane in MARS! is not a game? give me a break! oh and adjust your ground speed!, otherwise xplane takes forever to reach the runway!"
,tiu,2010-09-11T02:41Z,"Anything you can control with a $10 joystick is merely a game. FAA certified doesn't mean an FAA certified simulator, but an FAA certified trainer. FAA doesn't classify X-Plane or FSX as simulators. Simulators cost millions of dollars. Both X-Plane and FSX do their job well and serve their communities. X-Plane is just more advanced, and may need more technical configuration to feel the realism in FSX, an average windows gaming guy may not handle it. Once you get a hold of it, you can even feed X-Plane with real FDR data and it will fly the plane accordingly, done at least once by National Transportation Safety Board to investigate a real plane crash. Something you can't even imagine doing with FSX due to its nature of implementing flight dynamics."
,pissedamerican,2011-03-02T16:22Z,"pi_loto  I haven't been back this way in quite a while. In response to your flame of a post I will say this.. I am also a Pilot and an aircraft designer. So no points to you there. I am also a member in good standing with EAA and AMA. And finally I have been invovled in the computer industry for well over 30 years and remember 
Bruce very well. Your are correct he wrote a flight sim back in the appleII days and I used to run it. before him we ran IFR sims on paper punch DECPDP 11-08s so again your not winning any points there either. Sub logic was purchased by Gates because it was the first real graphical ""game"" as you your self pointed out and microsoft wanted to branch into the gaming market back in the 80's that sim by the way was loaded into the pc on a 300 baud cassete tape. 

In spite of efforts by an over zealous flight sim community Microsft REFUSED to go for FAA apporoval or market the sim as such for LEGAL liability reasons. and quite frankly the FS could not meet the srtingent requirements for a true SIMULATION software package. X-plane has and CONTINUES to meet those requirements. and does so in multiple countries. Remember Microsoft is driven by profits and when FS was no longer profitable they canned it. The only thing MS FS had going for it over X-plane was the scenery period. If you dont agree then try flying high alpha low airspeed acrobatics with both programs and see which one holds up. FS was fine for straght and level but the table driven flight models quickly broke down and fell apart near zero airspeed as in torque rolls and had a hard enough time trying to do Snaps. If you flew virtual airlines FS was fine,  but if you fly Virtual AIRCRAFT then X-plane was and still is the way to go. until something better comes along.  Oh and by the way the military uses X-plane as does NASA, scaled composites JAL and a host of other companies around the world. and finally X-plane is what the NTSB uses when directly plugging in black box data to recreate graphically an aircraft's last flight.

Could you guys at the Bay remove the 3 Dupe posts please 

Thank You"

,Emplehod,2012-06-24T19:05Z,I remember Bruce. He was a friend of my brother and used to come over to his apartment in LA. They worked at Hughes Aircraft. All I remember of FS was trying to get it to load on a Commodore 64 with that horribly slow drive :)
