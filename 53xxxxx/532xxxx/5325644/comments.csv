,Dharhan,2010-02-01T09:22Z,What exactly is it?
,ronibob,2010-02-01T10:10Z,I think its the starTrek voyager one where captain jayneway has that special shuttle and she travels back in time to kill the borg i couldnt be hundred percent sure but thats what i think it could be.
,raider56,2010-02-01T10:30Z,"If you want to know what it is, why not just Google it? Or go to You_tube and type in Borg War Movie Final. One clue is that it says ""Fanfilm"", don't you think?"

,ronibob,2010-02-01T20:33Z,"Anyway i,m gona download it and see for myself then i will comment on it."

,primalclaws1974,2010-03-01T18:19Z,This piece of garbage isn't worth your time. It looks like some 12-year-old made it on his computer. Tim Russ and Patrick Stewart must have needed a quick buck. INcredibly bad for Star Trek!
,born2b,2010-04-05T00:47Z,Tack men nej tack...

,B.Genaaid,2011-05-19T12:48Z,"you are a fan or not,... guess if you don't like it you're not.
to explain, the movie is made from game pictures and movements, they used the games like bridge commander and elite force, cut and pieced together, not bad if you see thrue the bad grafics.."
,OttifantSir2,2011-05-26T15:16Z,"This type of movie is made with a graphic engine called Machinima. Shitty graphics, severely limited actions of ""actors"" (A Star Wars movie I saw made of this had the ""actors"" running with raised lightsabers the ENTIRE movie, even when they weren't planning to use them), and usually, people making movies with this engine has spent far too little time on the script. I shan't say this is bad, but the limitations of the Machinima engine makes for poor movies IMO."
