Deep Forest is a musical group 

consisting of two French 

musicians, Michel Sanchez and 

Eric Mouquet. They compose a 

new kind of world music, 

sometimes called ethnic 

electronica, mixing ethnic with 

electronic sounds and dance beats 

or chillout beats. Their sound has 

been described as an 

"ethno-introspective ambient 

world music". They were 

nominated for a Grammy Award 

in 1993 for Best World Music 

Album, and in 1996 they won the 

Award for the album Boheme. 

The group also became World 

Music Awards Winner - French 

group with the highest 1995 world 

sales. Their albums have sold over 

10 million copies.

Boheme is the Grammy Award 

Winning (for Best World Music 

Album) second album of the 

French duo Deep Forest, released 

in 35 countries. It mainly sampled 

Eastern European gypsy songs 

(e.g. the Bohemians, hence the 

name of the album) with 

electronic music. Hit singles 

included "Marta's Song" 

(featuring MÃ¡rta SebestyÃ©n) and 

"Freedom Cry". The album 

became the duo's most successful 

one, selling over 4 million copies 

and receiving a number of 

Diamond, Platinum and Gold 

awards in 15 countries.

The song "Freedom Cry" has later 

caused controversy when it was 

revealed that the singer, KÃ¡roly 

"HuttyÃ¡n" RostÃ¡s, never received 

any monetary compensation from 

the song, and neither did his 

family after he died in 1986. His 

singing was archived by Claude 

Flagel, which was later sampled 

by Deep Forest. Flagel allegedly 

paid HuttyÃ¡n 1500 forints for the 

recording. The case was later 

documented in a movie entitled 

HuttyÃ¡n, released in 1996.
