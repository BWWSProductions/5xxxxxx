An out-of-control robot is inadvertently set loose in a small community, and a crack squad of soldiers are sent to hunt it down. Gradually, the members of the squad begin to suspect that some of them are robots.


Note: I haven't made this DVDRip, I barely found it myself somewhere else and now I want to share it. It's not a masterpiece of a movie, actually it's a typical 90's B movie but that's the whole point ;) Hard to find. I'll try to seed as much as I can but my upload speed isn't really impressive and I am doing lots of things with my connection, so bear with me. I'll be seeding over night mostly (my time is GMT+1).
