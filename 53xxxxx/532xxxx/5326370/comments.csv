,delvis203,2010-02-13T12:36Z,thanks for the upload...but how do we open the files
,Malkamar,2010-02-14T08:15Z,"They are just rar or zip files renamed for ease of opening them with a comic book reader. CBR is a rar, CBZ is a zip. If you googled the file extensions you would have found that out."
[T],Juan.Too,2010-02-15T06:15Z,"@ delvis203

Nearly all pirated comics you're going to find online are either cbz files or cbr files.  These are file extensions that are really only used for digital comics.

To open these files, you'll need a digital comics reader (like Malkamar already mentioned).
I would recommend using CDisplay.

You can download it from CNet here:

,TwNy,2010-02-23T13:21Z,"I have tried both comicrack and cdisplay but it does'nt work, it just says archive broken. What do i have to do to make it work?"
,just2chill42,2010-02-25T07:52Z,You rock Juan.Too!!
[T],Juan.Too,2010-02-26T23:23Z,"@ TwNy

All of the files in this torrent should work.
I've read them all personally.
Are you sure that the files were completely downloaded before you tried to open them?
If that's not the issue, I would suggest you just try to download them again. "
[M],SteRipper,2010-03-03T05:59Z,An Excellent Comic series. I can't wait for the movie !! :D
,lc3hawk,2010-03-25T21:03Z,Saw an early screening of the movie. It's a bit of a let down.
[T],Juan.Too,2010-03-29T00:57Z,"Well, I've read some pretty rave reviews on rottentomatoes.com, so I'm keeping my hopes up."
,somedude.1001,2010-04-10T05:56Z,".cbr and .cbz are actually .rar and .zip files.

If you dont like installing software (I dont), just rename and unpack and view the separated images."
,Treekodar,2010-04-16T00:20Z,"Just saw it in the cinema, it's freakin' amazing!"
,tebon,2010-04-18T08:07Z,FOR READING THIS DOWNLOAD SOFTWARE C DISPLAY>>>
,DudeOnFire,2010-04-18T17:30Z,Awesome! Is there going to be a book 2?
,Verlier,2010-04-19T10:20Z,"I just watched the movie AND read this comic, I must say the movie did a lot to make the characters more likable, but the story is pretty much the same.

It's really really good."
,Blue_Flames,2010-04-19T23:55Z,"DudeOnFire, Yeah IIRC Miller/Romita have said there's gonna be a second book, but beyond that there's no other details.

Maybe they'll get cracking on it now the series is finished and the films out."
,kabalizo,2010-04-25T19:31Z,Good to read this before the movie... Thanks
,armuzik15,2010-05-05T12:38Z,DO I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD ANY OTHER PROGRAM BEFORE I CAN DOWNLOAD MOVIES BECAUSE IT WONT LET ME..
,jagattack,2010-05-07T15:22Z,"Dude, is there a conclusion to this? I'm starting to get annoyed that I'm left hanging on number 8!"
[T],Juan.Too,2010-05-08T02:09Z,"@ jagattack

This is all of Book 1.
Book 2 has not yet been written.
As far as I know it hasn't been announced yet when they will start with the second book."
,2Adeline2,2010-05-08T02:53Z,"god dammit! I am mentally retarded when it comes to downloading things.
does this work on a mac? if it does can you explain how to do it.
thank you"
[T],Juan.Too,2010-05-08T14:56Z,"@ 2Adeline2 

If you're talking about how you can get the comic book files to work on a mac, you'll just need a comic book reader program that is mac-compatible.
I recommend SimpleComic
http://dancingtortoise.com/simplecomic/
or Jomic
http://jomic.sourceforge.net/
I also hear that the Xee image viewer works rather well as a comic book viewer
http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/xee

If you're asking about how to get torrenting to work on a mac, you'll need a BitTorrent client and it would be best if you just googled around for help with that."
,2Adeline2,2010-05-08T22:54Z,"I'm sorry, one more question.
When I try to open it on Jomic, it says ""must start with a known header bytes inst instead of ""d8:a"""" do you know what that means?"
[T],Juan.Too,2010-05-09T13:55Z,"Sorry, I have no idea what that means.

,T.J.CID,2010-09-08T22:15Z,"Book 2 should come out on September 15, 2010.

,BurtAlert,2010-10-31T23:42Z,Great upload! I saw the movie first and I was kind of disappointed with the comic. Still a great read.
