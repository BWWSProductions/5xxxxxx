Saturday Night Live S35 Special: Sports All-Stars

Hosts Jason Sudeikis and Will Forte portray their sports-commentator characters, Pete Twinkle and the vacuous Greg Stink, in a special featuring new skits and fan-favorite sports-themed sketches culled from the late-night show's archives.

Personally, I loved the Tiger Woods sketch.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion but not up to scene release standards. This is my own version, not a converted version of the x264 scene release. 

This episode aired on NBC on Jan 31, 2010.
