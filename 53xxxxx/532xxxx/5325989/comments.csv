It has a simple menu with all 8 episodes and the audio is converted to 6 channels."

@ frohtsgtes
Do not post bullshit please you are not helping."

,cinesimon,2010-02-14T10:57Z,"Hiya - are you sure the aspect ratio is correct on this burn? The planets are all rather oval...
I'm wondering if it was supposed to be 1.85:1 or 2.35:1 - not 1.78:1 as it's presented here?
Either that, or all round things in Halo are oval, I guess!"
,cinesimon,2010-02-14T11:24Z,"After a little finding out, I've figured out that this IS presented in an incorrect aspect ratio - it's not supposed to fill a 16:9 screen like 1.78:1 does, but have letterbox stripes as it's a 1.85:1 release - therefore all round objects are obviously presented as oval. 
Thanks for the effort though, uploader - it sucks when this shit happens!
If it matters, of course.
Me, I'm a real fusspot."
,gentox,2010-02-16T16:49Z,"@ cinesimon 
Yep something must have went wrong.
Don't know if it can be corrected with gomplayer or some other.
Anyway sorry for the screw up."
