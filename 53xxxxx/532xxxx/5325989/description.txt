The Halo franchise is going the Animatrix route by releasing a series of anime short films in a collected anthology entitled Halo Legends. The collection will feature seven stories told across eight episodes, all serving to expand the mythology of the Halo universe, much in the same way that the recently-released Halo 3: Odst sought to do.

For those of you still waiting on your live-action Halo movie, it seems as though youâ€™ll have to make due with Legends for now, so, if â€œuniverse expansion filmsâ€ like The Animatrix or Batman: Gotham Knight havenâ€™t turned you off completely to this sort of thing,


Enjoy...............
