This is the current run of Deadpool. The most recent issue (18) came out in December of '09 and issue 19 is slated for February of '10. This is my first torrent so if something isn't working quite right, let me know.


NOTE: I did NOT scan these .cbr's. I did not create the files. I had nothing to do with any of that. I simply couldn't find an up to date source anywhere and I knew someone else was feeling my frustration. The best I could find was up to issue 10. All I did was collect the files and upload them here. I believe most of the scans in here are from the Minutemen, but I think there are a select few from other sources.

That's about it. If you DO enjoy the scans, please support your local comic book shop.
