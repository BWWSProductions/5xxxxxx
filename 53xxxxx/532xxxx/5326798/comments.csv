,itaintrite,2010-02-01T18:54Z,Yes it works. You need a Jtagged Xbox360 though. Check readme file.
,ShinoBoy,2010-02-01T19:08Z,"Thanks. If i have iXtreme, is there a way to get Jtagged?  I googled it, but it looks like quite the process"
,itaintrite,2010-02-01T19:20Z,"Indeed, it's much more complicated than flashing your DVD firmware. 

You need to have a console that hasnt been updated to the latest dashboard (check in settings). If your console is pre-8955 and manufactured before summer 09, then you have a chance."
[V],HMVinyl,2010-02-01T20:22Z,"yeah its amazingly hard to find an old xbox, that hasn't been updated already, even if you go to EB Games or GameStop to trade in a console, they check to see if the console has been banned so it gets the update automaticly, unless they turn the console off, but why would they?"
,manowx28,2010-02-02T16:14Z,you need to have a console with a dasboard update 7173xx or below. i got one
,Roamin64,2010-02-02T18:36Z,"A HUGE thank you to the uploader  , and to whoever else is responsible for this.  I was trying to gather all the rock band dlc i could find, this clearly saves me tons of time!

Thank you very very much!"
,itaintrite,2010-02-02T23:07Z,"I heard there will be weekly/monthly updates too.

This week's DLC is already in the country Track Pack."
,brock_gonad,2010-02-03T04:25Z,"This is freaking awesome. Saves us tonnes of time.

Thanks uploader!!

And to this who don't have JTAG'd boxes - yes, it is as awesome as you've read. Too bad you all took the summer update!"
,bigern1990,2010-02-24T03:59Z,"Yeah, I've had my 360 Jtag'd for a few months now.  Honestly, it's the shit :)  Free dlc can't get any better.  I prefer Single Player games anyway, and I just buy the games I want to play on Live for my unmodded 360.

Im confused as to where I put these, I just extract the files from the album folder and put them in the specified folder in the readme.txt?  It mentions something about RB1 songs, but I don't see any here.  What songs go where, or do I just dump them all in the Partition 3 folder it mentions..."
,itaintrite,2010-03-21T22:13Z,"Whoops, late reply but just for future reference.

- All RB2 DLC songs go into the 000002 folder specified in the README file.
- The RB1 exported tracks go into 000001 in the same parent folder as 000002. You will need the license file (in 000002) and the latest Rock Band 2 Title Update file (in /Partition 3/Cache)."
,itaintrite,2010-03-22T05:50Z,"Full path:
For RB2 DLC: Partition 3\Content\0000000000000000\45410829\00000002
RB1: Partition 3\Content\0000000000000000\45410829\00000001"

,DornED,2010-04-02T16:45Z,"License file? Title update file? Are they supposed to be in this download, or am I missing something? Because most of the songs don't work for me. They are displayed in the game, but won't play. And some of them are grayed out and it says I can't play them until I purchased them.
Help would be appreciated!"
,itaintrite,2010-04-02T17:27Z,"You don't need license file for the DLC. Just place latest title update in Cache folder and they'll work. 

License files only needed for the Lego and RB1 exported tracks."
,DornED,2010-04-02T18:51Z,"Thanks for the quick reply. Still doesn't work though... I placed the title update file from a DLC update ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5451920/Rock_Band_Network_DLC_Updated_%2803_21_10%29 ) in the cache, but it won't work. Only 5 or so songs work, I think I'm missing something important..."
,DornED,2010-04-03T23:22Z,"Yess, got it working! I found out that my title update was NTSC, but I have a PAL box. Why do they region code every little piece of ...
Anyway, thanks for the help, most (I guess all, I'm still uploading to my box) songs work like charm"
,arkie3,2010-05-24T01:26Z,i can get some of the songs to work but some of them just show up on the song list screen but dont play when u click on them.av i done something wrong?
,arkie3,2010-05-24T19:01Z,anybody help?
,neuroxik,2010-07-05T08:34Z,"ANYBODY CAN HELP HERE?!
I'm not intending to put them on an Xbox (I don't even own one) but I downloaded some of the songs in order to extract the audio, whether it be ogg or mogg or whatever, I'm able to get around once I get to that point. Thing is, like the Bleach Pack from Nirvana, the filenames are hash-like and have no extension and I don't know how to extract the content. Anybody have any idea as to how to extract any of this on PC only?"
,TheUndYinG,2010-08-04T14:28Z,"I just cant get some songs to work for instance ""Alien Ant Farm - Smooth Criminal"" or Evanescence pack...they show up in menu but no preview and wont load either...have NTSC/U jtaged and rb2 TU in cache...Some songs work but most of them dont?"
,TheUndYinG,2010-08-04T14:33Z,Tried without TU its the same so its like my TU is not detected...?
,Scrag85,2011-07-09T13:07Z,Can someone please seed :)
,CockMuncher,2011-08-25T17:57Z,What a bunch of shit. Can someone post this in the mogg format so we can actually use them?
