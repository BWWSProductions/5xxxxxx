,win_,2010-02-03T05:59Z,"help me out anyone? when i follow the instructions to force host by turning off search then loading a map then turning search back on, it gives me this:

Request for 1 players in 1 subparties to join the gameSession
Rejecting incoming party member. Steam_IsInValidLobby() is false in AnonymousAddRequest.

obviously by reading that it must mean steam thinks it's an invalidlobby...

how can i fix this?"
