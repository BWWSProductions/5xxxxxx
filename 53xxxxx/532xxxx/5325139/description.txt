Release notes:

'Soldier Of Love' is the highly anticipated new body of work from the gorgeous
80's soul icon Sade, which is her first official studio album since the
multi-platinum release of 'Lovers Rock' in 2000.

Sade and her longtime bandmates including Stuart Matthewman, a.k.a. Cottonbelly,
regrouped in a U.K. recording studio in June and were recording and mixing into
October.

The eponymous first single has put us at ease. It's a narcotic skank with intro
horns that remind us of Hov's "Encore" and a guitar scratch smoothed by Sade's
inimitable cool voice.

Enjoy!
