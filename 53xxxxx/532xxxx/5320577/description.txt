
This is the GParted Live CD .iso Version 0.5.1-1
 

The GParted application is the GNOME partition editor for creating, reorganizing,
and deleting disk partitions.

A disk device can be subdivided into one or more partitions. The GParted 
application enables you to change the partition organization on a disk device 
while preserving the contents of the partitions.

With GParted you can accomplish the following tasks:

    * Create a partition table on a disk device.
    * Enable and disable partition flags such as boot and hidden.
    * Perform actions with partitions such as:
          o create or delete
          o resize or move
          o check
          o label
          o copy and paste

GParted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables. Several optional file system tools provide support for file systems not included in libparted.

GParted is developed on GNU/Linux. It can be used on other operating systems, such as Windows, by booting from media containing GParted Live.
