I'm not watching the series till i've got the whole 24 episodes :) coz when i've watched one episode I really want to see the next one straight away :)"
,physixmaster,2010-02-02T20:54Z,"God yeah, I agree with that but I just couldn't resist. My Mum said the same thing when I offered to bring them round to her house the other day. ""have you got all 24"" she said in hopeful tone she was almost upset when I said no just the 1st 5. Cheers eztv the 1st one was only shown in the UK on Sunday 31/1 I think."

And they wounder why people download TV episodes on the net... A whole year to wait, what a joke."
