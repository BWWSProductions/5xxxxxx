I initially uploaded this torrent with the title "Cranford (2007) and Return to

Cranford (2009)." It came out shorter. Since then I have repeatedly tried to amend

it to my original. It will not change. There must be some restriction in length or

other which prevents changing it. My apologies for not succeeding. If I had known

this would occur, I would have simply named the whole "Cranford (2007 and 2009)."







The enclosed text file has commentary on Cranford which I heartily agree with.

The first season of Cranford was easy to assemble and clean up in a neat package.

I did not watch the whole in real time. Evidently the second season of two episodes

came out as a Christmas Special in 2009. After that Masterpiece Classic showed

this Xmas special under the title of Return to Cranford in 2010. I wasted several

days beginning the laborious task of composing subtitles for Season 2 before
 
discocvering them already completed. The reason I overlooked tham was their label 

date of 2007. I'm calling the second season Return to Cranford (2010).
