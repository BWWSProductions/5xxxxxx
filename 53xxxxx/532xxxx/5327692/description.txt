       For the last show in the series, Graham Bell and Ed Leigh present 
       coverage of the most atmospheric slalom on the World Cup tour - 
       the Schladming night race in Austria.
       
       Around 50,000 spectators descend upon the resort and the home fans 
       have had plenty to celebrate in recent years, with Austrian skiers 
       winning for the past three seasons.
       
       Plus Graham takes on Ski Cross, which is the newest Winter Olympic 
       sport, and tackles the World Cup course on the Alpe d'Huez in 
       France.
