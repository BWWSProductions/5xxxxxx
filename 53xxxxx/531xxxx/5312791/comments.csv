,ScamWoW,2010-01-29T21:28Z,sorry i think my computer was off atm 
[V],Big_dude,2010-01-31T04:59Z,"ScamWoW you never upload anything unless you can properly seed it.  This is torrent rules 101. 

SEED!!!!!"
[V],Big_dude,2010-01-31T05:14Z,"Oh scamwow please don't tell me you deleted 
the data and can't seed.  My rule of thumb is I always keep the data, incase the seeds drop.

For that I just got a large capacity external harddrive.

true it eats up space but its the best why to upload torrents."
,ScamWoW,2010-02-01T07:08Z,oh no i got the data still i just wasnt home so my comp was off today
