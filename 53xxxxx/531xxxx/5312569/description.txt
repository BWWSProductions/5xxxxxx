The Story of Maths (2009)
Part 4

Without mathematics, there would be no physics, nor chemistry, nor cosmology. Oxford professor of mathematics, Marcus du Sautoy, explores the 30,000-year history of maths, examining the development of key mathematical ideas and shows how, in a multitude of surprising ways, they underpin the science, technology, and culture that shape our world. Four-part series about the history of mathematics, presented by Oxford professor Marcus du Sautoy.

To Infinity and Beyond
Marcus du Sautoy concludes his investigation into the history of mathematics with a look at some of the great unsolved problems that confronted mathematicians in the 20th century. After exploring Georg Cantor's work on infinity and Henri Poincare's work on chaos theory, he looks at how mathematics was itself thrown into chaos by the discoveries of Kurt Godel, who showed that the unknowable is an integral part of maths, and Paul Cohen, who established that there were several different sorts of mathematics in which conflicting answers to the same question were possible.

He concludes his journey by considering the great unsolved problems of mathematics today, including the Riemann Hypothesis, a conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers. A million dollar prize and a place in the history books await anyone who can prove Riemann's theorem.
