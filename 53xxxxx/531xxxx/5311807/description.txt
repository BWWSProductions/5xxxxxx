Torrent Ratio Keeper is the best ratio/upload increase tool for all private trackers.
It's version for Linux/*BSD/MacOS. It's free! This version can run on any PC with Java 1.5/1.6/1.7 installed.

* Upload increase up to 1000%

Expert features:
1. Seeder Mode: tracker will see you as seeder and not as a leecher. You can download anything without care about your ratio. I love this feature. Even without upload increase I can download anything :D
2. Network problems emulation: Tracker will not see uploading/downloading at all.
