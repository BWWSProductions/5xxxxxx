Tonight we will cover Obamaâ€™s address to Congress, and the Republican response from the almost-as-handsome-as-Scott-Brown Bob McDonnell, Gov. of Virginia.  We will carry both speeches live.

Can Obama recapture the hearts and minds of his once-rock-solid Democratic base?  Will it be â€œYes We Can!â€ or â€œDomestic Spending Freezes, Wars, and No Health Care Reform?â€  In order to stop his poll numbers from rapidly circling the drain, heâ€™ll have to prove heâ€™s aware of their disappointments and concerns, and has not abandoned the core policies, the promised change, that drove voters to elect him in the first place.

Unlike recent â€œbang-bang, shoot â€˜em up, 9-11,9-11,9-11, terrorism, evildoers, letâ€™s rollâ€ State of the Union addresses delivered by Dubya,weâ€™ll hear a campaign-style speech targeted at the growing population of populist Independent voters.  Perhaps the greatest â€œchangeâ€ weâ€™ll hear from previous years is perfect grammar and complete sentences.
