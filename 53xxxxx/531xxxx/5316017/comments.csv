,GodForbid666,2010-02-15T10:18Z,"Great torrent, horrible movie. Theres a reason you don't have 6 directors doing one film. Every chapter in the movie transfers like a train wreck. His armor and weapon changes, main characters appearances drastically change, and his fucking horse did some jumps from the matrix in the first 3 mins. This is such a slapped together piece of shit movie, fuck EA for not putting out a PC version of this game because of piracy and then trying to sell this pile of crap. DANTE'S TENTH LEVEL OF HELL? HAVING TO WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER FOR EVER. To top it all off, It probably just ruined what would have been cool plot twists during the game.  "
