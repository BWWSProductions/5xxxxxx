Castlevania 1, Castlevania 2 Simon's Quest and Castlevania 3 Dracula's Curse. The following upload are Mp3 file Medleys of ALL the music from each classic NES video game.

The Castlevania franchise featured the BEST original music of any video game. 

I acquired the MIDI formats of the following music from a great website:http://www-personal.umich.edu/~tdkim/midi/nin8.html

I then converted them to Mp3 so you can take them where ever you go.

Each Melody contains all the music featured in the particular Castlevania game.

Listen and ENJOY!

PLEASE SEED (as the Mp3 versions of this music is NOT available on the Internet) 

Thanks,

Have fun with some classic music from vintage gaming days!
