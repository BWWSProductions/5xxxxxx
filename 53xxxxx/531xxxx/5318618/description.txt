-Ray is the rendering engine of choice for architectural visualization artists.  Based on the 2009 CGarchitect Architectural Visualization Industry survey, V-Ray is used by over 70% of the industry. If you're not using V-Ray, you should be!

V-Ray is the solution of choice for many 3D production houses due to its capability to deliver high quality photorealistic images in the shortest time.

Top companies like Spine3D, Neoscape, Pure, and Smoothe all use V-Ray to produce some the world's more recognized and high quality architectural visualizations and films.

- Multi-platform object-oriented API

- Modular architecture - many components of the system can be replaced with custom ones 	- Efficient geometry handling
- True instance rendering
- On-demand dynamic geometry creation
- On-demand geometry loading from disk files
- Displacement mapping
- Catmull-Clark and Loop subdivision surfaces
- Extensible with custom geometric primitives through the V-Ray
 SDK

 Three different image sampling methods

- Full-scene antialiasing
- Progressive path tracing
- Support for additional render elements (diffuse, reflection, GI etc)
- Advanced color (tone) mapping controls
- Extensible with custom image samplers through the V-Ray SDK
	- Physically accurate full global illumination solutions
- Different GI algorithms: path tracing, irradiance cache, photon maps, light cache
- Reusable GI solutions for accelerated rendering of walk-through animations and animations with dynamic objects
- Physically accurate area lights
- Efficient illumination from HDR environments
- Procedural sun & sky models
- Extensible with custom lights through the V-Ray SDK
- IES photometric lights

 Toon effect
- Fur generator/raytracer
- Extended matte/shadow capabilities
- Support for Render-to-Texture mode of 3ds Max
- VRaySphereFade to isolate only specific portions of the scene for compositing 	- V-Ray specific frame buffer with integrated color corrections and display of multiple rendering elements
- Direct rendering to disk for extremely large images, either as OpenEXR files or as .vrimg files
