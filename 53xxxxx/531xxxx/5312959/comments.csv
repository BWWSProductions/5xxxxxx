,lufal78,2010-01-27T22:19Z,will this fix the char creation?
,battleangel,2010-01-28T08:18Z,"I don't know if this fixes the new character creation (or import), but what I did was to go to gamecopyworld and get a ""no intro patch"" that overwrites some of the loading movies and intro developer screens. It's probably overkill to overwrite them all, but it fixes the problem so what the hell."
,blackhackers,2010-01-28T13:16Z,hope this work.. i think later i will encounter that purgatory.. hope i wont encounter any crash.
,panda-kun,2010-01-28T14:11Z,"this is for the char creation crash. fixed mine. :D thanks shroo! btw shroo, i still get the sky-shipping error in the Dark Void launcher :( no luck. "

,Chiva$,2010-02-05T12:41Z,"exactly like the above, i'm trying a second install right now (and i know i've done everything correctly, i've been playing tptb games for a long time and i rarelly had any problems, except latelly, by the way thnx for all the realeases people!)"
,Chiva$,2010-02-05T15:29Z,"no luck... and by reading on the bioware forums it seems it is either a processor problem (not supporting single core proccesors or by recognising double core ones as single)...
they say there might be a fix with the next patch, shroo we'd really appreciate if you rip/crack-upload the next patch :)"
,madridistasubliminal,2010-02-06T08:07Z,"Hey shroo

Your 4shared link that you provided for registry fix back in september is invalid now.
