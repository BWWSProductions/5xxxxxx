,kroan,2011-04-17T18:41Z,"I have no troubles with mkv files. Try using GOM Player, VLC Player, or get a codec pack from filehippo.com"
,Yenrock7,2011-04-25T02:52Z,What's MKV? I doubt it will play through my portable harddisk.
,vampiir97,2011-06-28T20:57Z,What the hell are you talking about bad mkv files? Try using VLC player not sh*t like DickX (originally DivX) or Windows Live Player!!!!!!!!
