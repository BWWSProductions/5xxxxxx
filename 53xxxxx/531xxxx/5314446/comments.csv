It rained on the rocks for billions of years and then the rocks turned into soup and eventually organic material resulted. That's science? How about panspermia? Life came from outer space. Well, where did that life from outer space came from? Why do you folks listen to this garbage. Get real. A loving God created you in His own image and gave His life to save you."
