For some reason, in the director's or writer's world, air support and reinforcements are not part of military doctrine."

Konvoidele IED attacks, and there were daily events. Not quite as severe as those shown in the film, but with the same bloody though."

There is a narrator translating the whole movie at the same time. Irritating. 
Do not download!"
