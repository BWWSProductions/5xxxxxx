  Love can be painful. Very painful. The intriguing-on-the-outside, 
twisted-and-tortured-on-the-inside Tara sets her sights on the unassuming 
guy-next-door Ray. Their innocent flirting turns into a regretful one night 
stand which he hopes to put behind him. Tara has different plans for their r-
elationship. It becomes horrifically apparent that she refuses to be cast 
aside and is willing to go to sick extremes to keep her man as people 
in Ray's life are met with torturous ends. Amidst this violently 
twisted love story unfolds a profound social commentary on love 
              and the effects of violence.
