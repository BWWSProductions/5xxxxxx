           In 1989, a breakthrough in advanced parasitic research on      
           Cuttyhunk Island, gave scientists a jump in human              
           evolution. Initial tests proved promising as subjects          
           were experiencing heightened physical and mental strength      
           and awareness. But, something in the experiment went           
           horribly wrong and the island mysteriously lost three          
           quarters of its population. Jamie Akerman fled the             
           outbreak, which took her mothers life, twenty years ago.       
           She now returns with her boyfriend and step brother, to        
           sell the family property. There, they uncover the key to       
           Jamie's disturbing past, and the horrifying secrets long       
           suppressed by the town leader, Larkin. Now, a new strain       
           of parasite has emerged, and threatens the island once         
           again. Jamie struggles to survive and escape the               
           obsessive pursuit of the local islanders who know that         
           she has inherited more than she could ever have imagined.
