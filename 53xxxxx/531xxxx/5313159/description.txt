Exploring the amazing true story of the historic World War II Dambusters Raid -- when English planes dropped bouncing bombs to destroy German dams -- this documentary features interviews with mission pilots and archival footage of special bomb tests. The bouncing bombs had to be dropped from exactly 60 feet while under fire, making the success of the 19 Lancaster pilots on this dangerous mission an extraordinary feat.
