Quite simply Blanchards best album and one of the best of the year so far. This recording sees Blanchard moving into altogether different territory from his hard bop days with the jazz messengers.Added to the standard acoustic lineup is the use of the synth effects to create a different backdrop for the musicians to perform. This isn't high tech stuff but just enough give the album a completely origional sound. 

Blanchard is in customary good form and so is tenor sax man Brice Winston and Lionel Loueke puts his voice to great effect on the lengthy track "Wadagbe" with some Afro style chants. 

The compositions are fresh and original,the musicians are all on top form and the electronic effects give the whole thing a fusion'ish feel. 

All in all - great stuff.
