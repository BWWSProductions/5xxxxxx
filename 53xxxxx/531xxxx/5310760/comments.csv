I reread your post, it's another problem, it reboots (at boot)
try pressing F8 a couple of times when opening the VM
if it asks if you want to boot from cd or hd you're too early, click H and press it a couple of times more.

then finally once you can enter boot options enter -v (verbose) and tell me when it reboots"

1. an Intel CPU:

2. motherboard BIOS that supports Intel VT-x

2.2 there are still quite a number of mobo BIOS that don't support Intel VT-x

3. VMware (either one)

3.2 VMware Player 3 and above
3.3 VMware Fusion 3 and above
3.4 not sure which version of VMware Server is required.

if display is screwed up, just resize VMware window (or restore/maximize) and back, and the display should refresh itself.

Video/Audio is smooth. Just having minor glitches with some OpenGL apps. A bit laggy compared to your 10.5.8 release, but i guess that was expected. Any way to enable  64-bit Kernel and Extensions? That might help improve performance.
