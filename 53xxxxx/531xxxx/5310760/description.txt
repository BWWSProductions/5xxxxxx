I'm a bit early, so don't expect a great seed till next weekend.
Feel free to try though.

ON WITH THE SHOW!

I told you I was making a 10.6.2 image.
Retail based (so no premade virtual machines with small edits.)
Of course audio, networking and screen resolutions work AND the 1440x900 bug is solved.

Instructions:

This VMware image works on VMware workstation and player, tested on debian/GNU/Linux and windows xp.
NOTE only works on Intel pcs with hardware virtualization enables

How to get it working:
1: install VMware player or workstation
2: extract rar files
3: edit the settings so it loads bootloader.img on boot (in virtual CD drive)
4: start it
5: do what the installer asks

Password is what you tell it to be, same with username.
