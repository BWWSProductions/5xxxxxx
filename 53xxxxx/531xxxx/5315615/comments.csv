,ankjevik,2010-01-28T18:28Z,"if this is no good? i will do anything to make sure your trusted mark is gone!!!!
because i have now been looking for this episode for the last 13 hours"
,ankjevik,2010-01-28T18:32Z,somebody pleese upload a normal sized hdtvrip of this episode!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-28T18:36Z,"If you ask ""is mp4 is for real?"", answer is ""Yes""
If you ask ""is it possible ti squeeze whole episode in 149 MB?"", answer is ""Absolutely. It is even bigger than should be.""
If you ask about quality, my answer is always the same: ""Regarding the size, quality is decent.""
If you ask ""Is this really episode 12"", my answer is written in the ""Note"" above."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-28T18:42Z,"@ankjevik:
""i will do anything to make sure your trusted mark is gone!!!!""

I do not respond very well on threats.
I guess moderators also... so - watch your language, you look pretty crazy by now."
,ankjevik,2010-01-28T18:42Z,"ok, twentyforty. i am sorry! its just that i have only seen fakes of this episode all day. thats why i am a bit scept.
thank for the upload "
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-28T19:19Z,"@ankjevik: I really do understand your mistrust. I have ""eaten"" so many fakes, even last week... I'll never forget, eagerly waiting for ""Resident Evil 3"" downloaded - no less than 11 fakes! LOL. I am still not sure was it because I upfront trust the people or because I wasn't aware of proportions of ""faking"", back then, of course.

However ankjevik, it is always good to take  deep breath and READ what is written in the description of some torrent. It might help. Also, by clicking on ""uploaders nickname"" one could get informed about way and purpose of someone's work... and THEN decide to download or not.
Rest assured, for such ""investigative work"" you'd need less then two minutes, and it may prevent you for being rude and stupid as you just did.

BTW, you have read the Note by now, right?"
,3kr,2010-01-28T19:27Z,Thanks 
,amadteaparty81,2010-01-28T19:39Z,Small... but still def. 100% watchable... had problems finding this ep. legit... thanks for the upload. :)
,ankjevik,2010-01-28T19:41Z,"yes, as i said i am sorry for not reading it properly and treatening. that was realy uncalled for. thanks for the upload. you got a thumbs up from me! ok quality and RESPECT for uploading before anyone else!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-28T19:43Z,"@dudekotka: So, you can't read, got that.
It wasn't good enough (my work, my time and my help) to say plain ""Thanks""?
Get lost, midget, or show some respect (but I doubt your kind can do that).
And... never ever come back."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-28T22:46Z,"@BPeppy: First of all, thank you for asking and for appreciation of what I'm doing. Regarding the ""Leverage"" I did watch entire first season. But, after first three episodes show started to decline, and frankly, I was bored with the rest of the season. Can you take that? 

I know that every show has some fan-base, people who I do not know, or their whereabouts and backgrounds, and I do not want to piss anybody or meddle with people's taste. But...

Intro is finished, don't worry... what I am going to say is following:
- This can be considered as the try you talk about. Leverage failed - badly - not the show itself (I even watched this episode and it was actually a good one); but the people have - failed. I have learned that things which start bad only can become worse.

So, all what I do is not for the sake of television, shows, myself or whatever it might be - but for the people who cannot afford download of normal encodings, but need small file-sizes to fit into smaller allowances or traffic limitations.

Believe me, they can, know how and are prepared to sacrifice a little of quality for really huge savings of bandwidth, monthly-wise.

These Leverage-people cannot. They are different ""breed"", they came here just 'cause I had something they wanted - and that's all. Sadly, whenever thing like this happens (Scene groups did not release something) and I jump-in to help - I regret it later. 

What starts bad, ends bad. Better is not to start something like this - which has left me with bitterness in my mouth and in my heart. Same as for ""Big Love"" (ironic, isn't it?). Big Love and Leverage, one after another."
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2010-01-29T01:47Z,twentyforty thank you so much! I was getting nervous that I took Pirate Bay for granted and for the first time did not watch the episode. Thank you for the Download. 
,miviwa,2010-01-29T03:59Z,much appreciated!  good copy.
,MrBugMan,2010-01-29T05:36Z,My GF only cares if this is better than watching on HULU or something.  She gives me the thumbs up to DL.
,tyrone69,2010-01-29T07:00Z,"nice work, 2040. 

can i request burn notice s03e11? 

thanks, man."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-29T07:59Z,"@BoonDockSaiNt30: Thanks for trusting and download.

@zmacdaddy8: You've said it! Thanks. I need people who recognize what  I'm doing to speak up. If they stay mute, I feel like I'm in some groundhog loop, explaining absolutely the same stuff over and over, day after  day all these years.
Regarding ""failed CRC"" I experienced the same, but only for uploads in specific time-slot. There have talk about that. If I ever encounter corrupted download - I change the file-host and download same part again, You use jdownloader, right? It's best one. 

@miviwa: It is not my usual quality, I just jumped-in. I found unofficially XviD, downloaded it, re-encoded in two passes to get most of it than uploaded. 1 hour work. There is no real need to praise me, but instead of thanking, first reactions were mixture of insults, threats, backing-up, stating the obvious and repeating  of things I've already said in the description of torrent. Even if it was first and the last Leverage episode I've done on TPB, I am still glad for helping the normal, less vocal fans of the show.

@mary50: All good Mary. I wish you complete recovery. Regarding CM, they haven't been aired this week, As you have noticed, TV schedule is not stabilized yet. Bookmark tvrage.com.

@MrBugMan: LOL, I am sure that my encoding looks better than HULU stuff. I hope your GF like it.

@tyrone69: Yes, this is second week of BN. During the season two I kicked BN out from my schedule because of the low interest and high number of hit and runs. Right now 301 has 8 seeders. It is bad. Remember, I am not eztv, if fans doesn't support some show, I cannot do anything about and I am forced to omit the show, or maybe uploaded it randomly."
,Hoverboy37,2010-01-30T10:29Z,"Had trouble streaming it to the XBMC side of my apple-tv, but as it's an mp4 I was able to send it over via itunes. The issue's on my end no doubt, but aside from that the quality's fine, and as a bonus the smaller size makes downloading a snap. Thanks! And yeah, this is the real deal, Leverage - Season 2 Episode 12."
[V],matimike,2010-02-08T00:54Z,a/v 10 thanks
