,adamken,2010-01-30T08:08Z,is this real
,HelperX,2010-01-30T08:19Z,Yes it works
,adamken,2010-01-30T15:28Z,hi is the a way to save the config when u press the test button
,HelperX,2010-01-31T03:15Z,"After you change any individual settings in the test menu, it will ask you if you want to save.

If you are talking about the typex_config which is your controller set up, it autosaves."
,OrangePillow,2010-01-31T07:52Z,"Amazing game from the looks of it but the problem is that the config doesn't recognize my gamepad, it's a trust predator gamepad.

Any workarounds would be appreciated."
,HelperX,2010-01-31T13:18Z,Try A key to pad program.  Like Xpadder.
,HelperX,2010-01-31T13:19Z,"Xpadder download and guide can be found at:

dual-complex""blogspot""com

replace "" with ."
,OrangePillow,2010-02-01T11:30Z,"Thanks, I'll give it a go."
,OrangePillow,2010-02-01T12:57Z,"Ok, I tried it, I've used xpadder without problems with other games before. 

The issue with this game is that the button config you added within doesn't recognize any of the buttons on my keyboard aswell, so adding those keys to my pad didn't make any difference.

I really want to get the game going but it seems that the current version of your input program doesn't support my hardware and I'm guessing more people have this weird problem."
,HelperX,2010-02-01T14:29Z,"It would help if you posted your specs, and what your running so we can trouble shoot this out."
,OrangePillow,2010-02-02T01:14Z,"Sure, if it would help.

Windows xp sp3
AMD Athlon 64 x2 5000+ (2.6 Ghz)
2GB Ram 
HD4850 (512 MB)

I'm pretty sure my setup can handle the game, build it myself a while ago, though I'm not sure what causes the incompatibility with the configsetup that's included in your torrent.

I reckon some other people did get it to work with gamepads other than the original xbox pad. If not, then I'm out of luck I guess."
,RaxFaelo,2010-02-07T08:00Z,"Hi, im new on this stuff i downloaded the torrent.

,RaxFaelo,2010-02-07T08:25Z,Nevermind what i said i got the game working and can configure the controls now i cant use the control i configured. btw i play with the keyboard not joystick
,overgamer,2010-02-24T21:49Z,ty to all the seeders
,winzentween,2010-03-02T21:25Z,any idea how to stop the game reseting after you change the language to english and the difficulty to hard???
,Soran.Ibraham,2010-03-04T22:59Z,"What do I do for an I/O error, it pops up no matter how I start the game. I am fairly new to torrenting, so if you can help, it's appreciated."
,garyoak99,2010-03-12T05:15Z,"Soran.Ibraham, you run the game using BlazBlue1.bat"
,Haltyr,2010-03-12T11:41Z,"Im having the same issue as OrangePillow. When after pressing n, n, n, enter, it doesnt respond to any of my buttons. I tried configuring my keyboard, and then i got my ps3 controller configured to try that, and no success there either.

64 bit too, if that matters >."
,SkyPirate48,2010-03-16T22:40Z,"I have Soran's problem, and I know how this is SUPPOSED to be run, it just isn't working. Windows 7 btw."
,calafate,2010-03-20T16:15Z,"Faking great game. It works perfect for me,  i have Win7 64 Bits and all i do for runing it is drag the Game.exe into the Typex_Loader.exe in the same folder. Its faking weird to run a game, but thats the way it runs for me.

,Thuggles,2010-04-25T19:03Z,"I have a weird ass white grid across the whole screen, makes the game REALLY hard to play. Also I'm playing with a 360 pad and it wont let me hit 2 direction buttons at once, so I can't down block or jump in or any of that shit. Anyone have any suggestions? I'm going to try binding shit to my keyboard and use xpadder but I don't know what to do about the grid thing. 8800GT 196.34"
,Thuggles,2010-04-25T19:16Z,"Xpadder solved my input issue. Here's an example of my screen problem.

,OreoDragon,2010-04-29T05:22Z,"Works great, but there's one problem: The settings do NOT save. It offers to, and despite accepting, the settings jump back to default when the game is restarted."
,gorenyjoe,2010-05-02T08:16Z,The game can only sava data to drive (D:) so if you want to have options data saved you have to change drive letter also you cannot change the letter of the system drive in this case use a pendrive. Hope it helps.
,Rovelius,2010-05-31T17:45Z,"Most seeders are generous on this Torrent, was dling at 800Kbps... so I've seeded x3, thanks"
,devilxking,2010-06-20T03:15Z,"The game works great, but for some reason my screen is way too far over to the right? So I can't see half of what's going on, like my opponents lifebars etc.

How do I fix this?"

,Nightbringer2010,2010-07-25T11:40Z,"Hi, i kinda have some difficulties trying to run the game. When i enter game , it says insert coin and such, i am not into these kind of ""making things on pc work out"" something like that, can someone try to put me on the right path here how i can make it work? thx :)"
,theonesin,2010-07-28T18:23Z,"I just downloaded this game and I'm having the same problems with controller setup. I configured Xpadder just fine, but once I run the game nothing happens. Then I tried unplugging the controller and configuring the controls just to the keyboard. Once I get in-game, again the controls don't work (meaning I'm stuck at the ""Insert Coin"" screen). How can I fix this?"
,Omochao,2010-08-16T18:47Z,this worked fine for me. luvin this game. all u need to do is extract the file. go to the read me file and follow the instructions that are there. in there it will teach u on how to do the controls and how to open the program
,Zen9th,2010-09-10T08:34Z,Sorry abt that. I'm an idiot and I'm new. What is the password ?
,xtracrossxx,2010-09-12T08:48Z,this is rmuated rite???
,Maxmetpt,2010-09-15T21:53Z,"This is a working version of the game, but only the Arcade machine Taito Type X2 from Japan, which has only Arcade mode, it isn't like the PS3/XBOX version that has lots of modes... oh, and btw, to run the game u just have to run the Game file :P I guess it's a bat file or so ;)"
,PauloA,2010-09-25T13:58Z,"Ok, i see that some people are having problems with the control configuration, i had too, so let me tech you guys how to make it work.

Some USB gamepads do not are recognized, so what you have to do is DISCONNECT YOUR USB GAMEPAD and then configure the controls on your keyboard.
if you wanna use your gamepad, download Xpadder and configure it to the keyboard controls you made.

Pretty simple dont it?

(btw, english is not my mother language so sorry for any erros ou mistyping)"
,r2007uk,2011-01-10T18:42Z,"So i just discovered this torrent...
I already have calamity trigger (5gb) installed and working fine---

is this like an addon to that or a standalone game? I only ask since I know that Cshift is a replica of Ctrigger WITH Extra's.. So why is it only 1gb?

or is this compressed as fuk? xD"

,Oniros,2012-06-19T06:12Z,"Just a heads up. This is not the PC version that was available through GFWL. It's the arcade version. Therefore it lacks quite some features.
Runs ok though."
