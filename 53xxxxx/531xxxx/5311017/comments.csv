[V],TvTeam,2010-01-27T04:05Z,"jujubean15, please use VLC player.

No need codecs or whateva. just VLC player.

google for it, it's freeware."
,SonGoku7,2010-01-27T22:28Z,jujubean15 do you use a pram like filzip on the file because then you get an mkv file from all those files and you can delete all the other files easily and just play the mkv file on either Media Player Classic or VLC Media Player Or MPCstar Player even 
,SonGoku7,2010-01-27T22:29Z,meant to say program that unpacks the files
