,Jfelt45,2011-08-14T05:41Z,"Hey, I have spent days trying to get one of the MW nfs games to work... Basically what I have done is:

Opened CD1, unrared the first .ro and gotten the iso. Then I mount the iso to F, and install. I get to a point where it is asking me to insert the CD/DVD in. Now I know 100's of people ask this question, but I have looked at all the replies to their comments, and not been able to get this to work, if anyone can instruct me what to do now, not only would I be eternally greatful, but I would help spread the info, and continue to seed this for others :D Thanks in advance for anyone willing to help, and I have downloaded alot of torrents before, and I can say I know my way around a computer, so I can undestand a fair amount of instructions :D"
