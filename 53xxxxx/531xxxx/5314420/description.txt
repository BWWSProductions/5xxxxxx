

This is a concert video, not the CD. This is a performance that was shown on MTV back in the day of a concert in 1982, shortly after Randy Rhoads death. The lineup is the same as that of the Speak of the Devil album, but this concert is not all Black Sabbath, but rather Blizzard, Diary, and a few Sabbath tunes at the end.

The DVD was Brazilian and had very few subtitles; I didn't include those. I'm not sure if this was ever released in the US, suffice to say, it is very difficult to find.

Set list:
Over The Mountain, Mr. Crowley, Crazy Train, Revelation (Mother Earth), Steal Away The Night, Believer, I Don't Know, Goodbye To Romance, Flying High Again, Suicide Solution, Iron Man, Children Of The Grave, and Paranoid.

Enjoy.
