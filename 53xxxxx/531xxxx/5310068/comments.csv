I've looked through a lot of your 
previous uploads, great reviews from
the downloaders. Nice to see you reply to
commenters regularly. Any chance you 
can get Ninja Assassin?, other uploads
of that movie are not good enough."

When literary anything comes out, you can be sure that I will look into. Even if I have done cams and telesyncs, I never had upped utter crap. 
So, as for anything else, I will keep in mind N.A and now is only question When."
