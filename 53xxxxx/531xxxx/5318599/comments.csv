,ptv83,2010-02-01T04:53Z,"it's not leno vs conan, it's advertising dollars, NBC can get $55000 for a 30second ad during a drama at 10:30 so they were going to move leno back to 11:35 because they can only get $35000 during his show, because of ratings, but conan didn't want to be put after midnight again (just like david letterman when he started and went to cbs) so conan said he would quit.

, it's the same during dave's show too and jimmy's, jimmy fallon just sucks so he's getting axed, craig is on the fence... it's all because people don't watch anymore, blame the audience for killing the ratings and advertising revenues.  blame pvr's, blame shows like TMZ, blame the internet, nobody watches to see gossip or news jokes. nobody cares about seeing celeb's anymore,,, nobody needs to watch anymore.  it's not leno, it's the network getting more money for the 10:30 slot and conan quitting because of the time slot. .. get educated. then open your mouth."
