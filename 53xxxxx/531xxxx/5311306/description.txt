Part. 2

The Claudia Jordan Show and Friends is a radio show on Siruis 106 and XM 149, about 5 fabulous females and why they are single and (often times) SexLESS. The show is hosted by The Foxxhole's very own Claudia Jordan and Friends; introducing Flora, Porscha, Tina Divina, and the not so single Shelly Rio. The Single Life is a comedic look into the dating world, "real" talk about love and relationships. So please listen in, call in, laugh, and cry with us every Monday on Foxxhole Radio.
