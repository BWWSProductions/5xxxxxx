Notes: Two breakouts dotted the setlist: the first Letter to Jimmy Page (separate from Alumni Blues) since June 19, 1988 (745 shows) and the first Cities since September 13, 1988 (710 shows). Trey quoted the theme from Shaft at the start of the second set; there was also a Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies tease. Sweet Adeline and Ginseng Sullivan through Amazing Grace were performed without microphones. Ginseng Sullivan and My Sweet One were performed acoustic. The latter evolved into a sing-along with the audience during the second verse.
