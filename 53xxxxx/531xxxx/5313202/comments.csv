Word of warning, though: I mounted the image files (there are two) first and when it asked me to insert CD 2 (in Russian), I mounted the second image but the message just wouldn't go through. I tried various things but in the end I had to burn them myself. Not sure if this is just me, but yeah don't freak out if mounting it doesn't work."
