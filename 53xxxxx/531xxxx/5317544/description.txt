Please seed (share) these programs. Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks.

             PropertiesPlus is an add-on for your Windows Explorer. 

It adds additional functionality to your right-click menu under the menu option PropertiesPlus. 

Here you'll be able to modify file attributes, file extensions, and the time stamps of single files, multiple files, or files contained within the folders.
 
This program is simple to install and easy to use. If you frequently require more control over your files than that allowed by the base Windows application, PropertiesPlus will allow you considerable flexibility.
