,the_devious,2010-01-29T08:28Z,"One of the worst rated movies on RT, but WTF, if wifey's gonna love it, she must be blonde! BTW, SecretMyth seems to have a French Connection. Since he's been posting rls info as an image, and copy/pasting from imdb... guess what, imdb detects your country and indicates that after the local release date. Look at any recent SM link under ""DESCRIPTION"" and you'll see ""(France)"" after the release date.
Not very bright for an uploader to reveal that type of thing, especially with HADOPI waiting round the corner! Note the grammatical mistakes as well... ""after download finish""... should be ""finishes""... he ain't no anglophone. At least the guy has finally twigged on resolution."
,raj88,2010-01-29T08:33Z,plz take ur time 2 rip ........triangle

,Bogdan_RBF,2010-01-29T13:17Z,"sorry,but yes it's a bit out of sync...i've managed to fix that by audio-delaying with 4700msec in bsplayer (ctrl+shift+left)...hope it helps!!"

,d_archangel,2010-01-29T15:50Z,@ the_devious Secretmyth is Romanian and he is the best encoder/uploader ever. No other releases have such high quality at such low bitrates!
,anyeuha_80,2010-01-29T16:20Z,Thanks so much! U're my good Friends!
,the_devious,2010-01-29T17:03Z,"@ d_archangel
I never suggested what his actual nationality might be. He may well be Romanian... that doesn't stop him from being located in France. All I'm saying is that whoever copy/pasted the imdb info in SM's release descriptions was detected by imdb as being located in France. That's all.
Where people come from, the color of their skin... makes no difference to me."
,sweetalmond,2010-01-29T23:20Z,"Hey...

Thank you secret_myth!!!

I have a question...

Anyone knows how I could burn the subtitles on the mp4 file?
I would like to stream it to my XBOX 360 which does not support subtitles view...

I tried meGUI and ripbot264, but they mess up the sync between the video and sound...

But if I play with VLC it works fine (the subtitles are synced but not burned...)

Any idea???

Thanks!"
,oldSMfan,2010-01-29T23:42Z,"@the devious
Well .... lets just say at least I can, & I have a wife and I do not have to keep taking things into my own hands! ... if you get my drift? You probably won't, you're probably too illiterate to understand.

Have a nice day, looser! Talk to yourself! Go watch TV [if you have one!], & call a friend [again, if you have one. If not, remember you can always pay someone!]

Cheers M8!"

,Magge93,2010-01-30T13:04Z,How do you convert one of SecretMyth's mp4 bd/brrip files to avi so that you can watch on a divx-compatible dvd player?

,vanetz,2010-02-01T18:55Z,"Great quality, but it indeed looks out of sync... in MPC. VLC media player plays it fine though, even on my POS comp."
[V],Team_xRG,2010-02-02T18:28Z,"guys its not only secretmyth its with everyone 
dont u think it cant be secretmyth cos it worked on vlc fine?
its some problem in codecs 
and i always suggest to use kmplayer its uses its own codecs and playback is much much better 
and 1 more thing many other uploaders are having this problem 
thnx "
,Az-McTiz,2010-02-03T09:28Z,"This movie has issues , and i have started noticing it in secretmyths other releases, most notably 2012.
Around 22 mins it starts freezing and playing constantly and then the audio is out of wack. I'm using VLC player and also tried KMplayer. What's going on with this ? Is it me or has secret dropped the bar?"
,fz82,2010-02-04T18:31Z,"thanks SM!

guys (and girls), if I don't choose to download 2ch audio but still continue to ""seed"" after I downloaded the rest of the files, will I be in one of these approx 390 seeders or 600 leechers?"
,dcoleman,2010-02-09T18:09Z,"This worked good for me. I am using the latest VLC 1.0.5 if that makes any dif. for anyone.
I have not had a chance to test it on the PS3 yet."
,greengo83,2010-02-10T20:14Z,"For all using k-lite codec pack, try to install STANDARD version instead of FULL. It worked for me I mean I still can notice very slight out of sync but fo me it's acceptable and I can stick with my fav player. vlc and KM player are s*** for movies with subs "
,Kaelon,2010-02-26T21:26Z,"As usual, fantastic quality, thanks myth ;)"
,silentthunder,2010-03-20T23:55Z,"Looks great in VLC, thanks Secretmyth, always the best. As for you nitpickers, you can't complain about something that's free.. If it will help your OCD, go buy it!"
,as14ever,2010-07-03T19:32Z,"Movie request to any one that can do it. I have a request for some very hard movies to find as mpeg4 BRRip H264 AAC3 in resolutions: 1280x544 or 1280x720 or even 1920x1080p

The Movies are: Appleseed 2004 
Tron 1982
Brazil 1985
Naked Lunch 1991
Conan the Barbarian 1982
Conan the Destroyer 1984
The Dark Crystal 1982
King Kong 1976
The Secret of NIMH 1982
Spike Lee School Daze 1988
Spike Lee Mo Better Blues 1990

If any one can find these movies in the format mentioned above, or can create them in the same quality as secret_myth I would be very appreciative and can maybe work on some type of compensation if needed.

Let me know at firstliight@yahoo.com "
