In many parts of the world the REAL episode numbering system was used for house when the 'double episode' was known as episodes 1 and 2.
On IMDB, the numbering is wrong when compared to the production notes.

So episode 11 of season six is actually episode 12 of season six using the production company notes rather then the erroneous IMDB version.

Now who'se the dipshit?"
,Doomslayer1985,2010-02-01T22:26Z,take a look at TV.COM this IS episode 11 u moron
,imaculate,2010-02-02T03:49Z,"for you fucktards who are getting on the poster's case, at least he's putting up videos to share.  We should be encouraging not putting them down for their efforts.  Fuckers like you are most likely leechers.  Plus you obviously don't do your research because in the description it states 
""House M.D. :: Remorse
Episode: 06x12
Spoken language: russian
Translation: Sovereign Leprosorium
Voices: kubik_v_kube""

House M.D. :: Remorse would be episode 11 or 12 depending on your sources.  Either way, you should know which this is.  Thanks for uploading and sharing jepebrilo."
,imaculate,2010-02-02T03:56Z,"one more thing.  IF you want to get really technical about it, let's go to the source FOX, the network that debuted House and see what they say...

http://www.fox.com/house/recaps/s6_e13.htm

oh, from the drop down menu for Season 6, ""Remorse"" is episode 12.  So fuck your TV.com dipshit.  Get your answers straight.  If TV.com says your mom's a fucking whore, you'd probably believe that shit too. "
,paris75462,2010-02-02T07:06Z,"1)  Many thanks to those who posted warring regarding the incorrect episode number.

2)  Posting an erroneously numbered episode on the same day that a new episode is release does bring motives of ?jepebrilo? into question.  However for now, jepebrilo deserves the benefit of the doubt and hence our sincere thanks for posting.  Please be more careful in your future postings. 

3)  None of you --foul-mouthed geniuses-- noticed that the video was uploaded at 15:52 GMT at the day of release.  First showing of any episode is broadcasted at 23:00 GMT (which is 8:00 PM US EST). Meaning, the file was uploaded eight hours before episode 12 was aired.  So I respectfully suggest that we all be more civil and use a more constrained language.  At least until we learn how to count, add and read a clock."
,jepebrilo,2010-02-05T11:04Z,"Our motives are simple - make things right. Right number of episode - 12, so we stick to it, despite all crowds shouting. We are small group who makes russian subtitles of House M.D. and in our release we use official fox.com episode numeration. in the begining of season was a lot of talks about right numeration, as result  all agred that imdb's numeration is wrong, but they still use the same numeration. ""Why?"" - ""No reason, it's easy"". So after guys from kubik_v_kube started to transform our subtitles to the voices, we trying to spread right numeration, we began from russia."
