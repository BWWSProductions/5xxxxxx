With a fairly dull soundtrack by rock group Goblin (who scared many a Dario Argento movie, including "Suspiria" and "Deep Red"), and with some over-the-top gross-out gore, this is one of D'Amato's more interesting films. Some consider it his best. But then, for D'Amato, that isn't necessarily saying much. He does, however, have his followers and this film enjoys pretty strong demand on the underground video circuit.

Originally released in a heavily edited version in the U.S. under the title "Buried Alive," "Buio Omega" is about a twisted young man's ongoing sexual relationship with the cadaver of his girlfriend-and the additional affair he has with a twisted, aging servant woman-the only person who seems to understand him. The two obviously had an incestuous relationship when he was just a boy and he still sucks her breast for psychological nourishment.

From the Italian mansion he inherited from his dead parents, he also kills women he stumbles across, including a fat hitchhiker he picks up and a female jogger who just happens to twist her ankle near his home. The "pay off" is a pretty silly twist ending that does deliver some laughs.

All in all, the film's a pretty interesting taste of the "video nasty" era of horror, when grossing us out was the name of the game.
