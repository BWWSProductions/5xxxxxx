Confirmed Legit."
,scoper156,2010-02-13T23:53Z,i dont know how to install it... i pressed the dlc installer but it says that mass effect 2 is not installed
,Amenoxiel,2011-01-01T05:32Z,"Hey there, thanks for the upload! Just got one problem; PhoenonX said it is legit, but what happens when I log on the Cerberus Network? Most Torrent-DLC's say that you should turn it off as it seems to match the installed DLC's with those you have unlocked on your Bioware Social Network Acc. Is this also a problem with this DLC here? Don't want to shred my Cerberus Network code over  just this...or any other ""light"" DLC's I download from here like the 3 Dr. Pepper Promos or Blood Dragon Armor from the other Torrent mentioned in the comments here. Thanks in advance for any answers."
