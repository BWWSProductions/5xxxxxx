,fredfan,2010-02-21T16:01Z,"High quality, retail version with menus.  Could be coincidence, but some weirdness occurred all should know about, at least.

Comes in .RARs, which always makes wonder when they don't save space anyhow.  Unzipped fine, but trying to play the burned DVD from the created image cause my computer to freeze twice, requiring hard reset.  The created image contains two other files not conducive to DVD playback, an .NFO and a .TXT file.

The next morning, Symantec found a cookie it considered dangerous...not terribly worrying by itself, but add them up and it's not clear why RAR's or needed or why this all came down at once.  Use a virtual machine for this one?

On the bright side, great copy of an in demand flick that DL'ed crazy fast....2Mbps for me.  WOW!"

Movies are RARed so you don't have to re-download several gigabytes if one file gets corrupted somehow. It has nothing to do with compression, and makes perfect sense.

Jesus Christ, stop complaining about the two minutes it takes you to unrar it. It could take you hours to download a 1-4 GB file that got corrupted."

You are on Piratebay now, here we use bittorrent. Error correction is an integral part of this technology. At other P2P networks there possibly is a need to use rar, notably DC, but not here. "
