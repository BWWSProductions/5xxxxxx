Review:

One of the great ironies of soundtrack collecting is that one of the most fantastic symphonic scores ever written is for a movie entitled â€œHeavy Metal.â€ The 1981 animated feature Heavy Metal (adapted from stories published in the magazine of the same name) was an adult-oriented anthology with copious amounts of sex and violence. Sporting a hit soundtrack of contemporary pop-rock songs (licensing of which delayed the filmâ€™s video release until 1996), the film also benefited from an extraordinary symphonic score by Elmer Bernstein which did the lionâ€™s share of the musical storytelling. (Bernstein was, at the time, the regular composer for producer Ivan Reitman.)

To put it simply, Heavy Metal is Elmer Bernsteinâ€™s Star Warsâ€”a rich, vital, thunderingly symphonic work bursting with melody and drive. The anthology nature of the film allowed Bernstein to write distinct melodies for the disparate segments: from the heroic anthem of â€œDenâ€ to the moody film noir stylings of â€œHarry Canyon,â€ and, especially, the soaring chorus and ondes Martenot of â€œTaarnaâ€â€”the latter adapting the composerâ€™s rejected love theme from Saturn III (1980).

Heavy Metal: The Score has long been desired by soundtrack collectors. FSM releases not only the original LP but the complete score remastered from the composerâ€™s personal 1/4â€ stereo tapes (in excellent sound quality). The cues are presented in chronological order, with bonus tracks of selections edited for the 1981 Asylum Records LPâ€”meaning listeners can, if so inclined, program a recreation of the original album sequence.
