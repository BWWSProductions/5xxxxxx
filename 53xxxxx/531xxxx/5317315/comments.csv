Hello RiddlerA,

I Have Seen The LOST Series.
So I Wanted To Thank You.

That Was Real Great Work With Such Small File Size.
Subtitles Are Great Too.

LOST Is My Favourite One And Everyone Loving This Genre Should Watch The Series.

Thanks A Lot.

,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-30T14:48Z,"EXCELLENT! Used different color fonts for different scenes of the Japanese dialogue and that was a nice touch! This Matroska Codec is amazing in it's ability to SQUEEZE the shit out of these files into small spaces, so I can get TWO flicks on a CD for storage PLUS the two soundtracks albums. This saves me massive time not having to do my own compressions with AVC plus when I was downloading this, I was 25% through adjusting the times of an .srt files for a Klaxxon release... you really NEED the Jap subs for these 2 flicks. C'mon people, more of you should jump on the Matroska bandwagon and YES... of course this plays with VLC media player on a laptop! Mine is over 10 years old, overclocked to 850MHz and it loves these files except the subs cause a slight clipping of frames during play... just turn off some unnecessary services."
,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-30T14:53Z,"If you LOVE this flick, you have to get Slaughterhouse 5! "
,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-30T15:00Z,"If you LOVE this flick, Get Grindhouse also!"
