Reach.For.The.Stars.PC.Game(djDEVASTATEâ„¢)



The original Reach For The Stars was released in 1983. It became an 
instant classic, and can fairly be said to have started a genre of 4X
(explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) space games. Now, SSG is
doing a brand new version of the game. 

The original RFTS was a hit because it contained great gameplay, 
excellent balance, tough AI, great replayability, addiction and fun, 
qualities sadly lacking from many of today's games. The new RFTS is a
great game because it retains those qualities, while expanding the 
game's scope and vastly improving the interface and graphics.
