                    Comedy featuring Scotland's string-vested,  
                    beer-guzzling sage. When a mobile phone mast  
                    appears in Govan, Rab turns rabble-rouser to  
                    fire up the community. It's driving everyone up  
                    the pole, but is it really damaging their  
                    health? Nesbitt seeks justice; the mob just  
                    want a nice bit of compensation. Featuring a  
                    guest appearance from Sanjeev Kohli.
