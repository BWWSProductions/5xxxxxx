,BADASSCRAWDADDY,2010-01-30T22:34Z,"Thanks for all the great uploads 
of Dollhouse. It was a great show the first season and half of the second. It really sucks that the writers ran out of original story lines & material which ended up getting the show the axe, This  could have been a long running series if only it had better writers and they promoted more while in its off season. Anyways looking forward to more quality ups from ""eztv'"
,Staberinde78,2010-01-30T23:01Z,"This seems to be set after the extra episode from the dvd release.  The ""previously"" clips seems to show large chunks of stuff i havent seen before in which a lot of important stuff happens.  Might be worth waiting until that episode is released if you are not wanting to spoil the ""extra"" episode."
,gullee,2010-01-31T01:01Z,They skipped one episode called Epitaph One which is going stright to dvd/blu-ray. you can actually watch it on megavideo: http://www.fanpop.com/spots/dollhouse/links/7186504/title/epitaph-one-full-episode
,DarkRedoSin,2010-02-25T22:23Z,Another excellent episode.Quality 10/10.It only took me 10 mins to download.Thanks :)
,DarkRedoSin,2010-02-25T22:59Z,"gulle, I'm sorry to say but megavideo is mega crap!You get message saying"" you have watched 72mins come back in 54mins to continue watching""Or you can pay  mega money to continue to watch.That's just rubbish taking the fact that the episode is only 49mins long and that I only got to watch 36mins.Megavideo is a mega-con!Avoid like the plague!"
