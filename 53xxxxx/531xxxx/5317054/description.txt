                     ParetoLogic Inc. RegCure v2.1.0.0 + Crack



RegCure (from ParetoLogic) provides fast and efficient scanning and cleaning of 
your registry so that your computer can run at an optimal level of performance. 
RegCure identifies invalid registry items and you decide what items you want to 
remove. After removing registry entries, you have the option to restore your 
computer to a previous state.

Protect your investment and ensure maximum PC speed and performance with RegCure 
registry cleaner. Compatible with all Microsoft products and third party 
applications, RegCure seeks out and repairs those issues in your registry that 
lead to poor performance such as remnants left behind on your registry from 
failed installations, incomplete un-installations, disabled drivers, and spyware 
applications.

RegCure enables you to fix your PC's windows registry in the way that is most 
comfortable for you. Clean your registry manually according to your own 
specifications or perform a thorough scan and clean it automatically!
The user-friendly interface allows you to monitor the progress of your scan, 
schedule RegCure to scan at the times that are best for you and will even 
manage and clean up your start up programs for you if you wish.

RegCure uses the most sophisticated technology available to analyze your registry 
for missing, obsolete, and corrupt entries. Compatible with all Microsoft products 
and third party applications, RegCure seeks out those remnants left behind on your 
registry from failed installations, incomplete un-installations, disabled drivers, 
and spyware applications.

Backup and Restore RegCure offers you peace of mind with its backup & restore 
features. If you are using Vista or Windows XP, there are two ways for you to 
protect against accidents: system restore points and backup files. Meanwhile, 
if you are using Windows 2000 (SP4), Windows 98 (SE) or Windows ME, every time 
you remove a registry item a backup file is created.



Program Shortcuts 
Incorrect program shortcuts can cause headaches! They could cause applications 
to take longer to launch or even stop them from working at all. RegCure finds 
and removes these incorrect shortcuts and improves your PCâ€™s performance.

Built-In Scheduler 
With RegCureâ€™s scheduling feature, you can just tell it when you want it to do 
its job, sit back and relax. You can set it to scan at system startup or assign 
it to work on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. You can even set up more than 
one schedule.

Invalid Class Keys and Shell Extensions
Non-working class keys and shell extensions can seriously slow down your PC and 
cause frustrations. RegCure scans to find invalid entries and remove them.

Empty Registry Keys 
Useless registry keys have no value and actually are detrimental as they can 
clog up and slow down your system. RegCure sweeps away this mess.

Automatic or Manual Repair
You can let RegCure do all the work as this sophisticated registry cleaner can 
automatically scan for and repair problems. There is also the option to take 
the power into your hands and manually guide the repair process.

Organizing Windows Startup Items 
By letting RegCure manage your Startup items, you can easily improve the startup 
speed of our PC. You can choose which programs you wish to launch when your 
computer starts and you can stop unneeded software from starting automatically. 
As well, RegCure will find and delete missing programs in the startup area of 
the Windows registry. These missing items can cause countless problems.

Shows Scan Progress 
You never have to wonder what RegCure is doing! With an easy-to-use interface, 
RegCure shows you exactly what is going on.

Removes Invalid DLL Entries
Have you been to â€œDLL hell?â€ If not, you are lucky. Invalid entries in the 
dynamic link library section of the registry can cause frustrating application 
failures. RegCure restores and repairs the registry and keeps you out of 
DLL hell.

Easy to Customize
You can easily set up RegCure to work for your needs. It can scan only the items 
you want or you can establish and manage an â€œignore listâ€ so that RegCure will 
not scan for certain items.



RegCure cleans and optimizes your Windows Registry:

- COM/ActiveX
- uninstall Entries
- Font Entries
- Shared DLLs
- Application Paths
- Help Files Information
- Windows Startup Items
- File/Path References
- Program Shortcuts
- Empty Registry Keys
- Shell Extensions
- Custom scans
- Automatic scanning with the scheduling tool
- Selection and removal
- Ignore list
- Automatic repair
- Backup and restore
- Startup management



RegCure offers the following features and benefits:

- Custom scans: you can customize how RegCure scans your registry by selecting 
  only the items you want to be scanned. There is a list of registry items that 
  you can check or clear during step 1 of the scanning process.
- Automatic scanning with the scheduling tool: with RegCure you can create 
  schedules so that a registry scan is done automatically. Using the schedule 
  feature you can set more than one schedule to run daily, weekly, monthly, at 
  system startup, and more.
- Selection and removal: You can choose which items RegCure has detected after 
  it completes the registry scan. In step 3 of the process, you can clear the 
  items that you do not want removed.
- Ignore list: RegCure offers you the ability to ignore items that have been 
  detected after the registry is scanned. In this way these items will be 
  ignored for subsequent scans. There is an Ignore list that you can manage 
  should you want to have these items scanned and removed in the future.
- Automatic repair: RegCure offers you the ability to perform an automatic 
  repair of detected items after a scan. You can configure the settings so that 
  a repair of detected items occurs after each scan.
- Backup and restore: An automatic backup is created every time you use RegCure. 
  You can restore the items that were removed.
- Startup management: RegCure offers quick and easy access to all the programs 
  that are launched when you start your computer. You can enable and disable

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

For visiting my account*:

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
