What are the instructions you followed?"
,Lennon_Lloyd,2010-02-02T20:24Z,"
I uninstalled the previous version I had first (Regcure 2.0)

- Disconnect internet during installation, and BLOCK the prog from accessing internet (block unwanted traffic by using e.g. a firewall).

- After installation make sure that RegCure (its system tray) is not running.

- Copy the cracked regcure.exe from the crack folder into the install dir of RegCure (to have it replaced with the original file).

- Now apply the regcure.reg file (double click on it and choose YES).

Done! But the program does not register on windows 7 64-bit. "
