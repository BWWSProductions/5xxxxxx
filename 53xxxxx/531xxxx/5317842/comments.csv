,TheAwesome2012,2010-01-30T21:09Z,"Lets see here LW.

Most of your rips you label DvDrip are R5's right? Now do you physically rip the R5 to your PC and sync it up with the correct audio? Cos if you don't you gotta be 'stealing' or borrowing someones original audio or video file. You can say you re-encoded it all you like but somewhere down the line you borrowed something from someone and not even giving the proper credit."
,LH-oswald,2010-01-30T21:52Z,"and where do you think emery gets his movies,thats right he rips other peoples and does a bit of ajusting here and there without even a thanks to whoever he took the film off"
,TheAwesome2012,2010-01-30T22:09Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5271701/Its.Complicated.2010.DVDSCR.XviD-Emery

Look at the nfo on that Emery IS giving credit where it is due and lets the fact be known that he at least borrowed (Stole w/e) it from another website and is making it more public on TPB as it is more popular. His DvDrips aren't mislabeled and it is feasible that he has ripped most of his DvDrips as the dates he uploaded the DvDrip coincide with the dates that the actual DvD is released.

However.

LW's release of the R5 copy of The men who stare at goats have me more than convinced that LW didn't physically rip the R5 and mended the audio to it but he rather stole/borrowed it from another uploader without giving them credit.

All in all Emery DOES give credit where it is due and you failed to even do your homework on that LH-oswald."
,XoLWoX,2010-01-30T22:15Z,stop this shit in my comments if it's not about the quality don't say anything about it
,TheAwesome2012,2010-01-30T22:20Z,"He took a shot at Emery and I pointed out how wrong he was about Emery not giving 'credit'.

LH-oswald if you wanna bitch off at Emery go and find fault with one of his torrents and comment a few on there.

Leave LW's torrents comments for Knock to point out flaws in :)"
,XoLWoX,2010-01-30T22:22Z,knock can go to hell with all the other haters that have nothing else to do but look at whats wrong with other people's torrents---------

,genghis_mom,2010-02-01T16:47Z,"Thanks for the up!
Excellent quality, but I didn't really like the movie. "
,keygun,2010-02-20T23:46Z,"Why did you even post this as a 'dvdrip' when you just said you polished a br rip? You can polish a turd all you want, but it's still a piece of shit. If it's a damn br rip, label it as one. Maybe if you do things the right way, people wont slam you in the comments... Like this... You piece of shit faggot retard diarrhea breath dog fucker. Go swallow a knife."
