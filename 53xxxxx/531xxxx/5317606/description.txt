The official bowling simulation of the Professional Bowler's Association, 
PBA Bowling 2 brings the excitement of one of America's best-loved pastimes 
to your PC! With a realistic physics model, fully modeled 3D bowlers, and the 
highly accurate ball, lane and pin physics, you'll think it's Friday night at 
the local lanes!

PBA 2 allows you to fully customize lane conditions and the weight, color 
and texture of your ball.  You can even customize your bowler right down to 
their size, weight, shirt color, and favorite ball. 

Using a state-of-the-art 3D graphics engine, PBA 2 serves up improved
physics modeling and more realistic graphics.  The game features
full-motion skeletal models of bowlers in 3D to create a realistic
bowling experience.  In addition, the bowler will have complete control
over the ball's spin, power, and aim.  To add to the game's realism, the
lanes in PBA 2 will actually degrade, showing signs of wear and tear the
more the player bowls. 

PBA 2 allows for several modes of game play.  Players can warm-up,
practice their strategy, or critique style in the game's practice mode. 
The game also allows the player to play an individual game or a team
game, with friends or computer opponents.
