,jon4fun,2010-01-29T12:02Z,"Thanks 20-40.

To all downloaders, please SEED and no limits on speed.
OR this show will go away and we'll be back to large files from some other uploader.

Cheers
Jon "

If you have not, there is no other way then to try it. I had some ""iPod compliance test"" torrent, but he was deleted like most of my work when ""mini went nova""."

,lilars26,2010-01-29T16:11Z,Thanks for this.I'm having trouble connecting at times but I'm pretty sure it has to do with my port configuration.I'm working on it.
,pratik922,2010-01-29T16:19Z,Hey thanks man! Keep uploading em
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-29T16:21Z,"Guys, PROPER has been released, with short explanation:
QUOTE
""IMMERSE's release has drops with missing audio and video 23:26-23:28 and
25:28-25:31.""

As some of you know, I have no time to watch all shows (especially in entirety) and - how-in-hell should I know are few seconds ( 2 + 3, LOL) missing or not.

So please, drop me a comment about . do we really need a PROPER?

Sorry, but it has nothing to do with me. "
,lilars26,2010-01-29T16:56Z,This is fine for me.Thanks again.
,jon4fun,2010-01-29T19:18Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for letting us know about the 'glitches' in the show. Nothing you could do about it as I know you do not watch these shows and only encode/upload for your fans.

I?ve watched the time stamps for the 2 glitches and thye do NOT affect overall storyline. They occur in conversations that are not between main characters but the glitch is small.

Please do use up the upload slots you have just to fix 4 seconds of show. Unnecessary and I think that a most people will understand why. I personally would NOT DL 'Proper' release anyway as my DL allowance is too tight.

Again, thank you for informng us (the fans) and for those who want to bitch about this, please DON'T. 20-40 encodes these shows from other sources as a REQUEST. He DOESN'T watch them. Go to the original sources, easy to find, and bitch to them about not checking their uploads.

Jon"
,stev666,2010-01-30T02:57Z,Just watched the episode and the glitch is so small it doesn't bother me and I'm sure it won't bother you. Thanks 20-40
