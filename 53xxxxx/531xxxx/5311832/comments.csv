just open the movie with vlc and the subs should appear in the drop down menus"

Aim for the 2 dc subs, just as the videos in this torrent."

.Bone's subs didnt work"
,elcapizzo,2010-08-08T14:52Z,"Good quality audio/video 10/10

Had some minor stuttering issues playing it on the DVD player via my external USB Hard drive- however I dont think it was because of this file.

Subtitles included did NOT work- however I downloaded the one's that kumbandit linked and they did work (well- 98%, had some small issues with the ""E"" shown as ""B"" and ""P"" shown as ""R"" with our DVD player).

Awesome movie. I really enjoyed this. A must for anyone who enjoys animated movies. This is a tad violent/graphic at times though, so definitely not safe for young kids to watch. 13+ recommended."

Shame about the subs but an exellent movie.

These subs are good but as the above comment says, there are a few parts in the movie where the letters a tiny bit mixed but very understandable nevertheless. Watch this movie."
