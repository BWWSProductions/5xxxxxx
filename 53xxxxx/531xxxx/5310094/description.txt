Dire Straits were a British rock band, active between 1977 and 1995. The band was formed by Mark Knopfler (vocals and lead guitar), his younger brother David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and vocals), and Pick Withers (drums and percussion), and managed by Ed Bicknell. Although the band was formed in an era when punk rock was at the forefront, Dire Straits played a more conventional style, albeit with a stripped-down sound that appealed to audiences also weary of the overproduced stadium rock of the 1970s. In their early days, Mark and David requested that pub owners turn down their sound so that patrons could converse while the band played, an indication of their unassuming demeanor. Despite this oddly self-effacing approach to rock and roll, Dire Straits soon became hugely successful, with their first album going multi-platinum globally.
Throughout Dire Straits' career Mark Knopfler was the songwriter and also the driving force behind the group. The band's best-known songs include "Sultans of Swing", "Romeo and Juliet", "Tunnel of Love", "Telegraph Road", "Private Investigations", "Money for Nothing", "Walk of Life", "So Far Away", "Brothers in Arms","On Every Street" and "Calling Elvis". Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler have sold in excess of 120 million albums to date.

Sultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits, named after their 1978 hit single, is the second hits compilation of Dire Straits. It was originally released as both a one disc edition and two disc edition in August 1998. The second disc contains live performances.

The compilation was re-released together with a DVD in 2002. The DVD features the music videos of all the songs on the first disc, in addition to short interviews with Mark Knopfler about each song.
