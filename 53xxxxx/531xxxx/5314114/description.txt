Storyline: 

 Mathilda, a twelve-year old New York girl, is living an undesirable life among her half-family.
 Her father stores drugs for two-faced cop Norman Stansfield. Only her little brother keeps Mathilda
 from breaking apart. One day, Stansfield and his team take cruel revenge on her father for stretching 
 the drugs a little, thus killing the whole family. Only Mathilda, who was out shopping, survives by
 finding shelter in Lâ”œâŒon's apartment in the moment of highest need. Soon, she finds out about the
 strange neighbour's unusual profession - killing - and desperately seeks his help in taking revenge
 for her little brother. Lâ”œâŒon, who is completely unexperienced in fatherly tasks, and in friendships,
 does his best to keep Mathilda out of trouble - unsuccessfully. Now, the conflict between a killer, 
 who slowly discovers his abilities to live, to feel, to love and a corrupt police officer, who does 
 anything in his might to get rid of an eye witness, arises to unmeasurable proportions - all for the 
 sake of a little twelve-year old girl, who has nearly nothing to lose
