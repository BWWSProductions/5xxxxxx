All of the location subtitles and chapter marks are interfering with the in-movie texts.
Bothers me a bit, but I'm still grateful for a HD version of this awesome film.
Thank you for ripping and/or uploading."

,pezed,2011-02-26T22:13Z,"Thank you. I'm new to this. How long should a person seed for after downloading? My client just says awaiting requests and the outgoing stopped. Are AVI-AC3 the better files to download? 
Thanks again this was great."
