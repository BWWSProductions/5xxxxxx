,Redeku,2010-03-22T04:58Z,"If you can put yourself in the right state of mind while listening... you can't just listen and expect results. From what I've done it has helped my concentration somewhat day to day, and while I'm listening to it reach a trippy state of mind."
,samljer,2010-05-15T09:36Z,"Make no mistake these are real
and some powerful ones exist, specifically
try the I-DOSER torrent. its 2.5gb 

Theres some on there that will get you, first time, every time, new or not.

One of them made me even heave and feel sick and wanna throw up.

SRS stuff, and its on the legit.
Find the beneficial ones, and it will improve your life!"
,en0nym0us,2010-07-28T03:13Z,I listened to this and I had to go pee.
,1levitron,2010-11-22T00:48Z,This isn't a binaural beat... It's running water... Why would you intentionally mislabel this?
,mgpai,2010-11-29T09:29Z,"@1levitron

These are binaural beats generated using SBaGen. Feel free to analyse check using BAVSA. "

,sevenfoldcircle,2011-03-27T06:00Z,"OK - so I've been using TPB for like a year ... and I just set up an account so that I could leave a comment on this torrent. IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME. I must be really in tune with my mind or something, because this worked for me first time. I followed some advice on the I-DOSER torrent (but it was going to take way to long to download and I was impatient) and by the time I was half way through I was in deep meditation. Kudos to you mgpai!"
,jyanendra,2011-06-15T01:42Z,"Amazing - I did not think these thing really worked but this one did. 
The very first time too.
I had a distinctly sensed ""in the now"" feeling.
Will use it often."
