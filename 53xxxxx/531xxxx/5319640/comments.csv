IS THIS THE CULTURE U GOT FROM UR PARENTS?nnAre u happy with ur soul doing all this kind of odd jobs? Im not saying u to grow up! Just saying that widen ur thoughts! STOP BLAMING OTHERS PROPHETS!nnAnd one more thing! if u were me and were writing this message, you would have definitely used abusive words! THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE!"
