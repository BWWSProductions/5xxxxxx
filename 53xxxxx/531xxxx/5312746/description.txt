           When Earth's superheroes exile the volatile Incredible         
           Hulk to a distant planet called Sakaar, the muscle-bound       
           green monster is sold into slavery and forced to compete       
           in gladiatorial games for the planet's despotic Red King.      
           But soon, the Hulk joins forces with his fellow slaves to      
           fight for freedom -- and a chance to get revenge on his        
           earthly foes. This animated film is based on the "Planet       
           Hulk" storylines originally featured in Marvel comics.
