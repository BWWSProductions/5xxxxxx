Thank you very much"
,grandy88,2010-01-30T15:54Z,"I will be getting to Season 2 very shortly.  Let me know what you guys want, if you want higher quality 720p, or I can do 1080p if there's demand."
,grandy88,2010-01-30T16:21Z,"Oops, just noticed my typo on episode 25.  Sorry about that."
,reever,2010-01-31T16:17Z,Thanks very much for this! The size is ideal and it's nice to have the extras. Season 2 would be much appreciated if you can do it.
,grandy88,2010-01-31T16:55Z,"Working on Season 2 now, about halfway done.  Should be ready in two or three days."

Same file quality and all bonus features."
,bytes2000,2010-02-03T19:43Z,What are the spoken languages ? Does it includes subtitles ?
,grandy88,2010-02-03T20:00Z,"Just English, no subs."
,reever,2010-02-03T20:16Z,"No subs? I only have one complete episode from this but it has English, French and Spanish subs."
,grandy88,2010-02-06T05:37Z,"I did subs for the first few episodes I did, but stopped because I didn't think many would want them.  If there is a desire for the subs I can do them.  Let me know."
,bakufu,2010-02-12T03:36Z,Anyway possible to get those subs. English is fine :) Thanks for great torrent!
,grandy88,2010-02-12T06:36Z,"Season 3 is available - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5356270/Lost.Season_3.720p.BluRay.x264

You may have to be patient at first, I think I burned through most of my bandwidth with the first two.

I'll work on subs after I finish seasons 4 and 5. "

,b4c0n,2010-04-20T19:10Z,It seems the audio track on Episode 8 is actually the audio track from Episode 9.  Anyone else notice this issue?
,grandy88,2010-04-24T22:05Z,"b4c0n, I don't have that issue with those episodes."
,grandy88,2010-04-24T22:07Z,"Hey guys, sorry for the crazy long delay, but I'm going to start ripping seasons 4 and 5 now.  I'll comment again when it's up!"

! just finished watching the 1st season and started with 2nd season, I hope use could upload the subs of S02 soon 

BTW, hey people seed, At least seed until you complete watching the season"
,VSG12777,2010-09-18T18:13Z,"hi Grandy88

Lost Season 1 and 2 are nearing completion and I tested out the Pilot episode. I find that Season 1 blu ray originally came with DTS-HD-MA audio, so how come you have provided only DD 5.1 audio for your 6 seasons ?

Also, any idea where I can get full sets of subtitles for seasons 1-5 ?"
,alexxianca,2010-10-09T20:35Z,"first thanks for the upload

,Coldblackice,2011-02-17T11:02Z,"How could we go about getting the director's commentary for these blu-ray rips?

Obviously I'm not asking grandy to re-rip everything, I'm just wondering if it would be possible to incorporate the commentary track into this file if we were to find/rip it from somewhere?

Thanks!"
,Seeal,2011-02-22T02:49Z,Seed please.
,coffeeboy2k,2011-04-12T04:10Z,"After 5 weeks and 6 days, I'm finally done downloading this. So I guess with any luck, I'll have all seasons by Halloween. Thanks a bunch."
,Hancock79,2011-05-02T08:08Z,"guys looking for subs:

it's fairly easy to find subs on the net for even the most obscure shows.  most of the time you will find that the descriptions on subtitle sites will even match up with the release names you download here.  i like www.subscene.com, opensubtitles.com(or org i forget) is popular too.

i'd imagine that's why alot of groups don't even release subs, they're already out there"
,ben.k,2011-06-24T20:04Z,seed please!!
,maxthulin,2011-10-06T15:48Z,"English subtitles synched by ME personally made especially for this release found here: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6725151

They are all synched by me personally so i can guarantee that they are 100% correct!

Enjoy!"
,Enolena,2011-12-25T15:14Z,"grandy88, thank you so much for uploading the very best torrent of Lost that I've been able to find.  You are greatly appreciated!"
,richj2k,2012-02-14T13:07Z,Really crisp quality upload! Recommended torrent. Thanks man.
,eumaios,2012-02-22T17:26Z,Thanks so much for this!
,Mehmetaliumac,2012-02-29T21:53Z,"I only got the  ""GET THIS TORRENT"" button?"
,Rezol,2012-03-07T16:53Z,"http://i.minus.com/ibwa6RiG9WBGbn.PNG

Anybody else got this? Look at the fire too. It only appears on moving objects, Locke who's sitting still doesn't have any stripes.

Is this a problem with my screen or media player settings, since noone else seems to complain about it?"
,4rct,2012-03-07T17:54Z,"Great quality, thanks.

Rezol: Activate deinterlacing in media player."
,Rezol,2012-03-07T20:57Z,4rct: Thanks. So is interlacing a bug or a feature?
,4rct,2012-03-07T22:21Z,"It's not a bug but a video technique. 
Is that capture from an episode? Only the extras are interlaced, the episodes are progressive."
,Rezol,2012-03-08T20:04Z,"Yeah, that's from the extras. Only the shortest deleted scenes and auditions are finished so I checked them for quality. Should I deactivate deinterlacing when watching episodes?"
,4rct,2012-03-10T21:27Z,"Yeah, deactivate it."
,Coldblackice,2012-06-19T09:25Z,"Ahh I just figure out what the problem is, why the Extras appear interlaced and why media players won't deinterlace them -- 

Grandy88 encoded them as Progressive, when they're actually Interlaced. Although the main episodes are progressive, these extras should have been encoded as interlaced. I wish there was a way to change a ""flag"" in the clip to change it from Progressive to Interlaced, so that media players correctly deinterlace the clips (to get rid of those jaggy lines on motion), but unfortunately, the only way to do this is to re-rip and encode the video from the blurays :("
,Coldblackice,2012-06-19T09:26Z,"Grandy88 (or anyone) -- do you happen to still have the blurays, that perhaps you could re-rip the extras content as Interlaced?"
,LORDLORD,2012-07-10T18:13Z,any good english subs here ?
