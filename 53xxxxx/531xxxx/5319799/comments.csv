,michaelingeorgia,2010-01-30T14:13Z,"MINI REVIEW:
On the DVD cover, The Edge may appear to be just a run-of-the-mill ""thriller"". That's just the marketing ploy. Penned by screen and theatre writer David Mamet, it's a far more subtle and complex film, with tension created by the motivations of the characters rather than merely the needs of the plot. Indeed, in almost all of Mamet's films, plot is secondary to character, and it is no less so here. Anthony Hopkin's portrayal of a billionaire with a unique ability to recall almost everything he's read is spot on. It's not a ""nail biter"" in the conventional thriller sense, but it's a film that you won't want to leave once it has gotten started. (Grade: B+)"
