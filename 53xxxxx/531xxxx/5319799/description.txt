Charles Morse is a silver-haired billionaire, and the husband of a much-younger wife, Mickey, a beautiful model. She and an entourage arrange to travel to Alaska for a photo shoot, and persuade Charles to accompany them. They all have seemingly forgotten that it is also Charles' birthday, until a surprise party reveals that they had not. A hint of trouble comes when Robert Green (Bob), the fashion photographer, plants a quick, albeit public, kiss on the cheek of his model, Charles' beautiful wife, then she quickly winks affectionately at her onlooking husband, who nonetheless looks troubled by this interaction.
