,fairytales,2010-04-09T20:08Z,"thx Mr. NLRedneck , but pls soft remarks will be nice , I work with the computers for programing and Hardware as well since 1987 , The case is that . I am not afraid of viruses or malwares , I use images for the operating system and backup nearly all may download , I have no virus or malware detection as I told u , I dont care if the computer crashes or even the whole HD errased , but thx for the remark as I will put both these 2 bad uploaders in my black list ."
