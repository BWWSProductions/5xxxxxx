The video begins with Allen pulling up to a junkyard in a white pickup truck at night, with a watch hanging from his key chain. Then, Allen takes a power cord out of the back of the truck and carries it through the junkyard until he plugs it in and flips a switch to turn on a large countdown clock. As the clock reaches zero, Allen leaves and begins walking away from the camera as the sun rises. Throughout the video, Allen is shown playing both an acoustic guitar and a piano, as well as singing without any instruments.
