However the episodes are incorrectly numbered from the 2000's episodes - check the catalogue."
,wolffe5,2011-03-08T06:44Z,SEED! I'll be seeding for years.
,wolffe5,2011-03-09T17:07Z,"Thank you. about 80% complete.

Some of them are terrible quality but I guess since it was recorded in the 90's etc what can you do?

Just turn it up loud and you should be able to make out what people are saying no problem.

RIP Bill Cooper. I'll be seeding this forever."
