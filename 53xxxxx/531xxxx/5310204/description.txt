Hi Everyone

In this video Dr. Bilal Philips raises a few questions which
we can use to judge to what degree do we know who our Lord is.

1. Do you agree with those who say who say that belief is a matter of blind faith ?

2. If everything has a Creator then who created God?

3. If God can do anything, why can't He have a son?

4. If God is all-powerful, can He create a stone which is too heavy for Him to lift ?

5. If God is all-good and He is able to do all things then where
did evil come from?

Dr. Bilal Philips will address these questions and clear the
many false ideas and misconceptions many people have
when it comes to their Lord .
