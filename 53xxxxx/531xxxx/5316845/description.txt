Please seed (share) these programs. Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks.

Do you ever wish that the Windows system tray clock could show seconds as part of its display? 

Would you like to see the date shown next to the clock, instead of having to place your mouse cursor over it to see it in a tooltip? 

You need TClockEx, a utility that hooks into the system tray clock to let you see more than just the current time. You can display the date in long, short, and custom formats and see the time in system or custom formats with a seconds toggle.

The date can go in front of the time, or vice-versa. 

Also included is a bar to represent the amount of RAM in use. Because the additional elements are shown in the same font and style as the existing system tray clock, they blend in perfectly. 

TClockEx is so good that its functionality should be in the next version of Windows..
