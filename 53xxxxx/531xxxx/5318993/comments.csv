,Kolbath,2010-04-11T20:38Z,"This torrent has the Kolbath Seal of Approval!

I recently paid (a reduced price, but still paid) for Office 2007, only to find that it refuses to install on my system. OpenOffice has been a nightmare. 

With the recent theft of a laptop and most of my recovery disks, I despaired... until the GrimReaper arrived. 

Excellent job, mate. ZERO problems with install. Thank you.
