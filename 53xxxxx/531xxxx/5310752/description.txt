The 53rd and final show of the Allman Brothers Band's 40th Anniversary Tour was a joyous celebration that encompassed everything good about this band.  This was an old-school setlist, without any songs written after 1970, but the electric performances make everything sound brand new all over again.

A combo of "The Same Thing" and "Stormy Monday" paid homage to the band's blues roots, while the Derek and the Dominoes classic "Anyday" and Delaney and Bonnie's "Only You Know And I Know" paid tribute to the rich musical legacy of Duane Allman.  "In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed" crackles with life, taking advantage of its unusual placement as a first set closer to really stand out as a highlight.  Derek and Warren were surely making Duane proud on this one!  

The second set began with a vicious "Don't Keep Me Wonderin'" that got things rolling quickly.  This "Dreams" is another incredible performance by the band, the culmination of a tour that saw many amazing versions of the song.  "Black Hearted Woman" was another consistent highlight of the 40th Anniversary celebration, and this one isn't fooling around!

Despite the long tour, the ABB seemed to have extra gas in the tank for this one, kicking into a massive, epic "Mountain Jam>Smokestack Lightning>Mountain Jam" sandwich when the show was already nearing the two hour mark!  The encore was the double whammy of "Melissa" and "Whipping Post," with the gentle sounds of the first setting up the perfect contrast for the unbridled fury of the second.  Gregg sounds equally excellent on both songs, showing the remarkable vocal strength that has been a hallmark of this year.

This is a three disc show and a great way to end a great tour!  May the road go on forever.
