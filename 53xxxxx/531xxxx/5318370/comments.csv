But do what you like mate. I just think us uploaders should support one another, rather than work against each other. It serves the downloaders better."
,sonofdog,2010-03-24T00:22Z,"I think this is the original up, but I dl's one posted a couple of days ago and I can't find it now. If it's the same it will have a couple of brief digi freezups but otherwise good quality. Although frequently grainy this is just one of the may visual subplots to support the spoof nature of the movie.

As for the movie itself I really enjoyed it, it was payback for all those terrible black movies that I have suffered over so many years. I smiled all the way through, it was as though all that suffering was just to set up the punchline. This film is redemption from the blaxploitation crap I was fed as a child, and it is actualy very funny ( and I'm white)!

The film is intellectually unbias and a total sendup of its genre, I loved it even though it is difficult to sustain. On the whole I think they managed to achieve their comic objectives. Whatever, get a good copy cuz you'll probably want to see it again.

I also loved the music. As a singer myself I thought the backing music was spot on and would have loved to have been in on that laugh.

Black Dynamite is awsumnly giggly shit.
