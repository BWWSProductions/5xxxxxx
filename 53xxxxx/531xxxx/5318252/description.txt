The last days of queen Marie Antoinette stunningly portrayed by a director who's clearly done a massive historical research. Andre Castelot, author of one of the best queen's biographies, penned such a beautiful, accurate screenplay based on the trial papers. Ute Lemper is simply perfect as Antoinette (the actress' mother language is German, just like the queen's, and that adds something special when you hear her musical French). Terrific production, lighting and costumes make this a beautiful visual experience. Historical accurancy at its best in a very passional and moving rendering.
