the tutorials are from http://psd.tutsplus.com/
someone has already compiled 10 of them in a torrent. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5188819/10_Awesome_Photoshop_Tutorials


At the very least montakiri could have put all 10 in a torrent, so people can choose which one they want to download.


if you can't find what you want then go to the website.

either pay for the pdf, use adobe to create the pdf yourself or save the webpages as a web archive."
