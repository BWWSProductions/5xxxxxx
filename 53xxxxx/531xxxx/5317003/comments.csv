,user2101,2010-02-22T14:19Z,"PLEASEEEEE Big Dude, can you upload the following games?:
- Silent Hill Origins
- Resident Evil 4, Outbreak 1&2
- Enter the Matrix
- Syphon Filter Dark Mirror
- Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary, Underworld

I think you have uploaded other games except for them, it would complete the sagas.

Thanks a lot, and I wish you could upload at least some of them.

And yeah, Maximun Impact would be great. =D"
