we have a much improved line-up in a 6.88GB CDG offering (or 4.8GB zipped)  which makes the older versions obsolete, and with many great additions plus better versions substitutions too. 

The complete 6.88GB cdg offerings is our best yet! unzipped cd+g and rar zipped
7.5GB Divx versions can be found on the net. These versions are vastly improved from our previous collections. The DivX offerings are improved with 1100k bitrate and are individually compressed into rar files for you.

This Grease collection is a conversion from a Karaoke disc we picked up at a discount store nearby. It was ten bucks to begin with and they lowered it from there!

Its "Performers Choice" offering of the complete Grease soundtrack in Karaoke. We used 160kb mp3s for this conversion so they can still sell their disc if anyone wants "more" for their professional needs. It comes from the Sound Choice label.


enjoy! We'll have a new DJ lineup soon (we wont be using zip files as we know they can get damaged in transmission a lot more easily since error checking is not foolproof it would appear on these file formats).
