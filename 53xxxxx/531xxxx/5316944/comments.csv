,HazardX,2010-01-31T18:01Z,"If you are on Mac use DVD_Boot_Mac _Only.zip. Inside there is one kernel and two extensions.mkext.
Unpack it on desktop (inside DVD_Boot foleder unpack one of the Extensions.mkex or kernel) , copy Image on desktop and run script to add extenions.mkext or kernel in to DVD, burn DVD on DVD-RW and try to install.
It will work 100%. One more thing is did you set everything in bios the way it should be?

Forum should be online in about a week if I'm lucky. 

That's all from me . See you all soon."

,rh287,2010-02-04T18:36Z,Took me 4 hours but finally got it right! WOW! Runs perfect. OS X 6.2! Everything works...even my Nvidea eithernet. Never was able to get that to work had to go with a wireless card with iDeneb and IPC. Board: 680I SLI Nvidea 6600GTS card...Just plug and this one will download and install your drivers..Like my printer..etc...GREAT JOB HAZARD!
,rh287,2010-02-04T18:42Z,Oh by the way..I installed via USB 8 Gig stick. You can also try Empire EFI then choose your USB stick and start the install. That's what worked for me. Also have Q6600 Quad @3.2 GHZ all cores running perfect.
,gzahl,2010-02-04T19:59Z,"@rh287: How did you put the Image on the USB Stick? I tried Macs Disk Utility, but it didn't work. Thanks!"
,rh287,2010-02-04T23:38Z,"Hi I just used restore from disk utilities. I was running IPC 10.5.6. Thats easy top install...just drag your Snow Leopard DMG into source and the flash drive into destination and restore. Read here..http://www.taranfx.com/install-snow-leopard-on-pc-easy...try this to get this distro on flash drive...then use EMPIRE EFI to install..instead of installing DVD just choose your USB stick using arrow keys and type -v cpus=1 to install...After install, type -v -f and you should boot into LS. And everything works right out of the box. Don't add any sound drivers or lan drivers...they are already in the install."
