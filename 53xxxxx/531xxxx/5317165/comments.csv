,mdimasso,2010-02-23T01:32Z,I can only get the English language and subtitles to work. I'm using VLC and I also burned a DVD to check.

You're right - I made these ISOs a few years ago and forgot that I had removed the extra languages since I saw no use for them at the time.  I have corrected the listing details accordingly.  Thanks for the heads-up mdimasso!"

,hentai_sama,2010-08-08T02:43Z,"Well, first of all, thanks for uploading this.
It's a great series of the W-man.

And now, the critic.

I can understand stripping the additional audio tracks cuz they consume space, but why in the hell you remove the subs?
They almost don't use any space, and more people can enjoy this.
Since there's no spanish subs (like the menu says it was), my sci-fi geek mom can't see this because she don't understand english..."
