Double-episodes, requests or Pilot ep. will be issued only as MP4 or 360p.
MP4 is ISO 14496-1(H264 video & AAC LC sound) and playable on PCs, Macs and hopefully (read Comment before download; I check every file for iTunes compliance) on iPod-like portable-mobile devices.Due to small frame-size recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768.
360p is fully compatible with newer iPod, iTouch and Nokia U97. 
Requests should be posted in Comments section of newest torrents.
"Out of schedule" shows or pilot-episodes may get uploaded randomly, if situation arise (free slots).


I recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.
VLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.
One can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.
QuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.
Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.

WARNING: 

If you limit your upload speed during the download FOR WHATEVER REASON, youâ€™ll be kicked-out for good. I am sick and tired not only of Hit&Run, but of 90% who think Iâ€™m some kind of â€œfree launchâ€ downloading service. NO â€“ ITâ€™S ABOUT SHARING. If you do not want or can or care to share, please, go someplace else. Consider this as one friendly warning. 


Also, in the future, if I spot something like gang-banging of innocents, youâ€™ll feel my response, I promise. If you are not satisfied with things Iâ€™ve just said, please â€“ go away. Internet is a Big place for all of us. And donâ€™t come back. Please.

What goes around comes around. Give and youâ€™ll be given.

I am a sort of refugee from â€œminimalistic-was-a-starâ€. Many of my friends, my â€œRegularsâ€ came on TPB following my torrents. It takes a long time not just to make people to â€œrecognizeâ€ my small-sized stuff, but to adopt specific models of behaviour, when they interact, cooperate one with each other, exchange and, at the end, enjoy shows and movies. 

One thing I have always repeated: Solidarity. We, people from â€œDeveloped countriesâ€ seem like have forgotten too easy what was only five-six years back when majority was on dial-up, wrestling with 2-4 kB/s. 

We also forget how hard is to live far away from all cultural, sociological â€œcushionsâ€ our societies have provided for us, be surrounded with unbearable hardness of life, live surrounded by unimaginable poverty, diseases â€“ and a feeling of total disconnection from the rest of the â€œshinyâ€ world, where obviously, no one cares about anything else but themselves. We, who have â€œmoreâ€ must share with the ones who have lessâ€. Must. Other â€œtypesâ€ of behaviour are not welcomed â€“ here. People who cannot share could go away, doors are open. Trespassers and punks will be escorted someplace else.

We are the rebels by nature, thatâ€™s why we are here on place called â€œPirate bayâ€â€¦ not to eat each otherâ€™s hearts out. We are here because world around is a dark place. People who come here are not the enemies, most of us struggle to survive, and taking just that and that much we need not to feel deprived by injustice. We are here to fight unrighteousness, but not amongst us. Never forget that.
