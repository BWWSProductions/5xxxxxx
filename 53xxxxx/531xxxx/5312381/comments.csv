,ninja2177,2010-02-18T05:29Z,"awesome, but one more question, how do i download them individually? i am using utorrent and it isnt letting me pick? thanks again"
,jkwq,2010-03-28T05:31Z,"o my...

@ ninja2177,

- double-click on the torrent to open it.
- uncheck the ones u don want

or

- when uTorrent start downloading it, select the ones u don wan, right-click, n select Don't Download.


if above solutions can't help i suggest u might as well save up n buy them straight from Digital Tutors :D"
,enerses,2010-04-07T22:35Z,"The torrents within this torrent all seem to be dead. I have torrents d/ling for intro to animation, dynamics 1 & 2 and maya muscle and all have 0 seeds. Any suggestions?"

Amazing effort keep it up.

Only these are not seeded :

* 4 - 1- Animating Cartoon Characters in Maya

* 4 - 3- Mastering Maya Render Nodes

* 6 - 4- mental ray in Maya- Rendering Workflow

Rest are rocking. Thanks a lot again."

Are the actual tutorials in here or just the audio files?"
,Thalarian,2011-07-04T02:02Z,Anyone else seem to have issues with the speed? I have yet to have a single one of these torrents hit over 20kbs. It took two days to even download Python Scripting.
,Robohotic,2011-07-10T07:23Z,"Does anyone have a demonoid account... I'll be glad if someone would send me an invite... it has more zbrush tutorials which I cannot download due to free registration being full.
