The Free, Cross-Platform Sound Editor

AudacityÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® is free, open source software for recording and editing sounds.
It is available for Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, and other operating systems.

Because it is a work in progress and does not yet come with complete documentation or translations into different languages, it is recommended for more advanced users.

For all users, Audacity 1.2.6 is a stable release, complete and fully documented. You can have Audacity 1.2.6 and 1.3.11 installed on the same machine.


Features

This is a list of features in Audacity, the free audio editor.

Recording

Audacity can record live audio through a microphone or mixer, or digitize recordings from cassette tapes, vinyl records, or minidiscs.
With some sound cards, it can also capture streaming audio.


Record from microphone, line input, or other sources.

Dub over existing tracks to create multi-track recordings.

Record up to 16 channels at once (requires multi-channel hardware).

Level meters can monitor volume levels before, during, and after recording.



Import and Export

Import sound files, edit them, and combine them with other files or new recordings. Export your recordings in several common file formats.


Import and export WAV, AIFF, AU, and Ogg Vorbis files.

Import MPEG audio (including MP2 and MP3 files) with libmad.

Export MP3s with the optional LAME encoder library.

Create WAV or AIFF files suitable for burning to CD.

Import and export all file formats supported by libsndfile.

Editing

New features in Audacity 1.3

Beta version

Audacity 1.3 Beta is our new, not quite finished, development version which will be the basis of our next "stable" version.


Contains dozens of new, exciting features. Very occasionally, these might need final polishing or not be retained in later versions.

Occasionally, a feature might not work as it did before, or might be temporarily disabled.

Some parts of the program are not yet documented or translated into different languages.



Changelog:


The Audacity Team is pleased to announce the release of Audacity 1.3.11 (Beta) for Windows, Mac and Linux/Unix. This release fixes a number of bugs reported to us in 1.3.10. Thank you to everyone who sent us feedback.


We dedicate this release to David R.Sky who passed away in October 2009.
David did some great work on Audacity plug-ins and his work lives on today in our program. He provided assistance to all who needed help. We shall miss him.


1.3.11 has provisional support for Windows 7 and is also strongly recommended for Windows Vista and Mac OS X 10.6, rather than 1.2 Stable.
We ask everyone to help us test 1.3.11 and let us know of any problems you find.


Summary of Changes in 1.3.11:


Bug fixes for:

Too much audio exported when exporting partial selections

Exports via FFmpeg corrupted if included metadata; M4A now supports metadata export

Nyquist plug-ins did not add labels to an existing label track

Crash opening Preferences when no audio devices available

Timer Record and Sound Activated Recording bugs

Miscellaneous crashes and interface issues


Improvements:

New Sound Finder plug-in for labelling regions of audio



Changes in Audacity 1.3.11


Bug fixes for:

Imports and Exports:

Bug when exporting partial selections caused too much audio to be exported is fixed

Fix corrupt files exported through FFmpeg when metadata included (metadata is now exported correctly in M4A files)

Prevent saving a new Audacity Project over an existing one as this could corrupt both projects
        * Improved help for files that cannot be imported because the relevant optional library is missing


Effects:

Allow effects which change the length of the audio they work on to also be applied to selected label tracks, thus keeping them synchronized

Fixed inability in Nyquist plug-ins to add labels to an existing label track

(Mac)  Equalization window was corrupted after Preview


Audio Devices:

Fixed bug causing recording to stop short when the recording sample rate is not supported by the sound device and libsamplerate is used for resampling

Fix crash when opening Preferences on a machine where there are no available audio devices

Fixes for bugs using Timer Record and Sound Activated Recording


User Interface:

Sizes of some dialogs adjusted to ensure they fit on the screen

Fix for supposedly "hidden" items appearing on screen with large monitors

Various keyboard shortcut and translation fixes


Other bug fixes:

Several timing-dependent crashes and minor incorrect behaviours have been fixed



Changes and improvements:

New SoundFinder plug-in to label regions of audio between silences, so allowing silences between tracks to be excluded when exporting multiple
