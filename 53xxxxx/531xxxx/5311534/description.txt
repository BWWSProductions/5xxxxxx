The Big Clock portrays a sterotyped robber barron-corporatism that occurs as comical in the 21st century, just as ridiculous as the giant clock.

Ray Milland and Charles Laughton star in this murder drama. Elsa Lanchester plays a fun supporting role, along with the sleazy George Macready.

I like the line from Laughton to his mistress, that at least her latest tryst "wore a clean shirt".

I prefer noirs that don't try to include comedy. The weakest moments and characters of this movie are when it tries to be funny. Admittedly, Maureen O'Sullivan gives those moments a run for their money with her caricature pouting of an abandoned wife. It all hangs together though, if only barely.

Please seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can. Thank you.
