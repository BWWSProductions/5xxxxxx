You are right. There needs to be more than one torrent for the good stuff. Continue the good work and help the community. Having P2P does not hurt the movie industry, it helps it. Good movies will be spread around and those with less money (like me )will get to see them and appreciate the beauty. The movies will become timeless and part of the fabric of our civilization.

Yours Truly,

Alexander

That is my name."

I have seen it forever and have no clue what it means, and am guessing a good many of you don't either. So thanks in advance"
