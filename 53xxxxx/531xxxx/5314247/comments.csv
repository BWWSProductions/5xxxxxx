[T],jack.ss,2010-01-28T08:39Z,"Sonews, so what good have he done then? It seems like he haven't done anything different, or did I miss something?
Please inform me about the difference 'cause I really want to know. I was happy that he got elected, but so far I can't say he made any change in this cruel world.. 
I wish him the best of luck and hope he grows a pair. Would be a shame if he didn't even try to be the good guy most of us thought he was. He got elected 'cause people wanted a change for the better, so far it's only been status Quo."

91 of his promises he made were kept in the first year.  That's not to bad if you ask me..."
,moshster,2010-01-29T23:52Z,The man's first year has been sorting out the financial mess Bush left the country in and the trouble in Afghanistan.  At the same time he's been pushing his health care reforms.  Not bad going for the first 12 months; more than most people can do in their first 12 months in a new post.
