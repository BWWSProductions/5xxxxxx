,chr0naut,2010-01-29T04:30Z,"As Jesus was in existence 400 years before the Qur'an was written, it is most likely that Muhammad had read it somewhere, to quote it in the Qur'an. As no-one else has ever referred to the quote in the intervening 400 years and we have no documentary proof of that ever being said. I doubt that anything relating the actions of Jesus in the Qur'an is accurate or historical."
