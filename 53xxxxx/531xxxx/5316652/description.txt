Its unbelieveable how a concept is forced upon the world, with their eyes WIDE open. and all the while they talk to their priests, go to church, read the bible.... but simply say that Trinity is a mystery that can not be explained... " And remember when Isa (Jesus) the son of Maryam said: O children of Israel! I am the Rasool (Messenger) of Allah towards you, confirming the Torah which came before me, and to give you good news of a Rasool that will come after me whose name shall be Ahmed (another name of Muhammad, meaning 'The praised one'). But when he (Muhammad) came to them with clear signs, they said "This is plain magic." Surat As-Saff : Verse 6
