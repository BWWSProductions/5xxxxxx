,daegen999,2011-08-25T02:14Z,"I'v download this twice and I'm running into the same problem. Everytime I try to open the program it says ""This application has failed to start because Kernel.dll was bot found. Re-installing the application may fix the problem. Just re-installed and is still not working. Can someone help me out please?"
,Yuzz1,2011-09-25T16:23Z,"@daegen999
Try downloading the .dll file, google should help. Put it in the folder where the main exe is, and the problem should be fixed."
,lisyaoran29,2011-10-05T01:08Z,"to: daegen999

there is no missing dll...

try this

1) extract the iso file using winrar or winzip...
2) after extracting look for setup.exe 

installation will proceed then that's it...

works to me...but if it doesn't work to you then yzz1 is right..just google the missing file... (^^^)"
