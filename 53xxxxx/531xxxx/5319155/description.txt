Germany after the war: a divided country. In the no man's land between East and West (the Wall has not yet been built), an abandoned train station serves as the meeting place for two people: Carl, a West-German border official, and Anna, an East-German factory worker. After meeting and falling in love, they start preparing for a future in the West for themselves and Anna's young son. Helmut KÃ¤utner was one of the first to deal with the impossibility of love across the borders between "the two Germanies" during the times of the Cold War. His film was a become a stinging indictment of the border which tore German apart.
