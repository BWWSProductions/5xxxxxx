Why hello there, fellow Trancefags!

This is probably one of the very few legal torrents that you'll see me make. Here's a (incomplete) discography from Swedish Trance musician, Adam Vox. Of course you can just go to www.adamvox.com and download the songs for free, but I still thought that I'll make a torrent, just in case anything ever happens to his site.

Actually, this may not be a complete discography, as there are some songs listed on Vox's site that can't be downloaded for some reason, but this torrent has every song that I could download from the site.

Unlike other discographies, these are the original names of all the files, so I did not change them in any way.

Have fun with it and seed it if you like it!
