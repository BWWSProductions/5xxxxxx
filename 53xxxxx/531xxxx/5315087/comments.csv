,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-30T14:44Z,"EXCELLENT! Used different color fonts for different scenes of the Japanese dialogue and that was a nice touch! This Matroska Codec is amazing in it's ability to SQUEEZE the shit out of these files into small spaces, so I can get TWO flicks on a CD for storage. This saves me massive time not having to do my own compressions with AVC plus when I was downloading this, I was 25% through adjusting the times of an .srt files for a Klaxxon release... you really NEED the Jap sups for these 2 flicks. C'mon people, more of you should jump on the Matroska bandwagon and YES... of course this plays with VLC media player on a laptop! Mine is over 10 years old, overclocked to 850MHz and it loves these files except the subs cause a slight clipping of frames during play... just turn off some unnecessary services."
,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-30T14:46Z,It left enough room on the CD to store BOTH movies PLUS the two soundtracks! HAHAHA!!!
,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-30T14:52Z,"If you LOVE this flick, you have to get Slaughterhouse 5! "
,RC_Ebooks,2010-10-30T15:02Z,"If you LOVE these 2 flicks, get Grindhouse also!"
