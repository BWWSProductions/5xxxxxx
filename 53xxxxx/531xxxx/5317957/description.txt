Deep Roots is the authority on Jamaican music and reggae (a generic term). It was originally shot in the 1980s just after Bob Marleyâ€™s untimely death. The film-maker Howard Johnson conducted the interviews of some of its biggest stars. He interviewed cultural historians, folklorists, musicologists and toasters. Johnson also interviews those who helped to create this Jamaican-borne music, and produce the records of a sound heard â€˜round the world.
