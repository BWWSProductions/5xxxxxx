Fanfare CiocÃ¢rlia is a popular twelve-piece Roma brass band from the northeastern Romanian village of Zece PrÄƒjini. The band began as a loose assemblage of part-time musicians playing at local weddings and baptisms. In October 1996, the German sound engineer and record producer Henry Ernst visited Zece Prajini and convinced a number of the musicians there to assemble a touring band. These musicians decided to name the band Fanfare CiocÃ¢rlia: Fanfare being a French word that has passed into Romanian and is used to designate a brass band; CiocÃ¢rlia being the Romanian word for the skylark. Since their discovery by Ernst, who serves as their manager, they have played more than thousand concerts in more than 50 countries across the globe.

This is not my upload. I am just re-seeding it.

I did not re-upload without extra file so this torrent for which I'm very grateful wouldn't die.
