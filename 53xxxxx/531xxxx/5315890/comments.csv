,M0e09,2010-01-31T00:15Z,"Hey lifechanger, as you are posting some older movies at the moment, I was wondering if there is any chance that you could upload a BRRip of ""we own the night"" from 2007. I can't really find i a decent rip of it on the net, so maybe you can do something about it... ;-)"

,bhargav_17789,2010-03-13T07:16Z,"This is the first movie from seccretmyth clan that has highly disappointed me .... quality is not upto secretmyth standards ....  the image gets blurred during high motion scenes, and this is a action movie .... anyways keep that in mind for ur next upload ...

Thanx for ur contribution .... Keep up the good work ..."
,tehmantra,2010-05-12T01:39Z,video quality is horrible
,ultamanl,2010-07-21T23:55Z,"Good quality, and thanks for the extended version.

Thanks uploader! :D"
,midge218,2010-09-03T02:36Z,"this is quite a bad rip, even though it is BR, its like it was ripped small and stretched then used grainy sort of blur to smooth it out but failed and its annoyin watching it after experiencing all the sharp movies from PT or other uploader, lifechanger not known for such a bad rip though so it might just be a one off"
,iamutham,2010-12-04T18:11Z,"HD video is over-sharpened, over-contrasted/saturated, and EXTREMELY over-compressed (low bitrate, no definition, blocky). AAC 5.1 audio is butchered (no high frequencies) due to bitrate/size as well. Worse than typical SecretMyth quality, probably due to tremendous 3+ HR film length..."
,manigma,2011-01-13T09:41Z,"Yes, its extremely OVER SHARPENED. Doesn't look very nice in some scenes."
,osriccc,2011-02-23T07:24Z,"I ignored the comments and wish I didn't... this movie is not like other punctual SecretMyth's movies... please find another option, it's artifacted, over compressed, you can see dots in everyone's faces until they go dissapearing with time just to appear again when the shoot changes... Bad, bad, bd... I had to erase it and it took days to download for me. Not seeding this. I appreciate the intention a lot (there are not too many extended HD rips from this film) but I have to warn everybody about this."

,7andy7,2011-04-02T19:28Z,"video 20/10
audio 10/10
It's amazing what a good encoder can do.
you packed 3,5 hours movie into 2,5 GB file
with this amazing quality.
Thank you.
I like the sharpness and the vivid colours 
it looked perferct on my 19in TFT monitor."
,romeo49000,2011-08-15T15:02Z,"on a 19 inch , probably but surely not on a 40 inch screen. The bitrate is too low."
,Zarkow,2011-09-23T23:05Z,"7andy7>> If you are going to judge video-quality, get a decent TV, 46"" or higher..."
,xnuw,2011-10-09T18:57Z,"thanks for this one with complete end credits, others rips are removed."
