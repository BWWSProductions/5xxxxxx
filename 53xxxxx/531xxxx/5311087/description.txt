"Gettin' You Home (The Black Dress Song)" is a country music song co-written and recorded by American country music singer Chris Young. It is the second single release from his second studio album, The Man I Want to Be, released on September 1, 2009. Young co-wrote the song with Kent Blazy and Cory Batten.

"Gettin' You Home" is a mid-tempo where the male narrator plans to take his lover out on a date. Although he says that he loves to show her off, and that she loves to get dressed up, all he can think about is "gettin' [her] home" to have sex with her.

Karlie Justus of The 9513 gave "Gettin' You Home" a thumbs-up. She described the song as "pleasingly radio-friendly without feeling like a sell-out, and it should catapult Young into the very small club of successful country reality competition winners." Kevin J. Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A- rating. His review called it "suggestive without being sleazy." Matt Bjorke, in his review of the album, said that the song "is sultry and sexy without ever feeling like itâ€™s pandering to anybody. Also, despite the R&B grooves in the mix, the song is nothing but country."

"Gettin' You Home" debuted at #60 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart dated for February 28, 2009. It later debuted at #91 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in August 2009 and has since moved up to #33. It became his first Number One hit on the Hot Country Songs chart dated for October 24, 2009, making Young the first Nashville Star contestant to have a Number One.

The Man I Want to Be is the second studio album of American country music artist Chris Young. It was released on September 1, 2009 via RCA Nashville. The lead-off single, "Voices", was released in May 2008, and peaked at #37 on the Hot Country Songs chart, becoming Young's first Top 40 country hit. The album was supposed to have been released in August 2008, but was delayed. A second single, "Gettin' You Home (The Black Dress Song)", was released in January 2009, and has reached Number One on the country charts.
