,retrogoddfather,2010-06-08T02:24Z,"if youre getting the reinstall waves plugins message, look back for details in the other mercury torrent but you have to go into regedit-go to regedit
-find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Filter
- right click on the folder and click PERMISSIONS
- then u have to allow the authorizations, also u may try to go on advanced-owner and change the owner...i did both of these but i dont know what made everything work "
,norskipup,2010-06-09T10:34Z,"Regarding this install and Windows 7 & Cubase... whichever clever cookie wrote the following, it works... did for me anyway.

Go to Regedit.
-find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Filter
- right click on the folder and click PERMISSIONS
- allow everything."

Installed ok but when I load cubase I'm asked for the waves plugins folder.

Had waves installed a while ago without trouble."
