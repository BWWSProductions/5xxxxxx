,ghiakarmann,2010-10-23T05:37Z,"Rather disappointing video quality.  Watchable, but irritating, I'll be looking for a better quality copy.  Finished d/l'ing ""Gangs of New York"" at the same time from the same uploader, .BONE., it too had the same poor quality video.  Played both on 4 different Players, same low quality on each."

,broad_next2,2011-04-19T19:15Z,"thanks dude, good movie."
,MarkoOhNo,2011-05-11T12:39Z,"@ghiakarmann I think I had the same experience.
It's just somewhat grainy and the contrast is off at times (some scenes taking place in sunlight are very, very yellow) but overall it's watchable. Much worse than this and I'd delete & re-download elsewhere. All the same, many thanks to the uploader for the time put into providing this. :)

,eastpak,2012-03-19T09:02Z,"Is it the whole movie, or just part 1?"
,base3,2012-03-26T10:09Z,"Nash was not in the least bit 'sub-normal'. As the movie shows, he was highly intelligent. He was schizophrenic. This is a psychological disorder rather than a learning disability. It does not mean or lead to reduced intelligence. If he appeared in later life to be slow, it was due to the anti-psychotic meds which have a side-effect of blunting creative genius."
,NormandyIntl,2012-06-27T12:28Z,"@base3 yeah it was because of his Thorazine, i used to be on it myself, it makes you sorta braindead i hate the stuff."
