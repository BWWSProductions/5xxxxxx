After hours of searching I finally ended up having to buy this CD.  So here it is since it is no where on the internet.

Z-Trip's new project is an explosive combination of hip-hop and rock's finest and has more energy that a hydrogen bomb!! Z-Trip has built a name with his signature mash-up style and his record is sure to please fans across the board. Rakim and Chevelle collide in a single "Let The Rhythm Hit Em 2007: and Dead Prez pair up with Deftones for an exclusive original track "Locked and Loaded". Just as expected this record has a combination of big names featuring as well as heavyweights from the indie scene. With the music also featured in the new 2K Sports football video game "Al Pro", retail can be assured the marketing will be major. A true burner from start to finish, this project is guaranteed to have people talking.
