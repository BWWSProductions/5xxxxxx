,ScreamingDeath,2010-01-31T21:03Z,Is the snow leopard modified in anyway for this to work? I have snow leopard already and vmware workstation 7. Can I just use my snow leopard dvd to install snow leopard right onto the virtual machine?
,TRoN_1,2010-02-02T06:04Z,"Small price to pay, that sounds familiar. Oh I remember, I got this about 2 weeks ago from here...

,TRoN_1,2010-02-03T05:13Z,"I wasn't trying to criticise or claim it's not original. For me, any virus free torrent is a good torrent, so it's all good. Shouldn't this be in the Windows section?"

,piratekitty,2010-02-22T13:01Z,"I can't unpack w/o errors either...

Any suggestions?"
,odobo,2010-02-24T01:48Z,Well i downloaded it again.. and still got the extraction errors. So If you are one of those leechers or even seeders.. dont bother..
,corruptedSoul,2010-02-28T10:04Z,"""Archive has been compressed with 7-Zip 9.10 using maximum LZMA2 compression.""

you need at least winrar v3.91 or 7z 9.04 to extract, anything older will give you error."
