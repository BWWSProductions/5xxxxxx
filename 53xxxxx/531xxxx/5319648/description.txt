---- Prerequisites -----

VMware Workstation 7 (Included)
Premade OS X Virtual Machine (Included)
VMware Tools for OS X (Included - darwin_snow.iso)
64-bit Intel processor with Virtualization Technology

----- Usage -----

1. Install VMware Workstation if not already done so.
2. Extract and then copy the "Mac OS X 10.6.2" directory to your Virtual Machines directory.
3. Open the virtual machine in VMware and edit the processor, RAM and hard drive settings to your liking.
4. Set darwin_snow.iso (under Misc) as CD-ROM media.
5. Boot your virtual machine.

---- Tips ----

I recommend taking a snapshot of the virtual machine prior to making any major changes such as a system update.

You will always need to use the darwin_snow.iso to boot your VM but this is a small price to pay for having Snow  Leopard in a VM, using a vanilla install disk at that. Not having darwin_snow.iso mounted at boot will result in an Operating system not found error.

If you have any difficulties with this premade virtual machine, you can try setting up OS X yourself using the guide at:

I have successfully installed iLife 09 and Microsoft Office 2008 in this virtual machine however they are NOT included for the sake of keeping this torrent below 10 GB.

iLife 09: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4679908/iLife__09_Install_DVD.dmg
Microsoft Office 2008: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4011190/Microsoft_Office_2008_for_Mac_-_Standard_Edition___14_serials

To mount these in VMware, use dmg2img from http://vu1tur.eu.org/tools/.
