This is a joint effort:  I translated and did the initial typesetting; Eternia did the final editing and proofreading.

After some frustration with a lightning storm frying her computer, Eternia got herself a nice laptop and finally managed to finish editing Chapter 19 of Koe De Oshigoto!

As always, many thanks to those who help seed!  (I am most grateful!)
