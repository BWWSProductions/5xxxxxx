This is a recent LIVE concert the band Kansas did in their home town of Topeka, Kansas where they hadn't been in 35 years. This is one very enjoyable concert.....

This is a reunion concert, held in their home town, for all the fans that supported the band over the last 35 years. During that time, the band has had some personnel changes and for this reunion, brought back the former to work with the current to give that distinct Kansas sound. A full piece orchestra as back up helps
 to recreate the special sound Kansas was known for.

This 82 minute concert includes songs from their beginning including: "Carry On"; "Song 4"; "Dust in the Wind"; "Rainmaker"; "Hold on, Baby Hold On";"Icarus 2"; "The Other Side"; "The Wall", and more. Recorded on HDNet from their November 2009 concert. Like everyone in the audience....ENJOY!
