Exalted is a role-playing game published by White Wolf Publishing. The game is classified as high fantasy, but may be more accurately described as "mythic fantasy," as the original developer specifically avoided drawing on J. R. R. Tolkien for inspiration.  A second edition of the core rule book has been published, and new supplements for this edition are being released.  Here are the list of the supplements in this torrent.  All are Second Ed.
