,Maxymo,2010-12-20T12:42Z,"Hey, PLEASE HELP!

From the log i like this version but I can not install it!!!!
I've burned it on DVD DL with CDBurnerXP with 2.4 speed (the slowest one).
When installing in one moment it says 
'Windows Cannot install required files. The file may be corrupt or missing. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. ERROR CODE: 0x80070017'
Does it work for you??
What should I do??"
