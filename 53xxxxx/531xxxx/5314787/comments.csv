,jimmytheleech,2010-02-10T18:55Z,"That didn't work very well.

Anyway, I tested an IonCube 6.5 encoded file.  It did not work very well.  Unless I am doin' something wrong."
[T],n2kmaster,2010-02-28T05:43Z,Yeah cuz it worked fine here. Hmmm no output means you're missing something im thinking that donetfx bs from m$ to be honest.
[T],n2kmaster,2010-02-28T05:44Z,I reseed the other versions i may have uploaded the wrong version however i doubt it

,MaryJo_Ve,2011-04-12T03:39Z,"it does work, thanks"
,jpric3,2011-04-24T05:38Z,This is an IRONCUBE decoder not IONCUBE. There is a difference. This will not work on ioncube files
,keepitlive,2012-02-07T17:11Z,"Yop, NOT IonCube ^^

Post real prg. names next time instead of wasting ppl's time..."
,NeonYouki,2012-02-18T11:49Z,"This ioncube decoder is called ironcube, but it decodes ioncube files.  If you read the source code, it even says ioncube in MANY places.  Also, how can this be a fake decoder if they even give you the source code itself?  People, this is legit in the sense that you can even tweak it to your liking.  Its open source apparently.  That being said, there is some kind of error with the zlib tool.ocx.  The original file needed to be registered, but when I used regsvr32 it said it wouldn't work.  I got an updated copy of zlib tool and it registers, but it isn't working well so far.  It fails when it reaches that tool.  So, even a minor revision being used as a replacement doesn't work the same.  I'm not sure why yet, but I'm working on it."
