Working, beautifully i might add in windows xp, the previous versions didnt work at all but the ones at theones are genuine working! Thanks bud that kicks ass! Been looking for a while! Tried it on the newest Walker Exchange Ventrino Script to see and it worked perfectly, no errors, all the commands stayed intact!

I should mention the above version listed is the v1.5 build 26 and seems to be a portable version, quite well done i might add cuz i didn't require any serials and it read a complex script like a present day ventrino script and a few others i threw at it. Nothing "Phishy" showed up, i checked it thoroughly before posting

Writes 2 files when running the decompiling process, say if your file was index.php, the decoded files that come out are index_Decoded.php,and a index_Decoded.txt will show up in the original folder.
