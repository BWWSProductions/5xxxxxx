,adripper,2010-01-29T15:35Z,"For the most part part they stayed to the storyline of the comic books but they did take a few liberties.  Silver Surfer was replaced by another hero who I won't give away. They had to condense everything into a hour and twenty minute movie.  Not bad,  they can follow into WWH nicely after this movie."
,shinobiung,2010-01-29T19:55Z,"wow, this is the only movie I fell asleep to, in 20years.

they took a crap cartoon and just bought the  temporary rights to use the hulk character as part of the act.

the story and directing is kiddy with some green so called blood to give it some misguided kudos.

thank you GOD ! ! I never paid for this."

It's just a rebundling of the already released xmen animated series.  It's not anything actually new."
