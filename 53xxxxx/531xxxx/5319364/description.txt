This is the Portable version of VLC player
This Portable App was made by the Portable App Company. (i guess)
its a extremely great alternative to windows media player and quicktime media player.
Its fully usable and has just about every codec out there.
It can play AVI, MKV, MP4, FLV and so on.
This is pretty useful specially when you go to school or you have a job and those school computers dont allow AVI or something.
it can play .MKV 720p high def video only if youre cmoputer can support high-def video (nvidia geforce 6600 or above works fine i believe)

This is all integrated into one folder which you move into your usb drive, after moving the folder in there it can be launched from any laptop just by clicking the VLCPortable.exe file
all codecs and needed files are in subfolder in the folder.
its been tested on windows xp, vista and windows 7.
its compatible in Linux Mint and Ubuntu if and only if you have WINE.
the GUI isnt all fancy but it looks a bit like a windows 98 GUI but it increases performance and runs great.
this also works if you have a new computer without codecs and you just want to watch a movie you download or something.
this also plays audio and im pretty sure it supports just about every audio file out there.]
