,daba_1,2010-01-28T13:39Z,"I am eternally grateful for Night?s uploads and let me explain why. You look at the Blues or old Classic rock albums and you say they are American groups. This is true however they are not being pressed in America. If you check the back album covers you will see made in Japan, EU, Germany, Sweden and etc. These recordings are of the highest quality. So especially for people in North America, [where I am] if you go to the music stores you would have to order an import. This means waiting up to 3 months to get it and paying premium dollars. So even if you are leery about logging in on TPB and put in a thank you, at the very least seed whatever amount you can. Night sees this and in it?s self is a thank you. "
