Please seed.
ItÂ´s a shame that so few people download this.
One of my top 10 favourite torrents."
,flac-fan,2010-04-17T23:54Z,"Come on guys, download now.
It took me only 10 days to download this piece of art  (6 Mb/s connection).
You can download this in less of 2 weeks.
IÂ´m uploading for a long time."
