,zxkb4s29,2010-01-27T10:44Z,we want PAL!
,Strikefear13,2010-01-27T11:49Z,Download the original or force pal in the loader program.
,zxkb4s29,2010-01-27T14:40Z,we dont want softmod!
,Strikefear13,2010-01-27T17:02Z,Too bad?
,elma1337,2010-01-27T20:24Z,It's a japanese game so it's never gonna come in PAL at this moment ...
,diazao,2010-01-27T21:09Z,neither on ntsc-u
,asleroth,2010-01-28T02:25Z,"This should work perfect if it has been patched correctly, i downloaded the NTSC-J game and English patched it myself and it works great! Amazing game! It's a real shame that it will not get released outside of Japan for people who do not want to softmod!"
,zxkb4s29,2010-01-28T10:50Z,@elma1337: we want pal patch! (pal wiis can show ntsc signal)
,freddyjunior,2010-01-28T15:23Z,"@zxb4

dont say ""we"" cos you dont speak for me you fucking little bitch.  download and thank the uploader that spent time on this or fuck off.  dont complain that its not what you want.  no one here gives a fuck about what you want."
,asleroth,2010-01-29T00:44Z,"@ zxkb4s29! What don't you understand about this? You will never get a Patched PAL version of this game because a PAL version does not or will not exist, the developers already announced that they do not intend to release this outside of Japan, so this is the best you are going to get, thank the guys who created the english patch for their hard work and stop whining. If you are not willing to softmod your Wii to play this then why are you commenting on Wii game torrents when you will not be able to play them?, i am afraid it is your loss as you will never be able to play the game otherwise."
,zxkb4s29,2010-01-29T23:04Z,@asleroth: again: one can run any ntsc game on a pal wii if it is patched right.
,Breadbin,2010-01-30T02:22Z,"just forget about zxkb4s29 he's complained on most of the torrents of this type, including mine! Don't have this torrent but can shout for WiiSOS."
,asleroth,2010-01-30T04:06Z,"@zxkb4s29: It is not about how it is patched, you can just run it and force PAL in USB Loader GX! Either way, you said you are not willing to softmod your console, so if it is not already hardmodded then you will not be able to play this or any of the other Wii games on here even if they were PAL! So why are you complaining!"
,Hell2uall,2010-01-30T07:13Z,"Is it possible for you to release another version of this, but with the costume patch included?"
,diazao,2010-01-31T14:48Z,@Hell2uall; i'm thinking about it...
,Hell2uall,2010-01-31T23:11Z,Really much appreciated if you do.  
,fullmetaleng,2010-02-01T16:05Z,"I agree, would be great to have a torrent with costumes included :) thanks"
,bengalih,2010-02-02T00:44Z,"FYI to everyone interested on costumes:
It isn't really possible to include the costume patch because the patch allows you to select from several costumes for each character and replaces these costume files on the disc on-the-fly with the patched costumes from the SD card.
So - it IS possible to replace the current costumes with ONE from the patch - but nothing that would allow you to toggle in between them.
I have made a copy with one costume replaced just to see it - and trust me - you aren't really missing anything, it is just minor color variations."
,koko-goal,2010-02-11T23:10Z,"Works awesomely. This is the patched version. Thanks diazao and thanks to seeders.

,dead_executive05,2010-09-13T12:52Z,"i just wanna ask, will this work on dolphin and is there no need to extract and replace files for the patch on the iso file?

or simple this is already a patched iso file, ready to play in dolphine emu in english? thanks ^^"
,dead_executive05,2010-09-14T14:14Z,"guys, seed please T__T"

,Mohammed1984,2011-03-16T05:31Z,.Not working on Dolphine.
,coldDarkness,2011-04-22T02:02Z,It isn't working for me. I keep getting disc read error 1167. I enabled region free in priiloader and I still get the error.
,jmugwump,2011-06-15T11:41Z,"This works!!!
Just burnt on 2x using IMG and a verbatim disc. Patching etc already done.
Can't play using my modchip, had to go in via neogamma. But only slight hassle."
,jmugwump,2011-06-15T11:43Z,PS this works on PAL. Just need neogamma or some other usb/disc loader.
,Lastxeno,2011-08-20T13:04Z,Works great with neo gamma
,stevenlee091,2011-11-22T16:12Z,"This DOES NOT work on system 4.3. I have a softmod and am using the homebrew channel. The game plays, but the patch will not install."
,mcrickyb1983,2012-01-15T14:24Z,perfect works with 43e just download n convert to wbfs and play from usb thankyou
