"One hundred dead are a catastrophe; millions of dead are a statistic" The horrendous observations of Adolf Eichmann.

This Oscar nominated documentary serves not only as a remembrance but a lesson and a warning for the future. It follows the plight of Europe's Jews during the terrifying period from 1933 until the final defeat of the Third Reich in 1945.

Never before has the world seen such contempt for human life on such a grand scale, the murder of an estimated 6 million Jews, with countless other persecuted.

During the 1930s a wave of national fervour swept through a tumultuous Germany; people looked for answers, and the politicians were all too willing to point the finger of blame towards the Jewish population.
