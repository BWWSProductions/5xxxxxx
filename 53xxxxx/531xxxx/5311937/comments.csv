,RDaneel20,2010-01-28T14:44Z,I hope you have read the log file of this rip........Before you write your post...........
,thuerrsch,2010-01-28T20:16Z,"I don't doubt that you or your source did indeed rip this from a CD in good faith. It's the authenticity of the CD that I find hard to believe in after what auCDtect says, your log notwithstanding. auCDtect is usually very good at detecting bogus CDs, I've run it over thousands of rips, my own included. When it comes up with results as bad as these I just have to share them with other potential downloaders.

Please don't get me wrong, it's nothing personal, I really appreciate your effort. I'd even welcome it if you could prove me wrong be showing me exactly how and why auCDtect got this one wrong.

,RDaneel20,2010-01-28T22:27Z,"If a log file generated by eac with accurate rip results isn't enough, i suggest to you to write a post on hydrogenaudio forum to say them that accurate rip database has a fake cd inside it ;))) "
