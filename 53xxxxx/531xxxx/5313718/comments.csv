,EmperorYogi,2010-01-28T01:37Z,Thanks a lot! Not a big MTV fan but this show isn't too bad.
[T],Dodecahedron9,2010-01-28T02:12Z,"You're welcome. Like I said on another torrent, I don't know what's on mtv these days, and probably is a good thing, I could have missed this show otherwise. These guys have been around for quite a while, and as far as I know the whole concept of the show was created by them and not by mtv. By the way, you won't see the network logo, I took that thing off :)"
,cAnDySwAgG,2010-01-30T00:44Z,me again..another great dl seeding now prolly for a while thnx keep em comin
[T],Dodecahedron9,2010-01-30T13:52Z,"Thank you, this show definitely needs more seeders. "
[T],Dodecahedron9,2010-01-30T13:56Z,"This torrent already lost 100 seeders after 2 days, that is never a good sign. People seem to really like this show so I don't get it."
