This is the Arcade version of BlazBlue Continuum Shift. BlazBlue runs on an embedded windows XP arcade system, which means that after a bit of ingenuity it can be run on windows PCs of comparable/higher specs.

To configure the game, drag "game.exe" onto "typex_config.exe"
Answer no to the first 3 questions, and on the fourth just press enter. Then configure your inputs.
To run the game, drag "game.exe" onto "typex_loader.exe"
This process can be simplified by making a simple shortcut/batchfile

If you're having trouble configuring your controls, unplug any USB joypads/sticks before running typex_config.exe

If your settings aren't saving, you can translate the japanese text to english by going to data/ETC/Text and rename the "eng" folder "jap" and the "jap" folder "eng"

If the game is running slowly, try installing some replacement backgrounds:

If your D drive isn't writeable and you want to change your operator menu
settings, use this launcher. It will reassign your D drive to Z, and assign your BBCS folder to the D drive. It will change everything back when you quit the game.



I tested it on Vista 64 bit with a ps2 controller and it worked fine!


Enjoy!
