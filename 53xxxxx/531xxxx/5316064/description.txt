         Empire - 'War on terror' through Muslim eyes               
                                                                           
                                                                           
       Since al-Qaeda declared holy war against the world's only          
        superpower a decade ago, Washington has either been in             
       denial or is no closer to understanding what really                
       motivates al-Qaeda militants and its affiliates, or how             
      to deal with them.                                                  
                                                                          
       Despite trillions of dollars spent and the deaths of                
        thousands of US soldiers, al-Qaeda's top leaders remain            
       at large and are still claiming responsibility for attacks        
      against Western targets, as new franchises or offshoots            
      spring up in unlikely places.                                      
                                                                           
        Caught in the crossfire are the world's Muslims.                     
                                                                            
        In this episode, Empire looks at how al-Qaeda is perceived          
      in the Muslim world.                                               
                                                                         
      We will analyse whether the US' so-called 'war on terror'         
       - with its deadly tactics and support for corrupt rulers           
      - serves only to alienate Muslims, driving them into the            
       arms of extremist groups.                                          
                                                                          
        We will ask if the US can reverse the tide of military              
       intervention in the region and instead try to reach                  
        political solutions that involve all political parties,              
       including repressed Islamic parties.                                 
                                                                          
    We will also discuss whether the Arab world has an                
    answer to the al-Qaeda challenge.
