,ThomyTim,2010-02-01T14:57Z,"Picture quality is good and the Danish subs are in synch. However it's something very weird with the sound. It shows as 5.1 DD, but there is no real 5.1 effect, and extreme humming noise when dialogue and sound goes silent. This is probably something that's easiest to notice on a proper 5.1 system.... Other than that, a quite funny movie. Thanks!"
