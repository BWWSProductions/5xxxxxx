This must be a remastered version, as it has 2 extra tracks from my CD. This is Muddy's finest, in my opinion, and Johnny Winter is also playing brilliantly. Worth the download just for the extra 2 songs. Thanks mate."
[V],nightissuchproximity,2010-01-28T10:48Z,"Hi, fendermental

How you doin', mate?   Didn't know you like Johnny Winter.   That being the case, keep an eye on my uploads this coming weekend; I just may have some ""goodies"" for you."
,daba_1,2010-01-28T12:45Z,"This 1981 recording found Waters being produced by rocker Johnny Winter, who had brought Muddy back to form on the Hard Again album. Winter was smart enough to surround the great one with musicians who knew his music intimately -- regular band members like Calvin Jones, Willie ""Big Eyes"" Smith, Luther ""Guitar Jr."" Johnson, and Bob Margolin dot the lineup -- and Johnny keeps his own excesses in check on a nice brace of tunes. While most of the tunes here are recuts of older Chess material, Muddy's versions of Slim Harpo's title track and his own ""Champagne & Reefer"" are worth checking out. Not the place to start a Muddy Waters collection, but a good one to add to the collection after you've absorbed the classics on Chess.
Review on 10 track album.

WATERS, WINTER & COTTON_BREAKIN' IT UP, BREAKIN' IT DOWN, ALSO PINETOP PERKINS, BOB MARGOLIN, WILLIE ""BIG EYES"" SMITH AND CHARLES CALMESE...WATERS HARD AGAIN ALBUM TOUR
Without a doubt one of best live albums made
Muddy Waters was still singing the blues like a young lion when he made 1977's Hard Again ? produced by guitarist Johnny Winter ? then promoted it with a killer live revue with Winter and harp master James Cotton, recorded along the way but unreleased until now. The trio makes living Chicago fire together, and I personally vouch for the tracks taped in Philadelphia, including Waters' snarling return to his 1948 hit ""Can't Be Satisfied."" I was there.

And as ever thanks good ""night"" :D)"
,daba_1,2010-01-28T13:38Z,"I am eternally grateful for Night?s uploads and let me explain why. You look at the Blues or old Classic rock albums and you say they are American groups. This is true however they are not being pressed in America. If you check the back album covers you will see made in Japan, EU, Germany, Sweden and etc. These recordings are of the highest quality. So especially for people in North America, [where I am] if you go to the music stores you would have to order an import. This means waiting up to 3 months to get it and paying premium dollars. So even if you are leery about logging in on TPB and put in a thank you, at the very least seed whatever amount you can. Night sees this and in it?s self is a thank you. "
