DriveCrypt 5.4 Multilingual 

Full disk encryption with pre-boot authentication

Ideal to encrypt an entire computer /notebook/ partition or just a single Hard drive. 
With DCPP the Hard drive (including the operating system) is encrypted 100%, 
therefore unauthorized person will not be able to see even temporary files, installs software etc. 
DriveCrypt also allows to create a hidden operating system: By entering the correct password, the disks are open, 
if however you are forced to reveal a password, you could reveal a pre-configured â€œfakeâ€ password and the disk 
will open showing fake, prepared information.
