The spam comment on the other movie made me laugh out loud though "

Excuse me if I sound rude, but where do you get off making demands of a VIP uploaer? And for the record, those ""usesless"" handheld ups? I use them. They are very useful to me. So in the politest terms, shut your trap and back off HR. KTHXBAI!"
