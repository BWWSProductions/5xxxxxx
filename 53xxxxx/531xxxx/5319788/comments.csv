,drjacko,2010-04-28T21:45Z,"Heck the quality of the episodes were fine. Not ultra-superior, but still good.

Yo cheater71!
Can you do something similar with bleach and inuyasha episodes? Cut down the size while maintaining the quality? All the torrents that I have come across are like 40 GB."
,blueldrrich84,2010-11-07T07:57Z,"bamsen82: dude, can you do better? if so, upload. for one, these are more seeded than others ive found and in general, its harder to even FIND english dubbed. if i wanted to fucking read subtitles, id buy the manga! so shut the fuck up, download if you want and quit complaining. drjacko says theyre fine and i believe him/her. if its watchable, i really dont give a flying fuck."
