And, Iâ€™m really excited about Band Hero, because not only are fans getting to play my songs, but Iâ€™m actually in the game,â€ said Swift. â€œThere are so many awesome things that go into being in Band Hero, like getting to customize my band to look like my touring band, and itâ€™s so cool for people to feel like they are experiencing one of my concerts. This is one of the closest things out there to going to see me perform!â€
