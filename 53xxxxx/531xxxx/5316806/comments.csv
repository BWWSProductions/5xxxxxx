I have been able to run 5 other PAL games on my NTSC softmodded wii via USB Loader GX until this one.

I get error 002 but if i go into USB LOADER gx SETTINGS AND CHOOSE 002 ERROR FIX = ON then I just get a black screen and nothing happens.

I also have FORCE NTSC selected.  Also tried via NEoGamma 8 and cannot get it to work.  I dont recommend NTSC users to download this torrent"
,fc322,2011-01-09T06:38Z,"EDIT:  Disregard my earlier comment.  It is not an NTSC issue.  I just had to install Hermes cIOS v4 and after that i was able to run in via USB Loader gx using ""Force NTSC"" option and IOS 223

This also fixed Guitar Hero 6 : Warriors of Rock
