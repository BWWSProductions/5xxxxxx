This is a full discography of the Danish band D-A-D, or Dineyland after Dark.

All cd's are ripped in 320 kbps, except Psycopatico, wich i am working on acquireing. 

All files have correct id3 tags.

Seed & Enjoy

Edit: The weird Band Info in the bottom is a bit WTF? it isn't this band, and they don't make the same genre of music. To avoid confusion.
