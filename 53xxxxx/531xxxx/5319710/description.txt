"C'mon and Love Me", and "Rock and Roll All Nite" were released as singles. Both failed to rise high on the charts until "Rock and Roll All Nite" was released in its live format as a single later that year off their double live album Alive! and reached number 12 on the singles charts.

The album was re-released in 1997 (along with most of Kiss' earlier albums) in a remastered version.

It peaked at number 32 on the charts and was certified Gold on February 28, 1977, when it sold 500,000 copies.

While the album cover depicts Kiss in business suits, no member of the band actually owned a suit. The suits they wore in the cover were owned by manager Bill Aucoin.[citation needed]}

While "Rock and Roll All Nite" remains a permanent staple in the band's concerts (often played to close out a show), there are several other songs still played from this release such as "She", "Rock Bottom" and occasionaly "C'Mon and Love Me"
