Robbie daughter Dani Monet is visiting her after ten years attending school in the East. She knows nothing about her mother's situation; especially that she is the owner of the Tailgate Casino. Her arrival is coincidental to the combine trying to move in and take over her business. Her education about the wild West is on the fast track when she learns about her mother's true profession and that the West is not exactly what she imagined. Robbie not only has to try to keep her secret from her daughter but deal with the combine who are now trying to force a hostile takeover by threatening to reveal Robbie's 10-year secret.
