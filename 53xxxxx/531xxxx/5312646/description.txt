Insane/bizarre existential no budget underground film, 4 stories about people in search of God. Really ridiculous and insane. Stop-motion, time-lapse, every kind of animation, insane musical numbers, characters interacting with projectors, all kinds of fun stuff. Not much else to say beyond that.  Best underground film of 2010.
