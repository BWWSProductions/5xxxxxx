,offchop5,2010-02-26T10:27Z,"What Crap. This is YOUR hottest 100 and its shit, Its not even the real 2009 top 100.... your a  dum fuck waste my time and download.......EVERYONE this is not the real top 100 its his top 100......fucker"
,javsav,2010-03-09T08:51Z,"Actually, offchop5, this IS the correct ""triple j hottest 100"" of 2009. Triple J is an Australian station focusing on mostly indie (GOOD) music and every year they have a publicly voted hottest 100. This is the hottest 100 of 2009. So next time before you download a torrent, perhaps read its description, or EVEN LOOK AT THE LIST OF THE SONGS WHEN YOU OPEN THE TORRENT BEFORE DOWNLOADING IT before you complain like a wimpy faggot bitch"
