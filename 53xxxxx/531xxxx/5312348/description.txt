Spin (p.106) - 3.5 stars out of 5 -- "Landes' voice is buttery and melodic....Her New York-by-way-of-Kentucky pluck is a refreshing antidote to schmaltzy neo-folk."
Uncut (p.86) - 4 stars out of 5 -- "Landes propels the whole project skyward with a voice that encapsulates the best qualities of Laura Veirs and Cat Power. It's pretty much essential stuff."
Q (Magazine) (p.96) - 4 stars out of 5 -- "[U]nderstated and beautiful, her soft voice lilting over acoustic guitar, banjo and little else on warm-hearted ballads..."
