FRAY released the sixth album from Groove Armada. The album will be released on March 2, 2010 in the USA and February 22, 2010 in the UK.

Twelve years into a career as purveyors of top drawer dance music, Andy Cato and Tom Findlay have completely reinvented their sound, with thrilling results. Thus, in a break with GA tradition, their band was brought into the studio early in the making of the Black Light, helping to bring authenticity to their new song-based sound. Features guest vocalists including Bryan Ferry, Will Young, Jess Larabee (She Keeps Bees) & Nick Littlemore (Empire of the Sun).
