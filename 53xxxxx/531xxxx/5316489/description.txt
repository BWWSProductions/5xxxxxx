Compilation nr 8 (the last one)


Duniya Ahmed Baraxow, Mandela, Sahra Dawo & Dur Dur, Jaabir Jarkabood, Mustafa Hassan, Sheegoband, Abwaan Cali Xasan Warsame and more...
A mix of oldies & goldies, recent tunes & young talents.

I tried (again) to fix better sound on a few tracks from nr 6.

And this time I don't want to forget to praise all the composers and among them the great Mustafa Karaama!

As I said before, I don't understand Af Soomaali (but learning now and then), so it's absolutely not my intention to make people upset with the choice of songs.


50 mp3 songs, more than 4 hours of Somali music so... ENJOY nr 8! :)

(and, as usual, fadlan/plz seed)

ps: I've found all tunes (but one on nr 2) onda Mighty Free Internet!
    No CD or LP ripping - only promoting & supporting the somalian music scene.
