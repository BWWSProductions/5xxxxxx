The second of Benson's John Hammond-produced albums is far and away the superior of the pair, mixing down-to-basics, straight-ahead jazz with soul-drenched grooving.  Suddenly Benson's backup group - same as that of Uptown, with Benny Green added on trombone now and then - has found its bearings and apropos to the title, they can cook, even sizzle.  The effect upon Benson's own playing is striking; with something to react against, his sheer ability to swing advances into the realm of awesome.  The rapid-fire work on "The Cooker" and "Ready And Able" will make you gasp.  Only one vocal here, an exuberant "All Of Me." [ In mid-2001 Columbia/Legacy reissued this 1966 classic, along with It's Uptown, recorded only several months earlier.  Four bonus tracks include a (previously unreleased) doo wop vocal rendition of Little Willie John's "Let Them Talk" and two Benson originals that are pure rock-n-roll: "The Man from Toledo" and "Goodnight. " Two of the bonus cuts are preceded by control-booth comments from the session's legendary producer, John Hammond. ] ~ Richard S.  Ginell, AMG
