,haciendaman,2010-02-05T08:44Z,"Hi, are the UK subs hardcoded on this? I don't watch films on my PC (as it's an old crap one), I burn them to DVD. Cheers!"
[T],artpepper,2010-05-29T22:26Z,"No, the subs are a separate .srt file. Terrific film and thanks for the upload but be warned--the english subs are atrocious. It's painfully obvious that a non-english speaking (or desperately non-fluent) French person sat there with an English-French dictionary and just translated literally. 

Eye-wateringly wooden and clumsy. If you're not a French speaker (I am so I dispensed with the subs), be prepared to wince a lot..."
