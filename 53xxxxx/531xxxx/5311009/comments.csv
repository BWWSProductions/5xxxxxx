,ericplayzbass,2010-01-31T02:33Z,"im a die hard scrubs fan too. and I like the new scrubs. it's nothing like the original but i like the change, they did it well."
,Veyron78,2010-02-03T07:48Z,"It's not Scrubs anymore... It's just ""Scrubsy"". They certainly haven't lost the Scrubs feel but it's definitely not the same. They converted well given the fact that the main character JD is no longer apart of the show."
