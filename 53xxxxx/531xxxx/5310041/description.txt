Film Detail:

  

Marathi Movie Zenda starring Pushkar Shotri, Neha Joshi, Tejashree Pradhan, Rajesh Shrungarpure, Ujwala Jog .. is releasing on 08 January 2010. Avadhoot Gupte is the Director, Singer, Script Writer & Music director of film Zenda 


Zenda, a Marathi movie based on the ideological differences between the two warring Thackerays  Uddhav and Raj. And the filmmaker Avadhoot Gupte seemed quite tense last night when his film premiered in Pune. In fact, Gupte has extended his invitation to both the Thackerays for premiere in Mumbai.
.
According to Gupte, the film is based on the split in the party and the confusion and reactions among party workers.

In Zenda, I have tried to portray the minds of four youngsters; their understanding of politics and their perception of Raj and Uddhav,├óΓé¼┬¥ he said.

The film also touches  upon important subjects including the Marathi manoos agenda and Maharshtrians versus the ├óΓé¼╦£outsiders├óΓé¼Γäó issue, he added.

In fact, the Uddhav-Raj tussle can happen in any party. It can also be applicable to Sharad Pawar├óΓé¼Γäós Nationalist Congress Party too, Gupte remarked.

├óΓé¼┼ôThis is not only the story of Prashant and Rajesh Sarpotdar (Uddhav and Raj Thackeray) alone. The film is serious and not a political satire,├óΓé¼┬¥ Gupte said.

Marathi actor Pushkar Shroti and Rajesh Shrungarpure play Uddhav and Raj Thackeray respectively. ├óΓé¼┼ôWe have only one scene where we face each other,├óΓé¼┬¥ said Shrotri.
