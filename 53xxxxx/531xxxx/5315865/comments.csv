,2raghu,2012-04-10T22:01Z,"when you mount the iso, open the drive to see the files. From the crack folder copy the exe file into your personal folder. After the successfull installation replace the exe in programfiles/EA sports/nba 2003 folder with exe copied from crack folder.
now start the game and enjoy!!"
