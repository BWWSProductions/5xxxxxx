Since The Sultan of Thought himself lacks the discipline of seeding his own music (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4072029/sapht_-_Hackertarar_2002-2007) I'll do the work by request from the general population.

My favourites, the ones you shouldn't miss, include:
Chocolate Mushrooms:
        A Lemon Jelly-inspired summer track including guitar-riffs.
        One of the more psychedelic tracks.
Corel Captivity
        A remix of 'The Sandy Badlands' by Nobuo Uematsu in Final
        Fantasy 7. It is fueled by two classic breaks and a fat de-
        tuned subbish saw Bass.
Supply and Demand
        This is a 210 bpm track at 3/4. It feels dynamic and is
        constructed upon a tight beat and bass, layered upon with
        a catchy vibraphone riff and mixed with crashes and trum-
        pets. It carries some trancy feelings as well.
Pyramid Extended
        This track is a phased out fucking juggernaut. When I
        listen to it in the right mood it brings the effect Goa and
        Acid Trance tends to have. However, I've listened to it too
        much now. In my ears it has lost it's magic. I hope you are
        able to experience it in the way I could before. =)

Some tracks are really old, such as Vinterskog and Kakor. These
are included for novelty purpose only ;D

The tracks can be made available as FLAC at request. If you
wish to contact me in this or any other matter, please mail me
at sapht (at) bithackse. Any feedback is appreciated! =)

That's all for now, thanks for spreading my music! =)
