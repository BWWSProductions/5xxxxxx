This is the album that made BjÃ¶rn Skifs and his band BlÃ¥blus (Blue swede) famous with the cover "Hooked on a feeling" which reached number one on the Billboard list in 1974. 

BjÃ¶rn Skifs got (together with Bengt Palmers) a few years later hits in Sweden like "Michelangelo" and "Det blir alltid vÃ¤rre framÃ¥t natten". In the 1980s BjÃ¶rn got into TV shows like â€œNÃ¶jesmassakernâ€ and â€œKryzzâ€. The movie "Strul" from 1988 was a huge hit, and he was again noticed internationally when "Hooked on a feeling" was featured in Quentin Tarantino's "Reservoir dogs".

In later years he has returned to music. He is born in 1947 in Vansbro, Sweden.
