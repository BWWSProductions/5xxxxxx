Unlike many AutoCAD competitors, this book covers only the basics and uses mixed units _ inches, meters, feet, kilometers, etc., to illustrate the myriad drawing and editing tools for this popular application. AutoCAD 2009 Essentials includes 21 workshops, that complete small projects from concept through actual plotting. Solving all of the workshops will simulate the creation of a real life project from beginning to end, without overlooking any of the basic commands and functions in AutoCAD 2009.
