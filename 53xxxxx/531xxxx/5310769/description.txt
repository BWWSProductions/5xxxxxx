his information contained in this guide will show you how to make a guaranteed return from the free bets and bonuses offered by online bookmakers as an incentive to potential new customers.
You may have seen advertisements on UK television, in newspapers or online by the larger bookies such as Ladbrokes, Betfred, Skybet and William Hill. All these companies make millions of pounds profit year in and year out, and they all need a continuous supply of NEW customers to grow their businesses.
The bonuses they offer vary from one bookie to the next but the general principle is usually the same: If you join and have a bet then they will give you a FREE BET, usually to the same value as your first one.
For example, if you join Stan James and have a Â£25 bet then, once the event  you bet on (be it a horse, a football match, a tennis match or whatever you fancied betting on) is over and the bet is settled, you will receive a Â£25 FREE BET on the event of your choice.
Thatâ€™s all well and good but, if your first bet loses and then your second bet is also unsuccessful, then you will be Â£25 out of pocket and the bookies will be Â£25 better off.
That is GAMBLING and is the complete opposite of what this guide is all about!
I will show you how easy it is to make a guaranteed return from not only your two bets at Stan James but from a whole list of established, safe and well respected bookies â€“ to the tune of over Â£1000.
At no point will there be the slightest risk to your stake - all you have to do is read the guide and follow the instructions. Itâ€™s fun AND itâ€™s risk-free.
