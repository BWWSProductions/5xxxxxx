,madtown4,2010-01-27T19:49Z,"just to let you know , where i live there are people who cant afford to go any where they have no money for intertainment .So when i give them these movies , it takes there minds off of what they cant do in life , even if it's just for 2 hours. There alot of little kids that wouldnt be able to see alvin and the chip munks 2 ,so when i get a movie from you or anyone else. its people like them who bennefit from what you do . Thanks for your time & i hope to see more movies from you ."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-27T20:13Z,"@surajitghosh37: I did Hard Candy and 13 going on 30 - but as XviD and about couple of years ago. I don't have sources anymore, just encodes buried (and burned) in the archive.

Both movies are great, but, as currently things going (I have today re-seeded from 0% a movie upped three days ago) I am unwilling to do any movie which is not either some hit-film or some masterpiece or simply - movie I like. 

Requests would be accepted as before - with 48h obligation for requester to stay as seeder BUT only if he have and is willing to provide decent (fast) upload speed (let say over 50 kB/s for whole time period.

I know, it may sound harsh or rigid, but that decision has been made because people placed requests, I have spend my time fulfilling their wishes - and they've never showed up to pick up the goods. Or, more recently, after the download, they have set their upload speed at 3kB/s and let others to starve to death.

Things might change, but knowing the nature of humans I doubt they will."
[V],twentyforty,2010-01-27T20:28Z,"@madtown4: I live for and because of this people. I don't know if you have ever read my texts (I made many people sick of it and for a fact have rattled to many cages), I always have accentuated that whole purpose of my work are these children and these people. Not the glory or fame or god-forbid to buy immortality, but as I told on ""name-not-to-be-spoken"" many many times, to make people happier and their lives little bit brighter or provide them with some kind of shelter of suffering that is around."
