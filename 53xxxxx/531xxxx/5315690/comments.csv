,shameonu,2010-01-31T10:34Z,when it say crack copy from the folder to golder giveme2entitlements.exe ... Mass effecct 2 BioGame what the hell does that mean?
,k-line,2010-02-01T07:12Z,"shameonu, just copy the crack (giveme2entitlements.exe) to your mass effect 2 folder (the folder containing MassEffect2Launcher.exe) and run it, _after_ gettting all of your DLC installed"
,lordvr,2010-02-02T19:37Z,"Doesn't work for me.
Even after running the crack
it still says DLC unauthorized when I start up.
I copy the crack turn off the stuff for online and run the crack to no avail."
,k-line,2010-02-08T01:12Z,database error?
,k-line,2010-02-08T01:12Z,"
i actually got and tested this version
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5312494/Mass_Effect_2_DLC_Pack_[PC___Multi6]
but i believe the files are the same.
also i suspect that it might not work if one installed dlc before disabling in game online options as well as banning the exe file from going to the internet in windows firewall (or any other fireware you are running). if that's the case, i think you might have to uninstall the game and clean up the registry and user data associated with this game, before trying again."
,k-line,2010-02-08T01:13Z,"lordvr, if you are using vista/win7, be sure to give the crack admin rights (run as admin or something)."
,surajitghosh37,2010-02-15T04:22Z,how do i log in the game before installing?
,ceyuan,2010-02-17T01:12Z,"My game freezes whenever i try to equip shepard with dlc weapons, the armor work fine and i've done  the normandy crash mission. Does anyone know why this happens? and when i equip Garrus with the incisor sniper it does not freeze."
,druid513,2010-03-13T11:36Z,"1. Simply double click to install any update that you need, you dont have to install all of them. 2. Then, copy crack ""giveme2entitlements"" to ""Binaries"" folder and run ""giveme...."". 
3. Use MassEffect2.EXE from ""Binaries"" to start game. done. "
