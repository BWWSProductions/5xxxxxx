just wondering if I should get it?"
,EpicPlayer,2010-02-05T13:08Z,"Huuh, kingar? Can you tell me how this copy is activated? Just to be sure... I won't appreciate to restart from the beginning according the fact that I don't have a lot of free time and it took me days for my computer to set up: In ""Computer"" properties, it now says ""1 day until automatic activation. Activate Windows now..."".
Just after I installed it (two days ago), it was saying ""3 days until automatic activation..."".

I wonder if the Windows Activator have been
fooled or if tommorow my computer will be unusable?"
