,zato1,2010-01-27T05:03Z,Quality? Better than re-synced screener? Does the scr version have watermarks or messages? Thanks.
,skibbeb,2010-01-27T17:12Z,audio still kinda sucks... its hard for me to watch but that could just be me.
,assimi,2010-01-29T02:21Z,Audio is better that every R5 Line but It's not as good as DVDrip
,bychance,2010-01-29T06:06Z,"An excellent upload, thanks again."

,sybilfault,2010-02-01T04:34Z,"hey raymondhome, nice job on your Imaginarium version at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5308398/ImaginariumDocParnassus_DVDSCRLiNE_READNFO_RESYNC_XViD_IMAGiNE. 
the audio for that one is a bit difficult but all in all it's a fantastic dl. 
A:5 V:9 
Just curious, though, is the audio on this one significantly improved from the audio on that torrent link? Or, since you seem to have several torrents of this film, are any of them significantly improved over that one? b/c I'm ready to watch this film again and again."
,alhajer7,2010-03-01T18:13Z,"V: 10 A: 3 (with-out subs i would lost it! )

I hope they release a better audio rip!"
,black francis,2010-03-02T05:17Z,"Great upload and absolutely fantastic movie!

Terry Gilliam is such a great filmmaker. Too bad the studio ruined his Grimm movie. This movie was a brilliant piece of satire and I would highly recommend it to anyone with something other than air between the ears. It's also visually stunning, brilliantly acted and directed and very funny. 

Colin Farrell does an incredible role portraying another famous actor and for once I was not annoyed by the presence of Tom Waits.

Truley amazing movie which I will now purchase when released on blu-ray. Thanks again."
,AAAteam,2010-03-03T13:50Z,"thanks for the torrent but like all the R5s of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, it has terrible audio and doesn't make the movie justice. I'll wait for a better rip."
