First, you must install a program which can download some files with ""torrent"". Torrent itself is just kind of ""tour guide"", small file of just few kilobytes. Google and install for instance, program called uTorrent, and follow the setup instructions found on uTorrent site, by letter. Let someone to help you, if you get stuck or do not understand terms and procedures. Basically, it all comes to setting one's firewall, modem or router and program itself. It is easy, even for beginners, to find and learn the basics of ""torrenting"". Just spend couple of hours on Google and you'll find zillions of guides, blogs and tips about.
When you have completed all things said, come again and click on ""Download this torrent"", save the torrent on your Desktop and exit the browser. Then you could either double-click on that saved torrent and uTorrent program would start automatically with a question, asking you where do you want to save the file(s). Answer, and download will start. Or you can as first start uTorrent program, click on File>Add torrent and navigate to the torrent saved on Desktop, click on it, then on OK and download will start, same as with double-clicking explained before. There is an option of ""Magnet links"" but you should start on easier and simpler way."
