I here some distortion in the bass using MPC for playback. Are there some recommended settings or a better player available?

Cheers!"
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-01-29T01:41Z,How hard is it to read the description?It's right under your nose.Notes: For best performance I suggest you to use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback.Next time I'll write it with big red letters so that you'll see it. :|

All your contributions are great so I skip the A/V-quality.
People will know by now that you upload only the best.

A very nice movie about a frigid woman and an impotent man."
