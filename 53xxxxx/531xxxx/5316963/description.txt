Topics: Music / Art / Culture

Sevdah is one of the world's great undiscovered musical forms, equal in beauty to Portuguese Fado and Argentine tangos.



Sevdah is a Turkish word which means love. It is influenced by Ukrainian, Greek, Romanian, Gypsy, Sephardic Jewish and Ottoman Turkish music, which merged in the cross-cultural melting pot of Balkan towns. Whatever its exact definition, it is a music which, after a few notes, makes your heart feel too big for your chest.



There are numerous instrumental pieces and songs performed by professional and folk musicians revealing the importance of this music to post war (1992-1995) Bosnian identity. This is a view into a world of great beauty and harrowing darkness, ultimately addressing questions of cultural identity standing against barbarism.
