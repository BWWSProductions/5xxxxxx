,AQuickAlias,2010-01-31T00:59Z,Why is this an EXE file...?
,espirates,2010-02-11T20:28Z,It's most likely spam or a virus
,dwdtfan,2010-02-26T13:24Z,"I agree with AQuickAlias on this, there's no reason to make this a Windows exe. Fonts are platform independent.

That said, how the hell do I extract these on a non-Windows computer?"
,pixelperu,2010-03-03T21:56Z,"What is the problem??

Run your antivirus and U will find out, do not ask.
If your antivirus do not say anything, run kaspersky and U will find everything where another antivirus do not find nohitng."
