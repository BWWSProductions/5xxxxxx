,sistromo,2010-01-28T23:22Z,The uneducated flocking to hear the braying. How quaint.
,trickdaddy0024,2010-01-29T02:26Z,Glad to see Obama had the courage to call out the Supreme Court..Face to Face...Too bad not one had any BALLS to defend themselves...END
,BarrySoetoro,2010-01-29T05:01Z,"sistromoo has yet to provide a single citation... nothing but lame opinions.

Pretty boring. :/"

Thanks for the upload jwhitt."
[T],jwhitt62,2010-01-29T21:48Z,"Tricky...just like Rush said...only tin-pot despots and dictators insult their Supreme Courts the way ""The Chosen One"" did. The only thing more pathetic that NObama's juvenile bullying are the sycophants who praise him for it.

P.S. I see Sister's vocabulary is growing...too bad his/her intellect isn't."
,wafwot,2010-02-02T03:50Z,The members of the Supreme Court have too much class to respond...unlike the arrogant asshole that tossed the lie at them.
,trickdaddy0024,2010-02-28T16:41Z,The Supreme Court knows they all have the right to free speech...If they decide not to exercise that then blame them not Obama...END
