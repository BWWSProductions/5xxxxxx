,cinesimon,2010-01-28T18:00Z,"	Given the stated run time and file sizeI think this may be the anime feature film in which six directors present their take on Dante's inferno - and is due for commercial release on feb 9.
The release described above is a 20 minute Italian puppet-style animation - in other words: I'm pretty sure what is here, and what is described as here, are two different things!

If I'm correct, this is correctly titled 'Dantes Inferno Animated Epic'

Hopefully the uploader will fill us in shortly..."

I hope this one is better than that 2007 ""animated"" jew propaganda piece of $hit. I'lllet you know after I find the time to see it.""

What animated $hit was that? Animated ""jew propaganda""? Lion King? Donald Duck? 
You will let us know what after you have seen it?
Do we care what you think?
You should work on the hatred thing of yours."
,jayonara,2010-01-30T06:06Z,Is the quality any good?? =D
,righteousone,2010-01-30T12:00Z,what's wrong with Jewish people? They all seem pretty swell to me.

,raiden395,2010-02-03T07:03Z,"@ israeli-scum: Although I question your literacy, I decided I'd take the time to answer your nonsense:  you're a fucking moron and your religion is a man made fairy-tale that breeds incompetency and personal weakness through requiring your members deny themselves that which is most natural to a human, further contributing to mental illness and, as many Christians have begun to take notice, child molestation.  

So please, do us all a favor, and next time, before spewing your pseudo-racist religious idiocy onto torrent comment boxes, remember to get your head completely in front of the barrel.  As far as I'm concerned you may as well have been a hand-job."

pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"

please can you upload something to the community and get your dark mentality away because as i see you didn't uploaded shit just some !@#$%^&blablabla"
,raiden395,2010-02-04T10:11Z,"Alright: 

Have read the book, have watched half the movie and let me just say, there is very little similarity between the two in terms of content, however, the scenery is as epic as ever.  

If I rent this game and it is exactly as this movie is, I will be fucking pissed.

The story is horrible, the writers are FUCKING terrible, and there are some strange scenes involving crucifixes and nudity; now that's not to say it's not a bad thing to have nudity or what the fuck ever you'd call it with cartoons, but all the same, just a little too epic with the cross and god nonsense.  It offends the agnostic as much as I believe it has offended the Christians."
,QoMSoL,2010-02-06T08:51Z,"Looks like a lot of bull$hit is in the comments. It's just a cartoon guys. Yes it's a kind of a propaganda tool but if religion affects your life so strongly just keep away from stuff like this cuz it'll always get you pissed.
Peace."
,vincentfunk,2010-02-10T08:00Z,"Fuck the jews... Who gives a shit about those assholes? Big deal, a few hundred thousand died in WWII. And they've been reminding us ever since... No one ever brings up how many people died in other wars or even in africa, as I write this ethnic cleansing and warlords are destroying towns and killing indiscriminately. But everyone gets all touchy when someone says anything bad about jews. Fuckem, and fuck you for defending them. What good have they brought the world? And why should praise and protect them against any slander that any other race would recieve... People defend jews for no fucking reason. They wouldn't defend a crackhead, or a bum, but a race that's hated my millions of people. They'll defend them... Keep propaganda off torrents. Cuz this is what happens... "
,SK3TCH78,2010-02-10T10:44Z,I don't know why everyone is going all gung ho on everyone elses religion. Religion and politics are two things you should all know better then to discuss with complete strangers. you're just asking for a verbal enima. Get over it and just watch the free movies these awesome people have shared with us. Why is that so fucking hard?
,H_0_o_d,2010-02-13T22:10Z,What is with all the rars?
,deathmagnetic65,2010-02-15T20:54Z,come on people cant we keep our personal bulshit to ourselves and just rate the audio and video? seriously...
,h64,2010-02-16T09:48Z,rars are stupid. cant extract.
,raiden395,2010-02-17T00:52Z,"We're all entitled to our opinions; who gives a shit about all this racist garbage any ways.  What I'd like to get across is that this movie is really fucking shitty.  I wouldn't bother downloading or watching it for any reason whatsoever.  This is a cheap rip-off of a literary masterpiece, what fucking useless cinematic drivel."
,dlarrym,2010-02-18T07:37Z,"@ h64: .rar files are super easy to open unless you have no brain..... the saftware to open it is FREE and a Google request away..... it is so easy.... when you see all the .rar files.... there might be 1 through 36.... just for example.... using stuffit expander, drag and drop the 1 .rar file onto the ""expand"" icon, and wait. ....... after a few moments, the movie file be it an .avi, .mov, mkv, h264..... or what ever it is, will be found in the folder you told the expander to put it in (default is on your desk top....) .... how can you do anything on a home computer if the task of opening a .rar file baffels you and is confusing.... that is like saying that finding my way out of a public restroom is difficult...??? I NEVER under stood why there is this FEAR o r .RAR archieved files??? its not so different then a ZIP file??? or HQX???? what is the big deal.... this is DOS PC1 simple stuff..... BASIK and PASCAL is much easier then opeing an .rar.... I took PASCAL in 10th grade highschool for gods sake???? UNIX in 11th and these morons can't un zip a .rar file????? only the most basic, easy, a fucking retard can do it kind of simple.... Helen Keller can open a .rar file.... she was blind and deaf.... even Steven Hawking can open a .rar file.... even Al Gore can open a .rar file..... even Christen Applegate can open a .rar file.... EVEN Gary Busey can open a .rar file and he can do this while in rehab... Even Hulk Hogans son NICK Hogan can open a .rar file and he can do it from the anger management classes and he opened some, in the rehab he was in while in jail... he eeven opened a .rar file that had an MP3 inside with a recording of him and his dad talking about he can make a bunch of money from a book about his juvey experience and how he was more concerned about the money he might make from a book deal then he was concerned about the other person he hit in the accident he was in. LMFAO,,,,"

,zawdxs,2010-09-01T06:17Z,"Ok seriously...propaganda? Are you all retarded? Look at the history of Dantes Inferno, its about a 1500's italian author who was banished from his country for falling in love with the queen. The Inferno is one of 3 parts that make up the Divine Comedy. Its a metaphorical journey about him going through hell, purgatory, and eventually to paradise. You're all fucking paranoid about government or christian propaganda, get over it. "
,WOTskaas,2011-06-04T16:17Z,"Woah ... crazy comments....

Let's get some down to Earth perspective (Excuse the Pun)

First let us clear up something - This animation is purely EA's rendition ported from their GAME
-------------------------------------------------------
Audio: 8
Video: 9

For a 700MB compressed Xvid/AVI file you can't excpect much better.... if you do - I suggest you cease downloading and go buy a DVD
--------------------------------------------------------
To begin with may I stress that the ""Writers"" of this ""Animation"" DID NOT dream up, create or write the ORIGINAL story..... so I would disregard that from the offset.

Animation: 7 - I have seen a lot worse in terms of actual ""Drawing"" quality
 (*example: One Piece, which is STILL and excellent anime) 

The animation for the most part is fluid, sleek and captivating....using a variety of mediums, though in opinion only, could use a bit of cleaning up....

Story: 9 - Please Please do note that this is based upon someone (could use citation) else's work....

It is in my opinion the writers did VERY well to capture the nature and ""Intention"" of the meaning ...... point blank ....

More information on Dante's Inferno ""Comedy Poem"" can be found here: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)
--------------------------------------------------------
Let us ignore baseless comments and simply judge the movie itself for what it is.

Overall 8/10

Slick smooth NON STOP story and action..... I've re-watched this story three times now and enjoyed equally per watch...

This movie contains morale issues that confront everyone every single day - You must read between the lines and retain it's true meaning

I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a bit of imagination"
,9Velja9,2012-03-09T00:15Z,"Ppl, this movie is great, don't listen to this dumb commenters. Anyway, watch it yourself, and than you'll see how great it is."
