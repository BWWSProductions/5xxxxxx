This is a remaster of a (very) American dramatization broadcast on National Public Radio in 1979.
This version was packaged in attractive wooden gift box.
Theater for the mind.
This LOTR trilogy includes: 
The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King

/ Personal note: I'm not personally a fan of dramatizations, but it IS a 
/ worthy effort. I probably wouldn't recommend this for veterens of Tolkien.
/ It often sounds like a glorified Oklahoma high school play production.
/ Might be terrific for mature youngsters, dramtization fans, first time 
/ or hard core Tolkieners, or the Oklahoma high school drama department.
/ Lots of other readings and dramatizations out there (BBC etc).
/ Nice that this one includes Tom Bombadil - the BBC's version did not.
/ Might help to remember - this is 1979 radio!

Nicely tagged and labeled, combined CD tracks, cover scans included.

Thanks for sharing & caring.
Cheers, FerraBit

Review:

There's this ring, see...

(And then there was this desperate drama department...)
- - -

This thing all things devours:
Birds, beasts, trees, killer super-powers;
Gnaws iron in stiletto heel;
Grinds overacting actors to meal;
Slays king, ruins town
And beats Oklahoma high school down.
