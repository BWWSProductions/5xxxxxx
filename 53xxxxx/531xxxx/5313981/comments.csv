,flameguster,2010-01-29T17:42Z,why is this upload so huge fellas?? all civil war and secret invasion sagas were a max of 1.2 GB and they had more comixx.......
[T],Juan.Too,2010-01-30T03:22Z," @ flameguster

Dark Reign has about twice as many comics as Secret Invasion or Civil War.

That would explain why this torrent is about twice as large as the Civil War or Secret Invasion torrents."
,ryan138,2010-02-01T03:24Z,So what is in this mega file that wasn't in your monthly Dark Reign files? I have up through December and was waiting for January. Thanks for compiling!
[T],Juan.Too,2010-02-01T05:06Z,"@ ryan138

I decided not to upload a ""Dark Reign - January"" because there were only two Dark Reign releases in January.  I decided it wasn't really worth it.

If you've grabbed all of my previous Dark Reign uploads, you've got almost everything already.  You actually probably have more than you should - since there wasn't ever an official checklist, I tended to err on the side of over-cautiousness.  However, I did manage to miss some things here and there (again, no checklist).

So, if you have all of my previous ups, I would check Dark Reign: Hawkeye, Thunderbolts, and War Machine.  Those were the ones with omissions, I believe."

[T],Juan.Too,2010-02-26T23:11Z,"@ alexvdl

That's odd.
Nothing I have ever uploaded or ever will upload requires a password to access.  That usually indicates some kind of phishing scam.

My only advice would be to try downloading it again."
,Davidbar5,2010-03-22T16:18Z,"first thanks for the great uploads.

2nd, did you upload Inv.Iron Man 20(stark diassembled)? or hasnt come out yet?"
[T],Juan.Too,2010-03-23T04:26Z,"@ Davidbar5

Well, issue 24 of Iron Man came out this month (March) completing the ""Stark: Disassembled"" storyline.  Issue 20 isn't in this torrent because it's not part of Dark Reign.
I did a quick search on TPB and found issue 20 here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5186292/New_Comics_Week_Nov_25_2009
Or if that's not being seeded well enough, just google ""iron man 020"" and you'll come across it pretty quickly."

,hunterelf,2011-05-02T16:30Z,"i dont think it's complete, i read the punisher series but it didnt end, so as iron man "
,ufalum88,2011-11-01T01:13Z,"I think the effort put into this was awesome....but it is far from complete.  Plus, it has book which are not involved.  Here is a listing:  http://marvel.wikia.com/Dark_Reign"
,Ragernaut,2012-06-05T22:58Z,"Hey, just wondering ~ Why Exodus and Utopia aren't part of the list?"
