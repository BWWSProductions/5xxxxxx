,kvestantin,2010-01-28T21:46Z,"2nafish, I'm sorry - regarding Kiss' videos...

You said you can redo these (Kiss) clips... Can you just tell please - redo from what source? This is what I would like to know, if possible. What was the source from which you can make 8000 kbps or 3000-4000 kbps?
Speaking honestly I am looking not for the bitrate fugures of course. But for the picture of MAXIMUM quality. And the maximum quality is always in the original source, before all the transitions and ripping this source to new files or formats. Maybe I could try to find these source files also, if you tell where they come from. "

[V],2nafish,2010-01-29T09:53Z,For kvestantin: Files are from a friend on DVDs and I just edit them. I had settings on CBR instead of VBR so the videos came out at 4000kbs and I noticed too late. 
,kvestantin,2010-01-29T16:53Z,"2nafish, if you really can cut these clips from your friend's DVD one more time, and this time in 'direct stream copy' mode instead of transcoding or ripping them, I would be very grateful to you for uploading them then!!! )))
Thanks for your uploads!"
[V],2nafish,2010-01-30T05:37Z,You are asking me to upload videos that I just uploaded a few days ago and I can't do that. I have requests from the Suprbay Forum and here at TPB to upload and I just can't fit those in. Sorry.
