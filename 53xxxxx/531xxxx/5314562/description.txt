"She's Out of My Life" is a song written by musical artist Tom Bahler. He wrote the song about Karen Carpenter, who broke up with Bahler after discovering he had fathered a child with another woman. The song has been recorded by a variety of artists, including: Michael Jackson, Patti LaBelle, Ginuwine, 98 Degrees, Jon Lee, Barbara Mandrell, Willie Nelson, and Josh Groban.

The song became famous as the fourth single to be released by singer Michael Jackson from his successful Off the Wall album in 1979. It was the first time a solo artist had achieved four top ten hits from one album. Unlike the album's previous singles (which were all dance-oriented funk/disco songs), the "She's Out of My Life" song was an emotional ballad. Jackson's vocals on the record were considered by critics to be some of his best.

A poignant moment in the song occurs near the end when Jackson begins to break down in tears as he sings the word "life". Given the popular response to his emotional rendition, the song remained in Jackson's live set for many years. Although he had attempted to record the song's last few moments with emotional restraint, after numerous tries he continued to end the rendition the same - by breaking down in tears. Producer Quincy Jones subsequently let Jackson's tearful recording stand:

    She's Out of My Life, I'd been carrying around for about three yearsâ€”you can feel the pain in it, you know. And I held on to it and finally something said 'this is the right moment to give it to Michael'.

    And when we recorded it with Michael, I know it was an experience he'd never even thought about to sing in a song, 'cause it's a very mature emotion. And he cried at the end of every take, you know. We recorded aboutâ€”I don't knowâ€”8-11 takes, and every one at the end, he just cried, and I said 'hey - that's supposed to be, leave it on there.'

    â€”Quincy Jones, Off the Wall 2001 Special Edition, Quincy Jones Interview 3

Jones wanted Jackson to record material with more mature themes and "feel the full range of his voice," so he brought the song to Jackson's attention, whereas he had originally intended to save the song for Frank Sinatra.

Subsequently, the song peaked at #10 in the US on the Billboard Hot 100. The single was even more successful in the UK and peaked at number 3 on the charts (the equivalent position reached by Off the Wall's debut single "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough"). A music video was also produced to promote the song, which showed Michael in a blue-green shirt, dark pants, and sitting on a barstool with a spotlight shining behind him.
