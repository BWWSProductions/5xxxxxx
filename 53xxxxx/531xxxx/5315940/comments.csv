Do people who get upset by language or sexuality even know how to download these ""christian friendly"" edited movies?"
,Balthazar7,2010-01-28T22:39Z,"Why Christian friendly?
Why not Jewish orthodox, all of Islam, even the Dalai Lama, Zen Buddhism, claims we as adults MUST protect the minds and hearts of children.

In your individual case it is quite clear your soul is beyond hope. No big deal for you as you can take comfort in your Darwinian evolved monkey status where nothing matters for we are pre-programmed genetic biological machines with no meaning or purpose to this Earth."
,PhilLesh12,2010-01-28T23:54Z,"dude, sorry if your brain is so under-developed that you can only see the world in such stark terms.

Why do you believe that people can ONLY be absolutist fundamentalists (of any sect, creed or doctrine) or anti-religion darwinists?

Have you ever heard of the reformation?  Or even just rational thought?

People can have faith without being fundamentalist, bigoted and closed-minded zealots.

Reasonable people can handle a little nudity or a ""fuck"" or a ""shit"" spoken here or there, without it becoming a crisis of identity or faith."
,Balthazar7,2010-01-29T01:19Z,"Phil; baby:
I never made any dogmatic assertions it is you how made that in your very first post - besides you?re grossly overstating your case.

Re: or even just rational thought
Social science studies done at respected universities throughout the western word
continue to draw the same conclusion about developing minds in childhood. This is why every modern nation has some kind of ratings system. G, PG, PG-13, R, XXX or some equivalent. I suspect you have no children of your own.
