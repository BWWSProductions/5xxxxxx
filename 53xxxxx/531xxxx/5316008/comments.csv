,mnuva,2010-02-20T13:15Z,"ZIP, RAR, what does it matter? i compressed it myself.
And the cheat file works great for me!"
,redryu666,2011-04-06T07:17Z,"I've been downloading ROMs ffor like 6 years now, and DS ones for 3 years; 90% were RAR files, and 99.989% of the DS ones were RAR, so i don't know what B2theK is talking about. Still didn't download this one though.......purely cause mnuva didn't mention when it was implemented and which games included cheats"
