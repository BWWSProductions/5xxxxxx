This is not my torrent. I took downloaded it from mukatat3, whom I don't know. Basically I am a student that would like to see a greater spread of educational programs like this one. I happen to study bones, and this is an elegant program. I am unsure whether this is the full version or not. I downloaded the trail, and the size differs (heavier on the trail version). This seems to be fully functional, and it is clean (Tested in linux virtualbox windows 7 & eset smart security 4). If you discover this is not the full version, leave a note. If you know where the full version might be for this, bonelab II or anatomylab II, leave a note please.
