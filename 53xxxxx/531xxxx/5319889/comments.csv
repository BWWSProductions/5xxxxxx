,Critic_101,2010-01-30T10:14Z,"Well ur rips are high quality right aspect ratio and all the other extras, but can u tell me why of recent ur uploading certain bluray rips which are of german source coz two of rips i downloaded had german text hardcoded in them. The two in question being nothing but the truth and hurtlocker. If need be to upload such rips with german text maybe u could mention it or if u could overlay the german text with eng sub hardcoded over it thanx for all the good flicks, just a humble suggestion and at most there just few lines of text here and there but of importance to the flick. Keep up the good work HR!) "

And if so, how do I remove them?"

The title clearly says ""AVATAR- Creating the world of Pandora"" and second if you think one extra second thinking this is the actual movie, try thinking again with some sort of reality.

@kostekdm Are you retarded? Just guessing.
