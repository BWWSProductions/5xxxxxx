there's also a lecture:

horowitz is the guy that proved the 2001 anthrax mailings actually came from the u.s. military. awesome guy!

    A recent study examining the effects 2.4 GHz radiation (which is the frequency of radiation emitted by Wifi routers and microwave ovens) on the heart was just completed. The study found ?unequivocal evidence? that microwave frequency radiation affects the heart at non-thermal levels that are well below federal safety guidelines, according to Dr. Magda Havas of Trent University[4] .

    Dr. Havas says:

        ?This is the first study that documents immediate and dramatic changes in both heart rate and heart rate variability caused by an approved device that generates microwaves at levels well below (0.3 percent) federal guidelines in both Canada and the United States.?

    No longer can skeptics claim that microwaves produce no immediate biological effects at ordinary household levels!

And no matter who you trust or not on this field of research and knowledge, no one in their right mind can believe that for instance 2 Watts transmissions at up to 2,4 Ghz frequencies from your cellphone. penetrating your brain at least 5 cm [about two inches] deep at cellular, nucleus level [that's right where your DNA lives, and it's also about 10% of your braincells..] is good for you. Tumors and headaches and fatigue are just some of the ""undocumented features"" [Intel slang for ""bugs""..] of long term mobile phone usage..

""A brain is a terrible thing to fry"", to quote.. ..Ahmm.. ..me.. ;-\

Then add to it all the other electron-""matter"" that's increasing in strength and transmission points every day..

I almost miss Dial-up Internet, and I definitely miss those things we had before, with a wire running from an ear/mouthpiece into a box with numbered buttons and a wire connected to the wall and a copper-wire, and we could talk to each other on it, just like a cellphone.. What was the name again..? It was Tele..""-something..

Aah.. Those were the days.."
