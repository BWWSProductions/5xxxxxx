,Sdarts,2010-01-26T20:26Z,"It works, at least to all the DLC's besides the Zaeed one. Still downloading it as it is 480 MBs.
Great work and thank you very much to however did it.

^_^"
,Zagza,2010-01-26T20:37Z,"nice to hear that it's working. don't know why the zaeed one didn't work cause it works on my computer.

oh yeah big thanks to the guy who made the crack from this site:http://narod.ru/disk/17292172000/giveme2entitlements.zip.html"
,oohhleo,2010-01-26T20:43Z,thank you!!!!
,esir99,2010-01-26T20:57Z,i hope this workin' properly..Thanks Dude..
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T21:17Z,"important note! for those who still have some issues preventing the activation screen from appearing - try this: after installing the fresh copy of the game, what you should immediately do BEFORE starting the game for the first time, is to check out the exceptions menu of your firewall settings, and make sure that the checkboxes next to 'Mass Effect 2 Game' and 'Mass Effect 2 Game Launcher' aren't ticked in. in my case, the game puts itself amond the firewall exceptions by default after having been installed. as far as I understand, if you prevent the game from accessing the net, you should be able to get the dlc's to work without any problems.
last but not least: loads of thanks and appreciation for all the people who helped us in obtaining the dlc packs, not to mention the genius minds behind the invaluable entitlement crack. : ) your heroic dedication shall be remembered for generations to come. : )"
,makrayzs,2010-01-26T21:49Z,now let's keep our eyes peeled for the upcoming Hammerhead DLC! : P
,Sdarts,2010-01-26T21:56Z,"@ Zagza

nice to hear that it's working. don't know why the zaeed one didn't work cause it works on my computer.

Sorry for the confusion, i meant that i still haven't tried the Zaeed DLC because i'm still downloading it.
But by the other users' comments, it seems that all DLC's work with the crack.
Does anyone know who made the crack?
Wanted to thank them. A lot."
,Overlard,2010-01-26T22:13Z,"Zaeed is a crap character, you cant even talk to him like you can to the rest of the party. :("
,piccolo52,2010-01-26T22:26Z,so the zaeed character work's or not???
,Zagza,2010-01-26T22:34Z,zaeed works
,piccolo52,2010-01-26T22:38Z,Then LOVE YOU!!!
,genestarwind2007,2010-01-26T23:45Z,"It works, thx."
[T],Knaster,2010-01-26T23:45Z,Super!!!
,Klimt_Westwood,2010-01-26T23:50Z,"Big thanks to the uploader and everyone involved in cracking the DLC.

Does M-490 Blackstorm Projector (""pre-order item only, available at Gamestop"") come with this?

Now if only someone would upload the Prima eGuide."
,maul_inc,2010-01-27T00:26Z,"It works! everything works! Even Zaed :D

Klimt_Westwood: M-490 Blackstorm Projector is included ;-)"
,Klimt_Westwood,2010-01-27T00:37Z,Whoo-hoo! Singularities all around!
,NeHoMaR,2010-01-27T00:49Z,do this work whatever language you installed game?
,makrayzs,2010-01-27T01:07Z,"though I haven't tested it that thoroughly yet, but yes, they 'should' work with all languages. the dlc exe files themselves are all from a legit source."
,McCrazy011,2010-01-27T02:46Z,"I can't seem to get this to work, I've turned off online in the game, changed my firewall settings to block me2, and installed the DLC (after the changes). dropped the crack in to the root folder of me2, and all it does is stop responding while checking the DLC. However if I remove the DLCs, it gives me an option to override a file. Any help would be much appreciated."
,Erocy,2010-01-27T04:22Z,"i had the same problem but after i close my complete connection it worked, dunno why but it now workes fine :)"
,McCrazy011,2010-01-27T04:45Z,"tried turning off my connection complete and running giveme2entitlements....

still freezes up and crashes


help!"
,JustFunky,2010-01-27T05:21Z,"The crack works !! For those getting a ""don't send"" error install .NET 3.5 :http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&displaylang=en"
,jan765,2010-01-27T06:24Z,"works 100 percent. Dunno why yall getting problems. It worked even with my Firewall putting it as exception (i didnt know) but i i disabled it just now.

Cant wait for Mass Effect 3 lmao"
,Akhaz,2010-01-27T07:07Z,"Everytime I run the crak, whether it's in the main ME2 directory, the Binaries directory or the DLC directory, it crashes.

Windows 7 gives me a ""giveme2entitlements has stopped working"" message."
,Akhaz,2010-01-27T07:12Z,got it to work. SOmething to do with Microsoft Framework 3.5
,Dllfile,2010-01-27T07:30Z,"All DLC working here on Windows 7 x64 Ultimate, thnx much for the download!"
,prollygon,2010-01-27T08:16Z,"for armor and weapons, do u get them right away or are they integrated into a shop?"
,anuskasvo,2010-01-27T08:59Z,I can also tell that the crack and dlc's work perfect. Thanks!
,Klimt_Westwood,2010-01-27T11:02Z,"Works like a charm (on XP sp3). Armors (plus armor components) are in captain's cabin, weapons are in the armory, Zaeed waits to be recruited on Omega."
,adamken,2010-01-27T12:03Z,"it all works thanks alot.

i have win 7 32bit"
,fredyon,2010-01-27T15:23Z,"for all the plp with the problem you should lunch the game from Mass Effect 2 Launcher file if you do this everything works fine but if you lunch the game of the icon on your desktop you will ge the error

that is how it worked for me i hope it helps you all

and i have vista 32 by the way"
,Alnuks,2010-01-27T16:49Z,All works perfect. thanks!!!  (Windows 7 x64) 
,Trucifenix,2010-01-27T21:32Z,"works great for me. thanks! the collector's assault rifle seems to be better than the assault rifle specialization. and the sniper is pretty sweet too. Normandy crash site was depressing but very cool. Zaeed is pretty cool, some of his story bridges the story gaps behind Subject Zero and the Blue Suns. Make sure to talk to him repeatedly in the cargo hold, he has some interesting stuff to say! (And his assault rifle too)"

,crazedk1ll3r,2010-01-31T04:35Z,"I got a major problem... whenever i run the DLC files from the torrent folder, it says *Mass Effect 2 does not appear to be installed. Please install the game, and try again*, which is weird because while, the game IS installed... I even tried running it from the game directory itself but to no avail. Any help on how to solve this problem is greatly appreciated.

If it helps at all, My game directory is *D:\Program Files\Mass Effect 2*, which means that it is not in my main hard disk. does that makes any difference?"
,rpenri,2010-02-02T08:21Z,"crazedk1ll3r

Try running the files from the install folder of ME2.  It may need to be in the same drive or folder for it to work."
,Obe4ken,2010-02-02T14:43Z,does the dlc go in the binaries folder?
,crazedk1ll3r,2010-02-02T15:27Z,"Tried, failed... But thanks for the assistance anyway~ still looking for solutions anyone who knows how to fix this problem please help >.< hmm not sure if this will affect anything, but my ME2 is a cracked version and is torrented. Does this means that it will not work? By the way, when i tried running the DLC files while I'm running ME2, it can detect that ME2 is running. I'm at a seriously lost here..."
,Doomshadowz,2010-02-02T19:07Z,"Does this come with instructions on how to install it?  If not, can someone tell me?  I feel like an idiot.."
,Bujaaa,2010-02-03T18:32Z,"please,please,please someone upload dlc for xbox 360 version of the game."
,maheswar,2010-02-05T11:13Z,"Iam logging in JUST to tell you people that this one works flawlessly. Thank you and the person who created the crack. 

Just dont forget to block Mass Effect 2 in your firewall.

But it looks really weird when Shepard is wearing the Blood dragon armour. Because this was created exclusively for Dragon Age Origins. A person from the future wearing a suit from the ancient mythical world.!

Not that I am complaining, though."
,rbailor,2010-02-07T07:30Z,"I actually bought the game, though i only have the terminus armor and the weapon, would this work on my game and will i still be able to get game updates legitimately?
