,cccode,2010-02-01T23:37Z,"No serial needed. A copy, whether downloaded or from disc, looks the same to them when you efile, so no worries."
,mick0uz,2010-02-02T08:09Z,thanks cccode for the info.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
,Saveno,2010-02-07T22:07Z,"thanks, works fine."
,Tgard,2010-02-12T05:27Z,Will this one do the free state download? Or will they still jack you up for the 39.95 fee to download the state?

Absolute lifesaver!"
,rathgar2,2010-02-24T04:14Z,"Thanx, just one problem, it is only allowing me to do 1 state return.  I'm in CA I wonder if it'll let me do multiple CA state returns and that is what it means by 1 state.  So like just d/l CA, but if you want NV then you iz SOL."
,iceet,2010-03-05T03:51Z,"Here is how to obtain multiple state returns for FREE:

Install TurboTax Home and Business 2009.

Install first state. Close TurboTax Home and Business 2009.

Navigate to the following folder:
ProgramData\Intuit\TurboTax\TY09

Rename the file ""Entitlement_TTWin.xml""

Restart TurboTax Home and Business 2009 and install second state.

Rinse and repeat for all states needed. "
