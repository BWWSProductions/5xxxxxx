,Moxy39,2010-01-27T22:47Z,"Works Perfectly even if mid game. You get messages when you return to the Normandy.

Zeead works perfect for me and the Crash Site works.

You need to make sure your firewall is blocking Mass effect launcher and game. Also make sure you don't connect to Cerberus Network System or your DLC and or Game maybe classed as a pirate version and disabled."

installed everything fine, copied crack to directory and ran, it asked to save/overwrite a file and i let it. 
all items seem to be working, not tried any of the other extra missions though yet. 
but i just did a mission and had the option to leave or stay, i stayed to pick up a few extra items but the (F) function to leave is not working now.. i know it was working previously to installing these as ive already completed it. 
is anyone else having this problem with it?

workaround for now -- dont stay when asked....lol"

,rocco_sifredi,2010-01-30T12:36Z,"I figured , finally , out how the DLC works!
This is for the ones ...lost:

- First enter the game's menu normally and in OPTIONS/ONLINE...close those two...features.
- Enter your network connections/firewall settings/Exceptions and unchecked the TWO lines reffering to MASS EFFECT game.
- Run the DLC (each ""exe"")
- Copy in game's menu and run that crack
- LET THE internet connection ON ! Otherwise the game it will give that error in the main menu! And it will give also an error if you think you can solve it running again that crack.

Do all these and the game will WORK 100%"
,232323,2010-01-30T12:41Z,"2rocco_sifredi:

nope, doesn't work. And if the internet connection if off then you can play no problem (provided you run the crack). If it is on then no go."

,rocco_sifredi,2010-01-31T00:52Z,"I checked...I cannot play if I close the internet connection.I know it's odd but it works ! If I close the connection...that screen with ""you cannot use DLC etc"" appears ! And it is also not lettting me run the crack. It has to be an explanation.
Who knows maybe those steps made different ...result in a different outcome."
,alfoznat,2010-01-31T06:20Z,"i installed all the dlcs but when i run the crack (after i copied it to the mass effect dictionary) it just shows a loading courser and lagges my computer it did for about 3 hours before i restarted it because it wasn't doing anything.

Real pirates support the developers who provide them with quality software by buying a legit copy if they like it. This new generation of pirates who don't give a fuck about anything are the ones who're making developers turn their backs on PC Gaming and go over to the console. More and more developers are making their titles console exclusive. We were LUCKY they even ported this over to PC. Take a look around, all of the PC exclusives are GONE because they jumped ship. Now everything for PC is a port from gay fucking consoles, and most of the time they run like shit because they do a half-ass job.

Thanks a lot assholes. So much for a Crysis sequel. Cheap fuckin' scumbags can't even pull $50 out of their ass for a kickass game once in a while."

,kablitz,2010-02-26T13:30Z,"guys need some help.

i installed all the DLC's fine. but the crack doesn't work, it crashes immediately when i run it. the console for giveme2entitlements say:

Looking for DLC (and computing MAGIC HASHES)...
+Zaeed (DLC_HEN_VT)

i've put the crack in the root directory of ME2m turned off the 2 options in ME2 about connecting online, unchecked ME2 in firewall exceptions and i've even tried disconnecting my internet but no go..xD"
,kebabonline5233,2010-03-04T22:17Z,"Everyone having problems with the ""crack"" in the ME2 directory READ THIS:

Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5

DL IT, INSTALL IT, REBOOT PC, Put the crack in the ""C:\Program\Mass Effect 2"" Folder.
Play ze game.

MAD PROPS TO ""232323"" Thank you! And thank you for uploading this."
,kebabonline5233,2010-03-04T22:23Z,"Yo, another thing. Anyone found out a fix for DLC menu? It's kinda buggy and laggy :s

(Have ME2 with patch 1.01 and DLC's."
,kebabonline5233,2010-03-04T22:28Z,Nvm found a solution on google :> ftw! Anyway if you're having that problems just go ALT+DEL+CTRL go to Processors. Right click Mass Effect 2 while its running. and choose REALTIME for highest priority. GL HF TY :>
,Dog909,2010-03-12T14:27Z,"I have personally found that to get the DLC to stay authorised, I HAVE to fire up ME2 with my net connection enabled every time (though blocked by my firewall). I can then alt-tab to desktop & disable my net connection. The game plays perfectly from then on with all DLC included. If I start ME2 without my net turned on I ALWAYS get the DLC error message. This is the ONLY method that works for me with the DLC. Hope this helps those who are struggling (as I was!)"
,kenny782,2010-03-16T19:29Z,I've been playing for a month now out of nowhere this morning I get unable to authorize DLC's. I know some people run into this but just starting for no reason? Thanks.
,druid513,2010-03-21T08:25Z,it worked then it didnt work. then it works again after I installed Microsoft framework 3.5 which is about 2mb - 50 mb size.   
,kit5une,2010-03-22T20:50Z,is there ANY way to get the DLC working without an internet connection?
,Dog909,2010-04-05T20:39Z,"@ Ploppy10 - I worked out the fix a while ago but only just noticed your reply, sry -

1.If you are recieving the error about authorizing installed DLC (a common problem) try these steps:-
a.Remove both Mass Effect 2 entries from your windows firewall exceptions list, simply untick them both.

b.Install each DLC file. Windows 7 may say they didn't install properly - just tell it that they did.

c.Reload your 1.01 crack patch (fixed .exe) - as mentioned above the new DLC installs patch 1.01 WITHOUT ASKING, so re-crack your game afterwards.

d.Enable your internet connection, then run the 'giveme2entitlements.exe' or any other DLC crack. If it asks you to replace the .ini file, select Yes. (If your net connection is not active you will recieve an error from the DLC crack).

e.With your Internet connection still enabled, run the game. (DO NOT have any firewall apps running either for this step) On the main menu, you should now see the menu options load without any 'Unable to authorized DLC' message :)

f.Now ALT-TAB back to your desktop & disable your internet connection. Go back into the game (click the icon in the taskbar) & click on 'Exit Game'. 

g.From now on you can now run the game without the net connection & your DLC will stay authorized :)

h.If you add more DLC in the future & you get the 'Unauthorized error' again, simply repeat the above steps to re-enable it.

The key is not having a firewall running when authorizing for the 1st time :)"

,sf2000,2010-04-14T12:25Z,Don't forget to run the crack AS ADMIN or it may not overwrite the neccessary files. That's why it did not work for me in the first place.

,Napwnleon,2010-10-03T23:38Z,"Works great. 

FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO IS HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE CRACK (keeps crashing), download .NET Framework 3.5. The crack wouldn't work for me at first, but when I downloaded the framework, everything worked fine. "

,rgomez55,2011-01-17T21:53Z,ok got crack to work but it still gives me an error. Is there a way to run the crack without the internet? My game in installed on my offline computer that has no nic or wireless capabilities so there is no way to connect it to the web and after running the crack I am told it cant find my adapter so is there a way around this to make it work?
,Simnos,2011-01-31T05:00Z,"Thanks for the upload. Works great.

Just a couple of notes: the crack has to be put into the binaries folder to work. Also, I wasn't able to get my DLC to work. it said it wasn't authorised. I read someone elses suggestion that you merely need to tuen off your auto-login to the EA servors but this didn't help."
,ismellfunny67,2011-03-03T04:11Z,"Works perfectly. Had some trouble at first so I'll post some steps.

1. Start Mass Effect 2 and enter extras/options/online. Switch off both of the available options.
2. Run all of the DLCs straight from the download folder.
3. Copy the crack to the binaries folder in your install location and run the app.
4. Start up the game and activate the new content from the start menu.
5. Enjoy!"
