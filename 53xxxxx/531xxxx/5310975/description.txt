PrisM's NOTES
well, i am now back had a weeks vacation in Egypt, well i know little late on this as theirs about 20 other versions out their, but their is not 1 700mb re encode that i can see their all 1.4gb firstly increased colors alot as source is very dull, then added slight sharpness and contrast overall its not the best r5 their has been but far from the worst
