Release Notes:

Daredevil Records / Jochen BÃ¶llath
My band was on tour with HELL N DIESEL 3 years ago
and it was a great time! And Iâ€™m really impressed
about their debut record! They are on the way to
the top! First big point is the vocals from EK
EVIL, who has such power and melody in his voice
and will give the band a bright audience! On the
other side the band wrote big songs that are not
weak, cheesy or something like that. The songs are
hits! No filler on that record, which got a mighty
production at the Panic Room in Sweden! The opener
SWEET SISTER (which is an single output too!) is a
great rocker! Highlight is YOU SHOOK ME, a track
who could be from an old Motley Crue record! Great
melodies, great power! After that 2 fast burner,
CROSSES (KIXXX) is more a mid-tempo track and very
close to bands like Guns N Roses for example.
Especially the high screams from EK Evil kicks ass!
SEXUAL SUICIDE is another highlight on that record!
What a song! The following FALLIN` is a ballad with
a great guitar solo and the whole song reminds me
again on some G`n`R stuff. This track will crack
the radio stations in the states! Believe me! MISS
COCAINE shows more the heavy side of the band and
was led by an mighty kick ass riff and the unique
vocals again! The fast ATTITUDE rocks before one
weaker track follows. S.O.Y.L. is good, but canâ€™t
hold the high standard of that record. RIDE AWAY is
a burner with a forward punching drumming and SWEAT
IT close that great record! If you like kick ass
Rock from Sweden or Sleaze Rock from the states â€“
this is your new masterpiece! The single features
the opener SWEET SISTER and the unreleased track
FREAK CITY BLUES, a 2 minute Blues song with some
influences from Mississippi. This song would fit on
the CD too!
