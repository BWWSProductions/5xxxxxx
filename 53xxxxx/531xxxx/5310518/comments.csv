[T],brodahisou,2010-01-27T15:24Z,"@ rendaw1, Dark Tower: The Battle of Jericho Hill #2 has yet to be scanned and Dark Tower: The Battle of Jericho Hill #3 was released today.

Remember, patience is a virtue."
,rendaw1,2010-01-31T15:57Z,"I hope that they stay out, because it is what came out a month Battle of Jericho Hill vol. 2 and yet nowhere. We're on the Dark Tower just those on the comics, so I wish good luck and please all parts of the Battle of Jericho Hill."
,steve_swv,2010-02-05T07:08Z,Ship!  Where's this weeks 0-day?  What they say is true you don't really know how much you'll miss something till it's gone.  HAH anyways if you ever need help on the collection or someone to take over while you vacation (God forbid) seriously message me I'd love to help if needed and fill the void steve_swv@hotmail.com
