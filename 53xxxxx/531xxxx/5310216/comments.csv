I think your software is great and I am using it on an old laptop with no hard drive. The only thing I can't do is to connect to my home network to share an Internet connection. When I use a SLAX build I created myself I can get as far as recognizing my device (Netgear WG111 wireless adapter) but cannot online. I am afraid I must use a Windows environment which is what all my other PCs use (Windows XPSP2). Any guidance on how to get HawkPE-43 to recognize my device? I do know how to bust the .iso and add to it using MagicISO. Thanks. bozesimp@htc.net"
