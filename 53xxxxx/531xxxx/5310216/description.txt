A fully-functional WinPE (Windows Pre-Installation Env, based on
Windows XP SP2) + Linux (Slax-6.0.7) live CD/DVD ISO.  Comes w/
MalwareByets Anti-Malware + McAfee AV,updated as of 25-Jan-10, Windows
Explorer, SmartDriverBackup, PCITREE, CPUZ, FoxIt PDF Reader, Firefox,
FileZilla FTP Client, Ghost 11, UltraVNC, Partition Magic 8, CHNTPW
(now Vista-compatible), WIPECMOS, MEMTEST, the Hitachi/Seagate/WD
hard drive diagnostics, etc.  Boots to WinPE by default.

What is WinPE ?  It's a limited version of Windows XP, bootable from
your own media, so that you can prepare a naked PC for installation of
an operating system or rescue a damaged system when it won't boot
properly.  WinPE, therefore, looks and behaves like the OS you know
best and gives you an opportunity to fix things as opposed to simply
wiping the hard drive and redoing the PC from scratch.

Starting with HawkPE #41, there are two separate downloads: a CD ISO
(without Slax and other goodies) and a DVD ISO (the full treatment.)
The split has permitted the addition of a few more diagnostics/tools
to the CD image, while eliminating the Linux payload for those who
simply never did/will grok/want Linux.

For those who've been asking, there's now a procedure to transfer
HAWKPE to a USB thumb drive and make it bootable, along w/ other
tidbits in the HAWKPE-CHANGES, README-HAWKPE, and HAWKPE-USB-HOWTO
text files !

Slax is an excellent example of a portable Linux, which comes w/
Firefox-2+Flash-9, KDE's KOffice suite, multimedia goodies, and the
latest K3B CD/DVD burning application.  So with a USB thumb drive and
your HAWKPE CD/DVD, you can carry a multimedia-enabled computer
system, with you at all times.  Slax also makes for a more informative
diagnostic than the stand-alones like Microscope and PC Doctor.
Enjoy....

PS: Download all components in order to extract the payload.  It has
been compressed using 7-Zip, a very good, free data compression
utility.  Download 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/, ** BEFORE ** 
downloading the HawkPE payload.

AND BE SURE TO READ ALL OF THE TEXT FILES ** AND ** BEFORE ASKING
QUESTIONS !!!

If you're uncertain that the compressed ISO(s) have been transferred
correctly, their MD5 signatures are shown below:

c04eed5a04f5968f5d92900f8e208f99 *HAWKPE-43-DVD.7z

You can download a free MD5 signature checker, HashCheck Shell
Extension from http://code.kliu.org/hashcheck/, or MD5 Summer, or
anything else that you can find.


PPS:  Better than UBCD, better than Hiren's CD.  This is a true Swiss
Army knife for repairing and setting up PCs.

There's another payload you should see:

From HAWKPE-CHANGES.TXT:


25-Jan-10  -  Changes to HAWKPE-43 from HAWKPE-42:

**  Updated BartPE/WinPE w/ the latest McAfee defs, Firefox Portable to
3.57, FileZilla Portable to 3.3.1, SYSLINUX to 3.84, and CPUZ to 1.52

**  Per user feedback (via Demonoid), fixed main menu issues w/ correct
versions of Memtest86 and MemtestPlus

**  Removed AdAware Pro (end of support by Lavasoft), ClamWin (more on
this below), Magical Jellybean Keyfinder (replaced w/ something
better), Portable CCleaner (never worked well), Portable DriverGenius
(never worked well either)

**  Added Joshua's Key Reader (to recover Windows XP product keys from
dead systems), MalwareBytes Anti-Malware (more on this below), NT Pswd
Edit (an alternative to NTCHPW which many find too cryptic), SpinRite
6, and SYSLINUX' new Hardware Detection Module, the DriverPacks.net
stand-alone driver installer for Windows XP/2003 (much more on this
below)

**  Reorganized the CD/DVD boot menu to move the hard drive-related
utilities to a sub-menu

**  Reorganized README-HAWKPE, to split out the Mini-HOWTOs at the end
of the file, in the "hope" that people will read them instead of
asking the SAME OLD questions again and again

********************************  Notes  ********************************

Made the ramdrive larger by 32MB (to 64MB), to accomodate ClamWin
which (per user reports) stopped working w/ #42.  **THEN** after
playing w/ the various 43-RCs (release candidates), it was decided to
deep-six ClamWin altogether !  Regretably, Lavasoft stopped updating
AdAware Pro 6 (really good program) and since I never really thought
ClamWin did that good of a job *and* was slow to scan, let's just rip
them both out and make room for something/anything else.  (For the
record, I **still** include the McAfee scanner bec it **works**, not
as effectively as other AV scanners, but then the alternatives don't
operate under WinPE/HawkPE **at all**.)  I don't use HawkPE/WinPE
*often* (note the word *often*) for actual virus/malware cleaning and
favor a much more reliable cleaning method: delete a corrupt Windows
and replace it w/ a fresh copy of the operating system.  However, when
customers insist on retaining the OS *and* their installed
apps/drivers, there's MalwareBytes Anti-Malware [MBAM] !

This iteration of MBAM isn't as stable as I'd like, but I've used it
successfully for many months (since I discovered the UBCD4WIN project
had a working BartPE plugin), so here it is.  The biggest caveats are:

**  the loader that launches MBAM will only do so *ONCE* per run of
HawkPE/WinPE; so if MBAM crashes or simply doesn't load, one must
reboot HawkPE/WinPE  <sigh>

**  after scanning for malware w/ MBAM, the dialog that saves the log
file "works", but the combox for choosing the destination folder for
the file doesn't work right away *and* you have to keep pressing the
Save button repeatedly to make it do so  <sigh>

**  since MBAM doesn't know jack about WinPE, it will try to restart
itself on the next launch of Windows itself (to delete certain files);
nothing to be concerned about here, just a simple heads-up

**  one must explicitly select only what you want to scan for (the
bottom three check boxes: files, registry entries, and
extra/heuristics objects) on the Settings tab

According to the MBAM forum, the program's authors have decided to do
an official BartPE plugin, but there's no date for that and the
aforementioned announcement was issued in April '09, so don't hold
your breath waiting for the plugin.  Fact is, malware cleaning is/will
always be a hit-miss proposition.  The most agressive intruders are
very ingenious in finding multiple reinfection vectors (startup
points) and strategies, so after spending *hours* performing a deep
scan w/ a couple different tools, you may still be SOL (simply out of
luck.)  Moreover, some intruders damage the TCP/IP stack or Internet
Explorer, so even if do purge them, the PC *may* no longer connect to
the outside world, requiring a reinstall anyway.  When you use MBAM,
give it time to load, bec it does take some time (up to a minute) on
slower PCs.

Anyway, I will continue to keep my eye open for anything else which
might help defeat the malware threat.  Spybot comes to mind, but I
need to free up a lot more space before it will "join the family."
Prior to adding MBAM, HawkPE/WinPE already *had* a2-hijack and
SysInternals Autoruns, so I want to remind that I haven't completely
abandoned the idea of malware detection/cleaning.

Briefly, about the other additions:

**  Firefox and FileZilla are based on the latest versions from the
PortableApps suite.  They got a special treatment for HawkPE, where
they are wrapped in a SFX which will automagically launch them from
COMMON on the RAM drive (R:).  However (*AND* this is *IMPORTANT*),
they can't be used SIMULATANEOULY, since they share the same folder
and each launcher will delete the current contents of R:COMMON,
before extracting its own payload.  This is intended to cut down on
overall failures in HawkPE, due to exhausting all TEMP space on the
RAM drive

**  Joshua's Key Reader is central to why *I* started using BartPE to
create HawkPE/WinPE, ie. to be able to retrieve information from a
dead or hopelessly damaged Windows, like a product key 

**  NT Pswd Edit, just like Joshua's Key Reader, is one of those tools
permits to *fix* a broken Windows installation (I routinely encounter
customers at my day job, who need help removing an account password),
instead of **reformatting**

**  There are times when I need to get a quick overview of the
hardware in a PC and for this purpose I've added HDT (Hardware
Detection Tool) from the SYSLINUX suite

**  The DriverPacks.net stand-alone driver installer for Windows
XP/2003 (only).  In case you need a ready-made source of drivers, to
complete an installation of Windows XP/2003, look no further.
However, it must be understood that this installer is **ONLY** to be
used from within a real, operational instance of Windows, **not**
HawkPE/WinPE; just navigate to the DPSADriverPacks.net folder on the
DVD, then run the DP_Install_Tool.cmd batch script.  The script will
attempt to install device support from a tested library of hundreds of
mfr's device drivers in the audio, chipset, CPU, graphics, LAN, mass
storage, and WLAN categories, for any unknown devices.  Have even
kicked in the UAA service pack (KB888111) for both XP/2003, in case
you have one of those new-fangled HD audio adapters, which will
**only** install *after* the UAA upgrade.  Do I have to say it, but
the DriverPacks stand-alone installer is **ONLY* on the DVD edition of
HawkPE !

It's regretable that it's been an entire year since the last release
and as always, I hope the next iteration won't take as long to
release.  I'm hopeful that we can keep a two-month schedule between
releases this year.  Enjoy....
