The music contained in this torrent is not for the faint of heart. The arrangement was specifically designed to cause feelings of fear and discomfort in the listener. To best "enjoy" this, one should listen alone, in as close to complete darkness as possible. It is also /strongly/ recommended to not open the "Read After Listening" text file until you have heard the arrangement in its entirety, as it contains the titles of all included songs. To know this information beforehand could possibly ruin the surprise that plays such a large role in frightening the listener.
