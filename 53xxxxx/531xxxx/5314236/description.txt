The smalls formed in 1990 while all 4 members were attending Grant MacEwan College in Edmonton. the smallsâ€™ new CD, My Dear Little Angle, distributed by Outside Music, was released in April, 1999 and has sold 5,000 copies to date. The album recently appeared on Chart Magazineâ€™s Top 100 Albums of 1999 at #68. My Dear Little Angle has seen the bandâ€™s songwriting style grow, while maintaining the arrangement that continues to develop and has become their trademark. Produced by Glenn Robinson (Tori Amos, Tea Party) and mastered by New York guru Howie Weinberg at the legendary Masterdisk, the record sounds amazing â€“ huge and aggressive, yet dynamic and subtle. Also Available: Waste and Tragedy (1995), produced by Joel Van Dyke (Wide Mouth Mason, Colin James) To Each A Zone (1992), produced by Cecil English (NoMeansNo, DOA) the smalls (1990/93), produced by Cecil English and the smalls.
