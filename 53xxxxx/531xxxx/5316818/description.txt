Product Description
Little Snitch ... A firewall protects your computer against 
unwanted guests from the Internet. But who protects 
your private data from being sent out? Little Snitch does! 
As soon as you're connected to the Internet, applications 
can potentially send whatever information they want to 
wherever they want.
Sometimes they do this for good reason, on your explicit 
request. But often they don't. Little Snitch allows you to 
intercept these unwanted connection attempts, and lets 
you decide how to proceed.
Little Snitch informs you whenever a program attempts to 
establish an outgoing Internet connection. You can then 
choose to allow or deny this connection, or define a rule 
how to handle similar, future connection attempts. This 
reliably prevents private data from being sent out without 
your knowledge. Little Snitch runs inconspicuously in the 
background and it can also detect network related 
activity of viruses, trojans and other malware.
