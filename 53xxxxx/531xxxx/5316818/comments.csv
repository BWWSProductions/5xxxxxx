,Wai2go,2010-07-13T09:50Z,"Ok Jedidad, I\'ll fill you in as far as I know for now... Aside from the rumors that one of them french kissed the others girlfriend in high school, it appears these two keyboard wizzes, Iso_Soul and XploytlT, have some disagreement over the authenticity of the others piracy. They now have apparently set up additional TPB accounts to further the cloak and dagger slanderous innuendous to and fro. They has been some talk of an \'Upload off\' to settle the score once and for all but nothing concrete has yet been established."
