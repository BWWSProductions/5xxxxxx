That awful Motown song was originally done by The Marvelettes.   Not sure why you would pick that one.  The Beatles covers from their early years are far from their best material.

From the later years though Golden Slumbers is kind of weak.  Other than those two, several good picks!"

Also, in regards to Golden Slumbers, how else would that sequence from Abbey Road be done without it? Either way, thanks for torrenting!"
