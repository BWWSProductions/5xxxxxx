The Beatles - Forty-Five Minute Break


This sampling of Beatles songs (note I'm not calling it a "best of". Picking only 17 of the Beatles' "best" would be impossible) was made for a friend who is wanting to get into the Beatles. It is not for you, so don't whine about whatever you find wrong with it, especially if you think "oh, (insert song here) is missing, how could you exclude that!" Anyway, enjoy!
