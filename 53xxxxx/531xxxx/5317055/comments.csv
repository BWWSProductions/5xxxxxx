and Accurate NOT Speed.... "
[V],bubanee,2010-01-31T14:48Z,"yes and no... with this setting it makes sure it gets every possible information to MP3 and if there is one fault in say the correction error or bad sector it will repeat over and over till it gets it... or it's a disc with scratches.. some rips won't work at all then some won't be a problem.. this is why i swap between the 2 programs EAC and Dbpoweramp which might be easier to use and is the 1st recomended program for MP3 and it's a lot easier to manage as well.. EAC is more for 2 pass -Flac- 100% recordings.. or you can try speed mode but you'll have to listen to each track for skips... it's trial and error i'm afraid.. but you will figure something out that suits you best.. :)
Dbpoweramp is here on TPB just write dbpoweramp>search>go to the latest and read the comments first always before downloading"
