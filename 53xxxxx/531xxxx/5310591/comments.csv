,lainy1054,2010-02-16T22:39Z,"ok at 83% managed to watch a couple of them, I have to say it is worth waiting for even though they are a bit glitchy now and then, but other then that they are good quality, apart from diamonds are forever witch is really quite a good copy of the men who stare at goats wtf lol, I will be seeding as long as I can, thanks for a good dl"

,Mangachaos,2010-06-24T21:23Z,"It´s true what they say, there aren´t many uploading enough...(most the times the bastards has auto-shutdown once they are finished), but getting at least half of the size of the movie might at least help I guess. And if it takes too long, you need :

1. A better CONNECTION!

2. Try not to change the pace.. everyone is helping! (Or are they? Sometimes I see those tiny tiny speed... you might as well just jump off if that happens. 0.1kb/s... give it a rest!)

3. Downloading a little at a time could also benefit you and others. Why download everything when you can (or HAVE to) take it in babysteps?

4. Don´t,  I repeat - DON`T nag about people seeding! You do know it´s also YOU who slows things down right? It doesn´t go any faster if alot are seeding anyways since the whole thing need balance... more clieants and sources = great speed. Didn´t you knew that?

Hrm... so now to a pretty good comment then... well, I always wanted to see the Bond movies and well, haven´t had the time to look for them. So this´ll be some great action once it´s finished!  I´ll be seeding oh say... 15 gb or so... too bad not many does... sometiems it actually seem I´m THE fastest. And that´s a shame... that peolpe doesn´t know a good connection. Go at least for 8 mbit/s... "
,Mangachaos,2010-06-24T21:24Z,clients* I slipped... (damn...)
,Mangachaos,2010-06-24T21:27Z,Third comment--- (Schorry..>_
,Mangachaos,2010-06-24T21:29Z,"(What´s with this comment box? Darn thing stopped my third comment so it wouldn´t make much sense!)

I meant I messed up and made alot of typos. They always follow you around those typos. Sorry again."
