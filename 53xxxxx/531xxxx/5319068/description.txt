This repack includes original Commandos, Behind Enemy Lines CD image in MDS format

(CBELDISC2.rar, retaining copy protection), and another image (CBELDISC1.rar) 

containing installation files with updated .exe (remembers video resolution upon

exiting unlike 1.0 version), 

launcher and FPS-limiter (for use on machines that run the game too fast).

To play the game, you don't have to necessarily download original image, but then

you won't have in-game videos working. (When asked for CD, just press ESC.)

I've programmed launcher and repacked installation including registry tweaks so you

don't have to tweak registry to be able to save/load. I do not take credit for

FPS-limiter. 

And yes, it works on every Windows, granted you got updated Windows Installer.

Enjoy and seed!

Note: If you're having difficulties starting this game up (crashing on startup) 

try replacing COMANDOS.exe in installed folder with original 1.0 version from 

original cd (bigger image in mds format; cd/COMANDOS/comandos.exe; 2.469.376 

bytes); 1.1 version is 2.469.888 bytes (make sure you check under 'size' and 

not 'size on disk' under file properties).
