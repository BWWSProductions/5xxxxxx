,tpsnoopbot,2010-02-23T10:29Z,"guys i really need help im desperate, i download this game, then i extract both disk 1 & 2 then i mount both disk 1 and 2.., great the game started then after the video the game crash and a message saying ERROR- dont send - send- help me plz i wanna play this game... help!!!"
,Soda-88,2010-02-25T20:07Z,"tpsnoopbot, did you mount original image on the same device from which you installed the game?"
,tpsnoopbot,2010-02-26T17:01Z,"soda-88, want original image u mean? hehehe... im kinda dumb at this... just mount the cd and only the cd... =)"
,Soda-88,2010-02-26T23:24Z,"original image is the bigger one in mds format, retaining the cd copy protection

you are supposed to install the game from the smaller one (.iso), then mount the bigger one (.mds) on same drive to play"
,Hannibal0303,2010-03-07T11:18Z,"I'm having the same problem as tpsnoopbot.
I run it in windows xp. Tried it in compatibility mode for win 95 and win 98. As soon as I hit Esc or after the intro movie it crashes and I get the send/don't send message."
,Soda-88,2010-03-07T18:31Z,"Hannibal0303, you're not supposed to run it in compatibility mode

i'm not sure if this will help, but since both of you get crashes when the intro video is supposed to play, try downloading GSpot (http://www.headbands.com/gspot/) and see if you got codecs used by commandos videos installed properly (cd\COMANDOS\VIDEO); just drag and drop 1 of the videos in gspot http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/752/77362297.jpg"
,Soda-88,2010-03-07T18:37Z,"also, another solution i came up with is to replace COMANDOS.exe in installed folder with original 1.0 version from original cd (bigger image in mds format; cd\COMANDOS\comandos.exe; 2.469.376 bytes); 1.1 version is 2.469.888 bytes (make sure you check under 'size' and not 'size on disk' under file properties)"
,umarnawazkhan,2010-03-21T02:19Z,"is this working? i got windows 7 64 bit...
i can see people have problems..has any1 sorted it out yet?

i tryed Commandos - Behind Enemy Lines (direct play) but was running to fast..and i couldn't save or load the game..."
,pewpew7,2010-03-28T23:35Z,"That's a great upload, I love that it finally remembers the resolution. 
Is there anyway to play it without mounting the image though? I tried copying the videos but it didn't work. When I launch the game without mounting the image I get a black screen and I have to ctrl-alt-del (with both versions of the .exe). 
Thanks!"
,pewpew7,2010-04-02T10:37Z,"ok, found a way to play without mounting any image, and with the in-game videos. it was simple:
-unzip and mount CBELDISC1.iso, install game
-on winxp, go to start->run, and type ""regedit""
-go to ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> SOFTWARE -> Pyro -> Commandos -> 1.0""
-right click ""modify"" on the ""DirIns"" key. Dont modify it, just copy the full line.
-right click ""modify"" on the ""DirCd"" key, delete the current line, and paste the full line from ""DirIns""
-Close registry editor and start the game without mounting a cd :)

If you want the videos, unzip and mound CBELDISC2.iso. Copy the full ""VIDEO"" folder to your main ""Commandos, Behind Enemy Lines"" folder.

The same method works for Commandos beyond the call of duty by the same uploader. The folder for the reg key is ""1.0MP"""
,eran84,2010-05-04T09:57Z,"I'm using Windows 7, and when I use the MDS file, I can hear the videos but can't see anything so I'm forced the shut the software down through task manager. 
If I use the ISO, I can't see the videos or play the tutorials. 
I tried all the tips mentioned here... 
Any advice? "
,motley666,2010-06-12T13:43Z,"Thanks for your efforts, it works fine on xp."
,Su_BlackWolf,2010-06-23T18:37Z,"I`m having the same trouble that eran84.
Can hera the sound but can`t see the videos...
already tried everything...someone know how to fix this?"
,thangdut,2010-12-29T11:20Z,i had the same problem as tpsnoopbot. The game crashed right after the intro video of stage 1. i found a solution: just skip the 1st stage. type the password for the 2nd stage (4JJXB). hope this helps.
,shyam0507,2012-02-23T16:51Z,uncheck the windowed option in the game launcher
