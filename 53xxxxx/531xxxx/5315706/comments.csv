,baybreeze,2010-07-14T22:58Z,"Thanks for posting I never heard of this show before,it was fun to watch straight thru in 3 days. Season one eps. 6 and 7 are the same episode and the preview cuts off but its still worth the download. And season 2 is complete. Thanks!"

,creml1n,2011-11-02T05:16Z,"These 2 files wouldn't play properly for me:

Episode 04- 'Pin Thin' and Pissed Off (no audio or video)
Episode 05- Meltdown (no audio, some patchy video frames)

also, vlc reported ""This AVI file is broken. Seeking will not work correctly on this file:

Episode 08- Fashion Overload

but it does play (but not seek past 27m).

Anyone else notice this? Any fixed versions of these files available?"
,creml1n,2011-11-05T02:06Z,"I somehow corrupted those 2 files during the download; downloaded again and now these 2 work fine:

Episode 04- 'Pin Thin' and Pissed Off
Episode 05- Meltdown

So - good torrent."
