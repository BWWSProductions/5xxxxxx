Much has been said about Vitalic doing the mutant electro thing before seemingly every Western European teenager had Ableton spewing chunks, but honestly, his songs are so engrossing that context just seems futile. New LP Flashmob has a great single in the sleaze-disco of "Poison Lips," which has been rubbed into this narcotic synth odyssey by Belgium's Captain Flash. Lots of endorphin showers to be had here.
