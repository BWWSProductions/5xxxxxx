    Through the winning and losing of an American empire       
    and the impact of the Scottish Enlightenment, Neil        
    Oliver reveals how in the second half of the 18th        
    century Scotland was transformed from a poor northern     
    backwater with a serious image problem into one of the     
    richest nations on Earth. This was the dawn of the        
    modern age when Scotland made its mark on the world by   
    exporting its most valuable commodities - its people      
    and ideas.
