Many thanks to the uploader SceneRlz !!! 

Just installed this download and activated it and it works fine. No issues. I did NOT test the Blu-Ray issue described below because I don't have, nor do I ever intend to buy, a Blu-Ray burner. 

I installed the download into a Win-XP Virtual Window to make sure it was legit and that it worked as advertised. It is basically the same method of installation as all Adobe products posted on Pirate Bay in the past few years. Some of the field terminology in the Keygen program is different than what is displayed in the activation window. But if you can't figure it out within 10 seconds then you most likely don't possess the intellectual capital to use VideoStudio so give up now before you hurt yourself or your head explodes !!!!

A few helpful notes:

1. You will need an internet connection to install the setup.exe program. If you are not online the install will fail because it downloads .NET binaries (as needed) from Microsoft. Please note that I said DURING the install of Setup.exe, not during the activation sequence, so as soon as you install it reboot and disconnect your internet to activate.

2. You will need at least a 1024x768 screen resolution or VideoStudio will NOT initialize after the install. 

3. Be certain to disconnect your internet after installing and rebooting and before activating BY PHONE.

4. When using the Keygen, the second field requiring the 5 blocks of characters generated from within the VideoStudio Activation Window required manual typing into the Keygen program. It is NOT case sensitive and I also typed the DASH (Hyphen) between each group of characters. Cut and Past did not work, although it may have been a virtual machine issue.

5. There was something else I wanted to add but it has vanished from memory. the tramadols just started to kick in !!!! Sorry.... 

In any event this is an easy install and activate. And it works without issues. There are many reasons it is highly rated above.

Once again, many thanks to the uploader SceneRlz !!!!

Not sure what the problem is but am also not happy about all the startup services that were installed in the process."

,BlowBye,2010-02-06T10:18Z,"OK, all settled and works fine.

Not sure what happened. Did not want to give up on this so I ran setup again. This resulted in a complete deinstall of the software with the bonus that VS X2 ran fine again.

Ran setup again and this time it worked just fine, the activation code is stored in the registry so I did not have to run through that process again.

Also, the services that autostarted before do not show up now. Again, not sure why, but all's well that ends well.

Thumbs up."
,ldola,2010-02-06T23:07Z,"The Pro X3 version is just crap. It starts already during the installation to do what many programs are doing these days: to search the hard drive for media and other crap, and it keeps it on at least 15 minutes. They have taken away a lot of smaller format to save for, and even deleted Moviemaker part, and so on. and added even more of this DVD crap saving options that no one use. Do not download, use the X2 12,5 version instead."
,BlowBye,2010-02-07T11:55Z,"After having tested both X2 and X3 I agree completely with Idola.

There's a lot of crapola with X3, from time consuming and slow on-line help only to a massive .Net-installation on the hard drive.

X2 takes some 260 Mb on the harddrive compared to 1 Gb for X3. Also, one of the reasons I went for X3 was the ""$500 worth of templates"" supposedly included for the VideoStudio Express. No go on that one.

Nice from a torrent perspective but for the software, forget this one and go for X2 instead."

""glabos"" posted great instructions on Page 1, but I'm gonna borrow what he wrote, and add more to it starting at #5.)

1. You will need an internet connection to install the setup.exe program. If you are not online the install will fail because it downloads 

.NET binaries (as needed) from Microsoft. Please note that I said DURING the install of Setup.exe, not during the activation sequence, 

so as soon as you install it reboot and disconnect your internet to activate.

2. You will need at least a 1024x768 screen resolution or VideoStudio will NOT initialize after the install.

3. Be certain to disconnect your internet after installing and rebooting and before activating BY PHONE.

4. When using the Keygen, the second field requiring the 5 blocks of characters generated from within the VideoStudio Activation 

Window required manual typing into the Keygen program. It is NOT case sensitive and I also typed the DASH (Hyphen) between each 

group of characters. Cut and Past did not work, although it may have been a virtual machine issue. 

5. Two things must load with the computer at first, or you get this error message:: "" Error 38: Corel Videostudio files have been 

damaged or modified, please reinstall the original source"". IF you see this, then these two are not loaded.  

A) ""Standby"" (Documents and Settings\NAME\Application Data\Corel\Messages\540225279_410012\EN) MUST load up with the 

computer. I'm not been able to disable it, and the program work. 

B) Protexis License Service. (""Program Files\Common Files\Protexis\License Service"")

6. After installing, Open program and go into ""Easy Edit"". Click on the arrow (Help & Product Information). Now, click on the Blue 

sprocket tool near Messages. Choose ""Message Preferences"", and UNCHECK the TWO boxes that pop-up. 

******************************************************************************

7. Removing the Protexis Licensing (works with X3 as it did with X2) 

1) Go to Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services and stop ProtexisLicensing v2
(or just press Start-> Run -> services.msc and press Enter)
Stop the service and put on Disable.

2) Now go to:
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Protexis\License Service
you will find 2 files:

3) PSIService_2.exe (delete this one)
b) PSIKey_2.dll rename to PsiClient.dll, then copy this new rename file PsiClient.dll and paste in C:\Program Files\Corel\Corel Paint 

Shop Pro Photo X2, and replace the existing file.

4) Next go to Start-> Run -> and type: 
sc delete PSI_SVC_2

Now ProtexisLicensing will be removed from services list.

5) Go to:
C:\Program Files\Common Files\
and delete the folder ""Protexis""
(and its subdirectory \Protexis\License Service\ obviously) 

note:: The ""Standby"" still loads with the computer, but the Protexix License will be gone.
