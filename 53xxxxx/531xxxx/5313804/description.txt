Do you know the top seven things men do that drive women nuts? Or the real reason women cry more than men do? What are men really looking for in a womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âboth at first sight and for the long-term? These are only the starting points for Barbara and Allan Pease as they discuss the very realÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âand often very funnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âdifferences between the sexes.
Why Men DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Have a Clue and Women Always Need More Shoes takes a look at some of the issues that have confused men and women for centuries. Using new findings on the brain, studies of social changes, evolutionary biology, and psychology, the Peases teach you how to make the most of your relationshipsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âor at least begin to understand where your partner is coming from.
They help women understand why men avoid commitment, what drives them to lie, and how to decode male speech to find out what they are really saying. They explain to men why women nag, how they use emotional blackmail, and how to understand (and take advantage of!)  the top-secret scoring system all women apply.  They also dish about the top turn-ons--and turn-offs--for both sexes. Laced with their trademark humor, Why Men DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Have a Clue and Women Always Need More Shoes addresses a host of nitty-gritty battlegrounds as well, from channel surfing and toilet seats to shopping and communication.
Already a #1 bestseller in the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Holland, Spain, Brazil, Portugal, Belgium, Ireland, France, Czech Republic, India, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia, Why Men DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Have a Clue and Women Always Need More Shoes is the answer to understanding the opposite sex.
