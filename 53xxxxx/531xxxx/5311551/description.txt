A planned protest turned ugly yesterday when liberty activists turned on each other at an event held on the steps of the Austin Police Department HQ regarding the APD and BATFEâ€™s decision to shut down the long running and legally-held Texas Gun Show on January16th and 17th.

Talk show host and filmmaker Alex Jones was invited yet refused to speak at yesterdayâ€™s protest, which was sponsored by Texans for Accountable Government, Truth Seekers, and the Ladies of Liberty Alliance. Instead, Jones co-opted the event by using his bullhorn to drown out the event's scheduled speakers.

In avideo chronicling the takeover of the event by Jones and the ensuing tumult, Catherine Bleish, Executive Director of the Liberty Restoration Project confronted Jones regarding his comment that they were â€œnew activists and they didnâ€™t know what they were doing,â€ to which Jones replied; â€œWell, I said that to you, yes.â€

An off-camera and unnamed activist then asked for the reason why Jones didn't work with the event's organizers, to which Jones replied, "Well, I'm sorry; I brought 80% of the people here." While much of the audio is unintelligible due to ambient sound, Bleish informs Jones â€œMany people worked really hard on this event,â€ to which Jones replied again, â€œYou donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing.â€ Jones also says during the exchange, â€œYouâ€™ve got a hard-on for meâ€ and â€œIâ€™ll be here in 20 years.â€
