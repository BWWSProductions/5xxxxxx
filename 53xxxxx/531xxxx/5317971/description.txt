HELIGOLAND is the much anticipated fifth studio album from legendary 

trip-hop duo MASSIVE ATTACK and the first new studio album since 

2003's critically-acclaimed 100TH WINDOW. HELIGOLAND features an 

all-star cast of guest vocals from DAMON ALBARN, HOPE SANDOVAL, 

MARTINA TOPLEY-BIRD, GUY GARVEY and TUNDE ADEBIMPE. Long time cohort 

HORACE ANDY makes a return alongside Massive Attack founding members 

ROBERT DEL NAJA (3D) and GRAND MARSHALL (DADDY G). Damon also plays 

bass on `Flat Of The Blade' and keyboards on `Splitting The Atom' 

while PORTISHEAD's ADRIAN UTLEY plays guitar on `Saturday Come Slow'. 

The band also collaborated with DFA's TIM GOLDSWORTHY on selected 

tracks. The cover artwork features an original image by ROBERT DEL 

NAJA. Over the last three years Robert Del Naja has written and 

produced soundtracks for a number of films and documentaries, 

including `Trouble In The Water', '44 Inch Chest', `In Prison My Whole 

Life' and `Gomorra', the latter for which he won the David Di 

Donatello Award for Best Song. Massive Attack also won the Outstanding 

Contribution to British Music Award at the Ivor Novello Awards.
