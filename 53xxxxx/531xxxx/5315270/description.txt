PLOT: Loosely adapted from Alan Clarkeâ€™s 1989 classic TV film, Nick Loveâ€™s film is set earlier in the 1980s in around 1984 and retells a similar story to the original â€“ but from a different characterâ€™s point of view. The film centres on Dom, a young wannabe football casual, who gets drawn in to the charismatic but dangerous world of the firmâ€™s top boy, Bex Bissell.
