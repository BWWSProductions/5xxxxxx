,psychokittie,2010-01-29T22:59Z,"I think enough people have made the point of this being a  mistake in labelling and that it's ep11 and not 12... 
I would suggest not using the RAR files anymore, for one, a lot of people don't like them because of the time it takes to unpack them, and two, it's easier for YOU, the uploader to check to make sure you have it labelled right.

Just suggestions...
Keep up the work though.... just make it better like it was BEFORE this little... mishap...

^_^"
,kudos2jen,2010-01-30T03:10Z,"i will admit, i wasn't happy to find out this was last weeks episode, but shit happens

@psychokittie...i have to disagree with you regarding the rar files.  it takes 30sec to unpack them.  if you can't wait those 30sec, something is wrong and it's not the torrent. ;)"
[T],teslaman,2010-01-30T05:23Z,"To be fair, the mislabel was the scenes fault (FQM), not TvTeams. ;) EZTV didn't even release the messed up one, they seem to know when propers are coming anymore. First time I've ever seen them mess an ep up that badly though, lol. So you wouldn't even think to check it, since it came from a trusted source."
,stjepanp1,2011-05-20T12:05Z,thanks
