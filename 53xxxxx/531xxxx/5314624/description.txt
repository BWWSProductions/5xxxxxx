have you ever played the Harry Potter soundtrack while you were reading the book?
you just thought that it would be nice if it was synchronised to your reading?

Now it is!

Here is the very first

HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE AUDIOEXPERIENCE

This is the complete first audiobook read by Jim Dale,
Only now it is enhanced with the soundtrack.

I have tried to match the soundtrack to the right chapters.
For example, at quidditch, you will here the quidditch soundtrack.

Also I tried to spice up some of the intense moments with intense music from the movie.


I got some reactions after the preview that the panning was not cool, so i removed it.

I personally think panning gives a better experience, so i will get working on it right away.
-UPDATE- the panning was not added to this experience, If you want complete panning, Download the Chamber of Secrets!

I would like to know what you think of it.

HAve a nice experience!
