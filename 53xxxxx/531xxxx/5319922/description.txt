GTA Liberty City Stories "PC Version" Intro "Add-on".

If you downloaded the GTA Liberty City Stories "PC Version"...

... that uses GTASA engine, GTA3 maps and actual GTALCS content...

... you noticed it has no Intro like the usual 3D GTA Series. Then:


I just converted this one from the PS2 Version, from Yo!Toobe actually.

The're both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect screens, good sound, medium video quality.


If you see no seeders, try downloading even so... It shows none for me too.

HOW TO INSTALL:

1. Go to: "-"  Means the separating bar that TPB delete on the text ... o.O ???

... - Rockstar Games - GTA Liberty City Stories PC Edition beta 3.1.1 - Movies

2. Delete or rename to whatever you want the file "logo.mpg" (ex.: 1logo.mpg)
That's why you get an black screen, it's in a diferent compression of the game.

3. Rename the file "gtatitles.mpg" to "logo,mpg" - it will be like the R* logo.

4. Copy the "NEW" "gtatitles,mpg"(actual intro) on the "Movies" folder.

5. Run the game, you must see the "LCS Team" and them three R* logos and the Intro.
