[T],Dodecahedron9,2010-01-30T11:33Z,"Thanks. If you're having problems with the speed is because in less than a day 80 seeders took off. For a 2-week old episode there should be at least 20 seeders at any given moment to keep it going, otherwise it will be gone by the end of the season. Extra seeders are always appreciated, especially for non-mainstream shows."
