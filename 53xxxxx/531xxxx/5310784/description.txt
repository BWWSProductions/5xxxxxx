"I was the shadow of the waxwing slain
By the false azure in the windowpane"

American poet John Shade and the obsessions of Charles
Kinbote his mad - & possibly regal - European stalker.

Retains some of the flavour of Nabokov's strange but
very readable novel, but it could not emulate the sneaky
way the novel reveals and obscures. 

Well worth a listen for all that.
