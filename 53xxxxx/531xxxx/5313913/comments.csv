I haven't downloaded yours, but I'm guessing the quality is about the same? If yours is better I'd gladly download it however."
,Abrucard,2010-03-22T18:51Z,"Are you aware of the difference between Xvid and H.264? If not, it's BIG. These are encoded with the H.264 codec, AC3 Passthrough, meaning higher than 320kbs for the audio. H.264 has a better compression ratio, and overall picture quality in my opinion. The original source of the videos I downloaded were from a DVD rip. The problem was, the person who did it, broke the videos, so the only way to watch them, was to re-encode. No, this is NOT a re-upload, because I personally fixed these files, and took out the remaining junk in the mkv containers. The torrent I was referred to in the comments is most likely encoded with Xvid, since the container is .avi, the difference with MY upload, is that mine contains both the Japanese AND English audio, as well as English subtitles. As far as total bitrate, I wasn't paying attention, but the constant quality rate I set in handbrake was either 60% or higher (in handbrake on windows, higher = better) 70% or higher results in the output being bigger than the input, I set it so it matched the original sizes as closely as possible. The lost quality is minimal, and you have to be looking VERY close to notice the difference. So in short, this IS a higher quality rip than the other torrent posted in comments, it contains MUCH more. I have run into no problems watching them myself. Believe me, if I had the original DVDs, these would probably be a bit better, but again, I fixed the originals that were floating around."
,NeatManatee,2010-05-12T02:38Z,"Thank you so much for this torrent, I watched Lain like 7 years ago with a spanish dub audio, could understand a little since im from brazil and spanish and portuguese are somewhat similar, but animes are always so much better to watch with original japanese audio, again, thank you!"
,PHREEBO,2010-08-05T14:04Z,"Thanks for this, great anime series! That other torrent Qvazzler talked about is just hard subbed Eng. with just Japanese audio and they are WMV mislabeled as AVI. This one has it all with Eng/Jap audio and softsubs, just like Abrucard said. The latest version of KMPlayer plays these. TIP: You can quickly change the order of the audio/subs with mkvmerge GUI."
,koudepinda,2011-01-17T10:55Z,resolution??? looking for some serious quality. size doesnt matter
,beltsnspoons,2011-03-06T12:50Z,"looks like a great torrent, im downloading now, will check quality n leave another post with a/v rating imho.  willl seed for as long as possible if the torrent is good.  thanks for taking the time to make a good torrent available for an awesome series."
,beltsnspoons,2011-03-06T17:05Z,"after previewing the first episode my opinion is this is an excellent torrent, superb quality.

,biffbiffson,2011-04-23T22:04Z,awesome rips! seeding here
,Jagoob,2011-07-14T08:33Z,Why on earth did you take out the openings / endings?????? I mean everything else you did with it was fine and good quality but this series probably has my favorite opening song of all time and now I'm going to have to download a whole new torrent just so I can have one with the opening song is really lame. So anyway if you liked the opening song on this show don't waste your time on this torrent.
,derpnhurp,2011-07-23T05:30Z,"Thank you for the high quality sharing.  I appreciate you taking the time to do it right.
This will be the first time I have watched this properly.  The last time I attempted,  it was an unfriendly experience.
Will seed for a while.  Thanks again."

,samuraijon1,2012-06-01T22:16Z,can anyone tell me why this does not work on mpc home cinema i get like green shit all over the place and just a blurry mess 
,xtokumeix,2012-07-20T08:39Z,"True, no opening, but whatever. I'm more a quality whore and when I read ""re-encode"" I was skeptical. Re-encode means quality loss. But it is nonetheless better than the other torrent seeded here on TPB: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3249341/Serial_Experiments_Lain_(Complete_Series)

notice the compression artifacts on the other torrent, particularly in the circled area."
