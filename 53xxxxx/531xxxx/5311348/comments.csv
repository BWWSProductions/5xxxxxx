,strangewierding,2010-02-06T02:34Z,"""OCTGN is software created by fans that essentially allows you to play cardgames, with full graphics for all the cards, for free online. With OCTGN, up to four players can play online at once, and sealed & draft deck games are possible.

OCTGN is totally free and easy to use. And better yet, you have as many cards as you'd like. You do not have to trade for cards or purchase new cards.

With OCTGN, you have an unlimited amount of cards that you might need for as many decks as you'd like to build. If you don't like to build a deck, you can even import a deck that someone else made.""

,ZOMBIE91,2011-03-12T16:36Z,"I can't install it :P It says: This application requires your system to be updated to Microsoft Common Language Runtime Version 4.0.303119.0.

Any ideas?"
,brinelol,2011-07-03T22:55Z,"please properly support the OCTGN MTG community by NOT using Torrents to download the MTG files.  We have many new users entering our community frustrated and unable to get OCTGN to work, because they obtain outdated and incorrect files from these torrents.  The MTG files are updated much too often for torrent seeding to ever be effective.  You are NOT doing the community a favor by uploading them onto torrent portal sites, in fact you're adding to the headache.

http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com (and http://octgnsets.freeforums.org, but it is shutting down soon) are the ONLY official places to obtain the OCTGN MTG files.  

If you ignore my warnings and continue to download/upload the files using torrents then WE WILL NO LONGER HELP YOU.  We are getting sick and tired of the users coming to our chatroom asking for help because their torrented files do not work."
