These torrents are just for future use. They are 100% real, there is just no way to play them yet since modchips and custom firmwares are only being developed, they are not ready as of april 2010.

You will likely also need a bd-r burner (cheap, 120e) and bluray discs from sweburn.com (20$ for spindle of 10, cheap) to use these.

However, they will not work yet, so don't waste your fucking disks. You must wait."
