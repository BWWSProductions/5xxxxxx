,kaizen07,2010-01-28T16:21Z,Hello HR! Thanks a million for all the amazing uploads. Enjoyed the quality of your releases. Could you please bring back the option for 5.1 audio for HD Movies. I'm playing ur releases on my PS3 and it would only play AAC stereo for audio. The last release from you that I had on 5.1 audio was Whiteout and the sound really makes a huge difference. Thanks again!
