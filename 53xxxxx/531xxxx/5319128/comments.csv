,psaikia,2011-03-17T09:00Z,could you please upload crack for PTC arbortext editor. please 
,miked983,2011-06-11T23:02Z,"The program seems to be working though the instructions are kind of lousy and the patching program / instructional information refers to files that don't seem to exist...

Anyways FYI if you're clicking the setup.exe and you just get a spinning hourglass for a half-second and nothing happens, I was having the same problem. Extracting the IMG to documents, running as admin, running in compatibility mode, converting it to an ISO, using different mounting progs... nothing worked. I switched it over from my laptop (Windows 7 - 64 bit) to my desktop (Windows 7 - 32 bit) and the install proceeded without a hitch. This may be your problem...."

,DragonRider65,2011-06-26T20:42Z,"I just saw a job posting where they were asking for experience with this program; I am a Graphic Designer with a Degree in Computer Drafting & Design from ITT Tech and we never used this program! All our 3d Modeling was done using Autodesk Inventor Professional and Studio 3D Max! I have heard of Solidworks before, but I have never heard of this? I will seed this until the ratio is 1:1, okay? Thanks for the upload, I appreciate it.  The DragonRider65."
