Alex welcomes back to the show Mark Dice, the Christian conservative political activist based in San Diego, California. Dice's latest culture jamming effort consisted of a petition to repeal the First Amendment. A surprising number of people signed the petition. Mark's latest book is The New World Order Facts & Fiction. He is also the author of The Resistance Manifesto. Both are available at the Infowars store.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
