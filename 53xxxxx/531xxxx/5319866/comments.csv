,erivar62,2010-09-19T07:25Z," The 25th Hour,  is a film like Doctor Jivago, likes of whome is rare to be seen in film making for it is that great; Antony Quinn makes this film and agreed it is his best performance of a life time. Thanks to Carlo Ponti's courage this film was produced and of course the Turkish-born directors gem of a talent in his direction. Virna lisi is superb, as are other well casted actors. 
  The Bridge , a Bernhard Wicki  film comes to mind  for those in Pirates Bay  (dubbed version hope its available) that is in this rare greatness gandre of film.  "
