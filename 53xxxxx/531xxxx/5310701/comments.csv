[T],skJGZV6z,2010-01-27T09:55Z,Never knew AJ until I heard bits of him on shortwave a few weeks back (there seem to only be uber religious nuts and China Radio on the broadcast HF bands these days). So I'm here to check out the show in a high-quality format. I recognize him now as a frequent contributor to Gov. Ventura's new show.
[T],skJGZV6z,2010-01-27T13:05Z,"So I just finished listening to my 1st ever AJ radio show. My impression: I don't think I care for AJ. I liked/was-interested in many points he discussed or referred to tangentially while pressing his main topic, but he also makes me feel uneasy.

I'll try to paint a pithy picture: j'ya ever see that Kevin Costner film, ""The Postman""? I think if AJ ever got real leadership power over a sizeable community, he'd ultimately become the Gen. Bethlehem character. Ever see ""Jericho"" on CBS a few years back? Ok, he'd become a Constantino.

He mentioned the recent Austin TX rally in support of 2nd amdt freedoms. He mentioned it in this show in a tone and phrasing which might suggest he was it's organizer or leading speaker. Across the web it appears (as recorded by other self-described libertarians and anarchists) that he was more the rally's crasher, aggrandizing himself and making it difficult for the invited rally speakers to deliver their talks. Crazy stuff."
