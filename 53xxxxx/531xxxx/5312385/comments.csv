,daba_1,2010-01-27T16:04Z,"Al Kooper And Mike Bloomfield - Fillmore East - The Lost Consert Tapes (1968)
The recording opens with an introduction and then a guitar drenched version of ""One Way Out"" with quivering Bloomfield vocals. Bloomfield then introduces an unsigned Johnny Winter who plays an extended version of B.B. King's ""It's My Own Fault"". After hearing Winter's blistering guitar solo on this tune, it's no wonder that Columbia executives were falling all over themselves to sign him the next morning.
If you can find this I know you will love it.

I already have JohnnyWinter - Raised On Blues, but i still applaud you and thank you for your efforts as always. :D)"

I'm quite grateful and I know most others are too."
,daba_1,2010-01-28T13:40Z,"I am eternally grateful for Night?s uploads and let me explain why. You look at the Blues or old Classic rock albums and you say they are American groups. This is true however they are not being pressed in America. If you check the back album covers you will see made in Japan, EU, Germany, Sweden and etc. These recordings are of the highest quality. So especially for people in North America, [where I am] if you go to the music stores you would have to order an import. This means waiting up to 3 months to get it and paying premium dollars. So even if you are leery about logging in on TPB and put in a thank you, at the very least seed whatever amount you can. Night sees this and in it?s self is a thank you. "
