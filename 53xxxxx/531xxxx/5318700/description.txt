--==About==--
This is just a beta release, there is still alot more to do with this bot.

--==Setup==--
1. To get this working you need to run the program once, it will generate a file called "TurfBot Key.txt".
2. Open this file, inside you will find your 8 character key. 
3. Send this 8 character key to me on my forums, this contains NO personal data.
4. Once activated run the program again. (It could take up to a day for me to activate your key)
5. You will now have a window with 6 buttons, and 2 checkboxes.
6. In the Turf Battles game find a place where the monster names are all one color.
7. Toggle the feed pet, and pick up items options on or off.
8. Go Back to the TBBQ window, select the monster color, either melee or range.
9. The bot will stay active out of the scanning range.

Notes
 - This is a free bot, registration and activation is completely free.
 - The bot will start roughly 5 seconds after you click melee or range. 
 - Set your HP potions to hotkey "0"
 - Set your pet food to hotkey "9"
 - This has been tested with only Blade Warriors, and Red Mages.
 - Make sure you have a fair amount of healing potions,depending on monsters/lag you might need them.
 - Have the camera view almost directly above you.
 - Have your hpbar look as it does in the picture on the forum
 - Remember this is still a BETA release.

--==Disclaimer==--
Use this program at your own risk, I will not be held responsible for anything. 
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions you can direct them to me on the forums.

As always if you feel that this is infected just like all the rest of my releases then don't use it, it is as simple as that. To save you the time here is the VirusTotal report for this version, the same scan result of the rest of my programs. Use your head people!
