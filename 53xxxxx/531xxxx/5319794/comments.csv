,surajitghosh37,2010-01-30T11:26Z,"@zmacdaddy8

thats your personal opinion,i liked the movie and so did a lot of people that is why it has high rating in IMDB.
and for the matter of MKVguys rip,i am more than happy with the quality considering the file size,if you do not like why do you download here?find 4 GB rips and download that."
