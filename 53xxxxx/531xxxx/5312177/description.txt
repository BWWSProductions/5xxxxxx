Hi Truthseekers!

Weâ€™ll preview Obamaâ€™s State of the Union speech tomorrow night, will his new initiative to assist the middle class win the Independents who are swaying toward the GOP? Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell is delivering the Republican response. Watch out, Scott â€œSix Packâ€ Brown, McDonnell is also handsome, plus he has a history of remaining fully-clothed, and might give you a run for the money in a 2012 GOP primary . . . .

And Barack Obama plans a budget freeze as the Congressional Budget Office estimates the US budget deficit for the current fiscal year will come in at $1.3 trillion. Expect criticism from both sides on this decision.

Weâ€™ll discuss these and other issues tonight! 877-996-2556
