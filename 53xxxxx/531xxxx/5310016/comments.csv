,zerodark13,2010-02-09T15:29Z,"pigsinablanket: no, they are *not* there, they *really* aren't numbered wrong, there are only -12- music tracks in this torrent, out of -14- tracks that are supposed to be on the album. Tracks 11 & 12 are MISSING. Yo can tell when you  I don't know if you're an idiot or a troll; either way, you are WRONG.

mrsjs: you are able to play...what? The invisible, missing files?"

,sam344,2010-02-19T04:11Z,"This is actually a 16 track CD. You're missing the following tracks:

# 11. ""Gone, Gone, Gone""
Performed by Colin Farrel, Written by Ryan Bingham and T Bone Burnett

# 12. ""If I Needed You""
Written and performed by Townes Van Zandt

Don't believe me? Check Wiki. Check Amazon."
,OrpheusDude,2010-02-25T22:40Z,"NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!
YOU ARE MISSING TWO TRACKS!!!!!!!!
Just look at the album on Amazon:

http://www.amazon.com/Crazy-Heart-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B002ZPIBL8/

It CLEARLY lists 16 tracks, NOT 14.  Your torrent has only 14 tracks: if you can count, you can see that you are missing tracks 11 & 12.

Can some sane person out there create a new, complete torrent of this album?"
[T],mrsjs,2010-02-26T09:54Z,"@sam344

I will re-up the torrent / or create a new one !!

mrsjs"
[T],mrsjs,2010-02-26T09:55Z,"@OrpheusDude 

Will create a new torrent !!
