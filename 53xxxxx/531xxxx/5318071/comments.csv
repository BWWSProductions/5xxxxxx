?Please Help!!"
[V],thethingy,2010-01-30T23:26Z,"if you mean a driver to work with this then you are out of luck, only the addaptors on the list work."
[V],thethingy,2010-02-02T15:40Z,"kingzaf76, your card is supported in vista & 7 only, when you first start the app the driver will install automatically, all of the drivers for the addaptors arein the app."
,panaskarpas95,2010-03-01T20:49Z,i cant press the play button    i have done all the instructions till there you say press the play button... i cannot press itis not active...
,VMarcoV,2010-03-17T14:27Z,"Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network does not support injection: http://www.tamos.com/products/commwifi/technotes.php. For recommended adapters, see: http://www.tamos.com/products/commwifi/adapterlist.php."
,VMarcoV,2010-03-17T14:32Z,NOTE: The app does not work in 64-bit Windows. 
,VMarcoV,2010-03-17T14:51Z,Use this to check if your card is compatible: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5439694. Intel 3945ABG is not compatible.
[V],thethingy,2010-03-17T18:18Z,"VMarcoV, stop SPAMING my torrents with links to your virus bullshit"
,VMarcoV,2010-03-18T00:19Z," I'll stop ""spamming"" when you 1) learn to spell and 2) stop lying. 

Intel 3945ABG is not compatible and you can't do shit with it. Period. 

How the fuck did you become VIP when you can't tell what's a virus and what's not? 

Come back when you can spell and when you don't need to lie and deceive anymore. 

Fuck you!"
[V],thethingy,2010-03-18T11:10Z,"VMarcoV, you fool there is a list of what works on the torrent description, your bullshit thing is not required, anyone that can read knows what will and will not work, thanks for your efforts but you are just confusing yourself."
[V],thethingy,2010-03-18T11:29Z,"Intel 3945, 4965, 5100, 5150, 5300, and 5350 Adapters 

Supported only under Windows Vista, Windows 2008, and Windows 7. 

Make sure that the Intel driver that you are using for your adapter is version 12.4.3.9 or higher. Older driver versions will not work properly in monitor mode. If you're using an older driver version, please visit www.intel.com to download the latest version. 
Packet injection using Packet Generator is not possible. 
When monitoring 802.11n networks with 40 MHz channel bonding, you cannot choose whether the secondary 20 MHz channel is below or above the primary one; the adapter's default settings will be used. Note that Intel's 3945 and 4965 adapters don't support 40 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band; whereas Intel's 5100, 5150, 5300, and 5350 models support 40 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band as long as the corresponding setting is enabled in the driver properties in Device Manager. 
When monitoring 802.11n networks, the adapter driver reports the packet transmission rate of 802.11n packets incorrectly. For example, a packet with a rate of 270 Mbps might appear with a rate of 1 Mbps or 9 Mbps. This is an issue with the adapter driver that is out of our control. "
,VMarcoV,2010-03-18T20:17Z,"Not everyone know which adapter they have. My upload saves them the effort of finding out. AND the effort of checking with the lists. 

The reason why Intel's card doesn't work is because it doesn't support injection. "
,damal,2010-03-19T04:25Z,"Hi Thethingy thanx for th uploads great gob. But i have a question on a diffrent app called Wifi Slax i saw your comment on it, and i was wondering could you please take the time to send me any instructions to www.mal10@fsmail.net

Thank you again"
[V],thethingy,2010-03-19T09:50Z,"damal, use this software, there is instructions in the download.

VMarcoV, true that intel doesent suport 1 type of injection, there are other types that it will support and this software does much more than just get the wep/wap key"
,damal,2010-03-20T05:33Z,"thanx thethingy,

keep up the good work"
,Nnyrb,2010-03-20T11:14Z,"Hello thethingy, I've got a quick question. I've downloaded CommView and I'm working on editing the formula. I typed in the text you said to type in and it's tell me there is a syntax error. What is this and how do I fix it? 

Thank you so much. "
,Nnyrb,2010-03-20T11:17Z,"I figured it out, never mind. =)"

thething reply;

This software automaticaly installs the driver for you. So what you are saying is its easier to go to your torrents and download your thing then install it and run the app than it is to read the adaptor list in this torrent description, I dont think so."
,Darkrituals,2010-03-31T20:22Z,"Another and prob one of the best tools for penertration testing and wirless cracking via injection is probably Backtrack4 loads of interesting apps/features not just for wirless but bluetooth and it boots from usb,iso so you can even bypass windows security.

[V],thethingy,2010-04-01T11:00Z,^^^ Thanks
,damal,2010-04-06T06:35Z,"Hi Thethingy is this method for wep or wpa?

,jahem1980,2010-05-28T09:03Z,I see a lot of people bitching and whining all the time because they don't know what they're doing and try to blame it on the uploader but I say thanx thethingy for everything you do and keep up the great work!!! 
,jahem1980,2010-05-28T09:05Z,"Lord knows you've really helped me in the past(scorpionking in the forum). Other sites have a lot of fake torrents so we should all be grateful for tpb's official peeps like thethingy, jay_federer, DeGun, and raymondholme!"
,jahem1980,2010-05-28T09:10Z,"@thethingy how about pm me again and give me some useful tips on torrenting(the right bittorrent, UL,DL,etc.) you know, how to be a pro like you! I've been doing this for about 3 weeks and am getting pretty good pretty fast thanks to ppl like you and the others I mentioned earlier!"
,dashivasss,2010-08-15T07:26Z,"Thank you!!! You are the thingy!!!

Aside from being silly- I been on here for years and have uploaded a bit and I have to say that your torrents are ALWAYS flawless; not to mention the WAY extra mile you go in babysitting.  
Thanks again."
,garycooper,2010-10-25T14:38Z,thanks for up thingy. i have win 64 so cant run software. my wireless adapter is Atheros AR5B93 is there any way to get any software to run on win 64 with this adapter?
,shanet1st,2010-11-22T05:23Z,"Very good torrent thethingy. I have been looking at your torrents, you really like to upload, dont you??? I'm surprised you dont have a bigger name."
,shanet1st,2010-11-22T05:24Z,"And Garycooper, I did notice that it says that 64 bit doesnt work, so we shall try an experiment??? I am no expert here, but have you tried compatibility mode??? Try XP SP2?
This shall be interesting"
,palsf100,2011-05-08T16:40Z,"Why are 3 parts of the description/instructions messed up? I'm seeing 3 of these in there, and they look like important pieces of information: Ã¢â‚¬Å“binÃ¢â‚¬Â"
,Stiel,2011-08-15T04:26Z,"Hello,

I'm having trouble making this work, I have a Dell Wireless 1505 draft 802.11n WLAN Mini-Card Rev 2.0. The list says this is supported, and after forcing an update of CommView it installed the appropriate driver. I began generating packets, however nothing ever appeared in the protocol column. The other computer I was using never got limited access notification, it returned an invalid network key message instead. So I kept entering random passwords and submitting them which made my packet traffic increase each time. When I finally got past 20,000 packets I tried to save the packets, but it said there were no packets there. Even though it clearly said there were 20,000+ at the little diagnostics bar at the very bottom. I'm not sure what is up, or what I did wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Stiel"
