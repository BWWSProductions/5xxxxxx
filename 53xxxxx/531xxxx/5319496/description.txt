Crime and The City Solution were a rock music band formed by Australian singer and songwriter Simon Bonney.


They had four distinct line-ups: Sydney in 1977-78, Melbourne in 1979, and two groupings in Berlin from 1985-1990.

The only common member in all four line-ups was Bonney.

Other members included: former members of The Birthday Party (Mick Harvey and Rowland S.

Howard); former Swell Maps drummer Epic Soundtracks; and Alexander Hacke from EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten.

Crime and the City Solution completed four studio albums and a number of E.Ps during its existence,

and a live album has since been released. Further early recordings have resurfaced on the internet.

Parallels have been drawn between Crime and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.

Crime were famed for their live performances,

where Bonney's delicate physical appearance contrasted sharply with his deep, dark voice. He has since gone on to record solo material.
