A:9

But as a remake of Alan Clarke's classic TV movie with Gary Oldman, it was a bit of a dissapointment. Anybody who has seen the TV film will know wat I mean. It not a bad film, but it's not great either.
Nick Love is a good (not great) director, but it seems he is doing the same films over & over. What stand out here is the the 80's dress and the Soundtrack.
Ok, apart from my movie critique, its a great rip!
