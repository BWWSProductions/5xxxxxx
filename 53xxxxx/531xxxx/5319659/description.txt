Between 1760 and 1830 the imaginations of a few individuals re-ordered human perception. English poets such as William Blake and Lord Byron were are the forefront of this movement. It has since become known as the Romantic Revolution. With this revolution God, Church and abolute monarchy would be displaced from the centre of society and replaced by the visions and desires of the individual. Our modern fundamental perceptions spring from this revolutionary period - our ideas of equality and freedom - our notion of childhood - of the unconscious and our belief in the power of words and images to change the world.

The series follows the growth of the Romantic idea through three episodes: Liberty, Nature, and Eternity. The main focus is the work and lives of some of the giants of the Romantic movement, William Blake, William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The main character however, is the idea itself, how it is relayed, how it affects change in people and in the world itself.

Eternity

This programme in the BBC/OU's Romantics series is the story of a search for meaning, in a world without God.

After the revolutions of the late 18th century, people had to define who they were without regard to the sanctions of religion or the Church. The Romantics would delve into the uncharted depths of the unconscious to find the keys to their identity: they would emerge with new ways of thinking and of leading their lives.

John Keats would forge poetry of genius from a life of tragedy. His work is a unique statement of human fragility. Keats died from tuberculosis, the archetype of the artist as bohemian outsider. Lord Byron's personal life and political ideals became the subject of scandal in his own lifetime: his self-mythologizing swagger and satirical genius ensured his place in history. Lord Byron created the figure of the self-legislating individual - a man arrogant enough to live by his own rules.

Shelley was an atheist and an exponent of free love - a man consumed by the search for experience and understanding. The search ended on 8th July 1822, when Shelley drowned off the coast of Italy. His body was cremated, but the heart emerged from the flames - a symbol of religious power for an age without religion.
