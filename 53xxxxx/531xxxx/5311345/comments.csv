,erics600,2010-01-29T04:21Z,Woks Great I loaded it no issues
,DaPr0,2010-01-29T12:32Z,how do i install it? or put it on a disc? sorry im a noob. please help me with instructions.
,dpance,2010-01-30T01:01Z,"DaPr0, I was new to all this once and some nice people helped me out.  Time for me to pay it forward.  This is really simple.  iden32 was cool enough to upload what's called an .iso file or a burn of the entire 2009 Turbo Tax Deluxe Edition of the software.  You need to do a search on The Pirate Bay for what is called DAEMON Tools.  This cool little program allows you to ""virtually"" mount an .iso file like the one we have on this torrent.  Download DAEMON, install it, and then mount the Turbo Tax .iso file wherever it resides on your hard drive.  DAEMON creates a virtual disc drive on your computer with a new drive letter and all.  The moment I mounted the file it started the install process.  Looking in my Windows Explorer I see the virtual drive (G: on my machine) with the red Turbo Tax check mark logo as the .iso file is still mounted to that drive.  Again, as soon as I used DAEMON Tools to mount the .iso it started to install the software like you've done a million times prior.  Hope this helps.  Oh, and of course DAEMON isn't the only software out there that will allow you to mount a virtual drive on your pc.  Do a small bit of reading and use Google to search.  It should make a bit more sense.  Comment again if you need further assistance.  Good luck dude!"
,iden32,2010-01-30T04:19Z,great write up!!! thanks man! i tried to get the universal format (hence iso) :)) glad it is working for all of you!
,hp79,2010-01-30T21:29Z,"So, is it safe to e-file using this downloaded software?"
,DaPr0,2010-01-31T06:23Z,dpance i really appreciate yoelp .iso files where kicking my @ss. thanx once again.
,DaPr0,2010-01-31T07:57Z,"since youve helped me out, which by the way worked great. i was wondeing if you can help me properly burn an iso file on a blank dvd or cd."
,S-the-Wolf,2010-01-31T14:55Z,"@DaPr0

Find and download Ashampoo Burning Studio. It is a pretty simple to use program that will burn .iso files. It will also allow you to create them. There might be better ones out there but this is what I use. 
"
,iden32,2010-01-31T20:40Z,for iso's i use magiciso it is pretty easy to use and does the job... plus u can emulate a cd drive with the iso so it acts like u burned it to a cd but runs 1000000x faster!
,dpance,2010-02-01T03:21Z,"DaPr0, I knew you could do it bro.  Excellent job!  You've already gotten a couple of GREAT suggestions from other guys on what software to use to burn .iso files on to a blank DVD.  I use Nero which is no better or worse than the other ones out there.  Again, do a search on The Pirate Bay in ""Applications"" and you'll find something that will work just fine.

Hey, thanks again to iden32 for this upload.  I owe you a beer!!!!!!!"
,iden32,2010-02-01T07:05Z,sounds like a deal :D
,Chatterbox08,2010-02-01T09:10Z,"@DaPr0

I like to burn .iso files with imgburn. It is lightweight and simple to use. Plus it's free."
,HumbleGod,2010-02-03T04:41Z,Does this include state?
,jarousek1,2010-02-03T11:56Z,"iden32, I owe you a bottle of your favorite. drink.
For general information:
================ 
This torrent works on both, federal and one state taxes. I just filed last week on Thursday night and both returns,Ferderal and State, were accepted the next day, Friday morning.
One State Tax Return is free and included.
After you finish the Federal return, it will prompt you to download one state for free.
All you have to pay is State E-Filing fee which was something like $ 19.95. You can still avoid that fee and e-mail your State tax return, I choose to pay it.
It is truly a great software and superior  to Tax Cut which
I was using the previous years. There are more and better deductions in Turbo Tax which Tax Cut does not have.
To sum it up, yes, everything work just perfectly.
Again, a huge thanks to Iden32.
Any time you visit my state, we can finish a bottle of your favorite drink.
Cheers.

PS: First screen will ask you for a registration, just click next and skip it. Also, IRS has a cut off deadline on Friday, at 11 AM and your return will be processed the same day."
,esco41,2010-02-04T00:47Z,"Hello everyone: I downloaded this but I cannot seem to get it to work on a Mac. I can see that its supposed to work with both Macs and PC's. Can someone please tell me how to install this software, thank you all."
,jarousek1,2010-02-04T01:15Z,"I think that this one is for Win only.
Mac OS is the second from the top on
a main screen."
,smegma123,2010-02-07T18:56Z,"I got NTI burning software from PB. Double click on any ISO file, the cd ROM door opens. Insert a blank and click burn.  NTI does the rest. I hope that was helpful to people asking about ISOs."
,Hikaru_Ichijo,2010-02-07T23:33Z,"Thanks a lot, it works great and was a real fast download so thanks to all the seeders as well!"

,williamcmoran,2010-02-17T12:40Z,"during installation, it tries to install framework 3.5 sp1 and then fails. Any help would be greatly appreciated. "
,AnonymousCitizen,2010-02-22T03:45Z,"ISO mounts fine, but no mac version in this"
,lar9149,2010-02-22T07:11Z,"I had same problem with 3.5 sp1, but that isn't the turbo tax program its something with the windows system, anycase here is a link that fixed it

,scoopsdapoop,2010-03-23T19:25Z,"Working great, thanks a ton! Two questions though: First, can I update the program? I'm assuming it would almost be necessary to have the most up to date forms and what not. Secondly, is there a possibility of the IRS or Intuit knowing I have a pirated version if I decide to e-file or do so by e-mail? Thanks again!"
,Eric090585,2010-03-30T02:23Z,works great! u can update it too :)
,trickycyclist,2010-03-31T15:58Z,"Stupid stupid question but this can be used for filing Canadian taxes? (i just wasn't sure if the software's different for filing US versus Canadian taxes versus some other taxes and so on).. sorry for sounding like an absolute dumbass *blush*

Great work and many thanks to the uploader!"
