I find your comment very offensive.

I have downloaded a lot of MKVGuy movies & have not had one failure, in fact I have some 700MB to 1.3gig downloads that are no where near as good as the 400MB downloads.

If the story in the movie is not to your liking, download another movie - simple Dude. Read up on the movie in Rotten Tomatoes before you download.

I convert & burn all movies with ""ConvertX to DVD 4"" & I can watch them on the computer using Windows Media Player. I do have issues with volume on the computer at times but I get that regardless of it being a 400MB or 1.3Gig download.
