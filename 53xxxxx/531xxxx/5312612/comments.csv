It doesn't mean that it's true!"

,RevDogs,2010-05-19T11:06Z,"So far ive downloaded this and had everything working (without any hardware) on XP but the whole time while playing mixes there is background noise like a crap codec, or just old audio software on the computer, sounds much like a scratched CD.... unsure how to fix this. pls help!"
,b_denx,2010-05-24T13:07Z,"@revDog
your problem is hardware, go to audio settings, and increase latency to at least 10, or maybe 15 ms...
with integrated audio you cant fully enjoy traktor or any other dj program, since its not strong enough to run it, its like gaming on integrated graphics card...
salute :D"
