In the sequel your brain is wired directly to sophisticated command and control center, so you have to colonize and defend a new world. As in previous game you have to build houses, control resources to build combat vehicles and eliminate any foe, that shows in your sight. Turn-based elements allows you to show all your experience in military tactics.

This game didn't fare as well as the first one. I was a beta tester for this game back in the days when game companies gave out free copies to their testers. We all knew it wouldn't do as good as the 1st game mainly because the developers wanted to fare too far away from the tried & true original concept. Most critics panned it though. I didn't think it was THAT bad and enjoy playing it once in a while almost as much as the first game.
