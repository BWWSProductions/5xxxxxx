I like the idea of orgasm control. Whether they're made to comply or denied doesnâ€™t really matter to me, but there is something special about any scene once cumming becomes a privilege or a punishment. Anyone who has been on either side of it knows what I mean. When a girl is made to cum she may enjoy it at first, but as time goes on you both know itâ€™s going to start to hurt. Each one increases her sensitivity until she stops moaning from pleasure and starts screaming for mercy. Denial is just as good. Psychologically, knowing they arenâ€™t allowed to cum makes some girls nearly explode in anticipation. They will say or do anything to get off. Once youâ€™ve teased one into a frenzy sheâ€™ll suffer through anything for a shot at sweet release.
