Please seed (share) these programs. Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks.

Explorer Notes 2 lets you associate a note of up to 256 characters with any file 
or folder. Even files and folders on CD & DVD, as the notes reside in the registry
and are not physically present on an optical disc.

You add or edit notes via the right-click context menu, and search for notes using
the Start menu's Find option.

Right-click and right-drag menu items let you copy, move, rename, or delete files
while updating their notes. A Note Manager utility offers tools for backup, repair
and other note management tasks.
