Sean Bean a no name actor...hmmm? You need to see him the 'SHARP' series and the numerous other films etc. he has done before making comments like that. Do you EVER have anything nice/good to say about anything/anybody/anyone? You're always knocking everything and everybody. Is life really that sad for you? :)

,OGma59,2010-01-29T00:55Z,"hey, zmacdaddy8 (i seriously doubt you live up to the name, by the way)....chill out. .BONE is good upper from whom i have obtained many fine FREE films. he/she does this for us for FREE, doesn't get paid to bring us quality ups.  so maybe a ""thank you"" would be in order rather than a threat, douche bag.
thanks to you, BONE, for your work. some of us appreciate it. "
,ticktock_man,2010-01-29T02:50Z,"rather than arguing back and forth like a bunch of niggers, you mouthbreathers could have left a simple comment as to A/V, and people would have known that this is a shitty FULLSCREEN rip and wouldnt have wasted their time downloading it.

That's slightly less than fullscreen. So, instead of calling each other the n-word, and spouting off about people's mothers, you should go familiarize yourself with screen resolutions like intelligent little girls and boys. "
,jbhantu,2010-02-03T20:47Z,"A = 9
V = 9

Actors are actors. Basically it's a poor portrayal of poorly written script. I'll seed until my usual 4:1 just because I downloaded not because it's a good movie.

Regardless, thanks .BONE. Keep it up"
,Brandolf,2010-02-05T17:54Z,"@CSuk & rb6468

Sean Bean....by majority is a no name actor....just cause hes been in stuff that you can name doesn't mean we shouldn't call him that....I don't even feel that its a bad thing to be called....a lot of people were no name actors at some point in their lives....it just means nobody knows who they are.....or at least no body who matters knows who they are...that's why hes in this poorly written and directed piece of shit called ""Cash"".

And zmacdaddy8..  [x]  ...that's one vote for you being the biggest douche bag on Pirate Bay. WHOS WITH ME!!!!  "

,mufuti9,2010-02-26T23:14Z,"BAD QUALITY.
Very mediocre movie too.

This is a stretched full screen rip of a movie that is originally NOT fullscreen. I suggest you get a proper RIP, ideally the now available Blueray or Blueray Rip.

you wont miss anything major if you dont watch the movie though... at least Sean Bean is able to give an interesting performance. Very good actor.
