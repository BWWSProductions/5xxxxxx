,incaroads0,2010-01-29T03:27Z,"Try using ""7-zip"". I normaly only have to extract once."
,PhilLesh12,2010-01-29T04:04Z,"it's worse for people who have a computer set up in one room to automatically download torrents with rss downloader in utorrent to watch on a WD TV Live in a room two floors down.

I have to go up three flights of stairs to unrar any tvteam torrents.  real pain in the ass.

With most other groups, I can just start watching a movie as soon as it appears in the menu on the TV in my home theater."
,DuhRAR,2010-01-29T04:16Z,"Man I'm completely sick of the dumbasses who persist on carrying on about RAR files. If you can't extract them yourself then you shouldn't own a computer...

More importantly if you knew anything about ISP's and packet sniffing etc if the files are not in RAR format then they could easily sniff your traffic and know if your downloading something that may be illegal.

For myself, I will only download RAR files until the point I need an encrypted service for my torrents as personally.

download winrar http://www.rarlab.com/ and get some common sense!"
,MoonDookie,2010-01-29T04:26Z,"@PhilLesh12
listen to what you are saying.......""I have to go up three flights of stairs to unrar any tvteam torrents""
the key here is torrents = free content.
shut the fuck up and deal with it, or get a job and buy some cable tv..'cheers"

,mcdave71,2010-01-29T15:37Z,"If you have to walk up stairs, why don't you set up remote desktop or vnc and do it remotely??"
,themotherfucker,2010-01-30T01:33Z,"@philesh12 is an oxygen thief waste of space, brain of a deep sea racing mallet. unintelligence so uncivilize aboriginal cunt!"
,dudelaw,2010-01-30T03:12Z,"To: D3LinQuENT.
Get another player.. I use VLC and never had that problem. Top rar file, exctract here, done in a couple of seconds... Never a problem.. Thanks for the load TV Team! Peace.."
,MeNoob,2010-01-30T03:36Z,"Stop complaining, go buy urself original DVD instead."
,dudelaw,2010-01-30T03:43Z,Hehe..
,flatlandr,2010-01-30T22:29Z,Rar is the only way to go. Don't want RAR then go somewhere else. Most secure method.
,mrhinter,2010-01-31T17:09Z,"exactly. dont download it if its that much of a problem for you, you arent asked for anything more than seeding in return. if you wanna make it nice and easy, be legit, wait for the real copy, then you can walk up and down your three damned flights of stairs to change discs..... whiney little girls..... tsk tsk..."
,BrotherT2010,2010-02-03T00:09Z,"Enough arguing, people! How about commenting on the audio/video quality instead of complaining about a FREE movie you're getting. "
,davidouu,2010-02-14T01:07Z,"Pretty unbelievable to read some twat whining about going up stairs...wanker...
I have not downloaded this yet....but I fully expect this to be of high quality...its a TvTeam file and I have dl'd maybe 2 dozen of their files so far and all are shit hot as far as A & V go........
"
,underlander,2010-02-15T11:08Z,"Ok, gentlemen. Could anybody say fucknig something about  quality, huh?"
,franglais,2010-02-17T11:43Z,"If there's one legit complaint to d/l rars, it could be that it takes up *precious* disk space, and may encourage people to stop seeding before a certain ratio is met.

Once unrared, *nice* people keep the rars to seed them to a decent ratio. Afterwards, we can delete them or whatever. 
So until, say, a ratio of 1:15, we're stuck with a rar or 700mb, and an .avi of another 700mb or so."
,rahulpear,2010-02-22T12:44Z,"video - 8
audio - 8
movie - 9"
,ptv83,2010-02-28T19:28Z,"@ themotherfucker.. rasist bastard, fucking biggot, you got a problem against native peoples eh?

GO FUCK YOURSELF, or better yet GO SIT ON A GRENADE .. asshole."
,dearghoul,2010-10-07T01:45Z,"@franglais, good comment, I hadn't thought of that, but reckon it's quite true"
