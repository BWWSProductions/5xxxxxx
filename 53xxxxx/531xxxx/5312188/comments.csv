,alansprin,2010-01-27T19:53Z,available for dl-ing hope it works for you guys...and DONT try to install it with deamon tools or alcohol its just impossible....burn it to cd with magicISO u can download that at pirate bay also
,mihir20,2010-01-28T18:38Z,Wat's the problem with daemon tools??
,mihir20,2010-01-28T18:38Z,will it work with nero
,alansprin,2010-01-28T18:44Z,if you try to install it woth deamon tools when you restart PC(wich is essential)pc wont have anything to boot from since is kinda impossible to make emulated drive a booting drive.....download program magicISO u can find it here http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/3917782/Magic_ISO_Maker_5.4_with_serial.3917782.TPB.torrent  this program can rip ISO image onto cd so it will act like a original
,mihir20,2010-01-29T16:37Z,that means by using magicIso i need not hav to burn a new disc
,alansprin,2010-01-29T20:06Z,yes....after you burnt it with magic iso then it will be a cd same as original.....it will rip the image and make it a bootable cd
