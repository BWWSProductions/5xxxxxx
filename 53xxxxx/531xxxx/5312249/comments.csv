,Philonetic,2010-03-15T21:14Z,"@rki1530
You'll need the -laptop keyboard- patch.  U can get it from my mods package in another ff7 torrent ->http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5371471/%5BPC%5DFinal.Fantasy.VII.%287%29Hi-Res.Mods.Perfect.Repack

But be warned, you can't install the other mods on the Ultima/Ultimate version, you'd need the full pc version."
,Philonetic,2010-03-29T20:25Z,"repacked, now here -->http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5471183"
,Phatality,2010-04-29T05:11Z,"Works great for me, all i did was run the setup and thats all."

,wewel1,2010-05-21T16:55Z,"Hi guys,, I've downloaded it, everything works perfectly, except on the cinematics where i don't have any sound anymore...

Got any idea to solve the prob ?"
,erkiloerki123,2010-05-29T09:59Z,THIS IS SHIT DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,da5sgd69,2010-06-02T03:53Z,"hey i need help, i downloaded and everything and the main menu works fine but why cant i use any keys on the keyboard or the mouse to highlight the ""continue"" or ""new"" game options, so if anyone could help out by making another patch to use the keyboard because the one that was posted by Philonetic isnt there anymore"
,FuzzyMuffins,2010-06-08T08:32Z,I need a patch or something too i get to the menu and i cant select anything
,a.criminal.mind,2010-06-18T17:04Z,"da5sgd69 and FuzzyMuffins: Yeah, both  of you need a laptop keyboard patch. Use the link that Philonetic posted. At first I thought that something was wrong because I too got to the new game/continue screen and I couldn't do anything. I didn't get that you have to use the numerical keys on the right of the keyboard... *stupid me* '-.- But now it works like a charm! Thank you so much, I looove this game! My dream is that they would do a remake to ps3 or xbox. Imagine playing this with ffXIII graphics! :D"

,2blunts,2010-07-02T01:05Z,"first of all, thank you very much for posting this. But i'm having a problem. 

It allows me to start a new game and the cinematic works fine and it gets to the part where Cloud jumps out of the Train and anytime i get into my first battle or i try to access the menu, the game closes and windows tells me it stopped working so i have to end the program. I'm running this on Windows 7 so please any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks"
,epic300zx,2010-08-03T20:37Z,Yea this is just like all the other versions im running win 7 and the installation freezes when it says Finishing installation. 
,slash2020,2010-08-14T07:07Z,i had no trouble downloading it but i need a keyboard patch bc im on a laptop.  Philonetic can you put the patch back up? thanks
,Panesar111,2010-09-01T02:50Z,This Game works Fine Their is just One Fatal flaw in mine. My game won't save. I'm not sure if your supposed to get to a certain point before you save but i've gone all the way to were you meet Tifa and i still can't save. Somone help me!

,saku234,2011-11-08T05:04Z,"Panesar111

Yes, your supposed to get to a certain point before you save, not a flaw."
