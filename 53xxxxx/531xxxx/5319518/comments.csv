,speedemn,2010-02-15T00:58Z,Does a 3GS have to be jailbroken in order to install this?  Is there any way to install it on a non-JB phone?
,M0DiFiEDZ,2010-02-25T09:29Z,"Thanks. Works perfectly, with no mods required. I have also TomTom and Magellan and I like this Navigon alot more. 
To the one that asked,...yes you have to be JailBroken. All I did was SSH with WinSCP and copy the IPA into my Downloads Folder, (the same folder that Installous saves IPA's in) and then opened Installous and went to downloads and pressed install. "
