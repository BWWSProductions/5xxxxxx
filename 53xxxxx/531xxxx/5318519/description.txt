DOS(Box) Games Bootable CD version 3.1 (provided by Brood Warior)

========
OVERVIEW
========

DOS(Box) Games Bootable CD contains over 190 games for MS-DOS and
over 100 games for Microsoft Windows 3.x. The games can be played
from Windows (tested on Windows XP), Linux (tested on Ubuntu 9.10)
and as the title says, the CD is bootable, which gives you the
ability to play the games in pure MS-DOS mode or from the built-in
Linux distribution (Slax 6.1.2) provided along with the games.

Moreover, the games can easily be copied or installed on your hard
drive, USB flash device or any other writable media. Starting from
version 3.1, the CD comes with extended usability support for DOS,
Windows, and Linux.

==========
HOW TO USE
==========

There are many (and I mean really many) ways to run the games:

1) (Windows) Put the CD in your CD-ROM device (or mount with Daemon
   Tools) and then double click on the CD icon located in My Computer.
   Now you have the option to play the games directly. In this mode
   the games will be installed in your Windows TEMP directory.

2) (Linux) Restart the computer and boot from the CD. Choose one of
   the Slax related boot options. A system with 1GB RAM or more is
   required. After Slax has started, you will find a shortcut on
   the desktop, from which you can start the games.
   
3) (MS-DOS) Restart the computer and boot from the CD. Choose the
   MS-DOS 7.1 boot option. A system with 64MB RAM or more is required.
   Most of the games might not work well though, as this mode is
   'last resort of hope' and is kind of unsupported... sorry.

4) (Windows, Linux) Copy ALL files and directories from the CD to any
   directory you want. In this mode you  will have the option to play
   the games directly or install them automatically to the folder
   'playgame' (if the folder is writable). You need to run 'Games.exe'
   for Windows or execute the command 'sh games.sh' in termainal console
   for Linux in order to play the games in this mode. If you have done
   this on your USB flash device, you can easily make it bootable later.

5) (Windows, Linux) Navigate to the folder 'slax' => 'rootcopy' and
   copy the 'dosgames' folder which resides in 'rootcopy' to any
   location at your choice. Inside 'dosgames' you will find additional
   set of startup files ('Games.exe' for Windows and 'games.sh' for Linux).
   In this way you can't make bootable USB flash device but you are
   preserving space as you are not copying the built-in Slax distribution.
   The games are fully loadable and playable. This option is useful
   when for example you already have a bootable USB flash device and you
   just want to be able to play the provided games.

6) (Windows) Choose 'Install Games' from the context menu of your
   CD-ROM device. There is another option in the same context menu
   which allows you to uninstall the games later.

7) Youse a PC emulator like 'VMware Player', 'Qemu' or 'Virtual Box'.
   These virtualization solutions are free and publicly available.
   After you have obtained, installed and configured one of them, you
   can try one of the options explained above.

Regardless the way you start the system, you will see the same text
based menu from which you can choose an item to run.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Some of the games may not run well in MS-DOS mode!!!

======================
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
======================

When you start the games, the provided executables and scripts will
check if the media you are running the games from is read only or
with read/write permissions. For example, a CD is a read only meadia,
while the HDD device is usually with read/write permissions enabled.

Anyway, the system is 'smart' and if the media is 'read only', then
the games are unpacked to your temporary folder, which location is
specific for your operating system. Usually it is called 'TEMP' or
'TMP' on Windows and '/tmp' on Linux. Although you still can save
and load games, the OS has the final decision when to wipe the
temporary folder, which means that your saves are not safe if you
play for a long time from read only device.

On the other hand, if the system detects a read/write enabled media,
then your games are unpacked to the relative folder 'playgame', which
can be found at 'slax' => 'rootcopy' => 'dosgames' => 'playgame'. In
this way you are assured that all your saved games are at safe location
and that they will not be wiped out unless you do it yourself. For
example you can delete the content of the folder or use the text based
menu to uninstall the game you wish to remove.

In Linux you will need to have DOSBox preinstalled but even if you don't
have it, the provided scripts (games.sh in particualr) will show you how
to install it for Ubuntu. The process is similar for other distributions
and I hope that since you are using Linux, you know what you are doing.

If you use the CD in DOSBox mode, you have the option to install each
item to your HDD or USB flash. This feature enables you to start the
games faster (unpack game only the first time) and your saves are now
really saved, so you can really load them later! This was already
mentioned above, but it doesn't hurt to remind it. :)

Once an item is installed, you have the option to uninstall it. This is
available ONLY for previously installed items.

You also have the option to install permanently all items from this CD
to your HDD or USB flash device. All you need to do is to follow these
easy to do steps:

First option (Windows, Linux): 

1) Copy ALL files and folders from the CD to the location you want. This
   is mandatory if you have copied the files to your USB flash device and
   you intend to make it bootable later.
2) Start the system via 'Games.exe' (for Windows).
   Start the system by executing 'sh games.sh' from console (for Linux).

Second option (Windows, Linux): 

1) Copy tyhe content of 'slax' => 'rootcopy' => 'dosgames' folder from
   the CD to the location you want. Please be aware that in this way you
   can't make your USB flash device bootable. Suitable if you have less
   space available on the destination drive, or if you don't intend to
   make the targeted device bootable.
2) Start the system via 'Games.exe' (for Windows).
   Start the system by executing 'sh games.sh' from console (for Linux).

Third option (Windows):

1) From the context menu of your CD-ROM device choose 'Install Games'.
2) Start the system via 'Games.exe' (or create shortcut for this file).

To create a bootable USB flash device, follow these instructions:

1) Copy ALL files and folders from the CD to the root directory of your
   USB flash device.
2) Navigate to the folder 'boot' and execute 'bootinst.bat' (Windows)
   or 'bootinst.sh' (Linux). Then you just need to follow the provided
   instructions and if everything goes fine, you will be able to boot
   from your USB flash device.

Due to design issues the games on this CD will not work well in pure
MS-DOS mode if you have more than one physical CD-ROM device. In this
case you should choose the alternative boot option from the MS-DOS
section and then load the games manually. Yo need to know how to work
with MS-DOS text console in order to do that and since the majority of
the modern society have no idea how to do that, please try some of the
other available options first. For example if you use the system as
bootable media, you may first try to play the games from the built-in
Linux distribution insted from the pure 'legacy' MS-DOS mode.

Have fun! :)
