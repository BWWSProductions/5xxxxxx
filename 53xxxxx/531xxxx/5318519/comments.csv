,fatdata222,2010-01-30T11:53Z,"In Windows all games are 'sandboxed' in DOSBox, which means that the games have no access to network connections and no access to core HDD files. So, no virus/malware/adware/whatsoever can damage your system. Moreover, we are talking about MS_DOS games and executables, these things are so old, that nothing can actually damage a modern Windows system at all.

Linux - even harder to penetrate.

Linux live mode - again all games are 'sandboxed' in DOSBox.

MS-DOS mode - the games don't even know that your HDD exists, so again nothing can damage your system.

Of course, you can always test the games with option (7) as explained in the readme document and reast assured that the games have no idea that your PC even exists:

""Use a PC emulator like 'VMware Player', 'Qemu' or 'Virtual Box'. These virtualization solutions are free and publicly available. After you have obtained, installed and configured one of them, you can try one of the options explained above.""

Cheers! :)"

can easily hide at virus somwhere in that iso-file,
uploadet by somone called ""anonymous""
Sorry, but i have more confidence in Avast than in you"
,fatdata222,2010-01-30T21:21Z,"@pwh,

Please feel free to evaluate the ISO with one of the PC emulators mentioned above and then share your opinion. If there is a way to avoid viruses, spyware, malware and malicious code at all - this is the solution!

Also, can you please give more information where do you find problems? Where does 'Avast' raise the red flag?"
