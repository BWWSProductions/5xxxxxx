Hammett (1982)

Retired private investigator-turned-novelist Dashiell Hammett thought that he had left his old life behind. But when his ex-boss consults him about a particularly difficult missing-persons assignment, Hammett feels obligated to get involved-only to become the target of a deadly crime ring and a corrupt police detective.
