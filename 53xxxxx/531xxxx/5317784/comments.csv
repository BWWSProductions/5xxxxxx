,LifeMC,2010-01-30T00:05Z,"i work with subs, these subtitles dont match"
,michaelingeorgia,2010-01-31T00:03Z,"The subtitles posted above worked for me great. I just renamed the file the same as the .avi movie file played with VLAN (VLC player). 

Move does look pretty fun, by the way. As one IMDB commenter suggested, it's got much of the spirit of the original SPIDER-MAN film, except the kid's ""powers"" are a fantastic flying car. Based on the look of the special effects, it's fairly big budget for a non-Hollywood film, too. "

,LifeMC,2010-03-02T12:44Z,subtitles are here! http://www.subs4free.com/download-1093935.html
,wanderingeyes,2010-05-02T21:33Z,"Sadly, those subtitles are no good. They're full of... whatever the Russian version of Engrish is, and they go out of sync after 40mins! :("
,wanderingeyes,2010-05-02T21:34Z,The video file itself is great quality though!
