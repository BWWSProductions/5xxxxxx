where r the instructions? i have d daemon tools gadget sidebar, used the virtual drive and it started to install then a small pop up came with d browse button so i changed d J: to G: and it continued installing.  i opened d 2nd iso  file for this part in a seperate virtual drive (G:) and had the 1st iso in d other virtual drive (J:).
did this twice i even re-installed steam.  anything i missed?

btw thanks for ur patience"
,surf3r1,2010-01-29T17:07Z,"Hi! I would like to point out that it s possible to keep default MW2 installation (ie. c:\Program Files\Activision\Modern Warfare 2) and only change ""zerogear.bat""contents (in steam\steamapps\common\zero gear) to point to your MW2 installation directory. In this manner the crack is placed in your MW2 folder."
,surf3r1,2010-01-29T17:17Z,"Also, it's possible to start MW2 from the shortcut on your desktop. It will first log into Steam than automatically run MW2 (saves you the need to double clik one more time on Zero Gear Demo :). It is the sam shortcut you could choose while installing Zero Gear Demo, just renamed. In my case, the field ""Location"" of the shortcut says :   ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe"" -applaunch 18800, and ""Target"":   ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam"""
,redpepper007,2010-01-29T17:28Z,"!!!!! this works well, and this is a lot better that v3 version, because now I dont get ''disconnected from steam'', ''failed to move host'' etc errors :D cool"

@bobo2508: i mean correctly lol. follow the instructions

this error it gived you when there are no file or some file are missing in the folder C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\zero gear\Server

so copy again all the codmw2 files in that folder"
,surf3r1,2010-01-30T18:20Z,">50c3nt
That is not necessary, as I pointed out. There is no logic in your request. If ppl have one folder for all games why would they move MW2 to a  different place if there is no need to do it..."
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-30T18:44Z,"@surf3r1: because i don't want to touch the original installation, and because I not tested out your method, I don't know if it's working or not (theoretically it works but pratically i don't know)"

,Ruffx2,2010-01-31T15:39Z,"hi I was able to host a many player server, but.
In the readme you didnt wrote down, how can i change the game moe to first person, and with the change gametype command I can only change between sd war etc.
please be kind and write down the command how to change to fps. I tried change camera thirdperson  1 but console says its cheat protected.
please help
thx:)"
,Ruffx2,2010-01-31T16:29Z,"ok now I got how to make it first persin sorry:)

so how to separate the teams in stats?"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-31T16:57Z,"@triqvinden: check your hardware requirment, low down the resolution an textures ingame and retry

@Ruffx2: src_thirdperson 0

for different stats do not use the command cg_gametype war/dm etc only, but use the command playlist 0/1/2/3/4 for the different gametype"
,Ruffx2,2010-01-31T17:08Z,thanks man for the help:)
,Ruffx2,2010-01-31T17:20Z,and how to separate teams?
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-01-31T18:34Z,"i don't understand what you mean XD but i think you have to use the command
playlist 1/2/3/etc

then restart the map
map_restart

for tdm use the commands:
playlist 0
map_restart
"
,Ruffx2,2010-01-31T18:55Z,"ok :)
i mean when i type playlist 1 it says its team deathmatch after i restart the map, but it wont separate the players in to 2 teams, everyone shows red, like it would be free for all. 
and i allways restart the map :)"
,Ruffx2,2010-01-31T19:10Z,"so i see now it only changes correctly, after e going out to lobby"
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-02-01T20:13Z,@Ruffx2: yes this is a bug that I have reported in the v2. you have to go to the lobby to fix that
,kgiax,2010-02-01T23:36Z,Do Private Matches/Parties still work with this? I can only seem to join a Steam friend's game if they're already in a public one. Otherwise it won't let either of us.
,kgiax,2010-02-02T06:16Z,Nevermind. Looks like it only happens with one person. They fail to connect with me every time. Any ideas on what they could try?
,Ruffx2,2010-02-02T08:07Z,"Hi so I have an other stupid question.
is there a command, for iw net not to merge lobbyes? "
,Kidking,2010-02-02T08:32Z,"thanks for this awesome release dam glad i didnt buy the game
works like an charm"
,Ruffx2,2010-02-02T09:05Z,"and one more... sorry again.
how to kick player who has space in his name?"
,Ruffx2,2010-02-02T09:49Z,"ok i got that too sorry for spamming your comments thx for all the help

[V],Colombo-bt,2010-02-02T13:09Z,"@kgiax: it's working for someone and not for otherone. they can try to reinstall all, but I'm not sure it works

@Ruffx2: no that I know there are no command for stop merging. sometimes happen that iwnet merge lobbies but it's very rare

the kick player commands are:

- ""status"" -> you will get a list of all the players currently on your server, on the left column you will se a number from 0 to ""max slots of your server""

- have a look on that numer corresponding to the hacker

- type ""tempBanClient #"" substitute # for the hacker's number

- banned lol"

,Plus2dude,2010-02-04T06:42Z,"I really hope you didn't mean the actual mw2 game to copy because i spent half a day trying the other way. If this is actually what we do, The IWD problem is you need to take YOUR MW2 game and put that stuff in it. not the stuff you downloaded ..yet."
[V],Colombo-bt,2010-02-04T13:48Z,"@Plus2dude: read the instructions. you have to install CODMW2, then go to the installation directory and copy all the content of the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 foldenr, and paste it in the folder ""Server"", then you have to copy the content of this torrent in the folder ""common"" and overwrite the existing file"
,Plus2dude,2010-02-04T23:38Z,Yes I know I did it last night. What I meant was the IWD problem is that people think to take the torrent download and put that in first bcause the Mw2 file just like you call it in the instructions

,69MrJack69,2010-02-15T22:16Z,"@abeesh666: Sorry dude, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.  lol"
,abeesh666,2010-02-15T23:49Z,@69MrJack69: Well you did and I hate to say it on such short notice but... NOW YOU CAN'T COME TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY!
,Bobzyman,2010-02-16T18:26Z,hey guys noob question :when ever i join a match from steam friends it loads the actual zero gear game instead of cod when i followed all of 50c3ent's steps help me fast plz
,abeesh666,2010-02-16T22:49Z,"@Bobzyman: If you followed the instructions exactley then it WILL work. However, I would advise you to hold off doing so untill the new crack comes out.
Otherwise you will learn of the injustice of IWNET and soon realize why we all are so anxiously waiting as well. Again, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY UNTILL THE NEW CRACK COMES OUT!"
,Sayaron,2010-02-16T23:28Z,"Hey, 50c3nt. Any news about the crack?"
,HppyLght,2010-02-18T23:15Z,"Hello 50c3nt. Any news on the new crack? Also, just wanted to thank you for uploading these cracks. Worked 100%, no viruses, no bullshit. We're counting on you. :D"
,HppyLght,2010-02-19T02:13Z,Does anyone know about the MP Crack Teknogods are going to release? 
,i4ig0,2010-02-19T10:38Z,"HppyLght,
The Teknogods version won't work on downloaded and cracked version of CoD"
,rockstarnetonline,2010-02-19T18:42Z,"there is a new crack out-
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5376859/Call_Of_Duty_MW2_MultiPlay_crack_19_2_2010_...I dont know if it works,but lets see."
,eKleenex,2010-02-22T23:36Z,When can we expect a new crack released?
[T],SceneRlz,2010-02-25T19:44Z,"this crack doesn't work anymore:
http://i.servut.us/i/badboy_error.png"
[T],SceneRlz,2010-02-25T19:45Z,I got it after steam update...
,Sayaron,2010-03-01T16:19Z,"Allright, this has been dead for too long. Soon a month. So I think there wont come any new version of this crack. Seems 50c3nt gave up"
,reinier145,2010-03-01T17:16Z,"I think that it will take very long for the new crack
Steam really did it this time!"
,Sayaron,2010-03-01T19:14Z,"Not steam, its IWnet that did it"
,chaosjacky,2010-03-02T18:29Z,"does the pirate bay still work ? I heard it has stopped =(
that would explain why 50c3nt or others aren't uploading any more cracks..."
,lilsniff,2010-03-02T18:40Z,"The Pirate Bay will never shut down or remove any files, as they mention them selves on this site. 

So no, TPB is not shut down ;) 
(they have some downtimes here and there but nothing to worry about :) )"
,i4ig0,2010-03-03T01:22Z,"I bought the game, 'cause I couldn't wait for a new crack =) "
,Sayaron,2010-03-03T15:46Z,This new update totaly screwed it up for everybody. Looks like I gotta buy the game
,eKleenex,2010-03-03T18:38Z,"Just wait a week or so, Teknogods release is almost ready. And for the idiots who think it wont work with our pirated versions. You are right and wrong, it technically wont work on release, but it will be cracked within 24 hours. So don't conform, wait for the loader."
,kab963,2010-03-04T00:26Z,iwnet_invalidversion................ dangit....
,i4ig0,2010-03-04T23:27Z,"Goddamn, it was the most stupid decision to buy this fucking game with crashes, lags, steam which erases all my saves and now I've got a problem with this fuckin steam cloud and the game doesn't want to launch and to reinstall =(( I think that I'll continue to play in pirated version, when the new crack'll come out or I'll use Teknogods' mod"
,Sayaron,2010-03-06T00:02Z,"i4ig0, complain to steam. If that dont work, sue them"
,HppyLght,2010-03-06T01:43Z,"@50c3nt PLEASE, can we at least have an update on the new crack?? DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING? ARE YOU WORKING ON ONE? DO YOU KNOW WHEN ONE WILL BE RELEASED? Thanks again for uploading these cracks though. It's been a fucking month and I'm probably going to stop waiting and delete MW2."
,Drebin891,2010-03-12T08:53Z,"i think that we won't have any other crack from 50c3nt for a while...he's italian and in italy the access to ""the pirate bay"" has been blocked...=("
,Andrath,2010-03-12T17:54Z,that's not true! i'm italian and i can get in this site by other urls ^^
,Drebin891,2010-03-13T13:25Z,"i'm italian too :P

but if he isn't using or he simply doesn't want to use other urls he won't be able to connect...

and if he isn't uploading other torrents i think he doesn't want to do that =("
,Geezma,2010-03-14T13:04Z,"Man, i want to play this game so bad :("
,PoshRocks,2010-05-27T20:59Z,hey has anyone tried this?
