The track was produced by hit-maker and longtime Spears collaborator Max Martin, who also produced "... Baby One More Time," and its subject matter â€” which appears to be about loving multiple people at one time â€” is sure to cause a stir. Of course, Spears has been causing that kind of stir since she dressed in a sexy school-girl uniform for the "... Baby One More Time" video.

The song, which is posted on New York radio station Z-100's Web site, is a catchy dance track with provocative lyrics, such as, "1, 2, 3/ Not only you and me/ Got 180 degrees/ And I'm caught in between." The chorus also mentions "Peter, Paul and Mary," which would seem to be an out-of-left-field reference to the '60s folk act.
