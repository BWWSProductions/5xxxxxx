Webcast recording of the opening girls race of the 2010 Norwegian XC ski Championships between ski clubs all over Norway.  It was also used to make final squad selections for those trying to make the team being sent to the upcoming Vancouver Olympics.  If only our (US) nationals had this kind of passion and TV coverage!  Maybe some decade?? Ha Ha. 

More races to be upped if this torrent works. Since it's web stream recording, don't expect perfect motion capture especially with lots of skiers close up.
