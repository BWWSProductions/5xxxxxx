,_Chambers_,2010-07-07T14:14Z,"also, darkspade8 if you manage to read this, then download vlc media player
-> load up the film once its downloaded
-> go to original downloaded folder (Thirst)
-> subtitles folder
-> drag (eng or whatever language you need) and drop into the video player. After a few seconds it should work.

Voila!"

Anyone knows where we can get decent subtitles? I couldn't find anyone better at opensubtitles.org..."

I proceeded to try playing it any ways and it said that it may not be supported and to go to the support section of Xbox.com. this is what the 360 supports.

Are you daft? You do realize that the subs provided for you are the ones that came from the Blu-ray disc... Also if you watch this on Netflix with the hard coded subs, they're the exact same thing. So I believe that the only Amateur here here is you. It's almost common sense that it's the original sub file from the disc when it's a Blu-ray rip..."
,fwape1,2012-04-29T20:22Z,It's says spoken language but it doesn't seem to be the case. When playing this in VLC both languages say english but they are actually both korean. can i get the english translation for this movie anywhere?
