This is one of a few Broke Straight Boys videos I will be uploading torrents for.

I'll seed pretty often.

These are my first attempts at capturing Streaming video. They're all being captured with WM Capture.

On playback, they seem to be going a bit fast. It's just a little noticeable. Audio is fine as far as I can tell. Also they've been copying small, but the resolution remains when expanded.

Try reducing your media players speed settings if the speed bothers you.



Thanks and please seed! Let's get these out there!

Feedback appreciated! I'd like to expand and improve my torrents!
