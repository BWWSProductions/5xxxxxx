,MrGoy,2011-08-17T02:28Z,"All right, I was wrong. Everything is working fine. I didnt notice the 'patch' folder.

1 - install the game
2 - apply the patch
3 - put the map pack into the hard drive (if it is not already)
4 - extract the files and wait for the finish of the installation.

And it's done."
