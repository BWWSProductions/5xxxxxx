The songs "Country Girl" and "Slipping Away" make their debut on official live releases.

The CD was released only as a digipak, featuring a mini reproduction of a tour programme. Although there is a UK tour progamme for the Mob Rules dates, the one included with this release is actually that for the January 1981 UK dates, which were part of the Heaven and Hell tour. The cover photo is also from the Heaven and Hell tour.
