,g0d,2010-01-29T22:44Z,"no, this is the one with wolverine. afaik, hugh jackman isn't even an x-man silly. the tip-off... he has a full name like a real person. most x-men don't, just their pussy bios in marvel encyclopedias for dickless fanboys.
example:
Real Name: Professor Charles Dingus Xavier
Mutant Name:Wheels, Gramps, Baldy, and Mandingo"
