It might be easy for modern audiences to dismiss Psycho; it's been followed by so many poor imitators, today's viewer may lack the patience for the original. And if you're looking for just wall-to-wall cheap scares, look elsewhere. Psycho is a slow burn, the kind of film that takes its time and invests in its characters, carefully avoiding any superfluous  ""it's only a cat"" startles. When the violence does come, it's jarring, even unsettling. Bernard Herrmann's score (using only strings) is so masterful, we quickly forget how shamelessly it has been copied over the years for the sake of lesser films. The film's only weakness is its unnecessary coda. But even then, Hitchcock leaves us with a haunting image that we won't soon forget. "
