My comp crashed, twice. Just because I tried to move the extracted files. I could not even delete the files normally, had to unlock and delete one by one with IObit 360. Don't know whats going on here, but my system rarely crashes, let alone twice in less than 5 minutes. So unless anyone has an viable explanation for this, I would advise against dl this torrent."

If you think you can do better, write your own blog and post your own torrent.

For those interested, there's been an update to the guide and the Software Suite. Check out this torrent:
