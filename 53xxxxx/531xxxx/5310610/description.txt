Filmmaker Michael Moore joins us for a wide-ranging interview about Haiti, the Supreme Court decision on corporate campaign financing, President Obamaâ€™s first year in office, the Democrats, and much more. â€œThe Democrats] donâ€™t have the guts. They donâ€™t have the courage of their own convictions. Theyâ€™re disgusting. Iâ€™m embarrassed,â€ Moore says. â€œI want really nothing to do with them. And if they donâ€™t find their spine, well, theyâ€™re in for a huge surprise in November.â€
