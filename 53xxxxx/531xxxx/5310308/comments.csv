,kfitz9,2010-01-26T23:01Z,"I don't want to get into a political argument but i think De Valera was right to do what he did! The movie makes him look a lot lot worse than he actually was!

Anyway, Don't forget to seed for a while after you download so we can try and get some Irish banter into the bloodstream of the rest of the world!"
,partchimp,2010-04-20T20:54Z,"Great film, but it couldn't possibly have made De Valera look any worse than he actually was...
The man was a cowardly pawn of the catholic church who ran scared and sent Collins in his place when he realised that compromise would have to be made.
The constitution he drew up when he finally came to power in the 30s helped create an Irish state and society which would be held back the shackles of catholicism for over half a century"
