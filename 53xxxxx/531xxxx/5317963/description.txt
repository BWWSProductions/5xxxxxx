Rhoda Scott - 10 Albums - Jazz Organ

Rhoda Scott (born July 3, 1938, Dorothy, New Jersey) spent much of her childhood in New Jersey, where she learned to play organ in the churches where her father served. Soon she was serving frequently as organist for youth and gospel choirs at her father's and other churches. Scott later studied classical piano, but she concentrated on the organ, eventually earning a Masters' degree in music theory from the Manhattan School of Music.

Choosing as her instrument the Hammond organ, she became an eminent jazz musician and is considered to be among the top jazz organists.

In 1967 Scott moved to France, where she has since spent most of her career.

In this collection you will find Rhoda Scott in both studio and live small band settings (duo or trio), except for 'In New York' where she performs with Thad Jones & Mel Lewis Orchestra.
