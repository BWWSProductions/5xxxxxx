StudioTax can handle most of the tax situations. However, the 2008 and 2009 version do not handle the following form:


? Form T1273 STATEMENT A - Harmonized CAIS Program Information and Statement of Farming Activities for Individuals;

Please note that the Quebec provincial tax is not yet supported. This does not prevent you from using Netfile to file your federal tax."
