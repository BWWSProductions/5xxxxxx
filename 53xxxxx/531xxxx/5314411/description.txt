This four-part series deals with the mass migration of Germanic tribes at the very beginning of European history, while Ancient Rome raced towards inevitable collapse and a new political centre developed in Northwest Europe. This period, from the invasion of the Huns in 375 to the conquest of Italy by the Lombards in 568, is one of the most fascinating, significant and complex epochs in history.

A close look at the Limes, the wall that the Romans built from the Danube across to the Rhine to regulate access to the Roman Empire. Only those members of the Germanic tribes who came to barter meat for Roman goods such as precious metals, Roman tableware, or jewellery - all of which were in great demand with the 'barbarians' - were allowed to pass The program emphasises the continuity, rather the conflict, in this Roman-Germanic transition.
