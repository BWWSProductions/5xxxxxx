,TheAwesome2012,2010-01-27T23:16Z,"Shotgun_navi

This technically isn't a DvDrip but a R5 copy which is identical in picture quality but you do get the odd copy floating around that have audio that is taken from inside a cinema theatre or audio that is 'line' which is 99'9% DvD quality but again there is the chance that the audio can go off sync on some copies rendering it a waste of your time downloading.

However I haven't seen this copy nor I intend to see this movie in actual fact but as Knock pointed out this is highly going to be R5 Line this should be 99.9% DvD quality in identical providing it isn't the first release of the R5 standard of this movie which WAS rendered unwatchable due to it being out of sync with audio but i'm sure LW has done his homework and watched it all the way through to spot check it for mistakes :)"
,XoLWoX,2010-01-27T23:42Z,my copy is perfect not out of sync not noirs and has great audio
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-01-28T00:02Z,"Question. Why is it when I use ConvertXToDVD on this file and try to make it a NTSC the end result is the audio is going faster than the video? Please give me feedback on one of my uploads. Thank you. +1

Audio: 9
Video: 9"
,XoLWoX,2010-01-28T00:25Z,dont know i use a divx dvd player or my xbox360 to play avi or mp4 movies that way i can put up to 6 movies on one 4.7gb dvd much better
,davugeen,2010-01-28T20:00Z,Thank You
,XoLWoX,2010-01-28T21:29Z,they are labeled correctly if you were fucking smart you would know that 2009 is when the movie hit theaters which isnt corrent information for the title of the torrent 2010 is when the r5-dvdrip was made stop making yourself look stupid knock just give up..........IF i was doing somthing wrong i would have gotten my skull back
[T],Emery2010,2010-01-29T06:08Z,lmfao does that explain why every single big encode labeled this correctly R5 Line 2009 ??? weird as fuck how that can happen haha u were banned at et and 1337x for this u suck dick
[T],Emery2010,2010-01-29T06:27Z,also u stole my encode of surrogates so go fuck urself

Thanks XoLWoX great upload."
[T],Emery2010,2010-01-29T06:45Z,"lmao and now uve been at Extratorrent
in ur fucking face!
get lost now from everywhere....
no such thing as an R5-DVDRip 
its either one or the other
and the movie was created and released in 2009
thats what the release date should be
thats what the other 50000000 people put it
plus this loooks like noir's release"
[T],Emery2010,2010-01-29T06:48Z,"how do u manage to get same QF and bitrate as noirs?
U should never get the same bitrate or QF unless u cheated and re-labeled noirs asshole"
,XoLWoX,2010-01-29T13:44Z,whatever emery you watch youself before you get banned here
[T],Emery2010,2010-01-29T18:30Z,"dude i could careless if i get banned here, i got about 5000 other sites i could upload on...im just telling the truth..."
,lokiklown,2010-02-02T12:59Z,"LW:

I have downloaded a couple things you have uploaded, so dont take this the wrong way. The year that goes in the title really should be the year the movie was released not the year you ripped the movie. You could buy a movie from 1985 that in 2010 has a remake of the movie out and if you upload the 1985 movie with the title 2010 people are gonna think they are getting the new one.

Im not being stupid or harsh about it, cause honestly I take the 2 seconds before I download to make sure im getting what i want so i dont waste my time, but some other lazy people will not and get all butt hurt when they get the wrong copy cause they dont wanna take that little bit of time to figure it out"

,Superman169,2010-02-05T10:18Z,"Thank you to all the uploaders




you guys are great"
,5305126,2010-02-06T03:34Z,"wow what a bunch of kids you are. honestly grow up man, you both should be banned for causing a disterbance.  Big whoop if he named the title different, im sure hes not the only one.  Everybody goes by something different cause if it was the same its be boring.   Im downloading now then watching i'll comment back with the results.

,VeganSausage,2010-02-18T06:26Z,"Sorry im new to this but from other posts ive read about the place, my understanding is that an R5 is a dvdrip from a cheap dvd released in Region5 (russia or ukraine or some shit), with an english audio tacked on over the foreign stuff, most likely source for audio being a cimena.

Is this a correct description of R5? "
