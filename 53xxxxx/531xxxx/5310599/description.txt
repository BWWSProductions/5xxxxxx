The Rhythm Messiahs' third album "Daymare" charts a days' progress, from early morning, on into evening, and through dreamland into the next morning.  Although primarily instrumental electronica, "Daymare" resists categorization, often drifting from trip-hop to dance, from cheery to dreary, from light to dark.  The Rhythm Messiahs is the music project of multi-medium artist and 24/7 thought broadcaster J.D. Casten (also with the help of a dozen friends).  Highlighted tracks include "Almost Lunch," "Ghost In The Clock," and "Wet Signals Ophelia."
