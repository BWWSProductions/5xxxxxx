No KEY no play"
,RDCMrT,2010-01-28T23:51Z,"@Stlouiscowboys,

Read the FUCKING subscription, u think they make it 4 fun !!! Dumbass !!"
,Stlouiscowboys,2010-01-29T00:16Z,"RDMC..  I thought I did read the description.  I don't know if it was edited since I started the DL, but it was just the closed beta and under parts that were there.  

Whats the point of torrenting this if you need a key?  If you get the key from steam or d2d you get a much better DL speed.  "
,uncle_adolf88,2010-01-29T00:20Z,"i have the key. it was 5-10minutes minutes (i hope) worth trying. now downloading, but the torrent transfer isn't enough when you have the key and from offical website it's going 10x faster.

this site should help you. 40min left"
,uncle_adolf88,2010-01-29T00:49Z,"The number of keys is limited!
We currently have 0 keys left.

More keys will be available Friday 12:00 CET
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
that's sad. good luck people"
,KeiKun83,2010-01-29T05:00Z,"@Stlouiscowboys:

The point is that downloading this via torrent is faster than via any website at the moment for ppl like me who have a key, mate. =)
Therefore, very much appreciated .BONE.; although I used an earler torrent to download the beta."
