Product Description:
The follow-up to Trauma Center - Under the Knife, this is the first surgical video game for the Nintendo Wii. Sure, we've all imagined what it would be like to become a doctor. Years of medical school, residency, and clinic duty eventually pay off in a rewarding position saving people's lives. Or, you could skip all that and just put in a few hours after dinner.
The critically acclaimed medical drama simulation is making a house call on your Wii! Dr. Derek Stiles is back, but he's not the only surgeon on call?a new player joins the team, bringing along everything the doctor ordered: difficulty modes, new surgical implements like the defibrillator, and an exciting never-before-seen conclusion. So what are you waiting for? If one dose of Trauma Center wasn't enough, it's time you got a Second Opinion!
