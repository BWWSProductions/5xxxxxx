Exposed By Observers New EP 

Who are they?

Hi, is this thing on?
We are Exposed By Observers.
We use cheap samples,clicks,bleeps,beeps and guitar riffs.
We play sonic punk with a digital edge so as to rape the listenerâ€™s ears.
We are rasmio-late night bath singer, evilplaymobils-toilette synth player, stratos-bedroom guitarist.
Inspired from Nite Versions, Myths of the Near Future, Sabotage, Trainspotting, Catan, we are almost celebrities, weekend rockstars and bedroom djs.
Thank you for your attention.
