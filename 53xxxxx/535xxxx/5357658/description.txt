Vagif Mustafa-zadeh - Dushunce
MP3 @ 320 kbps + scans


I just discovered this pianist little more than a week ago and was completely taken aghast by his brilliant fusion of modern jazz and oriental tradition. His piano sounds like like a bluesy version of turkish zantuuri, or eastern european cymbalum. His music will appeal equally to jazz aficionados and fans of eastern/oriental ethnic music.

You can read more about him and listen to some previews of his music here:

I found this disc in lossless format, but analysing the flac files they turned out to be fake (conversions from mp3), so I decided to upload the lossy version. If someone has, or know where to find, a lossless rip - please share.
