Some of these are fine (192kbs). and some are REALLY BAD! (still 192kbs, but more like data corruption)

Listen e.g. to the ""Now And Then Greatest Hits 1964-2004"". The Right channel is scrambled! It sounds like it has been recorded through an analog channel with a loose connection or similar (most easily heard if you shift between only hearing left or right channel - you might not immediately notice if you are not wearing headphones).

On another one of the albums there were digital errors in (a few short, random burst like ""pfft"" during playback - also easily missed if just ""browsing"" through the songs). It were in the first two songs so I deleted  the album and forgot the name of the folder.

I haven't listened to all of them, but some of the albums seem alright - I would say very best 1983 is ok - as far as I've been able to hear."
,nil7,2011-04-23T11:55Z,"... and I can add: ""The New World in the Morning"" album (128kbs): Clipping is off the scale!

This adds an extremely amount of crackling noise to his voice, just listen to the first song on the album... I opened the song in Audacity and did an Analyze->Find Clipping (default values) and it confirmed: Clipping all over the song. That albums has been ""gained up"" beyond what the encoder could handle.

... I have to conclude: Either the ripper is REALLY incompetent, or he has deliberately damaged the songs. Considering the weird errors (like the left-right error, which doesn't happens if you are just a ""newbie playing with the encoding settings"")

@flitigalisa - I assume you've just compiled this list from different sources. In the future I recommend screening the music with some skepticism :-) But despite that I still thank you for the effort! :-)  I found good quality versions of the songs I was looking for."
