To say that the graphical imagery in video games is very important to the
games industry is a bit of an understatement. The graphics in games are
so important that they often can make or break a gameâ€™s success. It is true
that all other aspects of a game are important, but the visuals are at times
the main selling point along with game play, brand recognition, and so
forth. This has been true for a long time in the games industry, where 3D
games have been known for their visuals.

In this book, we will examine many graphical techniques that are used
in the games industry to create cutting-edge, modern applications. The
graphics used in games are real-time computer graphics. This means a lot of
the information discussed in this book also applies to other graphicalrelated
industries that use either real-time or non-real-time graphics, but
our focus will be primarily on video games. Since this book focuses on
game graphics, we will examine many different real-time techniques as
well as some non-real-time techniques that can be preprocessed and used
in games, which is very common in video games today.

By the time you reach the end of this book, you will have a firm understanding
of many of the more popular effects and techniques used in
modern video games and how to implement them. This book discusses a
lot of theory and makes heavy use of both pseudo code and illustrations
to help make it easier for you to learn the information regardless of what
programming language, graphical tools, and so on you choose to use.
There will also be C++ code samples throughout this book, but the information
provided is generally not specific to any one language or tool.
