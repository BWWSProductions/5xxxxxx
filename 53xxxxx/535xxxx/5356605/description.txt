"Two Is Better Than One" is the title of a song written by Martin Johnson. It was recorded by Boston alternative rock group Boys Like Girls. It is included on their second studio album Love Drunk, which was released in 2009. The song is the second official single from the album. It features Taylor Swift, the first time that the country pop artist has been involved in a hit single as a featured rather than main artist.

Due to both of their rising popularity, the song has become Boys Like Girls' third, and second consecutive, Top 40 single on the Billboard Hot 100. Also, it gave Swift her twenty-first Top 40 on that chart. For the chart week of January 9, 2010, the song became Boys Like Girls' first Top 20 single on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their biggest to date, and Swift's eleventh Top 20 single.
