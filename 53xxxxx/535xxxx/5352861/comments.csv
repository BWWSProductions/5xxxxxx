,Themankitten,2010-02-16T18:06Z,"Ok, Im having a problem I hope someone can help me with. I'll provide as much detail as i can;

1) I downloaded the torrent
2) Extracted the iso
3) Burned the iso to a DVD+RW with Alchohol 120%

This is where It will not work for me.

4) Shut down computer and booted from CD, I got this;

No boot device availible, press ENTER to retry. 


What do I do? Its obviously not sensing the iso as bootable, any ideas how I can fix?"
,phatjesus,2010-02-16T21:15Z,"I'm having some trouble with this right now.  I can get through the first part of installation, but when the computer reboots it doesn't detect anything.  Any ideas?"

,ZXY80,2010-02-18T18:49Z,"DO NOT EXTRACT THE ISO FILE !
Burn directly to dvd !
Nice work again from AiTB :D"
,basslion,2010-02-19T10:56Z,"I burned iso to DVD, installed fine except during finalizing it opened cmd.exe in dos window and kept trying to do something on the DVD, then an error screen came up saying installation failed. i closed the screen and rebooted and it loads up fine and everything is working. However if i go check my system in control panel it says 30 days left and activation required. It did ask for Product Key during install and i just clicked Next.

What gives?"
,xadious,2010-02-21T03:37Z,"Installed great, thanks.

For those having problems getting it to recognise the dvd: During boot, you need to press the button on your keyboard that gets the menu up that lets you choose which harddrive/dvd to boot from, on my computer it was f8, kept pressing it, then the menu popped up, and selected for it to run from the dvdrom, and installed great.

Not sure why the dvd doesn't get recognised on it's own, my pc is very new (i5), oh well, installed great in the end.

Thanks."

Different keys for differnt systems.. xD"
,xadious,2010-03-07T07:33Z,"Looks like this is only valid for 30 days as it's counting down.

Where can i get a serial from? I'm seeing some Keygens around, but are there legit ones? The one i downloaded turned out to be a virus."
,Kashmar79,2010-03-09T00:39Z,"Just installed this in a VirtualBox and updated it via Windows Update.
No sign of any 30-day issue or the WAT-update in Windows Update."

,gbroman,2010-03-12T04:55Z,"Tell me please, what is this version W7 Ultimate x64 INTEGRATED February 2010 OEM.DV....INTEGRATED with WHAT? SP1.....Vista.....XP......???
I have downloaded the torrent, burned it to dvd disc using ImageBurn and tried to get it to work, to INSTAL, and it won't.
Try to load from EVD drive with open W7 Ultimate X86 as a dual boot system and load to a partition of Master Sata2 HDD and get the expected UAC window message asking if I ""want to allow this program to make changes to my computer"". The program is named "" sperr.exe""  Click Yes and then get message telling me that I can't upgrade from the system I have to this one.
What the hell!! I don't want to UPGRADE, I want to instal this X64 to a partition of the Master / Prumary HDD. Don't get that option, and Dual/ Multi boting windows OS's is possible. W7 X64 can be Dual booted with W7 X86 as long as X86 is the first OS installed. It doesn't have to be the ""Sytem' OS to boot from.
And as for "" sperr.exe"".....go google it, its Vista.
Yeah yeah, W7 OS is Vista based. I've seen it before and it is usually the next step to this:

The inserted disc in the DVD drive is labeled ""GRMCULXFRER_EN_DVD""

Double click the DVD RW Drive icon with the disc in drive and get a UAC window asking if I want to allow this program from an unknown publisher to make changes to this computer?

Program name: sperr32.exe
Publisher: Unknown
File origin: CD/DVD drive
For the hell of it I Googled GRMCULXFRER_EN_DVD and got the following from the link below:

http://www.google.co.nz/search?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&channel=s&hl=en&source=hp&q=GRMCULXFRER_EN_DVD&meta=&btnG=Google+Search
               ........................................................
Now here is my beef with this torrent I have just d=loaded:-
I set the DVD drive as First boot device, insert the DVD disc into the optical drive, when asked, Ipress any key to Boot from CD/DVD and off goes the initial instal of ""Loading Setup files""
Once that has completed and the gray staus bar has faded out, I'm looking at a Black screen.
Now to be fair, I give things a few moments to begin the ""Installing Windows"" procedure's. Well when the 'moment' has become 25minutes and I'm still sitting staring at a BLACK screen I begin to take liberties and decide that the Torrent I have is Pukaru ( NZ Maori for Stuffed)
Also to be fair, I have d-loaded this W7X64 and W7X86 + X64, seven times and not one of them will work. Same damn problem eveytime apart from one that does instal but just sits the pulsing the W7 Icon and not opening. Reason for that is the instal doesn't complete the "" Finishing Installation"" step. The computer reboots before the staus bar has fully reached 100%.
This torrent don't even do that, for me.......as I said, once its loaded the ""Temporary files"", it goes nowhere.
Anyone got any ideas why this happening to me or had similar experience with this torrent? Let me know please.
The problem is not my computer.I'm running Gigabyte GA M68SM-S2L motherboard, AMD Athlon II X4 630 2.8GHz CPU, 4GB A-Data PC2 6400 Dual channel RAM, Pioneer DVD RW D112 ATA optical drive and a 160GB Seagate Barracuda Sata2 HDD, 1TB Seagate Barracuda Sata2 slave, 2x1TB Seagate expansion drives and a Gigabyte Nividia GeForce 7300GS Vid card. Its all 64 BIT compatible.
Any ideas would help thanks.....oh, and....what is Integrated mean per this torrent. Far as I know W7 service packs haven't been released yet.Correct me if I'm wrong, please.

At the finalizing stage, a DOS window opens and it says "" Installation failed, Press any key to exit"". And may be because of that this copy of windows 7 installs as a 30 day trial...
