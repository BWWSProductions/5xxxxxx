The album was originally released in a gatefold-sleeve, opening in the vertical rather than the customary horizontal axis. The lyrics were printed on the LP liner. The artwork was licensed from artist Chris Achilleos, although there seems to have been some alteration to the bodice; the breasts are not as exposed in the original. Whether this was done by Achilleos himself, or even with his approval, is currently unclear. Achilleos' website lists the original artwork as missing.
