Sophia Loren, complete with blackface and an Afro, came to international acclaim in this fairly literal version of the Giuseppe Verdi opera. Loren  (with singing dubbed by Renata Tebaldi) portrays the title character, an Ethiopian slave owned by Amneris (Lois Maxwell), the daughter of the Egyptian king. Aida's romantic heart is her weakness, as she must choose between loyalty to her conquered race and romance with Radames (Luciano della Marra), an officer of the Egyptian army. Director Clemente Fracassi gets a bit carried away with epic splendor and the opulent color format, but fans of Loren  and opera novices should find the film rewarding. Despite Loren's lauded performance, the role of Aida was originally intended for Gina Lollobrigida.
