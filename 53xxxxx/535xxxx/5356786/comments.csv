Also, I know you've been having trouble with British tv programmes. Does this mean you will not be able to upload the new series of Doctor Who and Ashes to Ashes? They both begin in March I think. Anyway thanks so much either way."
,kayslay,2010-02-12T11:54Z,can u encode Storm Warriors 2 please?
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-12T12:02Z,"@mattbdon: Yes, unfortunately for the people all around the world great-minds of British TV and Tavistock have imagined that people from Zanzibar, Myanmar or India should pay iPlayer and similar on-line players for really symbolic price of their monthly income.
Unfortunately, I am not obligated by US or UK laws, and for sure, at my discretion, I intend to follow trough at least Ashes to ashes (if I don't die meanwhile).
I'll try to find old series you looking for."

Cheers

[V],twentyforty,2010-02-12T15:29Z,"Thanks Jon, lilars and houruoha.

@ralphvin: I used 2.0 for last six months. Now I use 2.1... Of course, it is the best torrent program in general. 2.0 and PeerBlock together use 0.64 % of Win resources - Vuze drags whole Java and need 4.81%... so, especially now when 2.0 is released, anyone should use it and forget about other, heavy, stupid and obsolete programs and derivatives."
