,lazyjoe7565,2010-02-10T09:38Z,"FSSR.Keyno 
128 is an okay rate. it isn't high but it also isn't low it is like in between "
,razzell2,2010-04-02T04:27Z,"320 is the best rate, give you a better quality sound, but 128 not bad. Ive seen 96kbs and less, on limewire, etc.
Thanks for this up, lazyjoe. Not enough Santana on p2p!"
,dherrera56,2011-01-02T02:03Z,"Whatever the rate is, you're the man. Thanks for the effort."
,sittinginabunker,2011-08-09T00:14Z,"128 is all you really need, and it will save you space too. if you want to hear full quallity i guess you would need to have no neighbors and have a good cd player and the original cd"
