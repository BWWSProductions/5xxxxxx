,Gerard5678,2010-02-19T12:15Z,I would love to complete the torrent
,meXme,2010-04-05T21:17Z,Will be seeding again soon. Computer died while I was uploading the torrent. Almost fixed now (at last). Will finish uploading when everythings working properly.
,meXme,2010-04-06T00:22Z,"Ok I'm seeding again. My computer broke after I had uploaded 86.7% of the film. After a long hiatus all is well again, and so I am finishing what I started. As this torrent has become rather unbalance it would be really apreciated if everyone would SEED GENEROUSLY, to return to health. Thanks in advance. MEXME. "
