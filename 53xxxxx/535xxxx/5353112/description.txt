Game description:

Set approximately 10 years after the events of the original BioShock, the halls of Rapture once again echo with sins of the past. Along the Atlantic coastline, a monster has been snatching little girls and bringing them back to the undersea city of Rapture. You are the very first Big Daddy as you travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city, chasing an unseen foe in search of answers and your own survival. 

* Online and offline multiplayer modes including: Free-For-All, and Team Death Match and more.
* Return to the underwater city of Rapture where now the â€˜The Big Sisterâ€™ is the toughest creature around.
* Play as the original the Big Daddy as you harness raw strength to battle RaptureÂ¿s most feared denizens as you battle powerful new enemies.
* New game mechanics including the ability to wield plasmids and weapons simultaneously; flashback missions detailing how you became the Big Daddy; the ability to walk outside the airlocks of Rapture to discover new play areas, and many more.
* New game environments including Fontaine Futuristics, headquarters of Fontaineâ€™s business empire and the Kashmir Restaurant.
