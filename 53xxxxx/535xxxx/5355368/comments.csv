,gibbonsjm,2010-02-22T13:56Z,i'm getting an unspecified error after starting the program any ideas? 
,dvldog,2010-02-23T00:30Z,"please help installation  went fine but wen i start the game it says ""Unspecified error."""
,fkmontanari,2010-03-03T13:37Z,"more than 200 seeders and just 3 comments, and 2 saying they couldnt play it!"
,sadee23,2010-03-03T18:16Z,"i have followed the instructions but after i've burnt it into 4cds and i put the 1st cd, i got the message- wrong disc inserted, please insert the original ""the sims 2 deluxe"" cd/dvd. PLEASE HELP ME OUT"
,fkmontanari,2010-03-04T00:12Z,"you dont need really to burn those cds, just mount them. but after i followed all the instructions (step 1 and 2) i couldnt play it, dont remember the message. maybe cos im using windows 7 x64, dont know."
,fkmontanari,2010-03-04T23:03Z,this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3258839/The_Sims_2 is working perfectly
,afritchie,2010-03-10T01:38Z,"Quick question..downloaded it and everything followed the steps yet when i click on the Sims Icon, it says I need to insert the right disk, well I've tried mounting all 4 CD's including MDF file in the instructions yet nothing works...could someone help me out please? Thanks"
,Cobra_Vorhees,2010-03-18T03:16Z,"Alright heres what I say to you guys. Use DAEMON Tools Lite not Alcohol 120%.
Follow the disk mounting stuff and your all set. After it finishes you need to install the crack file to the game. Witch is usually located in the TSBin folder of the game folder. Was that so hard? No. Exactly. If you get the nocd crack find the Build Fix if you can't build. :)
(If this doesn't help send me an e-mail)"
,Cobra_Vorhees,2010-03-18T03:17Z,and im guessing im on the wrong torrent. Oh well. Find the crack follow these instructions and your set. :)
,dvldog,2010-03-21T13:34Z,"I tried again using Daemon tools lite it didnt give me the Unspecified error, but it did say that the sims 2 body shop is open. Please close sims 2 body shop and try again or something around those lines. Well I restarted my laptop and I used daemon tools lite for the mdf and now its giving me the unspecified error"
,raycycle93,2010-04-03T09:43Z,"i cant play it..

,akitol,2010-05-02T00:07Z,"I registered on this site just to comment on this one torrent.....

First off anybody who says it doesn't work isn't following the directions exactly. its not even hard to install. 

btw if your running on vista make sure after the installation when you click on the shortcut you ""right click as administrator""...always do this is your running on vista thats why you get the ""unspecified error"" when you dont

game works perfectly...everything is great....fast installation...great game and a big thanks to the uploader!

its nice when there's a torrent that is 100% clean and 100% works

thanks a lot really ^^"
,aymen94,2010-05-02T20:50Z,"Sims2_1.mdf...........how does a .dmf file work, using daemon toolls or what


and what is this file----------Sims 2 Patch "
,dudeperfect,2010-05-07T02:45Z,"guys this is very simple...
all you need is Daemon Tools Lite and PowerIso.
once its done dling. simply extract the 4 iso file onto your desktop. once thats done, open up DMon tools and right click the little icon in your task bar (bottom right). then click virtual cd rom and mount the first iso. when it asks for disc 2, go back and mount the 2nd iso, then the third, etc... very easy guys. worked perfectly for me."
,jags73in,2010-05-07T21:13Z,first no need to burn CD's use daemon tools or anything to mount...second error comes even when u do all as said...that happened with me when i was deleting shortcut icon on desktop b4 making another shortcut..i.e make new shortcut as step2 say and then delete the old desktop shortcut...it worked for me...gr8 work thnx AZGT
,mintfresh,2010-05-17T06:11Z,Works smooth... :)

,xerokarl,2010-06-21T14:37Z,how to seed?
,paraskevas1996,2010-06-26T16:54Z,I WILL SEED IF THE GAME WORKS!
,supanut,2010-06-29T12:20Z,"More than 200 seeders but downloading at around 20 kb/s?
Seed the fuck up! Let me finish this download before Saturday! Make me achieve 100 kb/s!"
,supanut,2010-07-01T12:27Z,I think those of you that didn't burn disks is stupid...you must burn the disk for it to work...I hadn't try it yet...but I think real ones never work through mount...because it didn't count virtual drive as a real CDROM...it may work on Windows 7 if you run it in compatibility mode (right-click on the icon then properties then compatibility tab then run it in Windows XP mode) and it should work...if it didn't then format and downgrade to XP...Windows 7 sucks...as well as Office 2010...new os doesn't mean better...remember that...
,supanut,2010-07-02T13:26Z,"Sorry to multi-post, but I had tried it today and it works in VMware Workstation W/XPSP3! You don't even need a crack, you just need to insert disk1 to play.
So...for those of you that are looking for cracks...you guys are stupid..."
,bjaern_89,2010-07-07T17:18Z,"Congratz', you've found the most retarded way to crack a game... worthless :/"
