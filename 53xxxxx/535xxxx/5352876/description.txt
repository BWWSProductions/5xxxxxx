If your into to-do lists then this one is definitely for you!

OmniFocus is designed to quickly capture your thoughts and allow you to store, manage, and process them into actionable to-do items. Perfect for the Getting Things DoneÂ® system, but flexible enough for any task management style, OmniFocus helps you work smarter by giving you powerful tools for staying on top of all the things you need to do.
Sync!

You canâ€™t accomplish your goals if you donâ€™t have them with you. OmniFocus synchronizes your task database with a server or disk, so that all of your Macs, your iPhone, and your iPod Touch are up-to-date. Sync over your local network using Bonjour, through the cloud using MobileMe or any standard WebDAV server, or even with something as simple as a USB drive.
Capture

Quickly and easily record all your miscellaneous to-dos, and store items in your inbox until youâ€™re ready to process and organize them. Capture info on the fly with the quick entry panel, accessible via keyboard shortcut from virtually any application. Sync with OmniFocus for iPhone (available on the iPhone App Store) in order to have access to your information wherever you are.
Define

Transform all your tasks into actionable next steps by assigning them to projects and contexts. Create start and due dates, time estimates, and task recurrence schedules, and let OmniFocus do the work of remembering everything thatâ€™s on your plate.
Organize

Use the powerful contexts feature in OmniFocus to categorize actions by work mode. When youâ€™re ready to sit down and make some calls, just click on the Phone context in your OmniFocus document in order to see all the phone-related tasks you have.
Review

Filter and sort actions with the click of a button. Unlike other task management solutions, OmniFocus has an arsenal of powerful options for choosing how to view your data. Hide or show actions as you see ï¬t, tell OmniFocus to only show the very next thing you need to do to finish a project, view only the items that are due this weekâ€”itâ€™s up to you.
Focus

Use OmniFocus to keep your goals and tasks, both personal and professional, in one ordered, easy to access system that you can depend on. Unburden your mind of everything you need to remember, and focus your attention on the things that matter to you most.
Integration with OS X

Sync with iCal

Sync your tasks with iCal and access, add, modify and complete them on any device that supports iCal to do items.
Add tasks via Mail
