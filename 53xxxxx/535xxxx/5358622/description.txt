Product Description:

Sports Island 2 lets up to four players compete against one another simultaneously in ten different disciplines to test their reactions and skills to the limit.

The type of event players can compete in starts with the more familiar, like Football and Basketball and moves right across the athletic spectrum taking in Badminton, Curling and Figure Skating!

Each event will require users to master the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in various ways as the demands of each event takes shape. Archery requires a steady hand to keep the Wii Remote while a twist of the wrist in the Snowboarding section will see the player navigate the slopes with consummate ease. In Figure Skating players need to keep to the music and correctly time all of their jumps and spins in order to impress the judges.

There will be multiple game modes in addition to the obvious single and multiplayer options, but it is the latter where this game will really come into its own. The full list of events within Sports Island is: Beach Volleyball, Snowboard Cross, Badminton, Basketball, Curling, Figure Skating, Archery, Supercross, Football and Kart Racing.
