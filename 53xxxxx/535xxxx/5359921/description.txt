> years old. Left without answers after his older brother Victor's disappearance
> from a camping trip near Town Creek, he has tried to move on. But when Victor
> returns one night, very much alive and having escaped his captors, Evan asks 
> no questions - at his brother's request, he loads their rifles, packs up their
> boat and follows him back to Town Creek on a mission of revenge that will 
> test them in every possible way
