but the movie itself kinda sucks. the martial arts choreography and special effects looked really lame and the story isnt that interesting either. watch ""ip man"" instead if you like donnie yen."
,skoumoun,2011-07-14T10:16Z,"Quotes about the mandarin/cantonese dub:

""I watched part of the Scorpio PAL version and it doesn't seem that there is a single audio language for this film. Simon Yam's speech was clearly dubbed. Tony Leung Ka-fai's speech had a Cantonese accent and seemed to match his mouth movements, so I think his speech wasn't dubbed (otherwise the Mandarin would have sounded more standardized). But it's clear that the mainland actors (eg, Hu Jun) are speaking Mandarin on the set. This leads me to believe that the dialogue on the set was performed in different dialects; that wouldn't be surprising since this is a China-HK co-production (which meets the quota for the number of mainland actors involved in the film to get the benefits of mainland registration).""

--------

""Simon Yam, dubbed in mando ver., his own voice in canto ver.

Tony Leung , Nick Tse, Eric Tsang, and Leon Lai, their own voice in both ver.

Donnie, in mando ver., his own voice when speaking cantonese, dubbed when speaking mandarin. His own voice in canto ver.""

thanks for the upload!"
