this will disturb your browsing pleasures on both IE and Firefox and give you wonderful ads :B.

ESET NOD32 blocks the program's ability to phone home. However if you have installed it then all you have to do is 

Go into Control Panel > Add Remove Programs.

Remove ""LoudMo Contextual Ad Assistant"".

if you want more info you can allways google primawega adn maybe read this http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=1726795&start=0"

A much better torrent is http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5346628/BioShock_2-Razor1911"
