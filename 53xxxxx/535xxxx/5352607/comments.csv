[T],Quazza,2010-02-10T20:18Z,"In honor of the 44th President of the United States , Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream has introduced a new flavor: "" Barocky Road .""

Barocky Road is a blend of half vanilla, half chocolate, and surrounded by nuts and flakes. The vanilla portion of the mix is not openly advertised and usually denied as an ingredient. The nuts and flakes are all very bitter and hard to swallow.

The cost is $100.00 per scoop.

When purchased it will be presented to you in a large beautiful cone, but after you pay for it, the ice cream is taken away and given to the person in line behind you at no charge.

You are left with an empty wallet and no change, holding an empty cone with no hope of getting any ice cream."

,tomc100,2010-02-13T23:44Z,I wonder who is more of a loser. A liberal jackass troll or a liberal jackass troll who looks up people they hate on a pirate site to post asinine comments thinking he's clever. 
,themdg,2010-02-15T01:21Z,Thanks for uploading these.  I know it's probably a lot of work.   It works so great with an rss download.   Hope you enjoyed your convention.
