Glenn Beck Program for February 10th 2010


I am supposed to be going to an Anime Convention in DC...I'm supposed to be leaving tomorrow...

So, I may or may not be around to upload Glenn for the rest of the week. 

This is all assuming that I can defeat the snow monster that is knocking at my door.........
