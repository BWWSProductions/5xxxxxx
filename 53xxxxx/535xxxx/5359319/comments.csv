,Bumpcityfunk,2010-02-14T22:55Z,This is CD 1 of 3 since dipshit McGee didn't label the torrent title properly.
,Lonepup,2010-02-15T10:08Z,"Thanks again EZTV for your excellent share.

I have to comment on a few BONE HEADS that have posted lame ass comments about the labeling of your torrents...

Yes I was at first confused, but then found that you did correctly label, as above, ""HDTV.....-CD1.... on your TPB description box.
The other TPB description boxes... -CD2  and -CD3

I took the time out to check out my facts, before posting a lame ass comment as I have read here above. All of your TPB description boxes were correct. :-)

I noticed one stupid shit that called you a ""jackass"" DOES NOT SHARE A SINGLE FILE!

What a lame fuck. Somebody spank that monkey!

I am only surprised at reading a few lame fucks here, because this is a video share, and I'm surprised that they need to wear a baby bib when they burp out their baby milk, how to view these videos... and which one is #1 or #3. OMG!

OK here's how to do it: 1) get out of bed in the morning, 2) Wait for mommy change diaper, ... 3) turn on the computer.... 

I usually read comments by these lamers in the APPS section, because they cannot tie their own shoe lace, let alone install a simple application.

These are the same ass wipes, that the second they turn 18, their parents kick them out of the house, and now they are parked all day in front a grocery stores begging, can you spare a quarter? 

UM.... or they really in their 30's and 40's....and have to move back in with mommy?

Now, I expect these same lamers to post stupid comments in the porn section.... how to spank their monkey, with KY jelly or Vaseline? ... and is  it ok to spank it only until eye sight need glasses.

Great job editing out all the commercials. Thanks EZTV!
