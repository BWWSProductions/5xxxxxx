,Njordin,2010-02-18T19:48Z,"There is a problem. When I try to launch the game from the HL2 icon, I get the message ""Unable yo get IFileSystem interface from FileSystem factory"".
Also, if I try to launch it from the shorcut ""Half-Life.2.PROPER.Offline.Nosteam-AHU"" I'll get to the loading screen but then an ""engine error"" message telling that my ""available memory is less than 128mb"".
What can i do ?"
,JesseAarons,2010-02-18T21:52Z,"ok Njordin  tell me whats your system configuration ???
i dont think your RAM is much "
,CatsLikeCatFood,2010-02-18T22:10Z,"Ok,I Downloaded it,extract it all,and i was reading the notes about merging dlls and stuff,so i tried em all,and nothing,i try the Half Life launcher but i get ""Unable to get IFileSystem interface from filesystem factory"",and if i tried the shortcut,It starts but never reaches main menu,only after the valve picture...any ideas on what should i do?"
,JesseAarons,2010-02-19T09:15Z,"try this for all who have problems 
Copy and paste +matforcehardwaresync 0 +sndasyncprefetchpriority 1 in the target line, in the games shortcut
It should look like this exactly: ""C:\Half-Life 2\hl2.exe"" -steam-console +matforcehardwaresync 0 +sndasyncprefetchpriority 1 If you still get the error when quitting the game just ignore it, it will still save."
,Njordin,2010-02-19T10:11Z,"My memory is definitelly not the problem, it's 4GB and I have played Half Life 2 in the past. I copied what you said in the target box and the ""Unable to get IFileSystem blah blah blah"" has gone but I still get an error about my memory."
,Njordin,2010-02-19T19:06Z,"Ok, I fixed the memory problem by chaning the compatibility {found in properties} to windows xp. The only problem now is that Alyx may stick in some elevator scenes. When she, or anyone else, sticks, a quick save and then load may help but that's not for sure. You {JesseAarons} should create quicksave folders that can get us out of this situation just like dopeman did for hl episode2  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3858005/%5BPC%5D_Half_Life_2_Episode_Two_%5BTEMP.FIX%5D_%5Bdopeman%5D"
