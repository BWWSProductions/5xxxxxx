,peoe,2010-02-16T00:29Z,No seeders? I am willing to seed this for a long while if I can download it. I've been stuck on 0%.
,stenoaux,2010-06-20T01:56Z,"Does this contain 2010 map data?  I burned the .bin to a dual-layer DVD but when I put this in my RNS-E unit, it only updated the software version.

It does not recognize this as a Navigation map dvd.  Did I do something wrong?"
,sat_sonic,2010-06-28T05:02Z,This file works great.  Burned to a dual layer DVD+R.  Format type Disc At Once (DAO).  Finalize Disc.
,dp_pirate,2012-01-07T07:49Z,"I burned to a dual DVD using ImgBurn. I set the book type to DVD-Rom.  When I inserted it updated my software from 150 to 260, but after that it does not recognize as a navigation DVD.  It only recognizes it as a software update disc.  Any ideas on what I need to do?"
