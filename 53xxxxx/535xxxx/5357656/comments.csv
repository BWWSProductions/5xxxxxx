thanks!"
,GarryColeman,2010-02-13T01:09Z,doesnt seem to expand any songs?
,senseotech,2010-02-13T05:52Z,"The problem is that the LP expects the audio files on the outside of the itlp file.  This file is basically just a folder though, so in OS X, right click and show its contents, then grab the audio files out and add them to iTunes along the the itlp file and alls good."
,GarryColeman,2010-02-13T08:38Z,Thx Senseo. works great now.
,phinot,2010-02-13T10:06Z,"THERE IS NO PROBLEM IN USING ITUNES LP WITH A PC. IT IS COMPLETELY COMPATIBLE. IF YOU WANT ONLY THE MUSIC, WHEN YOU FINISH THE EXTRACTION YOU MUST GET ONNLY THE AUDIIO FILES. AND IF YOU WANT THE ITUNES LP EXPERIENCE YOU MUST ADD THE WHOLE FOLDER AND COPY IT IN THE ITUNES MUSIC FOLDER SO IT CAN APPEAR IN ITUNES. "
,phinot,2010-02-13T10:20Z,YOU CAN LOOK FOR ANOTHER POSTS UPLOADED FROM ME. EVERY ALBUM IS UPLOADED FROM THE ORIGINAL IN AAC FORMAT HIGH QUALITY.

,anteloper,2011-06-14T19:57Z,"just a note that may be useful, if ur using a mac then rather than adding to the itunes music folder just drag the folder/files onto the itunes thingy in the dock.. i find this to be a better way of getting about..."
,MistyS,2012-01-05T19:46Z,"1.Extract folder
2.Open itunes
3.Add 16 audio files and ITLP file to itunes
4.Turn the bass up"
