With initial seed, you cannot DL more of torrent until you have distributed at least the amount you initially DL'd.  SO if your DL speed is 300 KbPS and your UL rate is 5, it is going to take you a LONG time to get the second chunk.

Folks, in this homeschool genre, you REALLY need to set your UL speed to at LEAST 20 KBPS.  I know our UL is really limited on home networks, but at least set it for your max (usually 40 KBPS in rural USA) over night.  

This is a TINY file that should already have MANY seeds by now!"
