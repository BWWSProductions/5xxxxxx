I grew up listening to Metal Church, and they have alot to do with the forming of my taste in metal bands. IMO, Metal Church is one of the most influential and important metal bands in music history. Also, Ronnie Munroe is actually starting to become one of my favorite singers now after listening to him for the last couple of years. At first glance he sounds like alot of other dudes, but if you really give him a few analytical listens, you will see he is easily a new Geoff Tate or Bruce Dickinson, although not quite as intense....he has the range, and I hope he finds an awesome band now that MC has broken up. STAY METAL."
