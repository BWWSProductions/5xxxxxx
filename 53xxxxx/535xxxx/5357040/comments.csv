,Wobble420,2010-02-22T02:56Z,"Fast torrent. The songs aren't all the same volume, and some of the titles are in caps, but they changed back to normal when I added them to my iPod.

Otherwise, it's a great torrent, and I thank you a million times over for putting it up. Seeding :)

,BramLovesYou,2011-09-11T07:03Z,"I sounds like many of these songs are still in their demo stages, and/or aren't meant to be released. I'm a fan of Marina, and am looking for her first album in it's original form, not this mixed list.
