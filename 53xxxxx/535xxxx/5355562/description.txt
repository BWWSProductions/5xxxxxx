BBC Radio 2 - Bob Harris Country - 11 Feb 2010 


Tonight's session guest is Holly Williams, the grand-daughter of country music legend Hank Williams and the daughter of Hank Williams Junior.

With her own career as a Nashville singer-songwriter Holly Williams has recently released her second album, 'Here with me', which takes her firmly back to her country roots, in contrast with the more alternative, introspective piano balladry of her 2004 debut. Despite great critical acclaim 'The Ones We Never New' didn't achieve commercial success and she was soon dropped from the label. 

Following a car crash, which left her badly injured in 2006, she rebuilt her career and released 'Here With Me' last year.

Holly is in the middle of a European tour and joins Bob live in the studio.
