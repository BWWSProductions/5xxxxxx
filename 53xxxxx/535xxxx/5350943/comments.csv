i'm the only person who confirms new users, if you dont have the time, then i suggest to surf to any other site!. and btw. if you are from
Romania
India
Egypt
then DONT WASTE TIME to register, as we dont accept new users from this countries ATM.
and a quick reminder at the end, we are a private site, which means, you cant just register and leech the hell out of anything, forget that, we dont tolerate leechers at all, sharing is caring, if you heard that already, then you are welcome, if you think its stupid, then you waste your time.

I downloaded this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5347317/BioShock_2_%5BPC___ENG_ITA_DEU%5D%5BRazor1991%5D  In game play when you try to save; sometimes the save option is there but most of the time it isn't so when you been playing for an hour and decide you want to save, you press esc to save and find that the save option ISN'T THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! why the FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?! I'm guessin this rip has the same issue, because it's A RIP!!!!!!! I don't know why you people upload this shit when all it does is frustrate people to no end.. "

,17Patty,2010-03-21T23:57Z,"ok, nevermind. i just needed some mental help is all.. next time i should FIRST try to create a LOCAL ACCOUNT.... derp ! :P"
,acidhavoc,2010-04-02T03:22Z,"Just to help get things straight with getting it to work:

1. The desktop icon leads to an error. Don't use it.
2. Go to where it is installed, bioshock2, SP, builds, binaries, and then use ""bioshock2launcher.exe"" to run the game. 
3. If you get an error of a missing xlive.dll, google ""games for windows"" and download the client. 
4. Re-launch the game from ""bioshock2launcher.exe"" and it should work.
5. You need an offline, or local, account to play and BE ABLE TO SAVE. Hit the ""home"" key, and create a new account. Scroll down and there should be a hyperlink to create a ""local account""

From there, everything should work out. The videos are reduced in quality, but like other said it is watchable. So far, running on Windows 7, on maxed settings, and no problems so far. Hope this helped, as it took me a bit before I got it."
