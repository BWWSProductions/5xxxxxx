         A cheeseburger and a side of fries--last year, Americans      
         ate over 7 billion of them. And there's an amazing story      
         behind every one. Any idea how they get the sesame seeds to   
         stick to the bun? What does it take to stuff 20 tomatoes      
         inside a ketchup bottle? And what's the secret to getting     
         the dill in dill pickle chips? Host Bobby Bognar sets         
         off on a quest to find out, as he travels the country to      
         unearth the hidden mysteries inside our cheeseburger and      
         fries. It's the science behind perfectly melting cheese,      
         the production of jet-black seeds that sprout into Spanish    
         onions, and a French Fry factory where every day mountains    
         of potatoes are sliced and diced in to 36 million French      
          fries.
