Heres what i know about the script

1. Admin panel is at domainname.com/control folder

2. login is kiwi/catzb0b

3. Its a clean install, no virused urls, no exploits, CLEAN! Unlike the original

4. Needs some stuff activated for the htaccess to work, its listed in the htaccess file itself.

5. Theres no install, mod the vars.php file and upload the mysql and it should be good to go!

6. Its a modded version of the LJ Scripts Autosurf script.

oh and 7. Admin Bob's a ~censored~ for dealing with the public like this. He deserves what ever he gets.

Mirrors accepted and appreciated, this guy owes a LOT of people money for the damages and screw jobs he's given and i can see him screaming and throwing a tantrum over this. If he emails or freaks please post it, im interested in seeing what kinda of hate mail i can keep getting out of him.

I should add this is the working FIXED copy unlike his site where he had to steal to get the fixes. I speak on behalf of the handful of coders he stole to get this working in the first place and keep secure.
