,jawman,2010-03-04T05:51Z,"also darwin, last track on the album blue, is fucked up. it's 20 mins long, and the song is originally like 5 or 6 minutes. the one you have fades out after around 3:30 minutes then picks back up around  "

,jawman,2010-03-04T06:38Z,"i am an idiot. that's actually how the song was originally done. i just found my 3eb cd in my car and sure enough darwin is like that. sorry!
but yeah my first comment about track #8 missing from album Ursa Major still stands. other than that great rip and great upload dude! i appreciate it so much! saved me from having to rip them myself and having to type in all the tags! :)"
,jawman,2010-03-06T18:22Z,"sorry to flood the comments, but album Ursa Major is a 12 track album, not 13 tracks, so track 13 is actually the missing track 8!"
[V],Kitlope,2010-03-07T12:16Z,"Thanks for the info. Ursa Major is not my rip though the one in this discography is the one floating around in FLAC on various torrent sites.

Sorry about that - but whats important I guess is all their studio albums are here in one package.

Anyone know a P2P program that has a high number of FLAC that is user to user like DC++ or SLSK?  I am stuck downloading here for now but there is almost no Death Metal, and Black Metal is non-existent in FLAC on torrents"

,StvnWilsn,2011-02-13T07:57Z,thank you so much for this ! THANK YOU KITLOPE.
