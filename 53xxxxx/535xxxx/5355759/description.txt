From Wiki:


Third Eye Blind (sometimes abbreviated 3eb) is an American alternative rock band formed in the early 1990s in San Francisco. The band's current line-up is Stephan Jenkins (vocals, guitar), Brad Hargreaves (drums, percussion), and Tony Fredianelli (guitar, vocals). Original bassist Arion Salazar has not been playing with the band, and his future as part of the band is unclear. It is reported on the band's Facebook page that he is able to return whenever he wishes, as there is an "open door policy" for him. Abe Millet, of Inviolet Row, has been filling in for Salazar during recent concerts. He has played bass on the band's latest tour and will continue to fill in until otherwise noted. Millett has received immense support from the fans, hailing him as the best Salazar replacement to date, and have requested he be made a member of the band.[citation needed]


After the success of their eponymous debut album in 1997, the band released one more album, 1999's Blue, before guitarist Kevin Cadogan was released under controversial circumstances.[1] In 2003, the band released Out of the Vein. In 2008 the band released the digital EP Red Star. After a six year hiatus from releasing a full length album Ursa Major was released on August 17, 2009. The band is best known for the two hit singles "Semi-Charmed Life" and "Jumper", as well as other popular songs such as "Slow Motion", "How's It Going To Be", "Graduate", "Motorcycle Drive By", "Wounded" and "Never Let You Go".







Third Eye Blind 1997


Third Eye Blind is the eponymous debut for the American Alternative rock band Third Eye Blind, originally released on April 8, 1997. It spawned several singles, including Top 10 charting "Semi-Charmed Life", "Jumper", and "How's It Going to Be". The album has been certified 6x Platinum by the RIAA.[1] The layout of the back artwork was inspired by that of The Beatles' album "Revolver".


The first US issue of Third Eye Blind, approximately 500,000 copies, featured a gold-tinted cover photograph with a dark red band logo. The photo was then changed to red with a yellow logo (seen above) at the band's request. UK and other Continental European nations continued offering the gold edition, and Japan had a cyan, negative photo cover.

Blue 1999


Blue is the second album by Third Eye Blind, written and recorded in 1999 and released on November 23, 1999. It is a moodier, darker album than the band's first, though the second single was the radio-friendly "Never Let You Go". The album debuted at #40 on the Billboard 200 charts, selling about 75,000 copies in its first week of release.[1] Blue has been certified platinum by the RIAA, selling about 1.25 million copies in the U.S.[1][2]

During the band's tour shortly after the release of Blue, Kevin Cadogan was released from the band on January 25, 2000.[3] Tony Fredianelli, who had some limited experience with the band previously, joined the band shortly thereafter. Cadogan subsequently sued Third Eye Blind for breach of contract, with a settlement of an undisclosed amount permanently ending the relationship.

Out of the Vein  2003 


Out of the Vein is Third Eye Blind's third album, released on May 13, 2003. Frontman Stephan Jenkins wanted the album to be called Crystal Baller, but the album's name was changed as the rest of the group didn't like the name.[2] The album had a strong debut at #12 on the Billboard 200 with 63,000 copies sold in its first week[3] and the band has been quoted many times remarking on their happiness with the album.

By the time the band released 2003's Out of the Vein, Elektra Records was in the midst of being absorbed into Atlantic Records, and Jenkins contends the group was not a priority. "Our record company ceased to exist the month the record was released," Jenkins said. "Elektra Records imploded. It was just letterhead."[4] While Out of the Vein has yet to be certified by the RIAA, the album sold about 500,000 as of March 2007.[4]

Jenkins said of the group's previous work: "The first two albums were like two parts of the same piece. We've had a hiatus. This is a new beginning. We're developing a songbook that's getting richer."

Ursa Major 2009



Ursa Major is the fourth studio album from American alternative rock band Third Eye Blind. Released on August 17, 2009 on the group's own Mega Collider label, Ursa Major was the group's first studio album in over six years.[1][2][3] The first single from the album was "Don't Believe a Word", which debuted on the radio June 5, 2009


Work on Ursa Major began shortly after the release of Out of the Vein in 2003.[4] Frontman Stephan Jenkins had intended for the album to be released in 2007, but didn't feel that it was complete and writer's block slowed down the album's progress.[4][5] The working title of the album was The Hideous Strength, after a similarly named C.S. Lewis' book.[6][7] According to Jenkins, the album's name was subsequently changed to Ursa Major because "...Weâ€™ve been hibernating and now weâ€™ve awakened and we are hungry for spring and we want to feed and we want to thrive."[4] Another album, Ursa Minor, is scheduled to follow Ursa Major and may include songs that were recorded during the Ursa Major sessions.[4][8]

Ursa Major debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200, selling 49,000 copies in its first week of release.[9] The top 10 debut made Ursa Major the highest charting album of the group's career, though its first week sales were less than that of its predecessor's first week sales of 63,000.
