,Tibby12,2010-02-16T04:02Z,Heading says: 2010.Pro ... your written content says 2010.Pro.Plus. Is it the 2010.Pro.Plus Version (as picture above only shows Outlook and not Outlook.with.Business.Contact.Manager) can anyone pls confirm?
,philipBoee,2010-02-17T08:11Z,"didn't try the 2010 because i still like my 207 office :)  i downloaded my ms office from

,s.lawrence.16,2010-02-17T14:44Z,"I too agree, this is a great program. This was a very smooth and easy download. It installed very quickly and without any errors. Thanks so much!"
,Tibby12,2010-02-18T08:20Z,"This version is not the Plus version, as it does not contain the Business.Contact.Manager for Outlook."
,Tibby12,2010-02-18T08:25Z,"And (once installed), (under Help) says: Product Activation Required (Product is unlicensed). But works fine otherwise."
,Tibby12,2010-02-18T08:27Z,"correction, (after install) (in Help) it does say its the Plus version, but does not contain Business Contact Manager, as stipulated by MS website."

,barnabyJ,2010-03-02T23:59Z,"Seems nobody's been reading the title, this is Build 4734 of the Release Candidate for Office 2010.  It was distributed at no cost to developers and others, and will some day expire.  Microsoft did the same thing with Windows 7, first issuing an ISO for the Beta version of W7, Release candidate (RC) and then the RTM (release to manufacturers).

Generally a release candidate has the majority of processes, functions, and features in place, but is not ready to be released to the public.  It's a ""candidate"" for the public release but hasn't yet been ""elected""."
,Jomvp,2010-03-07T20:12Z,"After installing, does a 60-day trial begin? Or was it removed? "
,iKarlCPFC,2010-03-08T11:00Z,Why Dont You Download from the Official Microsoft Site takes a matter of seconds
,setuid,2010-03-08T22:41Z,"WARNING: This download includes the ""TrojanDownloader:Win32/Lodomo.I"", so clean your system first, and after you install this, or install it on a TEST-ONLY VM, not connected to the live Internet. 

You have been warned!"
,shaw57,2010-03-15T11:38Z,"Put it on 2 x PCs, installed fine. After 28 days its asking for product activation. Says this copy of Microsoft Office is not activated. You have one day left to activate. So not that good after all.  I have now uninstalled and downloaded the Pro Business Office from Microsoft.
PLEASE ADVISE"
