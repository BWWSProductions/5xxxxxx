,StePHen_0,2010-02-10T16:07Z,@nishulk - how old are you? 9? he's probably new to this. why cant you just simply say no and not say anything that makes you sound like a complete @ss of yourself.
,Mond123,2010-02-10T16:31Z,"Please seed ! The screeenshots looks good, looking forward!!"
,Nantuko,2010-02-10T17:46Z,"@StePHen_0  

If you didn't notice nishulk's first post on here he noted that it was his first comment. I'm guessing he couldn't wait to join the flame war. In witch he has started with the first thread he posted in. "
,Ross1993,2010-02-10T18:19Z,What is a WS scr?

Please keep silence, about things you don't know.

,angel666247,2010-02-10T18:33Z,"@ All

Quality is good.
audio 9
video 8

worth the time and effort."
,dhruv990,2010-02-10T18:49Z,"So The quality may look like a dvdrip in the screens but it actually bends more towards a vcd rip.
Audio quality is good (according to the sample, though i guess speech scenes should've been put instead of a practice). A bit too bassy though but good nonetheless."
,saskdavid,2010-02-10T20:15Z,"This doesn't add up to quality as time of movie is only 99 min, so no matter how this was made it should never be such a huge file!?! "
,jebemusve,2010-02-10T20:49Z,"@ saskdavid and people like you

I really hate to see when people like you criticize work of people like raymondhome. They put an effort that you and other alike assholes can watch movies for free. 

When have you ever upload a torrent and help sharing?!? I have shitty upload (not by choice). What's your excuse?

Shut up and be grateful or go in cinema and pay the movie!!!

BTW, thanks raymondhome and keep up with good work ;)"
,heavydiamond,2010-02-10T20:52Z,"everyone with a bitching comment less than grateful
thing 2 say what is your problem. raymondhome takes his time out every week to give u something 4 nothing ,unless he's telling u lies in his description of the torrent stop whinning  bitches. retail copy comes out in about 1 month R5 that is, anyone's guess after that 4 R1   


thanks 2 the uploader in advance 4 the effort been looking 4ward 2 this. haters eat a dick "
,pinshot,2010-02-10T21:07Z,"Can i just add this comment in the hope it is read by the makers of this movie!

THE RELEASE OF THIS MOVIE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS HOW NOT TO LAUNCH A MOVIE!

This movie i would have happily paid to see in the UK cinemas. i would have paid ÂŁ50 to it! The producers/director or whatever FUCKED THIS UP ROYALY!

This movie was released in parts of the world 3 months before it was ""supposed"" to be release in the UK. When it was released it wasnt even showing in many cinemas. I SEE ALMOST EVERY MOVIE that is worth seeing in the cinema and i live near london so have a large choice. This movie could not be easily located at all.

You fuckin dickhead movie studios need to learn that real movie lovers such as myself will not wait until you decide to release your movies in our country and the only way forward is for you to adopt world wide release policies and cut the crap! 

I can download a movie for free the day it is released and when i know that a movie will not be available for weeks or months in my country you can be damn sure i will download a cam/ts and watch it on my ipod where the quality looks fine!

Im sure studio moles are reading these comments so feel free to leave a response and an apology for ruining one of the movies i have looked forward to most!"
,waistland,2010-02-10T21:21Z,Hay could some one tell me if this has T&A in it my 12 year old wants to see it  and not in the mood to watch it 2 times just to make sure he can watch it?

A teen couple -- both ninjas in training -- shares a tender kiss. In another scene, they rest their heads on each other's chests, listening to each other's heartbeats (while clothed and in the open).  "
,SuperMexican,2010-02-11T00:35Z,I've been waiting for someone to upload the DVD rip and my patience has been rewarded. This is the real deal folks. It's not a cam as someone posted. Thank u raymondhome. This upload will keep me very happy until the Blue Ray version is released. That's gonna look awesome!

,JuggaloJuggy,2010-02-13T06:16Z,"@pigsikk 

dude they bitch cause you dont save anything by doing stupid .rar files so whats the point onces you finish downloading it you have to extract it which takes twice the spot so really there is no point at all in doing a rar file as a torrent cus im sure as hell aint gunna keep the rars and seed"
,JuggaloJuggy,2010-02-13T06:18Z,"above post should say ""keep the .rars to seed"" "
,mistergroenevingers,2010-02-13T23:26Z,"Why people would want to ""watch a movie without download"" is beyond me. You're always downloading the movie even though you are watching it directly. And then in the end you don't even have it on disk. What if you want to watch it a second time or someone else you know would like to see it. You have to download it again. So pretty fucking please with strawberries and coke on top, get fucking lost with your ""watch without download"" spam motherfuckers."
,mistergroenevingers,2010-02-13T23:29Z,"By the way, thanks for the torrent raymond. ;)"

,stylesonic,2010-02-15T04:23Z,Quality is pretty poor considering it's a big 1.4 Gb file.
,SuperMexican,2010-02-15T04:28Z,I recoded this movie using XMedia recode to make it a little sharper. Burning it to DVD and using my PS3 to upconvert the file it looks close to a DVD rip as you can get. The original file is damn good and it's the best copy out there. This will hold me off until the Blu ray version is available. Thanks again raymondhome!

Guys check out at 21:29 in the movie - when our imba maincharacter pratice with his kyoketsu shogei - the knife actually hits him right on the stomach and bounches back - but freeze frame when it hits and notice his facialexpressions - my bet is that it actually hurts a bit to get hit by it - looks painfull ;)
