My thanks to the 4 kind souls that shared their Mancini Collection.

Here are 7 more albums:
Charade
Combo! The Original â€œPeter Gunnâ€™ (Sorry could only save 5 tracks)
More Music from Peter Gunn
The Blues and the Beat
The Mancini Sound
The Pink Panther
The Sounds and Voices of Henry Mancini.

These are ripped from vinyl, RTR and cassette.  320 VBR.

Some of the vinyl fairly poor.  I ran the depopper and graphic equalizer as aggressively as I could without hurting the quality.

Turntable: was Dual with Pickering XV15 and Shure elliptical stylus.
Cassette: Nacamichi
RTR: Roberts 5000 set up in lab after replacing all the electrolytic caps.

Enjoy and PLEASE seed
