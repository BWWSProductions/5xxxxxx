I jus aquited the vinyl LP called The Blues and the Beat...but if your torrent sounds good, i wont have to record it because i got one from you..so your torrent is appreciated."

almost all of the rips sound beautiful too.."
,PIRATE-555,2010-11-16T17:50Z,"I LOVE Mancini, but SORRY, in all honesty I can't seed this because of massive distortions, fuzzy sounds, pops and clicks in almost all of the selections!

Download and be prepared for disappointment.

Again, sorry but it's the truth.  How I wish this collection was a winner!

,xny675,2011-10-16T01:38Z,"Downloading this is a complete waste of time.

This is a great collection of music, but unfortunately the transcriber did an incredibly bad job - from not setting record levels correctly [outright clipping throughout all albums] to harshly overabusing the noise reduction [some tracks have so much NR artefacting that they sound like they're playing underwater].  

It's a good try, k7sparky, but go back to the beginning, and this time learn how to record things.  "
