Speed and efficiency optimized firefox-based browser. (ZIP - unpack and run)

Why settle for a basic build of your Firefox browser on Windows Operating Systems when you can have one that performs 25% faster? Mozilla does not provide optimized browser packages for Windows, while many Linux ("from scratch") users get the advantage of a browser built specifically for their system. Pale Moon fixes that by providing a fully optimized firefox-compatible browser.
