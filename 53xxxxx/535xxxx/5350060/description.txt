* GENERAL NOTE : is well known that many of the principal games can get circunstancial problems to some users , for example in this one the securom launcher:failed to start application happen because the vcredist 2005 need to be reeinstalled , the vcredist 2008 can help too and finally an appropriate check if the net framework 3.5 is correctly installed in the computer , the windows 7 users need a little more attention in this particular because in this operative system the idea of the net framework well installed with the operative system can be not entirely correct and the user of the operative system search for a way that can guarantee a safe install of the framework , it can happen trying to make the install of the framework like it is and that not permited because the necessary permissions of the installing not obtained then the user try to find a way out with some other support to have definitly correct installed the net framework 3.5 , new frameworks are in the horizon of microsoft and i really hope that this new ones can have a more explicit and pratical way for the new framework use .
Maybe i divagated a little bit in the primary subject but the point is that make sense check the framework 3.5 and reeinstall the vcredists , the foruns of 2k games have users with this problem and explaining the best way to go to resolve the problem more or less similar in what i already said (2k games is this game developer) . Good Luck in getting the problem corrected and i think the solution pass for the reeinstall of the redistributables and a correct check of the framework .

COMMENTS :
 
- not all the users can experiment this issue using the game but if it happen the suggestion to help is this one
     
- the redistributables are necessary to help the stability of some executables running the game


* GAMEPLAY :


* The player takes the role of "Subject Delta", a prototype for the Big Daddies seen in the original game and the first Big Daddy to be successfully bonded with a Little Sister. The character possesses superior speed and intelligence to other Big Daddies, as well as free will. As such, the player uses the Big Daddy's drill and rivet gun as weapons as well as some other weapons found across Rapture. However, in a new addition, it is now possible to perform a melee attack with every weapon in the game. The weapons in the game will have several types of ammo, similar to the first game. Additionally, in contrast to other Big Daddies, the player may also use plasmids, while "upgrade trees" will provide unique ways to upgrade them. A new feature added is the ability to dual-wield plasmids or weapons at the same time. Further Big Daddy abilities found in the first game, such as performing a shoulder dash, will also be an option.

 
A Big SisterThe player will also be able to step outside the city of Rapture into the ocean due to the diving suit the Big Daddies wear. Here the player can explore the ocean floor, recover from fights, marvel at the city from the outside and pick up special items. As seen by the demo, some of the special items include first aid kits, EVE Hypos, and special sea slugs. Throughout the game the player will be forced to fight Rapture's new Big Sisters, hybrids of sorts between the Big Daddy and older Little Sisters. A Big Sister attack will be spontaneous and unplanned, but if the player has a Little Sister with them at the time, she'll give you a warning that a Big Sister is coming. Unlike the Big Daddies, they are extremely quick and arguably more powerful, able to extract ADAM from their enemies through a harvesting needle, straight into her bloodstream, which fuels "telekinetic abilities beyond anything previously thought possible".
