,Aonshix,2010-02-11T00:31Z,"@theo2021

The missing .dll means that you don't have Games For Windows Live installed, which can be found here. ( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=98609 )

Being a system file, it's not missing from the rip"

,Nickhamm,2010-02-12T09:40Z,"Installed FreeArc, installed Game for Windows Live, ran this installer from Globe and launched the game. Runs fantastic, nothing seems ripped, videos for cutscenes have been resampled to lower quality but are still watchable. Haven't played with saving yet, just played the first level and hopped on here to share that it DOES work! Final extracted size is only about 4.5GB too for anyone wondering.

Also, Globe has an alternative EXE on his blog for anyone who doesn't want to watch the Razor intro tacked onto the included loader when they launch the game."
,Aonshix,2010-02-12T16:02Z,"I'm over halfway into it, and can confirm what Nickhamm has said. Cutscenes are watchable although downgraded. Also I think that the MP component has been flat out removed, as it cannot launch and the entire data included in the RIP is under a folder named SP.  (Apologies if I've missed the mark on this one). Seeing as it's a peer to peer MP anyways, no loss here for pirates.

Saving has worked perfectly and I'm even accumulating achievements on my offline account, I wonder what'll happen when my account tries to sync with the server.

Thanks for the RIP and purchase the game if you enjoy it. I know I will :)"
,jerry2020wtf,2010-02-12T21:57Z,"Right. so how do i create an offline account? i do NOT have this option, am i missing something?
all i can do is create a new online account, or use an existing one and both require a cdkey.
can someone help this is very frustrating not being able to save"

guess is because of GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE but i have it instaled :( .... HELPpppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp"
,hu_em_ai,2010-02-14T04:51Z,"First off, thanks to globe and all the seeders (very slow though haha).

I'm having the same problem that some of the other users are having. I followed all the instructions and extracted the game to the desktop; however, when running the launcher and listening to the snes music with the ""Razor"" logo I get the following:

""SecuLauncher: failed to start application.(2000""

Can somebody help on fixing this problem? Thanks"
,Chaotic_Children,2010-02-14T07:00Z,why is the download so low???? :(
,Brakas,2010-02-15T23:49Z,"someone has choked the line.to keep people from getting this torrent. oh well there are more torrents to try,thnx anyways!"
,lufal78,2010-02-16T00:46Z,"everyone just use the bioshock launcher instead of exe, it works"
,Terracotta_Pie,2010-02-28T03:19Z,"This has become an annoyance, but i cannot save my games due to windows live. I have created an offline account and i still cannot save. Can someone supply a cd key or some information as to how i can save?"
[T],nightstalker666,2010-03-01T16:46Z,nice one thanks mate
,biogenesiss,2010-03-11T05:59Z,"These bioshock 2 rips for PC are BS!! I downloaded this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5347317/BioShock_2_%5BPC___ENG_ITA_DEU%5D%5BRazor1991%5D  In game play when you try to save; sometimes the save option is there but most of the time it isn't so when you been playing for an hour and decide you want to save, you press esc to save and find that the save option ISN'T THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! why the FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?! I'm guessin this rip has the same issue, because it's A RIP!!!!!!! I don't know why you people upload this shit when all it does is frustrate people to no end.. "
