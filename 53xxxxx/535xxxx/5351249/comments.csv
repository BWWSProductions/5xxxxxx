,dlarrym,2010-02-17T05:40Z,"These are NOT DVD rips... they come of the TV by a Digital TV recorder like TIVO or the many ways the ""APPLE TV"" can use the apple owners hard drive basically just like a TIVO. So NO there are not Dutch Subs.... sorry mate..."
,dlarrym,2010-02-17T05:45Z,"To:   WookieBear     : Why did you think it was a DVDRIP???,  Did the Canadian channel 14 inside a maple leaf not clue you in that it came of a TV using TIVO type technology of some type???....???? Quit messing with your Star Wars figures and PAT ATTENTION!! JK.... Sorry dude. The LOST season 6 won't be available o n DVD till the season is over and eve a few months or longer after that. DO NOT believe the word DVDRIP in reference to the LOST season 6 TV show from ABC for at least another year....Thanx all"
