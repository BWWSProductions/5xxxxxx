Now i want to seed this, but after a while it stops uploading and says error cuz there are some files missing. 
Not the first time it happens, anyone got a solution?"

I use Boxee for Windows which plays anything you throw at it, and the sound IS quieter than normal, but doesn't affect the movie. Still a good version."
