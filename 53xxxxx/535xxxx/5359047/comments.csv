[V],twentyforty,2010-02-13T09:37Z,"@madtown: Now you can see why I have so many times appealed on solidarity.
Is only a few good people left?
Just watch the swarm, when 100%-ers hit the line, they share - nothing. Puff! - they dissapear... Sharing?
Zero, nada... leaving the others behind. How noble...
Right in the spirit of what they are."
