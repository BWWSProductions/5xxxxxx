,dustyshot,2012-03-29T22:53Z,I just watched it and it looks pixelated. Not bluray quality. More like dvd. I have dvds that look better than this.
,dustyshot,2012-03-29T22:57Z,"Sorry, my mistake this is not the one I downloaded. I will download this one to see if it is better. The one I got is MKV, and this one isn't. So I will try it out. Thanks."
