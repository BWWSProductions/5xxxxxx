[T],Tanauser,2010-02-12T15:57Z,"Startpos.esf is the file you found in 

DATA/CAMPAIGNS/MAIN

it's your campaign file

not big deal if you don't have the last one

((as long as you play vanilla with no Elite unit of the East))

I just have put it in in case people want to mod it"
,ravenmad,2010-02-13T05:46Z,So sounds such as gunshots and cannonfire don't work on this release? 
,Ivica121,2010-02-13T10:29Z,everything working. To install these update you need razor update 1.5 (razordox8) and hotfix. 
,scholes8,2010-02-13T11:19Z,Is this update contain patch3.pack and patch4.pack ?

,VerminX,2010-03-02T02:09Z,"What a utter fuckup this game has been since release!  I love this game series and its mechanics and I almost bought it too.  
Thank you Razor for releasing updates to this fuckup, without them the game is completely unplayable.  Its been more than a year and only now I started to play this, because of the updates the game is finally good to play.

Thank you Razordox!"
,cluelesscargo,2010-03-02T04:33Z,"''This application has failed to start because steam_api.dll was not found Re-installing the application may pix the problem''

,bryk,2010-03-22T11:35Z,"Just to be sure,there is no need for overwriting the 'startpos' and 'scripting.lua' files,right?"
,bryk,2010-03-22T11:39Z,"Update: works perfectly well,but is there any way of going back to the main menu screen (video/music) from the previous update (#8)? Sort of prefer the native music to the old Euro stuff."

I do have the game installed and put the file in my game directory and won't work. My dir is c:\games\empire total war. How do i extract the files from rzr-etu9.exe, also why is there a searching mode, there wasn't any in the 5,6,8 version."

,Ifhbiff,2010-09-13T06:33Z,"I have the same problem, no matter where I dl this update, it searches when I try to install and keeps searching until it fails to find the game.  I don't know how to tell it to find the damned game."
,elect_86,2011-01-25T22:44Z,"I found the solution, before installing the update 9, be sure you install

MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ 2005 RUNTIME LIBRARIES"
,Tacoholic,2011-02-19T20:24Z,"put 'rzr_etu9' int your install directory. 'C:programfiles/empire total war'
Then try to run the update..it should work perfectly"
