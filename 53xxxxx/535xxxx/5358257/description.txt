Multicd.sh

combine several CDs into one


multicd.sh is a shell script designed to build a multiboot CD image containing many different Linux distributions and/or utilities.

The avantages to making a CD with this script are:

    * You don't need to burn multiple CDs for small distributions.
    * If you already have the ISO images, it is not necessary to download them again.
    * When a new version of one of the distributions is released, you can simply download the new version and run the script again to build a new multiboot image.



Instructions:

An image of an example multicd directory.

   1. Make a folder for building the image. You can give it any name; I call mine multicd.
   2. Download the multicd.sh script and save it into that folder. (For version 5.0+, either download multicd-[version]-combined.sh to that folder or untar multicd-[version]-seperate.tar.gz to that folder.)
   3. Copy or symlink some of the supported boot images to files in that folder. Note: they must have the names below (i.e. Puppy must be puppy.iso, etc.) Also, only distros supported by this script will work.
   4. Install mkisofs or genisoimage. If your distribution comes with CD/DVD burning sftware, you probably have it already.
   5. Open a terminal, go to the multicd folder (made in step 1) and type:

      chmod +x multicd*.sh
      sudo ./multicd*.sh

      The script will detect which images are present and make a CD for you. They will appear on the menu of the final CD in the order they are listed. (Note: if the final size is over 700 MB, you will have to use a DVD.)

Arguments:

b: don't incude Balder FreeDOS (v4.9 and lower only; in v5.0 you must include it manually)
c / md5: include an MD5 checksum file (md5sum.txt)
m: don't include Memtest86+
modules: select which Slax moudles to copy over (requires dialog)
v: be more verbose
