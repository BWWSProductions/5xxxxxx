This would be truly appreciated so we can turn it into whatever format we want. Would be nice to play it on the streaming server we have using AAC format. FLAC or WAV with Logs and Cue would be great. Read up on it, will take you a day or so to learn and you'll be good to go. Thanks for a great torrent!"
,Kayleen,2010-03-17T13:05Z,"I chose this format on purpose, not by mistake, for many reasons; I know how to make a rip. First: this format is more accessible for everybody, but good enough, the volume of the download is not that big, so the chances of survival of the torrent is greater. Many other reasons... Enjoy this torrent , enjoy this beautiful music. "

,C-F-,2010-03-18T07:59Z,"The reason I asked is over the years, moving from one place to another and people constantly 'borrowing' my original CDs, things got lost and long gone. I was hoping to find an EAC of the entire discography, which I did but can't access since its in Russian. It was 10 some gigs. If you were able to re-release stuff one at a time, slowly the shares would grow. It would be MUCH MUCH appreciated. I just learned to use EAC and its great knowing I can make exact bit for bit backups. EAC can even use FLAC to compress, create a log and a cue file as well, and then off to share it. I am a big fan, and I hope you can come through even if one at a time with the FLACS. I would do it for you if you are willing to trust me with the CDs. Thanks again :)"
,Kayleen,2010-03-18T08:39Z,"Try eMule, it helps alot. It's there, all the stuff. No reason to create a torrent for that. Just eMule-it and be patient, it will come to you. ;)"
,C-F-,2010-03-19T07:29Z,"Thanks once again for your reply. Will look at that. Hopefully I""ll find them in the format I need and then be able to convert to AAC. MP3 to AAC causes major quality loss (atleast for my sound system). 320k AAC would be more than enough for listening while FLAC for archiving. Once again, appreciate your help."
,J-Shot,2011-03-23T03:05Z,"Thank you sir, for this excellent torrent! I personally dislike rips that are one large FLAC file. I'm a 320kbps guy; I've never been able to notice any difference between the two, and I haven't made any effort to understand the LOG and CUE files that come with FLAC rips.

Thanks for keeping it simple, high quality, and well organized! Delerium is amazing :)"
,GrumpyOldAudiofart,2011-04-07T05:03Z,"Disappointing quality in this collection.  Sure ain't FraĂźnhĂśffer.  Many audible quantization/encoding errors; examine for example ~4:35-5:10 on ""Sensorium"" (from ""Semantic Spaces"").  You won't need an audiophile rig to hear what I'm talking about.  I'd guess that album at least was ripped by a buggy version of LAME.  Or am I wrong?"
,Squilbo,2011-06-21T09:38Z,"I lost my Delerium files on my computer, and I can't access my CDs right now, so I'm very glad I found this."
