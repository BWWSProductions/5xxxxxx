[T],minifrepper,2010-04-05T17:36Z,"Is this a Dvdrip? It dont looks like it. It has a logo of some sci-fi Tv channel on the corner down right. 

I am not at all an expert on this,
but the video qaulity is definitly not Dvd quality. Its rather bad I will say.  Unsharp and with distortions. Looks like an ordinary VHS recording from Tv to me.  "
,eXeQiEl,2010-04-09T19:18Z,"@minifrepper
you're right! it's a TV Rip, but certainly my release IS a DVDRip, 'cause the source was a DVD. A DVD Created by mcfly89, te original releaser. A fan who recompiled parts of the movie over the TV channels all over the world to make the DVD Release, an exquisite work indeed.

I invite you and ALL people seeing this comment and the above from minifrepper to take a look to the original torrent release, the mcfly89's one. Ther u can find a more explicit version of the story. Ther u can know what is all this ""Ulysses Cut"" about.

Don't be dissapointed for the release. And please ppl, READ. If u dont READ what r u downloading, i think u may be a real stupid person.

In the torrent i explain what i did, or tried to do.

READ READ READ the torrent info please.

And please visit http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4318490/Waterworld-_The_Ulysses_Cut for the original and best explained story about the ""Ulysses Cut"".

Greets to all
and sorry about the english"
[T],minifrepper,2010-04-10T21:33Z,"Ok I see. And I'm not complaining that much. It was infact watchable. And I thank you for the upload ..

My point is: writing ""Dvd-rip"" in the title are however misleading. I think you understand that. Who cares to read all the stuff written. We see the title, how many seeds and so on. and thats usually it.

So: if you wrote ""Tv-rip"" instead of ""Dvd-rip"" in the title, it would make better sense.  Comprende?  

Nobody cares what physical source you uploaded it from you know (Tv, Vhs, Dvd disc, hardisc etc). The kind of rip you announce it as in the title, should be what indicates the quality."
,eXeQiEl,2010-04-18T08:16Z,"got it! sorry. but i though it was a good title and explanation.

i got a little angry, cause these sites r full of idiot ppl. U definitely doesnt seem one now. And evone is telling, this game doestn work for me, this movie is a bad cam rip, and things like that.

I realise, not all r well trained in this technologies and/or his own hardware, and the general stuff about ""things"" and issues about the content all over the internet.

So i got postal, that was a little angry response.

Sorry, i apologise in public with u.

I realised what did u said, and in part u haver reason, but well...

thats the name i choosed at least.

,eXeQiEl,2010-05-22T20:45Z,"well the edition was not made by me.
Thanks for your release, i did saw it on fanedit.org before u posted here. Like the time i downloaded the mcfly89 version.
Now that u have a new one version, ill take it too, ill download, but unsure to seed it... have little space on hdd.

Thanks and for a bigger release of the mcfly89's version u can go to
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4318490/Waterworld-_The_Ulysses_Cut

thanks again.

,theguythatisme,2010-07-18T22:03Z,"Hey thanks for the cool torrent, I never download full-on DVDs (too much bandwidth)!
I can't seem to find the subtitles anywhere though, yet they seemed to be in macfly's DVD... any chance you could point me in the right direction? or rip them? (AutoGK can probably do it)
Cheers :)"
,eXeQiEl,2010-07-19T04:43Z,"wow, just coincidence, i wanted to see how's going my torrent, since i haven't did a month ago or so, and i find your comment. Right now im on a cleaning process with mi pc, so im not seeding, tellme if u want. And i'll reseed. Just tellme on this thread.

Indeed the original mcfly's edition doesnt have any sub but the comments one. And the comments are no more that some titles saying ""cut"" or stuff like that, indicating the sections that where cutted in the dvd edition. Or in the tv edition. They are no more than explicative stickers.

I have no problem on getting the torrent alive again. Just askme for that, ill be glad that someone is interested in this again.

Greets.
