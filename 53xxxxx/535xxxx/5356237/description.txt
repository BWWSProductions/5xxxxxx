========================================
Waterworld: The Ulysses Cut is a fan-made preservation of the extended cut of Waterworld which has been aired on television but never released on home video. Waterworld is a film notoriously re-cut by the studio after locking the director out of the editing room, and this preservation is an attempt to show some 40 minutes worth of material that was exised. 

To do this, a number of television broadcasts were compared and compiled with the goal of presenting the most complete version so far, including the extended television scenes as well as the original theatrical obscenities. A full break-down of the changes is available as a subtitle track on this DVD. 

This two-disc set has been made possible by the Original Trilogy forums (www.originaltrilogy.com), with particular contributions from ReverendBeastly, shepp74, and Jaiman Tuckuh.

The running times are as follows: 

Disc 1: 84 minutes 
Disc 2- 87 minutes 

Total Running Time: 171 minutes

========================================
Well, i decided to do this recodification of the work by mcfly89. U could think this may be a little bad for the mcfly89's torrent, cause this release is very much little than his. God! i was downloading it for 2 weeks i think. Now im an unconditional full seeder of that version too. It's a hard work to download. When i entered as a leecher, there was just 1 or 2 seeders, luckily this torrent seem to have bad and good times, like a rollercoaster. I was one that pushed up a little bit more the seeding box this time (january-february.2010). And we back again with that subject: the torrent is pretty big. 8 Gigabytes! Yes, it's because the work done by mcfly89, that include a very much (very much) sophisticated self made menu, bonus, and overall edition. I don't know how much took to compile and assemble the version we have here. But mcfly89 really rocks! So... again back with the subject: is pretty hard to download. This version only pretends to be an alternate and quick downloadable version. Obviously with loss of quality, in various aspects.


Again with my explanation: maybe this torrent will TOO lead people to see the extraordinary work by mcfly89. Some kind of propaganda/publicity.

BUT, don't be so cruel with my release. It isn't the best. I used a tutorial about doing the more balanced dvd rip recodification (below is the link, maybe it will be useful to somebody).

This release lacks the bonus and extensions. Some rare material that is worth to have. That's the reason that will (i hope) lead people to get the original "Ulysses Cut", the real-deal.

The quality wasn't the best. The mcfly89's is much better. Consider that this one is a recode from a version that is yet recoded and ripped from TV. Obviously with pretty good enhacement filters. mcfly did a great job again.

The resolution is the same. I attached some images of the same scenes to give u a quick idea and comparation about my own (poor quality) and mcfly's (high quality).

I attached the .agk log files, to let u know in detail how was encoded this release.






PS: Sorry about my bad english. It's the only one i have.
