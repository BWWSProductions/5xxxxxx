It's a guy named "Benny" calling this old man at a car lot called "Allied Motors" and it's hilarious. If you love to piss people off on the phone, like I do, then this is a MUST HAVE!!! There was also a movie made that was loosely based on this (believe it or not). It was called "The Corn Dog Man". It was pretty funny, but I have laughed so hard at this recording for the past 20 years that I damn near pass out (Actual results may vary...LOL). 

Pass this around to all your friends, because Benny deserves to be enjoyed again.

***This Mp3 was lifted from a tape, so there are still the characteristic hisses and pops, but you can still hear almost all of it. ***

Enjoy it, because I know I have...

Please seed....
