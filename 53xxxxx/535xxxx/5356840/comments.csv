,jwka211,2010-03-20T20:36Z,"Ok I downloaded it, so far it works apart from every time i start up the sim it says that I have to add PMDGOptions.DLL to the trusted list in the FSX.cfg file, all I do is delete the new entry made in the FSX.cfg file when ive already started the sim, but the thing is ive already got PMDGOptions.DLL in my trusted list, with the SHA1 code with it so why does it keep asking to add it?"
