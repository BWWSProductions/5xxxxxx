This is another AFI iTunes exclusive that is hard to find. I love AFI though so I want as many as possible to enjoy this wonderful album!

As all my albums are, it's pre-tagged with album art embedded into the music file and this one includes the above used picture as well. Buy AFI and keep the following strong!

Check out the new disc it's got less of the Havok scream but it's a very complete album and as did DUG and STS it gets better and better the more you listen to it.
