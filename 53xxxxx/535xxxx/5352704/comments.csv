I clicked again thinking it didn't load as it was slow. The first window said it was unregistered as per the instructions.  The SECOND window said it was licensed (looked in the ""about"" tab).  NEVER used the autoloader.  Closed it, restarted it, still licensed.  VIOLA!!!  working perfectly. "

Thank you once again for excellent torrent"
,RR92,2010-06-02T10:09Z,"First installed over old 1.9.8 version. Didn't quite work, so uninstalled the old Alcohol and installed the new one. Had to double-click the loader twice. Otherwise, it's good. Thank you for the upload."
,la_cross37,2010-06-07T22:09Z,"thank you so much! I just followed the instructions and it worked great! It took like 1 min to download and 1 min to install so it's extremely fast! And it's very simple.

(if your OS is vista or 7 and you get any error or it doesn't work try running the thing that gave you a error or repeat the hole procedure as administrator before you ask for help)

1: Run the installer (Alcohol120_retail_2.0.0.1331.exe) and install the program

2: Copy the patch (PatCh5121ML.exe) to your alcohol 120% installation folder and run it

3: I'm not sure if this is necessary but I copied the file ""AutoLoader_AxLaUn.exe"" to the alcohol 120% installation folder and then ran it

4: When you first start the application you may notice that it says that it's not registered but it will only say that the first time you use it, next time it will say that it's registered.

5: Done

Thanks for the UL!

I'm using windows 7 (32 bit)"
,kyledawg92,2010-06-10T06:54Z,"Thanks it worked great. Followed la_cross37's directions and it worked fine on Windows 7 64-bit.

,szeltolo_,2010-06-13T01:57Z,"Hey guys!
Just registered to ask a lame question. Just installed win 7 (32) on my laptop and after finding out that daemon tools doesn't work on win 7 I tried to find an alternative. I ended up with this torrent, seemed promising. But after I installed the app (following the instructions) it doesn't work. In the middle of the installation it asked for a reboot, no probs, I thought, it will create surely create the virtual drive than I can finally install some things. But it didn't create any virtual drive. 
The total commander can see my 2 partitions and the default dvd drive, but nothing else. Probably this is why there is no ""mount"" option after I finish the install/registration process.
Any helpful ideas? :)
Thanks in advance"

,mexmetalhead,2010-08-16T05:45Z,wow i just had the biggest adventure installing this. My computer kept rebooting with each install and so i had to reinstall Sptd which required me to mess with my registry and it was just too much fun! The torrent itself is flawless though! works great!
,anmisto,2010-08-23T07:40Z,it does not work as when i reboot the setup again does the same but it never installs i am not telling this torrent is bad but some problem with mine maybe bcoz i have 2 users

Any ideas? I followed the instructions to the letter, actually tried it 3 times from scratch and each time I am getting the same issue. "
,Illu5S5,2010-11-03T06:56Z,"Fast Torrent.
Great upload.
Software Installed per instructions !

The problem is I downloaded a game torrent, which has 2 files.
A MDF file (621mb) and a MDS file (486kb). Now How to mount and install these files?

Plzz help somebody !!"
,7sd3,2010-12-07T16:58Z,"I think I got blocked as well. I had mine installed and it was working great, but then I was trying to use it just now and it said that it does not support trial and mine is unregistered. Mine used to work great before. I uninstalled, deleted registry and went back to re-install and same problem. 

""This version of Alcohol 120% does not support any trial period. You must enter a valid serial numbered to activate this version. Alcohol will now shutdown.""

@capum at 2010-06-26 15:34 CET:
Would you check out http://www.alcohol-soft.com/ after installing torrent content. It was only me who get blocked??

The website does not work for me. "
,7sd3,2010-12-08T16:14Z,I gave up and went to Alcohol 7 -120% . I do not know if they blocked me on this one. 
,SearinoxNavras,2011-01-01T14:17Z,"That has got to be one of the dumbest most stupid comments I've seen. Oh poor frustrated user believing the Alcohol website blocked him for pirating their product, without a single clue that something like this NEVER happens.

The sweet sweet irony is that the crack adds the alcohol website addreses in the windows hosts file, thereby blocking the entire machine from accessing it. This is done in order to prevent serial and update checking and allow the cracked install to stay untouched.

And here he is, the poor soul, frustrated by an inexistent punishment which is actually a protection put up by the crack itself."
,SearinoxNavras,2011-01-01T14:18Z,Moron. The block is the crack itself having added the website to the hosts file to prevent alcohol from validating the serial online.
[T],razalgul1979,2011-02-23T21:51Z,This alcohol worked perfect for me both in xp and in Win7 great upload thanks

,Aquosus,2011-12-08T03:19Z,"Actually I just ran into this problem.  I've had it installed and working perfectly since October of 2010 and now today its not allowing me to run it.  Tried recracking as per the instruction but to no avail.  Verified that its blocked through the hosts file, not sure what caused this to trigger all of a sudden.  Any insight or ideas on how to fix this would be appreciated. "

,Franpa,2012-03-01T06:45Z,"This download contains multiple files infected with viruses, however the Alcohol 120% installer and the Crack file both came up clean. So the important stuff is clean and every other file included should be avoided at all costs."
,Franpa,2012-03-01T06:58Z,"https://www.virustotal.com/file/780788d17ea8ff33abac434f7624f97d33ff215d43d53f59b27739e5e01ca0d9/analysis/1330580852/

13/43 say it is a keygen (Obvious result), 5/43 heuristic (guess) results, 5/43 suggest an infection of some sort.

So 18/43 don't say it is definitely infected with a virus, 20/43 say it isn't infected at all, 5 report it is definitely infected with a virus."
,KoiRana,2012-03-29T22:46Z,file works perfectly thanks
,ReIVIeDy,2012-07-18T19:52Z,"When installing, I get a message that simply says, ""Internal setup error. Contact support."" Perhaps this does work on Win7, but does it work on Win7 x64???"
