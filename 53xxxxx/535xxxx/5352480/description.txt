RELEASE NOTES

Props to the other group for putting out the initial rls...

Unfortunately, Interscope did some weird things and only made the explicit
available online and through 1 country, Australia, which is ironic because
they are actually going through that Internet filtering nonsense (Support
Network Neutrality!). The Cat.  for the explicit is 2730473 if anyone wants
to go pick buy it at shops... We went through hell figuring out where this
explicit exists so we figured we might save you the hassle of searching
months... And if you want some hot artwork, we have 1200dpi scans available
on request (They total 300MB).

The other release has 3 tracks censored. Notably in Bad Romance at 02m29s,
Because Im a free bitch baby, Monster at 00m57s We might have fucked not
really sure, and Dance In The Dark at 00m40s, Baby Im a free bitch, among
many others.

Thanks Interscope for all this mess! Team VAG has now collectively bought
this album 5 times (and probably more...).

My personal favorites in this EP include So Happy I Could Die (pls2next
single!!), Alejandro, the already singled out Bad Romance and Telephone, and
Monster in that order :D.

Enjoy the amazing Lady GaGa, she is really a legit artist...have you seen
this girl play piano? WOW! Not to mention her crafty lyrics...

Initially planned solely as a standard double-disc reissue in the wake of the
blockbuster success of The Fame, Lady Gaga decided to release the new
material as a separate EP called The Fame Monster in addition to the standard
two-CD set, where its tacked onto a now standardized version of her debut.
Its a nice move for fans, plus it helps emphasize the new material, which
does act as a bridge from the debut to a forthcoming full-length. Everything
on The Fame Monster bears a galvanized Eurotrash finish, as evident on the
heavy steel synths of Bad Romance and the updated ABBA revision
Alejandro, as it is on the rock & roll ballad Speechless  its big
guitars lifted from Noel Gallagher  and the wonderful, perverse march
Teeth. Even the stuttering splices on Telephone, a duet with Beyonc,
leans to the other side of the Atlantic, which just emphasizes the otherness
thats become Gagas calling card. And even as shes becoming omnipresent,
with her songs mingling with those who co-opt her on the radio, she is still
slightly skewed, willing to go so far over the top she goes beyond camp, yet
still channeling it through songs that are written, not just hooks. The Fame
Monster builds upon those strengths exhibited on The Fame, offering a
credible expansion of the debut and suggesting shes not just a fleeting pop
phenomenon.
