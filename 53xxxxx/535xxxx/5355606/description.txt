Jason Bermas sits in today while Alex is on assignment. 

Bermas talks with Richard Reeves, the host of "Frontline Texas," in-studio at the Infowars command center. Reeves confronted Texas governor Rick Perry recently on the shut down of the Texas Gun Shows event in Austin, Texas. 




Jason covers the news and takes a number of calls.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume support or endorsement on my
 part of all contents. 

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
