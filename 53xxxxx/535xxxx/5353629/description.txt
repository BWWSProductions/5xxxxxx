After a few P2P releases of the R5 for the newest vampire film â€œDaybreakersâ€ and now here is the scene release from CAMELOT. I havent had a chance to check out the P2P R5 releases that have been floating around but this one looks and sounds like some pretty decent quality.



Itâ€™s 2017, and the undead far outnumber the living in this horror film starring Oscar nominee Ethan Hawke (TRAINING DAY). A virus has spread across the earth, turning its inhabitants into vampiresâ€¦. Ten years after a plague turns most of the worldâ€™s population into vampires, a critical blood shortage causes panic and gruesome mutations among the reanimated. Edward (Ethan Hawke), a vampire hematologist, tries to develop a blood substitute when he meets Lionel (Willem Dafoe) and Audrey (Claudia Karvan), two fugitive humans who claim to have a possible cure. Edward casts his lot with them in the hope of perfecting the cure before itâ€™s too late.
