Tonightâ€™s Show: The Road to Serfdom at 8pm ET

On my Fox Business show tonight at 8pm and 11pm ET, we take a long look down the Road to Serfdom. F.A. Hayek, an Austrian economist living in Britain, wrote "The Road to Serfdom" in 1944 as a warning that central economic planning would extinguish freedom. The book was a hit.

But then, as now, Hayek was overshadowed by another economist: John Maynard Keynes. Keynes believed that governments could manage the economy by taxing heavily when the economy was good and spending like crazy when times were bad.

Both economists died years agoâ€¦but their ideas are still debated today. In fact, George Mason University economist Russ Roberts and director John Papola created this music video, a â€œbattle rapâ€ of sorts, waged between the ghosts of F.A. Hayek and John Maynard Keynes:

I think Hayek was onto something. Governments can't plan economies without planning people's lives. The scientific-sounding language of President Obama's Keynesian economic planning hides the fact that people must shelve their own plans in favor of government's single plan.
