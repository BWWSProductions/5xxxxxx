,clauge,2010-02-12T02:22Z,thank you mg!
,ronfezhead,2010-02-12T02:23Z,MG why u steal my files and rename them? I'll just stop posting them 
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-12T02:48Z,"HOLY FUCK. Alright people, no more R&F posted from me. Someone else needs to take care of it, you can thank the pussy uploaders with sand in their vaginas. You think you're a fucking genius because you're the only magician on the planet who can record and rip a show M-F? It's not fucking rocket science, I do it too. Take my ""work"" and put it everywhere and say you did it who fucking cares - AS LONG AS SOMEONE IS LISTENING TO O&A THAT I RIPPED, RECODED AND EDITED IT'S A WIN FOR O&A. 

Is there any single person who has downloaded a R&F episode that I have uploaded who didn't realize that the file wasn't originating from ME? The only ""renaming"" I do is pulling the ""-"" to keep it consistent. I'm not removing anything that credits nor adding anything that takes it. It's RON AND FEZ who should get any and all credit. 

Fuck off you self righteous asshole, how's that for ""credit""?"
,clauge,2010-02-12T03:19Z,"MG, You always give props to ""Darth"", so I don't know what the big deal is? 

@ ronfezhead, Why go through the trouble of upping something if you don't want anyone to listen to it? I don't get it..."
,jonesy485,2010-02-12T04:21Z,"Hey Goose fuck this guy he probably is just busting balls, if not then whats the point of file sharing. You are my source for Ron and Fez and O&A so please don't stop! You make the week so much better. I never comment but i thought i had to this time."
,bloodyjimbonney,2010-02-12T05:56Z,"don't listen to the haters goose, you brighten up everyone's day"
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-12T06:12Z,"No, he's not busting balls. I was contacted about this a few days ago. I couldn't believe it, actually. Fuck it, last R&F upped by mg56. Sorry buddays - it's not worth the bullshit. 

They go up in the O&A newsgroup (alt.binaries.opie-and-anthony) or at bmt.com (private tracker). Google for the torrents that bite and have fun with the whining sand-in-pussy credit-whores. 

Someone cue Steve Jobs: ""YOU'RE STEALING FROM US!!!!!!!"""
,fag69,2010-02-12T07:43Z,ronfezhead please go lay down in oncoming traffic. Stop bitchin and start dying!
,shocxxx,2010-02-12T10:49Z,"a sad day for buddays everywhere :'(. guess i gotta sit through all the shitty commercials now, well thanks for posting R&F as long as you did goose. and to the stupid fuckhead who made you stop posting, i hope you get a visit from Ted Scheklers hat removal service and then you die of cancer before the wedding of a relative."
,clauge,2010-02-12T15:17Z,"I appreciate you doing it for as long as you did, goosey. 

It's a shame it's ending b/c ronfezhead got his itty bitty wittle feelings hurt over something so gay. Do you need a hug from mommy?

,rubygrape,2010-02-12T19:54Z,"I created an account just do say thanks MG.  I love ron and fez, but can't afford an XM subscription right now.  MG, your ups are well appreciated.  Those who complain need to sit on a spiked dildo and commence a 360 spin.  "
,jonesy485,2010-02-13T00:51Z,come on budday fuck the haters keep on posting Ron and fez! I cant figure this newsgroup shit out......im very dumb.
,rubygrape,2010-02-13T01:48Z,"Is there anyway to get a seed for the 11/04/2009 show?  I need help, buddies.  Please don't be homoqueersickles.  "
,robotbela,2010-02-13T02:03Z,"MG56, please reconsider.  I don't think you know how many RF fans you help daily.   Personally, i pay for XM and still download this because it's just a better way to listen to the buddays.

Don't let these douchebags ruin it.  You are greatly appreciated."
,bloodyjimbonney,2010-02-13T02:12Z,"I agree, help a-- never mind. just keep up the good work. Lots of us appreciate it"

,robotbela,2010-02-13T03:14Z,Really appreciate the file.  But what's the plan for Monday's show?
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-13T04:46Z,"> Is there anyway to get a seed for the 11/04/2009 show?

I can't help you, I've been deleting these R&F files so no archives from me. I only kept R&F going because drdumb left - but I'm sure one of the buddays here can hook you up. I have decided to use another source and keep upping R&F. Not sure if it will affect when I can get them up but I plan to still do it daily. "
,robotbela,2010-02-13T06:57Z,"MG56,  youu win the beanie cup award for keeping this going."
