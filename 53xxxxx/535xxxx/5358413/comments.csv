,jonesy485,2010-02-13T01:44Z,come on budday fuck the haters keep on posting Ron and fez! I cant figure this newsgroup shit out......im very dumb. 
,fag69,2010-02-13T02:08Z,"we're all stealing from O&A and R&F, so fuck anyone in their stinkwrinkle if they think the audio or credit belongs to them.  keep up the lord's work MG."
,bloodyjimbonney,2010-02-13T02:09Z,thanks buddy
,bloodyjimbonney,2010-02-13T02:14Z,"ps, I have a sub, but my signal sucks at home. so this is really helpful in getting the shows I'm not in my car for"
,ronfezhead,2010-02-13T02:58Z,"I don't want credit, mothergoose. That is totally not the issue. Quit trying to make it about you.
Why do you have to change the filenames and delete the tags? You change the hash so they can't be seeded anywhere else. I would help you seed here so it could get out quicker, but I can't because you've made the files different for no good reason. Why should there be two files for the same show floating around that are bit for bit identical as far as the audio is concerned, but are different because somebody (you) had to personalize them?

Leave them alone so MORE people can share them. "

[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-13T03:43Z,"I originally deleted the tags because they F up some ipods, and because the 64k's I've upped here have never had them. I'm going for consistency, sometimes you're upping 128k's so I recode them when you do. Sometimes they're 22Khz, sometimes 44.1 - sometimes I adjust the volume from show to show when they jump for consistency as well. I'm not doing anything maliciously as far as the ""hash"" goes, it's just the end result. Don't worry about it, I'm not upping them anymore. Problem solved.

The Lazlow situation was completely different. For the 400th time, I did not upload Lazlow's ""box set"" - most of what I upped came straight from his damn website. It was a dead fucking torrent until he mentioned it and brought it attention. He wanted it taken down, I did - end of story. I'm sure he sold more ""box sets"" with his woe-is-me sob story to more than counter any sales damage he claims I did. Oh, is EA laying people off? That fucking behemoth that destroys and ruins almost every small studio it inhales? Boo hoo. "
,ruthlessrl,2010-02-13T06:21Z,thanks
,shocxxx,2010-02-13T06:53Z,"RonFezhead you FUCKING MORON, don't you see everyone hates you because of how fucking stupid you are?? the torrents MG posts download JUST FUCKING FINE AND FAST every single day. the show will get out to the same amount of people, it wont matter if he deletes the tags or takes a ""-"" out of the title you dumb twat, if someone really wants to DL the show they will and the fucking name of the torrent/tags wont stop them. we don't need your precious fucking seed you narcissistic aids face"
,go_yukuri,2010-02-14T06:48Z,"Haters leave. MG, anything is good for those of us that can't access the show overseas.  Never picky and always appreciated budday."
,nicdip,2010-02-14T18:02Z,"Thank you for the Ron and Dave Show uploads Goose. And anyone else involved.... thank you too.
Keep turning the world onto R&F and O&A"
,TokenWGuy,2010-02-16T00:35Z,"I want to thank MotherGoose for recording these and uploading them with her own time and money. Some of us here loved listening to O&A until CBS kicked them off. And for those of you who bitch about not owning a XM player I say, ""fuck you."" These times are hard on our wallets and not everyone has the money to subscribe. "
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-16T00:44Z,"Heads up people 02-15 O&A and R&F were ""best ofs"". As typical for O&A, for some goddamn reason they like to start the Best of (worst of) apparently 10 minutes early and I have no proper intro. I heard R&F was just a replay of Fridays show. What I'm gonna do is try to grab the 8pm O&A replay to get the intro. Then I will upload the O&A show and check out what I have for R&F. If R&F is just Fridays show I won't bother with it - if not I'll up it. Don't expect anything until probably 8:30 / 9pm est tonight. "
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-16T02:07Z,"02-15-10 Opie and Anthony was a replay of the ""Worst of Comedians"" show
from 08-21-09. It was the Worst of Louie CK hosted by CSK. Rather than 
re-torrent it - you can get it here:
