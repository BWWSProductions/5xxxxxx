,ComTA,2010-02-13T02:27Z,What I find more interesting is how did you manage to make it work on M33-6...ive been trying for ages...can you help me?
,whizdakid,2010-02-13T02:28Z,please don't cap your speed...will need more seeders to get this going....
,whizdakid,2010-02-13T02:33Z,This version has been patched for 5.00 M33-6 from a disclosed source...have not tried on GEN versions yet...
,ComTA,2010-02-13T05:11Z,"dude, are you positive it works with 5.00? cause i dont want to download it for nothing..."
,whizdakid,2010-02-13T23:38Z,lmao...yes man it does....I hosted this torrent on lots of different sites and it all worked for them also...
,kingmathyou,2010-02-15T18:43Z,"Tested and works on 5.50 GEN-D3, but can't play online due to psn. There is currently no psnabler for this game either? Anyway we can play this online and pass psn? "
,hotmixtech,2010-02-17T01:01Z,This is in fact a working iso of Fireteram Bravo 3 and confirming it does work on 5.00m33. 100% works. It is the Japanese game us navy seals portable but in english text and voice throughout the game. Just wanted to let you all know because I know I was skeptical of this one.
,hotmixtech,2010-02-17T01:03Z,I also meant to say it does say Fireteam Bravo 3 in the text of game also. Just so you know. 
,hotmixtech,2010-02-17T01:04Z,THANKYOU VERY MUCH WHIZDAKID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
