,Bujaaa,2010-02-10T17:21Z,No shit Strikefear13? I did google it. What i meant to say can someone upload Mass Effect 2  DLC for X360 on this site. Because i found it only on paying sites. And if i wanted to pay for games i would buy them.

For installation
you either need to buy a Xecuter CK3 Pro with sata/360 hdd adapter or disassemble your 360 drive and plug into pc and use xplorer360 or xport, and a jtagged xbox!"
