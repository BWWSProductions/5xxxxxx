         From building cutting-edge competition venues to the          
         latest sports science training, winter sports use more        
         technology than ever. This episode takes you behind the       
         scenes of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter games. Olympic    
         organizers race against the clock to build venues, expand     
         transportation and security, and add futuristic touches to    
         the ultimate Olympic icon--the Olympic torch. Meanwhile,      
         US Olympic hopefuls use high-tech training tools to gain      
         a competitive edge. Take in breathtaking views from the       
         world's highest unsupported gondola and rocket down a         
         bobsled track at 80 miles per hour, as we show you winter     
          sports like you've never seen them before.
