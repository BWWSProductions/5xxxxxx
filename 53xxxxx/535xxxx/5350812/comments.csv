,stev666,2010-02-10T10:33Z,uploading at 40kbps thats max for my connection
,poet123,2010-02-10T11:05Z,"out of the 470 peers in the swarm, I am connected to 48 and it seems we are all stuck at 92.6% There appear to be three seeds, but are they not working? Is there a way to tell if the torrent will ever finish? :("
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-10T11:25Z,"@poet:

a) Nope, there is 288 true peers in the swarm. Rest are gremlins. Similar IP, same word in the host-name. Block them with firewall. Use PeerBlock.

b) Whole swarm currently has ONE AND A HALF file. So, share it. If there is too many hard-fisting, I would delete the torrent and remove Lost from any consideration.

If you or anyone else have no idea what I've just said, probably my answer to question ""When we could finish"" is clear enough:

- ""Probably never."""
,stev666,2010-02-10T12:18Z,seems its getting better as the torrent is now on 98% and only 4min remaining on the download
,the_shroud,2010-02-10T14:24Z,"please please please don't ""...remove Lost from any consideration...."""
,cpsgirl,2010-02-11T02:14Z,Thank you for the tips and for all  your great programs.
,huntermckiller,2010-02-12T02:04Z,is uTorrent really that much better than Azureus? Why would people b& you from a torrent simply for using it?
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-13T15:55Z,"@huntermckiller: ROFL... I am sure that you haven't understood a word from my text.

Believe me, our misunderstanding is mutual."
