Product Description:
"Animal Crossing: Let's Go to the City" lets players move into a fun community populated by quirky animals. Players can improve their community, chat with the locals or just spend the day fishing and collecting fossils. There is also the opportunity to catch a bus into the new urban city area. Though you'll never see other players in the city, you can connect with them in new ways using WiiConnect24, such as bidding on your friends' items at the auction house or visiting the Happy Room Academy headquarters to see the top-rated player house. Another new feature in "Animal Crossing: Let's Go to the City" is the ability to visit friends' towns and chat with one another using the new WiiSpeak microphone.
