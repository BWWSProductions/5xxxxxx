This film contains nudity, sexual situations and jokes so bad, they actually hurt.

Yes, itâ€™s Shakespeare with skin in this outrageously bawdy, sexed-up version of the worldâ€™s most famous love story, THE SECRET SEX LIVES OF ROMEO AND JULIET! Join us in merry old London where, with apologies to The Bard, a crackpot cast (of mostly busty redheads) give a performance "to match the spirit of the lusty and ribald times portrayed." The result is an immortal tale of two lovers who end up loving just about everyone amidst a non-stop barrage of dumb jokes, nudity, rambunctious sex scenes, a lyrical lesbian interlude, whipping, whipped cream, Derrick the Horny Hunchback, and literatureâ€™s most famous single line of dialogue, "Sock it to me!" No, itâ€™s not the Shakespeare learned in school, but itâ€™s exactly what youâ€™d expect from producer Harry Novak (Please Donâ€™t Eat My Mother!) and the director of The Daughter of Fanny Hill.  As one of the cast members so succinctly puts it, "Willy never wrote THIS!" 

Plus: Eager to satiate his sexual appetite, fat slob Caesar sends Marc Antony to bring THE NOTORIOUS CLEOPATRA back to Rome. But though heâ€™s ordered to keep his hands to himself, Antony quickly falls under the Queenâ€™s spell (no surprise since sheâ€™s played by the black and beautiful Sonora), which leads to a virgin sacrifice, an Egyptian orgy, the Ides of March, a shocker of an ending, and a complete skewering of history in this wacky Harry Novak sex comedy which wonâ€™t be playing on the History Channel anytime soon!
