Stronghold Crusader Extremeâ€™s gameplay is a seamless combination of city building and real-time strategy. You are put in the armor of a fearless warlord during the Crusades and as sovereign of your own people, your goal is to â€œLead, Conquer, and Expandâ€. Defend your kingdom against invading forces with new tactical powers like commanding reinforcements, bombardments and healing. New maps also allow for brand-new, more ambitious conquests.
