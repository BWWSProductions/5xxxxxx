Combining three prevalent genres of the dayâ€”the student comedy, the salaryman film, and the domestic dramaâ€”Ozu created this warmhearted family comedy, and demonstrated that he was truly coming into his own as a cinema craftsman. The setup is simple: Low wageâ€“earning dad Okajima is depending on his bonus, and so are his wife and children, yet payday doesnâ€™t exactly go as planned. Exquisite and economical, Ozuâ€™s film alternates between brilliantly mounted comic sequences and heartrending working-class realities.
