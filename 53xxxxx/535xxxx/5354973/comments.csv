come on people."
,razzell2,2010-03-07T14:15Z,"waiting for download to finish.

im just wondering...here is the uploaders tag line...""NOT MUCH TO SAY IT'S AN HNH RIPP!  MEANS GOOD QUALITY NOT SOME AMRC SHIT !""

ok, thats cool, but why is this uploaded by ""anonymous"", and why is there no link or www for HARDNHEAVY uploads?

just curious.  ok, my dl is done.  let me do an av scan and do a quality check....brb.

clean virus scan!  mp3 files. all but 1 tune is @320 bitrate.
tunes sound good.

Champion in me is missing, but maybe that wasnt recorded when this release came out.

good stuff!  A quality all 'round!

Thanks for the share"
