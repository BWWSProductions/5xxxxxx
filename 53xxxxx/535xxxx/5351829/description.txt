24 Hour Party People: What the Sleeve Notes Never Tell You (2002)
by Tony Wilson

This is the bizarre and not entirely fabricated story of the founder of the Factory record label, Anthony Wilson. Part fiction, part reality, comic and tragic by turns, Wilson tells his own unique story in his own unique way for the very first time. From the dawn of punk to the death of acid house, Anthony Wilson was at the center of it all. Love him or hate him, you can't possibly ignore him. Includes numerous black & white and color photographs. Based on the movie screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce.
