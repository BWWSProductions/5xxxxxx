,jazpenguin,2010-05-26T01:29Z,I keep getting the disc authorization error...I don't know how to make it work. D: Any help?
,AnnVdB,2010-11-21T06:50Z,"It keeps saying I have to enter disc 3: ambitions.
Please help with this, will be much appreciated!"
,AnnVdB,2010-11-21T07:05Z,"Never mind!!!! Fixed it.
The game was installed in another folder than I saved it. So I went to the right installation folder, and clicked on sims 3, then ""game"" and then ""bin"" and there I copy the crack from sims 3.
I did the same for ambitions etc...
Andnow it works.
Thx!"
