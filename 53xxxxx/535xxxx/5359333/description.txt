Release Notes:



2009 collection from the American rockers led by Jakob Dylan.
Collected features 14 classic tracks taken from their albums, plus
two previously unreleased recordings. Includes the hits 'One
Headlight,' '6th Avenue Heartache,' 'Three Marlenas,' and more.
Mixing introspective singer-songwriter sensibilities with a
commitment to genuine Roots Rock, The Wallflowers sold more than
eight million copies of their catalog, topped the Billboard
charts, scored a multiplatinum album, several Modern Rock hits,
two Grammyr awards and a legion of fans. Collected: 1996-2005 is
the definitive look at a critically-acclaimed favorite of the past
decade, whose tales of disillusionment and perseverance were
wrapped in a sound both gritty and polished, melancholy and
aggressive.
