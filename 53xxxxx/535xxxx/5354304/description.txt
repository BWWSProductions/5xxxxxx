This is Mattix's 2010 version of the original Beach Boys' 'SMiLE' album in stereo. This appears to be the best sounding and flowing mix yet to be made, and it contains what is probably the closest thing to a crisp, stereo recording of 'Good Vibrations' that we'll probably ever see. This was made using Brian Wilson's 2004 version as a model.

This album is, in my opinion, even better than Pet Sounds, and should be heard by anyone with an open mind. Please seed!
