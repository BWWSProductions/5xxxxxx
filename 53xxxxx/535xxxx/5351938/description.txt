You will work with your higher self and the guides to open your channel
upward to the highest dimensions of your self, to your soul and Spirit. Open your third eye to see life through the eyes of your soul, to better know what choices and decisions will put you on a higher path. 

Bring your soul's light into your body, mind, and emotions, into your nervous and circulatory systems, and into your chakras.  As you do you can awaken your spiritual potential, align with your spiritual path, connect with Higher Will, and accelerate your journey to enlightenment.

Orin teaches that you can grow through joy rather than struggle, that abundance is available to everyone, and that the most important step you can take on your path is to connect with your Source, with soul, spirit, and Divine Self.  Orin realizes that growth is like a spiral, where you will visit some issues again and again, albeit at a higher and more subtle level each time. Spiritual growth is like a dance of being and becoming.  As you read, choose those courses that stand out to you and call to your heart as your possible next steps. 

Greetings from Orin!
Throughout the years I have been offering a path to awakening, to Self-Realization. The purpose of all my work is union with the Divine, with the All-That-Is, with God/Goddess. All my courses have been to assist you in realizing the Divine Self as who you are, to awaken you to your true identity.
