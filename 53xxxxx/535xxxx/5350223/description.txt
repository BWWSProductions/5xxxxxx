         Lux is suspended from school, and Cate attempts to get the    
         principal to give her a second chance, but her efforts may    
         make things worse; Baze is insulted when he finds out Cate    
          is hosting a radio event at the bar across the street.

         They don't like us so much that the reencoded our pre (or     
         ORENJI, same source) to "proper" us. Anyway, that shit        
         is already nuked for stolen source, so here's a repack        
         without the commercial. And for good measure, screenshot      
          comparisons showing the identical frame positioning. FQM is   
         with the commercial trimmed out to match what they did.
