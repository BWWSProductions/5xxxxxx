I own program AiTB. It works.
I know everything abot my father?? or can you trace links for me?
How do I speak with him?
Is there a special site? And how to get it with the explanation?
Does each file has its own tracking links such as links to the file tracking programs differ from the sound files?
And how they practice operational and non-blocked or closed or Alsalehytha finished?
I know all my father Mai_khas tracking links A to Z "".
Orjod and reply as soon as
Thank you very much!

/Your son."

If you don't trust him don't dl,

But i highly recommend AiTB's..
Not much hazze.. xD"
,intobearzz,2010-03-19T22:02Z,THIS IS A FUCKIN AD! DO NOT BELIEVE THIS CRAP! DON'T EVEN THINK OF DL THIS. TAKES YOU TO A SHADY AD'S!
,TheDarkLight,2010-03-23T17:06Z,"@intobearzz 

Thats because you clicked the giant ""Download"" image instead of the ""Download this Torrent"" text. The Download button image is a shady add, but it actually has nothing to do with the download nor was it placed here by AiTB. Try watching where you click next time."
,chuckmamuck,2010-04-01T10:33Z,"i bet ""intobearzz"" clicks everything on sites except the links he wants.
i bet he got ripped in 4 weeks, has the whitest teeth from knowing the 1 secret rule for white teeth, has an evony account without knowing it and clicks links for webcam sessions with women named fat slapper rubs clit on ya nose.
i'll just click the biggest brightest flashing links and collect thousands of tracking cookies. nice move. i bet he couldnt see the link to the torrent from all the ad popups on his browser page. "

,bembus,2010-08-17T14:42Z,"thanks a lot!!! but, i downloaded it, it worked but the next day said that is not genuine...what can i do?? help me please?"
,llewyn,2010-08-29T05:21Z,I don't want to sound dumb but can someone explain how to install this? I downloaded it and burned a disk from the iso image. There are also other files and folders besides the iso. What do I do with them? Tried to boot from the iso but did not work. What is the procedure? Thanks!
,Amberrrr,2010-09-14T15:31Z,"I am trying to use the USB tool to get windows 7 onto my net book because it only came with starter. I dl'd the ""Microsoft_Windows_7_Ultimate_Retail(Final)...before because it had more seeders but the tool told me it WASN'T A VALID ISO...was just wondering if anyone knows anything about that program I don't want to have to buy an external cd drive, some help would be awesome. I will dl this one now.

Thanks in advance"
