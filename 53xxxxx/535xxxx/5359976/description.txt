For the artist, designing characters is probably one of the most exciting parts of
creating video games. If you are new to this aspect of video-game development,
welcome. I hope you have a wonderful time using your imagination to create
many fantastic video-game characters and creatures. If you have already explored
video gameâ€“character development, then I hope this book will give you added
information in that area.

As you can see from the title of this book, it is devoted to covering the development
and animation of video-game characters in detail. There is enough basic level
material in the book for even the raw beginner to get a good foundation
in character development. Also included are some more advanced character creation
and animation techniques. Hopefully, this book will be a good allaround
resource for you and your artistic development.
