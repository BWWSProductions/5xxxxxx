,QoMSoL,2010-02-11T12:37Z,"Since BillBourne ain't coming back (as expected) with his comment on the quality I'll give you the info.

The quality is ""You can watch and fully enjoy"" but not 10/10. Good for the first view, so-so for the collection.
The movie itself is great just like the first part. And judging from how it ends we might just see a part 3 in future. But for that fellas (remember this) you have to buy it (pay for it). Or we're never getting the next part!

And for the uploader: Thank you, man! But do you really have to put those religious links in here? I mean make a damn .txt file or something. Enough zombies out there as it is."
,Hunterdad,2010-02-11T13:48Z,"whats the quality like?  anyone know?  thanks downloader, muchly appeciated.  Canada"
,BillBourne,2010-02-11T14:20Z,"LoL sorry for the late follow up comment...

Thanks uploader your an awesome dude/dudette for getting this up"

,DaNtsu,2010-02-11T15:54Z,"Excuse me, but what does PPV stand for? pay-per-view? What does that have to do with a scr?"
,therealjdb,2010-02-11T19:54Z,Thaaaaaaaaaaaank you!!! I've been waiting for an upload of this since it came out!!!
,godlullaby,2010-02-11T22:07Z,Very bad directing. But see for yourself. 
,gladizh,2010-02-11T23:17Z,"@godlullaby
I simply don't care about it, why? Because this movie is so well written, so well done and i just loved every minute of it. 

Boondock Saints 2 is the best movie i have ever seen, im going to watch it every day for 2 weeks. "
,Flopis,2010-02-11T23:35Z,"Been waiting for this one.
10xs m8!"
,lancaster3961986,2010-02-12T00:01Z,thank god finally its here ray ur the shit fukn a its about damn time i think everyone will agree with me this should have went to theatres all along
,LiquidInsanity,2010-02-12T04:53Z,"Why are there so many files? you watch 10 minutes at a time or something? just curious, new to Torrenting. "
,KDP1985,2010-02-12T05:13Z,"@LiquidInsanity  Get Winrar.  Once that is installed and the movie is down loading simply double click one of the files.  Click and drag whats inside the window that pops up onto your Desktop and it'll extract the whole file for you.


And to the uploader...if this is real (still have my doubts) i will name my first child after you"
,fluffypuss,2010-02-12T07:41Z,thank you so much 
,Alzarath,2010-02-12T09:04Z,Oh my god... I was starting to think All Saints Day was fake... Thank you for this!

,Oztheboss,2010-02-12T13:26Z,"A - 8, V - 8

M - 3


The acting and writing is crap, I think. It doesn't feel at all as epic and awe-inspiring as the first one. I was disappointed."
,torrenti,2010-02-12T14:26Z,"""RAR"" alert. I am still hoping a day will come where people at the bay stop rarring movies.
Before you start calling me everything your mother forbid you to say let me explain that when I unrar the files, I delete them to free up space hence not sharing the movie...."
,euphorical80,2010-02-12T14:45Z,"omg i was just lookin for this yesterday , u are a god."

,jordfot,2010-02-13T12:01Z,"Do yourselves a favor, Do NOT download this movie! the quality together with the lame acting will ruin the first movie. 
The quality looks like a CAM but its not, its worse. compared to the first movie the actors are a f***ing joke!"
,zontey,2010-02-13T14:15Z,"anyone konw eng sub (srt) for this one!?
Thanks for the UpL man!"
[T],SiRsMoKeAlOt0420,2010-02-13T17:28Z,"fuckin bad ass flick, ready for the sequel."
[T],SiRsMoKeAlOt0420,2010-02-13T17:29Z,worth downloading!!
,QoMSoL,2010-02-14T10:34Z,"Fuck the assholes that say the movie sucks. Simply fuck 'em. And fuck those who say it's a VHS rip, clearly bitches never even seen a VHS. 
The movie is great. And remember it's part TWO not ONE so stop bitchin' about it being worse than first (which it isn't). Fans of the movie enjoy, faggots cry and bitch around!

If you really need a quality rating here you go: 7/7 for both V & A. Perfectly watchable. Ain't no camrip."
,K6FF9,2010-02-16T00:48Z,^^^ you think any of us are gonna visit your shitty fucking site? I'd like to visit you you little fucktard. I swear if I could catch one of you spamming bastards I would choke you with my bare hands until you stopped breathing - you little cunt.
,xWiccedx,2010-03-08T00:04Z,Said something about haiti. . . fuck haiti.  Its their own damn fault their buildings were made so shitty.. Just got back from there.  They are all lazy pieces of crap.
