The Gibson Brothers are a France based musical group, who had their greatest success during the disco boom of the late 1970s, and are best known for their hit single, "Cuba".
The three brothers, Chris (born 20 June 1960) - (lead vocals, percussion), Patrick (vocals, drums) and Alex (vocals, keyboards) were born on Martinique in the West Indies. They recorded their first single "Come To America" in Paris in 1976, and both it and its follow-up "Non Stop Dance" made the charts in Europe, where they toured successfully. The following year they released "Heaven", which was picked up by TK Records in the U.S.

In 1978 they recorded "Cuba". The mix of disco beats, Latin percussion, soulful vocals and a catchy tune propelled the song to #1 in several countries, and earned them four gold records worldwide. In the UK it made #41 on its initial release, and #12 when reissued in 1980. Like their other hits, it was written and produced by Daniel Vangarde and the Belgian producer Jean Kluger, who also recorded hits by Ottawan, Sheila B. Devotion and others. Vangarde (aka Daniel Bangalter) is the father of Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk.

The Gibson Brothers had three further big hits in 1979 and 1980, "Ooh What A Life", "Que Sera Mi Vida" (which sold over 5 million copies worldwide), and "Mariana". They have continued to record and tour worldwide.

These Gibson Brothers are not to be confused with another Gibson Brothers, a New York based country music and bluegrass group.
