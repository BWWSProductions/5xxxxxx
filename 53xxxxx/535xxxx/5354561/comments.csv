,UncookedWaffle,2010-02-13T04:57Z,"Seems to work fine, just one small thing however.
After I unRAR'd it and moved the files to the directories, when I start up the game, there was a notification of ambiguous files, I simply moved the IpDrv.u file from 2Kgames\Gearbox Software\Borderlands\WillowGame\CookedPC to somewhere not inside the file path and the notification was gone.

Also, when I was looking through the files that had been added, the file ShippingPCWillowGame.exe under  2Kgames\Gearbox Software\Borderlands\Binaries is not needed, and I suggest users to not copy it.
If you do click it, it's basically the game starter which also checks if you have the CD for Borderlands in, it doesn't seem to send out any SOS messages, so it's mostly null, but it's a waste of 34MB.

I didn't download this patch until recently, since I was thinking perhaps they added the anti-modding things in it without telling us, however I was wrong, yet the changing of the port usage may have to do with it in the future, unsure, but still be careful if you spent time modding."
,reborn10,2010-02-16T09:52Z,is this the full borderlands game?
,reborn10,2010-02-16T10:24Z,This game does not work. It has the same problem as ArticOne's file. When i open Borderlands.exe it gives me a error message. Is there anyway i can fix this?
,behindthesights,2010-02-20T00:08Z,what do you mean move the file out of the filepath?  where can i safely put the files so i dont get that ambiguous message?
