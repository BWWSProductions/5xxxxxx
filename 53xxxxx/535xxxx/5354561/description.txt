The Borderlands 1.21 Patch files - Correctly placed and named

Razor 1.21 no-cd crack is included, just unrar and play :) Enjoy!



Please seed when you're done downloading, I rarely upload anything because my 

upload is only 90 kbps, but i felt this was needed. If it works - Share



If you encounter any problems: Try to use the official 1.21 patch released by 

gearbox first and then copy these files to the install dir afterwards. There might 

be some registry changes missing since these are just files. If any of the files 

are corrupt (due to torrent bad peer copies or whatever) and you get an error when

starting the game, extract the original file from Setup.cab (from gearbox original 

patch archive) and replace the bad file that was indicated by the error.



Please leave a comment when you've tested it, and how you got it to work 

(if it need to be combined with the original patch or not, for example)
