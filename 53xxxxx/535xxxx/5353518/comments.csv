v8/a10

Honestly though, I was a little disappointed with the movie itself. Agent Bloom's Southern accent is blatantly fake, the bad guys all have a combined IQ of 7 and something extremely weird has happened to Sean Patrick Flanery's face over the last 10 years.
The back story of Il Duce was interesting and as expected, Billy Connolly's performance was masterful (albeit far too short). 
The film definitely missed Willem Dafoe and tries to make up for it with cheesy lines from the 3 cops.

All in all, although I'm glad I finally got a chance to see it, I'm horrified that I can never unwatch it.
Serious word of advice: If you forget that it's supposed to be a sequel to the original, it's probably going to be a lot better."

V - OK, but keep in mind its a VHS screener.

A - Same as above.

M - Absolute nonsense. Unwatchable. Nothing like the first one.
