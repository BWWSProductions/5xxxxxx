Was wondering the same thing


My xbox got banned, I can still play this right? Can't wait for Resident Evil pack to come out"
,Torr3ntRid3r,2010-02-13T07:09Z,"A Jtag is necessary google for a tutorial as long as you didn't update to 2.0.8xxx dash.

1. Download a game and play with out a disc
2. run Linux/XP
3. Expand your hard drive to any size 2TB
4. Halo 3 modding, .map modding!
5. Testing modded files before actually burning a disc
6. Run any unsigned DLC/Full Demos etc
7. Play ANY emulator games, such as Super Nintendo,Sega
8. Load all games with out a disc
9. Play split-screen with buddies
10. Mod literally ANYTHING you want!"
,john5246,2010-02-14T06:36Z,"Hey I don't have it ""jtaged"" can I play this of a DVD or DL just like with demo's???

If so how do I structure the disc so it'll be able to read it? 

By the way I got banned from XBL during the last ""wave""!! What options do I have??"
,Torr3ntRid3r,2010-02-14T06:52Z,No you would need to buy another console which hasn't been updated! type jtag on ebay you can get one for a ÂŁ100.
