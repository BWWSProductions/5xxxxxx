an hour and a half to download 70% of the sample."
,disturbedguy92,2010-02-10T16:39Z,ay ray is this the same one you uploaded yesterday or a diff one cuz i got the other and like it and the only reason to download this one would be to up my quality so give me a heads up man

in my extremely humble opinion either this release or IMAGiNE release are about the same & probably the best out so far...but i could be wrong :)

,bychance,2010-02-15T05:34Z,"Thanks for your effort Ray. I'm sure you're doing your best with this one. A10, V7-8.
At least your sample showed us the problem area in the movie quality and you didn't
try to hide it.  "
