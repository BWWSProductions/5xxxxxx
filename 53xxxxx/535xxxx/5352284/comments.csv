,Vikingman1111,2011-12-18T18:46Z,"in the 1960s, Oscar Brand released  three albums called Bawdy Songs & Backroom Ballads. They consisted of really wonderful, raunchy songs that were common in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially among sailors. If you learn them, you will be the life of the party, for they are very funny, irreverent, and lusty. It's a breath of fresh air to hear clever adult songs as they were meant to be, especially among friends, a beer or whiskey, or whatever you smoke.

The rest are more standard folk songs widely sung in the same period. The lyrics of many of these are available on the web.

Note: Brand is in his 90s and has a radio show that has been going for 66 years in NYC. Visit his website at http://www.oscarbrand.com/discog.htm."
