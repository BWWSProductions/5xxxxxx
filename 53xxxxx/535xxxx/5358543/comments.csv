Seriously tho, as most wii torrents are "".rar"" files you will need a program like winRAR to ""unpack"" the files and create the "".iso"" file, so install winRAR and use it to unpack the torent files upon completion of your torrent download.
The "".iso"" file is a disc image file ready for you to burn to disc.
A common mistake is for people to try unpacking the "".iso"" file thinking it is also a compressed rar file, as sometimes "".iso"" files display with a compressed file icon.

Just use IMGburn or Nero to burn the "".iso"" file to DVD-R disc at a slow speed (2x/4x)

Your Wii will not play DVD-R discs without being modified with a ""drive chip"" or via a known ""soft-mod"" method.

If you have already successfully soft-modded your wii then you can scrap the whole disc-loading idea and save yourself a fortune on DVD-R discs and instead load from HDD.
This is fast becoming the most popular and proven method for loading games.

Buy a cheap USB caddy, pop a SATA HDD inside it, copy a USB loader to SD card, like uLoader for example, and use WBFS Manager 3.0 to transfer your downloaded wii games onto your USB HDD.
Connect the USB HDD to the Wii, run uLoader and pick your game from your collection. No discs needed!

On average a 250GB hardrive will hold approximately 100 wii games. 
A 500GB hardrive will hold approximately 200 wii games.
These figures are from past experience and obviously vary according to each games individual size once installed to "".wbfs"" regardless of whether they were originally a 4.7GB DVD-R size "".iso"" image file.

There are some great step-by-step guides out there to modding your wii.
Always have a good read online before you start modifying games consoles if you are NOT confident in such procedures.
An idiot can always find a way to brick their console, step-by-step guide or not!!!"
