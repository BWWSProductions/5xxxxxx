*There's more seeders than it shows on here. As i have given out the Magnet Link direct on xSellize, if that *should* impact on seeders shown, i'm not sure then. Cause as of now, 1:07AM GMT +12, it has 10 seeds.

This IS the 8 Feb 2010 one, i made this torrent due to it being EXTREMELY slow with the direct downloads supplied. I am aware there are newer DLCs, get them at xSellize or here: http://xsellize.com/showthread.php/83375-Tap-Tap-Revenge-3-1-xSellize-Edition

----------------------------------------
 Tap Tap Revenge 3.1 xSellize/Sinful Edition

    First came the original Wizard Edition, running on 3.0, by vikingwizardeyes. Next came my own Pirate Edition for 3.0.1. Later, there was the massive Tapster Edition for 3.1 compiled by aashrey99. And now is the xSellize Edition under 3.1, named in honor of all the users that have made this possible. The new xSellize Edition holds all the premium track packs to date, all cracked and tested. In addition, a recently made Sinful Edition was made, which holds all of the imports plus some of the themed songs no longer available for free download.

    Special thanks to hazelgu for providing the cracked TTR3.1 and everyone else who contributed towards the track packs.

    Tap Tap Revenge Sinful Edition (Extended Version)

    Originally, this was named the Sinful edition since I first uploaded it to Sinful-iPhone, all onjust to give those users a tough time downloading five colossal files on such a limiting website, since we don't like them that much >:) The Sinful edition has considerably more songs than the xSellize edition, but is also over 200 MB larger and some tracks unnecessary for some of you users.
    I also decided to share this with xSellize, first updating the errors of course, and upload as a single file tosincegave CRC errors to split archives.

    UPDATE 2/8/10
    Tracks with missing themes fixed. In addition Walk Away and Kiss With a Fist has been added, since they are also not available anymore.

    Includes:

        * All tracks listed in the xSellize Edition

        * Coldplay Revenge, Lady Gaga Revenge, NIN Revenge, Metallica Revenge and Tap Tap Dance imports.

        * Medicate - AFI

        * Belle of the Boulevard - Dashboard Confessional (3 Themes)

        * Walk Away - Five Finger Death Punch

        * Kiss With a Fist - Florence + the Machine

        * Hella Good - No Doubt (Custom Theme)

        * Bodies (Cahill Remix) - Robbie Williams
