,pycmuk2,2010-02-14T13:56Z,it s true )) all right
,c0wz,2010-02-15T21:38Z,yea you need to put more of a description in here
,Vandalay1,2010-02-25T05:30Z,"Torrent is good.

No description sucks. I recommend adding one or not uploading files as RARs so that users can tell what they are downloading."
,Fawkes_Lament,2010-02-28T18:44Z,"Yeah, as much as I want to get it because of how many there are, I don't want to look through all of them after I download, I want to see them before."
,pixlgeek,2010-03-01T05:32Z,"Here you go. Did a list on the directory and posted the contents to pastebin for those who don't want to download the whole RAR just to find that a file you were looking for isnt there.

Enjoy:

,khanasif,2010-03-17T01:55Z,"thanks for uploading friend! now ppl want u to install these applications in their smartphones too :P  or at least description for 1500+ applications :P

,ListenToMyMusic5,2010-03-29T01:08Z,"You cant add torrents with that many files on the piratebay, while uploading the torrent, the screen goes white and nothing else happens."
,Risket,2010-04-21T19:06Z,"It would probably be much better if you didn't put them all in a single RAR file. That way we could pick and choose which files we actually want. I found another torrent that had hundreds of apps and I really only wanted about 20. There were also quite a few that I already had newer versions of.

Just a suggestion."
,1Alino,2010-05-29T00:17Z,here is the list http://pastebin.com/6an8ie8Z
,oooaaarrr,2010-05-31T15:33Z,how do i install these. when i try to upload them to desire memory i get a parse file error

,anon_intel,2010-08-13T19:22Z,what OS version are these for? I'm running 1.6 and am unable to update. I need to know if these will work for me
,baaambey,2010-08-21T02:31Z,"anon_intel, it's not really possible to say whether all apps support the version of Android 1.6. You will most likely need to try them out yourself. To find out what this or that program does, you can go to cyrket.com or to http://www.freewarelovers.com/android and see their descriptions. The last site actually have the files too, which you can download to your phone over the air (use the QR code). Good luck! PS: Ppl, please SEED!!!"
,meetch,2010-11-01T02:16Z,Thanks mate. Appreciated.
,lulolulito,2011-02-01T20:47Z,"wow this is too much for me, i would rather just download the one app i need, check out http://www.iportable.net there you can find most os these"
,-mace-,2011-02-19T17:55Z,"Awsome thanks :D
