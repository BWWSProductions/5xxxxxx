,Jaffarin,2010-04-07T15:38Z,Thanks! This sounds interesting. I study religion so I'm happy to be able to see this. :) God bless!
,Jaffarin,2010-04-07T18:10Z,"I'm sorry to say this but the english subtitles are really quite hard to understand... They are not that correct english and it's a pity because I'm really interested in this film, but the message doesn't reach me because of the language barrier. Any possibilities to make better (english) subs?

With best regards,
Jaffarin"
