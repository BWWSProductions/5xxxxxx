,daddycat,2010-02-10T22:42Z,"Great torrent from SOSiSO

Unfortunately, the Level 1 Disc seems to have been omitted"
,ArmUser,2010-02-11T09:52Z,Is there any way of getting Level 1 please? CD 2 is actually level 2 and CD 3 is Level 3. Can't really use the product without Level 1. Thanks.
,xxx-yyy-zzz,2010-02-12T04:21Z,Level 1 Missing but still fantastic find
,genhummel,2010-02-12T08:06Z,"Im sorry for being new at this, but how exactly do you install this product. I have done other iso languages before but this isnt like that. Can anyone help and tell me how to load this? Thank you"
,genhummel,2010-02-12T17:57Z,"just to clarify i have PowerISO to mount the other languages to RS, is there a way to use that with this one?"
,123dutch,2010-02-12T21:48Z,use virtual clone drive... this worked for me (poweriso didn't work for me either)
,persnikitty,2010-02-12T21:54Z,"PowerISO works fine for the app_iso and level 2 and 3 iso files. Simply mount the language iso, then Add/Remove Language from within TRS.

The rest are audio cda formats for each unit and lesson, so use daemontools or another mounting program for those, then the ripping tool of your choice for audio extraction. For my needs, cdex works just fine.

Greek 1 is not included in this one, though that is not Vasia's fault. Greek 2 and 3 install just fine though."
,GSimop,2010-02-14T05:39Z,I just finished downloading this and I have no clue what to do. Can someone point me in the direction of a tutorial that could explain how to mount these files. Thanks in advance. 
,seoduder,2010-02-14T11:29Z,Awesome! Gracias VasiaZozulia!!! Sera posible poner Latin levels 1-3 here..? My hermanito is taking Latin in college right now and I really want to help him out.  Thanks bra!
,GSimop,2010-02-15T00:43Z,"i am a nub  to all this... Do I extract each file from each CD and if so what do i do with them. 

I downloaded Power ISO, Daemon tools lite, and CDex... I am soo lost. :("
,GSimop,2010-02-16T01:28Z,I got it to work but it asks me to activate the product. Should i update and then use a crack?
,genhummel,2010-02-16T04:48Z,which one did you use ?
,genhummel,2010-02-16T05:45Z,"and you have to dl the RS patch for v3 , it will get you around the register process"
,drapizan,2010-02-16T16:44Z,"OK!
First, thank you VasiaZozulia! I have downloaded from you many times. Time and time again, you deliver.

Here is my question.... I have this downloaded and as many others above, there are 15 folders (CD1-CD15) what program do I use to convert these into language disc's to load into RS and which ones are they? 
So which are the language disc's level 2 and 3 as others have stated there is no level 1 and which are the audio CD's
What program shall I use to convert these?
Im lost on this one and stumped.

Pls  help anyone with steps to what folder they used to what program.

Thanks TPB and Vasia for your responses to help me and others here."
,adrien69,2010-02-19T01:32Z,"Hello

Thanks Vasia... I was waiting to find this for so long... and yet another disappointment...

How is one supposed start learning Greek when CD1 is missing?!? CD3 or 4 I can understand but your torrent is useless for a beginner...

Adrien"
,JPN999,2010-02-19T11:50Z,Level 2 and 3 work fine but I don't see no audio files in the rest of the files... any help???
,genhummel,2010-02-19T21:43Z,"To anyone who downloads this: 

-If you would be able to help some of us out and tell us how you were able to get them to work and via what program that would be great

- Also, apparently there is no Level 1 only Level 2-3 on this "
,MoonDookie,2010-02-20T01:04Z,"Thank you for aLL YOUR GREAT WORK IN THE PAST!! THERE IS A SLIGHT PROBLME AS MENTIONED BY OTHERS...
 readme files shows 
CD 2 = Greek Level 1                                                    
CD 3 = Greek Level 2-3 
actual is :
CD 2 is language level 2
CD 3 is language Level 3
thx again"
,Ramsey924,2010-02-20T01:26Z,"First off i can tell you everything you need to know to get this thing installed as i'm sure you all will have problems as i did.

Second, Adrien i learned greek and am now fluent with ONLY greek levels two and three from version v3 so don't be a pessimist it can be done.

I downloaded this for a friend who has several languages and was at first surprised by the format. Folders two and three contain iso's for greek v3 levels 2 and 3. no level one guys. the way it is set up is in a split archive. so simply right click on the first file in Cd2 (or three for that matter) and then click extract here. It will then make iso's that we are use to appear in said folders. mount these suckers and you're good to go.

Another important detail, you will need RS version 3.2.11 or higher. V3.2.11 is a pain to install for most by itself, so google Rosetta Stone 3.4.5 torrents, It's even more updated and improved. Once you install this all iso's for RS v3 should install without a problem. No matter what language. 

As for the language files idk, haven't looked at em yet but i do believe someone else already provided some info on that."
,Ramsey924,2010-02-20T01:29Z,"btw, there is a version of a RS v3.4.5 with crack and all and it shows up in first page of google search when searching, i can't remember the URL but if i do i'll post it. Daemon tools lite mounted no problem."
,Ramsey924,2010-02-20T01:31Z,"lol btw one last time- THANKS A TON VASIAZOZULIA! if you can get level one on here too or respond with some feedback about getting it on here that would be awesome. my friend has been wanting this sucker for over a year and in college doesn't $600 to buy it so i'm sure he'll be ecstatic, thanks again!"
,adrien69,2010-02-20T20:15Z,"Hello?!? Knock Knock?!?
Vasia, a lot of us are waiting for the Level 1
Can you at least tell us if you have it or not?
Why is this Greek so difficult to find? I guess nobody is buying it or something haha

Anyway once again, without Level 1 it's just useless."
,Ramsey924,2010-02-20T21:07Z,its not useless adrien but i'll agree it is frustrating lol. It's great that vasia found this thing but it would also be fantastic if he checked out the comments on his uploads. He must have it otherwise he wouldn't have made the claim. Vasia if you are out there please do us a favor by posting greek v3 level 1. It's a real b**** to find online. i don't even think it exists i can't find another torrent for it anywhere.

,Ramsey924,2010-02-22T00:42Z,great advice the problem is those that download intended on getting what is advertised lol
,genhummel,2010-02-23T08:26Z,"stiiillllll not able to get the lang cd to be recognized , i did as you guys have instructed. I am currently using RS 3.4.5 and it works fine for other languages but this is still problems. First : 

-in CD2 i went to the first file ""sosrsap2.r00"" -extracted 
-made it into a iso file
- mounted it 

and the same message came up ""Unable to locate Language CD"" 

am I missing something here ? Why cant it recognize the mounted item. Please help."
,Ramsey924,2010-02-24T04:05Z,"when you extract the series of files it is already an iso. no need to make it one, just mount after extraction with daemon tools or another virtual drive"
,drapizan,2010-02-24T23:45Z,"Ramsey924 - Thanks for your instructions. It worked version 3.4.5.

Can you or anyone tell me which folders the audio companion are in? What is CD1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 and 15 now that we know CD2 and CD3 are levels 2 and 3?"
,drapizan,2010-02-24T23:52Z,CD3 is not Level 3. Which folder is it?
,Ramsey924,2010-02-25T04:18Z,cd3 is in cd level three if i remember correctly but its been a week since i installed it. The audio companion files are 4- wherever it ends from what i saw. I haven't looked at them yet or know 100% how to make use of them if anybody does post it. if not i'll hunt and see if i can find a way when i get time. it'd be awesome if we could get level one out. I have it but can't convert it into iso because its all .swa files and pictures it's not is .rsd like rosetta stone likes it. a more accurate description of my problem is on the forums take a look if you can figure it out i'll fix it so it can be uploaded and used
,drapizan,2010-02-25T18:20Z,"I confirm with Ramsey924 that levels 2 and 3 are in CD2 and CD3

I was also getting the ""Unable to locate Language CD"" on level 3, but restarted my computer and now it has loaded.

I would like level 1. Vasia?

Also would like to know where the audio companions are"
,drapizan,2010-02-27T17:48Z,any word on which folders contain the audio companion?

,anant_16,2010-03-02T01:50Z,"Hey Boys Yiasou
youd know what that means if youve used the software. Just wanna brush up on some greek.

A few questions: first of all does this download include the actual Rosetta Stone application or just the Greek level files. If not could someone provide a link. Thanks

Second of all could some one give me a full run through of how to get this software installed and runnnig. Do I have to burn an iso or is it an exe (etc).

I am also aware that it does not include lievel 1 but I have found the other torrent. 

Please some help
Thanks, Opa"
,FturDctor,2010-03-02T13:09Z,"How the hell do you open the .bin/.cdt/.cue files in Mac?  I tried using Toast Titanium/Popcorn to open these files in the Companion CDs, but ALL of them are errors.  The .cue works fine for the App CD (CD1), but not for CDs 4-15.  Why don't people who create these things do what EVERYONE else does...either make an ISO, or the individual mp3s themselves!!"
,FturDctor,2010-03-02T13:16Z,"Oh...btw anant_16...yes it includes the actual program itself (it is under CD1).

You will either need a virtual disk mounter program (which is included in Mac OS, another reason to switch from inferior Windows products, however the program included in this software is not the Mac software), or burn the ISO to a CD, and mount it normally.

Once mounted, then you can run the .exe.  Depending on the version, you may need to install a crack, which can be easily found on TPB.

Once you install RS, then you can add any language packs you want without having to activate the languages (if RS is cracked correctly).  But every time you open the program it will ask you to activate...just click activate later.

...Or if you prefer, just download a separate torrent for the program itself, which will usually include instructions."
,anant_16,2010-03-02T21:35Z,"Alright so what file do I mount on a disc?  Ive never don this before so when you say virtual disc mounter does that mean it mounts it to an .exe on your computer? Or an .iso? I ned like a step by step guide? 

Thanks in advance."
,FturDctor,2010-03-02T23:47Z,"Unrar CD1/sosrsap3.rar
This will create RS_App.iso, mount this file (or burn it to CD)
Run the install exe.
Done."
,anant_16,2010-03-03T04:18Z,Ok so if I unzipped the file in CD 1 then mount just that file to a virtual disk it gives me an .exe? Can I so this with Nero. Also the program will know where all the files are located withinthe folders or do I unzip these too. And you saId about the activation and a crack. WhAt are these where can I get them and is it just a keygen or keys. Also how do I add the languages. Do I need to mount the image. How do I download and add level 1 since it is missing so I'll get it from a different torrent.   
,anant_16,2010-03-04T04:17Z,Hey guys so after I extracted the rsapp file in cd1 do I do that for the language packs also and then virtual mount them. I need a step by step guide like that covers everything. It would be great if someone could help me out because I am a bit confused. 
,anant_16,2010-03-05T21:35Z,Ok so on each cd it appears there are like about 15 of the same file but I only extract and mount/burn the one iso? What is the difference? Also it seems that level one is on cd 2 and also Another cd is this correct. Csn you tell me which levels are on which CDs
,anant_16,2010-03-06T15:35Z,"Alright I see how it is. I got it to work though. So is the first file in the folder the only important one,can I delete all the other ones? Also when Im done installing language packs can I delete the fiolder. And how can I activat it is there a good crack or do you guys have keys.  And can you install the application to your actual computer without having to install it every time?"
,Kyle_Rector,2010-03-08T18:26Z,"I just found out that this originally was a posting by someone called SOS (SHARE OR BE SHARED) which accounts for the chaotic disc structure and missing disc1.

He (VasiaZozulia) didn't originate these files.  It was Plagiarized. 

He does the same thing that he accuses others of doing.  I recently saw it on a posting where someone had posted the complete package intact.  Also the companion files are formatted.  It appears that someone put some extra work into the posting.

When I see the pot calling the kettle black it has a tendency to grade on me a bit.

Otherwise, Thanks...

I saw your harassing comments on a proper posting and all as I see is you getting pissy because someone else got it right.  I too don't believe that you are the original poster of this Greek effort, yet claim to be.

If these are your original postings. why are there differences from posting to posting?
