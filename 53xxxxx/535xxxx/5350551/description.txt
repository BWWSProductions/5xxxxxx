Greek Learning Tips
Every word in Greek is marked with a stress. This indicates where the emphasis is placed when the word is pronounced. Words with only one syllable remain unstressed.
In Greek, every letter corresponds to one distinct sound. There are a few exceptions that Rosetta Stone will help you learn.
There are three genders, or categories, of Greek nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter.
Greek noun, adjective, and pronoun endings change depending on their position in the sentence, their gender, and whether they are singular or plural.
In Greek, the pronoun is usually dropped from sentences because its meaning is conveyed by the ending of the verbs. Pronouns are used mainly for emphasis.
To convey politeness, Greek speakers will use the plural form of a verb.
In written Greek, a question is followed by a â€˜;â€™ punctuation marker.
