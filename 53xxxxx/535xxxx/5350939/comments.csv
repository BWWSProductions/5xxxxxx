I don't usually comment but I just find stupidity to be hilarious. You think a black and white film made roughly 30 years after the first color film is the first color film - ""whoa"". Hilarious.

Don't waste your time watching a black and white movie which shits on any horror film of the last 10 years? Don't watch color remakes and don't watch the colorized version, not as gritty, not as scary.
""whoa"" - ha, still laughing at that."
