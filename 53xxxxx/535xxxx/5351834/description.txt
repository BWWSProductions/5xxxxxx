"Take an Easy Ride" is a British public information film with a heavy dose of sleaze and a bit of rape and sexual violence thrown in. The film features plenty of hippe girls in mini-skirts and some full-frontal nudity. A girl is picked up by a man and his wife,drugged and sexually assaulted by a couple of swingers. Two girls heading to a rock festival hitch a ride with a black gloved sexual pervert who drives them into the woods and then attacks and rapes them. This segment is perhaps the most unsettling. It's obviously influenced by infamous rape and revenge classic "Last House on the Left". - imdb
