=== The sound won't play/plays inproperly
=== Video is only black
=== WMP gives me an error

For all those problems @up - I recommend installing K-Lite Codec Pack (Full or bigger one) from it's official website:
>> http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm
It ALWAYS helps. If not, please redownload torrent.

== LiNUX (Ubuntu, Mandriva, etc.)

=== Problems with sound
=== Problems with video
=== Video player gives an errors playing this

I personally suggest you using MPlayer for watching videos (+ an GUI like KMPlayer or gMPlayer) with latest gstreamer (install plugins from an bad, ugly etc.!) + ffmpeg (on the internet you can find PERFECT guides how to compile it yourself with most plugins) + x264. All you can download from your distro's repos.

== OS X

Problems never found

= FAQ

== WHY DiDN'T YOU COMPRESS YOUR TORRENTS?

I compress it, but not everything. I didn't compress videos, music and/or images because I'm always optimizing it as much as I can without loss of quality. Compression gives an small loss of size for those.

== WHERE i CAN FiND MORE YOUR TORRETS?
 
http://thepiratebay.org/user/eXine/

== iS DOWNLOADING ANiME LEGAL?

If in your country this anime wasn't released on DVD/Blu-Ray/aired - YES!

== DO YOU TAKE RESPONSiBiLiTY OF iLLEGAL DOWNLOAD OF THiS ANiME?

No. But I can claim that any anime I'm uploading isn't released in my country. If it's released in your country - don't download it, go to shop and *BUY* it. Doing so you support Japanese culture, animation studios and author - and this is best way to say "thank you" for this anime!

== WHY DON'T YOU HAVE x ON THEPiRATEBAY?

The reasons are often:
- this anime is licensed in my coountry,
- this anime isn't good IMO,
- I found only LQ rips of this anime.
Remember that I won't upload too popular ones. If you have them DIY - I won't help you.


= N'JOY MY TORRENT!
