PlayStation-Ready Movie Trailers
February 11, 2010


This is a collection of movie trailers for next week premieres
and latest interesting trailers in 480p. Starting this week,
there will be two versions of this pack released: HD and 480p SD.
The latter can be identified by absence of 'HD' in the title.
And by smaller size, of course. So, there is also an 1080p
trailer pack, if you've got enough bandwidth and a decent TV - try
searching for 'HD Movie Trailers'. BTW, this week trailers kick ass.
