Here are all the most recent army lists and codecies for Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Fantasy Battles, as well as the rulebooks and expansions for each. It is current as of Febuary, 2010. None of these scans are new, but I thought it might be convenient for others to have them all in one place and clearly labeled. I was unable to find the new Beastmen codex for WFB, so I included the old one instead.
