,Dadutta,2010-02-10T23:47Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD
this BULLSHIT is RUSSIAN DUBBED"
,TRONIC777,2010-02-11T00:38Z,Guess it ainÂ´t bullshit if youÂ´re a Russian then ;-)
,jumpingphil,2010-02-11T02:28Z,"@ Dadutta, did you download it then?
Why would you do that if you can't speak Russian when it clearly says ""Spoken language(s): Russian""
Or can't you read at all?
PMSL.
I suspect there will be a few more along before long who also can't read.
LMFAO. "
,Mordanthanus,2010-02-11T16:01Z,"I agree it isn't bullshit if you are Russian...  I downloaded it without realizing it was dubbed too.  I don't know about everyone else, but I just look for the one with the most seeds and click the magnet link directly from the search list.  Didn't know it was Russian until I started watching it.  

All that aside, how can you understand 2-4 people talking all at once?  If they would mute the English speaking, or at least lower the volume it would make sense."
,Arghle,2010-02-12T22:25Z,"Russian spoken is one thing. There was a warning about that.

But its not episode 14."
,jumpingphil,2010-02-13T02:39Z,"It is episode 14 actually.
Well going by Fox's own numbering system.
It seems that everyone else is wrong but they won't change theirs.
What can you do?"
,paris75462,2010-02-14T20:12Z,Each episode is named.  Episode 14 is called ?5 to 9?.  Episode 13 is called ?Moving the Chains?.  Perhaps to avoid these pointless discussions regarding episode numbers we should just include the episode name to disambiguate. Then you can use any numbering system that you wish and no one can complain.  At least no one should. 
,baccioly,2010-02-15T04:57Z,"No one should indeed.
And... ""Spoken language: russian"" is clear enough for me not to choose to download."
,Vogla,2010-02-16T15:21Z,Is this 5 to 9 ?
,MoscowNick,2010-02-16T15:38Z,"Yes, this is 5 to 9 and dubbed over in Russian.

""? ???? ?? ??????"" means that in Russian.

Did House air in the States last night? How come there aren't any downloads out there???"
,1988gott,2010-02-17T12:10Z,Fox's own numbering system. Don't use it.
,Tommy_h,2010-02-18T00:28Z,"Hahaha Dadutta, stupid fuck. It even says Russian in the title for christ sake! MORON!"
,urmageren,2010-02-23T04:30Z,This is episode 13
,flegmatic,2010-03-02T02:22Z,"WARNING!!!!!

It is episode S06E13 named Caddy...

It is russian dubbed which should be pretty clear right from the description RUS ONLY...

But it is still the same 13th episode.

I would like you all to pay attention to this ULer. It is 13th episode!!!

@Jumpingphil go shoot yourself in a head, asshole for your false advertisement...

Still the same episode 13 all about Caddy."
,flegmatic,2010-03-02T02:28Z,"And by the way...

Moving Chains according to eztv is S06E12. I might be getting the name of this episode about Caddy wrong but it is still 13th episode, assholes!"
,jumpingphil,2010-03-02T02:39Z,"@ Flegmatic.
What a pillock you are.
Have a look at this site http://www.fox.com/house/index.htm# 
You will see that FOX label this episode as 14.
I can't help it if everyone else is wrong.
So, anyway, please tell me, do you understand Russian?
What's that? No I hear you say.
Then why the Hell did you download it anyway?

Once again, this is episode 14. It is called 5 to 9. As stated on the FOX/HOUSE website.

Appology accepted dick head."
,flegmatic,2010-03-02T16:54Z,Horosh vipendrivatsa i chitaj shto ja napisal! ;/
,bzzzzzo,2010-03-03T22:44Z,Is episode 14 out at all (english)?
,aaaltonen,2010-03-05T00:53Z,"Episode 14 has released February 8th. Next release is Ep 15 and its release day is March 8. Here is ""official"" episode list, that how to list episodes http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_House_episodes#Season_6:_2009.E2.80.932010"
,aaaltonen,2010-03-05T00:55Z,"but because here 1.st and 2.nd part was one and same episode, number list is allways one behind to official list"
,ennyn,2010-03-08T10:00Z,"?? this is a promo episode from The Simpsons , wtf ?
