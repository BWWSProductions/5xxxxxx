But in any event, show must go on.

My sincere condolences to you on the loss of your father - may he R.I.P.

Thanks for this upload and for so many other b4.

You're definately one of my favs - if not *the* fav - UL'er on TPB, and just seeing your name on the torrents is (to me) so often a guarantee of not only superb quality in A/V but also on the content.

Thanks again for your very much appreciated sharing-effords, yours ""the show-must-go-on"" attitude and for you to even consider to share with us the private reason for your short absence... 

Best regards,

Loke"
[V],Ekolb,2010-02-13T00:41Z,"Thank you so much everyone for your kind words.  It really means a lot to me knowing we aren't just invisible icons or avatars but Living And Breathing humans who care for each other in their time of need.

Sincerely
Ekolb."
,Praetor_,2010-02-13T01:49Z,"Sorry for your loss Ekolb.

It is also nice to see someone as yourself care enough to let us 'fans' know what happened and give us a chance to acknowledge your time and effort.  
The show can go on whenever you are ready.
Cheers to you, your family and especially your dad, he obviously raised a fine individual."
,tofusoldier,2010-04-10T04:53Z,"Sorry for your loss, Ekolb.
I think we often forget that there are people behind the content here on tpb.  This thread is so beautiful, I've never seen anything quite like it.
Cheers, guys, you're awesome.

Regarding this documentary, Google's ""Don't be evil"" policy seems to have failed with their assistance in the great firewall of China.  Seems so strange to have such a positive documentary in light of all that."
,Visame,2010-09-21T09:51Z,"I am sorry for your loss!
What a hard time it must have been.
I wish I could remove your pain and I wish you strength.
My prayers are with you.
Best regards,
Visame"
