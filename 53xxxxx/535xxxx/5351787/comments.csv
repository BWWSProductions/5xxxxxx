,The Hawk,2010-03-06T17:03Z,"He is right.  It's fake!  The keygen does nothing.  It also installs spyware.  Look in c:\Program Files\Common Files.  You will see the spyware program called ""Protexis""!"
,ademirado,2010-03-11T15:32Z,"frathail you are funny idiot !!!, The Hawk if you don't know how to use it don't talk shit!!!

OMG what a morons !!!"
,jeff696969,2010-03-24T23:50Z,"Protexis is the stupid license server that Corel uses. It is a pain in the ass, but it's not a virus. There are some hoops you can jump through to disable it."
,Club17,2010-04-04T10:08Z,"But if you disable it, you can't run PSP. You can change to ""manual"" vĂ­a services.msc, PSP will call when need it."
,ceilfisk,2010-04-26T11:34Z,"Thanks ademirado, this works perfectly, will seed this for as long as i can.

If you don't know how to use the keygen, then don't complain when it doesn't work."
,The Hawk,2010-06-07T00:31Z,"Insult me all you wish.  The keygen still installs the Protexis virus.

Enjoy your new virus!!"
,Normsky,2010-06-09T11:00Z,Perfect.  Ignore The Hawk fool.
,ZexHUN,2010-06-10T10:51Z,"Hawk you are an idiot.
1. Keygens do not install programs.
2. Protexis is not a virus but a licensing service program ----> http://www.bitpipe.com/detail/PROD/1112950967_947.html for some info...."
,ichigo325,2010-07-04T12:54Z,"@The Hawk
HAHAHAHAHA.. People like that also exist?!
Noob~"
,kiuas1984,2010-12-12T12:58Z,thank you. Works perfectly!
,justsayit,2010-12-19T17:34Z,"Norton says that the keygen a trojan is, be careful :)"
,raptozilla,2010-12-24T04:47Z,"This is great; works perfectly, ademirado. It's far and away better than Photoshop. Thanks for the upload."
,raptozilla,2010-12-26T06:24Z,"Based on my experience installing this program, I rewrote the installation instructions so they will be more accurate than those supplied with the download.

1. DISCONNECT FROM THE INTERNET!!

2. Run the keygen and leave it running.

3. Unpack & install Corel PaintShop Pro X3 v13.

4. After PSP X3 finishes installing, start Corel Paint Shop Pro X3 from the desktop icon or start menu. 

5. Click ""Continue"" at the free trial screen.

6. Choose ""Register Later"" and click on ""Continue."" The program will start.

7. Close the program. 

8. When the program closes, you will get a screen that tells you how many days of the trial version are left. On the bottom left corner of this screen, click on the ""Already Purchased"" button.

9. The next screen will ask you to enter a serial number. Click on the ""Key Code"" button on the keygen, copy the code generated by the keygen, and paste it into the ""Serial Number"" text field of the trial screen. (DON'T GENERATE A NEW KEY).  

10. Click on ""Phone Corel"", while leaving the keygen still running! 

11. From the next screen, TYPE BY HAND the Installation Code given to you in the 5 or 6 text boxes on that screen into the ""Installation Code"" field of the keygen without any dashes or spaces.

12. Finally, click ""Generate"" on the keygen and then copy the ""Activation Code"" from the bottom text box of the keygen and paste it into the ""Activation Code"" text box on the popup.

13. Click on ""Continue.""

Done!

Important notes:
**************** 

* Block the program from accessing internet with your firewall if it asks for permission to do so, or block the program through Program Control feature of your firewall.

* Disable the option ""Check for Update Automatically"" if possible. (I could find no way to do this in the X3 program preferences).

* Do NOT update the program and do NOT check for program updates!"
,Super_kiwi,2011-02-20T11:02Z,"The KeyGen works fine.
just disconnect from the internet and
activate it
(might want to use a new key as a previous one used on internet didnt seem to work even after disconnecting)"
,Jessi_Minaj,2011-04-16T22:51Z,"I followed the directions exactly, but the install keeps failing.  On to the next one..."
,rahul_c,2011-04-29T09:00Z,"It works just dont disable ProtexLicensing service as mentioned in read me, it makes software disabled(shows illegal copy popup). Install when offline and when completed block corel using firewall.
Thanks ademirado!"
,rahul_c,2011-04-29T09:01Z,follows ^^ @raptozilla instructions.
,DammShame,2011-07-06T00:44Z,"New to this  - but where is the keygen located?

Thanks "
,keithroden,2011-07-13T04:24Z,Do not trust this download. My McAfee Virus protection just isolated and removed a TROJAN that was embedded in this torrent. Anyone that says otherwise is a fool.
,dhanyetta,2011-07-31T13:15Z,"Just to put minds at ease I googled Protexis and all it showed up was stuff about license and coral paint shop no place did it say virus, it it was one it would had listed links about virus information so hawk do your homework.

Second anytime I have ever used a keygen my anti virus has detected it as a threat. However I downloaded this and had no issues with it at all. Thank you so much for sharing. "
,najasimms,2011-08-01T03:01Z,"If i learned correctly the reason virus blockers find a virus in this is cause its the crack that changes the program, which is what trogans and viruses do, they take programs and manipulate them the crack manipulates paint shop to allow you to use it, i think i am right in how i view it. when its all said and done, the program works despite the virus warnings"
,X-Bit,2011-08-09T18:08Z,"Programm and Keygen works... BUT:
- Disable AV scanner
- do NOT follow the Eliminating the ""ProtexisLicensing service (PSPP_X2).txt"" advice!
- Block internet access definetly for the app. through firewall

It works and there is no virus! Thanks to ademirado!
"
,elderwand,2011-09-09T04:46Z,Thank You Uploader No Spyware No virus just a great program Thank so very Much!
,Club17,2011-10-03T07:54Z,"Lol, finally The Hawk have reason: keygen have 'Generic.dx!tbv' trojan. Reported by McAffee."
,aguila9,2011-10-20T22:30Z,"""Hawk"" and ""club17"" are a couple of idiots. You guy should get together and shoot yourselves.  Let rid this world of stupid  people."
,ladyleah1984,2011-10-31T17:06Z,Thank you! It works.
,mpsuav,2012-02-02T23:56Z,"Very good, only some brushes not working i'll try to search for hem here!!"
,marknjess,2012-05-22T05:53Z,"Thankyou for the program, as to the virus complainers, if the program concerns you, why not go to Corel and purchase a legit copy for yourself and stop whinging"
