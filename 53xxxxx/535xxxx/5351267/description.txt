"Microbody was founded 2002 by singer Peter H as a harder electronic complement to his other project Deogloria. Two releases were made with quite primitive recording equipment, Fear of energy and No disco shit! In late 2003 Peter got in contact with another musician, Andreas F, who made music under the name of Schism Trace. They started talking about maybe doing something together. After trying to write some tracks together, Andreas became a full-time member of Microbody. Their first release together was Eternal sleepwalk society, wich consisted of partly re-recordings of Peter's early work and partly of new material. 
Not long after, the work began on the next release. Now the band began do develop their sound for real. Influences came from various directions such as punk and synthpop, but still they had their roots firmly planted in the 80's EBM-scene with bands such as Borghesia, Ã ;GRUMH and such. They even included a cover of 80's teen star Tiffany's old hit I think we're alone now. For those who don't know about her, check their friends list. Their fourth and latest effort saw the light of day in august 2005 and was named Decay." (c) Official Microbody MySpace
