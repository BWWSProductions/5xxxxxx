,blind202,2010-02-15T04:36Z,"Sry, seems that pixelation disappeared after a restart... nVidia cards/drivers sure produce the weirdest of anomalies... no audio over HDMI, 256-colour HDMI output, black screens of death, multidisplay anomalies, and now this..."
,s20dan,2010-03-12T16:49Z,"Blind if you have no audio over HDMI, be sure that you have connected you Graphics card to your soundcard with the supplied small wire.

 Personally I dont know why you would choose to use HDMI, its the same as DVI, and most displays have a DVI slot.

 Ive been using Nvidia for a few years now, and providing you are careful about which drivers to download, there should not be a problem."
