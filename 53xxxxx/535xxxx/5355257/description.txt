+-RELEASE.iNFORMATION

The game is a combination of a tactical game and a sports game The
basics are extremely simple: two teams, one ball. The team that
carries the ball into the opponent's end zone scores a touchdown,
the team with the most touchdowns at the end of the game is the
winner. However, it's how you decide to do this that makes things
interesting, the ends justify the means! It's not just the players
you have at your disposal either. You can bribe the referee's to
look the other way as you cripple or trample annoying opponents and
hire illegal wizards to give you a hand directly from the crowd...
Blood Bowl severely tests the finest tacticians' strategies There
are many races to accommodate every player's profile and even more
strategies for experimenting. Winning a game requires a strong
game-sense and a lot of self-control. For the player's enjoyment,
omnipresent humor and the use of spells, weapons, and other
non-regulatory means place Blood Bowl outside of the classic sport
simulation genre.
