Schisms in Christianity - The East-West Schism, The Great Western Schism:


The East-West schism started in the 11th century and deepened in the following years, and finally resulted in the division of medieval Christianity into Eastern (Greek) and Western (Latin) branches, which later became known as the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church, respectively.

The Great Schism of Western Christianity or Papal Schism was a split within the Roman Catholic Church in which two men simultaneously claimed to be the true pope. The conflicts quickly escalated from a church problem to a diplomatic crisis that divided Europe. Secular leaders had to choose which claimant they would recognize. The split lasted about 40 years from 1378 to 1417.
