,Bakerman2807,2010-02-14T02:03Z,"Too big a file to grab at once, and without a preview.
Someone please split it into smaller chunks."
,yuna2,2010-03-06T17:20Z,"All of these books are in page-by-page JPEG format. Unfortunately, most of them have had the matrices deleted from the picture (!?) so they're unplayable.

Playable characters:
Alleyne, Annelotte, Dizzy, Erina, Luna Luna, Majikina Mina, Menace, Mirim, Shigi, Tanyan/Seinyan, Yuit/Vante.

Unplayable characters (artwork only):
Airi, Aldora, Alice, Cattleya, Claudette, Ink, Irma, Iroha, Risty, Mai Shiranui, Melona, Merfa, Nikusu, Nowa, Reina, Reina 3-D, Stella, Tomoe, Ymir.

You can get Japanese translations pretty easy on the Web as standard downloads. There really isn't that much text to translate as long as you already know the rules.

So, guess this comes down to being worth a download if you're missing some of its playable characters or you just want some hentai."
