Dostoevsky's parable for the chaos amongst contemporary (1870s)
movements pressing for reform of Russia's imperial/autocratatic
system, played out by a disparate bunch of regional radicals and
a driven manipulative leader seeking to unite them behind him via
a brutal killing.

It all ends in tears. Just like it did in real life.
