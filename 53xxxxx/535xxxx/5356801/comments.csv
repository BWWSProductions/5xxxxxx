,MrAssistance,2011-11-28T12:49Z,"Ken Follet is a wonderful writer. I've read both The Pillars of the Earth and World without End, and they are staggering. I have begun reading one of his newer books; Fall of Giants. It is good, but nothing can compare with the Kingsbridge series :)

Thank you AZ for uploading. Good man"
