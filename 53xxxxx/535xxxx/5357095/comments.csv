,Lithocardia,2010-03-05T12:41Z,"Hey TOED, so you came back? Hope whatever was up had a happy ending. Heard it was family related, illness? Rly rly hope that turned out well.

Been trying to find out for over a year. Is there ever going to be a workaround or a way I can play BDTS with your direct play version of ME1? I've got ME2, don't know if it's US or INT version, down here in downunder. Also wishing to know if my savegame will import OK btw different versions if I do have diff versions. Gawd dying to play BDTS!

Never knew you were Subzero. LOL at you as Subzero laying into the losers who insult TOED uploads. Anyone who can't work out how to use ur directplay versions has to be pretty stupid."
,Lithocardia,2010-03-05T12:46Z,"Oops how embarrassing. So this wasn't a TOED or Subzero upload. I had done a search of Subzero (browse by). Don't know how it landed on this just bc it's in the title.

If anyone knows how to grab his attention or can answer my question, I'd be very appreciative. :-)
