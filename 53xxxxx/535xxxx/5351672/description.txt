Description

A giant cyclone has sucked up thousands of fish from the oceans! Itâ€™s an ecological disaster! Tanks of water are immediately assembled throughout the world, so that all the fish can be returned to the oceans. As the sea creatures start falling back to Earth, someone must make sure they land safely and quickly since they cannot survive for long out of water!

Your goal in Downstream Panic! is very simple: safely lead as many fish as possible to the sea. Use various unique tools to control the flow of water and the environment to rescue the fish swimming in it!
