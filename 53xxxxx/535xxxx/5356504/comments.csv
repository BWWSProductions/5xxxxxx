And it comes up with ""Sorry, the link you are using is no longer active"".

Waste of bandwidth"

This is just publicity. You'll have to ""unlock"" it by filling an ad.

Don't waste your time."
,ttlens,2010-10-26T06:57Z,"As 1950sigma and Eter_Pt wrote, you have to ""unlock"" this file by filling in an ad.

That isn't all though... If you open the file with a hex editor and have a look at it, over 99% of the file is filled with zero values. In other words, even if you fill out the form (DON'T!) you still get absolutely nothing -- there is no data there.

Just for laughs I compressed the install file with 7zip, the 67MB original file compressed to 14KB.  Yes, KB, not MB. 

TL/DR: Total waste of time, should be removed."
,ttlens,2010-10-26T07:07Z,"Forgot to add... The web page you get sent to is PHP page that redirects you to the site where the form is. The redirect is on this domain:

baictron.com

Not going to repost the whois info, but it's not cloaked if anyone cares to look.

So...anyone have a spare botnet looking for a target?"
