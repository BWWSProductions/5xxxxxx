Storyline: 
Two crew members are stranded on a spacecraft and quickly - and horrifically - realize they are not alone.
Two astronauts awaken in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. It's pitch black,
they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship. They can't
remember anything: Who are they? What is their mission? With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him via
radio transmitter, Cpl. Bower ventures deep into the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality.
Slowly the spacecraft's shocking, deadly secrets are revealed...and the astronauts find their own survival
is more important than they could ever have imagined.
