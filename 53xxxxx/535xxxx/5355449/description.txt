Comic book series published by Marvel based on the 90's cartoon about the surreal, parodic adventures of an anthropomorphic wallaby named Rocko, and his life in the city of O-Town. 

The comics contain stories not seen in the television show. In addition, the comic book series omits some television show characters and places, while some original places and characters appear in the comics. John "Lewie" Lewandowski wrote all of the stories except for one; Joey Cavalieri wrote "Beaten by a Club," the second story of Issue #4.
