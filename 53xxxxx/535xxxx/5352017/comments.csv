[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-02-10T16:28Z,Thanks! I just watched the sample and it looks good! Quality is good for a VHS-SCREENER! At least that is what I would say it is due to the resolution (Width : 480 pixels   Height : 352 pixels)! I will post a few snapshots after I finish downloading. Definitely worth the download!
[V],.BONE.,2010-02-10T16:32Z,american dvd release date is 9th of march so there will be a dvdrip or bdrip anytime soon so take it or leave it :)
