,omegaphi,2010-02-17T15:01Z,"Holy not much for detail with this torrent eh? 

1: Is it region free? Or what is the region code?

2: Does it work or is it bogus? ABGX anyone?"

if the game is wave 4 abgx wont recognize it, search the web for ""xbox 360 wave patch""(preferably wave4 to wave3)... abgx also has its own way to patch games to wave3, just search goggle"
,stunna119,2010-04-22T19:51Z,tested and works great... had to use ppfomatic to convert file to wave 3
