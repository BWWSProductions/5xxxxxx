 Description
Fading Shadows sees the player faced with the challenge of saving Erwyn, whose death, according to the millennia-old prophecy, will allow evil master Gardal to breach the gates of the Castle of Heaven, the supreme fortress built to protect the world from the forces of darkness. Erywn's soul has been enclosed in a protective orb by his clairvoyant sister, Aira, and the orb must now be returned to the dungeon where Erwyn is captive, using a magical beam of light. The player must control the beam of light and exploit the state-changing abilities of the orb to fulfil the challenges of the 40 single player levels or 10 multiplayer levels.
