A short animated brilliant film. Nominated for Oscars 20101. 

It's beautifully animated.

2. There's extraordinary cleverness in each frameâ€”you just can't expect to take it all in with one viewing.

3. By the end, you are not bothered by the fun fast food logos or references to AOL or Microsoft. You're frightened by the logos you could identify without ever having given the company any thought in your day to day life. You're frightened by the familiarity of all the strangeness. (At least, I was.)

By French design collective H5, Logorama is worth taking the 15 minutes or so running time out of your lunchbreak (there is some potentially NSFW language)
