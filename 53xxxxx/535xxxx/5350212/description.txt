Well i found this really interesting ebooks about photography, i hope they will be helpful and useful to others like they were for me, mostly based on digital photography where you can learn starting from Digital art for dummies to how does digital photography works to a book with some really great expert techniques. There is also one book about creating sophisticated images and understanding the elements of photography the last one which i putted as a bonus is Nature Photography.
Enjoy!!
