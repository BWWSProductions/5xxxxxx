,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-03-02T18:07Z,"uploaded this in a few hours yesterday, just posting to say it works perfectly.

to make an offline account, wait till you load up the game, you will see a Windows Live drop down menu thingy... just search through that(i had to press the back arrow once or twice i think) till you see a link to make a Local Profile. that is the Offline Account you have to make in order to save the game.

graphics in this game are 10/10, really amazing, looks fun too although i only played it for about an hour or less last night after installing. great upload jonpat.

cheers."

I had the same problem, but it went away after trying once, i downloaded what you said and when i start the game, the razor1911 logo pops up and the 8-bit music plays but nothing else happens after. HELP?"
