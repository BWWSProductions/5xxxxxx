YNSA is based on somatotopy â€“ the correspondence of parts of the body to specific areas of the cerebral cortex. The experienced YSNA therapist can feel for small changes in the muscle and subcutaneous tissue of the scalp that correlate with the patientâ€™s symptoms or disease. By palpating certain regions of the neck and abdominal area, the practitioner can further identify the areas of the scalp to be treated.   â€¨â€¨The somatotopes were discovered by the Japanese physician Dr. Yamamoto in the 1970s and have been the subject of a growing body of research since then. YNSA is especially effective for the treatment of acute and chronic pain and neurological disorders (for example in neurorehabilitation). The method is rapidly gaining international acceptance. This is thanks to its therapeutic effectiveness, which has gained it many enthusiastic adherents among doctors and patients alike, and the tireless dedication of Toshikatsu Yamamoto, the 75-year-old Japanese physician and founder of the method. Dr. Yamamoto gives classes in Europe annually with the Acupuncture Research Group (ARG).
