,7valleys,2010-02-13T14:48Z,Is this the CBC coverage????
[T],stupidul,2010-02-13T16:46Z,"Awesome ceremony.
Unfortunately NBC did not broadcast the original OBS (Olympic Broadcast Services) transmission, which most of the European networks relayed; they appear to be using their own cameras and positions, so this version misses some of the charm.
But it still is something that should not be missed :)"
