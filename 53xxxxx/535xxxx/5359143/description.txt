This is a collection of my favorite Blues back tracks 
that I have collected over the years.  The naming and tagging
of the files is my own for personal use when our band jams 
out or practices.  But I can tell you about the code as such that
we have used.  The key is always either in '  ' like 'C' or just C.
Anything in parentheses means something to us, but you may find useful.
(H&G) = Harmonica & Guitar
(Gui) = For Lead Guitar
(H) = Harmonica

I have another collection I am organizing and will upload that in a 
few weeks.



The following link is to some other good jam stuff.  It isn't spam or 
advertising.  Just some good links.  I signed up for Griffs site, and have 
never had to pay a dime for anything from him.  He sends some jam tracks and 
jam track videos in my Email.  But I am going to buy his course for advanced 
Blues Guitar soon.  It will pay you to check him out.  He is great at what he 
does

out to a small gig.  I had nothing else to post as a pic.) ;)
