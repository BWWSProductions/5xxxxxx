,T.T.C,2010-05-11T06:08Z,"DUDES~! I got it to work!

Follow these steps:

1: DO NOT USE NoLimits, IT DOES NOT WORK!!!
2: Install PGP.
3: Disconnect internet.
4: Enter registration info (It is the quintan corder thing, but DO NOT PUT A SPACE BETWEEN ""quintancorder""!!!)
5: After finished, exit PGP.
6. Open PGP, then after it boots, connect internet.
7. Go to regedit.exe, and search for PGP_DATA.
8. Change the date key (should be like this: 05/10/10) last two digits to 99.
9. Have FUN!!!

This works, I've been playing for two hours now!!! I'll post this on the other torrents too!!!"
,gprien,2010-06-16T18:24Z,"Thanks for this,If you DL trial version from their website (win 7 compatible) use this serial and the method posted by T.T.C. It works marvellously.
Happy hunting

,oriam12,2010-06-17T20:50Z,How the hell do i input the info given in the text doc.?i don't know where to go to put in the keys!
,oriam12,2010-06-23T21:29Z,i inputed the info and it was fine.......then it said the 15 mins. are up >:(
,Notanumbnut,2010-08-30T15:26Z,"Dl'ed the trial from the website and used T.T.C's method and it worked. This Profiler from the torrent wouldn't work for me. The trial is the full client, you only need to activate to make it permanently functional past the trial period. 
NB: A wireless controller will not work even if you are using the chrage cable, it will ONLY work via a wired controller OR a wireless gaming receiver!!
Thanks uploader and thanks to all you nice chaps, keep up the good work."
,sc00bdizzle,2010-11-15T02:31Z,My problem is this. I cant tell if it works because I cant find where to put the registration info. Theres no option within the program to register it.
,sc00bdizzle,2010-11-15T02:36Z,Nevermind it definitely works. Thanks uploader.
,andiste81,2010-12-11T11:37Z,cheers dirtydog9  for ya codes n that..iv had this trial version but ma 30 days ran out grrr but now its crackin...works fully n for thoses that cany figure it out....u shouldnt be alound to mess around with torrents n stuff like this....u got a whole world of information at ya fingertips called google...use it wisely
,steelbunny,2010-12-12T03:56Z,"same here, u guys must be smoking. I don't see where help & support  and about Pinnacle at all. May be new trial version from Pinnacle force you to buy & activate online. No such manual entering registration data any more."
,marcus1989uk,2010-12-21T00:52Z,nice and fast!! thanks! 
,Pillow69,2011-01-25T06:58Z,"the torrent doesnt really work anymore but the crack works fine. do what T.T.C does and download the 30 day free trial, then use the crack"
,biglowdn,2011-01-26T22:50Z,"im stuck on on step #7 i cant find PGP_DATA, i went to run regedit.exe onlything that pops up is pinnacle and i cant change the date there please help, and thanx for all the great info!"
,wilkshyre,2011-03-17T18:18Z,"Been fighting this pinnacle profiler for a couple weeks now and honestly there are two ways you can do this if you want to use a controller for free.

1. DO NOT enter in the quintan corder info, it DOES NOT work, pinnacle must have patched the game specifically for this user bc although it will appear that it worked, in actuality it doesn't, and after 30 days it will stop working, plus it will get lodged in your registry and you will have to do a deep scrub of it searching out every entry of Pinnacle, KalinkoSoft, and Power Up Gaming. Although this only took me 20 or so minutes to complete it is still a pain in the ass.

So if you want to use pinnacle DL the trial from their site and use it normally, when your thirty days is almost up use REGEDIT and search PGP_DATA, when it comes up select the first run entry and set it to a day or two before the actual date, i.e. if it is March 20th, set the first run to March 19, and so on. DO NOT CHANGE THE YEAR.

This will trick pinnacle into thinking there are X amount of days left on your trial. You will have to do this each time you want to use it and it is kinda a pain in the ass also, but it works and it is free.

Your other options are A. Buy it B. DL XPadder, it is free, not as intiuitive, but works just as well. It is kind of a bitch to set up but once i got it working everything was smooth as could be.

Not a spammer or some dickless lizard working for XPadder, just a fellow traveller who has grown sick of trying to make fucking pinnacle work.

Cheers All."
,NeoTwilight,2011-03-30T10:36Z,"Wouldn't happen to mind writing up the sections in the registry needed to remove to get rid of the ""quintan flag?"" Tried myself, but seems I missed something in there. "
,Lil-Te,2011-06-09T06:52Z,"What If You Already Tried A 30 Day- free-Trial Of Pinnacle Game Profiler??...........Could You Download Another 30 Day Free-Trial??????

            ""CONFUSED"""
,shahzebamin,2011-07-20T22:16Z,"@ T.T.C Alright, but where the fuck do I put the unlock key and registration information?"
,Trevayne,2011-08-19T12:06Z,@Lil-Te you are the most retarded user ever
,zebedy212,2011-09-28T13:07Z,"got it to work, for anyone that cant find where to input the password etc. right click the taskbar icon and click the 'About' word near the botton of the list. Password wallah!!! 

will test for a month and see if it's still running then post on here"
,feytus,2011-09-29T16:13Z,"Just installed it, and got a message it was incompatible with Windows 7."
