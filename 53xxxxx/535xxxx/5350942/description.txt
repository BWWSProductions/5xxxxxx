         In the remote wastes of Siberia buried under snow are         
         the remains of one of the greatest catastrophes that the      
         Earth has endured. 250 million years ago, huge volumes of     
         lava spewed out onto the surface--so much that it would       
         have buried the whole of Texas under one mile of lava. At     
         first the temperature dipped but then the greenhouse gases    
         that escaped from the depressurized lava caused a massive     
         global warming. It wreaked havoc and 95% of the species on    
         Earth became extinct. Yet life hung on and in time this       
         disaster paved the way for the next great phase of life       
          on earth--the age of the dinosaurs.
