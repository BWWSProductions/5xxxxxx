,Strikefear13,2010-02-15T18:46Z,"Holy shit.  I could SWEAR that people downloading this meant the exact polar opposite.  I figured they would download it out of disgust and burn it to a cd and use it as a frisbee.  Jesus christ, you've enlightened me, sir."
,Smokeypaulie,2010-02-16T03:39Z,"since when was this show crap? It's fuckin hilarious, thanks eztv for bringing it to the masses."
,whraglyn,2010-06-28T12:06Z,"@strikefear(onlyinwimps)13,

I happen to heartily agree with oxide17, and find his phrasing in complete accord with my own.

Why not face off in person with this 6'4"", 250lb, no fat, 52 yr old angry white male, and tell me how silly oxide17 AND I are for simply and nicely stating our enthusiasm for the show, and for the ULer's fine work?

No?
Too much the online-only type of loudmouth bullygirl, are you?
...Thought so.

Moral Of This Lesson:
If you cannot say something nice, shut your stupid dicksucking piehole, pissant fuckoff pussybully.

Hey eztv, do you really want shiteating bullies such as 'strikefear13', (what a 13 yr old sort of pussywimp handle, lol!), spouting such nasty jism in the faces of your loyal fan base?

AND, please keep up your great work, eztv!
Thx much for this, and for all of your fine ULs!
Cheers, All!

ps- i really really really really hope to meet 'strikefear13', (Oooooh! SCARY! LOL!), in a dark alley some moonless night; i say 'moonless' only so i wont have to see his piss-in-his-pants stains as i school him in how to be more polite when expressing his opinions here..."
