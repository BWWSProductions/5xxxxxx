Still waiting? Anyway, of course it's clean."

,Crim2k8,2010-03-03T20:48Z,"@musti1982dedeler:

You must be some kind of fucking moron.

You see that green skull and crossbones beside RobbingHood's name?  That means he's a TPB V.I.P.

To question a V.I.P. is to question TPB itself, and gives you zero respect.

Idiot.

No, it's full of viruses.  Have a good time installing your O/S.

Oh, and just by reading this message, your face will self-destruct.  

If you're so fucking worried about whether an upload is clean, BUY A RETAIL COPY and quit insulting peoples' intelligence with a lack of your own."
,onestoptakeaway,2010-03-12T20:06Z,"Hi, I couldn't get the crack to work and I am getting the error msg ""Can't load file, make sure it's not in use"". Keeps asking for a serial."
,onestoptakeaway,2010-03-15T01:06Z,It took me many attempts before I managed to get the crack to work. What I did was change the name to EMBRACE during installation and run crack as administrator. Hope that helps.
,Malakka,2010-03-17T16:24Z,"Dear Sir, RobbingHood. 
This was one of the best programs I ever used when it came to convert (in this case ""Generation Kill's"" seven avi-files to MPEG) to another format. 
I've been very ""upset"" (read: pissed off) that I could not look at avi-files on my DVD-player. So after ?ages? of watching avi-movies on the computer screen, a new world has opened to me. 
It took 15 minutes to make a one MPEG file of two 700 MB avi-files. These two files ended up at ~ 3.9 GB. 
The quality was excellent (thanks to the up-loader ?ohgoodtimes? that made a great job). 
The installation of this program went very well. No problems at all. 

I dearly recommend this program!

Thanks a lot!"
,23photo,2010-04-04T20:34Z,"installed easily and worked fine....

make sure you run the patch as administrator or it will not work."
[V],Anacondaz,2010-05-25T05:54Z,thanks for the nice upload mate
,Flopis,2010-07-03T19:50Z,"Win 7 64: Recomendation. 
Install as per instructions, all as administrator. Patch and generate... Keygen might tell you there is no file to write to :(.
Restart and generate again. It should work!
Thanks Robbinghood!"
,sadl0nelyd0g,2010-07-06T05:13Z,excellent torrent. run the application and key gen as admin for win7. it works. legit. fast. nuff said
,mishal153,2010-07-13T09:03Z,"Installed fine for me, NO virus or anything reported by symantec. thanks. njoy."
,hwasser,2010-08-27T10:19Z,"Terrible software. Cant covert any AVI file. Comes a message ""Cannot open the video part of file"" when trying to add any AVI file, lol, uninstalled it and tested a free convert software, which works better than this piece of shit software."
,waif68,2010-10-12T21:40Z,Installed a couple different versions of this and none converts to MP4. Everything else works great.
,MalayZN,2010-10-20T14:10Z,"I'm still getting the activation screen after following all the steps what am i doing wrong?

Install app  open once then close activation window.
open keygen as admin and patch/generate then open app still has activation
also i do run setup as admin and use only one user in setup."
,snochicka,2010-11-11T08:48Z,"I'm still getting the activation screen too.  Everything went all right, installation, patch.  Then when I go to start the program, the serial is different from the one in the readme.  I cut and paste in the default one, but I get an error.  Any ideas?  Thanks!"
,floorman1,2011-01-06T04:49Z,"been using tmpgenc for yrs.It is still the best software to convert movies.
Thanx"
,iridis_alpha,2011-01-14T12:40Z,"THIS HAS GOT MALWARE, MALWAREBYTES ANTI-MALWARE PICKED IT UP WHERE OTHER SHITTER AV PROGRAMS FAIL ..AVOID THIS LIKE A 2 DOLLAR WHORE ... ROBBINGHOOD, SORT YOUR MALWARE DETECTION SHIT OUT YOU CUNT"
,phasar,2011-02-07T15:04Z,"iridis_alpha did you actually READ the posting, and the readme, or are you just a twit???

First: ""IMPORTANT NOTES- AV Scan results of TMPG.XP.4.7.4.299_Keygen:
*************************************************************

1- Norton Internet Security: Clean. 
2- avast! Pro Antivirus: Clean.
3- Kaspersky Antivirus: Clean.
4- Avira AntiVir Premium: TMPG.XP.4.7.4.299_Keygen contains a recognition 
   pattern of the (harmful) BDS/Agent.FPT back-door program


The  av scan result of Avira is a false positive due to some used binaries 
and cryptors. (Or maybe the keygen is also added to Avira's virus database.)
So just stay cool or don't use this!!!


Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!""

Second: while the majority of us here are adults, there are always some children here. So, watch your mouth... If you want to talk like that I suggest you do it by PM"
,linkjones,2011-03-28T11:19Z,"Hi,

Some of you having a problem with Step 2 after the first time you launch the program be sure to just Exit the window.  Look in the directory ---> C:\Documents and Settings\Admin or Their Name\Application Data  make sure there is a folder in the ""Application Data"" directory labeled ""Pegasys Inc"" and a folder labeled ""TMPGEnc4XP"" in the  ""Pegasys Inc"" folder.  

If these are not in the locations I listed then create them, label them as listed and put them in the locations listed. If you did it right the path to the folder you need will look like this ---> C:\Documents and Settings\Admin or Their Name\Application Data\Pegasys Inc\TMPGEnc4XP. 

I have encountered the same problem as you the Patch is looking for the folder ""TMPGEnc4XP"" to create a license. If that was your problem hope that this works for you. BTW I have XP I am not sure this will help for any other OS.

As far as Virus Detection phasar is right.  I've had Micro Trend list a Patch or Keygen as a Threat that needs to be fixed because of what it is for.  They're offering a ""Virus Scan"" not a ""Morality Scan"" which is most likely done for financial gain on their part.

Cheers,
LinkJones"
