3. Common useful details:

I searched NX9005 drivers two days from Internet and there was no easy way to
update/repair NX9005's drivers for ex. LiteXP (Light XP for low memory PCs). So that's why I released NX9005 drivers separately and also whole HP driver pack.

Hopefully this driver pack will help someone.

You must own an HP Computer to use this CD correctly!
May work on newer Compaq branded Computers.
