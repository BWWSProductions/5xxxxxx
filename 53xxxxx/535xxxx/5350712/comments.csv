,McGudge,2010-02-12T11:59Z,"Hey Bricktop

Great rip as always.

I know the PS3 Team members try to avoid doubling up material so is there any chance you could try and persuade Grizz419 from Demonoid over to the bay? I've noticed he has got some real good stuff on the go (not quite as good as yours ofcourse)

I can't get an invite for Demonoid and always miss there registration openings.

Thanks"
,McGudge,2010-02-12T13:50Z,"Alternatively you could spare me an invite to demonoid?

Pretty Please"
[T],bricktophd,2010-02-12T15:41Z,demonoid isnt giving invites out since the site went back up sorry. i will see if grizz would upload here as well.

,bWgHD1,2010-02-12T15:42Z,"ah, maybe not then,posted my reply same time as the great bricktop.

,Rodrigho,2010-02-14T18:55Z,"Hi

Fist of all, i've got very clear the sayin ""beggars cant be choosers"" however, i'd like to report this error.

This movie sadly wont play on my system. All the rest ps3 team releases worked perfectly, sometimes hard to tell the diff as compared to the real BD.

The reason seems to be the encoding options, as i have carefully checked and spotted diferences.

The following, don't appear within working movies:
psy=1 / 
fast_pskip=1 / 
sliced_threads=0 / 
constrained_intra=0 / 
wpredp=2 / 
rc_lookahead=40 / 
mbtree=1 / 

On the other hand, this one DOES appear, but it's not present on this release's options
pb_ratio=1.30 /

Im not an enconder, and dont have ANY idea of the meaning of all this, only thing i know is, they used to work perfect and im worried for newer movies not to work, so, please, is there any chance to go back to the old options?

I'd really be grateful if my words were heard

Cheers! "
,bWgHD1,2010-02-28T14:54Z,@McGudge - do u still need an invite??
,McGudge,2010-03-03T12:45Z,"no bWgHD1, I got one from 7egend on hexagon.

cheers mate"
,rbrdky2,2010-03-09T08:17Z,"McGudge, any chance I could get an invite? I've been looking to go private and I seed min 2X on everything."
,McGudge,2010-03-09T17:19Z,"rbrdky2

I dont have any demonoid invites, but i could send you a hexagon invite and if your lucky you might find someone with demonoid invites over at hexagon.

whats your email and ill send ye the link?"
,ChargingKaboom1,2010-06-30T01:03Z,alright so i downloaded this (and seeding it right now :) ) and i tried playing it on my VLC Media Player like it says it can be played in. when i do that it instantly freezes and plays the video like every 10 seconds but its all gray smudges.... so i downloaded BS Player like the guy above and it works better and plays the video but freezes every 5 seconds and the audio lags behind about 2 seconds. can somebodeh halp meh please?
