,rubygrape,2010-02-13T05:15Z,"Kickass!  You really are the man, goose!"
,kevink51,2010-02-13T05:26Z,Thanks Goose!  U don't know how much we panicked when we thought R&F were gone.   We appreciate your work and please don't let those haters get to you.   We'll take care of them for ya!!!

[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-13T14:36Z,"Nope. No intro. It goes from ""The Ron and Fez Show starts....... right now"" to Ron talking. "

,nicdip,2010-02-14T17:55Z,"Goose! Still #1
Thank you for rising above the bullshit. Now lets focus on how to filter live reads : D"
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-14T20:31Z,"Ha! - re live reads yea I'm not too keen on the flow of the R&F show. My bad if there happens to be one left in here and there. Even still, if they're doing them during the show chopping them out might not sound right, especially if they reference them at all. "
,ghoull,2010-02-15T02:26Z,Possible to get Special Delivery with Sam and Dave ? thanks budday
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-15T17:04Z,"Get SD @ SpecialDeliveryFans.com. I haven't done the weekend content in awhile and don't really have any plans to atm. Part of the issue is not having much of a schedule (I know it's gotten a little better) or knowing what is ""new"" or a replay. Not to mention the best shows are long-gone, Virus weekend programming was gutted by the Sirius asshats. Sorry folks, it is what it is - I can't be everything to everyone. "
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-16T00:45Z,"Heads up people 02-15 O&A and R&F were ""best ofs"". As typical for O&A, for some goddamn reason they like to start the Best of (worst of) apparently 10 minutes early and I have no proper intro. I heard R&F was just a replay of Fridays show. What I'm gonna do is try to grab the 8pm O&A replay to get the intro. Then I will upload the O&A show and check out what I have for R&F. If R&F is just Fridays show I won't bother with it - if not I'll up it. Don't expect anything until probably 8:30 / 9pm est tonight."
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-16T02:10Z,"02-15 R&F was a ""Best of"" but the whole channel was (still was during the replay) off by 15 minutes so I don't have the beginning. I will see if I can find it somewhere tonight but I wouldn't wait up for it. I'll update when I have news......."
,TedSheckler,2010-02-16T03:20Z,thank you
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-16T03:35Z,"Complete R&F 02-15 Best of up asap, maybe 15....."
,fag69,2010-02-16T20:12Z,"If you would rather me not post a link on your page, please let me know MG.
