     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      As one of the brightest objects in the night sky, Mars is
      currently at its closest proximity to Earth for the next four
      years. Nasa investigator Steve Squyres, the chief operator of
      Martian rover Spirit, discusses the agonising decision to
      abandon the device after a series of unsuccessful attempts to
      rescue it from a sand dune which ensnared it in May 2009
