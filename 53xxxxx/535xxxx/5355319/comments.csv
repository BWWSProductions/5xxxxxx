,peterpansen23,2010-07-05T16:17Z,dharquen you have shown your noobishness. let me give you the math> the file is 1280x696 right? now guess what... 1280/16*9 is 720... who would have guessed... this video is exactly 720p if you watch it on a 16to9 screen... you should really learn about cinematic apect ratio 1.85to1 (or 1280to696 rings a bell?)before you post the next time
