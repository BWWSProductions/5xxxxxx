,steve30x,2010-02-10T20:27Z,Whats the difference from this and the Razor crack? The original crack works 100% for me.
[V],Mbb15,2010-02-10T20:39Z,"For me to...

you can see the reason here

Note:

Razor released this game without a launcher initially, and then released a
launcher which was hacked together using an old version of the Securom
launcher and the icon for Bioshock 2. Their launcher is from another game.
Besides potentially causing trouble, it is also not very retail of them.

Proof:

 Version number of RZR Bioshock2Launcher.exe : 0.1.0.0

Version number of our Bioshock2Launcher.exe : 0.1.0.8

Additionally we cracked the launcher for both SP and MP, because they are not identical launchers."

,D0gmeat,2010-02-10T21:44Z,"Usual scene rules and politics. IMO, if the RZR rls worked for you, go with it. :)"
,joshuag942,2010-02-11T03:30Z,"could i use this crack, if i installed the rzr version??"
,Nureddin,2010-02-11T05:49Z,"I can play, but without serial is not possible to save games.. is this correct?.. do i need something else?"
,cat_fish_1,2010-02-11T10:02Z,one big thing that Razor doesnt do is SLI support and that you always get in Reloaded.
,OmniCoRp,2010-02-11T23:21Z,"well it works... thank u... i always use RELOADED if possible ;)

but why is there a MP crack, when it's not possible to play MP??

or is it?"
,vampirelu,2010-02-12T00:38Z,"Kaspersky 2010 reports virus Type_Win32 in Bioshock.exe.Maybe it's a false positive but i won't risk it.

2/12/2010 01:24:09 AM	Detected: Type_Win32	µTorrent		E:\NET\Downloads\BioShock.2.PROPER.CRACK.ONLY-RELOADED\MP\Builds\Binaries\Bioshock2Launcher.exe		

 I thought i let you know.	"
,brunohll,2010-02-12T01:00Z,"Works like a charm. Thanks. No virus alerts with AVG9 though. Tried the Razor crack and that didn't work for me. This one does.

i.e. @joshuag942: Yes, this will work with a Razor install"
,joshuag942,2010-02-12T01:01Z,wow ur stupid. thats obviously not a virus. thats the crack. shut up and get off the internet little kid
,saturnine4,2010-02-12T22:58Z,"okay non of these fucking cracks work. i got the TPTB version(because the razor 1911 version would install) and none of these cracks work, including this one. all of them say securom not launching."
,davitodude,2010-02-13T02:56Z,"I play online so today I was forced to update to continue with my online profile. When I accepted the update and it was applied I began getting no disc errors. I checked out my files and apparently the update writes over the razor crack. That's when I came here to look for another crack and found reloadeds. 

This crack works with both the razor download and the online update. Just update the game as you normally would (if you play online). The game will automatically start up and you'll get a wrong disc error. Now look for the reloaded crack and copy/paste the single player (sp) launcher and the multi-player (mp) launcher to their proper binaries folder. 

After that the game should start up fine and you will still be able to play online."
,Deathstryker,2010-02-13T16:42Z,"Protip:

This works with the patched version as well. Since the launcher was unchanged all you need to do is copy the Bioshock2Launcher.exe file and Bioshock2Launchero.exe file over. Both of these files must be present for it to work since the cracked launcher works over top of the original launcher."
,mikljonsmoking,2010-02-16T09:04Z,"i appear to have the same problem as 
Tornadobullet 
.
the game is working but when i try to log into windows live account it asks for a ""serial key"" ???
what can i do?
i just want to save it and see if the games acctually worth buying or not."
,Disconnected_sheep,2010-02-18T06:48Z,"why does it ask a serial key in single player too !?!?
and how do i go around it ?"
,CrownMeKing,2010-02-19T07:20Z,"I'm in the same boat as you guys.
I installed it fine, then it asks you to create a Windows Live account.
After you put in your info, it asks for a CD Key. WTF!!"
,micnor14,2010-02-20T01:49Z,"Guys; while in game: go to create a Live account, but instead of agreeing to the Rights and Terms of Use, read on and you'll see a link to ""create offline profile"". This is how it should be done for most (not-un-pirated) Games for Windows Live. "
,kubler-ross,2010-02-23T22:50Z,Micnor14 is right! Try it it WILL work!
,Billo007666,2010-02-27T21:58Z,"@Dreissen. 'Buy the game' Simple. Alternatively if you can get your hands on (almost) any GFWL key (from a friend, other legit gfwl game etc) then that will work with this and infact (almost) all GFWL games. I use the word 'almost',  as Dirt2 uses a new version of keys where a key can only be used on that game only."
,PCgamerDude,2010-03-18T20:29Z,"I have a problem, when I try and launch the Multiplayer .exe (either from the game menu or the game dir), nothing happens. I dont get an error, but nothing opens up or launches??"
,WTFGD,2010-03-30T16:14Z,"How I got a key:
- Download GWFT (crap_but needed)
- Then get Ms Tinker and it comes with a key, use that for Bioshock 2, worked for me!

If not buy a cheap online game for GWFL (GTA IV £8)"
,davitodude,2010-04-01T00:17Z,"@ Tornadobullet

Sorry, I haven't checked here for a while. To answer your question you do need a key. The cool thing is you can use keys up to 5 times and except for a few games for windows live games they all work on every game. I'm not positive what I am about to say is true, but I have heard if you uninstall the game before you reach the 5 limit use, it can be used virtually unlimited. "
,edumazieri,2010-05-03T01:57Z,"ok, really, wtf. it seems like  im the only one who has this but crack isnt working. i mostly know how to do things, got like 200 games here... but i open it with launcher and it does nothing. with launcherx it asks for cdkey and with bioshok2.exe it says i need to use launcher. am i missing something? its almost as if i didnt even copy the crack over lol"
,edumazieri,2010-05-03T01:58Z,ok with a lil more info: under windows 7 x64 installed it at d:\games\bioshock 2\   replaced the two folders with the ones in crack. tried this one and tried the one that came with the PROPER RELOADED FULL GAME. installed and all correctly. and not working ;\
,edumazieri,2010-05-03T02:00Z,"ok nvm, my bioshjock fdolder got 500mb. just the vids and the exes. ¬¬¬¬¬ wth happened at install ? lol"
,rlseyman,2010-05-15T09:15Z,For Those who cannot figure how to save the game or make a account without a key.... just go to creat a account and in the part where you have to agree you read it scroll down and click Creat offline account BAM now you can save and play offline and no Problem its a fun game If you want to play online or so buy the game and respect the company's who made it. so they can keep making more Awsome games =D
,TheShadows798,2010-07-13T19:29Z,@ rlseymanrnrni did what u said but i still cant save the game... any help?
,TheShadows798,2010-07-13T19:36Z,@rlseymanrnrnnvm...got it...thnx a ton for ur help
