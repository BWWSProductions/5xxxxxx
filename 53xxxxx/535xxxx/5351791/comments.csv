,FotherMucker,2010-05-05T22:46Z,"Avira Antivir (free) tells me the patch.exe is infected with ""TR/Agent.233472.B' [trojan]"" but I'm pretty sure it's a false alert. Avira just doesn't like pirated software ^_^

Either way, it's handy to have this 1.5 version available, even if it is the free version so thanks uploader."
