I know everything abou my russian father ?? trace Links

,harigata,2010-02-26T02:22Z,"First, thanks a ton to the crackers-uploaders who made it possible for me to pirate this game.

Second - was it too fucking hard to say, in the instruction, #5 - ""Play the game"" exactly which fucking file I need to run? would have saved me 20 minutes of befuddlement.

Just fucking add in the fucking readme file:

5. Run [InstallationDir]\SP\Builds\Binaries\Bioshock2Launcher.exe
Fucking thank you!
