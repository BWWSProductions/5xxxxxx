Release Notes
Orjan Nilsen: "For me, trance is one of the biggest parts of my life
It's there for all occasions. If I'm feeling down, if I want to party, if
there's some memories I want to revive. It just brings me to life

Orjan Nilsen spent the last couple of months collecting the right tunes
for the ninth Volume of the successful Trance World series. Not only to
bring you a balanced 2 Disk mix that represents his diverse sound, but
mostly to bring you the true trance spirit. Throughout the past 3 years
and divided over 8 Volumes, Signum, M.I.K.E., Robert Nickson, John
O'Callaghan, Sean Tyas, Agnelli & Nelson and Tatana have brought you
their trance fix, sharing their vision of what trance should sound like

On Trance World Volume 9, it's Norwegian producer Orjan Nilsen that
shares his vision. Known for his broad taste in trance music, ranging
from his proggy trance hit 'La Guitarra' to the dark and techy 'Moving
Mojave', makes it no surprise that Trance World 9 is more diverse than
ever before

Orjan: "After pressing play you can expect loads of different things
First of all, I think you can expect a compilation that suits different
purposes. When you're driving, when you're partying or just want to blast
your new speakers and seriously mess up the relationship with the
neighbors. I think I managed to capture my sound quite well, blending the
styles I like into one compilation. The first cd will be a bit more
chilled, building everything up and setting the mood with some funk,
before the second takes over and just makes you want to get to a club

Trance World Volume 9 features a special selection of tracks by Way Out
West, Arnej, W&W, Roger Shah and many more in a tight mix, which doesn't
only take you past the latest trance and progressive hits, but also sends
you on an unforgettable trip down the wonderful sound of today's trance
music
