This is an additional torrent to my Dave Matthews Band Complete Studio Discography I got out there (which, indeed, is a complete -studio- discography). If anybody feels like being nitpicky about them being referred to as "The Dave Matthews Band" on the "Remember Two Things" record, I've simply chosen to ignore the "The" when tagging the files for personal convenience. For the other torrent, check out this URL: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5147999

I hope you enjoy this torrent. FLAC is the way to go. Bad sound kills good music! ;]
