After a few minutes, MS office '07 will be in the start menu and ready to use.  SEED THIS. I'll be seeding for a while just to keep this one going. Worked on WINDOWS 7 32-bit."

,katiana32,2011-10-06T12:47Z,Awesome download. Be patient if u overclick it will screw it up and you will have to redo it. It really looks like it isn't doing anything. This totally saved my a$$ I had to do a full drive wipe and needed to replace all programs. My version wouldnt let me reinstall....TY

,ajsobol,2012-05-17T10:27Z,"Works perfectly for Windows 7 Ultimate.
Was a bit unsure about running an exe file but it's totally safe.
Installation starts about 30s after clicking, so be patient!
Great job, thanks a lot!"
