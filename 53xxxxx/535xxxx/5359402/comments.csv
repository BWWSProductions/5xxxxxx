Also, you missed Jaek in the line-up."

I feel incredibly guilty for torrenting this, but I plan to run out and buy it at my local target asap. This guys most certainly do work very hard."

,EnkiTheCreator,2011-01-12T00:09Z,"Great album! 

Don't feel bad for pirating their album. Bands, especially in this genre, make almost no money on record sales. These days it's all about merch and shows. Show your support by tracking their tours, going to their shows, and sporting their gear!
