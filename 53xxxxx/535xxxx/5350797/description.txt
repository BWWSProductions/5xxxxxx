Swamijir SmritiSanchayan

Swami Nirlepananda, the author of this book, was a monk of the Ramakrishna order being a disciple of Swami Shivananda. He spent years of his life in research on Swami Vivekananda.

The English biography of Swamiji (and surely â€˜The Complete Works of Swami Vivekanandaâ€™) is the best source for knowing Swamiji and his teachings. Beyond that there lie the reminiscences of people who saw him. Swami Nirlepananda met as many such people as he could. He tells that who ever, a sanyasi, a brahmachari or even a common man or a housewife, from each and every nooks and corners of the society, came in touch of Swami Vivekananda has attained some invincible impression of this great monk.

Swami Nirlepananda collected all such recollections what ever available and published those in the â€˜Udbadhanâ€™ magazine more than 50 years back and later in the â€˜Sudarshanâ€™ magazine (that too more than at least 30 years back). Later all those reminiscences were published as a book named â€˜Swamijir SmritiSanchayanâ€™. Sadly enough this book is out of print since long (may be because of some memories of people that contradicts those published by Ramakrishna Mission at the present days, [these are at page no. 25, 38, 60 and etc.], but these were first published in â€˜Udbadhanâ€™ magazine of Ramakrishna Mission itself!).

I personally believe that this book is a must to read one for each and every Swami Vivekananda-lovers and for those who want to know the Swamiji from different perspectives of life. As these reminiscences vary across a wide sections of people they amply present different types of views of people who saw Swamiji depending on their personal experiences, capabilities and view points.
