BBC Horizon 2010 To Infinity and Beyond HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

To Infinity and Beyond.
Series exploring topical scientific issues. By our third year, most of us will have learned to count. Once we know how, it seems as if there would be nothing to stop us counting forever. But, while infinity might seem like an perfectly innocent idea, keep counting and you enter a paradoxical world where nothing is as it seems. Older than time, bigger than the universe and stranger than fiction. This is the story of infinity.
