A documentary about the undeniable common ground between two of the holiest religions of the world, Christianity and Islam, and the differences that were made by the ignorance of mankind. It highlights the essence of One God, and One True Message that was delivered by Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. All of whom were His prophets. A must watch for any genuine truthseeker who seeks absolute truth regarding the divine. Thanks go to Noreaga and his team for this marvelous series.
