IMAGiNE NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

Right  heres 1 of 4 releases....all of them New moon, ninja assassin, boondock saints 2 and old dogs are all PPV rips from motels ( in our opinion) We're pretty sure they're ppv rips as the same titles are listed on some motel sites that have their ppv listings and also from time to time you see the "LI" or "LU" in the bottom right hand corner.

Anyway got to give SN and Mr H a big shout for letting us use their source files......All of the releases needed major tweaking as the colouring, contrast, ar etc....we're fooked :(

Now we have done the best we could with what we had and fixed pretty much everything that needed it......

The best was boondock saints.....looked alot better than the other 3 but even that needed alot of work :lol:

Anyway no doubt the r5's or retail rips are only round the corner for some of these if not all so grab if you can't wait.
