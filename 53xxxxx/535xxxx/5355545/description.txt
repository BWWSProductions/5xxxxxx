East of the Sun, West of the Moon is the fourth album, released 
in 1990 by Norwegian band a-ha.

It was seen by many as a departure from their old radio friendly 
sound to a darker, moodier tone, and is named after a Norwegian 
fairy tale. The album sold over 3 million copies worldwide.

This album marks something of a transition for A-Ha, moving away 
from the 80's synthesized sound into something more moody. 
But don't be scared, it will grow on you! 

Crying in the rain A great cover of a great song - it was the first 
single, which is an indication that the album doesn't really have any 
songs that are viable instant hits.

East of the sun is a departure from the last album, with the pop 
sounds almost entirely replaced by soft rock with a 60's/70's feel.

Rolling Thunder I think A-ha recorded this and someone must have said 
"That sounds a bit like Crying in the rain" Which gave them the idea 
to cover said song. It's even got the same thunder/rain samples on it!
It's a very good song though and a rolling rock ballad.
Seemingly non-stop July A slow acoustic ballad to end the album gently. 

In a sense A-ha don't seem to be being themselves, so it can take a 
bit of getting used to, if all you have heard is what has come before.
