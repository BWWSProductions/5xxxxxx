The eighth season C.S.I The Vegas is certainly special because it is the season when William Petersen leaves the serie who plays Grissom, while new signings arrive. One of those new signings is Jessica Lucas, the new coroner's department, and new cameos such as Brendan Wayne. Ty Murray and even the direction of William Friedkin, who won an Oscar. To this must be added a hectic start to the season, where Grissom will have to save Sarah from the murserous grip of miniatures, in the first chapter of the series.
