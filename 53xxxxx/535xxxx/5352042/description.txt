Description

The scales of judgment day are teetering. The evil deity Hellgaia has escaped from his tomb and threatens to destroy Neverlandâ€™s existence. The shrine guardian summons the Dominators, those who wield the power of the spectral cards â€“ to help. Eleven are sent, but only one has the strength to prevail - Galahad.

Armed with the power to summon allied warriors and creatures, cast powerful spells, and build resourceful bases with his Spectral Cards, guide Galahad on his quest to stop Hellgaia and save the world. The other dominators await, each with their own card-wielding ways. Think you have what it takes to be a true card master? Join the battle and find out.
