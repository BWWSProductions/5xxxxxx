,daba_1,2010-02-10T15:52Z,"East Coast based blues band fronted by singer/harmonica man Ray Norcia and featuring guitar work over the years by Ronnie Earl (Roomful of Blues, Ronnie Earl & the Broadcasters) and Kid Bangham (The Fabulous Thunderbirds). Blues sensation Monster Mike Welch added his name to the list in 2003 with the release of The Bluetones fifth studio album. Aside from his stellar harp work, Norcia is an excellent singer, and at his best, brings a touch of country and jazz to the blues. Hands Across the Table was released in 2005 on Severn Records. 
A surprisingly tasteful and solidly swinging album, Sugar Ray is a powerhouse vocalist and a more-than-respectable harp player. There are some good songs, too, especially the slow blues ""I'm Tortured."""
