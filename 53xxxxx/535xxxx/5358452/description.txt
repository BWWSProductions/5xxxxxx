 Ricky (Ashley Walters), just out of a young offenders' institute and heading
 home to Hackney, is determined to go straight. Instead, he heads into trouble
 when he becomes involved in a street clash and sides with his best friend 
 Wisdom against a local gang member. The trouble escalates into a series of 
 incidents that threaten to spiral out of control. Ricky's 12-year-old brother
 Curtis, adores Ricky but seems smart enough to know he doesn't want to follow
 his example. However, despite the warnings from his mother, Ricky's bad boy 
 appeal might prove to be too attractive for Curtis to resist.
