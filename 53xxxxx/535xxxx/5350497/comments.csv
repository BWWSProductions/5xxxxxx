,gfred,2010-02-10T04:32Z,"Really! Thanks for the spoiler! And seriously, thanks to the uploader - I didn't have access to a TV tonight and I can't wait to watch this."
,sanafa,2010-02-10T04:33Z,"F1ngers has been writting that same comment even before this episode aired, so don't worry, it's not true."
,leopaul,2010-02-10T04:37Z,"Not that I've seen the episode, but Ben will die."
,F1ngers,2010-02-10T04:41Z,Oh man! Sorry about the spoiler! I thought it was for the poster only!
,cafinatednarcotic,2010-02-10T04:57Z,"even if Ben died ... fans of the show know that death is relative.  Saed died, remember?  And actually, Ben DID die, if you remember.  So go su-k a c0ck fingers.  gay pr0n is 3 doors over on the left."
,dongiovanni77,2010-02-10T04:59Z,when did ben die before? i only recall locke & said dying.
,teikyo30,2010-02-10T05:19Z,"What kind of moron posts a spoiler like that? Fingers says he thought it was for the poster only? Really? If you're that clueless, you need to stay off TPB because you're obviously too dumb to be using it. Seriously. You are a complete moron. This is probably the same moron who was revealing spoilers when Prison Break ended. "
,superhackmaster,2010-02-10T05:49Z,"hey teikyo30, calm down. he's just fucking with you. Ben doesn't die, Sawyer does (big surprise, you don't see it coming). Great episode and well worth watching"

,Geemonster,2010-02-10T11:14Z,"Can't the mods remove that twatist comment from f1ngers.
 what a total arsehole."
,Geemonster,2010-02-10T11:15Z,"superhackmaster you're a twat also,just shut the fuck up with the spoilers.
  Someone should disconnect your internet for that you no good cunt."
,darkstud,2010-02-10T17:52Z,So Ben doesn't die in this episode because he doesn't even appear in it. Actually it is Kate who dies; she takes the samurai sword from the Japanese guy (btw his name is Dogen) and commits suicide. Then they revive her in the swimming pool :)
