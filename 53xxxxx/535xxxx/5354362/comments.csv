[V],RiddlerA,2010-02-17T03:02Z,"@ txbushbacker 

I know the subs are out of sync, if you are using GOM Player you can manually sync them ... that's what i do

Otherwise if u want to remove them just delete the sub file(file with extension srt)"

TIP: Why leave an srt outside the MKV anyway? Takes only 30 sec. to ad an srt with mkvmerge GUI... Thanks again for sharing RiddlerA."
