    In the last of this four-part series, historian Dan        
    Snow explores the ups and downs of a climactic century    
    in naval and British history.                            
                                                              
    Rapacious and ruthless, the 19th-century Navy used         
    'gunboat diplomacy' to push British interests further     
    afield than ever before. It was control of the sea       
    rather than her land empire that was the key to           
    Britain's growing wealth.                                  
                                                              
    Technological advances saw Britain and France engage in  
    an arms race over battleships. While Britain's navy       
    appeared to be winning, the meritocracy fostered in        
    Nelson's time was slowly being eroded by an entrenched    
    hierarchy which smothered any spark of initiative among  
    its sailors.                                              
                                                               
    When Germany emerged as a new threat, modernising         
    admiral Jackie Fisher was called to reform the Navy.     
    Fisher believed in peace through deterrence and had       
    plans for a huge new battleship - the Dreadnought.         
                                                              
    When war finally came, the British and German fleets     
    clashed off Jutland in 1916. But the outcome was not      
    the knock-out blow the British public wanted. Britain      
    emerged from World War I victorious but broke, and no     
    longer able to maintain by far the world's largest       
    fleet. In time, other nations eclipsed her. It was the    
    end of centuries of naval supremacy.
