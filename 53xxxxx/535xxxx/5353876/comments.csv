The others, please someone else up them, and tag them ""film noir"". Thank you!"
[T],frankie-boy,2010-02-13T23:51Z,"No-can-do on Angel Face, I think, unless I upload the uncompressed video: I can't get my video transcoder to convert that particular movie.

Might be best if someone else uploaded that one too."
