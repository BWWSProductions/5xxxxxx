Borderline is a south-of-the-border narc-noir staring Fred MacMurray, whose most important role in film noir was in Double Indemnity, a better movie by far than this one and a landmark noir achievement:

That is a must-see for the budding film noir-ist.

Borderline also stars the inimitable Claire Trevor, who would probably get my vote for Queen of Noir, with very good performances in Born To Kill:

and Raw Deal:
