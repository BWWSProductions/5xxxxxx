,rhflem123,2010-02-13T19:37Z,Thanks frankie-boy. This upload is a first. I don't really know how. If you want to re-upload it and put your name on it that is fine by me. I do not know why it says 0 seeders I am seeding it and it is being downloaded by others.

[T],frankie-boy,2010-02-26T03:36Z,"Thanks for your reply, rhflem123. You need to place commas between each tag, to make them work with searches, i. e. ""Film Noir,Richard Widmark,1947"""
