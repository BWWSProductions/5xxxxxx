---------------------------------------------------------

Michael Crichton's novel opens on the threshold of the twenty-first century. It is a world of exploding advances on the frontiers of technology. Information moves instantly between two points, without wires or networks. Computers are built from single molecules. Any moment of the past can be actualized - and a group of historians can enter, literally, life in fourteenth-century feudal France. Imagine the risks of such a journey.

Not since Jurassic Park has Michael Crichton given you such a magnificent adventure. Here, he combines a science of the future - the emerging field of quantum technology - with the complex realities of the medieval past. In a heart-stopping narrative, Timeline carries you into a realm of unexpected suspense and danger, overturning your most basic ideas of what is possible.

If you liked "Pillars of the earth,world without end, wheel of time) you'll like this one. Three Historians travel back in time to save a freind and then find themselves trapped there.

WOW was our english so hard to understand back then....enjoy the book, I did. For more on Olde English look upthis is the lords prayer in Olde English...close to our langauge, but if spoken fast we would not understand it. 

    If you like stories about the 10th century and up try a listen to, Pillars of the Earth, and the sequel World without End. both are very long but very good.
