,aappleshampoo,2010-02-12T15:56Z,"Do you rename other people's releases, don't you? This one is a XS release, and all ""your"" previous releases are QoS. You should just upload them here instead of doing it while claming them as your own."
,aappleshampoo,2010-02-12T15:58Z,You rename*
[T],Robston,2010-02-12T16:57Z,"To aappleshampoo

It doesn't matter where the release originated because if it isn't available on this site then the uploader should be applauded, not scolded.

How many files have you uploaded?"
,aappleshampoo,2010-02-12T18:35Z,"""Kay"" could very well upload the files keeping their original names, to show who was the REAL person/group of people that went into the trouble of making it available for all of us.

Also, I'd recommend you try Google next time you want something. You don't need to rely on TPB 100% of the time."
,TedLilly,2010-02-12T19:29Z,thanks for the up 
,bendlein,2010-02-12T20:09Z,"Great Series,many thanks."
,callmeem,2010-02-13T09:58Z,is anybody else having trouble with the sound on this? when i try to watch it the sound goes into extreme slow-mo mode...
[T],Robston,2010-02-13T11:30Z,"aappleshampoo

I don't rely on TPB, good that it is, I use private sites as well so I actually had this file just before the TPB torrent had finished. Then I linked the completed file to the TPB torrent and started seeding from my seedbox at around 8MB/s, thus reducing the download time for TPB users considerably.

My original point was just say thanks, don't moan."
