,FrasseDaMan,2010-02-11T23:22Z,"@denniz94

Unlock using Jetmouse Keygen v1.5 5-digit version with checksum fixed.

Use MapSource v6.15.11 special to avoid problems with newest releases of CNEUNT & CNNANT.

Works great on Win7 to my Nuvi 255w."
,traxstar7,2010-02-12T13:55Z,"There's instructions.
Just open a new .txt-file and paste the System Information File.

Add your Unit ID.
Choose Custom Map set and add the Map ID 2200.

,emisaki,2010-02-12T21:25Z,What is it that has been updated since this version of Garmin City Navigator Europe NT MapSource 2010.30? Where can I find information?
,FrasseDaMan,2010-02-13T07:33Z,"@TheRealNinja

Use the JetMouse KG v1.5
Enter UnitID or Memory Card ID (CID)
Choose  and use MapID 2200
Generate unlock code (25-characters)



@jmgacarvalho
- This is only for install on gps ?

It's a full Garmin MapSource installation. Maps can be used on PC, Mac or GPS. Also works with Garmin Mobile PC & Garmin Mobile XT.



@deguim

Unrar also the garmin_rmu_cneunt2010_30c.exe file. Goto IMG directory and install with CNEUNT2010_30Update_***.msi file for your language.



@emisaki

CNEUNT 2010.30 had problems with JCV & Italian autostrada A4.

CNEUNT 2010.30b corrected name for JCV files and added some Spanish language support.

CNEUNT 2010.30c corrected problem with Italian autostrada/highway A4 earlier classified as an urban road.

Use JetMouse Keygen v1.5 to unlock.

My maps are in a computer that is not connected to internet. It would be unsafe to connect it to the internet. 

www.ovi.com offers free Navteq maps for several Nokia smartphones. Speedcamera files, traffic info and voice guidance, everything included for free. Garmin is going to the opposite direction, it seems..."

[T],Nincsenex,2010-02-14T01:29Z,"@Simon2672
Use older MapSource, like 6.15.7.
Download from here: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5343160/
It will let you use the 25 char key.

@leann1353
find the extracted files, and run the CNEUNT2010_30Update_ENU.msi from the IMG dir, instead of setup.exe. It will bypass product key requiroment."
,Zlirre,2010-02-14T10:28Z,"Hi!

I have installed CNEUNT2010_30Update_SVE. in img and updated MapSource to 61511th

,traxstar7,2010-02-14T16:20Z,"Install from the IMG-folder.

It will create 2 folders on Win7, other if using XP.

Anyway, on the MapSource-folder, replace with the patched mapsource.
Some say, you can use older version too, like 6.15.7.

In the keygen:
Your Unit ID, is in your GPS settings.
Choose ""custom map set"" down on Select Map Product.
Map ID is 2200."

I tried to follow the instructions provided but experienced the same problem as a lot of you have; I can't unlock the maps.  

I tried installing an older Mapsource using a 2010.2 map download, but once I install the 2010.3c map, the newer Mapsource just overwrited the older Mapsource.

So how are we meant to install the older Mapsource, and to stop the 2010.3c Mapsource overwriting any older versions?

Many thanks in advance."

,traxstar7,2010-02-21T17:01Z,"First of all, Which OS are ya'll using, XP, Vista or Win7 ??

If you cant extract, maybe just try install it.

Try get the good mapsource and just replace it."

When all files have been downloaded in RAR Format... Extract them to where ever u wish.. which will then give u a Single Exe file which is also a self extracting file... 

My suggestion here would be to Extract that file with winrar instead. 

I found extracting the exe file by its self left alot of files unextracted and the .msi ( enu ) setup file could not find some required files !  But with Winrar all files were there ;)
