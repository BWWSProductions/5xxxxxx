What use do I have for it?
----------------
1. you can make her speak the text, article, report and save your eye strain!
2. It works on MS Powerpoint 2007-10 Presentations so, you can make her speak in lovely voice during the presentation!
3. If you set her for MS Excel 2007-10, she can read every cell after you type in it, so you can confirm the data with out having to look at the cell!
4. She can read webpages, emails everything for you ! and if you use Dragon naturally speaking software, then Dragon types as you speak and Julie speaks any typed text so you don't have to use keyboard again!
5. you can record her voice too ! using Textaloud. so i.e. you want to make a presentation video onbut don't have good voice skills! then use her!
6. You can use it to home-school your kids! all you need is the articles/ stories & she'll read them to kids for you !
7. alright man I'm running out of ideas now, but she does have plenty of uses!
