For all TEFL / EFL / ESL teachers out there (and perhaps some students), I present a small 
collection of useful materials. 

All in PDF format. I have also included the Foxit freeware PDF reader in this torrent. 
This uses low system resources to do the same job as Acrobat. 

Please seed to a 1.0 ratio at least, as I can only seed for a short while. Tell your friends if you 
think they'll find it useful :-) 

Please seed, I'm a traveller and my connection is variable. 

This is my first time making my own torrent, so I hope it works for you. 




lots of love from A.N. Othertefl-Monkey

Have fun, I hope you find something useful here. 

If you don't use it, I recommend getting the Firefox web browser. It makes web browsing and 
lesson planning easier, among other things, such as greater security than the Microsoft alternative.
