Project Camelot interviews Aaron McCollum, January 2010.

MP4 01:26:29 English subtitles

Aaron McCollum is a very bright straight-shooter who is coming forward at this time to raise awareness regarding what he believes is going on in the Gulf of Aden.

He considers himself to be a "third generation member of the MKUltra Project Talent", the same project that Duncan O'Finioan and Dave Corso were a part of. Specifically, he was involved from a young age in a top secret program called Project Seagate. More about this to come in a second interview. He is a former leader of a special unit for the U.S. Coast Guard and is coming forward at great risk because he firmly believes the time to speak out is now.
