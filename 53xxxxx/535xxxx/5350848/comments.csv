,Fourthinline,2010-06-23T17:01Z,"Hi, guys. i just thought i'd let you know that i've found a really great site where you can watch all of Naruto and Naruto Shippudenfor free and it's dubbed in English! However, the site won't let you download the videos so if you want to keep them or transfer them to another device, you'll still need to download this torrent.

The site is: www.anime9300.com

Check it out and enjoy!"
