After Brian is killed by a mugger, he faces a spiritual trial where God will judge his life and pronounce a sentence: eternal life or damnation. Before making a decision, God summons witnesses to testify about Brian's character. The hearing forces Brian to reevaluate some of his important choices and reawakens the religious feelings that he allowed to lapse. Carl Anthony Payne and Clifton Powell star in the Emmbre Perry production.
