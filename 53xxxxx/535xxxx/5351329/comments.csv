,Zernicus,2010-02-22T07:36Z,Hi and thanks for your comment! Im well aware of this. But E15 was nowhere to be found. Does it really exist? 
,tipst3r,2010-02-28T20:53Z,"It's weird, I can't find a definitive answer for what's going on with episode 15.

IMDB says the next episode airs March 6th, but doesn't say which episode.  And makes no mention of episode 15.

Wikipedia says episode 15  is currently ""unaired""  

I think we might see Episode 15 on March 6... if not, I don't know when."

but there was never an aired version of episode 15"
,ccorels,2011-04-03T20:18Z,"I really appreciate the compilation.  Must comment for other downloaders that the quality is pretty poor.  It's watchable from a laptop or small screen, but seems better suited for an iphone."
,vivatpb5776,2011-04-06T14:20Z,"Let me clarify what ccorels referenced. Yes, the quality is not the best; however, it is definitely not ""pretty poor."" In fact, that statement is relative to the device on which you watch the shows. The episodes are in full screen so an older CRT monitor or a smart phone is your best bet. Watching the shows on a larger LCD monitor is possible but no practical because of the full screen size. Streaming this to a larger television is not recommended because of the picture quality.

Overall, I am thankful that the uploader uploaded this .torrent. The only issue I have, and yes this is nit-picking, is that each episode is in its own folder...no need for that.

Thank you uploader."
,LJE111,2011-05-05T06:55Z,"I downloaded the first episode to check quality --  it is perfectly watchable on my 32"" TV. (I run a USB from laptop to TV.)

Thank you Zaenicus for the great up! "
