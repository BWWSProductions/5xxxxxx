Product Description:

Tipper hails from Wimbeldon, England, where he's become known as one of the world's best nu-breaks artists. He has always taken chill out to new heights, adding depth and intricacy to his score of heady electronics. Emotional warmth fills the ones and zeros, along with his usual sonic extremes, creating an album that is at once moving and honest. Surrounded will change the way you listen to music.
