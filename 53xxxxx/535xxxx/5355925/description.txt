Comic series published by Marvel based on the animated television series created by animator John Kricfalusi.  The series followed the adventures of Ren HÃ¶ek, a psychotic "asthma-hound" chihuahua, and Stimpson J. Cat, a dimwitted Manx cat.  They wander around having nonsensical adventures in a style reminiscent of the Golden Age of American animation, especially the 1940s cartoons by Bob Clampett and Tex Avery.
