Contains collected audio/music from Red Dwarf series 1-8, some of which is custom edited from DVD audio tracks. Additionally there is a composite video created from several of the opening montages, backed with a custom edited theme song created from the opening and closing themes from two seasons.

I have included some sheet music, lyrics,  and a Sibelius file of the theme.

Note: there are NO FULL episodes included here. This is mainly music from the show and a music video.	

NOTE - the USA pilots are available via torrent. If you can't find them, I may repack/reseed them later.
