Thanks "
,ineff,2010-02-13T09:45Z,"It appears it's ok .. Loads of people have downloaded it and no negative comments

Please seed though :)"
,Kee123,2010-02-13T13:17Z,"Thanks for this! Been waiting for it for ages.

 Bit of a shame about it being 4:3 though, you could try using Handbrake to rip the DVD, which does it straight to AVI or anything, it's better than converting the VOB files. http://handbrake.fr/"
,ineff,2010-02-14T11:46Z,"Thanks for the advice 

It's the first time I had ever done this so just learning as I go 

its still excellent tho .. I go to ATP festivals as much as I can :)"
,ineff,2010-02-14T13:57Z,"I downloaded handbreak ... It will only rip it to mpeg4 (ipod) but the quality of the sample i did was excellent .. Will just convert it to avi once it's finished .. Will prob use super (any other suggestions?)

I tried other programmes to rip the dvd but the quality was awful "
,Kee123,2010-02-14T22:12Z,"Don't worry about it now if it's too much hassle. I just watched it and the quality was great, didn't even seem 4:3 as it played in widescreen on my TV. Thanks alot!

,medoralim,2010-02-21T19:11Z,"ah been waiting for this one. cheers ineff

having issues with the file unfortunately.. with vlc I get no sound only picture and the aspect ratio flips out while playing, constantly changing. with windows media I get audio but no picture..

sounds like it's working great for some folks. what are you all using to watch?"
,ineff,2010-02-23T17:19Z,"Oh that sounds odd!

I just used windows media player .. Maybe you need a codec or something? I created it using windows7 .. Maybe that has something to do with it? 

shame cos its really cool :)"
,medoralim,2010-03-09T07:29Z,"tried on several machines, both pc and mac, and various players with fully updated codecs. also downloaded the file a second time thinking it may have been corrupted with same results..

odd..........................

if somebody else could rip this 'normal style' I'm sure people would appreciate it. cheers"
,cinto,2010-03-13T23:55Z,no audio? the file doesn't show an audio track..
,ineff,2010-03-18T14:01Z,"Well I just downloaded it again myself and it works fine.

I suggest that you do what I did originally and actually buy the DVD. 

I shan't be uploading again :)

Roll on May for the Matt Groening Weekend ... Woohooooo!! "
,cinto,2010-03-20T19:39Z,"Info shows FMP4 format. whatever that is, it works fine after converting to divx. thanks for the nostalgia ineff!"
,medoralim,2010-03-21T07:13Z,used AVI FourCC Changer to convert to xvid. works fine now
,3nipples,2010-09-24T09:29Z,thank you
