All Tomorrows Parties - The Movie 


In an out-of-season holiday camp on the coast of England, alternative music festival All Tomorrowâ€™s Parties serves up a heady combination of alternative music, crazy golf and chalet-living; all curated by a single band or artist. This post-punk DIY bricolage uses material generated by the fans and musicians themselves, on a multitude of formats and over the history of ATP, to capture the uncompromising spirit of a parallel music universe. All Tomorrowâ€™s Parties was created by All Tomorrowâ€™s People and Jonathan Caouette.
