To most people, Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private are just four cute penguins living in the Central Park Zoo. And thatâ€™s exactly what they want people to think. Why? Because these placid-looking penguins are actually an elite strike force with unmatched commando skills and a secret headquarters. Their mission? To maintain order in the zoo. Their nemesis? Their obnoxious new neighbor, King Julien. This party animal and self proclaimed "King of the Lemurs" is new to the zoo...and he's looking to shake things up.
