    Visible from space, Africa's Great Rift Valley runs        
    three thousand miles from the Red Sea to the mouth of     
    the Zambezi. It's a diverse terrain of erupting          
    volcanoes, forest-clad mountains, spectacular valleys,    
    rolling grasslands, huge lakes and mighty rivers, and      
    is home to crocodiles, hippos, lions, elephants, flocks   
    of flamingos and a diversity of indigenous peoples.      
                                                              
    Using state-of-the-art high definition filming             
    techniques, this series investigates the geological       
    forces which shaped East Africa's Great Rift and which   
    make it one of the world's most wildlife-rich             
    landscapes.                                                
                                                              
    The Great Rift Valley provides the stage for an epic     
    battle between trees and grass - its course influenced    
    by volcanic eruptions, landscape and rainfall. On its      
    outcome rests the fate of Africa's great game herds. In   
    the Rift's savannas, grazers and their predators         
    struggle to outwit each other, forcing one group of       
    primates to develop a social system that paved the way     
    for the evolution of mankind.
