The Breach by Patrick Lee (Debut novel)

Formats included: 
epub, mobi, lit, lrf, pdb, pdf, txt, html

Personal note: Rarely have I enjoyed a debut novel as much as I did this one by Patrick Lee. I bought it, and encourage you to do it if you enjoy it even half as much as I did. Could not put the thing down. 

I did not edit the converted formats, but hopefully there are no errors. The mobi is the original (un-drmed).

Summary
Thirty years ago, in a facility buried beneath a vast Wyoming emptiness, an experiment gone awry accidentally opened a door.

It is the world's best-kept secretâ€”and its most terrifying.

Trying to regain his life in the Alaskan wilds, ex-con/ex-cop Travis Chase stumbles upon an impossible scene: a crashed 747 passenger jet filled with the murdered dead, including the wife of the President of the United States. Though a nightmare of monumental proportions, it pales before the terror to come, as Chase is dragged into a battle for the future that revolves around an amazing artifact.

Allied with a beautiful covert operative whose life he saved, Chase must now play the role he's been destined forâ€”a pawn of incomprehensible forces or humankind's final hopeâ€”as the race toward Apocalypse begins in earnest.

Because something is loose in the world.

And doomsday is not only possible . . . it is inevitable.
