Well, as promised...Glad to see I'm not the only crazy fan of the show!!!  Oh and FYI: if you haven't seen Rupaul's 2007 film "Starrbooty" then you must watch it.  It's part of the inspiration for this latest episode.  You can download "Starrbooty" right here at tpb or you can watch it on LOGO.

The dolls make it rain when they compete as burlesque dancers at a hot Hollywood nightclub and weather an unexpected twist. RuPaul is joined by guest judges comedienne Kim Coles and international burlesque star Dita Von Teese.
