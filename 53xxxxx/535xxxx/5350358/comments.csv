,TruthKnights,2010-02-16T15:13Z,How is this different from Pharaoh? Or is it the same under a different name?

These are different games."
,TruthKnights,2010-02-23T21:25Z,"OK, First this is in Russian I guess. So it doesn't work! One of the files is apparently written in a non Unicode language, so it can't be read for computers that don't have the language installed, and can't be unpacked.
Of course trying to rename the file results in an installation failure. The problem is all the messages are gibberish, so I can't really specify the problem.

Bottom line, doesn't work."
