This is the same movie you find on torrent sites, but you find it in .mkv format and 1.54 gb movie.
So, I just converted to .avi and reduce to 700 mb.
No subs, you can find it on opensubtitles.com
Japanese spoken language.

The movie is the same quality as .mkv version,
696X480 pixels
Codec Divx 5
Audio MP3 44100Hz 160 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo
Even after digital remake, the movie was made in 1955, so the video quality its not exceptional, but have a very good quality.
And the original audio is 1 channel mono, so I converted to 1 channel joint stereo.
A/9 V/9

The upload is good! 
Hope you enjoy
