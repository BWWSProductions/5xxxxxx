,pezed,2012-02-11T08:24Z,"Nice,the bit rate on the audio is a little low on this one""I'm not complaining"" at 1.7GB its a great DL, I am new at this . mp4's seem to work well for me and they burn nicely to a disc if I need to burn it. You have some of the best uploads on the Bay You Rock TPB Rocks. Thanks to You and all the other uploaders that make it possible for me and others to see movies and hear music that I would have never been able to experience  if it were not for you and others like you.
Thank You Soooooooo  Much."
