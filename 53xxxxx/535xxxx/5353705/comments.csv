Permalink 05:07:42 pm, Categories: Right-Winger Wringer  

One of the most powerful broadcasting firms in the nation, and champion of Right Wing propaganda, has filed for failure.
Administrative ineptitude is obvious, but the fact that America is waking up to the damage the Republicans have done to this country both economically and socially is the core issue. Those who promoted the Right Wing agenda are beginning to feel the sting of America?s resentment.
The fall of Citadel is a crystal clear reminder to the Right that Americans know who put us in the troubled times we face.

The Dumbest Decade in Business has shown us giant corporation after giant corporation falling flat on their faces due to irresponsible leadership at the highest levels. In some cases, this is good.
Citadel Broadcasting is an abomination among information networks.
Staunch supporters of BushCo and all Right Wing entities, Citadel shamelessly promoted Republican propaganda throughout the dark years (2000-2008).

Here in the South East, our local joke of a pseudo-Rock n Roll radio station, 101.5 WQUT FM, is Citadel owned. They preached, and still proudly preach, the Right Wing screed that brought this nation to an all time low.
From fake, Citadel created PSAs against important issues such as Health Care reform and compensation for recording artists to the actual blacklisting of anti-war artists such as Neil Young and Steve Earle, WQUT(Citadel) and it?s corporate kiss ass program director, John Patrick, served the lie machine of the Bush Regime on bended knee and did so with a willingness that would make any sock puppet proud.
Citadel is also responsible for wastes of time and space such as Don Imus and Disney/ABC Fascist radio. Not to mention over 100 radio stations throughout the country spewing Right Wing lies and silencing truthful voices in true Corporate Fascist style.

Citadel, a classic example of monopoly-gone-wrong is second only to ClearChannel, another Right Wing establishment, in broadcasting power. Farid Suleman, the latest failure of a CEO, is the folly behind Citadel?s demise.
The company was founded in 1984 in Phoenix, AZ by Larry Wilson as Citadel Associates Limited Partnership. In 1990 it was renamed Citadel Associates Montana Limited Partnership for the purpose of owning and operating stations in Montana that were formerly owned by CALP. A year later, Citadel Broadcasting was officially incorporated and in 1992 it acquired all of the radio stations owned by its predecessors. Within a decade, Citadel expanded to 26 states. Within that time period, it absorbed all Bloomington Broadcasting radio holdings and 11 stations from Dick Broadcasting Company and also acquired 3 radio stations from Slone Broadcasting, Inc. and Slone Radio, LLC. In 2001, Larry Wilson sold Citadel to Forstmann Little for $2.1 billion. By that time, the company had grown to 205 stations in 42 markets.

Of course Citadel will get bailed out and continue to spread lies and abuse it?s position as a media outlet. Kinda like the FOX News of radio. But at least we know that when the most powerful of Right Wing broadcasting corporations bites the dust, the tide is turning.

Their creditors should refuse them. But they won?t. Hopefully continued failure is all that awaits Citadel Broadcasting in the future."

BWHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Aw, does little snookums want his biddy?

BTW, you may want to learn the actual meaning and history of what a fascist is before you use the term publicly.  Until then we will all sit back and laugh at you and your brainwashed nonsense."
,TedKennedy,2010-02-11T16:05Z,sonews: i hope someone farts in your cereal. 
,TedKennedy,2010-02-11T16:09Z,"i say let them fail, Clear Channel will carry the torch no problem. people love rush (unlike the condescending folks on Air America who pretty much just talked to hear themselves do so because its not like anyone actually listening...) so he will be on the air as long as he has a heartbeat. "
,thunderbum,2010-02-11T16:53Z,"@sonews: awww. Does little Snookums want a glass of milk and a cookie? I know you're crying because Air America is no more you poor liddle puddin'. Life is so hard. I'll send over Barney Frank to comfort you. Thank you for my daily laugh!

LOL! another sock puppet!"
