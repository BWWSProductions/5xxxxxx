Remastered at 320VBR  Source was RTR tape 20 to 20K +/- 3db.  I do not know the frequency range of the original broadcast, but in most cases OTR was / is less than 20 to 20K

Broadcast was 1972 Probably June based on the Rolling Stones concert in LA at that time.  There are interviews, rare cuts and some material that was unreleased the time.

KNAC in Long Beach, CA did a series of "An evening with xx" programs about 1972.

Some had band members interviews live and others did not.

Enjoy	and PLEASE seed.
