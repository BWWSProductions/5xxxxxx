Originally known as Ryan McPhun & the Ruby Suns, 
they changed to the latter some time in 2006. 
The Ruby Suns are signed to Lil' Chief Records in New Zealand 
and Memphis Industries in Britain. 
In early 2007 the band embarked on their first European tour 
in support of their self-titled debut album, 
and in addition to that they did a Take-Away Show video session 
shot by Vincent Moon. In the latter half of 2007, 
the band toured with The Shins extensively throughout Australia.
As of 2007, The Ruby Suns are signed to American record label Sub Pop. 
The band released their second album, Sea Lion, in January 2008. 
Later that year, the band recorded the song "Don't Touch the Dusty Fruit" 
to the Survival International charity album, Songs for Survival, 
and the song "Oh, Mojave" was used in the 
Windows Vista commercial for the Mojave Experiment.
In August 2008 The Ruby Suns contributed their track "There Are Birds" 
to an indie compilation album Indiecater Vol. 2.

The Ruby Suns' third album is titled Fight Softly 
and is to be released on March 2, 2010.
