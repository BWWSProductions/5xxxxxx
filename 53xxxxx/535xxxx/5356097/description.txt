This is a copy of the Online Driver's Handbook available here:
 
http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/driver/handbook/index.shtml

It's been stripped and edited (a bit too much in places) and is down to 2.62 megs.

Navigation is done in the areas in red indicated in the torrent image.

This is like a cam version of the actual online version
