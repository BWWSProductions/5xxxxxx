,WeeVee,2010-08-13T14:07Z,"Not working properly. Most of time video won't start. When it does, it's only for a few minutes. What could be the reason?"
,stupidneko,2011-01-04T08:50Z,works perfectly thanx hazzyd ill seed for a while
,CMNicho86,2011-03-02T07:51Z,"Thanks.. works great. 

Your directions got a bit confusing, but I found that all you need to do is:

Take the last 8 characters from the megavideo url and then open the runme.bat and input the characters when asked. Wait a minute and when notepad opens up with html jibberish close it and reload the megavideo page. Voila... Time limit bypassed.

Thanks"
,Cooler110033,2011-03-03T09:37Z,"This did not work for me (i'm running Windows 7, for support's sake). 

I put the last 8 characters in, as instructed, and the program did indeed spit out a special flash player for me to watch the movie i wanted in, outside of my internet browser, but when i click the play button it just loaded for a few seconds and then did nothing.

This doesn't work."
,TCBITW,2011-09-04T17:20Z,hey @stupidneko  how does it work?
,Mistress_Cara,2011-10-28T11:34Z,"I can't thank you enough, thx man! Works like a charm! If anyone has a problem where the play button doesn't work, try updating your flash and shockwave. Worked for me. Thx!"
,pqwo,2011-12-19T08:37Z,THANK YOU all i had to do is copy the last digets and past in runme.bat and click enter then a video poped up AND IT WORKED THANKS SO MUCH!!!
