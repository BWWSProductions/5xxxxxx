,D0ct0rFun,2010-02-16T02:09Z,No...that's Ivan da Hoe.
,SonOfBasuto,2010-02-19T00:48Z,"Thanks, Nighted. BTW, for those who enjoy colorful old films, this was a great movie (in color) with Robert Taylor and Elizabeth Taylor (probably at her most beautiful). Still available from Netflix or Blockbuster (or even, dare I say, TPB - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4496349/Ivanhoe.(1952)_Elizabeth_Taylor.avi)"
,Contrus,2012-03-15T12:29Z,Good!
