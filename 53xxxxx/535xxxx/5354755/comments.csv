@HellWatcher

Yes, it normally should take a little more time than normal. Just be patient.

,roflcoptar,2010-02-21T21:30Z,"Hi,

I'm trying to install this by using the setup that came with it, and it gets stuck on extracting files, I think because it can't find what to extract. What should I do?"
[T],Games4theworld,2010-02-22T14:30Z,"Hi,

   First extract áll the files in the .rar file to a file on your Desktop and then try again. It should work."
,RandHat,2010-02-23T21:16Z,"The installation is amazingly slow... and the setup slowed down my computer to the point windows explorer crashed..

like roflcoptar said, it gets stuck at the beginning though the bar does start filling up after 10-15 minutes.. but it gets stuck again a few times and after 45 minutes or so, an error message pops up saying something like ""unable to extract files"" or w/e and the set up exits.

,RandHat,2010-02-24T16:43Z,"Finally got the game to install after the 4th try and extracting all the files to desktop, thx for the upload.

One question though.
My rig is no where near bad, but the graphic is fckin horrible, especially during cutscenes, at the beginning where Miranda was talking to the Illusive man, and when Normandy1 was being shot at. And during game play as well, you can basically see the pixels at the edges of the character model.
Is this normal or is it just happening to me?
I'm running this game with everything at max, aspect ratio 16:0, 1920x1080.
I've also tried other resolutions but it only gets worse.

No, we're not familiar with this problem. For us the Game works exactly as it should. You could try to Google the problem.

,Roast_Zombies,2010-02-27T15:56Z,"Sounds like stuff has been compressed/removed, and the installer has issues. Probably not worth the download for the quality loss, unless the smaller size is important enough to trade it away."
[T],Games4theworld,2010-02-27T19:30Z,"Hi,

  So you think the quality loss is because we compressed the file? If that's true, we'll re-upload a good version of this Torrent. So please be sure that that's the problem."

,unknowndeviant11,2010-03-01T02:16Z,"PERFECT! Just had to extract, then run setup...wait about 45 minutes or so. Resulted in the full game with excellent graphics and the cutscenes were of high quality.

2 GB RAM
ATI Radeon X1950 Pro

[T],Games4theworld,2010-03-03T14:07Z,"Hi,


@dragonlord21

No, we just compressed the file more than we do normal, that's why the Installation takes more time, but you can Download the Torrent faster."
,ministryhellie,2010-03-03T21:06Z,"haha, can you believe they did the same shit with this game as they did with the 1st mass effect game, the copy protection is not compatible with most of the dvd drives, thus cannot be installed xD
I bought the 1st game and then had to download pirate version from it to be able to play it.
Now I have bought the 2nd game and same problem, my dvd drive doesnt read the disc xD
So I try out your torrent.
 I believe this is the 1st time I download a torrent from you, I will comment how it works after the DL is completed and I have tried to install it, hope it works, coz my legal copy of it sure doesnt =D"

See now, I get 2 of them. NOT JUST ONE, but two. I've never gotten 2 in my 12 years of computer gaming. I don't even want to try to reinstall it, waste of time.

I don't have the minimum but I know for a fact I can play this game because my friend has a worse PC than I do and he plays it on low. Any ideas why I get this?"
,ministryhellie,2010-03-05T07:45Z,"Allright, it took me about 35mins to instal the game.

I got 2 error messages when I tried to run the game, but regardless it works just fine, actually this torrent seems to run much smoother than disc version and I have had no problems during gameplay so far.

Sometimes the game crashes during the loading screens, but other than that, there hasn't been any issues.

Top quality torrent, thank you for the upload "

[T],Games4theworld,2010-03-09T15:00Z,"Hi,

   We did not test Patching the Game, but íf you do so, you'll need to Download a new Crack for the version you patched to. If it all goes wrong, just reinstall the Game."
,AngelRawr,2010-03-11T01:28Z,"well i downloaded the file, i extracted the file, but when i run the setup it just freezes up at the extracting file part. I left it alone for a while over-night and running while i was at school but when i came back it stayed exactly as it started last night. Help?"

   Please restart your PC and first extract áll the files in the .rar file to your Desktop. Then start the Installation again. It should work now."
,ro4eva,2010-03-12T03:43Z,"I've downloaded and installed both this version and the 14gb Razor1911 version and the only difference (other than the slightly different installation program) I've seen is video quality.  It looks like this version's video files (*.bik) have been re-encoded using a smaller bitrate.

There could be other differences however I haven't seen anything else as of yet.

Both versions (this one and the Razor1911) work flawlessly.

Thanks."
,skiff85,2010-03-12T05:05Z,"to all who are having issues playing the game, i was too until i used the following:

Sorry about my last comment, the dlc's work well except the one containing the Incisor sniper, it is a paid dlc and you have to use the crack given in it.
Unfortunately if the crack is used then you can't run the game, not with this release. Only one dlc doesn't work, remaining 11 dlc's work perfectly without the crack... xD"

,AznAssassin,2010-10-16T13:16Z,"My game installation crashed when it was installing directx9 for some reason (btw I have directx10 so i assume its just trying to detect which version i have, not really intsalling).

However, whne my PC restarted,the game runs fine. 

My major issue with this release is the movies in game (i.e. cutscenes which are not rendered in engine). Their quality is terrible and they often freeze while the audio continues out of sync. Its really annoying. This happened in the first few cutscenes but i am still seeing if any otehr cutscenes further in game have the same problem.

Overall, a great torrent by Games4theworld. Lets hope all the oteh cutscenes work well. I dont mind the dumbed down quality (i understand its for the sake of the small size if the release) but not being able to see half a cutscene is really something. Oh and my rig is past the recommended sys reqs and I can play on max settings so dont bombard me with messages to check my sys. 

8/10 for this release. Fix up the cutscenes and I'll give it a 10. Good work Games4theworld!

Download has slowed to 1.9 kB/s.  It'll be approximately 3 weeks before this is downloaded.  And to all those who have low quality cutscenes, that's not because of the compression, that's actually purely because it's the PC version."

,Xano999,2011-01-29T00:49Z,"All the in-game movies (many of the cutscenes) have been compressed to hell, a lot of it is blurry, especially text.

The actual gameplay is probably unaffected, but I don't recommend this if you can download an uncompressed version if you want better visual quality."

,BrckLanders,2011-02-25T20:07Z,Okay first of all some of you ppl need to do lot more research on how to dl and install this kind of simple torrent. Hald of the comments here nowdays are because of lazyness. Second big up for Games4theworld for another fully working torrent. Installed and worked perfectly last 6 hours i started playing this. my system windows 7 dual core 4ghz with ati radeon mobility 1gb card. oh and using POWERISO for mount lol =)
,DMNothing,2011-02-26T17:35Z,"Since people keep asking why this is so small, I think I have an answer: The original, 14G, version of the game comes with 5 differant languages. Thats 5 full game voice overs. All but english has been stripped out of this version.
Yes, those other four languages encompassed -10G- of data.
They probably didnt care though, since 14G costs them no more than 4G, since the data goes on a DVD. However for us downloading it..?
Thx for the seed. ^^"

Anyone know what to do? "

I'm downloading this next.  I will share my comments once I get this installed.

Thank you Games4theworld!  Keep it up.

I will seed ME1 for as Long as I can.  I only seed quality games that I personally recommend.

Keep sharing!  LEt us unite to deal with the reapers! :)  "
,lbbz,2011-03-20T00:00Z,"IMPOTRANT NOTE for installing:
If the installer gets stuck, make sure you're installing to a partition that can take files over 4GB (NTFS, or EXT2 if you have the driver). The files created by the installer are as big as 4.40GB, too big for FAT32.

Oh, and apparently, you don't need to unrar this to the desktop to be able to install. Only the destination mattered in my case.

Game works (so far), video quality is good. I don't need HD for cutscenes, and I see no compression artifacts.

2 thumbs up, this is GOOD."

,Yenrock7,2011-03-31T09:50Z,"the game installed perfectly, good graphics and sounds, but what i want to know is why the loading is very long, usually around 5-10minutes just to load. so far, this is the slowest loading game i have played.

is this normal?"
,B3ff3ct,2011-04-04T07:25Z,"As I've said, I'll piggyback a comment on this game.  Took me a while since i finished Dragon age origins, another awesome game from bioware. Better controls and gameplay, i like the sniper rifle and the headshots.  better than ME1 although the story could have been a lot better with more side quests.

Installation went smoothly, follow instructions and everything was up and running.  just remember to click compatibility mode and run as administrator solve most issues.  i.e PhysX.

playing the game the second time around on insanity level. got 1 team member killed the previous game.

system sony laptop win7 4g 512graphics core2 dou 2.6

occassionally i get a system crash, probably my graphics card overheating. ;)

some ingame bug where you get stuck on some areas, keep your quick save handy.

other than that, worked like a charm.  thanks Games4theworld. "

The torrent itself works perfectly. I extracted and ran but was faced with an error: Error extracting one or more of the files. I re-extracted with no difference, so I extracted again to desktop and closed all programs running. Not sure how long it took to install (I ran it for about 20 mins then went out for lunch for about an hour. I came back and it had completed, so I ran the game and it worked like a charm :D

,Chudface,2011-07-08T18:17Z,"K since nobody replied to my comment, I'll reply to my own comment. I figured it out: you need to ""Configure"" after installing in the launch menu. You go to some option there that lets you select your Mass Effect 1 saves folder. This was in My Documents under Bioware for me. 

On another note, to the people asking about the quality of this torrent, I too noticed that the cinematics and load screens were in pretty bad quality. The colours are not properly aligned, so you'll have red and green shadows everywhere. That being said, the game itself is 100% functioning and honestly, there aren't many cinematics. For 10 GB less of your bandwidth, I'd highly recommend this torrent. "

because like EvilCorporateWhore said i don't want to sacrifice video quality just to saved a few hours in downloading. And also the DLCs can be installed into this?
thx :] sorry for my english"
,Chudface,2011-08-13T18:03Z,"@sytcor: Once you install the game and see that it works, you can delete the downloaded isos that you used to install it. They take up space on your disc, but aren't actually needed to run the game.

@tread29: As I said before, the cutscenes are in pretty rough quality. There is some sort of shifting of the different colours, so you see some sort of green or red shadow next to everything sometimes. If you really like high quality cutscenes, then I don't recommend this torrent. I don't know anything about the DLC's as I haven't installed them yet, but judging by earlier comments, you should be able to install them."
