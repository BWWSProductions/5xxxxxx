After a five-year layoff, Van Zandt returned to the studio for one of his most solid, concise albums. Unlike the compressed singer-in-a-studio sound of his early recordings, FLYIN' SHOES features sympathetic, organic backing from greats like Chips Moman, Jimmy Day Spooner Oldham. This helps Townes' subtly poetic tunes to come across. "When She Don't Need Me" and "No Place to Fall" are elegant love songs that depart form the country-folk style in the manner of DELTA MOMMA BLUES' "You Are Not Needed Now." "Snake Song," "Dollar Bill Blues" and "Rex's Blues" are classic Townes; dark, incisive imagery and simple-but-effective folk-tinged melodies. The title tune is a beautiful ballad that casts a hopeful eye toward spiritual redemption.
