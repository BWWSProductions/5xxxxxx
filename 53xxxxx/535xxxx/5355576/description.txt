I have been Gathering Family Guy episodes one by one for a few years now and decided to share them. 

This is a complete Collection of every episode from Season one up to the latest episode (Dial Meg For Murder) Wich aired on Jan 31st 2010.

For a complete list of Episodes in this collection please see this link 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Family_Guy_episodes

I hope this can help some people replace their non complete collections or for those who are jsut starting to collect episodes a jump start.

Each season is individually foldered and labeled with the correct episode name and all files will stream correctly to an Xbox or Ps3 and are presented in 512x384 ratio and look perfect on a 48in Plazma

This is my first torrent and my computer will seed 100% of the time (unless i am playing MW2)
