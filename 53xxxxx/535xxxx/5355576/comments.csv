,oufan75,2010-02-13T11:30Z,Seed plz!
,oufan75,2010-02-13T12:07Z,"Able to play parts of the download. Seems like good quality. Will comment later when finished DL. 

Thanks for the work bajungadustin. So far looks good."
,bajungadustin,2010-02-13T12:54Z,"@oufan75 

Thanks! This is my first torrent and its only been up for about 2 days. So far 2 people have completed the download because they were seeding for like an hour but then quit.

Im not sure if there is a way that i could speed it up. i checked all the settings in Vuze for seeding and they were fine as far as i could tell.. yet i feel like the fact that i am only uploading at 125kB/s is a lot less then i should be uploading at. i get 2mb downloads most of the time. i dont know what i can do to make it go faster as this is my first torrent."
,oufan75,2010-02-13T13:12Z,I will seed for awhile once download is complete. 
,oufan75,2010-02-14T03:24Z,"709 leechers and just 3 seeders. Come on people. From the complete files I have downloaded, this is very good quality. 

Please Seed!"
,salgoodlookin,2010-02-14T21:37Z,my anti-virus software found viruses on this. Do not download this unless you want a trojan
,bajungadustin,2010-02-15T03:41Z,"@salgoodlookin your anti virus is broken. unless Vuze put a virus in it when i made the torrent. I personally put this torrent together and i can assure you there is NOTHING in this at all. 

You either need to get your antivirus checked or switch to a different one.

There is nothing malicious in this because for one... i dont have a virus on my computer
two... i scanned this folder and its clean
three... i dont even know how to make / incorporate viruses into a folder full of nothing but videos. NOR do i even have access to viruses that i could even include in the torrents.

So... please... before you go around slamming my torrents (my very first torrent for that matter) get yourself another virus checker and do it again. you also may want to check as to waht else may be causing the virus checker to read a virus in this file because maybe you have a virus somewhere else on your computer.

My computer and this torrent are VIRUS FREE

Thank you in advance.

On another note.. most, if not all, were downloaded from EZTV... so... unless EZTV somehow incorporated a virus into the video data itself then these videos are clean. 

For one i dont even think that is possible to hide a virus in the interior data of a video file. And even still... i personally checked all of these. And i think that if he had then other people would have called him out on it and he would not be a VIP on TBP.

So Either your antivirus found some string of code that it deemed malicious that wasnt really or EZTV found a way to hide a virus in his videos that hasnt had any effect on my computer and didnt show up in my antivirus and you are the first person to find a trojan in these videos...or....

Your antivirus is mistaken.

sorry im just having a real hard time figuring out how ther could possibly be a virus in this torrent. I even re ran the check on the videos and the .torrent file and everything came up clean. I sure as hell know that i didnt put one in there."
,oufan75,2010-02-15T11:41Z,"@sallgoodlookin

I have downloaded 50% of this torrent and have no viruses or malicious software. "

Hey, don't pay attention to this guy. There are a lot of people uploading great torrents and there is always a jackass that wants to mess all the fun. Just keep up the good work, and ignore the stupid comments like that one, ok? Thanks for the upload anyway :)"
,Iainl,2010-02-17T01:22Z,Hi Could someone please seed this for me so I can complete the down load. Will seed when I have it too!!!
,bajungadustin,2010-02-17T23:08Z,OK... since i am new to torrenting i have a problem. I just reinstalled Windows due to a video card installation flub and i reinstalled vuze and i am no longer seeding this torrent.... What do i need to do to be able to seed it again? when i try to drag the torrent file to the downloaded section to seed it it starts downloading it. I am a little bit lost as to how to go about getting the same torrent back online so i am still seeding it withought making it so everyone would have to redownload the info over again?
,paulabe,2010-02-22T17:26Z,"Dont bother getting this torrent. Ive been downloading for two days and now Im stuck at 82.6 because theres never a single seeder on here. Basically everyone is stuck at the same percent. At this rate, Ill be running this torrent for the next 10 years. "
,beluuuuu,2010-02-28T16:54Z,"Seed! for the love of god, seed! everyone is stuck on 87.4%!!"
,carmelathegreat,2010-03-02T19:07Z,seed please im stuck on 87.4. seeeeeeeeed
,livetorrents,2010-03-13T16:40Z,"What the FUCK is the point of uploading if you are NOT FUCKING SHARING IIIIIITTT!!!

God... Why do I even bother sending a comment."
,MOONEYAOW,2010-03-13T21:07Z,i dont know if anyone else has this problem but i can only download 88% of this then it stops. 
,MOONEYAOW,2010-03-13T21:08Z,sry didnt read other comments   SEEEEED!!!
,bajungadustin,2010-03-16T01:19Z,if you read my comment above you will specifically see me asking for help on re-torrenting this with vuze... this is my first torrent and i had to reinstall windows and the torrent was no longer sharing... so.. thats why you are stuck at 80%... because no one wants to help me get it back up and running.
,bajungadustin,2010-03-16T23:01Z,"OK... seeing as no one wanted to help me figure out how to get this seeding i got help from a guy in the netherlands on how to get this file seeding again..

sorry for the delay but getting this file to seed again after re-installing windows was something that i have never done before and never thought i was going to have to do.

i do appologize for the delay but the torrent is back up and running again so please if you finninsh it seed it for a while so others can get it up and running as quick as possible

thank you,
Bajungadustin"
,bajungadustin,2010-03-16T23:05Z,"-- I specifically left this torrent in raw form no rar.. no zips.. so that people can watch it directly from their seeding location.. 


if you do need to move it for whatever reason (streaming probably) then simply move the family guy folder then open up your torrent doanloader and add a new torrent... select the family guy torrent and then set the download location to the parent folder of the new location for family guy. click next or done or whatever your program has and let it check the file and when its done it will be seeding again."
,bajungadustin,2010-03-21T04:34Z,"i love how all those people complained about other people seeding... and as soon as theirs are done the stop seeding it. went from 89 seeders listed here to 38 in 1 day..

what a bunch of losers"
,oaktreerhs2010,2010-03-22T17:50Z,i have audio through windows media 11...did i do something wrong that its not showing the video??
,bajungadustin,2010-03-26T17:55Z,"You must have done something wrong. these video all work fine in WMP11

If you have not done so you may want to get CCC (combined community Codec pack)

http://www.cccp-project.net/

and download the CCCP on the left.

if this doesnt work then you have a bigger issue then your video on your computer."

Sorry that you had some bad luck getting this going. I had to move and I am just no getting back. I am downloading now. But unfortunately, I will not be able to seed until next week. Moving from apartment to house. 

Once I am back up and running, I will once again seed this for a while. 

Thanks for the torrent bajungadustin. "
