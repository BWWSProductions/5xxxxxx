,Teknokrat,2010-04-17T20:24Z,"I don't know why this torrent was abandoned by the uploader (at least that's the way it seems?).
It stopped on 27% and has been there for weeks now, with many ppl still trying to complete it.

I found the full files elsewhere, so I'll salvage this torrent and seed for a while until a bunch of ppl have finished it, and will let them take it from there.

Let me know if it works, OK?"
