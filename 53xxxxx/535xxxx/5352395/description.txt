In my opinion this may be Rivero's best show so far this year.  If you haven't listened to him yet, this would be a great one to try.

A few highlights...

A revival of interest in the 9-11 deception is occurring; National Geographic Channel in response in running their 9-11 truther "debunking" programming almost nonstop.
The White House has basically come out and said that anyone who criticizes the administration is aiding Al Qaeda; if we don't like the decisions that are being made about the economy or that Obama has just gutted NASA or we don't like the tie he picked out to wear today then we're aiding Al Qaeda; it's the same polarizing, "you're either with me or you're with the terrorists" that we heard from Bush.
Some major fluctuations in the stock market the last few days; what do these numbers really represent for a nation that has lost its manufacturing, that is a net importer of food, what are we producing and selling on which to base any kind of earnings forecast?  The Dow has become little more than a gas-guage of money being sucked away from the American people and given to Wall Street; What we have seen in the last 2 years is all the financial risk being transferred onto the American people while all the profits are being transferred to the banks.
Finding a job continues to get tougher; last year the number of available openings fell by nearly one fourth; at the same time, the unemployed population soared by more than one-third, leaving more laid-off workers competing for fewer jobs.
Talk continues about a jobless recovery; there is no such thing; the fact is that you cannot borrow your way out of a depression, you can't tax your way out, you can't legistlate your way out; you have to produce by growing or manufacturing something that someone in another part of the world wants to buy.
Everything that's coming out of the government and industry is finding more ways to take money from the people; we're being looted to placate the bankers, and shower money all over Israel, and of course pay for this new war [Iran] that they're cooking up to try to distract from the fact that they've run this country off the rails.
Obama's big new thing is that he's going to start a brand new federal agency to study and report on human-caused global warming, because he still wants those carbon taxes!!  All those other institutions have been totally discredited because they lied, but we're expected to trust this new one... because it's brand new!!
Goldman-Sachs wants you to have to pay by the mile to drive on US roadways; this is part of a trend toward "privitazation," which is the government taking infrastructure that was built with your tax dollars and selling it to private companies who will then charge you to use that which you've already paid for.


...all this is from the first hour and there's much, much more.



Mike manages to present powerful, persuasive stuff without screaming and yelling.
Please give his show a listen.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.

================================================================

Mike Rivero launched What Really Happened [initially called Rancho Runamukka] as a subpage on his business web site in 1993 asking pointed questions about the death of White House Deputy Council Vincent Foster.
As more and more investigations revealed more government deceptions, the project grew in size and eventually moved to its own domain [whatreallyhappened.com] where it resides today.
His WRH website is among the top ten ranked daily political news sites on the Internet, with a global readership in the millions.  What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.
Rivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening.
