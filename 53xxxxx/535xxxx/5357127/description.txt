Stripped is a live album by The Rolling Stones released in 1995 during the Voodoo Lounge Tour. The album is notable for being unlike any previous live release by the band in that it features a mix of intimate club recordings and live-in-the-studio reinterpretations of some classic and obscure recordings from their extensive catalogue.

The in-studio sessions were recorded in two parts: from 3â€“5 March 1995 in Tokyo, Japan and 23â€“26 July in Lisbon, Portugal while the live club dates are spread out from performances in London, Paris and Amsterdam.

UNPLUGGED:[Bootleg]

Quote from cover: This is a collection of studio outtakes from 1968 - 1973. Alternate versions and rough mixes of released songs, as well as unknown tracks (3, 6, 10). Together they make up for a superb "Unplugged" CD (with the occasional electric guitar here and there) recorded long before the days of MTV. 
[it's a great selection, not least because of the fabulous acoustic version of All Down The Line, which bears little resemblance to the standard version]
