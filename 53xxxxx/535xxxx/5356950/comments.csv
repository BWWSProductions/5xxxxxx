i hope all of you that downloaded this, know that your serial number gets used by the makers to develop more hacks, their not bothered if your serial gets banned."
,Craig87MW2,2010-05-05T02:56Z,"The VAC disabler by Supernova is still valid, because it's supposed to be private. 

Check out his confirmation.

for new version.
Also consider to use the external Hack. It only read memory and doesn't inject or write anything, so it's 100% Vac save."

,YourFlorist,2011-02-05T16:52Z,"To all the artards that keep telling us not to hack. Firstly stfu if you don't hack, then you wouldn't even be on this thread. Secondhacking is a way of life, we don't do it so we can win at everything, we do it because it is fun, personally I don't hack online all the time only a little, when I get bored, or to see if I can get this many kills or whatever, but those people who whine about us hacking are just getting pissy because they decided to waste their feeble little lives on actually getting good at a video game, it's called ""getting a life"". Cause I know damn well I certainly don't have enough time to sit here and get good at a video game, because I actually have sex on a regular basis, I mean sure I'll get on pb every once in awhile but damn."
