Download complete in just 5 mins"
,yversovs,2010-02-18T16:46Z,"I still can't save my game. I click ""save and continue"" and when I close and open the game again, it asks me to create a new user. It's so annoying because there's no point in playing this when I can't save the game.

Is this happening to anyone else? I tried three different torrents, but it's all the same.

(I guess that's because they are the same with different names)"
,narfdude,2010-02-19T06:37Z,"sorry that it's not working for you, I just tested it and everything works. maybe you have to run it as an administrator? if it's happening with three of them then maybe it's your computer or how you install them?"
,yversovs,2010-02-19T08:55Z,Maybe it's because I'm running windows 7. I've tried running as administrator and in windows vista mode. Unfortunately it still doesn't work :/
,narfdude,2010-02-20T01:36Z,"try saving and putting it in a save slot, otherwise, I have no why it doesn't work. I'm running 7 also, just so you know"
,jojost1,2010-04-15T19:02Z,"Good torrent!
nice game :)"
,dtmjp,2010-09-17T10:44Z,I also can not save my game... Does anybody know what´s wrong?  I also have windows 7.
,narfdude,2010-09-19T03:56Z,@dtmjp   could you describe your problem a little better?
,dtmjp,2010-09-19T20:00Z,"When I`ve played the game and I`m day 14 or something and I quit the game, than I save it. But when I start up the next time, than I have to fill in my name again and start all over again. 

I hope you understand what I mean =)"
,narfdude,2010-09-21T01:55Z,"yeah i get what you mean. i've never had that problem, but i dont play this game much. how many times has this happened? i duplicated the problem by removing my save file, which was in ""\Saved Games\Sandlot Games\Cake Mania Main Street"". it may have been caused by your antivirus detecting this as a false positive. as far as i know avira is the only one that does. you might be able to fix it by either reinstalling the game or adding the game file to your exceptions list in your antivirus. I hope one of these works for you."
,dtmjp,2010-09-22T21:45Z,"It happens every time I want to play the game again. Now I have reÃ¯nstalled the game, but it didn't solve the problem. 
I don't know how ""adding the game file to your exceptions list in your antivirus."" works...  I'm using McAfee for antivirus.

But other games just work as is should work, so I think the antivirus has nothing to do with it..."
,narfdude,2010-09-22T23:14Z,"the game may be running in compatibility mode.
right-click the cake mania shortcut on your desktop, click properties, click the compatibility tab, and uncheck the ""run this program in compatibility mode for:"" check box, if it is checked.
other than that i think it might be a problem with the game."
,dtmjp,2010-09-24T12:24Z,"It doesn´t work..  I will try another download or other game.
Thanks for you help anyway!!"
,misspinklady41,2011-01-04T01:15Z,I downloaded this and when I went to open my virus protection popped up saying possible virus.  
,narfdude,2011-01-07T00:01Z,@misspinklady41  you could try scanning it with a different antivirus program or you could just run and play it in a sandbox.
,alzy,2011-04-02T14:10Z,"Hey narfdude, I downloaded this game and it works in my notebook perfectly. I just follow the installation steps and it works. I can save my game and continue again from the last step I played. Thanks dude for this torrent. :)"
,kira41910,2011-04-03T19:23Z,its not saving my games either!!!! fucking damnit I got pretty far too!!!!! Narfdude U suck.
,dolfijntje95,2012-01-29T14:43Z,thank you very much
