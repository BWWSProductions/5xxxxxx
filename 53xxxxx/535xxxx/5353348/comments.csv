Also would be nice to hear comments about this release."
,jonbon0,2010-02-12T09:20Z,"downloaded this, nice speeds, when came to installing, double clicked setup.bat and got loads of errors saying system couldn't find path! anyone help?"
,jonbon0,2010-02-12T11:42Z,"btw, im using windows 7 home prem x86 and i haven't edited the setup in any way, and ive ran as admin"
,080586,2010-02-12T11:55Z,"Hi jonbon0

Unpack the complete RAR file into a directory like (for instance) c:\UnrealTournament\

If you drag and drop the folder from WinRAR you will get all the files in the right place for installation.

Then right click the setup.bat and select ""Run as administrator""

I have done extensive testing to make sure this installer should work as smooth as silk :)"
,080586,2010-02-12T12:40Z,"You might have UAC enabled.

Click Control Panel, type UAC in searchbox, Click ""Change User Account Control Settings"", Pull it down all the way to ""Never Notify"". OK

Windows prevents any installation if you have UAC enabled."
,080586,2010-02-12T13:09Z,"Check this out, this is how the installation looks :)

,jonbon0,2010-02-12T13:56Z,"@080586 I did what you said > http://bayimg.com/DAkfhAaCG < look at this image, it's my installing window. This was after i'd turned UAC to ""Never Notify"", your drag and drop and unpack technique with WinRAR, and then run the setup as admin, and none have worked.

Could you upload a screenshot of the files in the install folder and onlinecrack folder so i know i have all the files? Thanks"

Great pictures, I can see that xcopy.exe is not found in your console window.

If you look in ""C:\Windows\System32"" can you see xcopy.exe there ?

The installer cannot find this file and it should be part of your windows command files, thats why it doesn't work for you.

IF you did find your xcopy.exe file in that place you can add this line to the top of the setup.bat ""path %path%;C:\Windows\System32"" without the Quotation marks.

Right click the setup.bat and select ""edit"" then add the line above and save the file.

Good luck :)"
,jonbon0,2010-02-12T14:38Z,"OMFG THANK YOU SO MUCH!

After doing what you said, it installed like a dream. It runs perfect on my laptop, and you were a massive help!"

That's great to hear, it was all thanks to your screenshots. It's like finding a needle in a haystack otherwise :)

Now you can go online and play right away, serials and online cracks have been applied by the installer.

Enjoy"

Good Luck and have fun :)"
