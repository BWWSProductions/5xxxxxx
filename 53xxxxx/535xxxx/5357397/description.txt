this one is to complete the Criteria seeds. 
the later long version has been seeded by Son Of Thunder. 
this here is the earlier short version, video source, not the bad TV sync version. 
it basically features Bob on guitar strumming and singing. 
at the end there are a few seconds of the Munich 1980 footage of "Get Up, Stand Up".


I know RKL said to have a 1st gen copy with perfect quality. 
hopefully that version will pop up sometime... as of now, I hope you enjoy this one here.
