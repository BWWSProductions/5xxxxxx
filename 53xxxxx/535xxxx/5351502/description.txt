Somehow Audrey Hepburn made fluffy romantic caper movies look like high art. Take this adorable trifle directed by William Wyler
with Audrey looking glorious in her trademark Givenchy clothing. Audrey could have phone in a performance, but she's totally enchanting 
as always, making us overlook the seams in the script. 
She's beautifully supported by Peter O'Toole, who never looked handsomer or more Cary Grant-ish in his life as Simon, the art
expert who gets talked into stealing Audrey's father's statue of the Cellini Venus back from the museum when it is learned the statue
has to be authenticated for insurance purposes. 
Hugh Griffith, as Audrey's father, is a delightful rogue of an art forger and Charles Boyer and Eli Wallach just add to the fun. The
actual theft of the statue is quite ingenious, if a little too drawn out. 
Still, here's two hours of pure enchantment. That Ferrari still looks good nearly forty years later, and if Audrey was walking down Fifth
Avenue, dressed in Givenchy's stunning creations today, she'd cause a riot. Check out that lace cocktail dress with the matching
lace mask at the bar of the Ritz in Paris! It doesn't get any chicer than this.
