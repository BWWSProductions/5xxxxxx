IMAGiNE NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

This time it's edge of darkness.....our sources this time is the russian 8.67gig mts files and the really nice audio from Ghostman + Greenfrogr- (ELITE) (thanks and nice stuff).

Right by now you all know about the flicker on this release....ran a deflicker over it but it's done almost nothing.

The video is a tad on the dark side but overall more than watchable unless your really fussy.

We used the quad filter in vdub to allow us to cut the black borders only without cutting any of the video ....also we did our normal tweaking.

The audio was just a case of remuxing to the video ,oh and we used Rx's tweaked audio version (thanks).

This version is clear of all watermarks like the russian cams,ts's normally have,thanks to our good friend ELEKTRI4KA for supplying us the source files
