                    After 'losing it' at the party, Cook is up on a  
                    charge of GBH but insists on pleading "not  
                    guilty", much to the frustration of his  
                    world-weary lawyer Duncan. He's granted bail  
                    but given an electronic tagging order and  
                    curfew that applies to him residing with his  
                    mother Ruth in her imposing mansion. At the  
                    house, he is reunited with his younger   
                    half-brother Paddy whose nihilistic attitude  
                    and run-in with the police disturbs Cook who  
                    realises the example he's set is not so funny  
                    anymore. When Cook swaggers into college, he is  
                    expelled on the spot for his brush with the  
                    law. He is further humiliated by the intimacy  
                    he witnesses between Freddie and Effy and then  
                    goes to the police to confess to selling MDMA  
                    to Sophia. Effy comes to visit Cook in the  
                    Young Offenders Institution the day before the  
                    trial to reveal her true feelings - but is it  
                    Freddie or Cook that she really loves?
