In the meantime, as with previous versions of Aperture, if you want to extend use after the 30 day trial, simply find and delete the com.apple.aperture.plist file in you user Library/Preferences folder. The drawback of this approach is that you lose all of your preferences and settings and the program starts afresh like the first time it was opened!"
,rushy68,2010-02-11T09:37Z,The trial version we can dowload from the apple site. Can't we? 
,Rain_on_my_Soul,2010-02-11T10:15Z,"Yes you can download direct from here..

http://appldnld.apple.com.edgesuite.net/content.info.apple.com/Aperture/061-7447.20091117.ATtRe/Aperture3.0Trial.dmg

But that would spoil the whole point of Sharing :-)"
,vslink,2010-02-11T12:09Z,"Aperture is very popular, and SN's have been circulated within days after the last two versions came out. Patience everyone!"

Serials available and working in the above link via demomoid.

Mine now full version, please dont ask to post the serials here, as Apple will invalidate them.

Enjoy."
,vslink,2010-02-11T13:37Z,"Thanks ""Rain"". I have a Demonoid account and I got that torrent mucho fast. There are three volume serials in a small text file. The first one works, didn't need to try the other two. I have Little Snitch and Ap3 does not seem to phone home in any way to confirm a SN."
,Rain_on_my_Soul,2010-02-11T13:41Z,"Hi VSLINK,
I used the last serial in the list and perfect 100%.
"
,vslink,2010-02-11T13:48Z,"Rain et al., this link goes directly to demonoid torrent file and seems accessible even to non members (I logged out and experimented in all my browsers):

ww@@**w.demo$$$$noid.comMMMM$$/files/download/2131160/4702472

Cut and paste to the address line, remove the bot fooling extra characters, and the torrent file goes directly to your designated download folder--no Demonoid login needed at all.

PS, someone just posted an SN torrent here. Dunno if they are the same ones.

In general, Aperture lovers will be happy, it seems. This is a big step up. I love the addition of quite a few brush on non-destructive adjustments. That will save file space!"
,waleng,2010-02-11T16:43Z,"Here are three sets of serial numbers found on Demonoid:

E-346-DTS-276-WJE-172-UTP-074-KOZ-84X-5S7X
E-321-JAQ-387-KKC-187-GZN-111-NPT-1LB-5S7X
E-340-IGT-243-TLB-365-TBB-435-SXE-FFH-5S8X

Enjoy P2P! =P"

Well done, you posted the serials..

Apple will now remove these codes from future upgrades ..

Doh.. you dumb ass!
"
,zvoltaire,2010-02-11T23:10Z,"i have the same three numbers. first one worked. got them from a diff. site. 'Rain"" lighten up man. the guy was just trying to help. besides apple will have these number soon enough. I mean cant we all just get bleeding...together...along."
,vslink,2010-02-12T20:43Z,"Rain, I share your concern, but I figure the nerds at Apple know how to download and check the torrents to see what's out there just like we do. Posting to a thread merely increases the risk that a serial will be killed. FYI, my PB gotten serial for A2.1 was never invalidated in upgrades all the way to 2.1.4."
,zondar5,2010-02-13T04:28Z,One other thing you have a  entel machine so don't bother if you have a power PC
,luisugarcia,2010-02-14T02:44Z,"there was a torrent with 3 sn on it but im trying to instal it in my friends computer and they don't work now, too bad because it worked on my computer. It seem that they block it or something? does anyone knows what happen to this torrent?"
,amboo,2010-02-15T04:04Z,"i used the given serial no. (the first one) on my trial version and it did worked .....but   it still shows a trial version folder on my aperture screen ...(i mean the main folder that denotes the photos, events, faces, and places things)
does it shows to any one of your's too
...any idea how to remove that..... "
,Lolote123,2010-02-17T07:15Z,yea they don't work anymore
,niralramesh,2011-01-14T03:27Z,"Serial Permanent :
