"Why" is the title of a song recorded by American country band Rascal Flatts. It is the third single from their sixth studio album, Unstoppable. It was released to radio stations on September 29, 2009 and debuted at #44 on the U.S. Billboard US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of October 10, 2009. It was written by Rob Mathes and Allen Shamblin.

Roughstock gave the song a favorable review. Bobby Peacock of the website says of the song, â€œThe lyrics alone are beautiful, with the narrator asking just why a special person in his life had to commit suicide. Perhaps the best line is 'Why you'd leave the stage in the middle of a song' â€” a very striking metaphor.â€  The song also received special mention in Matt Bjorke original review of the Unstoppable album, where he wrote, â€œfor this album, "Why" the trio has found what might be their best album-ending track since their self-titled debut's "I'm Moving On." Levox has NEVER sounded better vocally and sings the questioning lyrics that make up the Allen Shamblin and Rob Mathes song. The song finds a guy asking why a friend would choose to 'leave the stage in the middle of the song.â€™â€  Chris Neal of Country Weekly gave it three stars out of five, saying that lead singer Gary LeVox "handles the lyric as delicately as its subject matter[â€¦] calls for" but said that the "climactic arena rock guitar solo[â€¦]rob[s] some of the song of its intimacy."
