Apollo Four Forty - Charlie's Angels 2000 (Soundtrack: Charlie's Angels)(2nafish)


Apollo 440 (alternately known as Apollo Four Forty or @440) are an English musical band formed in 1990. Since forming in 1990, Apollo 440 have written, recorded and produced four albums, collaborated with and produced other artists, remixed as Apollo 440 and as ambient cinematic alter-ego Stealth Sonic Orchestra, and created music for film, TV, ads and multimedia. During their eleven years at Sony, 1993-2004, they notched up 11 Top 40 UK Singles with three Top 10s, and had a chart presence worldwide.

Apollo 440 was formed in Liverpool by brothers Trevor and Howard Gray with fellow Liverpudlians Noko and James Gardner, although Gardner left after the recording of the first album. All members sing and add a profusion of samples, electronics, and computer-based sounds.

After relocating to the Camden area of London, Apollo 440 recorded their debut album, Millennium Fever, and released it in 1994 on their own Stealth Sonic Recordings label (distributed by Epic Records). They have successfully invaded both the pop charts and the dance floor with their combination of rock, techno, and ambient.

The band had been most known for its remixes until the release of Liquid Cool in the UK. However, it was not until the success of the singles "Krupa" and "Ain't Talkin' 'bout Dub" that their own musical efforts were brought to international attention â€” particularly the latter single contributed greatly to pushing Apollo 440 into the spotlight.

In 2007, the band played a tribute gig to the late singer Billy Mackenzie and decided to go on after that. They planned several more gigs and an album for 2008.

Apollo 440's fifth album, The Future's What It Used To Be, was to be released in 2008, but as of October 2009, the album is not yet complete.

Collaborators over the years have included Jeff Beck, Jean Michel Jarre, Billy Mackenzie, Ian McCulloch and Hotei.

Currently, the band resides in Islington, London, having once again moved its headquarters (affectionately labelled 'Apollo Control').

Charlie's Angels is a 2000 American action comedy film co-produced by Tall Trees Productions and Flower Films, distributed by Columbia Pictures, and directed by McG. The film is based on the television series of the same name from the late 1970s, which was adapted by screenwriters Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon, and John August. The film stars Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu as three women working for a private investigation agency.

Charlie's Angels is a loose sequel of the original series. John Forsythe from the original series returned as Charlie's voice. The film was followed with the 2003 sequel, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.
