Here's to number 13!"
,vandergraaf100,2010-02-10T12:52Z,Looking forward to hearing Jane! Ive never heard of them but there is an awful lot of stuff!  Thanks Spandau! You are the best!
,mountainvinyl,2010-02-13T02:07Z,Thanks!
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-14T00:08Z,"Thanks! Your comments mean a lot, I'm glad these are seeding well.  Let's face it, when I get to the end (eventually!) this will be massive in size, people who have downloaded the whole thing and kept all the music will have such a huge collection of this prog stuff.  I really like all the prog rock stuff, it's certainly never boring.  Just thanks so far for all the help that people have given to get this music out there to all the seeders and leechers who have helped to pass it around.  

I hope to get part 13 done soon, lots more to come yet, I hope that part 13 won't be unlucky either lol  Just kidding.  Obviously one of the big names coming next which is known to lots of people is King Crimson in the K section so I'm certainly putting up lots of their albums with all these lot like for example Red and Court of the Crimson King are a must!

Please bear with me for a while yet, I'm just doing some computer stuff at the moment, doing some machine rebuilding etc.. it's taking all my time up with work, hopefully once I get all my proggies back on again and I start converting more mp3s and get more of the Parts made up.  Everything is taking my time up at the moment, college, computer stuff, work etc...  I'm certainly not bored anyway lol  Got so much to be getting on with, I just hope I can get all this stuff outta the way eventually!"
,vandergraaf100,2010-02-14T11:31Z,I dont wish to look to far into the future but will you be including anything by the original nirvana? Im desperate for the album `The story of simon simopath` someone uploaded it on here but took it down before I could get it all! Thanks! Love Jane BTW! Top toons!
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-15T00:31Z,@vandergraaf100: Is there any other Nirvana albums besides that one you want me to put up?  If so let me know now and I'll get 'em for ya...  No probs matey :-)
,vandergraaf100,2010-02-15T23:52Z,To be honest SB thats the only one Im aware of but anything else you may have....Damn Id love to see your music collection! 
,Framez8,2010-02-16T15:05Z,Great uploads SB do you know of any Arthur Browns Kingdom Come albums please keep up the good work
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-16T20:56Z,"@Framez8: Yes, thanks, I have heard it before but wasn't planning on putting any of that stuff up for this.  Yes very psychedelic music..."
,Koosh5510,2010-02-22T06:18Z,"Thank you so much for sharing your amazing collection.  I love this style of music and I have never come across a collection such as yours.  My father-in-law got me into it when I first met him and I've been able to share your collection with him in return.  Again, thanks and we're both looking forward to part 13."
,gearofwar,2010-02-27T22:42Z,"SB, you make me so happy!"
,Bioshock1000,2010-03-01T19:34Z,"Hey SB, any idea of when we might be seeing part 13. I hate to be a pain, but I am so looking forward to that King Crimson you mentioned!!"
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-03-01T23:51Z,"@Bioshock1000: Yeah sorry about the delay, I've been so busy with college and I've been sorting out PC's these last couple of weeks, I've had to reinstall a few PC's that I was rebuilding and also I've been fixing this computer for a few days now, I've spent ages trying to figure out what was wrong with it, it is my mate's dad's computer, hopefully I have fixed it now.  I've had it for days now, anyway I plan to get working on 13 as soon as I can get back into the swing of making these torrents again.  Once I get 13 done I can then start making the next and so on and hopefully cover more ground."
,Bioshock1000,2010-03-02T21:51Z,No worries SB. Sorry to hear about your PC problems. Hope you get it sorted soon
,ProgPsychaStonerman,2010-03-05T01:14Z,"SpanduaBaby, you've pretty much become my hero.  Seriously though man, I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed this stuff, and a lot of it is music I may have otherwise never discovered.
BTW can you or anyone point me in the direction of some Secret Oyster or the Carpet Knights?  Can't seem to find any..."
,dagseoul,2010-03-06T03:14Z,"as always, it's a pleasure to participate in this:  to dl and to seed.

great stuff.  i'm listening to aquelarre now.  remember that, all the back to part one."
,TheLizardKingMike,2010-03-06T08:12Z,proper shite!!
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-03-06T19:24Z,"^ Ignore that last chump, I know him he is the king of all chumps.  Just cos I told him what I thought of him he can't take it so he's posting on my comments now as some kind of revenge tactic.  Very sad and pathetic!  He is a sad lonely guy who needs to get out more and get a life haha"
,vandergraaf100,2010-03-06T22:10Z,Dont worry we will! 
,Bioshock1000,2010-03-06T22:42Z,Yeah you're the bst SB. Best uploads on the net
