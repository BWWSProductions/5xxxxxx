,maphive6point1,2010-03-06T14:24Z,"Thanks for the upload heist.
Ignore the 12-year-olds having a bitch fight in the comments, that's not what the comments are for. They're for ratings, for saying thanks, and for comments related to the torrent.

Haven't seen it yet so I can't rate it, but thanks for the share. Will give it a DL and will rate if I remember. :P"
,dezzert,2010-03-08T23:17Z,A very good and thought provoking movie. Thanks man :)

,yelloo,2010-10-11T11:01Z,Thanks hiest.
,dlarrym1111,2010-10-24T06:59Z,"@dadyhacks I, for 1 didn't get the impression that you were serious at all, if you were serious, (making threats) then FUCK OFF, but I truly don't get that feeling from your comment. I feel its a severe OVER reaction from  and some others. 

Now: @u2r1I & @hiest:  
I may be wrong, (I have been B4, who hasn't?), but the comment about coming and beating hiest up if the upload sucked               (written by  < HacKaPeLL >) seemed to be TOTALLY Sarcastic. It looked like he was joking because he KNEW the torrent was NOT GOING TO SUCK. See my point?  Besides, HOW would anyone carry out such a threat.

IF, you KNOW for a fact, that this user  has a record of making threats before then I guess I am wrong.

TOO many people are wound up a bit too tight from I am used to. ANYWAY. 

Don't get me wrong, I am not taking a side on this, it just doesn't ring true to me as a REAL threat!

 has a great record of quality uploads. At least I have never got something he uploaded that wasn't top notch quality and maybe this guy knows this also.

 Again, THANKS  for another great upload! sincerely, dlarrym1111"

,malimacak,2011-01-08T21:28Z,"Thank you for the upload.

I can't believe anyone can say this is even a watchable film.  Bad script, terrible acting and even worse directing. "
,obrien101,2011-02-07T04:09Z,"Adequate quality UL, but film is honestly one of the worst pieces of crap that I've ever seen. I have no idea how this got an 8.0 rating on IMDB. Go figure. Watch it if you are a masochist with nothing better to do. Thanks for the UL anyway."

:)"
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2011-03-01T12:54Z,"Not your typical movie. No action no nothing. Just a bunch of people sitting in a room talking to a man who says he has lived 4,000 years. If you're bored or high this is somewhat an interesting  movie. If you're sober, don't waste your time.

Quality of movie is basic for your 700MB file size. So +1 on that."
,aienment,2011-03-14T07:29Z,Excellent quality mate. Thnx a lot.
,snowbirds,2011-04-08T03:04Z,"Someone said he was going to ""come back here"" and kick someone's ass if the movie sucked, and you guys felt threatened and reported it???

Just curious...  how is supposed to ""come back here"" and carry out his assault?  Is this TRON or something?  Could it be he was just joking?

Anyway, thanks for the up!  I've heard this movie is amazing. :)

I wish human society could recognize, that some people should not have been born, and if such a mistake was made, that they were put down. I would love to remove human garbage like dadyhacks and thus make the world a better, less corrupt and more friendly place."

,jjf3,2011-07-14T07:14Z,"Best Movie of All Time. In My opinion. I have watched a lot of movies in my time, mostly sci-fi and none have come close to this one, even with their special CGIs, graphics, and big-shot hollywood actors. No Movie compares to The Man From Earth!!!!! 10+ all around! "
,ChicaPirata,2011-07-19T01:33Z,"This movie is astonishing...  congratulations to the people behind it!
This is a Sci-Fi ""Dialogue"" movie like ""12 Angry Man"" where everything happens inside a room but the dialogue is so intriguing that you just can't let go.
In â€œThe Man from Earthâ€s case, the dialogue is so compelling that it will glue your eyes and ears to the screen and you either won't be able to let go or you will have to pause it to catch your ""brain's breath"" before you can continue! With my husband we made several stops to discuss about what we were hearing so we were almost like ""part of the cast"" taking sides, coming up with different viewpoints and questions, etc.  We really savor it all the way!
This movie is different, inspiring, smart, provocative, challenging, stimulating... Is an example of the sort of movies humans can do IF we use our brain, instead of making always the same â€œnot-so-much-entertaining-any-moreâ€ movies with explosions, cheap sex, gruesome violence, or scaring you with louds sounds rather than with really scary content... 
So I found this pledge by its director in another post and I looked it up and it seems genuine. They ask for us to throw a donation if you like it. Well, is only fear, right? Is like when you love a great piece of software but you never buy it and then you find out the company is out of business... so no more new versions or updates for you anymore, right? And you are like: ""Oh gee... I wish I would have bought it before"" And, it is too lateâ€¦
Well, this is your chance to have this Director and Producers to keep doing more movies like this!!! Help with money and help by sharing this pledge!!!
