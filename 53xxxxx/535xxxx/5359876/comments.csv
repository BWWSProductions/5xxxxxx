Sounds good.

For info to other travelers: *.mp3 format @192KBps, no art/scans.  Has Japanese language version of ""Always With Me"" but not EN version ... which was actually worthy.  Too bad it doesn't seem available on this CD.

FYI - I prefer to collect my music in *.flac, with 320 KBps *.mp3 being a nice close second.  Suggest to all that one of these options are minimum quality to upload.  Just my 2-bits, no attitude.

Peace!"
