         From playgrounds to office cubicles, we love chowing down     
         a meal from the lunch box. Ever wonder why a peanut butter    
         sandwich sticks to the roof of your mouth? Did you know       
         baby carrots might all be purple if it weren't for the        
         Dutch? What mysterious filling other than vanilla creme       
         used to be inside a Twinkie? Host Bobby Bognar seeks out      
         the answers to these and other intriguing questions as        
         he travels across America uncovering the secrets of our       
         favorite lunch box treats. Along the way, he discovers        
         everything from how the juice starts flowing into a juice     
         box before it has a bottom to hold it...to the surprise       
         that awaits us if we look inside a Goldfish cracker after     
          we bite it.
