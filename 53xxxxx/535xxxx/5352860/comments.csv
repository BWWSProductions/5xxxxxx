,Bujaaa,2010-02-10T22:44Z,Thank you very much for this. I hope that in the future you will be able to upload Zaed character and other upcoming ME2 DLC. :)
,daley89,2010-02-11T10:21Z,so am i right in thinking u cant burn this onto a disc with imgburn and just save to xbox hdd?
[T],thenoobish,2010-02-11T12:50Z,"Bujaaa: yeah i noticed u wanted this;) but i have no idea how to install this, hope u get it anyway;)"
,Bujaaa,2010-02-11T14:05Z,install using xport 360 program. You can find it at www.codejunkies.com And if you can please upload every DLC you can find for this game.
,Bujaaa,2010-02-11T23:56Z,Yes you do need a jtag done.
,yomatoshison,2010-03-06T18:21Z,"i already have a legit activated cerebrus account so i was wondering can i just transfer these to my xbox 360 without getting banned and these still working i only need a few of them such as blood dragon armor,inferno armor and collectors armor with assault rifle and incisor rifle i got everything else through codes so would that work? Please respond."
,ThePlatypus,2010-07-30T02:10Z,You don't need a JTAG but you need a flashed drive and patching program to spoof the system ID to your own consoles ID
,07paul,2011-07-12T23:26Z,"@ThePlatypus, How do you do that? I have all the DLC minus the DR. Pepper stuff (not available in my Country) & the Collectors Edition stuff. I'm pissed i didn't pre-order the Collectors edition in favour of a midnight release. If i could get those 'honestly' i would. But I can't :("
,Mark[MOD],2011-10-05T23:32Z,"ThePlatypus, You said JTAG is not required. How d'you install without it?"
