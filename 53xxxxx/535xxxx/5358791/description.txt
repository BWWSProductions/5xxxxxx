PLOT
Trevor Adams is a high school student who has threatened to bomb the school the year before. So as you know, everyone looks upon him with fear and loathing and all that from parents and he gets made fun of from his fellow students. But some, such as his film teacher (played by Tom Cavanagh) wants to reach out and help him. This is perfect because Trevor carries around a camera and his first assignment with him is to make a short film. Now, guess what Trevor's is about? A person killing someone because they were being stuffed into a trash can. So that's were it all starts.
