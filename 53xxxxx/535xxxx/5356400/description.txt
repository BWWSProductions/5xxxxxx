2009 American comedy film loosely based on the work and persona of writer Tucker Max, who co-wrote the screenplay. In an interview with Shave Magazine Max explained that the film is not "a direct recount or retelling. It says it is based of true events because it is. Basically, every scene in the movie happened in real life in one way or another but it happened in a different time frame, or at a different time or whatever. But pretty much every single thing happened." [1]  The film was directed by Bob Gosse and stars Matt Czuchry as Max. It was produced by Darko Entertainment and distributed by Freestyle Releasing, and is rated R for nudity, strong sexual content including graphic dialogue throughout, language and some crude material. Max had said previously that sequels were possible if the initial film found financial success.[2]  The film was released in theaters on September 25, 2009. The DVD was released on January 26, 2010.
