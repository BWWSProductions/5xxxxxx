,SmyleTorrent,2010-02-12T20:28Z,Creme is a blasphemer and the maitreya is an anti-christ.
,sammydog419,2010-02-12T21:03Z,So which one is bettter??  This one or the SilentNinja[ExtraTorrent]?
,redheadrebelchick,2010-02-12T22:51Z,"I have been waiting for this movie a long time, Thank you! I always look forward to your awesome torrents!! This is a very good decent copy, well worth the download!"
,sammydog419,2010-02-13T03:13Z,"This is pretty good quality. I love the first movie, but compared to the first one I would have to say it sucks. I can't believe it's the same writer and director. It's totally cheesy and the lines are just horrible. Sorry I am just disappointed. 
Good upload though, thanks."
,Spok509,2010-02-13T11:21Z,A/V is about an 8/7
,Spok509,2010-02-13T11:22Z,"@raymondhome i hope you dont mind but i'm taking a clip of this and uploading it on YT in a few days, the video will link to your torrent and i'm hoping it is fine with you, if you wanna get ahold of me about posting it email me at: brendansmith1252 @ gmail.com "

,jim001,2010-02-14T07:20Z,Very nice job raymondhome.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
,jim001,2010-02-14T07:32Z,Could you up From Paris With Love?  Would be much appreciated.
,gendy4,2010-02-15T13:00Z,"The SCR in the title is kind of misleading.
This is not a screener its a cam. 
Best cam Ive ever seen but Id give the video a 7 and audio a 8"
,mitter,2010-02-15T13:55Z,"terrible quality, please wait for a dvd screener.

V:5
A:6"
,hatebreeder80,2010-02-16T08:03Z,"@gendy4

this is in no way a cam. its definately not a bluray ripor anything, and the quality might be about a/v 8, but its no cam.

but this is a fuckin badass movie. if people think this movie has a few cheesy parts in it and complain then obviously you must have missed the first movie. its meant to be funny at times. also most people dont like sequels as much, especially after 10 years of waiting. but what do you expect, troy duffy to spend every moment of the last decade making the pefect sequel to the boondock saints? maybe it could have been better but thats your opinion."
,hatebreeder80,2010-02-16T08:07Z,"oh yeah, please fuck off spammers.

every god damned torrent has 25 comments about virus infected sites with shitty movies.

the sad thing is is that i know people who actually use those sites, then ask me how to fix their computer every couple weeks. and theres probably thousands of other people who read these spam comments and go there even with warnings about it in other comments.

i fucking hate people"
,fisheggs,2010-02-16T13:05Z,Why does juliadawn rate it A10/V10 when it clearly can't be?
[T],jonnoel1,2010-02-16T13:53Z,"first of all, my vid rating is  about a 7 or 8 for both a/v, definitley not a bad download to watch, but definitley not HQ. FAST download! (thanks seedy people) and for those wondering about the movie, not as good as #1 but a good watch, and FREE so watch the damn thing. My DL speed was 1mb/s for most of the time and i'm on crappy wireless, and it took less than 30 mins. The screenshots the uploader posted are accurate so if you wanna see the quality..LQQK! Thanks for the torrent raymondhome, good job!"
[T],jonnoel1,2010-02-16T13:54Z,"oh and btw, my download was that fast after deleteing all the trackers too....better safe than sorry right?....enjoy!"
,prisondad,2010-02-17T04:18Z,"thnx for upload


not as good as first but descent attempt.

free is good price."
,thulius,2010-02-18T03:24Z,"a/v 6~7 m -9,327

i loved the first one ....this is quite possibly the worst movie ever made !

thanks for the rip ray!

but would-be-viewers ....i hope youve suffered severe head trauma , or you simply cant appreciate this movie ...its like the writer was sayin - hey f##k you guys for watchin!"
,gifgaz,2010-02-18T20:29Z,"great movie, more than ok quality."
,jdogg412,2010-02-19T03:34Z,thanks raymond a/v 7/7 i would say the same as the silent ninja copy
,tidus2010,2010-02-21T20:58Z,thanks for that comment about the trackers
,psidre,2010-03-06T15:02Z,"Thank you to the poster and everyone seeding. Finished downloading in less time than it will take to watch the movie.  

+1  

Haven't watched the entire film yet and will be leaving my critique out of the comments."
,skatingzooyork,2010-03-28T07:07Z,please seed - thanks!
,Zerotrace50,2010-04-02T04:34Z,"Audio is good, Video is a little blotchy. When someone in the movie moves in a quick motion, there's a blur...kinda like a ""Matrix echo""     Can't think of a better way to describe it."
,Punkertjeuh,2010-05-03T18:55Z,"Mine opinion: quality is ok, movie sucks. Especially the characters, the music and dialoges suck ass! So disappointed because the first movie is much better.
Still thanx for the upload Raymond"
