,mother0fall,2010-02-14T11:33Z,"works on windows 7 x86. i already added the powerpack v.1.05 from bibleworks 7 to include several other versions including the qur'an and hebrew peshitta.

this has less lexicons, but more resources compared to bw7 (until somebody can upload the modules cd for bw8). 

you can run both versions side-by-side.

finally, dont run a bw8 with chinese/japanese/korean versions on the main window with any other version on the browse window on the right side (new feature). it just self- terminates for some unknown reason, reminiscent of bibleworks 7 on windows vista.

i hope this helps."
,PeterHolbrook,2010-02-17T00:30Z,Any chance that the add-on modules will be added to a new torrent?
,belzebul,2010-02-17T17:04Z,"ALL modules are included on the DVD, all you need to have is an unlock key - the serial number for the add-on products"
,PeterHolbrook,2010-02-18T00:50Z,"@belzebul

I don't quite follow. I KNOW for a fact that HALOT is one of the add-on modules, but it wasn't installed by the installer on this DVD. If it is somewhere on this DVD, can you explain how to install it? If not, it's quite likely it comes on a second CD or DVD."
,jfblodi,2010-02-18T13:45Z,So where is the unlock key/serial number?
,jfblodi,2010-02-18T15:14Z,Oh duh. Found it.
,jfblodi,2010-02-18T17:56Z,"Ok, got as far as the ""Activate manually"" step. Your instructions say when I get to this point, to ""create any confirmation code."" But when I do, and then click ""activate"" it says the code failed, and to try again. So, where do I get a code that'll work?"
,jfblodi,2010-02-19T10:06Z,@belzebul: Still stuck at this point. Any advise?
,belzebul,2010-02-20T22:24Z,"if I had the unlock codes, I would surely share ´em. since I don´t, I can´t tell. next thing, I don´t understand why you didn´t consult the bibleworks´site, they´re explaining BW 8 and add-ons policy there. you´re so hot after the modules, why don´t you buy them and share the codes with us? anyway, try downloading BW7, all modules are avalaible with that torrent. even better, try to consider actually buying the books, it´s much more worth the money and hardcovers last generations. Bauer, LSJ and HALOT are excellent, it´s a sheer joy working with, but I don´t miss them at all. 6 greek and 3 hebrew lexicons, a dozen grammars, plenty textbooks already, come on! Reymond´s introductory lessons in aramaic are just a cherry on top of the cream. What Would Jesus Do?"
,jfblodi,2010-02-23T21:13Z,"belzebul, of course you're right, I could buy them. But you DID provide this download, so I assume there's a way to make it work without the codes, otherwise it'd be useless, right? So all I'm asking is: how to procede from where I am without the codes? Fair enough? :)"
,Origen,2010-02-24T08:45Z,"Installation is easy.

1. Uninstall any previous, failed attempt to install BibleWorks 8, and delete the BibleWorks directory itself. (Uninstall does not seem to do this.)

2. Install in the usual way from the Autoboot, using the supplied Serial No.

3. At the end of the process, it tells you it needs a reboot. Choose to do this yourself.

4. But before you do reboot, Copy/Paste the BW800.exe file from the DVD into the BibleWorks 8 Directory. It will ask you whether to keep the old version or replace it with this new one. Choose to replace it. This is IMPORTANT! If you do not get this query, or answer it in the wrong way, the installation will fail - or revert to trial period only.

5. Reboot. That is all."
,belzebul,2010-02-24T09:25Z,"Swell... ""BibleWorks has chosen to implement an activation scheme that will make the product more difficult to steal."" It´s not possible even to install the damn modules without a legitimate license number. I have no idea how to pass this. ""It is our prayer that God will lead those engaged in this crime to repentance and that activation will be used by Him, among His other means, to confront many with their sin and with the provision He has made for them to be cleansed in Christ."""
,jfblodi,2010-02-25T19:21Z,"Origin, what do you mean by ""Copy/Paste the BW800.exe file from the DVD""? 

From what DVD? I downloaded this BW8 file from here, and opened it with PowerISO, thus I have a bunch of files, but no DVD.

What's ""easy"" to you isn't always easy to others. ;)"
,Origen,2010-02-26T07:40Z,"jfblodi
The file you have downloaded consists of two parts - an ISO file and a cracked.zip compressed file.

You need to burn the ISO file onto a DVD-R blank disk, and then run the Setup from that. I presume you know how to do that. If not, you really need to learn such basic computing functions before coming to places like PB. (If you load the ISO part of the file into PowerISO, you can burn it onto a DVD by clicking on the Burn icon at the top.)

After the completion of the installation you need to copy the BW800.exe file from the cracked compressed file into the c:/program files/bibleworks8/ directory. The easiest way to do this is to right click on the bw800.exe file and choose Copy, then click on the bibleworks8 directory and choose Paste. (This is simplest if you have two Windows explorer boxes open beside each other on the screen.)

After choosing to Replace the original copy of bw800.exe, the installation is complete. When you first run BW it will ask you for a Serial Code to Activate the package, and it will accept any random mixture of letters and numbers. I would recommend about 8-10 digits long. That is all there is to it.

,carlitosvillagra,2010-09-17T18:20Z,Ok. Everything is ok. Thanks for the excellent program. There is a recommended update file named BibleWorks Executable 8.0.018n that gave me some trouble and I had to reinstall the software. Should I avoid to update again? Thanks.

,Orion_X11,2012-07-12T18:05Z,"I downloaded it in 23/03/2010 and installed it many times, but I have tried to install it many times for the last 11 months, but it seems that the BW8 file crack does not work any more. Because after installing it though the whole process and activating it manually. After restarting BW8 again I always get an odd error and a crash, so that the program does not open any more. Any hints? Thx"
