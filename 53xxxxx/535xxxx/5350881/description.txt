I use initial seeding when I am the only seeder because I am on a limited monthly up/down and if I regular seeded a 4gb file it took over 10gb for there to be anyone at 100%.

I posted a question in the forum about initial seeding and this is what was said:
(basically I think you gotta share or it is going to take forever...)

"When initial seeding (also called super seeding) your client will upload a piece to one user, then will not upload anything else to that user until a second user reports that they have the piece (which proves that the person you uploaded to is also uploading).

But this means, in swarms smaller than approx. 10 users, uploading tends to be very stop and go. You upload a piece, then you have to wait until the person you have uploaded it to has passed it on." 

Please, seed when you are done.
