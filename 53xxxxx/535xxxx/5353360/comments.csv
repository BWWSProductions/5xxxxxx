,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-14T00:44Z,"I think i'll have a look at this Emery. Never heard of it but the imdb link sounds good. 

Also good to know that you put your sources for ripping in your nfo. Again most decent uploaders do that but again some don't :)"
,TrashCompaqtor,2010-02-15T10:05Z,"Thanks for trying, but this has a bad IVTC plus it's the wrong aspect ratio;  the AR of the DVD is 16:9.  AR of the bluray is 2.35:1  Would it have hurt ya to check it first?  Or even check it after encoding it?

The other WS DVDrip of this I found was 688x288, they made the same mistake as you did... plus it had a bad IVTC too.

I'll just find a bluray rip instead."

@TrashCompaqtor 

If you're such an expert, upload it yourself.

Whatever happened to friendly advice? 

Remember the old saying; if you cannot say something nice, keep your fucking mouth shut!


Thank you very much for the upload Emery, and your contribution to the site =)"
