,xMOXIEx,2010-03-27T20:59Z,"I've in installed this version several times, including the trial version from the oem. Running Win 7 x64 ultra and I keep having the same problem. Runs fine except I don't get any text in any of the menu's just blank on all the configuration tabs, pop up menus, browse menus etc. Any ideas anybody. Also this is a clean legit download. Thanks man!"
