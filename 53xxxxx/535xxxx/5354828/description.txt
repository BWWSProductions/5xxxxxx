This is a compiled version (exe) of a Autohotkey script i use in borderlands.

It spams the "E" button while you hold Left Shift, which makes you loot or use

whatever item is currently in your crosshair at a rate of 20 times/second 

without accidentally equipping any items. The program runs in Windows taskbar and 

can be paused or shut down by from there through the right-click menu. 

You can start it before or after you start Borderlands, it doesn't matter. 

The hotkey script is global and affects the key input only, not the BL process.

Remember to use Right Shift when typing capital letters. Enjoy!

(for those of you who wonder what the script looks like or want to use another key)



LShift::
while GetKeyState("LShift", "P")
{
Send, E
Sleep, 50
}
Return



If you want to change it, edit both instances of LShift to the hotkey 

(LCtrl or LAlt or F1 or Q... you get the idea)

Edit the E in Send, E to whatever your Use Key is (if its not E)

The Sleep, 50 is the delay between loot attempts in milliseconds

Save it as bl_autoloot.ahk and use or compile it with autohotkey
