	Release Notes .. :

	Photoshop CS3 Sharpening Images
	with: Deke McClelland

	Real focus happens inside the camera's lens element. The sharpening features in Photoshop 	CS3 exaggerate the contrast along edges in a photograph to transform a well-focused image 	into an outstanding image. In Photoshop CS3 Sharpening Images, Deke McClelland teaches a 	host of sharpening and noise reduction techniques, including using filters such as 	Unsharp Mask, Smart Sharpen, High Pass, and Reduce Noise. The training teaches the 	essentials of sharpening, including what it does, why it's important, and how the filters 	function. Plus, the training covers Deke's recommended best practices, including the four 	distinct varieties of sharpening, which can be used independently or in combination with 	each other. Photoshop CS3 Sharpening Images is about how to transform images from looking 	good to looking their absolute best. Exercise files accompany the course.
