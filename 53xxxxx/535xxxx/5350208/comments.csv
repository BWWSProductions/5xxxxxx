,Robo88,2010-02-13T07:56Z,ac3 sound for dvdrip...what a moron ..waste of space
,signalcorps,2010-02-13T08:38Z,"@Robo88

dude, shut the fuck up! AC3 is great quality, has surround sound support and very high level of compression.  Don't bother us if you can't afford speakers to take advantage of it.  What the fuck is your point anyway?  A waste of space?  dumb ass, your comment's are a waste of space.  Buy a fucking hard drive you bum! a Terabyte will cost you less than a hundred bucks.  That's less than a whole fucking dollar a GB, you cheap prick bastard."

,Octopus3d,2010-02-16T23:27Z,"So, is the film of interest?  Audio Video etc?  I can't really make an informed choice with race as your basis for selecting entertainment.  All christians are stupid, israeli-scum?  What is wrong with you (age and edudactional differences aside)?

When the good folks from Nova Zelì°½ndia walk into your neighborhood, do you hate them because some have been known to kill sheep, or those that felt that they were doing the right thing by entering into a war because of what they have been taught, even though they may ""read more"" as life went on and changed their perspective?  
""Hate em all, we are the best""... who are ""we"" and why are you the best?  

Can't you look at the individual circumstances and instigators and judge them accordingly?

Funny stuff wading through all of your insecurities just to find the cool guys who contribute to the goals of this community. (Even though I have now done the same thing by posting ""non-subject"" opinions, sorry).

I will seed and post results.  Thank you .BONE. for your efforts.

Thank you PB as well."

,dlarrym,2010-05-27T05:54Z,"@kurukx: WHO is the fool, you just classified yourself as a chimp, as you also do not believe in a higher power of any kind. Humans ability to extrapalate ideas like that we humans are NOT the most intelligent things in the universe. DO you really think humans are the highest form of intelligent life in the entire universe? Why is the idea of a higher being that can create organic life (like us humans and all other life on this planet including you sadly) or terra-form a planet just because we humans cannot? YOU are the fool!   Even Albert Einstein, perhaps the brightest and most insightful physicist arguably of all time, believed that his work and others work aimed at explaining how our universe works actually back up the and support the existence of GOD (or Higher Being for any NON-jewish/christians folks). There is a very high order to the universe and its workings. To believe that random dust particles bumping around is the means of producing our very intricate eco-system (allowing us to live) is not scientific at all. There is no belief in coincidences in any real applied science. in a universe that is infintely huge, the laws of probability, even if very unlikely, will occur! Even a being / GOD, that has the ability to manipulate time and space in ways we can't, can and do without any doubt exist. Go back to school you fucking retard.... Your comments only add testimony to you being an uneducated fucking idiot.!!! Humans ability to recognize that we are not the most intelligent species in the universe is what separates us from a chimpanzee like you are. After all you are the one who said that you were in agreement with chimps in that they don't worship any god.... these were your own comments... Lastly, Only an arrogant ASSHOLE goes around and thinks they got all the answers. SO, take your mouth off your mothers tit, and GROW UP!"

Maybe humans aren't the most intelligent beings in the universe.  But I can tell you we're the most intelligent form yet discovered.

Look at you, grasping at straws.  Your religion is in a perpetual decline, on its deathbed.

When it's gone, so too will go the greatest source holding humanity back from scientific and moral progress.  It's just sad that you'll probably expire before you see a godless world, how much better it will be.

Good, moving film that makes you think about extremists of all religions.

It seems that religion is the root of all evil and information and science is the root of good..

I really do belive that this is mostly true"

There's no proof whatsoever that belief in god is anything more that a remnant from the primitive psychologies of our ancestors. Quit spamming and piss off."

,crakhed32,2010-12-10T05:17Z,"dlarrwm,
spoken like a true bible-thumping ignoramus. Only a true dumbass would use Einstein to try prove the existence of god"
,camo12345,2011-03-06T15:10Z,"dlarrym actually makes sense in a weird way. God doesnt necessarily have to be the God that religious folk perceive him, God could just be higher intelligent beings, clever aliens if you will. There is as much theory behind God as there is behind The Big Bang... many of the worlds best scientists have also agreed that there is as much chance of there being a ""God"" as there is that the Big Bang happened. 

But anyway, who cares? No one can say anything with certainty, God can't be proven to be real or fake, so why even argue about it? Its all basedon belief... you either believe or you dont, everyone has an opinion about God, and because no one can prove his existence either way, no one has should say anything about his existence. "
,phrakk,2011-04-16T12:41Z,"@camo12345
Actually, no. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_background_radiation

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law

That's a start. There's an absurd amount of evidence for the big bang theory. (""Theory"" here very much in the scientific sense: a hypothesis that has survived so much attempted falsification where competing hypotheses have failed as to be the best answer that we can collectively come up with.)  Scientific theories are built to explain the evidence gathered, not the other way around. 

Religious faith means a very different thing than the connotation used to describe faith in a spouse. It is literally belief without evidence or in the face of conflicting evidence. Atheist agnostics do not share any comparable belief systems. Well, to be fair, I'm sure that some out there still buy into various other forms of non-god related quackery. But please don't be so insulting and ungrateful as to write off the immense amount of effort that science as an institution has undertaken interrogating the universe. There is not a day that goes by that you don't literally owe your life to the rewards of such hard work and ingenuity. (Seriously, look at the survival rates of even the most well off individuals only a century or so ago.)"
