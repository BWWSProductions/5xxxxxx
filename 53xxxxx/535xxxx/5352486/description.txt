News: patcher finally got some updating to succesfully cure "new" version of Reflexive's protection. If still getting any problems - jest report'em here.
----------------------
Boring legend: I think it is not a secret that many shareware-game developers are just too lazy to develop a protection system by themselves, leaving that task to their publishers. However, many publishers are also lazy, so they end up using same protection for every game. Of course, even most advanced defensive mechanisms could be cracked soon or lately, which would render defenseless every product protected by it. Such thing already happened to Reflexive Arcade's one: after crunching it (for fun) 2 days ago, I have come to the decision of automatizing this uneasy, yet fairly entertaining (for the first few times) process: we have already seen auto-unpackers and universal keygenerators, so now it's a time for some user-friendly patcher... Source code included.
