,ollyp86,2010-03-02T16:31Z,Im currently running fcp with an expired 14day trial fxfactory licence.  Is this the full version with crack? cheers
,infiniteight,2010-03-11T06:31Z,Does anyone know where I can get a proper serial number?
,chrismans,2010-04-08T12:40Z,"Guys there is no need for a serial code, just follow the instructions and you will be fine."
,Raidven,2010-05-15T02:57Z,"Hiya! This torrent does not work. I keeps on asking a serial number even though instructions were strictly followed when installing.  There is no way to run the FxFactory_86, and there is no way to get the cracked files placed in a folder called FxFactory.app. Does anybody knows where to find a proper serial number?  Thanks."
,duvalier99,2010-05-31T09:12Z,Works like a charm ... followed instruction and every's fine 
,joula,2010-07-02T19:38Z,can it run on either FCE and FCP installed in one system?
,joula,2010-07-02T19:41Z,"i have successfully installed it and run it on FCP, but later on i installed FCE in the same system, the FX factory won't open. Is there anything i should do? please...
Do I need to uninstall FCE? "
,hoerner63,2011-03-13T22:42Z,"Hi, Excuse my ignorance, but when you double click the ""FxFactory_x86"", it opens up in ""Terminal"", and just say's, [Process completed]. 
There is no option to put in a serial number. 
Does this work differently on a MAC?"
,hoerner63,2011-03-13T22:44Z,"I just messed around a bit and it is now working. I never did put in a serial number, but the water mark is no longer there in FCP. Thanks!"
,hoerner63,2011-03-13T22:49Z,"Actually, now the watermark keeps re-appearing, so back to my previous question...

Excuse my ignorance, but when you double click the ""FxFactory_x86"", it opens up in ""Terminal"", and just say's, [Process completed].

,amvbob,2011-04-06T19:48Z,"This works great! I skipped the first part where you're supposed to copy FX86 to the MacOS folder, so once I fixed that it worked dandy. Those who are having trouble finding these folders - right click FXFactory and tell it to ""show package contents"" in applications. Once you've copied over the _86 file and the configs, clicking on 86 will run the terminal and open up the program. From there literally just make up a serial! Fantastic, thanks!"
,dwaddsy,2011-04-22T08:27Z,"I'M NOT SURE IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING HERE BUT! Here is my question:

I am assuming unpack the crack means unzip folder FXFactory_213[k'ed].zip.... I didn't see 
/Applications/FxFactory.app/Contents/MacOS  since all the fxfactory files are in my vuze download. can you please advise first how to get that to the location and what do you mean by ""COPY"" to that folder (not drag and drop it?)

Same question with step 2 below. How do I ""copy"" configs.bin to /applications/fxfactory.app if /applications/fxfactory.app doesnt exist. 

Sorry but I'm confused by the instructions..."

WHEN YOU SAY RIGHT CLICK  FXFACTORY WHAT FOLDER DO YOU MEAN? THEY ALL SAY FXFACTORY IN SOME FORM. CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC? DO YOU MEAN THE MAIN FOLDER?

ALSO IF I RIGHT CLICK ON MY MAC THE ONLY OPTIONS IS DUPLICATE OR MAKE ALAIS. WHICH ONE? "
,Djims,2011-04-27T17:42Z,I think this Can someone help me find the right torrent. Honestly I really need it. Djimsbeevins@hotmail.com. Thank you all. version 2.5.4 or 2.3.1
,dijpot,2011-08-09T12:38Z,Hey guys Im a 14 yr old kid and i could do it so. You go to applications on the side bar in finder(for mac) and right click it and go on show package contents. Then copy the _86 to Mac os and configs to resources. Then go in the macos folder in the fx factory package contents and open the _86. Itll work as long as you hav little snitch running blocking connections. Hope it helps.
,jpjohansson1,2011-08-31T18:32Z,"I did everything, but why the hell are the plugins not showing up in my FCPX?"
,Djims,2011-09-06T15:15Z,"HI man, thanks for all, if possible to crack the version 2.6.1 fxfactory? 
Thanks
Djims"
