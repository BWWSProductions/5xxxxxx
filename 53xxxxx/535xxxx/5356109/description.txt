MP3, 320 kbps.


Free improvisation with concert pianist Manlio Giordano at "Skissernas Museum" ("The Museum of Sketches"), Lund, Sweden, February 10, 2010.

Giordano performed at the close of an exhibition ("Johan Falkman - Bilder frÃ¥n en hamn" / "Johan Falkman - Images From a Port") with sketches for monumental paintings by the famous Swedish painter, writer etc. Johan Falkman.

The final item of the brief recital program (with music by Scriabin and Medtner) was the improvisation heard in this recording - an improvisation on some of the central ideas that had inspired the paintings, which had been presented by the painter himself (Johan Falkman), on stage.
