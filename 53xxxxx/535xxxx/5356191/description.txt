February 22 2006 - Wallace Vanborn make their debut performance in their hometown Ghent. All those present are shaken, stirred - and ultimately persuaded.

Still newcomers on the scene, it wasn't long before Wallace Vanborn had appeared on some of Belgium's finest festival stages, played alongside well-known national and international acts, and developed a taste for the highlife - notably playing more than a few legendary champagne-fuelled loft-parties.

After the release of demo tape I Am Hell, Wallace Vanborn's name was soon on everybody's lips. Belgium's biggest music and popculture magazine HUMO cited the band as producing music akin to the pounding sound of stoner-rock giants Kyuss. Others have come to refer to the band as "Pletwallace" - the Dutch word for steamroller.

In their own words, Wallace Vanborn eagerly bring their audience hard, rocking music which is edgy yet danceable, with some tasty hooks and catchy refrains thrown in for good measure.
