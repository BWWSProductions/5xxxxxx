,booboo332,2010-02-13T03:59Z,"It's just a theory but I suspect her not showing up lately may be due to BarrySoetoro's possibly outing her identity may have something to do with it.  
A google search of ""maria"" and ""sistromo"" reveals the email address ""maria.g.sistromo@state.or.us"" that may be hers.

If true, it may have unnerved her and led her to abandon her nonsensical trolling.  Only time will tell but the loss is ours.  The ignorance of her comments are highly comical."

""My passion and calling is in public health. I?ve worked for 20 years in public health practice and research at the ?street? level, in mid- and upper-level management positions at the county, regional and state levels. My research and interests include communicable disease epidemiology; infection control; the social, political and environmental determinants of health; and public policymaking. It has been my pleasure to bring a rich practice to bear in my teaching in the graduate and undergraduate nursing programs and in the Oregon Masters of Public Health program. It is my goal to inspire a new generation of practitioners and future policymakers in the social justice mission of public health.""

Social, political and environmental determinants of health... lulz. Progressive much?

INB4 shitstorm.

,booboo332,2010-02-13T06:12Z,"Hmmm . . . Sistromo's posts in the past suggest someone with less education that an assistant prof.  

Her quoted ""goal to inspire a new generation of practitioners and future policymakers in the social justice mission of public health."" clearly indicates a progressive nut for sure but we may be barking up the wrong tree."
,BarrySoetoro,2010-02-13T06:14Z,"...but we have her IP.

Too many coincidences. :)"
,booboo332,2010-02-13T06:21Z,"An IP would be a pretty conclusive way to track her location but I wonder how would Anonymous identify it?  Has she posted to other, less discrete sites?"
,booboo332,2010-02-13T06:25Z,"oops, I meant ""discreet"".  Damn homonyms getting by spell check.  ;)"
,BarrySoetoro,2010-02-13T06:43Z,"Well I can't go divulging that now, can I?!

Let's just say Sistrom(o)(o) helped a lot... all you have to do is connect a few dots, lie in wait, and then it's a literally just a process of elimination.

Ever meet a woman who's face had a certain look that made you know without a doubt that she's a smoker?  You'd say to yourself, ""Damn!  How many Marlboro redboxes each day does it take to do THAT?!?""  We've all met women like that.

Well, Sisty here has a similar condition.  One that clearly stems from a lack of ""O"" faces."
