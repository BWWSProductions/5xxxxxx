,daley89,2010-02-11T10:20Z,so am i right in thinking u cant burn this onto a disc with imgburn and just save to xbox hdd?
,Torr3ntRid3r,2010-02-11T10:34Z,i think that only works with running demo's from disc
,Bujaaa,2010-02-11T11:15Z,Torr3ntRid3r : if it's not too much trouble can you please upload DLC with Zaed squad member. Ty :)
,Bujaaa,2010-02-11T11:16Z,Also thank you for your support. You deserve a skull.
,Torr3ntRid3r,2010-02-11T14:23Z,"I have have found it on ilovetorrents.com search

Mass.Effect.2.Zaeed.Addon.DLC.XBOX360-FYK.rar

i will upload it when complete or help seed if its posted."
,Bujaaa,2010-02-11T14:43Z,Ok. Ty. Also tell me do i need to have jtagged console for this to work? I installed XPort 360 on my pc and will install X360hdd in it as soon as i find Torks 6 & 10 wrench at a hardware store. So when i finish the copy proces from my PC to X360 hdd will it work if the console is not jtagged?
,Torr3ntRid3r,2010-02-11T15:26Z,"yes you need a jtagged xbox, to run unsigned content. ppl who updated to 2.0.8xxx dash cant exploit the system yet."
,_sinner_,2010-02-12T01:27Z,"Thank you, Torr3ntRider. 

Sucks when you have a banned box and can't get DLC. It's people like you that make TPB go 'round and 'round!"
,yomatoshison,2010-03-06T18:23Z,"i already have a legit activated cerebrus account so i was wondering can i just transfer these to my xbox 360 without getting banned and these still working i only need a few of them such as blood dragon armor,inferno armor and collectors armor with assault rifle and incisor rifle i got everything else through codes so would that work? Please respond."
,Gulso65,2010-07-03T18:36Z,"Would this DLC get me banned, even though I have a legit activated Cerebus Network on my Xbox? Please reply"
,Gulso65,2010-07-04T00:15Z,"If I download this torrent to my PC, then put it through Modio to match my Xbox's ID number would I still get banned from Live if I used this DLC while signed into Xbox Live? Sorry for leaving 2 comments asking, but I would LOVE the DLC's for my ME2 but don't want to get banned from Live. Please reply ASAP. Thanks :)"
,07paul,2011-07-02T13:47Z,"Hey Torr3ntRid3r, I don't have a Jtaged xbox so could tis be done by just putting the files onto my xbox Hard Drive? I have done that with some Themes 7 gamer pictures fine. Also will this get me banned at all?"
,Elbichu,2012-04-19T16:56Z,Hey gus does anyone has Mass Effect 3?
