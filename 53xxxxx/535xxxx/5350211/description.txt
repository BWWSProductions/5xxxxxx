If you do this you will be able to playback 1080p videos using xbmc on your Apple TV, however you will loose wifi (have to remove wifi card to insert this one)

and here 
http://community.wdc.com/t5/WD-TV-Live-Firmware/1-0-17-MP4-Audio-Sync/td-p/6146

couple notes:

This is also PSP compliant, use FULL screen mode on your PSP.  It is best to use component cable output on your PSP and play on an HDTV.

This is the highest quality you will find.  It is encoded using the maximum pixels allowed from source.  AR has been corrected and packed correctly like it should of been to begin with.  The glitches that are in the encode cannot be removed because they are in the source and they are due to how the original capper created the file (badly).

If you wish to burn to DVDR do not modify ANYTHING other than change the codecs (to mpeg2 and ac3 if you like).  Everything else is exactly how it is supposed to be.  Do not modify AR, do not modify dimensions, nothing, just change codecs and burn.

Do not be fooled into thinking this was easy to create or any noob can do it.  It takes real skill to produce these from such crap sources.  My hats off to ViSiON and secret_myth as they also pulled it off stellar.

I could go into great detail of how this source was created and how to properly convert it but I don't know that it would hold a lot of interest or many people would understand the mathematics or problems presented with the source.  Suffice to say it was bad and wrong in about every aspect.

Cheers!


ps. It looks flat out amazing on Apple TV, even I was impressed at the color and detail.

Just so you know the error at the 1hr mark with the ik'ran and when jake is doing his video log right after is impossible to fix.  It is part of the source and is due to how it was captured.  So, live with it.
