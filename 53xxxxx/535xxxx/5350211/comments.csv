,el-monito,2010-02-10T07:52Z,"HR, I wanted to say thanks for investing so much time into making *quality* Apple TV encodes.  Much, much appreciated man.

Not sure if you were serious about VFR or not, but it's short for Visual Flight Rules, which means you're navigating the plane by what you can see out of the cockpit.  It can only be used during good/clear weather, otherwise you'd switch to instruments (IFR).  But something is messing with her instruments and it's completely foggy out, so the pilot is making a joke about the danger they're in."
