,zoomie74,2010-02-12T21:45Z,This is S04E20 NOT S07E20
,mzl,2010-02-13T02:31Z,"If this really is s07e20, than it's next weeks episode.

Could someone upload last weeks and this weeks episode?"
,mzl,2010-02-13T03:42Z,"It is indeed an old one. Wrong title, buddy."
,Tumps,2010-02-14T13:13Z,Anyone got S07E19?
,ola_h,2010-02-16T17:42Z,"This is S07E19 (128) ""Bone Black"" February 9, 2010

And it's RAR, so no seed!"
,allmine10,2010-02-16T23:56Z,"I have downloaded and confirmed this file to be Dirty Jobs S04E24 - Bone Black.

Confirm this for yourself by looking at the episode list on the official Dirty Jobs DVD available on amazon.com at http://www.amazon.com/Concrete-Finisher/dp/B00371KLXA"
,High_Voltage_Rock_N_Roll,2010-02-17T10:20Z,Why would you use rar? I'd never download that crap.
