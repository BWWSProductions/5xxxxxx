Picture the situation: you have dozens of videos stored on your computer, but rather than watching them on a tiny monitor, you'd prefer enjoying them on your TV. With VSO ConvertXtoDVD now you can!

VSO ConvertXtoDVD is a super easy video converter and burner that lets you record your favorite videos to DVD so that you can watch them on any home DVD player. The program can handle just about any format you throw at it, including AVI, WMV, MKV,OGM, MPEG and Quicktime, so you can watch them from the comfort of your couch.

VSO ConvertXtoDVD goes beyond burning and conversion and offers also dozens of readymade templates for DVD menus, lets you tweak playback options and includes a highly customizable subtitle editor with support for all major formats (SRT, SUB/ID and SSA). On the upside, the embedded video preview window lets you have a look at your video before actually burning it.

The encoder in VSO ConvertXtoDVD makes a decent job of converting videos in terms of the output quality.
