This is the real, or at least better, Chicago Discography.

The only thing I did was add their (missing) Chicago XXXII - Stone of Sisyphus album, and clean up the archive (alot!). It should all be in perfect order now. No greatest hits albums, because... All the songs are there, there's no need for them. The only Live albums I kept were: Best of Japan, Live at Carnegie Hall, and XXVI Live In Concert, because I don't see the point in having 10, almost identical, live performances of every song.

The albums included are the full versions of:

Chicago Transit Authority (Chicago I)
Chicago (Chicago II)
Chicago III
Chicago IV - Carnegie Hall
Chicago V
Chicago VI
Chicago VII
Chicago VIII
Chicago IX - Best of Japan
Chicago X
Chicago XI
Hot Streets (Chicago XII)
Chicago XIII
Chicago XIV
Chicago XVI
Chicago XVII
Chicago XVIII
Chicago XIX
Chicago XXI
Night & Day, Big Day Band (Chicago XXII)
Chicago XXIV - Live In Concert
Chicago XXV - Chicago Christmas - What's It Gonna Be, Santa?
Chicago XXIX - Love Songs {Okay, so I left in this one compilation album}
Chicago XXX
Chicago XXXII - Stone of Sisyphus

Like I said, this is for people who would rather listen to the same, may I add, amazing, music, without having to scan through tons of duplicates, greatest hits albums, and bootleg live compilations. 


(it won't let me link the original page, so just go to torrentz[.]com and search "Chicago Discography", and it should be the first one.)

That is where I got the original songs, but as you can see, that one is 3.6 GB, whereas mine is 1.7, as mine has not a single duplicate, or bonus track (which is usually just a demo version of a song you already have). If you wish to download the other one, for whatever reason, feel free; I am only offering a more organized, less spaced out, smaller(!) version of what whomever made the one in the link has already uploaded.
