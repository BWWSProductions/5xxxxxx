It should download a good  bit faster from now on, and whenever my laptop's on, I will make sure it can upload at atleast 300kbps; but it will usually be uncapped completely."
,abadprawn,2010-03-20T05:03Z,THANK YOU for compiling and sharing this.  It saved me from having to spend the time ripping my own record/CD collection.

,Omnipharious,2010-05-04T10:04Z,"Okay, well guys, I just got a new 320GB external hard drive, so I'm downloading this, my own torrent again, and once I get it, I will keep it uploading. 

Thank you to all of you that kept it alive till now.

To djakarta: I'm pretty sure I got everything right, I did take like 3 hours to do this up much better, but I think you're right; I think I couldn't get everything in Carnegie Hall right. That is probably my favourite live album by anyone, so I'll try to fix it once it finishes downloading."
