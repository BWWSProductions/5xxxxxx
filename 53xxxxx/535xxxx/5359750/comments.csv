It has a separate list of cheats that can be found by google. As for saving, I don't know why your game will not save, mine saves just fine."

,droogster44,2011-10-10T01:36Z,Do i need the original game? Or is this standalone?
,metalyger,2011-12-23T13:30Z,"This is a standalone version of the game. Just extract and play, no installation. It has Apocalypse Weekend as well as the AW7 mod which does everything it was made to do, all 7 days of Postal 2 and the choice to play the 2 expansion levels."
,m80thebrawler,2012-01-26T01:37Z,did you dream about putting 500 weapons in the game? or are you jus retarded ? probably retarded because theres not 500 weapons only has like 20 extra weapons... in the mighty words of red foreman..DUMB ASZ
,Draven96,2012-04-07T12:07Z,"@m80thebrawler  Speak for your own,look at the weapon list, and weapon cheats codes."
