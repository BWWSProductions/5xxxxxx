Mad Spike - v0.1 by Sybex.

This program was created by me for some days ago.
It got it's name by the crew at stay alive since it never sleeps.

Features:
You can choose what interval delay you want M.S to spam your message at,
from 50% normal and 150%. 

50% = 1000 (MS) for those ones with an slow PC.
normal = 700 (MS) recommended.
150% = 350 (MS) fast, not recommended if you got an bad PC.

This program was coded by me, Sybex. Everyone can use it how ever
the start and stop button is written in swedish, "starta" which means start and
"stoppa" means stop. There is a readme file who will explain everything in english
and swedish.

Enjoy! =)
