Never Let Me Down is an album by David Bowie, released April 1987. It drew some of the harshest criticism of Bowie's career, condemned by critics as a faceless piece of product and ignored by the public â€” Bowie himself said that the album featured good songwriting that was ruined by overly commercial and dull production. However, it featured more of Bowie's own compositions than its predecessor, Tonight.
In 1995,Virgin Records rereleased the album on CD with three bonus tracks,thats what we have here.
