,maqsmihil,2010-03-18T18:27Z,"Holy..mother it's awsome.. I think I had enough of the DVDrips since now I'm turning to your BDRIps. Many many thanks..Wish you success even in afterlife..
-Important-
to those who don't understand,other rips telesync,R5,DVDSCR doesn't necessarily have to be high quality..expect it. It's for those who wish to buy the realthing after quick look at contents. try the samples if you are not sure. Sample of this torrent is enough to distinguish original bdrips from others.

PS: To secretmyth;can you please add samples for every brrip ...

Good Luck"

,sybilfault,2010-05-03T23:22Z,"this looks like fantastic quality on my computer . . . . But could someone please tell me if they know why Br rips in H264 (as well as MKV files) do not play on my dual monitor (laptop to big screen) setup? I've tried updated versions of both VLC and Windows Media Player (and w/ that special Combined-Community-Codec-Pack). Most every other file type plays fine on the dual monitor setup, though."
,Snapdragon11,2011-04-22T04:49Z,"Thanks. 
fast DL and excellent quality.  "
