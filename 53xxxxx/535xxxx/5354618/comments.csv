,vslink,2010-02-12T20:40Z,"Bims, I think there is some reluctance for some to post SNs right in a thread for fear Apple can locate and invalidate them faster. That said, it is not that much harder for the nerds at Apple to download the torrents just like any of us do to see what is out there!"
,iCondemned_88,2010-02-13T01:16Z,THANK YOU MrBims
,nobody189,2010-02-13T11:55Z,Does the Serials work?
,vslink,2010-02-13T14:53Z,"nobody, the first one is the one I used--just fine. Others have reported the third is okay too. Don't know about the second--I stopped testing after the first one worked."
,osiris24x,2010-02-15T03:24Z,"Second serial works great, too."
,AidenAxl,2010-02-16T20:53Z,"Yeah, now they don't work. "
,Lolote123,2010-02-17T07:16Z,yea they don't work anymore
,vslink,2010-02-19T20:49Z,"Lolote, please read my response to you under a different torrent listing. There is nothing wrong with the SNs. Apple has not rebuilt the trial download to ""burn"" anything yet. If people can't activate, blame  yourselves, please, not the sharers of these SNs."
