Illutia is a Fantasy MMORPG developed by Crazed Monkeys. It is a world of weird and wondrous things, a world where all things are possible and not everything is what it appears to be.

Illutia began under the original name "Aspereta" In April of 2003. It was released mostly just as a test run to see if there was still a market for 2d mmorpgs. Aspereta became more popular than the small team ever imagined with over 50,000 accounts in less than a year. This encouraged Crazed Monkeys to push hard to meet the expectations of their fans.
