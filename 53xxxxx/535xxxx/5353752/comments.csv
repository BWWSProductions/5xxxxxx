,nodatalog,2010-08-24T06:46Z,"a fine piece of crap for rich homo wankers. Life of Brian was more instructive (and recreative).

Sue enough all the people commenting about religion all homo-wankers (and they still live in their mom's house wearing pink tutu).

Straight people do not give a sh**t about homo-religion-crap-movies
Rachel Weisz is a lesbian
Oscar Isaac is a jew homo
Max Minghella a homo

The rich preach, and the poor believe. That's all about it...

Homo movie
Homo religion
Not worth a download"
