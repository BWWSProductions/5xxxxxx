Can someone that has finished d/l please comment, because this hoonta chappie below will be putting people off from trying this ace album with his awesome capslock skills.

If anyone else has other CD's from 2 Kool, like "This is 2 Kool" and "koolness purr-sonified", please upload as FLAC. I can only find them to purchase on vinyl and would like to see if they are any good.
