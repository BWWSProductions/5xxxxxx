The multi award-winning National Theatre Of Brent returns to BBC Radio 4 for an occasional series celebrating the living artists deemed to be iconic icons.

This new addition to the Brent canon is written by Patrick Barlow, with additional material by John Ramm, and is performed by Patrick and John in front of an audience at the Bush Hall in London.

www.comedy.co.uk Review: 

Quote:Once again ham actor characters Desmond Olivier Dingle and Raymond Box manage to murder a play with whispered stage directions, mis-read lines, over-the-top acting, dodgy sound effects and awfully un-realistic dialogue.

For some, this series will be rather amusing indeed, but it should be noted this style of comedy won't be for everyone and some may tire of the concept generating the jokes after a while.

We were expecting three episodes of this series in 2009, but one episode (about Bob Dylan) was actually broadcast. We're still not quite sure if there is any more to follow.
