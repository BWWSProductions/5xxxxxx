[V],thethingy,2010-02-18T14:46Z,"one may want some of the additional fonts and tools contained in it,,,this was requested by users of master collection and premier pro,,the premier pro one has around 1000 extra things in it,,if you are a serious user then this would be usefull one thinks."

,nenohal,2010-03-20T02:56Z,"I need some help. 
I previously downloaded the Adobe CS4 master collection and it all works great. Now I am trying to download the extra content. I am not really sure on how to install these applications. I read the instructions but still seem to be lost. "
[V],thethingy,2010-03-20T08:01Z,"nenohal, there are a lot of packages inside the torrent, some you just run the setup others you just copy to the fonts folder of the app its for"

[V],thethingy,2010-03-20T12:35Z,"the first file is a self extracting rar, double click on it and it will extract it's self and all the other parts to one folder, or you can right click part 1 and select open/extract with winrar to do it manually"

,klabru,2010-03-31T01:14Z,"thank you so much. everything works! last question: Is there a possibilty to download only your updates of the cs4 mastersuit progs?
(and if not, would you recommend to copy amtlis and stuff if i download directly at the adobe site?)
again: thanks a lot! "
[V],thethingy,2010-03-31T17:32Z,you cant download the master collection updates sepratly as they are all in the one rar file.
,civildead,2010-06-23T14:09Z,"thethingy, you've helped me so far and I have one (I hope) final question. In your instructions for this you wrote:

5 If you used Licence Method 1 from the toolkit to activate your Adobe app then go in to each new Adobe installation folder and replace the amtlib.dll if it is there also, (32 or 64bit only use 1), skip this step if you did not use the toolkit.

I'm unsure as to what you mean by ""Licence Method 1 from the toolkit"". I used your torrents for CS4 Master Suite and followed all 10 of your instructions to the letter as well as used your Adobe Clean Install & Error Toolkit.  Is this the toolkit you refer to? If so, if I followed each step in that toolkit, does that mean I used Method 1? I'm sorry, I just don't remember anything being referred to as Method 1.

TIA

,cap_t_cha,2010-12-22T16:24Z,"As it doesn't say anything specific about encore cs4, i'd like to know if the Encore cs4 library is part of this torrent ?"
,Lekkerkat,2011-03-25T04:34Z,"Hi dude, is this cs4 extra content compatible with Adobe Creative Suite 5 Design Premium? Thanks in advance!"
,NixonUn,2011-03-30T07:05Z,"will this let me be able to use dynamic link between after effects and premiere pro. But if not why wont the dynamic link work between them?
And just so you know i got both from you but separate torrents."
