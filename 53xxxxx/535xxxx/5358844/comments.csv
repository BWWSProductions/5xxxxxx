,evuleyez,2010-03-14T04:55Z,"djwesty, I don't think there is a 1.3 patch. My game stayed on 1.2 and steam haven't updated it."
,FurmanSK,2010-04-10T13:29Z,Ah this isn't 1.2 patch. Cause I can't play with my friends on steam that have the latest version. Unless they released a new patch that we are not aware of. Some help would be awesome!
