,TommyBlade2018,2010-02-13T19:49Z,"Got A Quik question Gopo.

Why Don't Your mp4 File play on avs dvd Player.....For example If I download any of kingdom releases from lifechanger, secretmyth, deaftone etc or eliade, release-lounge there mp4 file plays on avs dvd player.......I'm guessin I have to download a codec"
[V],neon,2010-02-13T21:59Z,"thanks kringle this is a superb movie,any chance of taxi driver 1976 :o)"
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-02-13T23:39Z,"@TommyBlade2018: I don't know with they don't play on your dvd player.You could try and get the latest k-lite codec pack but if it still doesn't work I have no clue.

@catsout: Believe me,I want Taxi Driver as bad as you do but there is no blu-ray out yet."

,fatalideals,2010-03-07T22:44Z,"Thanks for this and every release and for every future release. Great Quality and specially great films. But this film has no sound for me. This is the only one that doesn't. I even changed it to 2 channel audio and still doesn't work. So i got the latest from k-lite and still has no sound. Anyone else have this problem? thanks in advance for help. I use VLC,WMP, and like 1 or 2 other players. "
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-03-08T22:43Z,Try KMPlayer and if that doesn't work either then maybe it's your audio card.I don't know for sure but since no one else complained about this it's definitely from your pc.The movie works fine on my pc otherwise I wouldn't have uploaded it.
,fatalideals,2010-03-11T22:45Z,"Thanks, I knew it wasn't the movie. Just surprised it was the only one that didn't have sound. I knew i was missing a codec. KMplayer fixed the problem. "
