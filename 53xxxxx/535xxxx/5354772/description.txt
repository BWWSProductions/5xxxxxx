Remastered 320 VBR Bob Dylan Bootleg  Songs and interviews

I need some help on this one.  If anyone can correct a song title please leave a comment.

I duped these records about 1973 so they were pressed before that.  Borrowed from a friend in North Hollywood.

The folding sleave was plain white and the record labels were also plain white, no marking or writing.

Some titles are just guesses others were found on websites.  The titles with * are only a SWAG, Yoâ€™al know the way Dylan made up his song titles.

1 Baby Please Donâ€™t Go*
