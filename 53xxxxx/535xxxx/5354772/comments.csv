,boorad3000,2010-02-12T16:39Z,"Thanks for the torrent.  This is a rip of Dylan's Great White Wonder from 1969 - historically one of the first 2 rock boots (Beatles Kum Back being the other).  The LPs arew reversed and the first track is missing.  Tracks 1-4 are side 3, 5-10 side 4, 11-15 side 1 and 16 - 21 side 2.  Candyman is missing.  Here is the correct track listing (from Wikipedia):
Side One 
""Candy Man"" 
""Ramblin' 'Round"" 
""Black cross"" 
""Ain't Got No Home"" 
""Death of Emmett Till"" 
""Poor Lazarus"" 
Side two 
""New Orleans Rag"" 
""If You Gotta Go, Go Now"" 
""Only a Hobo"" 
""Sitting On a Barbed Wire Fence"" 
""Mighty Quinn"" (take 1) 
""This Wheel's On Fire"" 
Side three 
""Baby Please Don't Go"" 
Interview by Pete Seeger 
""Dink's Song"" 
""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"" 
""East Orange New Jersey"" 
""Man of Constant Sorrow"" 
Side four 
""I Shall Be Released"" 
""Open The Door, Homer"" (take 1) 
""Too Much of Nothing"" (take 2) 
""Nothing Was Delivered"" (take 1) 
""Tears of Rage"" (take 2) 
""Living the Blues""
I was actually looking for this on line a few weeks ago - I left my copy home.  It was one of the first thing I ripped when I began burning CDs years ago.  All these tracks have since been released either officially or unofficially but hearing them again in the order and quality they first appeared is very cool.

,k7sparky,2010-02-12T23:49Z,"Wow and Thanks!!
I spent weeks trying to figure the titles out.  I even downloaded all Dylan's' song titles from allmusic.com and spent hours looking through them.
I just spent the better part of a year remastering my analog collection.
I just stated posting stuff I don't see listed as I have a chance.  My upload is maxed out.  Making plenty of mistakes learning about torrents also.
Thanks again!"
