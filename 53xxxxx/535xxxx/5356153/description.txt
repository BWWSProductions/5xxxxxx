Gears of War : Aspho Fields

Synopsis

For the first time, fans of the blockbuster Gears of War video games get an in-depth look at Delta Squadâ€™s toughest fightersâ€“soldierâ€™s soldier Marcus Fenix and rock-solid Dominic Santiagoâ€“as well as a detailed account of the pivotal battle of the Pendulum Wars.

As kids, the three of them were inseparable; as soldiers, they were torn apart. Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago fought alongside Domâ€™s elder brother Carlos at Aspho Fields in the epic battle that changed the course of the Pendulum Wars. Thereâ€™s a new war to fight now, a war for mankindâ€™s very survival. But while the last human stronghold on Sera braces itself for another onslaught from the Locust Horde, ghosts come back to haunt Marcus and Dom. For Marcusâ€“decorated war hero, convicted traitorâ€“the return of an old comrade threatens to dredge up an agonizing secret heâ€™s sworn to keep.

As the beleaguered Gears of the Coalition of Ordered Governments take a last stand to save mankind from extermination, the harrowing decisions made at Aspho Fields have to be re-lived and made again. Marcus and Dom can take anything the Locust Horde throws at themâ€“but will their friendship survive the truth about Carlos Santiago?
