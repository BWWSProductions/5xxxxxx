,tandythetart82,2010-02-17T00:11Z,"HR, I cannot burn this for some reason... I downloaded ImgBurn but it just won't burn... am I doing something wrong? It just keeps retrying over and over and then spits out the disc. I've tried more than one disc so I know it's not that... Never used that program before so I don't know if I need to change anything."
,tandythetart82,2010-02-17T00:41Z,"I do, but I have not used it and just did a quick google search and found out it's a POS. I'm about to contact Dell and give them a verbal bitch slap.

BTW thanks for all the great torrents, you're the first place I go when I'm looking for stuff."
