This is for people who can only watch DVD and cannot use the MP4 created by HR.

This is NTSC 16x9 wide screen encoded at 3650kb with 2 channel Dolby Digital at 192kb.  There are no menu's.  It is direct play.  There are selectable chapters at every 10 minutes.

It is NOT superior to the MP4.  It is worse.  So again, only get this if you want or need a DVD for some reason (to bring to grandmas).  Original source is P2PLOVERS with corrections.

It is the exact same source as MP4 and same dimensions and all that.  It just that mpeg2video is horrible compression when compared to x264.  This requires a DVD9 in order to match the MP4.  I am not going to upload a DVD9 for this.

I am not a DVD encoder and this done just to be nice.  I don't have the necessary tools or experience to make it the best it could possibly be.  It is good enough for average joe or bob, tom, tim?

Burn ISO with ImgBurn on a PC or Disk Utility on a MAC.  I burn and tested on MAC and PC.  You could also mount the ISO on a PC using Daemon Tools or Virtual CloneDrive and play with your favorite dvd player software such as Win DVD.
