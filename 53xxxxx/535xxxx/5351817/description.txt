Fun afternoon show for kids.  General admission was let in after all the kids were seated.  Video has some auto-focusing issues due to the stage lighting, but I did my best to adjust for this while taping.  Good closeups and steadily shot.  Excellent audio.  Vocals are strong and clear.

ENJOY!

Notes:  This was the only time on the cruise that Million Dollars was played.  It is also the last time Steve sang these as a Barenaked Lady.

% Spooky lighting effect on this song.  Jim forgets to turn on his light during his part.
@ Tyler gets a piece of wood from his drum stick in his eye during the end of the song.
& Steve accidentally knocks over his mic stand and then gathers up picks and throws them into the audience.
