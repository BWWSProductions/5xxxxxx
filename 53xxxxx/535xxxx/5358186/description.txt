Wayne Isham directed this music video. Will Estes as Tommy and Shiri Appleby as Gina are the two main characters (as it says in the lyrics "for Tommy and Gina, who never back down") but not portrayed as a working-class couple. At the beginning, Tommy is watching a video of the concert on his computer. Gina calls and during the whole video, Tommy runs through the streets of Los Angeles up to the Bon Jovi concert, getting chased by dogs, running a marathon, and posing for pictures and jackknifing a truck. The video was inspired by the movie Run Lola Run.[4] Jon Bon Jovi met Will Estes on the set of U-571 and chose him to be in his next video, "It's My Life"
