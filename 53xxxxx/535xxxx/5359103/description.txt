The New 2nd Edition offers cutting-edge information on the latest advances in the field of clinical canine behavior. It is intended to meet the needs of veterinarians, veterinary students and technicians as well as pet owners dealing with problem pets, pet care personnel who handle dogs in the course of their work, and dog lovers who are seeking understanding of the natural and aberrant behaviors of their canine companions. This new edition establishes a solid foundation for understanding innate, dog-to-dog social interactions, communication, and sensory awareness, so that we humans can learn how to meaningfully and effectively communicate with our â€œbest friends.â€ The authorâ€™s goals are to provide a clear understanding of normal behaviors and to provide the necessary tools to identify problem behaviors and their origins. Only then is it possible to successfully â€“ and humanely â€“ prevent, eradicate, or minimize unacceptable behaviors and build successful, lifelong relationships with our dogs.
