how do you get it to work with the game?"
,Illiok,2010-05-08T02:47Z,"I downloaded this torrent along with the torrents at:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5534648/Mass_Effect_2_DLC_-_Equalizer_Pack

and

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5489061/Mass_Effect_2__NEW__DLC_Authorization_Patch

I installed them and played Mass Effect 2 for a couple of hours with no problems whatsoever. The next day, I boot up my computer and none of my games work at all (ME 1, ME2, Heroes of Newerth, Medieval II: Total War). 

All my games are retail versions (except Heroes of Newerth which is beta). They are spread over two different hard drives. I get a black screen when launching and they either hang or Windows 7 tells me there is a problem.

I tried reinstalling Mass Effect 2 with no luck. I tried system restore with the auto component of AVG disabled, but it didn't restore fully.

Does anyone know why NONE of my games will work now when the only changes I have made to my system before today were to install this torrent and the other two mentioned above?"
