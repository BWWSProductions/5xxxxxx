,ademirado,2010-02-22T21:58Z,You must uninstall game and install again and then enter code it will work. It works for me on WIN7 64bit.
,dag331,2010-02-25T10:23Z,"The registration key will work if you delete a file first.

-> You need to go to c:\users\""your username""\documents\deluxe ski jump 3\registration
--> Delete the file called registration.CFG
---> Now try to use the serial one more time"
