,PyroPsychZach,2010-03-05T03:24Z,"@dank_nug; Right click on the file and choose ""Open With..."" and find notepad.

@jorgendahle; What the fuck's ""vuze""? Use BitTorrent; that's what you're supposed to be using. (Fun fact, look at the upper-most bar on your browser on TPB homepage, note that it says ""Worlds most resilient BitTorrent website."")"
