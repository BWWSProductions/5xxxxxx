Skin Yard was a grunge band from Seattle, Washington, who were active from 1985 to 1992. The group never gained any mainstream audience, but were an influence on their contemporaries â€“ most notably Soundgarden, Screaming Trees, The Melvins, and Green River â€“ alongside whom they are considered the early pioneers of the sound that would later be called grunge.
