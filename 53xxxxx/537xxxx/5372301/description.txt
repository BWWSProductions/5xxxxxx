 A personal aide to U.S. Ambassador in France, James Reece has an enviable life
 in Paris and a beautiful French girlfriend, but his real passion is his side 
 job as a low-level operative for the CIA. All James wants is to become a bona
 fide agent and see some real action. So when he's offered his first senior-level
 assignment, he can't believe his good luck until he meets his new partner special
 agent Charlie Wax (John Travolta) - a trigger-happy, wisecracking, loose cannon
 who's been sent to Paris to stop a terrorist attack. Wax leads James on a white 
 knuckle shooting spree through the Parisian underworld that has James praying
 for his desk job. But when James discovers he's a target of the same crime ring
 they're trying to bust, he realizes there's no turning back...and that Wax 
 himself might be his only hope for making it through the next forty-eight hours alive.
