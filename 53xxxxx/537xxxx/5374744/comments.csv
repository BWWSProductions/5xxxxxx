,mrhinter,2010-02-19T04:42Z,"1/6 & 2/6 dropped me as a seed today :S??? were trackers down?

and thanks thricely two oh, ill help keep em alive!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-19T09:21Z,"@mrhinter: I make torrent, then upload it to TPB. TPB make certain modifications, inserts new trackers etc... Blown-up star have never altered anything.
Point is: I use one torrent, ALL others one from TPB. Unfortunately, none of the trackers (tracker-servers) doesn't work, some of them malfunctions badly, showing bogus numbers of seeders and peers.
Every day I must deal with such stupidities, when I start to seed, torrent shows 35 seeders!!!

It leads to total blackout, because I cannot perform even initial seeding. Some torrent get deleted by me because of that.

I cannot advise nothing else than to use uTorrent, delete ALL trackers and rely solely on DHT. That's how I do it.

Accept only Encrypted traffic.

Reset router (change IP) every time you notice ANY irregularities.

,mrhinter,2010-02-19T14:07Z,"yeah has been a lil odd..... came ok and got a few more copies out today though!

my combined seeding over the three episodes so far is is over 11.0...... how far do i go in assisting keeping em alive? lol usage is still tight, and thats a fair few returned now...."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-19T17:05Z,"LOL, and I intended to drop Ep.4-6 because I see NO SEEDERS except me on ps 2 (where 2nd seeder pops-up from time to time, probably you) and 3 - where I have only Hit&Runs. 12. And probably 6 ""give-ups"".

Can third party (someone else) verify this?

If it is blocked by ""gremlins""  I see no point ... and have no more ideas..."
,1Payback,2010-02-19T17:54Z,"I have both ep 1 and 2 set to seed however I rarely get any seed requests for them, so I'm unsure if this means there is a problem or no one is downloading episode 1 or 2.  I will keep seeding all episodes I download constantly untill all episodes have been uploaded plus a few days more. 

Thank you TwentyForty for uploading the series:-)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-19T18:08Z,"@mrhinter & payback: I forgot: seeding ratio up to the 4.00 is generous, very generous, ratio of 8 deserves a medal - BUT - in the same time leads to support of/for Hit&Runs ('cause they fill belly and vanish) AND leads to serious depletion of seeders on some other torrents ('cause bandwidth /and allowance/ has been ""eaten"").

Only strong supporters, ones on really fast connections and ""I always pay the same no matter traffic"" /in Europe called Flat-Rate/ should go over 4. Ever. I have explained that last week, but I don't know where. At the end, it's individual judgment."
,1Payback,2010-02-19T19:11Z,"twentyforty, It's no problem as I have unlimited usage broadband, so I don't have a cap to worry about."
,mrhinter,2010-02-19T22:38Z,"well halfway between acceptable and medal winning..... maybe somewhere round 6.0 on each n getting a bronze! cheers man, i knew your general rule of seed :P but i also knew you wanted a stay alive guarantee on these ones!"
,lilars26,2010-02-19T23:38Z,"I think you both deserve the gold.
And mrhinter should be allowed
to fly the roo flag."
,the_shroud,2010-02-20T02:26Z,"I'm seeding all three but it takes ages to download as well as to build up seeding ratio. Especially Ep 2 & 3. Not giving up though. Keep it going, we'll get through this. Thx 20-40"
