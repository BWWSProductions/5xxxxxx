,Fuckinoob,2010-02-19T03:49Z,128k mp3? Really?
,darly,2010-02-19T04:33Z,"@ shifoo. I just looked it up on Wikipedia, although your comment was stupid. Why should the A stand for anything? What do you think the C stands for? Or the 5 that we're used to with Russian DVDs?

The Blu-ray Disc region coding scheme divides the world into 3 regions, labeled A, B, and C.

    * Region A includes most North, Central and South American and Southeast Asian countries plus Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea.
    * Region B includes most European, African and southwest Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand.
    * Region C contains the remaining central and south Asian countries, as well as China and Russia."

To have such great video quality yet shitty audio, is like making a beautiful wedding cake then having someone take a shit on it, it just ruins it no matter how pretty it is.

Good upload for people that don't care about audio though."
,poppah,2010-02-20T13:29Z,I dont get it why russian BR has 2.0 audio! Is 5.1 on russian? Poor bastards has some Igor talking for the actors. ;)
,enritnt,2010-02-22T06:28Z,"popahh dude, its no that the russian bd has that shitty audio, is that because is coming so early they ONLY put the audio in russian (not always 5.1, but at least 2.0 and perfect quality... if you are russian that is) so we have to wait for the proper releases whit english (i guess they do that due to piracy issues sure it looks perfect but without the english audio is pretty much useless to serious pirates)"
,caliwillbemine,2010-02-24T03:57Z,How can you have perfect 720p video from a blu ray without the audio ?
,allrockedout,2010-03-02T01:41Z,i watched this and the audio isnt that mad the video makes up for it..
,hayala,2010-03-10T10:53Z,"great video, horrible audio...."
,CoastMtns,2010-05-08T08:13Z,"Hmmm video is the ""best"".  Does not appear to be a rip as a piece of dirt appears in the bottom edge of the video at about 1:18:03 and remains.  About 1/3 across from the left. Enjoyed the movie"
