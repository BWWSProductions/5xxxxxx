NOTES

Ok, so we know this will no doubt be nuked for LiNE audio or something
silly like that, but the fact is, that until retail English audio arrives
this is the best version of the movie that exists. ( Except our 1080p to
come )

Just like R5s have become more popular, we expect that this year we will
see more and more Russian BluRays appearing, and to ignore them would be
stupid.

We hope more groups follow our lead and start releasing these aswell.

Anyone who appreciates this release, and the many more to come!
