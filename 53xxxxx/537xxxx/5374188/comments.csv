[T],Redhat98,2010-02-19T13:18Z,"That's OK I ripped an srt file and ocr from your file.
I have one more question the release in Bangkok is a DVD with no english subs and is PAL (25000fr) this one of yours has a different frame rate and is NTSC (29750fr). Where is this DVD from as I can find no NTSC release online anywhere? Any feedback is welcome."
