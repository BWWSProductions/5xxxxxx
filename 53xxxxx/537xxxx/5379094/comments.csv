,bobothebionicmonkey,2010-02-20T15:49Z,How do these things work. I tried it once with a DVD-R and burned an .iso using Nero express essentials but the thing never worked. It kept saying that i should put a ps2 formatted disk in. so how do these work?

What a noob?
Dude do you know that what you are doing is piracy, and if you are using an unmodded ps2!! then by now its totally ruined"
,ThePalindorme,2010-04-07T19:45Z,"perhaps i was a little too rude....
Dude tell me what you know!
Because without it its really difficult to answer"
