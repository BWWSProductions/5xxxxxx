My name is Joe, and I live in Spokane, Washington. I'm going to be uploading my favorite obscure, independent bands to Bittorent for people to download and enjoy.





For my first, I've uploaded the Second Album by hard rock/electro band The S1nd1cate.


If you enjoy your rock with an electro groove; and if you prefer your industrial goth-free...these guys are definately worth checking out.

And because they aren't signed, the album is completely ROYALTY-FREE. So download without the guilt.

If you do enjoy these guys - check out
