,M0e09,2010-02-19T12:32Z,"Hey, thanks for your uploads! just one little thing... if you would change to x264 DVDRips, the filesize would halve and the quality would be better or the same... about 1300 kbps are definitely enough for cartoons IMHO... if you'd like to try it, use ""handbrake"". Easy programm for x264 Rips where you can also queue your jobs, so not more work to do ;-)"
