Perfume, cognac, champagne, wax figures, busts â€“ wherever we look, we find the French emperorâ€™s legacy.

But weâ€™re not really conscious of just how much the many innovations that Napoleon introduced shape todayâ€™s world. Laws, customs, machines, figures of speech; many have their roots in the Napoleonic era. From the metric system and massive road construction projects; the Louisiana Purchase to the roots of todayâ€™s European legal systems. What energy, what charisma must this man have had in order to turn the centuries old structures that shaped Europe until the 18th century upside down within a matter of just a few years?

Napoleon was a figure as full of contradiction for the time he lived in as he is for us today. How did he manage to unite the people behind him? What forces did he align himself with, what dynamics did he utilise?

In four episodes we examine what life was like in Europe from 1799 until 1815, from the end of the French Revolution until Napoleonâ€™s defeat at Leipzig 1813 and Waterloo 1815. We show Napoleonâ€™s rise and fall exclusively from the point of view of the citizens of his time â€“ blacksmiths, soldiers, farmers, dissidents, housewives - first hand accounts of life changing events, based on authentic historical material, diaries, letters and court documents, and often surprising anecdotes from Napoleonâ€™s reign. These donâ€™t speak of politics and alliances but about blood and tears, tyranny and hunger, about joy and freedom.
