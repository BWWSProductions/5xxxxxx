* Colonial Marines GAMEPLAYING :

The Colonial Marine campaign is to be far closer to that of a standard first-person shooter. Confirmed weapons are the iconic M41A Pulse Rifle (with underslung pump action grenade launcher), M56 Smart Gun (able to detect cloaked enemies and display silhouettes behind closeby walls using it's variable electronic targetting system), M240 Flamethrower (capable of a 'wet shot' where fuel can be fired before igniting it manually with the weapon), the twin barrelled Shotgun (which can fire a simultaneous shot through both barrels for maximum stopping power), the M42A Scope Rifle (a sniper rifle which can detected cloaked Predators and 'see' close proximity targets through walls) and the M4A3 Pistol (capable of three round burst fire). To help navigate your surroundings you are supplied with the use of a shoulder mounted halogen TNR lamp which gives some directed light, along with surveying flares which help to greatly light up darkened areas (albeit briefly). Use these at your own peril as they may very well give away your position. The Motion Tracker made famous in Aliens also needs to be utilised to a player's advantage to highlight and allow the player to take action against likely ambush opportunities by enemies actively seeking you. When trying to capture the atmosphere of the Marine single player campaign, Rebellion best describe it as immersing the player in: "the sheer terror of facing off against the two movie menaces of the title". Rebellion have confirmed that no cutscenes will take place other than from the perspective of the player character and that the point of the campaign is to simply survive. The Marine campaign also contains the most information about the game's plot, whereas the others will simply feature overheard conversations between marines, "shortly before you dice the marines into meaty chunks"
