The two greatest big bands in jazz history side by side on your 

headphones: What can be more glorious? If, as Billy Strayhorn said, Duke 

Ellington's band was his instrument, then this 1961 session finds 

Ellington and Count Basie "trading fours," as it were. The composer 

credits and solo space are divided democratically, to say the least--four 

songs from Duke's camp, four from Basie's. The sparring between soloists 

of both bands is a pure delight, especially the gentle conversations 

between the two leaders-pianists, who finish each other's thoughts as if 

all four hands were attached to one unified torso. Highlights include two 

engaging new Duke compositions--the blistering opener "Battle Royal" and 

the impulsive "Wild Man"--and the closing Basie chestnut "Jumpin' at the 

Woodside," on which the lead tenors Frank Foster and Paul Gonsalves 

engage in ferocious dueling. Amazingly, there is no toe-stepping amid the 

rousing interplay. --Marc Greilsamer
