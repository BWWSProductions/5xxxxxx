 Lawrence Talbot, a haunted nobleman, is lured back to his family estate after
 his brother vanishes. Reunited with his estranged father, Talbot sets out to 
 find his brother... and discovers a horrifying destiny for himself. Talbot's 
 childhood ended the night his mother died. After he left the sleepy Victorian
 hamlet of Blackmoor, he spent decades recovering and trying to forget. But when
 his brother's fiance, Gwen Conliffe, tracks him down to help find her missing
 love, Talbot returns home to join the search. He learns that something with brute
 strength and insatiable bloodlust has been killing the villagers, and that a 
 suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline has come to investigate.
