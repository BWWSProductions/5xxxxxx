Do you think this is better than CloneDVD by Elaborate Bytes?"
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-02-20T00:09Z,TheEmpathicEar. i must say. this is better than CloneDVD by Elaborate Bytes. when it come to options
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-02-20T00:10Z,please don't update
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-02-20T00:54Z,"Does it allow you to ""shrink"" DVD? i.e. DVD9 to DVD5 by selecting main movie, no extras, or selecting audio tracks?"
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-02-20T01:04Z,"@BLACKTROY

Could you answer in a PM? I tried sending you one via Suprbay, but... I am just trying to find out if this supports ""shrinking"" of DVDs?"
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-02-20T18:15Z,TheEmpathicEar yes it can shrink your dvd from 9-to-4 gig. just to let you know this software was a follow up to dvd x copy platinum by 321 studio.
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-02-21T02:16Z,"TheEmpathicEar. i saw you uploaded the same software in demonoid site. i am a member of that site.
i am not suprise why you keep asking questions regarding this software. hehehehe"
,jersson,2010-02-23T05:20Z,"Yepp, this one is definitely better than Clone DVD but the best is still 1 Click DVD Copy Pro in my opinion. Great upload as usual, thank's"
,usertoo,2010-03-02T12:10Z,i cant get the crack to work the installed program wont list in the search..can anyone help pls?
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-03-06T20:46Z,usertoo.-------- ONCE YOU FINISH INSTALLATION. DOUBLE-CLICK THE PATCH  AND LOCATE THE DVDNEXT COPY FOLDER ON  {C . DRIVE} PROGRAMME FILE. OPEN THE FOLDER DVDNEXT-COPY FOLDER AND CRACK THE EXEC-FILE. ----LAME MAN EXPLAINATION LOL
,jrgray6,2010-04-13T20:27Z,"works like a charm, thanks dude.  Just for laughs I even tried your crack on an older version of DNC and it worked"
,sschieferle,2010-10-31T08:11Z,I can not get the crack to work. It tells me that it can't find the target. What am I doing wrong?
,Buckalou,2011-04-22T08:03Z,"Thanks for the upload! I installed and got it to work only question is after I inserted a dvd to copy a message came up from my antivirus (AVG 2011) saying that malware was detected and to move to the virus vault. The file name was appdata\local\temp\nsl8a75.tmp\stl_bbl.exe, anyone else get this and if so is it safe to allow the file. Thanks"
