Ghost Wakefield is a serious, dedicated jazz musician, who plays only what he wants to play. He has imbued the others of his combo with the same ideals---Charlie, Red, Shelly and Pete. The group, filling various charity and park dates, existing on the outer fringes of the successful jazz world, is nevertheless respected for their ethics by Baby Jackson and other contemporaries.
