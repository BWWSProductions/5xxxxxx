They are worlds apart. Yet, they share a common need to find their place in this new world, a coal mine turned women's prison.

Her early encounters with crew leader Blak and Officer Nicole teach her that this won't come easy. From Sgt. Fire, who makes her living out of demanding respect and exercising control over the prisoners to Suga and X, who find happiness in their mutual companionship, it's just another day at River Rock. When Blak discovers an abandoned mining shaft and freedom is within their grasp, the inmates must face who they really are and where happiness really lies.
