 Duplicity_(2009)_DVDRip_x264_by_RiddlerA
I rate it as 8/10 for download speed. It is a much smaller 400mb download compared to 776.
78mb too, so that enables things happen in a hurry.
Visuals 9, Sound 9, Sync 10. 
 Never the less thank you to m.thrall as I know it takes time & effort to upload movies for all to share."
