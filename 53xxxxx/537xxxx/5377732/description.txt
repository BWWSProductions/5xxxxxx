     Morphestra is today's cinematic virtual instrument. Sample Logic's 
     award-winning team presents a powerful collection of creatively new and
     inventive organic instruments. Morphestra is derived entirely from 
     orchestral recordings and psycho-acoustic sound design. In association
     with Kirk Hunter Studios and powered by Native Instruments Kontakt Player
     3, Morphestra is an epic collection of over 27 GB and 1200+ instruments 
     and multis delivered pre-installed on a pocket-sized Glyph hard drive.
