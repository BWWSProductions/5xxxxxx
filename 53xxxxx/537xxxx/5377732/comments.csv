I got it to load as a library, but when kontakt got down to the root sample, I got an error that the samples are missing. Please explain how to set this up so it works...Thanks for the awesome DL's!!"
,yolandiz,2010-03-01T05:37Z,"I figured it out. I didn't have the sample folder merged with the rest of the folders, but I still get a missing files error on some sounds...maybe because I haven't DL'ed all the sample discs yet? "
