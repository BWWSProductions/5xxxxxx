BookLightning 1.7.2

With BookLightning, you can easily create booklets on your printer, just create a PDF document and drop it onto the BookLighting icon. Print the resulting booklet PDF, which BookLightning typically creates in less than a second, fold the pages and staple. Done.
All you need to do is set up your original document at exactly the size you want for the booklet, which will be 1/2 the size of the paper you are printing on as the pages get folded in half.
For the frequent booklet-maker, BookLightning even includes a convenient direct-print feature that lets you print booklets (via BookLightning) straight from the print panel of your application.

PdfCompress

PdfCompress is a Mac OS X utility for reducing the size of PDF files. Just drop your file on the PdfCompress icon and it will quickly create a new, compressed PDF file suitable for sending via e-mail or posting on the Web.
PdfCompress features a wide variety of compression methods (including LZW, Flate, JPEG, font removal, CCITTT Group 4, dead-object stripping, metadata removal) and automaticallly chooses the most appropriate options for your file, yielding compression ratios of up to 10x or more for a wide variety of files. We do recommend you try PdfCompress with your files before you buy a license, as compression varies due not least to fundamental axioms of information theory not all files can be compressed.
PdfCompress never modifies your original file, and always names result files in a manner that indicates they've been compressed, so you can be sure that your data is safe and you won't send or post the wrong file accidentally.
