A short history of the Byzantine Empire.

BBC Blurb
Professor Judith Herrin visits Istanbul to trace the history of the
Roman city of Byzantium and examine the role it played in the
development of modern Europe.

She explores how Byzantine civilisation made possible Europe's
transition to modernity; the fact that it has no modern successor
state; how it combined Christianity with ancient Greek learning
and Roman imperial ideology; and its systems of government,
laws, taxes, education and defence.
