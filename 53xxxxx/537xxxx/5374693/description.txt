I found a USB flash drive in the middle of the road and it had this Dentrix software on it. I don't know if it needs activated or who would even be looking for this type of software, but someone put on a flash drive for a reason, so here ya go. I started the installation up to the point where it asked me if I wanted to install the Server or Workstation software.
