,buzz_uk,2010-02-19T09:27Z,"I found the audio for this movie to be very poor, uneven, echoey and lots of background noise.
Video looked ok. Not sure what source was used but I don't believe it was bluray.
Ditched until a better quality version arrives."

,scurvypirate123,2010-04-18T21:51Z,"The audio is mp3. That's why it's so poor.

Really awful release."

Just imagine the unbalanced system setting."
