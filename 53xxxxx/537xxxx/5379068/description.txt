*** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode archived on DVD TV capture (full-screen 4:3) for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox.***
*** Video is 512x384 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***

NOTE: As requested, I have re-encoded all 6 episodes.
They would be up one-by-one.

IF, by any chance, previous episodes stays without seeders, next one would never come.

In short, keep torrent active at least till sixth episode and 48h afterward.
