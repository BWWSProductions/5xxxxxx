GML Portal, is a mod for snitz forums, that was written by Jag24.Com in conjunction with Thiago Carvalho, John Grant Donald Claessens. Far as I know they don't offer 
support, but with some general knowledge in ASP it can be a good forum. I have modified some of the database threads to work with SQL 2005, and added a online games
section. Its a nice setup! This file is virus free. The previous hosting decided to pack up a sell the domain, you can go here for the demo: http://gmlportal.somee.com

Enjoy!
