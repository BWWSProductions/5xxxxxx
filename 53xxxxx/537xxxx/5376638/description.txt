2010 is the year of the long-awaited PAVEMENT reunion tour, already 

including 4 sold-out shows in Central Park, headlining major festivals 

allover the world, and in general underlining the frenzy that awaits 

the first performances of one of the most important band of the 1990s 

in a decade. This remastered mid-priced, 23-track Greatest Hits 

collection, chosen by the band, ranges from their Top 10 Modern Rock 

hit "Cut Your Hair" to nearly all their singles, some underrated album 

tracks, 3 choice pre-Matador cuts and one obscure compilation track 

singing the praises of REM (?!).
