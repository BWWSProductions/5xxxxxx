New Deal Studios Creative Inspirations

New Deal Studios is where the line between illusion and reality
disappears. Come along for a peek behind the magicians curtain
at one of Hollywoods top visual effects houses. In this Creative
Inspirations documentary, find out how key scenes from Martin
Scorseses film Shutter Island were created, as well as segments
of The Dark Knight and Night at the Museum. Using a combination
of models, miniatures, computer graphics, and digital effects
New Deal Studios was designed from the ground up to be a place
where effects professionals could do their best work, and where
filmmakers could have their visions realized
