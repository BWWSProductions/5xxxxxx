,trickdaddy0024,2010-02-20T05:54Z,Its funny how those who wish to speak about me (protongeek) cant even mention me by name...Nonetheless to my non-followers I follow no one...I follow myself if anything...If Sistromo was outed then thats her own fault...I've been surfing the web for a solid eight years and I try and cover identity as best I can...But if someone did expose my identify then would that mean I would duck and hide...NEVER...I dont care if you have my S.S. number...I would still voice my dislike for Dumbo...The 1st amendment guarantees it...Although I dislike Dumbo Limbaugh I cant spend all my time arguing with idiots...If I chose to walk away...I do it on my terms and with my head held high...I have some unfinished business that I will take care of soon...But in the meantime I let be known...That I am always watching...Chose you words carefully with you talk about me...END

Yeah, we know you have no life. You didn't need to remind us. I mean honestly, who the hell spends so much time stalking people downloading a stupid radio program off the internet? And what do you think you're accomplishing?

Thanks again, jwhitt!"
,trickdaddy0024,2010-02-20T14:15Z,See what I mean about arguing with idiots...Nuff Said
,booboo332,2010-02-20T21:01Z,"BWHAHAHAHAHA!  Oh tricky, you sure do know how to entertain us.

""Chose you words carefully""

Captain Comedy strikes again.

""I am always watching""

That's actually sort of sad.  Nah, just kidding, It's hilarious and so are you.  You keep that head held high, little trick.  The way you take yourself so seriously is at the heart of what makes you so damn funny."
,booboo332,2010-02-20T21:04Z,"Also before I forget, thanks to the uploader."
[T],jwhitt62,2010-02-21T05:12Z,"...unfinished business, tricky???...like flying a plane into a GIVErrnment building. Now I'd pay to see that..."
,herniator,2010-02-22T05:09Z,Just read the comments here and couple older releases... can't believe you have full time socialist-democrats trolls stalking you guys. All I can say is (in Ali-G style) Respec!

i hope your asshole grows together. "

Really halfwit your claim that I am spending so much time is laughable...This is why you will never be Great...Only an uneducated nobody complaining about medicare....Jho it is obvious that you a small man and I mean this sincerely (your tongue is your best friend). When you have to make unsupported comments like ""like flying a plane into a GIVErrnment building."" you wrote...Just shows how weak and insecure you are about opposing views...Next hermaphroditor said ""can't believe you have full time socialist-democrats trolls stalking you guys."" Thats Mr Democrat to you...I guess stalking is the new troll...Lastly, TedKennedy said ""i hope your asshole grows together."" I hope your ass hole gets bigger while getting f%^&ed by Tyrone and Carlos...BITCH...END"
