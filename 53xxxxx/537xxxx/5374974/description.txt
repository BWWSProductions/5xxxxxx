It's a very useful little torrent that is unique in that it repeatedly updates itself every 60 seconds to show the exact IP address you are displaying through bittorrent clients to test your VPN tunnel without having to leave your client to do so. It never stops updating and shows if your VPN is configured properly or has failed/disconnected also. For those using VPN's that only change your browser IP this will prove to you that what you are using is not working. This will show you the IP that anti p2p groups see. I recommend using PeerBlock along with your VPN tunnel but make sure PB isn't blocking key things related to your VPN and iana lists seem to do so, remove them.
