Freedom!"
,dncholas,2010-02-19T03:20Z,In case nobody understands it's setup to a website to communicate back and forth through bittorrent which gives actual IP that you are tunneling. One extra note is that I noticed my PeerBlock has been blocking people using BTGuard VPN I just noticed.
,dncholas,2010-02-19T03:33Z,"I think it's the battle of the blocks here.. lol. Just go to my site and click ""generate tracking torrent"" and then open in client. Whenever you want to check your actual IP visible you just click this torrent in the list and then click trackers and it updates nonstop. Here's the link.. http://www.checkmytorrentip.com/#"
,Paragon_FX,2010-02-19T04:12Z,"Sorry for asking, what is the advantage of knowing the IP address that we are in to. Does it give more speed or something like that?"
,dncholas,2010-02-19T18:01Z,"This is for VPN users only. Some VPN's claim to tunnel all data but do not, only in the browser. Some VPN's do tunnel all data but can disconnect. This awseome torrent file simply communicates between a remote server and your torrent client showing actual IP your non broswer data is using. This allows you to confirm your new IP and never have to leave the client to do so"
,dncholas,2010-02-19T18:07Z,"Just to inform.. many check their proxy or VPN IP's through a browser which is easy to fool, but that doesn't mean your application and bittorrent client data is using the same new IP. This confirms the data tunnel, otherwise you would have to test the tunnel using a 2nd pc and check peer IP's downloading the same torrent and actually connect to the 1st pc, which is a pain in the rear. If you would like to understand this better and try this go to http://itshidden,com and click setup how to and choose free account. Not what I am using because it's slow and unstable but good for beginners :P"
