But I got a question: 
I pasted the serial and activation code into the installer, but a error showed up, and told me It didn't work.. 
Any clue what's wrong?
Thanks for support, will seed long if i get help :)"
,ulfsnes94,2011-02-06T20:42Z,"Sorry for spam, but I found out what I'm missing: 
What is the licensenumber? 
Got serial
Got activation ID
Don't got licensenumber.."
,fgcarva1,2011-02-11T01:39Z,"There's no licence number, no way to register it."
,EliteNinja00,2011-09-18T05:04Z,I need the License Number!!! WTF
,AkuMaYaRi,2012-01-10T23:52Z,"I found a work around for the license number.
after you install go to register and click "" Already have Activation ID"" enter in your generated serial and then enter in  000000000000000 as your license id. Now all you need to do is copy the install number and paste it into the keygen, generate an activation id, and click next. the software will register and install flawlessly. Be sure to block the files internet access after installation!

,annuit02,2012-01-12T04:01Z,THanks! I got it to work.
,DisasterSint,2012-02-15T21:05Z,"I got a question.

I installed the program then i generated the serial put after and I used 000000000000000 for the license number and after that i have to accept something alright i did that. But after that i got to add the activation ID but after I clicked Next i get an error message what can I do?"
,DisasterSint,2012-02-15T21:13Z,"I already got it. After you have accepted those termes and other stuff and you clicked on next a new windows shows up.

In that window stays an installation ID put that ID (so the installation ID from the real program) in your keygen and hit generate. Paste the new Activation ID from the keygen to the program and you got it!"
,padirts,2012-04-03T00:03Z,"I tried to install this, but failed. I started over, but this time, I can't get to a point where I have the opportunity to click ""Already have Activation ID"". All I can get to is at the point when the installation is fully completed, and I can choose between ""Active License"", ""Use Test Version"", and ""Buy a New License"". In none of these options, I cant get to use the keygen, it just asks for a license number, but all I can get is a serial number from the keygen.  Plz help, I'm a noob."
,kilho,2012-04-26T18:27Z,"Ok, so i installed this and updated, but now i get the c22 error. Can someone help me? ^^"
