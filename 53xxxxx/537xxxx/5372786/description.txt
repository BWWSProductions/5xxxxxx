        Based on a true story from the book "With Honor and  Purpose",
        Street Boss  follows FBI  agent Phil  Kerby on  his relentless
        quest to bring down one of Detroit's most notorious  mobsters,
        Tony Jack.

        Anthony J.  Giacolone (Tony  Jack) owned  the city  and nobody
        ever stood in his way. The police were paid off and anyone who
        posed a threat to Tony or  his crew ended up with a  price tag
        on their head.  This all changed  when David Goldberg  and his
        family became Jack's newest  targets, Phil Kerby vowed  to put
        and end to this extortion once and for all.

        When David Goldberg fired his long time friend and Tony Jack's
        nephew, Jimmy Callone, he never thought that he would have  to
        face the  wraith of  Tony Jack  himself, but  he was seriously
        mistaken. Within days, Tony Jack appeared at David's home with
        an ultimatum: "Pay us One Hundred Thousand Dollars or you  and
        your family die!" Goldberg,  not trusting the police,  decides
        to  deal with  the problem  himself, but  his daughter  has a
        different idea and turns to FBI Agent Phil Kerby for help.

        Kerby quickly  realises that  Tony Jack  is not  a small  time
        extortionist; his connections ran deep. The police are  afraid
        and the corruption  is extreme. But  now Kerby, the  new agent
        transferred to this Michigan FBI Bureau is about to make  some
        serious changes. His first  mission: to take Jack  down, bring
        safety to David  Goldberg's family and  return justice to  the
        town.

        Kerby  enlists  the  help of  another  local  FBI Agent,  Paul
        Miller. They  use undercover  agents, high  tech surveillance,
        and  insiders  to  gather  the  details  of  Jack's extortion,
        gambling rings and crime sprees. As the Investigation is about
        to reach  a boiling  point, one  of Kerby's  fellow FBI Agents
        turns  out  to  be  a snitch  and  blows  the  whistle on  the
        investigation.  Now  Kerby  is forced  to  confront  the Mafia
        alone.
