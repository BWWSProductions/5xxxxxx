This East German story of a party leader in disgrace and a cynical leader of a worker brigade offered only the mildest criticism of the communist system, but was barred from being shown when it was made in 1966. Not only that, but its director Frank Beyer was forbidden to make films for a decade. In the story, a married Communist party secretary (i.e., a government big-wig) with a family of his own has fallen into disgrace as a result of having an affair with a young women and getting her pregnant. Consequently, he is accused of "immoral behavior, careerism and political and ideological failure." Strong, if puzzling words. Another type of man entirely is also in love with the young woman. He is the "brigade leader" (foreman) of a construction crew. His cynicism about the party's role in the workplace is possibly one of the reasons the film was banned until 1990.
