The Ghost Dinner Band - In Nightmares

A cool alternative/psychedelic rock band from Antrim, NH. This is 'In Nightmares', their debut album, which I'd say is a mix of Cobain-like vocals, avant-garde songwriting, and Hendrix-esque sonic experimentation, with the occasional awesome guitar solo.
These guys are a great local band, and by uploading this I hope get the word out about them.

Best song: Pixilated. Check it out.
