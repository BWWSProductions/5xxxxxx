,Qcmax09,2010-02-18T00:10Z, is this real ? is it possible to get proof ?
,sshalafi,2010-02-18T00:13Z,"It's real that the beta is out.
You can watch a stream here
http://www.teamliquid.net/video/userstream.php?user=Liquid%60NonY

I cannot prove you that the files are the good ones, but if you download the torrent you'll get all the seeds that are using Blizzard's tracker...

And I think that's proof enough."
,NoNic2,2010-02-18T00:22Z,"Leak is real, beta is out, please hackers crack this bitch as soon as possible. I am dying to play it."
,FieryCoD,2010-02-18T00:30Z,How do you possibly crack a beta? Just sign up at Blizzard's site and register an account for a key.
,lovesc2,2010-02-18T00:30Z,Anyone with completed download please comment
,JPeterson,2010-02-18T00:32Z,Where can I follow the progress of a bnetd patch that enables a private server?
,NoNic2,2010-02-18T00:33Z,"Not quite, beta is closed testing, you need legit cd key, so we only hope for some kind of crack so we can play skirmish vs AI or private server for multiplayer"
,FieryCoD,2010-02-18T00:34Z,"AFAIK, if you download the client you can play with bots, just not online with other peers."

,sshalafi,2010-02-18T00:38Z,"@JPeterson:

I'll update the description of the torrent as soon as I find one, and you can be sure that I'll be searching.

But if you want to find the original source of a crack, you should search in torrent sites. Chances are that scene groups will upload them there.


@NoNic2: 

A private server with limited functionality shouldn't be hard to do. I expect them very soon."

,lovesc2,2010-02-18T01:13Z,OK so calm down... installer is indeed workink but battle.net is problem. It will not let you in

Well, of course, I already knew that from the Streams at teamliquid.

But you can download the game now and wait for the crack."

Thats true... you will see

Thats battle.net account does not include an associated copy of Starcraft 2. Please log into Battle.net account management and add the game to your account.

and thats ofcourse impossible without Blizzard beta inviting email, or blizzcon key.

Once again we have to wait :/"

Crack :D :D :D Loled !!! and what u whant to crack :D Battle.net :D ?"
,lovesc2,2010-02-18T01:24Z,"one more thing... this is definitely worthy of download. Installer works like charm, game is clean of viruses or whatever and game menu itself respons absolutely normally. So dl if you want to be ready."
,NoNic2,2010-02-18T01:27Z,I am curious what private server will have balls to set up SC2 server as Blizzard no doubt have army of lawyers ready to attack lol (-:

A single player bot-only crack seems possible, no?"

,fyoshietnikka,2010-02-18T01:33Z,lol I doubt a crack will ever come out for this beta. It's multiplayer only. No singleplayer and I doubt they added AI. RA3 had a pretty sought after beta and nobody cracked that and it was gamespy/EA hahaaha
,Humbugger409,2010-02-18T01:35Z,"@fyoshietnikka

It has bot support, there is a single player mode where you can pay 1v1, or 2v2 with bots this was confirmed before it even released.

Also all of Blizzards previous betas were cracked and running on private servers."
,lovesc2,2010-02-18T01:36Z,"@fyoshietnikka

not true, during downloading i was watching nonys stream the one mentioned at second comment i think. First few games were played against AI."
,BishopAA,2010-02-18T01:37Z,"@fyoshietnikka
Safe to say the demand for SC2 beta completely destroys RA3's beta."
,NoNic2,2010-02-18T01:38Z,"No PC game ever was safe from hackers, this will fall as quickly as possible as it is one of most wanted PC games in history. I bet hackers are hacking this as we speak"
,lovesc2,2010-02-18T01:41Z,"@NoNic2

very true but is there any real presumption of crack release???"
,fyoshietnikka,2010-02-18T01:42Z,Well I hope you guys are right. It was good idea to distribute it so anyone with coding skills can have a go.
,BishopAA,2010-02-18T01:42Z,"@lovesc2
If no crack comes out before the day ends, I'll eat a hat."
,JPeterson,2010-02-18T01:46Z,"@BishopAA

It should be a few breakpoints and patches in OllyDbg and it should be done"

Now, until a crack comes out or until your Battle.net account is activated, you can watch the planet and HUGE ASS Battlecruiser fly around and listen to the stunning music without that pesky menu in the way.

Hopefully this works out like the WC3 beta. People were able to emulate the bnet server and allow people to simply play MP online (none of the fancy features tho). As of now I'm not aware of anyone working on this yet. Hopefully this battle.net 2.0 isn't too much of a headache to work around."

,fallengt,2010-02-18T08:10Z," There won't be any cracks, don't get your hope up. This beta only has battle.net mode, not single player mode or whatever which means you have to connect through battle.net to play with other people (include vs AI).

 And I doubt that Private server will be there anytime soon, cuz SCII use battle.net 2.0 , There hasn't a emulation for that yet. So deal with it people, no key = no game.

4) click the green BETA link next to the add and merge link
5) download the version accordingly, PC, or MAC.
6) after download run the program and submit all the info

watch the live stream. after he finishes a game you can see the option to play against AI... unfortunately its blacked out.. which means its not avaliable. also listen he talked about it before, ive been watching since midnight.  anyway, sometimes things are in a BETA but not avaliable. i think this beta is more gears toward the new battle.net and less to the game, they have the game how they want, they are seeing how multiplayer is. 

im sorry to say, but i think the only way people will get to play is with a beta key, and no, its not fair for blizzard to only have select few play, but hey if my theory is correct that means if all goes well then the game is still scheduled for what.. march?  i have seen NO bugs at all, which means the game is in tip top shape.

im sorry i didnt mean to post it like that. 

IN ORDER TO GET OPTION TO MERGE WoW account, you need to download trial, you cant use a cd key if its on another account. you need to add trial THEN merge. otherwise it wont give you the option. then you can use that as your 1 game."
,sshalafi,2010-02-18T11:22Z,"@X_Zabot_X

Blizzard betas last a lot. Usually about half a year. They do a lot of balance work there.

Also, I saw Nony's stream and he played 1vs3 AIs.

There are 2 ways to bypass: a crack, that allows to play vs Ais, and a private server. I expect the first in a few days and the later in a week.

Wc3 and WoW betas were hacked too."
,X_Zabot_X,2010-02-18T11:25Z,"to help a few people out im going to do something. i signed up for the BETA a while ago. Now its not official i will get it so dont get your hopes up. what i AM willing to do if i DO get it, is share it, i will give a few people my account info to log in as i have everything set up to recover it. im not going to share with a bunch of people maybe in between 2-5, it will be first come first serve so add me on this hotmail account i made for msn.  
as i said i cant say i WILL get it, but if i do im willing to do this.

oh ok, i see.

but with the new B-net up, it will take a while before can create a free server LOL, everyone who has access to it is playing starcraft :P  anyway though im all gung ho for getting it, im just trying to give some people hope, it took me hours to figure this crap out LOL so im just trying to help.

i can see a crack coming out before private server deffinately. but i dont know if the beta will last THAT long, where all betas have been nowadays, they are usually a month to three, sometimes not even near that. older games had a lot of tweeking that needed to be done. today they learn from their mistakes (most of the time) and im sure that it wont be to much longer. like i said i havent seen any bugs in the game thus far.  so im pretty sure this is just a way to test out their servers or something rather than the game."

 PLAY AS GUEST
MANAGE ACCOUNT

So yes, there is a hidden Offline mode. It's dissabled, but it can probably be enabled. And it means that the IA is computed by the client.

I don't think it's that easy, but yeah, it should be possible to play without a private server vs AIs.

I think that the offline mode, if enabled, requires you to have conected at least once, like steam.

,hallmao,2010-02-18T15:52Z,"Just found something interesting when you copy all *.dll files from  StarCraft II Beta\Support and paste them at StarCraft II Beta\Versions\Base13891 , you are able to run the SC2*.exe , ( this exe works if you already skiped the launcher that requires the battlenet acc with sc2 , so there must be a way to run it jumping the damn login on battle net , just presuming not a confirmation )"
,mrt3abag,2010-02-18T16:02Z,just give it time be patient... WoW beta and Wc3 beta were cracked. soon Starcraft 2 beta will muhahahahha
,yutorre,2010-02-18T16:05Z,"@sshalafi

That doesn't mean anything. They obviously removed codes from the build so you can't play as guest, they just keep the button disabled instead of removing it.

The AI IS on battle.net.

@X_Zabot_X

Just reading what you write shows me you are such a noob. You know nothing about cracking. All you know is scenes groups crack games before they are released. 

First of all, the game they crack often can't be played on official servers.

If they can then: 
1) the game doesn't require a cd-key at all.
2) they can do a cd-key gen that works online (that means the server sucks)

In this case, everything about your account information is hosted on battle.net. It's like trying to play WOW on the official servers without an account.

Now Shut the fuck up. 

MAYBE they were foolish enough to leave the offline mode in the build. but I HIGHLY doubt it.


Second, private servers are often done with the help of lan, and lan doesn't exist in sc2. It can be done but it's gonna take months of reverse engineering and lots of beta keys. 


Conclusion, if you can crack this it's gonna be because Blizzard are fucking morons and don't know their job. 

Therefore, It won't happen."
,Qcmax09,2010-02-18T16:57Z,does anyone got a way to get in the beta anyhow ? offline or online ( wich i doubt ? )
,mohoe,2010-02-18T16:58Z,"@yutorre

,yutorre,2010-02-18T17:01Z,"@mohoe

Doesn't surprise me, the amount of kids around here must be high."
,doomboom,2010-02-18T17:09Z,"@yutorre

Anything can happen, cracks within the guest mode are being made now. its complicated. but with piracy is the key."
,wesleathy,2010-02-18T17:11Z,"Yes it's full of kids starting with yourself yutorre. Who is talking anything about cd-keys?  People are hoping for cracking the beta as in making it avaliable offline or on private servers. Months of reverse engeneering? Every single game of blizzard's beta have been made avalliable on private server 1 week after the release of the beta in worst scenario. 
And why do you waist your time crushing the hype of fans? Go jurk off and let us look forward with passion to when we get to play this wonderful game."
,zizipuk,2010-02-18T17:16Z,"Can't be cracked my azz. Rockstar games or as I call em IdiotStar Games spent like $500 000 for protection on GTA and it was cracked in less than a week.
Official blizz servers are ""noob heaven"" and I saw a game there in SC II Beta yesterday when it took a Zerg noob 30 min to get to ~10 zerglins. "
,DoomerGuy,2010-02-18T17:18Z,"Every single game these days has been cracked, why the hell would this be uncrackable?"
,yutorre,2010-02-18T17:18Z,"@wesleathy

that is incorrect. Private servers for new games, not expansions, take way more time than that.

And you missed my point about cd-key, I was saying SC2 is not using a cdkey sheme but an online account. That means it's not the same league now that lan was removed."
,DoomerGuy,2010-02-18T17:20Z,"OK, that CAN be a problem"
,yutorre,2010-02-18T17:21Z,"@DoomerGuy

Because this build does not include a single player or any code that allows a computer AI to work. Or any code that allows you to host a game.

The only thing that can be done is a private server.

But it would be very dumb to think it's gonna happen in a matter of days. 

I know you are all on your little clouds in the sky but let's come back on earth. This is going to be hard."
,DoomerGuy,2010-02-18T17:23Z,"And, how do you make a private server?"
,doomboom,2010-02-18T17:23Z,"yutorre that is bullshit, there's  a crack being made now, if not there wouldn't be so many people downloading and seeding. people aren't dumb you know."
,DoomerGuy,2010-02-18T17:26Z,"Ok, who is right guys, doomboom or yutorre?"
,wesleathy,2010-02-18T17:26Z,"I doubt they've trusted the AI to their servers. Makes no sense imo. And I remember how amazed I was when I saw first WoW private server 3 days after the game was released. 
World is full of intelligent enough ppl that will make this work at least in the most basic level. 
We'll wait and see."
,usmc23,2010-02-18T17:26Z,"Singleplayer is built in because you can play online in a singleplayer game once you are logged in.  

There are SOME references to singleplayer events in the sc2.exe but I doubt thats a good route to go.

Sense you CAN play singleplayer(skirmish) online once you are logged in, why can't we just NOP the battle.net instructions in the EXE make it THINK its authenticated, so at the very least we can play singleplayer.  Thats something im looking at right now."
,yutorre,2010-02-18T17:29Z,"@doomboom

People are just downloading and hoping something is made.

If someone wants to make a private servers, he wouldn't need to download this, because he has an official account with a working battle.net account anyway. It's needed.

Those downloading this aren't those that are going to crack it. 

Maybe some are reverse engineering it at the moment. Then if they can give me a confirmation they include the guest part of the game in the build, but just disabled it. I will gracefully stfu. But it looks like it wasn't included at all, as in, when they compiled it they didn't compile the singleplayer part/guess part."
,yutorre,2010-02-18T17:29Z,"@usmc23

You are playing singleplayer versus AI hosted on Battle.net. This is completly different."
,xxgen,2010-02-18T17:29Z,"guys guys, let me try to help, people are trying to come up with a crack however even if the crack does work two things can happen

that crack could enable a hidden single player feature or have it connect to a privet server

the crack most likely would not enable a single player feature but you never know they might have hid somewhere within the beta

if it is the privet server the crack won't be released for sometime 

your best bet is to make a battle.net account then buy starcraft download so you have a game on your account then send in your specs on your best computer in your house my best computer in my house is 3.06 gigerz intel duel core nivdia gforce 9400 imac so its not a bad computer at all"
,yutorre,2010-02-18T17:32Z,"@wesleathy

It makes sense, that way multiple players can play against an ai and be synced without having a player to 'host' it for everybody."
,usmc23,2010-02-18T17:33Z,"@yutorre thats corrent but right now people that arent in the beta can't play the game at all.

If you look at routine: sub_C99940 it references lookup for local area IP addresses but again I doubt that means anything.

The easiest crack without a dump of a legit login, would be to get around the battle.net code by making each authentication function return valid values and getting into the singleplayer skirmish mode."
,yutorre,2010-02-18T17:34Z,"@xxgen 

by the way if you have high specs, your chances are actually reduced because they want to test low-end computers."
,BSol,2010-02-18T18:25Z,"anyone know of any teams working on private servers?

Now I am interested in the .gfx files of the Battle.net.mpq

Specifically, Home.gfx

See if I can show the button.


Anyway, I might be interested talking about this on irc. "
,yutorre,2010-02-18T18:34Z,"World of warcraft is probably related to the RealID
And starcraft tools to the Editor"
,usmc23,2010-02-18T18:35Z,"I would be interested in some sort of ""blog"" with other people trying to crack the beta.

But it seems ""Starcraft II.exe"" may or may not have some interesting stuff in there. But Starcraft II.exe has a STD string that im guessing is some kind of key to run sc2.exe, but I got passed that with NOPing the jump to call ""Must launch game from launcher"" message. Which was useless.

But it changes the game title to starcraft 2 beta when EAX is equal to one, mabye if EAX was 0 it might unlock some stuff, like if they lock there game via the launcher. But again this is probley unlikely as well."
,w47,2010-02-18T18:36Z,i think that it's the same process as by wc3 or wow.
,usmc23,2010-02-18T18:38Z,"@yutorre would you be cool with talking about this on IRC?

Im interested in the GFX stuff as well, but it might be just a collection of compressed images for a menu.  The trick would be to see if theres any script stuff in there."
,e1337idiot,2010-02-18T18:47Z,"Guys, I'm wondering if it's possible to capture the packet that SC2.exe receives after you send your info (using something like WPE PRO.)  Then you could modify that packet to make the login successful and send it to yourself.  

I'm obviously a noobie, but if anybody on TPB has a legit login, set SC2 to windowed mode, capture the packets you get when you login in with WPE PRO, and then save the txt file and distribute it so that somebody can figure this shit out..."
,usmc23,2010-02-18T18:48Z,People won't post that publically because that contains there B.NET login information.

,btcs,2010-02-19T00:05Z,"I find it hard to believe there will be private servers by this weekend. I give it a month. At least.

As far as playing bots offline - depending on how everything is configured it could be relatively soon or it may turn out to be much harder than it seemed and take weeks.

I'm hoping that at least in the next week we can get beyond the login screen and maybe even create a game without bots or other players.

,FCisco,2010-02-19T00:38Z,"Lol @ Mederps joke

Man... after so many years it's here :D

i think i can wait some more.

It was quite a good business move by Blizzard, i bet they sold a shitload games bought by players who just wanted to play the beta.

(me among those lol)"
,Mederp,2010-02-19T00:39Z,"Yeah we all appreciate the updates, you guys are the real heroes, giving us a free demo while blizzard wants us to wait fucking 5 years to play the game."
,NoNic2,2010-02-19T00:40Z,"yea,progress is great, oh man those lucky beta players are playing like 20 hours a day, hope we dont fall behind in skill too much cuz we cant play yet"
,2weak,2010-02-19T00:46Z,"i completely agree, they told us they were making the game back in 2005 or 2006 then we heard rumors it would be released early 2008 then summer 2008 then august then they said it would be released in December  during Christmas for more sale, then they said they made a mistake on how much work needed to be done and now The Beta not even the full game  will be released in January which turned out to be late February... and if your not in the lucky 1% of people that opted in (actual statistic given by dustin browder)they gave the beta to you have to wait another 6 months to get the real game which will probably turn out to be 8-9months which they will extend to release during Christmas."
,2weak,2010-02-19T00:48Z,"thank god for hackers, only god knows what we would do with out them lol"
,xxgen,2010-02-19T00:50Z,"hey guys this is like my 6th comment on this torrent or forum you might as well call it anyway everyone on the original starcraft are all like 8 year olds playing if you want to rack up some points go play starcraft the first one and you will pwn all the noobs if you have any prior experience i'm glad starcraft 2 beta made some progress. 

FUN FACT - Did you know today around 8AM eastern time the phrase search in google ""starcraft ll (2) beta crack"" was number 19 on this list lol febuary 18th 2010,

I'm also wondering if we don't get to play the beta or if it does not get cracked then i am wondering a beta is what a company thinks is their best work and they would release it however they want people to test and report back witch means this game could be comming out fairly soon and i assume many of you download games from torrents i don't but i'm sure many of you do and soon you will be able to get starcraft 2 the full version i hope... lol hope this cheers up some folk or peeps whatever you wana call the peers of this comments/ forum/ chat room."
,eternal70200,2010-02-19T00:53Z,"Millions an hero after hackers find crack to SC2, but decide to go outside instead. Possibly greatest moment of lulz in history."

,Wintermist,2010-02-19T00:54Z,"I'm still hoping for a BETA code, although sooner is better tha later. Regardless, I'm buying any game with a Starcraft logo on it lol.

,2weak,2010-02-19T00:58Z,"hey this is for the great people working on cracking this thing, i was thinking if you could just change to server to a different server instead of bnet2 but something on hamachi like WoW then you could play on a multiplayer on that, am not sure how will it would work out but i think it could works, just like iccup change the gateways for sc1 to were you could go to there server and play there"
,lordStude,2010-02-19T00:58Z,Just giving it a few years until we hear of World Of Starcraft
,SocalCruisin,2010-02-19T01:06Z,"If they came out with World of Starcraft, that would just about do it for me I wouldn't need to play any other game for a looong looong time. I remember when I first got the original staercraft in 98' my aunt got it for me as she worked for blizzard at the time...

GO HACKERS!!!!"
,Mederp,2010-02-19T01:10Z,"Does that mean your aunt can get us free sc 2 beta keys?
lol jk"
,esp724,2010-02-19T01:11Z,"Here's my ideas....

1. The private server idea
- We could already use the base of another project called PvPGN and go from there (once we know more about SC2's packets and stuff)

2. The offline button
- Great idea, but how would the users get it? I just hope we could patch it ourselves, or the hackers release a patch that does it. The worse case is that we'd have to redownload SC2 that comes with the modified files. Idk though..."
,Noodelz,2010-02-19T01:12Z,"I would not be surprised in the least bit if this wins some sort of award for being the most globally anticipated video game in history. Those working hard to crack this beta are the heroes of true hardcore gamers, because I remember the day when original starcraft was so hardcore that it was honestly frightening to some people.
 I picked up original starcraft in '98 and I was 8 years old. Starcraft adopted me into gamerhood and grew me into the core gamer that I am now. Honestly, call me stupid but I hold large amounts of sentimental value to this game, and I could not be more excited and proud of this sequels release. Yeah, blizzard has odd methods... But dont act like we dont all love blizzard. They made the foundations for much of what we know is quality gaming today. They put down the framework for so much of what is in every game released within the last decade.

BTW, I know that this "
,Mederp,2010-02-19T01:12Z,pvPGN sounds like a great starting point.
,Heiderich,2010-02-19T01:14Z,I'm really excited about a possible crack... I've been waiting for this beta for forever.
,Noodelz,2010-02-19T01:15Z,"Is not related to the cracking, but Since we're all just waiting around for it, might as well share our deeper values for the game. I know we all have at least one game that means more then a game to us, and I think for a lot of people it is starcraft. So, Thanks again crackers for working hard. seriously, Thankyou. Seriously.

if there are any responses or personal stories towards the game as well as mine, post them up! dont worry, We're all just as giddy :D :D :D"
,esp724,2010-02-19T01:21Z,"Well, I love RTS games, and I love Blizzard... I also love good graphics, physics, and a game that acutally runs on my POS graphics card (950GMA btw).

SC2 matches all these :D"
,lordStude,2010-02-19T01:21Z,There was this one time when i was at home by myself and starcraft came in and well it touched me...in places i don't want to talk about it.. made me feel..dirty
,SikPoet1990,2010-02-19T01:22Z,"My best friend bought me Starcraft for my birthday back in 2001 right before he moved away and I played it for 7 years straight after that. I was addicted to this shit. I then took like a year off and played on/off for the remainder of the time until now, so my skill level isn't nearly as high as it used to be. Most of the people commenting in here could probably destroy me now."
,SikPoet1990,2010-02-19T01:23Z,"Also. Is the only difference between the 3 versions of Starcraft 2 going to be the missions? If so, I'm buying the Terran version."
,esp724,2010-02-19T01:29Z,whoa..whoa....WHOA.... 3 versions? each costing money?
,GreenArchon,2010-02-19T01:30Z,"Yes, 3 version, so you'll pay thrice (assuming you buy the game). But at 1-2 years intervals."
,Amberlamp,2010-02-19T01:31Z,"@SikPoet1990

Just like SC1 they will undoubtedly incorporate more units and aspects to gameplay with each expansion. This will make everyone with the first SC2 *need* the expansions to be up to date and in the loop. Kinda like Diablo 2 and D2:LOD."
,Gordo123,2010-02-19T01:33Z,"@esp724

There will be 3 installments. The first one, this one, is Wings of Liberty and the only story that is included is the Terran campaign. The Zerg and Protoss will be released later. Yes they will all cost 60 bucks a piece. And the last 2 will be considered X-packs so you will need the previous one(s) to play it. HOWEVER, each campaign will contain just as many if not more missions then the entire first games campaigns combined. So technically, it's 3 different games that take place in the same universe... "
,Noodelz,2010-02-19T01:33Z,"I am just so excited to have a second go at my skill, because with SC1, I learned very young so I learned with bad habits and was never old enough to change them, but Im learning to play SC2 with the perfect style and working on my micro a LOT. Im very excited to be pro :D"
,crazyminer,2010-02-19T01:35Z,"This is bugging me sooo much... I have the beta and i keep watching footage of the bate and i feel like, playing SC2 is just out of my reach...
like having something in you hands but it might as well be 100 miles away."
,esp724,2010-02-19T01:39Z,"I have bad habits as well... When i play RTS, I always seem to work more on building stuff and gaining resources, then actually building some sort of defense or an army lol...

Also about the 3 SC2's, meh I guess thats acceptable anyway... I sort of wish software just came on 1 disc, like the copies of vista and 7... Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, who is really going to know a difference between basic and premium? And then theres x86 and x64... cant just come on 1 disc..."
,SikPoet1990,2010-02-19T01:53Z,"@ Amberlamp

,Gordo123,2010-02-19T02:24Z,=\ I wish I could be helping... Are they hex editing these things? Or what...
,2weak,2010-02-19T02:26Z,well right now we have figured out that bnet2 is alot like a stand alone steam game. so it would help alot if we had someone with us with experience cracking steam servers...
,btcs,2010-02-19T02:29Z,"For cracking/emulating steam see teknogods.com . 

It sounds like a server emulator will be difficult with a dump of a legit log-in. From what I've read as of now only about 500 keys have been released mostly to press and fansites. Until it opens up to more people it will be difficult to obtain."

Some of the best memories I have are back in 1996/1997 when the entire office would get together to play the Starcraft beta on our Power Mac towers. We ran a multimedia company and spent more time on Warcraft 2 and Starcraft beta then we did working. It's way too bad they decided on a closed beta. There is nothing wrong with giving us a taste of a game that we are going to purchase anyway! I still love Blizzard to death but I just don't feel the love like I used to. "

"
,2weak,2010-02-19T04:08Z,you see we dont know how it works so our best guess is to create a bnet2 emulator but since the program isnt designed to go there and they have hidden and changed all the fonts that could help us leaving notes saying 'TRANSLATE THIS'--blizzards joke to us hackers. so we have to remake the entire login process the create a proxy bnet2 emulator to track all the files and see which one sends info to the proxy. then we reverse engineer everything from there. but you see how the process is easily shortened with a bnet2 account.

,2weak,2010-02-19T04:40Z,"@past few comments
the beta works like this. once you get the key you go to wow site and correspond it to your bnet online account(the same place you opt in for beta)
once it gets there should take 1day maybe 2. it will show up on your bnet account from there you would download the beta then log on to bnet with your online bnet account. if he does have a key he isnt using or have already synced it with his account. we have already downloaded the beta also. from here we need a bnet account and pass, it would solve all our problems but it would drastically help us out because from there its just reverse engineering."

very good guess, your correct the login process is hardcoded we plan on changing this to a hamachi kind of network and are working on this, turns out we are going to dump the bnet2.ddl and completly create a new one, since bnet2.dll is giving us so much trouble, before we can make the hamachi based server we need to know how bnet operates and how it connects to it. and will need data from a login from scratch so we might need the beta key or account sooner than expected, i will keep you updated on our progress."

,2weak,2010-02-19T07:11Z,"@btcs
that is the problem we will soon encouter we plan on finding someone with a beta kind enough to donate the beta maps, the problem is we dont even know where to look for them since the beta map folder isnt even created untill the first succesfull login where all other neccesary maps are downloaded. we plan to have a seperate file manager running while we log on to the beta so we can moniter and data that has been exchanged and copy the process. but like what you said to be completly serious we need a account to use or atleast a beta key when we first started, the people that worked on sc1 would never have attempted this, like the reference i made earlier to getting into a locked house by tunneling under it, it is easier with the key but not impossible without it and that is what drives us. we never thought we could get past any of blizzards tricks(as posted before) changing the language of the text, having features in the game program backwards to kill debbuggers, etc... this whole thing is a work in progress and after looking how much progress we have made without the key we are hope we can make more at the same pace. we also think we may be able to view downloaded replays with the sc2 beta now with minor glitches."

a key generator will not work, mainly because blizzard has been extremely clever about there process, they only made a few keys then put those exact key onto there program to be accepted, so there isnt an algorithm there is a list of keys that once used gets crossed of the list, then as they give out more keys they add  more to the list which quickly get used and crissed out, once they go into mass production we may work on the key, but i doubt we will since we are all blizzard fans and encourage buying the real game, we just dont like how this beta testing situation  is working out"

Most of these people are well occupied, you'd do better to become familiar with programming languages (such as c++) and learn those to get a basic understanding of what you are working with. After that you will find a wealth of information to be useful on forums and such. Crackers use debugging programs that attempt to decompile .exe files back to a programming language (in my experience assembly code). But none of the code will be of any use to you unless you know how programming works."

@all those who don't know what they're talking about...

it's not too complicated.. use the program they linked to you.. its basically to open up the .mpq files that are in the beta directory... all you're doing is editing those.. it's like cut n paste in explorer..its showing you all the files/folders in the .mpq files"

that means use mpq editor to extract mainui.gfx from the battle.net mpq found in the battle.net folder in the sc2 folder. extract the file to the same folder battle.net.mpq is foud in. after doing this change the name of the folder recently created by extracting to SWF and the folder named SWF in that folder to Authentication and then change the name of mainui.gfx to authentication.gfx"

i think iwantstarcraft was reffering to the tutorial on how to get to main menu, which i did just post but i will repeat.
#1 download mpq editor which can be found by searching google
#2 use mpq editor to browse into you  sc2 beta folder which should be found in C://program files/ sc2 beta build. once there open the folder called battle.net inside will be a file with no extension simply called battle.net.
#4 open this inside you will find a a folder name battlenet inside that a fold called SWF inside that a file name mainui.gfx right click and extract the to the same folder you found the no extension file called battle.net(you can extract to desktop and move if you want)
#5 after extracting go back to where battle.net folder is and in there you will see a new folder there called battle.net, change its name to SWF, no inside of it you will see a folder named SWF change that to Authentication, and inside that you will see the mainui.gfx file you extracted change its name to authentication.gfx
#6 start the beta 
i hope this cleared things up"

ok guys new info, if you cannot find any folders you must make them yourself, i already  posted this

if you cannot find a file or folder(ex.appdata) it is a hidden folder and you must show hidden folders to veiw it,(once in folder window is open click on tools if you dont see this click alt and it should appear, once at tools. click on folder options then click on the tab called view. in there  there are alot of things to enable and disable for now just like for one that says show/hide hidden files. move to to show and you should be able to see it now, also if your a programmer or soon to be prog. turn on show files with unknown extensions which will allow you to tweak windows a bit) personnally i have 2 accounts on my latop so when i added the files i still couldnt view reps, you fix this by adding them to the user with the admin priviledges i just did it for both. hope this helps"
,Moosah,2010-02-19T09:15Z,"@fffffuuu

I can watch the replays. (Which is awesome!!)

I just find it strange that it works as we 'apparently' don't have the map files..

From my understanding, SCII replays are not just a video recording of the game, but somehow just replayed in in the engine (how I have no idea).. Because surely the replay file is too small to contain a 20+ minute video. Meaning the map files must be somewhere on my PC. (Unless they're contained within the cache files somewhere? But if that's the case, all the maps are less than 10mb??)"
,2weak,2010-02-19T09:15Z,"@sc2beta 
there is no quit button because like the options button and the login screen they were hard coded and very hard to get around so they bypassed the whole thing and went striaght to the in game menu. 
for now the only way to exit is alt.f4"
,sc2beta,2010-02-19T09:19Z,"I couldn't play any replays but now I can play some. The only thing I changed was I deleted the empty folders (not cache, Download, or TMP), and I copied all the files out of the folder cache (not Cache, but cache, which is inside) and put the in the  folder (so you'd have ""Battle.net\Cache\df""). And then I deleted the cache folder. Now some replays work, dunno why. I'm guessing cause it was looking in the empty folders which for some reason I had."
,xiph3r123,2010-02-19T09:20Z,"@2weak

It seems with some people they are able to replay on maps. I'm wondering if there are a few maps that are just hardcoded and encrypted into the client. Perhaps when the player tells the client to replay the video, the client sends a signal to decrypt the map to play the replay. This is all just theoretical and all though."
,2weak,2010-02-19T09:26Z,"@xiph
right now the assumption is that there are copies of the map somewhere in the cache files, since blizzard stated that you cannot play the reps with out the map since they arent videos but the game reenacted on the map. we have achieved so much in so little time"

yes we have think that the maps are stored in some way inside of the replays and are working on extracting them, what you are reading is a map detail info, which is only part of the map. we know the extension of map files hidden in the replays we just need to extract and use them in custom games somehow"

,theunnamedone,2010-02-19T10:20Z,god. i've been watching a few replays. these noobs don't even deserve to beta for starcraft 2. they fucking suck so badly.
,esp724,2010-02-19T10:21Z,"Whenever someone plays online who has an actual key, what about the maps? Like ones that are downloaded from blizz's servers, where do those go? And couldn't we use those? Or does that have the same issue about encryptions and stuff?"
,nubpiratee,2010-02-19T10:27Z,"Guys, I appreciate the progress, you guys are doing a terrific job, but lets be honest here, getting the replays viewed isnt exactly progress towards playing the beta.."

,YakZSmelk220,2010-02-19T10:28Z,"@nubpiratee

Actually it is, if you've been reading it's believed that the map files may be somewhere in the replays, so... "
,Moosah,2010-02-19T10:31Z,"@nubpiratee 

I would disagree.. The replays are basically the game/engine running, you just aren't in control of it.
I'm guessing it's now just a case of finding the map files that must be hidden in there somewhere and getting them to show up in the custom game map list.."

Sorry for replying late but I've been watching all the replays in my folder...

My pc is actually like a 4-5 year old comp with a few upgrades:

Pentium 4 3.0 Processor
4Gb Ram
XP SP3
Geforce 9400GT

...think thats all taht matters right?

ive got an audio card as well but its old and i cant even remember what its called



@nubpiratee

-yesterday only invited people could even get into the beta
-then the client was made for download
-these smarty kids learned how to bypass the login screen and get into the main menu w.out connecting to bnet
-now we're able to go in-engine


..how is this not progress?"

..forgot my gfx settings in-game:

Mostly Med settings at 1680x1050 res

I'm still tinkering with the settings to get it looking the most cost-effective prettyness...

I noticed it takes a replay or 2 to optimize and get it running smooth after u mess with certain settings, but as long as u get the game to run (even at low settings) it still looks beautiful, esp compared to SC1 n sprites lol"

,YimYimYimi,2010-02-19T11:50Z,"@Moosah In the replays? Not for me. Maybe it's just a beta thing and it was giving them problems, so they just took it out before the Beta was released. I'm sure it'll be in the full game. Although, with people like the guys we have around here, I'm sure they could fix it lol. It's just a minor thing and once we can actually play it, nobody will be watching replays anyways."

,btcs,2010-02-19T14:44Z,The problem isn't getting the map files. It's getting the game to load the list of maps. So far the file responsible for this hasn't been found. Some are even speculating that the list is populated via b.net. In order to create a solo game there needs to be a list of maps to choose. I believe this has been the current obstacle for the last several hours.

,Pirat3Lov3r,2010-02-19T15:30Z,"@ past few comments
i've heard that SC2 goes to b.net and asks for a list of maps. if this does indeed happen then having the maps in the cache already makes things significantly easier. in theory, we could have SC2 ask for the maps, have an emulated server point to the maps in the cache and send the data back to SC2. this could also possibly lead to custom maps in the beta (if someone has a map editor)"

Here are some statistics on computer specs. so far sc2 beta is a pretty hounding game, and demands some pretty high end computer gear to run at full capacity. as for me i have fairly new computer. Windows vista Sp2,intel celeron cpu 2.0 ghz 2gb of ram, whioc are just the basics and can only run with all setting at low, with shader and lighting at meduim with no lag at all. any higher and things get choppy. the thing about sc2 is that to get around pressuring your cpu it puts all the work onto your gpu which is different. all in all you will need an ok gpu and meet all system requirent to play game with med settings mayb high. but will need high end machinery to play any higher."

,jonyah,2010-02-19T19:51Z,"sorry to bust your bubble 2weak, but that's not a fairly high end computer, and it never was.  The celeron is a horrible cpu, esp for gaming, and at 2.0 ghz, it's pretty slow.  2gb is nothing for ram these days and based on that, you probably have an integrated graphics card, or one that's not worth much.   those are ""new"" specs for a low end computer a couple of years ago.  

my computer is 3 years old now, but much faster than that because i continually upgrade it.  8gb ram, 1gb ati 4850 video, etc and I'm running everything at 1900x1080 at the highest settings no problem.  my cpu hasn't been upgraded in 3 years, but it still handles this game without any issues."

if you read my comment properly you would notice i never stated i had a high end computer, mine is actually not even meant for gaming, and i bought it 1 year ago and it was a few months old even then. what i said was that on a crappy computer like mine i was still able to run it smothly a little above low setting, thus meaning no one else should really have any spec problems running the game, but if you want to see better results i recomend a better computer."

its ok, people make mistakes, i actually said i had a fairly new computer, not fairly high end.

@trusk
restarting the beta itself would take a while if your up to it sure, and the problem you have seems more like a misplaced file or missing gui.
you can redownload the beta for a clean install and carefully go threw instructions or you could just replace the files you downloaded with a redownloaded file from the site. also did you use mpq editor to make changes in battle.net.mpq like posted on the site??"

also i have done some things with the details and gui, and i am now able to run my system on ultra also, the only thing that isnt on full is the shader which is on low, it says that it will cause game to stutter for a few games as shader adjust, but the lag am getting makes the game unwatchable, is anyone else experiencing this also is so or if not tell me your system specs."

cant really say right now, it will most likely be done by today.

@trusk
your problem is very unique, your system seems to be compatible, am assuming you have pixel shader 2.0, this might help. go into the sc2 beta folder and copy all the file from the sopprt foolder and poaste them into the version/base##### folder, this should help, if not make sure you have changed the battlenet.mpq in the battle.net folder properly and placed the authentication.gfx that use to be mainui.gfx in the corresponding folder, posted in the site in the correct order. it should be battle.net/SWF/AUTHENTICATION/AUTHENTICATION.gfz(if you dont see these folders make them yourself)"

,anthony9000,2010-02-19T23:51Z,@2weak So what do you think is the est. completion time for the beta to be playable in some form against the ai (or a human player)? Hopefully by the end of the weekend right?
,2weak,2010-02-19T23:51Z,"@nossah
good news and bad news, at this rate we will have single player done by tonight, bad news private servers going to take a while(2-3days at most)."
,Novver,2010-02-19T23:53Z,"jesus i cant believe it, i just got an email that i got into the beta, if you need any files , write a comment"
,Pirat3Lov3r,2010-02-19T23:53Z,"@2weak
i can haz single player domination of AI all night tonight possibly?!?!! "
,anthony9000,2010-02-19T23:53Z,oh and great work so far btw.

,YakZSmelk220,2010-02-19T23:57Z,"@esp724

It's probably better to keep this to a minimum, Facebook is great and all but I'd much rather try the game then have a Facebook page that leads to these guys needing to shutdown or cutting communication with us. :\"
,Eternus,2010-02-19T23:57Z,Novver what they need is an account to log into to actually get ahold of somebody at the IRC channel
,Schrip,2010-02-19T23:58Z,"Lol, I dont care HOW I play it, or WHO I play, I just REALLY want to play! Keep going at it guys! We're all depending on you! No pressure :P"
,anthony9000,2010-02-20T00:01Z,"If you guys really can get this playable by tonight, you're all amazing :D"
,NoNic2,2010-02-20T00:02Z,"skirmish would be perfect, imho private servers can happily wait couple of days untill we get a hang of interface,units, build orders..."
,2weak,2010-02-20T00:03Z,"@everyone
let me get this clear, if you are lucky enough to have a beta or a key then use it, it is my understanding that we already have a working key although the user with it isnt always online, if it turns out we need it i will msg you on here, and you  can report over to mIRC to hand it over, but really dude, dont be so amped up about handing away your beta key, we have made a great amount of progress with out one"
,wesleathy,2010-02-20T00:04Z,You're gonna do it till tonight? Fellas you've gone far beyond any of my expectations.

i just got done talking to r9k he said we need it, posting convo at bottom.
to give it to them download mIRC, go to server named rizon, server named sc2c, once inside send a i will add you to me and r9k's convo and you could tell him yourself. he is taking time away from programming to see this. comment back when your rdy
 well i wanted to know if this coudl speed up the proccess,i told him i would it could help out before because i thought we still needed a beta key for a clean login onto the bnet account. is the key still neccesary??
 Yes we still need one, the guys told me we still need it to get packets from the auth part
 okay i will tell him. give me a few minutes"

BUT, my mate did got it, so i will tell him to hook up with you guys, and give any necessary files, i will forward the messages and provide him with the necessary info to get up in your irc

,Dougz_G,2010-02-20T00:32Z,"@2weak
you're making yourself sound really bad there, building peoples hopes up to get a crack then asking for a beta key? sounds like a scam to me, i doubt anyone would risk giving their key away, maybe sharing files from their folders once played but other than that you're living in a dream world mate."
,2weak,2010-02-20T00:33Z,"@novver
hmm, well i have talked it over with r9k and when he does get on the mIRC r9k said they will send him an invite to join the dev channel, which as you know is now closed to the public due to spamming. 
the faster he gets on the faster we can finish this thing"
,Mederp,2010-02-20T00:35Z,"Yo 2 weak i have like 3 torrent accounts, if you want when it's finished u can e-mail a copy to me and i can submit it to Piratebay and Demonoid."
,2weak,2010-02-20T00:36Z,"@doug_z
lol, did you just get on this, everyone here already knows how much progress we have made with the crack because they have recieved instuctions on how to get past the log in screen and how to view replays from the beta. also we didnt ask for there key, they are offering and personally since on not working on the bnet private server i dont know if r9k needs hes key. am sure he could have him dl a prewritten code from the site which he could download and give us the results or he could upload some of the files we need, either way its all his choice, were gonna get this thing done 1 way or another"
,Mederp,2010-02-20T00:38Z,Yeah fuck off Doug_z.

funny, you're sticking up for 2weak but if you actually had a key you wouldn't risk it, just trying to look out for people and then get trash talked, this 2weak is a complete stranger who from a previous post says he's just a messenger updating us with news, if you wanna risk losing a key go ahead."

,2weak,2010-02-20T01:00Z,"@doug_z
look its obvious that you havent seen anything that we have done, and are not farmilar with what we are doing, i have been invited into the dev irc channel which am sure who have not, also as i have said countless times we dont need the key, we merely need your cooperation. if you had actually read any of my posts i have said multiple times not to give away your key to random people, not to get amped up in our process or anything like that, all we need is a little cooperation and it is people like you who are mainly slowing us down"

,2weak,2010-02-20T01:02Z,"@everyone
Eternal is right, from now on lets try not to feed the trolls. because thats why they came in the first place, they need attention, people are them is why we had to close our public irc channel and make it invite only and why we have been slowed down so much. with all there flamming, spamming, and all around trolling"
,anthony9000,2010-02-20T01:02Z,@2weak So sometime before midnight we should be able to play against bots? Which ai difficulty? And which maps?

like i said we are at a stand still, and have been slowed by spammers, to the point were we closed our public channel and now have invites only.

as a coutesy i am posting the live stream site for people who dont know how to use mIRC. although this is the not our dev channel which is now private, some information about our updates may come here. you may need to refresh to get newer post.---http://00.dy.fi/sc2c.php"

,2weak,2010-02-20T01:19Z,"@D1SCON
we know that the AI is there, and we also know that there are pieces of the single player in the beta, we are hoping we can extract it and use it somehow. also the AI is incredibly easy and that process is almost done, we have to wait until novvers friend arrive to get working on the private server,"
,Dougz_G,2010-02-20T01:21Z,"@2weak
I've been here since the start, i was just stating that you made yourself look bad by first posting ""use your keys, we don't need them"" then a few messages later you say ""you do, give it to us in mirc"" i may have been bold but people these days go to extreme lengths to scam, even sending out fake blizzard emails..i am very great full for what the hackers (or whateva you call them) are doing, i am aware of what they have done so far and have been watching replays, just gotta be careful is all i was saying.."
,Mederp,2010-02-20T01:21Z,So in a few hours we will be able to skirmish with AI?
,2weak,2010-02-20T01:21Z,"@hxndancer
so far that is the only thing we have done, we have made some progress on making a skirmish with ai and are trying to set up a privte eumlated bnet server but due to flammer, spammer, lack or beta key or anyone with one that could help us, we have been sereverly slowed down, as you may notice the dev channel was moved and is now a private invite only channel..."
,sc2,2010-02-20T01:22Z,what's been done here with the replays should had been what blizz had provided us already. to all. and pick up the cracking from there :D

you correct it would be simple to put up a bot, and it would be grand but you seem to be forgeting that we have been chased from our own public channel, it was all free to u guys and flamer had to ruin it, and as punishment we made our channel private, am sry it effected you guys but for now we like the silence. also giving a bot we feel would only encourage flamers making, but like i said am not the leader and the decision isnt mine to make."

great news guys, after tons of crap i have finnaly found out the problem with the play as guest.
go to our site and dl the new battlenet.gfx, you put it in sc2beta/battle.net(the same folder as the SWF) then from here after deleting the SWF file you laucnh beta and you have the play as guest button but its not working, i have realised you need to move the authentication.gfx inside of the SWF/AUTHENTICATION folder back into the same spot you got it from(inside of battlenet.mpq(use mpq editor)/SWF...inside this folder), then rename it Mainui.gfx and the play as guest button shoul;d work"

Not to get off to topic I saw your posting earlier an you did help a lot of people in need and I do say you do help people.

,2weak,2010-02-20T06:57Z,"@guys having problem with play as guest
download the file from the site where it says tutorials the very to where it says get to full game menu and that is what you use.

also i already answered that question please refer to past posts dude, if guest button isnt working, make sure you have the right file, if you click on it and it goes threw but the lay out dissapears and all you see it the backgroud with the battle cruiser flying, then get the swf folder you deleted(better hope you didnt empty you recycle bin) go into it and find the authentication.gfx and move it back where you got it(from inside the battlenet.mpq inside of it, battlenet/swf. you need to use mpq editor to get inside) once you put it inside change the name back to Mainui.gfx and it should work"

yea but we still don't officially have the maps... they're somehow spread throughout the cache files but not in our maps folder... so even if you could create the game you technically couldn't get in it w.out the maps... i think lol"

,Synesthete,2010-02-20T16:52Z,"Here's what I gathered when I tried to log in...

Without an SC2 code attached to your battle.net account, it won't let you log in.

Bypassing the login screen gets you there but doesn't give you access to their servers.

Without access, you get no maps.

Without maps, you can't play.

So...really it either comes down to either emulating a server for us pirates or finding a keygen for the beta codes...No way around it as far as I can see.

Except maybe tricking battle.net into thinking you DO have a beta code...that requires a lot of finesse, though."
,Bedervet,2010-02-20T16:56Z,"@synesthete I disagree with you:

The list send by b net activate is used somewhere in the programm, if the Devs can find out all check up of this list, authentication from b net, control of map name and path, the can create their own list to tricks the game that he has retrieved the list from b net."
,Pirat3Lov3r,2010-02-20T16:59Z,"a keygen is out of the question because of how few beta keys there are. b.net server emulation is the way to go. the only problem is that we don't have that maplist that your talking about. not only do we not have it, we don't know the format that its in. then after we manage to get the format (possibly build our own maplist) then we have to get the AI straightened out. "
,xxgen,2010-02-20T17:01Z,"@Synesthete


you are making some good points however there is a way around it. What I think the dev's at this point in time can only do is to make a privet server like you said to ""emulate"" battle net or they if they could get their hands onto the files then they could make a ""atch"" or file that would think that the server was connected to it to play AI with you

,Synesthete,2010-02-20T17:09Z,"I suppose it's possible to fool the game into thinking you have an SC2 beta key attached to your battle.net account, since it checks with battle.net and not the other way around like most games.

for those talking about keys, it is true. we do face an issue thanks to warden that if an altered.dll log into the bnet server it will be flagged and then banned later on. we are trying to conserve our keys at this time, but we are still working.

I actually wouldn't mind playing by myself and getting used to the tech tree and abilities.

actually its a mental disorder you jackass. some may just be ""socially akward"" but are unbelievably smart.

is it possible for you to release the crack with the ""dead"" AI?  i would still very much enjoy just making and killing my own units LOL

Like a replay without the game. See previous page to confirm ..."

Have you set the in-game resolution to 1024x768? I have an old laptop that barely meets some of the minimum requirements but replays run quite smooth on low settings and 1024x768 resolution. Other than that i don't know what to say, though I'm no computer expert I usually game on consoles!"

Rumors started when the announcement was made a 1 and a half year ago, or so, and until now blizz has not denied this + no lan support, dare i say again Acti+blizz= Love (money love that is)

First they are not hacking battle.net. they are making emulator that you will run on your computer or some server and amek game thimk that its conected to actual battle net

I will buy an external hard drive soon so that I can backup my system before partitioning it for Boot Camp + Windows 7, which might make the game smooth on this iMac8,1.

Okay people who say it is uncrackable you are somewhat right. You are right in the matter that they cannot crack the battle net servers. However if they spent enough time on it they could however there would be no point in doing so because blizzard would patch it right over

What I understand what the dev team is doing is trying to find out what is triggering a match to start, what is triggering the cpu to move and give out commands to its units. If they ended up needing battle net then they would make a priovet server witch they might do anyway so we can play against eachother

I am totally against people saying it is totally uncrackable I know they will crack it. I don't know exactly when. But think for a moment these hackers are spending their time and helping us out so we can finally play the game. Instead of spending 350$ off ebay getting keys hmmm. If worst comes to worst and they cannot crack it then quite possible in the incoming waves of keys you got get your hands on one."

@MiCrOMaN1 

Why come here worrying about people argueing?  Just crack it and everyone will be your friend again.  I heard that reverse engineering is stuck on blizzard's way of authenticating local resources. To go anywhere from here, the reverse engineering team needs to emulate the server-side code that generates cache indexes, which is probably not going to be doable any time soon. The consensus is we are with 99.9% certainty not going to have an emulator for the beta. Thanks for trying though.

,greymann,2010-02-21T20:01Z,"@daidv  Replays were fun. Then you realize it's just the old SC2 on the old WC3 engine.  I mean fuck, what other blizzard sequel had this little innovation over the previous game?  War3 gave us rpg elements like heroes, etc and a 3d engine.  Diablo 2 with all the classes and mad new gameplay and features like the cube.  This is gay.  The same 3 races, few new units... only it's harder to crack and they're selling it in 3 parts.  People must be getting real stupid out there to put up with this.  Starcraft 1 with 3d for e-sport fags. 

Sys requirements? NO, just because you can run war3 DOES NOT mean you can run this game.  People talk shit without even seeing the game run.  This has a lot more graphics effects, units and so on going on on screen.  My new rig sees glitches that my 5-year-old one never saw with War3."

,Moustachio,2010-02-21T20:34Z,"@FCisco @greymann
Same shitty graphic? Guys, it's Beta we're talking about, if you go back on comments you'll see that AA will be available in the full game and if you still think it's just like W3, look a little closer. I'm not even talking about effects. Regarding the units, I must confess I got disapointed too, come on, 2 or 3 units more for each race comparing to the total units number in the old game? That is a really poor work and don't get your hopes up to be seeing something new in the full game, since the purpose of Beta is balancing. Still, I really can't wait to play this game, being it the Beta (hopefully. Thank you devs, keep it up please.) or the full game when it (finally) comes out.

About the thought that it's impossible to crack... Do you guys really think that Blizzard, a company with visible success and more than 15 years of existance, has the illusion that no one would crack their Beta? Do you really think they're so naive, as to think their dev team is the best in the whole world? Don't be fooled people, I even dare to say the dev team that is right now trying to crack this game, will be receiving invites, not for Beta testing, but for game developing at Blizzard when they succeed.

but you know, to be honest, your one of those people where if it still wasnt happening, you would just be bitching about it NOT being out yet, and if you want things to be made changes so bad, then get a goddamn job at blizzard and MAKE changes. im happy with this, if i had a problem, or an idea i WOULD send it in rather than just bitching and doing nothing at all.

how would it be starcraft then? because it had the name.

LOOK at ALL the units, they are almost ALL new, the probes dont even look the same, many units DONT even look the same, something is added, they are a larger, or smaller scale, different health, different in the way you use them, this game and everything is COMPLETELY NEW but just with new names, its like naming your child after you, its the same name and it may look similar but its completely different."

I think its good they downgraded the mothership to a support unit, because it looked a little too powerful in the original gamepaly video. i mean, killing everything on ground and air in a matter of seconds can't be inserted into such a balanced game. 

On the other hand, i think they modified the game just enough. I mean, sure, there isnt another race and they only changed a few units, but you have to think about the map editor too. I mean its capable of some crazy shit, and when it gets into the hands of the modding and map  making community, itll be crazy."

true, also, if its like the WC3 editor, people can MAKE their own spells and abilities, so im sure we WILL see it eventually LOL

but yes i do see where your coming from, maybe make it availiable through custom game or suthing idk"
,Moustachio,2010-02-21T21:32Z,"@greymann
Now I'll have to give you some bad news, bro. It's just because of the competitive aspect of the game that they sacrificed lots of new units, so they could balance the game accurately. In fact, that's the only reason that keeps them from launching the game right away, they need to be sure that it will become a good e-sport with the three races fine tuned and well balanced. Does that kill the casual players expectations? Hell yeah (I am a casual player), but saddly, Korea's number one entertainment is the competitive SC 1, so guess what? A well balanced new sequel to the game gives Blizzard A LOT of money in the competitive scenary."
,HakimOptikal,2010-02-21T21:37Z,"You guys know how the Beta replays don't have music audio? Well i searched it up and the music files for replays are here http://darkblizz.org/Forum/index.php?topic=479.0
The only problem i now face is where to put the .Ogg files (sound files) in order to hear the music while playing??? thanks for any help"
,wesleathy,2010-02-21T21:44Z,To expand a little bit. Usmc said it might be a key to unlocking a hidden menu that would allow skirmish to be played using local AI. 
,daidv,2010-02-21T21:45Z,"Sigh...  I wonder why people load up The Pirate Bay, search for a StarCraft 2 Beta torrent, and proceed to bash the game.

I thought people searched for torrents to download something they wanted..."

Stop asking questions. You're only slowing things down. You'll know when it comes out, so just check back periodically and stop making things take longer. This is what I recommend."

Actually, I've checking constantly for 2weaks response. I told him to come on my channel, but it seems that he doesnt know it, and If I list it here, Then people are goiing to raise havoc on the rizon servers.

And since so much havoc just got raised on the forums, I can't tell you guys anything, because then you'll cause even more havoc.

I told you guys, that we have a UI that should patch Starcraft 2. On the forums? 500+, Servers Overloaded, Traffic high...

What do you want me to do? I can't do anything without over 500 people criticizing me for telling you the wrong information. I can't even talk to 2weaks dev since I join his channel, there are over 1000+ people there. We can't even have a sensible talk without someone spamming and flaming comments."

,Brockrock,2010-02-22T02:37Z,"@Noodelz

You have taken what I said totally out of context, with hopes to start an argument.  Calm down bud.  I told you to tell the people on IRC to stop spamming and asking a shit load of questions.  You assume, that by telling spammers to stop spamming, the dev's will stop working?  Nobody gives a shit about what you have to say, I have been in your chat quite a few times and it is just a mashup of randoms talking about STD's and their cocks.  How about you go deal with that?

@Everyone

Keep asking questions! How else are you supposed to attain this information?  Why are we on this gigantic forum if not to ask questions?  Everyone here is curious about the SC2 crack, so questions are natural.  Don't let tool's like noodelz tell you whats what."
,X_Zabot_X,2010-02-22T02:37Z,"@brockrock

i agree, if why are you posting here if your talking to them? i think you are just feel dumb cuz brock called you out on an obvious mistake.  
and ALSO, he is right, the people here arent slowing ANYONE down, they dont check and answer every single question here, they dont check back every second and go ""damnit someone asked another question"" and when they do its normally like 1 or 2 sentances, thats like 5 minutes, so after all this they maybe have lost like an hour MAYBE.

they have ways of talking to each other and working together.  the people here arent really doing anything, if you look they send updates periodically.  and sometimes they say, nothing new and thats it. 

hey brock, i think its time to press our ""That was Easy"" buttons"

The ?Microman pic? was just a prototype of a GUI of a possible crack user interface. It is not a crack.

The Developers are focusing primarily on emulating b.net verification process for functioning maplist for gamelaunch vs AI. NO ETA, so please don't ask for it.

by MiCrOMaN1 ""Opening the maps is an easy function, just a little script. But the only most difficult part is re-replacing the swf. There is no problem for the AI, because as soon as you open a map, you can put your opponents as computers.

Perhaps the playable maps are stored in a different folder than the cache folder.

This option will most likely be available in the full version of the game. Since they are testing gameplay all around the world AND the new B.Net, there is no point in having a lan option in the Beta"

????the definition of an open beta is a beta that is ""open"" to everyone and anyone

he def of a closed beta is a beta that is only given to a certain select individuals to test.

since a very high majority of the public cannot play the beta and the fact the blizz announced themselves it is a closed beta, i can assume it is a closed beta "

In fact, in my first comment on page 96 I linked their wiki and told people that that is the place to find the real information. Instead you have the 2 loudest people here, who if we added up their comments would probably have a shockingly high % of the ~2500 total, conveniently placing ""we"" in the sentence to make it sound like they are actually doing something. You guys have obviously spent more time on TPB than doing any sort of cracking and are just looking for a pat on the back. They are just taking credit for others' work and providing bad information in the process. But yea, I guess I'm an ass for calling them out.

I have been following this comment section for days. I haven't responded until today. I have never pumped anybody up here.

Look, even if he is lying, I really couldn't care less. As long as the beta crack gets reported here it's no skin off my nose. However, making condescending proclamations and accusations turns the comment section into a flame war and creates a lot of animosity. It is not worth it AT ALL.  

Do you get some sort of ego-gratification from ""calling people out""? My point is, it's not progressive. If indeed he is lying and has no part in the process, at least he is reporting on progress. If he is lying, just let him have his delusion. As long as it doesn't have a negative impact on the progress of the crack, people are free to believe in whatever they want -- whether it's the flying spaghetti monster or that they are the lead programmer for the SC 2 beta crack.

,the.truth,2010-02-23T02:07Z,"@italianmafia23
I understand. I have as well. However, for days I have watched these two monkeys parade around on here feeding everyone mis-information. I call them out for not being real devs because they are here spamming shit about it coming out ""tonight"" (this is 2weak saying this about 2-3 days ago) and microman saying how it is almost there. These guys have either 0 or next to 0 part to play in this yet want to lead you to believe that they do.

I do not get any ego gratification for calling anybody out. Do you get ego gratification for writing posts like ""HE OWES YOU NOTHING"" etc? My entire original post was accusing these two nitwits of providing misinformation and posing as someone who is working on a team developing a crack. There is no need to listen to them. I gave a link to where to find the latest real information and that link is mirrored in the description of this torrent. Listening to 2weak or microman is a waste of everyone's time because they don't have a clue.

Read the thread since I posted and tell me how I am trying to start a flame war. I'm not the one writing posts about masturbating with a noose around my neck or whatever other trash these crazy kids come up with.

Here is one, go to the most up to date wiki (botdev.org/doku.php), click the link to the IRC chat log and search for microman.

here is what you will get:

,greymann,2010-02-23T03:52Z,"SC2 PREVIEW (for veteran blizz fans)

It looks like a nice, clean, polished starcraft experience for players--especially fans--who just want a no-nonesense e-sport game. What other blizzard sequel though has had this little innovation?: same 3 races, few new units, continuation of storyline on the wc3 engine (and harder to crack!). Think of the difference between war2 and war3 then the huge leap to wow. Or the difference between diablo 1 and 2. The only innovation (and one that blizzard plays up hard) is the new bnet which is mainly just responsible for taking away LAN and offering further services to charge for. Then there's the the vast amount of time between the sc1 and 2 and splitting it into 3 ridiculas parts. It just smells of wow-dominance marketing and a huge generation of players who require less of a developer. Those of us who loved the old blizzard and have long ago gotten tired of wow are out in the cold for good I think."

@chickennoddle

sure he may have referred to as we doing something. this could include the entirety of everyone working on the crack. if i said ""OMG WE HAVE A CRACK"" would you blame me for telling the entire community that we have access to a working crack? its the same thing. don't be flaming 2weak or anyone else. and btw. yes you are the retard who asks for updates every 5 minutes. and no we dont have an ETA. shut up or gtfo. thanks, and have a nice day."

here is the progress so far.-- I think some basic documentation should be laid out here, so just to clarify, you guys are working on: A) Finding some way to not automatically load the MP UI so you can play an MP skirmish and B) Finding a workaround for the anti debugging technology so you can get a proper dump of the DLL image so that you can get a better impression of battle.net.dll -- Lograts"

Microman1 is not a scammer. Other people have been posting with similar names as him to try to scam people out of keys. He is actually working on a crack, though it seems like progress is slow if at all.

His only real crime is being way too optimistic in terms of the work needed to make a crack. He should serve as the number 1 cautionary tale as to why dev teams don't like ETA dates. REing a game is a very finicky process and any ETA dates or status reports are likley to be false. "

i know i said i wouldnt post here anymore but i wanted to make some clearifications for those who cares. first off do not trust anyone who post here claiming to have a crack or need you key because they are likly spammers trying to steal you key, whether they are 2vveak 2waek or 2veak or microman11 or micro man1 or microman, because they are fakes, also the twitter site has been discredited because of its childish behavior and its insults towards the developers, from here on you can go to  www.DarkBlizz.org(the forum site), http://botdev.org(for cracking tutorials), or irc rizon#scc2c for dev chat and irc rizon@sc2devwatch for muted channel(no spammers). also it would be great if you dont constantly ask for an eta or where we are at the time since it is very distracting, feel free to ask in the irc sc2c channel since it is unmuted and free to the public.

I still think they've done a great job leaking this, because I know what it is to work for a closed source environment, so great kudos to whomever did it.

There is no in-game music (except for the main menu) and the unit portraits are badly animated, but that's just a grunt. In all, it does feel like the original, and when you watch all the spectacular animations (such as a Mothership casting a Vortex), you get head blow off literally.

@spammers, flooders and bots set to prevent piracy - stfu & gtfo.

i hate it when people say that they dont expect a crack for atleast a month, you are drastically underestimating the devs, i would say at most it will take a month, atleast a week.

let me make this clear so people dont get the wrong impression and twist my words and throw them at me, i am guessing by the progress we have made in just 2 days and the job we still have to do that it may take about 1-2weaks to crack it, at most 1 month... this is in no way an exact date."

You don't need to enable no singleplayer, because unlike some morons here say, it's not even there yet. you can enable the button, but it's pointless because it doesn't lead nowhere.

a/p multiplayer, my guess is that you need to somehow extract the map to create your own game, then select the parameters and hit start. that is, of course, if you just want to see how it feels to play before jumping to playing with your fags.

why I think so? simple - look at how replays are played. all the structures, models, maps, everything is already there. you just need a way to access it, with no need for fucking bnet, server, etc. I dunno how to do it, I'm a total noob is scripting, but there just MUST be a way."

@2weak great work don't listen to these jerks who are saying your a faker and wasting their time hahaa... KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!

@everyone who thinks 2weak is not legit

Well let's look at the facts he was one of the first people to comment on this entire torrent/comment page/forum. He also redirected us to the wiki page witch helps us to be informed a little bit on the overall progress of the time. s/he also seems to have access into the IRC dev channel witch the devers/hackers are and he is I would like to call him the spokeman of them witch is very important. Because let me see you are reading these comments trying figure out the status of the Crack arn't we all I am one of those people. However there is no need to ask 2weak or microman (don't know him) will keep you informed. If you got a problem with those 2 give me your IP address and you will have a deadly worm on your computer the following morning that will earas your entire hard drive try it te hehehe. =^.^=

,Shadiac,2010-02-25T07:55Z,"Ok, so to sum everything up, there are only two more or less rightous ways to play the game:

1) Hack/troj/bruteforce whatever someone's bnet account and get a legit working beta key (or ask nicely for one, or cope and buy one, etc etc) and enter it like all the normal people do, then create copies of it and distrib (questions and license agreement - http://forums.battle.net/thread.html?topicId=23094049320&sid=5000)

OR

2) Emulate a private server that the launcher would respond to as Bnet. For this we need a juggernaut PC (sysreq specs here - http://forums.battle.net/thread.html?topicId=23308410974&sid=5000) to run a serv on and evetually let ppl in for both player vs player and player vs ai games.

Since there is no team as such, and many of the current dwellers are prone to go ""well fuck y'all"" upon the probability of receiving a beta key, instead of actually sharing one, I say the second option is better. Sure, it would take a month indubtedly to set up such a server and stabilize it, but at least it would look like real ppl done real shit to play the game, not some schoolbois from kindergarden sharing a beta key like a pot joint.

I won't write here anymore because this is speculation that actually attracts Blizz team (REAL team, not spammos) members and while they laugh at us right now (selling keys is pathetic but legal), this whole shit would surely be torn down if they found at least one single key circling around. I also suggest you go easy on the links because this is a closed beta forum and if they sense slashdot they will come here and track you down. And then fuck with the Wiki.

Go to the darkblizz forums if you want to help or read about the future decisions on how this will be cracked. I will.

@everyone

Same question as before.  I think it's a matter of having the files from a registered copy in order to play offline.  I'm just wondering if anyone has even tried it.  It would be simple: a person who has played a few times on the original b.net would just need to upload the files from his SC2 folder.  It should at least allow people to play vs. AI.

The b.net emulation is going to take much longer.  This would be something for the meantime."

its not as simple as that since some part not all but some part of the maps are hidden in files which have recently been found, but the game will not use or run the maps without permission from the bnet so right now we are trying to emulate a bnet server that will tell the game to use the maps."

Thanks for the reply.

What if we just took all of the files from the SC2-related directories from a computer that has an authenticated SC2 copy, that is, one that has already gotten that permission from b.net.  Then, as far as our computers will know, we will have that permission too, because all of the files will be carbon copies.  The only other possible consideration would be the registry, but that couldn't be too hard to figure out, again, if we simply looked at the registry from a computer that has been using a valid key.

My idea is just to get all of the same files as a person who has already gone through the authentication, and then play the game in offline ""play as guest"" mode.  The computer won't be checking in again with b.net, so the local software won't know the difference.

I also read that the authentication comes with unique system specs.  In that case, we could find a way to edit that code, or even just have another piece of software to trick the program into thinking that we have the same hardware as was signed in the authentication."

I like your enthusiasm mate, however, there are already some pretty big brains working on two possible solutions.
In case the following pharagraph COMPLETELY makes sense you could head over to the wiki (http://botdev.org/doku.php) or irc channel (http://00.dy.fi/sc2c.php) to help, if not your only option is to wait and hope :)

""When SC2 is launched, it loads BNETDLL. BNETDLL spawns six threads in the process.

BNETDLL creates a filemap (Size is 0x100 and flags PAGE_READWRITE) with a seemingly random name followed by SC2's PID (IE. DSIOHKNAQPRGBAS103, 103 is the PID displayed in decimal). Once it has been created it will map it with MapViewOfFile (Access mode: FILE_MAP_ALL_ACCESS and MapSize = 0x100). Once that has been done it will fill the filemap with some information. So far I've only been able to understand some of them. 
One of the threads created by BNETDLL spawns the child process SC2_CHILD using CreateProcessW. The child process receives the filemap name as it's command line argument. The dwCreationFlags for this process are DEBUG_PROCESS|CREATE_SUSPENDED|DETACH_PROCESS.

Once BNETDLL has created SC2_CHILD it starts to decrypt a second debugger. Once it has been decrypted it uses WriteProcessMemory to overwrite the second SC2.exe copy with this second debugger.

every time you log on sc2 get permission from bnet and loses it when you log off, so it will not be as sinple as copy and paste, some of the interior files must be changed

the reason people with keys dont see play as guest is because it was disabled, blizz made the game but will testing it themselves and playing they didnt want to log in all over again and deal with bnet so they created an offline mode(play as guest) and after the ui was complete they not only disabled play as guest but all other ui so if a hacker was to get past the log in they still couldnt play.

Nothing disappoints me more than seeing a greedy pig corporation aiding only those who are ""qualified.""

This is starcraft. To anyone that thinks that this game won't be cracked: you're wrong. This is the game that was and will continue to be famous across the globe. This means that the entire globe will try to crack it, and they will succeed. Give it a week to a month, you'll have your starcraft 2 beta. Give it a week after the full retail version is out, and you'll have the game for good without paying a cent.

Screw you blizzard."

hmm some people dont undestand what a beta is, right now the game isnt finished and is still subject to change, the proccess that goes into making a game is developing, the alpha testing to test the game, then beta testing the secondary testing of the game, then after that they make finishing touches to the game. then they put out a release date for the game and inbetween the that time they release a demo alowwing you to get a feel,

there is no point in making the beta a demo since the game isnt even finished yet, and since its not done yet it most likely has alot of quarks and bugs that need to be fixed and they dont want an unfinished product to represent them since a demo is supposed to be a taste of what your going to get."
,2weak,2010-02-26T00:56Z,"@weezy
there is a difference between saying you we did not put a single player in the beta, and there is not a single trace element of single player in the game. which we have already proved to be false, since the single player has been unlocked and the skirmish screen has been seen.

do not jump to conclussions this in no way saying that there is a single player and doesnt say there isnt, i am sinply stating what has been found and that anything is possible."

Here is how we can help - IF you beta tester with legit key -
run traffic capture (manual is here http://darkblizz.org/Forum2/index.php?topic=526.0)
Load map or multiple maps and select only AI as opponent - keep traffic capture running in the background.

Try loading more maps to see if there's traffic change or pattern.

 HERE IS DISCUSSION WITH MADCATX  WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP DONATION CAMPAIGN OF TOTAL GOAL $300 TO BUY BETA KEY FOR MADCATX ON E-BAY !!! PLEASE SEE IF YOU DECIDE TO GET INVOLVED


  Sorry if i bug you MADCATX, Can you explain if possible, how capture with authenticated information would help? I'm just curios, if that will be efficient information to emulate BAttle.net server, or there must be custom API to be written or such in order to emulate ? As far as i understand Blizzards side server currently ""hosting"" maps and synchronize players in the game ? How in this case capture authentication traffic would help ? Which kind of traffic is expected to be captured and what needs to be performed? Reason i'm asking is We should educate masses and have them do it without risk of them loosing their keys - everyone is suspicious about their authentication data.  Please share your mind with us. Thank you !


First of all, if someone want to submit this data, they should change their password before doing so. It's not the only packets I ask, they should also load some map. Packets dumps will play some scenario of interacting with battle.net between client and server, that we can repeat. I don't know if there is some interaction between the client and server in the game it self with only one player presented. If there is, then it will be hard to repeat. Everything else can be done by repeating the packets scenario.
If someone cracked the battle.net.dll, and has data mined information about packet structures, then it will be more valuable then packets dumps."

"
,Shadiac,2010-02-26T07:29Z,"For those who want to play sc2:

1) Don't buy keys on eBay. These are all scams. Blizzard forbids Bnet users from selling their SC2 keys, there is a 2-3% chance that you'd fall on an honest person trying to sell it to you, but usually, they'll just sell you meaningless numbers that won't work if you enter them, and watch out for newly created accts because ppl will take your money and walk off with it.

2) This torrent is pretty much useless now that Blizz released a new patch for their beta (it's been a week anyway), so you can download it and install it, but if you run it will ask you to download the newer client and shut down. You won't be able to watch replays anymore thereafter, because old reps won't work and newer ones got protected by the dev team so they're all pretty much useless now.

3) The crack is a myth. I wrote earlier that DarkBlizz (look for their forum) was working on reading the dumped packets of a SC2 installer, but it turns out there is no answer since all the mpqs lead nowhere. Then someone brought up an idea of getting a key to log in so the original packets can be downloaded from a Bnet serv and installed. But as 1) says, the best key you'll get out there is a shut the fuck up and wait key, so... no much progress here either.

What they're currently doing is looking for a crack themselves, including some chinese haxors who actually succeeded in creating a singleplayer UI, but keep their info to themselves until razor1911 team will eventually distrib it. When this will happen? When pigs will fly, probably.

You can waste your time downloading it and playing it if you want, but my suggestion to you: wait until the game is released. There will be an open beta in early April through July, so maybe you'll get lucky and receive some keys by e-mail. There is also this year's e3 coming in June, with a patch of free keys to win there, so don't just sit and masturbate TPB for a crack, participate.

The game itself will probably hit the shelves by this year's Christmas, so sooner or later, you'll get it anyway. Even here. So stop whining, shitting at each other, and have some dignity not to go as low as pirating a motherfucking beta worth shit for weeks, Blizz is shitting bricks laughing behind your back when you do this. Don't believe me? Half of ppl who write comments here are part of their team."

the patch did not break the crack. some are saying that it messed up replays but i have not experienced that issue. the crack that the team has found is BECAUSE of the crack. in the video they even say ""thank you Blizzard for v14..."" so you should update for the crack (i'm sure there will be instructions)

So you condemn everyone?

I've been here since page 1, believe it or not. Sitting quietly, checking on progress. Never asking for progress, never spamming, never nagging.

lol dude your an idiot, i was talking to the guy a few pages back who had an arguement with me on how smart blizzard was and how it was impossible to crack it and how there wasnt even a singe player. i was telling him that i hope he enjoyed the crack and how he doesnt deserve to play it.

jump to concluisions all you want because its clear you obviously dont read comments."

btw you all probably already knew this but after i got pm'ed on irc i wanted to make this clear, me and microman11 are not affiliated he is using my name to spam keys

@yonsia
its funny how you said it all cool too, ""I've been here since page 1, believe it or not. Sitting quietly, checking on progress. Never asking for progress, never spamming, never nagging.""

lol, please havent condemded anyone, i just feel its wrong someone can critisize and bad mouth something every step of the way and still get the fruits of there labor."

,lazytownteam,2010-02-27T02:17Z,"Hey guys,

Thanks for the support. We're happy to have gotten this out there for everyone to enjoy. It took quite a few sleepless nights and energy drinks to get it together. I think we were quite successful if the volume of traffic our servers are getting hit with is any indication.

For anyone having trouble getting this figured out, here is a quick guide to getting everything set up:

-Download the client and install it to your computer.

-Download the torrent for the crack (this torrent).

-Download a Starcraft II map.

-Open the Battle.net folder, and create a folder called Cache. In the Cache folder, create another folder named after the first two digits of the filename of the map you downloaded. In that folder, create a folder named after the third and forth digits of the filename of the map you downloaded. Place the downloaded map in this folder.

-Open the ""lazylaunch"" program that you extracted from the compressed crack. When prompted, open the map you downloaded from the location you just placed it in. Click return to game and enjoy!

We're working on getting a version out that will allow you to play against AI in the next few days here. Also, we will be rolling out a multiplayer crack in a week or so.

We do need a couple of keys for our team to work with in order to both the AI and multiplayer crack running. If you have a key that you're willing to give up for the greater good, please send it to: lazytowndevs@hotmail.com

Thanks guys!"
,sc2ftww,2010-02-27T02:33Z,"wtf would you quit spamming already you fuckers! no one's gonna give you a fucking beta key, so shut the fuck up no lifers.

anyways, thanks a lot to the pro's that made the crack possible! its nice to be able to play the beta before the game is released, but what would be most appreciated would be a crack for the AI, or even LAN, so please keep us informed!"

So i put awodihawudh@paioejf.coj in the E-mail thingy and pressed connect. It told me i had an invalid version.

,greymann,2010-03-02T18:34Z,"Sequel my ass...

If you enjoyed the previous 3 then after the initial orgasm is over, due to the simple fact that a new blizz game is out, you WILL be disappointed, unless your long-term conscious and unconscious memory is shot.  

No other blizzard sequel has been this shallow and lacking in innovation not to mention what they're taking OUT of this one: same 3 races, no innovations (think of differences b/w war2 and war3), split into 3 parts!, no LAN, a basic patching in of blizz quality sound and graphics but nothing really impressive.  As a sequel it's 90 percent ""new bnet"" (wooptie do!) and continued story.  

So if you aren't familiar with the old blizzard games then have fun.  This is a great repackaging of those wonderful games.  The rest of us have been left out in the cold since wow but I don't think blizzard cares.  The real blizzard is gone and they've turned into a bunch of milkmaids, milking the new generation of gamers who are ignorant of what they missed in years past.  

It could be the first blizz game I don't buy.  Bnet will be a bunch of zerg rushing, exploiting, ridalin-riddled kids with too much spare time, who only care about stats (think the tragedy that is arenas).  If there's a campaign / LAN crack I'll probably at least download."
,VenomBHz,2010-03-02T19:01Z,"@greymann SC2 is not that bad... and blizzard did not abandon anybody...

Don't forget they are working on D3 too.

The only thing I don't like is that Blizzard is now thinking too much about profits... but you can think on the ""dividing the game in 3"" thing as the old expansions... the only difference is that they are divided by races..."

,ConverseAllStars,2010-05-11T04:18Z,Does this allow us to play with an AI?
,ConverseAllStars,2010-05-12T03:03Z,"I dled the torrent but when i install it. It never stops downloading the patches for some reason. When its almost done it just starts all over again any reasons why?

Get Starcrack. Dont just run the client if you dont have a beta key.

@jdmeister
Battle.net would be too laggy for me so I probably wont buy this game. Used to play Starcraft a lot on LAN though."
,somedude.1001,2010-05-12T09:54Z,"@ConverseAllStars
Get Starcrack, bro. Dont just run the client."
,somedude.1001,2010-05-12T09:59Z,"Sorry double posted, the comment didnt show up at first.

,ConverseAllStars,2010-05-12T21:42Z,Its still not working after i extracted the contents of both the zip files into my sc2 beta folder. I run the sc2 application/ .exe and then the it starts to install the patch and everything but that never stops it just keeps going non stop over and over again =(
,Mr.Orangeman,2010-05-13T14:14Z,"Dude,

You NEED to go to this website to get the latest crack updates and EVEYRTHING you would EVER need to play SC2.. It is freaking HOLY!!

,somedude.1001,2010-05-13T14:21Z,Sorry I forgot about the loader. Just look for sc2 AllInOne loader or lazy launcher.
,ConverseAllStars,2010-05-14T09:17Z,"@somedude 
Thxs i got it to work FINALLY!! don't believe im playing sc2 but its SICK!!!!! also Thxs sshalafi =)"
,razorscale2,2010-05-17T00:34Z,wat if it asks to add this game to a battle.net account and i dont have a 26- letter key
,Lucky13s,2010-05-19T08:00Z,"Build 13891 is highly outdated. You are like 5-6 patches behind, the game now is pretty different balancing-wise.

Also, the beta phase 1 ends May 31st, so I dunno how long you'll be able to use this. (Phase 2 will only let in a select few, then its launch!)

I personally have not downloaded this client because I have the beta, but yes you can play with AI. I should note that the AI so far is only ""Very Easy"", which does like nothing but build a small base and a few units every now and then. Its not really worth it if you want to play, but if you want a sneak peak at how the game was a 5-6 updates ago, give it a shot.

I can remember what it was like back then, the music was a little different, hydras kicked ass, void rays sucked, thors were massive and crappy, m/m/m (marine/marauder/medivac) kicked the shit outta everything (still kinda do but slower to get now), DTs were slow."
,finalresistance,2010-05-21T06:13Z,1.6mb/s DL. Nice! Good to see some people still know how to seed! Thanks for the up.
,somedude.1001,2010-05-21T07:33Z,"It seems like someone purposely delete all the torrents of the newer builds.

Ive seen 14xxx and 15xxx a few times and they were all gone the next day.

I think its unlikely that every single one of those wasnt legit, and extremely unlikely that noone has ever uploaded a legit, newer version of the best and most anticipated RTS in the last 12 yrs."

,paoktsis,2010-05-27T13:06Z,Hey guys can anyone tell me how to install it and play without battle.net account????
,somedude.1001,2010-06-02T09:12Z,"Its official, there will be no LAN play whatsoever, full stop.

I cant wait to see an emulated local bnet. As popular as this game is Im sure there will even be several.

Fuck Activision/Blizzard."

You can update this client and get the latest loaders at http://www.setupswarm.com/main/games/installation-guides/starcraft-ii-beta-recracked in case anyone is still looking for it!"

,newsletter,2010-06-27T21:32Z,"Started fine but it needs a login which I don't have, quick uninstall and delete."
