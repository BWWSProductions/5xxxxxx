People, this game is terrible, move along.

There are a ton of reasons why this game is bad. Most of the reasons aren't gameplay related, but BNET 2.0. It has to be the worst on-line platform I've ever fathom. Though there are many screw ups related to gameplay too, specially if you know SC1 enough (racial identities lost is the major problem, Zerg doesn't swarm, Protoss weaker HP-wise than Terran...)

I recommend everyone to pirate it on release to play SP and just wait a few weeks/months until iCCup or another private server supports it.



Also, if you really care about Blizzard/Sc2, I recommend you to 1-star it on Amazon (as soon as it's released) and complain in a civilized way. Unless many people does this, it looks like nothing will change.
