,VxxM,2010-02-20T17:08Z,"Dear FXG.... Why don't u  try mkv format...
i think it can reduce file size to approximatly 400 MB with HQ... It is very useful to low bandwidth people like US.... Thanks..."

,Houlala,2010-02-28T16:55Z,"Great job FXG team!
I agree with VxxM on the MKV format... However, it's always great to have the subtitles included in the torrent so that MKV could be made anyways!"

I didn't expect to enjoy this movie. I thought its

I like this movie, but the ending was abrupt. But you could've for-seen it."
,hmmhm,2010-04-04T11:30Z,"pathetic movie about how to fire people, destroy their lives and brag about family values and after all feel romantic
anyway thanks for the movie, I made an opinion about it."
,FailedSuicideAttempt-,2010-04-30T19:10Z,"TY FXG Team - Yours is one of the few names i look for when downloading movies. Too many times from the others ex. [this movie] the theatre rip has 4000+ seeders while the ACTUAL dvd rip has 1229 (at this point).  
As always quality rip, at DVD quality A & V are 9.5 thanks again."

,kissofd3th,2010-05-18T19:32Z,"@VxxM
mkv is a garbage format. if you are having trouble downloading it, you should probably upgrade your internet. I download 700 mb in like 15-20 mins. FXG, keep doing what you guys are doing."
,SnarfleSnarf,2010-05-28T00:21Z,"MKV, much like AVI, is a container format. Simply being a ""mkv"" or ""avi"" file does not affect what size the movie is - how the movie has been encoded does that.

The advantage MKV has over AVI is that it supports unlimited audio, video and subtitle layers/tracks (making it great for DVD rips). It's not nearly as widely supported as AVI however, especially with hardware players.... slowly slowly catchy monkey!"
,scum666,2010-06-07T20:17Z,Great movie.

,Scyrthis,2012-03-31T21:40Z,"@norsub, burn u fag, subtitles are just some annoying and disturbing shit in the movies..."
