Halo Legends is a collection of seven animated short films set in the Halo science-fiction universe. Financed by Halo franchise overseer 343 Industries, the stories were created by five Japanese production houses: Bones, Casio Entertainment, Production I.G., Studio 4Â°C, and Toei Animation. Shinji Aramaki, creator and director of Appleseed and Appleseed Ex Machina, serves as the project's creative director. Six of the stories are officially part of the Halo canon, and the seventh, made by Toei, is intended to be a parody of the universe.

The idea for an anime compilation existed for years before there was momentum for the project. 343 Creative director Frank O'Connor produced story outlines or finished scripts that the production houses animated in a variety of styles. Warner Bros. released Legends on DVD and Blu-ray on February 16, 2010.
