The next scene of one of the most popular and controversial games 
ever, in which the player has the opportunity to incorporate the minor thug, and 
then creating their own, the criminal biography to stand alone at the head of the Mafia. This 
together, we come to incorporate a certain Carl Johnson, who a few 
years ago escaped from his native town in search of a better tomorrow. After five years 
Carl returns to Los Santos, where he finds gangster world of murder, 
drugs and corruption. However, the dull landscape of the city is not the end of the bad 
news; district where he grew up looks worse than he remembered it 
five years ago, and quarrelsome family mourns murdered mother, Carla. On 
the end of the evil, corrupt policemen wrabiaj? our hero in the murder. 
Welcome to California during the 90's. 

The game world creates a state of San Andreas, along with three cities: Fierro (San 
Francisco), Las Venturra (Las Vegas) and Los Santos (Los Angeles), between 
which a player can move. Of course, the city of San Andreas are not 
only a patchwork of slums, and besides, dirty neighborhoods, metropolitan areas also have 
rich regions in which they live movie stars, politicians and millionaires. 
So who is Rob, Carl knows this, and in addition does not necessarily work in 
alone, because it can recruit people to your gang. The possibility of car pooling 
Hiking the car and our gang, allow fierce pursuit 
struggle with competing szajkami (eg, the player leads the car, and during that time 
other passengers keep competitive fire with a machine gun). Alone 
mood of the game is kept in climates 90s, and the phenomenal graphics 
(Realistic fog and reflections on the bodywork of cars and realistic 
shading) and the music, turn out to be nothing new to what has been 
made to the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas from the previous sequels. 
The largest of these is probably the introduction of the program for hunger factor 
our hero. For ensuring a nourishing but do not stop, 
conducted by our character, for example through excessive eat a can take 
weight. But this is not the end of the attractions, superfluous kilograms is impossible to lose, 
for example by regular visits to the gym and increased dose of sports. 

Another more realistic game world is greater interaction between the location of the 
urban buildings. A very important element of the game appear to burglary and 
thefts to housing, which we need to carefully plan and carry out. 
There are also possibilities of purchasing a variety of accommodations, which can for us 
earn. Among them is the casino where they can pass a little bit 
cash. Every city has a size comparable to the whole of the previous Vice City 
part of the GTA, so there is no shortage of different means of transport necessary for 
crawl hundreds of virtual miles. For the typical vehicle, such as 
cars, motorcycles, motorboats, helicopters and airplanes, joined, and very honest 
useful in the game world bike. Sam and Carl Johnson, but running and driving 
car, he can shoot two guns at the same time, as well, which is one of the 
the greatest innovations to the front of - to swim. 

Positive experiences associated with visiting the cities of San Andreas, are related (not 
counting the phenomenal graphics) to the intelligence of their people, who react to such 
our unethical behavior on the street, or challenged us from fat men, when 
przedobrzymy nutrition. The creators of the program, as they provide to feel 
in the atmosphere of each occurring in GTA: San Andreas cities it personally 
visited and moved to the game you see there, the special mental atmosphere.
