Tasered

Ten years ago, the TaserÂ® was hailed as the defining breakthrough in modern policing â€“ a weapon that would allow police to subdue â€œeven the largest and scariest people on the planetâ€ without engaging in violent confrontation â€¦ a 21st century weapon that would temporarily incapacitate 100% of the time, but never kill.

â€˜Non-lethalâ€™ declared the companyâ€™s promotional material in 1999. The companyâ€™s word was enough. Police departments embraced the new and promising technology.

A decade later, more than 400 people have died in North America â€˜proximal to Taser use.â€™  That is raising doubts about those early claims. Human Rights groups clamor for more independent research into the weapon and national standards for its use. Newspaper editorials demand the kind of testing that they say was not done those ten years ago. Today the Taser is described as â€˜less-lethalâ€™ and capable of causing of injury.

Tasered takes a comprehensive look at the Taser after ten years. The documentary examines the Taser from within a major Canadian metropolitan police department â€“ the Calgary Police Service (CPS). They have been using Tasers for more than 4 years. And theyâ€™ve been keeping what are arguably among the most comprehensive â€˜use of forceâ€™ statistics in North America since they adopted its use.

Tasered is produced, directed and written by Lynn Raineault for CBCâ€™s DOC ZONE. Executive Producers are Matt Gillespie and Joe Novak.
