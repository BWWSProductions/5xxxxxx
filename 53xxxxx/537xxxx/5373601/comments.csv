[V],twentyforty,2010-02-18T16:18Z,"@777ankush777: Any live event, sports or American Idol, look really terrible at low bit-rates. Disturbingly bad. Believe me, LOL, I've tried.

@aks: I had few episodes and gave them away. You can find rarities by Googleing persistently."

[V],twentyforty,2010-02-18T16:28Z,"@aks: SORRY, I was ""thinking"" Young Indiana. I am not in good shape, obviously.

Young SH I have, but I also have three requests.
Is tomorrow night (CET) OK?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-18T16:33Z,"@htctouch: You've asked in times of bad CAMs and crappy TS and PPVs. But, I remembered your asking about Old Dogs.

Regarding your list, I have Vicious Kind ready, and the rest - I can't."

I can wait."

[V],twentyforty,2010-02-18T20:14Z,"aks999. was it about second comment? It's vague, ambivalent ""no probs"".
""Tomorrow is fine"" is better answer.
""I cannot wait so long, sorry."" can pass too.

Try again. "
