 There has been some criticism in the scene community about these Olympic releases 

 from NBC being truncated from the full length events. Yes that is unfortunately true.

 However there is no other English language scene grp preing as many Olympic releases 

 as we are from any source. It is not 2HDs fault that NBC can't broadcast the full

 events and we can only work with what we are given. It's a lot of extra work to do these

 pres for you guys and the bitching about them being "highlight reels" is getting to us.



 So if there were other options out there, we'd gladly step aside but people seem 

 to want these events so we're doing the best we can under the circumstances.



 As for the delays on some events, we have jobs too and can't be encoding 24/7
