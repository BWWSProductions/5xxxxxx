The one I posted needs a crack. Not this one...didn't you read the description lol? ""rip"""
,Howie1,2010-02-19T19:22Z,"LOL! - Yes, indeed it is a rip!"
,brillmann,2010-02-20T12:03Z,mckayi --You get the idea ?!!. No offence intended.
,COAflyer,2010-02-22T12:10Z,There are no docking systems? They should be there ;). Can you please check or am I doing something wrong?
,tonkey,2010-02-22T23:29Z,"Sorry to be a pain, but how do I install this scenery please?"
,COAflyer,2010-02-23T13:23Z,"Just put the Aerosoft folder in the main FS2004 folder and the modules in the rip in the fs2004/modules folder. Then add the scenery via the scenery libary in Flight Simulator by going to the Aerosoft map and select the Mega Airport Amsterdam and AESLite map (which is located in the Mega Airport Amsterdam Map). But can someone please answer my original question: I can't see the docking systems, is this my mistake or are they just missing in this rip? "
,tonkey,2010-02-23T13:32Z,"Thanks COAflyer. I'll give it a go.
Your help is appreciated."
