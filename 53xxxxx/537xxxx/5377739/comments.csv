,Trafford1965,2010-04-16T19:31Z,Great torrent! Been looking for this for ever. But it goes so slow... How do I change the Aspect ratio? Maybe this will speed it up? 
,uberheer,2011-11-30T07:07Z,"Two things to note: 
1) Audio and Video is excellent, but it is from 1977, so don't expect DVD or Blue-Ray quality.
2) This is not the original (South African) version containing Afrikaans dialog. This seems to be an updated, more politically correct version. If you're a South African like me looking for the original version, then this is not the one for you. I still feel it was worth the download so that my non-South African wife could also watch and enjoy the gags. "
