A collection of Journey music videos and live performances;
10 music videos, 8 live performances (5 from the 1981 Escape Tour,
and 3 from the 1986 Raised on Radio tour).

Note: This is a reseed (sort-of), and when I was ripping it again (because of
hard drive failure), I set the audio to be the same as what's on the DVD,
instead of forcibly ripping it to a certain codec (MP3 @320kbps is what I did
on the previous rip), so its only at 180kbps MP3 (LPCM), which is what the
DVD uses (and yes it's the only audio track on the DVD).
