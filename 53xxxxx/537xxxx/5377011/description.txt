I got board so I decided to whip up a Final Fantasy Soundtrack Package!
For now I only have the first package: Final Fantasy OSXPackage 1 which consists of the full Mp3 format soundtracks of FFX (Final Fantasy X), 
FFXI (Final Fantasy XI), FFXII (Final Fantasy XII) and the bonus OSX: FFTA2 
(Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced 2)

Perfect for the average RPGXP User or if you just simply love the games and their music!

I Took the liberty of organzing the songs by game title so you guys wouldn't be confused.

Naturally there will only be 3 FFSoundtracks at a time but Packages 1 and 2 will have a bonus one.

Please enjoy this torrent!

If I were you guys I'd seed this file because I plan on deleting this file in the near future.



*Note: Please seed this torrent so others may download this file more easily.
