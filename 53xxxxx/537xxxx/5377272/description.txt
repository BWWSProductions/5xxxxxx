Here Guys this contains all the savegames ...just extract and copy the contents of folder SAVE to the game directory
..
for others having a problem like this :-
"Unable yo get IFileSystem interface from FileSystem factory"
just modify the game shortcut file's compatibility to Windpws XP


and for those having directx related problems try adding this line to the shortcut

Copy and paste
+matforcehardwaresync 0 +sndasyncprefetchpriority 1 
in the target line, in the games shortcut
It should look like this exactly: 
"C:Half-Life 2hl2.exe" -steam-console +matforcehardwaresync 0 sndasyncprefetchpriority 1 If you still get the error when quitting the game just ignore it, it will still save.
