,squantch,2010-02-21T21:41Z,"It's the .iso file... Dec09Eng.iso if I remember correctly.

Scanned after a full install with avast!, no viruses or trojans reported. Uploader also has a pink skull, so hopefully this release is clean."

,fagnet,2010-03-12T16:59Z,"Hi.
This is so good i've just registered to leave this comment.
17 processes running from first reboot. Running on a Duron 700 with 256mb memory... I haven't tried the internet yet, i was just running this to get a second PC together to test programmers. The only driver i had to install was my old 32mb VGA card. Anyone remember the 3D Geforce 2MX creative cards?
I also tried auto updates with my permission. They may have worked but it wanted to install the genuine advantage tool, i thoguht it best to leave it as is. it wont be on th net much anyway.

THANK YOU LOADS Sanpork!!"

,jay are two,2010-11-01T19:02Z,"If you are getting errors even though you burned at a slow speed and you have verified the burnt disk (ImgBurn lets you do this as do others), perhaps your CD-ROM drive is too old (like an 8x) or it is broken (like a cheap LiteOn drive or Dell factory drive).  Try replacing the drive in your system that you are installing to.  This has worked for me in the past."
