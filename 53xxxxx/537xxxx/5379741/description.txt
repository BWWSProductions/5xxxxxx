                Win XP Pro SP3 Performance Edition Dec.2009

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


 This supports ONLY English Language and ONLY English Keyboard Layouts.

This is a FULL Install. You CANNOT Upgrade from previous versions of Windows.

There is no validation required. This PASSES WGA. This works 100% with Windows Update.
I have included the CD-Key already in the install process. This means at no point will you have to enter it.
Some people using Macs or Virtual Machines might need the serial. See Serial.txt if you do need it.
Serial.txt is located in the download folder and in a folder on the disc/iso.
This has all windows updates through December 2009. This is has been tested numerous times with no errors.
This has minimalist Internet Explorer 6. (Use It To Download Firefox, Opera, Safari, Chrome, Etc)
This is the x86 version (32Bit).

I have integrated a few new driver packs this time. I kept all the Sata, Raid, & Mass Storage Drivers from before, but also added Chipset, Lan, and WLan drivers.
This is why it is slightly larger in size than the previous releases. I did this because of people previously having such a hard time finding correct network drivers.
This way they are now able to connect to the internet and download all the other necessary drivers themselves. You will still probably need to install other drivers
yourself. Graphics, Sound, Printer, Etc. Unfortunately, the newest driver packs leave behind a little garbage on the main hard drive (Usually C: Drive). You can
safely delete everything EXCEPT WINDOWS, Program Files, & Documents and Settings.

Updates currently work fine and this also currently passes WGA. As a preventative measure, I've also
included Office and Windows WGA Cracks which are in a folder called "TJ" on the disc in case they start blocking the serial number included.
You don't need to use these unless you can't get updates, or this is no longer passing WGA.

This is set to automatically log you in each time you start up. If you want to be prompted for a username and password
please see the "TJ" folder on the disc. It contains a registry patch that you can run to have it prompt for username and password again.
This folder on the disc also contains numerous other little tweak applications, registry patches, WGA Cracks & More.
Please look at it before asking questions.

In the "TJ" folder on the disc, in the folder called "Registry", you will see another folder called "Save_Icon_Layout". Whenever I install
new graphics drivers my icons on my desktop get out of place. This little DLL and Reg Patch will help with saving/restoring your Desktop Icon Layout.
To Install It: Extract the "LAYOUT.DLL" filder to "Drive:Windowssystem32" folder. Then double click the Reg Patch to apply it.
Now it should show up as an option when you right click on your My Computer Icon.

I have removed the original Net Framework that ships with XP. It's super old and outdated.
You can still download and use a newer version however. Just download the latest version from Microsoft.com or Windows Update.

I have disabled and deleted the Classic Windows XP Install Screens with the info about XP and the blue Background.
You will just see a black background now and the install will look similar to 2000. This saves Space and gives more
info while installing.

High ISO Compression has been enabled to save space.

Install Notes:

1. Unrar the Archive(s) using WinRAR or 7Zip. This will produce an ISO file.
2. Burn the ISO using a program such as IMGBurn, Nero, Alcohol 120, Blindwrite, ect... (Burn at a slow Speed to ensure no errors, 1x-4x)
3. Change Bios Priority settings so it boots from the CD-ROM Drive First. (You may be able to skip this step)
4. Insert Disc and Reboot PC, Follow the on screen prompts and enjoy.


Notes:
If you are getting errors while copying files. It's your CD, not the release. Try burning it to different brand of cd/media and try burning at the slowest speed possible.
I just tested this in VMWare and it works flawless. You should get between 16-19 Processes and under 100mb of ram usage when using the computer initially. Everything you install/use will obviously increase this, however its the leanest XP Copy around.
