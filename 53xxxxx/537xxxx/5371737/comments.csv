[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-18T03:03Z,"Alright, working on 02-17 R&F now. Not sure what I'll be upping, I'm loading the newsgroups now. If I end up re-coding or editing it could be an hour or so, I'll keep peeps posted...."
,steelcity,2010-02-18T03:44Z,how do i find said newsgroups?
[V],mothergoose56,2010-02-18T04:00Z,"Well, you register for a newsgroup service (ISP's used to include them but not so much anymore), find a good client (I found xnews, not the greatest but free) and then you load alt.binaries.opie-and-anthony. BTW the 02-17 R&F torrent has been upped...."
