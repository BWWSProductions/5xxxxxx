TheNoobish, I am not trying to insult you but do you have any way of proving this is real per say maybe a screenshot of something that would prove its real? Surely you tested it before uploading it..."
,icdmize,2010-02-21T03:09Z,@Armandez Have you seen http://thepiratebay.org/user/thenoobish/ ?  This cat's record is impeccable.  Sad there are 0 seeds according to the tracker though.
,Armandez,2010-02-21T03:43Z,"Of course I have seen it and thats why I am downloading it. Otherwise I would have waited for someone else to try it before DLing it. I just hate taking risks, of course his track record makes this look all real and legit...but things happen."
,AnasaziMindwalker,2010-02-21T05:14Z,"Seems to be the real deal, BUT it only installs via Steam and you need the serial to run the install. Probably simple to solve, but I couldn't get it to install."
,NeoOhm,2010-02-21T07:43Z,"Ok, you need steam installer and a serial, so WHERE is the serial?
This torrent seem to be worthless cause u cant use it without online code :(

Stop asking for a crack and saying it is taking too long if you don't understand the game has only been up for 3 days and depending on the security for the game could take weeks to crack."

 Anyone who bought Empire Total War will know that the people who made this game are the most low life pieces of shit that ever graced the video game making world. Empire went for 60 - $80 and after a year its still a broke beta with thousands of buyers crying out for some kind of fix to no avail. Don't take my word for it go to Total war forums. Instead of patches to correct a broken product they released DLC's with a handful of reskinned units to further milk their customer base.

if these did not help you then either you're beyond retarded or the game is just not made for your system.

Note: for those who have the steam issue. i did not even encounter steam so i do not know what you're talking about, i already have steam and i did NOT use ""setup"" to install Napoleon via steam.
