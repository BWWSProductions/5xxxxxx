Mid Valley comments: "Some of you may wonder why this release has
Cowboy in the title. Well, if you look at photos from this tour Eric is often
dressed in a cowboy outfit together with the obligatory hat. So, that clears
that up.
The 1976 tour is often overshadowed by the 2 tours prior to this as well as
the following 2 tours.
This is a bad oversight. The 1976 tour has many gems on offer, and
this set offers you the opening UK tour date from the Pavilion, 
Hemel Hempstead, on the 29th July 1976, sourced from the master tapes, 
where you get guitar fest versions of Double Trouble and Tell The Truth. 
Although Eric is under the weather (drunk actually), he still manages to put 
in a very acceptable performance. Far better even is the show from the 
Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Coliseum, Jacksonville, Florida on 
7th November 1976. This show is near complete and is sourced from 
master soundboard tape for the first time ever! Amongst the gems is a 
lengthy unreleased number by Marcy Levy which features some explosive 
guitar work by Eric. Yet again, the version of Double Trouble is spectacular 
and is worth the price of admission alone!
Basically, here you have 2 great shows from 1976 which have never 
sounded so good and gives the listener a great opportunity to have 
a slice of history.
ENJOY!"
