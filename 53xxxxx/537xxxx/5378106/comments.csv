,Oboman79,2010-02-20T11:58Z,"Yeah, good rip. Thanks EZTV.  Crap show though. Its basically animation that has been put to podcasts or audiobooks or something.

A=10
V=10
Show = 0

I had to minimise the video and listen to it. The animation that went with the podcast was distracting and poorly drawn. It looks like a home-made kids cartoon on those really bad ""community"" TV stations. Waste of bandwidth. Download the podcasts instead and save yourselves 170 meg. Ricky is still cool, but this sucks."

,mkh0x45,2010-02-20T16:28Z,"lol i got baked and watched this five times in a row...  great show, naysayers, smoke a joint and quit taking yourself so seriously! cheers!"
,coreblimmey,2010-02-20T19:40Z,"Oh, is this the podcasts put to animation??"
,GetBusyLiving,2010-02-21T22:15Z,This is a fucking hilarious show =)
,DrZanis,2010-02-22T03:51Z,You need to be a fan of the ricky gervais show in the xfm years before really understanding this. Many thanks!
,DrBhup666,2010-02-23T23:23Z,"Well, the show is a-ok, not Ricky Gervais' best work. It's like when me and my friends get together and just rant about stuff and talk silly.. I had hoperd for something a bit mor brilliant from Gervais by now.

But it's not bad, the people hating it must be religious or something because in this first episode he talks about evolution and Darwinism and also he laughed at the guy who thought man and dinosours lived together. I think some religious people will get angry because they believe this. They're fuckin' retards!"
,Phishie,2010-02-24T03:52Z,I just saw Ricky Gervais and a short clip of this on The Daily Show. What I saw was fuckin hilarious. And I am glad there is a comment about this regarding Cannabis already. Sounds like it's gonna be a good one! =P
