,fadue,2010-02-17T14:18Z,"No idea, it just go's straigh to the desktop when the gameplay is supposed to begin. right after the intro scene's"
,KeiKun83,2010-02-17T14:39Z,"@kejso87: You need Windows 7 or Vista with the appropriate update to play under DX11.
But, if your graphics card doesn't support DX11 there is no way for you to play it that way.^^"
,FTL3,2010-02-17T14:54Z,either something wrong with dx11 crack or the drivers. new game = need newer drivers
,kejso87,2010-02-17T18:21Z,"i have windows 7 64bit, radeon 5770, lastest dx sdk (february release) and catalyst  10.1 so i have all up of date, crack for dx11 is probably wrong"
