[T],BluemanWarrior,2010-02-20T01:26Z,"Works for me.
Thanks"
,zelfire,2010-02-20T01:29Z,"Can someone tell me if this uses windows installer before i download , mines messed up thanks!"
,waistland,2010-02-20T18:59Z,Thanks :d it worked for me but once I installed the 1.2 patch and NoCD it crashed so just using the original NoCD and working fine
,RMJ13,2010-02-20T21:06Z,the patches are not for this game!  They are for the First game! 
,RMJ13,2010-02-20T21:07Z,"ATI user,s  This game will only run on DX10 ATI has driver issue for this game  which means this game will only work on VISTA and WINDOWS 7 for now! 

 here is how u can get it to work

make a copy of your  ""config.ini"" folder from the game,to your desk top, then change the ""Cfg.RenderDevice"" in the ""config.ini"" file from 1 to 2. then remove the orignal file save it somewhere and replace with the one you just fixed!  WALLA!

 your welcome!  this will only work on DX10  ATI will be addressing this soon I,m sure ! 


 Cfg.RenderDevice = 2  make it look like this  or just copy and paste this!"
,waistland,2010-02-20T22:58Z,Oh ok thanks for the info since it did not have a nfo file kinda hard to know that one but been playing it and I like:D

Please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"
,chintya,2010-02-22T11:54Z,This software must be activated prior usage. For activation a valid SERIAL is essential.
,Arash.au,2010-02-22T13:19Z,"Got it working. I'm running windows 7 but I still had to do what RMJ13 said. Thanks for the support by the way! Worked like a charm.

Mounted
Installed
cracked
Started crack.

Funny thing is, if I run the shortcut on my desktop I get errors, even though it's pointing to the cracked file. But if I run it directly I'm sweet. Weird. Some compatibility thing maybe. I'm no expert.

Hope this helped."
,Trubattleax,2010-02-22T18:52Z,i cant get this to work on windows 7
,Trubattleax,2010-02-22T18:58Z,nvm i got it working

,chintya,2010-02-23T02:22Z,"The crack  is in Bin right????

,icxu_icxu,2010-02-23T10:37Z,"Installation instructions:
1- Mount the image with Daemon Tools or Alcohol 120%.
2- Install the game
3- After you install it DON'T COPY OVER THE CRACK
4- Launch the game, it will create lang.ini and paul.dll files
5- It will ask for activation, just cancel it.
6- Copy over the cracked file from the crack dir in mounted dvd to your installation folder/bin. When asked to replace, choose yes.
7- Enjoy and Seed"
,Taksimies,2010-02-23T20:41Z,works here.  Game will start only if launched on directory where it is installed (C: > program files > 1C Company >  necrovision lc> bin > double click skull and thats it

,tedwu,2010-02-24T23:36Z,"Does anyone have the issue of error message window showing up then crashed to windows after hitting okay on the message? This only happened after Chapter 6. Tried different nodvd and the config.ini trick suggested here. No luck still on chapter 6. I am using win 7 x86, ati 4890 xxx by XFX. Noiced complaint included self experiece with ATI since it's company is sold off to amd. XFX company has fast card however unstable driver too. (only what I find) Tried running it in virtual XP too no chance as well. My cpu won't take 64 bit system no luck for me there. IF you have a clue please share. If I can't reply again I am sorry not to ignore you and properly thank those whom wished to help but I seem to have issue sending message through piratebay at time. Let me thanks you ahead of time for your attention and any help you may be willing to provide. I will seed as long as I can. "
,TheColdTruth,2010-03-06T06:18Z,"Downloaded, installed, applied patches, copied crack over, doesn't work via shortcut.  

Edited config.ini as mentioned, used shortcut, doesn't work.

Launcher directly from the executable file, and the screen goes dark and resizes like it's launching a game, but the screen stays dark, when I open task manager it informs me that necrovision.exe has crashed.  

This game doesn't work for me, at all.

I'm running a quad core amd with an ati 4890, using Windows Vista 32-bit Home Premium.  "
,TheColdTruth,2010-03-06T06:24Z,"Update:  After installing both updates, doing the config.ini fix that RMJ13 mentioned, and using the cracked exe in the first folder (not the one with the patches), my game now works, running from the shortcut, not just the executeable!

If you're using the crack that was in the folder with the patches, this is probably why you're game isn't working.  Mine works fine now that I'm using the other crack.  This should really be labelled or something in the description as it's pretty confusing.  "
,TheColdTruth,2010-03-06T06:42Z,"Okay, another update.  

It loads up and works but everything in the first level is black as black can be, and I can't see shit other than light sources.  So the game loads now but it's unplayable.  Oh well.  "
,TheColdTruth,2010-03-06T08:11Z,"Update once again, found the fix, here's the post that told me what I needed, along with some more useful info:

""You need to turn dynamic shadows on off, low or medium to not get black/missing textures. If you set it on high the textures will go black. You find this setting on the advanced tab in Options/Video.


If you are an ATI user you may need to copy atidxx32.dll from your system32 folder to ""NecroVisioN Lost Company\Bin"" to run the game in dx10 mode."""
,insomnolent,2010-03-09T13:06Z,Thanks! Love the first game and the original Painkiller. Will buy this game ASAP if its as good as the last game.
,flyingsamir,2010-03-18T12:06Z,"I fixed the ATI problem easily!Just right click on the game icon,select shortcut,and you'll see a target path like ""C:\Program Files\1C Company\NecroVisioN Lost Company\Bin\NecroVisioN.exe"" and just add +dx10 with space and click ok.You'll get path like ""C:\Program Files\1C Company\NecroVisioN Lost Company\Bin\NecroVisioN.exe"" +dx10 and you'll be able to play on Windows 7 32-bit with ATI! "
,tedwu,2010-04-24T01:13Z,"I don't know if any of you got it to work in win7 32bit with ati high end cards. But I still couldn't and have given up. Thanks for the trick on the dx 10 to shortcut unfornately that did not work with my 4890 xxx ati card too. I do have a gtx 285 by XFX I could try. this is card is a trade off my old broken GTX 280XXX. I got it to start though only through chapter 6. Bugs me but no update patch from the company then nothing I could do. i am no programmer. Anyways I thought I would write the head up for those of you that don't know yet. 
Review from myself:
very classic FPS, nothing special change from the first one out except maybe few weapons here and there. Not the worse time wasting thing out there but could definately improve on graphics and stability as far as OS capability wise."
,calafate,2010-05-11T22:44Z,"Man this game is so awesome, i mean im in middle of fucking nowhere, with a fucking small pistol, and im being chased by 10 zombies with shields and stones LOL. I had to jump over the wooden boxes and start shooting by there lol. I was fucking bored about games with 20 min of tutorial, all so easy and so. But here, since the fisrt minute, u aint going to stop moving/shooting/kicking :)

For those who have problems, u shouldnt, its another Mount, Install, Copy crack & Play game. Just avoid the patches included on DVD, they are for original Necrovision and not this expansion, if u realize to install em, ur game will be screwed out.

Thnx for sharing"
,morbus8,2010-06-29T11:51Z,"nice download speed man, hovering between 40 and 70 kbps, SWEET.
Bought the original, good game, but couldnt find any good multiplayer matches so ill just download this."
,doggywuff12345,2010-09-21T17:18Z,"HELLO EVERYONE,
i, like most of you have had a few problems with this game. NEVAR fear for it does work and will work with my help.
firstly try the instructions and crack provided, this seems to work for 40% of people.
1. install game
2.copy crack in bin file
3. run shortcut or.exe either is fine
secondly their were some issues with ati users getting BSODS and directx10 not working
try firstly to
1. on the shortcut on the desktop add +dx10 to the end of the directory
2. change the config file how it is mentione earlier
third;y some pople stil can't get it to work
1. download this other crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4736753/NecroVision.RELOADED.crack.only
then run this and it will work 
hope this helps everyone"
