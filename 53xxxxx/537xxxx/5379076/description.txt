StarCraft 2 Beta Videos - February 20, 2010

The torrent has been updated for February 20. Tons of videos have been added for anyone interested. I had to shave a few of the less interesting videos so that the download would not be any scarier than it already is. 

The last torrent was highly successful. I saw over 100+ peers at a single time and 45 of you seeded for quite some time. Thank you for your support in keeping this going. I will continue to maintain this torrent as long as the community is interested.

Remember, in order to download the new videos, you only have to start with torrent. The files you've already downloaded will be skipped and the new ones downloaded.

Have a happy beta!
