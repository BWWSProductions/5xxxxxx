Note:  Though the narration is spoken English, the spoken language is in Burmese.  The whole thing is sub'd in Swedish.

So, English speakers will understand what's going on (as the footage mostly speaks for itself), but you'll still miss out on half of the dialogue unless you can read Swedish."

,errat1k,2010-06-21T17:27Z,"@Shantanab - yes the subtitles are hardcoded :( I downloaded the English subtitles and they work but you can't read them over the hardcoded swe subs. 

Any suggestions anyone? "
