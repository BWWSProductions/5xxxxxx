,soulmanice,2010-02-19T14:50Z,Re-upped because of an error that I have now corrected.
,soulmanice,2010-02-19T15:59Z,"By the way, I'm in Iceland, so bear that in mind if my upload speed isn't always great."
,ChrisMF,2010-02-20T12:05Z,"Just curious, what was the to be censorred in these cartoons? I have never seen anything that would be cut out in all my years of watching them."
,soulmanice,2010-02-20T16:01Z,"What really bothered me was the modern-sounding voice of Mammy Two-Shoes (it sticks out like a sore thumb and doesn't even fit the character), and some edits that disrupted the flow of the action.

Everything about the censorship can be read here:

,soulmanice,2010-02-20T16:39Z,"I noticed that I mistakenly used the wrong source for #86, 'Neapolitan Mouse': the sound is rather bad. For those who care, here it is from 'The Spotlight Collection' with considerably better sound:

,soulmanice,2010-02-20T18:57Z,"Another correction: For #32, A Mouse in the House, I mistakenly used the wrong source which edits out a blackface gag (at 3:27). Get the uncut version here:

,[__--MUD--__],2010-03-01T05:25Z,"Can we get a seed on this please?  I've been on this since posted...painfully slow.  Dont think anyone got the full torrent, never saw more than 1 seed.  Theres about 1500 peers stuck @ 56% for the last couple days."

Thanks for the work. If you have any T&J from the 70's that would be cool too. Thanks again "
,soulmanice,2010-03-10T16:05Z,Added the non-widescreen version of 'Pup on a Picnic': http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5425253/
,soulmanice,2010-03-10T18:51Z,Wrong! The alternative 'Picnic' is here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5425755/
,ancienthordes,2010-03-13T07:03Z,"@SOULMICE: this one is good job but you have 2 more torrents for the excluded ones.anyways no complain.
heres another link where you can have all episodes including uncuts scenes in few episodes

http://www.btmon.com/Video/Unsorted/ReleaseRelease_di_Cartoni_CHQ_Tom_and_Jerry_1-162_Complete_DVDRip_MP3_XviD.torrent.html"
,ancienthordes,2010-03-13T07:17Z,"when i say uncuts scenes in few episodes.this refer to those episodes which were edited/censored by many television network.the link which i provided is absolutely ORIGINAL with no cut,no edited and nothing.you guys should figure it out.its only 10.3 gb.
soulmanice please dont feel bad.you could have joined those 2 episodes.anyways cheers.
if any one of you feel the link which i provided does not stand to its originality please dont flame."
,soulmanice,2010-03-14T21:07Z,"ancienthordes: Sorry, but frankly you don't know what you're talking about! ;)
The torrent you linked to used to be on TPB as well (can't find it here now), and the versions contained therein are NOT uncensored. You can tell right away by the voice of the black woman - it's not the original.
They have also been processed with heavy-handed smoothing which robs them of their original texture.
And about my additions/corrections: It's not possible to add files to a torrent once you've created and uploaded it. (Or if there is I don't know about it.) That's why I had to upload them separately."
,soulmanice,2010-03-14T21:13Z,"Also, my files are this large for a reason. Had I set the video bit rate much lower than this, the artifacts present due to the age of these cartoons would have looked too ""digital"". 
Of course, with the kind of super-smoothing used on the files in the torrent ancienthordes linked to, everything looks so smooth that the bit rate needn't be so high. "
,ancienthordes,2010-03-15T20:20Z,"sir,regarding to all the episodes involving mammy two shoes i compared it to my vhs tape it was almost perfect texture and vocals.the uploader over there also guaranteed as you guaranteed here.
 he did say the voice of black mammy was recorded one over here in the episode saturdy evening puss.well i will be downloading that episode from you before i comment on it.
anyways i dont know who is right and wrong.
but the good thing u and others  are saving the golden animation "
,soulmanice,2010-03-15T20:26Z,"I only checked the first file in that torrent, Puss Gets The Boot. That was enough: it does not have the original Mammy voice. I also saw that it was the same torrent that I once downloaded in its entirety. I know that those are not the right versions."
,soulmanice,2010-03-15T20:38Z,"The content speaks for itself, guesswork is irrelevant and unnecessary. No need to confuse people with misguiding information."
,soulmanice,2010-03-16T07:02Z,"So as to eliminate any possible confusion as a result of the above comments: 
This torrent here (with corrections) contains the uncensored & uncut versions of all these cartoons, with corrected aspect ratios. At present, there is no other source for this."
,kevenz,2010-03-17T03:58Z,there is usually 161 cartoons to the T&J collections.... where is the rest?
,soulmanice,2010-03-17T08:14Z,"(Sigh...) These are ""only"" the ones that were done by Hanna & Barbera. Everything after that is just not the same and has no place in this collection."
,bychance,2010-03-31T06:17Z,"I have downloaded #110, Happy Go Ducky. Thank you soulmanice for the hard work
 you have put into this epic project. You should be proud of it. Also, I would like to thank the
seeders for their contribution."
,eXpressio,2010-04-24T19:36Z,"That's seems to be an awesome release! 
I hope, that seeders with 100% will be online as much as they can. "
,paremal,2010-05-09T19:51Z,"so stupid torrent

,soulmanice,2010-05-16T01:20Z,"paremal, what are you talking about?"
,music0511,2010-05-19T12:22Z,"Hats off to you, soulmanice, for uploading such a genius, rare and comprehensive collection, which at times  are not available for bucks!!! Guyzzz, plz seed... "
,music0511,2010-05-19T12:24Z,"btw, is this the entire hanna barbara works of Tom & Jerry or only the uncensored ones... plz reply... "
,gafoorgk,2010-05-20T21:58Z,"your effort is very much appreciated dear. thanks. can you please check what paremal is claiming is valid or not!!! also there were 161 cartoons as of 1967. is there any chance you can post the remaining as well in high quality ?!

thanks again. i was looking for preparing a gift cd set for my son. :)"
,gafoorgk,2010-05-20T22:01Z,"btw sourmanice, here is the link from where i got info of 161 titles between 1940 and 1967."

,eXpressio,2010-05-21T09:12Z,"gafoorgk, these one are not classic (made not by creators). This collection contains only Classics series. 
You can find remaining cartoons in other uploads here. "
,music0511,2010-06-04T11:48Z,thanx.... it is indeed nice....
,sharck1970,2010-06-12T03:41Z,i am uploading 60kb/s and can only get 25kb/s to trickle in. you seeders are pathetic. come open it up. let the rest of us have some too. 
,Kreoon,2010-06-13T10:08Z,"Took me 1 week but it was worth it. Stop bitching about the seeds, last night I got ~250kbps after a week of 15kbps. The seed::leech ratio is more than 1:6, what do you expect?"
,k3killakeys,2010-07-06T00:16Z,Thank you very much for your hard work. My children will grow up watching this torrent :)
,Meistarin,2010-09-13T12:02Z,Gonna try it now :)
,ienjoy,2010-10-14T11:32Z,"Hi. First Many many many many thanks for putting this up. Just finished d/l. Two queries
1. Unable to view the widescreen ones. My display goes into the lowest display mode and I have to restart the computer all over again. What should I do?
2. Are there any more T&J which are not a part of this (just making sure....)"
,soulmanice,2010-10-28T04:49Z,"ienjoy:
Sorry it took me so long to answer, there have been login problems. 
1. Your problem with the widescreen videos is probably because they exceed your monitor's resolution. They are around 1100x480 pixels. If your monitor is not capable of displaying this resolution, but you still want to view them on your computer, I guess you have to re-encode them at a lower resolution.
2. There are lots more T&J cartoons (160 I think, or more), but this torrent contains all that were made by the original creators: Hanna & Barbera. And this is the only way to get them all in one place unedited! ;)"
,dac1949,2010-10-29T05:44Z,thx for great up!
,Circa1992,2011-01-17T02:16Z,A monumental upload...historical and forever entertaining.  Something worth sharing with future youth. Thank you greatly.
