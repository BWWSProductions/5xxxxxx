This is my high-quality compilation of the COMPLETE, UNCUT, GUARANTEED UNCENSORED Tom and Jerry theatrical shorts directed by Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera for MGM between 1939 and 1957. 

For detailed info see .nfo file.

Two corrections:

#32, A Mouse in the House: I mistakenly used the wrong source which edits out a blackface gag (at 3:27). Get the uncut version here:

#86, Neapolitan Mouse: the sound is rather bad. For those who care, here it is with somewhat better sound:

...and one addition (alternative version of #91):
