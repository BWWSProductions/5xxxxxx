,propiapersona,2010-03-02T08:30Z,"This works. Nod32 v4 does not find any virus in it, but I ran it in Sandboxie anyway. It was a little confusing with a bunch of choices, a little experimentation found something that worked for me. Eset Special Keyfinder, page 4. It works. YMMV"

,jsho123,2011-05-14T01:14Z,"thank you! i am pretty sure it worked. if it worked, will it say ""maximum protection""? And how will I know when it is expired?"
,propiapersona,2012-02-02T22:59Z,"Update: It seems Eset is aware of this tool, or at least the sites it takes you to, and why shouldn't they be? This key finder has been downloaded thousands of times, probably at least once by Eset. (Hi, guys.)

I used to be able to sometimes get several months, or a 30-day trial, or at least a couple weeks at a time. No more.

Recent experience for the last couple months is that I get a new key (ID/password) and in a couple days it no longer works. I've given up using this tool (though it still works) in favor of just going to a simple site that gives me a list of several working keys - I reset the key and I'm good for a couple days, until the folks at Eset invalidate the new batch of keys. A hassle, but it only takes a minute.

What I do is fire up a sandboxed browser (Sandboxie is my friend) and go to www.hhuu.net. This site may well be dangerous, that's why I use a sandbox when I visit.

Here's the trick: Nod32 blocks the site (as is their right, and I don't really blame 'em), so in order to go there you must first disable Nod32. Double-click the taskbar icon, click 'Setup' on the left side, click the 'Enter entire advanced setup tree...' link and enter your password (assuming Nod32 is password-protected), then un-tick 'Enable Antivirus and antispyware protection' and click 'OK.' You'll get popups about being at risk 'cause your antivirus isn't working, ignore 'em.

Now you're unprotected and about to walk on the wild side - aren't you glad you're in a sandbox?

Go to hhuu.net, then go back and re-start Nod32 (same process, but put the check in 'Enable Antivirus ...'), then pick one of the keys and cut/paste the ID and password into the appropriate fields.

It took longer to read this than it takes to do it (once you've got Sandboxie installed).

Now you're set for a couple days until the folks at Eset catch up with the page in question and invalidate the keys (as is their right), at which point it'll be time to do it again.

Or ... you could pony up and buy Eset when it's on sale. Or switch to AVG or one of the other free products.

Good luck."
