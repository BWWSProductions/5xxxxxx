I'm a big fan of the clock site http://www.avtokei.jp but it's the wrong time for me!  (it's for the Japanese time zone, which is nice, but I'm 19 hours ahead...)  So I time-shifted all the pics so I could serve it up locally with a stitch of javascript and no more weird ads for japanese places I can't even pronounce.  

Enjoy and seed, bitches!
