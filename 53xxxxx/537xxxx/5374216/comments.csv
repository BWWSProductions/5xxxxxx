,puffuZ,2010-11-02T21:52Z,"this license expired? the cow just turned red and stopped working and said it couldn't verify my license anymore.
also they seem to have updated the update server to see through proxy connections and just return an error instead of allowing it."

I've got the same problem now (Dec 02, 2010)!
Can anybody, please?!

,Magerna,2011-01-02T00:26Z,"If you still suffer problems, take a look at this thread:
http://www.nsaneforums.com/topic/41959-how-to-registerupdate-ad-muncher-using-tor/

Using Tor/Vidalia you can easily circumvent the problem of ""You are in XYZ. This license is only for Poland.""

If you already have Tor, the solution is simple:
Edit the
X:\Users\NAME\AppData\Roaming\Vidalia\torrc
with notepad and add the following lines at the end of the file:

ExitNodes blutmagie,blutmagie2,blutmagie3,blutmagie4
StrictExitNodes 1

After that, restart Vidalia/reconnect to Tor and register/update Ad Muncher without any problem and annoying search for a working proxy all the time."

doesnt work for me... tried everything... Tor doesnt even build a circuit when i add the lines u wrote... any other solution maybe??"
,Eagleone3,2011-11-16T10:25Z,"The program is still crackable. I'm using windows 7 64 bit and ive cracked the newest version 4.91 :) Just search this video at youtube: "" AdMuncher активация ""  IT REALLY works and it's easy as hell just give it a try and dont give up that easily"
,Jackdaws77,2011-11-26T07:38Z,"@Eagleone

Thanks man your advice did work, it takes a bit of patience just to watch that fool youtube video go through the motions but its totally worth it and a lot easier than expected! cheers!"
,firsthd76,2012-01-25T19:04Z,"You can get free use of this by using Advor. I'd been using the swiat code, but after updating, said that it had expired.
With Advor, you can run Ad muncher thru it and change your ip address. You can then click for free trial. "
