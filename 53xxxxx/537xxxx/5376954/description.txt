The Live Hacking CD is packed with tools and utilities for ethical  hacking, penetration testing and countermeasure verification. The CD includes hacking tools for DNS, reconnaissance, foot-printing (gathering information about computers on the network), password cracking, network sniffing, spoofing (or masquerading) and wireless networking utilities.

 Here is a list of the hacking tools you can find on the Live Hacking CD:

     Reconnaissance (and DNS)

        * Dig - DNS lookup utility
        * DNSMap - DNS mapping is a mechanism which allows hosts on a private LAN to use DNS Services even if the address of an actual DNS Server is unknown.
        * DNSTracer - Trace DNS queries to the source
        * DNSWalk - Checks DNS zone information using nameserver lookups
        * Netmask - Helps determine network masks
        * Relay Scanner - This program is used to test SMTP servers for Relaying problems
        * TCPTraceroute - Traceroute implementation using TCP packets
        * Firewalk - Firewalk is a network auditing tool that attempts to determine what transport protocols a given gateway will pass.

     Foot-printing

        * Amap - Performs fast and reliable application protocol detection, independent of the TCP/UDP port they are being bound to.
        * Curl - Get a file from an HTTP, HTTPS or FTP server
        * Fping - Sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts
        * Hping3 - Active Network Smashing Tool
        * HTTprint - A web server fingerprinting tool
        * Ike-Scan - IPsec VPN scanning, fingerprinting and testing tool
        * MetoScan - HTTP method scanner
        * Namp - The Network Mapper
        * Netcat - TCP/IP swiss army knife
        * P0f - Passive OS fingerprinting and masquerade detection utility
        * Zenmap - The Network Mapper Front End

     Password Cracking

        * Chntpw - NT SAM password recovery utility
        * Rainbowcrack â€“ Crack LM, MD5 and SHA1 hashes
        * THC PPTP Bruter - A brute forcing program against PPTP VPN endpoints (TCP port 1723)
        * VNCrack â€“ Crack VNC passwords
        * John the ripper - A fast password cracker

     Network Sniffing

        * DHCP Dump â€“ DHCP packet dumper
        * Dsniff â€“ Password sniffer
        * SSLDump â€“ Dump SSL traffic on a network
        * Ntop â€“ Displays top network users
        * Wireshark â€“ Interactively dump and analyze network traffic

     Spoofing (or Masquerading)

        * File2cable - Sends a file as a raw ethernet frame
        * Netsed â€“ Network packet streaming editor
        * Sing â€“ Send ICMP Nasty Garbage packets to network hosts
        * TCPreplay â€“ Replay network traffic stored in pcap files

     Wireless Networking Utilities

        * Aircrack-ng - Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured.
        * Kismet â€“ Wireless sniffing and monitoring
        * THC Leap Cracker - The THC LEAP Cracker Tool suite contains tools to break the NTChallengeResponse encryption technique e.g. used by Cisco Wireless LEAP Authentication.
        * WEPCrack - WEPCrack is an open source tool for breaking 802.11 WEP secret keys.
        * WIDZ - Wireless Intrusion Detection System
        * Cowpatty - Brute-force dictionary attack against WPA-PSK

    Miscellaneous

        * GDB â€“ The GNU Debugger.
        * Hexdump â€“ ASCII, decimal, hexadecimal and octal dump tool.
        * Hexedit â€“ View and edit file in hexadecimal or in ASCII
        * Wipe â€“ Securely erase files
        * Madedit -Text/Hex Editor
