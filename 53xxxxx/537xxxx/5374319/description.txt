This unusual band started in late 90s as an idea of return to the spirit of 80s music.
Few persons connected with the alternative music scene of Warsaw had a thought that life in their neighbourhood becomes more and more boring and plastic, people drawn in alienation, donâ€™t talk to each other on the partys, and the brainwashed techno dictatorship is ruling everywhereâ€¦ bla bla bla

Kostek (before playing in punk band The Leszczers, postpunk Ameba and industrial Najakotiva), the singer Eva and the disco dancer Maciek wanted to startâ€œbrutal romanticâ€ 80s style music&dance&alcohol band. The same people in 1998 played as â€œ2000 Dirty DJsâ€ vinyl records of old polish 80s hits in the squat in old fortress in Warsaw. Now they wanted to hear this stuff alive, so they began to play.
First concert appeared in the winter of 1999. 
The songs based on the inspiration of horror-sweet-synth pop of the nuclear age (especially from the Eastern Europe) with the unhappy love lirycs. The sound went from the Casio synthesizer for kids and the drum machine, mixed with romantic rock guitar solos and early pre punk/glam spirit.
Important part of the show was two shakin disco dancers in glam jackets, the rest of the band had vampire make ups and new romantic style wear.
