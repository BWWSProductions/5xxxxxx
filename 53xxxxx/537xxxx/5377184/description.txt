Historians tell us that the "Anglo-Saxon Mission" refers to the spread of Christianity in the 8th century. But over a thousand years later, there is now another, far more sinister meaning to the phrase.

We recently received 11 pages of information from an insider who was physically present at a meeting of Senior Masons in the City of London in 2005. What was discussed is chilling to the bone.

I (Bill) did an audio interview with our source, an Englishman whose identity we have verified with all details known and confirmed. This man, like many we have spoken with, is no longer able to live with his conscience or to keep this information secret.

My original idea was to release a transcript of the interview, as we have done in the past. But the material it covers is so critical - and, for me, the missing pieces it provided were so important - that I've taken the step to present the information on video. The audio transcript with our source, who is not on the video, is available here:
