I know, before I had read the Nfo, I was like please be in sync and be complete (English) audio even if 2-3mins is cam! I don't mind having a little russian audio cuz I can understand it, but most people in the US can't. Like dear old Mom meaning that I would have to find english subs or make them. But hey it's free so I shouldn't complain! BTW video quality is great! Thanks BONE!"

,highlander777,2010-02-18T13:35Z,"Nice effort but the audio cuts off for about 1.5 minutes at 1:25:25 - 1:26:48. It's at the end of the movie where there's some crucial dialog being spoken. This should be fixed.

The audio cuts off again at 1:28:50 but that's when the credits start to roll so that's OK.

Do you think a Unicorn would be able to fly?

I guess you can DL it if you´re really really desperate to watch it. But then you´d have to watch it alone on your laptop with headphones on so you could really concentrate on wtf they´re saying. I couldn´t find any subs as of 10-02-08 @ 9:45 pm CET. But hey, it´s free, so why complain. Right? Oh, and then there´s apparantley missing audio at the end that people complain about. Thanks for the upload. NOT."
,Juden_mingus,2010-02-19T01:49Z,"Sorry for the offtopic comment but seriously aldren214 are u retarded?

Lets take a look at your comment and find out:
""I'm just sorry for you..."" 
-Haha says the one believing in a fairy tail.  

""you know what? believing in something wont kill you or do u harm"" 
-Well someone skipped history class. Millions of ppl have died and killed for what they believ and continue to do so because of religion.  

""its just better to believe on something like god than die without believing.""
-How can anyone belive in something they dont have any hard proof of what so ever well thats just plain ignorance. 

""when ever your right that there is no god, then so what? you lost nothing..."" 
-Ohh yes maybe just a life believing something that aint true. 

""but what if you die then there is really a god? then it's too late!!!""
Yes it is but then on the other side, god created humans after he's image so that means its possible (since u are in the ""believing"" business) that he is also a....thats right a human fucking being.

Lets face it: Religion is a belief put down in words to give an explination to what they didnt understood a long long time ago and if you still want to belive that shit feel free to do so but I place my bet at science and facts.

Most religous ppl are ignorant fucks that should try step out of there comfortzone a little bit and start looking at the bigger picture.
And if u dont ""belive"" then dont blame one specific religion for they are all messed up. 

All I wanna know is:
Who created the creator? The creatorcreator? And who created the creatorcreator...give me a fucking break....Peace"

,OGma59,2010-02-19T08:30Z,"o my god, ppl, wtf is wrong with you?  this isn't a religous forum, it's a freakin pirate dl site.  there are plenty of places to voice your opinions whatever they are on the net. try blogging like the other idiots.
as for the last few lines of the movie, the russian parts....gabriel tells michael to kill him (do it! do it!). then he says ""but i gave him what he wanted"" and michael replies ""and that is why you failed him"".  michael then tells the young man (Jeep or Jeeeb or whatever his name is) to get the child to safety that he doesn't have much time.  he says he doesn't know how and michael says ""have faith"".  then the last voice over part where the girl is speaking as they drive off down the road is exactly what she said in the first minute of the movie about her mom and god being mad at his children.
so quit bitching about 27 seconds of audio, now you know exactly what was said.
thanks for the up, bone."
