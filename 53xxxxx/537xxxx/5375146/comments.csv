,The Hawk,2010-03-06T03:48Z,Torrent is broken.  No seeds.  Can't be downloaded.
,supermegaman,2010-03-10T16:57Z,"Thanks FrankOMundO. I always seed it to at least double the size of what it is, so that two people will get it which leads to increasing number of seeders if all did it (but also so that I give back more than I get as a thank). Hope more people do so too, and thanks to you who does. =)
