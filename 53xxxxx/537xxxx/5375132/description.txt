These are songs that are usually only available on iclub from Mark Condon.  

Welcome to our iClub family. The iClub is created and maintained by people who are actually in the same shoes as yourself. The producers, arrangers, the songwriters, tech department, transcribers, engineers, singers and musicians all participate on a weekly basis as musicians, worship pastors, praise singers in their local churches. Just so you know we understand where you are. We are not disconnected from the local ministry. We are in the trenches just like you! We work hard to stay in touch with the heartbeat of the local ministry and we are here to help serve the body by sharing all of our combined many years of experience to the world! Our desire is to â€œencourage people into the presence of God!â€
