I know how annoying it is to waste time hunting for books just before a test. This collection It misses out some of the popular books like The Official SAT Study Guide aka the Blue Book, Barron's 2400, Maximum SAT, PrincetonReview's test prep parts, and RocketReview Revolution's SAT guide. If you find them elsewhere, I'll be really grateful if you post a comment with a link to download whatever you found/made/scanned.
