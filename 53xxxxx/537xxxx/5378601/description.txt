Driving a robotic cybersex engine, the "noonaute" explores a metaphorical cosmogony describing the noosphere of Teilhard de Chardin. 


Teilhard de Chardin |tÄËˆyÃ¤r dÉ™ sh Ã¤rËˆda n |

Teilhard de Chardin, Pierre (1881â€“1955), French Jesuit philosopher and paleontologist. His theory, which blends science and Christianity, is that man is evolving mentally and socially toward a perfect spiritual state. The Roman Catholic Church declared that his views were unorthodox.

The term "noogenesis" was coined by the Christian mystic Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. It means the growth or development of consciousness - the coming into being of the "noosphere". Noosphere is defined as the sphere or stage of evolutionary development characterized by the emergence or dominance of consciousness, the mind, and interpersonal relationships.
