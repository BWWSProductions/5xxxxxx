Peter White, who has been blind since birth, presents 'In Touch'
Radio 4's programme for the blind and partially sighted. This is
not his only job at the BBC, where he also presents documentaries
on various subjects.

Peter is very interested in Jorge Luis Borges' work. Here Peter
travels to Buenos Aires to find out what why Borges seems to be
more quoted than read, and to use his own blindness to bring new
perspective to Borges' life and work.
