,phite,2010-04-03T06:32Z,"I would love to download this but I don't think I want to download all of it as it is very large and I can see that there are many books I don't want to read. I think that what I'm trying to say is that without sounding rude it would be nice if this were slightly more organized because I really don't know what any of those books are but I would love to read some of them I'm certain. Any sort of organization would be greatly appreciated. Other than that, thanks for the awesome upload!"
