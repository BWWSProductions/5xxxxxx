how can i install then?"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-02-17T13:19Z,When it comes to DLC games you must transfer this to your HD. This takes a XSATA etc...
,Torr3ntRid3r,2010-02-17T14:56Z,"I hear this question over and over, theres lots of information from google about this. if you have a jtag console running xbr you can ftp from pc to xbox with xextools. I dont even have a jtag on my xbox im storing dlc for when i do. and waiting for the unlikely event of a workaround to the homebrew killing update. This download is worthless without a jtag."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-02-17T15:04Z,True its boring explain it over and over again so i only give hints and the rest is up the downloader to use hes brain/google. There is still ppl with (jtaged hacked xboxes) like me tho. But new update of dash plugs the holes.
[T],Sunblock.,2010-02-17T15:08Z,btw. So i appreciate your uploads ;).
