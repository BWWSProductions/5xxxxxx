A year in the life of a small Italian coastal town in the 1930's, as is 

recalled by a director with a superstar's access to the resources of the

 Italian film industry and a piper's command over our imaginations.

Federico Fellini's film combines the free form and make-believe splendor

 with the comic, bittersweet feeling for character and narrative we 

remember from some of his best films of the 1950s. The town in the film is

 based on Rimini, where Mr. Fellini grew up. Yet there is now something

magical,larger-than-life about the town, its citizens and many of the 

 things that happen to them.
