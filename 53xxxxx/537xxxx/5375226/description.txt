Group PUZZLE released a 2009 horror film called â€œTrapped in Katrinaâ€. From the title, I thought it was a documentary film. But after seeing the poster, I know we have another B-Grade horror piece here :) Size is 1CD, check it out!

PLOT: Ignoring warnings to stay away, Hilton and Amelia, a New Orleans couple displaced by Hurricane Katrina, decided to return to the Big Easy and see their destroyed home first hand. Upon arrival, they quickly realize that things will never be the same. Everything they owned and the life they once lived is gone and when their car breaks down they find themselves trapped in a desolate wasteland. With cell service down and no help for miles tensions begin to rise and ultimately the couple turns on each other. A fight ensues ending with Hilton storming off to find help on his own. Having no luck, He returns to find Amelia gone. With night falling, Amelia missing, and no help to be found, Hilton must brave the inky darkness and all that comes with it to find his wife in this lawless urban apocalypse. Hurricane Katrina changed his life forever, but what happened next corrupted his soul.
