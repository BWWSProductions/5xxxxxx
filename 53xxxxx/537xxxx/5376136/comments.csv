I didn't know if you would put it back up.
It must have cost you a lot of bandwidth
and time.

Spammers are getting pretty sneaky."

For the encode/upload and instructions for the subtitle file.

Cheers

P.S. I was going to thank you for Burn Notice but I can't see it in your torrents.
Thanks anyway as I know it is your work. NO-ONE does it like you."
,hawkeseye,2010-02-20T06:08Z,thank you 20-40 for this movie good quality for a cam v8-a6  could you please up the road. 
,madtown4,2010-02-20T07:23Z,"@hawkeseye are you sure you got the right movie,because this isnt a cam . lol  "
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-20T08:32Z,"@madtown: LOL, R5 sounds ""enigmatic"", but hawkeseye should change his screen-name.
@hawkeseye: R5 is shortened Region 5 (DVD regions, Russia). Depicts 25 fps Russian DVD video track combined with best English audio release-group can find (usually Line but could be Mic also).
BTW, Road was done - twice. Click on my screen-name then browse through pages."
,lilars26,2010-02-20T14:58Z,"Yes,I watched it last night.
You did a really good job
with this one.R-5 is much 
better than cam."
