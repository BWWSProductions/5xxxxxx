A mixture of songs from the 1940s, no review is available so 
here is some paragraphs about a few of the artists featured 
on this album.

Dame Vera Lynn, DBE (born Vera Margaret Welch on 20 March 1917)
is an english singer whose career flourished during World War II, 
nicknamed "The Forces Sweetheart In 1940, one year after the 
beginning of World War II, Lynn began her own radio programme, 
Sincerely Yours,sending messages to British troops serving abroad.
 
She and a quartet would perform songs most requested by the soldiers.
Lynn also visited hospitals to interview new mothers and send 
personal messages to their husbands overseas. 

During the war years she would tour Egypt, India, Burma, giving 
outdoor concerts for the troops.

In 1942, Lynn recorded the Ross Parker/Hughie Charles song, 
"We'll Meet Again",also appearing in the film of that same name. 

The nostalgic lyrics ("We'll meet again, don't know where, don't 
know when, but I know we'll meet again some sunny day") were very 
popular during the war and became one of the emblematic songs of the 
war.

Thomas Edward Trinder CBE ( 24 March, 1909 â€“ 10 July, 1989) known as 
Tommy Trinder, was an English stage, screen and radio comedian of the
pre and post war years whose catchphrase was 'You lucky people'.

We're Going to Hang out the Washing on the Siegfried Line" is a popular 
song written by Irish songwriter Jimmy Kennedy, whilst he was a Captain 
in the British Expeditionary Force during the early stages of the 
Second World War. 

The Siegfried Line was a chain of fortifications along Germany's Western 
border, analogous to the Maginot Line in France, the song was used as a 
morale-booster during the war, particularly up to and during the Battle of 
France Leslie Sarony 1897 - 1985 and Leslie Holmes added some possibly 
unofficial lines.
 
The Sarony and Holmes version puts "Mother dear, im writing you from 
somewhere in France" etc at the start and then, after the main section, 
add four lines starting "Everyone is mucking in and doing their job".
