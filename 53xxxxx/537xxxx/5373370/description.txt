This costume epic takes place in 1079 and portrays the power struggle between the king of Poland, Boleslaus the Bold, and the Bishop of Cracow. It seems Boleslaus has gotten a little heavy-handed with issuing death penalties, and even worse, he's in love with a woman other than his queen, whom he married purely for politics. The bishop threatens excommunication; the king threatens to behead him. Something's gotta give!
