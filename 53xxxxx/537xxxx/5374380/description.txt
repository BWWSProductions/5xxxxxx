Original Mix

Spitting Fury introduces us to his unique blend of chopped up electric guitars, grungy samples, dirty bass lines and audio snippets courtesy of Tarantino in this finely tuned Drum & Bass roller.

Building from Strings, Atmospheric layers and guitars, Death Proof transports the audience straight into a scene from the movie before it drops into thrashing cymbals and tightly chopped Amen breaks.


Crystal Clear Remix

True Playazâ€™ top boy throws down the elements over a Dub Step beat putting an interesting spin on the track, providing a worthy flip side.

Driving bass and stabs cut in and out over the beats along with some heavy sub bass before introducing the layers of guitars and Tarantino samples.


Ben Fawce Remix 
(Digital Download Only)

USA producer Ben Fawce adds a tech step vibe to the track, taking it down yet another route.

Rolling out from an intro of guitars and stabs, Ben builds the elements piece by piece under tight kick drums, pummelling snares and a cracking break before dropping into chopped up bass stabs and powerful sub-bass.
