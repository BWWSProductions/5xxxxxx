RareForm sets the scene with Blade Runner inspired strings & sweeps alongside layers of crunching beats & breaks.

Android Origin rolls out with liquid fuelled Drum & Bass vibes before dropping with an array of distorted Hoover bass lines and stabs.

The track continues to weave in and out of the darkness whilst maintaining a balance of musical elements and dance floor madness.



Q-Project Remix

Taking a darker route with the track, Q-Project elaborates on the cinematic theme and lays down a floor smashing alternative vision.

A sense of panic and confusion is created by the sonic onslaught of cinematic samples and effects alongside gut wrenching bass lines and continuously evolving layers of percussion,
