A failed laboratory experiment in the Bio-weapons division of the military-industrial complex known as ManCorp, mysteriously transformed mild-mannered lab technician Pete Plus+ into the 'Shemale' a hybrid humanoid robot.
In an attempt to cover their tracks, ManCorp decided to destroy 'Shemale', so the secrets of their sinister experiments would remain unknown, but 'Shemale' escaped, and went into hiding in a subterranean cave system beneath a metropolis in the North-East of England called Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
Shunned by humans, and forever on the run from ManCorp agents, 'Shemale' retreated from the world into a parallel universe to create dark, dystopian machine-music, influenced by a synthetic dream of Hyperborea the land beyond the North Wind.
This release brings you dark and slow electro, very ambient and chilling horror soundtracks of a failed polar expedition.
