I didn't encode this. I found this on some obscure torrent site.

The original file was a customized MKV that had a commentary track added to it, but that track was unsynced and was taken from a different and shorter version of the movie, so there was no point in trying to fix it, so I just removed it. Since it was useless. And now the size is smaller.

I repacked the video and audio into a new MKV (just remuxed in mkvmerge, did not encode or convert anything).
