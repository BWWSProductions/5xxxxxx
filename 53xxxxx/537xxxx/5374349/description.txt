Producer Ben Fawce and rising U.K. Hip Hop stars, Predator Prey team up for their debut release on USA.


Original Mix

The boys create a perfect blend of beats, bass lines and vocals leaving enough sonic space for both the instrumental and the vocals to take their turns on centre stage.

Fusing horror movie atmospherics with Ed Rush & Optical bass lines, Ben Fawce lays down a fresh outlook on the typical dance floor sound with post-production duties shared with Agent Smith.

Jalporte of Predator Prey rolls out his vocals with power and precision, creating a trademark sound for the pair.


Soul Intent Remix

Soul Intent injects his signature style into the tune with half speed beats and thrashy live cymbals to great effect.

The unsettling theme is maintained as he layers eerie strings and effects with speaker crunching bass lines and industrial atmospherics.

The vocals groove perfectly over the down tempo beats, combining to create a floor smashing reimagining of the original mix.


Silhouettes

Ben Fawce lays down another Tech Step slammer with Silhouettes and continues to add his own spin on the sub genre.

Building from an intro of ominous chords and stepping beats, Silhouettes arrives at the drop and slams you in the face with thunderous distorted bass lines and Hoover sounds.

The track continues to gain momentum as it smashes along like a bull in a china shop making full use of its array of sonic armoury.
