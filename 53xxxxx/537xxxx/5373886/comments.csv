,chazzo125,2010-02-21T02:05Z,"Put very simply, with all torrents, even from very reputable sources, some Antivirus programs eg AVG etc flag cracked files or keygens as viruses/ trojans etc WHICH THEY ARE NOT.

They are CLEAN files, but you will probably need to set them in your AV as an exception if your antivirus program blocks them.

This is because of how your antivirus program works, especially if running in heuristics mode. Your AV webpage will tell you that you may get false positives, such as these!

People working for games / software companies PUT out messages to try to 'warn' you away too, usually using very bad language!

Then there are spoilers who download the game themselves and try to poison others by saying it doesn't work etc - DON'T believe them!

Responsible uploaders remove files genuinely found to be infected.

If a torrent has been around for a while, or is from a popular uploader, you can be sure the files are clean.

If concerned, use a reputable anti-malware program such as MalwareBytes AntiMalware, SuperAntispyware or Spybot after install but before running the game/ software file and again after running it. Post exact details of the program used and problems found!

If you can't except simple facts, don't download ANy torrents! "

its not real there is no virus as i can see the injector.dll is a hacker tool used to install the game and antivirus is detecting it as a virus trojan but its false positive and its not a virus just switch off your windows firewall and antivirus firewall and switch off the antivirus for the time u install it and it will work and after installation just switch on everything the anitvirus and firewall and it will work without any problem
one more thing to protect ur pc from virus when u turn it off for the installation just turn off the internet so that no fucking virus touches ur pc
it will take 30 gb during installation and after complete installation total size will be around 14gb so enjoy

,EbilPhish,2010-02-25T15:44Z,"@sus2912: How is disabling the firewall going to help get the thing installed? The firewall should have nothing to do with any false positive virus, the only reason it should interfere is if something *is* trying to connect to the internet, in other words a real virus. Your name is also 'sus'...

Also it seems odd that several antivirus packages would all detect a similar thing and all classify it as a 'trojan'. Normally it's just 1 specific antivirus picking up something. Granted some antivirus companies do detect cracks as 'hack tools' and such.

Ill probably grab this release anyway since the size is so low. Install it in a virtual machine, transfer the installed files and revirus scan the installed version to insure it's only the installer infected. Worst comes to the worst my Win7 install gets hit (which I only ever use to play games anyway, might just keep the internet connection off)"

It appears to be a problem with AvP_DX11.exe. 

Manually running the AvP.exe as mentioned above solved it (it also seems to start quicker).

I assume the shortcut links to AvP_Launcher.exe which probably loads the DX11 version. I'm not sure if my card (260GT) supports DX11 so it would be interesting to hear from someone with a DX11 card.

I HAVE FOUNDED A FIX TO ALL PROBLEMS!!

Problem: The first problem you cant install game to due of an Runtime Error !!
Fix:TURN OFF YOUR ANTI-VIRUS

PROBLEM:Game Crashes at the end of movie
Fix:Right Click on shortcut and propreties and next on the target should appear this :

""C:\Program Files\Aliens vs. Predator\AvP_Launcher.exe""

Put it like this 

""C:\Program Files\Aliens vs. Predator\AvP.exe"""
,theRealKarmine,2010-05-07T21:17Z,seems like a bad rip then.
,ProiteXswe,2010-06-17T16:02Z,"This is the solution on Runtime error if you have AVG, i had the problem and i tryed to turn it off but it didnt work! 

This is how i got it to work :

Double click the Avg Tray, then click Tools > Advanced settings > Resident Shield, then uncheck the ""Enable Resident Shield"" And try! 


Hope this works for you!

Thx for the torrent thenoobish!"
