Army of Two: The 40th Day (wave 3 Version)

NOTE:

This is a request!!. I have patched the game from wave 6 to wave 3. So it can be
played on IX 1.6 and with out the actv.iso. But DO NOT play this game on your
none banned console. This version/pathing will get your console banned 100%!!.
Its for banned consoles. You need also latest dashboard (2.0.8955.0).
