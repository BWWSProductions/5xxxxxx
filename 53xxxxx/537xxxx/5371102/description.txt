Fixed my Apple Mighty Mouse yesterday.  That bottom ring snapped off pretty easily.  I just used my fingers.  Took it apart and cleaned the ball and 4 pin wheels it glides on.  Thing works like new now.  Just used a couple dabs of super glue to attach the bottom ring back on.  Works and looks like new now.  Damn thing been buggered up for years.  Why didn't I do this sooner?
