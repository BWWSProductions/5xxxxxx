How do you add those little cover arts to the files?"
,olglow,2010-02-17T20:55Z,"HolyRoses...

I love you.

I've been downloading your torrents for about 2 weeks, and, I have to say, I am surprised how great all of your uploads look with such a small file size. I download movies off of iTunes for a while now, and it really eats up my hard drive space. I am so glad that good samaritans, such as yourself, can save my computer from having a full hard drive.

I know that flattery will get me nowhere, but I would really like to see:
Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut 
Terry Gilliam's Brazil
Plan 9 From Outer Space (color or not, doesn't matter to me) 
Ed Wood 
and What About Bob 
in PSP, iPod, and Zune format available. I know you don't take requests, but I would appreciate if my suggestions were taken into consideration. I will continue downloading your stuff, regardless. Thanks!

P.S. I've really wanted to see this without giving Joe Jackson any money. Thanks for the fantastic alternative."
