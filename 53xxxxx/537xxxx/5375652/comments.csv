,rubengarciajr,2010-11-19T00:43Z,"this patch works nice.. update, the serialz go wrong when you launch, close out program, overwrite with the patch file and launch, and enjoy."
,extile,2011-03-12T21:18Z,"Thank you very much.

This works to update from 11.514-11.530. Here is what I did.

I started with 11.514, then I simply downloaded this, allowed C4D to update. It had to restart itself once to begin the download and to install it. Then it restart itself once more to open the application, at this point it said all the serials I had were wrong. It popped up with a window to enter new serials. I closed it and did the following.

I copied this file:""gui.cob"" to the ""MAXON/CINEMA 4D R11.5/resource"" directory. Obviously you have to overwrite it. I then just simply opened C4D and BAM! It worked, and asked me if I wanted to update to version 11.532, which I'll wait to do until I see some comments saying that I can safely.

I figured I'd leave a detailed comment to ease the people that don't really trust this kind of stuff, or were unclear on exactly what to do. 

Enjoy!
