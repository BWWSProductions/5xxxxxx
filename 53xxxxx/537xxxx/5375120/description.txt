theoretical math music - amon293


"theoretical math music" is the result of eduardo costa alter-ego, amon293 that is used as a channel of communication between the subconscious and the real world. result of a merger of ideas materialized in sound, doesnâ€™t respect music standards and travels along alternative progressive rock. 
confuse, crazy, incomprehensible, boring, undefined, repeated ad nauseam, unpractical, impossible to execute, are common words to describe the music of amon293. all those words are true but i simply donâ€™t care.
this album has special appearances gonÃ§alo castro, guitarist on ravensoul and hatedisposal (great shred on driving blind) and ana rita who is the voice of sleep.
"theoretical math music" recordings began in 2007 and continued until 2008 where the first album in demo version was launched, with the total alignment and low quality that it deserves. during the years 2009 and 2010 the demo was re-recorded with the acquisition of new equipment for recording, in order to improve the sound and trying to bring the final record something more professional. well, i think i did that.
