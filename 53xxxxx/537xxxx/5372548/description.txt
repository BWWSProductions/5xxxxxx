Synopsis.

Roger Dodger | USA | 2002 | Directed by Dylan Kidd
                                  
First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd takes a supremely jaded view of women, relationships, and sex in this edgy drama, which is reminiscent of the films of Neil LaBute. Campbell Scott portrays the eponymous Roger, a hotshot advertising executive whose recent, ill-fated affair with his attractive, older boss (Isabella Rossellini) seems to have undone his sense of his own masculinity. This leads him into a downward spiral of alcohol abuse and resentment toward the opposite sex that comes to a head when he takes his visiting 16-year-old nephew (Jesse Eisenberg) out on the town with the goal of helping him lose his virginity. Dialogue drives Roger Dodger -- Scott, in a dead-on performance, delivers brilliantly acerbic diatribes about the battle of the sexes with cocky confidence and the zeal of the converted. Smug and arrogant, heâ€™s a mentor from hell who spews out his secret frustrations onto his naÃ¯ve protÃ©gÃ© with a force that will make some viewers cringe. Yet, we gradually see this monsterâ€™s faÃ§ade begin to crack. In a scene in which Roger and his nephew encounter two attractive and  available singles (Jennifer Beals and Elizabeth Berkley) at a bar, Rogerâ€™s slick witticisms are no match for the boyâ€™s innocent romanticism. Roger Dodger stops short of the bleak alienation of LaBute's In the Company of Men or Your Friends & Neighbors, but it nonetheless avoids any easy catharsis. Roger may not be likable, but he rings true, and understanding him ultimately becomes more important than sympathizing with him.
