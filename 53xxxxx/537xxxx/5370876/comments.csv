,xcski,2010-02-18T00:58Z,Thank you so much for all your torrents. I love you!
,zima00,2010-02-18T12:19Z,Can You upload women's curling from the olympics? Thanks
,Spartanus,2010-02-18T15:36Z,"Shoot! The torrent tracker where I usually download stuff is having problems.

Could you PLEASE continue uploading xc-skiing?.."
,BasilBrush,2010-02-18T16:48Z,"The tracker just stores the unique torrent hash number and swaps IP addresses with other clients that are also running the same torrent. All you need is the magnet link and DHT enabled.

If your ISP is blocking you then try creating a VPN tunnel to Relakks. That should sort things out."

Sorry, I'm just doing the cross country and biathlon events. It's just impossible to do it all. I can't find any curling on thebox.bz either except for an Olympic guides/rules for curling which isn't what you're after."
,zima00,2010-02-19T01:22Z,"No, I don't wont that. I wont to see Jackie Lockhart curl. 
But thanks for traing"
