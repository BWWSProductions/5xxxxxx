BBC Radio 2 - Bob Harris Country -  18th Feb 2010 



Bob is joined in session by African-American string band trio 'The Carolina Chocolate Drops'.
Celebrating the often overlooked music of 1920s and 30s black string bands the trio swap instruments and vocal duties throughout their new album 'Genuine Negro Jig'. With fiddle, banjo and various percussion instruments including jug and bones, the band interpret a range of styles including traditional mountain jigs, old English folk and even a Tom Waits composition.
The Carolina Chocolate Drops formed after band members Dom Flemons, Rhiannon Giddens and Justin Robinson met at the Black Banjo Gathering in Boone, North Carolina in 2005. 'Genuine Negro Jig' is the band's second record following their 2007 release, 'Dona Got a Ramblin' Mind'.
