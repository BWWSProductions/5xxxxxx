Alex welcomes to the show former Ohio Democratic Representative, James Traficant, who was expelled after being convicted of taking bribes and filing false tax returns. Traficant says he was the top target of AIPAC and the U.S. Justice Department. He was released from prison on September 2, 2009 after serving seven years in prison. 



Alex talks about the latest developments in the suspicious Austin kamikaze attack on the IRS.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
