Welcome to Tag Team Tuesday. This is round 3 of 4 of the January match-up between The Ninjas and the Dragons. This is the CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH of THE YEAR!

This is it! The last round of wrestling! The Dragons came back from from 41pts down to take the lead going into this last wrestling round. Everything is on the line- the Championship trophies, the bragging rights, and the fucking rights! Four of Ultimate Surrender's best wrestlers are going for the win, in front of a live audience, and being streamed live to thousands of members!

If you missed this match live and are watching the edited match for the first time, it doesn't get any more exciting than this! It all goes down to the last seconds, less then 20 points separated the championship from the losers. Who fought off the last brutal sexual attack, who ran out of time as the buzzer went off? If only there was 5 more seconds......
