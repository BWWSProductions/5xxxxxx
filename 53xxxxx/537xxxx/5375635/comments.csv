One question though - another copy of this, also labelled the director's cut, is 5 minutes longer (1:59). It's not from extraneous menu footage at the beginning or end, it's in the movie. Haven't gotten to compare the two yet, but does anyone know what this is about? Are there two versions of the director's cut?"
,Heet-Beet,2012-01-18T19:53Z,"@spunkster. The other copy may have been a 24fps version of the film. To convert between 24fps (NTSC) and 25fps (PAL) the film is actually being played at different speeds, otherwise some frames would be lost or doubled which is quite noticeable. (119min or 1:59)*24/25 = 114.24min, about a 5 minute difference between NTSC and PAL."
