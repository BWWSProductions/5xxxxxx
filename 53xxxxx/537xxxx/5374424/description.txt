SICKDOLL is â€¦ sometimes maybe living in a parallel universe?! By creating his music he seems to be leaving his physical 
Ð°orm to fly through time and space and rooms and spheres (or maybe it is a circle with its foldings â€“ who knows? â€“ still 
reflecting his earthly experiences. SICKDOLLâ€™s music is lovely melodic electropop and every song is a charming one.
