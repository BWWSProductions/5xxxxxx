,randomstudman,2010-02-18T01:59Z,it wont activate waste of time to download
,akimos,2010-02-18T09:40Z,"its working fine just install it and then use the .reg file 
then run the app (it will tell you about key and buying , just ignore it and click the (X) and it will run normally) "
,adamw84,2010-02-19T09:09Z,i can't seem to get this one to work either. a message pops up that says that i need to validate and hitting the X just closes the program
,dndrmm,2010-02-19T21:44Z,"It activates perfectly fine by applying the registry values in the *GASP* Activation folder.

Thanks for the upload!"
,scouseruk1210,2010-02-21T23:10Z,"im havin the same problem,i installed,then went into the activation folder and added the registry like it should and it still brings up the key screen and goes off without being able to use it,im using windows 7 64bit"
,alkabirj,2010-02-22T00:23Z,"The program starts a little bit longer on first run. It would remain inactive for about a minute or two or longer if your machine is slower. But prior to first run, it would start faster."
,dannykard,2010-02-22T03:30Z,"If you are having problems to ""crack"" the program, uninstall it, go to regedit and delete the 4 following folders: fvbot, fvdisclaimer, fvdonate, and fvmessages. After that, simply install Farming Extreme Manager again, open it (it's not cracked yet) and you will be asked to enter a key, close everything again and run the ""activate"" file.

It should be it ;)"
,garfieldi,2010-03-23T21:49Z,Just get a license from here for only $6.99. Not even worth the hazel of cracking and you always have the latest version: http://www.secretsfarmville.com/?rid=5472
