Wikipedia â€“ No.1's is a compilation album released by R&B group Destiny's Child containing songs from their albums The Writing's on the Wall, Survivor, This Is The Remix, and Destiny Fulfilled. Although it contains No, No, No Part II, the version used is a shortened form of the Extended Remix featured on their remix album, meaning that no actual song from their self-titled debut was used. It was released on October 25, 2005, charting at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart and number six on the UK Album Chart. The album has sold 3.5 million copies and became the best-selling greatest-hits album by an all female group.

Amazon.com - #1â€™s is the highly anticipated Greatest Hits package from the worldâ€™s biggest selling female group.
