Have fun, even though you won't understand much. This game is so much like real life - even though you don't listen to the chick, you just nod it off and you'll eventually have sex with her."

Also I am able to run Mass Effect 2, CODMW2, and recent titles with no problem so I doubt its a graphics problem. Is it possible that it's because I have 64bit Win7?"

,patriotbr,2010-02-22T03:18Z,"Guys, follow this to run.

4 - Go to drive mounted, navigate to X:\setup and run the ""ILLUSIONxxxx.msi"", the game will installed (few minutes)

The English patch comes as a .exe file.  Simply run that file and it will install all the English translations for you.  You said you ran the registry tool so your installation directory should be in English characters already and the .exe should work fine."

,azgodeth,2010-03-27T15:53Z,"1: get aplocal, make your comp think its gone japanese.
2: install game by clicking the same buttons youd click for an english installer (come on, all windows install wizards are setup the same. language makes no diffrence!) - if your really that bad you cant get through it, there are english installers out there. search for Real Kanojo Mods on google

3: is where you'll have to decide. dedicated perv, or part time fapper?
dedicated pervs will want to look for a translation mod, of which there are dozens. go to Hongfire once you have the iso, and they'll have every mod under the sun. 
if your just looking to releave some tension, go search for a save file, and play the game in japanese. grope around till you find the load screen and enjoy.

4: stock up on tissues, hand lotion, and plenty of elecrolytes."

And for the people who really have no life and must leave derogatory comments about the types of people playing this game, take a deep breath and sit down, because I actually do have a real girlfriend and we have great sex. It is quite interesting to see the kind of intellect it takes to write hateful stuff about random people you know nothing about. You have no problems getting laid, but so what? I have no problems playing a game were the focus is on the women, and I don't think vast the majority of people on earth have a problem with prostitution, stripping, or other activities with a naked woman that doesn't involve a committed relationship. In any case, everyone knows that it doesn't take intellect in order to get laid, and what is to be so proud of if you are getting laid regularly versus not getting it? What we don't need is more dim wits, such as yourselves, making masses of little brood idiots. "
