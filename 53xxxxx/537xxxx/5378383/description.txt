After some years of collecting The Doors I decided that I want to share everything I have. Most of it (everything?) was made available on The Traders Den. I sorted everything and completed it with all kinds of official releases.

Please let me know if you have additional material, upgrades or comments on this!

The other parts will be uploaded as soon this one has some seeders. Everything I have will be more then 70 gb's!

Because of long file and folder names, I had to split 1968 and 1970 up. Still, everything is there except the info files on the images. They didnâ€™t contain anything else then is in the other info files on the images, so thereâ€™s no real loss.
