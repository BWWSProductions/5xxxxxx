,jasperjoy,2010-02-21T22:17Z,"Hey profanpro...yes,thanks..I used to have a copy of this years ago,I remember it totally bombed when it first came out,from what I can remember it wasn't that bad,although I don't think people quite liked Elton trying his hand at disco ! by the way,you are doing a great job uploading his catalogue,I didn't have the deluxe editions of several of his albums,that is until now ! Cheers."
