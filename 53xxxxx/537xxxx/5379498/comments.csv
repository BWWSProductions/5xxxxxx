,Lassik,2010-03-31T08:32Z,"This isn't getting very many seeds because of the way the file is named. If it were named with a standard naming convention that's popular among most trackers then it would shoot up a lot more. Maybe someone would be willing to re-up this torrent with a different name.

Should look more like this.
[Wii]Data East Arcade Classics [NTSC] [Scrubbed]

For example look at how many leechers there are on this one.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5379932/%5BWII%5DData_East_Arcade_Classics_%5BNTSC%5D.rar

That one will never finish though because it's been at 1 seeder since it was posted."
