Schisms in Christianity - Anglicanism, Puritanism, Methodism, Pentecostalism, etc:

According to Wikipedia, the number of sects and denominations within Christianity is approximately 38,000 denominations (yes, that is right; thirty eight thousand). At a first impression this number seems unrealistically large.

But, if we consider that the original sources of Christianity were corrupted beyond repair, that religious persecutions had destroyed many of the early documents of Christianity, that the Bible contains many contradictions to science and logic, the corruptions of the Papacy and the Church, the rampant frauds and forgeries, that so many innovations were introduced into Christianity, the influence of pagan, Assyrian and Egyptian myths, . . . ., and that the true message and teachings of Jesus were lost,

Then, it becomes understandable why so many sects and denominations exist in Christianity.

This UL contains 49 titles, and examines some of the denominations in Christianity: Anglicanism, Anabaptism, Calvinism, Puritanism, Methodism, the Quakers, Mormonism, Seventh Day Adventism, Pentecostalism, etc..
