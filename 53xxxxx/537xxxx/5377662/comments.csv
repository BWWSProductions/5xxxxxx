I'm on mac. First time I get this problem. This movie is one iso.part file. I've obviously come across .iso before, but never iso.part

And there's just one, not a series as in .rar or .par

And for the life of me, after searching and searching, I can't find a way to open or convert this file into something watchable.

Disk Utility, Toast 10, unrar, unpar etc, I've tried them all.

Can anyone help? Thanks..."

I don't think you have download it it correctly. 
My tip is that you download it again or if you have downloaded it correctly, you could try to rename it from MICHAEL_JACKSONS_THIS_IS_IT.iso.part 
to 
MICHAEL_JACKSONS_THIS_IS_IT.iso 
If it's possible to change the file name or the file type in the mac.

If this dosen't work then I can't help you."

,willyisanidiot,2010-03-09T08:49Z,"Thanks Toppe 89,

I had tried changing the name, but ther'es a corrupt file message. 
Downloaded with transmission to 100%. Strange. 

Too large a file to download again. Never mind!"
