66 minutes of American-Jewish musical and cultural experience of the past 100 years. Max Epstein ranks as one of the greatest klezmer clarinetists of this century. Max and his brothers are considered to have been innovators in the fields of Yiddish, klezmer and Hasidic music: They brought their knowledge as American dance band players to klezmer music, transforming the celebratory music of the Eastern European shtetl into an urban expression of North American Jewry.
