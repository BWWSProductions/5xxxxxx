Share the wealth is his slogan."

,ernst80,2010-03-05T02:14Z,"A lot of Americans seem to be easaly manipulated by large corporations. You'd rather have people die after going bankrupt due to medical bills?
it's not socialism/marxism/communism, it's ethics.
People don't get sick on purpose (and even if they do, you could perhaps fine them after they live), and as a society you can decide to help them, without paying huge premiums to hugely profitable insurers who have the market cornered."
,joful2068,2010-03-13T20:09Z,"Fewer people die in America than socialist states due to lack of health care, in socialist states at some point they deim it to expensive to treat you or if you don't live a proper life style!!!
 And the reason health insurance cost so much is the government has mandated the insurance companies cover in some states up to 70 mandates, a 20 year old must have coverage for prostate cancer he won't even be checked for until he is in his 50's, one state health insurance is $1300 and in another it's $350 for a family of 6, same deductible and out of pocket expenses!!!!
This is what happens when government starts thinking they know more than everyone else, or are trying to implement Marxist ideals!!!!"
