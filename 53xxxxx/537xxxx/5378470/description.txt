An interview with a former college friend of US President Barack Obama about his college days as an avowed Marxist Communist Leninist
"Barry Obama"  arrives at a party arranged by the then kingpin Marxist of the college ( who is now a staunch Republican now in 2010) after seeing the error of his ways over time
"Barry Obama"  arrives with his wealthy Pakistani roommate whose central concern in life seems to be his luxury BMW auto
To all intensive purposes to the party members it appeared that the two were a wealthy gay couple
Interview is about 20 minutes or so in length
If you listen to one interview this year this should be it
The point is that according this former acquaintance of the now US president Obama Mr. Obama's views of Marxism and Marxist tenets seem to be most consistent , firm and unrelenting in terms of any changes of viewpoints
It might appear that at the least the US voters and citizens deserve and explanation at least when it comes to the consistency of relationships of the likes of Bill Ayers and racist preacher Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Jr "America's chickens have come home to roost" - in relation to 9/11 attacks
How Mr. Obama and his family could sit in the pews of Rev Wright's church for 20 years and not hear his views is beyond most people ?
Did he hear ? Did he hear and not listen ?  Did he listen and not understand the reverend's views ?  Yet Mr. Obama took the title from his autobiography  The Audacity to Hope sermon from which the title of Barack Obama's book, The Audacity of Hope, is derived. Go figure
