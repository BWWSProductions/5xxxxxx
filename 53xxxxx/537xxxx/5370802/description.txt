 With the plug about to be pulled on his late night talk 
 show after a fifteen year run, and his wife engaged in  
 a steamy affair with a pro baseball star, host Jack     
 West is desperate - to keep aflame his fading           
 celebrity, and avenge the misdeeds of his adulterous    
 spouse. With the clock ticking, Jack concocts the       
 mother of all media stunts, killing two birds with one  
 unforgettable stone on the road to redemption. The      
 scheme entangles an eclectic collection of colorful     
 locals navigating their way through unpredictable       
 twists and turns. A plump private eye teams with a      
 macabre webmistress to investigate the strange          
 disappearance of a dead body. A glassy-eyed cheddar     
 head falls prey to a phony get-rich-quick guru.         
 Imperiled actors embark on a quest for a fresh corpse.  
 Cops in costume, a peculiar special effects make-up     
 team, porn stars with dreams of stardom, a Jewish drug  
 lord with very large brothers, Russian mobsters and     
 others converge in this unique roller-coaster ride of   
 comedy, mystery, murder and mayhem through the          
 underbelly of modern day Sodom and Gomorrah.
