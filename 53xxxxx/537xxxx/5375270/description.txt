Desc: Tim copes with his breakup by growing a beard, and his coworkers compare him to a homeless man.
Notes: Quality is good for a web rip -- HBO online streams 960x540 h264 files. I ripped the stream because HBO's online player pissed me off -- Released it if anyone can't wait till tomorrow to watch 1/2 (note yes, this is just the first story in S02E01).
