    Ten years after witnessing her older sister's brutal murder, Jenny       
    Traylor leaves her hometown in North Carolina to start her freshman      
    year at the University of New York City. Still traumatized by her        
    sister's death and struggling with crippling agoraphobia, Jenny tries    
    to cope with the overwhelming city and figure out her new life. When     
    Jenny's over-enthusiastic Resident Advisor organizes a Welcome Week      
    scavenger hunt, Jenny is reluctantly persuaded to join the game. But     
    as she and her new friends decipher the cryptic clues texted to their    
    cell phones - clues that lead them through darker and increasingly       
    remote parts of the city - it becomes terrifyingly clear how high the    
    stakes have become. Someone is hunting for real.
