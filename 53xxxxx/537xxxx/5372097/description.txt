This collection includes:

-A mostly complete English rendering of the Sutta Pitaka, scanned copies of works published by Wisdom Publications. The best of my knowledge, all that's missing is a few books from the Khuddaka Nikaya.


If you find these works to be useful to you, please consider purchasing an actual paper copy from Wisdom Publications or the Pali Text Society. Without the work of these noble individuals, this collection could not have been released. And without continued financial support, their work cannot continue.

Furthermore, without actually having a paper copy of the texts cited here, a person cannot be as certain as to the accuracy or authenticity of the copies presented here, because of how easily it is to alter digital information.
