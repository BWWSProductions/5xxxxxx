    a Nazi plot for an uprising of the Arab                
    tribes in Lybia. Pursued by Sheik David and

        Nancy Brooks, who is in the British

    latter tries to discourage him from further                
    investigation, as the British are aware of             
        the plot and are planning on staging a coup.
