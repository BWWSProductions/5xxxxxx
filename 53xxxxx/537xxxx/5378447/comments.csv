Yet, the Seeding Rank -- which indicates the availability of the torrent -- has consistently been 9,999, which is the highest level of rarity, since I downloaded it 50 days ago.

Therefore, I would request that after you download this movie, can you please do a little seeding?  

You don't necessarily have to seed 15 times, but let's see if we can get the Seeding Rank down a little bit.  After all, the demand seems to be there."

So please, if you download, please also seed.

I don't mind helping, but many hands would make lighter work.

Thanks to TvTeam,
