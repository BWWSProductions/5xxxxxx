PBS Nova -- The Elegant UNiverse (2003)

Physicist Bryan Greene's bestselling book comes to the small screen in this
stimulating look at a complicated topic: the search for order in the universe.
Is a revolutionary proposal--"string theory"--the answer scientists have been
seeking for centuries? Greene tackles the mind-boggling complexity of the
theory with vivid, clear images, and calmly points the way to the answer.
