Thelonious Sphere Monk[1] (October 10, 1917 â€“ February 17, 1982) was an 

American jazz pianist and composer who, according to The Penguin Guide to 

Jazz, was "one of the giants of American music".[2] Monk had a unique 

improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard 

jazz repertoire, including "Epistrophy," "'Round Midnight," "Blue Monk," 

"Straight, No Chaser" and "Well, You Needn't."

Often regarded as a founder of bebop, Monk's playing later evolved away 

from that style. His compositions and improvisations are full of 

dissonant harmonies and angular melodic twists, and are impossible to 

separate from Monk's unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a 

highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of silences and 

hesitations.

Monk's manner was idiosyncratic. Visually, he was renowned for his 

distinctively "hip" sartorial style in suits, hats and sunglasses. He was 

also noted for the fact that at times, while the other musicians in the 

band continued playing, he would stop, stand up from the keyboard and 

dance for a few moments before returning to the piano. One of his regular 

dances consisted of continuously turning in a counterclockwise fashion, 

which has drawn comparisons to ring-shout and Sufi whirling.

He is one of only five jazz musicians to be featured on the cover of Time 

(the other four being Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Wynton Marsalis, 

and Dave Brubeck).[3]
