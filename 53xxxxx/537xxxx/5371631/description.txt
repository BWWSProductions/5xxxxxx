A High School Poet by Steven Veach 

This is a collection of poems I wrote in my Junior year of High School.  I hope you enjoy them. 

I also have several books for sale at my online storefront.  You can order your own copy at http://stores.lulu.com/cabinhermit or you can find out more about me at http://www.stevenveach.net and follow along with me as I write my newest books, THE PREPARATION and IN THE MEADOW.
