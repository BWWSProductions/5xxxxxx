[T],teslaman,2010-02-18T04:45Z,"Thanks Robston! Much appreciated. ;)

hmpb, just ignore the category, I used to always put it on ""Video > TV shows"" but then TPB would change it to highres on me, so I gave up. The title and description should make things clear enough anyways that it isn't HR. ;)"
,hmpb,2010-02-19T19:05Z,Okay.
