- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   In the summer of 2007, Jack and Meg embarked on a cross-country Canadian tour
   to accomplish their goal of performing in every province and territory across
   the expansive northern nation. Now, the band announces the release of a
   limited edition box set to commemorate that journey with a series of work
   capturing the striking live moments and poignant off-stage interactions of
   one of the world's most enigmatic bands. This captivating collection contains
   a DVD of the Emmett Malloy directed documentary film Under Great White
   Northern Lights, a live DVD of the band's 10th Anniversary show Under Nova
   Scotian Lights, as well as a double LP/CD of 16 live tracks, 7 inch on color
   vinyl, hardcover photography book and a silk-screened print.
