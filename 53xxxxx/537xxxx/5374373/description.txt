Subtract

Rising from an intro of abstract atmospherics alongside Two Step beats, Subtract pounds some elbow room into the crowded airwaves, introducing layers of bongos and sampled effects.

Old School Bristol bass lines and resonant synth keys sit firmly in the driving seat, accompanied by a thunderous sub bass as Subtract drops a bomb on the dance floor.


Giant Steps

Utilising an array of cinematic sound bites and short bursts of melodic textures, Giant Steps paints a sonic vision of an uncertain future as it creeps and crawls towards the drop.

Acid fuelled staccato synth bass lines and distorted 808 subs twist and turn alongside pounding Dub Step beats in this minimalistic dance floor smasher.
