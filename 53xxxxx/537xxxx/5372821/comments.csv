1. If this torrent is the same as yours then your torrent is labeled wrongly as E.M.DVD Copy v 2.7.2 WITH PATCH.
As you may know a patch is not the same as a regfile, and also the version number is incorrect.

2. Another wrongly labeled torrent is, for example: DVD neXt COPY Ultimate 4.0.2.8 LATEST.
In fact it should be DVD neXt COPY neXt Tech V4.0.2.8.

3. I don't get my torrents from TPB to post them there again.

4. It's not forbidden to post similar torrents.

5. For questions, help, and complaints use the forum: http://forum.suprbay.org/


My advise is to do your homework better before accusing and complaining. Also you should label your torrents
correctly and take note of the TPB rules. And last but not least: Consider doing something about your attitude, 
especially if you don't know what you're talking about."
