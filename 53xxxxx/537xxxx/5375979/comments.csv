[T],svdcekm,2010-02-19T11:25Z,hello dude... it is real and u can check the screenshots....
,-MajestiC-,2010-02-19T11:46Z,"It can't be real, look how small it is"
,amitha123,2010-02-19T13:54Z,It is real DVDrip pls seed................
,Tolle44,2010-02-19T16:56Z,"No, this is not real.

At least not DVD quality. The file is too small for it to store 3 hours of jolly good entertainment. Sorry!"
,spiral88,2010-02-19T18:27Z,"The screenshots seems to be good but you can see 
there is no seed..but still I can download it with my http speed..and every peer is seems to be stuck on 6.9%
so it fulfills all the criterias of being fake...
so do not download...you're just wasting your time..
nothing else.."
,amitha123,2010-02-20T04:42Z,"I played a bit, quality is good. It is a mkv file format."
[T],svdcekm,2010-02-20T06:30Z,it is real guys those who have trust on my upload download it...never judge a torrent with its file name or something else....
,blido1988,2010-02-21T01:03Z,Almost 3h of film compressed to 600MB... LoL
,weerab1981,2010-02-22T14:45Z,"its not good copy!
the film has been compressed too much..
it isnt bad if used on small screen like ipod or similar.
not worth d/ling if you want to watch on a screen bigger than your hand....


but thanks for the u/l"
,Shotgun_navi,2010-02-22T16:46Z,"waited so long to see a good quality avatar. downloaded but quality poor for such good film due to overcompression. not sure whether to watch it or not. @svdcekm, plz upload at least 1gb file with proper quality. i think i have to wait :)"

,Cikku,2010-03-11T12:50Z,"I have just downloaded it.. I'm not an expert but to me looks very good I would say...
 A = 8 V = 8
The images are clear and the audio is very good.
The only thing it didn't work is the FWD after about 3/4 of the film, but maybe that is only a problem with VLC player, otherwise the film works perfectly yill the end. It actualy looks better then the screen shots themselves to me.

Very good job SVDCEKM! 
Thanks for the upload!"
[T],svdcekm,2010-03-12T06:01Z,thanks cikku.....
