Turok is a comic book character initially in comics from Western Publishing published through licensee Dell Comics.  He first appeared in Four Color Comics #596 (October/November 1954), then graduated to his own title, Turok, Son of Stone, which would later be published by Gold Key.
The original comic was illustrated by Rex Maxon.  The writer-creator credit for the characters of Turok and Andar is disputed, with historians citing Matthew H. Murphy, Gaylord Du Bois and Paul S. Newman as the feature's earliest writers.  

The Western Publishing version of Turok was a pre-Columbian Native American who, along with his brother Andar, became trapped in an isolated valley populated by dinosaurs, which they refer to by their descriptive characteristics (Allosaurs are called "Runners", Pterosaurs are called "Flyers", Parasaurolophus are "Honkers", etc).  The Du Bois stories involve Turok and Andar seeking a way out.  Du Bois was influenced by his visits to Carlsbad Caverns New Mexico and developed the "Lost Valley" from his visits to the area.

After two appearances in Four Color #596 and #656, the title ran 27 issues (#3-29) from publisher Dell Comics (1956-62); then issues #30-125 (1962-80) from Gold Key Comics; and finally issues #126-130 (1981-82) back under the Whitman Comics imprint.  The first Turok one-shot (Four Color #596) was originally written by Du Bois as a "Young Hawk" story.  "Young Hawk" was an earlier Native American comic book feature Du Bois created, which appeared in Dell's The Lone Ranger comic-book series.
