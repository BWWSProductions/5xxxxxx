The Four Seasons is an American pop and rock group, with a sound somewhat reminiscent of doo-wop, although they were not thought of as actually being a doo-wop group. By the mid 1960s, they had become an internationally famous rock-and-roll act (the Vocal Group Hall of Fame has stated that it was the most popular white rock band before The Beatles). Since 1967, they have been known off and on as Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, though not identified as such on any of their records. (Wiki)
