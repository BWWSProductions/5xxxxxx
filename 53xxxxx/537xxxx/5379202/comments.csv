[V],twentyforty,2010-02-20T19:33Z,"@aks: Thanks. Just be patient, I am constantly under some kind of DoS attacks. I hope only temporary, before gremlins get tired or find other victim. Short Time is encoded and ready, probably be upped Sunday or Monday.

@hkoraddi: I have stated, earlier this week, that because Winter Olympics many shows are on the break. It has nothing with me, I simply follow what gets aired. Visit, for time being, http://tvrage.com and cross-reference their schedule with my latest Schedule.
Until TV schedule get stabilized, I see no point in making my own ""nightmare"" any stronger."

,Insomniacno1,2010-10-10T15:40Z,"Hi, just to let you know that there is a program called testdisk that can recover data from a broken down pc - I read on another of your torrents that you had a breakdown and lost some data.

After you have downloaded testdisk and unpacked it then run Photorec and set it only to those files you like to recover - otherwise it will take forever.  

testdisk has worked fine for me for several years now.
With kind regard
