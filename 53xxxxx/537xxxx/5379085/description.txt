WARNING: This CD requires DTS compatible equipment or software for playback (just about any DVD player). Don't play this on equipment that isn't compatible because you'll only hear static and it can damage your speakers!

This CD image contains CD-Text (a standard that allows disc and track information to be embedded on an audio CD). Burning a CD with CD-Text requires a compatible recorder and capable software (ImgBurn, Nero, iTunes, Toast).
CD-Text information will only be shown on CD-Text compatible players.
