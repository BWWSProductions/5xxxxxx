,ghostchildnn,2010-03-14T13:33Z,Not working on PS3 - I'm no expert but I'm thinking that it wont read 5.1 from a CD. Any suggestions? 
,ronmann,2010-12-05T11:12Z,"I'm having problems.  I play it with VLC, when ""encoded output"" is off, it plays fine but this means no DTS.  When I turn on ""encoded output"" the DTS light on my receiver comes on for second but VLC crashes.  I've screwed with the settings a bunch but same thing everytime.  I've had no problems in the past with this its possibly a bad rip.  Defiantly try for yourself though."
[T],ADHDerby,2010-12-12T20:19Z,"@ ghostchildnn: PS3 settings to play a DTS Audio CD:

Under Music Settings set Audio CD Output Frequency to: 44.1/88.2/176.4 kHz
Under Audio Output Settings select HDMI or Optical
Deselect LPCM 2ch 88.2 and 176.4 (leave only 44.1)
Save & Exit

@ ronmann: Burn the CD image on a CD-R or mount it with a virtual CD tool like Daemon Tools.
Then play the CD with VLC media player and it should play without a problem. :)"
