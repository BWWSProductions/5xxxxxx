TES: Daggerfall from 1996, later released as freeware by Bethesda, was and still is known for its bugs and enormous in-game world.
I included the 2.13 patch, as well as a savegame fixer and a quest/item add-on. All of them are official, and there are loads of unofficial utilities available out there.
You also probably need DosBOX to run the game. Burn it on a CD or mount it, either inside dosbox or using Daemon Tools. Instructions for this can be obtained at the DosBOX wiki. Also, an excellent source of information for all the Elder Scrolls games is www.uesp.net.
And seed, please. This is to my understanding a very rare game on the net.
