,Bumpbeefbeef,2010-02-19T13:37Z,"Anonymous does not mean you can upload without a username. It simply hides the username for other members. Moderators can still see who's behind the ""Anonymous"". 

and ""Anonymous"" isn't one person, it's a feature. Tick the Anonymous box when you upload and your username won't be shown for other members. "
