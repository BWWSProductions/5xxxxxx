Mark Condon is a very passionate individual concerning the ministry of music. His music has affected choirs, worship services and individuals all over the world. Choirs like Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, Christ Church Choir and artists such as Karen Wheaton, Bishop Clarence McClendon, Judy Jacobs, and many more have recorded and used his songs. Songs such as "I came to magnify", "Lord we give you glory", "There is a God", "Giving my best", and "You reign" in the last couple of years has powered its way through the churches all across this country because of the simple but strong messages they leave the church. Mark's desire is to create music that will usher people to a new level in their walk with God. Mark is a writer and arranger for Brentwood-Benson Music and also has recorded with Integrity Music on their Hosanna label to help provide more material for the Church.

Mark and his wife Carol have four children. Miquel, their daughter is 17, Jared is 15, Bryce is 11, and Chase is 7. They live in Lancaster, Ohio and both Mark and Carol for the past 14 years work as ministers of music at Turnpoint Church in Groveport which is a suburb of the Columbus Area.

If you ever have the opportunity to be in one of Mark's concerts, or sessions, we know that you will be blessed as you experience his enthusiasm and passion as he passionately ministers his heart.
