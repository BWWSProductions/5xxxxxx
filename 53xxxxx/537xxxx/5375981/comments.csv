,Zenit33,2010-04-14T10:03Z,"Legendary movie. However I recommend you download one of the bigger versions. This isn't a pretty movie already, and being 583mb (while being just over 2 hours) doesn't help with that. Also, about half-way through the audio becomes unsynced from the video by 1 sec. So it ruins (just a little bit) some of the most powerful speeches in film history"
