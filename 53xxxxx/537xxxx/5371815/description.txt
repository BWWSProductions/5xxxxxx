Collection of comic series based on the cult classic comedy horror film series.

Toxic Avenger 
The series focused on Toxie battling against the evil Apocalypse, Inc. and its demonic Chairman. The title was a mix of traditional superhero storytelling and satire, including the phrase "hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength" being repeated many times, and Toxie's "Tromatons" erupting when he was in danger similar to Spider-Man's spider-sense. Marvel's series also contained much in the way of "over-the-top," cartoonish violence. No other Marvel characters ever appeared in the series, and Toxie never made his way into any other Marvel comic, although a crossover with Marvel's Robocop title was planned before that series was cancelled.
The comic was written by Doug Moench, drawn by Rodney Ramos and Val Mayerik, and lasted for 11 issues.

Toxic Crusaders
Eight-issue comic book series based on the animated series featuring Toxie leading a trio of misfit superheroes to combat pollution.
