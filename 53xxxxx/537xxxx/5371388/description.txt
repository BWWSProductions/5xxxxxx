      It's Cliff from Cheers! Adrian and Christine were joined by
      actor John Ratzenberger. Following emails from One Show viewers,
      Dom Littlewood reported on the change of off-peak call time for
      British Telecom customers. In the studio, Dom answered more
      viewer emails. If you have a query you'd like Dom to consider,
      get in touch here. Gyles Brandreth continued his series looking
      at the stories behind famous paintings. Tonight he visited the
      ruins of Hadleigh Castle, which were painted by John Constable
      after his wife's death. Dan Snow looked back at Britain's gory
      history. Tonight it was... torture! And Paddy O'Connell got
      inside the heads of the nation's sporting mascots. Shrewsbury
      Town's Lenny the Lion, Swansea City's Cyril the Swan, Donnie The
      Dog from Doncaster Rovers and Donny and Mooie of MK Dons were
      all in the studio.
