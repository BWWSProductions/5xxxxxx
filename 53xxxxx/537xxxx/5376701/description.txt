Plot:
Newlyweds find the shirtless husband's sister on the Greek island which she went to two years ago. Also on the island are some inhospitable natives; a Shakespeare-quoting, sunken-treasure hunter and his voluptuous female companion; and a murderous, amphibious creature, which we don't see very much of. There you have the basics...and, there isn't a great deal more to spice things up. Oh...your enjoyment MIGHT be a LITTLE greater if you have a wet-shirt fetish. But other effects are virtually non-existent. With nothing, really, to bring it down, however, I sum it up as a passable yarn (or yawn, if you're a thrill-seeker).
