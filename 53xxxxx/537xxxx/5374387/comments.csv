good rating for a horror movie.

People with slow upload speeds
please wait until there are at 
least 4 stable seeders.In the end
you will get it faster."

,DEREKWILLY,2010-02-19T03:00Z,"you suck, your work is bad,shit"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-19T03:14Z,LOL
,mrhinter,2010-02-19T04:44Z,"just scanned through it, definitely watchable, audio seems good, based on my brief check id call it....

A:7.5
v:8.5 (for a TS)

good work, and a big thank you again two oh!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-19T06:54Z,"@mrhinter: People should see what was the input and how input looked like...namely, how looks only XviD TS available... let be honest and say A6/V3. Now is A6.5/V5.5, what makes TS at least - watchable. That IS the true purpose of any TS. Nothing more.
It was hard and long work, 12h of encoding through heavy restoration filters, unbearably slow and CPU heavy. Must I say - for FREE?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-19T10:47Z,@SAFC009: Rare pleasure to read friendly words from another uploader. Thanks.
,KeLLa787,2010-02-19T21:35Z,Thanks a lot.
,philtaylor007,2010-03-02T21:47Z,"you are very uptight for someone who is happy to break the law but not happy if someone happens to think your a twat
lol
get a grip mate and stop trying to pretend you are important
if you feck off and never upload another movie, hundreds of others will take your place
so take your list of downloading rules you like to post on your uploads and shove them up your arse
:-)"
