I know, I'm a day late, but it's up now. Here's Desert Moon Song by Dean Evenson, released in 1991. Unfortunately, its quality is not as good as that of the other 2 albums (128kbps), but hey, it's better than nothing. Hope you like it.

I'll stop with the new agefaggotry for now. I don't want to look like someone who owns a Prius.
