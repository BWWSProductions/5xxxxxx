      At the age of forty Dame Margot Fonteyn is considered to be past her
      best as a prima ballerina and Ninette de Valois is reducing her roles
      at the Royal Ballet. Then the exciting young Russian dancer Rudolf Nureyev,
      a recent defector to the West, comes into her life and her bed and
      revitalizes her career. Frederick Aashton creates a new ballet for them
      and they become the golden couple of the ballet world.
