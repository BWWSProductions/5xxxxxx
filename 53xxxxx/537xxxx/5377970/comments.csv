,grfam,2010-02-20T23:54Z,"sorry, i have a narrow bandwith so you can help me to accelarate the seeding process.
1) download:
Fuerteventura 
#/?d=SII8VP5K 
Lanzarote 
#/?d=802RFLA7 
La Palma 
#/?d=IGATZHJH 
Tenerife 
#/?d=RRPSYFA0 
Gran Canaria 
#/?d=XW5ZLIYQ"
,grfam,2010-02-20T23:54Z,"2) after you download these parts, open your utorrent window and stop the download of ""fsx - canary islands photoscenery"" (without removing, just stop it)
3) go to the folder where your utorrent client keeps partial downloads and find ""fsx - canary islands photoscenery"" folder"
,grfam,2010-02-20T23:58Z,"4) copy and paste downloaded from # parts, don't start utorrent yet!
5) go to the main window of utorrent, right click mouse and choose ""force re-check""
6) after the re-check is complete start seeding (just press start button), you'll still miss ""la gomera"" and ""el hierro"" parts
thanks for help! :)"

cheers! :)"
