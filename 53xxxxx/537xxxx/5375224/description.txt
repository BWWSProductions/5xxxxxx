Plot: The story follows sixteen year old Benjamin Purvis, who attends a conference for aspiring teenaged fantasy writers, and his opus â€˜Yeast Lordsâ€™ is shamelessly plagiarized by veteran, desperate, written-out fantasy novelist Ronald Chevalier. Benjamin (Michael Angarano), home-schooled by his eccentric mother (Jennifer Coolidge), is a loveable loner whose passion for writing leads him on an offbeat and hilarious journey as his story first gets ripped off by the legendary fantasy novelist, Ronald Chevalier (Jemaine Clement) and then is adapted into a disastrous movie by the small townâ€™s most prolific homespun filmmaker.
