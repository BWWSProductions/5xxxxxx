,viperrrr,2010-02-21T10:11Z,"@bricktophd

how do i get subtitles (.srt/.sup/etc.) to play with this movie? It seems to be impossible.. The quality is amazing and the size makes it more than perfect, but english subtitles are necessary for me. thank you for any advice you may have "
[T],bricktophd,2010-02-21T16:42Z,the subs are hard coded were non-english is spoken.
,Gethyper,2010-02-21T18:13Z,"@t Viperrr : To play Subtitles , just make a FOLDER , put the movie in it.....download the .SRT subfile......and put it in the same folder and make sure they BOTH have the SAME NAME. that wil make the subtitle automatically appears in Windows Player Classic"
,viperrrr,2010-02-22T09:39Z,"@bricktophd

Sorry, i wasn't being very clear. I know about the hard coded translation subs, but I meant subtitles for the english parts also, subtitles don't work with any of your uploads and its a must for my family (not very good at english). Im guessing maybe because its a .m2ts file, .srt subtitles are not supported. I have tried many players (wmp 11, vlc, etc.) It just doesn't work. Please help, I would greatly appreciate it. 

@Gethyper 

I know the method which you talk about, I have tried it many times and it just doesn't work, my main concern is not the PC. Afterall its a ps3 upload and I want to be able to veiw the subs on the ps3, or on the LED tv's own media player. 

MANY thanks in advance to anyone who can lend a hand."

,DGray978,2010-02-25T12:18Z,"@ viperrrr

I have the same problem.

PS3 cant play 2 files (the movie and the subtitle). In order to have the subtitle it has to be hardcoded into the movie, or you have to use some program on the PC and stream the files to the PS3. 

There is a PC program Aviaddxsubs that embeds the subtitles but it works only with .avi files. 

Unfortunatly, Sony still hasnt improved this issue (like the standard DVD players for the .srt files).

We can only hope that the movie will be ripped with its subtitles or wait. "
,viperrrr,2010-02-25T17:55Z,"Thank you for your reply DGray978/ Although i doubt Sony would ever condone piracy, we can only hope for support of external subtitles in the ps3. "

,Rodrigho,2010-03-07T17:20Z,"@viperrr

As a spanish speaker i had the subtitle problem myself too, yet i found a solution. I download a matching .srt file (usually those meant for bdrips of the same movie work pretty fine) and then i make a BD format disk to be played on my BD player (LGBD370)
What i do is: mux the .m2ts and the .srt (or more than one if you please) using tsMuxeX_1.10.6. You must do a BD Disc in some folder of your choice. This will create a two-folder structure, just as though it was a real BD. Then using Nero I make an UDF disc and place the exact same two folders I created previously, and you're done!
My BD player recognises it as a real BD and plays it perfect.
Note that this works on a PS3 as well BUT it doesn't show subtitles at all, I dont know why.
Hope this helps. cheers"

,Bunnes1105,2010-03-10T20:31Z,very good one thx a lot =) could I just ask with which program the ps3-team is ripping the movies to get this size and the format m2ts??? thx ;)
,BrokenEmpires,2010-03-14T10:45Z,"If any of you have problems watching HD mp4 or mkv files such as this one. 
And you already tried VLC media player then:
Download and install K-Lite Codec pack (Mega)
http://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_mega.htm
It includes media player classic which is very light on cpu power.
If you have Win 7 make sure you enable the DivX H.264 decoder.
After install under tools folder open Win7DSFilterTweaker.
Change decoders from 'microsoft' default option.
That's the key to playing back HD videos. 
Thanks for seeding."

,Brookie01,2010-04-14T13:18Z,"how do i play on my ps3, i put it on there it does not reconise?"
,mad_mark1,2010-04-18T11:38Z,ffs i dl this and tried to remux it to put the frame rate back up to 24000/1001 and set it to over right but it screwed up and i was left with a 5 sec clip and now have to re dl it :( 
,mad_mark1,2010-04-18T14:40Z,just realized that 24000/1001 is Framerate......: 24fps. and summet else messed up so ignore what i said. the file is small due to the audio its no longer dts but that's OK as i have the dts file

,renaudparisfrance,2010-05-15T19:35Z,"I have got to apologize....
For months i was saying that a divx was worth enough of a blu ray to watch on a computer screen..
But today i watched 2012 for the first time in Blu ray.. and waouhhhhhhh 

the movies are huge.. but worth downloading.

,MrBigglesw0rth,2010-06-10T08:03Z,"@renaudparisfrance

What the fuck are you talking about? You are confused on more than one level. 

DiVX and XviD are compression codecs. Blue Ray is not a codec. It is a fancy name for a storage medium. 

You can get a 1080i down to 4g (or even 2gb) with Xvid or DivX. But they wont look near as good as h.264 (esp at the lower bitrates).

Next your dumbass is going to tell us how much better .avi is than dvd format! Make fucking sense, motherfucker!"
,MrBigglesw0rth,2010-06-10T08:05Z,"By the way to the encoders/bricktophd, I uprated this to +3. 

1080i should be 4GB as a torrent. This is a practical size for the resolution as a non-raw."
,raj2020,2010-06-26T09:10Z,I found problems playing with VLC & WMP. But after installing K-Lite Codec Pack it goes well with windows classic player. THANKS bricktophd....
,5yuma5,2010-09-11T23:39Z,I am having troubles with the subtitles. During the points where the french people speak there is supposed to be subtitles however I cannot seem to locate the option as I usually do...

,XHandHeld,2010-10-08T03:03Z,need higher bitrate
,Steven_7,2012-01-15T10:53Z,Thank you bricktop :) ... this 2012.m2ts movie have really good quality although it's only have 4 Gb... nice works... I hope that you continue your good works this year :)
