[V],GoodFilms,2010-02-19T01:09Z,Bitrate is waay too low for that resolution.
[T],zeromancer,2010-02-19T02:46Z,"some uploaders don't care if the picture looks shitty as long as the size is low.

Been waaaaaay too many of these uploaders.

CMCT, kriss_kringle, 3Li are the worst of that pack.

There should be an own section for these videos; like Micro HD or Shitty HD.

A bitrate of 4000kbps should be a minimum to be allowed in the Highres section.

Too bad for those people who enjoy watching a movie with good picture quality when this shit floods TPB.

,TommyBlade2018,2010-02-19T02:54Z,Thanks FXG Team
,TommyBlade2018,2010-02-19T02:56Z,"Well FXG Team Said They'll Do A BD once In A while And Want Feeback

Can't Agree More With Goodfilms & HR

Appreciate The Effort"
,oldSMfan,2010-02-19T04:31Z,"OK, here are my thoughts [I'm no xpert so please bear with me!]

1StT, yes, bitrate is too low for this res. Even for a 1280x544, which is what is found quite often nowadays.

2ND, HolyRoses, yr ULs are xellent, so whoever it was that ""slammed"" u they probably do not know much about this.

3RD, @zeromancer, I always say that if you are going to criticize, please make sure u can do better!

4TH, I believe CMCT, kriss_kringle, 3Li & others do an xellent job! Quality's perfect for the size they achieve. REMEMBER: ""Not every1 has got unlimited Internet quota!"" So size DOES matter for a lot of PPL out there!

Lastly, the FXG_team did mention this is relatively NEW field for them. So b a little understanding, or did U get everything right the first time?

:O("
[V],FXG_team,2010-02-19T09:12Z,"To all the people above , they are right about the BitRate !!
But a bitrate of 4000 kbps it will take atleast 3 days for me to upload , its not  possible .
So this will be propably my rip size if i ever make bdrips!"
,oldSMfan,2010-02-19T10:42Z,"FXG_team try 2000?

:O)"

Well, ignorant brat. Download my torrent of The Cell before posting nonsens. But you are obviously to dumb to figure out that I've actually already uploaded HD content that beat the pants of CMCT and the other semi-HD uploaders on TPB. God damn n00b.


@CMCT, I dl a couple of your torrents and they look smudged and the detail is not sharp enough. And that is ofcourse the result of LOW bit rate. But of course if you watch this on a crappy TV or your Iphone it will ofc look decent.
So please stop accusing me of not knowing how your torrents look. I know all too well.
Making a BD rip fit a DVDR disc is the absolute minimum... if the movie is more than 60min long.

Have a nice day."

Perhaps make it FXGs next HD upload? :)

Thanks guys!!"
,Anaclause,2010-02-25T16:10Z,i can't open this Mkv file!!! what program do i need to watch this???? pls help!!!
,Bean-Bandit,2010-03-01T02:46Z,Why even call this a BDrip? The quality is so low. Any why should people worry about space size with all the HD Media Players out on the market
,Elegy,2010-03-04T01:12Z,"I would love a regular 700-900 MB avi-file of District 9 from team FXG. For some strange reason no one want to deliver a standard high quality 700 Mb DvDrip of this excellent movie!

Since this was an experiment BDrip (gone wrong) I put my hope for FXG to make a stardard DvDrip in the usual superior format.

FXG team you rule!"
,khmerog,2010-03-08T05:53Z,"all i have to say to you nerds who is slamming these uploaders is:

IF YOU WANT HD STUFF THEN GO BUY THE BLU RAY.

other than that shut up. a blu ray holds over 25 GB, these files are max 1/10 that. so what do you expect. go download bigger files then and stop your geek whining.

Thank you for uploaders such as FXG, 3Li, HolyRoses etc. for there HD rips under 2.5 GB."
,turbojl,2010-03-08T19:49Z,"Personally, I think the quality is pretty good on this rip.  I think you're not far off on resolution, could drop some, and raise the bitrate a little and I think it would all fit into a still nice file size for HD screens."

You are a Joke!

You claim to be some expert HD uploader....

First of all The Cell is one of the worst movies ever made!

Secondly - you uploaded an ""HD Rip"" without 5.1 audio, thats just retarded and defeats the purpose! ye ye youve added a link to how to get 5.1 but it just aint good enuff.

CMCT, kriss_kringle and 3Li are 10 times betta than you and always will be.

Personally i don't like MKV so i tend to stick to secretmyth (MP4) and PS3-TEAM (M2TS) for my HD Rips. check there rips out and learn a thing or two!

I kno exactly what you will say to respond...""shut up because you haven't even uploaded anything""

I choose not to for two reasons 

1. i dont have the time

2. The stuff i want is already available from trusted uploaders

Instead i give back by seeding the torrents i download and appreciate.

Maybe you should think about taking a seat because you clearly dont know what you are doing!

Rant over, peace"
