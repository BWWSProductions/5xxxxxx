The other day I needed to use Windows 7 which I have on another partition, and I realised it's just as bad as Vista.  Yeah the candy is there and the layout of older options are where you expect them, but I had to click 101 mouse clicks for what should be one to three clicks of the mouse to do what I wanted.  Then the editing ability of the mouse selection and was atrocious.  IE8 was also sending me trippy.

I recommend Win7 for those that must have gaming and windows, but if not, just save the money and get Ubuntu or another Linux distribution."
