,someonegotmyusername,2010-02-21T06:29Z,"i have found a few good torrent sites lately. the one who uploaded this is brilliant. i have been a long time fan of pb but my days are nearly done. it is easily the slowest site i visit ever and allowing hackers and spyware sites to promote here full time is really getting on my nerves. how much money are you gonna cost people pb??. how hard is it to disable links in comments?. i am starting to believe you run the scam sites aswell. consider yourself under suspicion i will be commenting on my very trafficked toob channel very soon. your inaction reeks of complicity. how much does this human scum pay you?. ur site is so retarded i have pushed post 33 times now on this comment. ""database error my ass. you make enough money to run this piece of shit properly. fukkin do it you scam artists"
,germk4,2010-02-21T15:28Z,"I fully agree with someonegotmyusername just look at this tripe, even the ""quality"" of the spam is reeking of diminish here. The spambot states a-5, v-6 then states he watched it @getfapped, then precedes with watch more quality there, it makes me wanna stick a prong handle in my peen hole. "
,nikar692,2010-02-21T20:16Z,"ecellent quality. good way to spend a sunday evening, i'd say

,faqup,2010-02-21T21:22Z,"good point someonegotmyusername, I am behind you on that one, I rarely use PB anymore, and the one time I do, I see your comment, it is a sign, now I am very appreciative of my Demonoid account, no spammers, no bullshit, the grass is greener over here"
,signalcorps,2010-02-23T08:02Z,"the pirate bay is a tracker folks.  they take no responsibility for spammers or their bogus sites.  in the end the responsibility relies with you alone to protect yourself.  if you cant tell spam from user comments or whether or not to trust a site or whatever, I feel sorry for you.  the best advice i can give you is don't click on unknown links or paste unknown url's into your browser.  simple right? geez..."
,TaiTheGuy,2010-02-23T11:04Z,"My viewpoint represents only the first 17 minutes or so but DAMN!!! This is 1 of the most entertaining documentaries I've seen since... Dare I say ""Loose Change""??? K, not that far but at least maybe... ""High Price Of Low Cost"" (Wal-Mart Docu).

Many thanks seeders!"
