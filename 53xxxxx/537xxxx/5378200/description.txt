Can you hear it?
Calling for subjective attention...
Mimic me, it says...
Study the place where we all come together.
Then...
Watch it fall apart.
Lost But aware...
Attempt to...
Reassemble

The Caduceus Saga:
Sometimes a person will go through something, even the briefest of encounter, and they will find themselves on an eerie path with many turns. Armed only with the light in their heart and the post-encounter feeling that there is something more to what is perceived, they may embark on a journey of self-understanding and healing. They may be part of their own Caduceus Saga.
