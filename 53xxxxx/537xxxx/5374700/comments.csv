[T],eXPer1ence,2010-02-20T01:41Z,"You should come back Antje14 :p I found an ace tune a while ago, can't remember it though.

Folks, this TinyXP needs this command running if you want to create Quick Launch:

Start > Run > cmd > enter > paste this in >

MD ""%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch""

Or just make the Quick Launch folder here:

C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch"

So does this pass WGA? My system is too old and crappy to switch to any steamlined Vista or 7 (also, I want to run stuff that doesn't so much like them)."
,travkin,2010-02-22T15:48Z,"TinyXP could not start the Windows Firewall by default.

To get rid of this error, open Command Prompt (Start > Run > cmd) and run:

I cant add the quick launch panel and secondly it seems like the settings for the taskbar doesn't get saved when I restart my computer.

Any ideas?"

,shyamsundaronline,2010-02-26T07:06Z,"WoW... Awesome work man. Been looking for the smallest XP installation for years, at last a 109mb XP iso!! Previously I was using a 175mb xp.

Could you please make a tiny version of windows 7 with aero. I recently saw a vista lite edition(with aero theme) under 700mb. So i don't think W7 will be a problem.

Anyway, Thanks for you great work."
,partypar2,2010-02-26T09:16Z,"@ snakeboy69 : No, iTunes does not work in TinyXP either. On both versions iTunes crashes after it starts. Event viewer shows an error in the ipod and bonjour services which is related to the crash. 

And MicroXP is the smallest version in this pack, if you were wondering. Says it in the description. "
,Hook599,2010-02-26T15:51Z,"Thank you for this wonderful work!!! I have an issue with my usb dvb-t stick though.Works just fine in Tiny,but not in Micro.Any ideas anyone??"
,Gabeli,2010-02-26T21:19Z,"MicroXP runs at the speed of light. Congratulations. No problems with games. No problems accessing others PC and being accessed in LAN, file & print sharing. Anyway OS crash at the end of Avira Personal installation but after this the installation can be finished using the ""change/repair"" option at ""Add or Remove Programs"".  Microsoft Access 2003 could not being installed but who cares as long you are not running apps that uses access databases.

Great Work. Thanks.

PS: Soon I will test TinyXP rev 10 and I will write a comment after that."
,Naraku77,2010-02-27T14:00Z,"Interesting, I had thought for sure we had seen your last Windows 5 release with that last DVD (loved it btw).  I thought you had abandoned Windows 5 for Windows 7.  Apparently not.  Well, it's good to see a new version (especially when it includes a Full, with Japanese left in, for the import gamers -- and nearly everyone I've ever shown an Ys or Touhou game is an import gamer now, they always want a copy, lol).  I'm sure I'll have a need for good old XP x86 eventually this year (for me it's all been 7 installs so far, but it's only February).  So it's good to see you're keeping it updated.  Thanks.  Your x86 releases are easily the best (now if we could just get you to do more x64)."

You were missed during your hiatus, hopefully your time in the real world helped you recharge.  

Your efforts are appreciated."
,skulldragon,2010-03-12T23:46Z,"Tiny- and MicroXP are like Linux - work only on good computers with common good hardware.

They both failed to support my Realtek's sounddriver. Not only sound driver wasn't supported, but my Intel motherboard driver installer program said that I don't even have Intel motherboard.
Thus the full XP supported all drivers fine.

And again, I noticed something wierd even with this XP: they (/eXPer1ence) know how to handle registry and remove all unnessesary shit, but remote administration access was left open and SYN attacks receiving was also enabled by firewall. I don't know whatelse could be hiding in this XP, but I recommend that you use a professional firewall like ZA to be sure taht nothing is going out that isn't supposed to go out."
,sxp64,2010-03-15T10:34Z,"You left out QuickLaunch and some other config changes you used to put in Tiny XP. Seems like you've released it a little too soon, but I understand the pressure. ;-) Other than that, great work again!"

I've been waiting so much for this .. since the 2008 Christmas Edition ..
I just installed the micro choice and everything is working more than great .. 
just one problem .. I installed the Arabic language just like I was installing it with every other version .. 
now my firefox write and read arabic perfectly .. but all my folders in Arabic are wrote backwards from left to right (that's backwards in Arabic)
and when I type in arabic in a text document I get tiny squares instead of letters .. 
any suggestions
thank you so much .. "
,teamworks,2010-03-18T14:40Z,"Hi, I was just wondering.. the title says TINY XP... then why is the size 1.75 GB?? Is it only 1 OS or multiple OS? Thanks for answering"
,sxp64,2010-03-21T13:02Z,"Hmm.. I burned and verified the burned DVD, but it found a corrupted line 6419 of hivesys.inf and couldn't finish setup, also devenum.dll and some other dlls could not be found (or properly decompressed). Seems the stuff is way too tight on the iso. I'll try making a separate CDR iso from just the TinyXP source first, and will see how that goes. So far it's not a good image.

Do you have an MD5 or SHA for the iso?"
[T],Antje14,2010-03-21T20:57Z,"@sxp64  
Burn it at the lowest speed possible"
,sxp64,2010-03-21T23:18Z,I already did that. And by the way; http://club.myce.com/f86/cant-burn-1x-91909/
,sxp64,2010-03-22T00:32Z,"OK, the result of creating and using the separately burned 699 MB iso from TinyXP 10 is the same;
Line 6419 of hivesys.inf is corrupted.
Whatever this is, it points to bit-rot on experience's harddrives while he created this.

There is no MD5 or SHA code to be found either, meaning the file is probably even corrupted as an upload.

This is a shitty iso, not very well tested and with way too much compression on the iso content."

But this time, my Anti-virus is having a seizure with 2 files in the iso. runQFE.exe and another one, named greenmk.exe  Both files are located in

My anti-virus says they are both rootkit. Now, I dont know if its a false positive and I am pretty sure its not your fault (eXPer1ence) you might want to look into it. (Detected by Avast! P2P shield)"
,brownstem,2010-06-02T09:14Z,"Would any of these installations work for an old Dell Inspiron 3500 with a PII processor and 192MB of RAM? I actually have XP Pro on there now (it had 98SE orginally and then 2000) but it takes forever to load, shut down, or do anything else. I'm hoping Tiny or Micro will work. Any tips appreciated. (Also, can I assume no serials are needed? Thx.)"
,brownstem,2010-06-04T09:56Z,"OK, well I'm in the process of answering my own question. I installed MicroXP with the driver pack on my old Dell Inspiron 3500 without issue. My problem now is that I can't seem to install a PCMCIA wireless card. When I pop it in I get the new hardware wizard but it doesn't seem to know what it is. I have the XP driver for it in a folder on the desktop. I've tried directing it manually to that folder saying the new hardware is either a PCMCIA controller or a Network Adapter. Neither works. Any ideas? The card worked great when I had the old and very slow full XP Pro installed. Thanks."
