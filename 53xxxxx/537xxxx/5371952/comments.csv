,EpicPlayer,2010-03-04T21:59Z,"OMG the download speed is truly awsome!
Feels like hundreds of people are seeding to me at the same time!!
Every other torrent is just NEVER truly represented by the ""seeders"" number.

Oldest game I've ever played and truly enjoyed...

But these people are seeding because this game is simply IMMORTAL!"
,Obsilion,2010-03-08T00:53Z,"The download speed is great, but the file doesn't seems to be working. In fact, I can't extract the files from the .RAR document... :/"
,Obsilion,2010-03-08T00:57Z,"Forget what I just said. You can extract it with WinRAR, but not WinZIP. Thanks for the share!"
,shibby45,2010-03-20T20:09Z,Watch this file. There's a trojan in it. My computer has been infected.

Trojan Horse is a detection name used by Symantec to identify malicious software programs that masquerade as benign applications or files. 

Trojan horse programs pose as legitimate programs or files that users may recognize and want to use. They rely on this trick to lure a user into inadvertently running the Trojan. Often a Trojan will mimic a well known legitimate file name or pose as a particular type of file, like a .jpg or .doc file to trick a user.

,sotegihe,2010-10-03T16:26Z,"@summonedtitan

Why would someone click a fucking .jpg file?

Its a game, you simply launch the .exe file and game starts. No virus or malware, check comments and get a life."
