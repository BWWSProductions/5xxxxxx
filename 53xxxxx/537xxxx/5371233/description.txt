The album gives credit to the two stars of the film; John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, although they only appear on seven of the 24 tracks. The remainder of the album is sung by various cast members and Sha Na Na - a group who performed many of the 1950s numbers in the film. The title track was recorded by Frankie Valli, who had no other connection with the film.
The most successful songs from the soundtrack were written specifically for the film. They included the Billboard number-one hits "You're the One That I Want", "Grease" and the number-three, Academy Award-nominated "Hopelessly Devoted to You".
In the UK, the album proved even more successful where "You're the One That I Want" reached No.1 for nine weeks, "Summer Nights" reached No.1 for seven weeks, while "Grease", "Hopelessly Devoted to You" and "Sandy" all became top three hits. The soundtrack album hit the top of the charts in the U.S. during the summer of 1978, replacing The Rolling Stones' Some Girls. In the UK, it remained a the top of the charts for 13 consecutive weeks.
