,nzfrog,2011-05-24T04:57Z,"I*'m sure I'm not stupid, but I followed the sparse instructions and it asks for a key after all of that.  Sorry this seems not to work unless you're psychic and figure out what is missing from instructions."

,WldHrt,2012-07-07T19:12Z,"This version works perfectly. I downloaded both the 9.0+ ones and they crashed my computer every time I tried to use the controls. No virus or anything, just some kind of bug in the programme itself, but the 6.0+ version is perfect. No crashing, same controls, just an earlier version. I recommend this one over any of the later 9+ versions until the company that makes this software fixes the bugs, THANKS so much for the great upload!"
