1. Install SC2 Beta (not supplied) , u can find it onor piratebay, it's called "StarCraft II Beta enUS 13891 Installer". I have this version

2. Now overwrite my Battle.net.MPQ (supplied) to your install folder something like .....StarCraft II BetaBattle.net

3. Now make sure u have  hidden files and folders shown and go to C:Usersyour!usernameAppDataLocalBlizzard EntertainmentBattle.net and make sure you !delete! the folder Cache and !replace! it with the one in the archive named CacheComplete.rar

4. Stay tuned for the next step.

5. Now go to C:UsersJohnnyWalkerDocumentsStarCraft II BetaReplaysMultiplayer . U will probably not have this folder, just create Replays folder and inside Multyplayer folder, and there u will extract the Recent.zip file (also supplied).


!This works for W7 and Vista probably and u should manage to find the corespondent in Xp as well C:documents and settings instead of C:Users and my documents instead of documents.

NOW GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN! And thank the ones who made it possible.
