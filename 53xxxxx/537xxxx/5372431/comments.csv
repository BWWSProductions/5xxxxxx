,colbyfizzle,2010-10-21T09:26Z,"Thank you!!  Game runs great, and is a lot of fun, better than diner dash in my opinion.  Couldn't figure out how to install the full game at first, but then saw the installation instructions that you posted as a comment.  With instructions was very simple to replace the demo file.  Thanks again, I couldnt find this game anywhere else!"
