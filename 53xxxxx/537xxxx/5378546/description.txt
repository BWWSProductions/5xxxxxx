A new documentary by Stuart MacDonald is about his journey to look like the guy (Jeff Willet) in fitness ads. What does it really take to become ripped like a bodybuilder? I Want To Look Like That Guy answers the question by following Stuart through 6 months of training that tests the limits of his mind, body, family and friends as they watch him trim down from 30% body fat to under 6% body fat. You won't believe what it really takes to look like that guy!
