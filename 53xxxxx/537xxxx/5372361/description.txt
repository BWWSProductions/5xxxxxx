IMAGiNE NOTES

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

Right where to start lol...........Sources used, Video=russian dvd5, Audio=mentions intro, ghostmans main film and russian audio for end credtis....

Work done......well firstly ripped and tweaked the R5 DVDR .....but did notice that alot of releases seem to look pink,but when we fixed this you got other scenes looking too green lol. Anyway we tried to find a inbetween the best we could.

Audio now for this we needed to used all 3 sources to get a complete audio file......once we created our new audio file it was just a case of syncing it up, which was a bitch and 14cuts later we got pretty close so :)

Anyway thanks to all sources and enjoy.
