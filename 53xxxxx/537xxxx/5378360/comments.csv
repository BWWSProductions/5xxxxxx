This version lacks IQ routes.  Just FYI for those downloading."
,silviore,2010-03-04T15:09Z,"There was a wrong meta... I put the correct one.
The map is with IQr/ALG/etc/cspeech...

This is not the map for 2GB devices.

The difference size between a NAmerica 2Gb and NAmerica is only for different compression, less details (laks, river, railways) NOT less coverege.
If you have space problems, and if you ar not intersted to the voice you can gain 310MB deleting the cspeech file."
