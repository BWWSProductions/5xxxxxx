Laser

Building from an intro of layered percussion and analogue atmospherics, Laser twists and turns with increasing venom before reaching a drop that delivers a serious amount of jump up Drum & Bass pressure. Filtered synths, dirty beats and chunky sub-bass propel this debut in to the heart of the dance floor.



The Horror

Living up to its name, The Horror oozes panic stricken synth tones and bit crunched effects that battle to create an ominous intro vibe. The resonating bass stabs and heavy sub bass groove over floor pumping kicks and sleazy snares in this slice of upfront Dubstep dance floor mayhem.
