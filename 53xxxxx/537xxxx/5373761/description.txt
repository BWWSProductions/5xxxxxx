Gold medal pre-race favorite Petra Majdic, cross-country skier from Slovenia, won bronze in women's 1.4 km individual classic sprint Cross Country after disastrous fall during her training. Majdic won her bronze against all odds. After winning the medal, Majdic collapsed in pain at the finish line and had to be carried off the course.

Despite the debilitating pain Majdic endured after the fall, she decided to compete and finished the qualifying round 19th and was then immediately taken to the hospital for X-rays. Luckily, she suffered no internal injuries and none of her ribs were broken. After the hospital visit, Majdic returned to the cross-country course to finish the sprint.

Cheered on by spectators, athletes and coaches from all countries, Majdic gave her all. Given the quarter-finals, semi-finals and the final of the cross-country competition, her courageous victory reminds us once again of the incredible, unconquerable Olympic spirit the champions are made of. To win against all odds is not a miracle. It is a conscious decision of an athlete to finish the job in spite of all the incapacitating agony and pain.
