NXE2GOD v1.1

Fixed bug where some games would potentially not convert properly due to files not being moved to the correct place.
Minor speed increase.
Itâ€™s basically a bug fix version but I do recommend updating to it as it should be more reliable and stable.

For those that do not know NXE2GOD runs on your 360 and will convert any games youâ€™ve installed with NXE to Games on Demand packages so you no longer need to insert the disk.
