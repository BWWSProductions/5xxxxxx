Note about virus warnings: If you get a trojan or virus warning then it's a false positive! - I've added nothing!! You get exactly the same warning when you download and install the update/trial because it's exactly the same setup.
I only removed and modified some files to disable MoovieLive, Movie Remix and RichVideo and to make it pre-activated!
