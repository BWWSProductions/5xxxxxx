This is a "directors cut" hybrid version of the NBC and CTV broadcasts of the Olympic Opening ceremonies. It combines the NBC HD video with the CTV audio and also fills in places that NBC cut to go to commercial break.

I've separated it into 6 parts so you can choose whichever part you want to see:

Part 1 - Beginning to Athletes Entrance (21:11 min)
Part 2 - Brian Adams and Nelly Furtado (Bang Your Drum) (4:34 min)
Part 3 - Aboriginal Segment, Sarah McLaughlin, Fiddle/Tap Dance segment (26:46 min)
Part 4 - Prairies segment to "Truth North" poem. (17:56 min)
Part 5 - Speeches to K.D. Lang "Hallelujah" (22:00 min)
Part 6 - Olympic flag, indoor and outdoor torch lighting. (37:52 min)

The only segment not included is the athletes entrance.
