Ray Gosling's all over the news today ... so here's
one of his recent documentaries

BBC Blurb
Half a century ago, teddy boys were the first great,
post war British youth cult. Teds were stylish, loud
and occasionally violent, and evidence that the grey
world of austerity and rationing was on the verge of
a big change.

Ray Gosling was one of Britain's first teddy boys, and
in this programme he returns to his home town, Northampton,
attends a rock and roll dance, and meets the barber who
gave him his first quiff. 

He also addresses the other side of the teddy boy cult,
their involvement in the 1958 Notting Hill riots.
