,lilars26,2010-02-18T01:25Z,"Hi 20-40.

Sorry to hear about your accident.They say the bathroom is the most dangerous room in the house.Right?

Other uploaders say that there is 27 secs. missing from'Legion'because of security issues.Do you know what that is about?

Take care of yourself.Maybe Jack can help with the pain."
,the_shroud,2010-02-18T04:08Z,Get well bro

Tons of morons out there, many are furious.
Btw, do you know what Legion means, mythology behind?
It looks like all creeps wants to see how it should be, according to legends of human kind.

It?s 27 seconds of speech that it changes to Russian between Michael and Gabriel, then there?s a period where there is no talking in the movie and then switches back to English for the next talking part before the movie ends.

What if: they spoke Angelic, or whatever, just not to be understandable to others.

I have no problems with any language, nor with a color of th skin. All people are brothers.

It should make people curious about unlearned things, in any language. Only small part of the people speaks English, it's not written in stone that English is a - must, it just happens to be most dominant language on Internet. 

So, if subtitle file for that few sentences pops-out, I'll include it in the future torrent.

I know the word legion in the biblical sense
as I was raised Roman Catholic.I guess that
you have your own demons messing with
your uploads.English speaking people,such as I, 
should feel priviliged that it is the most
predominate language on the internet.I never
thought about that before.
Well,have a good day and may your demons be few."
