reason to be is to provide: 'Cultural news from home
and abroad, covering film, fashion, books and theatre'.

This edition is devoted to Lou Reed.

From the programme's preamble:
'The man is a notoriously grumpy interviewee. Don't talk
about his songs. Don't talk about his life. And definitely
don't talk about his former drug habit. Cross the line and
the interview's over. That's if he shows up in the first
place ... but when I was offered thirty minutes in his
company, it was too good to turn down.'
