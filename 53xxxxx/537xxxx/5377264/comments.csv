[V],twentyforty,2010-02-20T07:25Z,"@rnra: Change your tone (tune)... please. Past Life NEVER entered my schedule. Past Life pilot was upped because I tend to up the pilot episodes. Ep. 2 was up 'cause of free slot.

I am tolerant now ONLY because I know that you are regular here and I know that we all have bad days,

...BUT, never forget to say plain, common ""Please"". Not just to me..."
