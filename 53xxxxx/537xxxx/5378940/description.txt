This Is the Remix is a remix album by American R&B group Destiny's Child. The album's name is a self explanatory message taken from the first track "No, No, No" Part 2 and is a collection of their remixes. The album consists of a blend of R&B and dance remixes recorded from 1997 to 2002. The album was released on March 8, 2002 (see 2002 in music) and debuted and peaked at number 29 on the U.S. Billboard 200. 
The album is a collection of the most relevant remixes of Destiny's Child (and some bonus tracks). It is especially notable for containing several resung remixes. The first of these resung remixes (and their first "remix" ever), "No, No, No (Part II)" is present on this collection. Other major urban remixes that have been resung include "Say My Name (Timbaland Remix)", "Bootylicious (Rockwilder Remix), "Bug A Boo" (Refugee Camp Remix), and "Emotion (Neptunes Remix)". In terms of major urban remixes that have not been resung, the album also collects the "Survivor (Remix)" which features Da Brat. The album is not completely littered with R&B remixes, and features dance remixes mainly remixed by Maurice Joshua. His remixes on this album include "Bills, Bills, Bills" (Maurice's Xclusive Livegig Mix)", "Nasty Girl (Azza's Nu Soul Mix)", and "So Good (Maurice's Soul Remix)". In terms of other dance mixes, the album also contains a dance/rhythmic remix of "Dot (E-Poppi Mix)". As mentioned above, the album also contains some bonus tracks that don't quite fit the traditional mold of a strictly dance or R&B remix. First, the album contains a remix medley of "Jumpin' Jumpin'" that blends the So So Def Remix of the song featuring original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson with the Maurice's Jumpin Retro Mix in a nonstop, but seamless hybrid. This mix of the song is a rare remix exclusive only to this album; it also contains vocals by Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin. The album goes on with the bonus tracks by including "Independent Women (Part II), which is supposed to be the second part of the song (but ironically, this part was written before "Independent Women (Part I)". The album finally reaches closure and ends with a relative oddity, Michelle Williams's first single from her first album, the gospel influenced "Heard A Word" with a distinct sax sound which was later removed for the album version.
