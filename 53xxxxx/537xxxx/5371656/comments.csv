glenn beck Glenn Beck runs without ads in UK for four straight days, activists sayAn American political advocacy group aimed at empowering black voices in politics announced Tuesday that the British broadcast of Fox News' Glenn Beck show was forced to run without any paid advertisers last week after the last of the program's corporate sponsors bailed.

""With the latest group of defections from Beck's overseas broadcast, Fox News Channel was forced to fill commercial breaks with news headlines and local weather updates from its U.K.-based sister network, Sky News, instead of paid advertisements,"" the website StopBeck.com announced. The site is a project of ColorOfChange.org. "

,hayesy316,2010-02-18T03:16Z,"Yeah, Fox really need to worry about their ratings at the moment. Talk about being out of touch with reality..."
,protongeek,2010-02-18T03:25Z,Sonews unfortunately I dont see how Glenn Becks popularity outside our country really matters to him ? What I do see is a pathetic attempt to down play a true conservative who knows his history all to well. In fact even if you were a history professor at lets say Princeton Id still say he knows more than you ever will due to the fact you look at all things through your liberal straw. So good luck to you and your Communist morons. Someday when the revolution decides to embrace non voting means people like you will be in very short supply.

Because of a Patriot such as yourself I and many of my freinds are able to listen to Rush. We thank you!"
,darkencypher,2010-02-18T20:18Z,"Thanks for the upload.  And I think its great how sonews is touting how effective his liberal THOUGHT POLICE are at bullying.  He(she?) holds up those stagnant, socialist European-style ""utopias"" as a model for the U.S.  If it wasn't for our deeply ingrained history and culture of free speech, the liberal P.C. censorship mafia would have already silenced us.
