,harigata,2010-03-20T22:11Z,"I gave you the -1 quality.
Audio out of synch."
,Smidgens,2010-06-06T15:35Z,How do I remove the audio commentary playing over the movie? It's kind of annoying.
,swanbrown,2011-02-02T01:29Z,"Good one. 
Man, I tell ya; Just give Terry Gilliam an Idea, and a bunch of clear plastic wrap, and STUFF GETS DONE!

Anyway, This played clean and quick for me.  Like was said above, the audio is easily adjusted on VLC (Tools/Effects and filters/ Synchronization/Advance of audio over video.  -0.4)
Easy Peasy,  Cough and Sneezey ."
,confundled,2011-02-17T12:44Z,"This might be asking a lot, but can anyone explain a bit about all these different file types? I use media player, and have had a few problems with incompatible file types etc.  Also, why are there such differences in file size? I really don't know much about any of this, so any help or advice would be great. "
,xanticore,2011-04-07T08:44Z,"Thanks! Such a great movie.

On VLC player use the F and G keys on the keyboard to adjust audio sync. You want to shift the audio by about -400ms."
