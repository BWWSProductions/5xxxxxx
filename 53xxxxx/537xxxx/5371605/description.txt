BBC Radio 2 - The Mike Harding Folk Music Show - Wed 17th Feb 2010


Mike Harding presents an hour of the very best in folk, roots and acoustic music including news from the world of folk and the latest album releases.

Plus, an interview with Jude Abbott and Boff Whalley from Chumbawamba whose new album ABCDEFG is released this week. This, the band's 17th album, is another concept album ('concept' as in 'idea') and is full of ideas specifically about music. 

Music both good and bad, music celebrated and music ridiculed. They support the album with a UK tour in March.
