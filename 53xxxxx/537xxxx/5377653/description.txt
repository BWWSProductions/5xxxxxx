In a time of tragedy and violence, itâ€™s important to remember that the world isnâ€™t just made up of lunatics who fly planes into buildings. It also includes lunatics who meet annually for extremist rhetoric and hors dâ€™oeuvres. Yes, itâ€™s CPAC time again!  If you donâ€™t want the little quiches or the punch, thereâ€™s plenty of hypocrisy to go around. Already this yearâ€™s CPAC featured both Marco Rubio and Jim DeMint ridiculing President Obama for using telepromptersâ€¦ while reading off of teleprompters.   Did the scripts include an instruction saying â€œtry not to look directly at the prompter while saying thisâ€?


Yesterdayâ€™s big news was that Dick Cheney made a â€œsurpriseâ€ visit to CPAC.  Surprise? Really? Ever since he left office, has Dick Cheney ever seen a microphone that he wasnâ€™t drawn to like a moth to a light bulb? All you have to do is put a podium in front of a friendly audience, and Dick Cheney will show up. Itâ€™s like â€œField of Dreams.â€ If you build it, he will comeâ€¦ and start lying. The CPAC crowd started yelling â€œRun, Dick, run!â€ First of all, that is NOT what you tell a guy who has had five heart attacks. Somebody in the crowd yelled â€œCheney in 2012!â€ That shows there was at least one undercover Democrat in attendance. Believe me, nobody wants Dick Cheney to run for President more than Democrats. I would start a movement to draft Dick Cheney, but then heâ€™s pretty good at avoiding the draft.


Another surprise this year was the attendance of â€œinvestigative journalistâ€ James Oâ€™Keefe.  It tells you all you need to know about the new generation of conservatives that their biggest idol had to get permission from his parole officer to leave his parentsâ€™ house and attend CPAC. For the progressive side, Rachel Maddow was at CPAC. I donâ€™t think she had to check with a parole officer first.


Incidentally, this year CPAC is co-sponsored by the John Birch Society.  I know what youâ€™re thinkingâ€¦ it really makes you kind of wonder what year this is.  You donâ€™t get any nuttier than the John Birch Society. But Iâ€™m sure that the new generation of conservatives is going to try.
