Wasn't gonna get this one but with all the bitches bitching curiosity got the better of me. Turns out the russian audio source is used from 1:25:31 until 1:28:08 when the inferior, though english, sound kicks in again. Less than ten sentences spoken, guessing less than 100 words.

I'll watch it and not care, guess it matters more to anyone who really takes these movies seriously and cares about the morals of the story that they always spew out at the end."

I created an account specifically to say this. extremezone, normally, i appreciate uploaders and don't expect crystal clear quality because I'm not paying to watch this movie, I'm downloading it, I never get angry. But have you even watched your own movie? Your words literally mean nothing to me now and I won't trust your torrents. You blatantly, BLATANTLY lie to people saying only 3 words are Russian. From 1:25:45 onward to 1:28:09 all spoken dialogue is completely Russia, which is then replaced by cam audio for the remainder of the movie. I just don't understand why you would lie to people so obviously, all your doing is creating mistrust by telling them one thing, only to have them find out and be disappointed when they realise this.

I am not some spammer, I am not some ""torrent critic"", I am just a guy angry at being lied at. I sincerely mean this. Fuck you. Aside from that, the movie is extremely watchable and for the most part, a very good torrent. Your just a lying prick.

The point is that the upload is being misleading.  It's important for people to comment on their actual experiences with the downloads so that others that come after them know what they are getting into.

Personally I'd be upset if I d/l'd then watched 90% of the movie only to have the ending messed up.  Free or not, uploads should be informative about what they are uploading."

My previous post was correct, but it wasnt about missing part :/
Besides that movie is good. Quality as in file name - R5 DVD. I would say 6-7/10.
Thank you for upload. I was waiting for this one long time :)

Btw: I did understood that Gabriel said to Michael: ""I would not give you this mercy""
Michael reply: ""I know"". And there is one sentence I do not understood - but I think it was something like: ""Go back to our father, he's waiting for you"" - or something. At the end of russian language part Michael told to human (I dont remember his name, lol) - ""Do not loose your faith"".

I'm only 20m in it at the moment but what others said about the bad quality of audio is true so far.

I've seen worse.. or heard worse in this case but when I see the DVDRip tag, I expect better than this. A decent image AND a decent audio.

It's in sync (so far at least), it's just bad. Distant, hollow, etc.

I just don't get what's so important to get the little 5 minutes of fame for uploading a recent movie by combining 2 already uploaded sources. Especially when 1 is bad.

Trying to be objective, I don't know the guy, I don't care about the calling names crap and people for and against should try to make things clear for others instead of bickering for 5 pages.

It's fine if you want to settle for uploaders who blatantly lie, you can download this and miss the most important lines in the film. But you should be in support of our efforts for trying to get this uploader to maintain basic etiquette like providing relevant and factual information pertaining to the film. extreme should have edited the information instead of maintaining that this file is what he said, when it's not. There were over 10,000 leechers yesterday all expecting an R5 DVDRip (which doesn't exist) that's entirely in English (which it isn't). So if you feel we're being unfair to extreme, just think about how many people are expecting this to be something it isn't. And just because it's free newfie, doesn't mean it shouldn't be done right.

,Dramat,2010-02-21T13:52Z,"I would like to write just one thing - argument that stuff here on TPB is free and because of it you can lie, treat others with no respect or just offend others is really very childish. Think about what you're saying - if I do not pay you, I don't have to be fair or respect others? Money are what makes people honest and reliable? What kind of mentality is that? 
It is not money that makes us human beings people! It doesnt matter If I payed to someone or not - he is still a human being and he/she deserve a respect! What happens with your good manners? You think you can just skip it beacuse you wasn't get payed for this? For me - personally - it's just immature and embarrassing way of thinking.
And one more thing extreme - you wrote in one of your latest comments: ""(..)muhaha never i will did not take these losers comments in serious"". Man that kind of reply is hopeless. Don't you have some dignity? You made a mistake (I do not assume it was a lie) - but if you make a mistak - you should apologize for that. Why? It is all about good manners and respect - and believe me - you do not have to get pay to get those. At least not from peoples, whom are adult and are NOT primitive. 
That's my opinion."

Seriously, the movie itself is far from great but you should still not be getting ripped off by the uploader.

Show me; WHERE does it state that it's 100% english?! NOWHERE! Learn fucking english, or go to elementary school again to learn some text interpretation!

""English , perfect sync , real and complete line sound including starting or ending credits""

This tells me that it is english - which is true for 99% of the audio, but since there is no adjective attached to it, stating it to be complete english, this statement is true! - perfect sync - which means there is no shifting audio, every sound is at its place - real and complete line sound - real line sound from the beginning to the end - including starting or ending credits - there is sound at the starting or ending credits too, hence _complete_ line sound! -.

I could get the same release somewhere else, oh wait i did already and had the exact same problem as I did with this.

Oh and if you can read, scroll back a few pages and check a previous comment I made regarding extremezone's past work, that this was a step back for him, but the fact that both him and losers like yourself seem to think there is nothing wrong with it and try to defend it makes me angry, makes me write, makes me wanna pee....

But u calling me a troll? Like I'm hiding under a bridge or sumthing scaring billygoats and I also aint lying at all man. Havent lied yet, this is an UNFINISHED, UNPERFECT, INCOMPLETE release and in the description it should say that it has the same problem as the others, with minor to barley noticeable improvements!

Also that quote u had quoted from me eariler about going to pay in a cinema? Everyone knows that waiting for an R5 or DVDScreener is far better then watching on a big, blurry screen. Everyone (cept you) knows watching a movie thats in theaters right now is almost a waste of time, its not even the best quality at these theaters anyway.

You know i'm right, and you are angry because of it, so the only thing you can say is ""fuck you Asagrim"".

Minor/Barley noticeablt improvements but with still the same MAJOR problem.

He withheld information from us you say? I could swear that would mean he's still being untruthful with us. He wasn't being honest in the description, maybe 99% but 100%, and in situations where the ending of the movie is essentially tainted and its on all the copies then that part specifically is what I and others want to know. Can I DL this and watch it all the way through without major problems? Dude withholding information is another way to describe lying and in my opinion and others, the fact that the language changes at the end of the movie, where there is dialogue being spoken, is a big problem. 

Apolpgetic? U R Serious aren't u? People like yourself makes me angry when you defend mistakes made by others only because they upload movies for you. I get very thankful when I get a movie I want and it WORKS the way it should. I do plan on getting Legion, adding it to my collection but It will now be from a respected uploader(s) like Diamond, Arrow, FXM,FXG ect etc etc. They dont lie to me... oh wait they ""don't withhold information"""

Respected uploaders don't lie.

Extremezone is unique in that he ALWAYS lies about his uploads. He doesn't even need to lie!  He would get much respect from everyone if he just told the truth.  But he's weird, and somehow he feels the need to lie every time, and when you read the comments there is always a big shit-storm about it, and extremezone is right in the middle of it, lying and lying and lying.  The dude is a compulsive liar.  I've been downloading of the PB for years and I've never seen anything like extremezone.

So maybe you lied - I don't give a shit - no need to apologize cuz most of the wankers rattling your cage are liars too. In fact, you'd be hard put to find a single fucking human being on this rock that hasn't lied so, you know, don't sweat it dude.

And what about this nipple-hugging noob calling for a boycott saying ... ""let's all stick together pirates"" .... what does he think, that leechers are pirates? lmfao Keep your chin up man, I've been around these parts since the turn of the millennium and I can say without doubt that without guys like you there wouldn't be a fucking community for these nipple-huggers.

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding.

That said movie was fairly good but a little weak on the story side.

The final comment on the English/Russian debate is:

There are exactly 9 short lines of Russian Dialog. However, they are at a climatic segment of the film. They are short, mostly 1 or 2 words per line, lasting less than a minute total. It is however very easy to guess what the lines should be even if you don't understand Russian.
I'll give you a hint. The first line is, ""do it, do, it, do it!"" And the second is, ""No."" Beyond that you can guess.

The other 7 lines after these are just as predictable and similarly short.

I give Video a 8 and audio a 6 for this download."

a:7 (voices kinda low found i had to turn the volume up and down between action scenes)

the russian translation problem does still exist though so extremezone if your still reading comments if you uploaded a new file it dident take or something.

********SPOILER ALERT*********

In the final fight when Michael is holding the sword to Gabriels neck all dialogue from here till the next scene in the car is in russian. not hard to guess what their saying though but still kind of a bummer at this point in the movie


******* end spoilers*******

either way thx for the pretty good upload

Overall:8/10"

Great movie.

V:9/10
A:7/10

One minute towards the end is in Russian, here's the translation thanks to madbilly:

Gabriel- go on, come on, finish me.
Michael - No.
Gabriel - I would not show such mercy.
Michael - I know, that is why you've let him down.
Gabiel flies away.
Michael - They are waiting for you (talking to dude)
Dude - where are you going?
Michael - you are their true guardian, and have always been.
Dude - We will meet again?
Michael - Do not lose your faith.
Mike flies away. That's all.

After that it goes back to English and sounds a little airy like it's being spoken in a bathroom."
,dippinwett00,2010-03-18T04:31Z,yo brad001 wtf dude why you botherin people wit dat nonsence nobody cares about what you gotta say about dat shit dude if you gonna leave a comment on someones shit leave somethin that means somethin i trust that anyone who reads dis plus the uploader damn SON....
,freeflyffplayer2007,2010-03-18T07:15Z,there something we cannot understand on the last part...would you fix it?
,Deladiel,2010-03-19T13:21Z,"Welp, since no one bothers to go back and read old comments here it is again for you guys

Yes a small portion of the movie is in Russian here is what is said:


Gabriel- go on, come on, finish me.
Michael - No.
Gabriel - I would not show such mercy.
Michael - I know, that is why you've let him down.
Gabriel flies away.
Michael - They are waiting for you (talking to dude)
Dude - where are you going?
Michael - you are their true guardian, and have always been.
Dude - We will meet again?
Michael - Do not lose your faith.
Mike flies away.

After this the movie goes back to English and just repeats what is said at the beginning of the movie

Other then this small part this is a great upload imho

Oh and by the way, they are most definitely NOT speaking Russian. Why would 2 angels who have been around for ages have a discussion in Russian? Out of all the languages? My best guess would be that they are speaking a certain dialect of Ancient Aramaic. Use your head, ""That's that lump, that's 3 feet above your ass!"" Thank you Tom Hanks!"

I use Verizondsl, and every time I dl a torrent from these guys, whether its originally from them, or if its a re-up of those two releasers, I get a NOTICE OF COPYWRITE INFRINGMENT emai, or phone call.
This has happened 4 times now, (the last two times they were re-uploads by someone else, but orginated from the names mentioned).
Im just saying, apparently Verizondsl has these two releasers flagged in some way, or, my IP address is flagged to watch for THEIR ip addys.
Dont know. I have to read the info very carefully to make sure the orignal source is not Noir, or 1335, or max torrentz.
Has anyone else had this issue?

Gabriel with the sword to his neck says ""Go Ahead""

He says it 2 more times after witch Michael replies ""No""

Gabriel Says ""I wouldn't have shown you such mercy""

Michael Says ""I know, that is why you failed""

He turns to the other guy and says ""They're waiting""

The guy stand up and says ""Where are you going?""

Michael Says ""You are their protector and always was""

The guy Says ""Will we meet again?""

Michael Says ""Don't loose your faith.""



and thats all folks....easy as that.  Hope that didn't ruin it for you...the upload is awesome..don't hate the uploader.

These movies are first released overseas, since they are almost a full day ahead of us.  And its easier to bootleg there.  So just enjoy this free movie that you got and stop bitchin.

1. Read titles before you download. R5 DVDRip = Russian DVDRip (bad compared to western world standards of DVD's) with an english audio track smacked right on top of it. So dont complain about the audio. Be glad you even get most of the special effects. Could have been cardboard wings, ragdolls and ketchup.

2. You have no right to download or watch this movie and therefore you have no right to complain about anything regarding the movie. You can complain about a trailer on youtube.

3. I dont speak Russian and the 3 languages i speak cannot be compared to Russian. Even i made sense of the 4 sentences.
