An out-of-the-way diner becomes the unlikely battleground for the survival of the human race. When God loses faith in humankind, he sends his legion of angels to bring on the Apocalypse.

IMAGiNE NOTES
IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

This time round it's the R5 of Legion.......and yes it has FULL LINE ENG audio :P

Sources used .....russian dvdr, mentions audio, our own audio..........thanks to all.

Right now for this we had our own audio but we had problems with loud scenes and even after filtering the problems were still there, so we opted to taken mentions audio and add our audio from 1hr 25mins 18sec until the end and then filter it and create a new audio file.

Video we ripped the dvdr and done our usual tweaks.....making it brighter, fixing colours, some sharpness etc....

Once all done it was a case of syncing the new audio file up to the video....

Anyway skimmed through, looks and sounds pretty good to us.....audio could be better but, hell can't win them all :P

Oh also we've added a proof sample aswell so people can see the part when all the other were in russian....we only did a small sample of it, so we don't spoil the film for those yet to watch it ;-)
