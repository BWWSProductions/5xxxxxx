[T],jerry7_57,2010-02-19T23:11Z,"Thanks for going the extra mile on this, it is truly appreciated!!! One vip member uploaded the R5 awhile ago and tried to pass it off as a dvdrip. This didn't fly because they admitted it had 27 sec. of Russian audio, shame on them.   "
,dj_klyde,2010-02-19T23:20Z,thank you for putting out some quality work for us. the fixed audio is greatly appreciated
,SeamusVonCat,2010-02-20T15:54Z,Thanks for uploading this version. Complete English dialog.
,thadream101,2010-02-25T05:09Z,does this one have the audio the other ones are missing?
,karamelbunni,2010-02-28T21:51Z,"This one has ALL ENGLISH audio, all the way to the end of the movie. Thanx for the upload!  

Audio: 9 Video: 10(audio seems to go up and down just a little bit, but it's definitely tolerable)

Movie: 6  Too many plot jumps for me... fighting angels with human weapons? Who'da thunk it, lmao"
,hott69mami,2010-03-02T03:21Z,thanks great up! good quality and audio!!! Can you get When In Rome and Youth In Revolt? Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,michaelrwatson,2010-04-10T23:59Z,"Great video, but..... the audio has a ""metallic tunnel"" distortion to it.  Download the sample and you'll see what i mean.

You can remove most of it by using virtualdub's lowpass filter, but my question is:  WHY THE HELL didn't IMAGiNE just do that..??  "
