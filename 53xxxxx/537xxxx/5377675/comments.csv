,namantorrent,2010-02-27T05:42Z,"ok the print is good huh
but is the movie good
thanks raymondhome
thr r lots of spammers these days who advertise thr software via a 700 mb file which says ur movie cant b played codec error :X"
,Dicepheris,2010-03-04T06:49Z,"Works great! A little glitchy unless played from beginning to end. If you skip from one position to another during play, in certain players the play speed will increase for the duration of the movie.
Works fine in Divx player. WMP is where I found a glitch. But who knows could just be me. Enjoy. I'll continue seeding. I'd advise you see this in the theater as well though. It good enough to pay for, at least once."
