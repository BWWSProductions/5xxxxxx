Channel 4 documentary â€œCarlo Scarpaâ€ produced by Murray Grigor, first broadcast October 1996 and presented by Richard Murphy.

A film profiling the work of Carlo Scarpa, considered by many to be Italy's greatest post-war architect. Filmed in Venice, some eighteen years after his death, the programme includes rare archive footage of Scarpa himself and the views of friends and colleagues. Work seen includes the art galleries in the Castelvecchio at Verona, the Palazzo Abatellis in Palermo, a gallery in Venice, and the Brion Memorial.


Has been previously ripped from VCR - DVD so quality is not perfect and there is a moments snow before the film begins but I was unable to find this great program elsewhere.
