,i_reckoner,2010-04-27T00:55Z,"why the hell is it described as NTSC if this game is a real PAL?! so frustrating... i've been looking for a new mario kart iso that runs on my modded wii, but it's got to be NTSC, i don't like patched versions. ok, found this one, took hours to download and when i open it with regionfrii, it says it's PAL! uploader, what's happened?! =("
