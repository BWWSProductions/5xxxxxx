Here you have virtually everything Iron Maiden has recorded. You won't find any bootlegs, though (not that Iâ€™m against bootlegs, itâ€™s that I donâ€™t have any yet).

- All the MP3 files have their ID3 tags updated and with all the information. This is regarding Artist, Album, Year, Song, Track Number, Genre and Composer. This was done automatically using Windows Media Player. However, I have checked every file in search for mistakes or missing information.
- A 300 x 300 picture of the cover has been attached to every MP3 file so the listening is more â€œvisualâ€. This way, when you play the file using Windows Media Player or your Ipod for example, you will see the cover immediately. This was done using 'Tag&Rename 3.4' (not included).
- Every folder has its â€˜folder.jpgâ€™ and â€˜AlbumArtSmall.jpgâ€™ hidden files so you can see the covers when browsing your â€˜My Musicâ€™ directory, or whichever the directory you use to store your MP3 files.
- It doesn't include the covers on separate files, sorry. If you want them, you can always search for them on the internet.
- The folders have been named using this format: 'yyyy, mm-dd - name of the album', where 'yyyy, mm-dd' is the date of release; this is to keep the exact order of release. I know that even though I found this helpful, you might not like it; sorry for the inconvenience.

In short, this was thought and designed so that you just copy the â€˜Iron Maidenâ€™ folder into your â€˜My Musicâ€™ directory, or whichever the directory you use to store your MP3 files, and start enjoying without having to worry about anything else.
