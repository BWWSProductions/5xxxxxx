Did you ever buy playstation magazines back during the reign of the playstation 1? You probably did if you owned a Playstation at the time. Some of these demo disks came with some rather excellent community developed games. In this paritcular case the Net Yaroze community developed games.

I have converted the Net Yaroze packs into an eboot that'll run on the Sony PSP. I recommend using pops 3.71 for this disk as I've had no problems testing it on pops 3.71 myself.
