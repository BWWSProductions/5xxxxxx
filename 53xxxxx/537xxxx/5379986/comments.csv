Tnx!!!!"
,Camel-Toe,2010-03-04T12:49Z,When's this person gonna start seeding this?
,rarity99,2010-03-07T02:22Z,"it hasn't stopped seeding, it just takes a while for one person to fully seed a 33gb file. "
,Timinounoir,2010-07-07T05:15Z,bros... this is a 33G files and my DL speed is from 1 to 10k/s...  how are you guys doing?
,ehwood,2010-09-09T07:18Z,"I seem to get a speed relative to my upload speed, since I'm near 30k download with my upload throttled at 30k."
,Mr_Joshua,2011-01-29T20:33Z,Thanks so much. I loved this series back in the day and its still relevant today. 
,Mr_Joshua,2011-02-13T11:19Z,"Thanks so much for seeding these, I loved this show when it first aired.  Does anyone know where I can get English subs for seasons 3 onwards? Do you have the English subs MY_KAWN and if so, would you be willing to post them on PB? "
,wzrd140,2011-03-04T09:18Z,What codec is needed for season 3-9?
,nurburSTIG,2011-05-11T03:39Z,Please Seed....please
,Blazedbill,2011-05-20T15:42Z,"Oh noes.... I hate to be Mr. Frowney Face and all, but this torrent consists of episodes off of The Biography Channel. What most of you are probably unaware of, the commercial time over the years has steadily increased. Older shows ran much longer than the shows of today. When they re-run shows, it is using the same time structure they use for shows created now. What this means is they *cut* sometimes minutes out of the original show to fit it in the new ""commercialized"" time slots. I love the original Twilight Zone for example. I used to watch the 24 hour marathons on TV. I recently downloaded from a torrent that had episodes from the DVD's of the show. In 1960, there was less than 5 minutes of commercial time. It is approaching 9 min. of commercials now. So... in order to play them on TV now, they chop off almost 4 min. of the freaking episode. Wish there was a DVD rip of this show from Season 1 to 9 on TPB... only 2 seasons available, and like 2 seeds for em. Tis' a shame. This is a hilarious show =("
,Blazedbill,2011-05-20T15:46Z,"To boot, while I did notice some parts of the episodes cut at strange moments mid-laugh in some cases, it did not *hit me* I was watching a TV rip of the show until 5 episodes into season 2.... Now I'm going to ""have to"" see if I can download the 2 DVD seasons of this show available and find 2 or 3 min. of cut shizzle.... lol, whee...."
,Blazedbill,2011-05-21T08:46Z,"Yeah, they sure did chop some shtuff out of the TV edit... some pretty funny shizzle too. Watching the same episodes over again but with the 2 1/2 to 3 minutes of cut material added *almost* makes it watchable so soon. Kinda like watching the ""Director's Cut""... To the dude who uploaded this, thank again and all that, but you *really* should have included that this was the TV edit... Would have saved me wasted time...."
,Freeizgood,2011-05-25T20:55Z,"Torrentday has seasons 1, 2, and 3 DVD rips right now....I'm grabbing those for sure...........Markie Post hot as hell an added bonus........."
,Blazedbill,2011-05-27T12:39Z,"Holy crap! I don't know if you are a dude or not, but I love you man! Lol, not the gay kinda love. The friend/brother sort. You rock. I had all but given up on finding season 3 DVD rip. I must have gone 25-30 pages of google searching for it. Found season 1 and 2 no prob. I was *this close* to buying the third season to get it. Thank you Freeizgood. Good looking out ;) I did read there *was* a season 4 DVD that got screwed up or something on pressing the DVD's for it. Amazon is selling the 4th season though. Don't know if they fixed the issue with the DVD or what, but if anyone wants to up that one, I will be eternally grateful. They don't make shows like this anymore. Intelligently written hilarious comedy. Ah, the good ol' days... makes me feel like an old bastard..."
,chrishaney23,2011-06-09T06:32Z,okay. i watched this for a little bit then all a sudden WMP wont play it anymore. i downloaded every codec pack in the world and vlc player and gspot to find what codec it is and of course the codec was unknown. can someone PLEASE tell me what codec i need to play these videos?
