A cult mid 80's Croatian synthpop duo, in the most successful years comprised of the mastermind Davor Tolja and the vocalist Marina PeraziÄ‡. 
After the second album, Ja Sam LaÅ¾ljiva, Marina quit to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Edi KraljiÄ‡. 
For the third and final album, Budi Tu, the act lost the synthpop edge that had made the whole fame and became more guitarish pop-rock oriented.

Albums:

(1983) Cuvaj Se
(1988) Budi tu
