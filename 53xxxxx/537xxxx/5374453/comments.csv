,KeiKun83,2010-02-18T23:40Z,"Aye, right you are theRealKarmine. But still, until there is a way to do some shit with it, it doesn't hurt to have it on your harddrive. =)"

,zingmars,2010-02-19T13:44Z,"We can already bypass the b-net login and see in-game replays, imo soon there will be bnet 2.0 private servers (PvPGN v2? :D) allowing us to enjoy without having the beta. "
