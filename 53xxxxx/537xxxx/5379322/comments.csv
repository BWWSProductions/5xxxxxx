,vivatpb5776,2010-12-20T04:22Z,"Okay, it's been almost 10 months since this .torrent was uploaded and no one has confirmed what fernandopassion pretty much knew from the jump. So here it goes: It's fake!

The download was relatively quick. The upload claims the size is only 101MBs when in reality, it is almost 500MBs. It peaked at 876kb/s and went as low as 7.6kb/s.

Once downloaded, I ran viral scans and they came up clean. I opened the folder and found a .doc file...major red flag. Just for the fuck of it, I opened the .doc file and here is what it states:

""T-Play File Playing Instructions. To get your password follow these instructions...

3) Then change the files' extension from .mp3 to .zip

4) Open your files with an unzipping tool

5) Enter the password and play your new file""


AVOID THIS .TORRENT AT ALL COSTS!!!!"
