1. The desktop:

- left-click on the deskop for a small 'apps' menu, with links to the most useful apps and tools
- right-click on the desktop for the full puppy menu 
- you'll see an animated icon bar at the bottom, showing all the emulators available
- left-click on the emulator you want to load, then browse for a rom file.
- right-click on the emulator icons to reset/refresh the menu
- go to 'menu->desktop->wbar configuration centre' to edit your emulator bar
- in wbarcc, click on 'profiles', choose the one for your resolution and click 'apply'
- a start menu, quick links menu and taskbar at the very bottom, set to auto-hide
- the wallpaper can be changed by right clicking on any image any choosing 'Set as wallpaper'
- the file manager has all the most important bookmarks added already, in the toolbar

2. The control panel:

- a tabbed navigation panel showing most of the settings and tools available
- choose the 'Gaming' tab to configure your emulators config files
- if needed, use one of the network wizards to setup your internet connection

3. Configuring emulators and joypads:

BIOS

Some emulators require not only roms, but BIOS files too.

- Amiga: Find and download a kickstart file (kick13, kick20, kick31), put it in '/usr/lib/uae' and rename (or symlink) to 'kick.rom'.
- Atari ST: You need '/usr/share/hatari/TOS.img' installed. Get it from http://steem.atari.st/download.htm
- Atari 800: You'll need the Atari 800 BIOS (OS) to 'usr/local/speccy/'
- Commodore:You'll need to download a pack of system roms, and extract to '/usr/lib/vice'
- PupDoom: get doom2.wad or freedoom.wad. You already have '/usr/share/games/doom/prboom.wad' installed

NOTES: You are not allowed to own the BIOS of any systems that you have never purchased. 
Mupen64Plus requires OpenGL (3D acceleration, see below)

Joypads

- Plug in any joypads before the desktop has loaded and Puppy Arcade should get it working.
- To make ALL emulators support joypads you must use 'rejoypad' in 'Menu->Fun' or the 'Gaming tab of the Control Panel
- Use Rejoypad to map your joypad buttons to your preferred keyboard keys
- Use 'Menu->Shutdown->Restart X server' after changing your Rejoypad configuration
- type 'killall rejoystick' in the terminal if you need to close it


4. Getting ROMs

- I cannot include roms with this release, but here are some great links where you can get them:
- Rom-World.com, Romhustler.net, Emuparadise.org, Snes-O-Rama.us, ROMKeeper.com, LemonAmiga.com and so on

NOTE: You are not allowed to own the ROMs of any games released commercially, that you have never purchased. 

5. Enabling OpenGL (for 3D acceleration - optional for most emulators):

You'll simply need to download and install the correct dot pet file for your graphics card.
Then (optionally) follow the softwares' instructions and restart X.

PETS FOR NVIDIA CARDS:
The 'nvidia-7186.pet' is for ancient nvidia graphics cards (riva TNT to Geforce 1).
The 'nvidia-9643.pet' is for most nvidia cards (officially Gf2 to Gf4 but tested on Gf7 OK).
The 'nvidia-100.14.19.pet' is for latest cards (Gf5 to Gf8).

If you STILL can't find what you are looking for, then try a search at http://pupplinux.ca or the puppy forums 

6. Accessing your drives:

- all your storage drives can be found at '/mnt/' - but not until you 'mount' them
- left-click on the desktop and choose 'Drives' to see all your drives
- hard drives are listed as sda1, sda2, sda3 and so
- double-click on a drive to mount it, it will then open up in a file manager window
- after saving your settings (see below), you can use 'startmount' you open your drives at boot

7. Saving your settings

- when you shutdown for the first time, you'll be asked to save your session, so you don't lose any changes
- a nice menu will popup when you shutdown to help you create a savefile, if needed
- after creating a savefile, you will be asked whether to save to it or not, at each shutdown

8. Tips & Tricks

- After booting, you can simply replace your Puppy Arcade live-CD with a CD/DVD full of roms.
- Mount the DVD/CD drive and your roms will be available at '/mnt/sr0/'

or

- Put your savefile on the same drive as your roms, and your roms will be available at '/mnt/home/path/to/your/roms'
- You can then symlink your roms folder to /roms/ - so it's nice and fast to reach them
- To do this, type 'ln -s /path/to/your/roms /roms' in the terminal
