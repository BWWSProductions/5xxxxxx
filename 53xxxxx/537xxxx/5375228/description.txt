Synopsis: Agoraphobic freshman in New York City must join a scavenger hunt to save her boyfriend from a murderous gamemaster.

New horror from FiCO, a unrated film festival release. Ratings are pretty dam low, and there isnâ€™t much out there about the movie. Quality, none the less, is nice so grab if you like.
