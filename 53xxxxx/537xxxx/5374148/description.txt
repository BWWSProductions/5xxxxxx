Book Twelve of The Wheel of Time

The Gathering Storm
by
Robert Jordan & Brandon Sanderson

ISBN: 978-0-7653-0230-4

Format: XHTML

This torrent contains two version of the book:
One for e-book readers and one for web browsers.

Created from momamedienta's PDF and map scans.
Layout inspiration (and some copied CSS) from Spanko. 
Chapter icons from vector images at wot.wikia.com.

Ebook version 0.9.5
Changes from 0.9.0: 
- added italics
- fixed some OCR errors

Left to do:
1. Proofread the whole text thoroughly,
2. Change to vector-based chapter icons.
3. Add dropcaps for the e-book reader version.

I will probably not do any further work on 2 or 3
since a) I have too little knowledge of vector images to
make them look good in various browsers and
readers and b) dropcaps seem to render strange in
readers and might need to be reader-specific.

Also included in this torrent are all chapter icons
in svg and png.
