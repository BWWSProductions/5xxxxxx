Genesis - 2CD Collection - Banks/Collins/Rutherford Era

All of these tracks are taken from the 2007/2008 boxsets. I 
created thie 2 CD compilation of tracks that I like. The tracks
should be well organized and tagged. All tracks are ReplayGain 
scanned for track/album volume, but not its 'applied'.
