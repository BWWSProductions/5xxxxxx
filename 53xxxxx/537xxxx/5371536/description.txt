the programs included are to downloadvideos and mp3s, to decrypt and save dvds to your computer and to extract annoying .rar files in some torrents. they are easy to use. to download youtub videos, just copy and paste the url or multiple urls and set the location to save. same with mp3s. to decrypt dvds, just point the program to the dvd drive the movie is in and set the location. dvds use multiple gigabytes of space so make sure you have a lot of hard drive space for saving multiple dvds. and &zip compresses and extract many file types including .zip and .rar. instead of downloading winrar, use 7zip which is a lot easier to use. i did not make these programs.
