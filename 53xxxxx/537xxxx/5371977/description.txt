    Bilal is 17 years old, a Kurdish boy from                  
    Iraq. He sets off on an adventure-filled               
    journey across Europe. He wants to get to              
        England to see his love who lives there.               
        Bilal finally reaches Calais, but how do you           
        cover 32 kilometers of the English Channel             
    when you can't swim? The boy soon discovers               
    that his trip won't be as easy as he                       
    imagined... The community of struggling                    
    illegal aliens in Calais is captured with              
        authenticity, from the point of view of                
        people who arrived there knowing nothing               
        about France. This immigrant drama, with               
    wonderful performances by the actors, is a             
    strong story which uses documentary                    
    austerity and minimalist style to create a             
    great emotional impact.
