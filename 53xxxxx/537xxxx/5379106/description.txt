Your computer is as personal as your bank account. Keep it
that way
Total Privacy is a safe and easy-to-use to use privacy
protection tool that stops all those pesky snoopers such as
Cookies, history, index.dat, competitors (and even your
boss) from finding the trail of your computer use that
modern internet browsers and many other programs leave
behind. All this can be accomplished with a single click on
the mouse, or even automatically

With Total Privacy you get total confidence and peace of mind
for secure computer use by completely and permanently
removing all traces and history of your recent activity.
What's more, Total Privacy also helps improve and optimize
your computer's performance. By deleting all those
unnecessary temporary files, install/uninstall records and by
cleaning your internet browser cache, Total Privacy will keep
your computer functioning as smoothly and as quickly as it
should.

Total Privacy 5 makes use of the most advanced washing and
shredding methodsavailable today to make sure that your own
private business and computer use remains exactly that -
private.

NOTE
The program has been carrying an existent and unfixed bug
from previous versions. This bug sometimes throws an
ASProtect error, other times makes it crash. All this, when
you try to use the Shredder feature.

That behavior isn't related to the crack, it also happens
with the untouched executable
