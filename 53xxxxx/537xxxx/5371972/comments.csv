,svetlania09,2010-02-18T18:35Z,Yes it is just the addon files.  The bonus items rarely change and are included in most other torrents.  I also don't find it a huge benefit to a veteran player.
,todorovbg,2010-02-20T20:04Z,thanks for the torrent :)
,svetlania09,2010-02-23T16:24Z,"I hear that 2.0.877 has been released.  If anyone can get their hands it, it would be much appreciated.  Also, check out their new dailies guide in the free trial section.  They hope to have a complete version of the dailies out soon."

Upon getting my account back, all the items in my bags and bank were deleted and my level 80 was being used as a farm bot. Be cautious when using this...very very cautious.

Some info for the nay sayers. This is a brand new computer purchased less than a week ago. Only things installed on here is WoW with auctioneer, SCT threat meter and dps meter addons. My account was fine until I downloaded this to level up a new toon."

This one is 100% clean and legit. Looking forward to the new release! Thanks svet."
,svetlania09,2010-03-14T04:25Z,"I learn about the TourGuide thing a few weeks ago.  Don't worry, it isn't as bad as it seems.  Tekkub, TourGuide's creator is pleased with the deal.  It seems that other guides were stealing Tekkub's TourGuide and reselling it in their guides with his permission.  Now that Zygor owns the rights to it, Zygor has the necessary resources and legal team to stop the stealing of the copyright.  In the end, Zygor (John Cook) has announced that TourGuide will be released again free of charge and Tekkub will still be doing the maintenance on it."
,svetlania09,2010-03-14T04:26Z,"err, too bad I can't edit comments.   My previous one should have read ""reselling it in their guides WITHOUT his permission""."
,svetlania09,2010-03-14T04:36Z,I have uploaded the Feb 22nd release at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5434465.  There are some minor changes such as improvements to the Smart Injection System.
