Since no one apparently released this yet, here it is: the 4 FantÃ´mas studio albums in mp3 quality. I noticed a few of them floating around in FLAC format, but I prefer mp3s myself and I thought it might be the case for some of you folks too.

Includes:
1999 - S/T (often incorrectly titled as Amenaza Al Mundo)
2001 - Director's Cut
2004 - Delirium Cordia (highly recommended with headphones, preferrably in the dark)
2005 - Suspended Animation

Enjoy, and although I'll seed this for a while don't hesitate to help!
