,bestwish,2010-03-14T00:15Z,"I have the same problem. Everything looks fine when recovering, but none of my apps can read the files (jpg). A # is shown in front of the file name (if that is at any help). Running win7 please help."

I have a 1TB HDD, I deleted around 200GB by mistake from it (using command line delete option, so files do not go to recycle bin).

I used this program, it return most of the files for me 199GB, the files i lost is files with .avi extintion (some of them not all, the program gives me a 0kb size).

else this program is WOW, easy, fast, and return the files with there true name not like other Data recovery that i use return your files with different names.

Note: try to disable your internet when you use this program so it did not check for update, and Do Not update it so u can use it for full (retial) no need for a key or serial. but do not update it.

I wish if every one be honest when he put a comment, and not only to fake other peoples."
