So Thank you for your upload, and your time.

Great Release! "

This is it guys. The definitive copy. 

NO RUSSIAN whatever at the end of the film. NONE. 100% ENGLISH and no disruptions all throughout. 

Now whether you'll like the film itself is an entirely different matter. I thought it was OK though. Suspension of disbelief, that's all you need to enjoy this.

The important thing as far as this copy is concerned is, NO RUSSIAN DIALOGUE AT THE ENDING (or near the ending). 100% ENGLISH."
