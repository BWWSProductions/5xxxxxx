,Conda_Guy,2010-08-25T20:02Z,Any reason why these would NOT work on a 3gs running IOS 4.0.1?  My internet connection isn't the greatest so I'd rather know ahead of time whether they'll work or not.  Don't wanna wait a week for them to D/L just to find out they're not compatible.  Thanks.

aslong as your iPhone 3gs is Jailbroken and either running AppSync or Installous then all you have to do is drop whichever cracked .ipa you want into itunes and then sync your phone with itunes to get it on there.

Good luck."
