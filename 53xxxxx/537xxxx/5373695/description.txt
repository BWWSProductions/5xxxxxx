Hurriganes are a Finnish rock band that formed in the early 1970s. They were very popular in Finland in the 1970s and early '80s; they were also a popular live act in Sweden during this time. Their classic line-up consisted of Remu Aaltonen, Albert JÃ¤rvinen and Cisse HÃ¤kkinen. What seems like a misspelling in the name ("Hurriganes" with a "g") is intentional. Their style of music is very much of a nostalgic, pre-Beatles, roots rock'n'roll orientation. During their "classic" period, the band's output consisted largely of revved-up cover versions of well-known 1950s rock'n'roll songs in addition to their own original material. In this sense, Hurriganes can be viewed as Finland's answer to British pub rock performers of the 1970s like Dave Edmunds and Dr. Feelgood.


"Meininki on nyt kovempi kuin pitkÃ¤Ã¤n aikaan. Oikeet ukot on nyt kehissÃ¤. SillÃ¤ tatsilla mennÃ¤Ã¤n, ettÃ¤ rapa roiskuu. Soittotatsi on helevetin hyvÃ¤ ja mÃ¶kki on tÃ¤ynnÃ¤ niinku pitÃ¤Ã¤. Ei me muuten tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ heiluttais, jos ei oltais iskusssa pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤ varpaisiin."
