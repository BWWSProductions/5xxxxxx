,deadscene,2010-02-20T21:41Z,"yeah, it's the snes9x emulator for wii and the homebrew channel. i have around 400 roms for it, but i didnt include them in the torrent, so it would be easier to download."
,nojesus,2010-02-21T04:03Z,Thanks for the update!
,deadscene,2010-02-21T05:00Z,no problem. anything to help.
,kingzaf76,2010-02-25T00:40Z,can i play back ups with this
,deadscene,2010-02-28T21:02Z,im pretty sure you can
,deadscene,2010-04-02T09:06Z,"if your wii is already a ""hacked"" version, then yes, you shouldnt have any problem using it."
,WhatTheFaaak,2011-01-26T23:54Z,do you unzip all the files or jsut the first folder? And when you put it into the wii does it install itself or do I have to click stuff :/ thanksx
