├ª┬¥┬▒├ªΓÇô┬╣├¿┼á┬▒├ª╦£┬á├Ñ┬í┼í├úΓé¼Γé¼├»┬╜┼╛ Phantasmagoria of Flower View (romanized: Touhou Kaeidzuka, meaning Oriental Flower Viewing Mound) is a danmaku vertical-scrolling shooter, and is the ninth official game in the Touhou series.

It is rather unlike most of the previous Touhou games released so far in that it's a VS type game, where two equally matched characters fight head to head. In this regard, the game most resembles the Touhou game Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream for the PC-98, and Twinkle Star Sprites for the Neo Geo/Dreamcast/PS2.

This game takes place in the mystical oriental land of Gensokyo. Spring has arrived, but something seems to be wrong. Flowers are blooming and the fairies are becoming active as usual, but the sheer number of flowers and fairies are completely unnatural; even non-spring flowers are blooming. Playing as one of 16 characters, you must battle your way through 9 difficult encounters to reach Muendzuka and uncover the truth behind this abnormal spring.
