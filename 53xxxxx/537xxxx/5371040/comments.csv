[V],twentyforty,2010-02-17T18:36Z,"@hardik_860: Sorry, but request was placed for The Boondock Saints. Nothing more. This is what I have. Besides, I watch three or four movies per month. Maybe few missing curses or vulgarities cannot spoil good movie, right?"

Same destiny (and for same reason) as first upping of this torrent (it is re-up from few days back).
Maybe I'll change my mind in next couple of days.
