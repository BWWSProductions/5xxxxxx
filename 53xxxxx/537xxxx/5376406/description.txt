The DVD includes even more bonus material for Kung Fu Panda and Secrets.

The bonus material is divided into two categories on the disc: â€œPoâ€™s Power Playâ€ and â€œLand of the Panda.â€

Poâ€™s Power Play carries on the kid-friendly approach of Kung Fu Pandaâ€™s release with lots of games and a few activities. The â€œDumpling Shuffleâ€ game is a vast improvement over the other set-top games Kung Fu Panda brought, although itâ€™s over quickly.

You can also learn to draw the characters of Kung Fu Panda in separate tutorials, and there is even more DVD-ROM content on this disc for more activities.

The other section, Land of the Panda, is more about Chinese culture and kung fu than either of the movies. Inside you can learn to do the â€œPanda Danceâ€ , determine what sign in the Chinese zodiac you belong to, and look at the different fighting styles of kung fu.
