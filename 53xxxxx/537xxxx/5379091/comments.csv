,gi4mi,2010-02-21T22:12Z,"nice upload mate, but all chapters quit inmidiatly when i try to play (i apply the patch) how do i solve this; 
Model: iMac8, 2 processors, Intel Core 2 Duo, 2.66 GHz, 2 GB
Graphics: ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro"
,Dragonforce79,2010-02-21T23:27Z,"gi4mi: Hmm, I have no idea whats happening at your side. I have tested this on my own Mac and on a friends Mac and all episodes worked flawlessly."
,davesneddon,2010-02-22T18:10Z,"Hi, how do I get past the username and password on the tell tale opening screen?"
,pompor,2010-02-22T19:16Z,"HAHAHA :D rofl 
i know a developer for this game but i dont know thats now for macs out :D cool thanks for upload !"
,davesneddon,2010-02-22T19:17Z,"figured it out i think, but when i go to play (entering a random unlock code?) same problem as above, it just insta-crashes."
,Dragonforce79,2010-02-23T13:04Z,"I'm not sure what the people with crashing issues are doing wrong... I didn't have to enter any serial either... I just applied the crack to each episode and thats it... you can just launch the game. Make sure that you're using the correct crack on the episode it was made for, they're not interchangeable. Also, on my Mac, I installed all of the episodes in a new folder in my applications directory.

Hope that helps."
,davesneddon,2010-02-23T15:09Z,"Hi, installing all the episodes in a new folder solved the problem for me, thanks for uploading and thanks for your response"
,Dragonforce79,2010-02-23T16:19Z,Glad it worked for you. Enjoy
,cooldude_2k10,2010-03-21T17:11Z,"I've tried everything that people posted in here, but it seems that Tales of Monkey Island couldn't be played in my mac.. FYI i'm using a macbook MB466LL/A Intel Pentium C2D 2GHz, running on Mac OS X 10.5.8

It crashes everytime I click on the game, whether I've run the patch, or not. Anyone with the same problem and has the same solution?

Putting all the copy in one folder, moved it to application folder, desktop, restarting it, etc... it doesn't work... help... really wanted to try this game.."
,timbadd,2010-03-23T10:47Z,"Same problem as you cooldude, tried putting them all in a new folder, restarting and everything, tried changing the date to when people had it working and still couldn't get it to work, every time I try and open any of them I get a message saying the program quit unexpectedly. Looking at the error report I get:
Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)
Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x000000003469dff8"
,timbadd,2010-03-23T10:50Z,"Right I got it, right click on the game icon and click show package contents, then go to contents/mac os/mac game, this should load the game :D"
,cooldude_2k10,2010-04-02T03:55Z,It works! It Works! Thx Timbadd... well at least the 1st chapter. Will update if it works for the rest of the chapter.
,bloempje09,2010-04-30T19:36Z,"Hey,

,gullet128,2010-05-04T19:20Z,Hi. This is my first time trying this so can someone please help me. Everytime i try to play they just ask for my email and password. I have put the crack in every episode. What am i doing wrong?
,ArtJenneration,2010-05-12T16:17Z,"Hey thanks for this! Installed and cracked, seems like everything is in working order. :)"
,Catatonicat,2010-05-13T21:28Z,"Praise the gods! I didn't know this was out on Mac (I hope the Mac games market expands). Now all LucasArts has to do is release an anthology just for Mac with all their classics :P (Fate of Atlantis, Sam & Max etc)"
,matsmatros,2010-05-13T22:06Z,"Hi, I'm what you people call a n00b. Can someone please explain where I'm supposed to drag the crack? In content? In mac OS? I have the same problem, it crashes imediately."
,juzzi84221,2010-05-14T19:25Z,Thanks Timbadd! Now the game also works with me. Just needed to go to the package contents...
,gizmus13,2010-05-20T14:57Z,"Hi there, I have been trying to install this on my Mac OS X 10.5.8 and i keep hitting a brick wall. The initial window pops up and when i hit start game it just crashes. I got monkey island 3 working a few nights ago and the resolution was all out of whack which i managed to fix before it crashed. The next day i had to install some new ram so lost this game and it's settings and never got it to work again. 

this is what ive been doing-
mount the game and put into applications
open the crack files
create new folder in applications
put game and crack in new folder
run and patch crack

Still wont work someone please help i love these games!!! 
Is there any way to alter the resolution without running the app?"
,Okay_2012,2010-06-03T05:59Z,"I have the same crash, damn it :( I installed it in a new folder in applications,applied the patch correctly for each episode, tried to open from the package contents too, still didn't worked :(

Somebody got any idea how i can get it to work?"
,sackalini,2011-03-08T10:24Z,"trying to get this to work but can't figure out where to put the crack file.  I placed Monkey Island 101 into a folder of it's own, opened the crack and CONFUSED as to where to place the crack.  I've tried every folder in MonkeyIsland101 but it doesn't pick up the crack (MonkeyIsland 101 crack intel).  Help please.  Ended up downloading for my Mac after my PS3 wouldn't let me download the ""special edition"" MI.

Thanks"
,gtroll,2011-05-13T23:38Z,"I just made this work on my Intel Mac so here's how I did - and I hope it works for you.

1. Open the folder you will see six DMG files.
2. Open all the DMG files except the one called crack. Don't worry when you mount them (see below) you will see which episode they are.
3. They will then mount like a DVD or a DMG does and you will see an App icon. Do not open the app yet.
4. Go to your apps folder, in finder, create a folder. Call it Monkey Island. Drag the mounted apps, one by one, into the new folder. You will have 5 iconed apps labelled 1-5.
5. Now go back to the torrent folder. Copy the crack file, or simply move it, from the torrent file into the new folder with the programs.
6. LAUNCH the CRACK
7. You will then see 5 illustrated icons, these are the five games in order, left to right.
8. To play game 1: Click the game 1 icon in the now open crack. A window will open, close the window and it will say launch the app.
9. Go back to the New Folder, now click and launch Monkey Island 1. The crack will then load the App.
10. It should now work. (It did for me anyway).
Hope this helps? ;-/"
