Billy Joel, a classically-trained pianist, was signed to Columbia Records in 1973. The title 
track to Piano Man, became a US Top 30 single and sowed the seeds of a highly successful 
recording career. However, Joel refused to bow to corporate ... Full 
for commercially-minded material and despite enjoying hits with two subsequent albums, 
Street Life Serenade and Turnstiles, it was not until 1977 that his fortunes flourished 
with the release of The Stranger, which eventually surpassed Bridge Over Troubled 
as Columbia's best-selling album. Joel's 1979 album, 52nd Street, spawned another smash single, 
'My Life' while the singer's first US number 1, 'It's Still Rock 'N' Roll To Me' came from a 
subsequent release, Glass Houses. His image as a popular, uncontroversial figure was shaken with 
The Nylon Curtain, which featured two notable 'protest' compositions, 'Allentown' and 'Goodnight Saigon'. 
However he returned to simpler matters in 1984 with An Innocent Man which included the effervescent 
best-seller 'Uptown Girl'. In 1997, he announced that he would not be writing any pop songs in the 
foreseeable future, concentrating instead on classical scores.
