HIP-HOP: Beyond Beats and Rhymes (First Aired: February 20, 2007)

Filmmaker Byron Hurt, a life-long hip-hop fan, was watching rap music videos on BET when he realized that each video was nearly identical. Guys in fancy cars threw money at the camera while scantily clad women danced in the background. As he discovered how stereotypical rap videos had become, Hurt, a former college quarterback turned activist, decided to make a film about the gender politics of hip-hop, the music and the culture that he grew up with. â€œThe more I grew and the more I learned about sexism and violence and homophobia, the more those lyrics became unacceptable to me,â€ he says. â€œAnd I began to become more conflicted about the music that I loved.â€ The result is HIP-HOP: Beyond Beats and Rhymes, a riveting documentary that tackles issues of masculinity, sexism, violence and homophobia in todayâ€™s hip-hop culture.

Sparking dialogue on hip-hop and its declarations on gender, HIP-HOP: Beyond Beats and Rhymes provides thoughtful insight from intelligent, divergent voices including rap artists, industry executives, rap fans and social critics from inside and outside the hip-hop generation. The film includes interviews with famous rappers such as Mos Def, Fat Joe, Chuck D and Jadakiss and hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons; along with commentary from Michael Eric Dyson, Beverly Guy-Sheftall, Kevin Powell and Sarah Jones and interviews with young women at Spelman College, a historically black school and one of the nationâ€™s leading liberal arts institutions. 

The film also explores such pressing issues as women and violence in rap music, representations of manhood in hip-hop culture, what todayâ€™s rap lyrics reveal to their listeners and homoeroticism in hip-hop. A â€œloving critiqueâ€ from a self-proclaimed â€œhip-hop head,â€ HIP-HOP: Beyond Beats and Rhymes discloses the complex intersection of culture, commerce and gender through on-the-street interviews with aspiring rappers and fans at hip-hop events throughout the country.
