,teeny555,2012-07-13T01:09Z,"lscribe did you ever figure this out? seems like you need an activation code not serial. I found the machine id, and created the serial and tried using that activation but that didn't work, also didn't work using those 2 items as login & password. Would love to know if you ever found out or just gave up and went on to something different?"
