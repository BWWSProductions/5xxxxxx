Comics legend Peter David and up-and-coming artist Eric Nguyen bring a whole new HALO story to life! When the colony planet Ariel sends out a mysterious distress signal, it's up to the UNSC's elite, highly skilled special-ops Marines, the Orbital Drop Shock Troopers from the 105th, to find out what's happening.

When the distress signal comes, two Helljumpers will find themselves at the center of the mystery on Ariel, and before it's solved, they'll have to put their friendship-and their lives-on the line...
