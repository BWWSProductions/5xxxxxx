,boredom707,2010-02-19T13:08Z,anybody else have a problem with the audio?  Mine wouldnt play
,boredom707,2010-02-19T14:17Z,nevermind.  Apparently the problem is only on the ps3
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2010-02-24T23:55Z,Yeah I have the same problem for the ps3. No audio for some reason. All the ones before this one worked. Weird. Oh well. Thanks for the upload EZTV. Always my trusted source.
,teabag87,2010-03-01T03:44Z,"for ps3 audio problems, try 'un-checking' AAC from supported audio playback.  works for me with most problems.  If that doesnt work, then convert them to mp4 with handbrake or ripbot, those 2 programs are a ps3 owners friend"

,loosenoose,2012-07-08T10:10Z,Please redo this torrent! This is the only episode that I haven't seen because there's no sound! So frustrating.
