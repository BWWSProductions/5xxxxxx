was an American country music singer who enjoyed pop music 
crossover success during the era of the Nashville sound in the 
early 1960s. 

Since her death at age 30 in a 1963 private airplane crash at 
the height of her career, she has been considered one of the most 
influential, successful and acclaimed female vocalists of the 20th

Cline was best known for her rich tone and emotionally expressive 
bold contralto voice,[1] which, along with her role as a mover and 
shaker in the country music industry, has been cited as an inspiration
by many vocalists of various music genres.

"She's Got You", "Crazy" and "Sweet Dreams".
