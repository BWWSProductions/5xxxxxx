,monzermasri,2011-11-21T12:46Z,"1.	I really admire Kris body of work .. I remember how I got his marvelous album (Me & Bobby McGee) it was like a miracle. Yes It was always a miracle in a country like Syria to get such album like (John weasly Harding) of Bob Dylan. 
Or (Stand Up) of  Jethro Tull .. 
I was going to meet an childhood friend of mine who went to work as a sailor. Who I didnâ€™t see for a long long time. There in his parentsâ€™ house  I noticed an album thrown without care beside him.. and when I asked him what that Salim ? he answered: Nothing.. some one left it in the ship and I took it. If you want it, itâ€™s yours??
So .. I full in love with all the 14 songs.. after that I got another Kris albums. The one which said was successful and which was not.. and I loved them all .. I adore Kris Kristofferson even I didnâ€™t like to see him in such small roles in some bad commercial Films.. But Kris well always stay one of the best county singer of all time.
Thanks Flitigalisa"
