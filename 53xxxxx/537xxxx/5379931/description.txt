Rating:        T (Teen)
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 


Compressed With 7Zip, Game was tested and works. 


Important - This is a CD-R or Compact Disc Type Ps2 Game, So you'll have to use 
            CD-R Media only to burn with.


Release Notes - No attempt to rebuild to dvd was made, I wanted to leave the game 
                as is in the original CD-R Format. This also will assure the game 
                works without errors. Not saying it will not work in dvd format 
                but that requires extended testing to insure it works as a rebuild 
                to dvd but Im low on dvd's so I had to leave original.


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.
      

You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description:

Robot Alchemic Driver, or commonly known as RAD, is a Big Robot / Monster fight in a modern city with a twist. There is a story mode / training mode and a 2 player vs mode. In a nut shell, alienâ€™s attack the last city on earth. The big robot comes up, and here is where the twist come in, you have to control the robot from the perspective of the â€œheroâ€ (three to choose from) and you can switch between the robot / hero mode. This forces you to make sure you have a strategic position to move the hero around in the city to see the battle without getting too close. As the game goes on you have the option to update/customize the mech(s) to improve them. You can end up destroying whole building / terrain as you battle the alien monster. 

Prepare to bond with 75 tons of high-tensile robot. Direct every movement of your machine and slug your way to victory over colossal opponents in brutal hand-to-hand combat (plus missiles, lasers, shooting fists, boomerangs, and much more). Freeway overpass in the way? Take it down. Buildings crowding you? Knock 'em over. 

Much more than a simple action game, Robot Alchemic Drive accurately simulates the operation of a remote-controlled metal titan in crowded, active urban environments. Use your giant robot as a tool to defeat enemies, complete missions, and much more.

Treat your robot well and you will be rewarded. Abuse your robot and, well, you'll wish you hadn't.
