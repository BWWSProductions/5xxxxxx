,user2101,2010-02-22T14:15Z,"Nice Upload, all 100% working, most of them in NTSC. I say: please Big Dude, can you upload the following games?:
- Silent Hill Origins
- Resident Evil 4, Outbreak 1&2
- Enter the Matrix
- Syphon Filter Dark Mirror
- Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary, Underworld

I think you have uploaded other games except for them, it would complete the sagas.

Thanks a lot, and I wish you could upload at least some of them.

Greetings"

[V],Big_dude,2010-02-24T20:50Z,"yeah I thing silent hill origins is already been uploaded, shouldn't be hard to find others well
I get requests it depends if some need put thru or not."
,user2101,2010-03-04T13:39Z,"Thanks for the answer. Well, I know their are other Silent Hill Origins uploads, but with Big Dude uploads I have never had any kind of problem. In the othe hand... a lot of the uploads are PAL... anyway, I'll download them, but of course if Big Dude upload them, I'll RE-download them =)
Not any kind of obsesive-compulsive.
*Greetings and thanks Big Dude & thenoobish*"
[V],Big_dude,2010-03-07T07:08Z,"lol yeah I have your request maybe if I can get around to some of them I don't know, stay posted."
