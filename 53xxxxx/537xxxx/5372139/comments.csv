[T],Shepard76,2010-04-29T19:20Z,Not at all. I only wanted to make a tribute to Bioware's magnificent game and contribute people join the mass effect community. Totally agree. This game is simply amazing. Read the books of Mass Effect and don't miss the comics too :-)

,TyMod,2011-07-16T20:24Z,You can use cheetah dvd burner to burn the files.  I have even used PowerISO to burn some dvds.  But you will need a Dual-Layer DVD burner and DVD to burn this.  I re-encoded it with CloneDVD to make it fit on a 4.7 GB DVD.
