Do you think you could upload Skins seasons?

Thanks."
[V],McTav,2010-02-20T08:31Z,"Never heard of it, therefore no. not because im mean or anything, im just uploading my dvd collection rips of my own. I have yet to do requests, unless people start sending me money to buy stuff wont happen"
,209fuzzy,2010-02-24T05:27Z,"McTav... damn, I have so much to be thankful for; my girlfriend, pc's, videogames, TV, football, air conditioning, ball bearings, wd40, bikinis, bar code, LEGO, light bulb, post-its, silicone, rollercoasters, internet, but you know what? You and your uploads are up there I'd say in between TV and football. McTav you have brought life to my Zune once again, the quality and greatness of your uploads are 10/10 my friend. I just want to say thanx. "
,209fuzzy,2010-02-24T05:30Z,Oh by the way McTav do you have any Futurama available? Or any of the 4 movies made for that show?
[V],McTav,2010-02-24T07:16Z,"@209fuzzy

,Gangchester,2010-03-18T07:29Z,wow..Thank SO MUCH' YR Simpsons Season RIP R THA BEST SO FAR! ANY MORE Simpsons Season COMING?
[V],McTav,2010-03-19T16:26Z,"so its been a while, ive been extremely busy in real life, and have had the worst luck in history with hard drives dieing left and right, and there seems to be an issue with my raid. But i am also wondering how interested people will be in bluray rips? I picked up a bluray rom drive and have been ripping bluray seasons.

right now i have season 13 of southpark in 720p, and the Samurai Champloo series. with that being said of course the file size will be much larger (550mb per episode) i need to know if people are actually going to seed that."
,m-k_gangsta,2010-03-19T17:56Z,McTav no way man dont worry about Bluray i wont seed it or download it its to large i cant use  that much space we like the way ur uploads are now ... plz keep them like they are now dont change it to bluray

[V],Team_xRG,2010-03-22T14:58Z,well ..blueray rips are good for me but yea it would be difficult to seed and would take long time for u too 
,Gangchester,2010-03-23T08:40Z,first upload The Simpsons Season from 4-12..thanks
,EBAndrew,2010-03-25T04:18Z,"I've always like HD torrents for shows that the difference in quality makes a difference; movies and high-budget TV shows (BSG and the like,) but as another poster mentioned, the quality of the torrents you up are top-notch as it is."
,EBAndrew,2010-03-25T04:19Z,Uh... lol. So that's a 'no' from me on bluray uploads as well.
,ChaserHUN,2010-03-25T20:25Z,"Hey!
Thanks for the upload!
Will you upload the other seasons? It would be great!"
,REAPER18,2010-03-29T06:29Z,"Hey McTav,

You should really check out ""It's Alway Sunny in Philadelphia"". 

It's one of the best comedy shows, and I think it HAS to be in your collection. Please consider it, thank you.

Appreciate all your releases! "
,Cheyenne-tgy,2010-03-29T12:24Z,"thanks a lot...

,waif68,2010-07-21T20:41Z,"Had no prob w/Ur others, but this one won't burn right. U use different compression? Plays fine off PC but not off disc. I use Imgburn. Got all latest Codecs and even tried DivXfixx. Like I said, I've had no probs with any others. Mystery to me?"
,waif68,2010-07-24T01:19Z,"Scratch my other comment, I found the problem and it was all mine.
Thanx 4 the great stuff McTav. I seed as much as I can. I've got very limited memory on my old dinosaur."

I've looked around forever and can't find a good quality torrent. I see that you said you won't be doing any more uploads, but if you happen to change your mind-I'm your number 1 fan. Haha"
,nikoHD,2011-03-26T04:51Z,Just wanted to say a big thanks for all the office seasons. If you ever upload something else would you be able to do American idol season 1 because i cant find it anywhere. Thanks man.
