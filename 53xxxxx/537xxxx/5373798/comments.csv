Q: Do you if this will ""play nice"" with k-lite? i.e. If I need to install some other codecs for other needs, this won't screw up the functionality of this app?"

Couldn't get WMP to work even after downloading fresh copy from MS.  Only way to fix it was to reinstall Media Convert.  Media Convert becomes left click default app for video and audio files (under my XP system)."
