Comments:

This epic movie was finally released on DVD by Warner Bros. in Nov.'09.

I ripped the file presented here as a VOB directly from an original DVD and in this fortunate circumstance I was able to simply change the file extension from VOB->MPG without the timecoding getting screwed up so nothing needed to be done to the original VOB in order to make it play as an MPEG2.

As mentioned on the Warner Bros. Archive Collection site, this movie HAS NOT been digitally remastered, it's simply a transfer from the original film. As is typical of a simple film transfer with no remastering the contrast, brightness, and saturation are not wonderful and some dust as well as some artifacts of the transfer process can be seen at certain instances throughout. I really didn't find that it detracted from the movie in the slightest. Although a digital remastering would have been nice, I honestly don't expect that will ever happen given how long it took for a release that is a simple film transfer to DVD.

Given its size this movie should easily fit on a single layer DVD/DVD5.

Please seed this file!

Enjoy!
