flipping amazing mate - thanks to warner bros (and amazon.com I think) for at last releasing this DVD. But it doesn't do it justice, it ought to be remastered and given a cinema release - then that's not how the world works, it would be deemed out of date and is destined to slip into obscurity whilst I'm sure there is a massive number of people, young people even, who rate this film above all other animated films and we all have to put up with the sh*t which constantly bombards us from the ""entertainments"" industry - for me this is probably the second greatest animated fantasy - second only to Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky in my opinion.
Anyway, I've seeded this to a ratio of three as per this comment - come on people, lets get a horde of seeders on this one. By the way any chance of making a torrent of the TS? Until I can buy the DVD myself which I will."
