American Todd Margaret (David Cross) bluffs his way into an apparently great job opportunity, heading up the sales team in his employer's London office. All he has to do is sell a dozen container loads of dodgy Korean energy drink before his psychotic boss visits him in a week. Simple. Apart from the fact that he knows nothing about British culture and nothing about sales. He also only has one employee to assist him, Dave, who is perhaps the most willfully unhelpful employee ever.

Todd's life is further complicated when he lies continuously to cover his ignorance and spectacularly fails to impress beautiful cafe owner Alice. Dave soon takes full advantage of Todd's situation and chaos ensues.
