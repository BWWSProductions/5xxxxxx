,gkm0,2010-02-25T01:19Z,Works Great! As noted by jmdr the only issue would be with sas dates and times. Which even with &sysdate. &systime option will show when the app was launched. For code development... it wont matter. :) Get it! Its lightweight and fast loading.

I have Windows 7 (64-bits) so I thought this did not work because of that. 

So I downloaded SAS v9.0 portable. For thate, I get the following error: 
Error: Configuration file ""C:\Program Files\SAS\SAS System\9.0\nls\en\SASV9.CFG"""" is unreadable.

Both have to do with the CFG file. Am I missing something obvious here? Please help..."
,jmdr,2010-03-02T08:48Z,"Sorry mrs27, SAS 9.0 & 9.1.3 do not work on 64-bit systems (and Windows 7 is not officially supported yet either). Windows XP (32-bit) works great, and see http://support.sas.com/techsup/pcn/vista.html for more details of which versions of Vista are supported. 

Downloaders--if you're running this in either Vista or 7, please leave a comment to confirm for everyone else..."
,moroncina,2010-03-07T20:23Z,Have exactly the same problem as mrs27. I have installed windows xp sp3. What could be here the issue?
,jmdr,2010-03-08T04:01Z,"hmm, try upgrading to the latest Java Runtime Environment ( http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp ).

'hope that helps..."
,moroncina,2010-03-09T21:37Z,"unfortunately it didnt help. My system if following:
CPU Atom 1,3 GHz
1 GB Ram
XP home edition Version 2002 SP3
and it is in German.
I aggregated those facts that might be the problem. "
,jmdr,2010-03-10T05:26Z,'sorry to hear it's not working for you. Try this one ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5298726/SAS_v9_Portable ) for a portable version of version 9.0.0 or ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4006488/SAS_v9.0.0_with_licence ) for a full installation version. I'll try to get around to posting a copy of the full 9.1.3 installation files soon.

,kji2009,2010-05-08T05:36Z,"Works great! Thank you so much!
Previously downloaded SAS v9.0.0 with licence at
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4006488/SAS_v9.0.0_with_licence
but somehow the installation was giving some trouble. 
This one works like a charm."
,808sm1th,2010-05-19T16:22Z,"I was able to get this to work on windows 7 x64. However, I already have a fully functioning version in place. I copied the sasv9.cfg from my installation directory (in ""C:\Program Files (x86)\SAS\SAS 9.1\nls\en"") to the directory SAS was looking in for the cfg file. My cfg file had references to my full installation. It may be possible to set up the directories and get a copy of the cfg file, but you'll probably get a crippled version of SAS. The only advantage I see for this release is that it automatically adjusts the system time. 
If you have an old version of SAS, you can get an older license and install that by changing you computer's date to within the license period. Every time you start SAS, you'll have to change your date each time. This 'portable' version will do that for you. 
I was hoping for a version of SAS that I could put on a thumb drive, but I don't think that would be possible. Can anyone confirm that they have used this on a thumb drive or other removable media on a computer that did not have SAS installed previously?"

,hopjo,2011-02-04T06:23Z,"I love this standalone executable.  the only unfortunate thing is it does not seem to contain the glimmix patch/update, meaning it cannot estimate generalized mixed models with empirical standard errors (which is the reason I need the program).  any chance of adding this essential component?  I downloaded the executable from the SAS website but it likely would only work on a pre-installed version....  The glimmix patch came out with version 9.1.3 (2006) so I'm surprised the function isn't recognized."

,just_ask,2011-11-24T22:33Z,"eth works fine, but one important thing, i cannot open or import/export any databases with this portable version. 

 I mean i have a database from my previous sas (9.2) and I tried to open a it or import it into this version. but when i open explorer window within sas it does not see any ""external"" database files :/ As well, when i try to export already existing in this portable version tables, eth seems fine, but they are exported only virtually! i can see in SAS that files were exported e.g. to a txt file, but in windows they are not physically created ina specified folder.

 btw, when i check access path to the SAS files within the program it says that they are in c:\program files\sas\ but in windows there is no such a folder! ( i saved they exe file to c:\sas\) 

 any ideas how to go around this issue? thx
