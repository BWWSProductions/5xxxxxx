Plot Outline


American astronaut Captain Charles "Chuck" Baker lands on Planet 51
thinking he's the first person to step foot on it. To his surprise, 
he finds that this planet is inhabited by little green people who are 
happily living in a white picket fence world, and whose only fear is 
that it will be overrun by alien invaders...like Chuck!
