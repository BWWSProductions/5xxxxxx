Seems you don't start it by using the desktop shortcut but you have to go to run the \bin\NecroVisioN.exe directly instead.

,RMJ13,2010-02-20T09:38Z,"  I tried two versions of this!  I think it is a ATI issue as it was with all the stalker games! 

 I share my experence,s with others in order to share knowledge, And let others know.  I don,t come here to complaign.   I,m not gonna comment here on the other games because it has nothing to do with this ! 

 So if you can,t help, or anything constructive to say!

 KEEP YOUR VINDICTIVE COMMENTS TO YOUR CHILDISH SELVES!

,RMJ13,2010-02-20T16:55Z,"ATI user,s  This game will only run on DX10 ATI has driver issue for this game  which means this game will only work on VISTA and WINDOWS 7 for now! 

 here is how u can get it to work

make a copy of your  ""config.ini"" folder from the game,to your desk top, then change the ""Cfg.RenderDevice"" in the ""config.ini"" file from 1 to 2. then remove the orignal file save it somewhere and replace with the one you just fixed!  WALLA!

 your welcome!  this will only work on DX10  ATI will be addressing this soon I,m sure ! 


 Cfg.RenderDevice = 2  make it look like this  or just copy and paste this! "
,RMJ13,2010-02-20T16:58Z,"WELL help improve stuff and stop complaigning your self,   AT LEAST I HELP!

,Ex0duS_5150,2010-02-20T18:31Z,"Why is it ATI has so many driver issues all the time? Driver patch for this, hot fix for that, lame. So glad I went with Nvidia"
,waistland,2010-02-20T18:54Z,Game works with noCDcrack but once I installed the patches it crashes
,RMJ13,2010-02-20T20:47Z,"I have had ATI for over 10 years!  the only issues I have had with Drivers were with this game and STalker!  I had the exact same issue with stalker thats How I remmbered how to fix this! 

 And after playing this for 10 minutes  it went where Stalker went!  TRASH!  Graphics were just VERY BAD!  What year is this?  those guys that make those games need to Play other games to see where graphics are in 2010!"
,RMJ13,2010-02-20T20:53Z,"And never blame it on the Video card makers  IT TOTALY UP TO THE DEVELOPERS TO TEST AND SUBMIT NEW PROJECTS  and tell card makers ! 

 VIdeo card makers are not mind readers!   Only  the LOW END developers cannot seem to afford the PROPER DEVELOPMENT! "
,tedwu,2010-02-24T08:09Z,"Does anyone have the issue of error message window showing up then crashed to windows after hitting okay on the message? This only happened after Chapter 6. Tried different nodvd and the  config.ini trick suggested here. No luck still on chapter 6. I am using win 7 x86, ati 4890 xxx by XFX. Noiced complaint included self experiece with ATI since it's company is sold off to amd. XFX company has fast card however unstable driver too. (only what I find) Tried running it in virtual XP too no chance as well. My cpu won't take 64 bit system no luck for me there. IF you have a clue please share. If I can't reply again I am sorry not to ignore you and properly thank those whom wished to help but I seem to have issue sending message through piratebay at time. Let me thanks you ahead of time for your attention and any help you may be willing to provide. I will seed as long as I can."

,flyingsamir,2010-03-18T12:04Z,"I fixed the ATI problem easily!Just right click on the game icon,select shortcut,and you'll see a target path like ""C:\Program Files\1C Company\NecroVisioN Lost Company\Bin\NecroVisioN.exe"" and just add +dx10 with space and click ok.You'll get path like ""C:\Program Files\1C Company\NecroVisioN Lost Company\Bin\NecroVisioN.exe"" +dx10 and you'll be able to play on Windows 7 32-bit with ATI!"
,powerchord,2010-03-20T21:01Z,"Im having an issue at the very start of the game. ""No mans Land"" loads up, but there is no terrain. The map loads and i start falling until I eventually die. Any ideas on a fix?"
