,lainy1054,2010-02-28T23:03Z,"this is the third time I have downloaded this and I hope it isnt this that is giving my laptop the virus, it will be the only thing I have downloaded since I cleared the laptop so I will keep you posted if it is, if it isnt I am really sorry, I have downloaded alot of your torrents and will be really dissappointed if your torrent is the source of this virus as I lost alot of photos of my daughter which where irreplacible since she is not with us any more"
