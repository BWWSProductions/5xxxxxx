I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I everything I try to update/crack it says it did it then automatically open up the demo version of fruity loops, and everything from poizone to sakura, are all demos. Am I doing something wrong or is this normal? "

,v-i-k-a-s-h,2010-02-21T20:11Z,actually with the older versions

Anyone have a RegKey or Better Crack for 9.04?"
