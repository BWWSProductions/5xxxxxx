""Any chance of seeing Past Life episode 3 back up here? ""

>twentyforty at 2010-02-20 07:25 CET: 

""@rnra: Change your tone (tune)... please. Past Life NEVER entered my schedule. Past Life pilot was upped because I tend to up the pilot episodes. Ep. 2 was up 'cause of free slot.

I am tolerant now ONLY because I know that you are regular here and I know that we all have bad days,

...BUT, never forget to say plain, common ""Please"". Not just to me... ""

Capisce?

@sakiv: Read written above. But Thanks is good too, as for Request.

Spartacus will be upped after Smallville (in weekly Schedule)."
