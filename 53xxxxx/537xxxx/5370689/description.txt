4hero are an electronic music band from Dollis Hill, North West London, comprising of producers Mark 'Marc Mac' Clair & Dennis 'Dego' McFarlane.

While the band is often cited as "4 Hero" or "4-Hero", the name is presented as "4hero" on their own albums and websites.

They are known as early pioneers of breakbeat hardcore and drum and bass music, and the group obtained a Mercury Music Prize nomination for their 1998 album Two Pages. More recently, on their 2007 album, Play with the Changes, 4hero has experimented with downtempo and Nu jazz.

Mark 'Marc Mac' Clair & Dennis 'Dego' McFarlane continue to produce music as 4hero as well as a variety of other aliases they've developed over the years.
