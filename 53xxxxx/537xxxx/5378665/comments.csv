,nivrex,2010-11-08T15:02Z,wow. Thanks for this. wanted to study it and was surprised that this site actually has a torrent up for this. and a healthy one at that.
,daycab,2010-12-12T03:35Z,God wants you to pirate the Bible...
,janat08,2010-12-23T19:11Z,"You don't know god. Bible isn't meant to be sold, supposedly when you buy you're just covering the cost of producing it."
,the.count,2011-01-28T08:50Z,"Thanks for the up! :D

The Magnet Link didnt work for me. Showed up as a dead torrent. The .torrent file worked perfectly. 

Thx again."
,DevilNuts,2011-03-03T10:14Z,"There are other reasons to want to read the bible than simply believing in it. Regardless of the truths (or lack thereof) contained within, the King James Bible is, like it or not, one of the cornerstones of English literature and has been since it was translated into it's current incarnation in the seventeenth century. 

While there are many among us who do not subscribe to the Christian belief system, it can scarcely be denied that we owe much of even our intellectual heritage to many profound works of literature, culture and art that were derived from somewhere within its daft, misguided pages. 

I am reading the bible because I feel it is important to understand the full nature of something if I am to intelligently argue against [or even for] it. My purpose is not one of spiritual fulfillment, and I would caution you against discouraging anyone to read anything. 

I say read and learn as much as you can about anything - especially those things which you are skeptical about - and keep always present the confidence in your ability to decide for yourself those things you wish to believe.

,beestripe,2011-03-21T22:14Z,"Be warned, this is a raw interpretation of the KJV. For a novice to get any understanding from it, I'd say they'd likely need it to be read out to them in Church.
I'm told the Oxford World's Classics version is by far the best for an objective reader, which includes non-secular notes and references to help put things in context.
Not that I have been able to source an ebook version thus far..."
,lokust167,2011-04-03T01:11Z,"Every second of your lives, you make choices that affect the whole world or indeed the entire universe - you can grow up to be a doctor discover cure for cancer, aids etc, or become a teacher or be just a plain moron.
Everyone is interconnected. Each decision leads to one possible direction from an infinite amount choices, but you can traverse only one.

For you it is simply a 1 dimensional line. but there a are infinite branches at every infinitesimal points on the line you[and the universe] are traversing. NOW COMES THE STUPID PART, GOD KNOWS ALL THE INFINITE CHOICES AT ALL THE INFINITESIMAL POINTS AND ALL THE INFINITE ALTERNATIVE POSSIBILITIES THAT EVERY ATOM OR EVEN AN ELECTRON IN THE UNIVERSE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO. 
AND HE KNOWS WHICH PATH THE UNIVERSE WILL GO AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT TOO!!! AND YOU THINK HE GIVES A RAT'S ASS ABOUT WHETHER YOU WORSHIP HIM OR NOT???"
,downloadmeee123,2011-05-12T21:32Z,great. thanks for uploading. real books are fucking expensive.

,JohnShit,2011-11-01T17:38Z,"I'm not a Christian, but I'm still downloading this. Thanks!"
,VINEHOOD,2011-12-14T03:56Z,good job prince
,sbm_from_la,2012-07-15T11:51Z,"I don't like to be the one to criticize, but this torrent is pretty useless because it's just one long .pdf file.  The person who created it must have been a newbie because the Bible isn't index so you can't just jump to different chapters or search.

Since the bible is a free download, I suggest getting and using a version that's more professionally done.  Just search Google for Holy Bible or just this one:
