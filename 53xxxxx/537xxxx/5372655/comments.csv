,irmitarosa,2011-09-02T22:43Z,"Thanks for the upload but unfortunately it's not working for me. I get the following message: 
Unable to write to C:/Program Files (x86) Wondershare/Flash Gallery Factory/LiveUpdate.ini. When I click ok I get another windows that says: Fail to set data for 'Data"".

I click that small window and it opens. I can select the photos,  and the template. But then I get the same message when I try to Publish. Do you have an idea of what it's happening. I uninstalled it, restarted the computer and installed it again, but still the same problem. 

I would appreciate your help. Thanks."
