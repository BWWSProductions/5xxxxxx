Synopis: Karim works at an ostrich farm outside of Tehran, Iran. He leads a simple and contented life with his family
in his small house, until one day when one of the ostriches runs away. Karim is blamed for the loss and is fired from
the farm. Soon after, he travels to the city in order to repair his elder daughters hearing aid but finds himself mistaken
for a motorcycle taxi driver. Thus begins his new profession: ferrying people and goods through heavy traffic. But the people
and material goods that he deals with daily starts to transform Karims generous and honest nature, much to the distress
of his wife and daughters. It is up to those closest to him to restore the values that he had once cherished.
