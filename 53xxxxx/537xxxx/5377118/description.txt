Hi, my name is not important and my health is not in question.

I spend a lot of my time trying to wake people up to the false political system and the possible conspiracies plaguing our world today.

I do this mostly by discussing history and relating to people on a personal level, how corruption and the fake political system work only
to make life more difficult and, as people in the conspiracy research field know, SO FRUSTRATING!!!

This is the first time I've done anything for any kind of broadcast so you'll notice I'm nervous in my voice and jumping from topic to
topic.

I believe in spreading awareness but not being preachy and talking down to people, unless the facts seem overwhelming, to make a 
particular point.

Everyone interested in this research and taking part in this research should start making some real noise.

I'd like feedback of any kind. I intend to be trying this out for quite a while as I would like to devise a series of different tactics for the 
awareess raising of others.

This means I need to speak to as many people as possible. If you have any ideas to share please do. I'll be holding open skype chats soon. Speaking live and accepting calls to discuss with anyone and everyone as long as there's no dogmatic, stubborn-minded idiocy.

I can be contacted at Fight_The-Future@hotmail.co.uk
