Made for TV, and based on the true story of the wreck of an American bomber found in the Libyan desert in 1960, where the crew's bodies were never found, Sole Survivor is a wartime ghost tale. The ghosts of a bomber crew hang around their crashed plane, awaiting the day that their bones will be recovered and given a decent burial. The sole survivor, navigator Russell Hamner (Richard Basehart), has in the intervening 25 years become a general. He joins an investigation team that has come across the wreckage, while the ghosts, headed by Major Devlin (Vince Edwards), plot to expose Hamner as a coward who deserted his post and left his crew-mates to die.
