NEVER ENOUGH (ORIGINAL MIX)

Driving club beats and arpeggio basslines blend with atmospheric textures and distorted keys in this slice of Electro Disco and 80s New Wave. Rhythmic guitars and haunting atmospherics propel the track into a chorus of dark vocals and piercing synthesizer layers.


NEVER ENOUGH (THE LONDON ACADEMY OF TRANCE REMIX)

One of Dave Pearceâ€™s new producers of 2008, The London Academy of Trance takes the track straight to the dancefloor whilst maintaining the edgy vibes of the original mix. Euphoric synths weave alongside pounding house beats before dropping with dirty electro basslines. Twisted vocals battle with uplifting keyboards to seal the plot in this dancefloor friendly smasher.


NEVER ENOUGH (BEN FAWCE REMIX)

USA producer Ben Fawce brings a Down Tempo and Dub Step vibe to the track.
The remix rolls out with sinister atmospheres over broken Dub Step beats before the killer drop of grimey, throbbing bass stabs. Vocoder vocals and twittering synths add to the mix to create a dark and intense reworking.


NEVER ENOUGH (CLUB MIX)

The original mix gets an extended club workout blending Italo-Disco elements with stomping four to the floor beats. Arpeggiated basslines and vocoder voiced stabs bring an 80s Disco feel to the proceedings before dropping into a dark groove with the original vocals.


NEVER ENOUGH (Q-BIK REMIX)

Fast becoming one of the DJs at the forefront of the Drum & Bass scene, Australian based Q-Bik delivers a D&B dancefloor smasher with obvious influences from the likes of Pendulum & High Contrast. Blending uplifting vibes with jump up style basslines, over stadium D&B two step beats, Q-Bik
delivers a diverse remix with wide appeal.
