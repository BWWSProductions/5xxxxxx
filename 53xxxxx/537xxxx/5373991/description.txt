Directed by Melanie Harris

Arthur Ransome is best known now for translations of
Russian folk tales, and the Swallows and Amazons novels.

But once he was far better known for a scandalous libel
suit with Lord Alfred Douglas (Oscar Wilde's 'Bosie'),
and then for being overseas correspondent in Russia for
The Daily News, and then for The Manchester Guardian.

He was in Russia during the 1917 revolutions, and the
post WWI western interventions in Russia. His political
stance made him unpopular with the UK's intelligence
services, who seem to have blackmailed him into doing
some work for them. At the same time he was posting
articles sympathetic to the Bolshevik's.

This is some of the story.
