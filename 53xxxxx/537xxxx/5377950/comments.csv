,tommcd,2010-02-20T11:21Z,"Thanks a lot Raymond!
I have been looking for the DVD rip of this for quite a while. I will seed this sucker for quite a while as well."
,AWu-TangLife,2010-02-21T06:09Z,"Be careful of this fat fucking piece of shit snake in the grass Michael Moore. His job is to dumb the truth down & make it more paletable for the masses.

When asked why he does not ask the tough 9/11 questions (NORAD standing down!), his reply is ""That would be un-american"".


*** If you are looking for some actual HARD HITTING documentary film making, may I suggest one of Alex Jones's many films***


FUCK YOUR BIAS, YOUR RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY, AND MOST OF ALL FUCK LIMP BIZKIT ! ! ! !"
,AWu-TangLife,2010-02-21T06:10Z,"oh ya, THX uploader"
,tommcd,2010-02-21T15:41Z,"@ AWu-TangLife,
I agree 100%. 
Moore's films do ask a lot of the right questions though. He is skilled at laying bare the abuses of corporate America.
It is too bad that he does not get to the toot causes of our problems the way that Alex Jones and G Edward Griffin do."
,tommcd,2010-02-21T15:42Z,"... err, I meant root causes of our problems (stupid keyboard!!)."
,chicken-,2010-02-21T20:35Z,"AWu-TangLife hahaha.  You sound like trash to me.  He dumbs it down so it's ""paletable"" for idiots like you.  "

,TaiTheGuy,2010-02-23T11:08Z,"My viewpoint represents only the first 17 minutes or so but DAMN!!! This is 1 of the most entertaining documentaries I've seen since... Dare I say ""Loose Change""??? K, not that far but at least maybe... ""High Price Of Low Cost"" (Wal-Mart Docu).

Many thanks seeders!
Keep it up Ray. 
You are to aXXo what suboxone is to Oxycontin.
Or Methadone to Heroine.
Only difference is YOU'RE doin' the work here @ TPB."
,francoNY,2010-02-25T21:39Z,A/10 V/10 Great torrent...thanks a lot
[T],bozo71,2010-03-12T12:15Z,"Thanks for the 2 disc upload. I prefer a larger file for better resolution. I simply connect them with Virtualdub.

Thanks again!"
,Sphynx-cat,2010-03-16T21:33Z,"Thank you raymondhome.

This is true DVD quality 10/10 on all counts.
Thank you for the excellent rip - 1.4Gig should be the standard!

On the film all I have to say is Everyone must see it."
,toshiro9101968,2010-03-24T18:06Z,thanks man
,fat47,2010-07-06T17:55Z,"For another great movie about capitalist pigs, check out the corporation if you haven't already. Great documentary. http://www.thecorporation.com/"
,FSmonster,2010-07-08T09:34Z,Awww shucks - capitalist running dogs ... corporate conspiracies... rampant paranoia and almost no understanding of the realites of life. So who just started Uni/College then ?? ;)
,mhikl,2010-09-27T10:53Z,"Sadly AWu-TangLife, Alex Jones's is how most American's think and Michael Moore is how thinking Americans want to believe. Your anger says which kind you are. Why do you have to tell yourselves so often how ""free"" you are. As a great Brit once wrote, ""the lady doth protest too much'. Cheers raymondhome.  "

,samuelk44,2011-08-06T13:59Z,"@AWu-TangLife

Alex Jones?  You DO NOT know Alex jones...    
He's a damn idiot Thinking he's a damn activist.
