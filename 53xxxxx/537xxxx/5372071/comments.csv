like I said to you tho I don't know how the program is supposed to work and hope there is no problems.

,MythS2S,2010-02-18T12:05Z,"Also on my files you like please give me a + on the Quality jersson :)

,jersson,2010-02-18T15:00Z,"Is there a crack enclosed to the portable vers ?
It looks like that or am I confused here ?
I,m a novice you know."
,MythS2S,2010-02-19T04:33Z,"Yes there is, hows the program working so far?"
,jersson,2010-02-19T06:10Z,"I think I need som instructions how to install this one, starting by the 7-zip file manager and then what... please"
,MythS2S,2010-02-19T08:35Z,"Its all made to be portable, I love 7Zip so I gave users 7Zip portable incase they need to extract or zip some files on a computer that is not theirs.
As for Atomic Mail Sender.
Just click on it two times on a windows XP computer
it should load up."
,jersson,2010-02-20T13:25Z,"When I click  the 7-zip I get 3 options, computer, document, network and which one to click of those 3 icons ?"
,MythS2S,2010-02-20T19:24Z,"Dude only click on the Atomic Mail Sender
forget about the 7Zip folder "
,jersson,2010-02-20T20:20Z,"Ok that's a relief. Final question, do I have to uninstall my vers 4.25 before installing this or can I install this one one top ?"
,jersson,2010-02-20T23:29Z,"Got this error message when I tried to install
 ""failed to get data for recwin _top"
,MythS2S,2010-02-21T04:22Z,"Dude
nothing needs to be installed its made to be portable
the error message is because you did not enter something for the TSP or whatever
it should still load up the program after that error message
and it should work
and you dont need to uninstall anything bro"
