I have at least one CD of Platipus 9 (double CD issue, but one of them is a bit dull (imo) so I only have one on mp3, might have the original around though), and also a bunch of Reactivate albums (the good ones that I could find!)


Don't really know what's best for contact details as I don't really want to leave my email address on here. I'm assuming you're in the UK - if so you can contact me on my mobile on 0 7 8 3 3 4 9 7 5 6 8 - feel free to send me a text or something.

cheers,
Tom."
