Conor Oberst [2009] One Of My Kind:  The Story Of The Mystic Valley Band [MP4-720p]


One of My Kind is a 2009 documentary filmed about Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band.  It documents their tour, life in Mexico, and the recording of their new album, "Outer South."  This documentary was provided for free, in hopes that the viewers would donate to one of the numerous charities on the sponsoring website.

This video can be downloaded for free from the site above (which is where I got it from), but I wanted to share it with others and provide another outlet for it, as I know many people don't know about it!  Enjoy!

P.S.:  In case you didn't know Conor Oberst is most well known for being the lead man of "Bright Eyes", but he also collaborated on the Monsters of Folk group, has done quite a bit of solo work, and now is heading up this band "The Mystic Valley Band"
