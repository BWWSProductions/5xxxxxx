(This text is copied and pasted directly from the Readme.txt file in the torrent.)

Also, I do own the actual retail copy of this game, and if you like it, I ask that you please go out and spend however much it costs at your local retailer for this game so we can support Capcom and their ability to create awesome games such as this. If not this game, then at least SOMETHING by Capcom. Thanks.
This is my first torrent by the way.
PLEASE SEED AS MUCH AS YOU DOWNLOAD!!!
The trackers included with this torrent is a collection that I have accumulated. Please feel free to copy and paste them into every torrent you download, as that will increase your chances of getting more seeds/peers, therefore increasing your download speed. ENJOY!!!

Directly from the retail box:

Devil May Cry 4
---------------

System Requirements:

OS: Windows XP/Vista/7
CPU: Intel Pentium 4 or higher
RAM: 512MB for XP/ 1GB for Vista/7
Video:  VRAM 256MB or higher; GeForce 6600 or higher

Increased performance will be noticed on more powerful systems.

===================================================================
===================================================================
Now what I have to say about it. F**K what the box's system requirements tell you.
In my honest opinion, this game would be COMPLETELY unplayayble on this type of
system. I would recommend AT LEAST:
OS: Vista/7
CPU: Dual-Core, 2GHz
RAM: 2GB DDR-2
Video: GeForce 8400 (NOT PCI, PCI-E highly recommended!!!!!!)
Sound: Creative Labs X-Fi
Controller: Either a Playstation 2-type gamepad or XBOX 360 controller for PC. Though it is possible to play this with the mouse and keyboard, I highly recommend spending $25 for a decent gamepad.
======================================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================================

For those of you wondering if a crack or serial or keygen or any of that is required, not at all.
However, you DO need to have the disc in to play, so I would suggest either using Daemon Tools to
mount it or burning this .iso onto a dual-layer DVD.
======================================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================================

I have included a 100% save file.

It goes into the following directory after you install the game:

C:UsersYOUR ACCOUNT NAME HEREDocumentsCAPCOMDEVILMAYCRY4

Upon a fresh installation, there should be no files there.

I DID NOT CREATE THIS SAVE FILE. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO OWNERSHIP OF THIS FILE. IT WAS GIVEN TO ME
BY A FRIEND, WHO ALSO DID NOT CREATE THIS FILE. HE DOWNLOADED IT FROM GAMESPOT I THINK, SO WHOEVER
SPENT THE TIME AND PUT FORTH THE AMAZING EFFORT TO UNLOCK EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME, MAD MAD PROPS!!!!
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS

1) Use WinRAR to extract the .iso file to a directory of your choice.
   OR
   Mount the .iso using mounting program.
   OR
   Burn the .iso onto a dual-layer DVD.
  (I have included a way to turn one dual-layer disk into 2 regualr DVD's.)
  (I have included a No-DVD crack as well.)

2) Install the game.

3) Copy and Paste the 100% Save File into   C:UsersYOUR ACCOUNT NAME HEREDocumentsCAPCOMDEVILMAYCRY4

4) Copy and Paste the No-DVD crack(s) into the main game folder, which is usually:
											32-bit OS = C:Program FilesCAPCOMDEVILMAYCRY4
											64-bit OS = C:Program Files (x86)CAPCOMDEVILMAYCRY4

5) Create a shortcut from the main game folder for DMC4Launcher.exe onto the Desktop.

6) Double-click that shortcut and you should be good to go, with no DVD needed to play + 100% save file.
