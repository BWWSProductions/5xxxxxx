,SLeePYG86,2010-02-18T00:58Z,THIS IS THE CORRECT TORRENT. SORRY FOR THE MIX-UP.
,SLeePYG86,2010-02-18T09:35Z,"OH YEAH, EVERYTHING HAS BEEN TESTED ON MY PERSONAL PC, SO THIS IS A GOOD, LEGIT TORRENT. ENJOY!"
,SLeePYG86,2010-02-18T22:02Z,Please post here after you have downloaded and tested.
,Matrix271,2010-02-24T09:47Z,Hey i did everything that was asked but it says put in the original disk when i use a CD and when i use the no DVD_fix it ask for the CD...help please
,SLeePYG86,2010-02-24T19:43Z,"@Matrix271... you said it asks for original disk when you use cd.... did you burn the .iso file as an image to disk? DVD to be more specific? I couldn't get the crack to work for me, that's why I included the extra stuff; just in case.

1) If you want to have it on disc, either use a dual-layer DVD, or use the 2-DVD's fix I included with the torrent to put it on two regular DVD's. When you burn it, I recommend Nero Burning ROM (NOT Xpress or StartSmart or any others). Start a new project, then click (at the top) Recorder, then Burn Image. Find the .iso file, and away you go.

2) You should be able to use something like Daemon Tools to mount the .iso to a virtual drive and get it working that way, but as I said in my description (hopefully you read it), I am not experienced with the mounting procedure.

Please post back ASAP with your findings. I keep a watchful eye on this page (just in case someone needs help), so I'm likely to answer to the same day you post."
,SLeePYG86,2010-02-24T19:46Z,Hmm... now I see I didn't mention I'm not experienced with the mounting procedure. Sorry about that.
,RandHat,2010-02-24T20:56Z,"After downloading(took forever) and installing successfully, when I try to start the game, all I get is a black screen.

Note: I have done all that is mentioned above(mount) and my system is way above requirement."
,SLeePYG86,2010-02-24T21:58Z,"@Randhat...
I am assuming you are using the No-DVD-Crack to start the game. That didn't work out for me either; that's why I included the original .iso as well as the  ""disk-split"" method as alternatives. The game requires the disk to play, and the No-DVD-Cracks don't work, so I believe it is now official that you must either burn the game onto a disk or disks; otherwise mount.
==============================================================
To everyone else, PLEASE read the information about the torrent as well as the comments BEFORE d/l'ing//posting. If you still have trouble - then like I said before, I keep a close eye on this page in case someone needs help. I'll do the best that I can."
,RandHat,2010-02-24T23:19Z,"What do you mean otherwise mount, that's exactly what I did as I have stated in my previous comment.
If the No-DVD-Cracks don't work, why include it in the instruction? If I don't use the cracks the securom error message will pop up.
And there is no alternative to step 4 (Copy and paste No-DVD cracks), so how do you expect people to get this game to work?
Now I'm stuck with this non-working dmc4 and can't even uninstall it because the uninstaller doesn't work.. all I want is find out how to uninstall this now."
,Matrix271,2010-02-25T05:52Z,I burned it 2 a dual layer dvd but it says remove back up and insert  original disk to continue. I used nero and i am kinda stuck. i can try splitting it into 2 dvd's if u think that will work
,Matrix271,2010-02-25T05:53Z,RandHat  just go into add and remove programs in ur windows control panel and u should be able to remove the game
,SLeePYG86,2010-02-25T07:56Z,"It uses SecuRom protection. I'm looking for a way to get by that. Maybe a different, working no-dvd fix if i can find one. Soon as I find one I will post the link. Sorry about the trouble. I just want ppl to enjoy this great game. I'm doing my best to help."
,Matrix271,2010-02-25T09:04Z,np... i appreciate. Keep me posted! :-)
,RandHat,2010-02-25T15:54Z,"""RandHat just go into add and remove programs in ur windows control panel and u should be able to remove the game""


The control panel remove program method is basically useless, all it does is search for the available uninstaller that comes with game then use it. I've already tried that. "
,RandHat,2010-02-25T15:56Z,"SLeePYG86

I appreciate that you are trying to upload a great game so other people can play it.
It's just that I get really pissed when I can't remove something that doesn't work from my computer."
,SLeePYG86,2010-02-26T04:05Z,"Randhat

It's in my uninstall list in control panel (Program Features) as DEVIL MAY CRY 4   (It's all cap's). But since yours doesn't have it, then I'd suggest a free prgoram that has a smart uninstaller. I personally use Glary Utilities' uninstall module. Works great every time."
,SLeePYG86,2010-07-05T02:38Z,"Thanks to all that have kept seeding, as my DVD drive has taken a shit and won't read DVD's anymore; only regular CD's. So I'm having to re-download my own torrent to play my own game. Pitiful..... Thanx again!"
,Girlsmaycry,2011-01-12T17:02Z,same here got a black no means screen...after following the same steps as stated anyway thanks for the torrent man..
,Lordisa,2011-01-15T17:15Z,how much time will be in my comp 5 hours one day can someone tell me i have i fast computer and i  average internet
,mariusc80,2011-01-22T17:18Z,"The no-DVD fix is wrong ... you need the one for version 1.0.0.0

I used the one here (http://m0002.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_devil_may_cry_4.shtml#Devil%20May%20Cry%204%20v1.0%20[MULTI6]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20EXE). On XP."
,Tecma,2011-02-21T23:36Z,"Can you help me?? This is my problem:
Everything is correct when I install the game and when I move the NO-DVD files. The problem is when I open it, it don't enter inside the game. Just still FULL BLACK SCREEN. I have WINDOWS 7 and my computer has VIDEO CARD, 8 Gb ram and INTEL INSIDE. What should I do??? "
,EpicMusic,2011-11-16T21:06Z,"For some reason, when I start it's pitch black. Is it because of my Graphics Card? (Ati Radeon 3000 series)"
,EpicMusic,2011-11-16T21:32Z,"Never mind, I found the issue. The ""No-DvD Fix"" Cracks aren't working. Here's the new ones.

http://m0002.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_devil_may_cry_4.shtml#Devil%20May%20Cry%204%20v1.0%20[MULTI6]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20EXE

If it sends you down the page and look for title that says ""Devil May Cry 4 v1.0 [MULTI6] No-DVD/Fixed EXE"" Next to it you'll see ""Reloaded""

Once you find it, download it (then they will be an ad., Skip it, then you'll find the mirrors where you may download it.) 

Open it with Winrar and copy and paste on your Devilmaycry4 folder."

,BananaThePeeler,2012-04-17T09:24Z,"Hey, I downloaded the game and got everything to work but I think something is wrong with it. I'm on Chapter Nine and defeated the bosses and I haven't gotten any weapons, all I have is the Yamato. It didn't show the cut scenes to where you get the weapons too. I don't know what's going on or if it's suppose to be like this. Someone please give me and answer if you can, thank you :D "
,creationkit,2012-06-30T18:52Z,"Hi SLeePYG86, thanks for this epic game! I own it myself. It is the MULTI9 version (v1.1.0.0) tough. The ISO of this torrent seems to be a CLONEDVD, am I right? I wanted to ask because my DVD is labeled “DMC4” as this ISO is labeled “Devil May Cry 4”. Here comes my question: Considering the different labels is your game dvd showing the name “Devil May Cry 4” when you put it into the drive? Greez from Italy ;-)"
