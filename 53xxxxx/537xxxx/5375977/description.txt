Play imported games on any Wii, get rid of those regionlocks.

If you want to make your Wii capable of playing both NTSC and PAL region games, use Wii Freeloader.

Steps:
1.) Download torrent.
2.) Burn .iso file to DVD with IMGBurn or other burning software.
3.) Open Disc Channel on your Wii and put the FreeLoader DVD in, the screen should    show some weird lines 2 times. Exit Disc Channel and eject the DVD. Restart your Wii.
