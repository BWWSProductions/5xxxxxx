,rlmovies,2010-03-07T05:04Z,Hey guys new to this could you tell me what you mean when you say seed how do I do that
,m9o,2010-03-07T13:09Z,"@ shlek: try VLC player. it has all the codecs built in already

@ rlmovies: you become a seed when you've finished the download and let the torrent still run, so others can download from you. it is recommended that you share (at least) until you get a ratio=1."
,BrokenEmpires,2010-03-14T10:41Z,"If any of you have problems watching HD mp4 or mkv files such as this one. 
And you already tried VLC media player then:
Download and install K-Lite Codec pack (Mega)
http://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_mega.htm
It includes media player classic which is very light on cpu power.
If you have Win 7 make sure you enable the DivX H.264 decoder.
After install under tools folder open Win7DSFilterTweaker.
Change decoders from 'microsoft' default option.
That's the key to playing back HD videos. 
Thanks for seeding."
,BrokenEmpires,2010-03-15T10:07Z,"er for your broke ass to burn this file onto a 
DVD you need hella shit. But since I'm part of the timeconservationunion I'll start and finish off with the software.

Install, select file to burn, insert DVD, burn. 
Pop inside DVD player, press play, run Hollywood out of business."
,nrh363,2010-03-18T01:37Z,"File is corrupted for me, maybe it jsut messed on the D/L can't open with handbrake, can't convert file, wont play on ps3, only plays on VLC and it stutters even when I'm playing directly from my computer."
,kebakent,2010-03-19T00:05Z,"The quality of the movie is great, but the movie itself, sucks.

After wasting two hours of my life watching this, I had no idea what the movie was about. After googling for 10 mins I found my answer, and it turns out there is no underlying plot behind the metaphors worth analyzing. There is nothing to gain from watching this, unless you like getting two hours older, and 30 IQ points dumber.

Just my opinion -> Don't watch this."

,bv_abhi,2010-06-05T10:14Z,what a fucking crap movie although the uploader is nice
,856yt76,2011-05-04T22:51Z,"to you fucking idots bashing the movie calling it crap. this movie is based on a old children's book with over 20 years, so no its not a new movie, so no its not going to kick ass like transformers 3."
,grondork,2011-10-09T05:41Z,"@kebakent the movie is based on a children's book, which has 9 sentences. You should always look into the movies that you are going to watch. I, for one, loved it"
