Lots of great economic discussion today, global and domestic.  One quote:

"I'm sure that sitting in the middle of the capital city that is built by our tax dollars, Barack Obama may feel that the economy is doing o.k. because, hey, all his friends are doing just fine... but Kansas City is looking at having to close and possibly sell HALF of its schools to deal with the financial shortfall from the loss in tax revenue."
Some places in New England have REAL unemployment is 30 percent, worse than the worst of the Great Depression.  
Study after study after study have shown that the Stimulus did not create new jobs.  It moved a lot of jobs around and it pumped a whole lot of money into various cronies and pork barrels.
The latest poll shows that only 6 percent of the people believe that the Stimulus created jobs.
A rising tide of suburban homelessness across the US.  Middle class families becoming homeless; we are seeing the end of private home ownership in America.
Banks are able to make more money by forcing you into foreclosure than by working with you to keep you in your home.
Banks getting back into derivatives and credit default swaps.  
Banks are growing richer of the misery of the American people.  
Banks are not there to help you, they are the tools of your enslavement and impoverishment, and it's happening right before your very eyes.
So Obama can get up and say things are going great, but they are not.  We are at the beginning of a war between Wall Street and Main Street, and right now Main Street is losing.
Former Treasury Sec. Paulson says if the wealth was not at the top there would be nothing to "trickle down."
Don't know about you, but I am tired of being trickled on by Wall Street!  They're trickling on us and calling it rain.



...there's much more.

 

Familiar themes: US government warmongering, deceit and theft; the steady path to an ever more oppressive police state; wars and threats of wars being used to placate Israel and distract US citizens from economic disaster and the ticking debt timebomb



Mike manages to present powerful, persuasive stuff without screaming and yelling.
Please give his show a listen.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.

================================================================

Mike Rivero launched What Really Happened [initially called Rancho Runamukka] as a subpage on his business web site in 1993 asking pointed questions about the death of White House Deputy Council Vincent Foster.
As more and more investigations revealed more government deceptions, the project grew in size and eventually moved to its own domain [whatreallyhappened.com] where it resides today.
His WRH website is among the top ten ranked daily political news sites on the Internet, with a global readership in the millions.  What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.
Rivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening.
