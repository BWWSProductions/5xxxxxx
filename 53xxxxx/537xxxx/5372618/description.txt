A personal aide to U.S. Ambassador in France, James Reece (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) has an enviable life in Paris and a beautiful French girlfriend, but his real passion is his side job as a low-level operative for the CIA. All James wants is to become a bona fide agent and see some real action. So when heâ€™s offered his first senior-level assignment, he canâ€™t believe his good luck until he meets his new partner, special agent Charlie Wax (John Travolta) â€“ a trigger-happy, wisecracking, loose cannon whoâ€™s been sent to Paris to stop a terrorist attack. Wax leads James on a white-knuckle shooting spree through the Parisian underworld that has James praying for his desk job. But when James discovers heâ€™s a target of the same crime ring theyâ€™re trying to bust, he realizes thereâ€™s no turning backâ€¦and that Wax himself might be his only hope for making it through the next forty-eight hours alive.
