If you were asked "What is the Church?" what would be your response? Is it the protestant buildings on nearly every street corner in every town in America? Is it the Holy Catholic Church and her massive hierarchy? What ever happened to the biblical examples of the Church? Why are there more Pastors leaving the profession than are entering it? Why do so many Christians attend church weekly but are still left with uncertainty? This little book attempts to answer these questions about the Church.
