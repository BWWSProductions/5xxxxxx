In New Orleans, the abusive narcotic detective Anthony Stowe is a dirty

 cop, addicted in heroin and booze, hated by his colleagues and divorcing

 from his wife Valerie. While trying to arrest his former partner and drug

 lord Gabriel Callaghan, the mission fails, two undercover officers are
 
killed and the drug, the money and the monitoring tapes vanish. Later,

 Tony is shot by a criminal in the head and miraculously does not die.

 After months in coma, he wakes up trying to fix the errors of his past life.
