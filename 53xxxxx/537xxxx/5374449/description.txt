In the beginning of the 80's, Tommi Stumpff was the singer of the DÃ¼sseldorf-based punk band Der KFC, one of the most hated punkbands around. Born in Belgium, he got in contact with Belgian industrial and proto-EBM soon and started a solo-career in this field after Der KFC went defunct. He was ahead of his time with this sound and due to lacking success dropped being an active musician. Nowadays he is a businessman.
