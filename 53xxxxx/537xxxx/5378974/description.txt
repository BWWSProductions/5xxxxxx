Eric Clapton & Jeff Beck â€“ Two Blue Birds Fly
Live at Saitama, Japanâ€™s Super Arena,  February 21, 2009

Guitar Legends Eric Clapton & Jeff Beck shared the stage on the first of two shows at Saitama, Japanâ€™s Super Arena, on February 21st 2009. This concert marked the first time the pair have ever shared the bill for a major arena show. 

Both guitarists have roots in the Yardbirds, a blues-tinged British band that also lists Led Zeppelinâ€™s Jimmy Page among its famous alumni. After the Yardbirdsâ€™ hit â€œFor Your Love,â€ Clapton exited the band in 1965 out of protest of the groupâ€™s move from the blues to a new pop sound. Claptonâ€™s replacement, ironically enough, was Jeff Beck. 

Of course, Clapton and Beck went on to have pretty huge post-Yardbirds careers as well: Clapton as a member of Cream, Blind Faith, Derek & The Dominoes and a successful solo career, while Beck fronted the Jeff Beck Group and also enjoyed a noteworthy solo run. And now, more than 40 years after the original Yardbirds disbanded, the two were finally together on stage in Japan.

The show consisted of 3 parts: Jeff Beck played first, then Eric played his set and finally Jeff Beck joined Eric. The show lasted about 2.5 hours - both Jeff and Eric played for about 1 hour then they played together for about 30 minutes.
