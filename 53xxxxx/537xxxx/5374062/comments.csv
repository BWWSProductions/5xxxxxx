,classy35,2010-02-19T05:26Z,I downloaded a trial that expired.  When I download this cracked version the expired trial is still in effect.  Any help is appreciated.
,classy35,2010-02-19T05:36Z,Also the trial is usable if I backdate my computer but that's kind of annoying to do every time.

,cezzione,2010-02-19T12:12Z,"found the culprit!
when i select system audio off (most right button of recording options after choosing start recording) the app quits, after deselecting it: no prob!"
,xLxSxProduCtionz,2010-07-12T04:15Z,"Yeah, Trial Expired.  Just like my cracks i\'ve had for it.  We need serials for it to work correctly! I\'ll be working on that! =/"
,remicornelissen,2011-07-12T17:28Z,"The software is working fine, but I do have one problem. Like... Today... From the 43 minutes which I record, Camtasia makes a video of only the first 9 minutes and 32 seconds! So not the whole recording!
In the complete 43 minutes which I want to record, my laptop is getting filled with megabites (so until I press the 'stop recording' button), so you would expect that Camtasia makes a video of the complete 43 minutes, but sadly this is not what happened.
Does anyone know how to fix this? Any help would be appreciated, thank you."
