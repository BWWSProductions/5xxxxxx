PLOT
It's the 21st century, but the gods of Mount Olympus and assorted monsters have walked out of the pages of high school student Percy Jackson's Greek mythology texts and into his life. And they're not happy: Zeus' lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect. Even more troubling is the sudden disappearance of Percy's mother. As Percy finds himself caught between angry and battling gods, he and his friends embark on a cross-country adventure to catch the true lightning thief, save Percy's mom, and unravel a mystery more powerful than the gods themselves.

PrisM Notes::::::::::::
real nice cam for a movie been out a short while, probably the best cam we will get of this movie. Had to join a german forum to find the cinejunkiez release that took me a while to sign up :lol:, anyway......

video is sweet not much to really changed lowered the red a little and increased brightness without giving it more whitespots, added slight green into it to make it look a little more natural, used rx's audio thanks!, overall really nice telesync, id only just finish encoding the russian video then this one comes out also left the res same as source, rx release has slightly bad ar
