,user2101,2010-02-22T14:16Z,"Nice Upload, all 100% working, most of them in NTSC. I say: please Big Dude, can you upload the following games?:
- Silent Hill Origins
- Resident Evil 4, Outbreak 1&2
- Enter the Matrix
- Syphon Filter Dark Mirror
- Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary, Underworld

I think you have uploaded other games except for them, it would complete the sagas.

Thanks a lot, and I wish you could upload at least some of them.

Greetings"
