This is Windows 7 Ultimate Edition with no changes made to it ready to go. When initializing you'll see a blue background and it'll seem nothings happening this is normal just wait, and make sure to burn @ 4x speed. It's exactly 3 GB from my reading this is one of the signs that it hasn't been altered. It's from Demonoid.
This works well with 7Loader mine works fine. I have had to reload 7Loader because it said not genuine but it went away as soon as I reloaded.
