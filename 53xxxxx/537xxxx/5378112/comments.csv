,dcoleman,2010-02-24T20:59Z,"raymondhome, your upload says DVDrip and sbtmin says its not. Can you confirm and if not why put DVDrip?
Thanks"
,Useless17,2010-03-05T06:43Z,"The Jaybob release is much better quality, but there are no English Subtitles for it yet, (which are important to certain parts of the story, but not impossible to watch without) but this one does have available subs @ http://www.sub-titles.net/ppodnapisi/podnapis/i/692353/the-boondock-saints-ii-all-saints-day-2009-subtitles, thanx to raymondhome keep up it up, and keep the files clean, PEACE"
,Useless17,2010-03-05T06:54Z,"The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day {2009} DVDRIP. Jaybob ... This version is a real DVDrip perfect quality, smaller file size, but has no subs released yet, Everyone PLZ remember to SEED and share the LOVE (TPB will not let me post a link to another torrent site in their comments, so just copy and paste the title to google and you should find it on another share site)"
