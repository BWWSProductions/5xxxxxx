Bigger, Stronger, Faster (2008)

America defines itself in the superlative: it is the biggest, strongest, fastest country in the world. It rewards speed, size and above all else: winning - at sport, at business and at war. Metaphorically it is are a nation on steroids. Is it any wonder that so many of it's heroes are on performance enhancing drugs?

The documentary examines the steroid use of the director Christopher Bell and his two brothers, Mark and Mike Bell,who all grew up idolizing Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hulk Hogan, and Sylvester Stallone, and also features professional athletes, medical experts, fitness center members, and US Congressmen talking about the issue of anabolic steroids.

Beyond the basic issue of anabolic steroid use, Bigger, Stronger, Faster* examines the lack of consistency in how America views drugs, cheating, and the lengths people go to achieve success. The film looks beyond the steroid issue to such topics as Tiger Woods' laser eye correction to 20/15 vision, professional musicians use of anxiety reducing drugs, or athletes' dependence on cortisone shots, which are a legal steroid. It takes a skeptical view of the health risks of steroids and is critical of the legal health supplement industry.
