Canadian guitar virtuoso captured live on stage at the Metropolis.
Jesse Cook is a Toronto-based Nuevo Flamenco guitarist, born in Paris to Canadian parents. Like other guitarists of his style of music, he incorporates jazz, Latin & world music into his playing. Cook is also well known for the energy of his live shows.
Award winner with over 500,000 CDs sold in Canada. Juno and Gemini Award
winner including 4 Gold records and 1 Platinum.

Seeing Jesse and the super musicians he performs with is a must for any fan.
I highly recommend this to anyone who likes acoustic guitar, Flamenco, Rumba,
Middle Eastern twists or plain good music. (do you get a feeling I like his work?)
