Janis Joplin - Blow All My Blues Away, 9 CD Box Set
various dates, 1962 through 1970
FLAC img + CUE


This set of archival recordings lets us witness the formation of arguably the most powerful and expressive voice in rock history. From the earliest known performances in the small bars of Texas to the first sessions with Big Brother to her mesmerizing live shows, Janis never left behind her raw roots. She drew upon them to impel emotional performances as if by exposing her pain she gained power over her past and transformed it into a gift. In these newly sourced pearls, we can hear as never before the birth and fast burning flame of Janis Joplin.

Included are outtakes and unreleased songs from the 1968 "Cheap Thrills" studio sessions, demos for the 1969 Kozmic Blues album and vast improvements on all existing vintage (1962-65) live recordings. The vintage recordings, in particular, are wonderful and although we
had some of this material from the long out of print "Janis" movie
soundtrack vinyl release, this collection has 39 (!) tracks recorded
between 1962-65 including the ubiquitous "Typewriter Tapes" made by Jorma. The final CD finally unchains the urgent expression and lets it be heard in a complete Big Brother concert from 1967. Sit down by your window, put this set on, and blow all your blues away.
