[V],ill88eagle,2010-02-19T22:27Z,"There's a problem with the .cue file to disc 2 - To fix go here: 

http://pastebay.com/86758 

Copy the lot from the lower text field (the one without linenumbers), paste it into your favorite txt editor and save it as CD2.cue

Just dont overwrite the old .cue file as it will f*ck up the seeding. 

Sorry bout the f*ckup and thanx"
,peterthepiratebay,2010-02-21T11:21Z,"Thanks for the fix, it's working now.

This set is totally awesome."
,ishis,2010-02-24T02:39Z,"I have listened to 'Cheap Thrills'by 'Big Brother and the Holding Company' so often that I acutally believe that I was there!!!

Hearing just the first two discs of this 9 CD Box Set is a 'revelation'...solid evidence of what a true natural talent Janis was...and furthur deepens the sadness of what a loss for all of us that her life here was so brief.

Long live Janis!"
