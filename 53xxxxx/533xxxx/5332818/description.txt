This is a collection of all the songs that were released on singles, but are not included in any album.
If you are a prodigy fan with only the albums then it is practically a sin not to get this.

There are 29 songs and some of the prodigy's best work is included in this collection.

The bitrate varies with songs.

*seed for as long as you can
**No man army (feat Tom Morello) is possibly the prodigy's best song (in my opinion)
***This is not a commercial album, I called it outtakes because it's the best description I could think of.
****Buy the prodigy's albums or go to see them live (it's worth it)

PEACE MoFo's
