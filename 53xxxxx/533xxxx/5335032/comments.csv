[T],kriss_kringle,2010-02-04T14:04Z,Can someone tell me if it works on PS3? I encoded it with the PS3 profile so it should work but I won't know until someone tells me that it does.
,moviemasti,2010-02-04T15:57Z,"Thanks GOPO. I request all you, who are downloading the movie to give it +1 rating. And spread the GOPO movie mania. He's is the best ripper of best movies. I appreciate your work GOPO. Thanks again."
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-02-04T19:36Z,Thank you HolyRoses for the info.As far as renting a ps3 for a couple of days it would be a good idea but I don't think there's a place to rent in my city but I will look into it.It's the best way to really know if the movies play on it or not.
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-02-04T22:42Z,I live in Romania.That's why I said I don't know if there is a renting place for consoles.I never heard anyone talk about it and I know for sure that we don't have Blockbuster :))

,dezertx,2010-02-05T14:08Z,Any chance for Lethal Weapon Pack?
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-02-05T15:48Z,Slim chances for lethal weapon.
,bigturd,2010-02-08T12:31Z,"This does NOT play on a PS3.  It says ""Unsupported Data"" when you try to play it off a data disc.  Just letting you know."
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-02-08T15:08Z,Thanks for the info.
,123no123,2010-03-02T13:47Z,"This movie is not OK, The sound is out of sync. I think the begin part of the movie is missing."
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-03-08T22:51Z,The movie is ok.You on the other hand aren't.It's out of sync because maybe you don't have a good codec pack or you're using a washed up player.And there's no beginning missing either.Check out the runtime on imdb it's the same with my release.
,123no123,2010-03-08T23:33Z,"Hi kriss_kringle, All your movies playing fine on my pc, but only this one gives problems. I have already this movie on my pc, but it is 8 gig, and that is a lot of space. Your movies are smaller. In the movie that i already have, i see in the begin Patton is comming up the stairs, and in your movie i didn't see that. I think the runtime is the duration of the audio.  

By the way, thanks for sharing all your movies. The Quality is very good.

sorry for my English."
,bulldho,2010-04-22T20:34Z,"thanks.
next wizard of oz."
,penguinchris,2010-05-08T16:15Z,"Good quality, but, the English subtitles for German dialog are missing. Some important stuff in there... yes, you're supposed to understand what they're saying.

You can get some that work (same blu-ray source) here: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3564187/patton-en. It's the third file in that download (""Forced"")."
