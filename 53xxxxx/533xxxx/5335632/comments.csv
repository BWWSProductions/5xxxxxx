,Cyali,2010-03-02T23:07Z,"@cmr616 - Are you joking? Do you know how much the artist actually makes off of an album sale? Most of the time they're lucky if they get 10%. If you really want to support an artist you like, you buy tickets to their shows or buy merchandise. Downloading an album rather than buying it doesn't affect the artists so much as it does the record companies. The artists see slight loss in revenue from records...but big jumps in sale of merch and tickets as more people hear their music.

As for the torrent, excellent quality. Thanks for uploading ^_^ Downloaded extremely fast and sounds great!"
