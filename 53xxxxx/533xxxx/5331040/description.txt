Allmusic Review:
Crystal Waters' most recent release demonstrates the flexibility and insights that characterized her surprising hit debut. Her tone and voice are light and supple, and she seldom sounds intense or animated during a song, even on a number where the lyrics would seem to require a more heated approach. But she can stun, alert and inform with her range and subject matter. "Storyteller" and "Daddy Do" aren't frilly numbers; the former describes a relationship gone sour in literate, emotionally compelling terms, while the latter is a hard-hitting attack on wife abuse. Waters scores lots of points through delivery and inflection, and her CD is much more than a dance/disco diva's outpourings.
