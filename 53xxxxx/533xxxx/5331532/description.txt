There are so many reasons why this is S06E01-E02 and not two seperate episodes.
Let's run them down for you.

1 - No End Credits after the first hour and second hour started at 10:05 (what
show starts at 10:05)

2 - Episode titles LA X Part 1 and Part 2 (last season which was two 2 seperate
episodes had two titles, Because You Left (501) and The Lie (502)

3 - No previously on or opening logo, or even on-screen credits for the actors.
Two seperate episodes would have that. 

4 - If it were two episodes, it would be split more evenly, runtime wise, not
44min and 39min. Lost has never had an episode under 40min.

So while we appreciate people rushing to release half a show, all it does is
cause people to waste their bandwidth downloading the same thing 1.5 times and 
delays the release of the second part thus making people even more angry.
