,ryumha,2010-02-04T03:29Z,how stupid it is to RAR a file that cannot be compressed any more...
,velion,2010-02-04T14:58Z,"Latest Lost episodes Original RARs

So these are the original files.."
,-WhySoSerious-,2010-02-04T18:32Z,Hey! Why cant I use MKV2VOB with these series? It works better when im streaming to my tv?
,-WhySoSerious-,2010-02-04T18:38Z,"Ooops.. I get it now :) My external harddisk, where the directory output is was not on.. Doh!"
,ryumha,2010-02-05T00:33Z,"velion, I know  you didn't RAR'ed these files, but still... dumb of them to do this (the group that ripped)"
,tarball8,2010-02-10T05:08Z,Ug.  STOP with the RAR files already.  They are worse than pointless.
,tarball8,2010-02-10T05:12Z,"""So while we appreciate people rushing to release half a show, all it does is
cause people to waste their bandwidth downloading the same thing 1.5 times and 
delays the release of the second part thus making people even more angry.""

I already downloaded and saw E01.  Now all I can find is the double episode torrents like this that are RARed, so I **HAVE TO** down load both episodes just to watch E02.  

Unbelievably stupid.  If it wasn't rared, I could just download E02, but NOOOOO.  Some smart ass thinks he's doing people a favor by RARing 2 episodes together.

Sorry about the rant, but I just can belive people are still doing this."
,velion,2010-02-10T14:46Z,"Thats how i got the episode, RARed and 2 in 1, so it's not my fault!
Search for episode 2 and you'll find it.
It was uploaded 7 days ago!

Good luck!"
,Tokgalningen,2010-02-14T23:23Z,"Well, geee, thanks... ""The archived file is corrupted."" Great."
