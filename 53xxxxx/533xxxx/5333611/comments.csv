,Skorgeous,2011-04-08T02:43Z,"I'v downloaded the game, mounted the image. Then went through the installation, where the commentator is talking the whole time, but when i click the shortcut on the desktop to start the game, it says to insert the cd-rom, click ok and install. When i go to the crack folder, and double click the application, with the ball icon, it goes to start, screen goes black, but the the programme crashes. Any idea what i can do, or if i have installed it correctly? Cheers Bru"
