Is this Not a Standalone Application or a Plugin?
thank you"
,stopimalreadydead,2010-02-19T12:48Z,It's a plug-in. I believe this one is only for After Effects.
,adge666,2010-02-20T23:51Z,"Looks good to me. I used the Instant HD folder and installed for host FCP. I used the Ser from SerBox and it installed fine. Instant HD, DeInterlacer and Resizer are now showing in the effects folder. Thanks - exactly what I was looking for. Macbook dual core 2GHz - Final Cut Express - this is a plugin not an application."
,rbroyal,2010-02-27T23:00Z,"Hey friends ,The serial for Instant HD for FCP is:8484-8034-1000-5275-1941
