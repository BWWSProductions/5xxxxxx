,synthminx,2010-04-15T23:21Z,"You chaps have got further than me, I can't even open the .mdf file. Tried isobuster, but it says that some of the files are corrupt. It could be the download transfer though."
,nickthenack9,2010-11-17T11:11Z,"@gkidcj
you have to mount the files in ""R C Cars.7z"" on to a virtual disk drive (i used powerISO) or burn them to a CD.

It has 2 CD checks, 1 for copyright and 1 for files the game requires to play (for some retarded reason).

@synthminx
Some thing must have gone wrong when you downloaded because mine worked, try powerISO or downloading again."
