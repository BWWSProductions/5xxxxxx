Try to find season 2 of Murphy, I've been searching high and low for it for ages and I can't seem to find it. I'm especially in need of ep's 203,205,206,218,221... (Have the rest on old vhs-tapes, if I could I'd upload them myself but I haven't the know-how..)
If you could, try getting episod 508 too - the one here on PB is only 164 MB, it should be around 235 MB
PLEASE, PLEASE... ANYONE - HELP!!! "
