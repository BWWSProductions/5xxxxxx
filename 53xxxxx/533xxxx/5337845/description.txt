The Beyond (a.k.a l'Aldila, 7 Doors Of Death)

Directed by the Godfather of Gore Lucio Fulci, and one of his best movies imo.

Behind this doorway lie the terrifying and unspeakable secrets of hell. No one who sees it lives to describe it. And you shall live in darkness for all eternity.
The seven dreaded gateways to hell are concealed in seven cursed places... And from the day the gates of hell are opened, the dead will walk the earth.
