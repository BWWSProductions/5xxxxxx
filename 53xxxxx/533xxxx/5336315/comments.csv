,brg2,2010-02-06T23:32Z,"captim, why are you splitting these up and giving them track names when all of us have to go back and rename them. kind of a waste of time, no?"
[T],captim,2010-02-08T12:25Z,"@brg2: The official tracklist is released generally one day after broadcasting the episode. Most of you don't want to wait until this happens and hence I take split and upload right after the broadcast of the curretn episode. Sometimes there are some ID left, that's not my fault. My intention is to deliver the episode split up as fast as possible, so this is the compromise..."
