"Mr. Vain" by Culture Beat
and
"Rhythm is a Dancer" by Snap!

A proof that some eurodance tracks do sound terribly much alike! I was surprised to hear how well these songs blend together. One played in the left channel, one in the right. (Hint: listen using a pair of headphones!)

Small adjustments have been made to match tempo and key, and ~30 seconds have been cut out at the end of "Rhythm is a Dancer". Otherwise untouched.

The idea was conceived when I played these two tracks at a party, soon after each other, and somebody pointed out that I played the same track twice within a short time (not even realising they were two different tracks).

Enjoy - and please comment!
