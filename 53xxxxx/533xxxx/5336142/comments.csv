Like bitrate, file format (FLAC, MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis), perhaps even year of release ;)

I especially miss the first one, as you can check the file format by clicking the ammount of files, but still ;)"

Also some people (like me) are Audiophiles, and want to know which torrent has the highest bit rate or even if it is uncompressed."
