,Cleeoupatra,2010-02-27T12:47Z,"When I download this it shows six files, but none of them is any exact videos. I use Miro to download the files. Could this have any to do with the problem?"
,vCJv,2010-03-03T14:25Z,"^^^ Did you guys not read the description?

It states you'll need a player to play the ""VIDEO_TS"" files."
,ErlenmeyerFlask,2010-04-05T01:34Z,"Hey t0rg31r,

I know what you mean about the quality. 

I downloaded seasons 1-5 from ""Anonymous"" (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5228219/Lost_Season_1-5_DVDRIP) and the quality exceeded my standards. The quality of deathmules season 6  ep 1&2 episodes seemed substandard in comparison. I thought maybe I was spoiled or that I there was something wrong with my player. I also use VLC (which may or may not have something to do with it), and don't have room to use one of the recommended players by deathmule.

I did however download another set of the season 6 episodes by user2602 (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5393152/Lost_S06_E01-E04) and the quality seemed a lot better on my VLC player.

Hope this helps people using the VLC player.

Cheers."
