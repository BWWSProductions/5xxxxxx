,julaiohawaiano,2010-02-06T01:53Z,hey could you upload the full bundle by any chance? thanks!
,ttt007xs,2010-02-06T03:33Z,Love it...U ROCK MATE
,db0707,2010-02-06T07:08Z,i need the cracked windows version.  anyone know where i can get it?
,dankspot,2010-02-06T09:48Z,SEEEEEED PLEASE!!!!
,ttt007xs,2010-02-06T23:57Z,i want a windows cracked version
,quizoo,2010-02-07T08:00Z,does it work for windows since it is still the AE codebase??
,rcookyboy93,2010-02-07T12:02Z,it works on either OS. Windows/Mac its all the same file.
,trtbz,2010-02-07T23:30Z,"Please, tell us how to do this in Win, because it's not working for me"
,sjogreno,2010-02-09T21:50Z,"Works like a charm, all you need to do is move the entire Optical Flares (not the on inside the _MACOSX folder) into the Plug-ins folder in AE. 

So go fuck yourself aquila92."
,sandy40d,2010-02-10T15:21Z,awesom
,cyberfrog77,2010-02-10T23:08Z,does not work for windows.  .aex file is missing and plugin is not showing in after effects
,iArchonius,2010-02-11T16:01Z,"plugin is not showing in after effects, moved entire Optical Flares Folder but no luck hope someone knows how to fix this anyways great torrent thanks."
,TheDestiny,2010-02-12T11:45Z,"@cyberfrog77 & iArchonius
There's 2 upload of Optical Flares on here (TPB). Search for Optical Flares.
In the other folder the .aex (plugin file) exist.
Badly i've tried to combinate these 2 folders etc, but i don't get it working too.. I get the plugin showing in After Effects, but its just noise around, because i've no correct key."
,jesusthesecond,2010-02-12T17:28Z,"Plugin shows up in AE but the crack doesn't work.  There is a .lic file in the folder but I still get the 'no license file found' message that asks me to register online.  I can't use the presets, the options box is not accessible because this isn't a proper crack.  It might work on some computers, because the license key is generated from the system profile, thus if the system is similar the key will work.  The key does not work on all systems."
,cyberjohn0524,2010-02-13T03:39Z,yeah... it isnt working for me too. i installed the apps but it isnt working. it is looking for hareware fingerprint. where could i look for that?
,sonofsmallface,2010-02-13T23:52Z,"Aw man, thank you, thank you, thank you for this.
If I ever actually get a job doing this kind of stuff I'll buy this..."
,sonofsmallface,2010-02-14T10:50Z,"Just been watching the videos on how to use this and wanted to come back and say a few more thank yous.
out of curiousity, this file is 65 meg but the purchase download from the site itself is 400 meg, what is it that they include which isn't here?  I'm guessing it's the tutorials?"
,CrisisIsHere,2010-02-14T16:44Z,"This thing actually works. Just do what @sjogreno
said, it really works. I have a iMac 20 inch I believe running Snow Leopard with the latest updates. And believe me, it works :)"
,brunomsilva82,2010-02-15T17:35Z,"will try, and post my comment about it!

thanks mate for this major upload...

peace"
,h2freeek,2010-02-22T07:23Z,"Is there any way you can send me the Hardware Fingerprint that the original .lic file was created on, I'm working on a crack but I need something to compare."
,bumpydoughnut,2010-02-23T01:41Z,pretty much what h2freeek is saying is that...Is there any way you can send me the Hardware Fingerprint that the original .lic file was created on so i can type it in and use the plug-in for myself.
,h2freeek,2010-02-24T02:16Z,"@bumpydoughnut, you seem to be misunderstanding the Hardware Fingerprint.  There's nowhere you type it in, it's unique to your machine.  I need it so I can compare the .lic file with that hardware fingerprint and see if I can make a comparison and, using that, create a keygenerator.  Copyfukit, can you provide this?"
,h2freeek,2010-03-07T01:34Z,"CopyFuKit, you need to read your comments!  Can I have the Hardware Fingerprint that this crack was created on so I can try to reverse engineer them via comparison and write a keygen!"
,ofuhunter,2010-03-08T21:47Z,"ok lads after hours and hours lookin < I finally found the optical flares cracked for windows and not only that it comes with tutorials , link is
http://www.downarchive.com/software/macosx/100817-video-copilot-optical-flares-after-effects-plugin.html
enjoy :)"
,h2freeek,2010-03-09T07:02Z,"The links say Mac, but you say Windows.  Which is it?

Honestly, if I can get the hardware fingerprint that the license file included in this download uses then I should be able to reverse engineer it and find out how it works to write a keygen."
,CopyFuKit,2010-03-09T14:09Z,"@h2freeek sry man its been a while, unfortunately I couldn't provide that file, I heard that the crack is going to be released soon, any news on OF i'll upload it 4sure."
,frameaddict,2010-03-17T16:35Z,"It works perfectly.
Just drag the Optical Flares folder to the plugins folder.
Oddly not the one that says __MACOSX. The other.
No Serial Number is required whatsoever.
Thank you so much to the uploader."
,sxyblkgl,2010-03-17T23:47Z,"Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thaaaaanks soooo much. Just read sjogreno comment exactly, and this works flawlessly."
,ShadowRunner1913,2010-03-20T02:33Z,"hmmm, the torrent path seems broken?  BitTorrent errors it out."
,c-low,2010-04-22T14:29Z,Thank You
,shitballz,2010-05-15T01:55Z,"Whenever I try to apply it, it says:

,projectJINX,2010-05-20T01:19Z,Works a charm! Presets to Presets and Optical Flares to Plugins. Thanks for sharing! 
,tembonics,2010-05-23T17:46Z,"Hey can you get a crack for the 2.1 update for CS5 for mac, if you could I would be really appreciative thanks"
,tembonics,2010-05-23T17:48Z,sorry I mean 1.2 update
,R1winter,2010-07-16T14:54Z,"Just wondering; is this compatible with all versions? I have CS5...nalso, I\'m looking for the trapcode pluggins, any one know where I could find them?"
,justindustries,2010-07-24T14:44Z,"When I go to Options of the plug-in my after effects crashes.. Running snow leopard on macbook pro.
Any suggestions ?"
,justindustries,2010-07-24T14:55Z,never mind it works :D !
,muttle1,2010-07-25T01:01Z,"@justinindustries

How did you get this to work? Can you tell me exact instructions? 

THANKS!"
,muttle1,2010-07-25T01:08Z,"Also, I'm running CS5. I get this error ""After Effects error: Invalid filter ( 24 :: 3 )"".

I put the optical flares into the plugin section of after effects. Not the mac_osx folder...

,RGBeffect,2011-04-28T00:26Z,"Does this work on a macbook pro with an i7 processor with Adobe CS5?  I can't seem to get it to work, and I tried instructions from every comment on here.  Keep getting error ((25::3))  Any help would be great.  

Also, does anyone know where I can get more Video Copilot plug-ins for a mac.  I would like to test these products before purchasing.  "
,RGBeffect,2011-04-28T00:51Z,"@crispfried

Thank you so much.  Your tutorial was a big help.  This is such a cool plug-in.  I would like some more VCopilot  plug-ins for a mac.  I would really like to try action 1 and 2 as well?  Know where I could find them?"
