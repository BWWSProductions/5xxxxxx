IMPORTANT NOTES- AV Scan results of Avira9_Trial_Reset_v2.2A.exe:
*****************************************************************

1- Norton Internet Security: Clean. 
2- avast! Pro Antivirus: Clean.
3- Kaspersky Antivirus: Clean. 
4- Avira identifies Avira9_Trial_Reset_v2.2A.exe as a threat (TR/Virtl.132):
   - Risk name: TR/Drop.MSIL.Agen.F 	
   - Risk type: Trojan
 

The av scan result of Avira is a false positive due to some used 
binaries and cryptors (or maybe it's added to Avira's virus database).
So just stay cool or don't use this!!!


Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!



<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
> Intimidated by the AV Scan results & scary names??? Then simply don't try this! <

Premium Security Suite
This module contains all components required for successful installation of Avira 
Premium Security Suite.

AntiVir Guard
The AntiVir Guard runs in the background. It monitors and repairs, where necessary,
files during operations such as open, write and copy in on-access mode. Whenever 
a user carries out a file operation (e.g. load document, execute, copy), Avira 
Premium Security Suite automatically scans the file. Renaming a file does not 
trigger a scan by AntiVir Guard. 

AntiVir MailGuard
MailGuard is the interface between your computer and the email server from which 
your email program (mail client) downloads the emails. MailGuard is connected as 
a so-called proxy between the email program and the email server. All incoming 
emails are routed through this proxy, scanned for viruses and unwanted programs 
and forwarded to your email program. Depending on the configuration, the program 
processes the affected emails automatically or asks the user for a certain action.
In addition, the MailGuard can reliably protect you against spam emails.

AntiVir WebGuard
When surfing the internet, you are using your web browser to request data from 
a web server. The data transferred from the web server (HTML files, script and 
image files, Flash files, video and music streams, etc) will normally be moved 
directly into the browser cache for display in the web browser, meaning that an 
on-access scan as performed by AntiVir Guard is not possible. This could allow 
viruses and unwanted programs to access your computer system. WebGuard is what 
is known as an HTTP proxy which monitors the ports used for data transfer 
(80, 8080, 3128) and scans the transferred data for viruses and unwanted programs.
Depending on the configuration, the program may process the affected files 
automatically or prompt the user for a specific action.

Avira Firewall
Avira Firewall controls communication to and from your computer. It permits or 
denies communications based on security policies.

Rootkit Detection
The Rootkit Detection checks whether software is already installed on your 
computer that can no longer be detected with conventional methods of malware 
protection after penetrating the computer system.

Shell Extension
The Avira Premium Security Suite Shell Extension generates an entry Scan selected 
files with AntiVir in the context menu of the Windows Explorer (right-hand mouse 
button). With this entry you can directly scan files or directories.

Backup
The Backup component lets you create mirror backups of your data manually and 
automatically.



Here are some key features of Avira Premium Security Suite 9:

- Control Center for monitoring, administering and controlling the entire program.
- Central configuration with user-friendly standard and advanced options and 
  context-sensitive help.
- Scanner (On-Demand Scan) with profile-controlled and configurable search for 
  all known types of virus and malware.
- Integration into the Windows Vista User Account Control allows you to carry out 
  tasks requiring administrator rights.
- Guard (On-Access Scan) for continuous monitoring of all file access attempts.
- MailGuard (POP3 scanner and SMTP scanner) for the permanent checking of emails 
  for viruses and malware. Checking of email attachments is included.
- WebGuard for monitoring data and files transferred from the Internet using the 
  HTTP protocol (monitoring of ports 80, 8080, 3128).
- Backup-component for creating backups of your data (mirror backups).
- Integrated quarantine management to isolate and process suspicious files.
- Rootkit protection for detecting hidden malware installed in your computer 
  system (rootkits) (Only for 32-bit systems).
- Direct access to detailed information on the detected viruses and malware via 
  the Internet.
- Simple and quick updates to the program, virus definitions, and search engine 
  through Single File Update and incremental VDF updates via a webserver on the 
  Internet.
- User-friendly licensing in License Manager.
- Integrated Scheduler to plan one-off or recurring tasks, such as updates or 
  test runs.
- Extremely high virus and malware detection via innovative scanning technology 
  (scan engine) including heuristic scanning method.
- Detection of all conventional archive types including detection of nested 
  archives and smart extension detection.
- High-performance multithreading function (simultaneous high-speed scanning of 
  multiple files).
- Firewall to protect your computer against illegal access from the Internet or 
  from a network, and against illegal access from the Internet/network by an 
  unauthorized user.



What's new in this release: 

- WebGuard to surf and download safely
- Virus check of every file and archive access
- Protection of active processes against undesired breakups
- Perfect for game tasks through the "Game mode"

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

Also scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware 
detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
