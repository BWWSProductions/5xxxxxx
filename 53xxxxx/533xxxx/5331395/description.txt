I do believe that win media player messed up the torrent file.

I opened the list in Win media player and I think it started to update the song titles,there fore the torrent cannot identify 3 of the songs.

Utorrent even tells me that I only have 99.7% completed.

So once you have 99.7 %,it is done,you must then DL my other torrent in order to complete the list.

there is nothing I can do about this,if you stop downing loading the three songs that wont finish,it should allow you to be recognized as a seeder.

This is why the torrent shows up as no seeders.
it may never.

I hope this makes sense.

================

I cleaned up the list and fixed a few songs.

The original songs were named:
001 - Led Zeppelin - Stairway To Heaven.mp3

I renamed them to:
Led Zeppelin - Stairway To Heaven 001 - .mp3

This way,they now are in order according to Artist,making them easier to locate.


also I added a few extras that didnt make the list but should have in my opinion.


also added a few videos you might find interesting,if you enjoy classic rock
