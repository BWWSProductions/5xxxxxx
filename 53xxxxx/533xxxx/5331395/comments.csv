,GypsyRoads,2010-02-04T02:47Z,"Im seeding it.

utorrent shows 15 ppl with 10%"
,SteamRadio11,2010-02-06T02:19Z,"Sorry, still not seeing any seeds. I now see 40 downloaders, all at 0.0%. TPB shows zero seeders and 93 leechers as I write this.  I have PeerExchange and DHT enabled, neither of those show a seed, or anyone with any percentage."
,GypsyRoads,2010-02-06T06:59Z,"Most ppl are at 52 percent,on my end.

My Ip throttles Uploads.

patients ppl :)"
,SteamRadio11,2010-02-08T00:01Z,"Look to the top of this page, where it says 'Seeders' - that is a big zero still? 
Patience is a virtue, but holding on forever is just silly. Using the download link here on TPB is not working. The file is bad?
I have now found a download link that DOES work, Google the Magnet link

,GypsyRoads,2010-02-08T01:44Z,"Hmm,I dont know.

Ive been seeding it for over 3 days now 24/7,and currently there is 5 seeds on my end.

i do see that it says 0 on piratebay,but on utorrent it says 5 seeds"
,SteamRadio11,2010-02-08T23:13Z,"The torrent file on The Pirate Bay is not connecting to anyone with the files. 
Perhaps you re-created the torrent file? The one I can download with is dated one day later than the one here on TPB... The hash codes differ.
I am now at 99.7% with zero seeds, so still cannot complete..."
,GypsyRoads,2010-02-09T12:16Z,"I think somehow win media player is responsible for changing a few of the songs.

If your missing a few songs.
