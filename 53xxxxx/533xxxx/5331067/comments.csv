,GLOV3,2010-02-03T09:19Z,"The idea for this movie is stolen from 'the Twillight Zone"""
[T],jerry7_57,2010-02-03T21:23Z,"Thanks, nice rip!!"
,JoBro.Hater101,2010-02-04T03:27Z,this movie isnt stolen from the twilight zone it was a short story written by Richard Mathesen the guy who wrote i am legend 
,fleetkid,2010-02-04T11:38Z,"A - 9
V - 8
Thanks :)

The colors seem to be bland"
,pirate_bit,2010-02-04T19:20Z,I really don't think that is a genuine rip.
,Rahk,2010-02-05T16:32Z,"Audio is OK, but there's a constant hissing in the background, which is annoying.

I'd go with another rip."

,Jonney12,2010-02-06T06:40Z,I really appreciate & like the presentation of  your  torrents  here in TPB...  The  quality  of video is great so is  that  way  you present  it with the  image  as  well as  the  content details...  Looking forward  to  see  more  of  your  torrents  here. 
,dragonzer0,2010-02-28T08:26Z,Twilight Zone probably used Mathesen's story for one of thier episodes. Either way the producer of this garbage movie was definitely in the twilight zone.
,theshape31,2010-03-05T18:09Z,"Thank you for the upload, I appreciate the audio quality.

However, this is just the worst film I have ever seen."
,fbhsrainman,2010-03-07T18:35Z,"good quality
A.9
V.9
 good dvd rip
Movie sucks though."
,humphreysj,2010-03-14T18:06Z,"I dont think this is a dvdrip. The video is decent and the audio has a slight hissing. This makes the guys voice (which is really deep) hard to understand at times. 
Thanks anyway"
,DDettonattorr,2010-03-28T18:16Z,"Thanks for taking your time to upload this Movie!

,adam1516,2010-11-19T00:06Z,"hhmmm some of the folks here must have watched an entirely different rip to me - both the video and audio were atrocious. Missed half the dialogue the sound was so poor.
