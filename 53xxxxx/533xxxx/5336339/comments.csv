,madtown4,2010-02-05T04:00Z,"well whats the info on this ? does this one stutter or pause for 5 secs in two spots , is it worth the 1.37gigs . i just want to know cause it takes me awile to download , just dont want to waist my time. so thanks if you can give some info"
,dardar6t9,2010-02-05T07:32Z,"Watched the T/S(which was good)This movie is a Keeper. One that goes on the shelf not in the ""Just another shit movie""pile.....Think I'll save my bandwidth for the DVD-RIP :)"
,Snes13,2010-02-05T09:23Z,"Ahh, I hate to rip on you Extremezone, but this isn't the best quality on here, sure it's missing the stutter, but I'd personally rather have the stutter with correct colors. The colors in this movie seem like they have a contrast imbalance, like if you turn your monitors contrast waaaay down and things look kind of white and fuzzy. The audio is odd as well, sounds like you're viewing it from an auditorium almost.

Save your bandwidth for a better version people. Keep up the good work though extremezone you guys put out shit tons of great torrents."

Your pink skull says you are trusted, but the only thing that can be trusted is the fact you will upload someone elses work under a different name.

I think you should have your account removed.

I don't need to upload anything here to voice my opinion, so again, what the fuck are you on about? Someone asked me to upload a particular movie so I did, but did I rename it?

,andrew87,2010-02-12T08:50Z,"QUALITY: (not from a film pirate n00b)

Audio: POOR.
Lots of pops and crackles. Also, the rip has killed the audio mix. The score is very low and can BARELY be heard. Not good.

Video: AVERAGE
Some glitches throughout the film. Biggest problem is the rip has caused some heavy de-saturation. That's a big problem.

VERDICT: So, if you have already seen this film, go ahead and download it. But if you haven't, wait until the DVD release as the score + lush visuals are worth the wait."
,Sojio,2010-02-12T18:15Z,"A/V 8.5/8.5

Besides the saturation issue this is a great upload. Did anyone else find that some of the CG was not fully rendered?

*spoiler*

The scene where jake gets chased by the panther alien and its trying to get at him through the tree. 

I found this was lacking some final textures? Can anybody clarify this?"
