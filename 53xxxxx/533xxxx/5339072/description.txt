From Wikipedia:

Wanna Be a Star is the ninth album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack, released in 1981. At this point, the band had collapsed into a trio, without a full-time drummer, but leader Bill Henderson and guitarist/keyboardist/drummer Brian MacLeod had become a powerful songwriting team during the interim. The album spawned a major hit single, "My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)." that reached #1 in Canada and the Top 20 in the U.S. This was Chilliwack's first hit since the 1979 collapse of their former label Mushroom Records, and led to a touring version of the group re-forming. "I Believe" was also a Top 10 Canadian hit and Top 40 U.S. hit off the album.

Overall the album is something of a concept album about the "rock and roll" lifestyle and the pursuit of fame. The leadoff track "Sign Here" is a reference to Chilliwack's new quest for mainstream success, tempered by their brush with fame on Mushroom. This was the first album they recorded with Solid Gold Records in Canada, a new Toronto-based label.
