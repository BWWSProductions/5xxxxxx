Technorganic is funky old-school influenced hip-hop laced with loopy downtempo. 

Technorganic is new underground hip-hop mixed with classic old-school tracks. 

Technorganic is best listened to loud, with headphones on, pounding the pavement in the urban jungle... but can still be enjoyed elsewhere.	

Enjoy!
