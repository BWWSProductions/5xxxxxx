,panosol,2010-02-05T19:36Z,to slow....
,mrsillyx11,2010-02-05T20:17Z,"I think when a real dvd rip shows up it will be AC3 6 channels, everything posted now it just 2 channel."
,deadlykiss,2010-02-05T21:09Z,Wish that it would be more seed 50kB/s isen't very good. Like 4000 leechers... Start seed plz
,kenji86,2010-02-05T21:15Z,yup..this is damn slow :((
,haumoana,2010-02-05T22:36Z,seed! seed! seed!
,lillsowi,2010-02-05T22:42Z,"Quality is just amazing!
Looks and sounds just like a DVDrip"
,zushigreg,2010-02-06T00:10Z,"wilywondr is right about the quality. it is good. The Navi dialogue is also hard-subtitled in English. And the included srt seems to be Russian, though on my screen I don't see the Cyrillic characters, I see this: Çàïëàùàíåòî ñúùî å äîáðî. Äàæå ìíîãî äîáðî.   

Thanks AiTB."
,sktrdie,2010-02-06T01:28Z,this looks better than DVDRip! Nice Vision!
,kiwilove007,2010-02-06T03:05Z,"A9 and V9 - this gets my vote as being the best available?  I presume the same file, same size elsewhere would be identical too.  I downloaded a Cam version a month or so ago, and couldn't watch it because it was so yucky.  Thanks for uploading this..."
,movietrailer,2010-02-06T04:35Z,"Holy shit this is too slow.

It'll take me a week to get it.

SEED."
,Stormless,2010-02-06T07:11Z,"Starts out slow but now I'm back up to my regular dl speed of 270 kb/s. Also, seeding like the wind. :)

Will comment further when it's done."
,sammygirl24,2010-02-06T07:46Z,"Wow this is really good just like a dvdrip thanks heaps the best for sure its just a little slow but worth the wait

A:10
V:10 Thanks"
,BigSniff,2010-02-06T10:08Z,"This is a really good copy, best I've seen and probably the best that will be around until BD/DVD rip."
,Death_Toad,2010-02-06T10:24Z,"A:9
V:9

Great quality, best one I've seen out of all the others. Recommended download for anyone to tide themselves over till the Blu Ray one comes out.

I'll try and seed as long as possible.

Seeding at around 300kB/s only for some reason, hopefully it'll increase to 1000kB/s+ soon."
,Stormless,2010-02-06T16:46Z,"Fabulous quality. A10/V10.

By far the best rip right now! Thank you uploader!"
,designzz,2010-02-06T17:04Z,"Great quality and sound, will seed for sure!"
,NightF0x,2010-02-06T18:50Z,"Great Quality Screener.. Doubt it could be any better. Worked flawlessly in VLC.

A: 10

Thanks for the up!!"
,EVIL_MONKEY_O3,2010-02-06T19:52Z,"has this one got the REAL Na'vi text in the movie and the correct lenght, around 2hr 36min?"
,Stormless,2010-02-06T19:52Z,Anyone else notice a bit of stutter at the 1:00:00? Haven't seen it anywhere else in the video just at that mark. Not sure if it's just me.
,arsonak45,2010-02-06T19:57Z,"Stormless is correct, there is a tiny stutter at around 1:00:00; however,t he rest of the film is perfectly fine, and still has great quality  =)"
,Stormless,2010-02-06T19:59Z,"Monkey, it's got hardcoded subs for the Na'vi and it's full length."
,kiwilove007,2010-02-07T05:28Z,Can anyone confirm that this is the best version out so far?  This filename and file size...  I did not notice any glitches present in this version.  With those comments/posters saying you can watch this movie online - can you download it too?
,Catphish,2010-02-07T08:48Z,"Thanks! Pretty good quality! 
What about subtitle file (srt) is it corrupt or maybe it's encoding problem???"
,chewbacca81,2010-02-07T08:56Z,"There is a promotional video clip that contains the footage around 1:00; if someone could use that to fix the stutter, that would be great."
,Ouzotime,2010-02-07T20:21Z,indeed the best copy out so far quality is excellent tyvm      AiTB for the up cheers to all
,latexink,2010-02-07T23:42Z,"It's funny how the subtitles are becoming like DRM for movies... unless they are hardcoded, people can't watch it on their tvs... (see also District 9)"
,noyznvoyz,2010-02-08T00:51Z,"very very good quality , a&v -->10/10..thanks"
,robert1960,2010-02-08T02:52Z,Catphish I believe the srt file is in Russian but as you don't have Russian fonts it comes up garbled.
,robert1960,2010-02-08T02:57Z,"Very good version.  Slight stuttering around the hour mark for a few seconds and at the very beginning for c1/2 seconds and that is it.  Overall a very good attempt that will suffice until the blu ray comes out in 2/3 months.

Wish you could get the 3d version for home use but that's an impossibility until 3d TVs are released?  "
,robert1960,2010-02-08T03:02Z,"Excellent version with slight stutter at the very beginning for 1/2 seconds and at the c 1 hour mark for 2-4 seconds and that is it.

Saw this in 3D and whilst no 2d version will match that, this is a worthy back up-Appreciated Thank you."
,robert1960,2010-02-08T03:05Z,Sorry about the double posting but there was a long delay before the first one appeared.

,_Anonymous10_,2010-02-10T00:08Z,"is this being tracked, anyone been issued a warning for downloading it yet. the FBI warning at the start of the film has been a first and just wanted to see if it was a set-up by them (again). if so i'm going to delete (after watching it) then buy once released!"
,arildus,2010-02-10T07:23Z,Thanx;)

I must say... it is the best one you can get and I'm not being picky...but if you're going to write a comment then write a real comment...  Thanks for the Up AITB"
,kiwilove007,2010-02-12T00:49Z,"In response to Johnson.N.Beaver.LTD. --- This particular file copy here, is certainly worth a V=10 rating, compared to the various camera versions previously available - which some ranked at 7?  Which I downloaded one, and refused to watch - because of the awful quality.  This is the one to download, until a BDrip turns up... soon?"

Are you all taking the piss?

Viruses should be sent to every single torrent downloader who DOESN'T reseed at least what they've downloaded.

Scum of scum.

The seeder count is clearly a fake!"
,Lildbehr,2010-02-15T00:54Z,"Somewhat slow this one... Maybe if someone would change there upload limit from 5 kb/s to atleast 20 kb/s, this would run so much smoother for everyone... And by the way thank for the upload, expectations are way up! "
,gratefulforthis,2010-02-15T09:54Z,"Those who say it's a screener so it can't be good need to get educated. It's a dvd copy of the film sent to industry professionals.

Anywho:

A:8
V:9 (it's spot on for what it is).
M:6.5 (because it's been over hyped).

It's NOT original and NOT groundbreaking. I mean for god's sake...it even has another Cameron style pissed off Mexican army chick!

Decent but even the CGI is inconsistent (one minute it's breathtakingly real the next it's cartoon like).

Bottom line though...download this and not that hideous cam one. ;)"

But guys, its going at about 5kb/s, COME PEOPLE START SEEDING!

It some stage it went at 80-130kb/s. Which was nice. But it stopped too soon.

Cmon i've been siting on 14% for AGES
SOMEONE seed for 8hours @ 150kb/s and ill seed as fast as i can once i have it!!!!!

So come on people, lets start to seed faster ok!!"
,shadowmilo2,2010-03-14T04:17Z,"Ok FINALLY it kicks its speed back up too its maximum download speed again....

GOOD, but lets just see how long it lasts for, too many people just DL n run.....

But its called PEER to PEER for a reason >.> :/

Oh well, says it'll be done in 4hours.... Ill be back in 4hours to tell you my verdict or b*tch on leechers again :P"
,shadowmilo2,2010-03-14T09:04Z,"Ok.

Im watching it, and the PICTURE is about a 9.

Audio, well its good. so an 8

But. It has a saturation issue.

I would recommend using VLC Media Player to play ANY media, not just this movie.
Once you have it, you right click the screen, go down to interface > effects and filters.

Then hit the Video Effect tab, and then tick the image adjust box.
Go down to saturation and drag it to exactly half way, that looks like the correct colouring for the movie.

And your done, enjoy the movie.

I believe that this torrent is the BEST avatar torrent there is, until the blu-ray 1080p version comes out.
Just adjust the saturation and your set.

Nice upload AiTB"
