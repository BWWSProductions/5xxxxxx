"
,b1_159,2010-02-26T12:06Z,wtf ....... somebody seed seed 
,Chili287,2010-03-12T23:50Z,I will download this torrent as soon as it's a confirmed as working properly. I really want to play this game.
,RanY2jith,2010-03-26T19:30Z,"Lags like SHIT

even i have a 9800gtx it lags like BULLSHIT "
,mrpras,2010-04-12T19:32Z,"You retard, go buy a Playstation2..

This is an emulator, you can't expect perfection. Also a 9800GTX is a really old card (3 years) so what do you expect?

Emulating hardware like the Playstation 2 takes a lot of power. Read up on emulation to see how complex and difficult it is.

Then go out and buy a playstation 2 and then buy this game. It's free here so stop whining you turd."
,wowme,2010-05-01T17:13Z,"The game crashes for me the moment i take the lightning power. The screen goes white and stays there. 

Oh well, worthed the try. "
,McKosto,2010-05-13T01:25Z,"God the same problem as you wowme (poseidons power). Still, found 2 more isos that worked. But the only one that works perfectly is : FOR PCSX2 GOD OF WAR FULL WORK.iso altough it is pretty big."
,McKosto,2010-05-13T01:38Z,"Don't really know why this is so big, but waht I know is it's the only iso that works all the way. Thanks man, great torrent!"
,McKosto,2010-05-13T01:40Z,"Oh, and scratch that 1st comment, god the windows mixed up and wrote it at the wrong torrent..... Oh, and RanY2jith, it ain't the games fault. It's you. If you want a perfect game, go get a ps2 and the original game. If you want an emulator, the deal with the fact it won't work so great, ok?"
,jbrad2,2010-08-13T22:45Z,"When I downloaded this it said it was an 8 gig file but when I open it in PowerISO only about 4 gig show up. Does anyone know why this might be? Am I supposed to install some plugin?
Thank you in advance."
,jbrad2,2010-08-13T22:46Z,And by the way there is no setup file or any .dll's.
,jbrad2,2010-08-13T22:48Z,by the way there is no Setup file or any dll's. Any help would be appreciated.
,orchlon,2011-02-19T07:37Z,PS2 emulation is 59% perfect right now. 59% of games will run bug free
,Simmesson,2011-03-07T02:39Z,"@mrpras
Just wanted to point out that my computer runs on a 8800 GT 512MB, and takes this without any problem at all. PS2, lots of power, PFAH."
,Livy.the.pixie,2011-04-18T12:56Z,To emulate this game you need a i7 3.0 or AMD equivalance. GPU does not matter. But is the iso PAL or NTSC?
,rocketero,2011-07-07T09:51Z,"I downloaded this iso file, and the emulator, but once I open the iso with emulator it opens fine I can see the main game window and the title 'start new game' but I click inside the window over the title and nothing happens, like the mouse has not configuration even that I had configured mouse and keyboard in the pscx2 setup.  any help is appreciated, thanks"
,rocketero,2011-07-07T13:22Z,never mind to my previous question/post. I found out how.  Pretty nice game thanks for the upload/sharing
