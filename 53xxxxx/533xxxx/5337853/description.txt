The Family are holed up in a cottage while Abby recovers when they meet a trader called Billy.

Later at Samantha's compound, Billy passes their location onto her and she orders her gun-toting henchmen to arrest Tom. Samantha intends to put Tom on trial for the murder he committed against one of her people.

Abby leads Greg and Anya after them, taking on the role of counsel for the Defence herself while the others become members of the jury. As Tom's brutal past is revealed the Family are confronted with the reality of the man they have been harbouring.
