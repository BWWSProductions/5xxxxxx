I don't know but I think the quality of this torrent is worse than other Scarface DVD Rips out there. I know this because I have downloaded many of the others out there. This one is sub par.

Audio: 5
Video: 6 (Watchable)
Movie: 10+

Like I said before, you're better off downloading other DVD Rips, this one is not special."
