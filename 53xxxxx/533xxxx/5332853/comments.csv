If I get this downloaded, I'll keep seeding.

Thanks"
,stealthpatch,2010-02-06T10:27Z,"Hey, is this NTSC or PAL?"
[T],thenoobish,2010-02-06T10:32Z,to be honest i dont really know if this is ntsc or pal :o
,yarisdude,2010-02-07T01:38Z,"If its SCEA then it ought to be NTSC. SCEE is Europe.

Only NTSC-versions support 480p and 1080i (sort'a)"
,yarisdude,2010-02-07T01:40Z,Oh.. and this is propably not the full version. Something has to have been removed as the original is DL-DVD.
,nicholes,2010-02-07T18:21Z,"there is no option to load menually the game in this game.and it saves automatically(though i have restricted auto save)that creats a big problum!whenever i bought a new car and then i do not like that car, i can not load my game again,my all credit is gone!!becouse it is automatically saves,onlyt option remeaning is to delete the game data from memry card and play again."
,yarisdude,2010-02-08T13:18Z,If you have more than one memory card you ought to be able to back up the save before you buy. Tedious but it should work.

,supz,2010-06-12T10:50Z,"@aravindhgear - JUST because you don't have two brain cells to rub together, it doesn;t give you the right to judge this torrent as being 'fucking shit'.  Grow the fuck up you noob son of a bitch.

@Everyone else - I patched this with ESR and played throught Free McBoot and it works just fine, so I imagine it will work on modded consoles as well.  I don't know about emulation - I don't use it."
,xiIix,2010-06-28T00:34Z,"Can't get it to display properly in PCSX2 using hardware. Menu's work fine, but once in game there's nothing but garbage on screen. I can't seem to remember which release of GT4 worked for PCSX2, but I had it running fine about a year go."

,xiIix,2011-05-24T16:48Z,I'm looking for a Pal version that works with PCSX2. So far I haven't found one that does. I want Pal because it only needs 50fps for 100% emulation rather than 60fps.
,S23T,2011-06-05T21:26Z,does this work on PCSX 2???
,XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX,2011-06-10T21:24Z,running it on PCSX2

,Kaje13,2012-03-11T14:18Z,"Thanks noobish!
Works great. I used Brasero Disc Burner on linux os and DVD-RW. This game's graphics is stunning plus the cars, maps, and gameplay is mind-blowing! I'll rape this game till morning coz I'm an insomniac."
,samljer,2012-04-02T02:33Z,"works great, would prefer PAL as thats the best ISOs for emulation ""full speed is a whole 10FPS less"" but this works fine

phenomII quad 2.8"
,sopran019,2012-06-11T11:31Z,"Download it, burn it on verbatim 4.7gb with dvd decrypter at 4x, works good... ;)"
,mclure22,2012-06-16T01:06Z,"Howdy fellers, if you get the disc error image on any ps2 console, and it's modded, you need to change the dvd region configuration to 2 for this release to work properly, this is a U.s.a launch, Google it up to find out how according to your videogame's mod chip.  Summing it up: Change your DVD Region settings from the firmware to 2 to be able to read the disc, specially if you're outside usa."

,djsensazion,2012-07-05T12:34Z,For T.Bor92 and others experiencing this issue. go to mediafire and download the free NTSC to PAL converter. This download is NTSC and you will experience this issue if your PS2 is in PAL mode (normally from europe). Use the converter NTSC to PAL (which take 2 secs max) then burn the image to 4.7 DVD-R and it will work perfectly.
,virag57,2012-07-05T14:50Z,@djsensazion  will this really work if i convert it in pal.......and will its size increase if i convert????
,joelouco,2012-07-07T20:03Z,Seed please.

,djsensazion,2012-07-09T12:19Z,@virag57 The converter simply patches the ISO file so it stays the same size. It works perfectly.
