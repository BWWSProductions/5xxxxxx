[V],bubanee,2010-02-05T08:33Z,Thankyou! :)
,JoiresWay-II,2010-02-05T17:27Z,ah... my pleasure!!
,mugwuffin,2010-02-06T10:29Z,"more superb tracks, thanks alot"
[V],bubanee,2010-02-07T11:50Z,Burn these songs to a disc.. did you write that right.. because the answer is No!.. i own the original discs Yes.. I ripped 99% with Dbpoweramp the first few rips were 3.98r and the rest 3.99a all set at the same setting of vbrv0.. the 1% more or less were done with EAC.. and some songs didn rip with either so they were left out altogether.. it's the same i'm going to do with the Flac i've got.. i will use Dbpoweramp again... :).. the only time i use EAC is when ripping a new CD release because i actually make the Flac first for myself and then change the profile!
[V],bubanee,2010-02-07T21:30Z,no i named it the ultimate collection.. go read the desript... in Pt.1... by me naming it the ultimate collection i sought of raised the bar a bit a challenge to myself.. so it could never end! thus why it's in parts so when i do run out of 80's songs and then i can still gather some more as i come across them and post the next Pt.. so on and on.... i couldn't do 1 big collection because i would of left heaps out.. :)
[V],jainmehul,2010-02-09T04:37Z,hey bubanee can u tell me why my all comments have been deleted????
,TowerMac,2010-02-10T03:22Z,good stuff indeed!! Hey Bubanee...... I've been waiting a few days now for your uploads. What's happening???
,TowerMac,2010-02-10T03:24Z,"I know I sound impatient, it's just that I really look forward to what you put up!! PEACE!"
[V],bubanee,2010-02-10T06:38Z,just doing a few other things at moment... don't worry i'm not stoppin! Cheers :)
[V],bubanee,2010-02-10T06:42Z,@ jainmehul > I guess it's because.. this is really classed as spamming where a torrent comment is meant for the torrent at hand... i am active in a few forums.. if you look around i won't say where due to this being TPB... but i'm not hard to find.. Cheers
,TowerMac,2010-02-10T15:18Z,"Waiting for your next installment of Ultimate Collection Of Hits Pt 14, any chance you could upload it up today?? I'm not really a fan of the two you posted up today. Cheers mate!!"
[V],bubanee,2010-02-10T15:32Z,either tomorrow or next after... got some things on elsewhere at moment.. the next one will be the last.. for a little while..
