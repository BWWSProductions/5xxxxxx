It doesn't work!

When I install this, nothing happens or when .net bla bla and visual c++ get installed, this ""runtime error"" comes up.

When I install the demo from fbl-game.com, the file is 101 MB, it comes up one screen says ""Please wait"", but in the same moment an error-sound pops up.. If I press any key the game shut down.

Visual C++ and .net bla bla is for SERVICE PACK 1, I've SP2 ???

What is the problem?? HELP!"
