"In the summer of 2008 rhys chatham visited bern for a guitar trio performance together with 

local musicians that the club had recruited for him. they rehearsed during the day and 

played a fabulous show that night. rhys was blown away by the skills of the drummer and bass 

player and talked about plans to form a trio - half a year later he was back in bern and 

introduced julian sartorius (drums) and mago flueck (bass) to new compositions he brought 

along. beat unternÃ¤hrer on trombone joined as guest musician. reto mÃ¤der (rm74, sum of r, 

ural umbo) recorded many hours of these sessions on a multi-track machine. over the next few 

months, mÃ¤der listened to the recordings, separated the wheat from the chaff, selected the 

best parts and made pre-mixes. after more than 100 hours of work, a brand new rhys chatham 

album was finally mixed and mastered. the result is an album of new rhys chatham tracks with 

this band - something you haven't heard since the die donnergÃ¶tter recordings of the 80s..."
