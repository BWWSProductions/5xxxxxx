Finally, I have the 1.9 Hotfix for Dawn of War II.

YOU MUST HAVE 1.8 ALREADY INSTALLED OR ELSE YOUR GAME PROBABLY WON'T WORK.

In order to patch your game, all you have to do is have the 1.8 patch already installed. 

Once thats complete, Copy all the files inside the folder "dow2 patch1.8.0-1.9.0" and place them into your installation directory. In my case
"E:/Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War II/DoW2/"

Have fun and play your game!
Btw, to get free Games for Windows LIVE Product Keys, go to your local Gamestop Retailer, and open every Games for Windows LIVE box, one is bound to have a product key. Whether or not it is for the game you want to activate, it might work. I used ONE product key on NINE Games for Windows LIVE games. It works. The product key doesn't always work for different games, but I used a "Fallout 3" product key on different games, and on Windows Vista and my Windows 7 Ultimate upgrade. I also used a product key for "The Club" about 12 times on different Windows Installations and on different games. "Stormrise" unfortunately did not work with any games and Stormrise is shit so I don't have it.

Anyways, have fun and happy gaming!
