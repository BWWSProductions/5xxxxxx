,coldlazymo,2010-02-06T03:30Z,"as in your one key let you play 9 GFWL games online, or you could use it to get the achievements but not play the games online?"
,SgtFurby,2010-02-06T06:58Z,"I used ONE key and I can play NINE games online. I've used it for GoW, The Club, Halo 2, DoW II etc. etc. I used one key and it gave me full functionality for all the games I activated. Achievements, online gameplay, rank, stats, voice chat, everything. When you copy a key at gamestop, enter it in your phone, but make it look like your texting a friend about the game. Remember 5 of the letters/numbers, turn the game on the backside, type the 5 characters *making it look like your typing info on the back* and your good to go. Gamestop wont bother you they always think youre trying to get your friend to buy a game too so theyre like Yay!"
,Gabi12345,2010-02-06T07:39Z,Where can we find patch 1.8?
,SgtFurby,2010-02-06T20:48Z,I'll upload Patch 1.8 now....
,coldlazymo,2010-02-07T00:27Z,are you sure about that sgt? i tried using one key on a few different games and it didnt work :( and a legit key too not from a keygen
,SgtFurby,2010-02-07T01:04Z,"yeah. i got a key from The Club and used it on Windows Vista, Windows 7 RC, and Windows 7 Ultimate *when i was upgrading* and it worked on most of my games. What key is it for? What game? btw, i got my Club key from technical support as the game didnt come with a key"
,coldlazymo,2010-02-07T18:32Z,"yeah i got the exact same thing, cos i remember they were giving them away for free, but everytime i try it on something else, like dirt 2, it just says invalid key, is there something else i should be doing?"
,SgtFurby,2010-02-09T05:02Z,"yeah im sure, its just that idk if itll work with newer games. i know i had problems using The Club key on Red Faction Guerrilla. try your key on.... well, tell me what game the key is for.... and what game(s) you wanna use it on."
,SgtFurby,2010-02-10T07:26Z,yup i just used The Club key on Bioshock 2 :)
,coldlazymo,2010-02-10T16:17Z,"yeah same! just played it online! seems to work for quite a few games, dirt 2 it doesnt work for though :(
