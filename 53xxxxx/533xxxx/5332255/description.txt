Nearly two full hours of step-by-step instruction detail the use of computer-generated curve picks, rockers, magnetic lock picking, lockaid guns and electronic picks in this classic revolutionary video. You'll see the craft of picking pin tumbler, wafer, tubular cylinder and padlocks; quick, undetectable methods for beating the most popular locks in the U.S.; and opening safes via drilling, burning bars, thermite and the European explosive method. Whether you're a locksmith, cop, detective or just a concerned citizen  (or a wannabe burglar) , you cannot afford to miss this exceptional video. For academic study only.

Quality is VHS-rip, unsure of date made but judging from the hair and clothes I'd guess sometime in the early 1990s.

Thanks to mainacore for the up, and props to whoever ripped it.
