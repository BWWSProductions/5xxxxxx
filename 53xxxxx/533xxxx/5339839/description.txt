| Plot summary |
----------------
A young woman quietly falls to the earth, escorted by a solitary crow. This sort of dream, as many others before have dreamed, comes just before being reborn as a Haibane, a charcoal-winged angel. On the outskirts of the walled-in city lies Old Home, a haven for Haibane to study, live, and learn, while waiting for their chance to ascend to the heavens and escape the confines of their new world. Rakka is the newest inhabitant of Old Home who wants nothing more than to remember her past and discover the secrets of her kind. Together with Reki, Kuu and plenty of other new friends, Rakka will laugh, explore, and search for the meaning of their existence in the process.

All MKVs work flawlessly (video, subs, audio, chapters) in VLC (1.0.3), SMPlayer (0.6.8 SVNr3213), and Media Player Classic (1.3.249) with CCCP on Win XP 32-bit SP3. 

VLC playback is flawless on Win 7 64-bit. Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit has non-showing subs in MPC and flashing on full-screen SMPlayer (these are both likely just program settings, since at this time neither MPC or SMPlayer has a Win7 64 bit release).

Upon looking at various BT sites I was unable to find a 720p version of Haibane Renmei, as Geneon (Pioneer) has only released a 480p DVD box set for consumers. Though there is much criticism on upscaling source footage to higher resolutions, this release was a learning project for me to minimize artifacts and properly optimize encoding times for just such an upscale. I managed to obtain the DVDs from a friend, retailing at $180, giving me the opportunity to work on DVD files rather than simply an already re-encoded release.

I wanted to learn every step that many release groups go through for this project, so I taught myself much, including demuxing, optimal video and audio encoding methods, creating subtitles, chapter markings, properly merging metadata, and muxing MKVs and MP4s (not used for this release as MKV was more flexible).

Getting a new computer with three 1TB drives, a Quad-Core Intel i7 920 2.66Ghz, and 6GB RAM helped motivate me to test my system.

I greatly enjoy this anime, and am a great fan of Yoshitoshi ABe's works including Serial Experiments Lain and Welcome to the N.H.K. Haibane Renmei is more of a psychological series than action or drama oriented. Out of the thirteen episodes, the first five serve to build the settings and characters in the show, so if you find it rather slow, it picks up at episode six through the end. The first time I watched Haibane Renmei I was greatly moved by it, and have thought upon it much. The fictional countryside of Glie serves very well in applying salvation, forgiveness, punishment, redemption, and growth to one's own life. I hope you enjoy watching one of ABe's masterpieces as much as I have.
