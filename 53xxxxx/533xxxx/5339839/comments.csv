It's a forum board that discusses in depth the different psychological and theological principles that can be taken from the show, and can help give a sense of perspective. I personally believe that there is no correct interpretation of Haibane Renmei, and that's how ABe intended the show to be, the answers that matter are those only you can find and grow from. There are no absolute truths for what the Haibane are, what they did before arriving in Glie, or what earns black wings or charcoal. If you would like to look a bit deeper into Haibane Renmei after watching the whole series, the Old Home Forums can provide plenty of insight.

I'm trying to convert this to DVD using the VLC media player, but the sound isn't coming across.

Is it stored in the .skv file that is labeled Haibane Renmei Episodes 1-13.sfv?"
