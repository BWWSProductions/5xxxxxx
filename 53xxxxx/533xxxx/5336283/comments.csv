,babo_1970,2010-03-30T09:24Z,"If you mean how to open torrent file, then u should have an application to download the SW using this link file named torrent. If u succeed to do so u will have some rar file that can be easily extracted using winzip or winrar."

1st - Download both this torrent 'Rosetta Stone 3 ~ English (British) Level 1~2~3 [PC ~ Multi]' (The Language Pack ISO) & Rosetta Stone 3.4.5 ~ Language Learning [PC ~ Multi] (Application Setup Installation)

name: LongLiveTPB  : 5ZXI3-MIUZ1-UBU9P-EWW8Y-PI7AP

3rd - Install WinRAR if you haven't got it already (If you do Skip this)

4th - In your torrent download folder open the Rossetta Application Setup (Rosetta Stone 3.4.5 ~ Language Learning [PC ~ Multi]) RAR file> open the Rossetta Folder> iniciate the Rossetta v3.4.5.exe> Let the installation install itself> IMPORTANT NOTE: Before the installation is finished notice a little square box on the bottom left hand corner that says 'LUANCH' beside it with a tick on> it UNTICK IT> then click finish.

5th - Okay done? back to the the (Rosetta Stone 3.4.5 ~ Language Learning [PC ~ Multi]) RAR file> open the crack then win folder> copy 'RossettaStoneVersion3.exe'> go to C:\Program Files\Rossetta Stone|Rossetta Stone Version 3\  Paste the .exe in here (Click the windows start button> computer> (C:) Program files or Program files x86-if youre using a laptop> Rossetta Stone > Rossetta Stone Version 3> Paste it in here) >Windows will ask you if you want to overwrite the existing file> click yes.

6th - Its not over yet> Now its time to burn some ISOs> Open the PowerISO program (or you can use what ever ISO burning program you got)> Go back to your torrent downloads file> this time open 'Rosetta Stone 3 ~ English (British) Level 1~2~3 [PC ~ Multi]' RAR file (the language pack) > Grab the first one ISO drap&drop it into the PowerISO window> Insert a black DVD> when the ready click the burn button> now all you have to do is repeat the same thing for the rest of the ISOs> once you are done close PowerISO.

7th - okay if you've made it this far with out messing up I'm very impressed> click the windows start button on the lower left hand corner> look for the Rossetta Stone Verson 3 you installed earlier in the menu> click to iniciate the program (leave the window open)> you should see a small menu with 3 options one begin blanked out (If you recieve an error message the moment you start up the program it obviously means something gone wrong. If so I would recommend uninstalling it and rereading my instructions all over again.) >If you didn't get an error message lets get cracking! >insert the 1st (level 1) DVD you burned earlier into your drive> open PowerISO> open Rosetta Stone 3 ~ English (British) Level 1~2~3 [PC ~ Multi] RAR file> drag&drop the 1st ISO into PowerISO> go over to your Rossetta Stone Version 3 Application window that you left open earlier (not the RAR file) >there are 3 options - click the 1st 'Add a language level' >click continue >now if you have followed me so far it should say 'searching' (if not it means theres something wrong) >select level one from the tab menu >click 'install selected language' > let the program install itself >guess what if you've made it this far - hay presto, your done!

Just repeat the exact same thing for the rest of the level DVDs and ISOs for PowerISO.

Once the DVD is install you shouldn't need it anymore to load the language level packs. Do I understand the science behind this?  No I don't, nobody cares how it work as long as it work!  Don't worry about updates or anything like that but re"
,XenoSilvano,2010-06-07T15:25Z,sorry ignore what I wrote above I just found out it to be wrong.  just follow the instructions given in the readme file carefully if it doesn't work restart your computer and iniciate the Rosetta Application it should now read the CD.
