The Dead Texan is the audio/visual duo of musician Adam Wiltzie and Greek video artist Christina Vantzou. Wiltzie is better known as one half of the ambient project Stars of the Lid, opposite Brian McBride. 

As of yet, there has been only one Dead Texan release, a self-titled CD/DVD package. The music is very similar to that of Stars of the Lid: long, droning, ambient soundscapes with Stars-esque instrumentation. The songs on The Dead Texan, however, are generally shorter, and lyrics can be heard at times. Indeed, the songs were initially intended to be released as another Stars of the Lid album, but it was ultimately deemed, as Wiltzie put it, "too aggressive."
