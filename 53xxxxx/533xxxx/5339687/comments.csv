,me-again,2010-02-06T17:16Z,.rar files are uploaded by people who don't really understand how torrents work. 
,me-again,2010-02-06T17:19Z,"http://torrentfreak.com/unpack-rar-archives-before-you-release-a-torrent/ torrentfreak.com has an article detailing why .rar is useless for torrents. Here is one extract:

RAR archives in torrents waste disk space and hinder useful BitTorrent client features, without adding anything of value. In other words, they are a useless pain in the ass."
,zx6r6,2010-02-12T23:12Z,"BEWARE! this ones rar'ed with a password. There's a link to download the file with the password but to get it you have to fill out a ton of surveys, enter competitions etc etc ALL which require your details. After 15 minutes of filling in fake details on numerous sites I gave up!
Don't say I didn't warn you! "
,Kaupo,2010-02-14T05:05Z,"stop nerdraging about ppl using .rar
if you don't like it then just don't download it

the only bad thing I that I see about it is that I personally won't keep the .rar versions of this on my computer for very long and so I won't be able to seed the torrent for as long as I would if it was in video format"
,charta77ers,2010-03-07T20:55Z,"Stop supporting TvTeam... rar file is protected with pwd. Forcing you to go out signing up for a crapload of surveys.

pwd is: caprica9371"
,ikoberry,2010-03-18T17:36Z,"Password protected, must sign up for tons of offers, basically volunteer to be spammed, have your identity stolen etc... 
Gee how great is that? "
,ikoberry,2010-03-18T18:35Z,"My bad, this is NOT! I repeat NOT PW protected.
My apologies.
I would remove my previous comment if I knew how."
