,Mexako,2010-03-26T22:23Z,"I have Jasc paint shop Pro 9 installed, this won't interfere with the installation for Corel?"
,isisx3,2010-03-29T15:41Z,"Okay, step by step:


1. Disable your internet connection.

2. Extract the files out of the .rar you downloaded.

3. Run the PSPP_X3_TBYB.exe file that you extracted, and wait...

4. Exit PSP_X3_TBYB.exe after the installation window shows up.

5. Agree to terms and services. Click Next, Wait... When the installation finishes, it will exit.

6. Go to your firewall, and block the following programs:  (The files may or may not have a .exe after them) Corel PaintShop Pro X3.exe, AP Loading.exe, Batch DL.exe, DeviceSyncHost.exe, DIM.exe, PSPProjectCreator.exe, uvdetecthw.exe, uvGGPL.exe, WiaRegister.exe. (These should all be in the PSPX3 program folder. EX: C:/Program Files/Corel/Corel PaintShop Pro /X3/) Then also these files, Corel Photo Downloader.exe, RtDevDetector.exe, Which should be in the (C:/Program Files/Common Files/Corel/) Also block PsiService_2.exe which should be in the folder (C:/Program Files/Common Files/Protexis/License Service/),  If you do not have one or any of these in your firewall list then manually add them to the list and block internet access for them. 

7. Then locate Corel Paint Shop Pro X3 And run it.

8. A window might show up welcoming you to the 30 day free trial, click continue.
 If it doesn't show up skip to step 13.


9. Select the ""Register Now Using A Web Browser"" option, click next. It will open a web browser window that you may go ahead and close.

10. Open the key gen, inside the keygen folder labeled ""CPSPP.X3_Keygen.exe""

11. Click the ""Key Code"" button on the keygen application, copy the code that will then show up.

12. Go to your PSPX3 registration window and type in the Key Code in the box for the Confirmation Code. Click Next and it should open up the PSPX3 program. 

13. Go ahead and exit the program. Do not use the program and do NOT save anything. Wait until the registration process is finished.

14. When you exit PSPX3, A window will show up saying they hope you're enjoying your free trial, On the bottom left hand corner of the window it will have a button that says ""Already Purchased?"", Click that. If it doesn't, re-do steps 8-13. If it still doesn't disable the Protexis (instructions below.)

15. Paste the ""key code"" from the keygen in the box next to where it says ""Please enter your serial number:"" in the top hand part of the window.

16. The ""Phone Corel"" option should now be available to click on, go ahead and click on it. The window should now show your installation code, serial code, and a box where should go your activation code, and your ID code. 

17. Type in or copy and paste your installation code from the registration window into the keygen. Then click Generate in the keygen application.

18. You should now see your activation code, copy it and paste it into the empty box next to the phrase ""activation code"" in the registration window. Click Continue.

19. You may then save to file your codes, or not. Then Close.

20. You may now close the keygen.


As Said in the READ ME file:
* Disable the option ""Check for Update Automatically"". 

* Do NOT update the program (do NOT check for program updates)!




I disabled the protexis the way it says so on the download but it damaged program and wouldn't run. Then I had to uninstall and reinstall, I tried several other ways and it also did not work. Everytime I get something wrong I need to uninstall and reinstall, I'm ganna try a few more times but the install and uninstall take a while, and since I can't be online for any of it, it gets in the way of me seeding. So, I'll report back if I get it to work."

Using a firewall to block unwanted internet traffic is very easy to learn ....."
,isisx3,2010-03-30T16:25Z,"@RH, I realize it's easy, but when I was installing coreldraw (also by CORE) a while ago there were tons of comment's asking things like ""how do I disable my internet connection?"" and ""how do I get the keygen to work?"" so I thought I'd just post a step by step so that people wouldn't even need to ask. 

@Mexako, I've had problems with installs in the past with regions on pirated programs, so as a precaution I always choose United States when they ask. Try that? && I have jasc PSP too, it shouldn't interfere. "
[V],RobbingHood,2010-03-31T02:27Z,"@isisx3 

It's okay. :)

As written at the torrent description you can also set a firewall to decide yourself what to allow or block if an application tries to connect to internet. That's even better, cause most firewalls will also automaically allow traffic for infected files if they try to connect to internet.

Part of the install notes:
* Block internet access for the program by using e.g. a firewall: 
> Block internet access through ""Program Control"" from your firewall.
> Or set ""Program Control"" from your firewall to ""Ask what to do""/""Decide yourself""."
,Mexako,2010-04-06T05:18Z,"@isisx3 

Thanks but I only got so far with your ""step by step 1 - 5:"" but then I cannot continue steps 6 - 20.

It gave me the same error message again    ""Installation Wizard not completed: Your system has not been modified. To complete installation at another time, please run setup again. Click finish to ext the wizard. Fatal error during installation""

I have tried the United States region but still the same error. 

Does anyone know what to do to get this program to work and how to solve this error I'm getting??

Much appreciated! :)"
,Mexako,2010-04-07T02:53Z,"@ isisx3  and  RobbingHood 

Could the program not run because of my computers specification:

[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-08T18:20Z,"@Mexako 

You can easily figure it out yourself, since system requirements are mentioned at the torrent description and many websites."

,jakrii,2010-05-03T16:33Z,"For Those Who are Confused about How to Activate Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X3

Installations:


1. Disconnect internet during installation.

2. Install Corel PaintShop Pro X3 v13 and open the application ""one time"" as TRIAL, do NOT register the program!

3. Upon opening the application the second time, you will get a dialog with a button titled ""Already Purchased? (It's on the bottom left side of the application window)

4. Click on ""Already purchased?"". Enter your serial number (See Step 5) and click ""Phone Corel""

5. At the screen where the program asks for a Serial Number use the Keygen to generate a Serial Number by clicking the ""Key Code"" button. (AFTERWARDS DON'T GENERATE A NEW KEY) and keep the keygen application open to complete additional steps below! 

6. In the same corel window copy the provided ""Installation Code"" (20 digits) WITHOUT the dashes or spaces (eg. 12345123451234512345) into ""Installation Code"" field of the keygen application.

7. Click ""Generate"" and copy the ""Activation Code"" into the Corel Activation Code blank box field.

8. Complete the activation process by clicking on ""Continue"". If the activation process won't continue then just close the window. It hould be fully activated. "

Follow the enclosed instructions, and then additionally replace also psiclient.dll in the \Corel PaintShop Photo Pro\X3\PSPClassic\ folder using the same PSIKey_2.dll rename method you used in the X3 folder.

I did it offline, but when I tried to run the program after I disabled it (and back online) I got the message that the program was an illegal copy, and to please install the original.

So the Proexislicensingservice disabling DOES NOT WORK with X3 (the document did say that it had not been tested on X3 - that's why I created a System Restore point before I did it.

- NEXT which is disabled. I left it overnight too but nothing loads up and you have no option but to cancel it.

I tried to download the 30 trial from the corel site and that too causes the same screen. 
So presumably it has nothing to do with this download but something is missing on the computer or has some pre-requistes which need to be installed.

Any help is appreciated.

I used PSP since version 2 and loved it. But this version takes forever to do anything. It took an hour to simply get running the first time as it searched through every file on my laptop.

I am going over to the new Paintshop pro: Photoshop Elements! Much faster and with only the photo editing stuff. This is how PSP used to be in the days when it was written by JASC. Corel sucks balls for what it has done to this one-time brilliant program."

Norton detected a back door trojan in the keygen and considered it high. I don't ever bash people for viruses I was just surprised. I know Norton is pretty cautious..maybe overly, but I decided not to go ahead with installing...no sense jeopardizing a new computer.. "

First, after dling it, disable your internet. Follow the instructions on the README! file. First time I installed it, it failed to activate, but after uninstalling it and re installing, works great!"
