,CraZyXHeaDX,2010-02-05T08:13Z,I am pretty sure that nands are machine specific.
,elma1337,2010-02-05T14:19Z,Just use Sneek V2 to make a NAND backup of your own Wii :)
,Konsolero,2010-02-09T16:19Z,"its good to brick the wii, i think i need my own nad!! And not a universal one !!"
,akuma6099,2010-02-17T01:59Z,"Yes all nands are encrypted and Wii specific. They can be decrypted if you have both keys, which is in this nand dump. Plus everything about this persons Wii is now public. Including purchased goodies, Mii's, IP settings..... Not good. Unless they were smart and virginized thier Wii first."
