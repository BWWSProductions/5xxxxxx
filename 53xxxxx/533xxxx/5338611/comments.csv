,grayscales,2010-02-05T21:04Z,"Hi 2040.  

Thanks for this, Fringe, Human Target, Leverage, Caprica, and the movies you've upped lately.

I wouldn't be surprised if you receive requests for new series The Deep End.  It's pretty good."
,benjohn,2010-02-05T21:52Z,"nice work mate....any chance of uploading the whole season 3 of burn notice...
thnx in advance"
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-05T22:37Z,"Thanks guys, thanks Jon, my friend...as you all can see, as always interest is pretty low, lowest of all today's shows: 37 full downloads and 16 people stayed as seeders (statistics for first 6h). It is, unfortunately too low to push Burn Notice in my schedule.
However, I will follow through the whole season and no further requests or ""reminders"" are needed.

@greyscales: LOL, after I read few very, very negative articles about Deep End I wasn't even tempted. Especially when I found out that Billy Zane is one of the cast members. I was sure then, like gazillion percent.

@benjohn: It is simply too big for me. I am just one guy with two years old PC and very limited connection speed.

@steve: Vampire Diaries - I cannot tell you how many times I was asked the same and explained my reasons for: No, thanks."
