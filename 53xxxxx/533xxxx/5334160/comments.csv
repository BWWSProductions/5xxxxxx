[V],twentyforty,2010-02-04T09:24Z,@madtown4: Already here. It's in the line. Today.
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-04T09:33Z,"@surajitghosh37: I'll do my best to find something nice - BUT - same as for other horror titles - I must see what is about and what is the quality of the movie - by my measures and standards. Aside from that, I am pretty busy today, in fact this whole week. I already have many requests on waiting. So - answer is: maybe, next week."
