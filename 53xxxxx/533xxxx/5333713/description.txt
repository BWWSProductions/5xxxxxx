A hard-boiled tale of bloody revenge... Cash, a gun-slinging ex-convict, is on a death quest to find Hector Gonzales, the man who murdered his wife over a decade ago. Hector Gonzales is a ruthless kingpin who has risen through the ranks over the last ten years and now stands on the verge of ruling the city - a city on the verge of an all out syndicate war. Cash and Gonzales are on an ultra-violent collision course that will determine, once and for all, who owns the streets.
