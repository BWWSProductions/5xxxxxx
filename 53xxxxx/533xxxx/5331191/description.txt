Congress came outside this morning â€“ saw the budget  â€“ so expect six more weeks of bickering.  At least.  But that debate wonâ€™t even compare the the red-hot issue of overturning the inane â€œdonâ€™t ask-donâ€™t tellâ€ gays in the military policy initiated by Clinton.  Expect the right-wing homophobes to come out in force (no pun intended) over that one.  Theyâ€™re going to give the tea-baggers a run for their money (no pun intended) in the Obama-slamming department.

Weâ€™ll also discuss the shocking news about Autism and vaccines that was released today, more on the ACORN pimp, and how the Camry became the Pinto.
