Music style
Initially, the 69 Eyes' music style was of glam metal and hard rock, influenced by acts such as MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e and Hanoi Rocks. However, they began to incorporate more influence from gothic rock bands such as The Mission and The Sisters of Mercy. Their sound was described as a mix of the gloominess of gothic rock with guitar-powered rock'n'roll. Their music continued to show influence from other rock artists such as The Doors, Elvis Presley, Hanoi Rocks, Billy Idol, and The Sisters of Mercy as well as vampire films and literature. The term "goth 'n roll" is used by fans to describe their style. In recent times with the release Back in Blood, the 69 Eyes have moved back to a more guitar based sound, although gothic imagery and lyrical themes remain forefront in their style.
