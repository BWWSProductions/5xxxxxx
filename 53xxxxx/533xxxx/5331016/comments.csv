,TheEmpathicEar,2010-02-04T04:06Z,"Thanks, great up!
NOTE: There is no patch folder. The keygen acts as both a patch and serial generator. If you use this on   Vista/7, you will need to run the keygen as administrator in order for the patch to succeed."
,TheEmpathicEar,2010-02-04T04:10Z,What's your preference on Vista/7? This or TuneUp Utilities?
[V],kentucky-kid,2010-02-04T17:33Z,"sorry, i never touch vista or 7 before :P"

,bridog80,2010-02-24T20:28Z,"Thanks! I've been a firm user of TuneUp Utilities for years. But their latest version constantly runs in the background. Very annoying. I'll give this a try,  thanks again."

,Original_Sinner,2010-05-11T16:20Z,"NEVER UPDATE!!!!! that is how they will tell that it is pirated, other than that it woks great

Heres all I did:

Install .exe file

Close after install,I didnt even select a skin type

then open the key gen

put a name on the second line (NOT your true name noob)

then hit generate

copy code

close keygen

open the Advanced System care(it will still show free edition)

click upgrade button

then click enter activation code now

put name and code 

thats it,not sure about whate they were talking about in the instructions, the keygen shows it is already patched



"
,ziplob,2010-05-14T16:23Z,"Thank you so much it works great,my pc is like new again.
Advanced SystemCare Pro the best piece of software i have ever used."
,zack517,2010-05-24T02:51Z,thxs worked great
,pwif,2010-06-08T04:55Z,"thanks kentucky, again. you have given me iobit security 360 pro and now this :D"
,Hero_Cake,2010-06-15T02:30Z,"Okay, so I can see that some people are going to have problems here [me for one]
kentucky-kid and PSK's instructions were very helpful but it wasnt complete...
But i found a solution:
W7 and possible Vista users, if the patch thing (named 'keygen') isnt working, then try moving it to the folder in which all the files are contained:
something like (C:/>Program Files>IOBIT>advanced systemcare)
then right click and run as administrator

it should work. if not, oh well sorry"
,boxxy1989,2010-06-20T18:47Z,"Worked fine for me. I'm curious about updating though. Will it surely recognize that the registration was non-legit?
Also, I use windows 7 and not only you have to run the keygen as administrator, you also have to run the program itself as administrator."
,dragon_fly,2010-09-14T08:23Z,"Window 7 user. Just downloaded and it worked. I just want to clarify a few steps on the ""kegen patch"" process. Hero_cake directions worked but i was confused as to what it means to drag it. What files, so here it is.

1. Unrar using Winrar/Winzip

2. Run installer/setup file

3. After installation ends, DO NOT UPDATE, close program completely(from taskbar as well)

4. open keygen.exe file

5. click ""patch"", as said and you'll get  pop up window.

5. Now go to your download folder and drag  the Advanced systemcare file into one single file like here. (C:/>Program Files>IOBIT>advanced systemcare)

6. Now, Right click on that Advance systemcare file you just drag in and Run as Admin. By doing this it created the file path like this :  
C:\Program Files\IObit\Advanced SystemCare 3\AWC.exe

6. click the drop down arrow and select the file path as above and click open

7. now server check is killed (you should get a displayed message)

8. To generate the key, type in a name before clicking the Generate button and use the generated key to register.
 Note: The picture was black. I almost could not find where to a name. There are 3 black lines on that black screen. Type a name on the 2nd line.
hope this helps.

9. Done"
,dragon_fly,2010-09-14T09:55Z,"CORRECTIONS to step 6 above ongoing.. both Vista and window 7.
6. Now, click to open the Advance systemcare you just drag in. Then right click on the set up file and run as admin. By doing this it created the file path like this : 
C:\Program Files\IObit\Advanced SystemCare 3\AWC.exe

7. now click on Keygen file to open. click Patch and you will get a pop up window. click the drop down and select the file path. then click open.

7. now server check is killed (you should get a displayed message)

8. To generate the key, type in a name before clicking the Generate button and use the generated key to register.
Note: The picture was black. I almost could not find where to a name. There are 3 black lines on that black screen. Type a name on the 2nd line.
hope this helps.

9. Done"
,ExaileDK,2010-09-22T22:27Z,this patch also works with the latest version 3.7.0 :)
,Ageagren,2010-09-30T12:53Z,"Great! Now I have the 3.7.0 pro version!
Thanks for the up! =D"
