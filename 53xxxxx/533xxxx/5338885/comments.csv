,EVIL_MONKEY_O3,2010-02-05T22:28Z,"what is the story with this torrent, i downloaded the sample and it looks good but sample playback is glitchy or laggy. is the rest of the film like this?"
,NanoEntity,2010-02-06T05:16Z,"Is this imagine release with shutter?

or someone fixed the release?

Every 4th frame is being duplicated, and needs to be removed to make it watchable."
,EVIL_MONKEY_O3,2010-02-06T10:01Z,"V:10/10(part from the shutter problem)

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5336460/AVATAR.2009.DVDSCR.XviD.AC3-ViSiON-[tracker.BTARENA.org]

No skipping as many others uploads have had. If you don't want to waste your time with a possible shitty 2GB download - go download this one.

 Don't forget to seed!"
