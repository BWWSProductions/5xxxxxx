,hauntnut,2011-05-12T19:21Z,"@ MoviesR101: 720x304 is the same thing as 720x480, only without the black bars at the top and bottom. When an anamorphic DVD is mastered, a 2.35:1 widescreen image has black bars in order to allow it to fit the frame of a widescreen television. When uploaders rip DVDs to put them on here, most of them crop the black bars out to allow for more bitrate on the actual image itself. "
