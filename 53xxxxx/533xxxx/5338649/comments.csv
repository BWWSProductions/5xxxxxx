,mostar12345,2010-02-07T20:47Z,Thanks. Will list # 1 be enough for P2P sharing or should I get some more?
,donkeydick121,2010-02-08T13:59Z,"mostar12345 - I think it's best if you merge all the six IP lists included. They give a pretty good selection.

There are lots more available but the more you put in, the harder the program works and it will get more hungry for resources.

If you find it's slowing your machine down, it can be run as a service which takes almost no resources.

The downside to that though is it becomes invisible and you can't see what's going on."
