    [ Release Notes ]

      In the dark recesses of a warehouse, a drunken game of cards explodes
      into a shocking murder. Now the night watchman lays dead. The only
      witnesses a housefly or perhaps a cockroach that might be skittering
      by.

      That stylized tribute to our seemingly endless appetite for TV programs
      about forensic science sets the stage for an examination of how, in the
      real world of police investigations, nature is being enlisted in the war
      on crime.

      With the help of Dr. Jennifer Gardy, of British Columbia's Centre for
      Disease Control (CDC) we spend the next hour sifting through the mayhem,
      murder and science that make up the world of forensic investigation. In
      the field and the lab we follow scientists who are able to read the
      subtlest evidence and turn nature to righting wrongs. Sometimes these
      clues are disturbing, sometimes they are surprisingly beautiful. You'd
      be hard pressed to find a better guide, than Dr. Gardy, to this world
      where, plants, bones even dust, can be turned into formidable enemies of
      crime.

      But the real secret of using science for solving crime may be less about
      technology and more about the careful observation of the natural world.
      Partnering the latest technologies with nature's own detectives produces
      a powerful combination that is giving law enforcement new and astounding
      advantages in this high stakes game of cat and mouse.

      Bugs, Bones & Botany: The Science of Crime is produced and directed by
      Daniel and Donna Zuckerbrot of Reel Time Images.
