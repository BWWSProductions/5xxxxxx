PrisM Notes::::::::::::::::::

right new stuff in 2010 you should know about...prism consisted of
5 people, perhit, unf, sickone, sammy and slambo.. well now it is only
2 people sickone and slambo...unf will continue, uploading our releases
as he was the one who started the group so still wants it to be nice, so
now this is our 4th release with just me and sickone, so expect more in
the coming future, think what you like but we would like to thanks perhit,
sammy and unf for all the hardwork!

anyway down to the video we used original file from russians thanks!
well it was heavily on the yellow/green side with blue also spent alot
of time fixing it with multiple programs and then final output with xpress
added slight video denoise and slight sharpeness also with contrast and
brightness as its very dark.... overall in my opinion it looks
great but it is your choice whether to take it or not as their is a few
versions out already

credit PrisM & to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone
