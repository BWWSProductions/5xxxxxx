Storyline: A black comedy centered on Paul Barnell, a down on his luck Alaska travel agent who's on the brink of bankruptcy and whose beloved wife, Margaret, is on the brink of insanity. So what's a nice guy with good intentions but bad business sense to do? The answer lies frozen in a dumpster outside of Barnell Great Escapes - a dead body Paul hopes to pass off as his long-lost brother Raymond and then collect on the life insurance. Unfortunately, investigator Ted Watters who's anxious to transfer back to the lower 48 with his girlfriend, isn't about to let Barnell walk away with a million bucks. Adding to Paul's avalanche of problems are two aspiring hit men- turned-kidnappers and the stunning return of the supposedly dead Raymond, who now has an ax to grind with his brother. Desperation is running high in the "big white," and if Paul is smart, he'll blow the snow, take the money and run...to South America.
