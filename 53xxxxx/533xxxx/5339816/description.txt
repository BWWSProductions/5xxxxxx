"I Will Be Here" is a song recorded by TiÃ«sto and Sneaky Sound System with vocals from Sneaky Sound System's Connie Mitchell. Released on July 28, 2009, the song is the first single off the album Kaleidoscope.

The music video for "I Will Be Here" premiered on TiÃ«sto's MySpace on August 7, 2009. TiÃ«sto teamed up with acclaimed Japanese director Muto to create the music video for "I Will Be Here", a collaboration with Sneaky Sound System. It begins with a man working on a single computer in a lab, while the screens begin to display TiÃ«sto and Sneaky Sound System logos. He puts on a single speaker "backpack," hooked up to a "TiÃ«sto" cassette player, and presses play. As the music starts, he begins to walk in a robotic fashion, as the computer screens all flicker and switch to the same logos as he leaves the lab. All the lights around him begin to pulsate he walks by, synchronized with the music, while the blue stripes on his white spacesuit outfit also show different light animations. Exiting through a parking deck, he eventually makes his way through Shibuya, Tokyo, and does one final dance in the middle of the famous intersection in front of the Hachiko exit at Shibuya Station, before going to the top of a building, where he "powers down" as the music ends.

In the United States, the single became their first number one single for both acts on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart, where it reached that peak in its November 21, 2009 issue.
