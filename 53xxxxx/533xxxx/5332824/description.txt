Frenz & Wason Brazoban - Lluvia.mp3

This is an example of a salsa song turned into funk by just adding a new beat to it. The xtra drumsounds(snare,bassdrum,hihat and cymbals)are mixed into the song with the editor Goldwave.
Included is the unedited version of the song,so you can hear which changes have been made.
This way a lot of beatless songs can be modified,in fact that's what i've been doing with artists like Elvis Presley,Andrews Sisters,bluegrass,country and a lot of salsa artists. 


Stay funky!
