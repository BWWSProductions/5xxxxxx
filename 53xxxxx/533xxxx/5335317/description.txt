BBC Radio 2 The Mike Harding Show - Folk Awards 2010


Mike Harding presents highlights of the 2010 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards show from The Brewery in London. The Folk Awards, now in their eleventh year, celebrate the very best in folk, roots and acoustic music from the past twelve months and acknowledge significant contributions through the presentation of Lifetime Achievement Awards.

Nanci Griffith and Dick Gaughan, two artists who have influenced generations of musicians and music fans alike, will be presented with Lifetime Achievement Awards and both will perform in the show. Plus the groundbreaking TV series The Transatlantic Sessions, which has brought together the finest folk and traditional musicians from Scotland, Ireland and North America is to be given the Good Tradition Award for its continuing contribution to folk music.

The Awards show will also feature performances by the 2009 Best Group Lau and by six times nominated singer-songwriter and guitarist Martin Simpson. Irish Singer Cara Dillon will perform a song from her latest album, while Best Live Act nominees The Bad Shepherds and Best Duo nominees Show of Hands will also provide live music.

Guest presenters include musician Richard Hawley, poet Ian McMillan, Kevin Whately and Zoe Wanamaker.
