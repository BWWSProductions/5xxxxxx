This is audio talk by professor Griff from Public Enemy rap group. I got this from the torrent black illuminati that can be found here on concen.

Professor Griff gives a really good talk and is risking his life by getting this information out there.  The highlight of this talk is when he discusses that some high paid rappers offer a ritual sacrifice to get fame.  This might be a girlfriend or mom that gets killed in order for that rapper to get money and fame.  

He also talks about many other topics NWO related.
