Since this torrent is currently stuck on 98,79% it means I can't watch it, at all, because it's rar.

Had it been a normal mkv file, I could've watched it even on my freakin' iPhone where VLC or whatever compensates for the missing kilobytes.

Sharing is caring, but raring is just stupid."

How many torrents have you uploaded? None.
If this torrent bothers you so much, scroll past it you annoying leeching piece of shit. 
This is rar'd for reasons you're too stupid to understand, not to save space."
