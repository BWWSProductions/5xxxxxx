,wrgupta,2010-02-06T06:56Z,"xangel87x, the word ""leech"" come from the parasite known as ""leech."" So ""leechers"" in the gnutella environment are the downloaders or 'suckers"" who are sucking this particular file like you once did (that's if you have already downloaded this file).

So if you haven't yet downloaded this file and in the process of downloading it, then consider yourself as one of those ""leechers"".

""seeders' are those already downloaded this item and are now helping to feed the leechers."
,xangel87x,2010-02-06T07:16Z,wrgu  - is that people who don't seed  they are classified as leechers? 
,Stansa2,2010-02-06T20:05Z,"WOW!! I always seed until the end even if it takes over a week! It is really not helping if u download and stop it, you have to continue to SEED! ALL THE WAY!!"
