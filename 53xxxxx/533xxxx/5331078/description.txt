Windows 7 Professional x86 & x64
Windows 7 Home Premium x86 & x64
Windows 7 Home Basic x86 & x64
Windows 7 Starter x86

Windows Vista Ultimate x86 & x64
Windows Vista Business x86 & x64
Windows Vista Home Premium x86 & x64
Windows Vista Home Basic x86 & x64
Windows Vista Starter x86

Basic Info :
OEM (Certificate & Key) install only where bios already (or modded) contains slic 2.1
Add slic 2.1 to Bootloader (0.97 grldr customised by Zsmin for me) with option (Default,Alternative, Low Memory, Debug, Forceful)
- default option allows auto-detect best method where possible
- alt method relocates SLIC, RSDT, XSDT and RSD PTR to low memory
- low memory method relocates SLIC to low memory
- forceful mode tries to activate on systems where some checks don't complete successfully, may cause problems.
- Debug mode allows view to process behind bootloader.
Install GUID Path (Thanks to PAYMYRENT) failing which install using Mount method.
Add Security to bootloader (Read Access only).
Randomly renamed grubloader (Thanks to PAYMYRENT) failing which allow its user to try normal grldr.
Add slic 2.1 to Bootmgr (No grldr means less time to boot, not recommended).
Certificate install where you want to replace certificate only.
Key install where you want to replace key only.
OEM Slic detection with matching OEM Key if possible. (You can always choose different OEM Key available or own custom key)
Check incorrect custom key.
Detects SLIC version(Thanks to MasterDisaster) and then autoselect best activation mode.
Detects any preinstalled bootloader and removes it when install.

Advantage :
[LIST][*]Fast Install (since based on WMI script).[*]Single file.[*]Much smaller in size (since based on .NET Framework 2.0).[*]Bootloader are randomly renamed and so uninstall of old ldr not necessary.[*]Slic can be added in bootmgr (Not recommended).[*]Cert & Slic option are together for OEM install.[*]Cert can be installed/replaced only.[*]Key can be replaced only.
[*]Option to add your customised OEM info and logo.[*]Option to backup and restore your licence (useful for retail and mak key users).[*]Default start autoselect best activation mode, slic, cert and key.[*]Detects any preinstalled bootloader functional inside.

Change 2.4.2:
* Detects for first time, any preinstalled bootloader functional inside and will overwrite when slic ldr is installed.
* Added Sony Ultimate, Unknown Premium and MSI Starter Key.

Q: 'I download this movie/video, but there's only picture in it, no sounds. Why??'
A: It's because you're missing certain codecs. There's 2 option to this ; 
   
   OPTION 1: Download & install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: 

   http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm
   
   OPTION 2: Download & install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you've downloaded

Q: 'I download a keygen from a user & my AV flagged it as a virus!'
A: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. 

   First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.
   
   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user & check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. 

   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.
   IF YES, most probably it's false positive.

   Well, if you're still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum & report it here: 
   http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29 ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    

Q: 'I can no longer log into my account on TPB. Why is this so?'
A: Most probably you're banned. Don't worry, drop by to the forum & explain it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=3772

Q: 'I registered an account on TPB, but i don't receive any of the confirmation/activation email. Why?'
A: It might be the mail servers are down. Come to the forum, and post it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=50701

Q: 'I don't know how to mount an image file. I don't know this I don't know that. How?'
