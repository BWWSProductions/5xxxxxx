Being the only one to make a comment that actually downloaded it, I think it's a great copy. There was a brief 5-10 second block where video slowed down, but it wasn't an action scene, so it was inconsequential. The only other ""problem"" I could fathom with it was that the brightness seemed a tad too high, which tended to wash out dark scenes. But, it's a colorful movie, so I can see how that could happen.

No worries, at least it wasn't blurry or garbled, or any number of other (actually serious) problems that could have shown up.

Two thumbs up to POCAHONTAS! :D"

I've already seeded 150%, so let's see some others do the same. =P"
