,doubledge,2010-02-04T08:23Z,"BAD FRAMERATE!!! :( :( :( :(

How is it that iMAGINE is the first one up with a DVDScr?

Doesn't seem like they can get anything right!

THANKS TO THE UPLOADER FOR THE EFFORT!
(i expect we'll see a ""PROPER"" up here SOON! )"
,doubledge,2010-02-04T08:32Z,"oh, SMACK!

I forgot to put on my 3D GLASSES to get rid of that annoying FLICKER - LMAO!"
,JPeterson,2010-02-04T08:35Z,How is it technically possible to produce the appearance of a low or uneven framerate? I've never heard of that problem before about any transcoded DVD or Bluray.
,theone_nr,2010-02-04T09:07Z,Indeed this release is REAL but framerate STUTTER !!! Waiting for a PROPER release ! Anyway TNX !
,JPeterson,2010-02-04T09:25Z,"I see the problem now. The framerate is 23.98 as it probably should be. But every fourth frame is a duplicate so there are only 18 unique frames per second. With the result that the video appear to stall for a split second (around 40 ms if you like) every four frames. As an example these frames are duplicates in the sample: 2:3, 6:7, 10:11, 14:15, 18:19, 22:23, 26:27 and so on.

The person who copied this DVD botched it."
,S.45,2010-02-04T09:30Z,"@JPeterson
Is it worth the download still?
Like does it skip real bad or just here and there?"
,Spuddle1,2010-02-04T09:57Z,"stutters due to low frame rate all way through...pixelated too..
best so far tho..thx tvteam"
,JPeterson,2010-02-04T10:00Z,"@S.45
I would guess that it's the same problem throughout the whole movie. But I've only downloaded the sample so far so I don't know for sure."
,jra6969,2010-02-04T10:05Z,"thank you so much.... Now all we need is the movie ""CRAZY HEART"" can anyone tell me if they have a DVDSCR of it? its up for awards. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN "
,STONEDSTONER,2010-02-04T10:11Z,SOMEONE ELSE MAKE A PROPER AVI FROM THE ORIGINAL ISO!!!
,STONEDSTONER,2010-02-04T10:11Z,secret myth!!! where are you
,greenroor,2010-02-04T13:38Z,i just finished downloading and watching the whole sample video i did not notice anything major with the video it looked pretty great to me did not notice any major freezing worked good for me my rating from the sample is 9 out of 10 people are going nuts about the frame rate an freezing but im not seeing it thanks for the great upload
,greenroor,2010-02-04T13:47Z,i am very very picky with my ratting 2 i never watch any cams or ts video only brrip or dvd maybe the the movie itself skips and freezes but i did not notice 1 time in the sample video anything wrong

,gazzler2,2010-02-04T15:59Z,thanks to uploader...but as said before secret myth gets this and we are in......
,JPeterson,2010-02-04T17:40Z,"For the technically interested you can play the movie in 18 fps with this AviSynth/Decomb script:

DirectShowSource(""Avatar DVDScr xvid - IMAGiNE.avi"")
converttoyv12()
AssumeTFF()
Decimate(4)"
,numse,2010-02-04T18:08Z,OMG FAIL
,lilars26,2010-02-05T02:54Z,"They screw up the frame rate and know this is a piece of shit but try to fool you with a pretty good sample.Why?It makes no sense.But instead of waiting for something decent thousands are willing to download this crap.Idiocy!TvTeam even tries to tell you how great it is in the comments.But everyone who watches it tells you it sucks and still you download it.Complete stupidity!People,wait for a good copy to come along and get it from somebody who is above board."
,dardar6t9,2010-02-06T03:53Z,I agree.....HEY IMAGINE!!!! Try Imagining having brains.....If its crap warn ppl or dont put it up you tossers. Jeeeez
