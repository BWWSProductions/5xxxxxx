,Opaso,2010-03-15T20:30Z,Helt otroligt! SĂĽ himla smart! Tack fĂśr denna!!!!
,jorgen213,2010-03-17T11:54Z,"Thanks, works great!
And as ""ocw"", i would also like the HD CD that has H.264 codecs. If anyone could UL it...Thx :)"
,blink32,2010-03-21T00:15Z,FYI I realize the primary comment is regarding WinTV 7 but I used this against the Win TV 6 from Haup (it also requires the source cd) and it does not work for that version.
,ocw,2010-03-29T03:51Z,"Hi blink32.

I'm sorry that it didn't work for u.

Anyway, I have also tested this to work for the current WinTV v 1.3c too."
,sabojo2,2010-05-13T05:11Z,Thanks!! worked with 1.3d
,nesset,2010-05-14T20:34Z,Thanx! Workt great for me :)
,xadious,2010-06-12T03:16Z,"OCW, thank you so much for this Sir!!

I can't believe Hauppauge are so bad and do this to their customers, they're can't just be happy that we bought their device they want us to pay more for old CDs we throw away, blah.

I managed to upgrade to 1.3e with no problem, thank god i came here, i was about to rip my hair out!

Thank you again."
,LoCrux,2010-06-12T12:29Z,"Perfect...

Also works with WinTV7 - 1.3e"
,ocw,2010-06-20T05:38Z,"Thanks for all your support.

Anyway, as I mentioned earlier, if any one of you has the WinTV v7 HD CD-ROM or the WinTV v7.2 with WinTV Extend CD-ROM and would like to generously share it, please upload the ISO file."
[V],phatwarez,2010-06-24T06:34Z,"Wow thanks, you saved me $10."
,ocw,2010-06-28T10:56Z,"phatwarez. I wish to upload the HD version, but I got an error when trying to upload using either IE or Firefox. How can I upload successfully?"
,azztrix,2010-09-14T15:53Z,"Works like a treat on the latest version driver, i think it was 2.1, HD codecs and all! 
Thanks so much man your a legend, had this thing for a while and could never get it to work, till i finally pulled it out of the cupboard blew the dust of and hit you u/l up.

Using :wintv-hvr-1100-lp
Not bad for something I pulled out of a machine sitting on the side of the road! :) :) It always pays to be a sticky beak"
,MPSOWL,2010-09-28T08:34Z,Works for cd 2.2 too. good download
,xadious,2010-10-16T06:44Z,"OCW, any luck with the HD version?

Also any idea whether the HD version would work for the WinTV-NOVA-T-90xxx ? At the moment i get Freeview Digital (United Kingdom), and Freeview have a few HD channels but in the current v7.2 standard they don't even show up.

I emailed Hauppauge ages ago, but they don't bother replying."
,isepiq,2010-10-17T06:07Z,"This one does work for WinTV v6. You have to mount it to a drive letter BEFORE H. It failed for me at first (Mount letter M), but then I changed it to a Mount letter of E & it worked just fine. WinTV 6 compatible with drive letter BEFORE H.

IMHO

,xadious,2010-10-18T02:10Z,"Nevermind about the HD, just realised i can't get HD channels as i have a DVB-T tuner and the UK requires DVB-T2 tuners to get a handful of the free Freeview HD channels."
,Beowulf_1775,2010-11-26T20:20Z,"Thanks, works great."
,apzoeiruty,2011-01-26T20:24Z,"If you got an old card, like my PVR 150, WinTV 6 will probably work better."
,apzoeiruty,2011-01-26T20:26Z,"Thanks !
Monted it on letter BEFORE H.
Installed WinTV v6
Installed 
http://hauppauge.lightpath.net/software/install_cd/wintv6_cd_4.6b.exe
for my old PVR 150.

Worked like a charm !
Thank you releaser !"
,InFamousD147,2011-06-07T00:58Z,"DUDE after 4 adderalls, mad typing / clicking / downloading drivers, 3rd parties, going into dos using pushd, setting signatures, running drivers in other formats, YOU have solved the problem by being cool and seeding out a nice iso. to update from. Mad ups. If I could I would buy u a beer bro!"
,bruce356,2011-08-11T04:36Z,"Thanks verrrrry much ocw.
This works on the latest version (UK version) CD Version 2.4 (wintv7_cd_2.4.exe) downloaded from their web site but I had to burn the image file ""HCW2_5B24111PPH_CONCISE.ISO"" to a CD. I used a CD-RW, try it should work for you to."
,sadalf,2011-10-18T17:26Z,I still cant find any chanels? anybody knoe why!
,zigzaggin,2012-02-26T17:29Z,"26.FEB.2012 - I have a PVR-150 I use to convert VHS to DVD.  I tried 5 other ISO's to use as the original CD required by the upgrade.  I was trying to install WinTV 6 upgrade (wintv6_cd_4.6b.exe)...   THIS LITTLE 240K ISO IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WORKED!   
Thanks Man!"
,p51d007,2012-03-20T03:39Z,"I just flat gave up and went and bought a new usb version that had the cd with it, made an iso of the win7 2.4d disk, burned it to cd and used it to get mine working.  @#(*^%!) the 2.5 version UNINSTALLED the old one, then wouldn't let me update.  I'll take the usb tv tuner back to Best Buy and get my money back LOL."
,damouse1,2012-05-19T20:37Z,"Thanks!
Who keeps CD's around these days..."
