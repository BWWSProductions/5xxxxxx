180 sonatas played by Gilbert Rowland on various harpsichords. A must have for everyone, especially if you like Scarlatti style sonatas. Front and back scans included for each CD. All 13 CD's are in .flac format, separate tracks. Personally I like Rowland's version more than the Bob van Asperen version. But of course van Asperen also created something amazing.



SEED BIGTIME AFTER COMPLETION, PLEASE!
