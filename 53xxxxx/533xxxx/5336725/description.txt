This is a photocollage with pictures from 1 year of Kinemasophico of the NGO AFIN.
KinemasÃ³fico is a project that take every sunday a different cinema to the children so that they can build new perceptions of reality. We are really concerned in the choice of the movies, we don't want the same images they carry. We have choosen many movies this past year specially from Michel Ocelot, Charles Schultz, Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, etc. (they are on the movies)
No words in the movie, only photos and music
