download and install the 0901 discs first.. then 0907.. then 0911 then you can jump to this one..

You should find the relative keys as you search and download em..

,TheTraveller15,2010-02-12T17:55Z,"Hello Guys!

I just downloaded the cycle but I don't know why my computer is this time not able to update. I am using Windows 7 but it has always worked the last 7 times. Can anybody help me?"
,Amerialb,2010-02-22T03:09Z,"For any1 who wants to know, I installed windows 7 32bit extreme version and used this jeppview version http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5261562/FSX_FS2004_-_-jeppesen_Jeppview_3.5
and after installing the 0901 cycles I went straight to cycle 1003 and installed it with poweriso and it installed great with no hang ups. I didn't even need to change my computers date.

Now you need to be patient with windows 7 it has a little glitch in its giddyup but works great. "
