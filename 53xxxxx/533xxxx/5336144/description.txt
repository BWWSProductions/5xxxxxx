+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Mark Dice makes an unscheduled appearance in the 4th hour regarding his appearance on a California TV station's sports report, urging viewers to boycot the Super Bowl and instead spend the time educating themselves about political/economic issues that really affect their lives.



Also, in the final minutes Alex talks with Linda May, R.N..  She is an associate of [guest on yesterday's show] Doug Rokke, who is fighting against the use of depleted uranium.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
