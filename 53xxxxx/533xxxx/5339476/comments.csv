The worker has not capital investment or risk of capital.  Don't be such a fucking moronic Marxist.
The 'capitalist' that you like to bash, has invested huge amounts of money to start a business and deserves to earn lots of money in order to recoup his investment.  You must be young, and therefore, dumb."

,AkaPhsyco,2010-03-01T11:55Z,"Hey MPAA you ever heard of innovation? 

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding. 

Thanks for your time and enjoy your content.
And thanks to all the up loaders like the FXG_team w/out people like them, none of this would be possible!"
,OGBurn,2010-03-02T17:02Z,"I seem to be having a problem on the audio when i convert this to dvd, sounds like the devil talking in a death metal kind of way.Not sure why maybe the CBR, on ati2dvd i think it is set to VBR and 384 not 128 for audio.Normally have no problems with any FXG joints.
Thanks Again FXG_team"

,rc71,2010-03-29T01:55Z,"Thanks to the uploader.

The movie itself is pretty boring.  If it was a documentary it would be considered funny.  As a comedy, it's lame.  "
,border43,2010-03-30T06:32Z,"I am having trouble with this, streaming to my XBox 360. No problems with any other FXG releases, but this one will not stream correctly. Lame."
