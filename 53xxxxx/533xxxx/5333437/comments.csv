  does anyone have the NTSC version?"
,Ecco02,2010-02-20T17:49Z,I added it into Homebrew but it doesen't showup. Someone said I need a .dol or .elf file but I can't see one in the extracted files. Could someone please help me with this...?

Just burn the .iso to a DVD and insert in wii. If you need help installing homebrew channel and applications, check forums on the web."
