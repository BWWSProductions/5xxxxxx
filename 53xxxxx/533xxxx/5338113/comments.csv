I can't even download with 1kb on bitTorrent."
,Blaxcell,2010-02-06T10:21Z,"I've updated to 1.21, then downloaded this.

The instructions do not specify which of the two Borderlands.exe files to replace.

If I replace the one in [install path]\Borderlands, it tells me I have the wrong disc inserted. If I replace the one in Borderlands\Binaries, it tells me there is a runtime error. Replacing both results in a runtime error also."
,mlech,2010-02-06T21:38Z,"The actual 1.21 update is nearly 200 MB, so I'd suggest care in downloading what is likely a fake file"
,JokerTastic,2010-02-07T10:58Z,"It's not fake. It worked for me. Just dl the update strait from the gamespy website or wherever and then replace the ""borderlands.exe"" that's in your Binarie after you've finished updating and your good to go."
,jackz5o,2010-02-09T21:10Z,"this isn't fake, it works great.

This doesn't update the game, you have to update to 1.21 from the borderlands website first and then overwrite the .exe with this."
,ninjapiratez,2010-02-11T13:14Z,"I've renamed the 2 files correctly, put every file in the right folder and uploaded for you guys, pre-cracked with razor 1.21 no-cd

just unrar/extract and play

enjoy"
,Sparx10,2010-02-18T19:50Z,"@mlech: The actual Borderlands update, is a fucking update, not a crack. How about you read the title of the torrent next time before you go and accuse it of being fake.

This works great by the way. Thanks FTL3 :D"
,Reaper24,2010-02-24T21:21Z,"Hey, I have the Reloaded version of Borderlands, so do I need the Reloaded 1.21 patch or can I use the official 1.21 patch and then use this crack?"
