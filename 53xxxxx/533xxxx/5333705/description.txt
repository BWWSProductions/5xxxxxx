           The king of comedy is back with his most outrageous show       
           yet!                                                           
                                                                          
           Filmed live at Jim's court, Cliffs Pavilion, Southend, in      
           front of a mob of faithful squires, and their ladies.          
           King Jim gives the crowd what they want with a show            
           filled with tales of wanton women, pointless wars and her      
           Majesty's troops.
