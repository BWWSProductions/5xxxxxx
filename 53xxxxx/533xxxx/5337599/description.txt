i downloaded german SATRip (or good TVRip) from serienjunkies and took english dub from here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3574633/Capitol_Critters

then i edited english-dub-audiotrack and put it on german SATRips. so now, i think, we have quite good quality picture (much better than that VHSRips of cartoon network and abc) with english dub and without those nostalgic-but-annoying adverts

german SATRips/TVRips are good, but have few gaps and skips in some episodes maybe because of bad ripping or cuts to commercials or bad intOrnets or my bad paws

but i tried to hide those soundbugs, so i hope you won't notice any of em



okay here we go....
