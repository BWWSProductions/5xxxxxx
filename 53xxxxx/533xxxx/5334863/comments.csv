Now I can play ""Lady Madonna"" on the piano!
This file has far better quality than the 66MB torrent!
Let's spread The Beatles' songs all over the world!"
,thebird55,2011-02-27T07:21Z,"I had the hard copy of this book for a couple of years, and I can tell you that it's the absolute, final authority and best source for Beatles sheet music. Anywhere. The description here doesn't do it justice. It has EVERY part. Horns, triangles, etc, it's ALL here. As a heads-up: A few guitar parts are in standard notation. 

If you play music, and like the Beatles, you NEED this. It will make you happy.

And thanks to Trathus1 for this superior version. After my book was stolen, I was having to depend on inferior, hard to read versions.
