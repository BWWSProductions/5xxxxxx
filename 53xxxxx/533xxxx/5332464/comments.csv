,aarque,2010-02-03T17:15Z,"Your point? Is that your way of saying ""thank you?""  You message as if you are speaking for the opposition. Oh wait, how could you be, you still have yet to make your first contribution. "
,Yxin123,2010-02-03T17:21Z,"Already have it, but thx.
Saying that they hope microsoft will fix it seems kind of strange... alot of models suport dx10 preview. Why should microsoft fix a model that CLS created?  ..isnt that a job for CLS?"
,aarque,2010-02-03T18:24Z,"CLS believes it is a weakness in the Microsoft software that only allows certain file types to display DX10. After all, DX10 is ""Direct X,"" a graphics format, not a compiler or application - it should work with any presentable format.

Miucrosoft believes it is being efficient and contemporary. Anyone who does not want to conform to the new protocol is a dinosaur and should get up off their ass and modernize."

,Uncle_Fuzzy,2010-02-04T16:12Z,"What I say is: 
Thank you, aarque!
Whether I want this or not, it is good of you to take the time & trouble to u/l it for those who do.
Pay no attention to snot-nosed critics expressing their boredom. They are no more than pimples on the ass of progress."
