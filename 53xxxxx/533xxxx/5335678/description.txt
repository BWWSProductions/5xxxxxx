
Now fully updated!

Not the complete Morrissey Solo B-Sides, but most if not all of the studio B-Sides as of the end of 2009. Plus rarities and extended players.

Tracks new to this version include the YoR singles and b-sides (some also collected on Swords) and the rare tracks added to the Southpaw reissue (the ones added to the Maladjusted reissue were already in the torrent)

All in all over four and a half hours of music, mostly in a rough facsimile of chronological order. That was the real headache, actually, the sorting and endless renaming of the entire directory whenever I realised that I'd left out Please Help the Cause Against Loneliness or something. The exception, of course, is the last track, which I firmly believe is the only way to end a compilation of this nature.

It'd be nice to see this released as a box set, but since about 200 record companies are involved it probably won't happen. So I've done it instead.

Enjoy and seed for your fellow man.

This is a reupload. In the original 2010 edition, the mp3 files were broken, half of them missing the last fifteen seconds or so, because I had to redownload them and between me and uTorrent it got messed up. I apologise sincerely for the inconvenience.
