thankz eztv............................."
,zushigreg,2010-02-04T13:41Z,"To all downloaders, be careful about reading the comments here. Some people are either trying to spoil the show or are just guessing. But if you happen to read something that looks like a spoiler, just don't think about it much. Maybe it didn't really happen, and characters go and return on LOST anyway . . ."
,CSuk,2010-02-04T17:46Z,"Thanks 4 the ul...
I got really sick of waiting for this series to begin again. I thought it was'nt going to see the light of day. Now its back I'm going to have to complete watching it but, I must say that i'm glad it'll be the last season...due to you know who wanting to go into movies more...as the story is becoming a little strained. IMHO anyway!
I wonder if i'll ever watch this again once i've completed the disc set of these episodes?
See ya next week...same place...different time :)"
