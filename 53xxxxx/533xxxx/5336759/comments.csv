,ricore,2010-02-05T05:15Z,If you download this please leave a quick comment to tell me it worked I'm still a noob and want to confirm that i did it right. Also it makes me feel important.
,annabelle31,2010-02-05T15:47Z,"It might work better if you actually, you know, seeded your torrent. There are a lot of people stuck at 54% at the moment."
,ricore,2010-02-06T00:32Z,Oh sorry i turned my computer off. when i get home i'll seed.
,Lhmar,2010-02-14T04:02Z,"Text is missing chapters 1, 2 and 3. Starts on chapter 4 after de Preface."
,ricore,2010-02-18T20:22Z,"Yeah I realised that. I'm just going to break down and buy the PDF, I'll be uploading that soon.

As I've been reading it I've found lots of errors with punctuation and other weird things too. "
,rd31,2010-03-28T08:02Z,"Hey ricore, when are you uploading the complete version? "
