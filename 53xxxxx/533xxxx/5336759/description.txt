Robert Heinlein's most famous work. Originally published in 1961 and won the Hugo award that year. This original publication was a heavily edited version; from wikipedia- "The resulting edited version was, according to Heinlein, 160,067 words. (He joked about sending in the last 67 to the publisher on a postcard.)" This is the original ~220,000 word unabridged version.

I was trying to find an ebook of this and I was annoyed with how long it took me so I decided to upload another version.

This is my first torrent by the way so PLS SEED LOLOL.
