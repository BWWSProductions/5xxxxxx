A few years ago I put together an up to date (at the time) package of Y: The Last Man as the series neared it's end. Now Brian K. Vaughan's other work Ex Machina is reaching it's final chapters so I'm back. 

This torrent will be up to date until March of 2010 when issue #48 is due out. Issue #49 is out in April of 2010 with no confirmed date for the 50th and final issue.
