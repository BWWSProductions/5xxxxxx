,Sinsults,2011-08-08T02:17Z,Great show.  A few of the episodes near the middle do get out of sync with the sound (I'm using vlc media player with the latest updates) but it's easy to ignore.  Thanks for the upload!
,Brunuub,2011-08-11T11:27Z,"Synch issues are extremely easy to fix using VLC.
Go to tools -> Track Synchronization and change the Audio/video until it's all good."

,Vigilante1134,2011-10-16T04:42Z,to fix the sound (VLC Player) sync right click the screen window and go Interface > Effects and filters > Synchronizaton and put the first one to about 2.50 it fixes it the sound
