,Wsmack,2010-06-28T21:09Z,"There is a way to get games for XP work on Vista, I have found this myself (you will not find any tip about this on the Net) after lots of tweaking (you will not find any tip about this on the Net) and it works for me
Many people say that games work on their Vista while others can't start them. The easiest way(theoreticaly) to fix this is to just copy the Windows folder from Xp and merge it with Vista's and owerwrite everything. This causes a complete crash, so don't do it.(Vista's updating on shutdown, suprisingly, does what it is supposed to do and evades this)
My way is next: Try starting your games and whenever Vista reports a compatibility issue, click on find a solution online. It will tell you(mostly) to download .dll files, which you(it doesn't tell you that) get with XP and not with Vista. This won't solve the problem always, but repeating this with many games should prove rewarding. These are some of the games I did this with and after this I was able to play most of them and others, too:
Biohazard 4
Monster Madness
Prince of Persia The Two Thrones
Jazz Jackrabbit
Heroes of Might and Magic V

Btw, I have Vista Ultimate 64x and as far as I remember, I am sure that R.E. and MM did start working, for others I am not sure."
,raefaybro,2010-07-20T20:25Z,"Eyezin... you are now my favorite uploader.... THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They ALL work and are all great games not only did i think i would never play opposing force or blue shift until now, i didnt know HL: GOTY was different from the original! THANKS

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,BjornW,2010-08-16T16:30Z,"There is a bug on blue shift, when I'm taking the elevator to Sector G the elevator stops and one of the scientists dies and I get fired."
,Caligulardicus,2010-08-22T17:00Z,"When I start up opposing force and half life GOTY it still asks for a CD key, and when I use the ones in the readme they dont work"
,stevemcc,2010-09-27T12:16Z,"All i did was extract half life goty to my desktop.
double clicked set up icon and it installed.(no mounting iso).Easy.

put in code thats in the download....  play.!

if it says u dont have phsical memory.. run in windows xp compatable.(right click half life icon>>properties>>compatable>>run in xp"
,stevemcc,2010-09-27T12:26Z,"i have windows vista 64 by the way.

I havent extacted opposing force or blue shift yet.(u can do each one individually)

it took me about half hour to download and 2 mins to install.

if your screen is to small adjust it in the video options in game.Brilliant torrent great game thanks.!  "

,mcreed24,2011-01-09T22:46Z,Tried to install Oppoising Force but McAfee TWICE flagged up one of the files as a trojan...deleted...next torrent thank you.
,nenad285,2011-02-04T22:41Z,"McAfee sucks dude, i scanned with Norton and it came clean,how about throwing that garbage away and getting Norton, if McAfee scanned it as a virus, then its a false positive"
,RippedHalo,2011-02-16T01:30Z,"Hey I installed Half-Life and when I try to install Opposing Force, it works for a second but then it says, ""The file Half-Life Opposing Force\OPFOR\\gearbox\DQ2249.ICD could not be opened."" And it stops installing. So I re-downloaded the ISO for OpFor and when I attempted to install it again the same message came up. It comes up each time I try to install. How do I fix this?"
,cyborg5742,2011-04-04T20:49Z,"@--e
do this:
create shortcut for hl.exe,and right click the shortcut u just made,click properties and in the target field at the end of the .exe,press space bar and paste these  -dev -console
the impulse cheat should work..."

Can you take sometime to READ other people's comments about this upload. This file is 100% clean and I think your anti-virus is screwed up, if not maybe your head is screwed up. 

m8.......my ass"
,timthenub,2011-10-25T05:01Z,I'm sick and tired of this I've downloaded 3 different half-lifes! and they all say the 15mg thing and then I run it in compatibility mode and nothing happens it starts the game and stays in a black screen! I have windows vista 32bit and nothings working! Please help!

,9twix,2012-04-25T16:14Z,"@mcreed24
They give McAfee away free for a reason.

Am downloading at the moment, last complete pack like this I tried didn't even have Opposing Force included, only HL and Blue Shift. Don't let me down, eyezin ;)"
,9twix,2012-04-25T16:52Z,"Kind of annoying that you have to install Half Life to install OF and BS even if you have it installed from a seperate torrent, but it makes sense. Torrent works well, CD keys work fine, good torrent."
,texaschainsawmass,2012-05-26T19:59Z,"Do I have to complete first and install the Half Life before i can install the Opposing Force?? because i prioritize the opposing force than half life and blue shift, i'm done with playing Half Life so i jumped it up.. please reply. tnx."
,gordanfreeman,2012-06-05T04:25Z,hell ya good amount of seeders if only every download on TPB was like this one....anyways sometimes when i play i go to a certian part of a lvl then it just kicks me back to screen doesnt happen all the time but it will be in a certian lvl
,fslaker,2012-06-27T03:59Z,"Is everything working fine?
Every game smooth and playable?
I'm gonna test here since I've never played Blue Shift and Opposing Force. In case any issues pop up I'll post here again. Thanks eyezin :D"
,fslaker,2012-06-29T22:12Z,"everything working fine but what about the high definition pack for blueshift? I don't see any differences, the gun and models seems the same :|"
