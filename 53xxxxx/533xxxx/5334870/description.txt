Tyrian.2000.PC.Game(djDEVASTATEâ„¢)


Tyrian was an absolutely fantastic blaster back in the days of VGA graphics
and two-button joysticks, giving gamers a much-needed dose of arcade style
vertically scrolling shooting. It still plays well even to this day but it's
good to see that it's been given a new lease of life in this fast paced sequel.
Basically this is more of the same - while that's a kiss of death cliche for
many sequels, in Tyrian's case it's a blessing. 
All you need to worry about is turning the lights off, the sound up
and getting your name up on the high score table. 
Opening up the basic arcade formula is the full game, which lets you buy weapon,
shield and armor upgrades from money earned during each level.
This is considerably harder than the standard game but lets you have greater
firepower and defense systems later on - stock up on multiple side arms and
secondary weapons and you've got yourself a space-faring death machine.
The way the screen is filled with enemies, explosions and powerups is
awfully pretty and at times a bit psychedelic - in other words,
it looks the part of a classic blaster.
A slightly dated but thoroughly playable shoot 'em up.
