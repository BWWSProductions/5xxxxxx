Thanks a lot. Please, if Stranded and You're The Voice will appear at your frontdoor someday, upload them also ) These are the only videos left -  and after finding them in good quality I can finally re-author Heart's ""Video Anthology"" DVD to make it in real quality instead of demo version existing now ))"
