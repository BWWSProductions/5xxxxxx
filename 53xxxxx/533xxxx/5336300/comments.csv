,KING_XXX_Rated,2010-02-05T00:53Z,I stay in the US. Will I be able to play PAL games on my banned XBOX 360 console?
,pihkal1412,2010-02-05T01:00Z,No you need a PAL system or a chipped console not a firmware console.
,KING_XXX_Rated,2010-02-05T01:24Z,ok thanks
,KING_XXX_Rated,2010-02-05T01:29Z,By the way can you please get a RF or NSTU version of this!!!

,Strikefear13,2010-02-05T11:03Z,"If you don't own a pal console, don't bother downloading this.  As said before, this is NOT region free.  Anxiously awaiting an ntsc release :D"
