van Canto is an a cappella metal band from Germany, founded in 2006. It is composed of five singers and a drummer. van Canto fuses a cappella (non-instrumental vocal music) with heavy/speed metal, creating what they call "a capella metal". While only two of the five singers perform the lead vocals, the other three will instead use their voices to imitate the guitars and the bass, with the help of amplifiers, in attempt to sound closer to the original instruments.


A Storm to Come is the debut album of German a cappella metal band van Canto, released in 2006. The album cover's artwork was provided by Mattias Noren.
The song "The Mission" was released as a single with a music video; the band, however, received more attention with their cover of the Metallica song "Battery."
