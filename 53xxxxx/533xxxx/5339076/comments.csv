,karavali,2010-02-06T06:14Z,Please upload AVATAR.. We want it from you.
,MetallicDivision,2010-02-06T08:19Z,"peeps PLEASE quit asking for Avatar. When its available HR will upload it! If you haven't noticed HR only ups high quality blueray rips NO screeners, workprints, r5's etc...

So when avatar is set to be released on blueray you will get an upload from HR. my guess at the very least a month or 2 away."
,Yurn2,2010-02-09T01:07Z,"Heh, I'd say the Bluray is more like 4 months away."
