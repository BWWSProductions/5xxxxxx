I am uploading only Scene releases."
,mufuti9,2010-02-05T06:03Z,"thanks, have been waiting for this a while. will seed a while now ;)

and also thank you for uploading scene releases. Yes, rar format has some issues  like disk additional disk space (if you continue seeding) and not taking advantage of bittorrent technology to its fullest but it is alwas a good feeling to know you are getting a proper and legit scene release."
