By Stephen Pletko review:
This documentary shares the decades of scientific research that has been found about dolphins, specifically Bottlenose dolphins. There is revealing information given with respect to such things as their brainpower, society, evolution, communication, mating, temperament, and even politics. 

Throughout this documentary we follow researchers as they observe and study dolphins in their natural environments. Brief commentary is provided by researchers, anthropologists, zoologists, etc. Locations of study are Shark Bay off of Australia's western coast and Sarasota Bay, Florida. 

Narration is provided by actor Stacy Keach. 

The title of each scene is as follows: 

(1) Introduction 
(2) How much are they like us? 
(3) Capture and release (of dolphins for scientific study) 
(4) Small communities 
(5) Synchronous behavior 
(6) Understanding alliances (with other dolphin communities) 

Finally, the DVD is perfect in picture and sound quality. There are no extras. 

In conclusion, if you've ever wanted to see and learn about the secret world of dolphins then this is the definitive documentary to get!!
