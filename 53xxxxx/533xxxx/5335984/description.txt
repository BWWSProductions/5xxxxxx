Solo adventures of Man-Bat, aka Dr. Kirk Langstrom a supervillain and sometime ally of Batman.

Dr. Kirk Langstrom, a scientist specializing in the study of bats, develops an extract intended to give humans a bat's sonar sense and tests the formula on himself because he is becoming deaf. While it works, it has a horrible side effect: it transforms him into a hideous man-sized bat.

Also included is the Elseworlds mini-series Batman: Manbat.
