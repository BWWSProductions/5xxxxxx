From back cover:

Set ten years after Harry â€œRabbitâ€ Angstromâ€™s death, RABBIT REMEMBERED returns listeners to the small Pennsylvania town where Harryâ€™s widow, Janice, and his son, Nelson, still reside. They are faced with a surprise when Annabelle, Harryâ€™s 39-year-old illegitimate daughter, arrives on the scene, bringing with her ghosts from the past.
