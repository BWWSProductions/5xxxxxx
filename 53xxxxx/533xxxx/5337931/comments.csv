,jjjjosh,2010-02-23T20:31Z,"Sorry if this is a stupid question, but where is the Boot CD?  I have it installed and working fine, but it tells me that I should insert the ""Start CD"" in order to boot to the CD and restore the system drive.  Does the download come with a CD ISO, or is there a tool to create the boot CD, or is it created when you ""Burn your images to disk""?  "
