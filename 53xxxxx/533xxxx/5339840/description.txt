[Q-CLONE 006] Blackmore's Night: Castles & Dreams (2005) *RARE NTSC VERSION* UNCOMPRESSED + HI-RES ART


Not only is Ritchie Blackmore one of the technically most accomplished guitarists in the world, he is also one of the most exceptional and uncompromising musicians. Following his extremely successful years with Deep Purple and Rainbow, he left all commercial considerations aside, founding Blackmore's Night with his partner Candice Night and devoting himself single-mindedly to his greatest passion, the music of the Middle Ages.

Since then the renaissance-infused magic of Blackmore's Night has captured the hearts and minds of fans and media around the globe. With such successful albums as Fires At Midnight, Ghost of a Rose, and Beyond The Sunset: The Romantic Collection now behind them and etched into history, the band is proud to present the brand new DVD, Castles & Dreams. This exciting visual project takes you to a beautifully filmed concert in a German castle and also contains numerous television performances, video clips, interviews and much more!
