,newmouse,2010-02-06T22:42Z,"Its good :)
Sound English with a Spanish Subtitle srt file included. 
V:8 A:9 near DVD quality .
Remember this is a 2 hour 35 min 
Film in 800 MB filesize . the action is smooth 
but the image definition can't be as good as say one of the 1.3 GB Torrents. @@@"

And for those who want marks out of Ten. For a ""COPY"" A/V 10/10"
