[color=Green][b]On January 31, The Mail on Sunday brings you a another fantastic FREE CD by the
musical phenomenon The Soldiers - and the chance to help wounded servicemen
through the magnificent charity Help for Heroes.

You'll find The Soldiers Love Songs CD, featuring 12 classic tracks, free inside The Mail
on Sunday on January 31. And for every copy sold, The Mail on Sunday will donate 5p to
Help For Heroes.

As we expect to sell more than two million copies, your donation will be substantial.

Good cause: Founded in October 2007, this exceptional charity has helped thousands of
wounded service men and women returning from Afghanistan and Iraq

The Soldiers are Sergeant Major Gary Chilton, Sergeant Richie Maddocks and Lance
Corporal Ryan Idzi, all serving soldiers who have seen action in Iraq and Afghanistan.

L/Cpl Idzi, 24, shot to prominence on X Factor in 2007, where he successfully made it
through to the boot camp stages. From Caerphilly, South Wales, he is a member of The
Queen's Dragoon Guards.

Both 41-year-old Sgt-Major Chilton, from Andover, Hants, and 37-year-old Sgt Maddocks,
from Oldham, are members of the Corps of Army Music and veterans of the 1991 Gulf
War, where they served as medical assistants ferrying casualties to field hospitals.

The Soldiers' debut album, Coming Home, was released in October and reached No4 in
the charts, selling more than 300,000 copies and raising vital funds for military charities.
They performed at the Festival Of Remembrance at London's Royal Albert Hall in
November, and will be embarking on their first UK tour later this year.

Their new Love Songs CD has been recorded especially for The Mail on Sunday and
Help for Heroes.

Released in time for Valentine's Day, it features beautiful interpretations of 12 romantic
classics including Three Times A Lady, When I Need You, Hero and Fields Of Gold.

Help for Heroes does superb work for the extraordinary servicemen and women injured in
the line of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The charity aims to create a series of recovery houses across the UK to help the
wounded return to civilian life.

There could not be a better cause â€“ nor a better album. Get The Soldiers Love Songs CD
free inside next week's Mail on Sunday, and help our heroes...[/b][/color]
