--==About==--
This program will automatically add your desired urls to the site Astunn.com ever 2 minutes. Minimize sit back, relax, and watch the clicks/money roll in.

Astunn has yet to prove itself as a paying site, although the traffic and clicks generated from it is remarkable. Even if Astunn ends up being a scam the revenue generated through it from other sites is more than fair.

--==Setup==--
1. Enter the desired titles, and urls into the corresponding boxes.
2. Save them if you wish.
3. Enter your login details, email/password.
4. Save them also if you wish.
5. Use pop-up killer add-on if you wish (recommended)
6. Run Stun.exe

**LINK NOTE**
Using linkbucks, Adfly, and Linkbee links is a decent source of income. If you are not a member of any of these sites, run the program and you will be given the option to register at the beginning.


--==Disclaimer==--
Use this program at your own risk, I will not be held responsible for anything. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions you can direct them to me on the forums.
