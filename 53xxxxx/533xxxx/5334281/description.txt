Hour 1:

The coming war with Iran.
Obama freezes domestic spending, but war spending continues to be pumped out as we GIVE tens of billions of dollars worth of weapons to countries like Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Quatar, Bharain and Saudi Arabia.
Spending for Americans is frozen, but funding for Israel continues to flow.  By freezing domestic spending and not touching these other things the US is being put on a de facto war footing.

[money quote]:
"I am offended and ashamed that the US government is going to go start a war with another of Israel's enemies to the impoverishment of the United States of America and our people, to the destruction of our moral standing in the world.  And, it's a war that we're at least going to get mired in, and if Russia and China come it it's going to be a World War and we're going to lose it!"


Hour 2:

An update on the April 15th "tax strike"

The horrors [for "them" and "us"] created by US military use of depleted uranium munitions;
US government preparing to revise 2009 unemployment numbers significantly upward -- they'll sell it as a simple calculation error;
states' revenues continue to decline.  Their response: we'll have to take more and more services away from the people;
the IRS is stocking up on short-barreled shotguns; 
and much more news.



Mike manages to present powerful, persuasive stuff without screaming and yelling.
Please give his show a listen.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.

================================================================

Mike Rivero launched What Really Happened [initially called Rancho Runamukka] as a subpage on his business web site in 1993 asking pointed questions about the death of White House Deputy Council Vincent Foster.
As more and more investigations revealed more government deceptions, the project grew in size and eventually moved to its own domain [whatreallyhappened.com] where it resides today.
His WRH website is among the top ten ranked daily political news sites on the Internet, with a global readership in the millions.  What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.
Rivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening.
