So please seed for everyone else."
,angtao,2010-02-14T20:32Z,"Hello johns79,

Thank you so much for uploading the first season of Lost with greek subtitles. I have downloaded it but my computer reads the subtitles in funny lettering. Do you know how I can fix this? I have downloaded other movies with greek subtitles before and some of them work and some do not. Do you know why?"
,johns79,2010-02-15T17:39Z,"Hello to you to angtao.

I think that i do know what is happening.
But in order to be sure that i can help you i need to know what kind of operating system you use.
If you use windows xp or vista you will find the setting responsible for not reading the subs correct, in the regional and language within control panel.
You have to set the non-unicode language to greek. 
Check this out first and if you don't know how to do it or you have any more problems then we have to find a way for us to talk through it.
Please let me know if you solved it."
,angtao,2010-02-15T22:07Z,"Hi johns79,

Thank you so much for the information. I just tried it and it now works. I can see the greek subtitles now. I was wondering if you had any other movies to put up. I am looking for 2 movies in particular. I am looking for The Count Of Monte Cristo and Shawshank Redemption. It is very hard to find these on the internet with greek subtitles. Do you know how I can get these movies with greek subtitles?"
,johns79,2010-02-16T02:34Z,"Hello again angtao.

I've just uploaded The Shawshank redemption which i have, but i don't have The count of Montecristo.
Now, i know that you can find it with greek subs elsewhere but i can't post to a site, about another site, right? Just, have a last look and if you don't find it then i'll see what i can do. In the end, i might find and upload it for you.
I've also uploaded, if you're interested in it, Lost season 2 with greek subs a few days ago."
,angtao,2010-02-16T07:21Z,"Hi johns79,

Thanks for getting back to me so fast. I have tried to find The Count Of Monte Cristo as a torrent file with greek subtitles online and I am having no luck.
I wonder if we can chat privatley sometime about movies. Do you have an e-mail address that I can e-mail you at? One that you don't mind putting online?"
,johns79,2010-02-16T18:09Z,"Good afternoon angtao.

I've just created a new account in gmail for cases like this. The address is: johnnyman79@gmail.com
So, my friend you can ask me anything you want over there and i will help you if i can.

This is also for anyone that might want to ask anything."
