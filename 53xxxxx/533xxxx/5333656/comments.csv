PROTOCOLX  great work 
I'm really very surprised to have already tried many things but this is really so much more.

I have a question about graphic resolution as I can reach higher than 1024 * 768th
Graphics Card Nvidia GeForce 8400 gs 256 ram.
with DSTD patcher I have already tried but did not help the resolution is simply too small.

many thanks"
,PROTOCOLX,2010-02-08T15:23Z,"Simple instruction:

1. Go to the 'Hackintosh Tools' folder on root..
2. Go to Snow Drivers/Video Drivers/Removed  Videokexts.. 
3. Unzip RemovedGraphicsKexts.zip 
4. Drag all kext files into Kexthelper B7 (OSx86tools folder) password.. reboot
5. Remove framebufferdisabler.kext from 'Extra' 'extensions' folder. reboot.
6. copy com.Apple.Boot.plist from 'Removed Video Kexts' folder to 'Extra' folder.. (Remove the old one) reboot
7. No Resolution change? You should edit the new com.Apple.Boot.plist 
8. Open com.Apple.Boot.plist with textedit and change the following value

GraphicsEnabler
	y
	PciRoot
	1

I try my level of English through the underside ... ""make intelligible""

I finally made it almost at the moment with a resolution of (1152 * 720)
I tried with Efistudio and entered into bootplist black display no way.
Then I tried again with the original form of the first solution from you, and it worked.

now my question, I dare not change the resolution to say that I have of course tried few times already ...

Can someone please tell me how can I create an image of the current system so that I can easily restore later) at the wrong angle adjustment, or (kernel panics as before.
best of all I would like to have a bootable image as the original iPortable Snow OSx86 image 10.6.2 Bootable USB,,, is it possible?"
,hauptoon,2010-02-09T10:56Z,"I'm really interested with the system really works as a flower order is possible ..

I am with Ikatos 7 and updates from iDeneb 10.5.8, it runs really stable and it can perform many functions there without immediately making silly.
Especially for audio applications.

Well sure, I have also surfed a whole month amok, had then also quite noll idea about the mac.

Can you tell me whether the (64-bit can be used) without any problems with the graphics and kernel panics caused.

I have previously tried with 64bit and it was no problem, it was only when I changed the resolution of the graphics card not working any more.

But then the solution is very simple you just have not (yet com.apple.boot.plist)

bring on the original state. it is best to secure the original (com.apple.boot.plist) to a different drive or USB stick."
,PROTOCOLX,2010-02-09T12:48Z,"64bit can't be used without any issues... 

Fact is that most real Apple system are running 32bits.... It can work... But you must know sure that the .kexts that you're using are 64bit compatible, otherwise you will get Kernel Panic!

You can also force resolution with typing in Chameleon bootmenu:

""Graphics Mode""=""1280x1024x32"" -v"

With Efi studiu've already got under mac osx 10.5.8 then tries to change the entries in the (com.apple.boot.plist) so I can only under safe mode-x to the system clean and there can be no resolution to change more .
Perhaps you have other suggestions.

The EfiStudio in 10.5 with the following've made, called Efistudio from the snow Iportable drive under 10.5.8 then Nvidia geforce 8400 selected device will write to add com.apple.boot.plist.

And Thanks for Copycatx exactly something I wanted so I can create by other OSX Image.

,hauptoon,2010-02-24T18:29Z,"Hey Proto
Finally I have the right resolution and then goes.
You may want to try generating an EFI string using OsX86Tools. You will see the option in the software to create a new string, allowing the ability to create your own custom video card, and not use on of the ones already generated. It gives you the option to enter the resolution you want. I was able to generate an EFI string to make my resolution go to 1680x1050x32@60hz. Find out what the limits are on your card, such as resolution and refresh rate.

I know there is a tutorial on how to do this, step by step, if I find it, I will post a link on here. But try it yourself first.

Basically:

Open OsX86Tools
Create new EFI String
I believe there is an option for video output
Enter the name of your card in, or choose a preexisting one if your card is listed.
Enter the resolution you want the EFI string to have, then there is a button to have it placed within your system, i can't remember the name of it.

Restart your computer... again sorry these are vague instructions...

I want to thank you for the great job you did with iportable. A very fast and easy way to install successful snow leopard on pc.

in system profiler the video card its recognized with 256mb vram memory, but when i try to install final cut studio 3, the installer says I have 0 mb vram (really the video cards has 512mb), it also says I have no quartz extreme. I tried to disability system requirement checker, but final cut crashes soon after during opening.

What can I do?
