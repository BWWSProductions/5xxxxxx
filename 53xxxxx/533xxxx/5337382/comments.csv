,HR-PiZ,2010-02-14T16:02Z,"the file is fine if you have a way to change the aspect ratio while viewing (e.g., VLC or DivX player) or you'll re-encode. resolution not bad, and the screener warning text isn't on screen most of the time. if you can't tell or don't care when images are a drastically wrong aspect ratio, you'll be okay. maybe there's a viewer it magically corrects itself in, but not the three i tried."
,Usermane,2010-02-15T17:46Z,No thanks! I'll just wait for HR's upload! :>
