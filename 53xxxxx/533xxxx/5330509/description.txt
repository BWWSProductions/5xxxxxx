Shaun Brumder (Colin Hanks) is a local surfer kid from Orange County, California who, after the death of his best friend Lonny (Brett Harrison), becomes disillusioned with his life and looks for another path. He stumbles upon a book titled "Straight Jacket", and decides to become an author. He dreams of going to Stanford University to study with the book's author, Marcus Skinner, and to get away from his dysfunctional household. When his application is rejected after his dim-witted guidance counselor (Lily Tomlin) sends in the wrong transcript, Shaun goes to great lengths to get into Stanford by any means possible, with a little help from his girlfriend Ashley (Schuyler Fisk) and his drugged-out older brother Lance (Jack Black).
