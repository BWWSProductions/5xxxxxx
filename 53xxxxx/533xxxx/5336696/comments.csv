,SybAGReY,2010-02-05T06:57Z,"This is obviously the version I've been waiting for so thanks to raymond for uploading.
However, I can't help but notice that this went live just a few hours ago and there isn't a single seed online?

I'm not 100% sure what the publicly-accepted standard is but I thought it was to at least seed the download for a little while before leaving it to the rest of us. Looking at the download, there appears to be parts missing so it'd be nice if you seeded again. ;)"
,dr.zody,2010-02-05T09:27Z,is it a 10/10 like sherlock holmes dvdscr or its a cam or ts
,theone_nr,2010-02-05T09:55Z,"This is the ONLY REAL (no glitches,no fuzzy, no stutter,no dupeframe) who deserve downloaded !!! TNX !!! GREAT JOB VISION !!!"

,tmars080,2010-02-05T12:30Z,"As always, outstanding work! Many Thanks.  At the risk of sounding silly, can anyone tell me how to burn the english subs and the torrent  to the dvd at the same time?"
,Leigh36295,2010-02-05T12:42Z,Just watched the Sample and the quality is perfect. But it's not connecting to seeds on the actual download. Please seed people so we can all start downloading quicker. I'm currently getting 30kb/s.
,Robo88,2010-02-05T14:06Z,"V - 9

,Spuddle1,2010-02-05T15:58Z,Oh..ok..not mad then ;-D
,wilywondr,2010-02-05T16:27Z,"Just wondering why people repost the same torrent that has been posted on here already?

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5336460/AVATAR.2009.DVDSCR.XviD.AC3-ViSiON-[tracker.BTARENA.org] was posted 2.5 hours before this.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5336503/Avatar_2009_DVDSCR_XviD_AC3-ViSiON   was posted 2 hours before this.

Splitting the seeders up via 3 different torrents for the same movie is a waste IMO."
,heavydiamond,2010-02-05T17:22Z,"tmars080/
dump everything into tmpenc authoring works 4
if u have srt files dump it in as well accepts dvix avi mkv vobs u name it "
,panosol,2010-02-05T19:33Z,to slow....
,dtreano1,2010-02-05T20:03Z,"ok people i've just completed downloading this and i will continue to seed all night to help others ;-)

This is definately the one you all need to download, no jerking etc...

Video/sound would rate at a 8-9 and despite what others have said the sound is NOT poor (buy some decent speakers lol)

Also i can confirm that the subtitles are encoded into the film so thats good news.

Personally i think this is the best one to get and i'm really looking forward to watching this tonight. 

Don't hesitate this is the one we have all been waiting for and thanks for this upload."
,CBCS,2010-02-05T20:16Z,"Finally a decent movie to view. Would say its teh best I have seen so far.
Thanks to the uploader !

CBCS"
,texasknight,2010-02-05T21:01Z,this is the best one yet and finally the subs are in ENG and not hardcoded   
,NewfieJason,2010-02-05T22:49Z,Seed you maggots!!!
,NewfieJason,2010-02-05T22:50Z,Death to spammers!!!
,MuzicRokr,2010-02-05T23:16Z,"A/V 9/9 The quality is great, slight washout but barely noticeable. Sound is fine. Where Neytiri shows him her flying mount some video frames skip but the sound is fine and this is the only occurence and does not affect story-telling. I am being extremely picky and the only thing that would beat this quality is the theatre or buying the Blu-Ray. Greatly appreciate this upload raymondhome. BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! truly."
,NightF0x,2010-02-06T18:57Z,"The AVATAR DVD Screener torrent linked below has by far the best quality sound and picture: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5336460/AVATAR.2009.DVDSCR.XviD.AC3-ViSiON-[tracker.BTARENA.org]

No skipping as many others uploads have had. If you don't want to waste your time with a possible shitty 2GB download - go download this one.

 Don't forget to seed!"
,n1ck1216,2010-02-07T04:05Z,Just get greatmagician copy or wait for secretmyth copy which I will be doing
,hauntnut,2010-02-07T18:38Z,"The video is terrific quality, although the aspect ratio is 1.85:1, not the 2.35:1 that the movie was presented in theatrically. Odd, but not terribly distracting. 

The audio is Dolby 2.0 Surround 192KB 48KHz, and has a tendency to be very front-heavy, even when using a good receiver with equalizer capabilities. The center channel especially will sound very loud, and drowns out the other channels much of the time.

Overall, this will work just fine until the official BluRay release."
