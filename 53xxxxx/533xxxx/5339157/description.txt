The latest stable kernel 2.6.32.7

When I use a torrent I always just set my client to seed to a 3:1 ratio.  Why not.  It doesn't cost you anything.  Its always funny watching stingy people be stingy over something that has no value.

I would like all of my seeders to reach a 3:1 ratio or a seed time of a week.  Which ever is less time or less upload.

Enjoy.  I have an up speed greater than kernel.org's up speed.  This should be the way it's done.

Thanks for downloading.
