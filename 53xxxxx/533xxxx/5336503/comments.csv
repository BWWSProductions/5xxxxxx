,Ocus,2010-02-05T05:08Z,"nice quality, thx man."
,michaelrwatson,2010-02-05T06:06Z,"Damn. All that info up above on bitrate and codecs and qpel and 100 other things, and NOTHING about SUBS which is really important since this has several sequences where they're speakin Avatarian. 

SO DOES THIS HAVE THE HARDCODED SUBS?? "
,jra6969,2010-02-05T06:15Z,"I watched it an i loved it. THANKS.... Can anyone tell me if the movie "" CRAZY HEART "" will be on here soon? Or maybe any web-sites i can look an see? If anyone would help i'd appreciate it. Once again Thank you, V-8 A-9 M-10"

,SteXDudE,2010-02-05T12:32Z,Its good torrent keep on seeding
,surper,2010-02-05T12:52Z,"1 thing I want to clarify

in the info its say Running Time: 2H 36 M

But on IMDB & WIKIPEDIA its says 162 min (2H 42M). Where is the rest of 6 Minutes?"
,gary001,2010-02-05T13:02Z,very good
,jcala69,2010-02-05T14:18Z,i agree with teddydog. thanks to all who provide ratings and helpful comments.
,raiden395,2010-02-05T15:20Z,"@surper: Perhaps they cut the credits out, or some extra footage that was only available in the theater.  Either way, if you don't notice it, don't worry.  With a film as big as this, there are bound to be at least one or two other special versions."
,jnrbutts,2010-02-05T16:38Z,thank you for this one up-loader
,FlankerB1,2010-02-05T18:26Z,"@surper
Do you really need full end credits?
Noir's version is also 2h36m + some seconds long and the only thing that's missing are end credits. 162 min is the complete movie.

@anyone
Noir's version was glitchy at around 1 hour into the movie. Does this version have the same glitch?"
,Snoopy2008,2010-02-05T19:15Z,"Read the NFO file. 

It says:

[V],Kuthumi,2010-02-05T19:40Z,"Thank you again. Great quality. This single file is too big for most standalone players. If you don't have other tools to split it in two, use this one:

,bigrich2007,2010-02-05T19:55Z,Thanks a bunch 4 the GR8T upload!
,dtreano1,2010-02-05T20:15Z,"ok people i've just completed downloading this and i will continue to seed all night to help others ;-)

This is definately the one you all need to download, no jerking etc...

Video/sound would rate at a 8-9 and despite what others have said the sound is NOT poor (buy some decent speakers lol)

Also i can confirm that the subtitles are encoded into the film so thats good news.

Personally i think this is the best one to get and i'm really looking forward to watching this tonight. 

Don't hesitate this is the one we have all been waiting for and thanks for this upload."
,bluenose11,2010-02-05T21:19Z,only 5 seeding some people really take the piss

,koka3,2010-02-06T01:00Z,"Thanks, have not watched it all yet but on preview it's at least 8/8 maybe 9/9"
[T],jerry7_57,2010-02-06T01:41Z,"Not bad at all, Thanks!!!!"
,sybilfault,2010-02-06T06:57Z,"while I'm sure this is a bit better than the Cams that have been the only source for a while, I need to give a word of warning to those looking for a pristine screener: you will NOT find it here. I appreciate the effort, but this still leaves much to be desired. 
""no jerking"" says another commenter. 
well, whatever your terminology, a very apparent stutter is clearly evident here--perhaps the same as the other very recently released screeners for Avatar. and I've tried it on diff. systems and diff. players. I had read the ""Vision"" release was the best yet, but I'm pretty disappointed. while I'm criticizing, I may as well also say that the cited video kbps seems far lower than what the info below says.

Overall: A: 6.5 V: 4"
,kennyg33,2010-02-06T09:12Z,Excellent quality - thanks !

,jchpdv9210,2010-02-06T13:29Z,"Just watched this on my Hackintosh laptop. VLC player shows white artifacts around certain objects. at least for me. Quick time (with perian) or Mplayer play it fine and it looks and sounds great.

,sybilfault,2010-02-07T21:49Z,"greenroor, no need for this thread to devolve to the juvenile like so many others on TPB. I watch my dls on a big screen, so perhaps it jumps out more there . . . but if you look w/ discerning eyes you can even see the hiccups on a regular monitor. Yes, it is a slight and intermittent stutter, but it is evident and persistent through almost the whole film. I know there are quite a few ""purists"" out there, so I wanted to give warning here.

I'm also trying another far lower seeded but better recommended dvdscr of avatar, so I'll see if that one is any improvement."
,AusMakka,2010-02-08T02:32Z,Very watchable. Thanks for getting this up. I have a question about the subtitles (not the Na'Vi subs). What freekin' language is it and can it be removed at all?

,CaptainPicard,2010-03-06T23:12Z,"@kamellonier

Why don't you and all your lame ass buddies shove your recommended sites where the sun don't shine.

Every stinking one of you recommends a site where it can be watched for free and every single one is site set up to spam a person to death by making you give your personal info, email and take a stupid 10-minute survey before they will even consider letting you get to the site.

To top all that, your link is nothing more than a fucked up re-direction site"
,honunet,2010-03-18T07:57Z,"Can some one please tell me if this will fit on a single DVD? Is it split into two avi files so I can put it on two dvds if not? Failing that... can someone tell me how to either compress  to fit on a dvd OR split the movie in order to place on two separate dvds?  Yes I know I sound like a noob, maybe I am but I would appreciate your kind and gentle help all the same"
