,sman301,2010-02-06T03:35Z,The reason I uploaded this is to put out a release that is small in size with good quality and 1GB is the best i can do so far. Every other release is over 1GB I think and it takes a while to download. Small size = faster downloading relatively thanks to the wonderful h264 format!

[T],MelloYello,2010-02-06T07:04Z,Why is there no seeds.  Shouldnt uploader keep seeding until some people finish?  I would seed if I could but at this rate I wont be done for hours and hours.
