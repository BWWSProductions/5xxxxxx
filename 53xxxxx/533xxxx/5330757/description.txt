Shaking Hands with Death.
One of the world's most popular authors, Sir Terry Pratchett, gives the 34th Richard Dimbleby Lecture from the Royal College of Physicians in London. Sir Terry announced in 2007 that he had been diagnosed with a rare form of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. In his keynote lecture, Shaking Hands with Death, he explores how modern society, confronted with an increasingly older population, many of whom will suffer from incurable illnesses, needs to redefine how it deals with death.
