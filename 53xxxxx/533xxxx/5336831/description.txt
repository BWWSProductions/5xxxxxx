TrkMaker Features

Windows 32-bit application requiring Microsoft NET. Framework 1.1 (free download from Microsoft)  
Starting from GPL or N2003/N2002/N4 create a common database which can then be written to many racing simulator formats or 3DS. All formats written can be read by SimED. In addition. 3DS can be read by many 3D editing applications. 
Object File Formats Supported

Create database from N2003/N2002/N4 .PTF or GPL .TRK Note that PTF and TRK files supplied with the games N2003 and GPL cannot be opened. 
Option to allow creation of track database from scratch. 
Export:- 3DS; PTF (N2003) ; GMT (GTR2, rFactor, GTL, GTR) ; MTS (F1CC,F1-2002) 
Creation of AIW files converting from N2003/GPL .LP files. 
Creation of CAM files for GTR2, rFactor, GTL converting from N2003/GPL .CAM files. 
Database stored in XML format to allow editing using 3rd party applications (e.g. XMLSpy, MS Access etc.) 
Database

Describes track with simple tables. The track's geometry is contained in Section tables which have child tables describing the cross-section and grips of the track surface. 
The structure of the database makes it extremely simple to change the material and textures assigned to surfaces both globally and individually. 
Control of mesh resolution for 3DS, GMT and MTS files. A resolution can be defined for the complete track and then overridden for sections requiring greater or less detail. 
TrkMaker includes a grid based editor or an external application such as XMLSpy can be used to modify the database.
