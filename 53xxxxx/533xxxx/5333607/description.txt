Law & Order: UK is the latest member of the Law & Order franchise, 
one of the most successful brands in American primetime television.
[2] To summarise the premise of Law & Order: UK, its variation on the 
famous Law & Order opening statement is:
â€œ 	In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by 
two separate yet equally important groups. The police who investigate 
crime, and the Crown Prosecutors who prosecute the offenders. These are 
their stories. 	â€

Law & Order: UK is based in London and duplicates the episode format of 
the original series. The first half focuses on the perpetration of a crime 
and the related police investigation typically culminating in an arrest, 
while the second half follows the legal and court proceedings in an effort 
to convict the suspect.[5] The show dwells little on the characters' 
back-stories or social lives, focusing mainly on their lives at work.[6]
