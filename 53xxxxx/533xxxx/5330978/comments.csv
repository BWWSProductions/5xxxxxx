,T0rrentz,2010-02-03T21:17Z,"/laugh  some of you need to stay off the internet and go to school.. maybe stop and look at the red bar under your words and correct them.  I'm sure there is a retard add-on for Firefox that will cover your lack of intelligence.

I'm kind-of surprised you actually figured out how to post.  Maybe if they incorporated a small IQ test before giving out accounts that would solve the problem, sort of like a spell after the phonics test.

I guess it's not your fault that your parents are first cousins."
