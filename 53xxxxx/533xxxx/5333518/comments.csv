Go to FILE>IMPORT and import registry files (BOTH).'

I had sound but the game would freeze. So i did what you said about importing BOTH the files into the registry. and because i imported the no sound one, it made the sound stop working. How do i remove that file from the registry?"

I get as far as successfully mounting the ISO image with Daemon Tools & I click the install button. But I can't/don't know how to get any farther.. please help me out! Many thanks. :) "
