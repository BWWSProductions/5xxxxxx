PrisM Notes::::::::::::::::::

right new stuff in 2010 you should know about...prism consisted of 5 people, perhit, unf, sickone, sammy and slambo.. well now it is only people sickone and slambo...unf will continue, uploading our releases as he was the one who started the group so still wants it to be nice, so now this is our 4th release with just me and sickone, so expect more in the coming future, think what you like but we would like to thanks perhit, sammy and unf for all the hardwork!

first same video freezing in same spots for about 5seconds happens twice in movie! fixed color contrast and video noise done what we can, we not rush to be 1st not best quality dvdscr but better than the TS GrEetz to all our friends out their!

credit PrisM & to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone
