,Zorro26376,2010-03-01T17:53Z,"Don't waste your time it's a cheap imitation of 
""Clive Barker's Undying"".
If you want a real thriller game go and download:
""Clive Barker's Undying"" (the first one).
Although it's from 2001 it has the advantage of a really good graphics with the UnrealEngine 1.
The game will hook you like a good adventure book.
Here are some screenshots:

,TheColdTruth,2010-03-15T07:27Z,"Sorry Zorro, but this game has 7.91 gigs of content, your ""Clive Barker's Undying"" has a whopping 600 mb of content.  I do believe you're comparing apples to oranges.  "
,Zorro26376,2010-03-19T08:58Z,"Well, the warm truth is not to look on the size of the game but rather on the content it has.
Try it and you won't be disappointed.
There are many games today with puffed sizes and 
it doesn't mean they're more addictive then older one's."
