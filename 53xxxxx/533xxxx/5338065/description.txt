GAME NOTES


Set in the late 1980s,  gamers  take  on  the  role  of  a
fearless mountaineer as he climbs into the Himalayas on  a
quest  to  find  his  lost  brother.  As  he  ascends  the
mountain, he encounters an ancient curse: the souls of the
people who died in that region are stuck in limbo,  caught
in the Shadow World. Villagers, pilgrims, mountaineers and
Buddhist monks  dead but not yet reincarnated   are  all
that is  left  on  the  mountain.  Terrible  visions  will
disorient him, and ghosts and demons block his  path.  But
the question remains  is his brother still alive?

Designed exclusively for  Wii,  Cursed  Mountain  features
rich visuals and breathtaking views  set on the  roof  of
the world in the life threatening death zone,  the  entire
game world is visible from every level.
