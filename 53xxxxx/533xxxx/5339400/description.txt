contemporary fado

MÃ­sia has been recording albums that take a modern-day approach to Portugalâ€™s blues for almost fifteen years now, and on this â€” her eighth album â€” she adds elements of bolero and tango to bring some welcome variety to this most stirring of styles.

The songs are based around the usual components of the genre â€” Portugese guitar, bass, acoustic guitar and occasional piano â€” with the odd violin and viola flourish added for extra effect. MÃ­sia has a deeper, more sensual vocal style than her more celebrated counterpart, bringing an intimacy to a very personal set of songs, one that is both a tribute to her mother and a reflection of her own melancholy concerns about love and loss.

Drama Box takes us on something of a musical journey
