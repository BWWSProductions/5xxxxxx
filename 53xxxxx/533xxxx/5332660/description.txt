The Colonists & the Missionaries â€“ Hand in Glove:


There were three previous uploads that discussed colonialism and the atrocities (sins) committed by the colonists on native people. It is not a secret that one main objective of the Christian European colonizing powers was to spread Christianity and convert the Heathen. The missionaries were always at the forefront with the colonists. In many cases the colonists are the missionaries or they participated with each other in committing the crime. In other cases the missionaries were guilty of complacency and not trying to prevent these crimes.
