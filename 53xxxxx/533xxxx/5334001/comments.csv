,adventurjunky,2010-02-04T18:57Z,Fake or real anyone?
,jumpingphil,2010-02-05T03:14Z,Loads of Russian speakers on here.
,jumpingphil,2010-02-05T04:32Z,"This episode is called ""Moving the chains"".
It is the same as S06E12 Moving the chains except this one is in Russian.
If you are English speaking, don't bother getting this one.
I don't know who determines the episode numbering, but there is clearly a mismatch here."
,p.shang,2010-02-05T22:12Z,"FAKE FAKE FAKE
 its episode 12 in Russian"
,blackdwagon,2010-02-06T02:55Z,DONT DOWNLOAD - Its episode 12 but in russian so dont waste ur time. 
,jumpingphil,2010-02-06T04:08Z,"@ p.shang...............It is not fake.
It is exactly what it says it is except he got the numbering out by one.
If you read all the description he clearly states it is in Russian.

@ fgdhfdhg...............See above.

@ blackdwagon...............I've already said all that.
Surely people don't need to read it more than once do they? Especially as jepebrilo clearly states it is in Russian.

@ jepebrilo...............You seem to be going against everybody elses numbering conventions for this.
That is probably not a bad thing as it makes your Russian one stand out as some people are clearly incapable of reading.
I think you are doing a good job for the Russian speakers out there."
,jumpingphil,2010-02-06T04:29Z,"@ jepebrilo...............I have just had a look at the fox / house web site and I have to agree with your numbering of this.
It seems that everybody else has got it wrong.
:-)"
,einaripa,2010-02-06T21:20Z,"Episode 12 and dubbed in russian, jepebrilo u motherfucker"
,selector99,2010-02-06T22:20Z,"It's NOT FAKE>

Quite right, jumpingphil!

jepebrilo has it right and everybody else has got it wrong. jepebrilo's not only declared the title Moving the Chains AND declared the spoken language as Russian but ALSO matched Fox's own numbering convention.

Next Episode 14 out on Monday 8 Feb; Titled 5 to 9"
,stevell,2010-02-07T06:45Z,Fukking idot isn't out yet(no shit)
,1988gott,2010-02-07T07:09Z,"That's 12 episode.
Why is this faker still not banned?"
,selector99,2010-02-07T13:38Z,jepebrilo's even been so kind as to include a link to Fox's own episode guide in the upload details. Anyone who still has a problem should click on the link above and complain to Fox telling them that what they describe as 13 is actually 12 - that's my advice.
,xNZx,2010-02-08T04:16Z,"Because he's not faking.

An error does not condemn him."
,xNZx,2010-02-08T04:21Z,"By the way, according to Fox this IS S06E13 because the double episode that we all downloaded as S06E01 is actually E01E02 according to them.

Numbering convention got lost when people didn't upload it as a double E01E02."
,Lataaja105,2010-02-08T08:43Z,this is episode 12 (moving the chains)
,robbe8282,2010-02-08T09:26Z,Huser S06E12....
,jumpingphil,2010-02-09T01:34Z,"einaripa at 2010-02-06 21:20 CET: 

Episode 12 and dubbed in russian, jepebrilo u motherfucker 

I think you need to go back to school and learn how to read.
Quite clearly says in the description exactly what it is.

Fukking idot isn't out yet(no shit) 

See above.


1988gott at 2010-02-07 07:09 CET: 

That's 12 episode.
Why is this faker still not banned? 

See above. ( Also, shouldn't you say ""episode 12"" not the other way round )


Why aren't people who can't read banned.
Foul mouthed idiots."
,1988gott,2010-02-09T19:11Z,"Ok. As those of us, who are not idiots, can see, people at this tracker name their torrents in other standart.
So why don't you stop be so vodka, putin, balalaika and follow other's lead?"
,jumpingphil,2010-02-10T03:36Z,"@1988gott
You still can't read can you.
Why don't you go to Fox's website and see what numbering they are using.
This guy is right.
Just 'cos most people number it differently, doesn't mean they are right.
What happened to you anyway, did you download this again this week? 
PMSL."
