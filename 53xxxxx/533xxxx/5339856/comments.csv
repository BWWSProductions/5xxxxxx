[T],fabunbutaps,2011-08-16T19:43Z,"hi my friend, this is a very strange installation for this game:
 1 i open .001 with 7zip and follow your instruction
 2 the .iso was exctrtact in 7zip5OhuTEMP folder, that ok
 3 i launch the installer, but he wrote: temp image does not exist
 4 try again and this time i copy paste the .iso mounted in %temp% folder, after mount with DMtool and it's ok....

 i don't understand a thing, why you don't seed diectly the .iso than your crap .001 .002 .003 etc... files, it waste of time this method and not run correctly with other archiver than winrar.
 after i exctract the .iso, i replace all files i download by this one from %temp% folder.

 thank a lot!!!"
