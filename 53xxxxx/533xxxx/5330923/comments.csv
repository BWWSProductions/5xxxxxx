,zen-TAO,2010-02-03T04:47Z,"Thanks.

Well,
maybe this is from Asylum, or in that ""tradition"": a ""mockbuster"" not so expensive alternative to the ""real"" blockbuster movies?

Anyway, maybe its a good movie...

Peace and Love!"

Otherwise why else would you even mention the word, let alone multiple times within the one comment.

Ben Snyder as Holmes, really? Why do all these jew producers think we want to pay to see more jews play Sherlock? They should cast them as SHYLOCK, who really was a jew.

Thanks for the upload anyway, at least it'll keep the producers from getting more of our money to send to israel to steal more land and rape and murder more Christian and Muslim Palestinian children.

P.S. No Jew would touch dirty Muslim Palestinian children. Your land.... well not like anything productive was being done by the former owners.

P.P.S. Shylock = Fictional Character from Shakespeare

P.P.P.S. And here is some FREE - non-KORAN loving education for ya!
'During Shakespeare's day, money lending was one of the popular careers among Jews; Christians also followed Old Testament laws condemning usury charged to fellow Gentiles. Jews were also banned from owning farm land or prevented from entering guilds and therefore this was one of the few professions open to them in Christian society. In the 16th century, Christians regarded usury as a sin. However, Shylock's profession as a moneylender is still frequently used by critics to support claims of anti-Semitism in the play.

Shylock's ""Hath not a Jew eyes..."" speech, in which he asserts that he is no different than a Christian and deserves revenge as much as they would have it, is one of the most famous monologues in English literature. Some scholars also suggest that Shylock is repeatedly shown to have human qualities and that he becomes a sympathetic character, particularly when he is told about Jessica's betrayal and the loss of his deceased wife's ring.

In the play Shakespeare also makes repeated references to the cruelty Shylock suffers at the hands of Christians.'"
