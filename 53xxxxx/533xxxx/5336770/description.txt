With the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet regime altered the balance of power in the world and sparked the formation of a new international order. As a result, a million of secret agents from both sides of the Iron Curtain were relegated to ostracism. Many died, others went to other jobs their lives and ideals. But most continued to do all that they had learned to do. Michael Roddick, a spy for the German Federal Republic, aware that his days are numbered as a secret agent, leaves the service after the failure of his last mission, decides to disappear without a trace and he takes Helen's daughter a Russian spy who died in suspicious circumstances. Michael and Ellen settled in Barcelona where they open a small restaurant that will allow them to live peacefully and forget its troubled past. But the ghosts of the past never rest. Or at least that is what Roddick notes, which again is immersed in a dizzying nightmare, a world with its own rules when his former comrades claiming reappear pending cases.
