These tracks are not available on ANY OTHER Abbey Road Sessions compilation! This is the first time these songs have been released together!

BRAND NEW COLLECTION FOR 2010!
The â€˜Get Backâ€™ Sessions are remembered as a fractious time in the history of the Fab 4, and as the sessions which ultimately spawned the â€˜Let It Beâ€™ Album.
However, amongst almost 100 hours of Nagra Rolls, the seeds were also sown for the famous â€˜Abbey Roadâ€™ Album.
This album is Part 1 in a Collection of the best forgottenâ€˜Abbey Roadâ€™ Album Sessions, recorded in Twickenham & Apple Studios in January 1969.
Edited and enhanced from the lossless Complete A/B Road Set,
for the very first time this sets pieces together the finest takes of the songs that would ultimately become â€˜Abbey Road.â€™

This set contains none of the 'flab' that many of the 'Get Back' Sessions includes, it has been carefully Remastered and Edited from the Complete A/B Road Collection to include only the best takes of the tracks that became Abbey Road. No board announcements, etc, just the best of JPGR!
