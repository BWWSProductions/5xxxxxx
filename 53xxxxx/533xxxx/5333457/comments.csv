,das_wookie,2011-02-05T18:08Z,"@vidiation: Larger file size != better copy. If you will accept some earnest feedback on your torrents, you need to try and concentrate on ULing original content that hasn't previously been UL'd, rather than try and ""one up"" previous works. Most of your torrents are prior works (not all!) and your efforts could be better spent on improving the community by seeking out content to UL which is fresh and helps others.  $0.02.

Keep up the good work!"
,vidiation,2011-10-18T15:12Z,"@das_wookie - valid point.  I appreciate the ""non-flaming"" critique - too rare these days.  I'll see what I can do to improve my offerings.  Long way from a skull of any color for me!"
