Bryan Peterson - The Perfect Picture

Bryan Peterson is probably my most influential teacher whom I've learned tons from via his books and video.  His teaching style and ability to easily communicate new knowledge in an easily approachable method are key to learning the craft.  Whenever I start working with a new photog, the FIRST set of books and video I point them to are ALWAYS from Bryan!

My recommendation is to use all of his offerings:
