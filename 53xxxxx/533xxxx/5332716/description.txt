It has been created on a fresh UT (Non-Goty) install, followed by:
- Bonus Pack #1 - Epic Bonus Pack: containing six mutators (relics), 11 maps and 3 player models.
- Bonus Pack #2 - Digital Extremes Pack: containing three mutators (volatiles, beacon) and 2 maps.
- Patch v436 - Lastest official patch
- Bonus Pack #3 - Inoxx Map Pack: containing 2 texture packs and 6 maps.
- Bonus Pack #4 - 2 texture packs, 12 maps and 2 player models.

I also included a better OpenGL dll than the one that comes in vanilla UT, although it's not a really new version.

It's a FULL rip, nothing is missing.
                                                              ____________________

First of all, because my CD isn't from GOTY, so it wouldn't be handy to use it, as I would have to download it first.

And mainly, the only advantage of the GOTY edition is that it included 2 top-notch mods (from that time): ChaosUT and Rocket Arena. I like these mods, but it would be dumb to include OLD versions like the ones that came out on GOTY, so either way it would be wise to download them again. Check out the links section here for a website full of UT mods, including both these mods, in newer versions (less bugs, more features, mainly).

The rest of the features are the bonus packs and patch v432 (which is still OLDER then the lastest official). So, no losses here.

In fact, UnrealTournament was a 2 CDs installation, but I don't have the second CD anymore. So, no, no texture pack.

Anyway, that texture pack would increase the overall size of the game by more than 200%, so it wouldn't be worth it, im my opinion.

I haven't even tested this texture pack for like 10 years, but I guess nowadays, since we use higher resolutions, it could be worth. Still, the models are low polly and the animations are ugly, I think that bigger textures wouldn't make a miracle...

You may find these textures elsewhere and use them if you really want them... and if there's enough people asking, I could create a new torrent with them later, who knows (of course, providing I find it, install and see a noticeable difference to justify such effort).

* 2.3. ****************************************** | Why not the unofficial patch? |
********                                          |_______________________________|

From what I've heard, any patches above v436 will make it impossible to open the UnrealEditor. As I myself enjoy using the editor, it wouldn't be wise for me to install it.

And of course, I should be providing a version that allows the editor to be opened, so that it may encourage people to try it out and make their own stuff.

But if you really want the lastest, unofficial patch, check at the end of this text a link to get it.



###################################
# 3. Crack, Serials and Integrity #
###################################

The game doesn't require any serials, so there's no need to ask for it. Even to play online it's not required.

Also, there's no crack included, since v436 removes the CD check.

It means that there're no modified files: even the main executable from the game is the original one (not from CD, but from patch 436, of course).



############
# 4. Setup #
############

Direct2Play, just download it, double-click the setup file, which will extract it following the setup, and it's done. Then, execute the UnrealTournament.exe inside the UT99 System folder.

Remember to check out the free space before doing so, since the uncompressed folder will use 610 MBs.

Also, unlike most RIP game setups, it's very quick: it may take even less than 30 seconds to be installed, varying from your system specs.

I have included a .reg file that's located on the main UT99 folder. If you want to use it (not necessary at all), make sure to edit it first on a text editor and change its paths properly to reflect on your install.

# 5. Troubleshooting #
######################

Just to let you know, it works flawlessly. If you guys have any trouble regarding performance or sound, just comment it here and I'll explain what to do to fix it, adding information for fixes and such on this section.

Keep in mind that the game is more than 10 years old, so any problems you encounter will be due to incompatibility issues between OS and Drivers, but there's always a way to fix them.
                                                   _______________________________

* 5.1. ****************************************** | Excessive speed/frameskipping |
********                                          |_______________________________|

This problem might be related either to newer OS and/or multicore issue from what I've tested. The easiest way to fix it is to right-click the UnrealTournament.exe, and set it to Windows 98/ME compatibility mode and it'll be fixed.
                                                       ___________________________

* 5.2. ********************************************** | Sound stuttering/clipping |
********                                              |___________________________|

This problem might be related to audio hardware and/or drivers used. The fix is also simple: with the game closed, locate the file UnrealTournament.ini in the system folder, open it. Search for [Galaxy.GalaxyAudioSubsystem], and when you find the section, go to the line UseDirectSound=True and set it to false instead.

* 5.3. ************************************************ | Trouble with UMOD files |
********                                                |_________________________|

.UMOD is an extension that is related to the majority of Unreal Tournament mods. Since you haven't run the original UT setup, there're a few registry information missing, that regards the OS operation upon double-clicking such files (.UMOD, and .UNR as well, later one being for maps).

So, what can you do: download the following utility to be able to load UMOD files properly (I haven't tested, but I've heard it works fine):
 
http://download.beyondunreal.com/fileworks.php/modsquad/unreal_tournament//utilities/umodt-19b2.zip

Still, many mods have a non-umod version for download as well, so it may not be a problem, even if you're into mods.

# 6. Playing online #

Patch 436 is the lastest official, but there're plenty unofficial patches around. So when listing the servers, you may find versions ranging from v400 (vanilla UT), v432 (goty without patches), v436 (lastest official patch) to a range up to v451 (lastest unofficial).

Although you're allowed by default to enter v451 games using v436 (most of times, unless the server specifies a minimum version), if you're interested on having that version, check out the links below to find the website responsible for it.

Also, many servers may use mods, mutators, models and maps, usually to change gameplay and stuff, but also to prevent cheants and such. Most of them will be downloaded automatically upon trying to join a server that requires them (unless the server disables downloading to preserve a good ping for the players).
