Pink is a successful young poet. She writes cruel love

poems which she recites all over Germany to her devoted

fans. Her own love life is something of a success as

well. Three men hope to win her as their bride. Pink

makes systematic but incorrect decisions using a pocket

calculator. She sorts out her relationships using text

messaging and settles conflicts using a gun. In spite of

her scrutiny, she chooses the wrong man more than once

But only when she chooses the third will she find

happiness
