1CD? are you kidding?

1CD is 700MB - a bit more if you overburn.

but this file is over 875MB and will
NOT fit on 1 CD.

,CarlisleLuver,2010-02-06T20:02Z,ok going to ask a dumb question and i am sure ppl will laugh but i just really started this torrent/dvdburning so i am not all with it. plus i have no shame so laugh what the heck is seeding? also the only reason i am downloading is my friend wanted me too. dont know if i will watch it. i am not into sci fi except for star wars 
[V],catflap,2010-02-06T23:34Z,"@CarlisleLuver

seeding means that you - or anyone - has the
complete file and is still online and sharing it.

leeching is the opposite, meaning you are still
downloading it.

PS: i'm not into sci-fi except for star trek. :P"
