The Fame Monster (stylized as The Fame Monsâ€ er) is an EP by American recording artist Lady Gaga, slated for initial release on November 18, 2009. The songs on the EP were initially intended to be part of a re-release of Gaga's debut album The Fame. However, Gaga announced that the new songs would be available as a stand alone EP, as she thought re-releases were unfair and that, as the EP represents a separate conceptual and musical body of work, it does not need the songs of The Fame to support it.
