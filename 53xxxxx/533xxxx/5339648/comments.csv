[V],dohduhdah,2010-02-14T18:09Z,you're too kind sonu :-)
,Scruffs22,2010-02-17T17:33Z,"Do you need to pay for a subscription to use this software? I downloaded it and in the calculus section I installed the .exe from CD1 and it is asking for a username and password.

The Thinkwell website mentions that an online subscription is required with the CDs and that is 150.00USD for 12 months. Have you found a way around this dohduhdah?

Whether you have or haven't thanks a lot for the upload, this could be very helpful to me and others. You Rock! "
[V],dohduhdah,2010-02-17T21:06Z,"The material is provided without an account, as the accounts can't be duplicated, unlike the data. The material includes a html index, that can be used to figure out which movie corresponds to which subject. So you can use the material by simply viewing the movies (they can be viewed in a free player like VLC media player)."
[V],dohduhdah,2010-02-17T21:10Z,"Copied/pasted from one of these courses on bitme.org where the material originates:
""This is the Trigonometry series from Thinkwell.  These are video lectures only.  Thinkwell sells these and also offers online exercises which require a code I do not have.  I honestly don't use them as the video sets are usually good enough for me.  

YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THE THINKWELL PLAYER TO WATCH THESE.

You can download it from Thinkwell's website here:

http://www.thinkwell.com/main/download

Once you have the player open and the disc either burned and loaded or mounted with an .iso program, click on the link at the bottom to view the table of contents.  This will allow you to pick which videos you would like to watch.  PM me if you have any questions on how to use the player.  Happy Learning!!!


Description from the website:

Thinkwell's Trigonometry with Edward Burger lays the foundation for success because, unlike a traditional textbook, students actually like using it. Thinkwell works with the learning styles of students who have found that traditional textbooks are not effective. Watch one Thinkwell video lecture and you'll understand why Thinkwell works better.

Comprehensive Video Tutorials
We've built Trigonometry around hundreds of multimedia tutorials that provide dozens of hours of instructional material. Thinkwell offers a more engaging, more effective way for you to learn.

Instead of reading dense chunks of text from a printed book, you can watch video lectures filled with illustrations, examples, and even humor. Students report learning more easily with Thinkwell than with traditional textbooks."""

The torrent works great and if you're starting with Calculus give these videos a shot! I took a quick look over the limits, continuity, derivatives, and integrals videos and it explains some tough concepts very well.

10/10 torrent!
Thanks again for the upload dohduhdah!"

,lsantini,2010-06-21T03:00Z,"I'm having trouble with the Thinkwell player.  When I go to open the downloaded player for MAC a text file opens up?  Can somebody let me know where to get the correct player?

,enjoy52,2011-02-15T03:45Z,"way to go, yet another outstanding upload! Thanks a lot!!"
,chefITz,2011-03-27T16:57Z,"Hi harithacats,
Thanks for the reply. Finally you care enough :) I have an issue while burning the iso CDs. I am not that much of a computer savvy enough I guess. However I will try again with the steps you have stated. When you unzip there are many number of folders. So should I just burn each unzip ISO in one CD as data? Thanks again."
,mbmalone,2011-09-13T20:24Z,"In 2006, Reader's Digest named Professor Edward Burger in the ""100 Best of America"". If there are any more of his videos you could post, they would be greatly appreciated."
