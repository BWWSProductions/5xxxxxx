Australian Biggest Loser Series 5 Episode 4

Episodes 1 & 2 were drastically re-edited as one of the light blue team was recently charged with possession of child pr0n and the makers wanted to remove all trace of the team from the show. Apparently the light blue team were eliminated in the second week, so they have shortened up the first 2 weeks and will presumably spread things out a bit or end the show a week or so earlier.

Pattern looks similar to last year, 1 hour Sunday, Monday, Friday and 1/2 hour Tues, Wed and Thurs.

Enjoy!
(yes it's bigfish!)
