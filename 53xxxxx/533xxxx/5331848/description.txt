* The plot opens with a flashback sequence showing a nine year old Lara Croft traveling with her mother. The plane carrying them 

crashes into the Himalayas, apparently leaving them as the only two survivors. After taking shelter in the ruins of an ancient 
temple, Lara discovers an ornate stone dais holding a sword whilst searching for firewood. She unwittingly activates the ancient 

artefact and watches in horror as her mother vanishes in front of her eyes into a portal.
Years after the plane crash, Lara, now an adult, travels to Bolivia after one of her friends, Anaya Imanu, mentions a stone dais 

located in the ruins of Tiwanaku, a pre-Incan civilisation. After following a twisting rocky path, she runs into a group of 
mercenaries who are under orders to attack her on sight. After disposing of them, she proceeds to a temple encountering more 

mercenaries and dangerous native wildlife along the way. On the other side of the temple, she sees the dais and finds James 
Rutland, an American socialite and self-proclaimed adventurer. Rutland mentions Amanda Evert, a friend of Lara's who supposedly 

died years before, and then orders his mercenaries to kill Lara. She overcomes them and reaches the dais, confirming that it was 
the same as the Himalayan one.
Lara meets Anaya at a village in Peru, and after another battle with Rutland's mercenaries, they reach the tomb in ParaÃ­so, where 

a tragedy befell them years ago. A flashback sequence shows Lara on an archaeological excavation with her university 

colleagues,where she and Amanda witness an unknown entity kill the rest of the team. The entity vanishes when Amanda removes a 

mysterious glowing stone from a wall, but this also causes a cave-in that floods the cavern. Amanda becomes trapped under a pile 

of rubble, 
leaving Lara with no choice but to escape or drown: she flees the cavern, seemingly leaving Amanda to her death.
