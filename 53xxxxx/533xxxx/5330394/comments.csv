,gmb1967,2010-02-03T05:24Z,"Right on! Should be fascinating. When you can, see what you can find on the really bass-ackwards lot in China, and for that matter, Russia. 
Whatever the US is doing is probably chickenfeed compared to the rulers in Russian and China, where there is no restraint. For instance, the illegal organ trade that feeds the rich and politicians in China is well known and simply accepted. They have lots of leeway, and no free press. 
Fucking Americans, always trying to find another way to take over the world and add to their growing list of subjugated nations! The world would be much better off if the Russians and Chinese were running things. "
