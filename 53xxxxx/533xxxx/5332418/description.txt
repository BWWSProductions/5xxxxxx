Welcome to the Gunship Elite. Sorry to rush you out of training school, but 
we have full confidence in your abilities. You are fighting for the future of 
our cultures and the heritage of your Arikhan warrior ancestry. The Alliance 
is being invaded by the Sektar and their bloodthirsty allies, the Morgoths. 
While for years we have held them, their numbers are wearing us down. We must 
take the offensive soon. That is where you come in...

Bang! Gunship Elite is an action game where you shoot a lot of enemies all by 
yourself, in the vein of Wing Commander or Freespace, but with the action 
turned up and tactics turned down. Add spectacular graphics, lots of 
"power-ups" (dropped by dead enemies or left in space by your supply ships), 
and you have a pretty good looking shooter. The game is mouse driven with 
keyboard inputs for things like speed and weapon selection. The plot is your 
typical "fight against all odds" story.
