this is some bad ass hard-psych with stompin' song construction--even with some subdued guitar (it's there, but not the leader), this album treads over its contemporaries. the bass is all-over-the-place wild. the full horn section that blows away chicago. but the most attractive facet of this album is the lead vocalist who sounds like a pissed off wolfman jack--he tears through tracks with wild fury.

DEFINITELY dload this album!"
