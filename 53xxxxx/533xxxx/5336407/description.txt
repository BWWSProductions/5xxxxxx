                    Emily and Naomi are back at Roundview and seem  
                    as loved-up as ever. When the police turn up,  
                    they are both called in to be interviewed.  
                    Their names were listed by the family as close  
                    friends of Sophia's, even though Emily knows  
                    they'd never met her. Emily learns that Naomi  
                    was dealing pills with Cook in the club that  
                    night and sold one to Sophia. Behind Naomi's  
                    back, Emily visits Sophia's family - she needs  
                    to know why the family had their names. She  
                    discovers that the dead girl claimed to be best  
                    friends with Naomi and Emily. Whilst looking  
                    around Sophia's bedroom Emily secretly pockets  
                    a key. Effy's return has drawn a line under  
                    Cook and Freddie's joint denial-fest. Though  
                    they keep their distance from Effy at first,  
                    Cook later sees Effy and Freddie get together.  
                    In haste he lashes out - assaulting a random  
                    party-goer - and gets nicked. Emily realises  
                    that the key she found is for Sophia's locker  
                    and inside she finds a shrine to Naomi. Was  
                    Sophia some kind of Naomi stalker?
