This is a ONE TIME ONLY seed. It took 7 days my bandwidth to seed this collection. All the albums were ripped in secure mode, which means 2 things: 1) each album took much longer to rip, and 2) you will not hear a scratch, gap, or any other defect anywhere in the entire collection. Furthermore every album has been painstakingly and meticulously tagged to include relevant information such as the composer, librettist, conductor, orchestra and principal singers. If you enjoy this collection, show you gratitude by passing it forward to other Opera fans.

This collection has a total of 16 albums, 15 Operas and a single Operatic duets compilation album. Two of the Operas are reseeds which had incorrect album art and have been renamed to include track number. All the albums were ripped using L.A.M.E. encoder at a 320 CBR.
