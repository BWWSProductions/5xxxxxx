Q: What is the best way to combine CD1 and CD2 into one viewable file?"

,scotbrit,2010-02-07T20:09Z,thanks my kids will love this
,mailamal,2010-02-08T14:29Z,"joining 2 cd rips is possible only if there is same data rates, if they are same u can use virtual dub, open the file with it,choose direct stream copy in video and the choose append avi segment from the file options and save it somewhere. No comes subtitle,can be joined with vobsubs or subtitle workshop... easiest way try some 1 cd sub with same frame rate.... "

*the render of the characters are not that good! but this is not the cause off the rip... they render it on low quality, as maybe this is not a big budget one...My opinion
