Description: Venue - Amboseli National Park in Kenya at the foot of the mountain Kilimanjaro. Resplendent and magnificent, elephants are the largest animals on land and are among the most gentle and familial of all. Africaâ€™s Elephant Kingdom follows a strong clan, led by the matriarch, as is their way. The cameras follow this particular clan as they make the annual trek to the mountains in Kenya, walking miles upon miles in preparation and expectation of the rains and triggered flooding of the vast plains, enriching the land and breathing life into the dusty vastness. This mini-documentary of this elephant family was filmed with the assistance of veteran zoologist Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a top expert on elephants and reveals with some intimate moments, their ways.
