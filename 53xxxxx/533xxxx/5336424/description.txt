Edvard Grieg (1843-1907) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grieg
Percy Grainger (1882-1961) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Grainger

Some choral arrangements by Grainger of folksong/blues material, employing cheesy harmonies and often with a baritone-solo line.

In the middle of this CD are five tracks by his elderly Norwegian friend, Grieg: scared music of his own composition employing similarly close harmonies.

This CD is titled "At Twilight", ostensibly after its final track, but also I am sure due to the whole CD being rather serene.

A bit of a "niche" CD.  A number of the tracks are beautiful arrangements, and the Grieg on here is indeed worthy of being fairly well-known already.  That being said, it is not one of my favourite CDs, but I am uploading this as I have not yet uploaded anything else of this style (being the main reason I have decided to break my resolve not to upload anything else from the Hyperion label - music from the c20 repetoire is their forte - and its ALL available for purchase, cheaply, in DRM-free MP3 and FLAC !).
