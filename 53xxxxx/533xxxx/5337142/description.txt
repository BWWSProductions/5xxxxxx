For the first time since 2004, Jon Stewart sparred with Bill O'Reilly on "The Factor" Wednesday night. And as expected, the two hosts had a lot to debate â€” from the Obama administration to Fox News itself. 

Despite criticism from Stewart, O'Reilly brought up a recent poll that found Fox to be more trusted than other networks. Stewart brushed it off by responding that there's a poll which finds him to be the most trusted newsman.

"Here's what I believe," Stewart said. "Fox News is the most passionate and sells the clearest narrative of any news organization if that's how you're â€” are you still referring to it in that manner?"

The two batted around the issue of whether Fox is a straight news organization or slants to the right, with O'Reilly telling Stewart that the network's setup is not so different from a newspaper, where there's clearly labeled news and opinion content. However, they had different views on whether its clear to viewers which part is commentary and which is "fair and balanced" news.
