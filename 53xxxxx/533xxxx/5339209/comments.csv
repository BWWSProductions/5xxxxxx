[V],twentyforty,2010-02-06T01:30Z,"Guys, it is one of my top ten of all times, but:
Please, do not play like that... currently this swarm EXCHANGE 29.8 kB/s.
31 people!!!
It is ridiculous.
This would turn your download in real nightmare.

So please, INCREASE your upload speeds, you cannot ""screw with the system"". You can only loose.
Please.

@thank_u_h264_team: Yes."

,madtown4,2010-02-06T07:18Z,@vigaversa im not here to argue but if you folllow a certain uploader you should suport the uploader by talking shit even if it's not what you would like !! so either download and help seed or wait for what you want and then seed seed  seed seed !!!!!!! thats just my thoughts

Two years back I ordered that DVD from Spain, back then there is no BluRay yet, I ripped that disk for myself, and today, when I was asked to help - from htctouch I upped what I have, what I own but decided to share.

""WHAT I HAVE"" an ""SHARE"" are the keywords, unfamiliar to many of you.

I got two more: ""SHAME ON YOU"" and ""STFU"".

1. It is LONG MOVIE, 2h03m. Frame-size is 16/9, not 2.35/1 where higher file-size gains can be achieved.
In MP4, H264 world, in such case ONE HOUR is always 238 MB, but - content dependent.

 2.The.Fellowship.of.the.Ring.2001.BluRay.H264[PC.Mac.Xbox.PS3.ipod].mp4 is 653 MB and guess what - frame size IS 2.35/1 but movie is still ""big""? One can find ANY MOVIE done by MANY, not just here. Some people do even smaller file-sizes, right? So, in the same tone: GO SOMEPLACE ELSE, please... Please.

Ungrateful bastards.

P.S: Today is scheduled Watchmen.2009.ULTIMATE.CUT.DVDRip.H264[PC.Mac.Xbox.PS3.ipod].mp4 and FILE-SIZE is 693 MB and it is small-sized re-encode on ""my usual way"". Eh"
,the_shroud,2010-02-06T08:20Z,"Sorry to be a bother. But would you have time to schedule in Caprica n Smallville for today amidst your movie uploads?
Thx m8. You're a real philanthropic genius"
,htctouch,2010-02-06T08:34Z,"@vigaversa 
not a gud attitude dude . u can query 2040 abt stuff but at the end he is the ryt person to decide what n when to upload ."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-06T08:36Z,"@the_shroud: LOL my old friend, I mainly do shows, movies - just occasionally and obviously I have ""spoiled"" many... and I must reconsider that.

Yep, it's like children bitching about the kind of candy you just gave them on Halloween... but those kids have better manners and would never do that. :)"
,the_shroud,2010-02-06T08:50Z,"Thx again m8, will be waiting and of course will seed as much and as fast as the connection in my lil far away country able to. 
So incredibly honoured to be regarded as your friend.
Cheers"

@madtown: Thanks for help.
And yes, sadly it's true - both ""releases"" (IMAGINE and POCAHONTAS) suffers from - dumb encoders. See, DVDSCR have a mixed progressive frame-rate (pure 29.97 frames per second) and pulled-up frame-rate (when 23.976 ""faking"" 29.97). Morons simply applied standard procedure as for ""normal"" 29.97, when so called ""decimation"" is performed equally on all frames, to reconstruct original movie frame-rate of 23.976 from DVD frame-rate 29.97.
BUT, you cannot apply such procedure on MIXED input, then you equally decimate the 29.97 AND 23.976, and it is not possible for laymen, to do it as they wish. If (layman) are smart, they simply leave 29.97 alone, not trying to act as idiots, who have, just today fucked-up ten thousands of people to get ""5 minutes of fame and glory"".

Aside from this jerkiness (picture skips a lot), brightness was boosted about 14% and overall quality is bad, bad and worse than bad.

I do not know how much you know about technical stuff, but I have tried to explain ""Why"" and, by the way, to learn something is always a good thing. ""

Same goes for Vision, Flawless, Noir and whatever pops-up. They ALL have used SAME DVDR source posted under two p2p-groups-names on alt.binaries.  They all are basically the same. AS I SAID, WHEN DVD OR BLURAY COMES OUT, PROBABLY, MAYBE... I WILL DO MY RE-ENCODING."
,htctouch,2010-02-06T11:54Z,"will wait for that sir .its best to skip downloadin d scrnr..anyways m only waiting for ninja assasins dvdrip/bdrip.i knw iv mentioned it alot of times bt evrytime i write this, i feel m praying for it to release.lol"

,Dramat,2011-01-04T17:54Z,"Hey, Twentyforty! Thanks 4 this 1!!!
I've dl'ed it and watched today. Great acting (Pitt, Willis) and amazing climate of the movie with end of the world in background - that's great recipe for two hours of high quality entertainment ;D
This is one of  the best sf movies I've ever seen!

I will be seeding for a long time :)"
