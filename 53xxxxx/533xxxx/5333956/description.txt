In case you were wondering, DC didn't release an issue of the main Blackest Night 
series in January.  That means that "Blackest Night 007" is coming out in February.
Instead, this month we get eight cancelled series back from the dead.  

From the October '09 "DC Nation" page:
"... this January, the Blackest Night miniseries skips a month to make room for a very special Blackest Night event.  Eight classic titles from DC's past will return from the dead for one month only to celebrate this mega-crossover throughout the DC Universe.  Each series will pick up from its original numbering and feature characters from their original runs as they deal with the events currently unfolding in the DC Universe."
