,Bugsy_B,2010-02-07T07:10Z,"I really wish assholes would stop spamming the comments with bullshit links to bullshit sites that require you to fill out surveys over your cell phone at $2 a question before you can watch any movie ( If indeed you really can watch said movies on their site with the sparkling clarity these dickheads brag about on here). These bastards need to have their pee-pees wacked and be banned from TPB.

I would like to have an honest update on the quality of this up. Judging by the screenshots, it looks to be just another example of shit cam work but I don't want to base my opinion solely on screenshots...more quality reviews people!"
