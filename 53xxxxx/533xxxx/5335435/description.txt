Description: The Gospel of Judas - the Gospel in Coptic language, was found in 1978 in Egypt, partially reconstructed and published in 2006. The main difference of the canonical gospels is the claim that Judas was not at all a traitor and betrayed Christ to the Romans by his own request. His kiss was not pointed to Christ, which had a very different meaning.
