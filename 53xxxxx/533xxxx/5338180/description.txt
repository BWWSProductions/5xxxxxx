  P L O T  


                                                         
 On one warm summer evening, four very important meals   
 are being made. Thirty year old Lily Ireland is making  
 a Insalata Caprese for the new and much older man in    
 her life; a photo journalist, born and raised in Spain  
 named Michael, who she couldn't be more excited about.  
 In the apartment just across the courtyard, a very      
 pregnant Shelly Hynd is making her best attempt at      
 Lasagna, while her husband Chris looks on, knowing he   
 is moments away from ordering a Pizza...and when he     
 does, the highly hormonal Shelly is out the door and    
 straight up the stairs to her friend Jude's house for   
 some comfort. Shelly finds her friend lost in her       
 passion, and just beginning an elaborate Italian meal   
 for she and her lover, Celia, whom they both know won't 
 make it home in time. And finally, there is the         
 culinary extravaganza being prepared in front of Celia, 
 who works on a movie set, where on that particular day, 
 they are shooting a couple cooking, while the crew      
 devours pizza on the side-line. Over the course of the  
 evening, all of the cooks and the guests of the         
 kitchen, truly experience why it is called "The heart   
 of the house." The discussions organically flow to a    
 place where they are all about relationships, and they  
 are all about truth, and desire, and no one is allowed  
 off the hook about all that they are not saying amidst  
 their words. Lily and Michael dance around what they    
 want in life as they dance around the kitchen in a      
 seductive and emotional game, that never even allows    
 them to make it to the dining table. As Shelly unloads  
 all of her fears of motherhood and the future of her    
 marriage, Jude's acceptance and knowledge of Celia's    
 infidelity rises to the surface without a word being    
 said between the bruschetta and the cannoli. All the    
 while, Chris has settled into an evening of Pizza and   
 Adult Entertainment on DVD, and Celia has decided to    
 reel in a young actress curious about lesbians, just    
 for sport. ...And in the end, there is no resolution,   
 but there is hope, and there is love, and there is      
 life, unveiled and unapologetic in La Cucina.
