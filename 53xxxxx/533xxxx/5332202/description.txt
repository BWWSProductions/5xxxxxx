God Loves You My Muslim Friend - Former Muslim Ergun Caner Testimony:
 

About The Audio / Video:

His Life Before Jesus Came In:

He was born in about 1960. He grew up a devout Muslim in a devout Muslim family 
in Ohio, USA. He wore his Muslim attire to school and kept a prayer rug in his locker. 
He was proud of his religion. Caner notes, "Every Muslim child learns about the scales. 
The scales are terrifying. The Koran says if your scales are heavy, you will live 
in paradise; but if your scales are light, you will find perdition. You have to 
be 51% righteous to get to paradise." The balance scales compare the good deeds 
to the bad deeds. So, Caner lived by the 5 pillars of Islam.

"But, there was this one kid...an obnoxious, wouldn't-take-'no'-for-an-answer 
kid...who kept inviting me to things at his church. Sunday school, youth retreats, 
lock-ins, everything. He wouldn't leave me alone. Finally, he wore me down." 
Finally he went to the boy's church, & they loved him. The ridicule he expected was absent. 
After hearing the pastor explain the purpose of Christ's crucifixion and resurrection, 
he accepted Jesus as his Savior.

There is only one way...in view of the above balance scales...of eternal 
assurance of paradise according to Islam: to die a martyr! "The 19 men who 
executed the 9/11 attacks on the USA weren't great Muslims...they were 
desperate Muslims." It had come to Caner clearly: "I realized Jesus strapped 
Himself to the cross so I didn't have to strap myself to a bomb."

His Life Since Jesus Came In:

Caner's father disowned him when he told him about his new faith in Christ. 
That was the last time he saw his father for 17 years! Harsh? Caner notes, 
"It's not that bad. The Koran says, 'If anyone changes his Islamic religion, 
kill him.' In 38 countries around the world, that is exactly what happens. 
But my father didn't kill me; he just disowned me." That church and its members became his family.

Eventually, both of his brothers, his mother, and his grandmother came to faith 
in Jesus (his dad died a Muslim). He became professor of theology and church 
history at Liberty University. Ergun Caner is the President of Liberty 
Theological Seminary at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. 
When Caner was named to the position in 2005, he became the first former 
Muslim to become the leader of an evangelical seminary.

As an aside to this testimony, you might be interested in Muslims 
for Jesus and a note about the extreme objection of Muslims to 
the truth that Jesus was crucified on the cross
