,kiasu1,2010-03-10T10:25Z,"In 50 years I have never met a good person. Those I thought qualified told me that the more ""holy"" you are that the more you realise you are not. Time to raise your standard on what is good.

All the religions tell you to live a good life. Jesus says you can't. You need him to rescue you.
