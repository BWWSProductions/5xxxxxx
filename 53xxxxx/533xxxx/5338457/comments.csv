,jacopastorias,2010-09-25T16:24Z,how is this supposed to work? im trying to activate offline but it's not doing anything. i overwrote my old chessbaseadmin with the new one and ran it and ran the keygen but chessbaseadmin does not have anything in its list and the keygen needs a hardware id before  i can do anything so what am i doing wrong?
