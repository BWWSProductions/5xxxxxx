Secret agent Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) just received a burn notice -- a statement that a spy is unreliable and has been effectively fired -- for unknown reasons. Now, Westen must find out who issued the notice and why they did it without being able to use the resources and contacts he once had at his disposal. Created and written by Matt Nix, Burn Notice combines a mixture of action and a fresh sense of humor that combined result in a new breed of spy.
