as always, you are the god of music torrents!  "
[V],bubanee,2010-02-05T15:43Z,"@jainmehul 240kbps average it says... but if your using DB for a CDRip you should get above that everytime :)

@zombifuzz.. i actually tried to download your torrent but it never started.. might try later... "
[V],bubanee,2010-02-07T04:14Z,"well i used to be CBR all over the place KBPS... and after reading and alot of reading on the subject.. i settled for VBR... it's like a hamburger with all the good stuff you want minus the shit you don't!.. good luck on providing some good CDRips i look forward to seeing some, Cheers! :)"
