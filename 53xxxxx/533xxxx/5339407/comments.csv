Listen I'm new to this stuff. how do i get a torrent that i made to seed. it doesnt do anything the icon remains blue. "
,jart92,2010-02-23T07:35Z,"if you want to seed these files then you should just keep your torrent client open after you have finished downloading and it should automatically seed. however, if you are creating your own torrent then first you need to make it with whatever client you have then go to file -> add torrent and then add it to your active list.  finally you need to post it on piratebay so people have access to it.  if that didn't make sense, just go to the piratebay forums for help :-)"

,jart92,2010-09-21T09:49Z,"it'll play with vlc and quicktime for sure. idk about jetaudio cause i don't know what that is,  but if it is compatible with mp4 (h.264) then it should play."
