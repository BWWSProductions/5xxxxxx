Most people, the majority, WON'T EVER seed rar's. "
,ptv83,2010-02-04T05:09Z,"i agree, i hardly seed rar's as much as non-rar's.. i still seed, but hardly as much, even with 32TB of HDD space.. it's just annoying. frag's your drives, clutter's everything up, kill seeds.. there is NO advantage of doing it."
,ame81,2010-05-24T18:37Z,Can you please seed? I could only get 46.2%.
