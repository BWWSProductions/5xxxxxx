,TMA2,2010-02-10T09:18Z,"the last HD rip _was_ from BluRay, but had custom line audio due to it being RC (Region C) sourced, i.e. non-english audio."

Took a while, but worth it.
Thanks man"

Still searching for the subs, but have seen the first 5mins of the movie. I'm afraid the movie is going to be a bit dissapointing ;)"
,ahalheru,2010-02-27T05:31Z,bad rip.  Tons of pixelations when I watched from my TV so be careful.  Worked fine on the PC though
,theshape31,2010-03-05T18:07Z,"Thank you for the upload, the audio and video quality are excellent.  If anyone gets pixelation it's either your cpu or media player.

This was simply the worst film I have ever seen, though."
