,jake_samuals,2010-02-05T19:57Z,"Hey HR, glad to finally find an ATV dedicated encoder. For your encodes you indicate to sync for best results. I've tried streaming and had flakey results. Not sure if you've mentioned it elsewhere so I apologize for asking again, but is the lack of trouble-free streaming an ATV hardware issue? Strangely, I tried to re-encode with ReduxEncoder and even Video Monkey and the encodes failed. So, I removed the AC3 track with Subler, then it worked, then added the AC3 track back but still had buffering issues while trying to stream. Is there anything I can do to get your files to stream. I prefer streaming as I have hundreds of movies. Your suggestion of syncing the 10 most recent movies is doable but not ideal as I may not get around to watching them in time before the list gets updated. Thanks for your hard work and sorry for the long post."
,jake_samuals,2010-02-05T23:52Z,Wifi (n speed) is how I stream/connect so I guess it's a no go then... bummer. So streaming works for you but only via a direct ethernet connection.
