        Jody (Leelee Sobieski) is an aspiring Hollywood filmmaker  and
        still  jobless  -  that  is until  the  studio  head  of Grind
        Productions comes calling...

        Grind is an adult film  company that wants Jody to  edit their
        new  film,  Finding Bliss.  She  soon finds  she  has all  the
        facilities needed to make her own heart-felt romantic movie on
        the sly,  so she  edits porn  by day  and films  her storybook
        romance by night... until she gets caught.

        Rather than being fired, Jody is allowed to use the facilities
        if she  re-writes their  lacklustre porn  script and  turns it
        into an  art-house movie.  But during  the re-write,  Jody and
        director Jeff (Matt Davis) form an unlikely relationship.

        Determined to  let nothing  stand in  her way,  Jody befriends
        Laura  (Denise  Richards), the  star  of the  movie,  and soon
        realises that life  is a classic  struggle between good  girls
        and bad boys, art and commerce, idealism and selling out.
