,rmor,2010-02-08T06:05Z,"To ErCabrero:
I had the same problem as you..
when you installed the latest sims 3 you have, you've probably overwritten the original TS3EP01.exe and TSLHost.dll files so that the game will work for you without a CD.. the only thing i can suggest is to find the original ones and replace them with the ones you have in the folder the sims3/game/bin. If you lost them and cannot find them online reinstall the game fully, but when asked just check to keep your saved games..
Then try installing everything again up until the high end loft stuff, this should work. make sure you saved the original TS3EP01.exe and TSLHost.dll in some other folder for future installations, so you don't have to install everything again.

For everybody that is asked for a CD:
go to
http://gamecopyworld.com/

type the name of the game you are looking for and the instructions are right there (:

Hope i helped"

,jeromycraig,2010-02-10T05:17Z,"@murder86:  The last patches for EA for the base game and World Adventures disabled any store content it found that was not purchased legitimately from the EA store.  This was disguised as a ""handy"" feature that allows you to access the store from in-game.  Since installing HEL updates your game to the last patch, it does the same.  There are workarounds for this.  Try checking the threads at More Awesome Than You.  I still have all of my arr'd store content working thanks to their workarounds."

,rh11,2010-02-19T21:24Z,"How to update...
1) Install Sims 3 (razor 1911 vesion)

4) Install WA update - 2512004002 from 2086002002
5) Install HEL (vitality version)

I didn't need to update it again but if you do download the No Cd crack from gamecopyworld. 

Download all of those ^ patches from the patches scrolls. 

Do not ever crack your games, otherwise the updates will not work. My cc seems to work fine, obviously install the correct framework. 

Hope that helps. "

,jeromycraig,2010-02-21T07:07Z,"Basically, you have to use converted package files for arr'd store content to show up in-game.

This is assuming you have the framework installed that lets the game recognize .package and .dbc files.  There are instructions elsewhere on the site that tell you how to do that, if you haven't already."

In order for the original Sims 3, World Adventures, and High End Loft to work correctly you...

1. Install Sims 3, then patch the game to version 1.11.7

2. Install World Adventures, then patch up to version to 2.6.11

3. Install High End Loft, then patch to version 3.2.8

4. copy and paste High End Loft crack to /bin

5. play the game"
,chooliscu,2010-04-23T17:58Z,"helllppppp!!!. Please wen u guys say install the sims this or dat and 'patch it to verson dis or dat' please wat does it mean to patch it? how do i do that, is it just to get a patch with that version?
thanks."
,chooliscu,2010-04-23T18:20Z,"It worked. 
Ok, this is what i did.
I already have the sims 3 with the crack. then i installed World Adventures, while installing it asked me to update my sims 3 and i clicked ok. after installing i tried to play it without the crack. it worked up till where i have to click on my household then it asked for the CD.
I copied d crack cd into the bin folder and this worked.
then i installed High-end loft stuff, and while trying to install it, it asked if i wanted to update my sims 3 and i clicked ok. after installing i tried to play it and it also asked for the original CD. then i copied d crack for the high-end into the bin folder, and guess wat. it worked perfectly well.
maybe people need to be connected to the internet to update as they are installing before it can work properly, i have no idea. but it worked for me without any problem. thanks to everyone who has been trying to help others play this game.....and gudluck."
,rh11,2010-04-26T13:35Z,"to nix1016...
Which update are you trying to gewt to work? 
All update for HEL (and previous) up to 3.1 you can find here...
Gamecopyworld, the scroll patchs, BT arena (I recomend the scroll patches).
It give you a choice from anyupdated bersion to had to the most recent EXCEPT HEL 3.2 I can't get that to work either because there isn't a worldwide patch yet. But as soon as it's out those sites will have it.
I've never botherd with SKU in thee registry Just look up what kind og game your playing(razor's version should be 02 at the end which is world wide) so is the HEL I have. If you need more help let me know.

To surx325...
Thats right hopfully the HEL version will work for you because I can't get the right version download for it as I said above^ remember to save your dll files from your previous update incase something goes wrong, you can just copy-and-paste them back into your game/bin and everythings fine again (if the most recent update doesn't work)

Hope that helps!"
,rh11,2010-04-26T13:43Z,"Apprently my commewnt didn't work... So
Nix1016...
Gte the most recent updates from the patches scrolls (or gamecopyworld, BT arena they have all the patches but not a 3.2 worldwide (02 at the end) which is what most people who use the downloaded razor/reloaded/vitality have)
So Don't patch your HEL to 3.2 untill there is a working patch or save your DLL files so you can over-write them and play normally again.
I've never botherd with SKU version in the registry, it never worked for me, You shouldn't have to crack the game either if you have the right update, we will just have to wait for worldwide 3.2, it'll be out sooner rather than later.

Surx325..
Thats right but If you read what I put up there^  unless you have the Digital Download or US/DVD version, I'm afraid you can't patch your game to 3.2 at the momemt but when that patch comes out that method will work (minus the cracking, you shouldn't have to do that if the patch works right... If it doesn't work, try it but save your previous Dll files!!!)

Hope that helps."
