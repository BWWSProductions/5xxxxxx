The Diary Of Anne Frank (1959)

Most people are familiar with The Diary of Anne Frank, a chronicle of the courageous Jewish teenager who was living in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation. Her story came to a tragic end in August 1944 when she and her family were found by Gestapo troops in their attic hidingspot.  Anne herself would perish nine months later in a concentration camp, and her father Otto fought valiantly to ensure that her memory would be preserved through the publishing of her diary. He succeeded in 1947; the book would go on to be translated in 67 languages and 
achieve even greater fame when the stage version of the story opened on Broadway in 1955. Two years later, 20th Century Fox hired director George Stevens to bring the story to the film screen. One of the great American film directors, Stevens began his career with slapstick comedies, but soon graduated on to masterful works like Gunga Din (1939), I Remember Mama (1948),and Shane(1953).
