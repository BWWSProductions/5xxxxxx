Somewhere in Midwestern America was a place called Conover County.  When the old book was opened, and the runes therein used in haste and ignorance, a place of farms, simple folk, and small-town dreams became a den of monsters and nightmare.  North 40 is the story of those who survived and came to confront an even greater evil on the horizon - one that wouldnâ€™t just consume their flesh, but their souls as well.

Written by Aaron Williams (PS238) and illustrated by Fiona Staples (Secret History of the Authority: Hawksmoor).
