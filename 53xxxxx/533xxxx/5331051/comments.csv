Look man, I don't dog on your Brittany Spears, N*Sync, or whatever ever else queer crap you deem decent, so go fuck yourself so hard your dick comes out your fuckin' skull and slaps you upside the face for disrespecting other peoples' shit.  If you want to go throwing links up to bash Juggalos, I dare you to go talk shit to one's face.  WHOOP WHOOP!

@dickanus
Thanks for the upload, dead clown lovin'!"
,nerull69,2010-02-03T06:31Z,"lol your a chootch Mojo. I listen to Hendrix, Zepplin  etc. I am in my 40's and I had no idea what  ""juggalo"" was, & seeing how this ""kewl"" internet teen speak shit is saturating everyone's lives I figured it had something to do with skateboarding.  

I think the reason your being so defensive is that the definitions on the link i found hit a bit too close to home for you.

So go eat some cake, your dismissed."

Eloquent enough response, however, if you didn't mean to insult you wouldn't have checked as classless as sight as UrbanDictionary.  You would have sited something more properly aimed for the true audience such as:

http://www.psychopathicrecords.com/

Or, here's a genius one that I honestly would have assumed a 40 year old could have honestly figured out on his own, without the obvious tip from a 25 year old:

Maybe next time I see a Pink Floyd discography pop up, even though I love him and everything from Muddy Waters to John Mellencamp to Busta Rhymes, I'll put up some ignorant link that pisses you off, just hoping and praying that you or someone like you gets irritated because they like that music.  I'll be thinking of you when I do it, nerull69...  and I'll have a tear in my eye, I'm sure.  Though, I think I'll do what I prefer, and keep my fucking mouth shut if it's something I don't think I'll like.  Good day, sir.  Good day."
,nerull69,2010-02-03T08:20Z,"Damn, you must have gobbled down that cake fast.
 I could care less what anyone thinks about anything i may or may not like. Obviously, this is not the case for you as your clearly upset!   

By the way, ""classless"" could also be described as feverishly replying to someone even after they dismissed you. 

 I am finished with this now, you may go."

Hey, if you're going to sprout a nice new baby torrent, you should suckle that little bastard a bit so others can take over and seed it too.  That is the whole point of a torrent you know.  I didn't even get to  .01% by the time you shut down.  Never going to get the Twiztid vids for my gf that way."
,Juggalo_Stitch,2010-10-31T01:23Z,"yea dude, wtf? your a juggalo. have pride and reseed this shit for awhile."
