Office 2007 SP1 supports the Open Document Format standard (a.k.a., the OpenOffice.org/StarOffice formats) but implementation quality is horrible. If you really want to use ODF files, you'll need to use this converter that for all intent and purpose installs a headless copy of OpenOffice.org that manages format conversions in the background. Depending on your default security settings in Office and Windows, you may need to enable the plugins in each supported application (Word, Excel and Powerpoint).
