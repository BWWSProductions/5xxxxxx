In 1975, Reuniting with longtime producer Bob Ezrin (who was absent for Cooper's prior record, 
MUSCLE OF LOVE), Cooper released an album whose title explains the subject matter--WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE. 
Now on his own and in total control, Cooper ... Full Descriptionwas able to explore rock theatrics in a 
way that was impossible in his band. The ensuing tour was one of the most over-the-top excursions of that era. 

"Cold Ethyl" is a disturbing little ditty about necrophilia. The soft, melodic "Only Women Bleed" became a 
surprise smash for Alice, and there's a low-key feel as well on the chilling "Steven." The somewhat funky title 
track works as a kind of theme song, while Cooper's expected heavy metal tendencies are explored on 
"The Black Widow." Most of Lou Reed's band joined Cooper for this record. Guitarists Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, 
as well as bassist Prakash John do a superb job of replicating the excitement of the original band. 

After the band known as Alice Cooper broke up, the band's singer/namesake took the moniker on for his first solo album.
