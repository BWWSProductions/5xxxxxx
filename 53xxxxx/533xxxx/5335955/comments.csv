,Smorgan,2010-02-08T08:34Z,I might have a solution but no promises if its possible to disassemble the install package and then put it back to together then you will be able to do something with this...
,Smorgan,2010-02-08T09:03Z,I can make this work if I can take a folder and turn it into a exe file with something that I know the problem is just getting windows to accept it and run it having just modified the installer for office 2010 I need some software to put it all back together again got anything that will do that???
,Smorgan,2010-02-09T15:00Z,Seeing as you guys are getting what I'm saying basically we need to find a way to extract the contents of the .exe to path and keep the folder structure so that its usable as in you can run the setup manually from that location...
,Smorgan,2010-02-09T15:16Z,Assuming I'm right here for once what is really necessary is the need to find out where the executable of the installer extracts to it has to be somewhere on the machine once someone finds that we will all be able to make progress.
,Smorgan,2010-02-09T23:32Z,Sorry solor but we need a copy which can be installed without a product key here it is http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5342210/Microsoft_Office_2010_RTM_Escrow_14.0.4734.1000_32bit_64bit.  Then after a few hours of work I should be able to do something with this.
,Smorgan,2010-02-15T06:49Z,"I will kindly explain a potential way to do this but there are a but fuck load of ""what if's"". First you have to somehow replace ""all"" the license information then you have to spoof a KMS server some how which is quite difficult.  After all of that you have a slim chance of actually being able to activate it.  Is it worth spending a good amount of time doing probably not cause you guys have 30 days upon installing this product to get it working not including re-arms which can be infinite I think..."
