    [ Release Notes ]

      Durable, high-tech, sexy and see through...we just can't seem to resist
      its glossy appeal. It seems so modern, it's hard to believe it's been
      around for 100 years! The early days of plastics were explosive: the
      first synthetic billiard balls blew up on impact! Over the years plastics
      have quietly permeated all parts of our lives. But what do we do with
      something that doesn't go away when we throw it way? Our oceans and dumps
      are filling up with the stuff, and yet inventive ideas for single use
      plastics just keep rolling out.

      How do we live more responsibly with plastic? Forever Plastic looks at
      our struggle.

      Upscale eggs are now nesting in clear plastic egg cartons, rather than 
      cardboard ones (made from recycled paper and fully recyclable). Leyenda
      Lee of Interplast Packaging argues that her plastic egg cartons are
      environmentally friendly, but are they?

      The plastics industry argues that recycling is the answer. If you had to
      do a Plastics Recycling Test - would you pass? All those puzzling plastics
      add to the challenge each time we put out our curbside blue boxes/bags.
      And what about that reassuring recycling symbol that's on most plastics
      - can you use it for guidance? When environmental consultant David
      Siddiqui tests Canadians' understanding of plastics recycling he discovers
      that there is mass confusion.

      Municipalities are struggling to keep up with plastic industry pressures
      and consumer expectations, as the costs for recycling escalate. Atul Nanda
      from Recyclable Materials Marketing trades in our trash. He buys and sells
      used glass, paper and of course, more and more plastic, supplied by the
      municipal sorting plants. He has some shocking news about just how many
      types of plastics are actually being recycled.

      As the mountains of plastic debris continue to grow some individuals 
      are doing their part to reduce the waste. Internationally recognised
      eco-designer Stuart Haygarth upcycles plastic trash into his seductive
      and glamorous artworks. Chuck Sparks and Lisa Lackenbauer from Think
      Plastics are creating 100% plastic lumber from the piles of used hay
      bale wrap and greenhouse wrap that are covering the Ontario countryside
      (and the world), but it's an uphill battle.

      From the 1950s the public image of plastic was all about convenience and
      fun (remember the hula hoop?). We threw it away without a second thought.
      Forever Plastic catches a moment in time as we are forced to find new
      ways to reduce our plastic footprint.
