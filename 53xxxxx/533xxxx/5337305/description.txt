Uriah Heep are an English rock band that was one of the most popular groups of the early 70s.

The band released several commercially successful albums in the 1970s such as Uriah Heep Live (1973), but their audience declined by the 1980s, to the point where they became essentially a cult band in the US and UK. Uriah Heep maintain a significant following in Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, the Balkans, Japan and Russia, where they still perform at stadium-sized venues.

Uriah Heep were the first Western band to play in Soviet Russia, under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost. They have sold over 30 million albums worldwide.

Released in 1977, Innocent Victim is the eleventh album released by British rock band Uriah Heep.

Although it did not chart in the US or UK, Innocent Victim was highly successful in Germany and New Zealand.

The single "Free Me" was a #1 hit in NZ. Innocent victim went on to sell well over 1 million copies in Germany alone. It reached #19 and #44 in NZ and Australia respectively.
