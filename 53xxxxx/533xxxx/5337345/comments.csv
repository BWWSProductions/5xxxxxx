Many people - even if they think otherwise - cannot make a distinction between ""normal"" swarm and the swarm where initial-seedeing is performed. They say ""OK, 0/1 seeder""; but infact, they do not recognize all implications of joining to initial-seeding swarm. To keep it short and simple, if anyone need/wants to save on traffic - for whatever reason - better is to stay away and wait till more than four stable seeders are present. Initial swarms are for the people who CAN put upload/download speed at 1:1 ratio - all other ""types of behaviour"" leads to semi-catastrophic consequences, not only to individual peer, but to ALL peers in specific swarm.
Why is that, I've explained nomerous times on name-not-to-be-spoken - and I might post this Q&A part of the text here. Maybe."
