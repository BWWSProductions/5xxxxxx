Black Light is the sixth album from London electronica 
duo Groove Armada. 

According to the band, Black Light will show a darker 
side to Groove Armada, one never seen before by fans, 
as the band is usually known for their upbeat sound. 

Black Light is preceded by the singles Warsaw and I Won't Kneel, 
which features the band's new vocalist, SaintSaviour. 

I Won't Kneel  features a scintillating vocal from female singer 
SaintSaviour, who has been described as a cross between Kate Bush 
and Anthony & The Johnson's. 

She owned the stage with her performance on Groove Armadas highly 
energised set, at their very own creation, Lovebox Festival in July.

We've worked with a lot of legends, says Andy Cato talking about 
their newfound vocalist SaintSaviour, now we've found one.
