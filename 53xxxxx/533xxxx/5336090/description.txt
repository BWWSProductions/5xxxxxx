Outrageous, controversial, politically incorrect and shockingly Funny.
The king of comedy is back with his most outrageous show
yet!
Filmed live at Jim's court, Cliffs Pavilion, Southend, in
front of a mob of faithful squires, and their ladies.
King Jim gives the crowd what they want with a show
filled with tales of wanton women, pointless wars and her
Majesty's troops.
