,misfisk,2010-02-16T22:53Z,No need to settle for this quality. There's a better looking torrent at Demonoid
,spamboyza,2010-02-22T23:06Z,"I love Demonoid, but in the Demonoid torrent mentioned above, the uploader states that he pulled the files from Die Antwoord's website, where the album track files are (mostly) at a 128 kbps bit rate last time I checked.  So even though they are offered on Demonoid at 256 kbps, I don't think their fidelity will be any better.  Also, DA has a new high-quality track available for download on their website: www.dieantwoord.com."
