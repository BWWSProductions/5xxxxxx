How do I get past this???"
,dbdragon08,2010-03-15T22:20Z,Hi I've got a good version of The Rosetta stone software and I installed both of these 2 cd's. Everything went very well. But now I need activation codes for both cds. It's asking for the activation codes now. Do have em avaliable?
,edgeofchance,2010-05-07T06:53Z,you need a cracked version of rosetta stone to avoid activation..i updated spanish and it still worked with the cracked app...it think language updating is fine but not the rosetta stone app update
,kuahara,2010-05-21T13:24Z,I am using a cracked version of rosetta stone version 3.3.5 and this is also prompting me for an update
,PLawless123,2010-06-16T15:39Z,"I am using a cracked Rosetta Stone version 3. When I mount these files on DAEMON Tools lite and add a language pack I get the following message:

9114

There was an error installing the language files. Please try again or contact Customer Support. See your Quick Start card or visit www.RosettaStone.com/Support for contact information.

Is there any other tips or tricks I need to know? Any help would be great. Cheers
