[V],-jonny-,2010-02-04T03:34Z,Okay. If no one reseeds in the next week or 2 I'll remove it from the list.
,collapsd,2010-02-04T03:52Z,"yeah, or you could just search...
i don't get it.
all these movies are on TPB anyway.
what's the point?"
[V],-jonny-,2010-02-04T04:19Z,"@collapsd. If it's not useful to you, ignore it. It should be quite clear why it's a useful list, and many will be grateful. Nobody's interested in pointless negativity."
,collapsd,2010-02-04T04:56Z,"@ -jonny- 
it's not negative.
there's nothing negative about my previous post.
just pointless..
pointless as me reposting the pointlessness of aforementioned posts.
pointless as you reading the pointless post of your pointless post.
all these movies can be searched, if you really wanted to see them in the first place.
not to say that you're not a positive contributor, but damn... this is pretty pointless."
,OpEx,2010-02-04T07:51Z,"Be green, save some bandwidth.
If you really really need to advertise your releases give the people this link http://thepiratebay.org/user/-jonny-/

And on another note. Posts like this counteracts the built in search function of the site. If everyone did this, tons of irrelevant information would trigger on just about any search terms. I mean, who want's to download a torrent with torrents? Not only do you waste bandwidth but you also loose the ability to rank the torrents by seeders."
[V],-jonny-,2010-02-04T12:28Z,"No, it's not pointless, it's a useful, positive thing and nobody cares about your negative opinion. Go away, goodbye, have a nice life :)"
[V],-jonny-,2010-02-04T14:23Z,"It's not for me, it's for you. They are not oversized, and the quality is much better than 2GB releases, as all the many people who download these releases know. You come here with your cynical bullshit, and call ME a jerk. Take a look at yourself.

I'm giving you something useful and convenient. This list is a good way to discover quality stuuff, and if you're gonna make it about me, you're not worth the time of day. I didn't make the films, the releases or even the torrents, but I'm happy to make a great list of them for you, for free.

I'm not asking you to thank me, because I'm not doing very much here, but if you're not interested in something, how are you so sad that you devote time to it anyway? If you want useless, look in the mirror. God I hate pricks."
,R2/D2,2010-02-04T16:47Z,"I think it's useful. If you are interested in HD-movies I think it's great to have them listed in this way. And, besides, TPB's search engine sometimes do suck."
,jacq222,2010-02-04T19:20Z,"thks jonny-great list is usefull,true that sometimes
tpb search engine is tricky.
and the way you built that list we can go directly
to the page of that movie only.
lot of work here in all these movies-cccp-project-good talking"
,JackLeBoul,2010-02-04T22:58Z,Hey Jonny - Thanks a million. You have always posted good stuff. Always grateful.
,jorge56,2010-02-06T04:01Z,thanks jonny
,1adam1,2010-02-07T05:52Z,wow an absolutely amazing list of films. thanks a bunch!
,sweMezza,2010-02-08T22:08Z,"I agree, thanks for this. Very helpful. Why somebody asked? These are links to scene releases (or similar) and not homemade trial and errors (even though some ppl do great work).

Appreciate it or just don't waste your time. There's plenty of room for everyone.

And yes, sometimes the search engine sucks. Or just is overloaded."
,9seconds4u,2010-02-19T01:06Z,@-jonny- is correct....there is definately a difference in quality between a 1.5-2gb file and a 4-6gb file....i've tested them side by side...i would always choose the higher res file....im just picky about quality....thanks for everything jonny!!
,Alex79uk,2010-02-21T16:05Z,"Thanks for this list. I don't think it's pointless at all. Sometimes I don't know what I want to watch, and it's nice to browse a list like this and pick something out. Good work, mate. "
,01eg,2010-02-22T22:06Z,"pls seed this movie
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4391844/The.Three.Burials.Of.Melquiades.Estrada.720p.BluRay.x264-SiNNERS

[V],-jonny-,2010-02-23T02:11Z,If Three Burials isn't revived in the next week or 2 I'll delete the torrent.
,01eg,2010-02-23T13:21Z,">..I'll delete the torrent.
and, i hope, create new ?"
[V],-jonny-,2010-02-23T18:39Z,"I can't create a torrent of something I don't have. If a torrent is well and truly dead, might as well delete it to save people trying. Will give it a couple weeks to see if anyone's going to reseed."
,Werm,2010-02-26T06:53Z,Jonny is the man!!! I say that in total seriousness. THE MAN!
,allrockedout,2010-03-03T01:02Z,"if you upload some more movies i might seed, your mean"
[V],-jonny-,2010-03-03T03:06Z,"The list is being updated daily...
It doesn't matter who's uploading the torrents."
,Harutik_11,2010-03-14T07:21Z,"Mind uploading Yanni Live! The Concert Event?

[V],-jonny-,2010-04-20T13:15Z,Haha. This isn't about what's in the torrent. It's the list that counts here ;)
,BasicKiller,2010-04-29T16:19Z,"@-jonny- I just came to say, its good to see u back buddy, always appreciated ur uploads"
,warooter,2010-05-01T13:03Z,"That' a massive effort Johny  really appreciated !

p.s. Why download of many torrents is so slow ( around 5-10 kb/s) is there any problems with TPB/Demonoid ?"
[V],-jonny-,2010-05-03T14:12Z,"If your downloads are slow, check your firewall and/or router settings"
,razdhan,2010-05-18T19:25Z,"Hi Buddy!

[V],-jonny-,2010-10-09T12:31Z,I have been unable to edit these lists since July. Hopefully the Edit Torrent function will be fixed soon so I can continue updating!
[V],-jonny-,2010-11-30T15:47Z,"As you can see, the lists are back with regular updates! :)"
