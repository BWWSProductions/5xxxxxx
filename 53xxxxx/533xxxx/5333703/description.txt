           Enjoy a hilarious, once-in-a-lifetime event hosted by          
           Paul Rodriguez introducing some of his favorite fellow         
           comedians. Paul has often been referred to as the              
           ∟Richard Pryor and George Carlin of original             
           comedy↔ within the Hispanic community. He has            
           starred in over 30 films, countless television series and      
           has performed live to well over one million concert goers      
           from coast to coast. Although Paul loves playing New           
           Mexico where he has established a solid fan base, this         
           will mark his first appearance at the historic Lensic          
           Theater. And for this reason, he wants to capture the          
           magic of both evenings in a special dvd presentation...
