,eric.brown,2010-02-03T11:51Z,Thanks for the 720p version! That's worth seeding a long time.
,Mountain66,2010-02-03T13:56Z,It's a RAR. What is the video format? Audio format? Thanks!
,ugly8,2010-02-03T14:45Z,"Lovin' the 720p versions. don't mind the size at all. Those of u who r compaining about rars, simply don't know how 2 use them. Great job TvTeam."

People who post in .rars should say what the file type is, so that others can account for it.  No one was complaining about .rars."
