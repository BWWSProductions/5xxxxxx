The Man from Earth (2007) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/

At his farewell bash in a cabin in the remote woods, Professor John Oldman (David Lee Smith) makes a shocking confession to his fellow scholars: he is actually an immortal who has been living on earth for the past 14,000 years. So begins this thought-provoking sci-fi drama which follows his colleagues as they struggle to figure out whether Oldman is telling the truth or merely deranged. A long-running project of STAR TREK and TWILIGHT ZONE scribe Jerome Bixby, the film's screenplay was finally completed on his deathbed in 1998.

David Lee Smith, John Billingsley, Ellen Crawford
