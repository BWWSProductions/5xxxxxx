,theone_nr,2010-02-04T09:07Z,Indeed this release is REAL but framerate STUTTER !!! Waiting for a PROPER release ! Anyway TNX ! 
,ericv1984,2010-02-04T11:31Z,If the world is one big family then that means we start war with out own family? Or marry our own family members? Idiot.
,zushigreg,2010-02-04T16:09Z,"Yeah, I can see the stutter in the sample. It is not terrible, but it is annoying . . . But why is it there? Does it have to do with a 3-D version being converted into a 2-D version -- dropping frames incorrectly? Or an underpowered PC somewhere in the mix of doing the transcoding and dropping frames?"
,Orob,2010-02-04T16:52Z,"No matter what some selfproclamed lunatics write, this verion of Avatar is worthwhile to sit down with a few nice drinks and watch.
Thanks raymondhome"
,madtown4,2010-02-04T17:05Z,"@Orob i think it's best to listen to the comments , the other day some one was saying that day breakers tc was out sync the whole movie. then some one said no it's fine down load it . so i did , guess what it was out of sync . so fuck the guy who said it was fine . do you get my drift !!!!!!!!"
,Jonny5o,2010-02-04T23:11Z,Do we really need an IMDB link for this one? 
,zushigreg,2010-02-05T00:28Z,"Thanks to raymondhome for uploading this. Again, though, about the stutter, I seem to recall that even during the showing at the theater, I could see stutter. This was at a digital IMAX version. It bothered me then too. Some scenes have no stutter, especially those with no CG. Others though, especially heavily-CG ones with lots of motion, the characters do jump from one position to the next seemingly skipping several frames that should have been rendered."
