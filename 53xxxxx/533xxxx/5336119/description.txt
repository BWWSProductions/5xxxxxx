Original Air Dateâ€”1 December 2004
To the gang's surprise, Steve's sister Angie has dated Kelso. Even her promise not to do it again is 

broken after just one try from the irresistible flirter, or rather got her in bed even without having 

drinks. Kitty suggests to Jackie to console Steve with lovingly baked cookies from his girl-friend, 

about as realistic as teaching a rhino ballet. Michael triumphs to have nailed every basement boy's 

sister, not counting Fez's still in their native jungle, an embarrassing sting even when repeated by 

Eric again and again. Despite one of Red's rare compliments for his shop, Hyde's lack of scruples 

extends even to record advice for Kitty. Donna doubts her radio rating when she realizes Fez has been 

calling with fake voices, then refuses to make publicity for Red's shop, instead raging on air against 

its calendar with scantily dressed girls, but the responses are revealing.

package leaves nothing unwrapped. The girls are flattered when Kitty invites them to help out the 

stuck-up 'Ladies of Point Place' (LOPPs) with their height of the year, the Christmas party, but angry 

because the boys couldn't care less, Jackie is furious Hyde even reneges on his promise to attend in 

favor of boyish basement toy-games. Posh Patty Ryals marches in to take charge instead of Kitty 

because of an incident in 1963, 'Santa' Bob fondly remembers dating Patty. Red catches the boys 

playing, but with rare seasonal mildness lets them bring the toys to the community center, forcing him 

and Kitty to stall...

wants a pact, and is promised one 'after' getting Hyde out of his- Eric makes the family tell Angie 
about Michael's craziest stunts, like gluing himself to the fridge and inventing 'car 

skiing' till she dumps the innocent boy, whose miserable reaction touches even Hyde, who asks Angie to
