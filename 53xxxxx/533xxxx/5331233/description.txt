Possible problem on the road to war with Iran -- deal between Europe and Iran to exchange unprocessed uranium for manufactured nuclear fuel rods closer to happening.
Iran is in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
U.S. is NOT in compliance with with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty because of refusal to aid in peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Israel is a "rogue nation" as regards with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, because they have nukes and have refused to sign the treaty.
Governments [local/state/national] preparing to use the scare tactic of cutting services to make the populace more accepting of new, more expansive taxes.
China says it's finding gold bars with tungsten cores that are traceable back to Ft. Knox and an American smelting company.
A general strike being organized through grassroots efforts for the US on April 15 - 18.

...and that's just in the 1st hour!


Mike manages to present powerful, persuasive stuff without screaming and yelling.
Please give his show a listen.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.

================================================================

Mike Rivero launched What Really Happened [initially called Rancho Runamukka] as a subpage on his business web site in 1993 asking pointed questions about the death of White House Deputy Council Vincent Foster.
As more and more investigations revealed more government deceptions, the project grew in size and eventually moved to its own domain [whatreallyhappened.com] where it resides today.
His WRH website is among the top ten ranked daily political news sites on the Internet, with a global readership in the millions.  What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.
Rivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening.
