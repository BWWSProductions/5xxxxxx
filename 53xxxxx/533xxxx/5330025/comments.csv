where is the rest of this documentary? while some of this may be true, I for one have seen a miracle before my eyes, of a man healed of stomach ulcers, medically verified too! I would suggest that we all dont just go be the things we see but rather by believing the Bible... that cant go wrong!"

CONSTANTINE WAS THE SUN WORSHIPING EMPEROR WITH NO UNDERSTANDING OF JEWISH OR ?CHRISTIAN? PHILOSOPHY THAT INVENTED ?CHRISTIAN? DOCTRINE FOR PURELY POLITICAL REASONS

After the death of his father in 306, Constantine became King of Britain, Gaul and Spain, and then, after a series of victorious battles, Emperor of the Roman Empire.

CONSTANTINE WAS THE HEAD OF SOL INVICTUS ,A MONOTHIEST SUN WORSHIPER.

Sol Invictus (?Unconquered Sun?) was the Roman state-supported sun god created by the emperor Aurelian in 274 and continued, overshadowing other Eastern cults in importance, until the abolition of paganism under Theodosius I.on February 27, 390.
Constantine decreed (March 7, 321) dies Solis?day of the sun, ?Sunday??as the Roman day of rest
On the venerable day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed.
The Romans held a festival on December 25 of Dies Natalis Solis Invicti, ?the birthday of the unconquered sun.?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_invictus

CONSTANTINE WAS NOT A ?CHRISTIAN? AND NOT BAPTISED UNTIL HIS DEATH!! HE WAS BAPTISED AN ARIAN(MITHRIAN)

He chose the Arianizing bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia, bishop of the city where he lay dying, as his baptizer.Constantine died soon after at a suburban villa called Achyron, on the last day of the fifty-day festival of Pentecost directly following Easter, on 22 May 337(Arianism is considered heretical by the modern church)
