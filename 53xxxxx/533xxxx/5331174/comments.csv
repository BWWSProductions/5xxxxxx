Thanks For Informing.
Yes, Unfortunately Audio Is Out Of Sync.

Try ""mkvmerge"" And Set Audio Delay To Approx -2100ms.
You Will Get .mkv Output.

Use ""Yamb"" For .mp4 Output.


I was Wondering Over 200 Download Finished, Nobody Complained About This.
What's Wrong People?
Please Do Comment.
