Dennis and Gnasher, new cartoon to cbbc (uk) from the Beano comic. Good quality rips although colours came out slightly washed in convertion. please let me know if you would like to see more, they are cartainly keeping our kids happy untill they bother to bring it out on dvd.
Ive added other trackers incase anyone wants to share it on other sites, I know how people like ahashare like to pass other peoples work of as their own.
Please note should this series come out on dvd I will stop sharing it as this is only intended to fill the gap untill a top quality dvd is released and I also have no intention of affecting the future of a quality series
