I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

[V],smbdownload,2010-02-04T14:56Z,"yeah - been in a bit of a Pearl Jam mood lately :-)

I haven't even listened to this show yet, but Warren never disappoints 

rock on brother !"
[V],smbdownload,2010-02-04T14:57Z,been COLD here [NY] but not too much snow this year
,l214l,2010-02-06T23:00Z,"On Wild Horses, Warren has Grace Potter singing with him - up until then I'd not heard of her.  This sort of discovery is one of the things I love about torrents. It wasn't until I heard Warren Haynes being thanked on someone or others cd years ago that I followed up on him and found this wealth of music he's contributed to.

TPB has two or three offerings from Grace Potter & the Nocturnals.  I'm listening to one now and I certainly haven't made a mistake getting it.  Thanks, once again for your work doing all this smb.

A post script is that this concert took place a week after the Haiti earthquake. Jamaica is relatively close to Haiti, so I would think there would have been quite a few thinking of that place?
