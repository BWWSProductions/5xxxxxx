"Jamie and Alex stay in a large house in the mountains near Lake Arrowhead in 1998. They experience evil paranormal activity. Movement caught on camera. This footage has been in storage since Aug 2000."

909 Experiment was made about 9-10 years ago by a film maker named Wayne Smith. To this day the movie is still unreleased, and so there is very little information on it. Hunting around, I have managed to find this from the producer himself:

"I made this movie 9 years ago and was not able to get distribution at the time. I had 1 screening in Santa Monica Ca., in July of 2000 and audience was "freaked out" --huge success. It's a very cool "Paranormal Activity" meets "The Shining" kind of movie. -But still no one picked it up due to the "reality" concept. --Today that concept is widley accepted. 

A few copies have been floating around Hollywood, and I believe my concept or premise was used in the current hit film "Paranormal Activity" There is nothing I can do about that, but I can say mine was officially the first."

Apart from encoding it to DivX, I have not edited this in any way from the source that I found it.

This is my first upload, the encoding all seems to have gone well, so I hope everything is fine. If there's any problems with the torrent please let me know!
