,Weary76,2010-10-03T10:46Z,"Was this really made about 10 years ago?
If so, this is definitly way ahead of Paranormal Activity. I've only watched a few bits to see if it was a real film (which it is) and almost everything I saw was completely similar to Paranormal Activity. I've even actually heard them use those words. I think it might be slightly boring at times, but two huge thumbs up for coming up with the idea first."
,stole_it,2010-10-24T07:45Z,"The man who made Paranormal Activity stated that he was inspired to write the script for his film after he moved into his house in Ranco Santa Fe ( a suburb of San Diego, CA).  The house was brand new and still settling into the foundation making strange noises in the night time.  I haven't watched this film yet, but I will soon.  While many times people in hollywood try to CASE (Copy And Steal Everything) it is still possible for two film-makers to come up with similar ideas, independent from one another."
