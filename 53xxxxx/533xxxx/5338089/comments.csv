,adjoy,2010-06-11T17:17Z,LOL is there any way to change Russian language to English language?
,ncc46537,2010-10-27T13:51Z,"At a certain point in the installation it'll have a drop-box list with 'gibberish' as the default.
Choose English instead.
The installation, on the other hand, can't be changed to English."

Contains a virus called Hupigon which is coded in Borland Delphi. The specific strain is Hupigon (v).


Hupigon variants have several different types of features. The following list is an example of some:

  â€¢ It allows others to access the computer
  â€¢ Allows for recording with the user's webcam
  â€¢ Can make the user's computer to attack various servers
  â€¢ Send victim's computer messages
  â€¢ Has rootkit functionality so it has a stealth component that hides files
  â€¢ Create logs from keystrokes, steals passwords, and sends this information to remote servers"
