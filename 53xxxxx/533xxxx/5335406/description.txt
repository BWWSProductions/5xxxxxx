David Lewis Anderson, born in Weirton, West Virginia is a physicist whose interests are in spacetime physics, special relativity and global community service. Anderson received degrees in engineering, physics and philosophy as a student graduating with honors from West Virginia University, California State University, the Joint-Services Military College and the University of Minnesota. 

He was employed at a young age by the United States Air Force conducting advanced research and development at the prestigious Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert. He later founded an organization call the TTRC, an advanced time-technology research laboratory located on Long Island, New York in the United States of America.

During that time he proposed several new detail on theories for reversing time at sub-light speeds and laid the foundations for what would later become known as time-warped field theory, an approach that modeled and described how to use the natural forces of inertial frame dragging for power generation and to create contained and controllable fields of closed time-like curves. 

Anderson provided one of the first comprehensive overviews of the historical views of time, time control and time travel in the documentary "Time Travel - Journeys into Time." His ideas were later applied for the development of high performance time reactor systems for energy production and time technology research at what is known today as the Anderson Institute.

Anderson is the President and CEO of Anderson Multinational LLC, the parent corporation of the Anderson Institute and several other companies, headquartered in Rochester, New York. He holds multiple patents relating to time technology and also for time reactor designs. His published works include more than thirty articles and video lectures on spacetime physics, time control technologies and methods and the philosophy of time. He has appeared on numerous radio and television shows worldwide including Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell in the USA. 

Anderson is also President and CEO of the World Genesis Foundation whose mission is to â€œleave no child without hope for the futureâ€ and is active as a speaker and Ambassador for Youth for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and also for the Romanian government.

Time Control Technologies and Methods is an overview presentation of basic information and a comparison of ten different approaches to controlling time. Each approach is compared based upon its potential for time travel to the future and past, transport of matter or information, and viability based upon present or near states of technology, materials and power needs.

Time Technology & Research

Host:
 Art Bell
 
Guests:
 David Lewis Anderson 
 
Joining Art Bell for the entire 4-hour program, physicist Dr. David Anderson discussed the state of time technology from his research, as well as other labs around the world. He recapped his work from 2002, when he last appeared with Art on the show. At that juncture, his team had created small time warp fields that he said could accelerate time by 300% within the field, as well as reversing time. He described the initiation of a time warp field as quite spectacular to witness, "between the combinations of different chemical reagents and high energy lasers we use to excite or initiate a time warp field...a lot of light, a lot of energy."

Since 2002, the effects have increased by "two orders of magnitudes," both in time acceleration and retardation rates, and living organisms have been successfully tested in the warp fields, he detailed. By regenerating "closed timelike curves" (bending spacetime so time loops back on itself) we're finding it "just as easy to move backwards in time as well as forward," Anderson explained.

Currently countries such as Japan, China, and especially India have been experimenting with time technologies, Anderson reported. Through a device called the Temporal Tremor Detector (TTD), his team is able to track such experiments by observing disruptions in the spacetime fabric, he said. 

As time technology becomes further developed, moral and ethical issues are arising, he pointed out. Benefits of the technology include accurate historical studies of the past, but on the negative side, we could experience "Time Wars," with deliberate destruction of parts of the timeline. Anderson advocated for more transparency and disclosure of the technology, so the public can have input on how it's used.
