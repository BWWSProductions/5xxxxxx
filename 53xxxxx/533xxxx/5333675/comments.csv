,clwilson1977,2010-02-04T03:02Z,This Torrent does have seeds not sure why it is saying zero.
,fredfan,2010-02-04T17:31Z,"That's almost certainly because TPB largely doesn't use its own trackers anymore, relying on your adding trackers from open source or other websites for that.  The ""magnet"" function has superseded it, here on TPB, at least.

I haven't DL'ed this one from here since I had it from another source long ago, but I'm sure it rocks if it uses the DJFred method of encoding.  A STELLAR CHOICE from the wilsonizer...this movie is fucking fantastic in either the comedy or horror categories, mostly comedy.  GET SOME!!!  And THANKS!!!"
,clwilson1977,2010-02-05T02:36Z,oh ok.  thanks yeah of course use freds encoding.  I have known him for about 2 or so years now.  He started me out using clone dvd.  After i got back from Iraq this was preferred method.  I like it much better takes a little longer but is well worth it.  I can't wait to see this movie i haven't watched it yet.  
,Zombie_Flanders,2010-02-13T19:17Z,"Thanks for the u/l!  
I'm not exactly new at this process, and I am no pro either....but I cannot get this to burn.  I have tried 3 times and created 3 coasters. Nero completes both layers, then gives the following (last few entries from Nero history log):
1:54:11 AM	#37 Text 0 File DVDR.cpp, Line 5762
	Drive: SONY     DVD RW DRU-810A 
	Book Type request [gen]: DVD-ROM, write to EEPROM
	Changing the Book Type was finished successfully, return code 0

1:54:11 AM	#38 Phase 38 File APIProgress.cpp, Line 276
	Burn process failed at 2.4x (3,324 KB/s)

1:54:11 AM	#39 Text 0 File AudioCompilationImpl.cpp, Line 867
	DRM: DRM burn session terminated.

1:54:11 AM	#40 Text 0 File AudioCompilationImpl.cpp, Line 896
	DRM: Closing entire DRM handling.

Any suggestions?   Thanks!"
,KWYJIBO_MEX,2010-02-15T21:01Z,"hi, about the audio (dolby, dts, sdds) is correct???
this DVD contains dts and sdds??? thanks"
,fredfan,2010-02-16T15:03Z,@Zombie_Flanders:  Sony drive...need I say more?  Google it.  Four letter words usually bring trouble...
,Zombie_Flanders,2010-02-16T16:51Z,"@fredfan - I'm sure there are better drives out there than this one, but I usually have great luck with it.  Until this d/l I hadn't created a coaster in over a year, and I have burned other movies since trying this one, so my problem can't be the drive."
,clwilson1977,2010-02-16T21:49Z,Try to use clone dvd to burn with.  Or img Burn.  You are only person that has said has a problem with it.  I will look into it 
,Zombie_Flanders,2010-03-03T01:03Z,"@clwilson1977 - I used Img Burn and it completed the task.  The movie will play, but no special features work.  The menus are there and are interactive, but when I select ""Deleted Scenes"" (or any other special features) and press enter, the disc stops.
I cannot reccommend this torrent to other users as it has been nothing but problems."
,MC-Face,2010-03-06T01:10Z,the two first scenes are missing including the opening credits....
