Hooverphonic - No More Sweet Music [2005] (CBR 320) [Dodecahedron]

More Sweet Music + No More Sweet Music (2005)

No More Sweet Music is a double album by the Belgian band Hooverphonic. It is the group's fifth studio album, and was released in 2005. The first disc is titled More Sweet Music and contains 11 songs performed in the familiar Hooverphonic style, whilst the second disc contains the very same 11 songs in their remixed versions by Alex Callier, and is titled NO More Sweet Music, a title indicative of the nature of the remixed versions, which also underlines the notable difference in style between the two discs. The singles released from this album are "You Hurt Me", "Wake Up", "Dirty Lenses" and "We All Float". The title track "No More Sweet Music" contains samples from the Henry Mancini penned "Lujon" from the album "Mr. Lucky Goes Latin".

A 2 disc Dual Disc version was also released later in 2005. The DVD sides contain all tracks in Dolby Surround 5.1 Stereo, plus two documentaries ("making of" and interviews with Hooverphonic members) and the music videos of "Wake Up", and "You Hurt Me" (both original and remix versions). Hooverphonic's main composer and programmer Alex Callier composed 40 tracks for No More Sweet Music. The 11 selected were not necessarily the best but were selected because they worked well together. Some of the remaining tracks were used in their 2007 album, The President of the LSD Golf Club.
