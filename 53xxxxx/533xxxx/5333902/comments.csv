[T],Emery2010,2010-02-05T03:13Z,"DVDRip, used retail dvdr, hardcoded subs for non english parts only
i thought video turned out real decent for only 700 mib"
,anupamwww,2010-02-10T15:11Z,subtitles??
,gratefulforthis,2010-02-12T13:58Z,"Only 1 seed!

Why bother? :)"
,gratefulforthis,2010-02-12T14:00Z,"More now.

I hope this is good as I'm only downloading as FXG's has no foreign subs.

Is this comparable? "
,gratefulforthis,2010-02-13T01:26Z,"OMG! Worst movie ever!

This rip:

A=8 (can't really fault it)
V=7 (perfectly watchable)
M=0

I just wanting some good entertainment with good FX. I was fully expecting a shallow (yet forgivable) storyline but this was far far worse than that.

Well the script, acting and corniness of the movie was more far fetched than the special effects. Now that's some feat!

This was a bad movie that managed to get worse as it went on!"
