this looks like crap, sorry.
i have seasons 1-3 that are mp4 and they look amazing and they are from holyroses then i thought there was hope at getting season 4 and you ruined it."

These look fine, no-one gets as good a quality as Holy-Roses and if you can find the links to his conversions post them up. Until then stop being such a whiny bitch and do the conversion yourself.

but seriously.. this is completely out of sync..
Problem is that in certain episodes the video plays slower than the audio.. weird. :/"
