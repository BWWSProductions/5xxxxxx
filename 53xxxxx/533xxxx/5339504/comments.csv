,thunderbum,2010-02-06T22:31Z,"@ BarrySoetoro: wondering what you meant by INB4 Maria. Seen you reference this a few times.

,booboo332,2010-02-07T07:46Z,"It is a reference to sistromo, whom he calls ""Maria""

A quick google search reveals the email address maria.g.sistromo@state.or.us and this may be where he got the name."

I'm wondering about Friday's unemployment report. Subcategory stats seemed to be higher all-around, and yet the headline rate was only 9.7% How'd they get that number? It wasn't an uptick in gov't employment, was it? -apparently, Rush sheds a little light on it in this show. *eager*"
,thunderbum,2010-02-08T03:20Z,"@booboo: thanks for clearing that up for me 

Isn't it hilarious how the lefty loons & trolls never seem to get tired of trying to get a rise out of us?

(singing) ""that's entertainment""!"
,booboo332,2010-02-08T05:49Z,"Truly.  Nothing seems to drive them crazier than just laughing at them.  They operate primarily from their emotions and that shall be their downfall.

""Sometimes you just gotta laugh."" ;)"
