Blue Wonder Power Milk (1998) - Review by Allmusic (4.5/5 stars)

After an extensive European tour with artists such as Massive Attack, Morcheeba and Apollo 440, and a tour opening for Fiona Apple in the United States in 1997, the band released Blue Wonder Power Milk in 1998 with 18-year-old Arnaert on vocals. A marked departure from their debut, the album is driven less by breakbeats and samples and more by organic string elements and traditional song structures.

The single "Club Montepulciano" was a hit in native Belgium and a minor college hit in the U.S., while "Renaissance Affair" was featured in the North American commercial campaign for the new Volkswagen Vapor Beetle. "This Strange Effect" and "Eden" were both featured in American cell phone commercials-- "This Strange Effect" for the Motorola SLVR, and most recently in 2006, "Eden" for the Cingular 8525. "Eden" was also used in the 1998 slasher film "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer."At the time of their release, both songs were also featured in two separate third season episodes of La Femme Nikita. Shortly afterward, Sarah Brightman recorded a cover of "Eden" on her 1998 album "Eden".
