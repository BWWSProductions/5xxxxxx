,TedLilly,2010-02-04T22:36Z,thanks for the up 
,nameskay,2010-02-04T23:49Z,"it doesnt skip on mine @saskdavid i can only assume its either a codec issue or the type of player which you are using. its usually the case.
try either vlc or divx"
,tvwatcher,2010-02-05T02:31Z,"Yeah, this torrent skips, freezes, and restarts - and when it does play the sound is out of sync.  I tried it in Quicktime and Divx, same thing both times. "
,diskmeedel,2010-02-05T07:14Z,Use VLC not quicktime!
,iSzSzo,2010-02-05T08:15Z,"Appreciate the effort (especially since EZTV seems to have dropped this program) but, file is out-of-sync. It's apparent from the get-go... when viewing the scenes from last ep. FWIW, Video would be watchable if this were not the case. Tried several media players including VLC (my regular default player), QT, and DivX. Nada. :("
,OyB,2010-02-05T09:27Z,"Tried using VLC, adjusting with j/k on your keyboard to get video and sound is in sync? "
[T],Robston,2010-02-05T13:50Z,"Thanks.

Audio adjustment needed. I set an audio delay of 350ms which seemed to work."
,juneaugust,2010-02-06T05:55Z,Thank you very much.
,iSzSzo,2010-02-06T06:57Z,"@Robston:
Thanks for the tip! Really appreciate it. Never had to go there before... lucky I guess! ;-) Specifics... using VLC, open up Preferences (select ""All"") Basic won't do, select Audio and look for ""Audio desynchronization compensation"". As Robston notes, 350ms works. :-)"
,Lonsman,2010-02-06T07:11Z,"Would somebody that can use a video editor, pls sync the sound and re-torrent? I can only watch on my DVD player.
Thanks!"
,Lonsman,2010-02-06T09:29Z,"Really, if you can't prepare a proper file, pls don't bother. This one is SHYTE! Low rez and out of sync. In short--F**king Useless."
,iHacker0325,2010-02-06T23:15Z,"@Lonsman
