,Toimu,2010-02-04T04:09Z,"Trying to use the Setup.exe gives me the same error as if I downloaded this from the developers.

There is a WinRAR file 195,154 KB named Setup1 with 207 files in it.  Most named dlc1_(something) or dlc2_(something).  I think those might go into:

Borderlands > WillowGame > Localization > INT folder

There is a Razor1911 folder with a Borderlands icon that I guess I'll replace my old one with in my Binaries folder after I've use this crack for patch 1.2.1."
,Toimu,2010-02-04T04:18Z,"There is a WinRAR file 195,154 KB named Setup1 that has a ShippingPCWillowGame.exe application in it.  I extracted all 207 files and ran this .exe and got the following error:

This application has failed to start because wxmsw28u_core_vc_custom.dll was not found.  Re-installing the application may fix this problem."
,Toimu,2010-02-04T05:30Z,"Ok, I've got it working (even online).  You have to put all the 207 files in the correct folders yourself.

All the .int files go into:

Borderlands > WillowGame > Localization > INT folder

---

All the .esn files go into:

Borderlands > WillowGame > Localization > ESN folder

---

All the .deu files go into:

Borderlands > WillowGame > Localization > DEU folder

---

All the .fra files go into:

Borderlands > WillowGame > Localization > FRA folder

---

All the .ita files go into:

Borderlands > WillowGame > Localization > FRA folder"
,kevoo_11,2010-02-04T13:52Z,"What about the rest of those 207 files?  I noticed a few .upk files, .u files, at least 1 .bin file, and a couple .exe files.   

Should we ignore them"
,kevoo_11,2010-02-04T14:00Z,"Also,

After we move around all those files do we use the borderlands.exe file that game with this?  If someone who's figured this out happens along please write a small walkthrough to get this working...I'm stumped.  "

,Toimu,2010-02-04T16:33Z,"Sorry all, I keep getting Data Base Error when I try to post so I can not finish the directions.  I was hoping it was because I just had posted too much in one day.  But I'm still getting that error...  maybe I should type it out and not copy/paste."
,Toimu,2010-02-04T16:42Z,"I unRAR'ed the files into a folder to keep track of which ones I put in the correct place, and which ones I haven't yet.  Here is where the 207 files go:

All .int go into the INT folder.

All .esn go into the ESN folder.

All .deu go into the DEU folder.

All .fra go into the FRA folder.

All .ita go into the ITA folder.

You have to do searches to find the location of the other about 50 files.  Most somewhere in the CookedPC folder or sub folders.

Also 2 files are missed named.  They replace the old files in the CookedPC folder.

GlobalShaderCachePCD3DSM3
needs to be renamed:
GlobalShaderCache-PC-D3D-SM3

RefShaderCachePCD3DSM3
needs to be renamed:
RefShaderCache-PC-D3D-SM3

There is an app named ShippingPCWillowGame.exe that I didn't use because I didn't find one to replace.  You don't need it it seems.

There is a Razor1911 folder with a Borderlands.exe that you use to replace the old one in your Binaries folder.  Just click that new Borderlands.exe and play the game.  Easy as 1,2,3...207!"
,Toimu,2010-02-04T16:47Z,"The above post are the complete directions on how I got the game to work.  Please delete all my other posts!

I am not a programmer.  This too me about an hour to figure out myself.  Even with how I did it, it will still take a while for someone to do.  If you put 1 of those 207 files in the wrong place, the game will not work!"

,xellb14,2010-02-05T23:30Z,"for all a U guys who wanna make this shit work - toimu is 100% correct, i'll just add some hints not to work your fingers off to the bone when u use the searcher.
1.st thing is that if u happen to miss 1 or couple of files u will see them in a shitty floating window when u try and start this game, ABOVE - where the file should be and BELOW where u have dropped it. if u r lazy, just relocate all of them as the pc says. the easier way is putting them before this floats appear :).
so the .deu, int, esn, fra and ita extensions are found, i will add some more.

MOST    .upk   to WillowGame\CookedPC\

dlc_1***.upk dlc_2***.upk to\WillowGame\CookedPC\Patch\
menumap_LOC_***.upk  to \WillowGame\CookedPC\Maps\Menu_Map\

,NanoEntity,2010-02-06T04:41Z,"Someone should make a damn torrent with all the files extracted places in all the correct folders and paths and post it here.

So we can just download the torrent copy all files and overwrite the directory structure."

Any thoughts on how to fix it?"

,Toimu,2010-02-09T04:33Z,"xMusik and Krasotkin,

Error 1:

Do a search for GuidCache.upk and delete all you find.  Then go to your RAR file from this download and put GuidCache.upk in:

C:\Program Files\2K Games\Borderlands\WillowGame\CookedPC

---

Error 2:

Do a search for RefShaderCache and delete all you find.  You might find it written as:

RefShaderCachePCD3DSM3.upk
or
RefShaderCache-PC-D3D-SM3.upk

Then go to your RAR file from this download and put:

RefShaderCachePCD3MDSM3.upk

here:

C:\Program Files\2k games\gearbox software\borderlands\WillowGame\CookedPC

and rename to:

RefShaderCache-PC-D3D-SM3.upk
