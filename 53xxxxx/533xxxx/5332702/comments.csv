,thank_u_h264_team,2010-02-03T22:29Z,Bro this week on white collar and human target?
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-03T22:51Z,"White Collar is encoded this morning and goes after Chinese movie. However, White C. has been dropped out of the schedule because of very low interest.
Human Target is pure confusion. I watch Canadian airing on Sunday, group NoTV have released XviD next day.
BUT, 720p wasn't released on Monday (last week DIMENSION released a 720p of Canadian airing).
In USA, Human Target is scheduled for tonight, but even if tomorrow 720p pop-up, I will not encode it. I am sick of shit like this, and if 720p is not released at at least on same day as XviD, neither would I my H264."
