half-hour horror movies. The first segment, Ã´Rattle RattleÃ¶, 
tells the story of a young woman who is pursued by an evil 
other-worldly being.The second movie, Ã´SteelÃ¶, concerns a 
young man who agrees to take the sister of his boss out on 
a blind date, drawing him into a world more frightening than 
he ever dreamed possible.The third and final episode, 
Ã´The InheritanceÃ¶, is a supernatural tale of a woman 
and her young son, scarred by abuse and psychological trauma.
