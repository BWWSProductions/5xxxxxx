help please?"
,glock25,2010-02-23T11:50Z,"torrent works. this book is a bit ironic as it mentions becoming an elite hacker, and getting linux, but 99% of the book is windows script kiddie stuff. trojans? LMAO - even the screen shots look like they where done in vista.

nonetheless, if you are going to acquire this publication, then this torrent is the way to do it... for free!

thanks for the upload, download was fast, will seed the hell out of this as i personally believe the original author is ripping people off by charging for information like this.

1/5 of the way through the book and we're (just) being told how to change the boot options in bios. 

don't expect to become some k-rad 31337 h4xx0r ninja from reading this, even as a reference guide it is weak.

but download and seed so that those without a clue don't get scammed by the author."

You said it all bro.. The author charges 18-20$ for this.. Although some beginners might find it a bit useful. ;)"
