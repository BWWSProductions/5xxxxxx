Not A Pretty Girl is the sixth studio album released by singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco on her own record label, Righteous Babe Records. Cited by many fans as her finest work[citation needed], the 1995 album extended the punk-edged folksinger's early formula of acoustic guitar and drums to a passionate crescendo. On subsequent records, DiFranco would add electric guitar, horns, band members and guest musicians.
