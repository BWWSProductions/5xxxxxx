Plot:
Oenophiles have SIDEWAYS and BOTTLE SHOCK; now their beer-loving counterparts can claim a film as their own. This truly American tale looks at the struggle between big breweries (Coors, Miller, and Budweiser) and their smaller competition (such as Dogfish Head) as the companies fight for shelf space and bar orders. Directed by Anat Baron, this documentary not only looks at the beer industry, but also examines the plight of small businesses in America.
