where in sa you from man? "
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-03T13:11Z,"@africool: I have done American Idol but, believe me, it was so bad, really ugly picture.
I was ashamed with and deleted the file immediately. Namely, I was tempted by the fact that from this season on, scene groups have made 720p of American Idol available... and I have watched every damn season so far, including German franchise DSDS and a relative, British X factor. Let say that I am a - fan (in wider sense).

I am telling you that you better understand what I must give as an answer: I cannot.
H264 is superior to any video compression ever invented, H264 is magical on low bit-rates - BUT - low bit-rate H264 and LIVE events (lot of people, staging, lightning) doesn't come together - in small file-sizes (at extremely low bit-rates). It looks disturbingly horrible. 

I can, however use higher bit-rates, but the final file-size would be much bigger and therefore all work would lost his true meaning. 

I hope you have understand my decision."
