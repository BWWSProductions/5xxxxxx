Frank Sinatra does bossa nova - that's right, folks.  

"No other American pop star [Frank Sinatra] would so thoroughly immerse himself in the world of bossa; he not only recorded two whole albums' worth of the stuff but sacrificed his signature stylistics in order to more smoothly fit into the new vernacular.  The two albums were Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim (1967) and Sinatra-Jobim (1969), although the later was never released."  - Will Friedwald, Sinatra! The Song is You. p. 426
