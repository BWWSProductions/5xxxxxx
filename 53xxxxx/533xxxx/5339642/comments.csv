,rob22391,2010-11-05T06:42Z,how do you get this working
,aj2012,2011-03-30T08:07Z,how do this work? do i have to burn it to a cd first??
,Mrmur,2011-04-23T19:32Z,"To run these files first mount them through a program such as daemon tools (lite is free), then open up the files on the disc (right click and ""open in file explorer"".  There should be a Setup file (any disc works).  This will install the thinkwell application along with apple quicktime.  Once you get this opened, choose to work offline then, when in the course, it will say which disc to use.  Mount that disc, run setup, and you may now use the files associated with that disc.  Good luck!"
,Mrmur,2011-04-23T19:34Z,"Sorry about that last part.  You only have to mount the disc that each part says, but you don't have to go to setup again.  It works either way but one is much simpler."
,shiva1996,2011-05-30T08:54Z,thanks so much but the biology cd 3 bin doesnt work properly. i changed it to an iso image and then burnt it but it says invalid disc. i tried mounting it to a drive but it says not a valid bin file if only you could just re upload that. anyone have any idea what to do

IMAGINE HOW MUCH GUTS dohduhdah MUST HAVE REQUIRED TO UPLOAD ALL THIS VIDEOS.




If we want to eat all up then it is not possible. 



So don't be rushy in downloading all the TTC videos.



Wait for a time and let few Users download it.



Then let those few users Seed it and then few other decided Users can download it. 




Then both the few Users will Seed it and next batch of Few Users would Download it.




Then all these Users can Seed it and others can Download it.




So PLEASE SO SOME RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS dohuhdah & piratebay, and PLEASE SEED!!!!!"
