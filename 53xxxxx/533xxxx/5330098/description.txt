David Luger goes off to Budapest and look what he brought us as a present. The movie stars Luisa De Marcos, Julie Silver, Jessica Mar, Charlotte, Romana, and Janet.
Scene One:This is the hot scene with the cover girl. She is the first thing we see and she is on a balcony of an apartment outside Pest, (the town on the South side of the River, with Buda on the North.) She has a rangy Latin look and is an awesome body. She stands, bends over, and shows her perfect ass. Then she strips part of the bikini. Next we have Julie Silver and she does essentially the same moves. And then we watch the two of them on a couch and this is a very deep and sensual lesbian scene with lots of pussy lapping. In a mirror we see a guy, and he approaches and then the girls start sucking him and he fucks first one and then the other and this is very intense and the scene ends up with him giving a good load and then a cum swap.

Scene Two:Jessica Mar is a blond bandit and she has amazing tits and ass, and, as it turns out, quite good cocksucking skills. She takes on two guys and they lick her and rim her and finger her clit and she sucks their dicks one at a time and then together and then they start fucking her and she canÃ¢Â€â„¢t seem to get it deep enough in her ass and then one of them fucks her while she sucks the other and then they switch around. Great cum shots.

Scene Three: Charlotte also takes on two guys and they lick her and rim her and finger her clit and she sucks their dicks one at a time and then together and then they start fucking her and they cum in her mouth.

Scene Four: Romana (aka Kirsty, Cristy) also takes on two guys and they lick her and rim her and finger her clit and she sucks their dicks one at a time and then together and then they start fucking her and they cum in her mouth and on her tits.

Scene Five:Janet and Steve have a very romantic scene with a lot of kissing and necking and then foreplay and then he licks her ass, fucks it, and cums all over it.
