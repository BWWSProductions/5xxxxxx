This is the same software as the Bouganville posting, except that it is in English. It is the full set with the second Real Drums 2 Disk as a supplement.
The only (but HUGE) difference is that these two files are in a standard .iso disk image format. This should make it much easier to use just about any disk burning sofware- PC, Linux or Mac - to effortlessly burn the two disks for installation. 
I managed to install the originals only after converting to this .iso format (which was difficult and took a lot of time). So, considering the number of complaints I read on the Bouganville posting, I decided to up these converted .iso files.

No serial required!

Clean. Check it out for yourselves.
