,g1g4f3erz,2010-02-15T01:35Z,"hello, 
mister HolyRoses could you tell me the settings to convert my movies into psp/ipod compatible just like yours?
because i can only convert them for one device at a time. wich means double the time and space. Thank you id appreciate it."

Get SUPER converter, it's the best and virus-free (trust me my teacher at school told me about it) and the settings just put it to MP4. "
