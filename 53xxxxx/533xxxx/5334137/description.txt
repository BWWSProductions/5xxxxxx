  Norma and Arthur Lewis, a suburban couple with a young child, receive a
simple wooden box as a gift, which bears fatal and irrevocable consequences.
A mysterious stranger, delivers the message that the box promises to bestow
upon its owner $1 million with the press of a button. But, pressing this
button will simultaneously cause the death of another human being somewhere
in the world; someone they don't know. With just 24 hours to have the box in
their possession, Norma and Arthur find themselves in the cross-hairs of a 
startling moral dilemma and must face the true nature of their humanity.
