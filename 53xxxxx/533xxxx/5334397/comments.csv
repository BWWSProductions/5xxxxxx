,danielombana,2010-05-10T23:19Z,who has a keycode for this program ?plz
,royston51,2011-03-23T02:02Z,thank you.  this is hard to find but so useful.  eBooks are so filled with errors these days.  No one proofreads what they write. 
,royston51,2011-05-05T00:24Z,I can't get this to activate.  Murlok needs to include some instructions.  The crack .exe won't run.  Lots of problems.

and ur done 

simples"
,royston51,2011-06-27T03:00Z,This is a great program but it doesn't last long on my system and I have to download it again and again for some reason. Just saw the answer to my query.  Thanks.  I will try that. 
,royston51,2011-06-27T03:21Z,it doesn't work. It keeps telling me I will be unable to edit until I know the password and there is no password.
