,batliff,2010-02-05T02:24Z,"Appreciate this myth, but everyone who download's your torrent's knows better to wait for your H264 rip's.  Which is the only way to watch a movie of this caliber in my humble opinion.  Once you go myth you don't go back."

,LEXX911,2010-02-05T19:15Z,I will definitely be waiting for your copy.  Hopefully it's 1280(720)HD and not 720x400.
[V],Team_xRG,2010-02-05T19:29Z,"@ lexx not it would be sd only 720x ...
but quality of this sample is not like dvd screener it more like dvd rip well we all know its cant be dvd rip but this is as close it gets to it 
secretmyth himself said waif if u can or download

,PsychoDane,2010-02-06T08:11Z,"I have been comparing many conversions of this movie and can not speak for what will appear here, but most of them seem to have a kind of jitteryness in the movement noticable especially at 02min 25sec as space ship is passing close and the spinning part that is in the next few seconds although not in the smaller spinning part that is just frames behind it. . . Ending at 02min 325sec.   This is from frame by frame analysis so it is not just my player mind you.


I don't know much about such settings but the only one that I have found that does not seem to have this happening so far is from iwannadownload or so it says.

I just wonder if anyone else can confirm this for me or even possibly explain the differences that would lead to this during conversions.

I have always enjoyed SecretMyth for having high quality and in no way am trying to act as a referer to another site, it is just that this part of this movie is only not having this effect on their conversion.  I have seen it on three other similar sized versions today. But not the one from Iwan.'

Perhaps if this is noticed by anyone else in coparison to other versions.  They can say what seems to bee the difference in conversion settings.  As I assume that this where it is happening.

Thank you SecretMyth . . .you have been a source of great quality and I hope you dont see this as a criticism of your releases. And perhaps you can shed some light onto what I am observing as you seem to know much about conversions.

If you need me to provide the links to the exact downloads or try to cut clips from what I have obtained jusk ask.

Thank you again for your many High quality movies.     Dane . . "
,ferla1978,2010-02-06T08:26Z,When will you release the hole movie. ?
,shifoo,2010-02-06T09:20Z,"@ferla1978

there's lot difference in them..
lol:)"
,theone_nr,2010-02-06T12:18Z,well the 36 hours are over ... we still waiting at least a new deadline from SecretMyth ;-)
,joshdukie54,2010-02-06T18:52Z,Secretmyth won't be releasing this anytime soon because they simply don't have the source of the video in the preview that they provided. Horrible way to tease everyone.
,luftnaveen,2010-02-06T19:14Z,"hey secret, u have killed the half making them wait for avatar....in the meanwhile surprise us by uploading THE BOX please."
,d_archangel,2010-02-06T20:03Z,"Nothing new yet? You're kinda lazy lately, secretmyth!"
,britt2323,2010-02-06T20:11Z,@mj777 dude who cares what the pictures look like everyone knows the screens always look better than the actual video compare samples secretmyth video is by far better than vision at least on my hd laptop screen its noticeably more crisp with better color quality as well as for anybody who wants to see for themselves download the sample secretmyth has the best picture and flawless has best audio 
,britt2323,2010-02-06T20:25Z,"Ive already downloaded and burned the vision copy,but I have given it away now that ive seen this one I still have a copy on my computer just in case,
MajorTJKong(part of secretmyth group)wrote on demonoid
SecretMyth's being such a tease.  

I've no doubt he's having the same probs that plagued all of the dvdscr releases so far because of the poor source. The source screener DVD was split up into ~20 different PGCs (program chains) instead of one, separating the movie up into chunks like episodes on an episodic dvd. Trying to join them together to encode it all as one has apparently been causing considerable ivtc / frame dropping problems making playback jerky at parts. I've encoded a many a DVDRip myself but wouldn't know where to begin with that one. 

So far the ViSiON & FLAWL3SS releases have the least noticeable jerky playback probs probs (NOiR's wasn't too bad either) like the IMAGiNE, POCAHANTAS, & PrisM releases (and many other lesser known groups) all had. The ViSiON & FLAWL3SS releases do both still have one bad spot right before the 1hr mark that lasts about 10secs but otherwise they're both pretty good. A little dropped frames here and there but not to bad at all.

I've been waiting just like the rest of you all to see if SecretMyth's going to be able to do any better with it. Taking this long I suspect he's been busy trying just about everything, or else maybe he's run into some other problem."
,nerd707,2010-02-06T20:57Z,tried watching the vision rip and found that I can't watch this movie flat. I need 3D glasses. It's convinced me of that so much that I'm saving up for a new 3D tv.
,britt2323,2010-02-06T21:10Z,"This aint 3D,no 3D till DVD,if u want 3d you will have to see it at the theaters."
,britt2323,2010-02-06T21:11Z,everyone should probably do that anyway

Still waiting all of us ..but... IÂ´m pretty sure it worths it.. Greatmagician dvdscr torrent is fabulous, v/a 9, but the fps runs weird.. 
  However... IÂ´m sure Secretmyth will have the best one... never doubt it!! pleaseeeee..
