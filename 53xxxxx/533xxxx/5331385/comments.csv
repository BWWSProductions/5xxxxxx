,Mountain66,2010-02-03T13:58Z,"Thanks eztv! You're the best! If I'm not mistaking, your .MKV has an AAC audio track. Why not a Dolby Digital audio track, so that people can play the file on their PS3?"
,EdotheHero,2010-02-03T13:59Z,"19 peers and 3 seeds... C'mon people! Seeeedddd D:
Seriously if EVERYONE seeded then EVERYONE would get seriously fast downloads. think of it like that.

LOST!!!! :D"
,sp1kenson,2010-02-03T14:44Z,the seeders/leechers ratio is like 20-80 cmon ppl we all want to watch this so please seed 
,wackaday,2010-02-03T15:30Z,SEEEEEEEDDDD YOU SELFISH BASTARDS!!!!!!! i've got an average download speed of 0.5 kB/s here!!! the entire 6th season will be out on DVD before this shit has finished downloading.
,svart.se,2010-02-03T16:14Z,"Guys, chill.  This just hit the web, there is a huuuuge ratio of leechers to seeders, as is normal for this early of a release.  It'll be slowish for now, but faster later - that's just how it goes.  Just be patient, and edit your preferences to allow more connections if you're in that big a hurry."
,masterfoster56,2010-02-03T18:43Z,taken forever to download this might as well wail till friday night when its on
,svart.se,2010-02-03T19:00Z,"I'm uploading faster than I'm downloading, and I'm at 66%.  That's just silly.  There ARE too many people downloading and running.  At one point, there were over 90,000 leechers and seeders have never grown much above 4,200.  It'd be cool if a couple people wouldn't mind reseeding to help out a bit."
,ryanthemeister,2010-02-04T01:40Z,40kb average download speed? WTF? I'm on a 50 MB line unthrottled so that's not the problem. Fucking wank.

,blind202,2010-02-14T13:51Z,"Lots of pixelation and decoding errors in video, is this normal ? I'm using CoreAVC 1.95 I think (March 2009)."
