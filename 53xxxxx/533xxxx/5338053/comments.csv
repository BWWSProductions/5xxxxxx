 Please note that áll ® Games4theworld Downloads are 100% tested, 100% working and 100% safe. I recommend you turn off your Anti-Virus as they may detect some cracks as a virus, because of the way they're packed."
,zengee,2010-09-11T14:09Z,Does anyone know where to get the latest version of this game (version 1.09)?  All of the previous versions of this game has had graphical problems because of my nvidia card.  However in the latest version this has been fixed.
,QueenB18,2010-09-23T02:24Z,Umm.. Games4theworld Trust Me I Love You.. But I Scanned This Torrent With AVG 9 Pro.. && Yes Kudos 2 Does Have A Trojan... Sorry 
[T],Games4theworld,2010-10-19T15:41Z,"Hello,

@zengee

You should look for a patch. After patching the Game to the latest version, look for a new, working Crack.

Some Anti-virus mark cracks / cracked Games as a Trojans, because of the way they are packed. (They look a lot like Trojans, but aren't) It's just a false alarm. And I can guarantee you this, because I have been playing this Game for a long time myself."
,The shadows,2012-01-15T18:29Z,"This torrent probably has a Trojan complete with a separate .Bat file that tries to run the Kudos2.exe after/during the install then delete itself to cover its potential tracks.

-.- if not explain why this is necessary:
_______
Start_Game.Bat
_______
@echo off
Kudos2.exe
del Start_Game.bat"
,RyleJade,2012-04-23T01:14Z,"Have you run a antivirus on the .bat file, if so please show proof it has a virus. Thank you Game4theworld works perfectly no problems."
