The Trial was first published in 1925, a year after
Kafka's death. In it a man - Josef K. - is arrested
and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority.
The reason for his arrest and trial are not revealed.

What he does discover is that his arresting officers
are already suffering punishments behind closed doors.
The best advice he receives is that, as a guilty verdict
is inevitable, he should drag the trial out.

He is tried and found guilty.

This book is considered so important because it pre-
figures the return to 'show trials' to stiffle dissent, and
eliminate at will, through misapplied judicial process.
