[V],twentyforty,2010-02-04T17:29Z,"@madtown: Thanks for help.
And yes, sadly it's true - both ""releases"" (IMAGINE and POCAHONTAS) suffers from - dumb encoders. See, DVDSCR have a mixed progressive frame-rate (pure 29.97 frames per second) and pulled-up frame-rate (when 23.976 ""faking"" 29.97). Morons simply applied standard procedure as for ""normal"" 29.97, when so called ""decimation"" is performed equally on all frames, to reconstruct original movie frame-rate of 23.976 from DVD frame-rate 29.97.
BUT, you cannot apply such procedure on MIXED input, then you equally decimate the 29.97 AND 23.976, and it is not possible for laymen, to do it as they wish. If (layman) are smart, they simply leave 29.97 alone, not trying to act as idiots, who have, just today fucked-up ten thousands of people to get ""5 minutes of fame and glory"".

Aside from this jerkiness (picture skips a lot), brightness was boosted about 14% and overall quality is bad, bad and worse than bad.

I do not know how much you know about technical stuff, but I have tried to explain ""Why"" and, by the way, to learn something is always a good thing."
,htctouch,2010-02-04T17:42Z,very true .. many ppl r being fooled after lookin at d sample/screenshots n wsted thr time n money downloadin the full movie of 2gb ...
,madtown4,2010-02-04T17:50Z,"@twentyforty thats a new one on me . but i love to learn new stuff, so i think im going to take a class in my spare time . thanks for what you do "
,lilars26,2010-02-04T18:36Z,"@madtown4 Where do I sign up for that class.
I don't understand why those uploaders bother.They end up looking like fools and making their followers look like idiots.They had to have known that the frame rate was f'd.Yet they still get tons of downloaders with gigabytes to burn.It's madness I tell you."
,lilars26,2010-02-04T19:19Z,...thanks for this movie 20/40.
