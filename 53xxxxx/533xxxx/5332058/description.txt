Including HÃ¤ndel Suite In D Minor HWV 447. Played on two great instruments: Kirckman single-manual harpsichord (1764), Shudi double-manual harpsichord (1740).
Huge thanks to Macropus for sharing this on melomaniacos. I'm assuming you don't mind me sharing this on demonoid. It's been a while since your last upload here. And since this is a must have, I though I'd share it.

This is the first complete recording of James Naresâ€™s eight brilliant harpsichord suites of 1747. Organist of the Chapel Royal, James Nares epitomizes the late English Baroque style; one which takes after the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti and Thomas Arne.
