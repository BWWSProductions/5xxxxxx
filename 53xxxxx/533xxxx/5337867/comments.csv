[T],CODYBOSS1969,2010-02-05T16:31Z,"The sample tells me that this dvd-screener is by far the best release for now !!!

,antoinetteb41,2010-02-05T17:47Z,"In the beginning many nags,not one of the best versions."
,joshdukie54,2010-02-05T19:27Z,Does this have the same glitches the vision version has??

,tyrexjules,2010-02-06T18:35Z,"great movie, great quality ....... ;-)"
,NightF0x,2010-02-06T18:56Z,"The AVATAR DVD Screener torrent linked below has by far the best quality sound and picture: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5336460/AVATAR.2009.DVDSCR.XviD.AC3-ViSiON-[tracker.BTARENA.org]

No skipping as many others uploads have had. If you don't want to waste your time with a possible shitty 2GB download - go download this one.

 Don't forget to seed!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2010-02-07T10:25Z,"only a few skipping frames[sound not affected] that not affects the storyline[ most of them in transition betwen chapters]

No pixelation...and no ""wash out"" effect

I think it's A=9/10 V=9=10 .

VERY GOOD JOB FOR A DVD-SCREENER  TRANSLATED TO 2D FROM 3D!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2010-02-07T10:38Z,"A=9/10 V=9/10

Definitely the best release for now for Avatar 2009 !!!

Definitely worth download!"
,whizdakid,2010-02-07T10:58Z,didn't download...will wait for a secretmyth kingdom release...
,samsicht,2010-02-07T13:50Z,please seed guys i have 10kb.... :(
