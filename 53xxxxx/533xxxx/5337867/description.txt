FLAWL3SS NOTES (Work Done):

well thanks to imagine for the source files.

we took the dvd and we inverced telecine since it had this jerky motion to it.

***we have eliminated 99% of it but there is some spots here and there that it does it but you cant hardly tell unless you are looking for it.***

then it was on to filtering it. we adjusted the gama luma saturation and cleaned it up and finally sharpened it.

we hope you all like from team flawl3ss.

credit FLAWL3SS & to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone
