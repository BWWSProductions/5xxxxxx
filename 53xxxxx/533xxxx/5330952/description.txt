Fold, Rush. Seriously!

If you canâ€™t wait for the next season of â€œDancing with the Stars,â€ I suggest you tune into â€œDancing with Republicans.â€ GOP stalwarts are all over the tube lately displaying their trickiest moves. On the literal front, at the Miss America pageant Rush Limbaugh actually danced to Lady Gagaâ€™s â€œPoker Face.â€ Iâ€™m using the term â€œdanceâ€ loosely. Calling what Limbaugh did there â€œdancingâ€ is like calling what he does during the day â€œpolitical commentary.â€ It wasnâ€™t really dancing. He just shook very awkwardly and kept pumping his fist in the air. He looked like someone using a punching bag during a strong earthquake. But it was quite an energetic display. I havenâ€™t seen moves like that from Rush Limbaugh since he was mocking Michael J. Foxâ€™s Parkinsons Disease. Anyway, itâ€™s nice to see Rush can make a fool out of himself without opening his mouthâ€”except to gasp for air. And he certainly put the â€œgagâ€ in Lady Gaga.

In a more metaphorical dance, GOP guru Frank Luntz is dancing around the truth again. Heâ€™s come out with a memo outlining how Republicans should kill financial reform. Luntzâ€™s strategy stresses outright lies and playing on peopleâ€™s fearsâ€”the same playbook he used on healthcare reform. The only think worse than evil is retread evil. Canâ€™t this guy even come up with new diabolical schemes? The one common thread through everything that Luntz is telling Republicans to say is that none of it is true. Of course, if all youâ€™re going to do is tell the truth, you donâ€™t have to pay Frank Luntz to write it up for you. Also displaying some fancy footwork was GOP Congressman Jeb Hensarling. On Hardball last night he advocated cutting Social Security benefits
and privatizing Social Security. And he did it without using the words â€œcutâ€ or â€œprivatize.â€ Mission Accomplished! Hensarling said we need to â€œre-engineerâ€ Social Security benefits with a â€œdefined contribution plan.â€ That does sound better than â€œcut your benefits and give the money to Wall Street.â€ Do you want to give your Social Security to Wall Street? Youâ€™d be better off cleaning the toilets at the Stock Exchange. At least then you would know how much youâ€™re going to be getting.

Well, there are your Republican dance finalists. Not pretty to watch. Just be glad none of them did it in tights.
