,XxTashToshxX,2010-02-05T20:01Z,so can we play bioshock 2 pal in NTSC-J xbox 360 ???
,brian0423,2010-02-05T22:54Z,no
,coolg123,2010-02-06T04:20Z,"Dude, 
all im sayin is just that some PAL games can be played on NTSC-J consoles, ie the consoles that can play games with Japan unlocked region. Same is with the NTSC games.. Some have it and some don't. NOW PLS TELL ME DOES THIS GAME HAVE JAPAN REGION UNLOCKED OR NOT!!! 

DO THIS FROM XDVDMULLETER>> IN CASE YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO.. :P"
,Strikefear13,2010-02-06T04:48Z,"All I'm saying is THIS GAME IS PAL REGION ONLY.  JAPAN IS NTSC-J, THEREFOR IT IS NOT PAL.  This would lead one to logically believe that it would not work.  Hmmmm."
