    The recordings went very well, and Cheryl was fantastic to work with. I drove her very hard at the shoot, and it was very difficult on her part. My job was relaxing in comparison. We made the video in London, with a lot of focus on fashion and dance, with very tough choreography, before putting it all together in Los Angeles afterwards. I have a strong feeling that this will be a # 1 for Cheryl in England!

"Fight for This Love" was Cole's first entirely solo release outside of pop group Girls Aloud, following an appearance on will.i.am's "Heartbreaker" in 2008. The song initially came to Cole in demo form with a male vocalist. Cole said she "knew instantly it was a single", having "connected with the song so well".
