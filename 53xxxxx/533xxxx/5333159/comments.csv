,ikuturso,2010-02-04T18:54Z,how could it be..? Just listening Del Shannon's Runaway ..and it remind me about Crime Story. I was preatty sure i cant find it. Thank you very many. I will seed until the end of the world :) 
,DodgeNeonRT,2010-02-05T23:10Z,"I've been watching this torrent and at least half a dozen people have completely downloaded this 9GB+ torrent, yet I'm the only one seeding.  Very disappointing, and if people don't act more responsibly in the next 24 hours and start seeding, I'm pulling the torrent.  Seeding is killing my Internet connection and therefore 90% of my computer use and I'm not going to be the only one doing it. Not trying to be a jerk but fair is fair."
,ikuturso,2010-02-05T23:28Z,"dont kill this yet.. you dont have to up it 100% ..just drop it down, if it takes too much your band. I am not in rush with this one. Untill its done i will join for seeding. And I am preatty sure there is gonna be more ppl to join. After all this is the only one i found o_O"
,DodgeNeonRT,2010-02-06T04:02Z,"I want to seed at my full capacity to get it out there in the hopes that those who download will step in and seed so I can stop.  But if no one's going to do it, to heck with it."
,ja_iom_jedi,2011-01-20T20:05Z,Cheers uploader. Top man. Been lookin for this on dvd for ages but so expensive. Getting good speed on d/l. Keep giving the bandwidth up and I will seed this at least x10. Thanks again!
