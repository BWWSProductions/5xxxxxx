,bramahon,2011-10-10T23:32Z,"This movie seems to be a bit too cerebral for most. I've tried to show this to people whom I regarded as intelligent, yet many fail to embrace the subtlety of details and the roller coaster dynamics of this movie. I'm thinking of buying the paperback edition of this book which is essentially based on the scripts written by Bixby. For me this one has been a great find, thanks uploader :)"
,joaquimario,2012-02-04T18:59Z,Is this really from BluRay? Does not seem so. It seems more a DVD upscale. Sorry if I'm wrong.
,d0vh,2012-04-24T21:22Z,"quality is not bluray.
it's not worth 4gb"
