1. This encode is not meant to be put on a DVD5.
2. Why should a file be rared? Torrents automatically do hash checks and download the files in chunks, so what is the point of having 2 layers of this?
3. If you want the ISO, go download the SOURCE, not an encode of the source. BTW, the source for this movie is a Blu-ray, which means its probably 30GB or more. If you want the original IMG file of the source, while keeping it less than 4.7GB, go download the DVD source, as it is exactly what you are looking for. This version is not for you."
