,Dark_Wrath,2010-02-03T14:38Z,Hey HolyRoses. Sup? I got ffmpeg working and converting to M4V BUT the problem is that this m4v doesn't play ob the PSP. Though your's does (recognized as AVC). So I searched a bit and found that adding a -vlevel 13 command in the end would make it work. Is that right? Please reply man. Thanks. Nice upload btw. Seeding!!! :)
