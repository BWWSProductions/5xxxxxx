Through all of history, on the night of the full moon, the bloodcurdling cries of werewolves have pierced the night sky. For centuries werewolves have had to content themselves with shortened forays of feral change as dictated by the source of their power -- the moon! But all that is about to change as three werewolf friends -- Ted, Jeff, and Stan -- leave Earth and travel to the lunar surface in a quest to become Kings of the Moon! Unfortunately, Moon Patrol captain Maggie Pilgrim has other plans . . . as does the hive of vampires living on the dark side!
