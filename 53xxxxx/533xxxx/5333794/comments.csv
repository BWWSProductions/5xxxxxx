I forgot the password to my previous account and so I had to create a new one...Anyhow, if you have my torrent (the one you referred to in your Description) downloaded on your PC, can you please continue seeding it? Coz I don't have it on my PC.

P.S.:Great work, this torrent, btw."
,t4akawolf,2010-11-17T13:29Z,"Oh also, is the Ultimate Spider-Man series over?"
,zao_89,2010-11-22T01:49Z,"No, I don't have the torrent anymore. The Ultimate-Spiderman series continued as Ultimate Comics - Spider-Man, but it's going back to USM for the next issue I believe."
,jubz_1,2010-11-30T23:35Z,any chance of a reseed of requiem and the ultimate comics spiderman? ie the links posted in the description that are no longer there..
