,echonight2,2010-02-07T00:31Z,"The standard version hurts your vision???. I imagine that you must be blind by now considering that you must watched standard TV for many years before the HD appeared. Maybe the problem is not the definition but the fact that you maturbate too much, that is whats ruining your vision jeje."
,Dom6666,2010-02-07T15:33Z,"TFrank72 maybe the other guy was being a bit pretentious, but making such a deal about it makes you sound like an ass.

And Echonight2 maybe you don't masturbate enough since you writes such obtuse comments.

Write somthing nice or don't write at all.

I am sick of reading this drivel.     "
,arithine,2010-02-08T01:43Z,"@Dom6666 I believe this would be the definition of irony (or hypocrisy), about the whole saying something nice or nothing at all, saying some one sounds like an ass is not nice at all. "
,Thalinor,2010-02-09T06:20Z,"To the sh*tbag that said this looks awful, I am watching on a 47' LCCD and it looks fine.  It looks better then the streaming one on Sci-Fi's website.  STFU.

Thank you to the OP.  Great Upload"

Video and Audio quality in relation to file size 10/10."
