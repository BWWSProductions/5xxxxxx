,torax99,2010-02-04T21:41Z,"This is NOT DVDRip!
This is some remastered (?) version from CAM source.
I'm very sorry that I have wasted my time and bandwidth for this fake release.
I will not downloading any more releases from this uploader.
My recomendation - do not dowload this if you seek good A/V quality for this movie..."
