,waspo,2010-02-07T02:23Z,I'll post a constructive comment as soon as it's downloaded.....somebody's got to do it! 
,waspo,2010-02-07T06:22Z,"OK Guys, just finished downloading the P2PLOVERS from the Bay and I can tell you there are NO black and white issues in the beginning like on most of the re-encodes. It's near PERFECT. It's DVD format with VOB files etc. Chapters are seperated so you can choose what chapter you want to watch from the menu. I checked to see if they flow from one chapter to the next and they do. The aspect ratio is set at 4:3 which is a pain but if your TV or DVD player allows it you can change to 16:9. There is also a slight and I mean slight stutter but nothing annoying like the first load of re-encodes.
I'm a happy chappy now! 
Will do my own re-encoding to correct aspect but that's it. Nice sharp image and good stereo sound. 
For a smaller encode, Release Lounge looks pretty damn good!!!!
I may even grab this too.........Damn my bandwidth has taken a beating!"
