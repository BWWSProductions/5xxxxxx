# # Summary: This film follows the story of Jake Sully - paralyzed former marine, who served in the beautiful but dangerous world of Pandora to help mining corporation to recover a mineral called unobtanium. People can not breathe the air of Pandora so that they travel and work in special metal oxygen suits. Pandora is inhabited by racial na'vi - shestmetrovi blue humanoid beings who have no interest in helping people in their endeavor to Pandora.

The corporation essentially creates a hybrid of the DNA of man and na'vi, which is controlled by the mind of man-operator. Newly being called avatars. The problems come when all the creatures on the planet Pandora - animals, plants, na'vita - realize that people should leave their world and begin to use all forces to achieve this goal.

People are forced to fight for the survival of Pandora and the middle of this fight is shelved Jake Sully (Sam Uortingtan "Terminator Salvation"). While living among the local Pandora, Sully changed their positions and helping to lead na'vi revolutionary struggle for the abolition of the people and avatars from the face of Pandora.

Catch is that when Sully is in your avatar, he is fully mobile, where as a man, he is confined to a wheelchair. This is a moral dilemma, which will have to tackle, and his journey through the world of Pandora, will decide the fate of both worlds.
