,togirl75,2010-02-06T16:55Z,can someone tell me how to get the subs to work. i renamed the file so they are both the same that never works. usually his rips already has subs do i need to download these vob or whatever they are called programs.
,Kirii,2010-02-08T09:57Z,Are the subs hardcoded for this release or a separate file?
,Hasenkam,2010-02-08T13:45Z,"Its a pretty poor V-quality. I wouldn't say DvDrip. It's a little bit more poor than typical AXXO upload.

But watchable."
,Minkonji,2010-02-08T15:34Z,"Missing the foreign subs, which would be really nice to have hard-coded or even just included.

None the less, very watchable.

,sly_arnie,2010-02-09T02:19Z,"hello,

On downloading this avi file, whenever i try to select the avi file, I get an Microsoft Visual C++ dialog box saying ""Runtime error! Program: C:\WINDOWS\explorer.exe This application has requested the Runtime to terminate in an unusual way. Please contact the applications support team for more information""
When I click the ""OK"" button the windows explorer closes.
Bottom line is I cannot play the movie in any of media player, VLC included.
I have other .avi files that I can play and this error does not bother me. 
Any ideas. I just downloaded this movie in ONLY 15 hours, so plz do not suggest me to download this again."
,sly_arnie,2010-02-10T14:45Z,"Hello,

It has been more than a couple of days since I posted my problem with the file that I downloaded. Plz refer to my last post for details.
I am sorry to say that till now the issue remains unresolved and I am unable to play 2012 dvdrip file.
I would suggest all the people who r planning to download this movie, think otherwise. A total waste of time and patience.
Regrets"

,JuggaloJuggy,2010-02-11T00:09Z,"@sly_arnie

Yo dumbass your the only one having problems with this movie and its not the file maybe you should look at your problem again cus i read both of what you posted and it tells you whats not working right in the problem you posted"
,paragon9,2010-02-12T13:43Z,excellent all round!!!
,zasta23,2010-02-15T00:04Z,The subs included are english and they go throughout the whole movie....does anyone have english subs for JUST the non-english speaking parts?? as only about 10% of the movie isn't in english
,zasta23,2010-02-15T03:18Z,"To clarify...the A/V quality is very good. 
There are english subs included...don't listen to people saying there are no subs, anyone who checks the files can clearly see there is a .SRT file included. Only problem is that the english subs are for the whole movie, so as soon as we have some subs for just the non-english bits then we'll have an excellent copy. The subtitles are NOT hardcoded, so you can turn them off and on according to what language is currently being spoken in the film, which is only mildy annoying as most of the film is in english."
,sly_arnie,2010-02-16T19:16Z,"Hello FXG_team,

The issue that I had mentioned in the last post has been RESOLVED. 
There were some preinstalled codec on my system that were interfering while playing the film.
Anyone who has this issue plz download codec from http://www.cccp-project.net/. When u run the exe file, it detects pre-existing codec on the system and asks u to overide those codec on the system. Just keep clicking next everytime and u will override the pre-existing codec. Now u will be able to play the movie.

Only one question remains unresolved. Only this avi file caused problems for me, rest all were working fine. Anyhow issue Resolved.
Happy dl and seeding."

,locutus3,2010-02-21T05:46Z,"Good one. Thanks FXG. Audio and video very good. I burned without the english sub srt file since I do not like english subs on spoken english. Movie is missing the foreign subtitles, but that was not a lot of the movie and was able to figure out what was going on.

,067875369,2010-03-03T02:37Z,I downloaded the subtitles from this torrent and downloaded the move from another torrent and the video and subtitles aren't sync
,sylkis,2010-03-03T08:10Z,"For those that complain about subtitles here's a small tip for windows users. (Sorry but for Linux or Mac I'm not sure what the process is): Right click on the .srt file and slect ""open with"" then find the icon of the notepad which as the word notepad next to it. click that and click open. It will show you the entire subtitle list and what times they will appear. Like this:

1
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,935
Hey, hey, watch out. Watch out.

now delete all the ones that are the ""english speaking"" parts and then replace the number at the top of each one so that the first one is 1 and the 2nd one is 2 and so on and so forth. Save the file then that's all you need to do. 

Also fun but pointless: You can change what the subtitles will say by editing the text and at what times. Again this is pointless but fun to add your own words of what happens. Just remember to save a copy of the original."
,Ouzotime,2010-03-03T17:51Z,tyvm for the up FXG_team and all that share/seed the copy is excellent 
,LiquidInsanity,2010-03-05T04:52Z,How does one merge the subtitle folder with the movie file? I don't get.

Mine is all pixelated, it looks like it goes at about 10 frames per second, and alot of the frames are morphed together for seconds at a time, it is not a fault with my media player(s).

Please somebody help me."

Considering it's a DVDRip.

However, i strongly suggest 720p or 1080p BRRip due to all the effects taken in the movie.

Movie itself really makes you think about whole end of the world thing... I mean, if that's what's going to happen.... Than fuck you guys, all of you, i'm moving to Africa ASAP!   

Just kidding of course :-)... Enjoy the movie, it's really really good one! Peace!"
,Taishotono,2011-10-22T03:55Z,"Why are these ""secret uploaders"" even allowed? It says the movie is 955mg long and the movie sounds good, you wait and DL, when it is opened it is one minute long and says ""Were sorry, you have to join our club to watch this great flick"". Even when I open it with the suggested player it does not open.
 This is a sad day for Pirates everywhere. FXG should be on the Person of Interest's short list"
,kevhast,2011-11-13T12:50Z,"Audio and video quality is great, thanks. Movie was average at best but fine if you just want disaster-porn."
