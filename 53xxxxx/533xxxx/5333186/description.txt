The film is set in the Gobi Desert, 700, and revolves around two protagonists, the first of which is Lieutenant Li (played by Jiang Wen) of the Chinese army, who refuses to kill women and child prisoners. His actions cause a mutiny, and he becomes a fugitive, travelling through the desert. He eventually comes across a caravan which carries a relic, which is accompanied by a Buddhist monk. Li protects the caravan from thieves as well as the overlord of the region, Master An (played by Wang Xueqi)who is hired by the Khan (Qapagan Khan at the time) to seize the relic. The other protagonist, a Japanese emissary, Lai Xi (played by Kiichi Nakai), is ordered by the emperor of China to kill Li. In a twist of fate, Lai Xi realizes that the caravan is on an Imperial mission and helps Li to defend it, and ensures that it arrives at the capital safely. They promise to fight each other only after their duty is done.
