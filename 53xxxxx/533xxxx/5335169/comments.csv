,rainstormseattle,2011-10-15T04:43Z,"This is a great free VPN. It works perfectly fine. What you should do, if you want to create an effective VPN, is rename the root name and the tunnel name to a combination of letters, numbers, capitals, and lowercase. 

For example: 

gsjk2313WG5th
--2rqjgWG5sgb

Use 256-bit AES encryption on both settings.

Make sure you use the subnet address option and also don't surpass DH2-1024, or your tunnel will likely not open.

Your IP / local connection will show up on other computers as a completely scrambled combination of letters and numbers, like ""fbfdj8132jfjvek35""

Enjoy and keep seeding."
