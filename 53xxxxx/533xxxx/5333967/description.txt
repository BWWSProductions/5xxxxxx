A caper-noir with a rather stilted heist scene. I really like the way Burt Lancaster looks in that tank-top t-shirt. Yvonne De Carlo stars as a reluctant femme fatale. I rather think she's almost worth the horrible price paid. This movie reminds me of The Killers (1946), a better movie with many similar plot elements, the same director and also starring Burt Lancaster:
