,TEMPE5T,2010-02-14T15:42Z,Thank You!!!
,patkz,2010-03-01T03:09Z,hey does this mean it has all the deleted scenes?
[T],Booster2,2010-03-01T16:33Z,Think you need to read the description again.
,m.nt83,2010-03-08T01:36Z,"thanks for this torrent,
looking for the subtitles, in french or even in english, download fews but no ones fits. No ones has an idea ?"
,Timmmm,2010-04-08T23:34Z,Thank god. Just starting watching the mutilated version of episode 6 and they've added some shockingly bad (think jar jar x100) CG characters to Jabba's palace. What were they thinking?
,sharkyfinn,2010-04-17T00:50Z,"Thank you, thank you. Yeah it's a shame that Lucas decided not only to clean up the originals, but also to ""fix"" then the way he would have wanted to make them had the technology been available. His works were greatly appreciated and i can't see why he couldn't just let them stand. Worse in my opinion though are the gross discrepancies in the prequels such as Padme dieing during childbirth, or Yoda and Chewbaca knowing each other. Oh well i can always just pretend he stopped at 3 movies. Again thanks for the upload "
,BTHprimo,2010-05-11T03:38Z,"Hey just started dl'ing.  Thanks in advance.  Ditto what sharky and timmmm said.  I absolutely cringed at the new ""enhancements"" they tried to make.    BTW Thanks for the 2GB files, rather than trying to squeeze them into 700MB."
,JoeScar2008,2010-05-13T16:47Z,Thx...Man
,DismalN,2010-05-16T23:39Z,"ive been going through some hard times recently. after finally sorting some shit out, i made a badass club house sandwich, plus some fries from the fry truck, and set it out in my favourite chair with my favourite beer.

i proceeded to smoke a big fat joint using some of the best weed ive ever had (also the ONLY weed id been able to afford for a few months).

after getting high and settling in, i hit 'play' on my XBMC box, and started Star Wars. episode 4 i guess you could call it.

immediately i was hit with amazing, thrilling, epic music. it was one of the greatest moments of my life. i hadnt seen star wars in years.

i enjoyed it right from the start. it was so cheesy in a dated sort of way, but so epic, so clear, so fundamental. the characters were simple, but they didnt NEED to be anything else. it was perfect. it was all perfect.

and then i saw it.

CGI

i couldnt believe it. i thought maybe i smoked too much. what was i seeing? just when i was enjoying how inventive and well done everything was, i saw....THIS? computer generated garbage?

i started to doubt everything. i hadnt seen the originals in over a decade, so i didnt know what was real. were those giant treads picking up CS and R2 real actually part of a constructed set, or were the just generated? is ANYTHING im seeing constructed at all?

i freaked out, turned it off. whole night ruined. i vowed to amend this. how could i have made such a stupid mistake.

i did some googling, and i found you, Booster2.

thank you. thank you for this wonderful torrent. i dont care how could the quality is. i wouldnt have cared if it was ripped from VHS. i just want the original. i want my Star Wars back. and youve given it to me.

thank you."
,zowee18,2010-08-16T17:32Z,Stupid question: Why don't I have sound when I d/l these? 
,colebran,2010-10-12T01:00Z,"Thank you so much for this torrent. I have the originals on VHS but not VHS player.

You made my day, good sir!"
,lukeskywalker786,2010-12-28T11:58Z,"it's funny how they say this is the original version, whilst they used the 1993 laserdisc for the transfer which had a newly constructed sound mix. As an example, you can hear glass shattering when Han, Luke and Chewie shoot the cameras in the cell bay. There was no glass shattering sound in either one of the theatrical versions (70mm, 35mm stereo, 35mm mono). Still, this is very close to the original theatrical versions, so i prefer to watch this version. Because of this torrent, i came aware of it that there where original versions! As a child i always watched the special editions. But for some reason i really love the original editions. Thanks for uploading these, Booster2."
,kapow123,2011-01-06T02:40Z,"Already had copies of the unaltered trilogy at around 740mb per movie, these are 2gb per movie and the same quality (dont get how). Just a warning to people looking for HD."
,dousch,2011-01-10T04:58Z,"@kapow123 

I can gladly tell you that the extra 500 MB is indeed a big difference of quality in these rips. Here's a comparison: http://data.fuskbugg.se/dipdip/stari.jpg

The first shot is from this ""Star Wars Trilogy (The Original Unaltered Trilogy)"" and the second one is like all 700 MB versions from TPB-uploader     thestealthbannana. "
,iphonezapper,2011-04-13T22:50Z,@dousch Wow! Quite a difference! Thanks for the heads up! going to download now. Will post with the quality and screenshots! Thanks! Booster2!
,Ultimatesnake,2011-06-29T15:16Z,Does this include subtitles? Because I don't see any in the download box.
,mrunivers,2011-07-16T10:36Z,"unto DismaIN-

I apologize in advance for such a late reply...it had not occurred to my small brain to seek out the original Star Wars epics of my childhood.  Having been seduced by the spectacular (not in the good sense) releases of subsequent ""episodes"", I meekly accepted the CGI revisions of classic material.  But now that I am awakened, I ask myself, (and the viewing community), where do we draw the line?  Our memories are our own, to keep and cherish!  I saw the the ""first"" Star Wars movie as a child, with my estranged father, and I clearly remember being freaked out, afraid (!) by Darth Vader's first appearance.  No one can take that away from me, not even Hollywood moguls.  I have a poster of this cover PDF....it is still with me, in my childhood stuff.  Let us all be insistent that original content be preserved.  We are the electronic historians/preservers/keeper of records of our generation/"
,Captain_Spaulding,2011-08-20T15:04Z,"It's sad that we'll maybe never get to see these films in decent quality, but this is probably as close as it's going to get, and better than nothing. Thanks."
,Organism9,2011-09-04T11:06Z,Thanks :)
,Xeginy,2011-09-05T20:16Z,"Great download, thanks!!"
,Jona198102,2011-09-12T08:28Z,"Thanks Booster! Great work! The altered versions eh.. suck, for lack of a better word. Wt hell was Lucas thinking?!??"
,Jona198102,2011-09-13T02:10Z,"One other thing: I downloaded the definitive original edition a long time ago - actually through eMule which took forever - and the quality here is much, much better. The DivX codec of the definitive original edition is not very good. DivX still isn't very good as an encode choice. Quality here is quite good. I mean, come on.. We are dealing with source material from 1978.. FYI: Rumor according to to fans and Lucas is that the unaltered trilogy will be released on Blu-ray in 2012."
,Telordya,2011-09-20T02:19Z,"God dammit, additional changes on the Blu-ray edition! I'm tired of Lucas crap!! I'm getting the original unaltered versions. Thanks a lot for this!"
,Wenrath,2011-09-23T08:02Z,"@Jona198102: Lucas will probably be doing a re-release with 3D by that time...maybe. Chances for Blu-ray Theatrical Editions are slim to none. Lucas only cares about money and the way he wants the movies to look. Mostly money

@Booster: Thank you so much. Will rate after dling. You are a true fan for putting this up. ;D"
,winsause,2011-11-14T04:30Z,"Booster2, you are a saint. "
,j0nnyboy,2011-12-05T00:37Z,Thanks alot Booster2. May the force be with you.
,Pennyfarthing,2011-12-15T03:26Z,"Booster2, you've made my christmas - so many thanks!"
,midgetsun84,2011-12-28T04:09Z,Thank you for restoring a formative part of my youth.  You are a Space-Pimp.
,drotte,2012-01-09T09:39Z,"I only had one VHS copy of the original New Hope, recorded from a laserdisc in the 80s. Much appreciate the torrent, especially considering these had to be ripped from the laserdiscs, and working players are hard to come by these days, so it couldn't have been an easy feat."
,jfhjr,2012-02-15T19:34Z,"GREAT FIND! So glad I was finally able to see these movies as they were originally shown in the theaters back in my day. George can do whatever he wants to them, now! In my world, Han shoots first! Great quality audio and video and super-great seeding/download speed! THANKS BOOSTER2!"
,megatrends,2012-02-24T01:25Z,Fantastic version of these films. Thanks for doing this. 
,Fuse_410,2012-05-07T21:22Z,"A 6 gig download and the opening scrolls leave artifacts on the screen? Really?

The whole film show clear pixelation, noise and artifacting due to compression. Save your bandwidth and skip this.

Appreciate the effort, Booster, but these files simply aren't good enough quality for viewing at home."
,jocobre,2012-05-11T19:29Z,"My speed is freakin 60 kb/s... But I don't care, that wont stop me from DLing this awesome trilogy. Thanks alot Booster2 :DDD"
,arickrol,2012-05-14T04:11Z,"Maybe I'm doing something wrong but the audio doesn't work.  It doesn't play the audio when the movie starts (I tried ANH first).  After fast forwarding and rewinding, the audio will play for a few seconds and then cut out.

I have a variety of audio codecs and usually don't have trouble with AVI files.  Is anyone else having this trouble?"
,arickrol,2012-05-14T16:04Z,Ignore my previous comment.  Turns out that the .avi file was opening in Quicktime for some stupid reason (hence the problems).  Opening it in Divx solved the issue.  Sorry.
,swampownr1,2012-05-25T00:26Z,Thanks!!!!!!!
,El-Jefe-Dahmer,2012-06-19T02:16Z,"downloaded but they won't play.  quicktime just keeps loading, but other downloads are playing in quicktime. any suggestions?"
,El-Jefe-Dahmer,2012-06-19T02:18Z,me too...opened in VLC fine
,TorrentRating,2012-07-04T16:47Z,"@drotte  - Read the description! These rips are from the officially released DVD's, not (thank god) from laserdisc."
