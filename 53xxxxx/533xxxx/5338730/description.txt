Hello fellow listeners of Simple Truth Radio.

The new episodes of Simple Truth Radio have arrived and seeing the recent events on David Icke's Official Forums, we have decided to talk about it. This is a 2 hour 2 part radio program that talks about our experiences on the DIF, what others have said about David including "Daisygate" and what has come from the lips of David himself. Previous shows will be re- uploaded and available to download again soon.
