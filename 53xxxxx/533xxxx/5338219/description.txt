Cornel Campbell - The Gorgon Dubwise (Jamaican Recordings) CD


 Sixteen dubs (14 on the vinyl) to Cornel Campbell titles produced by Bunny Lee, including mixes to such gems as Give Me Love, General on the Gorgan riddim, Just A Moment and many others. Of course, Cornel in dub is of course something of an oxymoron, because Cornel is one of the finest singers of his generation, and of course his voice is, by definition, absent from most of this. The riddims shine through though, and where Cornelâ€™s voice does emerge, all is bliss. JRCD033
