I have been finding I just don't have the time or the bandwidth anymore to download my favourite shows in higher bit-rate versions, then convert AVIs to iPod ready mp4s for my iPod touch, which is where I do most of my watching. You serve a niche occupied by those of us who in busy lives do a lot of watching on a small screen, and don't always need the 1.3 gig mkv of a show (though I must admit I do love the HD quality!). I will continue to be one of your followers and seeders. Thank you!"
