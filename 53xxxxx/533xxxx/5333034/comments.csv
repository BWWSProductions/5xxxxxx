But windows 7 cannot upgrade from XP only from Vista, and Vista from XP. But you can just do a fresh install of Win 7 on top of XP and re-do all of your settings."

Thanks"

Is there a way to merge/transfer my files from XP over to windows 7? I lost my original winxp disk so i am downloading this copy so i can possibly format win xp. I want to keep windows 7 and get rid of win xp, but i want to keep some files from win xp and transfer them to win 7. As you can see i am not the smartest with computers but i learn fast. Would you be nice enough to give me a hand? My email is (Plasmachinist@yahoo.com "
