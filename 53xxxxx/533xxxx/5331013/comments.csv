,Torr3ntRid3r,2010-02-03T04:46Z,Archived version here. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5227802/Complete_CG_Academy_Bundle_30_DVDs
,naeem42,2010-02-03T15:43Z,Whats this torrent about only 3D Max
,apwbdjp,2010-02-03T23:05Z,"I'm Seeding: Advanced MAXScript 1 - The Matrix: Explained. Since I only got the 9 first parts of the Archive. Please people, we need help!
(By the way: Many thanks to Torr3ntRid3r for the Archived version, and this one!)"
,apwbdjp,2010-02-03T23:20Z,"Also seeding:
Intermediate Rigging 1 - FK Spine, Leg & Foot Rig
Intermediate Rigging 2 - Spline IK, Arm & Hand Rig
It seems like even if my file extracts perfectly, I always have a 0.4% missing. But even tough the ISO is fully mountable with Daemon and all videos and exercices on it are working.
Thanks again!"
,mty000,2010-03-10T16:54Z,"I initiated seeding several ISO's but utorrent thinks the files are only 99.8% complete even though they are actually 100% complete.

Torr3ntRid3r:

Could you please check in the seeding group occasionally to help complete the last 0.2%?

At this time, the following ISO's need help:

Animation Fundamentals 1 - The Core Principles
HLSL Shader Creation 1 - HLSL Shader Fundamentals
HLSL Shader Creation 2 - Light & Shading Models
Lighting & Rendering Fundamentals 1 - Light & Color Theory

Appreciate it."
,mty000,2010-04-08T18:54Z,"After finishing downloads, please set your upload limit above 50kb/s and let it run for 2 days.  Forget about the up/down ratio.  It hurts to see people hit and run.
If anybody knows how to fix the last 0.2% problem with utorrent, please let me know."
,TPBSPY,2010-05-28T14:04Z,"Well guys, I am a late bloomer to this tutorial set (just realized now how good it is). So, I am starting to download the ISOs one at a time.

I am a well known sharer/seeder, so you can count me in regarding seeding and helping out. I also use to be a well known uploader (VIP Green Skull).
For what it's worth; One of my old alises on TPB was ""spy_vs_spy"" (self retired fulltime VIP Green Skull uploader).

Let's get cooking.

Thanks uploader for the original share."
,mty000,2010-06-15T17:32Z,The last-0.2% problem was resolved shortly after my last comment.  The torrent has been running perfectly for 2 months now.  Thanks to all seeders for doing a great job. :)
