[color=Green][b]Review by Andy Kellman

Preceding the elaborate 2005 reissues of Eurythmics' eight proper albums by a
month, The Ultimate Collection narrowly trumps 1991's Greatest Hits since it
features remastered sound and a more extensive track list. While it does not
contain "Don't Ask Me Again," opting to instead select a couple merely decent
highlights from 1999's Peace, two new (unplanned) recordings add value for any
kind of fan. Bookending the disc, "I've Got a Life" is powerful disco-pop with Annie
Lennox strongly present over a bursting multi-tiered arrangement, while the
relatively low-key "Was It Just Another Affair" has more in common with late-period
Everything But the Girl. Both songs pleasingly sound the way Eurythmics should
sound in 2005. The rest of the disc leans toward the duo's peak of popularity,
1985's Be Yourself Tonight and the following year's Revenge, while the remainder
of the albums -- with the exception of the unrepresented In the Garden, the debut --
chime in with two or three songs each. A truly ultimate collection would contain two
discs and dig deeper into some of the best album cuts, rather than rely on charting
singles, but this disc will sufficiently satisfy the casual fans who just want the songs
they know and love..[/b][/color]
