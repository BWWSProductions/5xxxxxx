,InstantStarFan7,2010-02-13T02:12Z,"First I want to say THANK you so much for uploading a blu ray that is actually of size!! :) That's awesome and I can't wait to download it, but I have a question. I don't have any HDs that are NTFS except my main drive on the computer (Which does me no good because there is no way to get it to the PS3.) As you know, you can only download up to 4gbs onto a FAT32 HD.. So what can I do, or is there anything I can do without having to re-format one of my externals to NTFS? It's irreversible and it says on forums that PS3 doesn't even read NTFS. :\ Plus, I have over 500gb of stuff on that HD so it would take forever to transfer it all somewhere else while formatting. (Which I REALLY don't want to do) Help please! :) "

,exateit,2010-04-02T07:48Z,"Good download.

Use BD Rebuilder to shrink the file to fit on 25GB bluray disc, and remove any unwanted audio streams.

Thanks uploader!"

,bozzow,2010-06-06T15:28Z,"Hello,
Sorry for the stupid question but I'm kind of new in this filed :). How do I play this movie without the double voice? If I play directly the stream I get the double voice. Do I have to create an iso image? If I have to create an iso image what folders do I put in. Can someone explain step by step.
Thanks."

,Klipnotica,2011-07-11T21:45Z,"ive been downloading for a week to get this copy, im at 98% and now everyone stopped seeding, come on guys seed it once uve got it if u dont wanna share it back then dont download"
,Klipnotica,2011-07-12T19:17Z,"Great Quality Picture and sound. hwever, if ur english and expect to watch this movie and understand what other languages are saying u have to turn on subtitles through the entire movie kinda annoying that u cant just have the subtitles come on when they are suppose to. but i will seed for a while for anyone else. im sure ther is a way to make it play normally and have the subtitles work properly but for the amount of time u wait to download u wouldnt expect to have to spend more time modifying the file. Great Quality though"
