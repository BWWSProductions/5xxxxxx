,Meggles5,2010-02-06T00:59Z,I am confused. I downloaded and it says to unpack -  unpack what? Which file is it? As far as I can tell they are split files. Can anyone please help me out? Sorry for being such a noob.
,samoframbow,2010-02-13T22:46Z,"I unpacked and when the Sims 3 InstallShield comes up, it says ""update error: invalid file found."" I clicked the last file (""vty-0286"") and it says ""This archive is either in unknown format or is damaged."" What should I do? Is there something I'm doing wrong or did uploader screw up and put in a damaged file?"
