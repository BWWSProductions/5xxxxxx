From back cover:

In John Updike's fourth and final* novel about ex-basketball player Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom, the hero has acquired heart trouble, a Florida condo, and a second grandchild. His son, Nelson, is behaving erratically; his daughter-in-law, Pru, is sending out mixed signals; and his wife, Janice, decides in mid-life to become a working girl. As, though the winter, spring, and summer of 1989, Reagan's debt-ridden, AIDS-plagued America yields to that of George Bush, Rabbit explores the bleak terrain of late middle age, looking for reasons to live.

From Audiofile:

Few novels are more suited to the listening experience than those of the late John Updike, whose gifts as a storyteller were unsurpassed. Arthur Morey narrates the fourth and final volume of Updike's novels about Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom with an almost-incantatory style that perfectly suits the large canvas of its settingâ€”America in 1989. Morey's nuanced reading makes Rabbit realâ€”vulnerable yet hopeful. The story fixes a time in our history through the eyes of a flawed but memorable character whose indulgences mimic the "Me Decade." His glory as a high school basketball star gone, his carnal appetite reduced by heart disease, his business brought to chaos, and his relationships diminished by time, Rabbit Angstrom comes to an end in Florida, the country's geriatric purgatory.
