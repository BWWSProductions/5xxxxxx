It took the 1996 Grammy Awards for both Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Seal also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.

Written by Seal and Trevor Horn, the single "Kiss from a Rose", the second taken from the Batman Forever film soundtrack, topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for one week in August 1995. It also went to #4 on the UK Singles Chart. The single originally made it to #20 in 1994, but upon being re-released after being featured in the film, it reached the top position. It was also nominated for a 1996 MTV Movie Award.

The image on the cover has since become nearly synonymous with Seal, in that it has appeared on several singles covers and was recycled for his greatest hits album.
