,Criminet,2010-02-08T13:20Z,an avi with region coding? that makes no sense
,newmouse,2010-02-10T05:25Z,"Its good near DVD quality Video say 8 
has a slightly rough look but it is a near 2 Hour Film in only 700 MB file.
The audio I'll give 7.5 its clear ..but  rather thin ..Only the very first few intro music seconds are in stereo .
Its an OK copy for standard TV or Computer viewing .. HD freaks with multi big speakers will  not be so happy. @@Thanks@@@"
,newmouse,2010-02-10T05:26Z,"Oh Lovely me again.
Its in English with a supplied Italian SRT subs file @@@"

R2 means Rip from Dvd Region2"
,Dramat,2010-02-22T00:19Z,"Wow, I'm impressed! Nice quality V:8 A:6
Really watchable release! 
Thank you 4 upload!


And Rochie - Yes i did noticed those lamers, whom posting negative comments. My advice - f@#c them. We now how to search good releases and we know whom uploaders are reliable. So let them play with those comments like little childrens. If they think they'll do us any harm, they MUST be retarded or close to that.

Video is pretty damn good, very good for watching on the computer.
Audio is a downer, low quality, little hard to understand every now and then, not entirely clear. However, it is still decent to watch with, might wanna get some subs just incase you miss some dialog tho."
