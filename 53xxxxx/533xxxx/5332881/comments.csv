,Laustis,2010-02-03T20:34Z,"Works for fine for me, except this is not a crack t anyone thinking it is. This is just the Update 1.21. The same as you get online at their website"
[V],gansuk,2010-02-03T21:21Z,"you may need the other updates before u install this 1 our other release works fine with this with both dlcs since they already got the updates added
and this is a crack since u can play it without cd and crack came from razor1911 so thanks to them"
,pochoman15,2010-02-03T21:50Z,fake  no sirve
,NanoEntity,2010-02-03T23:10Z,dose not work with reloaded version.
,Toimu,2010-02-04T00:32Z,"FAKE!

I unrar the iso file and ran it with MagicISO.  It ask if I wanted to uninstall Borderlands.  So I backed-up my saved games and clicked Ok.  And it uninstalled my Borderlands.  I'm reinstall them now.

Fast download and doesn't seem to be a virus or anything.  Just the Borderlands uninstall."
,sylenth,2010-02-04T01:56Z,"Same here, game crashes on startup.
I noticed also that a lot of files are older then what i had already... (1.2 second dlc) "
[V],gansuk,2010-02-04T07:32Z,"i cant see how this can ask to uninstall borderlands
all it does it replaces files its simple enouth to run u can even install outside of borderlands folder u will notice it makes folders with files inside them just need to copy them over to borderlands folder and overwright the other files thats already there
you will need all the other updates first tho if u get our dlcs both of them it works fine since they already got the other updates added
iv tested this and it now lets u go online"
,TaLoN.NL,2010-02-04T13:21Z,"Thanx!
I downloaded the original patch, copied all files to the directories in which they belong from the .cab file, now I only need a no-cd executable."
,Toimu,2010-02-04T16:07Z,"Well gansuk I guess you uploaded the wrong file then.  The one I got to work is:

231,987,550 Bytes or 221.24 MiB

That is without any install app.  I had to put all 207 files in the correct location myself!

Borderlands_v1.2.1_Update-RazorDOX-[tracker.BTARENA.org] 

RazorDOX's version works online for me."
,sylenth,2010-02-04T19:56Z,I finally got it working using your files but with another crack. (the newer Razor one)
[V],gansuk,2010-02-05T00:33Z,"seems i messed up abit :(
i added the crack from version 1.2.0.0 :(
i had to get crack from gamecopyworld but looks like i forgot to replace it in this update
go to there site and search for borderlands you need version 1.21 and just replace it with the one in binaries folder"
,NanoEntity,2010-02-06T04:57Z,"Ok I got this working :) Yay.

Here is what you do

Extract from the Rar Archive.
~UnPack~
Arc
Borderlands.Update-1.21

Note: these 3 files have to be in a separate clean folder without any other files in it to make this easy install.

Run ~UnPack~
Let it finish, then close it.

Now you will see 3 folders.
Binaries
Engine
WillowGame

Total size 305MB.

Select all 3 folders and copy them over to your Borderlands install folder, and overwrite all files.

Then go to gamecopyworld download borderlands 1.2.1 Fixed exe.

Place the exe in Binaries folder and overwrite.

Boom Your done, and game works 100% :)"
,ninjapiratez,2010-02-11T13:15Z,"I've renamed the 2 files correctly, put every file in the right folder and uploaded for you guys, pre-cracked with razor 1.21 no-cd

just unrar/extract and play

,l333,2010-02-11T13:42Z,anybody managed to get it to work with reloaded version?
,ninanight,2010-02-18T15:06Z,"yeah i got it to work but u have to install all the dlcs in order before adding this patch, also the crack needs replacing because it has the wrong one in here. it works fine online to :) i think they should have redone this one to make it easy."
,zxkb4s29,2010-02-21T22:14Z,"this *****DOES NOT WORK***** with Borderlands.FullRip-KaOs. gives error RIGHT at start. checked twice.
waste of time uncompressing the original again."
,Ezlin,2010-03-25T19:53Z,Verified.
,sh3bang,2010-07-13T22:28Z,"Wow some of you are plain dumb. It works. Follow \""Nanoentity\"" and you will be able to get the game working. And there is no need to install any dlc like nananight stated."
