Musically it is quite decent electro/ebm. Compositions sometimes rigid, sometimes soft; a vocal sometimes German, sometimes English. The plate is let out by label OffBeat, and it something should speak admirers of the rigid electronic music, respecting multilayered synth the palettes, the deformed vocal, numerous samples from films and transfers, mobile bats.
