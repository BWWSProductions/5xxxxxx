,moshster,2010-02-08T06:35Z,Thanks for up. Does this have English subs?

But the English subtitles are very bad.

They are either made using some kind of automatic translator, or written by someone who doesn't know how form sentences in English.

Some examples:

?It has a boy in school who is afraid of apples.?

?Do not do these guys.?

?This trainee is a bag.?

?Stop, is with cold hands.?"
