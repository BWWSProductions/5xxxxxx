Pathfinder RPG

Has everything but the core rulebook and rise of the runelords

I figured u lazy bastards would be scouring the torrent sites and found the 

starter pack and downloaded at least those, if not well too bad for you.

As promised I will seed for 3 weeks, starting on 2/7/10 and ending on 2/21/10 also 

I only seed during 7:00 AM GMT - 4:00 PM GMT

Please seed, I know u guys want this
