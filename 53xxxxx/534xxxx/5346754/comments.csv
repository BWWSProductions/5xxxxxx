And fuck Microsoft for making us log in to anything just to save the game."
,davitodude,2010-02-13T02:09Z,I don't know if anybody else noticed this. But if you're playing online it forces you to do an update. When you accept it the crack is over written and you can no longer play on live with it. Kinda weak.

,bio1964,2010-02-14T03:12Z,"MULTIPLAYER QUESTION


Hi there, this is my first time having a problem, The game works perfectly, in single player, and I can start up Multi, but when i use my newly created live ""online"" account, it wants a serial key.

I was just going to assume, you can't play mutli, but I have been reading comments that state, you can????

Is there a way around the serial key prompt?

Any help would be great!

thanks"

,mundaft,2010-02-18T06:21Z,"@mawd2clan
I think you might need to put the 'bioshocklauncher' into the MP folder too."
,spacewolf2004,2010-02-18T08:48Z,"Game runs very well, no issues getting it to run when you follow the instructions...

My only issue is the fact that I can't get the resolution any higher than 720x480.  I've got my rig hooked up to a 50 inch tv, so this really makes the game look like shite :(

Anyone know any way to bump the resolution?"

Copy content of Razor1911 folder to the game installation dir and overwrite if needed.

then do the same for the missing file"
,forpittysake,2010-03-08T15:39Z,please help im a total newcomer (and a bit of a retard) downloaded the game installed it now i downloaded the crack & missing file and and have a clue what to do if someone  could give me a step by step (i mean as if you were trying to explain it to a drawing of a stupid person) ill buy you a fucking cake or something!
[T],Antje14,2010-03-08T23:39Z,"@forpittysake
Double click on the ""Crack"" folder then double click on the Razor1911 folder. Select both folders in there then right click and select Copy. Now goto ""My Computer"" or ""Computer"" in the start menu. Double click on ""C: Local Disk"", double click ""Program Files"", double click ""2k games"", double click ""BioShock 2"". Now right click on a empty space in that folder and select Paste and overwrite all files. Now go back to the missing file folder and copy Bioshock2Launcher.exe to ""2K Games\BioShock 2\SP\Builds\Binaries"".

I would like some delicious cake :)"

poor english, sorry."
,senskin,2010-05-02T04:16Z,"@Joksas, if you're using Windows 7, try right-clicking the .exe file for the game and setting compatibility mode to Vista with SP2. I had this problem with Crysis and it worked like a charm. "
,demonparia,2010-05-02T22:56Z,"Also, if you still can't use BioShock 2 with Windows 7 64-bit, try running it in compatibility mode for Windows 2000. Worked for me!

Also, is there a crack for the updated version of BioShock 2? Because I happen to have a working key (No, you can't have it), and I really want to be able to use it.

I need a crack for the most recent update so it won't ask for a CD, and it won't ask me to update. Please, I've looked everywhere..."
,ZeroDegreezCelcius,2010-05-06T01:08Z,So i have it to the point where it runs the logo name then it says bioshock2 has stopped running . . i am running Vista and nothing happens after it says that . . i wish i could play this game i've been waiting forever.
