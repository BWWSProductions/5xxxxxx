The film begins with a house at night. The owners, Larry and Gena Wharton (Diane Goldner), come home from a night of drinking. While Gena goes upstairs, Larry stays downstairs to read some mail. However, he finds that the lights dont work. Gena calls out for him, and so he rushes upstairs. In their bedroom they find a big red box. Larry assumes one of the workers mustve left it. On top of the box is the message for the collection. The box suddenly moves. Larry opens the box and is shocked to find whats inside. A hand suddenly reaches out and grabs Larry.
