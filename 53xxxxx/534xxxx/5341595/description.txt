From Wiki:


Dumb and Dumber is a 1994 American comedy film starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. It was written and directed by the Farrelly brothers, featuring slapstick comedy and gross-out humor. Dumb and Dumber contributed to the launch of a successful career for them and set the foundation for many Farrelly Brothers movies to come. It has a devoted cult following.

A prequel, Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd, which contained none of the original film's cast, was released in 2003 to poor critical reception, but a mild box office success.

Dumb and Dumber: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the original soundtrack to the film.

The song "The Rain, The Park, and Other Things" by The Cowsills was not in the soundtrack, although it was played quite prominently in the montage of Lloyd fantasizing about Mary, nor was "Pretty Woman" by Roy Orbison, though it was featured prominently in the make-over montage.

Also missing are "Rollin Down the Hill" by The Rembrandts, Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" by the Crash Test Dummies, "Red Right Hand" by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, "Can We Still Be Friends" by Todd Rundgren (who also wrote the original soundtrack), "Boom Shack-a-lak" by Apache Indian and "Make Love Now" by Patrick Wilson.
