Do anyone know if it is possible to use more than one mod at the same time in this game? Anyway, thanks for reading my question. :')"
,lolo66,2010-02-07T16:36Z,"I tried to mount it with Daemon Tools but when i mounted it nothing showed up and the setup.exe did not work either. Nothing showed up. It did show that it was mounted in the J drive.

Could someone help me please ? "
,brianxxx,2010-02-07T17:49Z,"@darlington

Yes, you can use numerous mods as long as they do not conflict with each other. You need to find websites dedicated to this game and to mods for further education.

Yeah this is the wrong place to ask those questions. This really is about the upload itself.

GOOGLE is your best friend. I still don't know why people just don't get that??? lol"

stop talking shit man, its you with the problem not the game.
finally a stalker.cop. that works and aint in russian.
cheers AITB.

lolo66.
all i did was exract with winrar to an ISO file then exracted the ISO to a new folder on the desktop, then i installed like any other download by clicking the setup application, the 1 with the nuclear thumbnail. after install i copied and replaced the xr.engine with the 1 in the razor1911 file and ran the game from stalker.COP, works perfect.
i tried running the setup.exe from power iso but nothing happened, i couldnt do anything with it so i extracted the iso using winrar. just keep extracting to a folder until you get the setup.exe with the nuclear symbol thumbnail, its a quick easy install from there on."

,bornshort,2010-02-08T13:02Z,"is it like fallout 3 or something?? :) couse what ive seen it reminds me of that game, but i can have misstaken me"
,lufal78,2010-02-08T14:06Z,"xray 1.6 engine has stop working, whats the problem>??"
,chuckmamuck,2010-02-08T20:35Z,"@lufal78.
use the crackfix mate frpm FTL3's comment above, he's put a link in the comment for it. i had a few crashes at first but since using the crackfix its been all good so far.

@bornshort.
nah its better than fallout3, you dont have to use all ya ammo to kill 1 enemy for a start. its got some similarities but its more an fps than it is rpg, fallout3 is more rpg, in my opinion anyway. you can go on good killing spree's in stalker, and it looks alot better."
,CrazyFikus,2010-02-09T09:19Z,"I have been trying to get this game to work for a while with no success, here is my problem: the game constantly crashes, and I do mean constantly, I can't run it longer than 5 min at a time and I have tried the one listed here by FTL3 and it doesn't work, tried several other cracks and they are all the same crack posted 5000 times all over the internet.
So I have tried downloading the game from a different torrent, didn't work, lowering the ingame settings would only cause of crashing every 6 min instead every of 5 min. After checking the forums no one had the same problem I did. Also the way the game crashes is strange, sometimes there is no error message, no nothing, the game just closes and I'm staring at my desktop like an idiot, several times the game just froze and i couldn't start the task manager and i had to reset my computer, several times the entire screen turned black and then the monitor gave me a no signal message.
Could you please help? I really want this game to work.

I'm running:
Processor - Intel Duo CPU     E6550  @ 2.33GHz
Video Card - ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT
RAM - 2048 MB
WinXP SP2

Also before you ask; updating the graphic card drivers did nothing, had no problem with fsgame.ltx. Starting the game isn't the problem, keeping it running is.

Oh and could someone please explain what is MASM and red wine is."
,lufal78,2010-02-09T14:08Z,"uhm it doesnt work either, im using win7 still xray engine is not responding"
,Miyaki01,2010-02-09T15:11Z,"Hi All,

Im getting a wierd problem and I'm hoping I can get a solution :)

I've downloaded the torrent, however I can even even get the rars to extract into an ISO.  All I keep getting is an error message from WinRAR saying that ""rzr-stcp.001.r00"" is required.  I have no idea where this file is as it wasnt in the large list of rars that were in the torrent.  So i've got no idea what I'm supposed to do?

Somebody please reply as I really liked the first 2 and the game doesnt come out in Australia until the 25th :(

Thanks, Miyaki01 "
,chuckmamuck,2010-02-09T15:24Z,"crazyfikus.
are you using any mods or a trainer with it?
when i 1st started playing i had the xrengine crashing a few times and it always crashed if i changed my weapons using the mouse scroll wheel. i changed the xrengine with crackfix one and used the number keys to select weapons and was able to progress in the game. after a few hours game play its ok now and i can use the scroll wheel to select weapons.
im using windows7 ultimatex64.
q9550 @ 4ghz
gtx 275 heavilly oc'd.
4gb ddr2 @ 1140mhz.
game settings maxed now ive got into the game and its not crashing like at the start. try the settings on low and see if you can get an hours game play going then increase the settings, thats what i did to stop it crashing back to desktop and it seems to have worked. "
,chuckmamuck,2010-02-09T15:31Z,"miyaki01.
try using powerISO to extract to an ISO file then extract the ISO with winrar. i could extract the files with powerISO but couldnt do anything with them, only see the extracted files so extracting them again with winrar to a new folder enabled me to install. "
,CrazyFikus,2010-02-09T15:57Z,"@chuckmamuck I'm not using any mods, and after turning everything down to the minimum I've been able to get a couple of hours of play at a time, but it still crashes and I would like to be able to play without worrying about it."
,chuckmamuck,2010-02-09T23:23Z,"crazyfikus.
go to Game Copy World and theres a russian no cd fix for version 1.6.02. i installed it earlier cus i couldnt use a trainer without it immediately crashing. its an installer so just click on it and it installs itself. after installing it the games alot more stable and works with trainers now also. its in russian but its only an installer so its obvious what you need to press, next and finish basically.  
you could also try disabling UAC too, that might help. 1 thing i read was that this xrengine keeps running in the background after it shuts down so i checked processes after ending the game and it was still running. after installing the russian crackfix thats stopped now. 
google stalker c.o.p. crashes, theres alot of good information about, it seems pretty common."
,CrazyFikus,2010-02-10T15:10Z,"chuckmamuck
After searching I found no one had a problem quite like mine (when i entered ""call of pripyat crash"" I mostly found comments about the game NOT crashing or crashing when first entering the Pripyat level). I have downloaded and installed the russian no-cd but it still crashed (twice), and WinXP doesn't have UAC.

Oh, and no one told me what are MASM and red wine these cracks keep mentioning."
,chuckmamuck,2010-02-10T20:47Z,"crazyfikus.
shit mate, its doing my head in now so you must be totally pissed off with it, i cant think what else could be causing it to crash so bad, unless its been made to utilize vista and 7 more than xp but i cant see that really.
where did you hear about red wine? ive heard people mention it before but im not really sure what it is, from memory i think its a program for compatibility with .dll files but im really not sure so if anyone could correct me on that then please do.
ive got a bit of spare time now so i'll have look to see if i can find anything else that might help cus the only other option is waiting for a new crack and that aint a good option when you want to play.

if anyone else is reading this and they've got any ideas at all then let crazyfikus know, its worth trying anything. the comments above will tell you the problem."
,CrazyFikus,2010-02-10T21:18Z,"chuckmamuck
thx mate"
,chuckmamuck,2010-02-10T21:40Z,"crazyfikus.
ive been having a look around and theres a few reports of the game having a major memory leak which explains the random crashing for everyone. alot of people are saying they can only run it with lowish settings even tho their system can easilly max it out. the most interesting thing is xp users complaining of constant crashing which sounds like your problem, and XP pro gets mentioned alot, are you using xp pro?
one guy was saying he was using xp pro and it constantly crashed so he installed win7 ultimate 64bit and problem solved, no more crazy crashing, thats the OS im using.
im just trying to see if anyones found a solution on xp, hopefully there is, its looking like thats the problem anyway mate. "
,CrazyFikus,2010-02-11T05:43Z,"chuckmamuck
Yes, I'm running XP Pro and I think you're right, I've been planning to install a new OS and I have a new reason to do it.
Big thanks for all your help so far"
,chuckmamuck,2010-02-11T11:08Z,"crazyfikus 
no problem at all mate.
ya spoilt for choice of OS's on here, i'd go for 7 ultimate, its finally a decent step up from xp cus vista wasnt, it was just more colorful."
,k07sk,2010-02-14T10:20Z,"this is riddick
i downloaded the game
but the files are ""001 Files"" or something, I tried mounting, extracting and the like but nothing... anyone got some secrets ive missed?"
,chuckmamuck,2010-02-16T22:03Z,"k07sk.
hey riddick, what i did was open the file with ultraISO, you can download it from here or from their website. then use it to extract the files to an ISO and then extract the ISO with winrar. you,ve then got the files in your selected extraction folder ready to install just by clicking setup.exe. you'll know when you've got it cus the setup.exe with have the nuclear symbol as the thumbnail.
just keep playing with extracting the files using ultraISO or powerISO and then winrar and you'll get there. took me a bit of playing around before i got there.

fel8901.
look up previous comments on this torrent, theres been alot of issues with crashing so try out some of the things above which have reduced it but not got rid of it im afraid to say. 
even people with the official game thats not needed to be cracked are having problems with crashing, especially with windows xp."
