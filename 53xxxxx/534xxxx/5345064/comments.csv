,koubicus,2010-02-28T10:25Z,"I did exactly what is written, replaced the the original GAMEUTIL.DLL file with the one from the File Archive. However it doesn't work. The error ""THIS APPLICATION HAS FAILED TO START BECAUSE XLIVE.DLL WAS NOT FOUND. RE-INSTALLING THE APPLICATION MAY FIX THE PROBLEM.

I installed the game from this torrent - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5390286/Vancouver_2010_%5BPC%5D

Thanks for your help"
