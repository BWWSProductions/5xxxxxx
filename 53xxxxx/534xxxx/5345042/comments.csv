how do i fix this?"
,Thunderhead2772,2010-05-29T23:45Z,@leovibe did you try reinstalling it?
,Hammer1974,2010-06-16T12:03Z,"Installed but when I go to play game it tells me to insert original game disc not back-up.
Anyone help please?
Thank you."
,Thunderhead2772,2010-06-17T04:23Z,"@Hammer1974

try reinstalling. if that doesn't work, it may be becuase you have a 64bit system. lego batman doesnt work on 64bit. if neither of those helped, then i don't know"
,Hammer1974,2010-06-17T08:09Z,"@ Thunderhead2772,
Thank you for the response. yes I have a Win7 64bit.
Its funny how it don't work when I had Lego Star Wars work perfectly fine.
But anyway thanky uo once again mate."

yeah didn't do anything"
,Thunderhead2772,2010-07-03T02:09Z,@leovibe ok did you put the binkw32.dll file in this torrent into system32 folder?
,leovibe,2010-07-03T02:47Z,"@ Thunderhead2772
 well, i put it where the notepad document and this page says to put it (C:\Program Files\Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment\LEGO Batman)
but it still says that"
,Thunderhead2772,2010-07-03T13:46Z,ok the only other explanation would be if you have a 64bit system. this game doesnt work on 64bit.
,anjayozzy,2010-09-27T14:13Z,Works perfectly on Windows 7 64 bit. Use Daemon Tools and Y.A.S.U.
