There were 13 episodes in 2009 of Wallander on BBC4. THE original Swedish Wallander! 

BBC Four ENGLISH subtitles, not google.

Unfortunately I had trouble getting them from the HDD onto a DVD. 
 
I have episode 11/13 - Blood Line and 12/13 - The Joker, which I gladly share.   If I can catch the reruns and get them onto a DVD I will do so and post them.

The original Swedish versions are the best in my humble opinion.  Kenneth Branagh is good but for me the original is better.  The Henning Mankell books best!


SORRY, I goofed!  This is episode 11/13 - Blood Line (not The Joker): Following an argument with her lover on her boat, a woman is found dead. 

90 minutes
