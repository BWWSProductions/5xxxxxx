,zxthedark,2010-05-21T23:03Z,i installed it and i can not play it.. gives me some bullshit like: DISK NOT IN CD DRIVE i mean what the fuck? answer me now
,n00bftw,2010-07-03T16:44Z,"I've got the game successfully installed, it runs and i've beaten most of the campaign, but when i try running multiplayer internet, it says it needs my CD key. Can you just post this or did i do something wrong during the install or what?"
,fanblade6,2010-07-13T04:00Z,Installed and replaced AVP2 file. i try to run and press detail button and says missing Lithtech.exe?? It will not install this during intall.
,n00bftw,2010-07-16T22:44Z,So I read somewhere that the AVP2 servers have been taken down. Which I believe means multiplayer is a negatory. So The CD-key is a non issue. Sad Face. Campaign is still badass tho.
,Yari77,2010-09-11T10:55Z,"Thanks a lot man!
It works perfectly!
Just burn AVP_DISK1 en AVP_DISK2 on cd/dvd and install te game. Then you paste the file that say''Can not find AVP.Rez file''in program files after the install. And then you can play.

ENJOY!"

Just installed it perfectly by using power iso
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6566450/PowerISO_v4.8___Serials_%5BChattChitto_RG%5D
download it mount the second disk and unzip the first one (the setup is in this disc) and when it asks for the second one just choose when you choose to mount the disk
thanks for the torrent
btw I'm running win 7 ultimate 64 bit"
