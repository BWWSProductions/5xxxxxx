If you own a Casio PF8000 or you are just interested in obtaining the manual for it, I've compiled a fully indexed and search-able PDF English Language version for you to download.

The Pf8000 came out around 1980 which makes it a vintage hand held electronic Filofax of sorts


The manual is extremely hard to come by
