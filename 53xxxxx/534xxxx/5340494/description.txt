Murder Rooms - The White Knight Stratagem: Dr. Joseph Bell helps the police investigate the murder of a money lender, but old animosity between him and the officer in charge leads to conflict, with matters becoming worse when Doyle sides with the lieutenantâ€™s theories over Bellâ€™s.

Murder Rooms: The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes is a BBC television drama series originally broadcast in 2000 and 2001. It was inspired by the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based the character of Sherlock Holmes on his tutor at the University of Edinburgh Dr Joseph Bell, and that Bell did occasionally do forensic work for the Edinburgh police. The series exaggerated the similarity between Bell and Holmes for dramatic effect, with Doyle acting as Watson, and included several scenes from the books (the assumption being that these would later inspire Doyle's fiction).
