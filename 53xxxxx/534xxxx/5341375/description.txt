Harry Enfield stars once again in a brand new full-cast dramatisation of Douglas Adams' second "Dirk Gently" novel, directed by the award-winning Dirk Maggs. Harry Enfield exuberantly returns as 'Dirk Gently', who, fallen on hard times and dressed as a gypsy woman, is using his irritatingly accurate clairvoyant powers to read palms. He is saved when a frantic client turns up with a ludicrous story about being stalked by a goblin waving a contract accompanied by a hairy, green-eyed, scythe-wielding monster. When Detective Superintendent Gilks decides a headless body found in a sealed room is the result of a particularly irritating suicide, Dirk is plunged into a mystery where the interconnectedness of all things is tested to the limit...This is the second of three series adapted from the "Dirk Gently" books, directed by Dirk Maggs (chosen by Douglas Adams to conclude the award-winning "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"). Guest stars include Peter Davison ("Doctor Who"), Jan Ravens ("Dead Ringers"), Philip Jackson ("Poirot"), John Fortune ("Bremner, Bird & Fortune"), Morwenna Banks ("Absolutely"), Stephen Moore ("The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy") and returning cast members Olivia Colman ("Peep Show"), Jim Carter ("The Golden Compass") and Billy Boyd ("The Lord Of The Rings"). This CD contains over thirty minutes of additional unbroadcast material.
