Synopsis:
"In late 1993, Ice Cube releases his 4th full length album (5th if you count Kill At Will EP). He still has some heat in his often angry social and political lyrics. But, he does chill a litle more, as do the beats. Beatwise, this is my favorite Cube album. Sir Jinx, Laylaw (Above the Law), QD III, Madness 4 Real, 88X Unit, and Brian G lace cube up with some smokin' G-Funk beats. His previous albums had some funky beats that were more pre g-funk and more raw, while these are more polished. QD III laced "You Know How We Do It" is one of my favorite g-funk songs of all time. The beat is sunny and laidback with a touch of soul, and there is a piercing whiny synth making the joint a great one to roll to. Cube's rhymes add to the relaxed effect of this classic. "Ghetto Bird" is a pulsating joint where Cube flees the cops, ducks the police chopper, jacks someone's ride, and goes to his woman's house and digs her out. The beat is bouncy with another whiny synth. "Make It Ruff, Make It Smooth" (f/ K-Dee) is a raucous good time. Cube is the ruff loc, and K-Dee is the smooth mack over a bouncy, twangy lowrider beat. "When I Get To Heaven" is a little more controversial. He discusses the corruptness and emptiness of the church declaring it "nuthin' but a fashion show." He knocks on religion. Take it how you want you to. The beat is chill and twangy and has a cool vibe with a flute in the hook. "Lil A-- Gee" is a tale of a younster growin' up fast and causin' trouble and panic mad young. "Cave B----" is an angry, controversial, and somewhat humorous knock on white women and how Ice Cube wants nothing to do with them. The beat has a little more East Coast bump to it and sounds dope in the system. Then we have the full album version of "Bop Gun(One Nation)," a p-funk meets g-funk classic with George Clinton adding his gruff vocals and Ice Cube gettin' it crunk, a dope g-party jam. This version is 11 minutes long! The beat "Enemy" has the early Ice Cube vibe to it with angry lyrics and an old-school beat sounding circa Death Certificate. Ice Cube still uses the c-word towards white folks like on the older albums here. This is the 2003 re-release, and there are 4 bonus tracks- mixes for "What Can I Do" (Westside Mix, and Eastside Mix), the former a lowrider ready bouncer, and the latter a jazzy a-la-Tribe Called Quest, QD III's awesome remix for "You Know How We Do It," and N.O. Joe's Eerie Gumbo Funk mix for "Lil' A-- Gee," and his version has that Texas Mobb style he is known for and a sick whiny synth. As for the album, I feel it's a classic for anyone lovin' gangsta rap, G-Funk, controversial and social aware rap because it caters to all those milieu."
