,Sdenisew,2010-02-07T23:24Z,just used this torrent and so far it's great! Thanks so much for this!
,twistquist,2010-02-08T01:17Z,I can confirm that this works!
,twistquist,2010-02-08T02:05Z,Anyone know where can I find a crack or a serial that works for the demo of adobe fireworks cs4 that is also on the adobe website?
,sdevo,2010-02-08T06:30Z,"Thanks q8phantom
Yes this does work successfully. Remember only for the  Mac version.
1 Download the trial app and install it into your apps folder on your hard drive.
2 Drag the PSElements8 app into the ""Fix permissions.app Krack first. It takes only a couple of seconds.
3 Then drop the same PSElements8 app into the second PSE window from q8phantom. Again takes only a matter of 10 seconds and lets you know that you have successfully Kracked the app.
4 Works, without having to use ""Little Snitch"" in your firewall or using/registering a serial number. Lovely."
,q8phantom,2010-02-08T10:43Z,Thank you for providing the steps! :)

,wveeser1,2010-02-10T01:43Z,I am having problems.  I uninstalled old version of Photoshop elements 8.  Installed version from Adobe website.  When  I try to take the Elements 8 app and drag it over crack I get a circle with line through it.  Crack does not seem to do anything.  Any suggestions? 
,wveeser1,2010-02-10T01:46Z,"sorry using MAC OSX 10.6.2

,jhlh7,2010-02-13T01:52Z,"just double click the ""fix permissions.app"", enter master password and then something will pop up. after this then double click the other pse window. its there you drag the trial and you will be all set"

,lyndsay02289,2010-02-19T10:58Z,This does NOT work. Bull sh*t.
,caseylynn,2010-02-23T06:13Z,"I cant figure out how to get it to work. I downloaded the trial okay, and the krack too. but i dont know where to get the file to drag to the fix permissions. the two files are in there together but i cant drop one into the other. help :)?"
,caseylynn,2010-02-23T07:35Z,alright now im getting and error where it just says there was an error and to relaunch. plus. my computer now plays sorta like commercials? lol without anything open. Mac virus???? lol
,pumperz,2010-03-07T20:33Z,"I am very new - can someone explain what the ""fix permissions.app krack - I only saw one file in this torrent and I can't find a fix permissions w/i the software itself - please help -TIA"
,pumperz,2010-03-07T20:48Z,think I figured it out - got the all is good msg - awesome! TY q8phantom I have been looking for this for a WHILE!
,yanki01,2010-03-12T06:24Z,"tried dragging the krack to the fix permissions app and it wont let me, it shows the no symbol? what do i do? i have the free version downloaded. Mac OS 10.6.2"
,IpodTouchGuy,2010-04-09T20:38Z,"Right. I was really confused as it is not quite clear.
1. Download the trail from link provided.
2. download this torrent.
3. Once both downloads have completed, open the trial and click on the folder.
4. run setup and select trial version.
5. let it do its thing installing yadda yadda yadda
6. Once installed open the torrent dmg and drag both to your hard drive. run fix permissions. when it says you can now apply the [k], close it and run the other file, Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 [k] (INTEL).app
7. Drag the app from your applications folder. It will be in the adobe photoshop elements folder.
8. It does its job and the app now works! 
9. Thank q8phantom VERY MUCH and seed for a week.
10. Smile"

@q8phantom and ipodtouchguy"
,dw4tpb,2010-07-14T02:24Z,"To answer the unanswered questions, the download consists of 2 small applications. The first is the Fix Permissions app, the second is the PSE window.nnAfter dragging and dropping the PSE8 icon to the first, I had to double click the Fix app & enter my admin password to get anything to happen.nnThe PSE app (second one) has to be double clicked to open it to a small window. Then drag and drop the PSE8 icon there, and watch for the success message."
