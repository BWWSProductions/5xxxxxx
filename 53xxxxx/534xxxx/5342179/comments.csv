,Jaebodiah,2012-02-13T08:01Z,@gregmb60 do YOU realize you're illegally pirating music?  Not much room to talk right?  That isn't very christian of you.  You come to TPB you're gonna have to put up with some vulgar language...deal.  Or go buy the album and support the artist.
,gregmb60,2012-02-14T18:06Z,"@Jaebodiah: I refuse to use vulgar language on here. And as far as supporting them, I support them by attending their concerts. And you're on here, too, so that doesn't make you any better than anyone else."
