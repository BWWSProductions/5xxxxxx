Ludwig van Beethoven
Symphony Nos. 1 & 2
The Cleveland Orchestra
Christoph von Dohnanyi
1964
FLAC

DohnÃ¡nyi's enduring fame owes largely to a relationship with the Cleveland Orchestra that would span two decades. He made his conducting debut with the orchestra in December 1981, and his appointment to serve as music director (commencing with the start of the 1984-85 season) was announced the following year. At the time of DohnÃ¡nyi's appointment, he was a relatively young unknown in the shadow of the famously autocratic George Szell, who had forged the orchestra into a world-class ensemble by the time of his death in 1970.[3] DohnÃ¡nyi's kinship with Szell both in terms of musical training and micro-managerial conducting style portended that his relationship with the orchestra would be a successful one. In DohnÃ¡nyi's 18 year tenure at its helm, the Cleveland Orchestra was sometimes touted as the finest orchestra in the United States and among the finest in the world, pursuing an active touring and recording agenda. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_von_Dohn%C3%A1nyi
