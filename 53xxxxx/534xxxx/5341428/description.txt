Planet Of The Apes

By Pierre Boulle.

Michael Maloney reads the classic French novel which was a huge film hit in 1967.

Abridged by Jane Purcell



1: It is the year 2500, and a team of French astronauts make the first interstellar journey to the star Betelguese, where they discover a planet very like the Earth, but with one or two surprises.

02: Captured by the gorillas, Ulysse is being transported to a new life.

03: Ulysse has failed to persuade his monkey captors that he is anything other than another human, but there is some compensation. He is sharing his cell with the beautiful Nova. Will she be enough to keep him there?

04: Ulysse has been recognised as an intelligent human from another planet, and is living happily amongst the monkeys. But there are shocks in store that will change all that forever.

05: Ulysse is unaware of the forces grouping against him, but he is becoming a threat even to his friends. Events come to a head in the final part of the sci-fi thiller.
