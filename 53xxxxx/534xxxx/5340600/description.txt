"So, I walk backstage, and there he was, Chester Burnett, the inventor of Rock and Roll. I had a brand new Stratocaster with me, and I hold it up to him, and say, 'Man! Play my guitar.' He turns around and says, 'Fuck off.'" - Lowell George on meeting Howlin' Wolf

Howlin' Wolf learned to play guitar from the one and only Delta blues great Charlie Patton, but he didn't really make his dent in the music industry until his electrifying recordings for Chess Records in the 50s. Along with Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf is still considered the definitive Chicago-style blues artist, and to modern ears, Wolf's unique blend of raw guitar sounds and growling vocals sounds a lot like rock & roll at its wildest. It's easy to hear Howlin' Wolf's influence on several well-known, white blues-inspired rockstars, from Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck to modern day indie artists such as Jon Spencer, Jack White, and Billy Childish.
