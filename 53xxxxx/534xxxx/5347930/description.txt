Release Length:  1h 33mn
Storyline: 
 In a world 10 years into the future, vampires make up the vast majority of the population with
 only 5% of the human race remaining. This presents particular challenges as the vampires' food
 supply - human blood - is dwindling and rationing is now the norm. There is growing evidence that
 vampires deprived of an adequate blood supply are themselves evolving into wild, vile creatures
 that attack anyone and anything in order to survive. Dr. Edward Dalton, a vampire and hematologist
 who works for a pharmaceutical firm, has been working on finding an artificial blood supply that
 will meet the vampire society's needs. He is sympathetic to humans and sees his work as a way of
 alleviating their suffering but his views on finding a solution change considerably when he meets
 someone who found a way to transform himself from being a vampire to again take human form.
