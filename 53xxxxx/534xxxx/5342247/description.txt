This is the concert Chris Rea performed, with Paul Casey as a special guest for the opening, in Bucharest, Romania, on 6 february 2010. It was recorded in stereo  from public with a dictaphone, mp3 format at 320 kbps (max possible quality for the device) as a single file and splitted track by track with Audacity.
The sound is quite good, if you ignore a few cracks along 2 hours of performance. The 23 tracks are: 3 with the public, 4 with Casey and the rest with Rea.
Some songs don't have the right title, if someone knows the titles please comment so the other users can edit them. Also comment about the quality. I say is good, but i know i'm subjective.

Hope you like it!
