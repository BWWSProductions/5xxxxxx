,Sheiko,2010-03-12T23:32Z,"I downloaded, when i mount cd one i don't auto run, so i open and use setup.. it installs fine till it ask for cd 2 then i can't make it work.. any help?"
,xvkremvx,2010-03-20T14:57Z,"Mount CD 1 with Daemon Tools, run the auto.exe. When it asks for CD 2, unmount cd1, then mount cd 2. When It asks to put back cd 1, un mount cd 2, mount cd 1 back."
,stitches242,2010-05-15T09:55Z,"What are the CD 1 and CD 2 image names? I cant find them when Im trying to mount to Daemon.

Ive tried bo2 mounting it but an error occurs saying binkw32.dll was not found."
,torrents2go,2010-05-16T16:00Z,"It works fine once installed i used Daemon Tools to mount CD 1 and run Autorun.exe then when the installation asks for CD 2 unmount CD1 and Mount CD 1  and then vise versa , i started playing the game but i dont know if it happened to anyone else but sometimes it just freezes up so i have to close the game."
,shrek15001,2010-05-31T17:49Z,you guys need to learn how to mount more then just 1 iso at a time mount both iso's and no need to unmount and mount back and forth
,shrek15001,2010-05-31T18:01Z,extra info on Daemon Tools i forgot to mention the add extra virtual drive once you Daemon Tools up where it shows your one drive right click down there to bring up a pop up menu and click add scsi virtual drive you should be set to go from there
,sf737,2010-07-04T10:49Z,"It won't work on me. When I insert the first disc(yes I burned these iso's into blank CD-R's) it says that I need to insert the original disc. Apparently the patch doesn't do anything unless the game is installed first,which unfortuantely isn't a do-able thing for me :(
I'm a Windows 7 user but I doubt that this has to do anything with the problem I'm having installing the game.
Any help is very much appreciated"
,chitopsy,2010-09-15T02:54Z,.its aking for the Original CD 2 of B.O.what shall i do guys.help me out plz?
,DigFunk,2010-10-17T08:20Z,"I notice this doesn't have many seeders right now, only 2 I think. I'm downloading Soul Reaver 1, then 2, then this torrent...as soon as I have it, I'll seed to at least 2 or 3 ratio so it can get out there but other people better keep seeding afterwards!!"
,Caliber1,2011-02-19T11:47Z,"When this downloads, and if it works, I'm gonna go all out and seed to 20! AT THE LEAST!"
,BigBos23,2011-05-11T19:19Z,"ok, so i know im doing everything right here, i inset cd1, start install then it asks for cd2 i mount that, then it asks for cd1 again i mount it and right when it gets to the end of the install it chrashes on me. any help would be awsome thanks"
,mrman5800,2012-06-04T19:08Z,"Works perfectly.  To help with installation, having 2 virtual drives would speed up the process (installer automatically finds them).

Don't forget to seed or else your downloading will suffer."
,tikimiky,2012-07-01T20:44Z,"hi, downloading it now, will seed after finished. looking forward for this game. thanks a milion for the upload!!"
