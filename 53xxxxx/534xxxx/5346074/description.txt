IMAGiNE NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

Here we are again with another version of daybreakers, but this time it's the R5. Couple of things first thanks to Rx for the cleaned up audio (nice work) and also if you have any of the other you might not want this as there is probably only some slight difference between them all.....neither the less this is our version were throwing into the mix.

Video source used was the russian dvd9 (thanks) muxed with the Rx audio (thanks).....We've opted to slightly tweak the video..colouring, birghtness, contrast and also ran a HI Q smoother over it as well.

Anyway better late than never...enjoy.
