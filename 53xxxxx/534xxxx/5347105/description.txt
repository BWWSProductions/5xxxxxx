=== NOTE :: someone [GCN?] chopped about a minute from the beginning of each hour on this day's broadcast ===




This week, Tarpley looks at US/China relations and how Iran fits into the equation.  He gives highlights from Hillary Clinton's speech at a French military academy in which she declares that China MUST vote in favor of sanctions against Iran in the UN.  Webster also discusses a couple of other ways the US. is further endangering Chinese relations -- Taiwan arms sales, meddling in Tibet and the Google/NSA alliance.  


Tarpley's Icelandic correspondent is a guest in the first hour, for an update on the international debt situation there.


In hour 2, Webster moves on to economic analysis of the US and their partners in crime.  


Phil Berg [obamacrimes.com] makes his usual appearance at the end of the show.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
