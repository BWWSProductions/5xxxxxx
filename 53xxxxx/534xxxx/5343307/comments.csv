,zanoo,2010-02-16T01:39Z,"1) thanks for all your Effort, Hard Work and Devotion, not only to search & find, but to download, capture, transfer, convert, and finally to upload for sharing, this Incredible Lost Series !! And all of that under the cloak of anonymity!
2) i have been searching for years, for even a string of substance, to locate episodes, much less the entire series, so i certainly appreciate your incredible ability to produce and share. 
3) please continue as promised. you are our only hope of resurrecting the entire series.
4) please don't mind the greedy f*ckers who aren't sharing. over 40 leechers who disappear as soon as they finish each episode...shameful, especially on this newly discovered series. 
5) i will continue to seed (as others will) until the series is complete, and then some.... i love this series, and want to keep it available, for future generations of leechers.
6) considering that this just popped it's head up , after being absolutely nowhere for 10 years, except in peoples' memories, it's amazing how many people have been fruitlessly searching, (like me), to find it, as soon as you present it. for those of us who like/love it, it is a Hidden Treasure !
7) warning: there is a spanish version of this, with a different title, but it is horribly dubbed by spanish voice actors - a real embarrassment, with no hidden english tracks. beware.
8) ty again! thank you, thank you, thank you !!"
