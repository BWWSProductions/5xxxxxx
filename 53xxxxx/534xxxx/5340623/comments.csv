[V],ill88eagle,2010-02-11T11:02Z,"mjs820: Max compression and less of a mess on my harddrive - if you load the .cue file with vlc or winamp you get the entire tracklist just as if you put a cd in your drive. 

If you prefer separate files there are several free flac tools that can split the flac img's for you. I can higly recommend cuetools: http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=66233"
