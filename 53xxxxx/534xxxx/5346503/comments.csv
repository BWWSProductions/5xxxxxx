Am dling Being human...I always share torrents as long as I can...Often share more than dl at moment.. illnesss makes it hard to watch some times.. my head doesnt work as well as it should..
You spoke about using fire wall to block certain peeps..Where do I go to learn how to do that..apologies..I know this has been discussed already..Chemo brain means I need a simple step process to follow."

About firewall: Install COMODO firewall. It is the best, a free one. I suggest to Google a link. It may take a while to make firewall to learn about applications you use-what to allow and which ones not. Also, you need a week or two to get comfortable. It is very wide subject and you must rely on Help, but basically you have nothing worry about, it works as-is right from the box.
Anyway, you must install program named PeerBlock, he is also free, the best and automatically blocks 106 million (!) IP addresses of any type that may cause harm or troubles to P2P. Aside from that, you can see any IP address of all peers, her names and countries in uTorrent's lower part of the window. Anything suspicious (read what I wrote carefully) block with COMODO doing ""My blocked Network zones"">""Add"">""New blocked IP address"">""A single IP address"" or ""range"" where you write-in such IP addresses/numbers.
