its reasonable speed but we need more seeds
this might be most peoples only way to get on this free beta
im gonna seed 2:1 maybe 4:1 depending on how long it takes to d/l

,Canertocks,2010-02-06T19:34Z,I will seed this til end of beta
,RMJ13,2010-02-06T19:49Z,"3.5 gig for a beta with a ship load of patches!?  somethin tells me this game  is gonna suck!
\
 maybe they should Get better coders"
,ridikulass,2010-02-06T20:15Z,"a good coder makes a game that doesnt take up so much space and is well compressed, the more memory a game takes up the weaker the compression. also a game doesnt need to take up alot of space to be a good game"
,Canertocks,2010-02-06T21:37Z,"Its a pretty big game guys, its very little considered age of conan on 30 GB..."

,Saerain,2010-06-04T07:35Z,@RMJ13: Did you just wake up from 1999 or something? 3.5 GB is very small for an open-world MMO. Even in 2007 the average was somewhere between 8 and 20 GB.
