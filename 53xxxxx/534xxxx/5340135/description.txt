Inside the world of these endangered gentle giants

Wonders to behold, whales are the giants of the sea, but centuries of whale hunting and harvesting their blubber has severely crippled their populations. The only way to save these gentle giants now is to research them in their natural habitats, giving scientists a perspective on the health and behavior of these great animals.

Braving the treacherous Atlantic Ocean, crew members of sailing ship Sedna IV set off to learn more about whales and their hunters on this historic, documented mission. Narrated by David Suzuki, Whale Mission delves deeply into the dangers from which whale populations, to this day, still have not recovered.
