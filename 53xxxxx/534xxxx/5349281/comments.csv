,lolzwut,2010-02-13T18:05Z,"When I try to run the game, I get ""Application has failed to start because xlive.dll was not found.""
why call this a RIP if it doesn't fucking work after I install it? Also the installer is full of fucked up characters, is this even an english copy?"
,lolzwut,2010-02-13T18:27Z,"nevermind my last comment, the game works fine if you install games for windows live and make an offline profile. could have used a Readme file though."

,zidane94,2010-02-22T03:23Z,"@adamh9 compressed means the file is turned from 7 gig to 4 gig, removing some files from the game, in this case the MP support."
,biogenesiss,2010-03-11T05:53Z,"These bioshock 2 rips for PC are BS!! I downloaded this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5347317/BioShock_2_%5BPC___ENG_ITA_DEU%5D%5BRazor1991%5D  In game play when you try to save; sometimes the save option is there but most of the time it isn't so when you been playing for an hour and decide you want to save, you press esc to save and find that the save option ISN'T THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! why the FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?! I'm guessin this rip has the same issue, because it's A RIP!!!!!!! I don't know why you people upload this shit when all it does is frustrate people to no end.. "
