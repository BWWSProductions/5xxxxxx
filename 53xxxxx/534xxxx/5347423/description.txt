FSX classics Hangar FW-190 A5 t/m A9 variants

This is one of the best WWII fighter aircraft available for FSX right up there with RealAir's Spit and the later A2A planes, a must have imo.


Included in this package are the updates till v1.2, 
and i have added the swastika tail markings for those who want it historical correct!

The early 190 versions are allready available here.


credits are not on me!
