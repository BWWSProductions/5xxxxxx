,captinjake,2010-02-11T07:54Z,Can we have FSADDON LYSADER please???
,olicopter,2010-02-12T16:59Z,"Thank you very much!!! It's a very very nice plane, much better than the first version!!
However I have a question for you... Sometimes the plane stops and I cannot restart it. Have you an idea which could be the problem? Are there some other people with the same problem?
Concerning the swastika, which is indeed correct, where could I find it for the BF 109???
Once more, thank you very much!!!"
,sunburst31,2010-02-12T20:05Z,"Olicopter,

Maybe you damaged the engine because you can damage it if you push to hard for a long time.

about the 109 maybe they are repaints only so you should look at avsim.com maybe?"
,olicopter,2010-02-12T23:55Z,"Sunburst31, thank you for your quick answer!!
This brings me than to another question... I have noticed that if I switch off FSX and I switch it on again, than the plane starts. This means that if I damage the engine, I should not be able to fly this plane anymore, as long as I remain in the same session of FSX? (I hope my English is understandable...)
Another interesting question... Do you know Alphasim Beechcraft T-34C Turbo Mentor?? This is a very nice plane too and it never starts. It seems many persons have the same problem. Do you know something about??
Thanks again for your answer!!
Have a nice day!!
