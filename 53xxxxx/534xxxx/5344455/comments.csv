,NvySEAL667,2010-02-08T02:26Z,"You forgot to put the pmdgoptions.dll cracking part in the readme. When you follow your instructions, and test the gauges, you get a PMDGoptions.dll error."
,NvySEAL667,2010-02-08T04:42Z,"Alright, I reinstalled it and remembered to use the pmdgoptions.dll crack on my own lol, and this indeed works 100%. Can you install liveries with this?"
,1742,2010-02-08T07:11Z,"So you mention you were ""I was one second to buy this one though. but then I came to conclusion that even if i buy, it won't make any difference as my PMDG 747-400X is pirated."" So where do you actually download the actual aircraft would really love some help here, been looking for it since it came out. Thanks"
,NvySEAL667,2010-02-08T08:16Z,Confirmed you can install liveries on this! :D
,sciencepilot,2010-02-08T20:43Z,"i didnt forget to put the PMDGoptions.dll because there is no need to put that! if you follow the intructions correctly then the pmdg setup will create a legit pmdgoptions.dll to your dlls folder. what really matters is not the pmdgoptions.dll, is your aircraft.cfg that should have that long code on the begin sha1. and in order for that code to appear, you must type something wen installing the PMDG 747 (email address etc) then click validate "
,sciencepilot,2010-02-08T20:44Z,"this is actually the main thing to put automaticly the correct BEGIN SHA1 code to ur aircraft.cfg .. but anyway, as long as everything worked out for you guys, is what really matters :) 


reply to 1742:  sorry, i wasnt specific when i said that, the PMDG 747 and the expansion (747-8i) are legit and real PMDG addon aircraft. they are not ""cracked"" they are legit downloads from PMDG website. (if u buy from there website you will face the same setup basicly, except that you will have the right serial) however, because we cant have the serial as it connects to the internet, we use 2 ways to crack it: enable bottun and pmdgoption.dll (sometimes) just to pass thro security and to hav the gauges working. after that, the aircraft is fully working and real from there company. hence why you can update from there site ;) if this was ""fake"" we couldnt update at all. Peace"
,sciencepilot,2010-02-09T01:28Z,"rvlasek why dont you just read the instructions that i wrote for you too instead of assuming something that no one has ever said? i dont clearly know what it does, but what i DOESNT do is download something ""new"" as it clearly says on the website too that you must have the PMDG 747-400 installed already in order to use this expansion. ""expansion"" does not mean the full product, but an addon or ""expansion"" of the current product (pmdg 747) that you have! so dont worry about it. just follow my instructions or risk it yourself by simply installing it, if it works, im glad it did :) (seriously) if it didnt, well u know were to read, or if it doesnt help, ask here but with details to the issue."
,JohnsonPBX,2010-02-09T16:44Z,"Uhhh... Sorry if I missed something but lol, the instructions are all very cute and shit, but where the fuck do I get the 747-8 expansion executable?! Thanks :P"
,NvySEAL667,2010-02-09T17:24Z,"@sciencepilot
yeah it didn't create a legit dll for me for some reason. it's all working now though and the soundset it awwwwesome.

,sciencepilot,2010-02-10T15:33Z,1742: u talking about wen u are installing the PMDG 747-400? or the PMDG 747-800i? and what operating system do you have? did u right click to install as admin on the setup? be abit specific with the issue mate ;) 
,JohnsonPBX,2010-02-11T01:37Z,"Lol yeah, thanks anyway. And fuck lol, this demostrates the TPB search engine sucks, I just found a link today (not the one Nvy posted), but thanks to your instructions I could install it; it's a bit tricky at the beginning but has a nice reward, loving the plane's sound :) Thanks!"
,1742,2010-02-11T05:25Z,"well it's the 8i iam running vista and i am running it as an administrator also I get this error message, after entering the fake information and that, then I press validate the message is as follows: Unable to validate your license please contact pmdg technical support then the program closes.

I've tried this about 8 times but still no joy. and yes I am using the enable button.
thanks for your help"

works great!"
,sciencepilot,2010-02-11T14:01Z,"ffs sake you people fuking are lazy! you rather download a very cool addon for FSX in TPB instead of buying it! which i cant complain because i do the same thing, but NOT even reading the full instructions? thats just pure lazyness!! i know, i wrote alot, ""sorry"" is because theres people that like to go on step by step! but just read, and thats it! ur done, saved you cash and problems!"
,wickette,2010-02-11T15:41Z,thanks sciencepilot for the upload but  if my pmdg 747 400 is already installed with a manually put sha1 code and a cracked pmdgoptions.dll do you think i'll be able  to install you expansion normallly  ;)   thanks again dude 
,wickette,2010-02-11T16:30Z,sorry just read again the pdf and i found my answer you did write a lot..thanks again for the (big)time you gave for that tutorial
,sciencepilot,2010-02-11T23:56Z,"new welcome wickette ;) again my apologies for the long tut.

anice1983 im sorry but i havent had time to install the MD 11, have u install already? what does it show? black gauges? let me know of the issue. then i might be able to help u out. "
,wickette,2010-02-12T00:54Z,"I had the 744x installed with a cracked pmdgoptions a manually put sha1 code and a 2.1 reg and i can confirm that your method works fine with it (you want have to do everything from the beginning if you have the cracked 744x 2.10 just begin with the host thing  system32/drivers/etc...
sciencepilot your method is just awesome..;)"
,1742,2010-02-12T01:36Z,"excuse me fuckwit, if that was directed at me about being lazy I'd be carful if I was you because I know your IP adress and could easily hack your coputer and destroy all your information."
,1742,2010-02-12T01:41Z,you've been fucking warned
,sciencepilot,2010-02-12T04:35Z,"1742  ur a joker right? first off u lil prick i said ""you people"" in general because NOT only u, quite a few werent reading my tut, and if my last comment offended u, u should shut the F up or jus say something ""nice"" and i would apologise to u son!? and hey since ur much of a hacker surely u should know that it takes more then jus an IP address to hack into my system and since u know how to ""hack"" (maybe jus thro LAN) why didnt u ""hack"" the PMDG 747-800i yourself instead of readin my tutorial without even having to finish reading? surely this wouldnt be a problem to u, u lil hacker? im waiting for you, since u know my IP address =) maybe its coz u dont know who u messin with, and by u tryng to""hack"" me u end up gettin ur pC fuked up by ""someone""..? u better be careful with what ur dealing with...i aint you."
,sciencepilot,2010-02-12T04:41Z,"wickette thanks for the gd comment :) 

now i got a new problem, try to put the MD 11 all 2gether with this one. anice1983 dont worry, i hav MD 11 on my system already so i will find out whats the problem, i will let u know soon :) keep lookin around here. however if u found a solution before me let know how u did. Peace"
,1742,2010-02-12T07:41Z,"well, I guess I should apologise I did go off the deep end. Anyway with the amount of work I have at the moment, your comment sort of did send me over the edge. Even if it wasn't entirely referring to me.

anyway once again I am truly sorry ;)"
,wickette,2010-02-12T09:05Z,@sciencepilot i think you'll have to crack your pmdgoptions.dll for md11 to work and modifiy the aircraft.cfg  not sure but when i installed both 747-4x and md11 i had to do this method
,sciencepilot,2010-02-12T18:49Z,"1742, no worries, my apologies for not being specific anyway, i tend to type alot and barely be specific to the point. 

anice1983 i done it! this is what i did: i installed it...
thats it lol simple as that, i obviously put fake email and serial etc...then click validate, some error came up, it didnt terminate my setup, i used the enable bottun to press next, and that it, fully working without any black gauges...i didnt put any pmdgoptions.dll or reg file, and im using win7 64bit so it should work with u too.

what i recomend you to do, is that instead of u tryng to find a cracked pmdgoptions.dll and reg's...u should uninstall ur pmsg 744.400/800i (that will automaticly uninstall the update too) then follow my instruction from the begining to the end (again sorry for the long essay) and after u done everything, test it, then if the 747-8p is fully working, install the MD 11 too...dont forget to put fake email etc, then it should definatly work! i havent put the update of the MD 11 yet but im assuming that it will work :)

let me know how it goes, and if this still doesnt help, let me know so that i will find other solutions.

wickette your method works however i dont think it will still work if u update the MD 11 (if they hav an update which i think they do)...did u update the PMDG 747 to v2.10 ?"
,Artus_407,2010-02-13T13:45Z,"Hey guys, i need your help.
I followed the instructions in this read me and everything works fine until i select PMDG 747 in aircraft menu in FSX. Then the message :
""PMDG_747400_Main.dll cannot find PMDGOptions.DLL""

I copied the dll to the pmdg/dll folder but it didn't work.

Any suggestions ? Thanks !"
,sciencepilot,2010-02-16T14:57Z,"Sorry for delay replys...i m not going to be around here often for now because im going for holidays =D (no net there)

anice1983 sorry i dont understand why is that happening, maybe its because that the PMDG is saved in the registry (the mistakes u must made previously) so now it jus doesnt let u do nothing much but to keep things simple (without updates) well if you really want to update ur PMDG's then you can either get this Advanced Uninstaller PRO around here in TPB (however u must becareful wen uninstalling the PMDG as it might delete ur FSX is u dont fail to read the setup on that program) or format your pC, i know that last option is abit too extreme...but i done that before because i had PMDG issues aswell (but that wasnt the main reason to format a whol pC for!) and now its fully working!

this is all i can recomend to you if you are really looking foward for these updates etc...


Artus_407 i never heard of that issue, what could possibly be is that wen you load for the first time the PMDG 747X, it comes up to ""run"" or ""not run"" u must press Run then YES, if u fail to press RUN then YES then it might not load the DLLS and (or) gauges...this is all i can think of, if that is not the issue...then i can make some search about it 4 u. 

Peace"
,kbeattie,2010-02-17T01:03Z,How do i install this if i can't get the installer file for the 747-400/8i? Quite stupid.
,Artus_407,2010-02-17T15:28Z,"hey sciencepilot.

No problem. i too have some normal work to do and I'm not here all the time.
So thanks for your response.
And of course i said ""yes""..... tried it 20times and every time the same error...... this sucks..."
,Artus_407,2010-02-17T17:17Z,"ahh, now it'S working. what i did is remove everything concerning PMDG out of the registry...
"
,sciencepilot,2010-02-22T17:05Z,"Artus_407: well i never had that exact problem before, but i had some other issues that made me get some programs to take all the PMDG stuff including its registry and since then it worked fine, sorry for not providing with that solution before, i wasnt familiar with your situtation. but now it works so thats what matter :) 

anice1983 yeah thanks for the update :) jus installed the update now and its fully working as usual!

kbeattie again my apologies for the incorrect title of this torrent, i was going to upload the PMDG 747s aswell but people might already hav it so it would be pointless uploading everything if people only wanted the instructions, if u are lookn for the expansion (747-8i) go here:

,scienceman,2010-02-27T20:07Z,"IMPORTANT: this is sciencepilot, im not on my default PC and i forgot the pass to my original account, so its still me -) but in a diferent account.

i didnt read everything properlly because i cant stay here for longer...so this is a quick one for peple who are having problems!

whatever the problem is..(actually it depends on it) if its some unknown error or something else...and it worked before, this is what u should do: unninstal the PMDG's (yes including the 747 original which will delete the 2.1 update) with a third party software that not only it will uninstall the aircraft, it will also uninstall the registry! use a program like advanced uninstaller pro! (i will give u a link below this comment) however, u gotta be careful wen uninstalling with that prgram because if u dont pay atention, it might uninstal ur fsx! or u can choose to uninstal with another program...

why doing this? simply because that if u had previous problems with the PMDG 747 (or maybe other pmdg's) it will save on the registry! and if u previously used a pmdgoptions.dll cracked, and now ur not using it, it will NOT work as all the previous records of what you did saved on the registry!

delete everything from PMDG...registry etc...restart PC...and follow carefully my instructions...i even print screen something so it shouldnt be hard AT ALL! dont try to be smarter by doing something diferent! jus follow my path for sucess. and after it should be working 150%! because ur PC is not diferent from my PC! (ffs its windows!) s if my one and others work, your one will too!!!!

thanks for reading, and let me know how it went after. if i take ages to reply, it means im not here.

""0x800C0005 error with cannot locate the resource specified setup will now terminate"" stupid thing
in fact I think it is hosts file problem or right problems, im sure it is something really silly, lol, "
,scienceman,2010-02-28T04:42Z,"(still sciencepilot) well... im going to do some google search now, unfortunatly i cannot help much because im not on my computer were the FSX is. if i was i could try to have the same problem and explore it to see if i can find any solution.

this ""error 0x800c005"" is not unknown to me to be honest, i had problems with this before.  however, all i did was what my tutorial pdf says to do. 

ilove747-8 in what part did this error came? wen you were clickin NEXT...? or VALIDATE ? (or some other moment)...i need to know accuratly your the situation.

but in the mean wile take a look at this:
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/843499"
,tanketa,2010-02-28T06:15Z,"@sciencepilot

The 0x800c005 error comes after clicking in validate. Thats if you leave in host file ip www.precisionmanual.com. If you leave ip address precisionmanula.com it comes ""unable to validate... contact pmdg support"".
I tried to register those files. I only could reg softpub.dll. Imposible with the others.
Oh fyi, i uninstall every pmdg product i had, and reinstalled just B744x following your tutorial.
No luck!!
Thanks in advance sciencepilot!!"
,ilove747-8,2010-02-28T10:21Z,"@sciencepilot
yeah as tanketa said, we get this error when clickin on validate with ip www.precisionmanuals.com in hosts file as in your tutorial. trust me we do exactly as u said in tutorial, and i know for sure because i got it installed about 5days ago, i clicked validate and got a message with certificates then i clicked yes and so on the install of the 747-8i/f then removed the ip www.precisionmanuals.com line from hosts file, then i ran 747 config manager, chose 8i, then ran fsx then selected 8i, then flew this 747-8i nice and flawlessly!!perfect!!but on the 25th i desinstalled fsx cuz i used fex weather and then desinstalled it but i forgot to restore original fsx textures before desintalling it, so i had to desinstall fsx to get the original fsx texture back...so before i desinstalled fsx i desinstalled in order 747-8i expansion, 747-400x, fsx acceleration and then fsx.i then deleted fsx folder, rebooted, then reinstalled in order, fsx (then activated it), fsx acceleration (then activated it), ran once fsx to check everything ok...everything ok, so installed pmdg 747-400x with enable button, then installed 2.10 update, then checked aircraft.cfg to see beginsah1 code, it was there, then installed the latest airac cycle 1002, then ran pmdg load manager, selected a load and fuel, ran fsx, pressed yes for all prompts for dlls, chose 747-400x, again yes for all prompts, got somewhere and cockpit fully functionnal, flight controls evrything, no blanking after 5min, then got back to my pmdg loader manager then clicked send to fsx, then closed manager, went back to fsx, my load n fuel perfectly sent , so off i went for a test flight, flight perfect as before i desinstalled it. so closed fsx, then ...went to hosts file added line ip www.precisionmanuals.com saved it then ran 747-8i/f setup, clicked validate, then this error!!...
sorry for the long story but i gives u a good picture of what happened for me, and it is really frustrating cuz hadnt i have this texture problem i wdnt have to desinstall it.

so maybe u can come up with another crack? cuz hosts file seems no go for us anymore, we even tried with the enable button...isnt it another way to do it rather than with the hosts file? or maybe change the line in the hosts file? like puting another ip or something? or another host?

anyway we appreciate your input into this, thanks a lot science!:);)"
,MTFDarkEagle,2010-02-28T11:12Z,"I've had the EXACT same problem as ilove747-8. However, I haven't had to uninstall my FSX installation....."
,MTFDarkEagle,2010-02-28T11:56Z,"Also, the link you gave us coming from microsoft, that doesn't help. On the ops wiki site from PMDG, there are some more dll's you could re-register, but that doesn't work as well.."
,sunckc,2010-02-28T14:29Z,yes i have the exact problem of what @tanketa described! pls help! really frustrating when i tried dozen of times until i bumped into this forum. and now i know the truth..unsolved yet.
,scienceman,2010-02-28T15:42Z,"oh...

i see this is becoming quite serious....

but did you actually put ""11x.10x.1xx.2x www.precisionmanuals.com"" ( the ""x"" is to NOT show the actually IP)

on a line below like the tut says? do you have anything else on the hosts that you might of added before??

anyways, good news/bad news.. bad news is that i havent found the issue.
good news is that im goin bk home to my own PC so from there i will definatly find the issue. so be patient everyone =) 

i m going today...so later on (fews hours later) i will be bk to my own PC solving the problem then posting it here. so no more worries. from this day. 
 ( might come with a new crack. )
Peace"
,MTFDarkEagle,2010-02-28T15:47Z,"Thanks for trying to help us :)

And yea, I put the exact ip and adres in the hosts file, and no, I didn't put anything in that file before this, I didn't even knew it existed :P:P"
,sunckc,2010-02-28T16:09Z,yes i did exactly what your ip mentioned. maybe the link to that ip is down or something? hope you find the solution real soon.
,ilove747-8,2010-02-28T17:20Z,"yep! same as everybody, i did also put the right figures for the ip etc etc, but no luck:(
but i think since i installed it before without any problem about 5days ago and then try to reinstall it on the 25th it might be that this crack doesnt work no more as everyones problem started since that very same date on the 25th, looking at the history...
wot do you guys think?"
,sunckc,2010-02-28T17:42Z,"i do believe this ip does not work anymore. perhaps the precisionmanuals support somehow got to know they have been cracked! we need plan B, gosh i can't wait to try out this extension..ain't gonna spend another 25bucks for it. as i purchased the original before. that hurts.."
,MTFDarkEagle,2010-02-28T18:12Z,@anice: I'm gonna try that now!
,ilove747-8,2010-02-28T18:19Z,"thanx anice1983 for this alternative, but id rather wait for science pilot to get back to us first, since we already have installed n patched the 400, n we just missing the crack (new?) for the 8i/f, but hey its still good to have 4 last resort if really no hope!;) that would mean have to desinstall again lol"
,sunckc,2010-02-28T18:24Z,i tried it but the box just close by itself after validation failed. tough luck for me here. what about you guys? i am using the download version.
,ilove747-8,2010-02-28T18:28Z,"same for me sunckc, box closes :("
,MTFDarkEagle,2010-02-28T18:36Z,OMG that worked! Anice's way works!!!
,sunckc,2010-02-28T18:38Z,wow! congrats to u both!! guess i just have to wait till sciencepilot come out with a solution. sigh
,ilove747-8,2010-02-28T18:40Z,"tell us MTFDarkEagle!
wat u did? av u already downloaded 2.28g?? u hav very fast conection lol.

so please can you explain in details ur steps?
so that we can follow the same, if science doesnt come up with other way?
thanx"
,MTFDarkEagle,2010-02-28T19:11Z,"I already had the boxed edition on my hard drive, but there were too many files so I gave it up :P:P.

Here's what I did:

-Install deamon tools lite
-Enable RMPS mode
-Uninstall previous install of the 747 (advanced uninstaller pro is what I used for that).
-Open the .MDS image found somewhere on the boxed download
-run setup.exe
-use this serial: PMX-194-25020-23655-74867
-install
-run update found in the boxed download
-check sha1 code
-next (i did this but I'm not sure if it's necessary): do the ip-pmdgsite hosts file thingy
-run enable button
-run 8i setup
-(again I'm not sure if this is necessary) type in the data (in the readme file from THIS torrent yeah this one, from sciencepilot) DONT HIT VALIDATE
-click next
-install

that's it"
,ilove747-8,2010-02-28T20:11Z,"yea i figured, lol, mine only finished downloading few minutes ago :);), and yeah you right too many files thats why I wanted to wait for science to come up with a solution..

kk got that, ill do the same if no hear from science! and at last back to the 8!! thanks;) :p"
,MTFDarkEagle,2010-02-28T20:13Z,"cmon man try what I did, it could still be some time untill science can figure out something"
,sciencepilot,2010-02-28T20:14Z,"im back....


MTFDarkEagle  congrats :) im thinking in installing the boxed verson because i think it has more features then the download verson (because theres like 900MB of a diference!)

if it has more features i recomend people to install the boxed verson (unless they cant be asked to download or jus rather stay with the downlaod verson)

i just got home now. so im going to find out whats wrong...

so give me a few hours and i soon will reply with the updates!

Peace!"
,sciencepilot,2010-02-28T20:17Z,"exatly MTFDarkEagle....

ilove747-8 go for MTFarkEagle option! 

it wont stop me from still tryng to find out whats wrong because i know that in the future people (with the download verson) will possibly have the same error. so i have to find out now for everyone as i promised i would help."
,ilove747-8,2010-02-28T20:34Z,"ok science. no problem, thanx to letting me know..

and multiplayer, yes, when u in?"
,coldathrun,2010-03-07T07:02Z,i the front flaps is the slats i couldn't remeber so i say the front flaps okay about that if you take a look at any airline photo with the flaps down you will see the slats thing inside and in my PMDG i only get the inside of the slats not the out side slats if you have a MSN i can show you
,ilove747-8,2010-03-07T09:50Z,"yeah the slats are the leading edge flaps!, and that was I thought u meant but I wanted to make sure.. so you dont have the actual flaps showing? it just shows the mechanism? wots ur msn?"

,MTFDarkEagle,2010-03-12T18:02Z,"jwka211: Have you done EXACTLY what the manual says, and have you read through the comments on this very torrent? If you follow the EXACT instructions, all should be well.. Do you have any other PMDG airplanes installed? You dont have to do ANYTHING with pmdgoptions.dll.

,MTFDarkEagle,2010-03-13T09:50Z,"Do this: EXACTLY

,MTFDarkEagle,2010-03-13T17:29Z,"Yes, you can install liveries. Make sure you install SP1 as well. You only have to watch out installing liveries on the PMDG MD-11X"

,MTFDarkEagle,2010-03-18T17:30Z,I'm not sure whether you need a SHA1 code in the fsx.cfg file. You do need it in the pmdg 747 aircraft.cfg though. Is it present there? (do you know where it is?)
,jwka211,2010-03-18T19:25Z,"yes i know where everything is ive been trying for months, i know were the sha1 code is and its there"

,MTFDarkEagle,2010-03-18T21:18Z,and applied the patch for it?
,jwka211,2010-03-19T17:22Z,"yes ive installed the box version and yes, the patch i have no idea what the problem is i keep reinstalling it and it just doesnt want to work, does your panels freeze or not?"

,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-18T10:31Z,the rear view of the cokpit in 747 8i is not caused by improper installation. you need to go to 747 8i configuration manager and switch to 747 8i to get the actual view.

,fsxm25,2011-05-10T22:21Z,"yesterday i noticed there is no solution..

no problems at all during installation :D"
,mickyfinny,2011-08-27T13:55Z,"i highly RECOMEND you to uninstall your PMDG 747-400X and follow these instructions.
(I WAS CONNECTED TO INTERNET FOR THIS PART)
I am running Win 7 64bit so run all .exe,s as administrator(even the enable button) 
Use the BOXED version (PMDG 747.mdf)Enable RMPS in deamon tools,mount image run seup.exe use 

serial: PMX-194-25020-23655-74867 Install Update :PMDG747_400_FSX_2.10_Update_Setup.exe .
now that we have successfully installed PMDG 747 lets go to your favorite step :) (I still have image mounted) 
2--> this part is for win vista/7! and for Xp too! however in advance of this part for XP users when you go 
to the ""etc"" folder, before you click on the Hosts make sure you right click Properties, and remove the 
""read only"" 
now, make sure your flight simulator is NOT running! before you click on the PMDG 747 expansion pack 
setup, we must trick the program first ;) by going to C: (if your OS is on the C: drive!) then 
Windows\System32\drivers\etc\...and open your ""hosts"" and open with notepad. In the last line put: 
113.105.152.25 www.precisionmanuals.com "
,mickyfinny,2011-08-27T13:59Z,"Stupid Comments Section the rest of it
I WAS CONNECTED TO INTERNET FOR THIS PART)
 HERE is where i now ran the enable tool then run PMDG747-400X -8i Expansion Pack.exe input email: 

ppd_87@hotmail.co.uk SERIAL: PMX-194-25020-23655-74867 PASSWORD in CAPITOLS(i used 6 numbers) 

THEN pressed NEXT but  DONT CLICK ON ""I accept""YET! go to your ""etc"" folder again were the 
hosts file is, open again with notepad and delete the "" 113.105.152.25 www.precisionmanuals.com "" 
that you put before, then save it. THEN after doing that you can go back to your PMDG747-8 setup were 
you should have left with the option of accept the conditions or not, just click accept, then next then 
install it.I have to stress that it must be Boxed version,for this to work cos i got sick of errors with download 

version and couldnt get the 8i to install at all,but with the boxed version no problems at all.Btw Thanks to 

Sciencepilot for most of info :+)"
,winkerbie1234,2012-04-11T22:25Z,"I can confirm what mcphinny wrote above works.

I have win 7 x64, and i did this with the MD11 and 737NGX previously installed. "
,AviatorMan81,2012-04-24T01:21Z,"I recently had to reformat / reinstall everything on my computer and have now hung up on this one. I had this working in the past with both the MD-11 and 744/8i installed with the base packages both being the ones cracked by komu before he decided to lock himself away. Now I've been trying to get the 8i installed again and have run into the same ""unable to find specified resource"" error that has been plaguing people. Unfortunately, I can't find the boxed version you all keep talking about, so I'm hoping there is an alternative solution. I have tried installing the 8i over the komu install and also over the other installs available on TBP currently and none work. Thanks for any help. "
,AviatorMan81,2012-04-24T12:45Z,"After poking through a bunch of the posts on TPB relating to the 8i upgrade, I think that the culprit of my situation might be the redirect IP itself. On a hunch, I attempted to go directly to the address in my browser, but the connection timed out, which is also probably what the installer is seeing when its trying to move forward when any combination of validate or next (different instructions say to do it differently, but all result in the same resource error). I guess the question now is whether or not there is another IP address that will work, or another installation option that isn't as easy?"
,AviatorMan81,2012-04-27T11:53Z,Found the boxed version finally and can confirm as well that what mickyfinny wrote works perfectly.
