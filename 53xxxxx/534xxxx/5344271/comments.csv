Why dont you try Switching to the Initial Seeding option on your Utorrent? That way, your Utorrent Client will only upload Rarest piece in the swarm.

Steps:
1) Open uTorrent.
2) Double-click on the torrent that you want to super seed.
3) Check on the box labeled ""Initial Seeding"" and then click on the ""OK"" button to turn on super seeding for the torrent file.

Simple Rite?
