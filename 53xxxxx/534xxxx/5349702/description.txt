That delightful bumbling Ernest P. Worrell is now on Saturday Mornings! His very own show where he's always up to something that lands poor Vern in trouble. I like the one where Ernest buys a watch that does everything. I mean everything. But tell time. Another good one is where he celebrated all the major holidays in ONE day! Ernest's friends are here to. Gailard Sartain is Chuck, Lonnie Don and Matt Finish. Ernests alter egos are all around too. There's Dr. Otto, the naive semi-mad scientist, Sergeant Glory, Woody the dummy, Auntie Nelda, and Baby Ernest. I don't remember the show all that well, but it was reminiscent to the commercials of Ernest's in the early '80s, like when he'd fall off the ladder, have the window slam on his hands, or even get shocked when trying to fix the TV. I remember when Ernest wanted to become a prized fighter, so he became Ernest the Furnace. Yeah, Jim Varney was a funny guy and he's sadly no longer with us, but I think we are all very fortunate for having known him when he was here and to enjoy all his hilarious work, like his Ernest character. - imdb
