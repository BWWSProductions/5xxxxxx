,insanecrazy07,2010-03-14T23:55Z,"This is the same exact one from demonoid. Someone TVripped this one. You can see the Cartoon Network Logo that's been cut off at the top.

I wonder why it's been cut off, unless someone was sitting there trying to use a cam on their TV...lol...fail.

I also wonder why this is the ONLY copy around."
