WORK DONE:
Firstly we took the vobs that were given to us by a friend a.k.a. Mr. Anonymous ;)
and ran them through AutoGK, then edited the avi(due to the screener being so dark)
with VDub and ran some filters to clean the video up, adjust gamma and contrast,
and sharpened the picture.

Kept source audio.

We're always looking for syncers, cammers, silver suppliers, dvdrips,dvdscrs/scrs
