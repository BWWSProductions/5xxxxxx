International Athletics Sports presents 14 events (100m, long jump, weight, high jump, 400m, 110m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, 1500m, hammer, shot in motion, speed shooting and archery), to which we will access three different game modes with three difficulty levels. On one hand we can access the experiments individually, once they are unlocked based on gold medals. On the other hand we can make a Decathlon competition with purely athletic tests. Finally, we participate in tournaments in different parts of the world with a series of tests and a scoring system similar to the decathlon
