,nafe1,2010-02-06T19:23Z,This fucking better be RF and not PAL again.
,AgentClaret,2010-02-06T19:29Z,"I'm tellin' ya, I have my doubts...

what does this mean: DNL ONLY PAL Languages : ENG GER iTA "
[T],thenoobish,2010-02-06T19:41Z,"That the DNL release had Eng Ger Ita as languages.

This release from PARADISO has Eng Spa Fra"

I don't like that ""DNL ONLY PAL Languages : ENG GER iTA  "" in the release notes"
,AgentClaret,2010-02-06T20:54Z,"Could it be patched?

Can you even DO that on 360?I didn't think you could but I've been hearing talk lately..."

,brian0423,2010-02-06T21:10Z,i had a legit copy of bioshock 2 special edition in my hands yesterday ...the 100 dollar special edition thats the size of the bible. should have ran with it and uploaded it lol
,colt45joe,2010-02-06T23:14Z,the pal version can be played on a ntsc xbox 360 if it has the jtag hack.
,AgentClaret,2010-02-06T23:50Z,"Yeah, but that's probably over most peoples heads.

I myself am but an apprentice in the ways of the pirate..."
,ERdark,2010-02-06T23:57Z,"There are no seeds on this torrent, after downloading over 30% of this torrent, im just going ahead and downloadng the Bioshock 2 Region Free torrent.from X360SOS"

,nafe1,2010-02-07T13:08Z,"i extrat this fine, but when i go to burn it it says ""cannot find the specified file"" don't even fucking tell me this is corrupt.  This is fucking bullshit."
,nafe1,2010-02-07T14:09Z,"Found the issue:  IN the .DVD file, the .iso extension was not after the bioshock 2 iso name in the .dvd file which sets the limit break, therfore it could not find the file."
,AgentClaret,2010-02-07T14:29Z,So what? this is another useless torrent then?
,AgentClaret,2010-02-07T16:15Z,"I managed to burn it using the .sio file isntead of the .dvd (thought ImgBurn yells at you for this)

It doesn't load.

This sucks."

,AgentClaret,2010-02-07T17:49Z,"Sorry, Noobish, I hadn't seen your post yet. Nice fix!

Thanks a TON, dude, I was really psyched about this game.

It works %100 fine!"
,anarkie13,2010-02-07T18:56Z,"Worked by removing the .iso extension. I guess editing the .dvd shopuld work too. I always show extensions, so it was the easiest fix for me."
,Razzmatazz50,2010-02-07T20:59Z,Can either of you PLEASE tell the steps you used to get it working?? I don't want to waste a disk..
,ShinoBoy,2010-02-07T21:06Z,"Really easy to fix the .dvd file.  
1) Open it in Notepad (you'll see it's only 2 lines)
2) Change the line that says ""paradiso-bio.shk2"" to say ""paradiso-bio.shk2.iso"" (just add the .iso on the end)
3) That's it.  Now it burns fine.

I can confirm that this works on an NTSC console, so it's probably region free"
,Razzmatazz50,2010-02-07T21:14Z,Thanks a mill buddy!
,runtimmy,2010-02-07T21:37Z,It works  open the dvd file with notepad & add iso & save thanks

,hotwheelz2007,2010-02-07T23:41Z,Downloaded....will be seeding at 1mb/s hopefully Region Free....will comment later
,Cold71,2010-02-08T02:02Z,"confirmed, this worked on my NTSC x360. Follow Shioboy's instructions to get this to work or just remove the .iso from the end of the iso file, this also works because the .dvd file points to a .shk2 file and not a .iso like it should. Kudos to thenoobish!"
,Pwny,2010-02-08T03:02Z,"You guys are all idiots.

If you cant figure out how to ""Use this file"" on your xbox, or even how to extract it, just kill yourself right now and save us the pain from laughing so hard at you. You are all noobs."

,Pwny,2010-02-08T16:18Z,"@Razzmatazz50

You are doing the same exact thing by retaliating against me, you too are no better than the newbs who dont know how to use these files.

Protip: Learn to google.

Answers are quickly found there, and it leaves time for important comments instead of shit like:

""Duhhhr how does me open fiilez on teh xborx350??""

You are dismissed."
,AgentClaret,2010-02-08T16:20Z,"Pwny, shut the fuck up. Did you come out of your bitch mothers crotch just knowing all this stuff? I'm guessing someone had to hold your faggoty little hand every step of the way. 

Lay off the folks who aren't as knowledgable as you. Be nice like The Noobish and actually help someone out."
,vidmanflys2,2010-02-08T21:14Z,"Nice upload thenoobish. As for the rest of the commenters, can't we all just get along!?

,toolforyou,2010-02-10T01:06Z,"just ran this threw abgx360 and everything is a GO , but you must run the .ISO threw abgx360 first before you burn or its not stealth YOU MUST AUTO FIX FIRST WITH ABGX360 , peace to all"

,DeafeningSilence,2010-02-10T03:45Z,"I tried burning this using ImgBurn, but i got an error saying my system cant find the location, so then i put .iso after the name of the dvd file in notepad, but it then failed 50% into the burn, any ideas what to do now?"

,Mokoko34,2010-02-10T20:27Z,"First of all thanks to thenoobish for the upload. Just finished Bioshock and this lets me continue while everything is still fresh in my head. 

Come on people, 156 seeders and 1371 leechers and all I can get is about 16-30 KB/sec max while my up speed is almost 200 for the same file?

Before someone says it's my connection I downloaded a few HD movies at around 400 each. If you leech then please seed, this is how it works and everyone is happy. "
,DeafeningSilence,2010-02-10T20:39Z,"Well, it worked, somewhat. It burned but when it gets to the sequence with the little sister, it freezes, so im guessing i might need a new type of disc. But thanks anyway for the help toolforyou"
,toolforyou,2010-02-10T20:48Z,ITS A WAVE 4 GAME SO I recommend HAVING IXTREME LT FOR LITE-ON DRIVES AND 1.61 FOR ALL OTHER DRIVES AND USING VERBATIM DISCS AND BURN THEM AT 2.4X AND HAVE IMG BURN 2.5.0.0 AND TRY 1 MORE TIME GOOD LUCK

So this morning I notice internet not working, I call my ISP they tell me I have to talk to security department. Security department told me a company by the name of ZDEBP.

Anyways I managed to unblock my account by mention I happen to have a un protected router in a apt building. What's a computer mister flow chart idiot basically.

,co30op,2010-02-13T00:00Z,"for all of you who can't figure out how to write the dvd file use either imgburn or dvd decrypter to burn the iso file.  Go to tools-settings-iso write and manually set the layer break to 1913760, and have it set up as DVD, SAO, Auto and it will burn fine.  If you leave those settings in place it will do it every time and you won't need anything but the ISO from now on."

2. You will see two lines, just add the extention .iso to the second line (without space)
3. Open using image burn

,LimpFire,2010-10-23T04:09Z,"Make_A_Wish

You need to Update your xBox Drive to the latest Firmware!"
,gotmachine,2011-11-01T11:12Z,"omg man, why are so many people so confused about burning this game???

if you can flash an xbox, use abgx and burn a game, how can you not know how to rename files???

the ISO file has "" .iso "" in the filename of the ISO. IE, when read with the filename it becomes a double ""iso""

for example, the filename is ""Bioshock.iso"" and it is an iso file, in the current case it becomes 
""Bioshock.iso.iso""

In order for the burn to work, the .dvd file needs to have the same filename as the iso file. IE, IT NEEDS TO HAVE .ISO at the end of the filename. 

Therefore, the filename need to be ""Bioshock.iso"" and with the added .dvd extension becomes 

""Bioshock.iso.dvd""

I know it has been explained how to make the .dvd file work, but I'm just explaining the biomechanics behind it. It really is not difficult. Much easier than flashing an xbox. How stupid can some people be?

Go play the game and enjoy it. Stop asking questions. "
,fallengun04,2012-01-19T12:35Z,"Game is working properly. My console is NTSC. For those who encounter errors while burning, try editing the .dvd file. the paradiso-bio.shk2 should be changed to paradiso-bio.shk2.iso. Enjoy and thanks for the great upload thenoobish! Till next time. :))))"
