PAUL COLMAN RELEASES SECOND SOLO ALBUM â€œHISTORYâ€ JAN. 27
Project to Include the Best of Paul Colman 

(NASHVILLE, Tenn.) Dec. 2, 2008 â€“Former frontman of Grammy nominated, Dove Award-winning group Paul Colman Trio and current guitarist for legendary band newsboys, singer/songwriter Paul Colman will offer his second solo project, History, on Jan. 27, 2009. The album showcases the best of Colmanâ€™s career, including two previously unreleased tracks and new recordings of popular songs by best-selling artists including Toby Keith & Delirious.
Among the History collection are Paul Colman Trio radio hits â€œTurn,â€ â€œRunâ€ and â€œFill My Cupâ€ in addition to remakes of the Delirious hit â€œHistory Maker,â€ Toby Keithâ€™s â€œIf I Was Jesus,â€ and â€œSweet Sweet Song of Salvationâ€ by Larry Norman. Also on the album are cuts from Colmanâ€™s 2005 solo debut, Let It Go, as well as the never before released â€œAll U Needâ€ and â€œThe Killing Tree (Live).â€

â€œI have been blessed throughout my career with many unique experiences and opportunities to perform both as a solo artist and as part of a band,â€ says Colman. â€œThis project is a great representation of my best work, past and present, and Iâ€™m grateful for the gift of music that God gave me.â€

In addition to the forthcoming record, Inpop Records will introduce two digital EPs containing both brand new songs and cover tunes by Colman. The first of these companion pieces, â€œIf I Was Jesus,â€ will drop simultaneously with History on Jan. 27, 2009. â€œAll My Life,â€ the second digital EP, will follow later next year.
