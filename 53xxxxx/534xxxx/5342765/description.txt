    Twenty years on from the invention of the World Wide       
    Web, Dr Aleks Krotoski looks at how it is reshaping       
    almost every aspect of our lives. Joined by some of the  
    web's biggest names - including the founders of           
    Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, and the    
    web's inventor - she explores how far the web has lived   
    up to its early promise.                                 
                                                              
    Here, Aleks charts how the Web is forging a new brand      
    of politics, both in democracies and authoritarian        
    regimes.                                                 
                                                              
    With contributions from Al Gore, Martha Lane Fox,          
    Stephen Fry and Bill Gates, Aleks explores how            
    interactive, unmediated sites like Twitter and  
    have encouraged direct action and politicised young       
    people in unprecedented numbers.                           
                                                              
    Yet, at the same time, the Web's openness enables        
    hardline states to spy and censor, and extremists to      
    threaten with networks of hate and crippling cyber         
    attacks.
