,Xiloscent,2010-02-10T03:46Z,what do you think death?
,Zielpunk,2010-02-10T06:36Z,"There is a crack inside, but it isn't working, even with missing file also signed by Razor1911
It looks like we must wait for better fix, maybe Reloaded? It was too beautiful to be real, its day after pc release..."
,Zielpunk,2010-02-10T07:01Z,Update: Its working with that one (all included) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5350708/Bioshock_2___CRACK___Jonpat13__
,wowme,2010-02-12T15:49Z,"I'd like to confirm that the game works with the crack posted by Zielpunk. 

Also, this is the the fastest torrent of the three more popular i tried. 

i already have a 1.3 ratio, but will keep seeding more.

,DQZ56,2010-02-15T17:07Z,"I'm a bit confused, how do I get the windows live working? I have an account, and the client is installed, but it won't let me save without the key."
,candylord,2010-02-16T14:54Z,"@DQZ56

You need to make a offline account if you haven't already.

Start the game, if GFWL asks you to sign in or make an account, chose to make a offline account.
If no GFWL window pops up, press ""home"" on your keyboard and make one.

You should not make a real (online) account as you'll need to buy the game in order to work."
,chommy1873,2010-02-16T18:30Z,"Hey everyone i was wondering if anyone could be bothered to help me, ofcourse im having some problems.

Ive downloaded this file and the link provided in the comments, i extract BS2 [Bullterrier] and there is no ISO image to mount, so thats confusing for me.

I mount the folder itself and that seems to work but no install option on the menu, again confusing.

so i just got into the extracted contents and run setup, the game installs and i replace the MP/SP folders and run the game from the SP folder (Bioshock2launcher) "
,chommy1873,2010-02-16T18:31Z,I get Binkw32.dll error.
,...Criminal_Intent...,2010-02-17T07:08Z,"I got everything to work fine but after I sign into windows live games it asks me for the product key. My question is how do you sign up for an offline account, or do I just need to unplug the internet from my computer, Really confused here can someone please help."
,alliance2,2010-02-18T04:21Z,"First i would like to say this is the fastest torrent yet, up to 240kbps, and 240kbps is the best download rate i can get with my crappy modem/router.

Secondly i would ALSO like to confirm that the crack posted by by Zielpunk works perfectly."
,chommy1873,2010-02-19T03:10Z,"Deleted it, couldnt get it to work, thx 4 help douches."
,...Criminal_Intent...,2010-02-19T06:10Z,"This game is bullshit....you can install it and the crack works but once you sign in with you gamer tag it asks for the product key, and apparently the product key is limited to two PC's. Don't waste your time and save yourself the frustration and find a copy that allows you to by-pass the product key.if that is even possible.bullshit!.I'm deleting mine now and going to find something else.Fuck this really pisses me off."
,dank_nug,2010-02-22T01:07Z,"when you install it and replace the mp and sp files in the razor foldaer under program files, and run the game, it pops up with a windows live bar. go to create account, scroll down and select create local account. type in a name, and click create...then you can save.. the problem im having is after that, when i click new game it crashes at the load screen after sitting there for like 5 minutes. i messed up and tried to sign in with a live acct online, so im trying to reinstall and just create the local acct and see if it works. "
,SaintBipolar,2010-02-28T05:13Z,"The game works on my low-end system. For those who have the game up and running, does your intro movie play like a slide show or hitch up? The game works great on my single core 2Ghz P4 W/1.37gb of ram, ATI Radeon HD3650 512 AGP 8X. I do need to turn off some feautures so it does no slow down when multiple slicers are on the screen. Anyway if anyone could suggest what I could do about the intro movie and probably all cutscenes running like a slide show, do help us poor folk."
,biogenesiss,2010-03-11T05:51Z,"These bioshock 2 rips for PC are BS!! I downloaded this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5347317/BioShock_2_%5BPC___ENG_ITA_DEU%5D%5BRazor1991%5D In game play when you try to save; sometimes the save option is there but most of the time it isn't so when you been playing for an hour and decide you want to save, you press esc to save and find that the save option ISN'T THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! why the FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?! I'm guessin this rip has the same issue, because it's A RIP!!!!!!! I don't know why you people upload this shit when all it does is frustrate people to no end.."
