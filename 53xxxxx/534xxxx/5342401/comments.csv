,jakastou,2010-02-08T20:22Z,"about the DLC ...
are the Elite Units of the East included here ?"
[T],Tanauser,2010-02-09T08:35Z,"I could make them only if I had Patch4

....and RazorDox is not Updating"
[T],Tanauser,2010-02-11T10:57Z,"OK
I got patch4 to make the new EUE; but does it worth it ?????"
,Ivica121,2010-02-11T21:22Z,"How did you get patch4?
Would EUE working with razor update 1.5?"
[T],Tanauser,2010-02-11T21:53Z,"Do you want patch4 ?

 EUE working in any case if you make them..."
,jakastou,2010-02-12T02:35Z,"Tanauser :
All I got is the razor Update 1.5 ...
I don´t know if I got Patch3 or Patch4 or if I need any new RazorDox Update to get them 
( I´m a Noob at this ) 
but I would like to have all the Units they released and if it´s not too much to ask you I would apreciate if you included them in your excelent Pirate Mod
Thank very much for all your work.   :)"
[T],Tanauser,2010-02-12T08:25Z,"The last patches since the last RazorDox update 1.5v  are patch3 &  patch4 ;

 razordox 1.5 doesn't include those 2 patches


Patch3 is included in this PirateMod

not included in this mod is 
Patch4 that contains the Elite units of the East (ottoman etc DLC's) 
 They need to be rebuilt ; by someone"
,Ivica121,2010-02-12T10:26Z,I found razordox9 on partis
,Ivica121,2010-02-12T10:59Z,"I tested razordox 9 and working. Its blue menu, and music is from vanilla version. And working with 29 dlc free."
,jakastou,2010-02-12T11:41Z,"thank you for explanation.
I guess that all I have is what you put in the PirateMod then ... 
I´ll keep tracking you , in case you decide to make the EUE or anything else new.
I love your work.  :)"
[T],Tanauser,2010-02-12T13:31Z,"Could you give the link of RazorDox9 ?

else I can Upload the Patch4 + the loc.pack for the description.

I don't feel like making them"
,Ivica121,2010-02-12T13:38Z,"Go to Partis, and you must register"
[T],Tanauser,2010-02-12T14:52Z,"Ok never mind I found it on anther site.
