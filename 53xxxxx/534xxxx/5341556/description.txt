THE FINAL BATTLES. DVD video. Contains three of Great Battles of World War II in Western Europe in the latter part of the war: THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE; THE BATTLE FOR THE SIEGFRIED LINE, and THE BATTLE OF REMAGEN. Between November 1944 and May 1945, there were three key series of battles on the western front that sealed the fate of Adolph Hitler and Nazi Germany. This DVD program follows the Allied armies as they begin the invasion of Nazi Germany. 

Witness the critical battles that led to the breaching of the Siegfried Line; the Nazi's Ardennes Counteroffensive and the Battle of the Bulge which finally broke it off; and the final breaching of the Rhine River at Remagen and the infamous Remagen Bridge. These three battles, among the bloodiest of WWII, truly were the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany. Over 2 hours of original WWII documentary footage.
