Plot:
When every college turns him down, Bartleby 'B' Gaines decides to make one up. Welcome to the South Harmon Institute of Technology, where the students teach the classes, the dean lives in a trailer in the back, and Bartleby's on the way to scoring with the girl of his dreams. It's a raunchy, rowdy, flat-out funny college comedy that critics are calling "freakin' hilarious"
