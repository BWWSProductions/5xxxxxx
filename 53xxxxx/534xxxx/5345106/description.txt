Director: She is a very sad young girl and this sadness lies in the fact that, as you say, she is forced to become an adult. Maybe when you see her in this film, you think she is very strong and she is very close to being an adult. She's becoming an adult, so she certainly has a kind of strength that's unusual in people who are so young. But I think that she is actually a very weak young girl who is hiding all her weak points. She tries not to show them to others.

Also, she doesn't speak so much because words always come from feelings. If she speaks only one phrase, her feelings come out and she wouldn't be able to stop that feeling which she has kept hidden deep inside her. If she would speak and express her feelings, the result would only be more sadness and despair. She wants to keep everything inside, so there's a gap between how she looks on the outside, her coolness in dealing with things like an adult, and what she actually thinks and feels inside her, which is a great confusion. This gap grows wider and wider, and when it becomes too wide what results is a kind of explosion.
