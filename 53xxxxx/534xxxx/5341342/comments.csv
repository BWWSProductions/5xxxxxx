,Bersercker,2010-02-28T17:39Z,"Worked fine on 1.5 for me, thanks SgtFurby!
It is pain in the @#$ to play dow2 online with cracked version though, so many haxx and  overrides... ^^"
,SgtFurby,2010-02-28T23:01Z,"yeah, but i been playing Last Stand so its not too bad. add me on LIVE. gamertag - Heretic Furby"
,Bersercker,2010-03-01T08:56Z,"Ah, u wanted to play with me? ) I am not using gfwl, because of cracked version. There is a program like hamachi and garena: tunngle. Which is better then both of them imo. Not very much people in tunngle dow2 room though :(
And looks like most of them are using 1.9 version from your torrenrt. :) Thanks again! )"
,Bersercker,2010-03-01T08:58Z,"Hm, it gave me a database error, when i posted a link to tunngle, must be some anti-spam system... ^^ Well it is tunngle*net, where * is dot :)"
