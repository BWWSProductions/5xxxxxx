Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War II Patch 1.8
If you want to know what this patch includes and updates, look it up yourself.

I patched my game when it was updates to 1.6 if I remember correctly.
So, say you have patch 1.6 on your game. Good.

Once thats complete, Copy all the files inside the folder "DoW2 1.8" and place them into your installation directory. In my case
"E:/Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War II/DoW2/" 

Hopefully it'll all be good to go.
Find other patches using the search bar on TPB. Just search "Dawn of War patch" or "Dawn of War update" etc. etc.

Have fun and play your game!
Btw, to get free Games for Windows LIVE Product Keys, go to your local Gamestop Retailer, and open every Games for Windows LIVE box, one is bound to have a product key. Whether or not it is for the game you want to activate, it might work. I used ONE product key on NINE Games for Windows LIVE games. It works. The product key doesn't always work for different games, but I used a "Fallout 3" product key on different games, and on Windows Vista and my Windows 7 Ultimate upgrade. I also used a product key for "The Club" about 12 times on different Windows Installations and on different games. "Stormrise" unfortunately did not work with any games and Stormrise is shit so I don't have it.

Anyways, have fun and happy gaming!

This is my link for Patch 1.9. Install AFTER installing 1.8. It is the files for patching from 1.8 to 1.9 ONLY. Don't have 1.5 or 1.6 installed and try to patch to 1.9.
