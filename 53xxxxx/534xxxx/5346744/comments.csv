,Jedwilliams,2010-02-10T07:03Z,"Thanks, I think I will buy this album. i love it. I dont know if this happened for everyone but when I imported it to itunes the names of the songs didnt upload. Not a big deal, I just looked it up. Just letting you know :) "

,freshtorrents,2010-04-17T05:40Z,"Upon putting the songs in my itunes library it doesn't have the titles, just ""track1""... etc.  ID3 tags could be messed up."
