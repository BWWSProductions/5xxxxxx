This 1997 release brings to fruition what was supposed to be the full-length debut of Care in the early 80's. Ian Broudie and Paul Simpson created some incredibly catchy and cheerful pop numbers, especially the timeless singles "Flaming Sword" and "My Boyish Days." Other wonderful numbers include "Whatever Possessed You," "Cymophane" and the title track. Many of their tracks blended keyboard hooks with energetically-strummed acoustic guitars. Others are synthesizer-based throw-aways that closely resemble their better-known songs.

This cd includes nearly everything the duo did. One flaw is that the cd omits parts 3 and 4 of a b-side mini-suite from one of their singles in favor of a second version of "Flaming Sword" that is too similar to the other to warrant inclusion. Still, a welcome appearance for those who mourned the early demise of this partnership, although the later emergence of The Lightning Seeds and continuation of The Wild Swans would partially carry on this project.
