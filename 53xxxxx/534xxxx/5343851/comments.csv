oh and what sorts of improvements are there.

thanks again, sweet upload."
,lampa023,2010-02-07T22:00Z,is This demo...or........ ?
,Ergopad,2010-02-07T22:01Z,Huge amount of high quality textures and other graphics tweaks as well as better sounds from AvP1. 
,Ergopad,2010-02-07T22:02Z,"No, this is not a demo or a full game. This is modification for AvP2 pc game. Latest patch is recommended."
,Poopsy_McGee,2010-02-07T23:14Z,"i guess my question is, how do i make it work, also can i get like 16x10 resolution from it.

ive been wanting to play this again with upscaled resolutions for years. any help?"
,Ergopad,2010-02-07T23:34Z,"Yes, you can play it as high resolution as you wish. I'm currently playing it 1920x1080 and it looks nice. :)

Just edit autoexec.cfg file like said here: 
http://www.widescreengamingforum.com/wiki/Aliens_Versus_Predator_2

And if you don't want to set the FOV (field of view) for each time you play, like the instructions above says, you can download the fix from here:

,nyder,2010-02-08T09:13Z,"The guy gave instructions on how to do it in his comments.

Copy the MOD_COMPLIATION.REZ to your avp2 folder, start the game.

First screen gives you a bunch of choices, you pick OPTIONS.

There will be a space to put command line commands, put: -REZ MOD_COMPLIATION.REZ is that part.

There is a file that gets made after you do that and played the game, in the same directory, called:
avp2cmds.txt

If you did it right, you'll find the -REZ MOD_COMPILIATION.REZ at the end of that file.

,Poopsy_McGee,2010-02-08T21:31Z,"thats where im having the problem, i dont see where there is an option for command lines. keep in mind guys im not a software tech, im still learning.

thanks again tho. it helps somewhat, now i just need to figure out where this command line feature is."
,Poopsy_McGee,2010-02-09T03:10Z,"ok i got it, did that but nothing is different, atill only get 1280x950 or whatever, and nothing looksa any better...am i doing something wrong?"
[T],swebarb,2010-03-03T19:46Z,"lol worthless shit, its so old game it makes no sense doing this.."
,cpt.pacman,2011-05-11T18:45Z,"awesome work. I watched the whole 4 Alien Movies yesterday and i though i have to play the avp2 again. first, i can't believe, but it works :D

A++"
,stimer89,2011-06-04T00:39Z,seed plees :/
,ChronicDCJ,2011-10-16T08:12Z,"swebarb is a str8 up cocksucker. Classic/epic game - with the right mods this might be better then the new AvP Game (2010). I can't speak from experience, I'm actually (lolz) dling that torrent now.  Just goes to show you how ignorant people are... well this is extremely common in these torrent comments apparently."
,ChronicDCJ,2011-10-17T05:15Z,"Okay so I have the mod FINALLY (not many seeders/leechers, and on that note, I SWEAR.. I will seed this for a long time, long as im torrenting ofc, lolz) and I realized it doesn't have the graphics mod I'm used to - I can automatically tell because predator life is green.  My question(s) is why didn't the uploader specify what mods he meshed together and can anyone tell me how I can go about contacting this person, be it on piratebay or elsewhere??"
,ChronicDCJ,2011-10-19T12:28Z,"Well... whatever flipping mods that are combined... appears that it works on multiplayer, at least I have it in directory with command line (installed) and can play on others servers. "
,Ergopad,2011-10-19T23:02Z,"@ChronicDCJ: I'm afraid I cannot tell exact mods that I used, but here's at least some of them. I also did minor fixes somewhere and added stuff from other games, if memory serves.

* HQP - High Resolution Textures 
* AvP2 2007 Complete texture overhaul 
* High Quality Pack
* Hi-res Marine weapons Pack
* Classic AvP Sound Pack (?)
* and maybe some other mod."
,ChronicDCJ,2011-10-26T01:50Z,"So you incorporated both of that dudes HQPs, one is mostly for multi (map textures n such) and the other dudes overhaul?! HAHA!! No conflicts? I haven't really been playing it lately so I can't give (bugs) feedback atm. Obviously rines r ur fave lolz. Nice compilation bro, if you didn't get the newest HQP2 you should redo the colab and let me kno on here. GJ!!"
