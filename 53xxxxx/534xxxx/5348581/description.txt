Description

The peaceful world of the LocoRoco are under attack by the not-so-nice Moja Corps! These evil outer space creatures have come to take the LocoRoco from their land of blowing flowers, lively creatures and pastel scenery. As the planet where the LocoRoco inhabit, you must move them through more than 40 levels of slippery slopes, teetering platforms and maze-like passages. The LocoRoco have the uncanny ability to fluidly "morph" to their landscape, so all you need is to tilt, roll and bounce the happy "blob-like" creatures to safety!

    * Roll, Bounce and Tilt the LocoRoco through a vibrantly animated world.
    * Fluidly Morph to the Environment: Stay round to roll, become slim to squeeze through narrow passages, and disassemble into smaller LocoRoco to collectively pass through small crevasses and paths. Eat to increase the size and quantity of LocoRoco and to gain access to secret areas and hidden rewards.
    * Simple Intuitive Gameplay: Just press the L and R buttons to tilt the landscape or bump the LocoRoco onto higher platforms and up hillsides.
    * Over 40 Stages of lush living landscapes: Roll across grassy plains and slippery slopes. Bounce and balance on teetering platforms. Get swept through the sky and soar through twisty loops.
    * Six Different Types of LocoRoco, each with unique voices and actions.
    * Captivating, light-hearted original songs communicate the joyous world of the LocoRoco.
    * Extras features include the customizable LocoHouse, three mini-games, and exciting wireless features.
