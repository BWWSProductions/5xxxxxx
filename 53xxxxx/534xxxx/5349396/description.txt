The first David Byrne collection for Luaka Bop

You couldn't ask for a better sampler of post-bossa nova pop than this. Well, you could, but it'd be darned hard to find. Byrne did a fabulous job cherry-picking the best of '70s and early '80s MPB, throwing in several super-catchy tunes such as Jorge Ben's "Umbabarauma" and Caetano Veloso's "Ile Ale," songs which really stick in your head and win you over. Also included: "Sonho Meu," perhaps the sweetest song recorded by either Gal Costa or Maria Bethania; several songs by Chico Buarque, including a wonderful duet with Milton Nascimento ("Calice"), and a couple of interesting tracks by the lesser-known female singer, Nazare Pereira. Admittedly, the second half of this record slides into cheesier terrain, but the slippage is relatively minor. This remains one of the best -- if not the best -- introduction to Brazilian pop available.
