     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Host Chris Barrie kicks off proceedings with the 1910s - the
      decade that industrialised the First World War. Chris looks at
      pre-war inventions, from a three-wheeled Morgan runabout to
      massive moving bridges, before charting the new weapons, trucks,
      planes and ships of World War I. Find out how technology changed
      warfare forever, before seeing Chris climb into the cockpit for
      an exhilarating flight on the first aircraft to fly across the
      Atlantic.
