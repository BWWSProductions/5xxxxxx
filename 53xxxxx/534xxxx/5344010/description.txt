Anders Manga is an artist, songwriter, and producer hailing from Charlotte, NC, who has released 6 albums since 2005.

His music has been described as a blend of rock, electronic, goth, Dream Pop, EBM and 80â€™s influences into a modern, melodic electro-rock sound.

Regardless of the genre you wish to classify his music, the listeners continue to grow worldwide on a daily basis. In 2007 Anders was nominated for â€œBand of the Yearâ€ by Gothic Beauty Magazine readers alongside Lacuna Coil, Skinny Puppy, and an artist he lists as one of his earliest influences, Gary Numan.

Over the last few years, his fan base has crossed over into the horror film genre, where he has contributed music to over 12 films. The Horror network, FearNet.com referred to Andersâ€™ work as â€œwickedly inventiveâ€ while Pseudopod.org, the worldâ€™s premier horror fiction podcast has used Andersâ€™ "Bloodletting On the Kissâ€ as their show opening for the past 4 years.

In 2008, Andersâ€™ single, â€œThere Will Be Bloodâ€ climbed to the top 20 of the German Alternative Music (or DAC) Charts, which prompted him to pursue more opportunities outside the USA. In 2009, he signed with Danse Macabre Records/Alive in Europe.

His first official worldwide release â€œInfinite Gaze to the Sunâ€ entered the charts in Europe at Number 10 the week of February 4th 2010.
