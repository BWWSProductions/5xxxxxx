I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

@smbdownload - in response :

320kbps CBR is indicated to Studio Albums which doesn't include ""live[1 album] & Compilation"". And its clearly mentioned  at the torrent info. Thanks for leaving your comment. Appreciated."
[T],reactor90,2010-02-09T20:25Z,How many Live albums is this douchebag going to make! No talent hack.
[V],smbdownload,2010-02-09T20:52Z,"mrvain - no worries brother - just passing along what I found to others - not very clear from torrent header - you are correct that the torrent description does say [full studio albums 320 - but doesn't say anything about the rest ] but the title of the torrent says 320 and alot of folks download without actually opening up the torrent [just from the main TPB page] 

BTW - I hate when people pick apart my torrents - so I just want to say THANK YOU for giving back - Sabbath rocks - I appreciate your effort ! "
[V],smbdownload,2010-02-09T20:56Z,lighten up reactor90 - clearly you are not a fan - so why in the world would you even click on the torrent - from your Mickey Hart upload I would presume you are a Dead fan - now there's a band that has ALOT of live material - peace !

No talent hack?   He's done a hell of a lot more than you'll ever do in your life time.  He makes millions of people happy with his music... you can only make one person happy, and thats only if your hand is working properly.   

Thank you SMBDownload!"
