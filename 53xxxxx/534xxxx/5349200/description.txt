ABOUT THE SHOW:

The December 12th show is a perfect blend of Big Whiskey tracks performed for the first time acoustically; tried-and-true songs from Dave and Timâ€™s repertoire with a few surprises added to the mix. The show began with the jaunty Eh Hee followed by the crowd rousing Dancing Nancies. Perfect for the season, Christmas Song and Lying in the Hands of God are equally stirring. Grey Street and Timâ€™s rendition of Led Zeppelinâ€™s Kashmir are also songs to take note of on the Live from Las Vegas setlist. The show closing Typical Situation followed by Two Step are also exceptional tracks on the release.
