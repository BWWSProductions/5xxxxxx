,theDB,2010-04-25T09:01Z,iTunes couldn't install this OS because it said it is not compatible with the firmware...is that because I'm running 5.12?
,insanetester,2010-05-12T03:01Z,You have to check out Iphone os 4.0 it clearly is the best yet.  I got it from iphone os test dot com.  This is not spam I have nothing to do with them except that I used their service to get 4.0.. besides the features that it has I have not dropped a single call since upgrading
