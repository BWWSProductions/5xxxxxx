When you talk about blues drumming you have to talk about Sam Lay. He's the man who 

put the beat behind the blues. He is truely a living legend, having worked virtually 

with every major Chicago blues singer. He made his name with Howlin'Wolf, for six 

years he played both live and on countless hit records. From there he hooked up with

The Paul Butterfield Bluesband. The first inter-racial bluesband and the first to

bring the music to a rock audiance. He has played drums with Lightning Hopkins, 

Little Walter, John Lee Hooker, Willie Dixon, Hound Dog Taylor, Magic Sam, Otis Rush

Bo Diddley, Jimmy Reed, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Charlie Musselwhite, Muddy Waters to

name a few...
