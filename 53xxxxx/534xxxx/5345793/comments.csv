It is difficult to search for a crack or keygen when there is so much ""virus-fed"" fake downloads"
[T],gamerguuy,2010-02-14T17:02Z,explore the cd and the you'ill find folder with crack/serial keygen in it

,Kingnickmon,2010-02-24T01:27Z,Yea where on the cd is the cd key generator/crak? Saw your comment above looked everywhere cant find it!
,mikey1999,2010-02-25T20:08Z,does the keygen work can i activate the game online like i bought the game?
,Serpant28,2010-03-02T03:17Z,Does anyone have a version of the update other than SKIDROW? It doesn't work for me.
,ThtOneSix,2010-03-11T01:17Z,Does this torrent allow for online play after using the keygen?
,cyllan,2010-04-10T06:18Z,"no email /product serial number anywhere, where is it?"
,XDarkz,2010-08-26T15:47Z,"The activation code isn't required. What you need to do is:

1) Extract/Unrar the files
2) Mount/Burn them.
3) CLICK on the mounted file (The ONE file that was just created) and ""explore"" it.
4) Look for the folder ""SKIDROW""
5) Drag and drop everything in the ""SKIDROW"" folder onto the already installed files (Should be located in your Program Files)"
,XDarkz,2010-08-26T15:54Z,"And yes, online play is totally working ;].
THANK YOU SO MUCH ""gamerguuy"".

Read the first post my ""NanoEntity"" for details.
When it asks for a product key, you can use -any set of numbers- as long as it's 35 digits long.

Goodluck ;]"
,XDarkz,2010-08-26T21:38Z,"UPDATE: Apparently single-player works fine but with their release of version 1.91, you can create an account but not get online :[

Please get back to us with an update ASAP. Please and Thank you."
