,OogaChaka,2010-02-08T22:12Z,"Help prevent superstitious people from driving airliners filled with human beings into tall buildings filled with human beings.

Just say NO to religion.

End superstition. 
Embrace rationalism. 
Develop and exercise critical thinking skills.
Throw your ""sacred"" texts on a bonfire... save just enough copies for the museums. "

I have to agree with you on the lack of critical thinking skills the world would be a better place with more critical thinking "
