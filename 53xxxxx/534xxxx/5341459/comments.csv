,KickassWashingMachine,2010-06-10T17:12Z,"The 720p ""ALLiANCE"" rip is definitely the best of the rips out there that I've tried.

I also tried this 720p ""Alex"" version, the 720p ""ViSiON"" version and the 1080p ""LTT"" version, and the ""ALLiANCE"" one has the least amount of artifacts of them all. All of them, however suffer from a bad luma range (blacks not properly black) (except it's not so bad in the ""Alex"" version, but that's not very good looking anyway).

It's clear from testing these releases, that it's a very difficult source to encode (I'm betting the original looks pretty bad, too), but my money is on the ALLiANCE one, for sure. Don't bother with the 1080p LTT version, and don't settle for the other 720p versions.
