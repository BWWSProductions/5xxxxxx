1610. The King James Authorised Version of the bible is
near complete. Shakespeare warns The King [James] that
inclusion of the Dream of St John will lead to blood. 

The King and Shakespeare travel to Oxford to discuss the
matter with the Authorised Version's editorial team.

The play has a secondary theme, the nascence of The Tempest,
Shakespeare's farewell to the stage, and his fears for what
the Puritans are about to do to the theatre.

It might sound dull, but this is an engrossing play, and
worth listening to just for the depictions of Shakespseare
and James, and of their relationship.

Also, considering subsequent events, I suppose it's worth
saying that it would have been far better to have left the
Apocalypse out alongside the rest of the apocrypha.
