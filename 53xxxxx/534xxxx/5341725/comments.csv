I have alot of files I would like to share so...I'll seed this one initially until 25-50 people have downloaded - that's it [usually 24 hours], then it's up to you to continue to seed...so, please continue to seed this as long as you can (try to be at least a day or two or longer if possible) to keep these going so as many people as possible can enjoy this great music for a long time to come - thanks and enjoy !

During the set, he said he was off to the show you have here.  The studio chap asked if PF was to play and WH replied that he ""had a suspicion"" he'd be there.

The set list shows he did indeed turn up.  Thanks smb,"
