,Squeezitgirdle,2010-02-14T11:27Z,"im assuming the email is the ""name"" but i keep typing in the name and its saying invalid :(
copy and paste is failing me :((("
,elvispco,2010-02-18T01:07Z,"Worked gr8 in Win7 x86, all I do is block ""Alcohol.exe"" with windows firewall and no more email is invalid messages"
,mo_pho,2010-02-18T05:00Z,"Thanks, works great!

@Squeezitgirdle 
I tried to copy and paste the email and serial like five times to no avail before I realized you just have to click the ""register"" button on the keymaker and it does everything automatically."
,Tuttankhamun,2010-02-19T16:22Z,"It works fine, guys !
Awesome. 
Thank you, aoloffline !"
,Thalon,2010-02-21T00:11Z,"It works great, just install and use betamaster's keymaker to register.
Also remember to adjust your firewall's settings to block alcohol.
If you're using vista's firewall just follow this simple guide:

,MntDew,2010-02-24T05:58Z,"Installed Alcohol 120%, blocked it in Windows Firewall, and then ran the keymaker. Works perfectly!

Running Windows 7 x64 Enterprise"
,jowshmow,2010-03-14T21:50Z,"Better Explanation Of What To Expect:

1.  this torrent contains two rar files ""Alcohol120_retail_2.0.0.1331_07.02.2010_BM"" and ""al120_v2kg"".  they both need to be extracted using an extractor program like ""the extractor"" or ""winzip"" or something. 
2. after extracting you get two files: ""Alcohol120_retail_2.0.0.1331"" and ""keymaker"".  open the Alcohol exe file and install the Alcohol 120 program. 
3. block the Alcohol program from Windows firewall. 
4. open the Alcohol program.  it has a button to ""Register"".   do not click this button. stop here.
5. open the keymaker program and hear a song play called ""Wild Thing"" by Ton Loc.
6. push register on the Keymaker program.  
7. continue to the Alcohol program. 

Thats what worked for me.  Thanks for the program it works so far.

,patrioticparadox,2010-05-10T03:30Z,Having issues with the kaymaker running (Win7 x64) but I see that MntDew got it to work so ill try again
,foxelein,2010-06-06T21:26Z,many thx... :)
,nittany,2010-06-18T06:25Z,"I can't get this to work, I followed jowshmow directions.  I installed it, then it wanted a reboot to finish installation, so I rebooted my computer, then I blocked the Alcohol.exe using Windows firewall and by following this guide:

http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/615711-guide-vista-firewall-outbound-blocking-easy/

I then launched Alcohol by clicking on the desktop shortcut.  I did not click on the register button that came up, I then used the keygen/patcher and it said registration was ok.  It then goes to the program but says email does not match key.  I exit and try to relaunch, but then it says I must enter a valid serial to activate this version.

Meh, I've never had a problem installing cracked software until now."

,Mainers,2010-11-20T07:07Z,"@ron916 Make sure you no what your talking about b4 you screem virus, no mzatter what keygen you scan with virus toal there are always some false positives.

Thanks aoloffline for a virus free file !"
,crybaby95,2011-03-09T00:08Z,"great torrent! 110% clean! just blocked in firewall.
thx for this awesome torrent!"
,Rhubarb777,2011-09-27T23:49Z,"Apparently, I use vuze, and when it finished downloading it says it's an invalid torrent?"
,slm90,2011-10-23T22:42Z,Internal Setup Error. Again. I've tried 3 of these torrents and all of them have been saying the same thing. I read the solution with the windows firewall but I don't even have Windows Firewall running. I have McAfee Personal Firewall. Is that the problem? Is the Windows Firewall the key to getting this to run?
