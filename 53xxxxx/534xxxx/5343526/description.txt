BBC Natural World 2010 Prairie Dogs HDTV x264 AC3 MVgroup

Prairie Dogs - Talk Of The Town.
Wildlife documentary. Offbeat film narrated by Rob Brydon, which takes us to the Wild West where prairie dogs live in huge colonies known as 'towns'. Like meerkats, they are comical to watch, but there is a whole lot more to prairie dogs than just being cute - they can talk. For 30 years Professor Con Slobodchikoff has been recording their calls in response to predators and he believes he has discovered a language second only to humans in its complexity. It's a bold claim but is he right?
