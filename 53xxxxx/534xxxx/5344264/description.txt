So, my first torrent here - the very rare nowadays European PS2 release of the great Capcom classic Final Fight - it's called Streetwise.

PAL, English language, DVD5
SLES-53853

It runs on my HDD with HDL .08C with no modes, also no problems with ESR - patched & burned @4x on Verbatim DVD+R media.

Hope you like it, today the seed will be poor but tomorrow I'll add some more IPs to seed so maybe you can download it ;)

Greets and thanks to all those PS2 gurus on the net - the spain scene, psx-scene, psxhaven, etc.
