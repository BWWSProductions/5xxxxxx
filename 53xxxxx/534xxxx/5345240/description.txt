Riddles Are Abound Tonight is an album by Sausage, a band composed of the original lineup of the California Bay Area band Primus consisting of Les Claypool, Todd Huth and Jay Lane. The album was released in April 1994, four years after Primus debuted with Frizzle Fry. The band followed the album with a short tour, opening for Helmet and Rollins Band. With Claypool's signature intricate bass lines and droning nasal lyrics, this album sounds much like early 1990s Primus.
