,Mustafa1990,2010-05-09T04:12Z,@Izarof you think you are going to tell me what torrents means ?? you say leeching makes the download go faster ?? HAHAHA fucking idiot how dare you come tell me i don't know shit about torrents while it is obvious you don't know shit...Leeching DOES NOT MAKE THE DOWNLOAD GO QUICKER IT MAKES IT GO SLOWER ONLY and i say ONLY when the leecher uploads the torrents back then and ONLY THEN does this make the download go faster for other people...pls don't talk to me out of ignorance i know more about torrents then you know about jacking off u fucking russian pigg
,kai2008,2010-05-10T17:50Z,Mustafa1990 actually izaroff is correct you can download from leechers as well as seeders so it can speed things up leechers are people who are downloading the file seeders are people who have full file its people who download and dont seed back which should be punished as leechers havn't got full file yet so they cant seed but as you know you can upload while downloading at same time so sorry but your wrong
,kai2008,2010-05-12T15:37Z,"just to clarify what wikipedia.org says on this subject please read beyond 1st sentence

Among users of the BitTorrent file distribution protocol, a leech is a user who disconnects as soon as he/she has a complete copy of a particular file. However, most sites prefer the term leecher for all users who are not seeders (don't have the complete file yet). However, because BitTorrent clients usually begin to upload files almost as soon as they have started to download them, such users are usually not freeloaders. Therefore this kind of leeching is considered to be a legitimate practice. Reaching an upload/download ratio of 1:1 (meaning that the user has uploaded as much as he/she has downloaded) in a BitTorrent client is considered a minimum in the etiquette of that network. A leech becomes a seeder (a provider of the file) when he or she finished downloading and continues to run the client. They will remain a seeder until the file is removed or destroyed (settings enable the torrent to stop seeding at a certain share ratio, or after X hours have passed seeding).

,platypode,2010-07-01T23:47Z,"I don't understand BitTorrent sometimes; over 1000 seeders, yet I can't connect to more than two of them at a time or get a download speed of more than 10 kb/s (and that rarely). I'm at 6.0% after nearly a day, at this rate it will take upwards of two weeks to finish, and that's for someone only downloading four of the six movies. WTF?

(This isn't a ""seed more"" request, though that would be nice too. Does anyone get why this kind of shit happens?)"
[T],Booster2,2010-07-02T13:15Z,"On AC3 Filter you can enhance the audio volume by doing this: Go to: Start - Programs - AC3Filter - AC3Filter Config - (Press ""Cancel"" when the message pops up or else you will see it all the time when entering it) On ""Main"" go to ""Gain"" and set the Master & Gain to 10+ (do not set to the highest or else the level on the sound/volume will be to noisy).

After that go to ""System"" (see above) - ""Use AC3Filter For:"" deselect all except AC3 (The rest is optional). The reason by deselecting is that some of them might ""interrupt"" the volume on other programs like Winamp for example."

i played these movies in DivX but it was all static sound, picture quality was sexy...so then i tried to play it in VLC, picture quality was the same, but this time i got small amount of background music but no vocals....

Anyone got any ideas how i can fix this...i really dont want to download this all over again...thanks"

Audio Device: Stereo, instead of 5.1 and it works flawlessly....

so...if i want to convert this to play on my ps3...what do i do to fix this ? lol"
,ShadowBos,2010-07-21T17:57Z,"ok so im a douchebag my apologies lol i just needed to update the audio encoder ac3 or w.e its called...

so now i can proudly say this is a badass download that i recommend.

a-9
v-9

i would give it a 10, but when i make it full screen it kind of lags a little. But on normal sized player its flawless. GREAT WORK!

so for anyone who was struggling like me....just update your AC3 filter audio encoder thinggy and your good. the link's on the first page in one of the comments Booster made"

,xProbertx,2010-08-04T14:45Z,and when i say distance im not saying far away but when the characters arent close up.

,janat08,2010-08-08T01:23Z,"Don't even bother with episodes 4-6. They're all from 70s/80s while 1-3 from 90s/00s. 4-6 weren't cut by director; have awful acting; banal comments and dialogue. Id recommend 1st episode due to awesome acting by padme(?) and most relevant scenes to genre. 2nd episode is more of a romance, and 3rd is drama. Also 2nd and 3rd weren't funded as well- I believe- as the 1st one."
,krisapin,2010-08-13T10:41Z,"Janat08, are you on crack? the original trilogy is far better than the prequel trilogy. Episode 1 ruins the mysticism behind the force with one word. MIDICHLORIANS. old Obi-Wan explains it just fine in EP. IV

""Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.... A Jedi can feel the force flowing through him.""

and one character ruins the first two movies beautifully. JAR JAR BINKS. I can understand having the comic relief but to make him a representative of the planet and then the whole clone was thing starts because of his caving and not being Padme's voice in the senate shows just how lame the character is. ask any Star Wars fan, any REAL Star Wars fan & they'll tell you the original trilogy blows away the prequels and a lot of them will tell you that ESB was the best of all.

,TyMod,2011-05-01T21:21Z,They have the same file sizes though some of them are longer because the aspect ratios are different.

Thanks for the upload but it could of been better.
