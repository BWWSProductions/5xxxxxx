@chandruis : just curious why do u need subs?

I guess i like readings the subs sometimes when there's bad audio :p "
,Catman1967,2010-02-09T13:23Z,Thanks for the up!
,TPB_ROX,2010-02-09T15:32Z,"Thanks FXG !!!

@Ijaved when someone asks for subtitles it doesn't necessarily mean the audio is bad, some people are unfortunately just hard of hearing."

,OGma59,2010-02-19T08:39Z,"watch out, ppl, ((darkmovies)) is a scammer, don't do it.  he posts that bs on every top rated torrent.  if you dl from a person with a skull, it is safe.  fxg team always has excellent quality rips.
this movie was an extremely intense thriller.  not that much gore for a horror flick and not a predictable ending, either.  a/v 10/10 movie 8.5 (personal opinion and i'm very critical, so 8.5 is really hi for my ratings)"
,Abadey20,2010-02-19T09:47Z,THANKS !! : )
,wackaday,2010-02-21T00:24Z,"@OGma59, ""not that much gore for a horror flick""???? what the fuck are you talking about!?? I'm a huge horror fan, and i've seen just about everything out there that's worth watching, and this is definitely one of the goriest films i've ever seen, and it would easily be in the top ten goriest films of all time. in fact, why don't you name a few you think are gorier than this, because i'd like to see them!"
