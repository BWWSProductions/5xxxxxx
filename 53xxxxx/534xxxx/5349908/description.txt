     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Adrian and Christine were joined by David Dimbleby. Dan Snow
      looked at the making of a modern Royal and what the future might
      hold for Prince William. Dom Littlewood told us about the
      government's new boiler scrappage scheme. Could you be eligible
      for money off a new boiler? Architect Sean Griffiths was in
      Essex to discover more about the bungalow. And Alex Riley asked
      what makes a piece of artwork valuable.
