The best comedic duo ever to hit the big screen. They paired up in some of the greatest comedies of the '70s, '80s, and early '90s.  I have put together their collection of movies that both Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor starred in together.  They only did four movies as a comedy duo, the late great Richard Pryor who died in 2005 will be remembered well for his comedy roles and stand up comedy.  Both Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor together were such a great duo and they put together these four movies which are now classics.  I always enjoyed watching these movies as a kid and there's some great scenes to remember and watch time and time again.  The four movies they did were between a 15 year period starting just after the mid seventies until the early nineties.  I hope that both of these actors will be remembered for many years to come.

All movies are in DVD quality and are region free.  Also each DVD is in PAL format but with English speaking language only but there is a selection of multi subtitle languages to choose from.  As this collection is dedicated to both these actors I have chosen to keep only their English audio tracks instead of overdubbed foreign languages.
