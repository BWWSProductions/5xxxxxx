[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-14T00:02Z,"No probs!  Thanks for taking the time to download these 4 movies.  They're all great and fun movies to watch!  I've seen them all that many times I've lost count, watching Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor together in a movie is just priceless now.  It's a shame they never did any others, there's some good ones that Gene did on his own and Richard did also, I guess really download those also.  What I like about these films is you never get bored with this stuff, you can just watch it again and again and again and again! lol"
,djd099,2010-02-16T03:52Z,It's both PAL and region free? Does that mean it can be played on an NTSC dvd player?
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-16T20:53Z,"@djd099: I'm not sure really, yes these movies are now region free dvds and they're PAL format for Europe but I guess it depends on your DVD player to whether it can support that particular format.  Just try it if you're not sure, they'll either work or they won't, I would try it but I have a PAL DVD player region free as I live in Europe.."
