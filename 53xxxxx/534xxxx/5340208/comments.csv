,Maester07,2010-02-17T00:06Z,I'm confused; if this is Bluray surely it should be 1080p/i rather than 720?
,Screamokid,2010-02-17T17:05Z,"Maester07: HD (according to some) starts at 576p (although is standard defenition in UK) and goes all the way up to 1080p (in some, but not many cases, more), Blu-ray comes in 1080p but can be downscaled to 1080i or even 720p for TVs which can't support 1080p so this torrent is infact bluray and in HD ;)"
