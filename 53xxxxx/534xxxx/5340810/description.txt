This is the ONLY song Stana Katic (who play Det. Kate Beckett on ABC's Castle Mon. @ 10pm ET) has ever recorded! I looked & looked for this!!! Only a very few copies were made and sold online. Stana's song is "Simone's Song". She show on this soundtrack, She is not only one of the Greatest Actresses of All Time! But, she has a voice that makes Angels jealous!

The last time I tried to upload this something messed up and I could not seed. I am Truly Sorry for that!
