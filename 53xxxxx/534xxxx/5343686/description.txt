Hereâ€™s a second CAM for Edge Of Darkness. Comparing to Rxâ€™s version, this one has much better video quality. Downside is the fact that the audio kinda sucks.. But iâ€™m sure some other p2p group will mix both, and weâ€™ll update this post with some new release info;) . Check out the sample.



A cop and widower witnesses what first appears to be the accidental killing of his daughter, Emma. Distraught by the loss and further troubled by his conviction that the bullet was intended for him, he takes on the murder investigation with an obsessive zeal to see justice done.
