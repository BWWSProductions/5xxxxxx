*Note*

 This is the English/Russian version of the app. If, after completing the above instructions, you don't have the necessary English files, refer to the "3rd (Optional) - Program Files" folder included within this package. Inside, you'll find a "wpIntellicast.dll" file along with a "Languages" folder. Within the "Languages" folder, you will find a "langEnglish.txt" file. Both, the "Languages" folder and the "wpIntellicast.dll" file should already be installed on your device.

However, in case they're not, read below.

Using Active Sync, browse to the installation directory on your device. It should be similar to "StorageProgram FilesTouch Weather". If you do not see the "wpIntellicast.dll" file, copy/paste it here now. If you see it already, disregard.

In that same directory, you'll find the "Languages" folder. Go inside of it and check to see if the "langEnglish.txt" file is there. If not, copy/paste it there now. If you do see it, disregard.

App should be fully registered already.

Enjoy!
