Russian cult sci-fi comedy "Kin-Dza-Dza" (1986) with Slovak [SK] subtitles for both part 1 and 2 of the movie. File format is ISO to be burned on a DVD and played using a common DVD player.

Kin-Dza-Dza is something like an "advanced cyberpunk film". It's a lot about people and social structures which on "Plyuk" of course have many parallels to our society. It's a very funny movie, but it's also a melancholic movie with great philosophical sense.
