,ZenRhino,2010-02-06T21:52Z,can you get us a copy of Boondock Saints 2? nobody else seems to be able to get this one available
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-06T22:03Z,"@ar1990: No, you haven't, so do not worry. Your mentioning of trilogy just have illustrated the fact that many people cannot see that a movie of 1h30 IS one half of the movie of 3h and relate file-size and duration. Files can be smaller, but quality would be so low that I'll never do that.
My goal is not ""making a file small as possible"" but to combine newest encoding techniques to make ""as small as possible""
BTW, ""Two towers"" is 3h43 and ""Return of the king"" is  4h10. This is up to two or even three movies in duration - and size.
LOTR trilogy is not just planned, but done before last Christmas, some people here knows that... It is delayed by the same reason said over there: ""Fellowship"" is the smallest and file-size is - 650MB. ""Two towers"" and ""Return"" are much longer - and therefore bigger. 

@htctouch: I downloaded one when you asked for the first time. So, I have it and it is in encoding right now. Just be patient."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-06T23:17Z,@ZenRhino: Not out yet.
