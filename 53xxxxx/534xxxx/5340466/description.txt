Dan and Nick: The Wildebeest Years was a BBC Radio 4 comedy series originally broadcast in seven episodes in 1998. 
The Dan and Nick of the title are Dan Freedman and Nick Romero.

A follow-up series of a further six episodes was made, this time called Forty Nights in the Wildebeest

The characteristic feature of Dan and Nick's style is the heavy use of puns. Indeed, the frequency of puns incorporated into these programmes has rarely been matched since I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again.

The shows premise centered around short sketches and songs performed in a cabaret style. Dan and Nick had a supporting band, 'The Gents'. 


Typical sketches included lampooning films, music, and other popular culture. 
 
Some recurring jokes were:
Incy Wincy Quincy, a spider pathologist, obviously lifted from TV-show Quincy, M.E.,
Tossed in Space, a satire of Lost in Space about trapped salad items in space,
Censorship gags, for example, reading football scores while bleeping out any innocuous sounding words, including from the middle of words, and
The Annals of History and The Century's Passage, a humorous and satirical look back through historic events.
Robin Would, a gay and camp version of Robin Hood with guest Richard Coles playing the lead, whose catchphrase was "what would you have me do, live a lie".
Big Fact Hunting, (needs to be spoken very precisely to get past the censors), another excuse to introduce as many one liners as possible on a particular theme



Basically this series is a joke every few seconds
