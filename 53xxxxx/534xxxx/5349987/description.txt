Schisms in Christianity â€“ Schisms in the 4th and 5th Centuries:


The history of Christianity is full of schisms, conflicts and controversies. These conflicts started early immediately after the Apostolic Age. It deepened in the following years and finally resulted in the breakup of Christendom into a multitude of sects and denominations.

The first major schism in Christianity happened in 325 in the First Council of Nicaea. This schism resulted in the breakup of Arianism from the official Christianity endorsed by the Roman Emperor Constantine.

The First Council of Ephesus in 431 resulted in another schism and the breakup of the Assyrian Church of the East.

Then came the First Council of Chalcedon in 451 which resulted in a major schism and the breakup of Oriental Orthodoxy from Roman Catholicism.

These schisms were followed by more schisms in the following centuries that resulted in further breakups in Christendom.
