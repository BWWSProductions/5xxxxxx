    Visible from space, Africa's Great Rift Valley runs        
    three thousand miles from the Red Sea to the mouth of     
    the Zambezi. It's a diverse terrain of erupting          
    volcanoes, forest-clad mountains, spectacular valleys,    
    rolling grasslands, huge lakes and mighty rivers, and      
    is home to crocodiles, hippos, lions, elephants, flocks   
    of flamingos and a diversity of indigenous peoples.      
                                                              
    Using state-of-the-art high definition filming             
    techniques, this series investigates the geological       
    forces which shaped East Africa's Great Rift, and which  
    make it one of the world's most wildlife-rich             
    landscapes.                                                
                                                              
    The Great Rift Valley channels a huge diversity of       
    waterways - rivers, lakes, waterfalls, caustic springs    
    and coral seas - spanning from Egypt to Mozambique.        
    Some lake and ocean deeps harbour previously unseen       
    life-forms, while caustic waters challenge life to the   
    extreme. But where volcanic minerals enrich the Great     
    Rift's waterways, they provide the most spectacular        
    concentrations of birds, mammals and fish in all Africa.
