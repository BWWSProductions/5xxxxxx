I like to get the new CH Pro version for FS2004. The boxed product of CH ProX consists of 5 DVD's. 4DVD's are the FSX version, the fifth DVD is the new Switzerland professional version and is for FSX (approx.16GB) and FS2004 (approx.4GB). Features: Winter texture; Night texture;Texture resolution: 2m/pixel; Mesh: 20m.  

Thanks

,mad_flyer,2010-04-20T08:13Z,Looking for FlyTampa KBOS v3 for FS2004 if anyone here has. The previous version uploaded here had white boxes which just ruined the scenery.
,BigBadMacys,2010-07-09T02:30Z,Thank you!
,buresboihowiee,2010-12-18T20:49Z,"does this work for fs2004, i know its not in the title or description but sometimes they do. "
,arran13,2011-03-10T01:16Z,seeeeeed! :) thanks for the torrent!
,derpex,2012-07-20T11:47Z,Am I doing something wrong? I installed it but the Grenadines scenery didn't appear.  TVSM is just an elevated runway above the ground and no other scenery.  TVSB just disappears when I land on it.  What gives?
