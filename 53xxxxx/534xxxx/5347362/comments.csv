I'm from Portugal and I can't watch this show on TV.  
It's one of my favourite shows and I have the first two seasons on dvd.
Why should I wait to see them? I watch it illegaly and legally and i bet  more people do like me."

It's funny cause you probably download torrents too and harm developers and producers you hippocrite, why else would you have an account on TPB?"
,Scorpio-65,2010-02-09T08:12Z,"Actually, it's going off air for 3 weeks due to a small thing called the Winter Olympics..."
,camarPL,2010-02-09T08:32Z,"@j0eh4x
Dude go check peers, more than half ppl downloading this file are not from USA and not english native speakers. I'm from Poland and I have no other possibility but to download it illegaly or wait untill it will be shown in my TV, but for example, in the biggest polish tv network house season 4 or 5 is shown atm :d"

,nickknock1,2010-02-09T09:31Z,"Same here, I live in Ireland, and with out the great people who download, I would get nothing."

"
,fredob1,2010-02-09T09:40Z,"Same here ""nickknock1"". It's nobodies fault if network executives are retarded, remember they cancelled Family Guy and Futurama simply because they didn't understand them. "
,Lasse1982,2010-02-09T11:06Z,"Another Great one! Cheers M8!

Keep up the good work!


Oii wanker! U dont need to be here if u think its so bad to DL so why the hell are u here then urself. shut ur mouth do u really think JUST because people are downloading this ""illegaly"" smegally the show ends? Then u really are stupid."
,jahberry,2010-02-09T13:31Z,"hilairious!
... apart from lasse1982 - no need... but well said all the same. 
cheers eztv, I wouldn't have known about this show if not for looking for your torrents... got S1 on dvd.... arrrr!

,Bosseking,2010-02-09T15:38Z,"Like many others, I also don't live in USA so the only way to see this show is to download it from the net. I mean they don't even air Chuck in Finland and I think they never will."
,drvcan,2010-02-09T17:11Z,thanks friends.
,j0eh4x,2010-02-09T21:40Z,"Ok so you all seem to be a little misinformed so let me enlighten you, Last season was supose to be the last season of chuck due to poor ratings. They didnt have the budget to do it.  The owner of the Subway corporation really liked the show so he put up the money for a third season.  And lastly if your in a foreign country go to Hulu.com and watch the show there.  Its commercial supported... and by commercial supported there is less than 2 minutes of commercials for the hour long show.  It gives back to the network making the show... BY all means fuck the network but if the show doesnt make money for the network then the show gets canceled and thats exactly whats happening to chuck so FUCK U"
,Neytiri,2010-02-09T23:58Z,"@j0eh4x What do you mean we seem a little misinformed? OBVIOUSLY you're the one that's misinformed - we have no other choice but to download them unless we'd like to wait 5 months +. We can't watch shit on Hulu, wanna know why? BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN THE STATES, simple as that! So please, read up on your... facts, before telling us to do anything at all, please."
,Max Wilder,2010-02-10T00:43Z,"Unless you are a Nielson family or watch through TiVo, the way you watch the show has no effect on the ratings. And the TiVo data is not considered very seriously, because they assume you fast forward through the commercials. And you think watching on Hulu will help? Dream on.

Chuck was doomed because there isn't a way for that type of show to get its financial support directly from the people who love it. It's a symptom of the stubborn misguided business model that television currently works on.

Live TV is dying. Let it go. Digital distribution (and probably subscription) is the future."
,yarnek,2010-02-10T08:41Z,"I'm also from Australia and I'm sick of crap shows and crappier programming on free to air. I can't afford the disgraceful price they charge for cable in this country or a set-top box for my TV. THAT'S why I download and then buy the DVD when the price drops to my budget. 
Thanks for adding a bit of enjoyment to my life eztv!"
,dark_huntress,2010-02-10T20:23Z,"Even if Chuck was aired where I live (Canada), I can't base my life schedule around when the show's on! If the network provided online downloads of the show I'd be there.

But it doesn't, so till then, I have little choice to download the episodes here.


As always, thanks for the upload! :)"
,kevin_bxl,2010-02-10T23:54Z,"yes, hulu is just for people who live in usa and even if it was available for everyone there is no way to put subtitles on it and everyone cannot understand all the show without.

And you seemed not aware of the ""how"" they calculate ratings.

You thing what ? big brother is watching you ?
No there is people who are chosen just like in a survey and they have devices at home to record what they see.
So unless the people who have those devices download and not see it at television whatever you see it or no."
,stripes2,2010-02-26T18:11Z,"Hulu is only available to users with a U.S. IP address, but you can use things like AnchorFree or have a friend in the U.S. set up a VPN or slingbox for you to watch. The problem with that, for people like j0eh4x, is that your multiple views won't get caught by the ratings folks (and therefore the advertisers). Sure, Hulu would work over anchorfree, but if you're outside the developed world (like me), bandwidth becomes a serious issue and the overhead of a VPN quickly ruins my internet connectivity (not to mention my monthly quota). I TRIED to download the series via iTunes, but it's still not available there. I'll buy the DVDs when they come out (as I did for season 1 and season 2), but we NEED folks to keep seeding these in order to keep building the fanbase that makes international sales possible (and profitable).

Or, to phrase closer in tenor to those used by j0eh4x in his original post, you're a douche."
