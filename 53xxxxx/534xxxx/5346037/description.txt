'Whole Lotta Shakin''/ 'Don't Knock The Rock' 1964 Granada TV Special


It was originally called 'Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On' when it was broadcast way back in 1964 but was re-broadcast in 1987 and was re-titled (for some reason) 'Don't Knock The Rock'.

"WHOLE LOTTA SHAKIN' GOIN' ON
( Granada Television ) 30th September 1964

Director: Philip Casson

Producer: John Hamp

Jerry Lee Lewis gave an unrehearsed performance in Granada's Studio 6, with The Animals and Gene Vincent. Apparently, the audience were so hyped-up by Jerry Lee that the camera crews had to fight to get any footage at all."

Songs featured:

Gene Vincent - 'Be-Bop-A-Lula'
The Animals - 'Talking About You' / 'Shout!'
Jerry Lee Lewis - 'Great Balls Of Fire'
Sounds Incorporated - 'William Tell Overture'
Little Richard - 'Rip It Up'
Gene Vincent - 'You're My Sunshine'
Jerry Lee Lewis - 'High School Hop' / 'I'm On Fire' / 'Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On'
Little Richard - 'Lucille' / 'Long Tall Sally' / 'Send Me Some Lovin' / 'Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On' / 'Hound Dog' / 'Good Golly Miss Molly'

Odd that they would allow both Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis to perform 'Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On' separtely on the same TV program.

It really is a fantastic piece of TV. The performances given by Lewis and Richard really do drive the audience into a frenzy. You can see what power they had has performers and it makes for fascinating viewing.
