The latest (2009) effort from Canadian blues/crooner Matt Dusk...and its just as good as his previous releases.  If you're already a fan, you'll like it...if you've never heard it but like the genre (ie: fellow Canadian Michael Buble), you will like Matt Dusk.

I got tired of waiting for someone else to up it so i bought it and am uppin it myself.  I scanned the entire booklet and covers but I'm not terribly pleased with the results...viewable/printable but there was something on the scanner I didn't know about until after i scanned them all...oh well, good enough i suppose.

L8R...enjoy!
