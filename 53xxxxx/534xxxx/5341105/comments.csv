[V],thethingy,2010-02-09T12:42Z,"MoonDookie, get back under your rock you fool, this is a cd image that you burn to disk and boot from, you dont unzip anything and it does not run in windows, prick."
,topcat787,2010-02-13T03:39Z,"Thx thethingy. On boot up it gives 2 choices windows and dos. It wouldn't let me boot to windows gui so i went with dos. I have 22gb on my C: drive win 7 64 bit. It started to backup and estimated 9hours, so I canceled. "
[V],thethingy,2010-02-13T13:18Z,"use the usb tool to make a bootable usb, or burn it to cd at the slowest possable speed, ive got this working fully on cd and usb as have others"
,hardhar2,2010-02-13T16:28Z,Thanks much!
,Dingo57,2010-02-14T02:43Z,Thanks mate. Works great. But when I combine it into my multiboot disc it requires name and serial. Any ideas? Thank you.
[V],thethingy,2010-02-14T03:09Z,"hello there, what is/what does the multiboot disc?,,,ive got this on cd and usb and never been asked for a serial"
,Bebras2,2010-02-15T23:16Z,thanks
,Dingo57,2010-02-22T12:12Z,"Multiboot grub4dos disc. You can boot iso files from usb or cd/dvd. On some machines I am getting asked for serial. Probably just due to my inexperience with grub4dos. If I extract to root of usb , I have no problems. If you have not heard of grub4dos head over to http://www.boot-land.net/forums/ and check out the forums. Thanks again."
,sixteenvolts,2010-02-26T18:55Z,"Good post, thethingy - thank you, from Chicago USA     :)"
,crispx,2010-04-01T18:48Z,This is the LIVE CD - where is the actual installable Suite?
,idaib,2010-04-25T01:54Z,"Dingo57,

Did you find a solution to the password/username request in grub4DOS? Strange how it only applies to certain computers."
,waistland,2010-06-01T15:41Z,"sn:0JQE20-64YJV5-NHJHN3-5P8H51-32R4MZ
use any user name"
,waistland,2010-06-01T15:42Z,That code worked for me  so though I would throw it out for you all! Thanks for the up :D
,Dingo57,2010-06-13T03:18Z,"Hi, Solution to key issue is to copy the BOOTDISK.KEY file to root of DVD or USB. The reason  I had different results with different PCs, is cause once you enter serial it saves as file on local machine, and no need to enter serial if booting from that PC again. Thanks Thethingy.
PS. Check out SARDU for an awesome boot rescue disk. http://www.sarducd.it/"
,XONi49,2010-07-06T15:15Z,you dont need to use Grub to boot from a usb drive just get hirens usb format tool just format and copy all files from the iso to the drive the issue with the key file is just the fact that the software automaticly looks for the key in the cd/dvd bay if you let the run all the way throw extra keyboard screen dont hit ok you wont have any issue with any usb booting   or just get the version 4.1.4 and use the usb format option in the real software (ive used this on everything from PNY to centon usbs to seagate freaagent and WD harddrives) 
,FAKMAN,2011-02-28T14:06Z,thx!!!
,fonaset,2011-06-16T08:42Z,"Hi ""thethingy"" I provided a password to my Hard Disk Drive from the Bios setup but I've forgotten the password. Will this great software allow me to either change the password or reveal it? Thanks"
,hpycmpr,2011-11-06T22:53Z,"thanks thethingy !! so many great things here that what i take, i am trying to seed too. hope im doing it correctly by leaving them for upload in bittorrent ? "
