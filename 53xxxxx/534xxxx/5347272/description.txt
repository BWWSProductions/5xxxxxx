This is a copy of Roxio Creator Basic v9 that i got off of an oem recovery image disc. It has a lot of good features including dvd authoring and iso burning. To install you just have to unzip the file, go to the extracted folder, find and click the "setup.exe" file, and proceed with the install. Since this came on an oem disc for windows, it was meant to auto-install with windows. So durring setup it will fill in the product key by its self. No worrys on activation.
