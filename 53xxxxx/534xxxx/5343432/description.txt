Hitachi_iXtreme_v1.51_with_readme-FINAL

IXtreme fw for all drives!


Features
--------

Wave X support

Support of future Waves of X360 game disc structures. New partition sizes and video data will be automatically supported and will be allowed to boot.

This represents a possibility of booting a bad backup but now that there is some good tools out there (like abgx360) to check your backups before you boot them, the risk is small.

So please check your backups to ensure consistency with the original!

Full support to flash all drives in the new Jungleflasher (0.1.51) including easy upgrade for Liteon iX1.5 drives (WIll get all info inc key from drive over SATA)
