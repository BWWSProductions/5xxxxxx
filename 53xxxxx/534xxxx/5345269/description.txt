Jersey Shore is a reality television series on MTV that follows eight housemates  spending their summer on the New Jersey Shore. The show was filmed in August 2009 in a summer share in Seaside Heights but was also filmed in other towns such as Toms River and Neptune and Atlantic City, New Jersey. It follows the eight housemates in a Real World-type style while they live, work and party at the Jersey Shore. The show debuted amid large amounts of controversy regarding the use of the words "Guido/Guidette", portrayals of Italian-American stereotypes and scrutiny from locals because the cast members are not residents from the area.
