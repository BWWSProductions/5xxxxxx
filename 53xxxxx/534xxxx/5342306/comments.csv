Just say NO to religion.

End superstition. 
Embrace rationalism. 
Develop and exercise critical thinking skills.
Throw your ""sacred"" texts on a bonfire... save just enough copies for the museums. "

Your problem is greater than just religion. You make no sense whatsoever nor are you logical or consistent. Using you reasoning you should also say get rid of all alcohol and tobacco products becasue of the ills they have caused to society? You don't, do you? See my point? In fact, you would NEVER say that, because your problem is that you love sin too much. You don't want God who calls you to judgment, but one that allows you to be gay, drink, smoke, and have sex with whomever or whatever you want. You love pleasure too much.

How can you lump all religions into one because of what one radical one does? It's not all religion that's dangerous, it's just nut jobs, not religion, but but radicals with murderous intent. Read the words of Jesus, He does NOT espouse ANY violence at all. What part of having mercy and loving your enemies don't you understand? Grow up and get wise and stop your idiocy before it's too late for you. You have a brain, use it!

Humans are specks on a planet that isn't even a speck in its own galaxy, let alone the entire universe. When is man going to realize that we don't know it all, and just maybe we are such nothings, that something did create us?"

Regardless, I'm not placing any bets on the ""truth"" lying within the preposterous mythologies of bronze-aged texts. "
,Frequentdler328,2011-09-12T12:29Z,(Sigh I will say it again.) Okay first off thanks to Yeshua for the UL and second when you comment on a torrent do it to either A: Comment on quality of the torrent. or B:ask for help using the torrent. or C: help someone who is having trouble using the torrent. Religious debates are for forums not comment sections please leave only helpful comments and don't start flame wars by insulting or questioning someone's beliefs it only leads to hurt feelings and pointless debates.
