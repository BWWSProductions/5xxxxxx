,LH-oswald,2010-02-07T21:10Z,im downloading this one but it is true you do quite often say your torrents are perfect quality when they are not
,doandroidsdreamofelectric,2010-02-07T21:30Z,"and to call catsout a spammer when you were the biggest spammer around is laughable,spamming other torrents is why you got demoted from vip remember"
,mojopriest75,2010-02-08T06:04Z,ok i take my hat off to the ppl that get these movies but can someone please answer this why the fuck do they 1 put movies on with either no picture or no sound 2 put the movie on then ave to be directed to some site that directs u to someone site that eventually comes up n says congratulations uve won a prize no disrespect to those who put there arses on the line to get these movies but plz at least have the decency to watch b4 uploadin to the web so that we dont spend ages downloadin n when its done think hey gr8 lets watch n theres nothin

,Arrowvil,2010-02-09T06:23Z,"Extremezone, my problem with you is a small one. From what I see you're taking over aXXo's place in the top of the download list, but all your copies are oversized (1+ GB). I was wondering if you could actually upload all your dvdscrs/dvdrips etc (unless they're unusually long movies) in the standard 700 MB size. Thanks mate."
,WHSKY8,2010-02-09T16:53Z,@Extremezone. I have always gotten good movies from you so I think you are a good up loader just like the rest of them. The problem you have is that you can dish it out but you can't take it when it is given back at you. Stop calling people stupid for voicing their opinion on your UL's and you do put out some crappy shit at times but so does everyone else. Thanks for the UL.
,Fatal87,2010-02-10T03:15Z,Extremezone is a fuckin idiot.  Not a DVDRIP because it uses telesync audio. SORRY retard. 
,davidkozat,2010-02-10T05:50Z,You guys all worry too much who says what about others at the end of the days aXXo has disappear from torrents and extremezone has became more popular even if you go to the top 100 movies all of them are his uploads!! so give uploaders respect without them there would be nothing....
,chalky_no1,2010-02-10T18:15Z,"u lot are all sad , R5 rips do have shit audio, and at the end of the day ur getting 2 own a movie tht hasnt been released yet, wtf u all moaning at, yes i dwnloaded the dvdscr and i think that it was very poor for a dvdscr but i aint gonna complain bout somthing that cost fook all, why dont u all just be happy with what u get ! "

,Snoopy_22,2010-03-01T03:56Z,"Audio is still terrible.  I've downloaded every top seeder daybreaker torrent on PB and they all use the same stupid audio.... not really worth it until someone stops copying eachother and gets some new audio.  Definitely not a DvDRip due to audio.

@realawesomedude: I provide people looking for torrents to get with information about such torrents so they do not have to waste their time on a poor quality download.

Morons like you probably dont have a lot to miss in their pathetic little lives but there are different kinds of people out there.

I would be majorly surprised if your disfigured inbred eyes and ears could even spot the difference between a CAM and a proper DVD or BlueRay Rip.

stfu please, thank you."
,gani.slimshady,2010-04-18T15:56Z,Just to clarify..isn't extreme zone a hot chick and not a guy?

,willow72,2011-04-02T21:13Z,"A/8 V/8  Still a decent rip... not the greatest movie, but it will pass the time."
