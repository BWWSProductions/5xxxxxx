,Unahim,2010-02-10T15:31Z,"I tried to instal the 32bit one on my laptop, which seemed to go well.

However, when I got to the login screen, it rebooted and now I get a black screen with a cursor every time.

The only thing I can do is go to setup, safe mode, etc, will not work.
Worst thing is that not even my repair dvds do anything.

Now, when >I get to setup, it asks me a password. I tried passwords from my old accounts, it doesn't work. Leaving it blank also doesn't work.

Could you please send me the password you used for it, Ubuhage?
You're my only hope! You can email it to jordyvanderstukken@hotmail.com or leave a reply here"

,gbroman,2010-03-02T09:18Z,"Downloaded this complete torrent and tried to install the 64Bit to a slave drive.It installed and then wouldn'open into windows. Only bought up the Starting Windows screen with the Win7 logo. Sat there for ages going no further. Deleted it and then reinstalled it to a partition on master C drive. It didn't install to the partition but overwrote the W7 32Bit I had installed on C drive. Then it wouldn't open as before, sit there on screen with the Windows 4 coloured logo pulsing like it does.
What I did notice was that during the instal of 64Bit W7 when it gets to the 'Expanding files' part was that it gets about halfway through and then suddenly its rebooted and gas gone to opening Windows. It seemed strange to me as it hadn't done the other two parts that follow the Expanding files...what are they now...Installing devices and Saving settings I think they are..plus Network setup, and Enter License Key (which I presume I'm meant to skip past and continue as trial mode til the loader's used?)
Also once it had ""finished"" the instal I hadn't used the Loader...I forgot to do it.
Deleted the whole drive, formatted and reinstalled my 32Bit W7 and was p****ed to the maXX. I hadn't made a backup of W7 32Bit on C drive because I was intending to instal to the C drive partition I had created and had directed the instal of W7x64Bit to be loaded.
What did I do wrong (apart from not doing the backup) and whats the story with the instal seeming to not finish parts of it?
Any advice welcome thanks."

During Install of this Win 7 make sure you tell the installer when it asks, to NOT Auto Update.
The installer can (in many cases) find your Modem & get those updates before you even know it.

Unplug your Modem particularly if its the 
permanently setup Router type during install &
when install finished before connecting your Modem check in Windows Auto Update that it is set to Manual & check the details of any Update  @@@@ "

After the installation completed, it said ""Welcome"" and showed the loading circle spinning, then said ""Shutting down"" and it restarted and when it had to show the ""Starting Windows"" screen with the color balls moving, the computer showed a black screen with a blinking cursor instead, and that was it, it didn't do anything else.
Now, somehow I found out that there is a parameter in the BIOS settings that has to be corrected (at least in my case, that I have an Intel motherboard). I went to the BIOS settings, then to the ADVANCED tab, then to the BOOT CONFIGURATION option and then there I ENABLED the ""MAX CPUID VALUE LIMIT"", and that's it. I saved the changes, rebooted and the computer started smoothly (Those steps were with an Intel motherboard, in any other brand must be very similar). No problems so far.
