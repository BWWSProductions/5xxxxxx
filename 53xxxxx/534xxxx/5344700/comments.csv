,dinodrums,2010-02-12T11:59Z,Fine but what about when it says INSERT REASON 4 DVD? Isn't there a DVD hack included in this?
,dinodrums,2010-02-12T13:57Z,"Ok, for all those that are struggling with Toast recognising and mounting this, use IMAGE BURNER INSTEAD. 
http://web.me.com/adg/imageburner/index.html

Only Image burner will burn a true image + Reaktor Icon, then you may proceed with install flawlessly.. TOAST DOESN'T EVEN MOUNT THIS!!!"
,alteredspare,2010-02-13T05:27Z,"toast didnt mount it however in the instructions it mentions burning it to dvd.  I did this and it worked.  When it asked for a disc I inserted the one I burned.  Afterwards, I never needed the disc again."

,nave8d,2010-05-01T17:00Z,I have tried EVERY suggestion here about the insert DVD problem but to no avail. I am running 10.6 may this be the problem? Any suggestions?
