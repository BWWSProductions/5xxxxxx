Making music should be as easy as powering up a computer, loading up a powerful piece of music software, and getting down to business. And it is. Reason version 4 is a virtual studio rack with all the tools and instruments you need to turn your ideas into music. And it's more than just a set of excellent synths and effects. It's a complete music system. Step into the age of Reason.

Instructions and serial included.  If the serial doesn't work, and it should, works for me, then you can easily do a google search to find one that will work.

PLEASE SEED!!!
