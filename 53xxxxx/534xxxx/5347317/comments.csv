,RyviusRan,2010-02-09T07:44Z,This seems to be the fastest torrent I checked the others and all the others had slow download speeds
,Tilatus,2010-02-09T09:43Z,"And as the masses come the speed went down. I have to ask, is this with the fix already in it?"
,Chaotic_Children,2010-02-09T09:46Z,do I have to mount it on a cd or dvd or a daemon or alcohol?
,Tilatus,2010-02-09T10:27Z,"@chaotic_children: It being an .iso file mounting it on Daemon should do the trick.

Thank the great Seeder at the internets, the speed got up again."
,FTL3,2010-02-09T13:40Z,"UPDATED BIOSHOCK 2 CRACK WITH ALL MISSING FILES INSIDE!

This is the updated Bioshock 2 Crack by Razor1911 - Apparently they left out some files in the original crack. ENJOY!

,davitodude,2010-02-09T20:30Z,"Downloads quickly. I had it finished and playing within 4-5hours. Of course I slept during that time so it might have finished even faster. 

1.)Take the entire file and mount with daemon tools ( or my favorite, wincdemu) and install the game. You'll get a no disc and move to step 2.

2.)Copy the launcher file from the download and then paste it into the proper bioshock 2 folder - computer/whatever disc your using/program files/2k games/sp/builds/binaries - paste over the launcher that's already there.

3.)Mount the image again and everything should start up. 

To play the game online all you need is a games for windows live key code. Doesn't matter from what game any will do. 

If you don't care about online and want to save your files just hit the home key when the game starts and make an offline profile.

Also If you haven't already download games for windows live client. http://www.microsoft.com/games/en-US/index.aspx"

,iambobby,2010-02-10T04:21Z,"Hey leechers, just seed 1kb/s. I am and for about 2 hours i uploaded 1MB. if atleast half of the people downloading uploaded that much, maybe the downloads would be faster!"
,lorht,2010-02-10T09:05Z,"@davitodude

I did step 1
then i did step 2
how to do step 3? How do you Mount it again when you already installed it? What do you mean?

can anyone help me"
,Tilatus,2010-02-10T10:14Z,"@lorht: No mounting necessary after the crack. It is a crack you know. Just launch the game. I used the fixed crack from elsewhere just in case and works perfectly.

Works real nice, thank you 50c3nt for delivering the goods!"
,lorht,2010-02-10T10:37Z,"@Tilatus

Can you tell me how to get it to work? I did step 1 en 2 i click in my folder on the Launcher EXE ( The one from the fix that op copyd over the other one ) And i get some Disc error thign can you explain what exectly you did then"
,Tilatus,2010-02-10T14:03Z,@lorht: I suggest you download the crack from for example btarena. org and try that one.

,The_Holy_Thrasher,2010-02-21T22:19Z,"Hey, guys I've downloaded and installed Bioshock from here. Game launched ok, but when I'm starting Single Player, after 1st level is loaded and ""Press spacebar"" sign is appearing, I'm pressing it and game crashes...

What can you tell 'bout this? It's a pity that I've wasted 7Gb of my internet-traffic on this... "

,biogenesiss,2010-03-09T21:59Z,"I downloaded this and the other fix/Missing files, it works fine and all, Cept during game play; a lot of the time when you press Esc to save, the option to save isn't there, you have no choice but to start new or exit to windows, I don't know if or what I'm doing wrong but that issue alone made downloading this a complete waste of time.. Note: yes I'm using an offline profile, But still shouldn't be having this problem.."
,biogenesiss,2010-03-09T22:31Z,Can anyone help me with this??
,biogenesiss,2010-03-10T08:20Z,"Yeah..didn't think so... don't download this, just go buy it, ripped games never work right and most the time end up not being worth downloading."
,dinfernal,2010-04-28T22:56Z,"""Razor1991""? xD"
,mrvain32,2010-08-25T10:34Z,"Very irritating :

1) Tried to mount ""rzr-bio2""

2) Installed the game & Windows Live too.

3) When opening the installed game dir I found folders like SP, MP.

4) Where should I copy the crack. Which is of 80kb??

5) I tried copying it in SP folder inside the binaries folder

6) Tried running it failed. I tried 3-4 times in diff ways but it all failed.

Completely disappointed. Thanks for the headache..."
,SmexMuffin,2011-05-05T12:22Z,Can someone that has msn and TeamViewer help me with this because I fail at doing this stuff ;-;
