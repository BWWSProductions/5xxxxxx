Creating brilliant Psy-Trance â€“ or any music for that matter â€“ takes more than a good ear and a dabble on Cubase. Even the most technically-minded of us need to invest in the real insight, experience and expert know-how needed to create those mesmerising, effortless, canâ€™t-stop-dancing sounds of unforgettable nights (and mornings) out all over the world. Thatâ€™s why we created the Psy-Trance Music Production Course â€“ a comprehensive video tutorial thatâ€™ll take you and your Cubase skills from blank canvas to an explosion of colour, texture and depth. Take a look for yourself. Go on. You know you want to.
Course Overview
The Psy-Trance Music Production Course is perfect for beginners or intermediates (and no previous experience on Cubase is necessary - any DAW will do), giving a comprehensive step-by-step tutorial in every layer of the production process â€“ from the subtleties of synths and sound effects to final arrangement and mastering.
The course â€“ which has been developed and fine-tuned by Cubase Guru over a period of six months â€“ is split into nine distinct sections, so you can learn at your own pace in manageable chunks.
Because when we say comprehensive, we mean comprehensive. The course is over ten hours long in total, plus thereâ€™s a free bonus package of 13 extra video tutorials included to help you refine your tracks even further. Youâ€™ll get a project PDF included with each tutorial explaining what samples, effects, processors and VST instruments are used in each section, plus any links to demos and recommended or alternative music production software youâ€™ll need to complete each stage.
We also make sure youâ€™re fully kitted out with the patches and presets you need for each effect and VST instrument, as well as Access Virus T1 hardware (if youâ€™ve got it).
And if your connection speed isnâ€™t great â€“ no problem. Cubase Guru supplies all videos in both high resolution and a maximum-quality lower-res format, so you can get going in a matter of minutes.
