this v1.0 get 1.1 patch for this

look for 1.1:

Version 1.1 - 
   *  Fixed the bug that caused a crash if you had a
        companion during a save.
   *  A ""Speed Slider"" has been added that allows the user
        to select the speed that the game plays out between 
        ranges of 70% to 100%. It is accessed by hitting 
        the ""escape"" button.
   *  Many optimizations to the size and frequency of network 
        packets. This will help lower bandwidth connections.
   *  Faster 3D rendering (making the game generally run
        faster).
   *  Fixed rendering error that occurred in some loaded 
        saved games with dragons.
   *  Fixed a crash bug that could occur during map 
        transitions (unrelated to companions).
   *  Added detection of corrupt save games file when trying 
        to load.
   *  Other, smaller bug fixes (such as fixing the tool tips 
        for buttons so that it doesn't show an extra blue dot 
        when there is no tool tip, etc).

,v17r,2011-03-17T13:21Z,@rems500 you said this has the bonus content. where? I can't find it anywhere.  does it install at the same time as the game? 
,v17r,2011-03-17T14:40Z,never mind. I've verified it and it doesn't have the bonus content.
,JJackrabbit,2011-04-27T20:39Z,I need the bonus CD for the fun part of the game
