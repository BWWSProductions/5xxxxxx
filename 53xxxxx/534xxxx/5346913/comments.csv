,Fisherman619,2010-02-17T04:13Z,"Just finished the game so yes this works and is complete!! Thanks noobish! I just mounted it, opened it and copied the razor 1911 folder. Installed then replaced the SP and MP folder that was inside the razor 1911 folder to the root folder (c drive insall) Then just double click the Bioshock2launcher.exe from inside root folder and viola!! A Razor1911 splash comes up. Bad Ass!!!!!!  I dont know of any multiplayer game that works with a cracked copy so no. MP doesnt work! I will add tho, THIS GAME IS WELL WORTH THE $$. JUST GO BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! REALLY!
