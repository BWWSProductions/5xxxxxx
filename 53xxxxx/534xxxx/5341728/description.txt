Ricky Tomlinson reads from his autobiography. 


Ricky Tomlinson is famous for his many TV and screen performances - The Royle Family, Brookside, Cracker, Clocking Off, Nice Guy Eddie, Riff Raff, Raining Stones, Once Upon a Time in the Midlands, The 51st State and Mike Bassett England Manager. This frank and fascinating autobiography tells the story of the man behind the characters, and charts the circuitous route by which he came to be a British household name. Ricky's mother used to tell him that he had lived three lives, but she underestimated the number - he has been a plasterer, banjo player, stand-up comic, union agitator, political activist, film extra, award-winning actor and unwilling guest of her majesty's prison service.
