[T],rkimble,2010-02-10T00:12Z,"Thanks for the smaller version. Been hoping for a good rip of this series for a long time.

How 'bout posting it on OneBigTorrent.com for the people who have gotten to 21% of the DVD's. "
[T],Pharos2001,2010-02-10T17:04Z,Whomever seems to be seeding isn't 67.197.114.11 is unpingable and only partially traceable before timing out. I have paused my UL/DL until I see some movement.

[T],TalmudTimmy,2011-02-26T18:59Z,"Wow. Almost every person interviews in this film is Jewish, including the two ""stars"" of the film, Sigmund Freud and his nephew Eward Bernays. And this is supposed to be objective?"
,bazquux,2011-08-29T23:23Z,"Curtis has a lot to answer:
""Ask him why he has failed to respond to the articles and letters that have been sent to him. Ask him why The Century of the Self gave so much detailed attention to Guatemalan history, and yet failed to mention U.S. responsibility for the 150,000 civilians killed as a result of its assault on Guatemala. Ask why the series focused on this isolated U.S. intervention without mentioning that it was a small part of similar interventions elsewhere in Latin America and in the Third World generally. Is this wider pattern not central to understanding the real significance, and costs, of corporate control of domestic and foreign societies in the 20th and 21st centuries?""
