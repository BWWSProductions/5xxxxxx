PERFECT LIVES â€” BACKGROUND, CREDITS, SYNOPSIS

Robert Ashleyâ€™s television opera â€œaboutâ€ bank robbery, cocktail lounges, geriatric love, adolescent elopement, et al, in the American Midwest. One of the definitive text-sound compositions of the late 20th century, it has been called a comic opera about reincarnation.

    â€œNothing less than the first American opera, written within an American language utilizing various American attention spans: snippets for the channel switchers, layers of meaning for the smart-alecks, something for everyone, and accessible. Works such as this put to rest any doubts if opera can or should survive, and how.â€ â€” Fanfare (Allan Evans), March/April 1992

PRODUCTION HISTORY

PERFECT LIVES was developed musically through live performances in Europe and America. â€œBlueâ€ Gene Tyranny was Ashleyâ€™s first collaborator â€” his keyboard melodies and harmonies define the character of Buddy. Tyranny and Ashley performed a chamber version of the piece many times together (including at The Kitchen in early 1978). Shortly after, The Kitchen commissioned PERFECT LIVES as an opera for television, the live version expanded to include richly layered orchestral tapes produced by composer Peter Gordon, and the singing of Jill Kroesen and David Van Tieghem. In 1980, John Sanborn recorded the basic video tracks on location in Illinois according to the templates provided by Ashleyâ€™s score. From this material, The Lessons, a preview version of the opera (based on keyboard gestures by â€œBlueâ€ Gene Tyranny) was produced through the TV Lab at WNET.

In the fall of 1982, a pre-sale was obtained from Channel Four Television in Great Britain, making possible the completion of Perfect Lives. John Sanborn, the television director, designed an elaborate shooting and editing plan for the visual elements of Ashleyâ€™s score. The post-production was completed this August (1983) at VCA Teletronics, under the supervision of Dean Winkler, who worked with Sanborn on image processing and was the videotape editor. Since its premiere on Great Britainâ€™s Channel Four in 1984 PERFECT LIVES has been broadcast throughout Europe and in various cities in the United States.

PERFECT LIVES was produced with support from the National Endowment for the Arts (Media and Visual Arts Programs), the New York State Council on the Arts (Media Program), the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Beards Fund.

Over the years Lovely Music has made various formats of PERFECT LIVES available: on audio cassette in 1984; on CD in 1991, for which the audio track was re-mastered by Allan Tucker at Foothill Digital; on VHS in 1994; and in 2005, on DVD, completely re-mastered at Blink Digital under the supervision of Dean Winkler, available in both NTSC and PAL.

In 1991, Burning Books (Santa Fe) published a hard cover edition of PERFECT LIVESâ€™ libretto, edited by Melody Sumner Carnahan, with Robert Ashleyâ€™s commentary.

Raoul de Noget (No-zhay), a singer, and his friend, Buddy, â€œThe Worldâ€™s Greatest Piano Player,â€ have come to a small town in the Midwest to entertain at The Perfect Lives Lounge. For some reason, unexplained, they have fallen in with two people from the town, Isolde (â€œnearing 30 and not yet spoken forâ€) and her brother, â€œD,â€ just out of high school and known as â€œThe Captain of the Football Teamâ€ (his parents call him Donnie), to commit the perfect crime, a metaphor for something philosophical: in this case, to remove a sizable amount of money from The Bank for one day (one day only) and â€œlet the whole world know that it was missing.â€

            â€œDâ€ is currently Assistant to the Manager at The Bank. He learns that Gwyn, one of the tellers, intends to elope with his friend, Ed. â€œDâ€ is asked to â€œcome alongâ€ with Dwayne, another friend, who has a problem speaking (that is, he speaks, but has trouble being understood.) â€œDâ€ knows the key to opening the safe. The plan is, then: to take away the money in Edâ€™s car to Indiana (goal of the elopers), to keep it in circulation, as it were. They leave at 5 AM.

            While the lovers are in passage, Raoul and Buddy, with Buddyâ€™s dogs, and, separately, Isolde enter The Bank at midday. The dogs create a ruckus (â€œlike a noise from Hadesâ€) that gives Isolde the excuse to get a bucket of water from next door to throw at the dogs and miss and soak the Bank Manager, who goes into the safe for a change of clothes, only to discover that â€œThe Bank has no money in The Bank.â€ As part of the plan, Isolde has phoned the Sheriffâ€™s Office, disguising her voice (her father, Will, is the Sheriff; Ida is her mother) to report an accident â€œout on the highway.â€ There is no â€œaccident,â€ of course, and, recognizing the meaning of the decoy, Will puts it all together later under Idaâ€™s questioning. But itâ€™s too late.

            Among the tellers (Jennifer, Kate, Eleanor, Linda, and Susie) who are witnesses to the dogfight and the terrible discovery and who understand what happenedâ€”from different points of view, so to speak â€” only Susie noticed that the dogs â€œwent out together,â€ and sheâ€™s not telling. She fell for opera at first sight because of Buddy, who because of his fancy style of dress is often mistaken for a foreigner (â€œThereâ€™s no doubt the Mexican is in it. The doubt is that heâ€™s Mexican.â€) That was at 12:45 PM (â€œremember that!â€) And in The Bank at that time are Helen and John, innocent bystanders from The Home, doing business â€œon a holiday.â€ That is, they have fallen in love (in The Home), but they are not allowed to marry, or one will â€œlose the privileges.â€ So, every other weekend they take adjoining rooms at the motel right off The Park (where, by coincidence, Raoul and Buddy live, and where we first meet Raoul trying to order breakfast on the phone.) This is just the beginning of their weekend, and at 3 PM we see them in The Supermarket, shopping, a little jangled, set against each other by the excitement, but far from down and out.

            Sometime later, probably Monday, in The Bar, Buddy and Raoul on their â€œday off from musicâ€ have come to celebrate, little knowing that there they will meet Rodney, The Bartender, whose wife, Baby, aspires to Boogie Woogie, ceaselessly and without much success (â€œHappy she is the traveling salesmen say, but Boogie Woogie she is not.â€) studying the video tapes (The Lessons) that Buddy takes around with him and distributes at the local music store wherever he is playing. Rodney is philosophical, especially about Babyâ€™s talents, but skeptical about Boogie Woogie. And â€œnow heâ€™s met his nemesis...face to face.â€ They talk.

            Meanwhile, back in time (to the evening of the big day), Will and Ida, in The Living Room, solve the puzzle, perhaps even to the motive, but itâ€™s too late. Somewhere in Indiana, with the money hidden in the car (unknown to Gwyn, of course: â€œGwynâ€™s not guiltyâ€) and certain of their success, Ed and Gwyn and Dwayne and â€œDâ€ have found a Justice of the Peace who will perform the ceremony (â€œI handle speed traps, elopements, true signatures and the likeâ€), and who recognizes in Gwyn something so urgent (â€œand why is the Bride-to-be soâ€”uhnâ€”what is the word?â€), something so dramaticâ€”â€(She is a (pâ€™)monkey, Sir.â€) â€” that he is transported to somewhere in the past, to another ceremony, to another Bride-to-be (â€œLucille,â€ who speaks in tongues), to a confusion of time and place where other (famous) marriages are enacted: â€œSnowdrift,â€ abandoned at the altar; and so forth. And while we pause to eat the wedding cake, his humble situation (â€œright off my bedroom is my officeâ€) is transformed before our very eyes into The Church (â€œthe church of the great light.â€) And we are satisfied.

            Meanwhile, back in town, in The Backyard, a few friends and relatives have gathered, as usual in summer, to picnic, to celebrate the changing of the light at sundown. And watching from the doorway of her motherâ€™s house, Isolde counts the days.

CAST AND COLLABORATORS

â€œThe collaborative aspect of the work follows principles I have used for many years in search of a new operatic style. The collaborators are given almost absolute freedom to develop characterizations from the textual and musical materials I provide. The musical and visual materials are coordinated through â€˜templatesâ€™, a term I have come to use to describe the subjective assignment of emotional values and moods to visual forms and corresponding musical structures. Within the rules defined by the â€˜templatesâ€™ the collaborators in all aspects of the work are free to interpret, â€˜improviseâ€™, invent and superimpose characteristics of their own artistic styles onto the texture of the work. In essence, the collaborators become â€˜charactersâ€™ in the opera at a deeper level than the illusionistic characters who appear on stage.â€ â€” Robert Ashley

ROBERT ASHLEY

Robert Ashleyâ€™s opera-for-television projects and other large-scale narrative works have brought him international renown as a composer and as a writer. He has influenced a generation of composers and artists working with new forms of music for the media.

    â€œElectronically innovative, socially provocative, and incorrigibly theatrical, Robert Ashley epitomizes the conceptualism of the 1960s, yet more than any other figure he has also transcended it. No other composer is so associated with, or recognizable by, his own voice: mellow, nonchalant, and invitingly husky, he has used it in almost every work. Only a handful of his mature compositions are instrumental, without text. Unlike his conceptualist colleagues, he has never put his musicâ€™s emphasis primarily on technical gadgets or sonic phenomena. His works have often focused on sex, violence, and everyday life, and he is so fascinated by music as a social function that he has written, â€œthe most radical redefinition of music that I could think of would be one that defines â€˜musicâ€™ without reference to sound.â€ â€” Kyle Gann, American Music in the 20th Century, Schirmer Books, 1997

    â€œOperas so vast in their vision that they are comparable only to Wagnerâ€™s Ring cycle or Stockhausenâ€™s continuing mystical seven-evening Licht cycle. In form and content, in musical, vocal, literary and media technique, they are, however, comparable to nothing else.â€ â€” The Los Angeles Times (Mark Swed)
