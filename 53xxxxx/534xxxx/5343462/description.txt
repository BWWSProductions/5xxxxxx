This is the fifth of five DVD disks in the complete Season 5 of LOST. This is a DVD5 image, which means you can download and burn it using almost any DVD drive. It was compiled by me from the original DVD9 version of the same disk. Enjoy and please let me know what you think.
 
Changes from original DVD9:
*ABC Logo and Warnings are removed
*All non-English audio tracks and subtitles are omitted
*All video is slightly compressed to make it fit on a DVD5 disk
*The hidden easter eggs are all there, though the are accessible not the same way as on the original DVD. You gonna have to figure out how =)

IMPORTANT NOTICE: The final episode, The Incident, is split in two parts for the DVD release, which lead to it being slightly re-edited. As the result, several scenes play in the different order, and a couple of lines is missing here and there. If you are the crazy fan and want to have the most complete version, you may want to hold onto your HD version of the same episode.


I will seed this torrent for as long as I can, but eventually I will be forced to burn it on a disk and remove it from my hard drive to make way for other great DVDs. Since then it will be totally up to people like you to continue to seed this torrent. Please, once you download it, seed it for at least several days - let other people download it. You are also encouraged to post links to this very torrent on other websites: the more people will download it, the better are the chances that it will be available for a long period of time.
