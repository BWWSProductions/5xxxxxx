,Lucretious,2010-02-07T03:43Z,"watch out, there are several viruses being uploaded under the STALKER CoP crackfix name. One called ""Pure Love"" thats not being detected by any virus programs yet."
,kalha,2010-02-07T04:16Z,"From what I can tell this looks legit. FTL3 has lots of cracks without a career of complaints and the cracked file in this torrent has only 6 bytes altered in comparison to the original crack shipped with the ISO:

 4D3E5:	04	28
 4D3E6:	13	7F
 4D3E7:	49	07
 4D3F6:	04	28
 4D3F7:	13	7F
 4D3F8:	49	07

The other torrent appears suspicious: 1.3 mb rar file while the cracked file itself should be barely 1 mb and half a meg when compressed."

Thanks FTL3"
,M0ndos,2010-02-08T23:12Z,Am I the only one getting stuttering problems
,darksniper88,2010-02-09T00:38Z,"""cannot open file ""fsgame.ltx"".
Check your working folder.""

x( damn"
,kalha,2010-02-09T05:15Z,"No, you're not the only one with stuttering problems. The stutters seem quite similar to when I used creative's soundcard with the original Stalker (worked fine with Clear Sky though), but there were no stutters with motherboard's integrated realtek audio. Although those stutters were far more severe and pretty much hung up the game in couple of minutes. I haven't played much more than just tried though."
,4LexMiguel,2010-02-12T23:35Z,"crack works perfect . For vista users you need to start the game from the Windows Games Menu from the Start Menu . 

If you click on engine.exe you will get error

""fsgame.ltx"".
Check your working folder."" 

Tks for release + fix razor"

,dusan.bre,2010-11-27T21:10Z,"it is FAKE, it is ALL ABOUT SOME Folding@home SHIT!!"
,kaliver,2010-12-31T01:48Z,"^ dear god

fix is fine. if you cracked the original game you should be aware that the included xrEngine.exe is what needed fixing and it's included here with the superfluous F@H (which you needn't install)."
