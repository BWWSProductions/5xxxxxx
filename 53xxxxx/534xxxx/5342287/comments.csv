Can someone with more experience uploading shed some light on why I can create a torrent and then when it checks only makes it up to 99.8.  I apologize to any current leechers if this isn't successful, I'll keep seeding until I hear some definite feedback that it does, or doesn't work properly for you.  Please let me know!"

Thanks for the upload (I grabbed Season 3) though."
,AErthule,2010-02-11T15:47Z,"It seems to me that the videos themselves are all intact, so I still think this is a worthwhile download for the Aeon Flux lovers.

That is very odd about the names; they are correct in my files.  (I compared titles when I open them?? any ideas?)  I did notice I forgot to mention that the shorts are .wmv files though.  Thanks."
