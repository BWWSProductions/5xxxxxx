Remastered at 320VBR reel to reel tape from Dec 25, 1972.

KNAC in Long Beach, CA did a series for "An evening with xx" programs

Some had band members present others did not.

I have several more of "An evening with series" and some 3 hour OTA from the same era complete with the commercials.  If there is interest in more of this,  post a comment and I will provide.
