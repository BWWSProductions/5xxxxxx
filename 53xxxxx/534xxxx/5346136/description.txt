The Aso, a family of four, live in the old town of Nara. On the day of the Jizo Festival in the dizzying heat of midsummer, Kei, one of the Asos' twin boys suddenly disappears, as if he had been spirited away... For the family left behind, the flow of time stopped on that day. Five years later. Seventeen-year old Shun, the remaining twin, is a high school student, a member of the art club. He is working on a life-sized drawing of his brother, who he has been unable to forget. He and his childhood female friend, Yu, share a tentative attraction, but they are awkward around each other. Shun and Yu and their families all carry emotions that have no release. Each of them is searching for a way out. Then, one day, Yu finds out the secret of her birth. Shun learns what became of his brother. With their losses concealed deep in their hearts, Shun and Yu are about to make a move forward with their lives.
