This video runs at 29.971 fps but every fifth frame is a duplicate. So there are still only 24 unique frames per second. This will annoy some viewers since every fifth frame is shown twice as long as the other frames. A solution is to run it in AviSynth with Decimate(5), which ignores the duplicate frames and runs the video 24 fps."

Best rip on the net.
Thanks sm."
,Q9999,2010-02-13T12:55Z,"Fix for the Audio Video sync problem:
-------------------------------------------

The Problem:
---------------

The Audio is delayed by 2900 ms == 2.9 seconds - plus - it?s too long for the normal 29.970 fps (frames per second), it needs to be 29.989 fps.

This way the Audio starts at the correct time and the video rate lines up with the Audio.


The Solution:
---------------

TO FIX I used: ""AviDemux"" from: http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/

Download the ZIP file under ?Windows? - 2.5.2 ZIP from either link: Berlios.de or SourceForge.

Note: This program (using the zip file) is StandAlone so no install is required.

Just extract the files to somewhere you?re going to use it from (eg: Downloads or DownloadsRun or DownloadsRunAviDemux ).


Click the applcation called: avidemux2_gtk


Once AviDemux is running, it?s easy to change an MP4?s sync and rate - which is what the problem is here.


AviDemux program
----------------------

- Drag and drop the MP4 file (Avatar.mp4) into the AviDemux -or- Open it using File | Open | etc..


- Under Video - leave it on ?Copy?


- Under Audio - leave it on ?Copy?

- Under Audio - check the ?Shift? box

- Under Audio - next to 'Shift', type the negative number: -2900


- Under Format: select ?MP4?


- On the Top Menu: Click ?Video? go down to ?Frame Rate? type the exact number: 29.989 then click: OK


- Select the range using the bottom slider to ?mark? the ?start? and ?end? of the Copy you?re making.

- With the slider at the beginning of the movie: click button: A

- Next with the slider at the end of the movie: click button: B


- Now you are ready: click the ?Save? button and select a name (eg: Avatar-fix.mp4)


Note: No encoding is done so it?s very Fast and there is No Loss of Quality !!!


Note2: If you want to encode/burn to a dvd you?ll most likely have to rencode it from the fixed 29.989 delayed 2.9 secs copy you just made to a remuxed copy. This is since some dvd software assumes (and will set) the frame rate back to the standard 29.970 and ignore the Audio delay you put in. Your dvd will be out of sync the same as the download was.

You can use AviDux to do this, however that is beyond the scope of what I?m trying to help with here.


Note3: Enjoy !


Thx Uploader !!!!! whoever you are...

Very much appreciated after about 15 downloads and a waste of the internet?s bandwidth - sorry Cisco ... (they route most of the traffic on the internet NA, huge water cooled rooms, etc..).

Have Fun.

Thanks for the technical explanation - you're right - very frustrating as the picture quality is awesome, but jerky/stuttered, even if converted to DVD with convertxtodvd, such a shame. 

Heads up - only download if you're savvy enough to correct this problem, because if you're not (like me) it will p*ss you off."
,dlarrym,2010-02-15T22:58Z,"This version and the FLAWLESS version end about 8 min. premature. This ends with Jake Sully hanging onto a missle on ""The DRAGON"" gun ship. You do not even see him toss the missle into the spinning blades and then blows up the entire gun ship and this scene leads to the final battle where one of the big CAT like creatures lets Jake Sully's Alien Chick get on its back to battle the insane Cammander in the AMP suit. Then the Main Military bad guy Breaks the device that is allowing Jake to link with his Avatar and he crawls out into the alien atmosphere and is saved by his girl who sees who he really is for the 1st time. Then the try to save Sigorna Weaver Chanracter ""GRACE"" by trying to let the try of spirits move her soul permanently into her avatar body..... It doesn't work..... And this is missing the final end where you see the natives watching as the ""SKY People"" are escorted to there ships to get the hell and leave PANDORA for good.???? ALL of the above is NOT in this copy. You can tell instantly because the movie is almost 3 hours long..... this one loads into the player ans it only has 2 hrs and 24 minutes of total movie length... the REAL movie length is 2 hrs 42 mins LONG.... GOTO IMDB and see for your self. It seems logical that when someone decided to fuck with the encoding, they entered the wrong minutes for there software and instead of telling the encoding software it ended in 2 hrs and 42 mins. . .  some dyslexic ass put the mins in as 24 instead of 42???? WHY FUCK with re-encoding a screener in the first place. If it was left alone and you just let the software auto re-encode all would be fine... ALSO the same unmentioned person admits they screwed up the FPS???? why not set your encoder on AUTO????? why change a screener..... it is the same as the retail version will be so no adjustments were needed???? had it been a TS.... ok,,, do what you can to make it more bareable.... but your assuming that a higher FPS rate must equal better.... then why is a HUGELY pain in the ASS fix posted????? HAD it been made to XviD and the settings were left on default and Auto ALL would have a great copy not one that screws you out of the last 30 mins of the story?????"

I had a damaged AVI importer file I had to toss and replace..... so the length is in fact correct, My player was reading blocks of data yo calculate the total time, The issue was that it was using a damaged formula to figure how many bytes each block had, so since the size of the memory in the block was flawed, it could never, WITH OUT REMOVING AND FIXING THEY FILE, ever have a correct time of play. Having said that, The BS with the EXTRA frame issue is real Pain... Sorry but it is....?? Do not really know what made this error, but the fix (A) It was made to the members that are PC owners and MAC owners are just screwed????? There is a fix no matter the system and in reality, there are more like 10 Operating Systems still in major use today.....and another 3 or 4 more non-mainstream OS's too. ANYWAY..... I was totally wrong about the end being missing.... but try fixing the FPS issue and re-upload???? Actually, That is the very reason I am not posting anymore and took most of what I had down. . .  someone always ragged on the upload.... and some were ligit problems people were having and I fixed stuff and re posted, but I do see why I  or anyone posting uploads may just say the helll with it,,, don't like it..... try your own self and Ki@@ my fat A@@ please....

About the sink issue it's a bug with halli's media splitter so use gabest's or media player classic built in mp4 splitter.
I had this problem but after enabling mpc's built in splitter the issue disappeared, if U have k-lite use k-lite's tweak tool and select gabest as a preferred splitter for mp4
This file is complete it ends well after the end credits it doesn't' contain all of the end credits tho.
There is no flickering in this release and crying about the frame rate for an mp4 file is bull, mp4 have support for variable frame rate this is not an avi file!

,Telordya,2010-02-26T18:39Z,"Awesome video and audio quality!! But why did you encode in 29.971 fps? If I play it frame by frame, I see duplicated frames. Isn't it a waste of space? Could you re-release it in a properly 23.976 fps (or 24.00 fps) and properly encoded synced audio?"

,ml01172,2010-03-18T02:14Z,"I don't know about you guys, you all seem to be happy with this torrent, but I downloaded it completely and all I can see is first 10-15 seconds of a movie that seems to be ""Be Kind Rewind"", but definitely not Avatar (beginning with something like: Now, everybody thinks that Harlem was the capitol of ...). The trailer seems great, but the file itself Avatar.mp4 plays as explained. Also, I tried jumping over the beginning with my MPlayer -sb option, to no avail. "
,RayaStarr,2010-03-19T20:19Z,Thanks for the hard work!
,ml01172,2010-03-20T14:38Z,"I am sorry to have said wrong in my previous post (above) saying how I couldn't play the movie. The truth is, I really couldn't, but now, for some reason, I tried playing it again (the very same file) and it plays perfectly. I don't know what happened, but I suppose there was a file-system screw-up I didn't know anything about. Unfortunately, just lust night I watched the movie in the available version, the bad, gray one, and now I just can't watch it again. Maybe some time later :)"
,hikki_man,2010-03-22T21:45Z,"Finally sorted out this FPS bullshit. Now it plays awesomely with MPC. Here is what you do:

* Download and install avisynth.

* Download the Decomb plugin from here: http://avisynth.org/warpenterprises/files/decomb522_25_dll_20050904.zip - extract contents to the plugins folder of avisynth (start menu > avisynth 2.5 > plugin directory)

* Create a new text file in the folder where you downloaded the movie, and name the file FixedAvatar.avs (make sure file extension is avs and not txt). In the file, enter the following:

LoadPlugin(""C:\Program Files\AviSynth 2.5\plugins\Decomb.dll"")
DirectShowSource(""Avatar.mp4"")
Decimate(5)

* In MPC, go to View>Options>Audio Switcher, and enable audio shift and set it to -1900 (not -2900 like have said). It's kinda tricky to enter a negative value, since the edit box won't accept the ""-"" key. You can type -1900 in notepad, copy it, and just paste it there.

* Open the avs file in MPC. Just open MPC and drop the avs on it.

* Enjoy the movie.

* All hail the hikki man

You can test that the extra every 5th frame is removed by pausing the video and pressing the right arrow to play frame by frame. If you do this with the original file, you'll see that every 5th frame is a copy of the 4th frame, causing the video to feel funny for the trained eye.
- Thanks to JPeterson for his enlightening remark."

,as14ever,2010-07-03T19:31Z,"Movie request to any one that can do it. I have a request for some very hard movies to find as mpeg4 BRRip H264 AAC3 in resolutions: 1280x544 or 1280x720 or even 1920x1080p

The Movies are: Appleseed 2004 
Tron 1982
Brazil 1985
Naked Lunch 1991
Conan the Barbarian 1982
Conan the Destroyer 1984
The Dark Crystal 1982
King Kong 1976
The Secret of NIMH 1982
Spike Lee School Daze 1988
Spike Lee Mo Better Blues 1990

If any one can find these movies in the format mentioned above, or can create them in the same quality as secret_myth I would be very appreciative and can maybe work on some type of compensation if needed.

Let me know at firstliight@yahoo.com "

,bobyboy484950,2010-11-06T11:55Z,thanks for the upload fantastic film
,xFaithx,2010-11-06T22:46Z,"There were a total of maybe 10 seconds where I experienced ""skipping"" with the movie. More of a slight lag in playback but thankfully those 2 instances of no more than 5 seconds each were in no way located inside of an important scene to the plot.

Overall I give this an easy V-10, A-10 and it is not only safe to download but I would HIGHLY recommend buying this film. I waited until this week to watch this movie and watched it online. After the first view I could not stop thinking about the movie so yesterday I came here and downloaded this excellent copy. I just wanted to come back and say thanks for the torrent. The movie was so great even after the 2nd viewing that I actually went out and bought the DVD.

Without offering up too many spoilers for those who have yet to see it the story alone is amazing. This movie, even with its excellent special effects and handling of the Uncanny Valley, would have been just as impressive had it been a radio program. That's how powerful the story is. Critics who claim that it was predictable, and admittedly some parts are, are crazy. When you flip a light switch you know the lights are going to come on but you still flip it anyway. In my most honest opinion there was no doubt that your main characters would survive but even I thought towards the end that Jake was going to fall and end up having a heroes burial.

I cut this here and again you should definitely give this a watch."
