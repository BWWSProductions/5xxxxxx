This is a rare find; Miccheal Beck usaully does the narrating for this tittle but this book was narrated by Alexander Adams. He has a wondeful voice for narrations allowing you to fall into the story.this book was also released in 1993 (audio version). the ones with Miccheal Beck were released later.

Clanton, Mississippi. The life of a 10-year-old black girl is shattered by 2 drunken and remorseless young men. The mostly white town reacts with shock and horror at the inhuman crime. Until her father acquires an assault riffle - and takes justice into his own outraged hands. For 10 days, with burning crosses and the crack of sniper fire spreading through the streets of Clanton, the nation sits spellbound as young defense attorney Jake Brigance struggles to save his client's life...and then his own...

  This book was a wonderful listen. I hope that today things are different.
