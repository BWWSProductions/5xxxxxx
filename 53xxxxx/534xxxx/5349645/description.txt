     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      With its 343 metre-tall pillars, the Millau Bridge linking
      the roads to Paris and Barcelona dwarfs the Eiffel Tower and is
      the tallest road bridge in the world. Undaunted, Richard scales
      this extraordinary structure to discover its engineering
      connections with nuclear submarines and ancient Celtic boats.
