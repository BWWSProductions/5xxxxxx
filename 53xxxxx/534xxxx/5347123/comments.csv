I wouldn't download this...if you are looking for Jackass, Wildboys or Viva La Bam...dont download from Kickfoot or this guy. Again same person. There are subtitles in THEIR language. "
,dj_nix_poliatevska,2011-04-09T11:47Z,Oh and yeah...Thanx for wasting me 4 hours on DLing this.
,0bb4,2011-08-31T18:48Z,dj_nix_poliatevska Can you read? It says SWESUB = Swedish Subtiles. Retard.
,Megadase,2012-05-02T23:48Z,"Hahah! I'm not KickFoot! I know him though and the fact that he encodes his ""DVDRips with previous dvdrips, which has shitty quality, i'm not a fan of his work. This is straight from my own purchased DVD collection."
