Set approximately 10 years after the events of the original Bioshock, the
halls of Rapture once again echo with sins of the past. Along the Atlantic
coastline, a monster has been snatching little girls and bringing them back
to the undersea city of Rapture. You are the very first Big Daddy as you
travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city, chasing an unseen foe
in search of answers and your own survival
