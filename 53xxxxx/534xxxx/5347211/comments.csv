,zetachi_swoon,2010-02-11T11:12Z,thanks!!! have been waiting for this one a long time now! any chance you could upload avi or other format? I've no idea how to work these files...
,NOFXsucka,2010-02-15T20:52Z,"@ zetachi_swoon; this is a packed file so u need to download the winrar program to unpack. will play in media player or whatever as long as you unpack it. 

Thanx for uploading .BONE."

,audiobully88,2011-03-18T12:51Z,If you actually have winrar and vlc player you dont have to unpack it first. You can play it directly in VLC it will unpack it at the same time niiicccce
