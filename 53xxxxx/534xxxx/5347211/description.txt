Plot: Unemployed Dave Peck (Samuel Johnson) still lives at home with his dad, Jim (Anthony LaPaglia) in an apartment block where his neighbours are a mixed bunch. Pensioner Albert (Barry Otto) is visited by what seems an angel, who in a previous life was a homeless man (Geoffrey Rush) and retired, broke magician Marcus Parcus (Roy Billing) is getting repossessed. Loser Ron (Joel Edgerton) is at odds with his girlfriend and keeps company with three miniature beer swilling students who live in his room. Daveâ€™s brother, Lenny (Ben Mendelsohn) is chasing supermodel Tanita (Leeanna Walsman) who likes her men hairlessly smooth.
