* STORY :

* Cursed Mountain is set in the late 1980s, due to the lack of technology available in the time period. The entire course of the 

game takes place on a mountain in the Himalayas named Chomolonzo, which the natives call "the Sacred One". The protagonist, Eric 

Simmons, is searching for his lost brother, Frank, who was hired by Edward Bennett to retrieve a sacred artifact called a terma. 

The goddess of the mountain became angry, and she bestowed a powerful curse upon Chomolonzo, trapping Frank and everyone who 

could not escape in time. The storyline of the game is heavily influenced by Buddhism and Tibetan folklore.
