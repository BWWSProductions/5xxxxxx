The story takes place in the year 2154 on Pandora, a lush, Earth-like moon of the planet Polyphemus[24] in the Alpha Centauri star system.[5] The RDA corporation is mining a valuable mineral called unobtanium. Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) heads the mining operation, which employs a private military. Pandora's atmosphere is toxic to humans, forcing them to use breathing masks.

Pandora is inhabited by the Na'vi, a ten-foot-tall blue-skinned species of sapient humanoids,[25] who live in harmony with nature, worshiping a mother goddess called Eywa. To facilitate relations with the Na'vi and research of Pandora's biosphere, scientists grow Na'vi-human hybrids called avatars, controllable via mental link by genetically matching humans.[26] Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic former Marine, replaces his twin brother, a scientist trained as an avatar operator but murdered in a robbery. Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement for his brother and assigns him as a bodyguard.......
