[color=Green][b]Joss Stone has some serious soul and anyone who disagrees with that fact is downright
crazy, or deaf, but probably just crazy. As clichÃ© as it sounds, Joss Stone literally could sing
the phone book and turn the tracks into a multi-platinum record. The young and extremely
talented British singer-songwriter has accomplished a lot in her young career; winning the
BBC television show Star For A Night, at the age of 14, two Brit awards and one Grammy
award, and selling over ten million albums worldwide.

Joss Stoneâ€™s latest effort, "Colour Me Free," according to Stone, was a spur of the moment
thing: â€œI kind of woke up one morning and wanted to make an album", she says. "It's very,
very raw. It's a bunch of musicians, writers and myself, and we're just jamming, basically."

The resulting product is a soul-tinged powerful set of tracks that display Joss Stoneâ€™s
virtuosity as a singer and her skill at song-writing. The opening track â€˜Freeâ€™ displays Joss
Stoneâ€™s assertive and daring attitude, â€œDonâ€™t tell me that I wonâ€™t, I willâ€¦Donâ€™t tell me cause I
know whatâ€™s real, what I can do.â€ The track â€˜Governmentalistâ€™ is a moody 70s R&B-like track
that rails on her disdain for the lack of progress and action by British Government, â€œHow
come we ain't getting any closer, trying to find the truth behind the lies?â€ â€˜Governmentalistâ€™
also features a lyrically moving guest performance by rap virtuoso Nas. â€˜Could Have Been
You,â€™ â€˜4 and 20,â€™ and â€˜Girlfriend On Demandâ€™ address relationship woes and downfalls with
Joss Stoneâ€™s trademark vocal confidence and lyrical certainty.

Overall, "Colour Me Free" is a great album. All of the tracks feature intelligent lyric writing
and of course Stoneâ€™s strong soulful voice. The woman hits every
note just right. However, the track â€˜You Got The Love,â€™ a gospel song about faith and
confidence in God seems to be a little out of place on an album filled mostly with either angst
ridden love songs or other more emotionally charged songs that are trying to make a point.

Joss Stoneâ€™s faithful fans will definitely be pleased with the singer-songwriterâ€™s latest effort.
Soul, Blues, and R&B fans who havenâ€™t given Stone much beyond a casual listen should
reinvest their ears to Joss Stone and "Colour Me Free." She is going places.[/b][/color]
