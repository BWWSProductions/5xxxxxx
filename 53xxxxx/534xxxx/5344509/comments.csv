,romio6996,2010-03-17T11:57Z,"Everything works! Thanks man, great work!
GTA 4life!"
,samahh,2010-04-18T07:01Z,"works great, i recommend this to anyone wanting to get the game. wherever you download this, there will be the all the necessary program files, as well as the .exe files as the uploader mentioned. ""Gta_sa.exe"" is single player, and ""samp.exe"" is multiplayer. finally, to use the user tracks for the radio, the folder will most likely be in your documents. it will be titled ""GTA San Andreas User Files"". inside that will be ""User Tracks"". just paste your music files in there. to get the radio to recognize them, you have to scan the files in your audio options in the game. then finally, change the playing type to ""random"" instead of ""radio"". overall, great game,  thank you."
,Whit3_Addict,2010-04-19T10:02Z,nice ty
,42Geek,2010-05-01T21:12Z,"Heh, very nice. The only problem that I've found (But is very fixable) is that you have to run it as an admin for most of the things to work. The controls are slightly awkward at first, but mess around with the settings a little bit, and you'll get it. Once you get all the graphics/control settings in order, this game is pretty fun. Thanks for the upload. :D"

,conqueror94,2010-05-05T15:01Z,"So far I've read the comments of other people I do really think it's a good torrent, and I'm almost convinced the game'll work. But I hope the downspeed is going to head for 1 mb/s i'm now downloading at alsmost 500 kb/s which is of course not very slow but ... Ok no more complaining, thanks for a (i hope) great torrent!"
,conqueror94,2010-05-06T16:36Z,"Well, my suspections haven't been wrong! A great game, although the Single player game works fine, the SAMP doesn't work for me. But besides that it's a great game and it even works fine on Windows 7. Oh, and the downspeed did head for 1 MB/s, even better I've reached 1,5 MB/s !!! Thanks seeders, i'm going to seed this torrent too!"

,yassineabd,2010-12-12T21:56Z,"Great game! thanks!
Only probleme for me is that with crack version you can't do moddeling, you can like a little but soon as you get like 10 changed cars its crashing.
if poeple just want to play at the normal game it is a niiiiice torrent but, for one's who would like to put some mods into it, you better get the real version. i have crack one and i had lost a lot of time trying to fix the game to work with mods."
