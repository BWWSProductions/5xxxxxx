This is the third of five DVD disks in the complete Season 5 of LOST. This is a DVD5 image, which was compiled by me from the original DVD9 version of the same disk. Enjoy and please let me know what you think.
 
Changes from original DVD9:
*ABC Logo and Warnings are removed
*All non-English audio tracks and subtitles are removed
*Spanish, German and Italian versions of the animated menu are omitted. Just select "English" when you start, it will work nicely.
*All video is slightly compressed to make it fit on a DVD5 disk

I will seed this torrent for as long as I can, but eventually I will be forced to burn it on a disk and remove it from my hard drive to make way for other great DVDs. Since then it will be totally up to people like you to continue to seed this torrent. Please, once you download it, seed it for at least several days - let other people download it.
