,GrrWolfe,2010-03-09T03:36Z,"Keygen is clean, software works.

Instructions for the keygen are as follows... (as seen on another goodsync torrent w/ the same keygen)

HERE IS HOW YOU ACTIVATE:
* Help Menu > Activate
* Select the SECOND option
* Enter in ANY username you like
* Enter in 222-333-444-222
* It then goes to the next screen
* Enter in any email address, any address, phone number etc
* Open the keygen and click Generate
* Paste in the code"

So far Avast and SuperAntiSpyware aren't finding anything with the installer and keygen, but prior to this it had been several weeks since I installed anything else that could have caused the infection so this seems like the likely culprit."
,nikrusty,2010-06-01T18:53Z,@GrrWolfe: Thank you. The silly torrent has no instructions in it. Strange!!
,nikrusty,2010-06-01T18:53Z,BTW...THIS WORKS 100% and 100% no infection. checked with Avira and Comodo AV

The codes it produces are fine though. Just be sure to run it in a sandbox."
