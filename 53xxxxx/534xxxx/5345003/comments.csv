,dannychris,2010-04-04T14:18Z,"Sade's sixth studio album Soldier of Love was released worldwide on 8 February 2010, their first album of new material in almost ten years.

Following the release of the Soldier of Love single on 8 December 2009, the track debuted at #11 on the Urban Hot AC chart, making it the highest debut of the decade and the third highest all-time on the Urban Hot AC chart. ""Soldier of Love"" also debuted at #5 on the Smooth Jazz airplay chart while also becoming the first ever vocal to hit #1 on the Smooth Jazz Top 20 Countdown.

Sade fans proved that the band's latest release Soldier of Love was long overdue, since, after moving 502,000 copies, the album topped the Billboard 200 chart during its debut week. The album is the band's first #1 album since the 1986 Promise which was #1 on the Billboard charts for two consecutive weeks. The group will release the second single from the album, ""Baby Father"", in April 2010, followed by a video in May.

The band performed the first single from their new album on UK's Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 26 February 2010.


NEWS: the group will release their 2nd single from the new album called ""BabyFather"" in April, and release a brand new video for the song due out sometime in May 2010.
