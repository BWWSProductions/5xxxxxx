Info on the game if you don't know:

"Set in the future, you are invited to join an open-ended social, economic and political action-adventure as a human colonist 
on a distant alien planet. Choose from over 200 tradeable skills, follow your own destiny and write a unique story with 
others from around the world.

You will enter a new chapter in Calypsoâ€™s story. After an exhausting five year conflict with an invading robot enemy, the long 
awaited promise of peace and prosperity on Calypso remains elusive. With the robots repelled to their home world Akbal-Cimi, 
cracks in colonist solidarity are emerging. The war-time economy has produced industrialists with the resources to buy up 
Calypsoâ€™s precious land, while disgruntled ex-soldiers are left to wander Calypso, hunting and mining for their survival. You 
will land on a Calypso with revolution and civil war in the air.
 
Have you got what it takes to stake a claim on Calypso?"
