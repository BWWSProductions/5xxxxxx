Bio: When you combine Ribkat (Fort Minor, Styles of Beyond) with a classy, vibrant Puerto Rican girl named Josy B, an unimaginable twosome combining 90s hip-hop with 80s electronica emerges. With a placement in the Oscar nominated movie The Wrestler, a 2008 Hollywood Music Award nomination and an Effigy Award for best Hip Hop song in 2009 under their belts, this duo has arrived to color in the shades of grey in what we call the music world today.

Ribkat and Josy B. have been surrounded by singing, dancing, producing, and performing throughout their lives. Ribkatâ€™s brother "Bilal" produced for Ice-T, House Of Pain and Cypress Hill to name a few, while Josy B. spent the majority of her life singing and performing. Adding to their accolades, Ribkat and Josy B. have licensed music to MTV, NBC, and USA as well as shared the stage with some of musicâ€™s most accredited artists.
