i'll seed this torrent for as long as possible, and those who finish dling it should do the same. This is the blender logic bricks tutorial from Cartoon Smart's courses on blender 3d & the only cartoon smart torrent animator815 was missing, so to all who were finding themselves dling this off of MU or RS, here it is in pure torrent quality thanks
