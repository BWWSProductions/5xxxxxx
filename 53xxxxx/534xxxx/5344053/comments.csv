Notice Date: 17 Mar 2010 18:47:03 GMT


Dear Sir or Madam:

TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX FILM CORPORATION and its affiliated companies (collectively, ""Fox"") own intellectual property rights, including exclusive rights protected under copyright law, in many motion pictures, television programs and other audiovisual works (collectively, the Fox Titles).  We believe that your AT&T Internet account is being used to reproduce and/or distribute copies of one or more Fox Titles on the Internet, in violation of Fox's legal rights. We have set forth at the close of this letter the details concerning this infringement, including the title(s) of the Fox Title(s) in question, the IP address of your account at the time of the infringement, and the date and time of the infringement. The documentation included at the end of this notice specifies the location of the infringement.  The audiovisual works being offered through your Internet account include the following:

Title:  Avatar DVD Screener


The copying and/or distribution of copies of copyrighted audiovisual works without the authorization of the copyright owner constitutes copyright infringement under the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §§ 106, 501. This conduct may subject you to significant liability, including statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work for willful infringement. Under certain circumstances, copyright infringement can give rise to federal criminal liability, with penalties as high as five years imprisonment plus a $250,000 fine. (See 17 U.S.C. § 506; 18 U.S.C. § 2319.) "
,ch3mw4r,2010-03-18T16:36Z,"and this was the section of at&t's useless banter. 
We recently received the attached notice from 20th Century Fox claiming that your Internet account may have been used for copyright infringement. Specifically, 20th Century Fox claims that your account was used to reproduce and/or distribute copyrighted content without authorization to other users of an Internet-based file-sharing network. We are forwarding this notice at the request of 20th Century Fox -- please see the enclosed document.

Content providers such as 20th Century Fox routinely monitor file-sharing networks to determine if their copyrighted movies and music are being distributed illegally over the Internet. 20th Century Fox identified your AT&T account by its numeric IP address, a string of numbers identifiable by any site from which you upload or download files. When an Internet user connects to file-sharing networks, the IP address assigned to the computer connected to the Internet becomes publicly available to other members of the network. Consistent with our Customer Privacy Policy, AT&T has not released your name or any other personal information to 20th Century Fox, but is forwarding this notice to you so that this issue may be resolved without any further action.

You should be aware that copyright infringement is a violation of U.S. law, and potentially punishable by fines and other criminal penalties. It also is a violation of the AT&T Acceptable Use Policy, which governs your use of AT&T Internet services. If infringing activity persists, 20th Century Fox may choose to seek a court order requiring AT&T to provide it with your name and address so it can pursue legal action against you.

By forwarding this complaint, AT&T is not making any accusation of wrongdoing. Rather, we are bringing 20th Century Fox's notice to your attention so that you can take prompt and appropriate steps to prevent any further activity of this nature from occurring over your Internet account. Steps you may consider taking include:

Ceasing any sharing of copyrighted content that might be occurring via file sharing software, services or networks;
Securing your home Wi-Fi network to ensure others are not accessing the Internet through your connection to download or distribute illegal content;
Talking with family members or guests who may have used your Internet connection in ways you are not aware of;
Using virus and spyware protection software to protect against security threats and ensure your Internet connection is not being used in ways that you have not authorized;
Learning how federal copyright law applies to online activities by visiting the U.S. Copyright Office's website at http://www.copyright.gov/.
Violations of the Acceptable Use Policy can result in termination of your AT&T service. We encourage you to review the AT&T Acceptable Use Policy online at http://www.corp.att.com/aup/ and the AT&T Customer Privacy Policy at http://www.att.com/privacy.

AT&T is committed to protecting your personal information and ensuring the best possible online experience for all customers. Please review the attached letter for information regarding the alleged copyright infringement. If you have any questions regarding your AT&T Internet account or AT&T policies, please call us at 1-866-618-7991 or email us at complaintresponse@abuse-att.net."
