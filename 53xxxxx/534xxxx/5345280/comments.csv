,Lonepup,2010-02-09T08:39Z,"This was ABSOLUTELY the best download of my life here on TPB!!  I watched the game yesterday live, but with all the commercials and half time bullshit, I kept getting lost on what was going on.

This share, was all commercial free.  I burned both .avi files into 2 DVD movies.

So the day after the game, now I a true sense of how the ""Who Dat"" kicked ass... 

I can only say, the Video/audio quality when I burned into a DVD movie kicked ass... It was DVD quality.

eztv... you're frickin' awesome! =)"
,bERTUZ_69,2010-02-09T19:50Z,"great in .avi =)
