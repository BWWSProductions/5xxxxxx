,rippervanwinkle,2010-03-23T02:13Z,"Flawless video quality, perfect AR, no black bars, high quality x264 options used. Perfect. AAC instead of AC-3? I guess we have to get used to it.....

Thanks, excellent release. "
,rippervanwinkle,2010-03-28T23:28Z,"OK ""flawless quality""... I was wrong, having only watched the short sample.  In fact I think it's the most over-sharpened movie I've ever seen.  I know lots of bu-ray movies are over-sharpened (as the studios want to scream *HD!!!* right at you and constantly in case you forgot) so maybe the fault lies with the studio not the releaser....but in this case it's beyond ridiculous.  Even standing up close to someone old and wrinkly and using a magnifying glass you'd not see so many skin pores or crevices. Edge effect overkill to the max. "
