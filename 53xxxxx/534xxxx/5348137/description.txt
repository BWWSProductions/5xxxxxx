    As a partner in the British Empire, Scotland began the     
    20th century with an advanced economy and a               
    world-beating heavy industry. But in the closing         
    decades its sense of Britishness was in doubt and a       
    Scottish Parliament sat in Edinburgh for the first time    
    since 1707. Charting Scotland's darkest century, Neil     
    Oliver discovers a country driven to self-determination  
    through a series of economic crises so deep that her      
    most striking export became her own disillusioned          
    population.
