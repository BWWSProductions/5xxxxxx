Tonio K at his most approachable.  This album is about relationships.  Tonio K looks at the world with the eye of a cynic and the heart of a true-believer. The humor is there, while lampooning society ("Romeo Loves Jane" and "True Confessions" and both great blasts), but the stark beauty of "You Will Go Free" and the heart-wrenching "Perfect World" ("Cause I never had to walk away from anybody I wanted as much as I wanted you") show his heart is in control.
