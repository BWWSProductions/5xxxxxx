,Espionage724,2012-04-09T05:05Z,"This is Musou Orochi Z, a combination of Warriors Orochi 1 and 2 with additional stages I believe and characters.

You mount OROCHIZTCINSTALL.iso and during the install, some message will appear about halfway, in which case you mount NS-OROCHIZTCGAME.iso and continue on.

Crack is on first disk."
