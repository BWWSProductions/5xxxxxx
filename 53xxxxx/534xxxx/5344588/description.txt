               Redman team up in this outrageous hit that

                 Silas (Method Man) and Jamal (Redman) are         
                 slackers with a talent for botany ( and           
                booty) and a knack for staying far away           
                from school. Against all odds, both ace a          
               college entrance exam and end up being             
               accepted to Harvard, where they turn the           
                school upside down in their pursuit of             
                parties, honeys and outrageous hijinks!
