I think it's actually against the law to copyright religious doctrine.
Also , I don't see why any nut job would want the bible copyrighted ."
,OogaChaka,2010-06-14T05:05Z,"Everyone should read the Bible... it is the surest course to atheism.

""It ain't the parts of the Bible that I can't understand that bother me, it is the parts that I do understand."" - Mark Twain

""No man ever believes that the Bible means what it says; he is always convinced that it says what he means."" - George Bernard Shaw

""When I think of all the harm the Bible has done, I despair of ever writing anything equal to it."" - Oscar Wilde"
,randypostal,2010-06-27T04:20Z,"OogaChaka, you are correct, everyone should read the Bible. But to say there is no God is quite ridiculous. If there was no God, then why do people born on the same day of the year have the same personality traits? And if all life on earth evolved from single celled organisms, then where did the first cingle celled organisms come from? Did they just magically appear into existence with individual consciousnesses? There is a reason why the Bible is the #1 best selling book of all time. God is very alive and real, but unless you call out to him and ask him to be in your life, you will never know him. Finding him is the reason we were put here on this earth. That's why we were given the gift of free will. This ""life"" is just a test to see if we will choose his love and salvation, or with material obsessions that will do us no good after we die. The choice is yours. He is real, and he can be everything you need him to be. All you have to do is ask. His love is paralleled by no other, and he holds the keys to everlasting life. ""Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you."" Matthew 7:7"
,flittydub,2010-08-06T06:16Z,"When I see all these negative comments it makes me realize how powerful God's word is, the comments are testaments that you all believe in God's existence because your reaction to Him is so strong... you know He exists... you know He is real... just accept & receive His love! Forget about how Christians have misrepresented Him in your lives & just take the time to get to know Him on a personal relationship level... talk to Him, listen to Him, learn about His ways & your life will be so enriched from now until eternity... God bless!"

man kind created religions, it started 10s of thousand years ago, as we developed we find answers to our questions, and solutions to our problems. the one who gave the best answer about our physical needs became chief of the village whistle the answer given for the uncontroled events became the villages witches.
basically the hunter who provided most food and better shelter will become more powerful and became the cheif. the ones who was completly loopy and give answer about what nobody knew (not even themselves) became the village witches.

these two formes of power have struggled and fighted along for as long as we remember, sometime both power were united under one governing body, but most of the time they were fighing for more power. 

this hasn't change much today, only the medias have became the third form power.

So clearly religions are human made, and ""to beleive"" has become part of the human psyche for the large majority of us. The few who trully do not rely on spiritual beleive could be divided in two kind.
1)the one who beleive in humanty and life as a whole, and trust humanity to overcome it's struggles, they generaly are very peaceful and willing to help for a better world. 

2) the one who beleive in nothing at all and they are the one who uses people needing to beleive in a spiritual world(religions) to manipulate them to acheive they personal goals. they are politicians, prophetes, rullers, corporation directors, they go to chuch mosque temple or synagogues, not to prey but to exploit other people beleives.

,Torrent_Pimp,2011-04-02T03:19Z,"Does anyone have a Non Dramatized version with stephen johnson???

I love Stephen Johnson but I can only find the dramatized version?"
,bb1net,2011-04-07T17:21Z,"Thank you very much for this high quality dramatized Bible!  I noticed the source CD skipped during Numbers 7.  I am only at Numbers 14 as of now, so it may have skipped in other places as well.  Other than that small glitch, this is an excellent quality version.

To anyone considering this download, please do it!  Listen to this excellent reading of God's word!  The best source for knowledge about God is not another man (excepting prophets) but God's written word.  

Open your heart and ask God to open His truth to you and he will.  You don't have to go through this life alone.  Pray to the Father in the name Jesus and he will enlighten your mind, show you the way, and sing comfort to your soul.  Do you this for yourself, and when you know the truth, spread The Word."
