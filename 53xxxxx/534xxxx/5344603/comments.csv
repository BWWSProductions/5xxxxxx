and wonder why you don't have a skull yet.
I'm sure you deserve one.
I havn't had the pleasure of downloading any of your files yet, but keep up the good work, I'll get 
around to you soon."

I found it funny, and reminded me of one of those flicks you'd watch as you're on the verge of yarfing up the night's 12 beers like when you are totally wrecked and stupid and your ears are ringing!!"
