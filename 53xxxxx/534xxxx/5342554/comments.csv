,erikphnx,2010-02-07T17:39Z,Thanks looking forwards to checking this one out. I do not remember the name but I know I have seen that cover before. Will be curious to see if I recognize a song after hearing it.

,blashey,2010-02-09T01:39Z,you put up recently annabel lambs album thanks but was riders on the storm missing from it ? i miss not having that track
,blashey,2010-02-09T01:40Z,anyone know the best usb turntable to get so i can transfer my vinyl ?????
,fanciz,2010-02-18T17:39Z,"What a coincidence! I'm planning to buy the Denon DP-200USB. I wouldn't say that it's the best but ...... it's available over here! Ahahahah I left my Technics on the other side of the ocean and getting it back would be difficult, besides, it didn't have the USB feature.

Ps. Thanx 80zforever for all those uploads"

80z Forever and His faithful Following...

I have literally spent DAYS downloading and discovering everything this kick-ass dude has put together. It was SO worth it. Obscure 80's shit from all over the world; digitized, organized and ready for dowload. What dedication.

80z - thanks for your love of the genre and your desire to not let these artists die ignored. You should be sainted.

Now, if you don't mind some self-promotion - I've just put up my first bittorent - if you're into hard rock/electro (rob zombie, rammstein, the prodigy) check these guys out...

And thanks again 80z Forever....
