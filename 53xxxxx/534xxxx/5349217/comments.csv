[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-02-09T20:15Z,"Video Quality 10/10   Audio Quality 5-6 maybe 7/10 (because it's CAM Audio). You can totally understand what they are saying! Perfectly In Sync! ""Best release so far easily watchable!"" I Loved It! Good Quality! But, I must say that I can't wait for LINE Audio! Thanks BONE! Thanks RamPeD! Thanks TA! Thanks whoever for the CHINESE source! Thanks SCENE! And last of all but not least THANKS TPB!  To all, Enjoy the great movie!
