Jussi BjÃ¶rling - Scandinavian Songs+Ballads (Gala)[OGG][twistle]

Jussi Bjorling (1911-1960) : Arguably the finest tenor of the twentieth century.  More info here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_BjÃ¶rling

Only a few tracks rise above generic compositions (although absolutely beautifully sung in their own right - more colour squashed in here than one would get within the mainstream Operatic repertoire), thus most of this CD is of less interest for the music itself than the fact that it contains recordings from the entirety of BjÃ¶rling's career, from a concert given in 1929 (aged 18) onwards, with the associated changes in voice, recording quality and performance style.  In that regard, it is extremely interesting listening ... 

... but if you're considering downloading this as you've been looking for a CD of Opera stuff 'coz you heard that "Nessun Dorma" thing someplace and liked it, look elsewhere! :)

Tagged "Opera" on account of the style of voice, rather than any of these tracks coming from an actual Opera.
