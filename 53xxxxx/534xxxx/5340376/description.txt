From wikipedia:

Pidgin (formerly named Gaim) is a multi-platform instant messaging client, based on a library named libpurple. Libpurple has support for many commonly used instant messaging protocols, allowing the user to log into various different services from one application.

The number of Pidgin users was estimated to be over 3 million in 2007.[1] Both Pidgin and libpurple are free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
