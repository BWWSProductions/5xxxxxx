,Deus3xMachina,2010-02-13T03:16Z,"malestrom is a complete gentleman, he never ever does anything bad to his PDF's.  BTW, Malestrom, about six months ago I asked for some lancet magazines and you completely delivered, thankyou very much, although I still seem to be unable to get into study medicine, they made my interview go less poorly than it might have.  Do you think you could possibly keep on updating with new lancets or BMA's (or both, but that might just be greedy on my part).  The Lancet neurology supplement is especially interesting.  Oh I have also worked out your identity, I believe you to work at a university library which archives magazines and journals."
,Deus3xMachina,2010-02-13T03:17Z,"Sorry I did not thank you earlier by the way, for some reason none of the password reminder emails made it to my hotmail account, I have no idea why."
