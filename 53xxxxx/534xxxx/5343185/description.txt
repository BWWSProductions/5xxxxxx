Dreamgale is a combination of musical styles. The musicians themselves define the style as dreampop. In practice it currently means conceptual electro pop music with clear influences from heavy rock and new age.

Influenced by different types and styles of artistic expression, the band is eager to try out new artistic territories, experiment with and combine elements of different musical genres. According to Per Adebratt, one of the biggest producers in the Swedish music business, a man who tailored a long list of gold and platinum productions for international stars like Ace of Base, Dr Alban, The Corrs, Army of Lovers, Lutricia McNeal and others, with the musical scale, affluence and comprehension of Dreamgale, the room for this kind of experiment is limited by imagination alone.
