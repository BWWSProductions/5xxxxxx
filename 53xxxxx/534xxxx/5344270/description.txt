Okay, to be honest, this isn't Creative Commons. But this is the mp3 Version, and it's freely available on http://error-broadcast.com/index.php/catalog/show/release/ebc004 . I asked one of the founders of the label and he told me I could publish it on Bittorrent, so seeding still is no copyright infringement.

Tracklist:
1. Cartoon Friend
2. Quartz Boy
3. Cybernator
4. Boss Worm

So, please seed!
