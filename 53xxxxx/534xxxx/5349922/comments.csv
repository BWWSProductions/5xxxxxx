,lilars26,2010-02-11T21:55Z,"Boy,these identity thief spammers are gettig pretty creative.Be very careful of these people.It's kinda funny how they rate a torrent that they haven't downloaded and then they offer you an alternative that does not exist.Download what you came here for and stay  far away from these assholes.And SEED at least what you take."

has a blurred mark at the bottom, which is tolerable.

the sickening thing is the occasional 'imagine' thats embedded into the sound.  seriously, what the ****."
,BimBom,2010-04-24T20:37Z,"
""A:4"" ??? This must mean a TOTALLY useless audio. Is this even a DVD rip? 

Sorry but what does M stand for? V for video A for audio, M for what?  "
,jox74,2010-04-28T03:25Z,"extremezone, where the fuck do u get off being such an ass, is it really that much better to get all these seeds but be completely illegitimate? IF ITS NOT A FUCKING DVD RIP DONT LABEL IT THAT WAY, your spamming this amazing site with your trash lies. Its time to grow up and tell the truth, your not a child (or maybe you are). Your lucky people dont read comments all the time because thats the only reason they dl your shit. i mean really the crazies is still in theaters in some places, dvd rip my ass! So have a great day and go fuck yourself! "
