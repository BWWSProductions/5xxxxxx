[V],joshua13,2010-12-24T05:14Z,"Anti-semitic racist propaganda and lies about the ridiculous idea of  a ""vast jewish conspiracy"" . Filled with hate speech about Jews. Incredible ridiculous hateful ideas Also takes a big swipe at asians because apparently one of the reasons to hate Jews according to this book is that they are asiatics. Blacks don't rate highly with him either though little is said on this. The author is clearly a white supremacist though.

the author claims he does not necessarily endorse all the ideas in the many people he quotes (some falsely and libelously). Probably that is true in some cases, but the message of the book is clear in the quotes as well as his own words. He does not quote al that hate for ""historical interest""

I am a christian not a jew if that matters to anyone. "
