IMAGiNE NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

First off thanks to Diamond a true HO ,for the dvdr.

Now yes this is the same source as the ones that are out labelled dvdscr and dvdrip.....all come from this source.

Have gone with tagging it a dvdscr as the video needed alot of work done to it,so i say it more of a screener.

Anyway with the dvdr you also got a sweet AC3 5.1 audio track so we opted for a 1.4gig release so we could keep the original audio as well as getting a decent bitrate for the video.

Enjoy this sick film :)
