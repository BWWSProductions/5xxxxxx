ROMEO ET JULIETTE
Charles - Francois Gounod (1818-1893)

Sir Charles Mackerras teases the romantic beauty from Gounod's score, which has been much admired and performed since its first performance, at the Theatre Lyrique, Paris, in 1867. In this 1994 recording, the youthful Roberto Alagna as Romeo, and Leontina Vaduva as the unattainable Juliette, lead an excellent cast in a touching portrayal of this story of impossible love, based on the play by William Shakespeare.
