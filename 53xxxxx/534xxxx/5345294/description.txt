Wesker's own summary:
Mattie Beancourt, a 61 year old woman, reads the autobiography of
Mark Gorman, a famous painter. Having grown up in the same East End
streets she writes to him. A correspondence develops. She visits
him unannounced, and discovers he lives in near poverty and neglect. 

Their impact upon each other is startling.
