Where It All Begins is a 1994 studio album by The Allman Brothers Band. "No One to Run With" obtained the greatest amount of album-oriented rock airplay; "Soulshine", written by Warren Haynes, also became a hit, as did the lengthy title cut. Gregg Allman also started to confront his substance abuse problems in the past on songs such as "All Night Train". This sold considerably better than its predecessor, Shades of Two Worlds. In 1998, the album went Gold. Nevertheless, critical reception was weaker. This was also the last studio album the group recorded with original second guitarist Dickey Betts.
