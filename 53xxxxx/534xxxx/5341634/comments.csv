,fanman93,2011-03-03T01:59Z,"Well, you could always try redownloading. I don't have an MD5 readily available, but I'll post one later."
,MellowStar,2011-03-14T09:39Z,"Sorry, waited a long time for the download to finish and when it did, found out the .zip file is corrupt. Perhaps you can repair the problem?"
,Keithuk,2011-03-20T02:32Z,Doesn't work the zip is corrupt.
,fanman93,2011-06-03T00:55Z,"For the lack of actually being able to find the files, this torrent should be inactive."
,orbus2,2011-06-18T06:13Z,"Works perfectly. It's just WinZip that claims it's corrupted. Open with WinRAR, no problems."
