Another project realised with the worlds easiest music software package and a lot of sample gathering activity. 

The Toy Shop set this one up to keep the creative juices flowing when everything Click Click came to a temporary standstill. The Toy Shop is a project where everything that makes a noise becomes music and everything that is music becomes a noise. Although the majority of the music is instrumental in nature, several "guest vocalists" appear throughout the catalogue. These are "found" vocalists whose original utterings had nothing to do with music whatsoever.
