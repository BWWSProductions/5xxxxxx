Filmed in 1973, one year after the blockbuster hit "The Devil In Miss Jones", this film spotlights the tremendous talents, acting as well as sexual, of the legendary Georgina Spelvin. Miss Spelvin is enlisted by 3 young roommates to make a porno to help raise rent money and stave of the attentions of their lecherous landlord who is becoming more and more sexually demanding. Cindy West and Darby Lloyd Rains begin their casting by interviewing Mark "10 1/2" Stevens who earns a role in their film after they measure his rock-hard equipment. Georgina performs with legendary skillfulness as she engages Darby in a hot and sticky, lesbian love fest and later in the film propels an intense three-way with Marc and Jeffrey. The last scene is a torrid threesome involving Darby, Jeffery and Linda Terry that will blow your socks off! The three young ladies, headed by the insatiable Darby, do a remarkable job of acting along side such a gifted, au-natural actress as Georgina Spelvin. The above par sex and natural bodies, as in most golden age adult films, retains the familiar air of believability that endears its fans to this particular era of adult film
