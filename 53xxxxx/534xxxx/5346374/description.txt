BBC R4 - Gerald Durrell's 'My Family And Other Animals'
Adapted by Janys Chambers
Music by James Mackie
Directed by Polly Thomas
Broadcast July 7 & 8, 2001
Coded from tape at 128/44.1

Gerald Durrell [1925-1995] founded the Durrell
Wildlife Conservation Trust & the Jersey Zoo.
His brother was/is novelist Lawrence Durrell.

In 1935 the eccentric Durrell family moved from
South London to Corfu. This play shows his family's
life there, and Gerald's early researches into the
natural world.

The Lawrence shown here is not the brooding man of
'The Alexandria Quartet'. Gerald said of Lawrence:

'The difference between us is that he loves writing
and I don't. To me it's simply a way to make money
which enables me to do my animal work, nothing more.'

You wouldn't know it from the quality of his prose.
