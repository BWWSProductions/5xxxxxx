Plot:
Nerdy college student Columbus has survived the plague that has turned mandkind into flesh-devouring zombies because he's scared of just about everything. Gun-toting, Twinkie-loving Tallahassee has no fears. Together, they are about to stare down their most horrifying challenge yet: each other's company. Emma Stone and Abigail Brenslin co-star in this double-hitting, head-smashing comedy.
