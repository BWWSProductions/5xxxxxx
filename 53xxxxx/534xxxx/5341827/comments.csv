My bad, first torrent. I'll post the next movie in the Movies DVDR section, but it's not that big of a deal."
,beta99,2010-02-07T23:51Z,"Though this is big..  and not in MKV  but in VOB file format..    Does it have ANYTHING stripped out?
"
,BIGD856,2010-02-08T04:26Z,"@beta99

No, it's a FULL dvdrip."
,BIGD856,2010-02-09T20:57Z,"It's a FULL dvd rip.
Same exact thing as the DVD.

NTSC, Audio/Subtitles: English or French, Menu, Special features include deleted scenes and extras. anything else, feel free to ask."
,Hanger84,2010-03-07T18:37Z,"Awesome job. Thanks for the upload. 

Don't let unappreciative pricks deter you, it's hard to find good DVD-R upload without everything ripped out of it. 

Keep up the good work."
,Diceroller,2010-03-12T10:38Z,"I agree with Hanger. If cheap fuckers don't have DVD+DLs, it's easy enough to compress this down to fit on a DVD+R after downloading. so they shouldn't complain. Good torrent. I look forward to watching this."
,bertvid,2010-03-29T20:29Z,Always best when it's a full DVD upload. Nice!! :-)
