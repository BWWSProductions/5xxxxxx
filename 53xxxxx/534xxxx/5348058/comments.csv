2nafish, if you have it, please upload all the videos except ""When I See You Smile""!

It's a pity that there is no videos for the best tracks from 1989 Bad English's album - ""Posession"" and ""Ghost In Your Heart"".
Well, will make them ourselves then! Someday )))"
,kvestantin,2010-02-09T21:29Z,"2nafish, by the way... Do you have Giant ""I'll See You In My Dreams""?"
,Flyfisher61,2010-02-09T22:46Z,Thanks!
[V],2nafish,2010-02-10T11:04Z,"I don't have the Bad English video collection but I do have Bad English - Forget Me Not video with no logos or titles and I think somewhere I have a VH1 Classic version too. I'll upload the no logos or titles video tonight or tomorrow because I don't have to search for it like I would for the VH1 Classic version.

I have the Giant video but unfortunately like the Nancy Wilson video you requested it's not very good quality.  "
,kvestantin,2010-02-10T22:53Z,"2nafish, you know, even though the quality as you say is not very good, to look at the versions you have (I am talking about both Nancy Wilson and Giant videos) would be interesting. But I do not insist of course ))"
[V],2nafish,2010-02-11T12:19Z,"After viewing both the Giant video and the Nancy Wilson video and 15 other videos from the same 2 VHS tapes that I ripped, I deleted them all because the quality was so bad. Those were done with the slowest record speed and weren't worth uploading or keeping.  "
,kvestantin,2010-02-11T20:30Z,"2nafish, you're killing me saying that you have deleted these PIECES OF ART!!! ...even though they were not in appropriate quality... For me personally it's better to have the things I like in any quality as a demo than not to have them at all ))"
[V],2nafish,2010-02-12T05:57Z,It's a very easy decision to delete the videos when the picture and audio have tons of drop-outs and the titles are so blurry you can barely read them. Nancy Wilson didn't look like Nancy Wilson.
,kvestantin,2010-02-12T21:00Z,"2nafish )))))))
if it is so, you were 100% right to decide to delete. when you're watching Nancy Wilson, it's a shame, really, not to see how cool (well, or beautiful) she is )) "
