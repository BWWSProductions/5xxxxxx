Just say NO to religion.

End superstition. 
Embrace rationalism. 
Develop and exercise critical thinking skills.
Throw your ""sacred"" texts on a bonfire... save just enough copies for the museums. "

I have to agree with you on the lack of critical thinking skills the world would be a better place with more critical thinking"
