[V],RiddlerA,2010-03-03T14:48Z,"@ Above

All the episodes of this Torrent are dvdrips"
,coldliondog,2010-04-26T21:20Z,"Thanks a lot for uploading . Can't wait for season 3 and 4 .

I like your style . Please write a tutorial about your converting process . What software you use to convert ? Please write it with details .

I am tired of big video files . No more big files ."
[V],RiddlerA,2010-04-27T15:36Z,"@ above 

You will need to download ""VSO ConvertXtoDVD ( download the latest version from Google)


CONFIGURING THE SOFTWARE:

-Go to ""Settings"" and then ""General"". Select the folder you want the temp files to be in (make sure the partition has plenty of space). Check the remaining 4 options depending on your preference.

-Move on to ""Chapters"". 5 Mins is a decent length, but you can change it if you like. Uncheck ""for videos longer than"".

-Next, ""TV Format"". Select your TV format annd leave the rest as it is.

-Now go on to ""Encoding"". Leave encoding quality on High. Select the type of disk you will be using, for the last one it is best to leave it as it is.

-Now for the ""Audio"". I would prefer having the bar somewhere in the middle, don't check ""Audio Boost"".

-Finally the ""Burning"". Uncheck the third opption. For the speed I'd select somewhere from 8x - 12x. Remember, the slower the better and never use the max speed.

....and you're done."
