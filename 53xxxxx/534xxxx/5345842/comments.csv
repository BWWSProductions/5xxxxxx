,koko-goal,2010-02-09T19:08Z,"afgaviria, if your PS2 is hardmodded why you would care about it?

and you can find one, i'm sure the game is not that old"
,afgaviria,2010-02-10T05:45Z,"i found one but is in pal, and no all the TVS in my house can ""handle"" 50 hrz (pal), and if i patch it  the screen ratio turns out weird."
[T],thenoobish,2010-02-11T15:56Z,correct me if im wrong but isnt it the scartcable that does ntsc and pal games work with colour?
,RDCMrT,2010-02-11T17:26Z,No it isn't it has to do with the type of coding of the game (files)
,koko-goal,2010-02-12T00:21Z,"bro, we are stuck at 96.8% :("

,mathias921,2010-10-01T17:48Z,"@koko-goal

No, you're not seeding! Greedy fool!"
,JRJ-000,2011-07-30T04:30Z,This was the first video game i played and loved it. Do i need to buy a PS or can i use an emulator?    THANKS RDCMRt
,RDCMrT,2011-10-27T16:20Z,"@JRJ-000, you can use it on both.
1. A modded PS1 and then burn the image on DVD.
or
2. Use an emulator and just mount the image."
