,danbye79,2010-02-08T12:50Z,2040: can you upload the edge of darkness 1986 mini series please.
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-08T13:43Z,"@danbye79: It is extremely old series. I found one archive, but on some very slow server.
BUT, I must see the quality and if I can use it as input. It will take few days.

Also, out there is private-tracker-torrent for DVDrip  available. It is 2.3 something Giga, and if you have no worries about traffic you can download it from there. Actually, you would done favor to yourself and to me, because I'm on pretty slow connection and I will avoid upload if it turns to be over 1.18 GB.

Let me know."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-08T13:53Z,"@Mary: Thanks. Ep. 5 goes 1 hour from now. Be here, 'cause old episodes tends to die quickly.

Regarding RSS, I don't use that, but uTorrent have capability to automatically load (and download) chosen torrent from specific address. Some people use that method for  my torrents."
,danbye79,2010-02-08T14:18Z,"its a classic ,the edge of darkness movie with mel gibson is a remake of the series ,,if its not to much trouble could you please do one for me ,thanks."
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-08T14:40Z,"@danbye79: I know, in fact I am old enough to have memories from that time. OK, you should wait till this Sunday. I am not sure about episode-by-episode or all 6 episodes at once.

 But be here, I have bad experiences with people's requests and later doesn't pick up the goods. You know the rule of ""honest seeding"" 48h after each request?"
