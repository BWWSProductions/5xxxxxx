,kalledy,2010-02-08T07:16Z,"worst show ever. crappy actors and crappy computer animations. They try to be Gladiator, 300 and Rome all at one time. 

But hey.. just my opinion"
,ragnarqk,2010-02-08T10:47Z,"look at the first screenshot in the preview sheet... it's not only the same actor, but the same shot and same background as that scene in 300. look at it, you know which one i'm talking about.

thanks for the up though, this show is alright"
,negburn,2010-02-08T12:46Z,THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!
,Eth1c,2010-02-08T18:11Z,"The feel of this show personally is different than 300 or Gladiator as I've already watched the first to, I feel you guys are just pessimistic people looking for a thread to troll... This add's onto the lack of gladiator shows, I'm glad they are shooting this.
