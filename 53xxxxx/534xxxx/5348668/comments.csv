,danoone,2010-02-14T18:16Z,thanks. it works for BioShock_2-Razor1911-[tracker.BTARENA.org].iso 
,n3xion,2010-02-15T20:41Z,"Ehm, before this patch it didn't do anything. Now I can play, but I can't save since GamesFWL is asking for my cd key for Bioshock. How do I fix this?"
,micnor14,2010-02-20T01:42Z,"n3xion: simply go to ""create new profile"" in the GFWL dashboard in game, but instead of agreeing to the rights for joining LIVE, read along and you'll see a link to ""create offline profile"". This is how it should be done for most (not-un-pirated) Games for Windows Live.  eg- Grand Theft Auto 4. "
,The_Holy_Thrasher,2010-02-21T22:14Z,"Hey, guys I've downloaded and installed Bioshock from here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5347317/BioShock_2_%5BPC___ENG_ITA_DEU%5D%5BRazor1991%5D and then use crack from this torrent. Game launched ok, but when I'm starting Single Player, after 1st level is loaded and ""Press spacebar"" sign is appearing, I'm pressing it and game crashes... 

What can you tell 'bout this?"
,The_Holy_Thrasher,2010-02-21T23:27Z,"Oh, it's ok now - it's just me. ;-) Enjoy the game!"
,abandin,2010-03-15T03:24Z,"Hello, I am from Brazil and I need some help! I CANT SAVE! When the game starts at the very moment when I can move the caracter, i hit the ESC key to check if i can save or not... the SAVE option is off, is unable. How can I fix it?
