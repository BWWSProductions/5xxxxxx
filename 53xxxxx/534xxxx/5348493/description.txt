Behind every terrible husband is a woman seeking sexual
satisfaction elsewhere. In this provocative feature by
director Celeste, Digital Playground contract star
Katsuni is tormented by the cruelest man she knows...
The man she married. Unwilling to submit, Katsuni looks
to hurt him through heated trysts with a parade of young
studs. This is an erotic story of power games, betrayal
and passionate affairs. The cast of industry leading
beauties includes Tori Black, Jenna Presley, and Mason
Moore. In Digital Playground`s IS HE THERE?, the girls are
ready to take control of their lives by taking control of
the bedroom first.
