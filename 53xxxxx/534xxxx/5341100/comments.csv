It's Spenny's turn to pick a competition but Kenny has his own ideas of how things will progress. In this very rare behind-the-scenes episode, Kenny's megalomania materializes in the form of a Roman Emperor, while Spenny just wants to get on with it and do a simple sports competition.

E11 - Who Can Produce The Best Commercial?

Kenny and Spenny will try out their creativity as they produce a commercial for a frozen pizza. Kenny will experiment with unconventional ads, while Spenny is focused on doing a commercial with an interactive family-oriented pizza pie."
