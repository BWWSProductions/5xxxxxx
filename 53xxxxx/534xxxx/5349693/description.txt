With Commander Adama in critical condition, Col. Tigh is forced to take command of the Galactica. Capt. Apollo is put in the brig under arrest by Tigh for disobeying the order to arrest President Laura Roslin and for putting a gun to Tigh's head, despite Apollo's father having just been shot in cold blood. Roslin herself occupies the adjacent cell in the Galactica brig and is shocked to hear from Apollo what has happened to the Commander.
