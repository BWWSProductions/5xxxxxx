,montakiri,2010-02-07T08:38Z,"This comment was so stupid and judgemental. 

If I want to do it then I just share full file and that easy to hide the action.

Don't judge just from file size. 
Full size more dangerous than this type file size.

because when you download file in full size, your next action is run it (full size make us didn't want to use our mind in downloading file) and 100% more dangerous.

Torrent of course full of risk. So if you really want to keep save like me. check it use virus total scanner."
,Daveee999,2010-02-07T14:10Z,The latest trend in computer virus dispersal is faked .pdf files which if you have and older version of adobe can infect your machine. I do not know if this is a virus or not but saying it is a video when it is obviouly not is VERY suspicious!

,montakiri,2010-02-08T05:26Z,"Hey dude, do you read descriptions. Oh my god, I'm so stress to answer this stupid comment. I'm not sharing video in this torrent but just the review and video down link. 

The Pdf and link had been tested by my self and I checked it with virus total scanner. So if you don't believe me. Just checked by yourself or never download this torrent."

Post videos or Fuck Off!"
