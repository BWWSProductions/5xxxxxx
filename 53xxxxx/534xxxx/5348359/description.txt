"Hustle ! Reggae Disco" from the London based Soul Jazz Records crew is a smasher 
collection of reggae interpretations of classic disco tunes. As Lovers Rock and 
Rare Groove met in London in the 1980s, these disco reggae tracks are mix of UK 
artists such as the Blood Sisters, Carol Cool, Family Choice and Black Harmony and 
Jamaican artists and DJs such as Kingston's Derrick Laro and Trinity, Xanadu and 
Sweet Lady. The originals are Anita Ward's "Ring My Bell", Chaka Khan's "I'm Every Woman", 
Michael Jackson's "Don't Stop Till You Get Enough", Jean Carn's "Don't Let It Go To Your Head", 
The Whisper's "And The Beat Goes On", Sugarhill Gang "Rapper's Delight", Diana Ross "Upside Down"
, and William De Vaughn's "Be Thankful". This overlooked set of twelve inch disco killers 
features awesome versions such as One Blood's Be Thankful For What You've Got, the Blood Sisters 
with Ring My Bell, complete with a great drum'n' bass version and Black Harmony with 
Don't Let It Go To Your Head. Producer Joe Gibbs delivers two tracks here, which are withouth doubt 
the most impudent covers we've ever heard. The combination Xanadu and Sweet Lady bring Rapper's 
Delight, a track by the Sugarhill Gang, that was originally inspired by Jamaican toasters and the
Michael Jackson cover Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough which is brought to you by Derrick Laro 
(Lara ?) and the deejay Trinity. 
Shameless, cheap, but interesting enough to check out !



Enjoyyyy and Seed .
