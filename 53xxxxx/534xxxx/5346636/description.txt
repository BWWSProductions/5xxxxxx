Halo Stereo plays alternative/progressive modern rock with a highly original sound. They are very influenced by UK rock and they incorporate samples and synthetics to give their music a depth and freshness and edge rarely heard on modern rock radio. Though their music is progressive, you won't hear any 20 minute long opuses. The songs are streamlined and face-melting, getting right to the hook and grabbing the listener immediately.

Halo Stereo was Budweiser's 2006 Band of the year for the Southeast. They also won the 2006 Club Lavela battle of the bands in Panama City Beach, FL. They've released two albums independently and worked with two top-notch industry producers, Rick Beato (Shinedown, Needtobreathe, iNine, Jump Little Children) and Bill Cuomo (White Snake, REO Speedwagon, Kim Carnes, Steve Perry). Halo Stereo is aggressive alternative rock that leaves listeners blown away and wanting more!
