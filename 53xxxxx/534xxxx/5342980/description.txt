Oysterband (originally The Oyster Band) is a British electric folk or folk rock band formed in Canterbury in or around 1976.

The band formed in parallel to Fiddler's Dram and as the Oyster Ceilidh Band played purely as a dance band at first. The name Oyster comes from the group's early association with the coastal town of Whitstable in East Kent, known for the quality of its oysters. Their first album, released under the Oyster Ceilidh Band name, was Jack's Alive (1978) on the Dingles record label. Subsequent albums, as Oyster Band (sometimes The Oyster Band) were released on the band's own Pukka Music label: English Rock 'n' Roll: The Early Years 1800â€“1850 and Lie Back and Think of England, followed by Liberty Hall and 20 Golden Tie-Slackeners.
