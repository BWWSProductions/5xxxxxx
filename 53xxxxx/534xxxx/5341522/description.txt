IS A GREAT SHORT LIVED BUT NEVER AIRED AT THE TIME OF ITS MAKING SERIES.
HAS BEEN AIRED ON PUBLIC TV AT DIFFERENT TIMES.
SOURCE DVD HAD IT AS A SINGLE CHAPTER SO BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS ARE VERY
ABRUTE, A COUPLE HAVE A FEW SECONDS OF OVERIDE BUT IN NO WAY AFFECT THE 
OVERHAUL QUALITY WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD FOR THIS ERA.

A REAL MUST FOR KARLOFF  FANS

Forerunner of Thriller and Twilight Zone featuring Boris Karloff
Master Karloff Presents Mysterious Stories

"The Veil", a 1950's pilot series introduced by and starring Boris Karloff, concerned itself with ghostly tales and psychic phenomena. Although it was never taken up as a full series by a major network it still was quite entertaining. It is worth watching because of Karloff's own unique acting style and also because of the topics covered. One gets the impression that if it had been given a run then "The Veil" would have developed into a long running series investigating topics so well covered by future shows such as "The Twilight Zone" and "The X Files". It is a short series that a public television company would find useful in running in order to capture for a time a loyal viewing audience interested in ghostly tales or psychic phenomena. One of its best shows was the one about Jack the Ripper which will certainly get its viewers once again reading up books on this topic. A series well worth watching.
