,eleonoro,2010-02-11T01:37Z,I have chek this and of course it doesnt fix ANYTHING. The problem is that VTS_01_5.VOB is the same 5 minutes from VTS_01_1.VOB. The solution will be replace the wrong VTS_01_5.VOB for the correct one.

Did you have any errors when you tried to burn or when you try to play the DVD?"
