In 2006 in Japan, I recorded a promo mix from tracks I had been playing then. It was made on an Ableton Live setup â€“ so it was full of added samples and the 73min mix consisted of as many as 19 tracks (thatâ€™s 3:45 per track).

I didnâ€™t know about harmonic mixing then. I hadnâ€™t yet devised DJ notation. But by careful track pre-selection, I was able to come up with some pretty neat transitions and a really enjoyable set.

The day before yesterday, I found the master CD in my old stuff. Unfortunately, itâ€™s taken some damage since 4 years ago and I wasnâ€™t able to find the original recording anywhere on my harddrives. Also, it seems Iâ€™ve lost the tracklist, and some of the tracks are now totally strange to me.

But anyways, here it is: Monster. One of my earliest full-CD mixes. Made in Japan.


The intro track (#1) is a sample taken from Monster (ãƒ¢ãƒ³ã‚¹ã‚¿ãƒ¼), the anime series by NTV. Iâ€™m not a big anime fan but I really recommend this one. The other samples throughout the set are taken from all over the place.

Iâ€™ll update this place with a full tracklist once Iâ€™ve got all the pieces together.
