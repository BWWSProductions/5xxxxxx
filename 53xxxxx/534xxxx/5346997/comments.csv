[V],err0001,2010-02-09T02:39Z,"I haven't found any info on the Guard's future. 

I have no idea if the show has been cancelled or if more episodes will air at some point."
,john518,2010-02-09T03:37Z,"ok, thnx"
,n0tf0ry0u,2010-02-09T18:10Z,"Thank you so much!  I believe this is the last episode of the season.  You've brought the entire season to us!   

I'm really, really hoping this gets picked up for a second season (and it gets some international distribution, especially to the U.S.).

Cheers!"
,n0tf0ry0u,2010-02-09T18:34Z,"Actually, there's two more episodes left in the first season (I was wrong).

This is one instance where I'm happy to be wrong!
