[T],Ex_Exist,2010-02-06T19:38Z,"RamPaja,

Russian language."
,RawSnake,2010-02-06T20:18Z,Would be awsome if someone could translate menus etc (i dont have a clue how to do it) but other games have been done. Then maybe uploaded as a fix/patch so you just replace the language-files. Anyway thanks a lot for the up im getting it and hopefully there will be a fix for the language...
,strangerberry,2010-02-07T10:15Z,"Do you need a activation key?
by the other torrents of rig n roll you need a key so..."
,RamPaja,2010-02-07T10:28Z,Tnx Ex_Exist
,strangerberry,2010-02-07T17:39Z,"I want that game!!!
But I hope it works 
later I post of it works by me or not so...
oh and if you don't know what to do in game just push on some buttons..."
,gegezerg,2010-02-08T01:00Z,"I was just wondering, The Torrent only has a MSInfo Document named Trivium and an ISO. My question was, where is this TRiViUM folder supposed to be with the crack in it. "
,gegezerg,2010-02-08T01:15Z,Never mind I found it
,gegezerg,2010-02-08T01:39Z,"ya, it doesn't work. Opens the game then the game crashes then it tells you the binkw32.dll was not found and to reinstall"
,gegezerg,2010-02-08T01:47Z,"just want to make sure im doing this right, where exactly am I copying the Crack too? In to the RignRoll/Bin folder? Or into the main RignRoll folder?"
,DJArrival,2010-02-08T10:47Z,"You put the crack in the RignRoll/Bin folder ;) then you have to start the game with the .exe file in the RignRoll base folder in order to get it to start..

But the game is demanding very much of your system, it is poorly optimized in my opinion. I have a ok computer but I can not run it optimal in 800x600 on low settings.. Its just demanding to much from your CPU instead of the GPU, but I will try some tweaking with settings and so on to get it work..

The torrent works perfectly though, and thanks to Ex_Exist for uploading this ;)"
,sakkass,2010-02-08T19:16Z,"You are da men, men!!!! Good job!!! +1 from me ;)"
,strangerberry,2010-02-10T15:38Z,"I have a qeustion
I placed the trivium in the bin folder and he is still asking for a activation key:(
Help me plz. I want to play the game!!!"
,tomhanks300,2010-02-10T18:46Z,"could someone upload the crack seperately? i have the game already, but cant find a crack that works."
,saeedo,2010-02-28T05:51Z,"another link: h*t*t*p://r*e*m*i*x*s*h8are.com/dl/9k1k9/rnr.exe 
password: rnr
delete those *.ok!"
,vernissian,2010-05-12T16:49Z,can you crack the english version too
,mWarfare,2010-06-14T03:42Z,Why isn't TRiViUM cracking the Russian patched .exe? At least give us the source code.
,levon90,2011-05-05T16:36Z,"1. Download last official patch: (http://files.games.1c.ru/rig_n_roll/patches/rnr_ru_update_305.exe)
2. Download KeyGen by {TRiViUM}
(http://www.playground.ru/cheats/42314/) using 'Download' button. Keygen is working perfect and simple. And it's all right with saves in the game. (tested on Windows 7 64bit). But i have to admit, my antivirus detecteded a threat in the file, but it could be a false alarm. I ignored it, and it seems that everything is ok. 
3. Open 'png' image with keygen, wich illustrates the correct sequence of steps of activation."
,nicolajadegreen,2011-06-18T21:38Z,"izvini no mne avira govorit trojan v file trivium, i ne copyruet tak nazivaemiy real crack . est idei?????????"
,levon90,2011-09-18T14:47Z,"Я во всплывающем окошке Авиры вместо Remove нажимал Details, a там Always ignore. И тогда антивирус файл с кейгеном не удаляет и позволяет запуститиь. Никаких ощутимых изменений не произошло совершенно, а потому вполне возможно, что это ложная тревога."
