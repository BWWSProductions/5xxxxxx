Video Downloadhelper extension for Firefox has a fairly intensive user manual but I didn't particularly enjoy having to flick from various links to read all of this online therefore I copied all the info and compiled this PDF alo included the ConvertHelperSetup.exe component nabling downloaded videos to be converted to various formats. The only drawback is a watermarked logo unless you register and pay for the program which is a bit crap. Anyway this may be of some interest to someone, hope it is.
