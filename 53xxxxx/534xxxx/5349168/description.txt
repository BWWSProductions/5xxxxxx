A world shared by men and a sentient species of dragons. Includes an
alternative version of the 'George & The Dragon' story, this time told
from the dragons' perspective, and with a very different result.

"The story I am to tell is about the contention between ourselves &
mankind on the face of the earth and of the contention within the hearts
of many creatures stirred by that conflict. It is, above all, about my
brother, Amalric, a prince of dragons. He whose valour, love, and honour
in the end brought upon himself & upon mankind, & upon our nation, a fate
unthinkable in the days when it yet lay before us, inevitable now when
after many years we look back. I will speak first of those happy early days
and of our noble and beloved Uncle George, commander of the army, former
dragon errant, and teller of stories to the young."

A touch portentous at times, but worth suspending disbelief for it for a while.

NB The BBC also broadcast a (not so good) 60 minute version of this one.
