     Ã› Ã› Coalition, the Vasari Empire and the Advent are near           Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› stalemate. With the fronts temporarily stabilized, there is    Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› time to regroup, and entrench. Great defensive battlestations  Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› are being deployed and critical choke points fortified. Will   Ã› Ã›
     Ã› Ã› this buy the TEC, Vasari or Advent enough time to organize an  Ã› Ã›

     Ã› Ã› All the while, many of the Advent are growing sympathetic to   Ã› Ã›
