People that don't know, this game won Game of the Year Award.

Also its very fun and well tons and tons of hours of gameplay, all depends how big the map you choose you play on.

Anyways I def recommend this game if you like strategy, building, and blow shit up :)"

,Atributer,2010-02-09T10:14Z,"Guys which exe should i run for full game experience?
*Sins of a Solar Empire
*Sins of a Solar Empire Dev
*Sins of a Solar Empire Diplomacy
*Sins of a Solar Empire Diplomacy Dev
*Sins of a Solar Empire Entrenchment
*Sins of a Solar Empire Entrenchment Dev
*Sins of a Solar Empire EntrenchmentORG_tryme

And what is the difference between them?"
,meke7,2010-02-09T21:12Z,"I want to know the same thing as Atributer. There are many .exe's.. I think there was supposed to have a Trinity exe with Trinity logo in the menu, because everyone who bought Trinity it is like that. Please, can anyone tell wich exe is it to execute to play the entire pack together?"
,meke7,2010-02-09T21:41Z,"Did anyone found a lack of sensivity when moveing the camera arround (right mouse button)? Sometimes it will not move. I didnt found in the options anything about that, only for zoom. I had Sins entrenchment and didn't had this problem. It could be my mouse but it is functioning well off game."
,daemon1129,2010-02-12T02:34Z,"Does anyone know what patch version is the base game and entrenchment are in Trinity?
Are they already 1.9 and 1.5  already? Or just 1.0?"
,meke7,2010-02-12T06:07Z,"NanoEntity thanks a lot for the hint, online works great. Sadly they will patch to a new game version soon, I hope we find it here and that online pirate will be possible to keep up. Do they make any protection against it?"
,SenXXX,2010-02-16T06:57Z,"FYI Kaspersky finds a keylogger in the cracked exe.   Granted kaspersky can be overly paranoid.. not saying it's right, but something to keep in mind."
,WoeTheLiving,2010-02-16T08:44Z,"so i tried to play after i installed it and it came up with the error ""Could not run SDActivate.exe try running as Admin"" but i am the admin. help please?"
,cronicclapper,2010-02-19T15:41Z,Works great.  Easy install.  Now I've got to try it online.
,NanoEntity,2010-02-19T18:42Z,"Online dose not work anymore.

They released a new patch, someone needs to crack it so we can play online."
,angelugo,2010-02-21T06:39Z,Plz release the new patch and crack i cant join multiplayer because diplomacy was upgraded 1.01 
,Num13ers,2010-02-21T21:00Z,Starbases are just black. Looks like they're missing their textures/meshes? Is there a fix for this?
,VinKaleu,2010-02-22T09:35Z,"You should run the Sins of a Solar Empire Diplomacy executable for the best experience, it has all the content of the previous game/expansion.

Here is the 1.01 update with crack (Skidrow):
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5383915

I tested it and it works. So all you need to do is install the full game from this Trinity torrent, patch it with the 1.01 from the torrent I linked to and start Diplomacy."
,Zumzar,2010-02-22T22:37Z,"wtf! It dose not work man I have fucking around with this now in like 5h now. I have done all I know now and now I turn too you guys this is what happens.

,dante22,2010-02-25T02:43Z,"1-When Tec anti fighter frigate shots, its animation is replaced by a white thing... so yes, there are missing textures.

2-after 30 min - 1h game is closing without reason, something that never happened when i played normal sins/entrenchment, anyone havin this problem?"
,omego,2010-02-26T08:18Z,@dante22 Try to lower your screen resolution to fix the game breakdown :)

,foreveralone,2010-03-03T00:50Z,Lol sins is a awfuly small game (file size wise) isnt it
,shikkate,2010-03-04T07:43Z,"Thanks for nothing, i can't use the mod i downloaded this specifically for because these garbage expansions are bundled into the original..try fucking separating the expansions next time so they're optional."
,reeboker_cz,2010-03-11T14:45Z,"@shikkate: mind using the options button?

@thenoobish: thanks for sharing this nice release, and also good work on the patch for it"

,Salzarr,2010-03-14T18:56Z,"When I go to run the game the only thing that happens is that my screen goes black and the game stops responding.

Any suggestions?"
,Exalted.One,2010-03-26T00:08Z,"Brought this game a long time ago and keep buying the expansions. It's cheap, fun and they deserve support for not using shitty crappy securom or starforce and not having sick prices.

Kudos Stardock."
,dealorian,2010-03-26T22:09Z,I downloaded the file but i need an activation key? What do I do?
,reeboker_cz,2010-04-03T23:03Z,"@delorian: look in the .nfo (info file) there's line saying ""4. Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to your installation directory and overwrite "", and if you can get to step five......."
,cocainecripin,2010-04-17T11:52Z,"hey if anybody is willing to play sins once in a while, i have some time allmost everyday, but until the new crack comes out, we could use hamachi anybody willing to make a new gaming freind and is a gaming freak like me  contact me kristofer124@hotmail.com

,WId0W,2010-05-01T09:37Z,"Just thought i'de mention, and someone else mantioned it a little while ago in an earlier message. When trying to rn the game for the first time My Firewall (that also acts in a way similar to spy doctor acts) keeps telling me that 'sins of a solar empire' exe is trying to record key strokes. I've looked into this quite considerably and no one anywhere has mentioned the legit game does this. Also the actual key 'logger' is coming from the 'cracked' exe, not any part of the original game directory.

Why a crack for the game would need to record keystrokes is beyond me. Apart from the obvious possability that it is actually a keylogger that is recording the keystrokes of everyone thats installed this game for various dubious reasons. i have been playing this for a day or so, but due to this i am more than likely going to completely remove this installation from my computer and do a deep clean of the computer to make sure nothing fuckery has been left behind.

Dodgy install. There is undeniably a keylogger that is proven to actively attempt to record keystrokes in the crack to this game which has absolutely no reason to be there. Let me re-iterate. this is NOT a false possitive. The keylogger has been flagged as 'actively' attempting to record key strokes.

Do yourself a favour and find a different version to torrent."
,alexbard14,2010-05-06T06:54Z,I'm a little new to downloading torrents. what does it mean by Copy the content from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD to you installation directory and overwrite. Any help would be greatly appreciated!                     
,igisistratos,2010-05-11T14:03Z,thanks for the good job you are doing guys salute from the land of 300
,c0796,2010-05-14T07:34Z,"When playing single player I don't see any option for Campaign, regardless of what exe I use, is this just for skirmish/multiplayer?

Thanks"
,usair,2010-05-21T19:07Z,Am I blind or isn't there any SKIDROW folder on the DVD?
,Kyiaro,2010-05-29T09:24Z,"@0n1n3 There is NOTHING wrong with this release, so maybe your the moron who needs to stop being so anal and figure out whats wrong instead of crying about it in comments. If the crack doesn't work for you here

Find yourself a working crack if your not so mentally challenged as to figure out how.
