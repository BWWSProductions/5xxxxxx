The Pacific ten-part misiseries. The Pacific tracks the interwined real-life stories of three us marines across the vast canvas of the pacific theater during world war 2. The miniseries follows these men and their fellow marines from their first battle with the japanese on Guadalcanal, through the rain forests of Cape Gloucester and the strongholds of Peleliu, across the bloody sands of Iwo Jima and through the horror of Okinawa, and finally to their triumphant but uneasy return home after V-J Day.
