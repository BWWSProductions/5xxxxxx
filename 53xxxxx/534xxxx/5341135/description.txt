America Stories of War (DVD, 2008, 36-Disc Set; Collector's Tin)  - you can bye it at 50$ - for all 36(!) dvd (dvd-9 - best quality) in box (on ebay - and 20$ at the good market day)

I recommend download this film only from Rus - where many wild white bears and post-office work sux (full sux - 6 month for this pack)
