,volgon,2010-07-19T01:11Z,"Sorry, figured out the offline thing. But every time i try to use it, it asks for me to make it a live account instead"
,perin8,2010-09-24T03:17Z,"This is my first time trying to do something like this , I got as far as the install, I have power ISO but not sure what I'm supposed to do with that like what files would go on the virtual drive or if I burned it what should i burn? It's asking for a CD when I get that sorted out I'll worry about he Windows live part.
