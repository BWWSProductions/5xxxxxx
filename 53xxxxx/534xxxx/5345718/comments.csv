,daba_1,2010-02-08T14:26Z,"Whether this exceptional album is jazz with its roots in bluegrass or vice versa doesn't matter, because whatever it is, it works -- wonderfully. Fleck is joined by his jazz friends (Chick Corea and Branford Marsalis) as well as his progressive bluegrass pals (Sam Bush, Tony Rice, and Jerry Douglas), plus members of his usual backing band, the Flecktones (Victor Wooten and Future Man). The resulting performances should pique the interest of curious listeners across any number of genres. "
