,Cobes26,2011-10-16T20:48Z,"Ok, so a few things are wrong with trying to enter full screen. My Windows 7 resolution is set to 1366x768 (the highest and recommended setting) and the resolution in the XP vhd is the exact same resolution. When I try to enter full screen it immediately quits full screen and says the resolution is too high. The smallest resolution I can enter that actually enters full screen is 1152x768 but there are black walls beside the display, it doesn't stretch across the whole screen. Does anyone know how I can go about fixing this? Any help would be great."
,RichardHighHopes,2011-10-27T15:55Z,"Thunder, do you know the Administrator password for this Virtual XP? e.g., if I want to run a program as Administrator, it prompts me for the password.  Thanks."
