I used AutoGK to encode the film. I used Virtualdub to organize the film into regular parts just as in the DVD. Finally, I used Subrip
to extract the subtitles from the DVD.

This is the only release on the internet that has DvDrip quality plus extended edition stuff with it.

The quality is the same as in the DVD, there is no part in the film that is interlaced or pixely as other releases. The video might be blurry in certain parts because it was shot undercover with handled cameras, it's blurry in the DVD too.

To play the avi files, You must have XviD codec.
To play the subtitles, you must have vobsub.
Both are downloadble and free.

To use the subtitles, simply cut or copy the desired language file and paste it in the main folder with 'Earthlings.avi' file.

Subtitles are only for the main film, and do not support the extended edition files.

If you don't want the extra features, then all you have to do is to uncheck them on opening the .torrent file. 

PLZ watch this movie. That's all I ask. It will leave you speechless.
