,Benishdamenish,2011-05-06T11:49Z,Watching this was disturbingly awakening. I tried to get others to watch but suffice to say people are afraid of having their compassion stimulated for it may ruin their appetite. Its seems ignorance is a defense mechanism against positive change.
,Progressychedelic,2011-08-04T04:04Z,Thanks man.
,JawDroppinDroopBallz,2011-10-19T01:29Z,"Thanks, this documentary is just terrible, the look in the fox's eyes as its skin is ripped off it while its alive is stuck in my head. The people that do this deserve to be tortured. I'm not a vegetarian, but this has made my conscience so heavy :("

Gonna have a big fry up now, vegetarians are fags!"
,scanpb,2012-04-24T00:49Z,"@dududus
Even if we are meant to eat each other or not. There is a difference between this and hunting like animals. That line is crossed a long time ago and this machinery has evolved into something very disgusting.

As usual human behavior as a whole in modern society shows little respect towards animals or other humans beings."
,scanpb,2012-04-24T01:01Z,And for everybody liking this and hating other people doing what you just witness please watch documentary Kymatica so you understand what is repeatingly causing all shit in this experience you call life and understand once and for all what really needs to be changed.
