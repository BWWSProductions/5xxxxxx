Another faultless John Renbourn album. 
This guy is really playing music for music and not for the money, whatever it will chart or not, and whatever how long an album should be. If there is no more inspiration, no need to add useless fillers. 
The guitar playing is always musically and technically outstanding. John never tries to impress the audience by only playing fast by showing he's the best; The soul, tradition and technique always make one.  
The 4 first tracks are among the best ones here: 
"I Know My Babe" is a beautiful song with a memorable melody. 
"Can't Keep from Crying" is another good one. I can imagine this one covered by J.J. Cale it would suit him perfectly.
Among the instrumental stuff, just listen to "Walz" (which really doesn't sound like a real waltz, but who cares?). The guitar playing is impressive in the way to give such a punchy sound in the bass line while keeping the melody line clear. 
In the gospel "Nobody's Fault but Mine", last track here,  Renbourn plays the bottleneck style with a great mastery. 

A true masterpiece in spite of its 28' length album.
