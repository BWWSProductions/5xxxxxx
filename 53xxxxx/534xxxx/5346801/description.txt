The first book in Lawrence Durrell's [1912-1990]
'Alexandria Quartet', published in the 1950s. AFAIK,
the BBC hasn't adapted any of the rest into plays.

1930s. Egypt. Poor Englishman becomes infatuated
with Alexandrine socialite Justine Hosnani, wife of
his friend & mentor, and one of Egypt's richest men.

Only later does he fret about the impact of this
betrayal on his lover and Justine's husband.

A strange and involving story, full of odd characters.
