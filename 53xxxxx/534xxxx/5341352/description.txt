The Blue Whale is the largest creature that has ever lived on the face of the planet. It grows up to thirty meters and weights up to 125 metric tons at maturity. Over the centuries, it has fired the human imagination and become a legendary beast, the Leviathan. Despite its colossal size, the Blue Whale remains elusive. It is rare and nomadic, spending 90% of its life underwater, surfacing only briefly to breathe, then diving back into its own mysterious world.

The film tracks the efforts of dedicated researchers equipped with new scientific techniques, who are significantly increasing our knowledge about the behavior on and beneath the waves of these largest of whales. Filmed in the estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada, Mexico's Sea of Cortez and off the coast of Iceland, the film allows viewers to share in a great scientific adventure, while witnessing unique images of this mesmerizing marine mammal.
