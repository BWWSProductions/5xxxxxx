The "Who Am I" (1987) album was a long-awaited new studio effort from ex-Spooky Tooth founder, Gary Wright (also of later "Dream Weaver" fame). It features 10 great songs carrying on Gary's signature blend of keyboard-laced funky rock, introspective/spiritual love lyrics, and falsetto vocals! 

Hope you'll like it.
