running malwarebytes i got message saying my ultraiso downloaded here has backdoor trojan Ircbot.NJC in file UltraISO\lang\lang.dll

i tried to upload this file to threatexpert.com but windows 7 told me i don't have permission to open it

,coca87,2011-08-20T21:23Z,"Norton picked up a Trojan threat in Keygen as soon as it finished downloading to my computer. Norton quickly removed the fie but I was still able to run the program with no problems. I don't even understand the purpose of the keygen since there is a serial txt file. sound suspect, yet other than that its a good download. "
