Compression mini tutorial (hope I stimulate others to compress):

1. get SUPER (it's freeware and can convert everything to everything)
SUPER RULEZ:D


2. modify settings like this (or cut a little portion of video, then play around):
 2.1 codec H264
 2.2 set video width X 288 (width/288 must be equal to originalWidth/originalHeight)
 2.3 set video bitrate somewhere between 240-270. I set it 240:P I didn't go lower.
 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz

3. Hit the button:D
You should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.

That's all
(of course, then you create a torrent, then upload to tpb:D)
