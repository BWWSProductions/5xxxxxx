I had some problems with the xvid ones, when maximising the screen with Media Player Classic. didn't have any problem when using VLC player, and with the latest h264 ones, no problem with either. You might install ffdshow (freeware) and enable the libavcodec for xvid and h264 playback - it seems to use less cpu power.

And ""slicknick - I love to get the LItes first, that way you don't have to worry about spoilers in the 450 coverage, though 'Fro and Ralph are pretty good about that these days."
