Okay, for all of you who were searching for a proper, high quality rip, including the talk stations, here it is.  

Every radio station from GTA Vice City in its entirety, every cut scene, even the ambience, it's all here, tagged with artwork, converted directly from the game data.  It won't get any better than this.

Made possible with a copy of the game, and the following guide:

NOTE: The WAV files kept crashing iTunes when I tried converting them to MP3s, so I had to use a different encoder.  The file sizes are considerably smaller than my other GTA rips, but the quality is the same.
