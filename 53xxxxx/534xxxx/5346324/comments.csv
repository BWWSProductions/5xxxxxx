Under The Assumption Your Using Utorrent

When You Click ""Download This Torrent""

A Window Should Open Up In Utorrent, Showing 2 Files, Check Only The Sample File For Download...

If Satisfied With The Download Click The ""Files"" Tab Inside Of Utorrent, Right Click The Full .Avi File, And Select ""Normal""

Hope I Helped Homey!!"
