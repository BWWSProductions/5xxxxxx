,suckbox554,2010-12-14T07:44Z,Hey I tried to download this but it is saying 0 seeders. Just wanted to check this out since i have just recently taken classes for MFC programming and wanted to check out how the Visual Basic was when it was first released in DOS
,iolo_is_alive,2010-12-29T02:45Z,This is the Windows 1.0 version of Visual Basic. I have the Visual Basic DOS version around somewhere if you still want it. Let me know (I don't check these too frequently but I'll try).
