,cbehr64,2010-02-13T20:13Z,i like how you encode your vids holyroses. when i first started dling brrips i downloaded alot of secretmyth rips until a couple of them let me down quality wise with lots of encode errors and just bad sources in general.  I personally now just dl 1080p source and resize them myself for own personal uses and have noticed a huge difference in quality. I give you kudos for making such proper rips. I would like to share some of my rips with you if interested. I've been using ripbot as of late what program do you use?
,cbehr64,2010-02-14T05:45Z,"oh ok. well i have the lotr trilogy in 720p mp4 5.1aac 5gb per film if your interested its the best quality youll find out there. i encoded it from a 1080p hdtv source so its near perfect quality. i figured that with your reputation you could do more with it than myself. im not sure how else to contact you besides commenting lol but if your interested heres some screens granted there downsize the movies look great and fluid when playing crisp with no sync errors ...and if your in need of some help with rips im sure i could be of some help...if not i still appreciate all your work in the community keep it up!

,TheRiddlerz,2011-08-25T12:30Z,This video claims to be 720p but i have to say it looks terrible. I may be wrong but just putting the word out there that it looks worse than it did in non HD on cable the other night.
