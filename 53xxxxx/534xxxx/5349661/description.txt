├óΓé¼┼ôThere├óΓé¼Γäós living art,├óΓé¼┬¥ says Pakito Bolino, ├óΓé¼┼ôand dead art.├óΓé¼┬¥ Skulls, gore, medical horror and violence may be luridly prominent in the work of Le Dernier Cri, the French publishing house/art collective of which Bolino and Caroline Sury are the founders. There├óΓé¼Γäós no question, though, that life - ferocious, vibrant, chaotic life - seems to pulse through every drop of ink they lay down. 

Originally from Paris but now based in Marseilles, Bolino and Sury run a silkscreening studio from which they├óΓé¼Γäóve produced, through painstaking handmade effort, a decade├óΓé¼Γäós worth of books, comics, monographs, print-medium objets d├óΓé¼Γäóart and their flagship magazine Hospital Brut. Oh, and some wild films, too, short barrages of mindbending ocular mayhem assembled by an entire gang of artists. Le Dernier Cri, after all, isn├óΓé¼Γäót just Bolino and Sury, it├óΓé¼Γäós a spectrum of edgy talent from Europe, Japan, the States and right here. - some review

Very twisted animation from France, doesn't matter if you don't speak the language, it's all surreal.

Props to the original ripper/upper.
