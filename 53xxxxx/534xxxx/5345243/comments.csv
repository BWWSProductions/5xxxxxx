,78kevin,2010-02-13T19:53Z,"I know people like to see movies quickly and stuff i just don't understand watching cams, i'm not complaining, each to there own all i'm saying is i don't get it???"
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-02-16T12:18Z,Great movie and very decent cam. Worth the download. +1
,sharky4687,2010-02-19T21:18Z,@78kevin I totally agree with you. I rather watch proper movie in full quality Â˝ year later than watch this shit right now.
,xXENDGAMEXx,2010-02-24T20:36Z,Do not visit that website and devil09 your trash for posting that scam azz shit!
,svenningx,2010-04-14T18:56Z,"should have included ""CAM"" in the title :/ its just widescreen cam."
,Fritoman9,2010-04-16T07:25Z,"Thats what TS means... a CAM. everyone else knows that cept u lol.

also i agree with the going to theatres nowadays. knowing theres better looking/quality video technology out there i cant bring myself to justify paying $10-$11 to watch a blurry oversized verion of the studios' hi def film. just seems ludicrous."
,Franzipoo,2010-04-18T23:10Z,"Very bad quality, It has no place in the hi-def movie category

A-5
V- 5

very dissapointed"
,emptyx,2010-04-21T10:44Z,"Hey! This is great! But if someone could seed just a little bit more it would be even greater! 
Many thanks! / Emptyx  :D"
,gioia221,2010-04-22T13:57Z,"Video really sucks :S
Waiting for the real 720p"
,DragonFangNINE,2010-04-27T01:13Z,"Thanks for the up bone, seeded to 3.
Not up to snuff for quality for me, but I'm blu-ray spoiled.
Audio and video sampled at random points.
Cam rating
A-5.5
V-7
Overall
A-3
V-4"
,cktcatt,2010-04-29T00:45Z,"Forget the CAM/TS VS ""getting it right now"" argument crap!!!

Bottom line is that this is in the wrong category!

Don't waste your time with this seed from .BONE if you are after a Highres - Movie"
,kinvore,2010-04-29T07:58Z,"Is there a way this can be recategorized?  No way a cam should be listed under high res, that's very deceptive."
,slevenski,2010-04-30T18:44Z,why bother when the release is shit?!
,Serie56sfm,2010-05-02T22:33Z,Ill wait for a HD Version Thanksssssssss
,flex5150,2010-05-04T03:51Z,"Seriously, why clutter up the Hi RES movie section with Cams now? I used to come here knowing I would get good quality, now we get shitty cams!

I must admit its a good quality cam, but seriously people LABEL IT IN THE TITLE! and keep it off the HI RES section"
,Kotoblichin,2010-05-05T01:38Z,Quality is shit. Quick download.
,helioantunes,2010-05-06T17:23Z,"hd my ass 
stupid , HD!!
it`s a quality of a piece of crap"
,Fallstaff,2010-05-08T08:42Z,Balls. Total Balls.
,suisenbenjo,2010-05-09T20:35Z,"Telesync = ""Highres - Movies""??? Even if you make it 720p resolution it's not 720p if it's a cam video. "
,bonejj,2010-05-18T17:44Z,really disappointed in the quality of this video. the audio and video just suck. 
,ITRUN,2010-05-28T23:51Z,Fuck off is this in HD. It looks like this shit has been upscaled from an SD source! 
,Downlo22,2011-06-02T07:57Z,i cant immagine it being the worst download ive ever had... id have to say that goes to the one with the chair in the way AND THEY ADJUST THE DAMN CAM.. quit ur bitchen
