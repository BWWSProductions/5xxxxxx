The Maguindanao massacre, also known as the Ampatuan massacre (after the town where the mass graves were found), occurred on the morning of November 23, 2009, in the town of Ampatuan in Maguindanao province, on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. The victims were about to file a certificate of candidacy for Esmael Mangudadatu, vice mayor of Buluan town. Mangudadatu was challenging Datu Unsay mayor Andal Ampatuan, Jr., son of the incumbent Maguindanao governor Andal Ampatuan, Sr., in the forthcoming Maguindanao gubernatorial election, part of the national elections in 2010. The 57 people killed included Mangudadatu's wife, his two sisters, journalists, lawyers, aides, and motorists who were witnesses or were mistakenly identified as part of the convoy.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has called the Maguindanao massacre the single deadliest event for journalists in history. At least 34 journalists are known to have died in the massacre. In a statement, CPJ executive director Joel Simon noted that the killings, "appears to be single deadliest event for the press since 1992, when CPJ began keeping detailed records on journalist deaths." The CPJ further noted that, "Even as we tally the dead in this horrific massacre, our initial research indicates that this is the deadliest single attack on the press ever documented by CPJ."

Bootleg DVDs of Maguindanao massacre on sale.

DAVAO CITY - Bootleg digital video disc (DVD) copies of the â€œMaguindanao Massacre 11/23/09,â€ are now being sold underground in many parts of Mindanao, according to those who have seen the film. The Philippine Daily Inquirer was able to get a copy of the DVD. Running over four hours, the DVD showed the actual retrieval of the bodies from the massacre site at Barangay Salman, Ampatuan town, Maguindanao. It showed the blood-soaked, bullet-riddled and mutilated bodies of the Ampatuan massacre victims. Most of the footage had graphic images of body parts protruding from the earth.

The material contained the first two days of the retrieval operations conducted by the authorities after the November 23 abduction and grisly murder of at least 57 civilians, 31 of them journalists and the rest close relatives and supporters of Buluan Vice Mayor Esmael Mangudadatu, a Maguindanao gubernatorial candidate running against the Ampatuans in the 2010 elections.

Maguindanao massacre DVD sold in Davao.

LIKE a constant reminder of the brutality of the Ampatuan massacre, DVD copies of video clips entitled "Maguindanao Massacre 11/23/09â€ is now available even in the city. A look-see at DVD stalls here revealed the item has been available just around two weeks after the November 23, 2009 massacre. From what he has seen of the video, the vendor said, the clips could have been taken by one of the Scene of the Crime Operatives of the Philippine National Police (PNP).

The film, which runs for more than four hours, covers the first two days of the retrieval operation by authorities in Barangay Salman in Ampatuan town where 57 civilians were abducted and murdered, easily called the worst election-related crime in Philippine history. The DVD features a hand-held video of authorities exhuming the bodies of the victims: disfigured, blood-soaked or blood-drained from the force of gunshots or from being run over by the backhoe.
