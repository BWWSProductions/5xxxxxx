Just say NO to religion.

End superstition. 
Embrace rationalism. 
Develop and exercise critical thinking skills.
Throw your ""sacred"" texts on a bonfire... save just enough copies for the museums. "

,DevilNuts,2011-03-03T10:36Z,"There are other reasons to want to read the bible than simply believing in it. Regardless of the truths (or lack thereof) contained within, the King James Bible is, like it or not, one of the cornerstones of English literature and has been since it was translated into it's current incarnation in the seventeenth century.

While there are many among us who do not subscribe to the Christian belief system, it can scarcely be denied that we owe much of even our intellectual heritage to many profound works of literature, culture and art that were derived from somewhere within its daft, misguided pages.

I am reading the bible because I feel it is important to understand the full nature of something if I am to intelligently argue against [or even for] it. My purpose is not one of spiritual fulfillment, and I would caution you against discouraging anyone to read anything.

I say read and learn as much as you can about anything - especially those things which you are skeptical about - and keep always present the confidence in your ability to decide for yourself those things you wish to believe."
,DevilNuts,2011-03-03T10:49Z,"
I challenge any devout Christians who read this post to afford themselves the same opportunity to evaluate all positions and decide for themselves. Shield yourselves from nothing!! Just as I, a non-believer, am willing to cast down my ignorance and read your Bible so that I may learn from it to whatever purpose -- so too should you.

,Frequentdler328,2011-09-12T12:24Z,Okay first off thanks to Yeshua for the UL and second when you comment on a torrent do it to either A: Comment on quality of the torrent. or B:ask for help using the torrent. or C: help someone who is having trouble using the torrent. Religious debates are for forums not comment sections please leave only helpful comments and don't start flame wars by insulting or questioning someone's beliefs it only leads to hurt feelings and pointless debates.
