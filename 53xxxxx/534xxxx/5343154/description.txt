Garmin MapInstall Special version 3.13.5

This modified executable will let you upload your mapset (gmapsupp.img)
to your PC drives too, not only or your GPS.

Instructions for use:
1.
- Install MapInstall 3.13.5 (Get it from:)
2.
- Replace MapInstall.exe
3.
- On the Device Settings screen under the "Find Device" button all local and
  network drives will be available, so you can create gmapsupp.img files
  without an attached GPS.
