Chronological look at the fiasco in Iraq, especially decisions made in the spring of 2003 - and the backgrounds of those making decisions - immediately following the overthrow of Saddam: no occupation plan, an inadequate team to run the country, insufficient troops to keep order, and three edicts from the White House announced by Bremmer when he took over: no provisional Iraqi government, de-Ba'athification, and disbanding the Iraqi armed services. The film has chapters (from History to Consequences), and the talking heads are reporters, academics, soldiers, military brass, and former Bush-administration officials, including several who were in Baghdad in 2003.


Please share with as many people as possible.  War isn't just a Democrat or Republican crime.  It hurts us all in the end regardless of our age, gender, religion, ethnicity, country of origin, or political afiliation.  It's time to wake up not only Americans, but all citizens of the world.  These senseless wars MUST be stopped.
