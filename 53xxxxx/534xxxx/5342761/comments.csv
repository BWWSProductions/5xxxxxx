TIA!"

1995. Afghanistan. Russian cargo plane was forced to land on an aerodrome in the capital of Islamic terrorism - Kandagar. Five Russian pilots were captured by Taliban fanatics. They've got to live 378 days in hell.
How not to betray your Motherland if you are promised freedom for that? How not to reject faith if you are guaranteed life for that? How to remain yourself - if you are threatened to die? Escape is the only way...
The plane is on the runway. The runway is a minefield, fighters in the air, stingers on the ground. But there is now other chance to get back home.

The film is based on real events.

Regards, 
Dimking, Russia."
