What is this new unlocking mechanism? Is it better or worse than the earlier one?"
[T],Nincsenex,2010-02-07T20:18Z,"Better or worse?
Depends for who.
From now you will be not able to unlock new maps, like CN Eu 2010.30 with the 25 chars long key in MapSource.
These new maps are only unlocked when installation is performed via setup.exe (not the .msi method).
This way a GPS has to be connected to your PC and the PC have to be online so Garmin can check if you are installing it legaly, if yes a CNEUNT2010.30.gma certificate file will be created. MapSource will check for the CNEUNT2010.30.gma file, and if it can't find it it will not unlock the new maps.
This is true for new maps only!

Workaround: You can still use older MapSource.exe, like the 6.15.7 version."

,ali87sa,2010-06-11T23:47Z,"Dear Nincsenex,

MapSource 6.16.1 is already out, will we ever be able to use it to unlock the latest 2011 maps?

Some users are reporting issues when using the latest maps with an old MapSource, Garmin has fixed those issues in their recent MapSource updates.

Will you be able to upload City Navigator NT Middle East 2011 maps? :) Thanks!"
