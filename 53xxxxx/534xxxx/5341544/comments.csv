Maybe you're new. Or maybe you just don't like to look around or read a little bit. But do at least read this: When you're looking at a movie to download from ThePirateBay (TPB), at the very top of the page under 'Details for this torrent', there is usually a section with a line called 'Info:' and usually it will have 'IMDB' in blue next to it so that you can follow the link to imdb.com (Internet Movie Database = all the movie info you could want) where you will find information for the movie for download. There you will see exactly which movie it is in case the title is similar to others or you don't know the movie. Also, if you can't find a link up at the top, often times the uploader will include it in their description (the white box between the green 'DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT (^MAGNET LINK)' links. Always look for a link that might take you to imdb.com and you won't be embarrassed when someone tells you it's right there in front of your nose. :) If you don't see the link then it would make sense to ask someone."
