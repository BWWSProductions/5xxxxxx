,jfhorseman,2010-02-07T19:52Z,"Sample looks like a pretty good cam, very watchable and sound is ok.

Video=5 or 6

Audoi=6

I'm still downloading and will comment after watching the entire movie"
,grendelyn,2010-02-07T20:05Z,Is there a R5 copy of this movie out there somewhere?
,jfhorseman,2010-02-07T21:01Z,"Update the actual video is just barely watchable very fuzzy and the audio is from the cam with quite a bit of echo.

Video = 4

Audio = 5

Sorry but the sample is much better than the actual video and truth be known the movie stopped being interesting about midway. I would give it about a 6 for total movie quality.
