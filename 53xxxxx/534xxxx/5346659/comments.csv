,Swanee1,2010-02-08T22:54Z,"Would someone please explain to me how you can get an almost 3 hour movie into less than 400 MB and still retain any quality?
Sorry for being sceptical, and thanks to the uploader for his effort, but I'm just interested to know the answer."
[V],MKVGuy,2010-02-09T04:02Z,"1st of all its not a rip from DVD the source is a Screener and 2nd its for low bandwidth users for whom 700mb is a pain and 1gig or 2 gig is beyond there imagination..

I don't release screeners but because of the popularity I want those users to have this copy until the DVD is out and I will delete this version from my list..

I agree that the quality is not upto the mark but again what I use to say that this have the best combination of settings and this is the max which you can get in 400megs..

this is the 2nd copy of my 5 experiments in 2 days.."
,aim4it,2010-02-09T04:51Z,"First the off I don't understand everyone expecting 1080p when the dvd hasn't been released.  All those saying DVDrip are only the test dvd theaters get for pre-screening before purchasing rights to the real movie, and to curb leaking they degrade those dvds and add artifacts.

Secondly, the this is the highest quality rip i've seen yet, only one problem, lack of seeder has everyone stuck at 44.9%"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-02-09T05:02Z,I am still seeding mate.. will take another 2 hrs to complete..
,ansari.ec,2010-02-09T07:50Z,Hiii MKVGuy.... Thanks a lot for the upload. Just cant wait to download.......... Snapshots look great.... Thank You Once again......

,Adamalmighty,2010-02-09T10:01Z,"If the screenshots are anything to go by, then this torrent would be worth a look. But the DL is painfully slow. The lack of seeds has created a bottleneck. Earlier I saw 3 seeds in the swarm but have yet to see 1 of them connected. MKVGuy you say this torrent is for people with a low bandwidth? I have a low bandwidth and this torrent would have finished hours ago if there had been at least 1 seed CONNECTED!!!
PLEASE SEED!!!"
[V],jainmehul,2010-02-09T10:20Z,seed plzzz
,Adamalmighty,2010-02-09T10:21Z,"66.6% complete

MKVGuy - Are you taking the piss? You need to connect and get this sorted before its reported!!"

,DharKhon,2010-02-09T21:23Z,Does this have the in-movie subs for the Na'Vi in English or is this still the original German source with English subs written over the German in movie subs.

Thanks you, Sir, for all your work and consideration to others."
,vasanth_nani,2010-02-22T01:16Z,thank you
,yakoff,2010-02-22T05:42Z,"Wow, MKVGuy, what happened?  A little blurry?  Seems like it'd be ok to let this one be around say, 550 MB, just for it's duration?  I'll keep seeding but only because it seems others are ok with shit; no offence, I got turned onto .mkv by your Gamer, I was stunned.  I'm stunned again this time but in a bad sort of way."
[V],MKVGuy,2010-02-22T09:56Z,"yes agree yakoff, 500megs for this much run-time is OK not 400megs.. anyways ppl are liking it and I maintained my standard of 400megs.. for the original DVDRip I may release a 700megs with 5.1 audio.. howz that sounds for this movie.."
,urecord,2010-02-22T16:42Z,thanks! been looking for such torrent

,Rod321,2010-02-25T02:55Z,"Download speed 8/10
Visuals are fuzzy but watchable 6.5/10
Sound 9 Sync 10
For a 400mb Screener I was surprised. I was given a 1.2 gig Screener copy a couple of weeks ago but it's visuals & sound are not as good as this one. I downloaded & burnt this one just to check its quality & I am impressed.
Thank you MKVGuy & others"
