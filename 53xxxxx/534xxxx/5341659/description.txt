From Wiki:

Empire Records is a 1995 cult comedy-drama about a group of record store employees. The film was directed by Allan Moyle and stars Anthony LaPaglia, Robin Tunney, Rory Cochrane, RenÃ©e Zellweger, Ethan Embry, and Liv Tyler. [/quote]






Empire Records 1995


The version of the song "Sugarhigh" that appears in the movie differs significantly from the one included on the soundtrack. The main differences are that the movie version has additional lyrics and chorus vocals provided by RenÃ©e Zellweger and it is musically one semitone lower than the CD version.

Also notably absent from the soundtrack are the tracks "This Is The Day" by The The, played during the rooftop dancing scene before the closing credits, "Seems" by Queen Sarah Saturday, chosen by Mark after he wins the M&M challenge while preparing to open the store, "Romeo and Juliet by Dire Straits, "Snakeface" by Throwing Muses, when Cory is getting lunch ready for Rex Manning, "If You Want Blood, (You've Got it)" by AC/DC, "Money" by the Flying Lizards played as a tribute to Lucas, "Video Killed the Radio Star" by the Buggles played during the Rex Manning preparation scene, "I Shot the Devil" by Suicidal Tendencies played during Mark and some of the customers start moshing in the shop, and the song "Plowed" by Sponge.
