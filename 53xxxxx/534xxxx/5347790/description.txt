***Please note below)** 

In case that you are trying to open the zip archive with Compressed Folders (built in in Windows): 

Windows only supports 32 bit Zip archives. 
A 32 bit Zip file cannot be bigger than 4 GB. 
The new Gamebase64 Zip file is more than 5 GB, so this file is a 64Bit archive. 

Almost all other archivers (7-Zip, WinRAR, WinZip) can handle this file without problems.
