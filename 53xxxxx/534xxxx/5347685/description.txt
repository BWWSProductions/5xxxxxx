Custom chopper frames: There is a lot to know before you decide to order or build a chopper frame. It's not simply a matter of saying "I want a hard tail frame". You have a lot of details to consider before you order or design your custom chopper frame.
Winter is the time that most people decide to perform a build. In most parts of the country it is too cold and the weather is too bad to get much road time in. It's a time for wrenching and getting ready for next spring and all the rallies. It's also a time for building that dream chopper you've wanted for ages.

In order to purchase a frame, or even design one yourself, you need to determine the amount of rake, stretch, tubing thickness, neck, width, offset, and other factors before you ever pick up the phone or pencil to begin. Do you want a custom chopper soft tail or rigid or a Pro-street which is long and low soft tail frame?
