Well, it took me a few hours, but here it is! This is the unofficial Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Soundtrack as compiled by me, i-ghost.

I take no credit for ripping/obtaining these tracks originally, however I take full credit for finding the tracks, compiling this into an album and tagging them. Don't worry, I haven't placed any advertisements in any tags for any songs,

I have first-hand experience of how frustrating that is.

This is also my first 'release', so please leave constructive criticism on the comments page of the blog post, thanks.

NOTES:

--

The only tracks missing are the level select (before you select your character in versus mode) the 'Shop' music, the 'VS' screen jingle, the  ranking/high scores music, the boss tracks and the standard credits music. I'll add these as I find them. In case you're wondering, 'Where the Wind Blows' (Jap or Eng) doubles up as Roll's theme (Jap or Eng). 



As the character themes were never included in Ultimate All Stars from Cross Generation of Heroes due to licencing issues on the Tatsunoko side, Capcom did not make themes for the new/exclusive characters in Ultimate All Stars, so that's why there are no themes for Frank West etc. (correct me if I am wrong). Yes, they could have just included the original Capcom character's themes, but I guess that would have been unfair to the Tatsunoko side

If anybody knows the actual composers/artist names, please let me know so I can credit them.
