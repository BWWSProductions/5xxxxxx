Allmusic Review:
The sound of En Vogue isn't greatly affected by the departure of Dawn Robinson for their third album, EV3, since the group's harmonies remain remarkably supple and soulful. Instead, the group are hurt by its selection of producers and songwriters. En Vogue have decided to work with Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy only occasionally on EV3, choosing to hire such professional songwriters and producers as Babyface, David Foster, Diane Warren and Ivan Matias, who arranged their hit single "Don't Let Go (Love)." At times, these pairings work: Babyface's "Whatever" is funkier than his previous work, and Matias brings a gospel-drenched sensibility to his songs. In the cases of Warren and Foster, they reshape En Vogue as an adult contemporary band, sapping the group of any of their energy or style. Still, there are enough strong moments scattered throughout the album to make it worth the wait. 
 
Amazon Review:
En Vogue's last album, 1992's Funky Divas, was one of the sexiest and most stylish R&B efforts of the '90s, but the divas just don't deliver this time out. Part of the problem may be that the quartet has been reduced to a trio with the departure of Dawn Robinson; the rest may be that longtime producers and svengalis Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy have taken a back seat to hired hands from outside, including the ubiquitous and always bland Babyface. Maybe we've seen too many other hot girl groups in the years in between, or maybe this collection of tunes is just a dud. But there's no denying that "Don't Let Go (Love)" lacks the spark of "My Love (You're Never Gonna Get It)," "Free Your Mind," and most of the other tracks on the last album-and unfortunately, it's the best this new collection has to offer.
