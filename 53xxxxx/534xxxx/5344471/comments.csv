Very good upload and good quality too. Thank you again :) "
[T],Smokey9t9,2010-02-08T21:11Z,Pete Duel was great. The camera loved him and he had great chemistry with Ben Murphy. It was a real tragedy when he committed suicide. The show was never quite as good with Roger Davis imo although still very watchable.

I just notised that Roger Davis is in episode 2x04 as well, playing a bad guy :)"
