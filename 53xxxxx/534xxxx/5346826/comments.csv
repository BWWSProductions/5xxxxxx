8.8%...
pay attention, there are NO SEEDERS.

,RAPTUR3,2010-11-03T13:08Z,"Hey guys, how do you go about burning this to a disk? on a DVD-ROM?"
,AoF,2010-12-17T02:55Z,"Rapture,

You need to buy a couple of blank dvd+dl dics, its been awhile since I done this but you need to download this .iso file and burn it to the disc using imgburn and then you can put it in your 360 and play it"
