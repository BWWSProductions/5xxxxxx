,wotskie,2010-04-06T18:29Z,"I downloaded both discs but when I mount it it says:
Plaats de originele CD/DVD in plaats van de backup (1000). which mean the following: place the original CD/DVD instead of the backup (1000).
does anybody knows what I need to do?
if its not working, i wont sacrifice a DVD for it."

,granzon,2010-05-07T19:05Z,"For this iso to work using daemon tools lite (my version is 4.35.6) just go under preferences and deactivate automount, then go manualy to dvd and run setup.exe. It seems that when it automounts securom automaticly scans your computer and you cant install the game, but when you deactivate automount securom doesn' t start and you can install what ever you want. Hope this helps to you guys. And syrisstrife thanks on this torrent."
,Carishnicka,2010-05-20T01:57Z,Anyone else tried disabling the 'automount' on Daemon Lite and still not have it work? I'm still getting the Securom error message. Anyone figure out a way around this?
,Gkkiux,2010-06-23T11:58Z,"If you get a securom message, select settings and turn off securom. At least I haven't selected it and I don't get any error messages"
,SpermCell,2010-07-22T08:55Z,"I deactivated SecuROM and automount, mounted the disk, and activated setup.exe. Still doesn't work, any ideas?"
,SpermCell,2010-07-22T09:42Z,"Perhaps I should mention, GOTY1 brings up the oblivion launcher when mounted to daemon tools. Not sure if that matters, but it seems odd to install when apparently my only choice is to uninstall nothing. Of course, I just close the launcher and run setup.exe and SecuROM intervenes, even though it's deactivated."
