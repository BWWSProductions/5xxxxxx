--  Oblivion: Game of The Year Edition --

I ripped this iso straight from the DVD-R, which is what you'll need.


---INSTRUCTIONS----

Make sure you have a program to write the iso to a DVD-R such as ImgBurn, Alcohol 120% and such.

Download both discs.

Once you are finished downloading, write both discs to a DVD-R

Put in Disc 1 and install, then put in Disc 2 when it prompts you to.

Then after installing is done, put in Disc 1 and enjoy!

PLEASE SEED!
