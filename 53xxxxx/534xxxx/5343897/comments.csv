,Spartanus,2010-02-14T20:13Z,I don't see any biathlon in there... :((
,Spartanus,2010-02-14T23:56Z,Aren't you going to release biathlon and xc-skiing from Eurosport? It seems that they are not being released at TheBox.bz. :(
,BasilBrush,2010-02-15T18:55Z,Women's Biathlon 7.5km Sprint (13th February 2010) is up at thebox.bz but not sure if they'll be doing the mens event.
,Spartanus,2010-02-15T23:43Z,"Ok, they are just slow then. :)

If they aren't going to do the xc-skiing, are you going to do them?.."
,BasilBrush,2010-02-16T10:31Z,"16-Feb-2010 9am
I'll put the cross country individual events (10km women and 15km men) up later today.

On the BBC last night they devoted about 5 minutes to cross country. Eurosport switched over to the downhill race before the womens x-country event had finished, so I'm capturing the repeat this morning which hopefully will cover more of the events. I didn't see last nights mens event as I was busy with other stuff."
,BasilBrush,2010-02-16T10:35Z,"The problem is the thebox.bz don't allow British Eurosport as it's not a British production company.

The problem is that the BBC coverage is chopping and changing all the time where as Eurosport coverage is almost constant."
,Spartanus,2010-02-16T17:35Z,"Well could you then perhaps continue uploading xc-skiing races here, like you used to do? Why TheBox.bz?.."
