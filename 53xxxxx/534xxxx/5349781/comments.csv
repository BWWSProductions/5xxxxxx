,hudharam,2010-02-13T10:34Z,"Hi, I am using jeppview for a while now and I have both 1.6 and 3.6 version. I recently upgraded to windows7 and for some reason I cannot activate jeppview now. I installed the programme, activated it with R00d-Kcab and then updated using 09 cycles upto the latest 0310. .. As soon as i updated the latest ECD it deactivated and give me the 30 days to use it. Now i can not even activate it again using site keys. It doesnt accept it anymore.. Please help ... the older version works fine with rolling back the computer date or changing chart end date in the chart.ini file. Any suggestions how to activate it again ?"
,PROSTOPROSIRENO,2010-02-15T10:15Z,"C:\Jeppesen\Common\TerminalCharts open Charts.ini add 50 to DATABASE_BEGIN_DATE and add also 50 to DATABASE_END_DATE and period will be prolonged another 3 months, afther that repeat procedure and so on"
,PROSTOPROSIRENO,2010-02-15T10:17Z,"Sorry I didn't notice that you understand procedure with chart's ini, maybe something else
Thks for understanding"
,john2088,2010-02-19T05:39Z,Sorry I deactivated R00D-KCAB with Jeppesen 
,PROSTOPROSIRENO,2010-02-19T18:12Z,"Like hudharam the same problem appeared in my Win7 with deactivating R00D KCAB, but I did nothing to do any reason for it.
Any Ideas"
,Amerialb,2010-02-21T01:12Z,"For any1 who wants to know, I installed windows 7 32bit extreme version and used this jeppview version http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5261562/FSX_FS2004_-_-jeppesen_Jeppview_3.5
and after installing the 0901 cycles I went straight to this cycle 1003 and installed it with poweriso and it installed great no hang ups. I didn't even need to change my computers date.

Now you need to be patient with windows 7 it has a little glitch in its giddyup but works great. "
,ocilg,2010-02-23T07:28Z,"As per my comments in 1001 I had to adjust the date on windows 7 to 12-31-2008 do the entire install and then put it back after the install was done.  It worked,but the main hangup was the date."
,bowen737,2010-02-26T20:45Z,Hi every one i've a prob with the activation exactely with the site key can anyone help  please ? thanx 
,ocilg,2010-02-28T02:30Z,"@bowen737
did you reset your date on your computer? r00d-kcab should work You may need to reinstall from earlier 0720 and have the date on your machine set back then upgrade.  Or you may get you have 00 days left.  "
,bowen737,2010-02-28T12:36Z,Yes i get the 00 days left what should i do in this cas ? 
,thiagostork,2010-03-02T03:24Z,"The cycle 03 have already released?
The cycle 03 normally is released in half of mouth."

,navidh,2010-03-03T14:28Z,"when I go to activate by phone and put the code in, it the NEXT button is grayed out. I cant choose it?
what should I do?"
,ocilg,2010-03-03T19:47Z,"@navidh and bowen737,
I had the same problem, to fix i just uninstalled all the jepp stuff, and also Deactivated the numbers, start over again, reset your system calender to like 12-31-2008.
Start the install from like 0720 or so, then put the serials in, try to run it so you have to put in r00d-kcab make sure its in.  Then upgrade  to like 0808 i think, run it get in make sure everything is working, then pop in the 1003 or 1004 it should work there.  If anyone sees anything i mis posted please correct me im fairly new also.  

Dont forget the newer folders for vista and windows 7 
C:\Users\(usernamehere)\Jeppesen

and airplane files go in 
C:\Users\Public\Jeppesen\Common\Aircraft"
