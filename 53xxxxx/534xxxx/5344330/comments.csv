You may be pleased to know the sequel ""World Without End"" is here already.  I recommend the follow-up with the caveat that it may or may not be as good; depending on perspective but my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
,neshaminy,2010-02-08T00:17Z,PS: Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series (published in the UK as Cross Stitch) seems to be available here to provide another journey to 'Olde England'.  I couldn't get past the 'bodice ripper' aspect of Outlander but obviously the author found a market since she tapped out 7 of the tomes and they've all found their way to Pirate Bay.  
,azoozz,2010-02-08T03:32Z,Thanks I will check out the sequel....
