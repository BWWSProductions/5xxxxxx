The Pillars of the Earth tells the story of Philip, prior of Kingsbridge, a devout and resourceful monk driven to build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has known...of Tom, the mason who becomes his architect - a man divided in his soul...of the beautiful, elusive Lady Aliena, haunted by a secret shame...and of a struggle between good and evil that will turn church against state, and brother against brother.

A spellbinding epic tale of ambition, anarchy, and absolute power set against the sprawling medieval canvas of 12th-century England, this is Ken Follett's historical masterpiece.

This book runns for 40 hrs+. Great for the LONG haul. I loved this book and learnt a bit of what it may have been like to live in the 14th century....A bath once a week sounds a bit long though..lol. hope you love it as much as I did.Also excellent narrasion by John Lee. He will suck you right into the story the way he reads it. A must have audio book.
