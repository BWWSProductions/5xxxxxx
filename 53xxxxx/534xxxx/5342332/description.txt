Inside the Great Magazines takes us on location, to the editor's suite, the photo shoots and the parties of the worldâ€™s great magazines.

The series reveals the brilliance, tensions and conflicts of the people who make the magazines. From the established players like Vanity Fair, Playboy, Time, Paris Match and Rolling Stone, to upstarts that are defining the cutting-edge like Wallpaper* and InStyle, the inner workings of these magazines are captured and revealed.

(Part1 has glitches in second half. Local was using power tools and ruined capture session!  I will reshare a better version if I can get it)
