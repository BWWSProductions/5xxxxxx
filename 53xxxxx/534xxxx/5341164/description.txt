If you do not know what this game is about, I believe you shouldn't be allowed to download this torrent, but if you really have no idea what its about thats why google is still up.  This torrent contains CD1 and CD2, as well as some cracks you might need.  I did not unRAR the cracks because I forgot, (sorry), but the passwords for the file that ends with all in one is www.gameloo.info, and the other I don't think has one.  I downloaded this in several parts from another site, combound the parts into one .iso file for you and put them in a torrent.  This can be burned to dvd, (CD1 requires a dual layer dvd, aka and 8 gb dvd, but CD2 can be burned with a regular 4.7 gb dvd).  If you do not want to burn the dvds, just extract the .iso and install by running setup.exe.  If you have any other questions just post them in a comment here and I'll do my best to answer them.  Thanks for downloading and have fun!
