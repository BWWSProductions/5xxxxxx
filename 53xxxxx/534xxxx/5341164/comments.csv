  instead.  Once downloaded, follow the directions below.  I had several errors and the directions were not as helpful as I would've liked.

1. Install patch/game.

2. Open the zone file from the crack folder, open english, COPY/CUT those files into the origional zone folder from the 

game data. 

3. Replace the miles folder in the original folder with the miles folder from the cracks folder.

4. Overwrite, (but I'd back up just incase), game files in the origional folder with crack files from the crack folder, 

(only those files found in the cracks folder).

5.  RUN FAH.exe.  
(installs Folding@home which utilizes spare CPU cycles to conduct scientific research***)"
