""Browse to the user data folder located at C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\S.T.A.L.K.E.R - Call of Pripyat 
or if you're using windows 7 like me, you can just go to Libraries\Documents\S.T.A.L.K.E.R - Call of Pripyat

Then just delete everything in that folder including any subfolders. Then run the game and it should be working."""

,gobarboss,2010-03-26T02:06Z,You cannot use WinRAR for these 001 files. Use 7zip. I worked it out as I've seen such torrents before. Hope that solves your problem.
,darko71,2010-06-04T17:04Z,"Razor 1911, I know you`re very good. Ihardly wait to play this game. I played it in some russian version, but if this is in english 100%, I say thank you in advance. "
,OneTwoWilliams,2010-07-30T03:25Z,"PLEASE BUY THIS GAME, this game is amazing, AND they only released it on PC, if you want the PC game market to continue (because lets face it consoles are killing it) then you need to support it by buying the games, ESPECIALLY the made for PC only games like this great title."

,zzzmok,2011-06-26T14:28Z,"CanÂ´t figure it out!

Game wouldnÂ´t start after installing, then used 2 different crack fixes, but when i tried to re-install the game it sais ""Wrong disc inserted.
Please insert the original ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat"" CD/DVD.""

And when i tried to start the game it sais ""xrNetServer.dll is missing on your computer, re installing the program could fix this problem""

Could anyone help me out with this?"
,Kebabyuchenko,2011-06-28T15:48Z,"@zzzmok you need to download the patch as well mate.

 There is a folder in here called ""Patches"". copy the ""xpatch_02"" and paste it into your bin folder. It worked for me. Im running an i7 920 and a Geforce GTX 470 on Win64 with 8G of RAM. I had so many problems with this game before i started tinkering around. Hope it works for you!"
,OxTiD,2011-09-09T19:05Z,"@Kebabyuchenko

,ironymon,2011-12-12T21:33Z,"Since when consoles are killing pc's. My single gpu costs more than two xbox 360 alone. Everyone knows u can pirate any game on pc hassle free... now consoles.. you buy it cheap but games cost 1/3 of the console ""the good ones"". You gotta mod and chip so just it could run the game in white and black or a bit better. I'm not talking about constant disc reading, that poor laser dies every 2 years or so... thank satan there is harddrives now."
,BoomkaE,2012-01-23T16:58Z,"Ive downloaded this three times.First two times on my external HDD directly,third normally,on my PCs HDD.Whenever I try to extract,it sends me error when it gets somewhere around 90%-99%;""some file is damaged or corrupted"".By the way,only some files are opened with winrar by default.
No errors during download third time.
Any ideas how to solve this?"
,alphanish,2012-03-14T04:54Z,I am new to this things. can someone help me on how to actually play the game. i already downloaded 7zip but when i try to extract files it gives me an error. i am very confused
,thejastsk,2012-03-20T14:19Z,"plz give me a solution, i cant open any of the files in it"
