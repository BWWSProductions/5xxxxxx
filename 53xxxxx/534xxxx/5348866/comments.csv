,neshaminy,2010-02-12T12:09Z,"Thank You for the share.  Unfortunately ""The Road"" is a book title now associated with the work by Cormac McCarthy whereas what you are describing was not the awarded the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction in 2006.  You may want to remove Cormac McCarthy's name from your title.

This is not to say the book you uploaded isn't good but Cormac McCarthy is one of the greatest novelists of the modern era."
