great soul music
especially her "beggar for the blues" & two coversongs "hard to handle" & "fever"
i like the bassplaying...

btw.: can somebody tell me if this is james jamerson or bob babbit playing the bass on the above mentioned songs?
although it's cpitol records these sound like some motown-recordings with the funk brothers...
