I've got ver 13.0.0.5055 and when I try to install this Plus Pack I get the following message:

""To install Plus Pack for Acronis True image 2010, the following component (English version) must be previously installed:

Acronis True Image Home 2020 (13.0.6053)""

Any suggestions gratefully received. :-)"
,narfdude,2010-03-15T08:19Z,"This came out at the same time as build 6053. Get that version then try to install the plus pack. 

Here is the url to the one I got: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5176454/Acronis_True_Image_Home_2010_v13_Build6053_serials(Murlok)

You can probably install it without uninstalling your old one and keep your settings.
Hope it works for you."

Will try what you suggest and report back. :-)"
