__________________________________________

Many people only know Dead or Alive for You spin me round 
and thisYouthquake album which is a shame because they've 
released so much good stuff over the last 20 years or so.

That said, this is a lesson in how to serve up polished 
pop dance music with an edge, You spin me round is of 
course as perfect as pop music can be.
 
It would have been so easy to come up with 10 carbon copies 
of that - especially with Stock Aitken Waterman twiddling 
the production controls. 

However, Dead or Alive write their own songs and this album 
pre-datesthe production line of faceless puppets that SAW 
later churned out.

There are four Top 30 hits on this album - Lover come back 
to me,In too deep and My heart goes bang joining You spin 
me round. 

The album tracks are also excellent without exception - it's 
hard to believe that the brilliant DJ hit that button didn't 
become a single too.

You can't get a better pop dance album than this, it just 
isn't possible to give it any less than five stars!
