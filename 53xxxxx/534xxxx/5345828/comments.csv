,penandpike,2010-02-09T00:30Z,"First you need to create and save a Torrent file (using uTorrent for example) with the content you want to upload.
 then press the upload link at Pirate bay and specify that exact torrent file that you have just created.
write down some info, input the code from the image and pres Add to index.
So now that you have uploaded the torrent file to the tracker you must download it from it.
Download the torrent and make sure you 'tell' your torrent program to save the data to the folder where is the content you're trying to upload. The program will recheck the content and voala "

[T],kriss_kringle,2010-02-09T02:18Z,"I know how to upload on TPB but the thing is that I can't with this big collection.When I push add to index it loads for a few seconds and then I get a white screen like the connection is lost and in the left corner it says done.I don't know what it is,I thought there was something different to do when it comes to bigger file size."
,penandpike,2010-02-09T03:29Z,"nothing different at all!
Perhaps not a good internet connection with 
 the Pirate bay"
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-02-09T14:14Z,"Well when I upload sizes of 2-3 gb it works just fine but with that 35 gb collection it's like it's too big or something to process it.Oh well,thanks anyway."

is the quality good on this really!?
usually 2h of 1080p is about 8gb..."
,gr3gp,2010-10-10T06:00Z,I often wonder if people know how P2P sites work whenever I start getting a 17kb DLs. Restricting the bandwidth only makes it harder for everyone else to dl and then seed! A 4g file SHOULD NOT take A WEEK to DL!!!!
