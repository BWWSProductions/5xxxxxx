Anders Manga is an artist, songwriter, and producer hailing from Charlotte, NC, who has released and self produced 5 albums since 2005.

His music has been described as a blend of rock, industrial, Dream Pop, Goth, EBM and 80â€™s influences into a modern, melodic electro-rock sound. Some reviewers have described it as â€œGothtronicaâ€ while Anders simply refers to it as â€œElectronic Rockâ€.

Regardless of the genre you wish to classify his music, the listeners continue to grow worldwide on a daily basis. In 2007 Anders was nominated for â€œBand of the Yearâ€ by Gothic Beauty Magazine readers alongside Lacuna Coil, Skinny Puppy, and an artist he lists as one of his earliest influences, Gary Numan.
