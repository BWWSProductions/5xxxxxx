,Lucky13s,2010-02-13T06:48Z,"Great game, finished it this week. Downloaded, installed, applied crack, absolutely no problems.

Although it does lack some of those finer things from the previous games, the major upgrade on the world itself and the A-Life is just awesome. Finally they added in unscripted random occurences that the modding team tried so hard to add to the previous games.

I did find this game a little to easy though, I mean, at first it was kinda tough but as you progress, its soooo easy to make money, and you can just get nimble to order you in the best shit in the game right at the start. Halfway through the game I had all the best gear, 2/3rd upgraded (cant upgrade the last 1/3rd till pripyat), playing on master mode, found it way too easy.

When you hit pripyat, the game gets even easier because its throws a 1 hit kill gauss rifle at you and because its so easy to make money you just buy infinite batteries for it, anything that gets in your way is dead 1 hit kill. Also the exoskeleton can be upgraded to let you run, which makes you now a running tank, instead of a walking tank like the other games.

Even though I did find it pretty easy and a pretty unbalenced, I still really enjoyed just exploring the zone. Hopefully a modding team will release another mod that ups the difficulty and balences out the game a bit more."

The game itself isn't that great at all, very comparable with the previous two in the series. Graphics are so-so, and the gameplay is a bit.. Sturdy, I guess. They did a better job at recreating the actual Chernobyl atmosphere this time though! And that atmosphere is the single  reason why I play this game. Can't get enough of this setting, even though I have been in Chernobyl in real life already!

,iCEE_Shodan,2010-03-07T11:19Z,"Windows 7 Pirates, my solution for the fsgame.ltx problem is the following:

copy your fsgame.ltx from the pripyat's main folder to your desktop

open this file and at the end of the line

$app_data_root$         = true | false | C:\Users\Public\Documents\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Call of Pripyat\

add ""bin"" just that it states:

$app_data_root$         = true | false | C:\Users\Public\Documents\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Call of Pripyat\bin

Save these changes by pressing ctrl-s. Now copy the new desktop fsgame.LTX-file back to the pripyat main directory overwriting the previous not correct file.

Now you can run stalker from Stalker-COP.exe and it will surely work. So don't call me surely, but a thanks would be nice.

Enjoy and buy the game eventually."

When I start the Stalker-COP.exe file, it crashes. I found out why.

C:\Users\Public\Documents\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Call of Pripyat
- is where the file is located. Alot of fixes include deleting this file before you start the game up, but this also sets the renderer to DX8 (Static Lighting). If I start the game, edit that setting to anything else, I won't be able to start the game again without deleting the user.ltx file. This will also clear all my other settings, including keybindings.

If I wanna keep the rest of the settings, I open my user.ltx file with any texteditor, locate the renderer command and delete it.

This will of course make the game use DX8 and look like shit, so if anyone found a way to run it in anything else than that, please tell me."
,Ricaz,2010-03-19T04:26Z,"Quick resume on the x-ray engine error:
On some Windows 7 computers, you won't be able to start the game in anything but DX8 (Static Lighting).

This is why deleting user.ltx helps. When you start the game, it generates a config that uses Static Lighting.

The command for this is ""renderer"" in user.ltx. Change it to ""renderer renderer_r1"" and the game will boot all fine."

I've tried many of the posted solutions, even reinstalled game couple of times and tried removing SecuRom but this one worked for me. Thanks again.

Here are some solutions i found during my research that my just work for you. Check out http://www.gamebrood.com/2010/02/06/stalker-call-of-pripyat-pc-crash-freeze-launch-errors-drm-issues-wont-load-fix-and-fixes/ and check out http://sunil-bhaskar.blogspot.com/2010/08/call-of-pripyat-complete-fix.html

I just might add that first fix mentioned above made my game play flawlessly. I do not need to reset settings every time I run it(delete everything from C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Call of Pripyatand folder)

Forget about the crack, you can actually run the game without any problems by downloading a mini image for Virtual CD v10. Here's how:
1. Go to gamecopyworld.com and look up ""STALKER""...then click on the second option: GameCopyWorld - S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat / Ãâ€”ÃÂ¾ÃÂ² ÃÅ¸Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¿Ã‘ÂÃ‘â€šÃÂ¸ - NoCD No-CD No-DVD Trainers & Game Fixes

2. Up top in the ""Index"" click the second option (â€¢S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat [MULTI5] No-DVD/Fixed Image)

3. Then click the blue square next to ""File Archive [69KB]""

4. Choose a mirror and download wherever you'd like.

5. Open the .rar file, you'll find yet another .rar file within it. Open it as well.

6. Extract ONLY the VC4 Folder.

7. It has 2 files:
NS-SLKR_SR-poseden.000
NS-SLKR_SR-poseden.vc4

8. Highlight both files and drag them simultaneously into Virtual CD v10.

9. Last but not least, it is very important that you mount this mini image to your PHYSICAL drive, so that the PC thinks it's an actual CD.

10. Run the game with the ORIGINAL .exe file, NO CRACK NEEDED!

11. If you don't have Virtual CD 10 look it up and download from TPB.

,artheist,2011-03-05T15:22Z,"To avoid the crashing and bug when starting the game via Stalker-COP you have to delete all the files (except savedgames!!!!) from C-> users -> public->documents-stalker call of pripyat, everytime you are about to start the game and than adjust the settings again or it will look like shit. Theres no other way to avoid the bug. Sometimes it will take you few tryes to make it but thats the price we all have to pay for having it for free from torrents"

""C-> users -> public->documents-stalker call of pripyat, everytime you are about to start the game and than adjust the settings again or it will look like shit...""
You were right but I noticed the game is trying to save and define the setting you have it set to. From there I took a further look into document files as you mentioned. Made the change to write as supposed to read only then the game works with your settings and no quiting with errors this time. I assume your are on Win 7. Try that for those who had same issue, it works for me everytime.
Futher more please refer to @kaverdinho this guy has that other problem of starting the game up resolved. 
Thanks guys,
Enjoy."
,cc101,2011-04-18T18:44Z,"the game works great, tbh even in DX8 this still makes for some really good playing.

but i'm 2/3 through (just going to pripyat) and the game crashes every time. tried a few workarounds but nothing, anyone else get this? "
,Daputti,2011-04-22T14:31Z,"The .iso is fine but the crack is faulty. Changing graphics settings causes the game to crash on next boot.

Replace the crack with http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?c=95931&d=2010&f=rzr-stcf!7z

Provided you installed the game correctly, this crack should work better. It's a Razor crack too, just a fixed version."
,Daputti,2011-04-22T14:33Z,"Okay so hotlinking didn't work - you'll have to find the crack with these instructions

1) Google ""call of pripyat gamecopyworld""
2) Click on first link
3) Click on the third link on the list that says ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat v1.6.02 [MULTI5] No-DVD/Fixed EXE""
4) Download and replace old .exe"

,Drugoh,2011-07-01T20:25Z,"Now here's the problem. The steps are pretty easy. Download, Mount, Install, Copy crack. But the crack is outdated. And so is the crack from gamecopyworld. When you use that crack, some sort of Stalker cmd screed pops up and the game freezes. You have to open task manager and end the process. The game won't start. Don't tell me I'm the only one facing this issue"
,qualitythumper,2011-07-08T20:00Z,"Ok i've got a problem that i haven't seen anyone else with. ok So, i mounted the image and ect,half way through the installation i got a Error and i could Abort-Retry-Ignore so i clicked ignore thinking nothing off it. so the game starts works fine and great explored the place then when i got to the ship(the first place where u get Quests) i noticed the ship didn't have any texture and alot off stuff dont :( so please wtf do i do?"
,Millor1,2011-07-13T06:28Z,"torrent works fine, no problems installing... But... The game is running pretty crappy for me, I don't have to great of a computer, but I can play games like far cry 2 or fallout new vegas on medium settings just fine. But pretty much every setting I run this game on, which has worse graphics its pretty damn choppy. Its actually worse inside of buildings than outside of them in a field or something. So I'm just wondering why the game is so laggy, is there an update I need to get or some fix I need to make?"
,torrentman321,2011-08-02T04:00Z,"SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!!!!!

When i install the game it works fine up untill it gets to the file ""resource.db2"" it says its corrupt or something and some of the textures are a dark blueish color and my map it the same so if someone can help me i would greatly appreciate it!!!!!

other than that great torrent!!!!!"

,ChaosZDH,2011-10-28T13:56Z,"Hey guys its working fine for me and im using the crack it came with.....

1. Make sure ya copy the crack to the (BIN) folder.
2. Do not try to start game with the crack....it will fail go back 1 to the main game dir and start the game with Stalker-COP.exe

Step 2 got me at first...lol. The crack is not the file you want to use as the running exe its just security .exe.

Again im using the crack that came with torrent and it is working fine!"
,ChaosZDH,2011-10-28T14:03Z,"Just to make it easier for some...

The crack is xrEngine.exe 
*Place xrEngine.exe in c:\program files(x86)\bitcomposer games\Stalker\BIN

**Dont run the crack.exe as it will crash instead go back to \stalker and run Stalker-COP.exe

Since im using the original crack something ya guys are doing is wrong cause working great! Just trying to help"
