Attention ladies and gentleman I am your saviour.

As you may or may not know next Sunday is valentines day and Iâ€™ve created something a little special. One of the things Iâ€™ve always hoped to do with my music is show that not all hip-hop/rap is naughty words and violent situations. I decided I would put together a little mix CD with a collection of rap tracks (and some other samples) that show the softer side, specifically the appreciation of the fairer sex. To be honest I could of just of thrown together a bunch of tracks by LL Cool J and Common but I decided to dig a little deeper into my collection (although, there is two LL songsâ€¦) (coincidently as I write this Iâ€™m also watching a 30 Rock episode which stars Mr Smith)

So for guys Iâ€™ve created a CD, injected with my patented charm, which you can give to your special lady to show much you appreciate them. For single girls Iâ€™ve created a CD which, when listened to, will hopefully refill your confidence in us and make you feel like the princesses you are. Weâ€™re not all bastards, honest.

As well as the CD you can also download the â€œcaseâ€ for it. Essentially itâ€™s a design that fills a piece of paper that will keep your CD safe and looking good. Its based on this guide (which you will want to use). There is 4 different versions. Two have a background, two donâ€™t (to save ink). One of each has the guide lines for folding correctly.

If youâ€™d like to support this please feel free to throw a little money towards the British Heart Foundation. Everyone needs a heart.

Iâ€™ll also take this opportunity to mention that Iâ€™ve set up a facebook fan page. Feel free to join.

Thanks, and happy love day.
