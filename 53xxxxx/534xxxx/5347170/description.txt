Ripped FSX CS C-130 plus extra pack 1&2...

Found it sometime ago on binaries


This is a better version compared to the earlier uploads here on TPB
those ones are half the filesize.

As far as i can tell this is the best version out there


Included models are:

C-130E
C.Mk1
HC-130
C-130J
C-130T
KC-130
C-130H French
C-130H-30
L-100-30
AC-130 'Spectre'
C.Mk3
C-130J-30

Models,VC and gauges are fully working..no wierd things except the ACE utility is not fully working but good enough imo.


just unpack in your main FSX directory and thats it.

This is my very first upload so i hope its working..just to give a little back after all those years of leeching.

comments are welcome..credits are not on me.
