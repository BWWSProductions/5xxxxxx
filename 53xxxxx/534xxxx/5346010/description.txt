Genre: Crime | Drama


Wong Jing turns on his "serious mode" and brings together Hong Kong's best acting talents for his gangster thriller-cum-psychodrama To Live and Die in Mongkok!

After his award-winning turn in The Beast Stalker, Nick Cheung is cast in the even more demanding role of Fai, a gangster who was sentenced to life for murdering a cop during his juvenile days, only to be released on parole with the help of a social worker (Chan Lai Wan) on the grounds of his deteriorating schizophrenia. But having been locked away for 30 years, Fai is finding it difficult to adapt to the fast-changing world, particularly his hometown: Mongkok. Disoriented and trapped in the notorious town of vices, Fai must find his way out of a life with a mother suffering from Alzheimer's disease (Paw Hee Ching), a hooker girlfriend (Mo Xiaoqi) with her mentally-challenged younger sister (Natalie Meng), and a malicious cop (Liu Kai Chi) hot on his tail.
