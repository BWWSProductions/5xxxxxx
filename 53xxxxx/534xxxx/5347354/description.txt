Diplo's excellent 2004 album Florida originally came with a DVD of the music put to video, made by System D-128. This dvd is amazing, but it is never included with the cd, even when purchased on Amazon, etc. So here it is, the sweetest VDJ/Video DJing possible. So download and seeeeed this shit. I don't know how to make mkv rips so please someone make one after you get this iso?
