Geogrotesque is a semi modular with a subtle rounded finish typeface. All the characters are based in the same formal principle with its corresponding optical adjustments in order to adapt the system to an alphabet for texts. 
Although the type family has a geometric or "technological" construction, the rounded finish provides it a warm appearance, making the typefaces nicer and nearby. Geogrotesque has been conceived to be used as a display typeface in publications or intermediate length texts, most of all the Thin and Ultralight weights which were meant to be used in big sizes. 
The type family consists of 14 styles, 7 weights (Thin, UltraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold and Bold) plus italics and itâ€™s available in Open Type format.
