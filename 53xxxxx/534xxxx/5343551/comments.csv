For the past three decades, many history professors have allowed their biases to distort the way America?s past is taught. These intellectuals have searched for instances of racism, sexism, and bigotry in our history while downplaying the greatness of America?s patriots and the achievements of ""dead white men.""

As a result, more emphasis is placed on Harriet Tubman than on George Washington; more about the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II than about D-Day or Iwo Jima; more on the dangers we faced from Joseph McCarthy than those we faced from Josef Stalin.

A Patriot?s History of the United States corrects those doctrinaire biases. In this groundbreaking book, America?s discovery, founding, and development are reexamined with an appreciation for the elements of public virtue, personal liberty, and private property that make this nation uniquely successful. This book offers a long-overdue acknowledgment of America?s true and proud history. "

George Washington should have been hung."

,lappaslad,2010-06-11T00:57Z,Thanks so much for posting this. This book is so much more intelligent than A People's History of the United States. Howard Zinn is the one that should be hung.

It is a good window into the mind of someone who's benefited from the capitalist system. Here in Latin America we do not have many opportunities to meet people like that."
