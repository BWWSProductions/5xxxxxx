[V],twentyforty,2010-02-07T08:09Z,"Thank you madtown. I squeeze it from 1.4 GB, to make it bearable for download. ""Nine"" before this one too (360MB from 1.4 GB). Anyone could save 2 GB just on these two movies. Ans nothing has been lost, quality-wise..."

,ijaved,2010-02-07T09:18Z,@twentyforty what are you using for compression?
[V],twentyforty,2010-02-07T09:41Z,"@ijaved: libx264 for video compression and neroaacenc for audio. All software have been either written, compiled or heavily modified by myself. 
It is second time today that I've been asked, so:

To people, I recommend MEGui or HandBrake, or mencoder/mp4box/avisynth. These software masterpieces are for free, written and maintained by enthusiasts programmers.

99.9% of other software is just a rip-of of the work these guys have been doing for years and for free."

[V],twentyforty,2010-02-07T12:02Z,"@sanyam: My friend... I have in the past, but...
It is pretty unique ""way"", strange to all people who are (let face it) a ""consumers"", with little (or less) knowledge about encoding, formats, how, which, when and so forth.

Every time I've done that it turned out to be mistake, and instead of putting what's left of my energy in finding and encoding, transformed my work into ""Howto"" do that or this, in some sort of audio-video forum/questionnaire - what this place (and my old ""home"") definitely is not and never become one.

[V],twentyforty,2010-02-07T15:06Z,"@madtown: Just finished skimming through Daybreakers.2009.R5.Noir.avi. Yes,audio is improved, but sill is thin, also sync (as always in mixing 25 fps Russian video and English line audio) is ""here we have it, here we don't"". Regarding my last week's Dayb(re)akers with shitty audio, I'll be waiting for DVD/BDrip."
