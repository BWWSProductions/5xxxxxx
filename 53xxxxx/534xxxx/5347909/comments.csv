A friend recommended this film after we both saw the new Clooney flick, The American (pretty good flick).  Now, I guess I don't need to bother..."
,capo_soprano2,2010-09-14T10:31Z,LOL then why did you read the description? DUH! 
,eyesofflys,2010-09-27T01:12Z,"You should have your eyes checked
Charles Bronson - The Mechanic - 1972"
,hbv19,2011-01-13T01:17Z,Is this movie of good cuality?
,AJNorth,2011-01-21T17:38Z,"It is a pleasure to be able to see one of Bronson's (and Vincent's) best pictures, which, curiously, doesn't seem to show-up all that often on television. 

The transfer quality is superb, both audio & video. 

Sincere thanks for this post (as well as the comprehensive synopsis).
