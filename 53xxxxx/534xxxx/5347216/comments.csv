,kreative_army,2010-02-20T07:40Z,The plugin is not showing on my Illustrator. I have placed the plugin within the Plug-ins folder but nothing. I have Illustrator CS4 on MAC.
,donkeydick121,2010-02-27T23:10Z,"Sorry kreative_army, I don't have acces to a Mac at the moment. I should imagine you have to install the plugin and tell the system where it is.

Just like you do in Windows. (Wish I had a Mac, the graphics are supposed to be much better)."
