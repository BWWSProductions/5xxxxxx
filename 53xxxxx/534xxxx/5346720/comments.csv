This is the updated Bioshock 2 Crack by Razor1911 - Apparently they left out some files in the original crack. ENJOY!

,brianxxx,2010-02-09T16:41Z,"I have been playing this all morning on my day off. Yep...bought a copy. First was good and proved itself worthy and I bought that one too. There is no need to pirate this one. Waaaaaaaaay too good. Normally I would test drive a game. Not this one.

Now STALKER - Call of Pripyat...that I will wait until they have released 2 patches at least cause their initial releases are always buggy. Full of odd breaks and crashes and shit. 

But not Bioshock. lol"

Anyway thanks for the upload AiTB. My download has not completed but i know it would work flawlessley as it always does.

If I crack this version with the reloaded crack, then would the multiplayer work?????????"

Which program do you use to download torrents?

I use Free Download Manager 3.0 build 848. The download is damn slow. And lately, I don't know why but my FDM is always crashing whenever it likes. I am getting really irratated with the crashing issue. Does anyone know the problem???"
,newgamer25,2010-02-14T17:42Z,"Help please!!!!

When I open the bioshocklauncher, the Bioshock 2 Picture appears, then it goes to a black screen like its about to start. Then it goes back to my desktop and closes Bioshock 2 without any error messages or anything relevant to errors. 

I copied the cracks over a couple of times but still the same thing happens. And yes I am seeding!!

Help please!!!! "
,PlantaBR,2010-02-14T18:07Z,"Thanks for sharing AiTB.
The download speed at the moment of this comment is slow, but I will help seeding when it finished. My upload isn't over 9000 but maybe can help the community to download.

Try the Reloaded crack. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5352654/BioShock.2.PROPER.CRACK-RELOADED

If it doesn't work then try the FTL3 Crack Fix.

The same thing was happening with me for Left 4 Dead 2 by csmania.ru. The only thing different was that the problem occurred for me when i loaded a level. I used the FTL3 Crack Fix and it worked.

May be the FTL3 Crack Fix will work for you. But try the Reloaded Crack first."

Limewire Pro 5.4.6

Make sure your ports are set correctly or be lazy like me and check the universal plug and play option for the ports in Limewire.
Also your firewall settings,
I've had up to 1.5 MB/s download on some torrents here with Limewire, depends on the crowd your connected too obviously. Too many leeching bastardos on the games.

Limewire, download from ChattChitto right here:

Thank you.  I downloaded and applied the cracks from the link you suggested.  I also put them in the activation folder.  My OS is winxp and in another set of comments related to that, it was suggested to make sure the display is set to the highest setting, which I changed.  Anyway, its working!  At least a few minutes into it!
So once again, thanks very much!"
,j-d-uk,2010-02-15T00:52Z,"Ok you nob jockies, listen up.

1. download this
2. mount it and then install it
3. install windows live
4. open this iso and copy over all files and folders from inside the razor1911 folder (you should have MP/SP folders to copy) so yes copy both of them to C:\Program Files (x86)\2K Games\Bioshock 2
5. Now you will be asked if you wish to copy + overwrite these folders & files, click this option, you want to do this.
6. Download this :
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5346782/BioShock_2_Missing_File-Razor1911
7. Downloaded 7-Zip from here :
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4700615/7-Zip_4.65_(32-bit)
8. Run 7-Zip, via 7-Zip please now locate:
BioShock_2_Missing_File-Razor1911
that you downloaded earlier in step 6.
9. Pick file ""rzr-bs2f.001"" in 7-Zip then click extract then ok.
10. In the newly extracted folder called :
""rzr-bs2f""
you'll find :Bioshock2Launcher.exe
11. Copy/move this Bioshock2Launcher.exe in to
C:\Program Files (x86)\2K Games\Bioshock 2\SP\Builds\Binaries
12. Now you will be asked if you wish to copy + overwrite this file, click this option, you want to do this for Bioshock2Launcher.exe.
13. Set up Windows live for off-line mode play.
14. Click on this file to start game :
C:\Program Files (x86)\2K Games\Bioshock 2\SP\Builds\Binaries\Bioshock2Launcher.exe
15. Now shut the fuck up moaning and enjoy the game wiliest seeding it out for a day or two.

I have Windows 7 64 bit, if you have a different OS think and use your brain for a workaround."
,j-d-uk,2010-02-15T01:18Z,"You fuckin what?
You want Windows 7 Ultimate too you say!

Well get yourself a double sided DVD, download this bitch :
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5182426/Microsoft_Windows_7_Ultimate_Retail(Final)_x86_and_x64
Burn the bitch to the double sided DVD you purchased earlier with (Power ISO) found here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5155032/Power_ISO_v4.6_keygen
and burn at the slowest speed too and verify too!

Turn off your computer and alter its BIOS settings to boot from your DVD drive. Insert the DVD and reboot to it and follow the instructions.
WARNING! Back up all important folders and files as installing a new Operating System via this DVD will compleatly wipe your hard drive.
But hey you'll now had Windows 7 Ultimate 32 or 64 bit, your choice!"

I am getting only a average of 20 KBps on this torrent with FDM. I even used utorrent and BitTorrent but they were nit as fast as FDM. I have downloaded 37% and don't want to download it all over again. So i will try limewire next time. And what do you mean by setting the ports correctly???

I can get a maximum of 200 KBps with my net connection. You are really lucky that you get 1.5 MBps..

And I use Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit."

Try the Reloaded Crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5352654/BioShock.2.PROPER.CRACK-RELOADED

I don't know that if MP will work or not if we crack the razor 1911 version with the reloaded crack but the MP in the Reloaded version works.

So please try it and give comments if it works or not. I would have tried it but my download is 37% completed and is damn slow.

Good Luck"
