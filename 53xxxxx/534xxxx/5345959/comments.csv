,Ezlin,2010-04-07T02:02Z,"Just to let everybody know, the multiplayer maps have been ripped out. Videos and other files are untouched. Also, you can't change your install directory for this one, there was a problem with the script used to do this that Freeman G Ripper has fixed in later rips. You will need to replace the script file with one that works. You can find a working one on TPTB website (in the comments for this torrent)."
