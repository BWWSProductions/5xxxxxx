,Receptionist,2010-05-16T06:04Z,@SOLOinc 17 seeders and 210 leechers is probably the big problem
,spongebobsquarekecks,2010-12-24T17:33Z,"definatly not 1080p and would hazard a guess it is more like dvd quality, took ages to d/l and afetr all the time i waited was very disappointed at the quality NOT 1080P MORE LIKE DVD"
,Rage.Quit,2011-06-02T09:51Z,"@spongebobsquarekecks don't be a troll, this is 100% 1080p, quality is perfect and if you have DVDs of this quality I would suggest they come in a Blue box and are called Blu-Ray!! idiot. CHD is a great provider of seriously good quality films so don't suggest otherwise you idiot."
,IndigoAK,2012-06-01T10:28Z,"He actually has a point.  The first film at least is not the original Blu-ray unless the original Blu-ray has the location titles cropped off (which I doubt).  If you watch the beginning of the very first film where they show the winter shot of the CIA building in Langley, you can hear the sound from the titles appearing on the screen, but they don't actually show.

I'm guessing this is the DVD release upscaled and then cropped/letterboxed."
