Oscar-nominated director Donald Wrye takes
the helm for this remake of his own 1979
ice skating melodrama staring Robbie Benson.
An overnight success in the hyper-competitive
world of figure skating, Alexis Winston
ditched her hometown boyfriend in a bid for
superstardom. Alexis is at the top of her
game when she's suddenly blinded in a tragic
ice skating mishap. Her spirit broken, the
fallen figure skater seeks the love that
will help her lace up her skates, and reach
for her dreams.
