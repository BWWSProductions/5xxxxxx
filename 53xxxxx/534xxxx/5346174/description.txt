Re-upped due to accidental deletion! (D'oh!)



Trailers 1, 2 & 4 = 1280 x 720

Trailer 3 = 480 x 250

Bitrate (all) = 2820kbps



As far as I know these are all the theatrical trailers. The only one that's missing is the TV spot which I omitted due to its rather poor quality and its similarity to trailer #4.



Please seed!
