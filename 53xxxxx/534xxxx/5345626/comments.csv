,stixdogg,2010-05-25T18:39Z,also.. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5417331/Ludacris_-_How_Low_%282010%29_JB59 has better audio and video quality. and my bad about it ending early.. it appears that the song is over but then it starts over again .. must just be how the video is.. ludas work in the mirror is never done i guess lol
