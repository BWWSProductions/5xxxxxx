The Incredible Mr. Limpet

The Incredible Mr. Limpet is a 1964 American live-action/animated film from Warner Brothers about a human named Limpet who turns into a talking fish resembling a tilefish  and helps the U.S. Navy to defeat Nazis using his new "thrum", an intense noise that disrupts underwater instruments and weapons. Don Knotts plays the title character. The live action was directed by Arthur Lubin, while the animation was directed by Robert McKimson. Music includes songs by Sammy Fain, in collaboration with Harold Adamson, including "I Wish I Were A Fish", "Be Careful How You Wish", and "Deep Rapture".

Plot

The story begins before the U.S. becomes involved in World War II, before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Shy bookkeeper Henry Limpet loves fish with a passion. Rejected by the U.S. Navy and feeling downcast, he falls off a pier into the waters near Coney Island and finds he has turned into a fish. Since he never resurfaces, his wife and friends assume he has drowned.

The animated fish Limpet, complete with his signature spectacles, discovers a new-found ability during some of his initial misadventures, his "whale-busting" thrum. He falls in love with a female fish named Ladyfish, and rejects his overbearing human wife, Bessie, in the process.

Still determined to help the Navy, Limpet finds a convoy and requests to see one of his friends, George Stickel. With George's help, Limpet gets himself commissioned by the U.S. Navy, complete with advancing rank and a salary, which he sends to Bessie. He finds Nazi U-boats and plays a large part in the Allied victory in the Battle of the Atlantic.

The choice of the name "Limpet" for the main character is somewhat ironic: While limpets are aquatic, in their adult form they are nearly immobile mollusks that cling to rocky shorelines.

"Limpet" is also the name of a type of undersea Mine used by the military.
