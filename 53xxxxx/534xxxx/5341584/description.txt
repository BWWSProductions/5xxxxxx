Jesus Is Man -- for folks with faster Internet connections (or folks with slower connections and much patience) 

This is the original DVD ISO image file from Mars Hill Church, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.

From the Mars Hill Church site:

'Jesusâ€™ genealogy shows us that God works faithfully from one generation to the next. God redeems messed up families and raises up new patriarchs and matriarchs to create new family lines because of his covenantal faithfulness to and love for ill-deserving people. Four covenant heads are mentioned in Jesusâ€™ genealogy from Luke: David, Abraham, Noah, and Adam. Each points to and foreshadows Jesus, but Jesus is greater than all four. If we are born again in Jesus, we are added to his family line as well.'

run time: 55:38
