Whatever Works (2009)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1178663/

After the failure of his career, his marriage, and his suicide attempt, world-class grouch Boris Yellnikoff, spends his days insulting the small children unfortunate enough to study chess with him and irritating his still-loyal friends with his never-ending tirades about the worthlessness of absolutely everything. A former Columbia Professor and self-proclaimed genius who came close to winning a Nobel Prize for Quantum Mechanics, Boris fancies himself the only one who fully comprehends the meaningless of all human aspirations, and the pitch-black chaos of the universe. As he readily admits, Boris is not a feel-good person.

Larry David, Evan Rachel Wood, Patricia Clarkson, Ed Begley Jr, Michael McKean

Directed by: Woody Allen
