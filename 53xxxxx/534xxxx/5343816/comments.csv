,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-09T16:59Z,"Nice homophobic slur, LW."
,funkyfifer,2010-02-12T11:19Z,"Once again, as I said this before,

OMG you guys sound like a right bunch of little bitches!

TC.... DVD SCREENERS, Telecine, screener, dvdscr's, all that went right over the top of my head!

All most of us in here want to know is whether or not this particular torrent is any good!

Is it really about 'trying to release this to be one of the heroes being first on the scene'?
HEROES?
(as THEAWESOME2012 stated on yet another torrent)
A bit delusional mr AWESOME do you not think? Is that how you see yourself? A faceless HERO? HAHA YOU FUNNY GUY!

I appreciate and admire uploaders, but some people are getting carried away, we r talking about illegal rips (or wotever).
Yet all over this site we see KNOCKX2  practically stalking LOLWOX, admitting that he scans other up-loaders files to see if they actually broke any sweat and god help them if he suspects otherwise!
(Do you know noir by the way? Or are you a lone crusader) cos I have never noticed him mentioning you!
AND you have never uploaded any movie torrentts lol) GET A LIFE CREEPO!

THEAWESOME2012 actually says on another torrent 'so not only is this probably stolen it is a stolen source mislabelled!'
2 words for mr AWESOMEDUDE shit & stirrer! (homophopic?)
So what is the issue again?
Stolen torrents, stolen from stolen torrents, stolen from the movie makers (somewhere down the line) HAHA

The way I see it is if there are 2 people with the same (or similar) torrent on offer, and 400 people want it, is it not better if two people are offering it?
Please tell me if I am missing something!

And one very lovely uploader, mentioned every time by KNOCK,  even says 'Love for All and Sharing is the first step to solving all the problems of humanity,
'No credit for me...credit to EVERYONE for sharing' and 'credit Noir BIG TIME & to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone!

NOIR is a huge up-loader yet he never once mentions anyone copying or whatever!

Whats your dilemma knock, you come accross as a little bit obsessive verging on creepy, im not even goni describe the mental image I have of you!
I may start watching you and commenting on your pisspot comments, see how long it takes you to get pissed off with it. Just a thought DUDE

So, basically, get a grip BITCHES, if u want to comment on the quality of the film, bash on, cos to tell you the truth, when I get up tomorrow, I will probably not even remember any of the names I just quoted!
except KNOCK!
So this movie GOOD or BAD? Cos if I see anything else its just like blah blah blah to me!
 And its getting very monotonous very quickly"

As Knock said you are painfully obviously new to the torrenting world and the unwritten rules that go by it.

""'so not only is this probably stolen it is a stolen source mislabelled!'""

You say this but you won't be long bitching when you download a torrent of LW's that is labelled a DvDrip but infact is an R5 where the SOUND is from a cam/line source making it a falsely labelled torrent. How would you feel if you were downloaded maybe once in a blue moon with a limited bandwith you get each month and you have to put up with a shit out of sync copy or audio that is low and crappy? Free it might be but it's a waste of peoples time and so what if people should point it out like Knock does on occasion. 

And for your information if you want to know if a torrent is always guaranteed to be good quality I highly suggest raymondhome as Knock suggested you will find the torrents labelled correctly and you would know if it's got line audio or cam audio. 

As for your rant against me and Knock I suggest you at least wait till your not on your period before going into keyboard warrior mode on a pirate website rofl."
,XoLWoX,2010-02-13T00:37Z,"hey knock i just checked it your the same person 

Knock = TheAwesome2012"
,TheAwesome2012,2010-02-13T02:20Z,"Hey LW I just 'checked' that YOUR the same person

LW = Noir

Oh wait... that ain't right is it?"
[V],neon,2010-02-13T11:46Z,"This is like a sit-com played out on TPB...its better than a lot of tv shows.....and i like the new character funkyfifer....hilarious.
