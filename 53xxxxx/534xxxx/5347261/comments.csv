,mpaka,2010-02-09T13:24Z,"Sorry, I don't understand the crack.

I copied the plist file in and ran Terminal but to what effect?"
,ozperth,2010-02-09T23:50Z,"Yes. I'm also not clear. Doesn't work with instructions. ANyone got advice, please? Thanks."
[V],polisdavid,2010-02-10T06:00Z,"I was unclear as well, as the terminal app didn't really seem to do anything, but the program is cracked none-the-less after the steps were taken.

Perhaps the terminal app doesn't do anything, just the pref file in User/Library/Preferences is all you need.

The original crack .rtf file was written in Russian, and I couldn't translate it. 

You can get the original torrent from Mac-Torrents.com"
[V],polisdavid,2010-02-10T06:11Z,"Sorry the last message is in error, but the program worked for me and the original torrent is on demonoid so I followed up and found this info:


1. unzip the papers package and move the papers program to your applications folder
2. right click on the papers app and choose ""show package contents""
3. navigate to ""Contents"" --> ""MacOS"" folder within the papers package contents
4. now go back to the ked folder you unzipped and take the papers unix executable file and place it inside the ""MacOS"" folder you just opened.
5. move the papers registration plist file from the ked folder into ~/Library/Preferences
6. double click on the papers unix executable file to run it.
7. start the papers program and it should be registered"
,neverlast,2010-02-17T04:15Z,I tried to install with crack as per instruction in Snow Leopard but the crack file papers cannot start the app. It kept on self terminating. Any idea why?? anyone can help me on this?
,Arabbet,2010-03-13T03:49Z,"You need to DL the original packet from Demonoid.  The problem is that the actual crack file is supposed to be a terminal script, however it was somehow copied as a .txt file and so it can't be executed.  

DL the Dem packet, and follow the other instructions above (replacing the unix file in the package contents, etc. etc.).

It works beautifully, and THANK YOU JEBUS!!!  It was totally what I needed."
,Rubinek,2010-06-09T23:35Z,"Can someone please fix the terminal file.
