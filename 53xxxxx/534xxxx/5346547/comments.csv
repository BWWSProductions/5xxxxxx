,walshy22,2010-03-05T09:10Z,Is there any fix for the moving and shooting problem? The link above by iampko33 was wrong
,powerchord,2010-03-06T22:41Z,"Will someone please post a fix for the movement/ keyboard issues?
@ iampko33  . . fucking useless link. Why not post the fix right on here instead of leading people to a dead end?! "
,sadfad,2010-03-14T10:00Z,working?
,sadfad,2010-03-14T10:02Z,sorry for last post the comment section wasnt working.
,sadfad,2010-03-14T10:03Z,If anyone else has a fix for the no movement that would be great.
,sadfad,2010-03-14T10:03Z,iampko33 your a fucking idiot
,sadfad,2010-03-14T10:22Z,I found the solution for the controls if you are using vista. The two things in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. call of pripyat folder must go to a different directory. You must place shaders_cache and user into C:\Users\Public\Documents\s.t.a.l.k.e.r. - call of pripyat. I am running vista 64 and this was my idea.
,The_Breadfan,2010-03-15T05:53Z,@sadface: This works. Thanks sadface. 
,prince3557,2010-03-21T07:02Z,"downloaded perfectly,, and the game starts well..    BUT can not a shit when playing, onloy i can change a d weapon and move view through mouse...

,Weho2,2010-04-01T19:37Z,"everytime i run the extracter.exe all i get is 3 fodlers with ""arc.exe"" and ""extractor.exe"" all adding up to 263MB. Help please!"
,Weho2,2010-04-02T04:19Z,"hmm jsut found out that its a contiguous RAM problem after trying to extract ""CallOfPripyat.arc"" with a program called ""FreeArc"". i recieve the error Can't allocate memory required for (de)compression in rep:1gb, anyone else who gets this error will have to free RAM MEMORY(anti virus.. etc), and it has to be contiguous (ie. in one block)."
,Weho2,2010-04-02T08:52Z,"@matijapkc @jkarthik2k1
PROBLEM SOLVED
Downlaod ""Freearc""
EXTRACT CallOfPripyat.arc with freearc
If that doesn't work, click on ""Detach"" instead
if that doesn't work try freeing up RAM, by uninstalling some AV temporarily Have Fun! 
Thankyou globeplus! good upload!"
,Weho2,2010-04-02T10:17Z,"CREDITS TO ""sadfad"" FOR FINDING THIS!\
FOR ANYONE WITH NO CONTROLS FOLLOW THIS
You must place shaders_cache and user.ltx into ""C:\Users\Public\Documents\s.t.a.l.k.e.r. - call of pripyat"". HAVE PHUN! Good upload!"
,Weho2,2010-04-02T10:20Z,and that applies to XP users too(me)
,Ezlin,2010-04-08T21:20Z,Make sure you put the document files in the correct place or you won't be able to move. (Look above for how). I will compare this release side by side with the TPTB rip to see if I can find anything removed from this release or if this just has the better compression.
,Ezlin,2010-04-09T21:35Z,"Ok, I have figured out that videos are removed. As well as multiplayer maps I believe. If I have made a mistake here I apologize."
