Assassins Creed II Working Save Game... just the save no CRACK
play the game, but without missions...

How to install:

open up C:/ Program Files/ Ubisoft/ Ubisoft Game Launcher/ storage/ dG9taXRyZWJh /4

and delete all save files... 

next step: copy/past new saves...

you will have to clear out your save folder and plonk in the 4 saves from this torrent every time you start a new game but at least you can play it for now untill a proper crack comes along.	


next step: start AssassinsCreedIIGame.exe...

next step: When asked the Serial just click on Play/Ok	
	


If you don't want to place the saves every time you want to play.
You can just click the gear icon at the left of the minimize icon in the Ubisoft Loader, so it stops synchronizing your save with the server. If you do this, you can even save your progress using this savegame, but you can't go into missions. Remember: if you accept a mission, the screen goes white, and you can only see the HUD.
