,sgniraic,2010-03-12T03:11Z,Is this a save of a completed game? Are all places available?
,Furko99,2010-03-12T03:22Z,well I guess we should try but I'd recomend to save your previous saves if you did everything possible and have shitloads of money and nowhere to spend it like I do O.o (didn't find all feathers and glyphs in 3 aerias we had tho)
,Furko99,2010-03-12T03:28Z,"erm nope it's not 100% it's the save game that has already been uploaded...124florins, broken armor, yep it's the save game that's already been arround for a while"
,Dankyx,2010-03-12T03:52Z,"Jesus fuck can anyone explain me how to get past the fucking cd-key? >_> I keep pressing ""OK"" but it says ""THE CD-KEY IS INCORRECT""."
,Neuro109,2010-03-12T04:28Z,@Dankyx - Get an available crack and put it in their proper places. Should explain in the download what to do. Evertime Ubisoft updates you have to re-do this.
,Dankyx,2010-03-12T05:34Z,"@Neuro19: I keep following the instructions. I disconnect my net, I install it, Connect the net, Install the crack (EG: Copy the launcher in the launcher folder, copy the 2x .exe files in the ACII Folder but it keeps wanting to update the launcher and once more it keeps asking me the cd crack. If someone can help me please add my msn (Dancarlos_51@hotmail.com)."
,Dankyx,2010-03-12T06:03Z,"Nevermind. I got it, lol."
,Don.S,2010-03-12T08:19Z,"I was able to avoid white screen for just 2 secs following the discussions made here - http://forums.techarena.in/video-games/1313840.htm

If anyone can R and D more on how to avoid white screen completely it would be appreciated. Thanks"
,rocco_sifredi,2010-03-12T09:14Z,"What can I do with a save of game that does not work ?;) You don't think much , do you kid ;)...?"
,Furko99,2010-03-12T09:49Z,"@ Don.S yeah I noticed that too but I used different method..I navigated myself on the minimap all the way to that transport guy and went to Florence and white screen stoped but mission ended as well but at least I didn't have to restart my game =P and I'm starting to think that there's defenitly some sort of trigger on DRM servers that's why we have thos white screens since when you talk with mario and accept the mission I think that gamre requests a permission or smth from DRM server and after that the mission can start but if game doesn't get the permission from it than well white screen and exclamation mark and server can most likely do that douring the game since all game needs to recieve is 1 package and that's why ppl with legit copies couldn't play when servers were down since our copy only uses server to get inside the game and theirs needs to be connected all the time in order to function properly and if the connection with server is lost their game closes, ours doesn't "
,sgniraic,2010-03-12T10:42Z,"What you download from ubi's servers is encryption keys. A lot of parts of the game are encrypted, so that's why we can't open missions. If you remember when AC1 was released - there was the same problem when you got to Jerusalem, but crackers managed to fix it. I don't know where legit customers got their encryption keys back then though. But now they are on ubi's servers which of course is a pain in the ass. I could be wrong, but what I think the crackers are busy doing is collecting these keys and not much else. Some hackers would come in handy to hack servers and get the keys in one go, if that's even possible, probably not (i'm not an expert)."
,Don.S,2010-03-12T10:51Z,"to rocco_sifredi - you are just here for freebie aint u, rather than helping or suggesting some tips, you good for nothing, go away creature and stop flaming you cunt of misery..

@Furko99 - were you able to bypass the white screen? and which save game did u use, care to share.. Thanks"
,handsomeguy,2010-03-12T11:06Z,":S  it says incorrect key all the time with me :S i reinstall all the time, and i did the crack all the time, tried skidrow, all kinds of cracks and still the same prob"
,Bixel2,2010-03-12T11:36Z,same shit thats going on for weeks!!! WE WANT FULL GAME
,miragebauer,2010-03-12T11:38Z,"@handsomeguy
LOL there's no skidrow crack thats a FAKE.
there probably wont come a crack.."
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-03-12T11:56Z,"I have a problem, I can start the game, click on m saved game, and use Desmond for 3 seconds on the weird ass white world until it fades back to the first cutscene and go thru the Animus again.

What am I doing wrong?"
,WayOne,2010-03-12T12:35Z,Furko99  LoL what you discovered was announced by Ubisoft some month ago. Yeah the game has checkpoints like mission starts or ends on which you have to be connected to the servers to get the permission to play.
,Ze3g,2010-03-12T13:14Z,"Ok, it appears that a lot of people have a problem with the CD-key verification.

When you start up the game for the first time the ubisoft launcher is updated. When it get's updated I believe the crack gets replaced again with a valid exe. Solution is to simply crack it again if you get this error.

Hope it helps, cya..."

,WayOne,2010-03-12T14:39Z,"Stop with those scene rumors or whatever. NOBODY has a contact with any release group.
 So any rumor, any info or plan... IT'S ALL FAKE! I can tell you when the crack is going to be released...

WHEN IT'S READY!

Which can be tomorrow, in a month or never."

,Furko99,2010-03-12T18:23Z,"@ Don.S 

If you mean Mario white screen...no i couldn't get passed it but I was able to turn it off but you also turn off the mission you start there and I used save game from some website thar's located under notice on 1 of the previous torrents...tho I could upload my saves but it's no use anyways since I've already done everything I could(upgrading home town, found all treasures, found all roman god statues and got some glyphs and feathers and some codexes but w'o map it's hopless to search for things since at least I always run in circles for some reason)"

,sebdhaese,2010-03-14T12:41Z,"Please, to everyone. Don't start buying this game. If this works, in the future all games will have this and it will be a pain in the ass to ever crack them. So, please, have faith. This will be cracked and the games will be free.

,M0ndos,2010-03-14T18:29Z,Can't someone just upload a save game right after the animus part?

,DofusOctopus,2010-03-19T22:45Z,"i didnt download this thanks to the feed back comments ... lol 

what i will say is... A month prior to the date released and there will be a crack!!!

ill explain how hard it is to crack!!! 

it needs an 24/7 internet connection 
so obviously! packets of data are being transfered back and forth from the servers to your computer. 

a hacking team are playing the game and recording/saving these packets' so they can impliment them into the game data files so it doesnt need the internet, its basically like writing the whole fucking game again (Screech)

but whens its done the game should be exacly what it was supposed to be like.... ""DRM FREE"" 
which makes us happy 

sorry ubisoft i would have baught your game if you didnt try and claim half of the product and my computer. 

Your are a bunch of cocks with ball bags as friends. "
