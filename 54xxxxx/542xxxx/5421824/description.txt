Allan Dwan - Tide of Empire (1929)
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020502

The film was caught in the transition to sound, so it is a silent film with music and sound effects added. It runs at the sound speed which causes the action to speed up, sometimes very noticeably.

=====================================================

The last of the major film companies to fully convert to sound, MGM had yet another box-office bomb in Tide of Empire, a would-be epic western set in the days of increasing Yankee influence in hitherto Spanish California. Based on a Peter B. Kyne novel, the film came complete with a synchronized score, but audiences were now demanding at least a few scenes of dialogue. The fresh-faced leading man George Duryea did get a stab at western stardom in the early 1930s, however, but under the moniker Tom Keene and for RKO. ~ Hans J. Wollstein, All Movie Guide

=====================================================

This beautiful mademoiselle, RenÃ©e AdorÃ©e, was born Jeanne de la Fonte, in Lille, France on September 30th, 1898. Her parents were circus performers, and young Jeanne worked in the circus along with them, riding horses in the show and doing stunts. After a stint in the Folies-BergÃ¨res, and trying her hand at some stage work, she made a film in Australia, and knew from then on that a motion picture career was her goal. She went to Hollywood and began her first film, "The Strongest", in 1920. After a series of bit parts, RenÃ©e's biggest role came when she was cast as Melisande in King Vidor's classic "The Big Parade" (1925). Her scenes in the film were extraordinary and poignant; as a young French girl saying goodbye to her American soldier sweetheart, played by John Gilbert, as he goes off to battle with his men, she was completely believable and touching. Her acting in the film rocketed her to stardom, and ensured her cinema immortality.

RenÃ©e was married and divorced twice, including a marriage to Tom Moore, brother of Owen Moore. After a series of successful silents, including "La BohÃ¨me", (1926), "Mr. Wu" (1927) with Lon Chaney, and "The Show" (1927), RenÃ©e faltered in her transition to the sound era, perhaps due to increasingly poor health. She died tragically on October 5th, 1933 of tuberculosis.
