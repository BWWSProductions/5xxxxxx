,psyllium,2010-03-11T03:03Z,"Hello, thank you for the loader,
Would you please help me with a problem?

I used it for my win7 notebook (the only changes I made from default settings was about it being an Acer) and now it starts from its (factory) sucky Vista recovery partition over and over.

In the bios setup screen (pressing esc when starting) I can change the boot device order but cannot chose between partitions, same with F12.

Repairing win start with win7 disc didnt help.

Is there a way to change back the boot to the windows partition (C:)?
I can access the registry and fool around in DOS, the loader wont run under this conditions do.

Sorry for the bother but the solution may be easy for an advenced user.

Acer Aspire with slic 2.1 and currently downloading BartPE to see if I can run the loader with it. Thank you."

,Kyoma,2010-03-12T02:56Z,i have that problem where it starts the vista recovery partition over and over again can someone tell me how to fix it plz thx
,Kyoma,2010-03-12T03:07Z,"nvm i figured it out
if anyone else gets this problem you type
bootrec.exe /fixboot in the repair command prompt"
,Quesenart,2010-03-13T18:46Z,"Worked on multiple machines for me. Here is what I did on mine, your mileage may vary.

1) Run the program, click Uninstall. When finished, reboot.
2) Run program again, click Install. When finished, reboot.
3) Right click on computer, click activate windows now. This will take you to the Microsoft activator site. Download the file and install. When that is done, click continue and your copy of windows will be activated."

,billy_on,2010-05-09T11:33Z,Its no virus and confirmed by omdhar. It can be confirmed after installation by full pc scan by any AV. Its because of LinqBridge.dll included which copies itself to current folder (linq not supported in vb.net 2.0).

,ratc,2010-08-24T02:05Z,"Worked great for me :)
I had installed Win 7, and when activating it with another loader it messed up my Vista Loader, and vice-versa. 
Then I used this one and it did the job, and it didn't mess with previous loaders/activators.
I have 5 OS's installed in 2 hisks, with 4 different boots, OpenSuse 11, 2 Win XP's, Win Vista and Win 7."
