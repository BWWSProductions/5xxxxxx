is this the game you want ? : Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3 Collectors Edition. Note that it's the Collectors Edition, but that was the version I found. Its also in PAL, I hope that doesnt ruins for you."
,ThePalindorme,2010-03-15T19:58Z,"yeah dude thats the one, and no problem if its ntsc or pal, both work.
And collectors edition probably means the ultimate version of the game.
where can i find it? Much appreciated. Thanks man."
[T],thenoobish,2010-03-15T20:37Z,"I will upload the game here :) but the upload function on tpb isnt working for the moment, it has been down for a while. I upload as soon as its up!"
,ThePalindorme,2010-03-20T10:31Z,"Dude, do leave a comment here when you upload dbz budokai 3 here.

And yeah checked your game. Works like a charm. no problems . Game 9/10.
People, download dvd decrypter from this site itself. Use it to burn the image inside the rar file on a dvd. The image is about 4 gb, compressed to 291 mb. Really great compression.

Use good company dvds like the ones from sony, amkette or mosarbaer. Its better this way, its gives a longer life to your lens.
Burn the image using iso write function and burn at 4x or 2x speed. Not more, else it may not work on old ps2s, you know those in use for a long time after repair or purchase."
