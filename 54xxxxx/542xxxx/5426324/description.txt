A home-made video for Peter Gabriel's Intruder.
This is a video we made as a school project in the fall of 2007. We are three 17/18-year old girls, Maja, Camilla and Emma. We have done quite a few movies in the past, and maybe some of them will end up here and on YT as well! We chose this song because it's scary and it rocks!
