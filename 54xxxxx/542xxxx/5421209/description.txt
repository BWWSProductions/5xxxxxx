

Finally, here it is. 

The next part in the series "Catching the impossible" part 6, "A Winters Gift".
This is the last part of three, I hope Parts 7,8and 9 will follow soon.

I found this on a newsgroup and re-encoded the VOB files into avi so it will play on PS3 and so on. I didn't want to lose any pixels ,that would be a shame,hence the lagre size.

Size : 1.9 gig., 60 min. playtime.
Codec : Avi Mpeg-4
audio : AC3  ^6 chn.
