,jace007,2010-03-13T09:18Z,"This is excellent through-and-through, thank you (hate non-720p stuff). 

Message to Satyrosjay: If you're using Vista 64, you need CCCP codec to play this mkv file (I had no problems)."
,jzaw,2010-03-13T12:24Z,"first off ...THANKS swmbo has been nagging me for this since the event !!!

but ...

it still befuddles me why ppl rar files for torrenting 

sigh!

the torrent protocol by its very nature breaks the file up into blocks each of which has checks for integrity and then theres a final check once the file is complete

some ppl argue that if a certain rar file is damaged it can be dl'd again 

but this is exactly what happens in the background in torrents 

now to seed this I've got to keep 4.37GB of rars on my hd ... and then to watch it I've got to wait aaages to unrar it and then keep ANOTHER 4.37GB on my hd 

rars are appropriate in other situations ... but not torrents 



other than that ... THANKS FOR THE FILE"
[V],GoodFilms,2010-03-13T19:38Z,You're wasting your time telling me stuff I know.
