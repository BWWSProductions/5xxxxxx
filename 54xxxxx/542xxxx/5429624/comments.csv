,sultanselim,2010-03-15T21:29Z,Cats in the cradle is actually not a cat stevens song. Think it's a one-hit wonder. Search for the songtitle in wikipedia or jfgi.
,NitLions,2010-03-16T23:11Z,"Yeah man, it is a Cat Stevens song. The other dude did a remake in like the early 90's or whenever but its an old song by Cat."
,Rishodi,2010-03-17T20:31Z,"""Cat's in the Cradle"" is a song by Harry Chapin and has nothing to do with Cat Stevens."
,domino1234,2010-03-17T21:36Z,"Cats in the Cradle is by Edmund Fitzgerald. I loved Edmund Fitzgerald's voice. Too bad he died when the ship he was on, the Gordon Lightfoot, collided with the Cat Stevens."
,Haseebv,2010-03-19T01:25Z,"Guys look I know its not Cat Stevens who sings the song, but the most popular version of it that circulates the web, is attributed (albeitly falsely) to Cat Stevens, and thus by telling NLX that it was Cat Stevens he would be able to obtain a copy of the song that is identical to the one in this episode, and then maybe if he wanted to he could find out more and more about the history of the song, who henry chapin is, who charlie chaplin was, and what hitler had to do with all of this."
,Herendil,2010-04-28T12:34Z,"""Cat's in the Cradle"" is a 1974 folk rock song by Harry Chapin from the album Verities & Balderdash.

""Cat's in the Cradle"" is widely mistakenly credited to artist Cat Stevens, in part due to a mistitled MP3 version of the song widely circulated on the internet. As well the style and vocals sound akin to a Cat Stevens song, and the song and the singer both contain the word, 'Cat'. In 1977, Stevens' former label, Deram Records released a compilation album, Cat's Cradle.[3] Jack Black contributed to this confusion, playing part of the song in a Saturday Night Live sketch where Black's character claimed the song was by Yusuf Islam, a.k.a. Cat Stevens. There are no known verifiable recordings of Cat Stevens performing the song, however, and a Cat Stevens fan web site assures readers that Stevens has never performed the song, ""not live, not in the studio, and not even privately"".

The cover of the song by Ugly Kid Joe is furthermore often confused for a cover by Guns N' Roses, a band which never recorded the song. This is due to an incorrect MP3 circulating on P2P networks; which contains the Ugly Kid Joe version even though the file credits it to Guns N' Roses."
