Recorded in a secret location in the Blue Mountains, the Spooky Men release their debut 12 track CD, entitled  Tooled Up. It features many a song from their live repertoire including "Don't Stand Between a Man and His Tool", an extra spooky version of the classic "Ghost Riders in The Sky" and a foot-stomping rendition of the Rolling Stones " I Can't Get No Satisfaction". Hey hey hey, that's what I say...
