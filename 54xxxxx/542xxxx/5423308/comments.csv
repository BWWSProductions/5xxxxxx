Really appreciate your work ..

I have a favour to ask .. Do you think by any chance you can upload a documentry calld 

'' The most dangerous man in america daniel elssberg  and the pentagon papers '' ???
It was nominated for the Oscars "
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-09T22:43Z,"Demise69: Hey back!
It's absolutely the same as 

Storyville.The.Most.Dangerous.Man.In.America.2010.WS.PDTV.XviD-FTP

only this version was aired on BBC4 and available all over the net.

Director's pair is the same, content also  (documentary is the same) just this BBC ""version"" has intro because it was part of Storyville documentary series.

So, I have it, but it seems like lot of people are confused by ""apparent"" two documentaries - what is a stupidity. Oscar nominated is, of course, not TV version, but cleaned-up one (from BBC ""residues"" and markings).
It is 97 minutes in 700 MB file, easy obtainable everywhere, and if the size isn't a problem, I'll rather skip this one."
,nicermog,2010-03-09T23:40Z,Is it possible to include Life Unexpected? Seems to be a decent show.
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-10T08:04Z,"@nicermog: Is it series good or not aside, you can see how ""overcrowded"" day of the airing is, and it makes your wish technically not possible. I can, however, and I'll try to re-encode LUn. now ans then, as I have done with few other shows with low popularity which are aired in ""wrong"" time."
