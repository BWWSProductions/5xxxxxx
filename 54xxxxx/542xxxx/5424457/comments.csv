It took me months to finally get this whole series and months later I see that people still hit-and-run.

I have a terrible connection and every byte costs a fortune but I will continue to slowly drip feed those episodes with no seeds.

It may take you months, then perhaps you will realise that without SEEDS, the whole sharing thing breaks down.

Don't be surprised if I disappear for a few days at a time - perhaps there is a lesson to be learned on SHARING ;-)"
