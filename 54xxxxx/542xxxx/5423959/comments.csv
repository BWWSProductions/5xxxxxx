,todymob,2010-03-10T20:59Z,anyone test it yet??  
,lordimotep,2010-03-10T21:40Z,"hi all,

even better!
I found out that if you press + in the configurable usb loader it gives you the option to store a DVD to the hard disk !!!! So you just enter any game into the dvd slot and it makes a backup on the external hard disk!!!  afterwards you can once again use the ""WBFS Wii FileSystem for Windows"" also included in this kit, and use the disk on your windows, and use the ""04. extract ISO"" to make a safe backup to your PC. Notice that all backups will be 4.5GB, altough they were smaller on the external HD in the wii filesystem. Also don't be suprised when extracting the ISO the percentage goes up to 48% for example and says ""done, press any key"", I first thought this was faulty but apparantly the ISO is just fine...

even more crazy: I put a NTSC game in my PAL wii that couldnt be read by read by the wii itself, launched the app and pressed + and it read just fine!! Afterwards when it was on the hard disk I launched it and it played just fine!! an NTSC on my PAL :)))

take care you'all

I have European 4.2E
Unpacked first rar file to sd card and put into wii, clicked on the sd card icon, a quick flash of load from sd card, but nothing there. Any pointers out there?
Cheers"
,spark015,2010-03-14T21:38Z,"there's 3 sets of 1st-lastSD.rar right?
so which one works??

please leave a comment if someone has tested this on 4.2u and worked...tnx"
,dalo_be,2010-03-21T16:57Z,"I tested on a 4.2E, and it worked completely! Unrar ""uwsmk42rp-imo.part1"", and then follow instructions exactly as described by the uploader. Just ran my first downloaded game on my wii (without a chip), and works like a charm!
Thanks bro!!!"
,dragonhan22,2010-04-03T07:35Z,i got a 1 tb hard drive do i really need to format it to play
,srog545,2010-05-01T11:05Z,im stuck on the last file the usb loader. i did the first three step and they went just like the instructions said it would but the last step the usb loader i put the files on the sd card and ran homebrew channel and nothing comes up but the files are on the sd card what do i do now
,link18n,2010-05-09T22:07Z,"I'm trying to use a partitioned hard drive from a computer instead of a USB drive to store the .iso files. When the homebrew channel tries to mount the drive, it times out every time. Is this even possible and how would I go about doing this? Thanks in advance."
,nick_confidental,2010-05-11T02:39Z,The bootmii file on the firstSD.rar is taking forever to upload onto the wii. Is this normal?
,Deadman161994,2010-05-17T08:06Z,"man i installed the Homebrew Channel and everything when i extrac the thirdsd and put it in my wii and lunch the bootmii the remote controler shuts down and do not re-open until i close the wii and open it again 
can you hell me by telling me the possible problems and the possible solutions?"
,KayeLynne,2010-05-25T05:40Z,"Deadman161994: I had the same problem. What I did was put the SD card back in my computer, delete its contents, unpack the second RAR on the SD and install IOS249.WAD again. Then do what the instructions say for the second RAR, it should work fine. 

Lordimotep: thanks for explaining the process better than another torrent did. Everything worked great!"
,lordimotep,2010-05-27T14:50Z,"the pack is indeed working correctly. I'm glad some of you bumped into some issues so others can read how you resolved them. 

peace guys

,spookypie,2010-08-16T03:38Z,"I'm a 40something mom, with no experience in altering game consoles.  I'm nervous about this.  In your opinion, is it something a first timer can do?  Or should I even attempt it?  

Is there any other information I should know?

Thanks so much for any advice!"
,PnutDome,2010-08-18T10:10Z,i am missing last.rar is it no longer on the upload. a place to find it would be nice. any help  appreciated
