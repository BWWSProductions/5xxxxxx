                                                    NOTES
                                                ------------- 


My last release was a hit apparantly. Afterwards a lot of my friends started asking me to help
them mod their wii. My previous release told you how to upgrade firmwares 3.0 to 4.1, thisone
will help you hack 4.2 (It got tested on a European 4.2E, but should also work on 4.2U and 4.2J)

Exactly like my previous release, this will convert an untouched wii to one that can load
backup games from an external hard disk. That's the final goal.

You need to have a SD card (doesn't matter how big) and a SD Card reader/writer in your PC or laptop.

Make sure the SD card is empty to begin with and unpack FirstSD.rar onto it.
Put the SD card in the wii and start it. 
Press A to continue to the wii-menu
In the lower left corner, next to "Wii", there's a little SD Card you can click on, do it.
It will ask you if you want to load boot.dol, say yes
A message will appear saying you shoudn't pay for the software, be patient and wait 8 secs
Press 1 to continue

Now you can install The Homebrew Channel installer, DVDx and Bootmii.
You won't need help to install the Homebrew Channel or DVDx, as it's too easy
Next click "Bootmii....", then "Install Bootmii as ios"
When done go to exit.
Take out the SD Card
Afterwards reboot your wii and you should have another icon that says 'The Homebrew Channel'

[if you want to do a NAND backup this is a good time. If you don't know how you can just
google it very easy. A NAND backup will backup your wii's structure to a SD card so it can
later be restored in case anything happens. This step is not necessary and you can just
continue this hack without doing it, altough most people recommend it]

Put the SD Card back in your pc.
Delete all files on it and extract SecondSD.rar onto it.
Put it back in your wii, go into the homenbrew channel and press the 'home' button on the remote
You should have an option there to start bootmii
A menu should load called WAD manager. 
Press A to continue and choose 'wii SD slot', A to continue
It should already say IOS249.WAD, A to continue
move arrow to the right and change option to UNINSTALL WAD, A to continue
It should say 4x OK and any key to continue
Press the home button to leave the program

You can take the SD card out of the wii again and put it back in your pc.
Delete all files on it and extract ThirdSD.rar onto it.
Again go to the homebrew channel, press home and launch bootmii
A new installer will automatically load. 
In the first screen IOS36 is already selected, this you need, so A to continue
Afterwards the next option to choose is WAD install, this also what you need, so just A to continue
So it's actually just next next next
When done it will say finished succesful and will reboot the wii

You can take the SD card out of the wii again and put it back in your pc.
Delete all files on it and extract Last.rar onto it.
Put the SD card in the wii.
Go to the homebrew channel, start it, and there should be "Configurable USB loader"

Normally you can now launch "Configurable USB loader" and play any game from usb you like, but you first need to prepare
the USB device. 

So get a USB stick of over 4GB or an external USB hard disk and connect it to your PC.
Format it completely using FAT32 filesystem. If windows doesn't allow this use Partition Magic 8.0 to format your external hard disk to it.
For USB sticks there's a tool called HP usb format tool or something.

Remember the drive letter the new formatted USB device got. 
Go to the Software folder that came with this kit and find "WBFS Wii FileSystem for Windows". 
Run it, specify the drive letter your usb device is on. Format it to WBFS.
Afterwards choose option "01. Add" to start adding .iso files. After all this is done reconnect the
usb device to the lower USB port of your wii. 

Launch "Configurable USB loader" and play the iso-game directly from USB..... ALL DONE !!

For details on installing new super mario bros see the snmb folder :)

                 I wish ALL other release groups the very best. "Scene" or not, who cares anyway?
