Back in the late 90's there was a TV personality named David Rosengarten. He had a show on Food Network called "Taste".  I don't know what happened between David and Food Network, but all of a sudden his show was gone, and aside from a few recipes he is gone off of the FN site.

There is no IMDB page for Taste, so I don't know how many episodes there are, but I present the only two I have.  The other video is "In Food Today" which was hosted by David Rosengarten and Donna Hanover.  The shows are taken from old VHS tapes, so the quality is not perfect.

If anyone has any other episodes of Taste (or other classic FN shows) please share.  If you love Taste as much as me and would like the full-sized version I can torrent it, or will even trade DVDs. If there is any interest in these classic FN shows, I also have quite a few episodes of "Two Fat Ladies" from the same era that I would be glad to share.
