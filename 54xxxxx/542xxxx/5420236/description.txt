OK Gang thanks to the original seed who has the whole DVD up on Demonoid but I have split the files into user friendly tracks and tagged them for Video DJ use.

I am pleased to tell you that the original hit music was used in each case and they lip synced back then.

Rigmar Radio uses OtsAV Pro, the professionals choice in Karaoke and Video entertainment.
