,movie_dr,2010-03-12T14:41Z,"THE DREAM10 have you tryed changing the format i have burned brooklyn onto dvd mines perfect i always change my format an size, anyway this is good but i do have to say i have had this before its very good but just thought it was new even though its dont have the V2  "
,thadream101,2010-03-12T17:47Z,"(this comment refers to brooklyns finest not this torrent)  
yes...i use Nero it automatically fits it to disk and converts it to VOB files for me...I also tried using Video enhancer to cut down each frame size and tried a few filters on vdub...nothing...people say it looks fine on their standard def. tvs but on my hi-def it looks like shit pixelated and with lines"

,TheDarkseid007,2010-03-17T08:06Z,"i have watched the movie and other than 2 spots where a person gets popcorn it is a very good telesync.

nice clear picture with the white balance a little high but was definately worth the d/l if your looking for a reasonable video of cop out.

,watbol,2010-03-30T03:22Z,"I never understood the concept of RAR in a torrent???
They are not being EMAILED where you would NEED files < 14Megs, ya know???
Torrents DO continue if logged off and back on, ya know???

Now I have to waste diskspace to get this, waste more to open it, just to watch it???
Wouldn't it be better for all if they just sent the AVI in the frst place???
Just a thought, nothing more... nothing less.
