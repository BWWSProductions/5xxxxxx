PrisM Notes::::::::::::
imagines release looked lifeless to me...changed the saturation a touch and added slight magenta lowered the yellow due to was quite heavy and added a tint of cyan.. also added video denoise and sharpness, and contrast and brightness, loaded avs script in tmpgenc and used 1 or 2 of those color filters to..
used rx audio which sounds mint, overall i think it looks and sounds great
