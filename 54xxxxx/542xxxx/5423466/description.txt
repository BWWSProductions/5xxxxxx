Glenn Beck Program for March 9th 2010




I might get Insider Extreme

The camera shoot...for one hour of the show is 400 megs average file size.

I can't upload 400MB x4 to people every day...that's crazy talk


Since hour 4 is the only one that wouldn't be there for download, (I am assuming) I can just make audio from the video stream and then up it.



So, what does the republic say to this?
