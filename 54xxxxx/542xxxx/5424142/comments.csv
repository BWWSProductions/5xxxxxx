Zibbik, I am a staunchly hetero guy...but for this UL, I would consider letting you shag me. How about you settle for some ""lip service"" and I'll tell everyone what a great guy you are. If you are a fem, call me...I'll give you foot rubs and roses. 

Whether you have a kick-stand or not...thanx for an awesome piece of sharing. You are one Hell of a pirate."

,mad_boris,2010-04-15T21:04Z,"Some of this is flac and some is cue/ape... it's quite a mess. It's all there (I think) but converting, importing, naming, renaming, correcting names, numbering, etc. is a tedious process.

I'm not used to working with cue/ape so I might be doing it wrong but still... what's wrong with simple .mp3s? With all due respect, of course."

,Victor_Blackpage,2012-01-10T06:48Z,What is the meaning of FLAC?
,hamm_strung,2012-04-06T22:37Z,"The .ape files can be converted to .wav files first using ffmpeg, this will give you the whole album as one big WAV file.
You could burn this to a CD, but there is no tracks - just one long track with 16 songs.
Then you have to break it into tracks with bchunk. This will give you all the individual track .wav files - but no titles or id3v2 tags.
I use lame to convert from .wav to .mp3 and I add some basic id3v2 tags.
Then, you can add the .mp3 files to your favorite player and set the id3v2 tags more accurately - but there is still no track titles.
Then you open it in MusicBrainz Picard, cluster the files, and do a lookup - and hope the number of tracks matches the album title.
Now, you have Album, Artist, Track Titles & track numbers.
Boom, Bob's Your Uncle."
