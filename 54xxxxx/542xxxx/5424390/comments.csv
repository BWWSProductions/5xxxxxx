spoilers (there! now no one can complain that I didn't put any spoiler tags!)"

,jwords,2010-03-10T10:18Z,"dark, man, you're the king... hah."
,lostspoil,2010-03-10T11:36Z,"Ok.. now for some real spoil.. I happen to know one of the editors and saw the whole season... so guess who's actually Jakob... yes it's Aaron! He is the only ""native"" means the only child that was ever born on this Island what somehow gives him some magic powers that he actually wasn't supposed to have and that pisses evil smoke monster pretty much off because Time traveling Aaron aka Jakob now can hold him prison.. and well who would have guessed that (it's actually an end that pisses me off) but since Aaron in ""real time"" is still alive, the whole loop thing starts again because Aaron aka Jakob takes smokey in ""real time"" prison so actually after smokey killed Jakob (another loop thingy).. so yeah if you were expecting some more explanations about what the hell happened in all the other seasons.. you're waiting for nothing.. "
,ibr4him,2010-03-10T11:56Z,i don't read long comments anymore cause of assholes..
,thankssomuch,2010-03-10T12:07Z,"That's really gut wrenchingly cruel what you just did. I'm too upset to be angry. I'm not even going to abuse you, just know that you tore out my heart. "
,lostspoil,2010-03-10T12:20Z,don't be upset =) it is a very disappointing last season.. that's all I'm saying..
,lososerg,2010-03-10T13:22Z,Thanks for that one. Cool episode. The fake spoilers above don't tell you anything eve close to what you'll see in this ep.
,a5TRo,2010-03-10T13:22Z,"i guess your life's must be shitty to go out of your way to be a jerk, use like to ruin other peoples day to make yourselves feel better.. your life's must suck if you feel good about doing that shi, i feel sorry for use.."
,cursedvandal,2010-03-10T13:55Z,"hahaha, dark_isle was just joking, like always, right? =)"
,DjHero,2010-03-10T14:11Z,"@dark_isle
You think this is how ""spoiler"" alerts work?
Are you relieved that you told all this stuff on here?
F'ing Moron."
,lostspoil,2010-03-10T14:18Z,"well I certainly wasn't joking... I am trying to spare you the whole trouble of waiting 1 week between each episode.. to find out that the ""loop"" has just started and ends where Aaron turns into Jakob (again... lol) and the future or by then present actually is the past.. pff.. I wouldn't spoil the whole season if it wasn't so bad.. "

           Can u fuckin idiots stop ruining things for others? I love the retards who will do shit on the net that they know they would get smacked for in front of some1. Don't put ""Spoiler"" tags either, just simply don't type whatever you were going to type. Amazes me how people feel the need to fuck things up."

However he is just joking, there has been posted ZERO spoilers.

Also, good episode - Thanks eztv."

THIS IS NO FAKE SPOILER IT IS TRUE.. THE WHOLE SEASON ENDS LIKE THIS!!! SERIOUSLY"
,lostspoil,2010-03-11T09:15Z,I mean all those fake spoilers that ppl are actually stupid enough to believe.. i thought it was time to spoil for REAL.... suckers.. and anyway it is so disappointing that you shouldn't care anyway..
,AcCkies,2010-03-11T09:23Z,"mine is wmv file too...
doesn't play, needs to download media rights, how does this work? "
,dmv002,2010-03-11T11:38Z,thank you eztv! good quality as always. ignore those who say it doesn't work or that it's password- protected. it works just fine with bsplayer

Then you've downloaded the wrong torrent. Delete the file and torrent and download this one. "
,fadian13,2010-03-11T20:14Z,Thanks !! :D
,audio_god,2010-03-12T10:25Z,"a reminder that those who post spoilers on lost torrent comment pages will be banned and bummed.
secondly, lostspoil above claims Aaron is the only child ever to have been born on the island, which is completely untrue. Alex was also born on the island to Rousseau"
,lostspoil,2010-03-12T11:12Z,"@audio_god: yeah that's true.. but she's dead and she doesn't come back... what do you think why ""the others"" were so interested in Aaron? you gonna see.. like 5 episodes ahead if I'm not mistaken.. hehehe I am NOT joking..  I am spoiling =) so how you gonna bumm me? I like the idea... "
,lostspoil,2010-03-12T11:35Z,"Ah yeah and Jack and Hurley and all the ""candidates"" I didn't want to spoil this too but you audio_god are forcing me to do so.. they aren't candidates to replace Jakob they are actually candidates to replace Richard Alpert since he really is sick of living over 300 years already =)"
,lostspoil,2010-03-12T11:40Z,"@audio_god:
and hey.. don't blame me for things that don't make sense in the show... dude.. I said it already:
it is a very disappointing last season! "
,lostspoil,2010-03-12T11:47Z,"and.. a fun thing about the last season:
I counted the ""try me"" sentence.. hehehe
they are saying it 23 times in this season.. I hope they didn't do this on purpose 23 times.. because that would be really really bad.. :("
,lostspoil,2010-03-12T12:18Z,"about things that don't make sense.. for example in season 4 episode 5 (constant) Desmond experiences a ""mind-time-travel"" where actually his past mind awakes in his present body and he wouldn't recognize the people around him anymore. so the same thing happens to the ship's technician only with the difference that he would remember everything from his ""present-mind"" as well like when they arrived and what happened to the communication system... and that he wanted to repair it but than he went nuts... so yeah.. i dunno know but it lacks of planning there.. and seriously every season is piling up more and more riddles without any solutions or connections and it would have been so wonderful to have all this (as promised) solved in the last season.. but the only thing that really happens in the last season is piling up more riddles (still) and then having Aaron being Jakob as the only answer solving what again?"
,thankssomuch,2010-03-12T22:55Z,"Alright, I think this has gone on far enough..."
,thankssomuch,2010-03-12T23:07Z,Great Torrent but thanks to this asshole I'm going to download elsewhere.
,hrocky101,2010-03-13T09:50Z,Thanks! Great quality! Works 100%!
