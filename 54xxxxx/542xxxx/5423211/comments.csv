,boxorats,2010-11-19T22:12Z,"This file has locked-in ""copyright by poppedtart"" and other tags (including an exhortation to spay your pets or something, as if the uploader is some kind of role model people will take responsible advice from) - I can't edit them out and make it a clean file. This is really obnoxious kids' stuff if you ask me - it's not copyright by the ripper, it's stolen, and yes we're all stealing but at least don't pretend you deserve credit for the actual movie for god's sake - that's just juvenile and annoying and since I can't fix this file to make it look like the other movies in my iTunes folder (it has an ""HD"" icon locked into the movie name in iTunes) I probably will just delete it. I'm not usually one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but in this case there's no way to know that the file is messed up pointlessly like this. I think you're wasting people's time and bandwidth just for the childish thrill of taking credit for something that isn't yours. Otherwise this would have been a nice thing to share with people."
