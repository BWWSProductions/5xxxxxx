I want to let you guys know about an article that i read recently in TOI...

It said that the producer of this movie had signed up with a anti piracy org to end films gettin posted on the net, the producer had also boasted that APT(aval peyar thamilarasi) cannot be found on the internet on any sites, so guys plz keep seedin this movie and show them we're UNSTOPPABLE.... and no matter what they do its just a waste of time....   

Thanks for the upload NickistaN...
will comment on quality after download"
