,sonomofo,2010-03-11T13:48Z,Best episode ever. It shows the unvarnished stupidity and cynicism of Glenn Beck.
,cbair79,2010-03-12T22:48Z,Any examples? Or is this just another baseless personal attack from another spineless progressive?
,Lord-Darkstorn,2010-03-13T00:54Z,"Glenn Beck's such a jokester. I love it!
His conspiracy theories are the funniest parts!"
,HelloDolly1,2010-03-14T04:38Z,"Glenn Beck is just a regular looney... who happens to have his own tv-show.

Guys like him gives conservatives a really bad image."
