Also it would be better if you could also use sounds(samples?) which have a longer touch/sound. Now the sounds are making it very ""full"" because they are short and many after each other. If those sounds are a bit longer, and less in number; it will still be equally spread(no silent parts) and it will not have the feeling of too ""full""/""many"" .

I don't have such an knowledge about composing/producing music. And my knowledge of the English language in the music area is limited, so hopefully you understand what I mean."
