,oktan,2010-03-10T16:00Z,Worlds smallest torrent by the number of videos in it!!!!!!!!!!!
,musicvids,2010-03-10T22:32Z,"It is a torrent of a torrent. i had to do it this way because TPB will timeout during upload when a torrent has more than 1000 files. So just download this one and then open the torrent inside. 

Alternatively you can copy and paste the following magnet link in your browser for direct access to the real torrent:
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:TNFYWKH7H7B2DCD235B662BZNATWOL4V"

,musicvids,2010-03-30T14:50Z,This file just finished seeding. There is now almost 100 seeds out there.
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-11T21:26Z,"Great Collection, that is seriously a lot of videos... 1463 you say?  That is bloody huge, I can't say I've seen one as big as this before.

I have just started uploading one myself on TPB and it is also in the Top 100 for Music Videos now.  I found this one from the Top 100 from your other one that you advertised this one in the torrent's comments.  I have to say really that maybe, because of the size of this, you should have done it different and you should have done these in Parts like I do.

Doing them in parts is easier, I have had the exact same problems that you have.  When you make a torrent with too many loose files contained within when you come to upload it to the tracker on here it just time's out and doesn't do anything (which is annoyed) I guess that's the drawback about bittorrent there is a limit.

With my very latest ones I have simply made them into 3 parts and called them 'Part 1 of 3' 'Part 2 of 3' etc..  I find it's better that way rather than trying to cram them all into one big one.  The question is how did you get this one to work if it's not connected to the tracker?  What tracker would take a torrent of this size?  Maybe you're using something else instead.

It's always best to make these kind of things so people can cherry pick what they want from them, it's no good making RARs, I did that once lol and lots of these people on here went mad and complained.  It was quite funny really.  At least though with RAR it will work but still if people can't cherry pick it's useless that way..."
