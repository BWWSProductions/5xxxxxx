""the version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you're running. check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher.""

i am running 64 bit windows 7, i tried running it in all the compatibility modes including windows 95, still got the same message.

if you or anyone's got another hungarian language learning tool please let me know! thanks!"
