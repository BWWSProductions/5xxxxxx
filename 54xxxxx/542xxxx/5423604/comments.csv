I see you dld the breakfast club..great classic...I had to search for that one for ages to find it some time ago... if you are into classics have you looked at doing..(if you have) 
Snt elmos fire...and...the big Chill...2 other amazing movies great actors from that era that would be well worth having in a collection...Id certainly like them..

,htctouch,2010-03-10T06:24Z,d watermark wont matr allot for those who uses subtitles ... but i bliv the subtitles arnt avlbl yet ?
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-10T06:48Z,"Thanks guys.

@valu59er: Oh, I was expecting so and I got English and Dutch subs for both, I hope they're good (as translation).

@htctouch: Believe me, such HUGE counter spoils a lot, constantly ""ticking"" and drawing attention away from the movie. TWO released DVDScreeners haven't removed counter - 'cause it wasn't easy. Namely, counter is too big for usual watermark-removal-filter (logoaway accepts max. 256 pixels width and counter is 310) - and too low. Trick was to add 4 pixels at bottom, blur the counter inside my self-written tool-chain and then crop that 4 added pixels.
Now, as I said, try to watch a screener with subs and with counter and mine - without the counter. You'll see what I'm talking about."
,killword,2010-03-10T10:59Z,"Just wanted to 2nd The Big Chill (if it's easy to do; if not I'll just try to find a larger version).  If you put the time into recoding it, I'll promise to keep it seeding for a few weeks 24/7 (with my crappy async US upload speeds, alas).

I've been downloading (and seeding as long as I can) 20/40 since mininova went down but this is my first time commenting.  Keep up the good work!"
[V],pluto999,2010-03-10T12:41Z,+1.. as htctouch said you are the man!!
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-10T16:12Z,"@killword: Last two weeks - in all headers of my torrents I have been saying: ""Requests are on hold till further notice"". Somehow, I haven't done that - here... So, ""Big Chill"" should be up this night - and one time only, 'cause of my mistake."
,lilars26,2010-03-10T17:31Z,@20/40 I think you get more requests when they are on hold...at least it seems that way.
