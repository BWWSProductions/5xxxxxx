"Alice" (2009) - MP4 AVC - [iPOD, PSP optimized] 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1461312/

Following up on the success of last year's groundbreaking original - Tin Man, Syfy's latest original miniseries, Alice, is the modern re-imagined adaptation of Lewis Carroll's timeless classic - "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."

The story follows Alice Hamilton who suddenly finds herself on the other side of a looking glass in an outlandish city under the rule of the deliciously devilish Queen of Hearts (Oscar winner Kathy Bates). In Wonderland, kidnapped captives from our world have their memories erased and are held in a casino where everyone is always a winner. As they gamble, their extreme emotions of joy and excitement are drained, bottled and consumed by the citizens of Wonderland. When Aliceâ€™s new love, Jack Chase is kidnapped, Alice embarks on a desperate quest to find him. She enlists the help of Hatter, Dodo and the White Knight who help her navigate the daringly different, boldly colorful and delightfully skewed dreamscape of Wonderland.
