Grace Valhalla has been producing music on her computer for two years. Recently she put them on jamendo sharing them as creative commons. 

She says about herself, that she is far from being professional and just wanted to produce something she likes to listen to. And expresses the hope of progression through passion. 

Of the two albums she produced the first psychopathethic is more a rock album while the latter PEAK~ is clearly electronic. Both containing calmed down nearly melancholic music.
