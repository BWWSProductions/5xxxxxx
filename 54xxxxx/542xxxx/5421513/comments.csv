,shankdizzle,2010-03-09T02:16Z,It's best it be .m2ts or .mp4 for PS3 users. Please convert and repost. Thanks.
,TheBizzBoy,2010-03-09T03:30Z,i prefer mkv as i use new divx package for windows 7 which supports streaming to ps3 and xbox 360 plus my dvr now with windows media center...3.99gb mkv=4.24gb m2ts...useless takes away from from quality...im sure bricktop will have a m2ts one up
,TheBizzBoy,2010-03-09T03:35Z,if mp4 is needed..use tsMuxer to demux file...use superc or nero to reencode audio ac3 to aac 5.1...then use yamb to remux...simple stuff...only takes a few minutes...keeps the file under the 4.0gb
,pickled_egg,2010-03-09T05:48Z,"Streaming with Windows is OK but the Xbox360 Lowers the quality & resolution to less than 720p
The PS3 will lower the quality on an MKV from windows 7 but not as bad as the Xbox360.

If you convert to AVI (Retaining the  Original Resolution) it will still be lesser quality on the Xbox360 (all streamed HD video is reduced on Xbox360) but the PS3 will play it perfectly

If you have a choice always stream to the PS3 as the xbox360 is programed to reduce HD quality (was Microsofts attempt to get us to buy the HDDVD & HDDVD's when they first launched the Xbox360. They still haven't updated it as they now want us to buy DVD movies via Xbox Live)"
