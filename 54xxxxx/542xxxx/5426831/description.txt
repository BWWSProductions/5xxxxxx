you will not see the difference in sound untill after the install 

this is version kronictokr_noob_ubuntu_karmic_1.0.2

install method is the same a regular ubuntu installation, only that when the disk boots (at the black screen with a list of options), you will have to just hit enter to initialise the regular install process. after which you can follow a tutorial to easily install the os.

heres a good video tut

heres everything else you need to know 
http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Karmic


the only dif between this and the original ubuntu karmic 9.10 , is that it comes with the restricted drivers already installed, the sound issues should be fixed on most systems. 
java and flash are working. 
installed well as vlc, k3b, amsn, firestarter
removed tomboy notes and brasero, as well as totem.
cleaned up 
added some new hd backgrounds and two custom themes, black n blue , and , dark n blue (prefered), oh and fire n ice
fully updated as of march 8 2010 , 



my email, if you have any questions.
also looking for people interested in helping ubuntu along, in a way of helping first time users get the best experience with linux posible.
flammers will be spamed
