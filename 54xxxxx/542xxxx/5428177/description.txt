John Dough isn't real. He doesn't matter. He's just the background in other people's lives. He's just FILLER. John Survives the gritty city on the margins, filling out police line-ups and selling his plasma to pay his bills. That is, until Debra Cross, a hooker with a black eye and a sad story, struts into his life. Before he knows it, John is off, his brass-knuckled fist gleaming, into a tangled, twisted web of boot-kicking, limb-chopping, triple-crossing murder!
