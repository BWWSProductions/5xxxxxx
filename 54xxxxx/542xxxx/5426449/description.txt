Do you have a spare USB stick laying around? (Minimum 2 gig stick)

This is a great Windows utility compilation that I put together for my repair business. It was designed for the ultimate "on the go" computer technician with all the apps you'll ever need to fix virtually any PC problem.

It includes a USB key imaging program that makes the setup a literal no brainer.

Multiple portable Windows apps and multiple bootable options.

The following is from the included "read me"

Run-time portable apps:

CCleaner Portable
Eusing Portable Registry Cleaner
Malwarebytes Portable
SUPERAntispyware Portable
Altiris RAPID-DEPLOY
System Info Wizard
UBCD4Win Wintools
Hiren's Bootdisk 10.2 Wintools
I/O Bit Smart Defrag
Portable Ultra ISO
USB Imaging Tool
Portable TeamViewer
End It All



Included in the bootable image are the following:

---Ultimate Boot CD for Windows "UBCD4WIN 3.5"
---Hiren's Mini XP and Hiren's DOS boot 10.2
---Konboot for 32 bit password bypass of WIndows and Linux systems
---Ophcrack for 64 bit password decryption of WIndows 7 and Vista
---Neosmart recovery boot disks for both 32 and 64 bit Vista

PLUS MUCH MUCH MORE!
