,dm30001,2010-03-24T14:15Z,This works perfectly and doesn't crash now when  trying to load training or skirmish. I didn't even have to reinstall. Thanks allot!!
,JaJuFo,2010-03-25T21:25Z,I applied the crack. Then I realized I didn't apply the crack from the original ISO. So I applied it and everything worked fine except the graphics. I was all meesed up in the way every sprite left a trail of blue or black. How should I fix it? If I have to reinstall it what should I do to make sure that every thing is completely removed? I heard someone say update Direct X but where do I get the files and how do I apply them?
