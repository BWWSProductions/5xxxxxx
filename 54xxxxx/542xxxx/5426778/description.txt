I extracted the music from the new Tron Legacy trailer. 

The music is by Daft Punk but it hasn't been released yet. I bumbled around in Adobe Audition so I could make something that resembles the actual song. I included the raw extracted trailer audio in case anyone else wants to try and give it a go.

I realize that this isn't perfect but I'm not very experienced in audio editing and it's only meant to hold us over until the soundtrack is posted here. The song length is shorter than the trailer because I removed some bits here and there.
