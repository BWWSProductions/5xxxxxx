Schisms in Christianity â€“ War of the Intellectuals:

With most of the religious wars in Europe coming to an end in the 17th century without conclusive results, the Christian factions and sects started another war between them using the "pen" as the weapon (hoping that the pen is mightier than the sword). This war started in the 18th century, reached its peak in the 19th century and continued past WW1 in the 20th century. 

The outcome of this war was an abundance of research and writings that expose the faults in the beliefs and doctrines of the different sects and denominations. Each round typically started with writings that aim to unveil, expose and unmask the errors of, or discredit the beliefs of a certain Christian sect. This was followed by counter accusations and refutations; and so on and on.

Many of these writings were scholarly studies of high caliber. Interestingly, one can only agree with the findings of these studies and writings even it they came from opposing parties. This war of the intellectuals showed that the issue at hand was not a question of which Christian faction is right and which one is wrong; it was really a question of which faction is wrong and which one is wronger.
