Inside every soul, there is a journey of his own├óΓé¼┬ª

In a small secluded town by the sea, there live two lonely youths filled with angst and uncertainty.

To the 15-year-old Ah-Guei, her world has always been different from others. Her eyes tell her that there are no greens or reds in the world. The only person she looks up to is her cousin, Ah-Xian. Ah-Xian has a big world-map and a whole bookshelf of traveling guides. He takes Ah-Guei on imaginary journeys out of their little town, into a world full of wonders.

Yet, the 20-year-old Ah-Xian harbors a secret, as he has come to realize that the only objects of his desires have always been people of his own sex.

Ah-Guei and Ah-Xian dream and plan about that one day when they can fly away to a place where there will be no more loneliness or angst.

The boy dreams about going off to the Great New York with his beloved. And the girl she dreams about sailing to a little island in the Pacific. And on that island, no ones world would be shaded with green or red. Every one of them would be color-blinded, just like her.

Utopia is not far off the horizon, can their dreams really come true?
