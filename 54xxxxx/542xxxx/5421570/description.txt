Miranda is an unconventional woman: a tall, life-embracing, self-effacing clown, who's at her happiest amongst the wind-up teeth of her Joke Shop. 

Lacking the organisational skills needed for retail; or anything else; Miranda has gone into partnership with Stevie, one of Britain's greatest humour vacuums. Stevie mans the till for hours at a time whilst Miranda 'pops out' on regular, self-imposed challenges. 

Miranda is determined to suss out what it takes to be a girly girl, to deal with her outrageously embarrassing mother in public places, 
to get herself a boyfriend and to persuade other people to take life less seriously.
