This is a simple but affective way to remove the unmovable rogueware, malware etc from your windows pc!

To get this to work simply unpack the rar file to a usb devise or desktop then put on usb,run the reg file and then install and update malwarebytes. At the end of the installation of malwarebytes there should be a ticked box asking to run a complete test... DO IT!

The Malwarebytes will ask what to do with the files found, make sure the boxes next to the item scanned and found are ticked then select remove, It will remove any rogueware or malware thats affecting your PC.. then just restart windows and all should be working perfect!

hope this helps
