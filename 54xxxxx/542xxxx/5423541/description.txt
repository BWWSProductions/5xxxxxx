A stunning young heiress checks into one of Europe's most romantic resorts with suicide on her mind. Her lover Jack has been unfaithful to her and she is seeking relief from her depression. Her room is separated from a honeymoon couple next door by the thinnest of walls, and their boisterous romps rekindle her own sexual desires.
