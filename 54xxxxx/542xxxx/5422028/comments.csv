,BigBoiG,2010-08-22T04:29Z,"THIS FILE CONTAINS TROJAN.ADH ... I've had to use this 3 or 4 times and I don't see any damage being done but it still contains a virus and its the only win 7 wga fix I've found, so there's really no way around using it."
,symbio,2010-08-29T14:06Z,"@ BigBoiG : Allmost every single crach/patch made by any group will red flag your Virus scanners.. It's because how they work looks like they are tojans/viruses...

1. Get a grip.
2. Get Comodo (you can sandbox if your too affraid of shit you DL from the internet)
3. Stop whining
4. Profit?

This release works just fine and is no way infected with any shit you just discriped. Have used it since the release earlyer this year ;) 10x ++ WGA's patched."

,PIRATE-555,2011-01-02T22:40Z,"MATES!

IF Chew FAILS to work for you (as it did for me), here is a link to another approach that FIXES this plague!

http://www.teeeh.com/troubleshooting-and-fixes/how-to-block-or-uninstall-windows-7-activation-update-kb971033/

The WGA problem was introduced with a ""Official Windows Security Update:  KB971033"".

The page shows you how to BLOCK that Update so it will NOT install in the future!

It also includes EASY instructions on how to REMOVE the KB971033 Update if it already installed.

I like the Windows Auto-Update until they send a volley like KB971033!  I am VERY tempted to disable that feature now...

GREAT STUFF and THANK YOU for the original Torrent!

Now RUM FOR ALL!!!

,PIRATE-555,2011-01-02T23:18Z,"FOLLOW UP...

There are THREE Microsoft updates to AVOID:
KB971033, KB905474 and KB921914!

Ye ave' been warned...

,mmabong,2011-09-22T13:52Z,The instruction says it is not safe to use. Should I still go ahead and use it?
