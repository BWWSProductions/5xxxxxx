  Requiem for a Dream exposes four paralleled individuals and their menacing
  addiction to heroin, cocaine, and diet pills (speed). Taking place in 
  Brooklyn amidst the waning Coney Island, the drugs are very easily obtained
  and keep each main character in its cycle of dependence. The protagonist
  Harry Goldfarb is your typical heroin junky with an ambitious plan of 
  "Getting off hard knocks," with help from his cocaine crazed girlfriend
  Marion and his long time friend Tyrone. Meanwhile his widowed mother is
  obsessed with the glamor of television and eventually finds her way to
  a dietitian who pushes her into the cycle of drug induced enslavement.
