,brunohll,2010-03-24T14:49Z,Found Trojan horse PSW.Generic7.BMAT in keygen with AVG9.. this could just be a false alarm due to altered code. I'll try the posted serials first. Thanks.
,vishu9,2010-03-25T13:48Z,whats the deal with this???...i d/l and while extracting Avast identifies a Malware in the extracted folder..which is most probably the keygen.exe....and even though i ignore it the setup doesnt start at all!!!!......there is only a samll blank box which opes up but nothing it doesnt install!!!..what am i missing here??...i'm trying it on my 64-bit Windows 7
,silverblue74,2010-03-25T19:28Z,"I myself have tried to install this software on a Windows 7 64bit Ultimate. I works perfectly!
I allways try the software before I upload.
I also scan the software with the latest Symantec Endpoint Protection and Trend Micro.
They didn't detect any malware or trojan.

Probalby false positive from Avast/AVG.

Verify and scan the keygen on this site:

,comefly,2010-04-02T05:31Z,"@drgnslyr91d: because there is no ""64-bit specific"" vmware workstation for windows, look at this screenshot from the download page in the official vmware site:

,bobsobol,2010-04-25T18:51Z,"Okay... I have been looking for a version of this which doesn't set my A/V alarms off... they all seem the same.

Ultimate solution is.... UnUPX the KG and the alarms stop going off. XD

In order to do that (with Avast) I had to disable the run-time shield, extract the keygen.exe, pass it through UPX to uncompress (I used CFF Explorer, but UniExtractor or UPX will work just as well) and then enable the run-time shield.

To confirm, I performed a deep scan on the uncompressed exe, and it's fine... there are no threats in it aside from the compression. :D"
,Phixtit,2010-05-07T13:31Z,"Thanks for the up! :)

,Trax852,2010-06-02T15:14Z,"Concerned about a keygen or any program? Run it in Sandboxie
http://www.sandboxie.com/ it keeps anything from accessing your system until you give it the ok.

a Keygen if it's a bad one, but still gives you a number - just run it in sandboxi , get the number, then delete it.

I have no ties with this program or site, I just use it."
,djamirku,2010-06-22T09:14Z,nice thanks worked.
,Dave_247,2010-06-23T13:45Z,"If your worried about the keygen, don't use it.
Just install the program and use the key here."
,Dave_247,2010-06-23T13:47Z,"If you want you can download the install yourself from the official site here:

,some-young-guy,2011-02-09T04:34Z,"Keygens trigger false positives because software developers pay good $$$ to get the keygens added to virus vaults to further maximize their profit margins.  Think of it as basic advertising expenses to generate more revenues.

Does anyone have problems not being able to use mouse clicks with their VMs?  I loaded backtrack 4 onto the workstation, but am unable to activate mouse clicking and thus can do nothing with the VM.  I have Vista SP2 as my host OS.  Any solutions or links to solutions would be greatly appreciated."
