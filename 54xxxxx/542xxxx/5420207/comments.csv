,glenjard,2010-12-29T11:31Z,is this an emulator???
,Darckwings,2011-01-07T18:08Z,"It looks like the teh file that is named Part 2 actually contains the ISO for Part 1, so it looks like part 2 is missing."
,Chidorax,2011-01-28T14:11Z,"The game works. Just install it on PowerIso (Youtube if you need a registered account). Then, once you've installed the game. Click on the ""explore"" button on the right click menu on the virtual disc you have chosen. You should see a file called ""crack"". Open this, and copy the contents from this file into your DMC 4 Folder in ""Program Files\CAPCOM"" etc...

,ok_liv,2011-07-04T21:54Z,"el juego funciona, no se puede jugar con el raton, sino solo con el teclado, es una copia para la xbox, it's a copy for xbox, u can't use the mouse"
,SkeeterValentine,2011-07-14T08:05Z,"I finished the download and instaled and registered PowerIso.
What i have to do now? :)"
,aosmithx,2011-08-09T10:53Z,"Ok guys you dont have to use powerISO, i used Daemon tools (lite) and it worked fine.

all you need to do is install the game, copy the INSIDE of the crack folder (the DX9 and the DX10) and replace the ones in the game folder (program files/CAPCOM etc) and then use the launcher

then the game will work fine :)
btw, you cant use the game straight from the DX10/9, you have to use the launcher, otherwise you will have a black screen and the game will crash"
,aosmithx,2011-08-09T11:00Z,"and dont alt+tab
otherwise the game will just screw up"

Please insert the original ""KPC Devil May Cry 4"" CD/DVD.
Please have a look at http://www.securom.com/message.asp?m=wrongdisc for further, more detailed information.

I installed and copied the DX9 and DX10 from crack folder and copied it to the main directory, still nothing... any ideas? "
,stark17,2011-09-21T03:03Z,"Weird, I dont get why you guys are having problems. I did this, pretty straight forward like every other game I DL.

Extract
Mount
Install
Crack
Play

Maybe you should try reinstalling. But as far as the torrent goes, this one is A OK."
,stark17,2011-09-21T03:09Z,"USE DAEMON TOOLS LITE. After extracting both rar files, you should be getting a single iso. Now add new image using daemon tools. Then, in the daemon tools screen,CLICK ON ADD DT VIRTUAL DRIVE. Once the drive finishes installing, mount the iso to the new drive. This is what I did. Worked for me, i dont know why it shouldnt for you. "
