It will be available for Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.[6] With the introduction of Office 2010 a 64-bit version of Office[7] will be available for the first time, although in 64-bit, only for Windows Vista and later client operating systems. Office 2010 is not supported on Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.

Office 2010 will mark the debut of free online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, which will work in popular web browsers (Windows Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari) but not in the Opera browser. Microsoft has confirmed that it will be released in the first half of 2010, and a public beta was made available in November 2009.[8] A new edition of Office, Office Starter 2010, will replace the current low-end home productivity software, Microsoft Works.
