Long story short: TYT raged against Epic Beard Man (who was God of Anon for 3 days) in their latest video and I saw it as an opportunity to turn the internet hate machine against them full-force. EBM was just a catalyst... I don't care for him that much.

I posted said video along with Kasparian's home address, phone number, and Google Street View images of her house, truck, etc right in the middle of the hive. Epic shitstorm ensued and she went into full lockdown mode, deleting her website and blog. TYT also deleted 3 videos, made retractions and issued an apology.

It was entertaining, but as with all raids it rise and fell and is now all but forgotten, as it should be."
