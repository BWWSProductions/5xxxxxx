,Zogu,2010-03-13T23:17Z,saturnine4 i played dow2 when it first came out. After that i kept saves and did a clean win install. I cant even get the old save to work on original dow2. I guess if i'm able to do that the rest would be easy.

,saturnine4,2010-03-13T23:58Z,did you try making a new campaign for dow then beating that then trying to import your saves? i know it kinda defeats the purpose but importing your saves is alot better than starting fresh in chaos rising.
,Zogu,2010-03-14T00:20Z,@saturnine4 i did try that but it doesn't work. I guess it has something to do with gfwl account. i even tried finishing one mission then saving and opening save files with notped and copy past the code or whatever :)

,saturnine4,2010-03-15T00:38Z,i wish they hadn't made the campaign so fucking short i mean there were like 2-3 optional missions as opposed to the original dawn of war 2 there was like an endless stream of missions. this game gives you some badass gear but nothing to use it on. this is a complete let down for people who don't play multiplayer for this just the SP(like us torrenters). one thing about this release though is now i can't play ANY online games even though i have the original dawn of war 2.

,Firewolf5,2010-03-16T13:26Z,"OK,

For those having problems in how to install here is the drill:

1. Mount or Burn image
 (Normally, the setup installation will auto-start after imaging)

2. Run Installer.exe
 (when it ask for SID file you have to select it on your dvd drive) ..... in windows 7, press Computer and in ""Devices with removable Storage"" choose the Drive with the IMAGE

3. Go to your computer, open the ""image drive"", open the file ""Razor 1911"" and copy all of this content to your ... Program Files (x86) Warhammer 40000 Dawn of War II - Chaos Rising)

PS: Copy and replace all the files/folders!!

4. In the same folder where the game is installed in your pc, usually on ""Local Disck (C:)""
Open the folder INSTALL ... and install all files whose type are APPLICATION (ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!)

5. Yes you need to install Microsoft games for Windows live in order to play this game.

6. Start the game, DOW2.exe

7. after seeing the video :P ... in the right corner above, press windows live...creat a new account .... dont press continue, instead...just scroll all the way down and creat a ""local profile"" after that.... HAPPY GAMING!!!

,tahvot121,2010-03-17T18:40Z,LOOL!!!! i need the crack! ther is no crack!
,bisherp,2010-03-17T18:53Z,Will this work if I have a legit copy of the first one?
,Firewolf5,2010-03-17T20:32Z,"HEy folks!!!!

About craches and errors i really dont know how to help ya. ((try what everyone tells... update drivers, usually the graphics one))

About how to install, im gonna explain (again)!!!

(there is a short explanation in page 5 in my second comment)

1. Download the torrent until you reach 100%

2. Usually the utorrent in windows 7, put the downloaded files in the folder ""downloads"".....SO, i use daemon tools to Mount the image ""rzr-whcr"" which is inside the folder ""Warhammer_40000_Dawn_Of_War_II_Chaos_Rising-Razor1911""  inside the downloads FOLDER.

3. Normally after imaging, the setup installation of any game pops up!!
Press yes or continue and VOILÀ, the installation begins!!!!

4. During the installation, a new window will pop up saying you need to insert disc 1 and so on..... in order to continue the installation process. 

You just need to: 

(when it ask for SID file you have to select it on your dvd drive) ..... in windows 7, press Computer and in ""Devices with removable Storage"" choose the Drive with the IMAGE

IN english: when the new small window pops up, IN that SAME window, go to your computer!! Then, there are normally 2 sections:

*Hard Disk Drives and *Devices with Removable Storage

Check the second one and you should see a Drive (with a letter:) with the icon of the warhammer game. Open that file and choose the the ""requesting SID file"" and keep up the installation!!! :D

5. Installation should be completed!!

6. Now here comes where we need to copy/paste the crack right!! 

WARNING: On many other games, there are only 1 or 2 files we need to copy/paste in order to launch the game right?? This time is equal except we need to copy/paste many many FILES

Step: Go to your computer, open the ""image drive"", open the file ""Razor 1911"" and copy all of this content to your (i mean really all stuff inside this folder) ... to Program Files (x86) Warhammer 40000 Dawn of War II - Chaos Rising)

PS: Copy and replace all the files/folders!!

7. go to rule 8 :P

8. In the same folder where the game is installed in your pc, usually on ""Local Disck (C:)""
Open the folder INSTALL ... and install all files whose type are APPLICATION (ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!)

One of the application is the ""Microsoft games for Windows live "" .... YEs, you need to install it in order to play the game.  (After installation of this aplicattion dont creat/log any account).

9. Start the game the way we all know it. (DOW2.exe)

10. After lauching the game....after seeing the video :P ... in the right corner above, press windows live...creat a new account .... dont press continue, instead...just scroll all the way down and creat a ""local profile"" after that.... HAPPY GAMING!!!



I hope this time all can install this lovely game!!! 
If you are a pro installer and just want the quick setps, check PAGE 5 my second comment. 


ENJOY THE GAME FOLKS.
TY all to extremezone :)"

3. Go Through The Install And When It Asks For SID File Look For It Where You Extracted Your Game And It Should Be Just Sittting There  You Should Have To Do  This Twice

When you mount the iso file open it. Make a new folder on your desktop and copy the install folder on the disk to it.

After you copy and paste the 1911  files to c drive warhammer file. You can go back to the install file on your desktop and install these files:

vcredist.msi

gfwlivesetup.exe

DXSETUP.exe

Once you do that go in the warhammer file in c drive and click on DOW2.exe to play.

Steam games are some of the worst to get going. DOW games are the worst of the Steam games. Now I remeber how much of a b!tch it was to get DOW 2 to wrok as well.

4.Once uve done installing everthing and now start the game. DONT EVER TRY TO CHANGE ANY SETTINGS! and u wont experience any game crash.

@dangirdas: Don't try to go online as this is a cracked version. Block the games internet connection with a firewall ( i use PC Tools Firewall Plus Free). To start a campaign Just chose campaign in the main menu.

It is the game type. It is a stand-alone expansion. You don' need the original Dawn of War 2 to play this. extremezone (or whoever typed the description) has made a mistake. That is all.

The game is pretty good, it doesn't lose momentum at all, and you want to keep playing the game until then end. Thank you very much Razor-1911, keep up the good work :)


P.S. Maybe i was the only one, but once when i tried to load up a mission, it said ""Sign in change has occurred, returning to main menu when finish loading"" or something like that... Anywho, i just reinstalled Windows Live with the gfwlivesetup.exe, located in the Install folder"

,OmniNegro,2010-04-05T05:16Z,"I really do not understand how the instructions could possibly be made more clear. If you are STILL having problems then read through ALL the comments. Someone likely answers whatever questions you still have.

There is no serial. If you want to play it online then fuck you and your fat wife too. :) Buy it. This is for single play only. You simply CAN NOT play online with this. Quit whining about a serial. You will never get one. And even if you did it would never work.

If you think the simple install directions are too hard then you are surely right and should forget this and just go buy it and shut up about how incompetent you are.

It works. Perfectly. Period. If you are still here and having problems then I am truly sorry, but I can not fix it for you. There are always games that will not work on certain hardware and software configurations. You must just be unlucky. Just be happy you found out it would not work on your system before you paid good money for it.

And to those enjoying the game. Good for you. Enjoy."

If the boss does follow you just use the fore commander to keep him busy while others get to full strength. "

OK,

For those having problems in how to install here is the drill:

1. Mount or Burn image
(Normally, the setup installation will auto-start after imaging)

2. Run Installer.exe
(when it ask for SID file you have to select it on your dvd drive) ..... in windows 7, press Computer and in ""Devices with removable Storage"" choose the Drive with the IMAGE

3. Go to your computer, open the ""image drive"", open the file ""Razor 1911"" and copy all of this content to your ... Program Files (x86) Warhammer 40000 Dawn of War II - Chaos Rising)

PS: Copy and replace all the files/folders!!

4. In the same folder where the game is installed in your pc, usually on ""Local Disck (C:)""
Open the folder INSTALL ... and install all files whose type are APPLICATION (ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!)

5. Yes you need to install Microsoft games for Windows live in order to play this game.

6. Start the game, DOW2.exe

7. after seeing the video :P ... in the right corner above, press windows live...creat a new account .... dont press continue, instead...just scroll all the way down and creat a ""local profile"" after that.... HAPPY GAMING!!!

Once this is done copy ALL files from ""Razor911"" folder (crack) to wherever you installed - just ""copy & replace"" em - and then run DOW2exe from the installed and wolla you are taken to the world of warhammer 40K. Create an OFFLINE account and you will be asked for NO product keys. If a halfwit like me can install this puppy any fool can. God bless you Razor."

I have checked in many places and am not new to this sort of thing but even my hawk eyes miss things. So, could someone please direct me to where it is or will I have to just start to delete everything manually?"

Now I can not start a campaign with my actual GFW Account. I can start a game with my off line account tho. If anyone has it working with there actual GFW Account. Please tell me how.

Now those that cant figure out how to make an off line account, press Home then sign out of your proper account, Then click create new profile. BUT! DO NOT CLICK THE CONTINUE BUTTON! Scroll down and click the create local profile link at the bottom. That will create an off line profile. That will be you."
,Lucian88,2011-03-02T18:52Z,"**PLEASE READ REGARDING CRASH UPON START UP**

For those of you that have encountered the crash upon start up, I've encountered the same thing and realised that I had selected the files incorrectly during installation. If you've installed the game and get a crash when you try to run it, locate the game directory and check the size. If its not 6GB+ you've done the same. 

Just delete the diectory and immediatly install the game again, when it asks for you to locate the various SID files you need to direct it to where you've mounted the game and not the iso directly. It seems you can do both but if you try to direct it to the iso instead of the mounted drive it wont install correctly. It just seems to place the base files onto your drive and thats it.

So basically;

1. Mount the rzr-whcr iso via daemon tools, Magic iso ect

2. Run it and select install

3. When it asks for the first SID file (Chaos Rising_disk1_0.sid from memory) immediatly direct it to the virtual drive where you have the game mounted

If you've done it right you should be able to select the individual SID file its requesting. Rinse and repeat for the other SID's.

Hope this helps.

This torrent installs the base Dawn of War 2 plus Chaos Rising. It doesn't include Retribution though.

I played Retribution first. It took me 2 days to beat the campaign on hard, which wasn't hard at all. Then I switched to another faction, only to find out that ALL of the factions play the same exact campaign, just with different units. So I tried this, and Chaos Rising is even more boring. So glad people upload pirated versions of games, because they just don't seem to make great games any more, only mediocre games.

It's hard to believe Relic could make a great game like Company of Heroes, and then release such a mediocre series of games like this."

Apart from whatever malware shit Razor1911 demands you install along with his game, it wrecked my hard drive via destroying the boot sequence, resulting in a reformat.

Look, we appreciate people going out of their way to share these games ands tuff with the community, and I'm sure you'd like a 'thanks' here and there for your work, but when you incorperate your own signature bullshit into downloads/installation files, it fucks people over and over-complicates things.

So, fuck you Razor1911. I'll never be downloading your shitty work again, and I hope no one else does either.

In the meantime, I'll be off looking for a REAL DoW2CR torrent, because all this torrent contained was a massive pile of shit."

This torrent is good.  I got it in a day and a half, and installed in an hour.  It hasn't crashed yet, there is a crack for it, just requires a *pinch* of your intelligence to figure out ""Hey...this isn't just the .exe, its a few other things I need to copy over!"".

The graphics aren't as bad as anyone says, and the plot is good.  And Retribution is pretty bad though, it's almost a new game in the series, not an expansion."
