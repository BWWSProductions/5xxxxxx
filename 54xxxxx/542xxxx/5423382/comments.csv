,Superbus,2010-03-10T03:14Z,"Thank you for this.

Does anyone know if the Centauro addon for Theatre of War 2:Africa was ever cracked/released?

And if not, would the Centauro addon work with cracked TOW2:Africa if I bought just the addon?

If I was employed I would buy it."
,TheBigHase,2010-03-11T18:59Z,"Yeah thx so much! I can only recommend this! This is much better than TOW 1 ! I kinda like the mix of great effects, action and strategy - it's fun and I hope for further updates for ex. Prochorovka - this game is a must have imo! ;-)"
,DikkatDeliVar,2010-03-13T12:28Z,"Thank you so much. Theater of war 1 and 2 could be best WWII strategy games... if not for the immense bugs. They didn't fix the bugs yet, but released another game with the same crappy bugs. Reading Russian game forums, nah, I will rather wait another 6 months with the hope a patch will be released. 
Thanks for the good work of cracking it, I am just annoyed of the game AI which knows my troops locations and calls for an artillery barrage in the midst of my troops every 2 minutes (there is a way to edit each scenario and increase the time between artillery attacks to 2 hours, but no option to cancel the first barrage, which destroys 1 third of your entire troops even if you scatter them. Sorry for crying here, I loved the game, until this bug killed my hopes..."

,vrgadin,2011-05-24T18:05Z,"this is a virus, im not kidding if yu dont believe me open the torrent all kinds of asian files in it.  A. it just hung when trying to install (blue circle which eventually disappeared and nothing happened. this was the virus installing)

than my comp just wouldnt respond and i barely got it working with a system restore.  

skidrow does not put virusus in. but this was uploaded by some fuck named thenoobish."
,IanLimJX,2011-10-06T14:14Z,"the music files are missing

Are they installed only after the installation is complete? (eg adding the serial they ask for)"
