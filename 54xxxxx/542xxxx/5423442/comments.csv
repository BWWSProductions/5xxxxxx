,picafumo,2010-03-11T00:59Z,"i start the game normally, i start the singleplayer then appears something about the mission in a black screen, but when the game starts the screen gets white i just can hear the sounds!
will this fix my problem???
thanks"
,jodiac,2010-03-11T19:56Z,"of-course it will, just try it"
,Heinzie,2010-03-20T11:09Z,For all you guys out there. Don't download this one. The only thing you need is chaning your DX settings in the settings.ini file. You can find that file at: C:\Users\Your Username\My Documents\BFBC2. Just change the line: DxVersion= so its like this: DxVersion=9 
,Heinzie,2010-03-20T11:10Z,Then hit save and try your game again.
,jodiac,2010-03-22T12:02Z,"I've tried it, before finding this one. That never worked for me or anyone else "
,ChimX420,2010-03-23T02:29Z,"Good first torrent Jodiac, fix worked like a charm. Two thumbs up!"
,jodiac,2010-03-25T06:07Z,"Thanks man, I'm still looking for a fix for ""quiet  dialog"" glitch of this game."
