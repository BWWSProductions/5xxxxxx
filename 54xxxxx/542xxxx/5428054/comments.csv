Really appreciate you hookin us all up with a wicked funny show, when nobody else would.  Seriously.  I KNOW you've noticed the sad state of affairs that the first season is in. Maybe, like me, you experienced the joy of scavenging through the junk torrents out there like some sort of E-Hobo... so anybody who bitches about the quality bro (which AIN'T bad at all), I'll say it for you now: ""Then make a better one so I don't have to, or stop yer bitchin' and gobble a dick."" ;) ...much appreciated dude.  Made my night."
