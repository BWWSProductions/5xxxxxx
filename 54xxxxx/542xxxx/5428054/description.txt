I think I'm starting to understand how this whole TV ripping thing works, my hardware is not the greatest though... 

I am just a huge fan of this show, and want to share it with everyone interested. 

I invite anyone who wants to complain about the quality of the A/V to record and seed these episodes yourself!

I honestly converted the raw dv of this recording to xvid over 10 different times, trying to get the settings to produce a decent final product...

anyways, enjoy
