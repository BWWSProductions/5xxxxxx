,crunchyfrog555,2010-03-23T04:08Z,"First off, which R4? R4i? R4 SDHC?
Secondly, it takes more than this file to operate the R4 (and therefore play the games) - where's the Moonshell and Moondat files?

Also, which version number is this?

Anybody who has an R4 cartridge usually knows to go to their main provider's website for firmware updates.

E.g.
http://r4i-sdhc.com/downloade.asp

Nice thought, but sadly of no real use to anyone."
