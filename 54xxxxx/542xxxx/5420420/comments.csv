,danw16,2010-06-28T04:03Z,"Hi thenoobish,

Do you think you could make a torrent of the game ""NASCAR Thunder 2002"" for the PlayStation 2. I loved that game a lot but my disc for the game got damaged :'(

Thanks,

Dan"

,zzirhp,2012-03-16T21:13Z,"Can someone PLEEAAASE upload:
""Dirt to Daytona"" or ""NASCAR Dirt to Daytona"" for PS2? (same game, I'm just not positive of the exact title)

I've been dying to find this game because it has sprint cars, the only upload here at TPB has no seeds :("
