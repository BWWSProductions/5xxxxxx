This is Bogdan Denitch's informative book After the Flood - World Politics and Democracy in the Wake of Communism (1992) which addresses the significance of the political left in the resulting 'new order' and analyzes the dynamics of the current social and political situation by focusing on issues of social justice, ethnic conflicts unleashed by the decline in state centralism, and prospects for the third world in the emerging global context. Denitch insists on the relevance of social democracy to the post-communist world. His combination of jeremiad, analysis, and prescription is reminiscent of much left-wing writing, yet his contribution is distinctive. His criticism of the "antistatist" bias of the left is refreshing. By reviving the traditional categories of liberal capitalist, former communist, and developing regimes, Denitch explains important sources of change. After the Flood brings a distinct voice to the debate about the future of world politics. 180 pages. A must read for everyone.
