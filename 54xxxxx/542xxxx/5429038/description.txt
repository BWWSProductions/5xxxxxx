===== REPEAT WARNING ====================

Though there was no indication of this 
on the Infowars web site or on the 
PrisonPlanet web site, 
today's Alex Jones Show consists entirely 
of material [interviews and calls] from 
previous programs:

James Traficant from Feb. 19th

Philip J. Berg from Feb. 25th

Brad Martin from Mar. 2nd

Christopher Monckton from Feb. 17th

Be aware that the copy-and-paste
editing that was done to put this
show together for broadcast is
somewhat rough in places.  I have
done what I could to make it more
listenable.

Also, as of today, the original torrents
for each of the above listed shows
are still seeded and available.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume support or endorsement on my
 part of all contents. 

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
