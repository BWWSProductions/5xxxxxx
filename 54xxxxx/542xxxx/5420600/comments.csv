,sweetspirit1,2010-03-08T21:10Z,i just started dl let know if real or not but most likely it's real cause raymondhome is the best thanks for all ur wonderful uploads
,paulderby,2010-03-08T22:28Z,just so everyone knows before downloading there is an annoying timer at the bottom
,LeGra,2010-03-08T22:43Z,"I just checked out the Sample.  Yes, there's a a timer at the bottom, but it's extremely watchable.  This is a Audio Workprint.  I've seen these before.  We can't complain when it's FREE!!!!!"
[V],raymondhome,2010-03-09T01:53Z,"you can also try this release...

,sweetspirit1,2010-03-09T14:19Z,well i just got done dl it was fake i did not get nothing it took a whole day but thanks anyway raymond you still rock
,dzombie,2010-03-13T10:03Z,wow! this torrent is a testament on how you can encode somthing to be very large in in size but still super shitty in quality! This is not watchable and the audio sucks...i am generally not picky but dont waste your time with this one like i did! seriously looks like a cam!
,RickFrenzy,2010-03-17T03:43Z,Can someone post this in the DVDR section. You would be a legend. Thanks Mates
