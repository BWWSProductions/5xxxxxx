The Master Rallye is a 5000 km long rallye from Paris to Moscow. It takes ten days to do this distance and the track leads through seven countries and all terrain types, from asphalt road over dust ways to mud and even snow. Ten days, you are alone with the road and the roaring sound of your engine. With this game, you can participate on one of the most demanding rallyes of the world. You need to race through 30 stages, on all terrain, against aggressive AI opponents, to win the cup. The game is the official Master Rallye computer game.

Master Rallye is a racing game, based on the trans-European and Asian endurance race of the same name. You race off-road over extreme terrain at break-neck speed, power-sliding around corners, launching skywards over humps and jumps, and avoiding hazards. Vehicle handling is excellent, with advanced physical modeling used to produce a driving feel that is both realistic and great fun to play.

The game's unique course design offers extremely wide driving areas, rather than narrow, constrained race tracks. This allows players to find their own fastest route over the rough terrain, weaving around obstacles and humps. Extremely wide, open courses, offering a true off-road sensation. Courses are based on official archive data from previous Master Rallyes and the expertise of Rene Metge, the official Master Rallye course designer and previous three time Paris-Dakar champion.
