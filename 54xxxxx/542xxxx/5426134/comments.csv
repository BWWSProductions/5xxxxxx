Run the Keygen DMG and the app inside.
Copy the key.

(I turned off wi-fi, but this is probably not necessary.)
Move both of the Things .rar files into the same folder, right-click and upen using Unarchiver.

It will create two DMGs, open the one that doesn't have the - 1 appended to the end.  Drag to Applications folder.  Launch (from applications folder.

Choose register.  Paste Code (no username.) Continue, and done.  (Turn wi-fi back on.)

Thanks a ton, Barzam!  Really gorgeous Core applications in there too!"
