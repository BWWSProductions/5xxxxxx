,doabarrelroll,2010-03-09T05:11Z,can you seed plz?
,depento,2010-03-09T07:11Z,SEED!!!!
,luongosbongos,2010-03-09T18:38Z,"SEED, no one's able to download!"
,El_Dildos,2010-03-10T21:26Z,"it's some kind of fake, the beginning of the each song is really flatliners' new material, but after 10 seconds of listening it changes to other songs right in the middle of the track"
,mikecrap,2010-03-11T08:08Z,nahh dogg. chris gave it to me after he stayed at my house. this is their record. tired of the same old fat wreck punk bullshit.
,davestern,2010-03-11T16:04Z,"Thanks for the perfect rip! 
Not sure what el_dildos is talking about, my version works perfectly! Rad CD! "
,SirMrManGuy2,2010-03-12T08:52Z,"@davestern: perfect rip my ass. El_Dildos is right, about 10-15 seconds into every song it switches to some bizarre crap.

@mikecrap: if you truly are that close to the band then maybe you can tell them to update their damn online store. All of the shirts I want are either completely sold out or only available in Baby GAP and blanket size."
,kremster,2010-03-18T18:42Z,"yeah this is fake. The first 10 seconds of the song are there, then it switches to crap. So disappointing =["
,CvMgLocWeneverstop,2010-03-25T05:39Z,"you shit talker.
mike is crap. in fact he's shit. and most likely has no relation to the faltliners. 
all of these songs are by the flatliners. but only the first 10-15 seconds of them. after that its all chicken noises, cats meowing and the price is right? 

not worth downloading AT ALL"
,mikecrap,2010-03-27T03:40Z,"With all due respect, CvMgLocWeneverstop, the Flatliners did spend a long time making this fake version of their cd to piss you people off. Looks like it worked! You probably eat better than they do, go out and purchase the record when it comes out. They are very proud of it."
,SirMrManGuy2,2010-03-27T20:45Z,"@mikecrap I fully do intend to purchase the CD when it releases. I saw them live and I will most likely purchase a few shirts off their store once they restock. However, I absolutely hate the waiting game. If the record is done then just release it. I understand that it takes time to produce the physical CDs and ship them so that is why I say just release them digitally once the album is finished in the studio and then release it on CD at a later date. I was looking on here for a pre-release rip of Cavalcade just so I could hear their new stuff to tide me over before the long wait to buy the physical CD was over. I absolutely hate searching on the internet for low-quality copies of songs and I was hoping for a decent rip.

However, since it does seem to know the actual band maybe you can forward this message to them. Update your online store! My physical size is larger then ""Youth-Large"" which is what half the shirts are!"
,El_Dildos,2010-03-28T17:25Z,"@mikecrap, dude, not pissed at all. yeah, you're totally right about the whole thing, but on the other hand, just for example: i live in Russia, Fatwreck do not send cds here and most services do not even accept Russian bank cards so sometimes it's hard to find mp3 services to buy the album, and Russia is not even the worst place in the world, in some parts people even can't make themselves a credit card. Paying 10$ for an album is not too much for me, but if i could buy it in my local store. It's much more expensive any other way. For example, to buy an album that will cost you 10$ i'll pay more than 20$, that is the cost of delivery. You're saying that they don't eat to much, sorry but i can't get the liaison between me downloading an album and money that they get from record label, oh sure they get their percent from sale i suppose, well maybe, but i can hardly believe that it's the most profit, anyway it's not my business to discuss it, i don't know their contract.

And for the last: i play in the band myself and it's no way you can earn money by just playing in band in Russia, we don't even try. Playing concerts is the only way of making money for us, sometimes road tickets cost not much lower than we get. I could imagine that bands only like Rolling Stones, Metallica or other Grand bands could live like ""life don't care"" only by playing shows and selling cds making millions of dollars. I think if you want to make a lot of money you should not become a musician, you should become a businessman. Don't get me wrong, i like Flatliners and like their music and i understand their unhappiness about this situation, but for us, people that live not in US or EU it's really hard to get music. I'm not that kind of lazy pig who will not grab his ass to just walk out of the house to the local music store and not that greedy to spend money on music, but think about situation where people like me and i are. Well ok, it's their music and their choice to do things about it.

I hope i didn't insult anyone, and Mike, if you are really so close to a band, maybe you'll ask them to think about coming to Russia?=)) I proudly swear to buy all their cds and t-shirts on the concert=) Thx."
,piratelucas,2010-03-30T11:34Z,god damn canadians!
,Ryan2311,2010-04-10T03:46Z,"This is fake, 100% sure. I just downloaded one of the tracks on the FatWreck website and listened to it to make sure."
,Slave2Society7,2010-04-21T20:46Z,"mikecrap, it seems that you do not realize how many people are unable to get cd's like this.. Not gonna bother listing the reasons, but don't you realize how many fans only found and heard of the band because of downloads like this?? This sharing generates WAY MORE money through gaining fans that go the shows, buy merch and everything else. The band should be proud!

Oh well sorry, but the cd will end up ripped soon."
[T],badaboum6,2010-04-29T04:31Z,"Fake, fake, fake..."
,Fyrous,2010-05-11T09:46Z,"Totally fake...first 10-15 seconds of each song is legit, then it's just random garbage.  Thanx for the up! [Face_eyesrolling]"
