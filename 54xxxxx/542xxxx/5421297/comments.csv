,roger.fed,2010-03-09T18:51Z,Great torrent !!
,adderbine,2010-03-09T20:05Z,"I intend to seed this indefinitely. However, others must download and seed it for it to take off, so please, guys. Don't let this one die. It is the best Project 86 torrent out there right now."
,Snake_Eater007,2010-07-04T01:26Z,"The Kane Mutiny EP and This Time of Year EP were both iTunes exclusives. And I'm not sure about Picket Fence Cartel, as I could never find it in stores, so I just downloaded it from iTunes.

This is my all-time favorite band. This is one of the few bands that I legally own their entire discography. Downloaders, please support this band! Either buy an album or two, or maybe a t-shirt, or something. This music is too good to take advantage of."

Thanks for Project 86! [Bowlaboy1]"

,adderbine,2011-09-23T15:46Z,"In reply to Snake Eater:

I legally own all of their albums as well. I actually bought the EP releases on Amazon.com because as far as I knew, there was no torrent available for it. They are the only band that I have gone through the trouble of going out and buying their albums."
,shawnthehuman,2011-10-29T05:10Z,This is my favorite band of all time. If you enjoy this music please support the band.
