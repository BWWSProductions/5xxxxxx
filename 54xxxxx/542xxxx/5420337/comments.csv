,Kyle_Rector,2010-03-08T17:39Z,"I don't think the guy plagiarizes anything.  If anything, he provides a great package of language software.  

It appears that he posted one of the first English (American) postings way back in Aug '08.  (Not to mention all of the other languages.)  Where was yours?

Thank you for your great work.

Some people just haven't learned to say 'thank you'.  "
,MoonDookie,2010-03-09T09:25Z,"it would appear Library.Source didn't give props to VasiaZozulia's work for the source of this re-post . 

thank you both for all your great work..
cheers "
,quilleran,2010-03-25T01:11Z,"Thanks for putting all of the files in one complete package, and marking it so.  I've spent more hours than I care to count trying to find bits and pieces of the whole package scattered around the net.  You're the only one that I've found that appears to do the work for us.

Keep up the good work."
,ato080,2010-05-02T17:10Z,"I've been horse-whipped to learn Spanish so I got RS here at PB to give it a go.  My wife, who is Hispanic, knows English but uses wrong words sometimes (gets kitchen and chicken mixed up).  So, I guess she'll have her own RS now to bring her skills up to speed.  

Thanks for the package!"
,ato080,2010-05-04T18:45Z,"Got the package.  Now, please share, in these comments, the name of the application needed to run/utilize this package.  That would be helpful.

Thanks."

,Robsond76,2010-07-19T19:07Z,"@ato080

If you ever get around to reading this comment, you need to download the Rosetta Stone program first:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5210152/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.5___Crack(VasiaZozulia)


then simply install the packages.


@Library.Source

Excellent torrent, thanks alot for contributing. Your work is much appreciated ^^ Cheers.

10 Thumbs up"
,Robsond76,2010-07-19T19:12Z,"For those not understanding, Here is a guide-

1.Download main application of Rosetta Stone and install it:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5210152/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.5___Crack(VasiaZozulia)
2.Download this English package.
3.Download PowerISO (from thepiratebay) or Daemon Tools Lite, and mount the ISO images of each language level in this torrent.
(If you dont understand number 3, after installing PowerISo or Daemon, a virtual drive is created. then you navigate over to the iso file in the language package, right click, and look for MOUNT to Drive.)
4. "
,Robsond76,2010-07-19T19:24Z,"alright guys, complete step by step.


STEP 1: Pirate search for PowerISO, download it, install it.
STEP 2: go here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5210152/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.5___Crack(VasiaZozulia)
----Download main Rosetta Stone program, install it as it says in the instructions.

STEP 3:Download this full language package, thanks to Titan.Reign.
Step 4: Open one of the folders of the languages. If you installed PowerISO correctly, the ISO file will look like a 
golden Disc. Right click it, go down to the PowerISO menu, and click on Mount to:(whatever drive).

Noob explanation: What is going on is, the Rosetta Stone Language pack, to be installed, needs to verify that the original 

disk is in the computer. PowerISO simulates a virtual disk into the computer, tricking Rosetta Stone to believing that all 

is well. By mounting it, you have Virtually put the cd into the computer. If you open your computer folder, you will now 

see a virtual cd there. (:

STEP 5: After mounting, open the main Rosetta Stone program, look for the button to add languages and click it. Rosetta 

Stone will search for the Language cd. If you mounted the cd correctly, all will progress as planned.

STEP 6: Mount all the other language ISO files and Install. Be sure to unmount the cds again at the end when you finish by 

the same process as step 4.

STEP 7: Express gratitude to Titan.Reign for the torrent on thePirateBay.org.

Will answer any questions, feel free to ask.

Cheers!"

A good one it ConvertX but i recommend downloading the pro one off here because if you download the free one then if you try and watch the movie then words will show up on the screen through the whole movie :)"

you guys might be competition, but show some respect. kudos to Library.Source for some great ulds, i have gotten some good shit from him. this shouldn't be about dissing your comp, but working with them, getting some better u'lds in there. and yeah, it is a good idea to credit a repost.

I installed the level 3 but I do have access only to a part of the lessons, only lesson 1 and lesson 2, for the other lessons it asks me to register the Rosseta Stone by entering a serial number. Do you know how can I get the serial number so I can unlock the other lessons?
Thank you"
,rivanov,2011-03-10T21:28Z,"Don't waste your time downloading this torrent. All of the ISO files are either corrupt, or when attemping to install them produce ""minor errors"", which are really fatal errors. Disk 1 does not register as a valid ISO file, and Disk 5 will load but does not contain any language information. The rest Disks 2 - 4, all give the ""minor errors""."

,armchair.53,2011-06-08T05:43Z,"I ran into 2 problems that others might have so I wanted to share the problem and solution. I am using Vista 32 bit

(1) The application would not install saying there was a problem with the windows installation.  This was caused because the Windows Firewall service was not started as I use Zone Alarm for my firewall.  For some reason, the application needs windows firewall to be on.  So I turned it on and then application installed fine.  I then turned it back off with no problem.  That is, the application only needs windows firewall to install not to run.

(2) I was unable to load any languages as the application did not see the .iso files when mounted with virtual clone.  However, I installed an alternate virtual device, Daemon-lite-tools, which is free, and then it worked fine.

Finally, I always do a virus check and found everthing to be clean."

I just simply played it in WINAMP, and it works great in my computer. 
I even copied the Audio in cd and it took me only 5min to do it. I am listening to it now...
The activity book...just unzipped it using the Evaluation Version; then I scrolled down & looked for the documentation and opened it with the help of Foxit Editor....and it is printable!
Everything works fine and free...
Thank You ""Library Source""...

,justtrucking,2011-08-27T18:39Z,"@Library.source:  I just want to say Thanks you very much for this upload. I just register to say thank you since I notice some individuals who rather talk shit than just to say a simple thank you.

For those of you who are having problems: once you install the language levels it might update them. If it does that will cause it to ask for a SERIAL NUMBER. Solution that worked for me: I updated the L1-L5 as normal, then I used the rosetta stone v3.4.7 crack and everything worked just fine. v3.4.7 crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5852393/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.7___Crack%28VasiaZozulia%29
