degung rampak suling

beautiful quiet album of indonesian music.

i have no idea what it is. i grabbed this from an old cassette that i got from a friend many years ago. it was one of his favourites, and is still one of mine. if anybody can tell me what it is then i'd be very grateful to hear.

i've listened to quite a bit of gamelan music, but i find this one exceptional; (although there is rather a lot of outstanding music from indonesia, i must say)
it sounds simple, straightforward, brillant, and very moving indeed.

Nine tracks - no titles either. sorry about that.
year? - timeless -

enjoy!

cheers
