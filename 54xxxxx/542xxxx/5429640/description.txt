I searched high and low on almost every torrent site looking for a good copy of this movie which I really like. I like to download ISO's or the VOB files as I like to have good quality and make DVD's rather than VCD's. I searched high and low for a good copy and never found one so I decided to make one. I did a 4 pass encoding of an AVI I downloaded which took 2 days to encode so it is about the best quality you are going to get unless you have a RIP of the actual DVD, but the quality is not much shy of a RIP of the actual DVD. So anyhow I made the best quality copy possible and put into an ISO ready to burn with a copy of the cover image. Pleas enjoy and reseed as I will be the only one seeding until others get a copy. Here are links to the synopsis on imdb but I imagine if you are reading this you already know all about the movie :-).
