,nikola434,2010-08-25T21:29Z,Keygen didn't work for me...
,LSDman,2010-09-23T10:38Z,I think the keymaker is a virus.
,neogen45,2010-11-22T07:28Z,"Meh, keygen doesn't work, likely a virus but I can't confirm as it doesn't leave any goodies behind when run in a virtual environment(certain virsuses can detect if they're being run in a virtual environment and won't infect said environment). In any case, not worth the download and risk of infection."
,plescra,2011-05-23T14:43Z,"The keygen just flashes. Even with this bug, it does work. All you have to do is freeze your screen to copy the key. =)"
,kamikazetg,2011-09-04T18:30Z,"Keygen.exe is not infected. It's a DOS program..that is why it closes immediately. If you open it in a command prompt, you will see it's fine.

Scanned and confirmed..nothing more than a simple console cout program that spits out the keygen."
