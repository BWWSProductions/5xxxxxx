 -  - - ----- - Description - ------------------------------------- - -  -

    (1) Web Automation / Web Scripting

    iMacros lets you record and replay repetitious work. iMacros programmatically 
    interacts with any and all websites. It fills out forms and automates the 
    download and upload of text, images, files and web pages. You can import or 
    export data to/from using CSV & XML files, databases or any other source to 
    and from web applications. iMacros includes support for PDF handling, taking
    screenshots, simulating different user agents and connecting to proxy servers. 
    It is the only web automation software that works with every website.

    The iMacros Scripting Interface gives you full programmatic control over the
    web browser, so even the most complex tasks can be scripted. It can be used 
    with all scripting or programming languages. There is no awkward vendor-specific 
    scripting language to learn. You can even ship iMacros with your application. 
    The Scripting Edition comes with a special redistribution license without
    royalty fees. More...

    The Scripting Interface can also be used to update Excel and Access from
    the web.

    (2) Data Extraction/Web Scraping/Web Mining/Enterprise Data Mash-Ups

    iMacros can perform tasks that are the exact opposite of form filling, finding 
    and extracting text (prices, product descriptions, stock quotes, etc.) and 
    images from websites. iMacros includes full Unicode support and works with every 
    language, including multi-byte languages such as Chinese. More...

    (3) Web Testing

    Use iMacros for functional, performance, and regression testing of web
    applications. iMacros is the only tool that can automate in-browser tests
    with Internet Explorer and Firefox. It is also the only tool to perform
    in-browser tests of Java, Flash, Flex or Silverlight applets and all AJAX 
    elements. The built-in STOPWATCH command captures exact web page response 
    times for every step of a process. More...

    (4) Form Filler on Steroids and Password Manager

    iMacros eliminates the tedious repetition of checking the same sites every 
    day, remembering passwords, and filling out web forms. iMacros is the only 
    form filler that can autofill web forms that stretch over several pages. All 
    information is stored in human-readable, plain text files that can be edited 
    easily. Passwords are stored securely with secure 256-Bit AES encryption.

    iMacros is a good alternative solution to Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO). 

    Users memorize only one master password and iMacros remembers all the rest,
    and providing a truly automated login experience that is superior to Single
    Sign-On. More...

    (5) iMacros as Software component

    Add web automation to your applications in minutes rather than weeks or months.
    You get a proven technology that has been tested and debugged for more than
    five years and is used in over 500,000 installations with Royalty Free 
    distribution (iMacros Enterprise Bundles).
