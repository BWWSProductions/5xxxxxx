,BluePanda--x,2010-07-09T18:50Z,"I can\'t get the crack to work, it says \""opening Monkey4.exe...failed!\"" then tries to make me do it manually so I just selected the crack file, but then it says \""access denied, maybe file is write protected\"" and \""patch could not be applied\"". Also, I can\'t find my mounted file in disk management of my computer... help? Thanks!"

I can\'t get the crack to work, it says \""opening Monkey4.exe...failed!\"" then tries to make me do it manually so I just selected the crack file, but then it says \""access denied, maybe file is write protected\"" and \""patch could not be applied\"""
,Cathz182,2010-07-25T16:06Z,"byeef, I had the same problem as you - the issue is that the ""Monkey4"" folder (within Program Files/lucasarts) is read-only so you just have to remove the write protection from the whole folder - once you've done that the crack should work.

I've had a different problem though - dialogue working fine but I've got no music!  Using Windows 7, any ideas?"
,byeef,2010-07-26T02:29Z,"Cathz182, thanks for the help. 

The crack worked,
But now me and you have the same prob. No music. I'm also running it on windows 7.

In the monkey4 torrent install instructions, it says after you apply the crack to start the game from the launcher in launcher folder, but that does not work. And when I launch the game from any of apps (there are 4 launchers) in the monkey4 install folder in Program files (x86) the game works but with no sound. 

I just think its a bad crack..."

But me and u have the same prob now. The crack installed successfully but the game runs with no music.

I'm also running windows 7. In the torrent directions, it says after applying the crack to launch the game using the launcher in the launcher folder. That does not work though. There are 3 launchers in the monkey 4 install folder in program files (x86), one does not work and the other two run the game with no music. 

I think its just a bad crack..."
,byeef,2010-07-26T02:45Z,"Cathz182, thanks. that worked. I'm running 7 64 also.

We have the same prob now though. no music.

Must just be a bad crack..."

,Con_R,2010-09-17T01:54Z,"I managed to install it fine, and copied over the cracked files, but the game keeps freezing between cutscenes and whenever I click the game window minimizes."
