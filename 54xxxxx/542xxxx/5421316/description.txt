PLOT: Itâ€™s the 21st century, but the gods of Mount Olympus and assorted monsters have walked out of the pages of high school student Percy Jacksonâ€™s Greek mythology texts and into his life. And theyâ€™re not happy: Zeusâ€™ lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect. Even more troubling is the sudden disappearance of Percyâ€™s mother. As Percy finds himself caught between angry and battling gods, he and his friends embark on a cross-country adventure to catch the true lightning thief, save Percyâ€™s mom, and unravel a mystery more powerful than the gods themselves.
