Another collection of mods made by players for Bethesda Softworks' Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Most mods are individually compressed within the main .RAR, although there are a few that come as self-extracting executables (.EXE), depending on how they were released. All mods include their original readmes and all other files. WinRAR recommended to open. Enjoy, Morrowind fans, and don't forget to seed!

Long live The Pirate Bay!



A smaller batch this time, only 24 mods, but all have been played & tested during my own gameplay. I don't vouch for their compatability if you choose to use them all at once, there may be a few glitches if they use the same resources, but I can vouch for their independent compatability. Some require Morrowind's expansions, Tribunal and Bloodmoon, which I'm sure you can find around TPB if you look hard enough. It will be stated in the readme for the individual mods if they do have expansion requirements.

Installation is the same as any mods unless otherwise stated
