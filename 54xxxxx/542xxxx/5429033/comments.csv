,randy47,2010-03-12T05:16Z,Thanks for the upload bricktop. Just wondering what programs you use for decrypting and compression. Thanks again mate.
,amitarora78,2010-03-12T12:47Z,"Hey bricktophd please do consider mp4 format as well like pristine. It is more standard format that m2ts.
and most importantly PS3 plays mp4 files as well."
[T],bricktophd,2010-03-12T13:41Z,i use ripbot264 to encode. and no mp4 it doesnt support dolby digital surround that is why pristine went to them when he was uploading.PS3 reads m2ts its what bluray files are originally

,olgamus,2010-03-16T21:59Z,"why is the subtitles very often remove even that the movie is about 4 GB. The subs takes very little space. Not only this movie but many others too.
Long live TPB"
,highrez,2010-03-17T03:20Z,bricktophd is there a way that i can burn these to discs to play on my xbox. i know i can stream it through windows media player but you have a lot of great movies id like to make a library out of.

,aktankit,2010-03-22T18:02Z,"hello guys

i have been downloading m2ts files which have been playing fine on my ps3.
However recently i have been experiencing problems with the audio.
I downloaded m2ts files of 21 and saw 6 and while playing, the dolby digital audio stutters a lot (the blue light on my receiver keeps on blinking). This has been happening only with these two recently downloaded files. Is there a way to fix them?

also i downloaded these files via Vuze and a lot of times my pc shut instantly due to electricity cuts. Can this in anyway corrupt the downloading files. (this was one of the reasons for my psn downloaded demos to not work on ps3).

any help is appreciated"
