,RareNinja,2010-12-08T10:16Z,"@ Givinity: The reason it is called the sorcerers stone in america is cuz therre was a survey done and the majority of americans didnt know what a philosopher was....  they dont realise that a sorcerer and a philosopher are 2 completely different things... so yeah americans are morons (most of em, not all)"

,mjansson89,2011-08-10T14:22Z,"Hi. Whoever's reading this, I need help with this. I've tried many things with this iso, but I'm still not sure what to do. Could someone kind of explain what I'm supposed to do with this? Also, has this iso actually worked for anyone who's downloaded it? And, do you need a PS2 emulator to play it(I'm guessing yes which is probably right)? I've already downloaded PCSX2 0.9.8 (r4600), which is an emulator. Please tell me all the important details. Thanks!!"
