Look man, I am not here to convince you regarding the quality of my Upload
I have uploaded a torrent, attached a Sample
Those who like it can download it, those who don't, Don't

As in your opinion, my upload here is a joke than please go somewhere else. Don't waste your time here
There are many alternatives present in your desired Size in TPB"
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-12T00:08Z,"should probably update your x264

x264 core 68 r1183M f21daff

is pretty old, might get better results with new revision.  I would avoid water marked sources as well.  I don't know who roNy is, nor care."
,]eep,2010-03-12T04:02Z,"hey hey hey quiet down plz!

The quality is pretty good, if you take the size in account. It really is 720p. 
""Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x544 (256:109) 23.98fps [Video]
Audio: AAC 48000Hz stereo [Audio]""

V: 6
A: 6

I think it's not worth watching on my computer-screen because the bitrate is too low which shows in visible banding of dark areas. And I hate banding. 
The sound is good, but I have trouble following the dialogue. 

This is about the same size of movies I put on my mobile (240x320/400). I think I'll use it just for that (after recoding).  

I think it defeats the purpose of High Definition, and therefore it shouldn't be in the ""highres film"" category , but it's not utter crap. So stop complaining. "
[V],RiddlerA,2010-03-12T04:56Z,"Hey Holroses

I have never said all my Uploads are ripped by me 
This is rony's Rip & i do post some of 300mbunited work from time to time

Why waste time in ripping when there is a Better print already ripped by them

And for ""By riddlerA"". i just put it there so that my torrents can be searched easily - just by typing RiddlerA"
,]eep,2010-03-18T23:16Z,"I've watched more than only the samle now and I must say: for the size it's pretty amazing. 
And definitely HighRes.

Who cares if its a rip by someone else if that person isn't going to post it here? 

Thanks again. "
,romi1208,2010-05-01T08:22Z,"if its 720p why have you given v-6
