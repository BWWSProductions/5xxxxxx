  Registry Workshop is an advanced registry editor. It is a perfect             
  replacement for RegEdit and RegEdt32 which shipped with Windows.              
                                                                                
  In addition to all the standard features, Registry Workshop adds a variety    
  of powerful features that allow you to work faster and more efficiently with  
  registry related tasks.                                                       
                                                                                
  With Registry Workshop, registry editing becomes more safe than ever before.  
  All changes except changing key permissions can be safely reversed (even      
  registry replacing and importing), using multiple levels of Undo. You don't   
  need to worry about making mistakes when editing registry.                    
                                                                                
  Whether you are an advanced user who needs to edit and modify your registry   
  to remove trojan, virus, and spyware entries, a system administrator who      
  needs a safer, more efficient tool to maintain your company's PCs, or a       
  software developer who needs to quickly manipulate registry keys and values   
  during system development, Registry Workshop has the tools that you need.
