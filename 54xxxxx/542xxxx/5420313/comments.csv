1. installed the razors, was aked twice for the disk.sid, pointed the instalation to the game disk...
2. i cippyd all the file from the game disk razor1911 folder to the supreme commander 2 installed folder (bin, gamedate movies, sounds and toc.win.bdf)
3. applyed the crack fix (in SC2/bin i addedsteam_api.dll 112 kb and in game data i added bp.sc2 7.01mb)
4. I used this MP crack  and tried in on SC2 bin and i tried in the steam bin folder, made an steam acc launched stam went to games pointed to add a none steam game pointed to sc2 folder bin Supreme Commander2.exe and the game playes BUT when i click on multyplaer to join no ones there! when i try runing the game from the sc2 folder without steam i get  Connection Faild

WHAT AM I DONG WRONG? Thanks for the help guys..."
,Gottern,2010-03-09T10:44Z,"Buy the game if you want to play MP.

No fix will work because the game gets updated automatically via steam.

Also buy PC games like this so PC gaming won't die."
,drazenm,2010-03-09T11:07Z,"Gottern i doubt you registerd to come here and say the crap you did, if you want to play mister riches go and suck rupert murdoc's cock! Now does anyone have anything to say about my problem with with MP? and how to resolve it, thank you ^_^"
,Pookypsy,2010-03-09T11:40Z,"@gottern i'm not even awnsering this................ buttdumpling

@drazenm unzip these files to the supcom2/bin install folder NOT the steam /bin folder! other solution: steam seems to take the original install shortcut of the game. erase it (cause the ori shortcut wont work to run this game)and make a new one out of the exe in the bin folder of supcom2. try to add it again in steam..."
,drazenm,2010-03-09T12:25Z,"thanks for your help Pookypsy, but i cant get it to work really really weird, i can start the game trough the steam application but without it where ever i add the shourtcut or launch the game im just getting the popup 

LOC Engine0013> Unable to start   Connection faild"

,drazenm,2010-03-09T12:39Z,"i tried everything i have no idea whats going on, 

Pookypsy could you please uplod your sc2 bin folder if its not a problem? on a torrent rapid, media etc..."
,Pookypsy,2010-03-09T13:36Z,"@drazenm that wouldnt solve your problem i think... ok step by step: first delete the hole game, its a razor installer so u wont find it in software/programms. make a new fresh install. (crack fix etc.)when its done try to start the game... (start exe in bin folder) you'll be able to start single player as normal but get an connection failure if you try to go multiplayer.

copy these files here in the /bin folder of supcom2... add the game as non steam on steamplatform... start(the little steam massage in the lower right corner will appear), if you get no connection problem (firewall!)you did it all right, even if there are no games open, thats because there are no players at this moment!!!

p.s. visit the tunngle channel for more info, there are ppl helping out."
,honkenill,2010-03-09T14:05Z,"I do however doubt that we can see the legit players since they have their game patches.

I did however find around 10 matches, but I assumed they were all pirates, who knows. :)

Correct me if I'm wrong."
,Pookypsy,2010-03-09T14:20Z,your are right! im sorry but my kung fu isnt good enough for patches... :-/
,NanoEntity,2010-03-09T22:57Z,"Yes you can only play with the pirates only, not with the retail players as there patch is different.

Maybe if someone cracks the new patch, then we can play with the retail players

However for now your only limited to play with the pirates over MP.

Its not really so bad :) at least we have working MP.

Its very simple to play over MP

Download RAZOR copy of the game, download Razor FIX, and download this MP Fix.

Install Sup commander
Copy Crack from Razor from the ISO overwrite all files.
Copy over razor Fix and overwrite
Copy over MP Fix and overwrite all files.

And there ya go."
,Wulfbiter,2010-03-10T02:23Z,So i went to play this with a friend and he can see other games and I cannot; I also cannot see games that he hosts and he cannot see games that I host. Any ideas?
,NanoEntity,2010-03-10T05:23Z,"that is router problem, firewall XD...

Open ports..."
,Bersercker,2010-03-10T08:18Z,"Now, if someone would upload patches, that would be great. Cause too much units/tactics are useless in 1.0 verion... It'll never be as good as supcom:fa though...
p.s. 
3.  ""get steam and a account (better not a legit one ;))""
Some people might think that you are reffering to steam emulator. ^^"
,elitegamernl,2010-03-10T15:08Z,"3 . i mean with that
get steam (real one)
and create an account (just for this)"
,Pookypsy,2010-03-10T15:09Z,"well i've already met two ppl from australia that cant find any games but installed everything right. i think its a ping or latency issue...

@bersercker ya but the problem is that this game isnt that famous that razor would bring every single new patch cracked :("
,elitegamernl,2010-03-10T15:41Z,"i think RELAODED will bring the patches to uss
lol

,MongaNOR,2010-03-11T01:32Z,"This works even after steam updates SC2 for people who's bought it, you don't get the update but the game doesn't seem to do version checks... ;o)"

,Ragntard,2010-03-12T02:09Z,If someone could upload this to another site/torrent? :)
,NanoEntity,2010-03-13T05:54Z,"If you have Engine problem, you have to restart steam and start the game from steam.

Add the game as None steam game and start it."
,nighthawk21,2010-03-14T00:16Z,"With the original crack to this game, there are many more maps available to play, including the other 4v4 map. For some reason this crack doesn't allow these maps to be selected in MP or in Skirmish.

I tested and switched back the files and sure enough the Razor crack lets me play all the maps. But for multiplayer this seems to be the only way to make it work.

Anyone have any ideas?"
,ultrapieman,2010-03-15T22:29Z,this works great :)
,NanoEntity,2010-03-16T19:53Z,"NOTE:
If you have no games in steam, add a DEMO

,NanoEntity,2010-03-23T06:56Z,"Supreme Commander 2 Update 1 to 3 Proper-SKIDROW 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5455515/Supreme_Commander_2_Update_1_to_3_Proper-SKIDROW

Tested this and yeah it works online with this patch and crack, shame SKIDROW removed steam from steam_api.dll, so you cant play online with people with steam_api.dll that is contained in this release.

Your still forced to use the older version of the steam_api.dll that can be downloaded from SC2 MP FIX.

Too bad, wish SKIDROW would keep steam in the dll, the older version has bugs but it dose allow you play online.

Anyways feel free to Update and use this MP FIX to play Online Games."
,Fakkom,2010-05-03T12:43Z,"(Hungary - Magyar infók)

Nekem 100%-ig m?ködik, leírom, hogyan.

------
El?ször is töltsd le a gémet, muszály, hogy RAZOR-os legyen, szerintem. Bár én egy tárhelyr?l szedtem le, de ez ugyanaz, elvileg:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5405686/Supreme_Commander_2-Razor1911

Ez egy ISO (7,31 GB) lesz, amiben "".sid""-ek vannak, és tartalmazza a Razor1911 alap crack csomagot, ami igen, tényleg 3,02 GB. 

Amikor telepíted a gémet, a "".sid"" fájlokat kérni fogja, add meg azt a meghajtót, amelyikben beolvastad az ISO-t (deamon tools-al 

például). Miután felraktad, a Razor1911 mappából értelemszer?en másold be a dolgokat és írd felül amiket lehet. (Igen, alapból nincs 

supremecommander.exe !) 
------
Ezzel még nem indul a játék, kell a fix:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5406880/Supreme_Commander_2_Crackfix-Razor1911___upload_madwiggyNLD

Ha minden igaz, akkor vagy egy ""rzr-sc2f.001"" fájlt fog tartalmazni, amit simán meg lehet nyitni, mintha egy mappát nyitnál meg, 

vagy pedig a benne lév? két fájlt:
Bin -> steam_api.dll
Gamedata -> bp.scd

Ezeket is értelemszer?en a helyükre kell másolni és felülírni a felülírhatót.
------
Ezután tesztelheted, hogy elindul-e a játék és, hogy tudsz-e vele játszani. Ha a Multiplayer -> Host-ra nyomsz, akkor visszadob a 

Winfosba a játékot bezárva.

Most leszeded ezt a torrent, ahol éppen vagy:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5420313/Supreme_Commander_2_MP_fix

Ez egy "".rar"", tartalmaz két fájlt, amit a ""bin"" mappában lév? másik kett?re kell felülírni. (CSINÁLJ BIZTONSÁGI MENTÉST err?l a két 

fájlról, mert, ha nem megy a steam-ed, akkor a büdös életben nem fog elindulni a játék. Gondolj arra, ha például nincs internet, de 

ezzel akarsz singli-zni vagy kampányolni !!! Ilyenkor csak visszamásolod a biztonsági mentést és játszhatod online nélkül.)
------
Most le kell töltened egy ""steam""-et. Ezt akár a steam hivatalos honlapjáról is ingyenes megteheted:
http://steam.en.softonic.com/

Regisztrálsz benne egy felhasználót, majd bejelentkezel. Lehet update-lni fog, ez nagy mániája a steam-nek. Ha bejött a rendes 

kezelhet? steam, (már megy a reklám 1000-rel) akkor a fenti sávban, ahol ezek vannak: Steam, View, Friends, Games, Help. Ott 

rányomsz, hogy 
games -> Add non-steam game to my library... 

Ha a listában alapból nincs benne a supremecommander2.exe, akkor a ""browse""-ra kattintva megkeresheted magadtól. Hozáadod 

majd megnyomod: Add selected programs

A steam-et futva hagyod és elindítod a játékot. Ha kiírja hogy: ""connection faliled"" akkor lépj ki a steam-b?l és lépj vissza. Addig 

csináld míg jó nem lesz. Nekem is szokta ezt csinálni, de ez rendbe hozza.

Hibák:

Mikor elindítom a játékot, újra indul a gép, wtf is this ?!
- Ezeket nézd meg:
.NET Framework
Latest Graphic Drivers for your card
Update Direct X
Install PhysX from Nvidia
Nem vagyok biztos benne, de a winfos xp serviz pack 3 lehet nem árt. Ha meg az van, akkor foglalmam sincs, hogy miért csinálja.

Unable to start. Ezt írja ki, mi a fasz ez ?!
- Vagy nem fut a steam-ed, vagy amit már el?bb leírtam, lépj ki és vissza a steam-be."

I reinstalled it, reinstalled steam, created a new account, allowed game at windows firewall, turned off windows firewall, reapplied the Razor1911 folder, then crackfix, then MPfix. The game starts properly, skirmish, campaign is good. I think it's network related I just can't figure it out.

JUST INSTALL AND PLAY- that Simple, its already cracked and patched.

This game is currently Working, Checked and Tested it. And it works Fine, even better then fine, no buggs at all.

Several things you need to remember:
The installation is so easy that it doesn't need a guide. Just read what it's asking you and press next. It's that easy.

Here are the steeps for really NUUB people.
- First step Install Steam and make an account. then Logoff from steam when installing this crack.
- Mount game
- Choose Language
- If it asks, install Net frame If it doesn't skip this step.
- Tic to install DirectX, Visual C++ and SmartSteam
- Choose Steam Version ( Online Multiplayer ) To play ONLINE.
- When you get the Windows Command (window) do not close until you se the text that it's done and press any key to close. ( The installation is slow so be be patient )
- Mini window will pop up and ask you to choose language. Choose language and close it.
- When the installation is done.
Start (SmartSteam) then to start the game go to Star - All programs - Supreme Commander 2 - And press on (Play.exe)

You are done now. and can play Online with others.
