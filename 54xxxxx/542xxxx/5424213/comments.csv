,mykieGStar,2010-10-16T18:13Z,"WILL DEFO SEED WHEN IM ONLINE FOR ABOUT A MONTH OR SO SO PEOPLE MAY VIEW THIS INCREDINLE STORY, THE BOOK IS AMAZING

THIS IS AN INCEDIBLELY INSPIRING STORY EVEN THOUGH THE OUTCOME WAS SO VERY TRAGIC, AND RINGS TRUE TO ME AS, FROM TIME TO TIME, I FEEL THE SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS PUT ON US IN OUR MODERN SOCIETY ARE TOO MUCH TO BEAR AND LONG FOR A SOCIETY THAT RESPECT THE SELF RATHER THAN THAT OF THE POPULACE. SELFISHNESS GREED AND CONTROL ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL TODAYS PROBLEMS IN SOCITEY, NOT TO METION THE REASON FOR EVERY WAR EVER FOUGHT. THE HIPOCRISY IS DEAFENING. BUT WITH OUT SELFISHNESS, GREED AND CONTROL WERE WOULD OUR SOCEITY BE. STILL IN THE DARK AGES?? WOULD WE STILL BE IN THE TREES?? WHO CAN ANSWER.  PEACE AND SELF LOVE, RESPECT ALL. AND IF YOU AHVE HAF A BRAIN AND WANT TO USE THIS COMMENT AS A JUMOING OFF POINT FOR A TORRENT (NO PUN INTENDED) IF ABUSE, THEN PLEASE.....RECONSIDER"
