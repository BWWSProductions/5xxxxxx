A few words about MIXAMIX 2009

Dear music and trip lovers. 

2009 was a very busy year with lack of free time,attractive new sounds from the electronic music scene and finally less inspiration.Unfortunately, last year's great summer forest fires destroyed many of the places I used to drive around refreshing my mind and energy,draining my party mood.

This mix started on January of 2009 and finished on December of the same year so it took me quite long to finish.
So due to the lack of inspiring new music I had to turn a bit back into time but with a fresh view. 

So new a version of Children is hugging the Armnin's In and Out of love, just to prove that Armin is so inspired by this all time classic. Apoptygma Berzerk takes us to the more Progressive trance part of the mix which peaks with Astral Projection's - Mahadeva! Trying then to be a bit more oldshool I use breakbeat sounds toI get upto Art of Noise's - Instrument of Darkness. A track I first heard in a PC demo in my early computer days back in the 90s.

IIO - Rapture is a track I have used before in my mixes but I felt it would fit in here too. DJ shadow keeps the beat up and takes as to Infinity. The track that returned from the 80s to conquer 2009! And what is best than its company the Kraftwerk version of Popcorn.
From then on, I try to be a bit in the mainstream side. I 've used songs that my gf likes (Akcent - Thats My Name). Since on the mainstream side I wanted so much to use Sakis Rouvas - This is our night. Last year's Eurovision greek song. Still waiting for a better mix for that. It has so much potential. 

I know this mix does not have the consistency of my previous ones, but consider it a seasonal mix and if you hear closely enough you will understand
the time marks! As always I the songs are mixed in a way that I can create something new out of them! I hope you will enjoy this mix riding you wild horses as much as I do! 

Since the beginning of this year I am gathering much more interesting tracks and I hope I will be able to release I new MixAMix soon!

Keep traveling, sharing music and have fun!
