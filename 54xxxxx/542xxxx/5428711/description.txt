From Wiki:



Limblifter is a Canadian alternative rock group from Vancouver, formed in 1996.


The group was originally formed by brothers Ryan Dahle and Kurt Dahle, as a side project from their main band, Age of Electric. Ian Somers was the band's other member. Their self-titled 1996 album, recorded after a mere 10 practices[1], spawned the Canadian Top 40 hits "Tinfoil", "Vicious" and "Screweditup", but the band was hindered by staff alterations at their label Mercury Records. The group subsequently went on hiatus when Age of Electric regrouped for their 1997 album Make a Pest a Pet.

When AOE subsequently broke up, however, Limblifter was revived as the Dahles' primary band, releasing Bellaclava in 2000. Although that release wasn't as successful commercially as Limblifter, the singles "Ariel vs. Lotus" and "Wake Up to the Sun" were popular on radio.

Kurt Dahle subsequently left the band in 2001 to concentrate on The New Pornographers. Ryan Dahle carried on with new members Meegee Bradfield, Dave Patterson, touring drummer Burento Follett, and studio drummer Pat Steward, releasing I/O in 2004.

Bradfield, Steward and Dahle have all gone on to work with Matthew Good, with Steward becoming Good's new drummer for his subsequent solo career after his band, the Matthew Good Band, became defunct.
