,grassmudhorse,2010-03-18T17:09Z,"This one doesn't work! The stealth is good but the data is corrupted (anydvd corruption + game data CRC fail). In other word, you can play it, but it will get you banned!"
,grassmudhorse,2010-03-18T17:40Z,"I need to correct my comment above. I downloaded the file in Mac and test it in win7 under the Mac file system (yes, win7 can mount Mac file system). However, win7 somehow has problem reading the file correctly. So I got this Anydvd error. Then I retest it in Mac, it's fine now. Sorry for the previous comment."
