,mathyou9,2010-03-15T09:12Z,"Excellent rip!  So I'm not complaining or anything, but I'm curious why in the SRT subtitles (not the spoken text, but ONLY the accompanying descriptive text) it seems that for every instance  there *should* be a letter ""S,"" the letter ""D"" is displayed instead.

e.g., The SRT file has ""HOLMED: [dialogue]"" when it should be ""HOLMES: [dialogue]""  Or ""[HORDED WHINNYING]"" (*horses*) and ""[MAN CHANTING INDIDTINCTLY]"" (*indistinctly*)"

,Skogswald,2010-03-16T21:09Z,It seems FXG need to step up the game when it comes to A/V sync. Both their Sherlock Holmes and their Precious release where off by approx 200ms.

,clshnr,2010-03-25T22:14Z,"I stopped downloading FXG for a while because of the audio sync problem, after noticing this in a lot of their releases, and this was a few months ago. Now, I finally decide I might try them again and still the problem remains.

I don't really understand what you guys are doing, but I'm not using crappy VLC for resync just because you can't do it right like everyone else.

I'll give it another go in a few months, but for now I'll just get other releases."

,schmitty84,2010-04-13T04:34Z,The reason it is out of sync is probably due to wrong settings on the burning program. ConvertX is the worst about this anymore it seems. I just stream movies to my 360 anymore. It seems better to just convert them to the correct codec for the codec and go from there.
,ThePalindorme,2010-04-15T21:26Z,"sync problems??
People just watch it on your pc would ya.......if you want a hd copy for your ps3 or 369 or whatever just buy it......

,g253,2010-04-25T16:30Z,"LOL @Suspira79 :-)
The comments about the sound being out of synch are right, and it is noticeable enough to be annoying. So if you don't use a media player that can fix this, don't download. But as others pointed out, if you use VLC it's no trouble at all. Advanced settings > synchronisation > +200ms and the synch is perfect."
,kian89,2010-04-29T21:06Z,"man y not in 700mb ???
i love your share that way .
cuz it is a real share ..
cuz we can burn cd and share with others who dont have internet"
,Kanegasi,2010-05-02T01:49Z,"@clshnr

It's not crappy. It can play anything and everything. If you're judging it's ""crappiness"" based on Windows Media Player, Winamp, or other so-called popular media players, you're fucking nuts. I honestly have nothing against Winamp, but I myself prefer VLC. MPC from the awesome CCCP gang is also awesome in this sense, but both VLC and MPC have their share of awesomeness and basically can undergo a centuries-long battle for awesomeness."
,Ash.S,2010-05-02T02:32Z,"thank you :)

,yelloo,2010-05-04T13:10Z,Thanks FXG_team.
,wilsons,2010-05-04T21:12Z,"Ghost and Dopest are right. I was sent a letter from my Internet Provider saying that this is my final warning (I had gotten one a few months ago for a different torrent) to stop sharing copyright-protected works. If I had a scanner I would upload the letter for yall. Look at my comment history, I don't just go around scaring people. I think they must have a tracker in the torrent and then nail random people.

P.S. This is the first FXG torrent I have ever had a problem with, but I strongly recommend downloading from a different source."

It's not even hard to download something like the CCCP... get a clue people!

,HPrestore,2010-12-08T03:27Z,"Thanks for this movie! VLC Player and Media Player Classic are the best media players because the quality is fine, and it can play almost any media file. Besides, the CCCP has communist all over their website."
