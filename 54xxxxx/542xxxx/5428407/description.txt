Alcatraz was built to keep all the rotten eggs in one basket, and I was specially chosen to make sure that the stink from the basket does not escape.
Since Ive been warden, a few people have tried to escape.
Most of them have been recaptured; those that havent have been killed or drowned in the bay.
No one has ever escaped from Alcatraz.
And no one ever will!


Quando compi gli anni?
Non lo so.
Cristo, che razza di infanzia hai avuto?
Breve...



PLOT
Escape from Alcatraz is a 1979 American thriller film, directed by Don Siegel and starring Clint Eastwood that dramatizes the one possibly successful escape from the maximum security prison on Alcatraz Island. The film co-stars Fred Ward, and also features Patrick McGoohan as the suspicious, vindictive warden, and features the film debut of Danny Glover.

The film is based on the non-fiction book Escape from Alcatraz by J. Campbell Bruce.[citation needed]

It chronicles the story of Frank Morris (Eastwood) and brothers John (Ward) and Clarence Anglin (Jack Thibeau), who have the distinction of being possibly the only people to ever escape from the Alcatraz prison.

A cold, atmospheric thriller, the film captures many of the difficulties of prison life and the conditions of Alcatraz prison before it was closed down permanently, shortly after the escape.

There is some hint at the end of the film that the escape was successful, but in fact it remains a mystery as to whether the escapees succeeded or not.
