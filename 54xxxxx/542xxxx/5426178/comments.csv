The government already has systems like Medicare and Medicaid and they are hopelessly inefficient and problematic.  How can anyone believe that a national public option would be any better when damn near everything the government touches turns to shit.

There are many ways to improve access and affordability of health care without such costly and problematic measures.  Among them are Health savings accounts, tax reformation, making it easier and more worthwhile for doctors to donate care, Tort reform, removing the immunity of insurance companies from antitrust, allowing purchasing insurance across state lines, dealing with the enormous impact of illegal immigrants and finding a way to help people in need with preexisting conditions that doesn't involve destroying the entire premise of health insurance, just to name a few.

You can't buy car insurance to cover repairs after a wreck or life insurance on a loved one after they die.  You can buy life insurance across state lines and to a widow who has lost her husband is it not as important as health insurance?  People say health care is a right and it is immoral for people to make a profit providing it.  Do these people feel the same way about the grocer down the street that they buy their food from.  Is not food every bit as important for a person's survival?  No one has a right to another's life, which can be measured in time, regardless of whether they have an MD after their name.

This doesn't mean there shouldn't be something done to help people in need, but the way the Dems are going about it, heedlessly expanding the size and scope of the state and selfishly exploiting the issue, is just going to spread suffering like water on a grease fire."

,BarrySoetoro,2010-03-11T14:11Z,"""This is why elections matter and Majority rules""

Have you looked at Obama's approval rating lately? How about the support for these bills?

Here's what happened: A bunch of distracted, pop-culture obsessed sheeple were marketed a fictional persona. They all bought their little t-shirts, commemorative plates, key chains and bumper stickers, and once the pretty colours and glitter was over with, went back to watching American Idol and Survivor.

Then said fictional persona reads a teleprompter and says ""uhh"" at the end of every sentence, lying the entire time and breaking or bending almost every campaign promise... his only supporters now are, in order:

Idiots
Lazy people
Government workers
Militant blacks
Communists"

The Dems are blatantly ignoring the rules they once vigorously defended.  This is a matter of public record.

""Medicaid and Medicare inefficient? Wait a minute if people have a problem with Government Health Care they are free to pay for their own""

Bureaucratic interference and rationing will be forced upon people as the program supplants non state run options.  This will cost lives and lead to great suffering.

""If you are talking about the cost of those programs I never hear Republican pushing to end them""

Are you serious?  Why would they?  The threat of Republicans getting rid of these programs, as well as social security, is a very old fear tactic of democratic politicians use to win elections.

""The Government runs the Military, Police, FBI, CIA, etc...But no one ever complains about them""

There many issues with the care the military receive despite substantial funding.  Claiming that no one complains about them is flat out wrong.  As for the FBI, here is some clairifying data to consider from their website:

""FBI employees are eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program. The FEHB is the nation's largest employer-provided health benefits program and consists of approximately 270 health insurance plans from which FBI employees may elect. Types of plans include traditional fee-for-service plans (in which the employee may seek the services of any doctor, hospital, pharmacy, or other medical provider) and comprehensive medical plans (in which the employee joins a Health Maintenance Organization [HMO]). The FBI and employees share the cost of employee and dependent health care coverage.""

This is a far cry from what the democrats are currently pushing for.

""...There are many ways to control cost of Health Care but WTF is Health savings accounts?""

Tax free accounts where people can put aside money for medical expenses, similar to a retirement account.

""And how can that pay for people Health Care where the prices are sky high?""  

Socializing insurance and creating additional layers of bureaucracy between doctors and patients have been clearly shown to increase the cost of healthcare as seen in the Canadian and British systems.

""Then tax reformation?...This would imply that Dems or Republicans want less of your money...NOT""

I can't really disagree with this but making improvements to tax write offs to help people afford their own non catastrophic care (medical saving accounts being one such way) would benefit many people.

""Doctors are making a good living with the current system""

Less and less people are pursuing the most needed medical professions, such as family doctors, partly due to the hassles and problems of dealing with government programs.  Again I point to Canada, which is essentially driving out the kinds of doctors it needs the most.  Our situation is indeed different but we can certainly learn from theirs.

""AntiTrust issues sounds like a smoke screen""

Actually this is often a Democrat gripe about Health Insurance providers.  It is not without merit.

""The insurance companies are the problem...What about car, house, and Boat insurance from Texas but living in Florida with all those Hurricanes""

That is between the parties involved but be sure if someone is making repeated claims their premiums will go up substantially.

""Nobody is saying that Health Care is a right""

Tell that to the people that can't seem to shut up about it.

""The Dems are saying Good Health Care is expensive and families just cant afford it...So the Government steps in and offers Health Care...Not take it over""

And how is this going to be funded?  The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.  Just look at New York and how its high taxes are driving out the people who pay the lion's share of those taxes.

""Bottom line"
,booboo332,2010-03-13T04:10Z,"Regarding the health care of our military and how the government has failed them and the role bureaucracy played in this from a source that is most certainly not on the political right:

http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7849279

http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7713650&ps=rs

As much as I can't stand the hateful and humorless ranting his ""comedy"" has devolved to, Bill Maher has it right on one thing, ""We love our troops the way Michael Vick loves dogs.""

I support the decision to go into Iraq or Afghanistan but there have been many failures in the execution of both campaigns by those in charge. (Yes, I realize this is not something Rush will admit. I don't agree with him on everything.)  From Rumsfeld's failure to give our military proper support early on in Iraq to the Democrats who still refuse to acknowledge that the surge worked, there is plenty of blame to go around.

The troops deserve so much better for their courage and sacrifices."
