Hi Guys!

To run:

1. Unpack to c : / games so that you have c : / games / PhantasyStarOnline .

2. Run PSO-reg_this.reg by dubble click it.

3. Copy the two shortcuts to where ever you want them.

4. Execute the orange Phantasy Star Online shortcut to play then select online.

5. Welcome to play at Frezznos.

Optional:

6. To change options execute the PSO options shortcut, but don't play from it. It will lead to somewhere else.



Info:

In the Extras folder are the stuff I've installed. Just included them if you want to revert to original. Plus there are the original PSO execs, if you want them.

In the ExtrasWindowed are the executables for runing PSO in windowed mode. Just copy them to the main folder.

I've also included exec for Vista and win7 users.

Also remember that these execs are ippatches to my ip. To patch it to somewhere else just run the included ippatch.exe .

Last changes notes:

Forgot to mention that extra good sound was also installed. All data was taken from PSO Palace. All cudos to them and none to me what so ever.
