Awesome piece of software... Sorry Guitar Rig 4 PRO you been beaten hands down in my opinion!"
,Doughbot40,2010-03-12T02:20Z,"Oh Ya, Amplitude 3 does sound better!!!!"
,beauzho,2010-03-12T07:05Z,"""Since I could not find a cracked version of Guitar Rig 4, I wanted to put the Full trial version out there in hope of somebody with the knowledge to ""crack"" software for mac.""

Good idea.  No, really!"
,SMEEEEEEEEEEE,2010-03-12T17:20Z,@ Preston_C: Would you mind uploading IK Multimedia Amp 3? That would be an awesome torrent.
,YLight,2010-03-14T12:02Z,"@Preston 

If you say so, Amplitude 3 is my next tryout :) thanks"
,pReStOn_C,2010-03-14T14:38Z,"Download the demo version directly off the IK site way faster for one, and then locate the KeyGen which is floating around on other sites, and from what I hear it works fine. I'd glady up mine but I tried the DEMO and pretty much purchased it straight away! It is that GOOD and makes Amplitude Metal Look Stupid Literally and Guitar Rig look STUPID honestly... Try mac-torrents for the keygen otherwise Google Amplitude 3.0+Keygen+Torrent and you should get you results straight away... But i would seriously suggest purchasing it, if able to afford it. I believe it is an APP that really is worth the $$$"
,brainlesswonder,2010-03-21T23:31Z,"Just download Amplitube 3 from their site. Search the keygen torrent for Amplitube 3.0. They haven't released the keygen for mac yet, but just use crossover and it works fine.

If you don't have crossover than just grab it here.

,The7isbest,2010-03-31T05:01Z,"Sorry, Guitar Rig 4 is amazing... Guitar Rig 3 sucks, but not 4, no way. Amplitube is kinda... not really that good."
,pReStOn_C,2010-04-17T21:42Z,"@The7isbest what ever floats you boat dude, each to there own. For all you others Waves 7 GTR is slightly better than Amplitube 3.1 or you could try Peavey Revalver MKIII which I believe has not been cracked on MAC yet. Thing is you combination of gear for recording. I use a modified  Ibanez RG350DX with full active pickups and ZOOM G9.2tt passed through Firewire Solo. Or simply Mic up the 6505 & cab or the Laney TT100H & cab passed through Firewire Solo, and use maybe a few EQ plugins etc... It's all about getting the sound you want and what your trying to do! "

,Jessebgrind,2011-12-14T00:14Z,Has anyone figured out how to make this work for mac?
