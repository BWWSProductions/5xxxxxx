Since I could not find a cracked version of Guitar Rig 4, I wanted to put the Full trial version out there in hope of somebody with the knowledge to "crack" software for mac.

I tried finding a serial in the lattest issue of SerialBox, but no luck there, hope you guys will have better luck. If you find a solution, please post it here.

Thanks,
