,asimbiju,2010-07-23T22:53Z,Where did u get the first evil dead movie on Blu-Ray? it's not been released on Blu-ray yet....
,Seliphra,2010-07-31T13:28Z,"Unbelievably bad quality. It continuously freezes and I ended up looking at a red ford truck for ten minutes while sound played. Really bad quality, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT. Find a different one."
[T],Fig666,2010-08-02T11:02Z,"Excellent download, great quality, cheers pal."
[T],MrLore,2010-08-22T07:47Z,"Ignore Seliphra.

Beautiful torrent.

Video: 10/10
Audio: 9/10

Whether or not it's been released on Blu-Ray is irrelevant. The resolution and quality is far higher than DVD and indistinguishable from a Blu-Ray rip.

Thanks, GreatMagician (Your shirt is red!)"
,kiledunn,2010-09-28T07:10Z,How dumb are you people they have been released on blu-ray

All 3 movies are MP4 format and come with lots of extra media and items (Not all needed!) 

The quality is amazing, All 3 are way beyond expected for such small file sizes, No freezing, no audio errors, no audio lags, no film lags, Anyone complaining about this torrent should f*ck off and buy the DVD's, It's the internet, You're not paying for the movies, Deal with it."
