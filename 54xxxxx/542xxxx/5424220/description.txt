A female reporter accompanies firefighters on a routine call and ends up trapped with them in an apartment building infected with a ferocious virus. Sealed in and desperate, they trace the contagion to the attic, discovering abandoned research on demonic possession. Now, a medical officer and a SWAT team outfitted with video cameras are sent into the sealed-off apartment to control the situation.
