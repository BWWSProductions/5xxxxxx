,ourfrank,2010-03-16T02:06Z,"Subtitles, anyone?"

,ourfrank,2010-08-25T20:30Z,"Misspantha, thank you for the subtitles, but they seem to be of bad quality.

I quote: ""These subtitles have been machine-translated. It's better than nothing, but some of the subtitles don't make sense. If the uploader is reading this, do you have the original French subtitles? I can try to translate them properly if you do.""

So, it appears we're still lacking proper English subtitles for this movie."
,woodendolls23,2010-10-21T03:26Z,Still no Eng subs? :(
,godlullaby,2010-10-27T16:54Z,Nope no subs. And the only existing subtitles are not very good. As is my french.
