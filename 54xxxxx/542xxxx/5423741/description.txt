All untouched 1509 kbps DTS 96/24 5.1 tracks from the 7 DVD's of the 'Surrounded' box-set (Debut, Post, Homogenic, Selmasongs, Vespertine, Medulla and Drawing Restraint 9) plus the untouched 1509 kbps DTS 5.1 tracks from the DVD-side of Volta: a total of 6 hours and 26 minutes of all the existing 8 'real' studio albums, compiled to one single DVD. All this audio left almost no room for any video, so, apart from the immersive audio, this is a very basic dvd.

* "Surrounded is a box set released on June 27, 2006, featuring seven of BjÃ¶rk's albums in DualDisc format (http://unit.bjork.com/specials/surrounded/). The seven-disc box set contains the original albums on the CD sides, and the DVD sides contain each album remastered in Dolby Digital and DTS 96/24 5.1 surround sound. The corresponding music videos are also featured on the discs and are in PCM 2.0, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1. The original stereo mixes are used for the CD sides and are not remastered."

* "Volta was released in three editions in the UK: a digipak CD edition; a limited edition CD/DVD edition (featuring surround audio in DTS); and a double vinyl edition."

The surround mixing on these albums has really been done extremely well. Many surround mixes (from Metallica and Depeche Mode for instance), have had the same mistake they made in the 60's, when the first stereo mixes became popular, by doing some extreme panning to show off the 'novelty' of the extra channel(s). Very fun at first, but very distracting when you want to start listening to the music again, instead of your s(urr)ound system.

What the extra channels can help create for the music though, is a wider sound stage and less 'muddy', more distinct sounds overall, and that's exactly what's happening on these albums: a very wide, immersive soundstage and perfectly prioritized mixing, with lots of detail. If you know the stereo mixes, you will be able to totally rediscover the albums with these great 5.1 mixes!

Interview with BjÃ¶rk about the album Drawing Restraint 9: For now, most of us can only enjoy the stereo mix of DR9 â€” the 5.1 mixes will be available in mid-2006. "It's kind of sad to have to do that," BjÃ¶rk admits, "but at the same time, if you only make records for people with 5.1 systems, you would just be making music for rich people!" She laughs. "And that's something I don't want to do."

This one's for the poor people. If you enjoy this, and can afford the real deal with all the extra's: please buy it.
