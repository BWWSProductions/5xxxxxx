Alex welcomes back to the show film-maker, broadcaster and former broker and options trader, Max Keiser. Keiser is the host of On the Edge, a program of news and analysis hosted by Iran's Press TV, and he also hosts Keiser Report, a financial tabloid, that broadcasts on Russia Today. Keiser correctly predicted the sub-prime mortgage-backed securities crisis would result in recession and also predicted the break-down of Iceland's economy in 2008.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
