Raised in Corscombe, Dorset, Harvey formed the band (calling it PJ Harvey) as a teenager with drummer Rob Ellis and bassist Ian Olliver, who was replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio released their first album Dry in 1992. Ellis and Vaughan left the band after the release of Rid of Me (1993), and Harvey continued as a solo artist.

Among the accolades she has received have been the 2001 Mercury Music Prize, seven BRIT Award nominations, five Grammy Award nominations and two further Mercury Music Prize nominations. Rolling Stone named her 1992's Best New Artist and Best Singer Songwriter and 1995's Artist of the Year, and placed two of her albums (Rid of Me, To Bring You My Love) on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. She was also rated the number one female rock artist by Q magazine in a 2002 reader poll. Harvey has said that she enjoys performing more than writing and recording because performing is when the music "makes more sense". 

Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea is an album by English singer-songwriter PJ Harvey, released on 23 October 2000. It became the second major commercial success of PJ Harveyâ€™s career, following her successful 1995 breakthrough To Bring You My Love. The album sold slightly over one million copies worldwide. Although it peaked at a modest #23 in the UK Albums Chart, it became a sleeper hit that quietly hung around the middle reaches of the chart for a full year after its release. The album peaked at #42 in the U.S Billboard 200.

Reviews too were exceptionally strong with Rolling Stone praising it as "the best album of her career" and NME hailing it "a magnificent, life-affirming opus" in their 9/10-rated review. According to the music review aggregator Metacritic, it has received an average score of 88, the 4th highest score of 2000. Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea won the 2001 Mercury Prize, and also brought Harvey BRIT Award nominations as Best British Female Artist for two years running, as well as two Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Album and Best Female Rock Performance for the single "This Is Love".

It was ranked 8 on Rolling Stone's list of The 50 Essential "Women In Rock" Albums.

In 2002, Q magazine named "Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea" the Greatest Album of All-Time by a Female Artist.

In 2006, the album was chosen by Time as one of the 100 best albums of all time.

Despite initial criticism, in 2009 Pitchfork Media named the album the 124th Greatest Album of the 2000s.

In 2009, NME also placed the album inside their Top 100 Greatest Albums Of The Decade, at number 6
