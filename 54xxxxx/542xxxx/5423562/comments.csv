-i read that there are 2 for ps2:
moster attack 1,2=global defence force 1,2=earth defence force 1,2 . different names, same game but 2 parts

and can you get those in ntsc?"
[T],thenoobish,2010-03-10T22:40Z,"afgaviria : are you sure that this game ever was released in the USA? because i couldnt find any NTSC version of this game, well i found one in NTSC but it had JAPANESE language.. but if you want i can upload the NTSC version with JAP language of : Earth Defense Force 2"
,afgaviria,2010-03-11T05:44Z,"no, i dont think that any of those were released in the USA.

so you find the second one? or this is the second? and no, please no japanese, PAL is ok but if you find it in NTSC is perfect!"
[T],thenoobish,2010-03-11T16:23Z,"afgaviria: I think that this (Global Defence Force) is the 2nd game in the series.. but I couldn't find the first one with english language. only in Japanese and another in Russian language.. but i dont know if the russian version includes english, but i cant test it..

Do you want me to upload the game Monster Attack that has Russian language? Because it maybe has english language in it... Oh its also PAL"
,afgaviria,2010-03-11T17:56Z,"i dont know dude... i dont want to waste your time uploading that and my time downloading it.

i dont want to be picky or whiny but if you are sure that at least it had english language do it, if not, please dont waste your time.

thanks a lot for taking your time to search it, i really appreciate."
[T],thenoobish,2010-03-11T17:59Z,"yeah sure, no problem."
,afgaviria,2010-03-11T23:26Z,"I just put it in in my ps2 and works flawless.

-and enjoy
