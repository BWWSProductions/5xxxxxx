,anthonysanders,2010-03-09T01:35Z,"You've never let me down before .BONE. Downloading sample right now, I'll let everyone know how it is. "
,anthonysanders,2010-03-09T01:45Z,"Okay, the sample is alright. It looks so much better than a cam, all it needs is a little clean up for the video, and the voices have a little echo, but you can still tell what they are saying. 


best one i've seen so far.

,anthonysanders,2010-03-09T03:43Z,"Actually, if you look at the video, it deff. is better then a cam, all that it needs is a video clean up, and an audio converter. kthanx.

,rich340,2010-03-09T15:19Z,"how can i be ""better than a cam"" when it IS a cam you douche bags. i cant believe how thick some people are. It says CAM in the title"
,rich340,2010-03-09T15:54Z,"@ASIF, ANTHONY:Also, check out the info posted here ON THIS PAGE and if your still lost on what its source was then check out the NFO. if your capable of openeing one that is lmao.
And ofr those who thank the uploader for the effort; do u perhaps thimnk that the uploaders create the files? actually go out with a cam, source audio files resync or anything at all.....well no they do not. they grab the torrent from another website, sometimes they just re up a torrent which is already on the same site. doesnt happen with the trusted ones. the green, purple skulls u can trust. BUT dont confuse them with SCENES. like nDn who released this one they are the ones you should be thanking for the effort. the uploader gets thanks for the share."

,garfiel,2010-03-10T06:38Z,"Okay its free but not a great cam.

Sample looks slghtly better better than the general movie.

It has a 5.5 degree lean to the right from the start of the movie and at about 65 minits into it, it tilts even more for 6 minits then is moved back to about a 5 degree lean and then then 2 thirds of the righthand side is blocked by something for 9 minits, so not much to see then, just listen.

If you need to see it NOW then its watchable, probably.  Sound is a bit hollow, mayby a lot hollow depends on the person.

I only downloaded it to skim through it and see how scary it was b4 taking the kids to it.

Now it was suitable for that, but if you really want to watch and enjoy it, wait for a better one or go to the movies.

Now as to rating it, I wouldn't begin to try, as one mans 5 is anothers 8 and some one elses 2.

Its free and if you have unlimited bandwidth go for it, but if not wait for a better one or at least an R5."
