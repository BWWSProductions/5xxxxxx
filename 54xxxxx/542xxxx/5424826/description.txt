Jacques Brel is without any doubt one of the greatest singer-songwriters of all time. Due to the fact he sings almost exclusively in French and sometimes in Flemish (Dutch) he is not very well known in the English speaking world.

Well this is your chance to educate yourself in the art of the French "chanson" performed by one of the all time giants!
