,king03jeff,2010-03-12T14:01Z,"Very nice rip.

A/V: A perfect 10.

Would like it if all your rips were BluRays :)"
,moviefreak24,2010-03-12T17:32Z,"@the-legend89: Now Im no expert when it comes to this stuff either, but the download speed of your torrents is still dependent on the amount of seeders and leachers. And also dependent on your connection speed. I think I can say with certainty that you will not reach the maximum speed of your new router. I know of no one who can dowload torrents with such a speed. Connect to your router and enable UPNP. Also enable it in your Bittorrent client. a Port will now automatically be forwarded. I hope this helps you out a bit. Like I said Im no expert at this stuff, just know a thing or 2. Used portforward.com myself to configure my router and my connection is said up correctly now. if you are not familiar with that site, check it to see if if you can configure your router. They have guides on portforwarding for most brands of routers on that site ;)"

game works fine but while i`m playing in the middle of the screen at the weapon marker, while i move the mouse a lot of triangles ar showed come directly from the weapon pointer.......now my guess is that its a graphic error???"
,ppface2288,2010-03-13T07:50Z,"Oh sorry i thought it came out sooner, thanks man"
,cupofblue,2010-03-13T15:23Z,"@the-legend89 I limit the upload speed to ~10% of my maximum actual bandwidth. Unlimited upload speed is 1 of the main reasons for terrible download speed, apart from Seeders/Leechers' upload speed. Besides, byte and bit is different."
,Tazza006,2010-03-13T19:01Z,I am a new user and am finding it difficult to understand how to download the movie and watch it. Can anyone help please
,sumbawdy,2010-03-15T01:50Z,don't bother downloading unless it's extremezone!
,sumbawdy,2010-03-15T04:00Z,can i get a seed? dl at 30kbs...
,olcanucklehead,2010-03-15T04:41Z,"i have already downloaded some of your torrents.they are all great! thank you so much.....now, i'm downloading this one....pls, seed.........."
,listenherenow,2010-03-28T12:54Z,"This may seem like a dumb question but I have to ask,  and I realize this is not blue ray, - I have never downloaded a blue ray - will a blue ray torrent play on a dvx player?  do you hav to burn them to a blue ray disk? will they play off a usb drive like a normal torent?"
,listenherenow,2010-03-29T07:01Z,"This is an awesome Rip - seems perfect to me - 

  Thanks

a 10 v 10.   i do not know why anyone would look further. really"
,jml4130,2010-04-03T00:38Z,Thanks
,Zombie_Boy,2010-06-06T11:15Z,"Thanks for the upload. However are there any english subtitles for this BDRIP please??  Any1 out there care to prove their piracy genoristy please?
"
,Zombie_Boy,2010-06-06T11:23Z,"By the way, for thsoe who dont know what BDRips is, BDRip means Blue Ray Disk Rip and are much much better than DVDRIPS. BDRips are encoded directly from the BluRay disk, so should be  of better quality than a DVDRip. They usually have a resolution of 720p (or 1080p), and are encoded using the matroska (.mkv) container and x264 codec. Bluray Rips are far superior to DVD rips. A DVD rip is often around 640Ă272 pixels which equals .174 Megapixels per frame. A Bluray rip is often relased at 1280X720 pixels, which equals .921 Megapixels per frame. ANY LCD will resolve more than the 272 vertical pixels a typical DVD rip contains!! Adios DVDRips"
,Zombie_Boy,2010-06-06T11:45Z,"and @ Tazza006, go to google search engine and type this words in 'how to download a torrent' and follow instructions carefully, believe me its easy. 

and @ listenherenow, no u dont need to burn the blueray on blueray cds u can watch them straight away on ur computer or laptop after u finish  downloading. U can also burn them on dvd disk, i use convertxtodvd software for that and later watch it on my tv screen by playing it on my ps3. And i dnt know abt dvx player but u can certainly watch blueray rips on a vlc player, thats for sure. Just do a google search for it and u can get it for free. "
