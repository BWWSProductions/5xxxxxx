Usual work done. Filesize is a bit larger than the normal ones because it is a 3hr movie but
it is still of standard DVD filesize. If you have problems playing this on your Divx
standalone player then you may need to split this file into half then it will work just fine. 

Continuing to provide QUALITY which is our priority. Special filters used which takes a lot
of time to encode. For those who wait you know what your getting and we dont disappoint.

This release has been encoded to be 100% compatible to all players.

Colors, brightness and contrast untouched same as source. We do not touch source to preserve
the picture the way it was intended to be shown.

Standard filesize implemented to make this release DVD burn friendly.

This release has been burned and tested to play on a standalone divx player.
