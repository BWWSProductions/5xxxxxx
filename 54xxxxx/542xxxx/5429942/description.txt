This is my first attempt at seting up a torrent.  Please let me know if you can get the file ok.

It is a mini series for Australia's early life for the con's and soldiers.  This is a very good mini series with John English in the lead role.  I will leave this up for about 10 days to see what happens.  If all is well I can post up the rest of the files for the complete series.  Each File is about 680 meg in size and there are 13 in all.  Each file is one episode and runs for about 60 mins each.

These files are from my collection of origonal DVD's, so I have not copied or reposted from anyone elses work.
