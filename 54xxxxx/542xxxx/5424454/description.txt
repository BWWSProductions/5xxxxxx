Former NYC news anchor and Broadway vet, 
Camille Ford, travels coast-to-coast to find 
America's ultimate food showdowns. In each city 
she seeks out that region's most celebrated dishes 
-- the ones that define each town and create culinary 
rivalries -- and pits the nation's most iconic eateries 
in a one-to-one comparison. In blind taste tests, local 
food enthusiasts try to squelch the competition in a food 
face off unlike any other. In Detroit, patrons taste pork 
sausages smothered with all beef chili, sweet onions and 
yellow mustard to determine whether American Coney Dog or 
the Lafayette Coney Dog should be top dog. Other competitions 
include: Kreuz Market vs. Smitty's Market in Lockhart, Texas; 
Duffs vs. Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York; Chicken Annies vs. 
Chicken Mary's in Pittsburg, Kansas; and many more.
