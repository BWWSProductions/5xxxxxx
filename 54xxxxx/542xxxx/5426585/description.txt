Intense, wry, risque, and dependably quirky, the music of Violent Femmes helped define "college rock" in the 1980s. The Wisconsin trio's willfully primitive folk-punk emerged fully formed on the group's 1983 eponymous debut, unleashing such classic acoustic barnstormers such as Add It Up,the dance-floor sing-along favourite "Blister in the Sun",and the murder-suicide song country death song.These tracks are all present here, a band retrospective that follows the Femmes through the good times and beyond, touching down on the Talking Heads-like rendition of T.Rex's "Children of the Revolution" (which features the Heads' Jerry Harrison) and the oddly uplifting, nostalgic "American Music".
Throughout the compilation, frontman Gordon Gano's unmistakably whiny vocals, caustic lyrics, and fierce acoustic-guitar strumming are at the fore, embodying the skewed charm of this utterly unique ensemble.If your not familliar with this band i suggest you check them out.
