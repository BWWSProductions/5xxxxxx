A family of four lives off of scams in which they pretend to be injured by automobiles. After suffering an injury during the war, the father believes he is an invalid. He and his wife have a 10-year-old boy and a 3-year-old girl. The adults pretend to be injured by autos in crowded traffic, blackmailing the fearful motorists with threats to call in the police. When the mother becomes pregnant, the young boy is called on to participate in the schemes. The wife promises her husband she will get an abortion but soon changes her mind without telling him. One motorist welcomes police intervention after an incident, frightening the father that his scam will be exposed. They live in separate hotels until the coast is clear, but the young boy is questioned by police. He maintains his silence as he fears his family will be put in jail in this symbolic drama.
