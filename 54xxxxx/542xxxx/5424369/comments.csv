Side by side or colored?"
,aani2011,2010-03-10T10:18Z,screen shots please
[T],jonnoel1,2010-03-10T10:41Z,"Heres a screenshot.....the 3-d is supposed to be used with red/blue glasses, not the polarized theatre glasses from imax. Low resolution, and quality. This was taken on a 24"" monitor with vlc media player (notice the red and blue lines on both sides of the screenj? (they dont go away for the entire movie.)  I'm just wiping this one. Not worth the download. I have a telesync copy thats much better.

,wolf_ink,2010-03-10T17:53Z,FAKE .... there is no such thing as 3d avatar screener ... this is a home made conversion by ZODRAKN that everybody has raped 
,arthoheen,2010-03-10T19:03Z,I don't get this. What kind of glasses is jonnoel1 talking about?
,kickboy245,2010-03-11T16:46Z,Yea it don't with Polaroid glasses... and I don't have the blue-red 3-D glasses so I don't know if it would work with does.

I have the complete 3D setup with shutter glasses. I will test this using stereoscopic player and post back for others. I have been playing PC video games and a rare selected amount of movies in 3D using these glasses on a Samsung HLT6176S using a custom built HTPC using a Q9550 OCed to 4 ghz with two gts250s in SLI. I look forward to 3D content as the only HD3D stuff I can view is video games. I'm sure I'll have this soon and be posting back.

I would also like to add for others that a 120hz tv is needed for using shutterglasses effectivly providing 60hz per each eye. Shutter glasses is truely the only economical way to provide 3D at home. Polorized glasses requires dual projecters and circular lenes on a silver plated screen (imax uses this method and causes eye blurring). There are also dual panel IZ3D lcd panels but the effect is only at one viewing point. The glasses I use are ""terminator glasses"" and I got them for about 40 bucks a pair. Nothing cool looking but I first used them 10 years ago on a PC. My new HDTV was bought due to being ""3D ready"" and I decided to try it out and built a monster HTPC that will do 120fps on Crysis on HIGH settings at 1080p. WOW is all I can say, I'm very glad I went DLP..

Profet... I would like to say the realD uses shutterglasses.. Harkins theaters use this method and their red realD 3d glasses are about 100 USD a pair, explaining why they keep real close tabs on them. Shutter glasses alow you to seperate two interlaced images on your screen to each different eye useing LCD's that you look through synced up to your tv.. Yes you can make your own 3D movies or images using dual cameras/dual camcorders but you CANNOT use that setup in the theater to capture the 3D unless the shutter glasses were fitted onto the cameras.. If not the image would be the same on both recorded content (blurred as your seeing both images in both eyes).. Truely the only way to get 3D content at this time 04.10 is pc generated graphics allowing dual perspecives to be rendered (requiring masive power for HD) or to be captured and recorded as left and right images and remixed on your local machine synced to your glasses..

OH and FYI as far as price goes I paid 1.5k for TV 2 years ago, and 1.5k for the (pc parts only I built), 120 bucks for 3 glasses... Anlagraph just straight up sucks, gives me a headache quick.. This setup is 100% Harkins quality along with 7.1 audio.. All in all these 7k esimates are far off as to what is needed for a 5 foot 3D tv.. 1k for a tv (now i would assume for a DLP) and a PS3 which is going to have a software upgrade for 3D sometime soon.. I hate playstations over xboxs but for the 3D ill get both.. sorry xbox lovers I'm with ya.. "
