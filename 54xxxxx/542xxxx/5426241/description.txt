This is my first upload, so I hope this all works for you all.

It's the 2001 movie "Enemy At The Gates" direct DVD Rip from the original. So all language sets are in there, all subtitles, menu, special features and of course the movie.

It's a direct DVD Rip, so with the VOB files in a Video_TS folder, so just open it with your standard DVD program and it should run.



When you like the movie, go out and buy it! Support the artist!
