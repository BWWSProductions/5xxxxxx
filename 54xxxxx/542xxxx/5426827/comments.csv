,musicalman08,2010-06-28T07:07Z,"thanks for the torrent! i seeded, but i have a question slightly unrelated. i recently downloaded harry potter and the half blood prince (unsupported) for pc and tried to run it first through crossover 8 then tried this crossover games.  it is still not working. i have tried placing the cracks where i am supposed to but it still comes up with ""please insert original disk"". crossover worked perfectly and it installed and boots up i just cant get the game to start. i have the new macbook pro and my other games (for mac) work great. any suggestions would be great thanks!"
