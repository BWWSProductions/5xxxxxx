,dudemister,2010-03-15T16:16Z,Why have you written 2009 if its 2010? and Does it have the symbolic math toolbox?
,kabalizo,2010-03-16T20:18Z,Many thanks...
,pengwg,2010-03-16T23:16Z,I hope the UNIX version can come out soon!

,ufonothere,2010-03-23T22:57Z,"It seems that Matlab does'nt work. I installed the W32 version with standalone licence file activation. Installation and activation were succesfully done, but matlab doesn't start and return error code ""matlab n'a pas rĂŠussi Ă  s'initialiser correctement (0xC0000005) ..."". Please, could you explain why ?"

,dcoryh192,2010-04-14T09:19Z,"has anyone ever had it freeze installation at 95%? I have windows 7 64-bit. It isn't this copy, as I've had this problem happen with older versions of matlab on different windows installations (all same computer though). I have gotten it to work but I can't remember what I did. Any suggestions? And like I said, I don't think its anything wrong with the torrent"
,neuroxtal,2010-04-20T23:44Z,"Fantastic Man.. Just Fantastic!
Highly Appreciated.

It would take for ever to download it with my crappy internet speed, but it's totally worth it! Can't Wait.

BTW

Any one knows where Can find a Video Training for the Matlab?"
,nanookofthenorth,2010-05-04T07:09Z,"I unpacked then mounted using Magic Iso, but when I tried to run the installation application I got, ""The installer must be run from Disk#1"" and I could go no further.

,1weapon,2010-05-20T02:49Z,"""... when I tried to run the installation application I got, ""The installer must be run from Disk#1"" and I could go no further.""
        I had this problem too.  Found in a forum that if you open the ISO in WinRAR, then open the appropriate setup.exe file (either win32 or win64, depending on your OS), then winRAR will extract everything and run the setup program.  Then just follow the directions in the ""crack"" folder.  After it was installed and asked for a license file, I had to go back into winRAR and extract the appropriate license file before I could browse to find it to complete the MATLAB activation/installation."
,jabrwky,2010-06-03T06:16Z,"Thanks aol, I'll try this one.  Last one installed nicely in one [huge] folder and extras from cmd installed flawlessly.  Very advanced software.  I'll call Michio Kaku's home #."

,BushidoEvil,2010-08-31T07:30Z,"can anyone explain how to active this?
I got trouble when i insert lic_stanalone. and get message ""This's not invalid license"".
Maybe i'm wrong with my license key? Can anyone give license key for activation?
Thx"
,mjthegun,2010-09-04T02:12Z,Where do you actually get the serial key from? Says something about the file is corrupted when i try to open tbe?

Thanks"
,andy5174,2010-10-05T01:13Z,Could you please upload the crack folder separately? Some of us already own the software and don't want to waste 5G for getting merely a few KB or MB crack in this. Cheers! :)
,GubbelGubb,2010-10-15T16:09Z,ThankYou! Works great on Win7 32bit :D
,barry0374,2010-10-15T17:49Z,"Please help, ""install"" in crack opens and displays weird symbols, and the dat files do to when using notepad for both.  Can someone please type serial number? Thanks!

Just to make clearer, I unpacked, mounted, click on no internet etc, but when I get to serial I can't put one in because I can't open the serial thing.  Thanks for help,
 Thomas"
,sarslanali,2010-10-26T06:54Z,"If someone has downloaded this torrent,please upload the crack folder on any site. I have the setup but the license files are empty. Please upload the license. Thank you!"

,piratebay,2010-12-07T14:27Z,"Okay, for guy who couldn't figure it out.

File Installation Key: 55013-56979-18948-50009-49060

Use ""license_standalone.dat"" when asked for license file (for standalone version). It's located in the crack folder.

@BushidoEvil Yes, that's a problem I've faced while installing this iso on other systems. It simply refuses to activate on certain PC's. Any help on that matter would be appreciated! :)"
,regenlk,2010-12-13T19:02Z,Does it work on a win7 64bit?!?

,tmoney024,2011-02-01T01:31Z,I was wondering if anybody has had any trouble unpacking the file.  I have mine in 7z format and can not get it into an iso so I can mount.  Any help would be really appreciated.  Thanks for the upload aoloffline!

,Campbellsville,2011-02-22T05:57Z,going to try dl'ing and installing...tried to get this program for my friend and we could manage to get it to work at all :/ gonna see wat i can manage this time :)
,everywheel,2011-02-22T23:06Z,"I saw some people were having trouble with installation. The most user-friendly way around that is usually daemon tools (lite). It sort of mimics a drive so when you place the matlab file in this 'drive' you can install it.

Having said that, I keep getting the error ''There was an unexpected exception:  Command line returned OS error code '-1' for command [cmd.exe, / C, dir / -c C:]  See the log file (C:\ DOCUME~1\ IBMUSE~1\ LOCALS~1\ Temp\ mathworks_IBM USER.log) for more details.''

 I don't think its to do with daemon tools, has anyone else had this problem? And what can I do about it?"
,albokid89,2011-03-02T05:19Z,what is this program? like what does it do what is its purpose! its no fun d/l 5Gs and then not liking it :(

You should know you can't be using your company provided laptop for running such software...however my guess on ur problem is the security restrictions that comes with such laptop!!"
,darciakib,2011-03-18T17:36Z,words would not express my gratitude enough. I live on Rodrigues island and just buying this would cost 8 months of my salary. Thanks a lot
,xzhobo,2011-03-28T12:55Z,"Thanks for this, works like a charm.
+1"
,spacegiguiri,2011-04-13T19:33Z,"Just installed, works like a charm 100%. For those of you who have not been able to get it running, I write a detailed guide that might help you. First of all, when you download this torrent, you will get a folder with two files and one we are interested in is an image file of the matlab installation disk. So you need to have installed in your computer a program that is able to manage iso files so you can burn or mount the file. I use ultraIso but others use deamon tools and there are many others.

1. Burn matl20xa.iso to a cd to create an installation disk or mount the file to a virtual cd drive.

2. If you burned the image, insert the cd into your disk drive. If you mounted the image, you should already have a virtual cd drive simulating that you have inserted a disk even though you haven't.

3. If the disk has not already started running, right click on the cd-drive containing the installation disk and click on auto run

4. Select install without using the internet and click next.

5. When asked for the serial number, select I have purchased a serial number. Go to the cd-drive again, right click on it and this time select explore. An explorer window will pop up and you have to open the crack folder. Inside the crack folder open the install.txt file. Read and copy the serial key under stand alone and paste it on the matlab installation window. Click next and let the installation begin. It can take up to an hour for the program to finish installing.

6. When installation has completed, make sure the checkbox for activate Matlab is checked and click next. Click on ""Activate manually without using the internet"" and click next. Click on ""Provide the path for the licence file"" and click on browse. When the browse window pops up, click on my computer, then on the disk drive containing the cd or image file, then click on the crack folder and finally select ""lic_standalone"" and click next and then finish.

7) That's it folks. Enjoy this great upload!!!"

,phadke123,2011-06-19T04:50Z,"My crack folder seems incomplete. The install.txt does not have the serial number. But I got that from the comments. However, when I try to activate the software, it does not accept the lic_standalone.dat file. It gives the error 'The license file appears to be invalid'.

,tanyajs,2011-06-21T15:32Z,"Pease help!  I understand how to do the install, the problem is the crack folder. Both the install.txt and the two license (.dat) files are corrupted / encoded / encrypted.  They are not text files (they should be).  The actual install files are working. I have noticed that other people had the same problem, but I don't know how they solved it.  I have exactly the same problem trying to install 2009b, 2010b and 2011a.  What am I (and other people) doing wrong?  Why some people see text files while others get binary garbage?  Is it some kind of character encoding or something completely stupid that I am missing?  "
