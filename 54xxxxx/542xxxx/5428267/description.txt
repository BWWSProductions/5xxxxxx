        Plot .......: In the 15th century Richard Duke of Gloucester,     
             aided by his club-footed executioner Mord, eliminates        
             those ahead of him in succession to the throne, then         
             occupied by his brother King Edward IV of England. As        
             each murder is accomplished he takes particular delight      
             in removing small figurines, each resembling one of the      
             successors, from a throne-room dollhouse, until he alone     
             remains. After the death of Edward he becomes Richard        
             III, King of England, and need only defeat the exiled        
             Henry Tudor to retain power.
