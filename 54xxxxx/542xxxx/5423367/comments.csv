LOTR: The Two Towers and LOTR: Return Of The King would be great, too."
,nejkedh,2010-06-06T20:11Z,"Well, Languages: English & Russian. I would have thought that meant both of them and not only the speech in English. And if there is a choice between English and Russian i cant find it because everything is in Russian..."
,el-bainy,2010-06-17T04:44Z,"The game is in NTSC?

Thank you from Brazil!"

,esrevni,2010-12-07T05:42Z,"For those who don't believe in trial and error, this IS indeed both English and Russian. Simply chose the bottom option that first comes up when you boot the game to play in English."
