[QUOTE]The hero of Alfonso CuarÃ³nâ€™s â€œSÃ³lo Con Tu Parejaâ€ is TomÃ¡s TomÃ¡s (Daniel GimÃ©nez Cacho), a young man living alone in a roomy Mexico City apartment with a tedious job writing advertising copy and a hyperactive romantic life. Apparently and perhaps not quite plausibly irresistible to women, he is also unable to resist them, which is believable enough, since the women in this movie favor garter belts, half-slips and other kinds of retro-sexy lingerie, which they seem happy to display, or to remove, in TomÃ¡sâ€™s presence.

Mr. CuarÃ³n made this film, his first feature, 15 years ago, before departing Mexico for Hollywood and making â€œA Little Princessâ€ and â€œGreat Expectations,â€ returning home for â€œY Tu MamÃ¡ TambiÃ©nâ€ and then coming back to direct â€œHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.â€

This zigzagging has made him an intriguing and in some ways exemplary figure in contemporary world cinema, and the movies themselves show remarkable exuberance and versatility. All of which partly justifies the belated release (simultaneously in theaters and on DVD) of â€œSÃ³lo Con Tu Pareja,â€ a lively calling card from a young, ambitious director working with limited funds and a screenplay he wrote with his brother Carlos.

Like â€œY Tu MamÃ¡ TambiÃ©n,â€ â€œSÃ³lo Con Tu Parejaâ€ â€” literally, â€œOnly With Your Partnerâ€ â€” is a rambunctious sex comedy shadowed by mortality. TomÃ¡s is hardly a smooth-talking lady-killer; rather, he uses a combination of boyish sweetness and neurotic, puppylike eagerness as his main tools of seduction. He is a little too successful, enticing a nurse (Dobrina Liubomirova) into his bed while his randy boss, Gloria (Isabel Benet), is waiting for him across the hall. TomÃ¡s has lured her into the apartment he has borrowed from a friend, Mateo (Luis de Icaza).

As TomÃ¡s races back and forth along the window ledge, the movie has the breezy insouciance of a classic bedroom farce. But the lighthearted mood is disrupted by the possibility of true love â€” incarnated in a new neighbor (Claudia RamÃ­rez), who lives between TomÃ¡s and Mateo and who has a fiancÃ© â€” and also by the specter of death.

The nurse, feeling spurned and neglected, plays a cruel prank on TomÃ¡s, altering blood test results to suggest that he is H.I.V.-positive. This leads to some anguished soul-searching and also, rather improbably, to a madcap chase that ends on the observation deck of the Latin American Tower, Mexico Cityâ€™s answer to the Empire State Building.

Mr. CuarÃ³n never quite finds the tone that would allow him to fuse belly laughs with the horror of illness and death, but then perhaps Pedro AlmodÃ³var is the only filmmaker able to mix darkness and light in that way. Still it is hard not to admire the younger manâ€™s cheeky self-confidence, and hard not to enjoy the dexterity of his camera movements and the flair with which he attempts both low comedy and high melodrama.

The promise he showed in â€œSÃ³lo Con Tu Parejaâ€ has already been realized and exceeded, but there is something gratifying about witnessing such talent in its fledgling state. [/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]Though SÃ³lo Con Tu Pareja would achieve considerable acclaim on the international circuit and help launch Alfono CuarÃ³n's Hollywood career, it's taken the filmmaker's feature-length debut more than a decade to travel north of the border. Banned for many years in Mexico, the film filters the sexual agency and paranoia of its characters through a telenovela scrim, bringing to mind the baroque effervescence of Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Delicatessen, only with a more vital social framework. The film's English title, Love in the Time of Hysteriaa tribute to Gabriel GarcÃ­a Marquez's magical realist masterpiece Love in the Time of Choleraemphasizes CuarÃ³n's desire to study how sexual behavior is shaped by the times, in this case the rising AIDS crisis. This bawdy comedy's tour-de-force is a prolonged sequence during which a very busy lothario, TomÃ¡s TomÃ¡s (Daniel GimÃ©nez Cacho), scales the exterior of his apartment in order to bed two different women, singing a nursery rhyme to keep his balance only to be distracted by the beautiful flight attendant who's just moved into the residence nestled between his bachelor pad and his doctor-friend's apartment. When one of the women, Silvia (Dobrina Liubomirova), learns that she's been played for a fool, she fudges the man's medical results to indicate that he's HIV-positive, which leads the man down a staccato road toward suicide. The film is like a champagne bottle's ricocheting corkan explosion of poppy camera maneuvers, literary allusions, chatty reiterations, raunchy sex, and spastic flights of fantasy rich in cultural flavor (one of the man's nightmares accommodates a Lucha Libre fighter and a bullfighting castrati). CuarÃ³n sustains the fizziness throughout, evoking one of those randy Euro-trash commercials that are too hot for American television. A little one-note perhaps, but consistently funny and sexy.
