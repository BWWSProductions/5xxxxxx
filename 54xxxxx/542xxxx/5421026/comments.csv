,dallanlee,2010-12-10T01:13Z,"Why would this have -1? I gave it +1 :) This file works fine as m4v or mp4. The visual quality is good, 9.5/10 for being a DVD rip. Thank you koneil3! (Plays fine in iTunes (tested as m4v) Changed to mp4 and plays great in Media Player Classic (with CCCP installed) on Windows 7 Ult. Also works on the WDTV Live+ as mp4.)"
