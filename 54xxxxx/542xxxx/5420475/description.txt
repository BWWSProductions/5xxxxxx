From RuthMendelson.com, Notes From the Composer:

I was originally commissioned by the New England Aquarium to compose this soundtrack for their "AMAZING JELLIES" exhibit.
 
Since then, several people who frequented the exhibit- from teachers to massage therapists to individuals who were simply visiting from out of town - have all been requesting this CD.

Before I started to write the music, I sat for hours by the fish tanks at the New England Aquarium- studying the slow, languid movements of the jellies, and the way they would shimmer in the light.  The smallest of them looked like tiny luminous umbrellas, the largest of them looked like transparent overstuffed pillows with long tentacles dangling underneath.  Regardless, ALL jellies look like stars when they are first born, and they all move very VERY slowly in the water.  

If you use your imagination, you can feel how slowly the jellies swim through the water- simply by listening to and feeling the slow pulse of the music.  

The music is written in 4 movements (sections)- each one describing a different mood or â€œcolor.â€ Each movement depicts a different aspect of the mystery and beauty of the ocean, and the jellies who live there.  

Here are the names of the different movements:

Jellies Singing Hello, Welcoming You to Their World
Jellies Being Born
Jellies- Royalty of the Sea
Jellies- Swimming in Light

 
I've also included a very special track Cochiti (named after the Sacred Cochiti Pueblo in New Mexico), featuring Medicine Drums and string orchestra.

A note regarding Cochiti:

A few years ago I took a solo camping trip to New Mexico.  While I was there, I met a beautiful Tewa (thatâ€™s the name of a Native American Tribe) family who live on the Cochiti Pueblo.  They are truly some of the kindest people Iâ€™ve ever met.  The Grandfather of the family is a Medicine Drum maker.  Native Drums are very Sacred.  They literally sing the heartbeat of the very earth we live on.

After returning home from my camping trip, I received a special Medicine Drum in the mail that the Grandfather had made for me.  A week after it arrived, I had an AMAZING dream filled with music and dance.  In it, I heard LOTS of Drums playing with an orchestra while elders of all walks of life danced together in a Circle.  Really, really cool.  I wrote the music down when I woke up the following morning.  Soon after that, the Boston Symphony played it!  Now, you can hear the dream too!

The music begins with a brass chorale (trumpets, trombones, tubas and french horns all playing together). Keep listening! The Drums come in after the first minute. 

Lots of kids love to draw pictures and make up stories while listening to Cochiti.  Have fun!
