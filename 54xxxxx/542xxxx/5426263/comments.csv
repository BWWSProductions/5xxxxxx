,OrpheusDude,2011-03-04T16:29Z,"I am sick to death of 2 LIONS TEAM's inability to convey - IN ENGLISH (which seems to be the most prevalent language on TPB) - what they have and have not included on a DVD rip.

So the ""Categorie"" is ""beeld"" - what the fuck is that?

Despite the usually dependable audio and visual quality of 2 LION TEAM's rips, I will ALWAYS seek out another source which tells me what has been deleted from the DVD and just what the hell it is I can expect.  I want menus, I want the extras (even if it means spending â‚¬1.49 for a two-layer blank DVD), and I thank those contributors to TPB who provide them and explain content in one of the six languages I understand."

Other than that, 2Lions usually have great uploads, so thanxxx in advance for this one."
