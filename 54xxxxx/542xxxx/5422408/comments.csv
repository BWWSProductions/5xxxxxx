,iMtheAK,2010-03-09T12:48Z,"inewphone thanx for viewing my torrent

now according to ur configurations this will work perfectly 

AHCI not at all required for  just leave it as in SATA 

now what you have to do is :- 
1st boot into dvd 
2nd follow the instructions 
3rd goto disk utility 
format ur drive to Mac os extended journaled
4th choose that drive 
click next and go to customize 
choose 
snow leopard 10.6.2 or 1 whtevr u want to install
go to boot loader option 
and choose chameleon RC4
then choose Bootx86
then go to graphics driver 
choose nvidia_graphic
then go to audio driver
choose which ever audio driver u hav bocz u hvnt given me ur motherboard detail
then go to network driver and choose intel 82566
then the most important go to cmos_reset_fix choose elliottforce
then go to patchs
and choose smbios resolver and also choose about the mac fix


so thats it ... wht u need to do.... just install it ... and if after installation it says FAILED then don't worry its also a good sign ......
in that failed install box  dnot click on restart just go to options and click startup disk and choose the disk (dvd) in it it will ask u to restart after choosing just click it and enjoy"

You know that such plagiarism?
And so I wish to tell to you, not well to appropriate the authorship to that, 
To what you have no what relation.
This release was made Hazard, instead of by you.
And you the full idiot, have solved that all fools?

Your distribution a deceit, as well as you, also it is necessary to block your account
FAKE

,urlich,2010-04-15T12:18Z,Are you sure? The size of the Snow Leopard by Hazard was 3.66 GiB .. The size of a Snow Leopardby iMtheAK is 4:38 GiB..

,bogas04,2010-05-21T03:02Z,"Im entirely new to installing OSX on PC
So can anyone help me out?

Can i just download it , burn it , and pop it in and boot with it and BAM, i have Mac? Or the procedure is more complex than what it seems?

Please e-mail me if you want to help me and have another PC user MAC fan in this world :)

,Gyrth,2010-05-23T22:20Z,I can't get it to work. Installation was working fine but at the end I got an error. Failed installation. I know you said that it was normal and I continued to do what you said. I went to the startup disk and selected the dvd and clicked on restart. Now should I eject the dvd or not? Because I left in in and it just started to boot and begin installation again. Now how do I get it to boot the mac installation? Thanks!
