Multi instrumentist, meticulous and supercreative composer, Willbe (William Lamy) from France, comes from the demo/tracking scene of the late 90â€™s. Heâ€™s known for producing abstract hip-hop, breakbeat and downtempo music that combines acoustic (sampled) as much as electronic (synthetic) sounds.

Willbe has composed music themes for Demoscene.tv, Scene.org awards, and many demos. Heâ€™s also the maker of the Demovibes mixed compilations that gather the finest demoscene music soundtracks.

Out from the demoscene, Willbe has released â€œBlues is something to meâ€ at Neferiu records, â€œMonsieur Bâ€ at Backseat records (as a 7â€ limited vinyl edition), and remixes for Laurent Garnier (F-Com) and Lootpack (GrooveAttack).
