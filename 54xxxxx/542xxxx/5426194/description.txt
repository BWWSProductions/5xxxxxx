Set in a Bombay ghetto in the mid 80s and based on true-life accounts, Striker is a story of triumph of human spirit over indomitable odds.
Born into a poor family, Surya grows up with few luxuries. Poor health keeps him away from school and that is when his elder brother introduces him to carrom. Quite similar to pool carrom is common among people from the middle and lower income groups in India. Precision and skill are vital to playing the game well; attitude and confidence are crucial to winning. The underground carrom scene has been breeding hustlers and gamblers for years.
