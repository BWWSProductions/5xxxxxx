However the avi file is 2.17GB = MULTIPART (use gSpot to test) = Problems for most standalones.

Bigger than 2GB so to be compatibile with most STANDALONE DivX players - will need to be split with VirtualDubMod ( http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/virtualdubmod/VirtualDubMod_1_5_10_2_All_inclusive.zip )
1. Open movie file:
""File"", ""Open video file"" (or use Ctrl+O shortcut), then browse to dir with YOUR_MOVIE.avi (press NO if asked about MP3)
2. ""File"", Save as (or simply press F7)
Choose ""Segment output file"" and set to 2036MB (no more)
(If you want CD sized parts you can use 700MB value)
Put new name and/or directory !BEFORE clicking SAVE: CHANGE(Video)""Video mode"" to ""Direct stream copy""
Done in 1-2 minutes!

---
On PC it plays without problems."
