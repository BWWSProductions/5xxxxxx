,crunchyfrog555,2010-03-24T15:43Z,"Scary stuff.

As a UK resident, I can only really comment on what's relevant to us, but of course it may well still apply to others.

Regarding the ""customs search of laptops/iPods/etc"" - I can't ever see that one being enforceable - even should it go through. If I choose to rip films for use on my laptop when travelling abroad, or likewise maybe some games, imagine the fun that customs officers would have.

Say they had reason to pull me to one side and investigate further. While it's true they could feasibly have a good trawl through any data at their own speed, how on earth could they ever work out whether or I not I have the legal right to own any such data? That's laughable.

Trying to look for purchase records could be one thing (iTunes purchases, for example). But, as under UK law, as long as you own the original, there's no problem, there's just no way they'd be able to tell whether a film on my laptop is there legitimately, or otherwise. Ridiculous, not to say an utter waster of resources.

The main cause for concern, to my mind, is the ISP access without a formal warrant. That is just plain WRONG!

Picture this scenario: A person who's a customer of an ISP downloads tons of films, games, etc. He gets monitored by certain IP holders (say, TimeWarner, for this example). They go to the ISP with a claim to release the offender's details. This would be the likely event under the new proposals.

Now, as TimeWarner own AOL, what a great way of finding out rival ISP's customer details!

More sinister still would be a similar situation to the which happens here at the Pirate Bay: getting sent tons of legalese every day asking to ""cease and desist"" etc. Now should TimeWarner (using them as an example again) start a deluge of legalese against a smaller, rival ISP, it could well bankrupt the company under sheer cost of litigation (that never happens, right?). Hey presto, a better-performing, smaller rival ISP out of the way.

A couple of very good reasons why you must NEVER let business have the say in running ANYTHING.

But, it's election time soon enough in the UK, time to let out lovely politicians know how strongly we feel about this topic."

,crunchyfrog555,2010-03-24T16:13Z,"Thanks, Vonyx - I was being a little simplistic in those examples, but you get the picture :)

As for hiding your IP address, yes, it's possible, but also technically illegal (but what the fuck isn't?) Having proxy serves also helps, but it's not ideal.

But, in the long run, I don't think we're screwed at all. How long has it taken those fat-cat prats to try and shut the door on these activities.

I remember much the same sort of chagrin (albeit smaller) about cassette taping killing music. The whole point is, when one door shuts, another opens.

And when you've got guys as sharp as these as The Pirate Bay working on your side, you can rest assured they'll have a way round it in short order.

Nice one Crunchyfrog555, what a way to put it mate. I would like to know though, is it possible for one to hide their IP address? 

The answer is simply no. You can spoof your IP to third parties but in the end, as a home user, your IP is Given to you by the ISP's DHCP server and under the terms of license they have to keep a record of what IP is given to what customer for a period of 24months. The likelyhood of you being to hide from anyone detirmined enough trace you is very low especially with the improved powers of 3rd parties to obtain your details from ISP's without a warrant.
I think direct Encrypted Secure VPN connections are probably the best way to go to a country that won't give a munkeez about this legislation and then grab you gear down that pipe. No packet sniffer technology will beat that."
,psichoate,2010-03-24T16:17Z,"you can hide your ip a couple different ways, it is probably going to make your downloads slower as you can use a proxy service that makes multiple hops;

So, those silly comments about cancelling your internet - apart from being totally impractical and unworkable - are rather silly to say the least.

But, I've got to agree with the sentiment in carrying on what we're doing. One way to stop any sort of justice short is to make it unworkable. I, for one, will continue to download what I want regardless. If they prosecute me, bugger it, I can't work anyway, so it can't exactly hurt me.

Also, further to my last comments, if those stupid record companies think that by removing my source of downloads, I'd come crawling back to them to buy CDs (or whatever) at ridiculous prices, well, I guess they're just too far gone...

But, to iterate, if you want to protest this, make sure you shout at your electoral candidate for the coming election. And shout loudly, and often.

You have a network IP and your adress IP.

Sure, you can make a phonecall and they'll change it but the only way to really do it the way you suggest is to use a proxy, swarms or ""bouncing your connection"" (Like in the movies) But any governmental organisation can easily track you even after that if they know what to look for because you allways leave a trace.

So no, changing your IP in cmd won't make even the slightest of differance because you are only doing it where you live. The adress IP that they trace is still the same unless changed by your internet provider..."

Similarly, it provides for criminalization of copyright infringement, granting law enforcement the powers to perform criminal investigation, arrests and pursue criminal citations or prosecution of suspects who may have infringed on copyright. It also allows criminal investigations and invasive searches to be performed against individuals for whom there is no probable cause, and in that regard weakens the presumption of innocence and allows what would in the past have been considered unlawful searches.""  I'd like to see them try it. Luckily enough, I live in a state in the US that has a ""stand your ground law"", and I'm also a proud carrier of a concealed weapon permit and quite a few weapons to go along with it. If ANY law enforcement comes onto my property without a warrant or supposedly having 1 that isn't signed by a judge, I will request very nicely that they leave once and ONLY once.  If they don't, then trespassers will be shot and survivors will be shot again.

IMO it is plausible. ISP's are required to monitor the ""open"" internet traffic. However VPN (virtual Private Network) is still protected by corporate law, to protect against business spying etc.
A VPN can be looked at as a LAN, so files can be shared like your on the same internal network and traffic is encrypted.
And because most of us are not as geeky as they should be, there are a lot of programs that create the VPN connection for you automaticly and makes it as easy as setting up your email.
So the solution might be to create the largest VPN ever seen, until that gets banned ofc.
Acces could be provided on invitation, as is now the case with some torrent sites/buletin boards.
Biggest problem would be: wo would manage it, and how would we set up the sharing so it would become fair to all. ie: leechers etc."

,Peanutt010,2010-03-24T22:01Z,"@rokridge

No it will not.. Both your machines use the same external IP adress. You use 2 kinds of IP adresses 1 to idicate your computer inside your home. IE: 192.0.0.1, .2, .3, etc and a single number to indicate your internet connection. IE: 62.34.54.01
So both your computers will use the same adress 62.34.54.01 even though your LAN connection gives them different internal numbers."
,azvareth,2010-03-24T22:03Z,"@Peanutt010

I am not sure here, but is not som trackersystems serverless? theoretically (if that is correct) Then a VPN could be more or less serverless, or am I drinking too much beer.

The problem is (as you say): Who should be able to join? and who will manage that."
,calvorin,2010-03-24T22:05Z,"@Peanutt010

He said one would be offline.  An offline computer has no IP address... it's offline.  However, a search warrant would allow a search of any system in the residence, therefore making this not work.  In the US it wouldn't, anyway.  Not familiar with laws elsewhere."

im looking into it now, see if i can do it. but someone who knows what to do would be appreciated.
but the problem is how do you know who to trust in the VPN. i  imagine anyone inside it could fuck  it up, either deliberately, or just by getting a virus on their comp.

Such an idea should be using some kind of: hmm don't know the word... let me explain

Comp1 have File as parts Block1, Block2, ...
Comp2 have File as parts Block1, Block2, ...
...
As long as several sources exists for this file neither Comp1 or Comp2 should be able to distribute the whole file

CompA want this file, and asks for it
somehow CompA by a public hash somwhere or by XOR (DeEncrypt routine) of the blocks received, make it a working file from CompA and CompB

This should also be a distrubuted system so a request for FileBlock5 from Comp2 very well may be fetched from Comp10

Slavery remains by illusion. Illusion of free choice, and the Illusion of competition/concurrence.

People think they have a lot of available differente choices, if they dont like 'this', they can always chose 'that'. Thats a wrong idea, its all controled by a few companies, wich are controlled by the bilderbergs.

KEEP FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM!"

A lot of people can most defintaly get away with that and going a torrent at a time would also help. I'm honestly not worried as I'm gonna vote against it but that's really all we have to do is vote against it. I don't believe that law should have random access to my files and if I read correctly it states they don't have to provide any compensation at all for anything they do. Fuck that shit. Also, purchasing a few extra HDDS just for back up use and then storing them would probably keep your files safe. THrowing a tad bit of cash into your machine wor buying a portable laptop HDD and storing that somewhere would probably be the best bet of making sure you have all your files backed up. Screw this ACTA agreement but keep yourself safe. Also, pretty cool freeware that block serious IPs called Peer Guardian I can most definatly say it WORKS. A combo of limiting your speeds, setting a smaller que line and blocking/protecting your IP is all you really have to do. uTorrent also has encrypt mode as well. THis was most definatly an enevitable agreement but do what you can and be a little more patient and you should be OK."

What we are seeing here is another example of our freedom being taken away by someone with a lot of money and a lot of power and plenty of high-ranking companies and people stashed within their pockets.

New World Order? Illuminati? Conspiracy? I don't think so, but a crime against the purpose that this country was formed and that purpose is freedom.

""America isn't easy. America is advanced citizenship. You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's gonna put up a fight. It's gonna say 'You want free speech? Let's see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who's standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours. You want to claim this land as the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country can't just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then, you can stand up and sing about the 'land of the free'"" - from The American President

I still stand agree with those words and to see our freedom being taken away and torn apart piece by piece only pisses me off.

Perhaps some day, we will wage war amongst our fellow country-men and those of us who are fighting for freedom will hopefully win this war.

I know what i'm doing is wrong. People are going about saying that it should be free. WHY? They put money into creating this medium of entertainment and you take it. You are entertained at practically no expense of your own. To me, it's considered stealing. And i recognise it. Don't be naive to say that all this shit is rightfully yours. It never is, it never was. It is only yours when you have paid for it. You might be thinking. Hey they make millions of dollars. What difference if one person does it. But it's that mentally spread out across millions. COD MW2 was downloaded illegally in the magnitudes of millions. Millions of you were entertained when you had no right to be. All i'm saying is, don't be so fucking stupid to believe that this is right. Or this is your perogative. It's not. And i'm grateful for whatever i can get from TPB but also become ashamed.

YES, the governement with this type of power is allarming. It's frightening. BUT DON'T DELVE INTO THIS CONSPIRACY BULLCRAP. To be completely honest i understand this decision. Because it's half understandable. Piracy DOES need to be dealt with. Because i can see the injustice in it. And the onyl way we can possibly control this? YES, i disagree with these actions. I thinks it's a huge violation to my space and rights as a human being. The point of not being controlled, monitored and scrutinised. YES, in an exagerated formed it does remind you of Big Brother and of the censoring in CHina. But THINK CRITICALLY before you indulge yourself in some half proven and idiotic theory.. This shit has been a long time comming and we deal with it in a reasonable, logical and backed up manner. Not sway people with this illusion.

I'm not sure about you, but big businesses provide alot of people with their income. Major businesses go bankrupt? Where do the employees go? I'm not sure about you, but the econmy is what sustains our lives. Stop saying, stop buying shit, stop going to X store or Y brand because that's just utterly ineffective. You steal their shit, then never buy anything from them. That's how huge corporations, that you MAY be working for partime, casually or fulltime die and you're out of the business.

You are getting something for free, that you are not meant to. If you disregard that, you disregard all laws. Therefore, why don't you kill someone?

""Dude they are doing this to protect their interest and to get more richer. as simple as that.""
And what are you doing? Getting shit for free. If they weren't there, you wouldn't get anything. You know that. That's pure logic.

""dude, if you can make a car like porche you wont be here talking shit. i say do what u can. not dream what you cant. if you wanna copy a porche design do it and ride it in ur village. porche wont be bothered. trust me on that""
HAHAHA you don't fucking get an analogy. I said it in relation to your previous point. If i can make porches? I'd sell them. What would you do? You'd steal them. I put all this effort in and you'd steal them. 

""Dont you think we are copying a wheel desing for free?""
No-one can claim IP on the fucking wheel though. MY GOD CAN'T YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE?

""so why not copy some digital content.""
Because it's IP.

""THAN WHY IS UBISOFT IMPLEMENTING PRIACY..""

There really is no point in implementing any anti-piracy measures in games, a serial is all they really need. Copy protection will always be cracked so all they are doing is inconveniencing their customers. 
In newer games like starcraft 2 and BadCompany 2, they have completely dropped LAN and BOT support, so that you must play online, this is complete shit!! to all game players, hard core or not. But again, this is where the so called ""hackers"" come in, mods will be made which will support LAN n BOT, and you know why? Because there is a HIGH DEMAND for it. 
Therefore you probably better of getting a ""pirated"" copy of the game, and this is why their buisness model fails. If it?s easier for people to use a ""pirated"" copy, then why the hell would you buy the original which forces you to go thru all that copy protection crap even though you own a legit CD?! 

NO-CD/OFFLINE Play patches/LAN-BOT Mods/stripping game code of auto-authentication checks = WIN! 

@Wholemeal
Look mate, according to their dinosaur copy right law, we are breaking the law. But who makes these laws? Who tells you what is illegal or not? The corporate fat cats who's soul interest is to protect their own, not the artists rights! 
Don?t you see, the LAW is what ever they want it to be, and then you as the law abiding citizen must accept it and abide by it or be out casted as a criminal. Sure you may ""appeal"" for it to be changed, but you try going against a multi-billion dollar business who have virtually unlimited resources and who no doubt play a big role in government and politics by backing and funding politicians, running new bills through them to become law.. 

Oil companies are still running down their oil, do you have any idea how much plans they have bought out of promising cars that run on alternative fuel? Heard of Vacuum energy?   

But meh, no one cares.. Or better put, not enough people care.. Seems ignorance is bliss, and if they want to keep living in their own little worlds where they work all day, take kids to school, sleep.. Rinse & Repeat for their rest of their lives, then so be it. 

This may seem like it has nothing to do with copyright laws, but trust me it most certainly does. There is a war on for our freedoms, and it is being silently fought on different fronts, the internet is one of the Major ones, the only one that lets people voice their mind and ideologies without any censorship, a source of free flowing information accessible to anyone regardless if they are rich or poor, back or white, a place where everyone can voice their concern on any matter they wish.. This is only made possible because no one person controls it. 

Now add, new improved copyright laws which favor the fat cats, Filtering/censored down to the ISP level, centralized internet, and you got shit. Game over, sheep lose. Wolf wins.  "

let me take a different approach and give you a different example, that why this world needs piracy.

1 laptop lets say which costs 1000$ in us /europe
and here average salary lets say 3000$ a month. now hypothetically lets say u dont need anything else and u can buy 3 laptops in a month. now come to a 3rd world country like india. in india the cost will be 50,000Rs direct conversion of 1k$ + transport cost. now in india average salary is lets say 20,000Rs (that is also if you are lucky enuf) and here a guy has to wait 2.5 months to get 1 laptop, to get 3 he has to wait 7.5 months so 1 months in us/europe = 7.5 months. now top of this if you want to sell your software to these people, what do you think they gonna tell you? think about that.
now may be you will tell... let them die man.. who cares as long as our business getting enuf money from this people. or may be you will say... then why they are buying computers. they dont need it for living. and they will say to you and your friends fuck you and fuck off.

we brought piracy and you have to accept it with other good things. there is a cause behind piracy, think about that first. then talk your shits. 

You and your friends wants to do business and make money. thats the end goal. if you say business is dropping i dont buy that. if you look at the numbers its increasing every year. yeah you can say you and your friends could have made more money than that. then yea i agree :)

""No-one can claim IP on the fucking wheel though. MY GOD CAN'T YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE?"" you proved me you dont have a brain. dont you think i know that no one cant claim IP and shit. IP is made by the same people who trying to stop piracy.

Because my life might be short, but Ive paid my toll of buying copyrighted bullshit, and been fucked by my fair share of corporations. So in response to the ACTA, ""Ill donate everything I own before I give you, your government, or anyone else who tries to force me to buy something I got free, a fucking penny."" 

-And I Forever Will Swear By It

If something is really worth it, then people will buy it. Dont take it out on someone because you didnt get their money. Because I've never robbed know one for something they deserved."

Quote from wiki -
The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has published ""Speak out against ACTA"", stating that the ACTA threatens free software by creating a culture ""in which the freedom that is required to produce free software is seen as dangerous and threatening rather than creative, innovative, and exciting.""[49] Specifically the FSF argues that ACTA will make it more difficult and expensive to distribute free software via file sharing and P2P technologies like BitTorrent, which are currently used to distribute large amounts of free software. The FSF also argues that ACTA will make it harder for users of free operating systems to play non-free media because DRM protected media would not be legally playable with free software.

For all of you living in the EU, and I presume this goes for us over in the UK also (but dont hold me against it) there is no need to worry:

http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/networking/2010/02/26/europe-will-not-accept-three-strikes-in-acta-treaty-40057434/

Read that articale and it becomes clear, here is an extract from it;

""""The EU Commission maintains that any criminal action should be for infringements on a large, commercial scale only,"" Clancy said on Thursday. 

""[Acta] has never been about pursuing infringements by an individual who has a couple of pirated songs on their music player. For several years, the debate has been about what is 'commercial scale'. EU legislation has left it to each country to define what a commercial scale is and this flexibility should be kept in Acta.""

,Cgoff87,2010-03-25T19:56Z,"@Dan2802 As I can see you lack the common sense needed to comprehend the relation that I made between poverty and piracy. To better help you understand the relation
heres the facts:

Poverty is a disease that is growing quickly as more and more corporations are swindling money out of society and distributing it amongst themselves and select charities that do whatever they want with the money. 

In Africa,
Every day, almost 16000 children die from hunger-related causes.

Since the epidemic began, 25 million people have died from AIDS.

Wars have destroyed the region, and corrupt systems of politics have not made it better...

On the other hand,

Millions of dollars every year are wasted in this process of conviction that only happens to a select group of people. Out of these few people, they are charged fines that can exceed $100,000 Dollars, yet these companies spend more and more money trying to make an point effortless point just to try to scare people into staying off these sites.


-Point Blank

The relation I made was referring that BEFORE I GIVE A CENT TO THESE GREEDY CORPORATIONS WHO TAKE MONEY, I WILL GIVE EVERYTHING I OWN TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST.

I dont care what anyone says, because personally, I care about bigger issues, and Piracy just isnt one of them. Because as long as we have Mike over there sleeping under the Highway 90 bridge or my friend Ralph who currently resides at the SAM Shelter, or even the kid who cant pay for his Mavis Beacon 20 typing lesson to have at home because his dad just got fired from the Toyota plant, I will gladly help these people at my cost, rather than support convicting and charging these families for basically Typing and Clicking.

My point is that money could be used for better things, and I dont see these software developers and corporations doing anything but layoffs and get rich.

Now who doesn't believe this Money could be used for greater efforts??

Is Piracy really The Biggest problem in the world right now?

It was made when there were rummors that TPB will be shut down.The file was approx. 21 GB but there also was included an instructions how to make a temporal backup of TPB site and make it run + proper software (!)

I have been writing hacks, patches, and mods for games and software for close to 5 years now.  I do it because it is fun.  I do it because people appreciate what I have made.  I have been offered money for some of my hacks and I declined.  I don't care about monetary gain, I only care about helping the people who can't afford the software or want to change aspects of their favorite games.  

If people really want a piece of software, let them have it.  Whether or not they paid for it or not should never matter.  

I pirate regularly, and if I can't find a song on a torrent site or a P2P network, I buy it and share it because there will always be someone else who want's that song.

I'm not trying to scare brothers and sisters, but it is the beginning of the war for freedom and the very essence of our existence as a society, as a nation! as individuals and not a herd!. 

Corporations... they pray on slaves.. yes slaves. every one who forced to buy software, games, music (not books!!!) are SLAVES to them. But we are free! We are free, healthy people, for many of us there are no limits on the Internet borders [~gentle smile~], there are no closed doors no restrictions, we are free like the wild wind on flat plain!

We ... pirates and hackers alike are a threat to them! And they are trying to destroy what they fear.     Now they have taken the first step towards war .. Fear is their weapon, their first move. In the future, may appear similar organization like Interpol. But they will hunt us instead. Like dogs, like  abominations! like criminals, like last free people on Earth!. 

Jesus said: when they hit on the right cheek, turn around , at the same time throwing forward your tightly clenched fist and beat, beat, beat the enemy! Until he does not back down and not run away and do not dare to raise his dirty hand against you!

But from today, I freeing myself from my vow, and I will fight to the last KB. I will fight with all means necessary! 

I love pirates! love what you are doing. you stand under the first blow.

,YurkaMaku,2010-03-26T02:33Z,"Im with Shameso on this, but only because i like the idea of the fightclub eventually turning into Project Mayhem over time. Regardless on to the subject. This law will probably be about as hard to maintain as the MP3 Illegality laws are, people will always find ways to continue the spirit of Piracy for the rest of time, its human nature to find ways to take what you want without actually paying for it. Its been done for years and has never been stopped, even if the world declines into oppression and Famine, Piracy is the Core of society, and the fact the law states can arrest on possibility, corruption will come into play almost instantly, and people would be arrested for no reason, without even being guilty, and setup for the whole thing while it happens. And i doubt the law will actually make it far anyways, considering my favorite ""The Grand Line"" (TPB) of the web, has a following big enough to even stop something like this from happening. All it takes is one placement on one location, i.e. 4chan, to cause a massive international movement that could shake the fabric of society in its own matrix of structure. Just remember everyone, they can try, but the spirit of piracy will always live on in us all, no matter who it is. Everyone pirates, even if they don't know it."

,Amrodyrius,2010-03-26T03:36Z,"It's a shame many of you think Freedom of speech has something to do with copyrights...

Let's take an daily example: When I go to the video store, ask the man behind the counter whether I can get a free film and get an ""no"" as an answer; I am then allowed to call him a jerk. (This is Freedom of Speech, for the ones who don't knew it.)

If I would go to the same store the next day, and again ask for a free film, with an ""no"" as an answer. I will cut his security systems, and rob the place, only because I 'know' that Freedom of Speech gives me the right to rob the poor video store keeper.

Freedom of Speech; as the name suggests, is SPEECH, when I speak to someone, I give my SPEECH away. It will come out of my mouth, the words I say are being transmitted through sound waves to the receiver; in this case a person I talk to. This is Freedom of Speech.

Copyright infringement/piracy; has nothing to do with being allowed to say something. You are allowed to say that you do not agree with Copyrights, but you are not allowed to cross the border between saying you are supposed to be allowed and just taking it.

Because of you idiots, who cannot see the difference between Freedom of Speech and Copyrights Laws, I have I fair chance to be caught because of some mp3's...

Another difference is: Freedom of Speech is a human right. Copyrights Laws are laws we actually need to abide. (Though I do not do this always... xD)

Though it might be able, that in the future when nobody is allowed to download copyrighted works and will be caught immediately... There will be a possibility, that in that future there will no such thing as Freedom of Speech...

You guys download a lot, I would encourage you to buy the movie : Equilibrium. Though I don't mind you downloading it, either.

In that movie one man pressed a law against emotions. Yes, for a good reason, as human emotions are mostly the cause for bad things like wars. But it does suppresses the people, they aren't even allowed to laugh, or even have a painting in the living room.

I do not encourage such an society, therefore who do need to be careful with what kind of laws are getting passed. 

This probably is the main reason why so many people are confusing Freedom of Speech with Copyrights together.

If someone doesn't agree with me fine, but I would like to hear your point of view. I will probably not read these comments anymore as there are over 497 comments, and probably still counting."
,Amrodyrius,2010-03-26T03:56Z,"One other question: What should you want when you release an album, book, movie, tv show, or something else?

Be honest; wouldn't you want to get more income? What if your book has been bought 2 times (40 euros total) while they spread the book over the internet, to hundreds of people.
Would you like that?

Also take a look here: http://www.archive.org/index.php  --> It's the internet archive, where there are many sorts of things to find. Audiobooks, music, radio broadcasts. All or without any sort of Copyright or in the Public Domain. And there still is quite interesting stuff on there. Like the whole radioplay broadcast on Halloween 1938 or something, of the book War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells. The legendary broadcast few people still know. Most of the people are probably after their 30's, I'm still 19... :D It's an honour to be one of the few who actually know the broadcast.

Copyrighted stuff isn't the only stuff on Earth. There are a lot of non-copyrighted stuff out there, which might be of interest to someone.

Wow, it's extremely difficult to take anything you say seriously when you can't even fucking spell or use proper grammar. 

Yes, some of the people on here suffer from the same complex, but at least they don't pretend to be all fucking high and mighty.

Obviously you have not read this document, and thought about it logically, because unless you are a multimillionaire, this affects you boy-oh.

Are you going to tell me that you don't own an iPod, or any form of portable music player? You don't own a cell phone capable of storing music? You purchase an additional copy of everything for each specific use? I don't fucking think so.

This act addresses the fact that even if you own the CD in the first place, and you rip a copy to your music player, you have there-in broken the law. You should have to purchase the CD for your CD player, and purchased another copy to use on your MP3 player. 

If you've ever lent a CD, or DVD, or movie to a friend to watch, you've broken the law. 

If you are that blind, that you can't realize that this act is just a way to make the rich; richer, then you should just go ahead and lobotomize yourself.

Digital media is the only thing in the world that once you purchase it, you are limited to what you can do with it, and there is no form of quality control to the end-user. You buy a car, you decide to sell it, you do it. You buy a house, you decide to sell it, you do it. You buy a TV, and you decide to sell it, well guess what, you can fucking do that too. In these peoples terms, once you buy a CD, that shit had better stay on lockdown. What other fucking industry in the world litigates that once you purchase the product, if you don't like it, go fuck yourself. That's right, NONE. You buy a movie, it sucks, well too bad, there is no refund, there is no exchange, NOTHING. 

If you took a good look at my DVD/CD collection, you would see hundreds, and I mean HUNDREDS. Why? because I watched them first, if I liked them, I BOUGHT THEM. Deserved revenue, what a fucking concept?!?!? There is no other industry in the fucking world that has this kind of policy.

[edit] Secrecy of negotiations

The Electronic Frontier Foundation opposes ACTA, calling for more public spotlight on the proposed treaty.[45] Since May 2008 discussion papers and other documents relating to the negotiation of ACTA have been uploaded to Wikileaks,[13] and newspaper reports about the secret negotiations swiftly followed.[8][20][46]

In June 2008 Canadian academic Michael Geist writing for Copyright News argued that ""Government Should Lift Veil on ACTA Secrecy"" noting before documents leaked on the internet ACTA was shrouded in secrecy. Coverage of the documents by the Toronto Star ""sparked widespread opposition as Canadians worry about the prospect of a trade deal that could lead to invasive searches of personal computers and increased surveillance of online activities."" Geist argues that public disclosure of the draft ACTA treaty ""might put an end to fears about iPod searching border guards"" and that it ""could focus attention on other key concerns including greater Internet service provider filtering of content, heightened liability for websites that link to allegedly infringing content, and diminished privacy for Internet users."" Geist also argues that greater transparency would lead to a more inclusive process, highlighting that the ACTA negotiations have excluded both civil society groups as well as developing countries. Geist reports that ""reports suggest that trade negotiators have been required to sign non-disclosure agreements for fear of word of the treaty's provisions leaking to the public."" He argues that there is a need for ""cooperation from all stakeholders to battle counterfeiting concerns"" and that ""an effective strategy requires broader participation and regular mechanisms for feedback"".[47]

In November 2008 the European Commission responded to these allegations as follows:

    ""It is alleged that the negotiations are undertaken under a veil of secrecy. This is not correct. For reasons of efficiency, it is only natural that intergovernmental negotiations dealing with issues that have an economic impact, do not take place in public and that negotiators are bound by a certain level of discretion. However, there has never been any intention to hide the fact that negotiations took place, or to conceal the ultimate objectives of the negotiations, the positions taken in European Commission Trade 5/6 the negotiations or even details on when and where these negotiations are taking place. The EU and other partners (US, Japan, Canada, etc.) announced their intention to start negotiations of ACTA on 23 October 2007, in well publicised press releases. Since then we have talked about ACTA on dozens of occasions, including at the European Parliament (INTA committee meetings), and in numerous well attended seminars. Commission organised a stakeholders' consultation meeting on 23 June in Brussels, open to all ? industry and citizens and attended by more than 100 participants. US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and other ACTA partners did the same.""[1][citation needed]

In New Zealand InternetNZ is responding to the lack of transparency in negotiations by holding an open public event to critique the known and likely content of ACTA proposals, enable people to connect and discuss the issues, and to develop an agreed statement to deliver to New Zealand Government negotiators and politicians. PublicACTA

will be held on Saturday, 10 April 2010, two days ahead of Round 8 of the ACTA negotiations on 12-16 April in Wellington. Michael Geist will be keynote speaker at the event.
[edit] Legal scope

It has been argued that the main thrust of ACTA is to provide safe harbor for service providers so that they may not hesitate to provide information about infringers; this may be used, for instance, to quickly identify and stop infringers once their identities are confirmed by their providers. Similarly, it provides for criminalization of copyright infringement, granting law enforcement the powers to perform criminal investigation, arrests and pursue criminal citations or prosecution of s"

I completely disagree.  Internet piracy is not stealing, because nothing is lost by the other party.  They claim that they lose sales.  I don't believe that at all.  There isn't one movie that I have downloaded that I would have bought had it not been available.  There are several that I decided to buy because I downloaded them first and found they were worth owning.  Thus, in my example and I think that of many others, piracy boosts sales.  The movie industry is simply using it as a scapegoat.  The real reason their tickets sales are down is, simply, they aren't making many good movies.  Most of them are a waste of time and money."

Your sale. 

""They claim that they lose sales.""
They do because who would pay for a movie when you can download it in 30 minutes. 

""There isn't one movie that I have downloaded that I would have bought had it not been available.""
Doesn't matter, you still watch it, you still consumed it. Doesn't matter if you were GOING to go and see it and that you were going to pay the money. You still consumed it. 

""There are several that I decided to buy because I downloaded them first and found they were worth owning.""
You still consumed IP of the ones you did not consume. 

""Thus, in my example and I think that of many others, piracy boosts sales. The movie industry is simply using it as a scapegoat.""

I bought it for study. 

An interesting question. How about you go to the library rather than download it? It seems to make sense. I'm not sure how a library works, whether or not they pay more money to make it publicly available and whether or not he producers get any of that at all. I'm not informed  and i have no counter. "

,Pirate_Aiden,2010-03-27T03:19Z,"I can see this becoming a concern for jobs. Primarily in media design.

Most graphic artists, designers and programmers like myself spark these interests when they're young. However, most 12-18 year olds don't have 4 grand to throw at companies like Adobe to obtain these programs. Sure you could download trials again and again but the task eventually becomes tedious and loses the person's interest.
Personally, if I haven't had access to these programs I wouldn't have any interest in digital design/programming at all, and I'm sure I wouldn't have been the only one.
My point is, aside from taking away our privacy and internet freedom, it also takes away our future. This lack of interest for the young population could eventually bring a lack people specialized in websites, film and advertising. This would cause companies' profit to plummet. Lack of programmers to make better software, and lack of graphic designers to advertise.

And as far as pirating goes, it can't be called ""stealing"". If I'm downloading a program that's worth 4 grand and they say they're losing money from it, they're not, cause if I didn't have free access to they're programs I wouldn't pay them to get it anyway. they aren't losing money, but they aren't gaining money.

,AwesomeNinja,2010-03-27T07:17Z,"@Wholemeal

I understand that you're trying to take the morale and ethical side, but surely you can't believe that this is the solution.

IP as a concept itself is extremely loosely defined, and constantly changing in it's definition. Look at the incredible things pirating itself has led to, the innovations and changes that I GUARANTEE would never have come about. The portable mass-storage music player surely would have never been invented, why is there such a demand for iPod's and iPod-integrated technologies? Because the market is there, why is the market there? Pirating. 

You're right, stealing is stealing, but to classify pirating into a black or white category is just naive and foolish. If you walk into a store, and steal a television, you are costing that store the amount they paid for that television. If you download an MP3, it's not the same circumstance in any way shape or form. 

I believe that artists deserve to be paid and compensated for their work, but it comes down to how much they are actually receiving for their own property and quality. 

Like I stated before, you can't walk into a store, buy a CD, decide that it's utter trash, and walk back in and return it. You can't walk into a movie theater, watch a movie, and if the thing was a pile of shit, get your money back. This is the point I'm mainly arguing. In every other industry, once you purchase something, it's yours, you've exchanged your own income for a product, therefore the product is now yours. Not true with digital media, and the money hungry media industries see this as money they deserve. 

Like I've said, if I downloaded a song, or a movie, and decided it was good, I purchased it. I have a few DVD's that aren't even opened, simply because I thought the end product was worth my hard-earned money. 

I'm sorry, but I will never agree with your arguments, simply because you are arguing the point of the producer, and not the consumer. In the end, a product is a product, if it's good, you pay for it, if it's not, you don't buy it. Simple as that."

No one ever bothers to comment on anything. Except when this happens. Oh my god, we've stolen a lot of artists out of the business but THEY are wrong. Hey, I'm not holier than thou, I've participated. But there are other ways to fuck the industry. Buy with artists directly, for one. Don't buy iTunes, buy at concerts, at comic-con's,
So in the end, what has been said from the start is true. If you steal long enough, in time you think you have the right to do it. Talking about religious fanatics. You can throw in every argument, but it comes down to one thing. You take a peace of art (or crap for that matter) from an artist who worked for it and you do not pay for it.

some of you should remember napster. they shut that down admittedly, but then what happened? 

most of the musicians and 'artists' are cool with having their music online.

people like soulja boy wouldnt exist if it wasnt for people downloading his music online.

Days after announcing the album's completion, Radiohead released In Rainbows as a digital download that customers could order for whatever price they saw fit. Upon its retail release, In Rainbows entered the UK Album Chart and the U.S. Billboard 200 at number one; by October 2008, it had sold more than three million copies worldwide in both digital and physical formats. The album earned widespread critical acclaim, and was ranked as one of the best albums of 2007 by several publications. In 2009, the record won two Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Special Limited Edition Package.

Increased vigilance and new more subversive technology will always outdo the authorities, but for too long we've been doing whatever we want with relatively little security and nothing but the minor annoyance of ISP throttling. Maybe the increased risk will convince people to buy software and movies they think are worthy of their wallet, and stop the audacity of the community on the whole and their perception of invincibility."

This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch,
the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already
existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't
run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We
explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge...
and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without
nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and
lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet
we're the criminals.

Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they
look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that
you will never forgive me for.

I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this
individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike."

,Elestia,2010-03-27T22:09Z,"Personally, im not going to worry. Infact... im glad. 
going from past experiences and with examples throughout history, people 
always find new and inventive ways to beat the system once idiotic laws have been 
passed and i doubt this will be any different.

As they 'evolve', so do we and there are more dedicated people out their
(In My Opinion) that work towards making software/movies/music/ect free
for everyone, through !SHARING!.

What i do want to say though, to the people shouting ""RIOT"" and talking about
how ACTA is somekind of... anti-chirst (for lack of a better term) - you
need to read their entire proposal.

Their proposals for Counterfeit Goods (Phsyical items) being sold will actually
boost the economy for most countries... The US Economy alone, and im talking
workforce here (us regular working folk), not the big corporations or government
are loosing 10's even 100's of potential Billions of dollars becuase of it.

add to that the counterfeiting of documents which as well as costing us more
money is also opening the door to terrorists...

Their big downfall... is the handling of the Digital Intellectual-Property-rights
- but again, if you read the links provided and search the internet their solutions
are being scoffed at by most countries who will more than likely be subsitituting
their own rules for Digital IPR anyways (UK seems pretty chilled about it ^^).

TBH i believe America's probably going to come down hardest on us, mainly due to
pressure - being pretty much the 'hub' of all this and becuase we are one of the
most effected countries, finacially.

Finally, going back to what i said origianlly. Whatever happens, if people want to share
Digital Media accross the interent... people will, whether its still being done
as it is now or with some new program or technology and id suspect that whatever the
outcome.

We'll still have TBP ;).

That being said, the Canadian government is ill-prepared to police and imprison people for this percieved crime. They recently only began prosecution over filming in theaters, mainly in Quebec.
As far as I'm concerned they can all kiss my ass. Unlike the US, we have laws in this country which protect citizens from government interference such as forcing ISP's to reveal information.
Under the US Homaland security act rights were lost that prevented the government from seeking this information regarding their own citizens. Try and do that in Canada and see what happens.

,UndeadxNurse,2010-03-28T10:07Z,"Whatever happens, I still have this in mind;

I've spent a lot of my money on albums and movies that turned out to be absolutely terrible, I've spent $19.99 USD on a fucking CD just to listen to three songs because they were the only good songs from the album.

Now, granted, if I hear something for free that I enjoy and I like the entire album or CD, I buy it so I know for a fact that they aren't losing a dime when it comes to me.

Need I remind everyone of the health care plan? They're expecting 90Billion dollars in 10 years, some of the citizens currently can barely afford to put food on their table, let alone waste money on a movie or album that turns out to be a piece of shit like most of the mainstream music has been as of late.

Perhaps instead of buying fancy vehicles and 900 dollar thongs, they should save their money so that they wouldn't be bitching about having 150 thousand in their wallet instead of 650 thousand.

Some politicians say that banning these bribes is taking away free speech.  This is not true, because a) Freedom of speech is already chimerical in the US. b) Nobody is stopping them from sending volunteers door-to-door to garner support if they wanted to.  Hollywood should cease this agenda and license its movies to free sites supported by ads.(ex. Hulu)   If you believe in morals, then you will see how it is wrong for these big corporations to persecute the powerless grubs like me.  We can't let them have that power, so always check what companies and interest groups are backing who you plan to vote for.  Every DVD you buy helps the corporations take away your rights.  And for this reason, I will never buy commercial DVDs or CDs, and continue to teach my friends how to use BitTorrent.    Copying files isn't stealing and I hope this DMCA crap never makes any further progress. My advice is to steer away from the conservatives but also keep a close watch on the liberals."

Remember; Piracy is a much bigger issue than rape, murder, pedophilia, torture and hostage situations, it's also a much bigger issue than war, famine, disease, those who suffer because they can't afford medical cards and things of the sort.

It's also much bigger than the cartels who are smuggling drugs into the country, slavery (which is still occurring), prostitution, kidnapping and illegal immigrants.

People work like this - you are allowed somewhere. You check it out. It\'s cool, but you like some other places better. But when someone isn\'t allowing you to get in again, you feel the urge to bypass the security and get in, because it\'s much better when it\'s unavailable isn\'t it?nnFor example, Call of Duty 6..everyone said it\'s gonna be great, and people were like yeah we\'ll play some multiplayer as well, not a big deal. But when they cut-out dedicated servers, everyone was OMG I WAS GOING TO BUY THE GAME JUST SO I CAN HOST. Bullshit. They only wanted it because they couldn\'t have it.nnThat\'s the way I see it.
