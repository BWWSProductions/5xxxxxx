mc68 NOTES

"This is the typical screener - workprint, counter at bottom but im sure other releases with blurred counter or even cropped image at the bottom to remove counter will appear". Hence why I opted to not blur the counter and crop it instead. The timer was on the very bottom and not much is missed with it cropped. I don't..Dont like the timer or the blur if I can help it...Fixed Resolution-Aspect Ratio & Proper for size....
Already burned and tested on my standalone DivX player and it turned out sweet. NJOY..
