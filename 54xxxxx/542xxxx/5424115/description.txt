In case anyone wonders, this is a perfectly legal torrent, and Mr Chaitkin wanted his book made available for free on the internet. This is just another method of distribution of his book. There is another book essential to understanding the history of the USA, and this is How the Nation was won, by H. Graham Lowry. This is not on torrent, but is available from Archive.org at the following link:

Also, a very interesting look into modern history, by an associate of Mr Chaitkin, Helga Zepp-Larouche, The Hitler Book.
