Product Description:
No more messy time sheets and forgotten tasks. Now employees can track and record their time as they work. DesignSoft StopWatch Plus time sheet features both a timer window and a time sheet window for tracking work on multiple projects or for tracking uptime and downtime. Use it all by itself as a personal time tracker or align employee code, project number, task code, and description entries with DesignSoft Time Sheet Manager or DesignSoft Creative Billing Online's own project files.
