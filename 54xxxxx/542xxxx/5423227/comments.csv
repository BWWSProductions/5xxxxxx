,ToonPal,2010-10-11T02:56Z,"Installing this on a Dell computer, no product key is required since a special Dell-specific OEM product key tied to the Dell BIOS is written into the XP Setup configuration.  If this disc is used to install Windows XP on a non-Dell system, however, a generic OEM product key from an OEM certificate of authenticity sticker will be required to activate Windows.

To the one with the difficulties manipulating desktop objects, it may be that a driver that was slipstreamed into XP Setup by Dell that may be too old for or incompatible with your system.  This disc is made specifically for Dell systems and has a lot of stuff slipstreamed into it, so there's no guarantee it will work correctly on other computers.  Try updating your drivers, your display driver first.  You may have to use Safe Mode in the process."
,luckyhbr,2010-10-17T03:58Z,it contains sata drivers? Or Ata only?

,markdavies3912,2012-03-15T00:00Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS SHIT!! IT HAS A PRE INSTALLED VIRUS IN THE rundll32.exe FILE AND AS SOON AS U USE ANY PROGRAM WHICH USES A dll FILE, IT RIDDLES UR SYSTEM WITH A VIRUS WHICH COLLATES AND COLLECTS ALL YOUR PASSWORDS AND PERSONAL FILES!!!

YEAH SURE IT WORKS IF YOU DONT INSTALL A VIRUS CHECKER BUT Y TAKE THE RISK

KYTHRONE U R A CUNT AND I WILL CERTAINLY KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR YOUR SHIT IN THE FUTUTRE AND AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE, FUNNILY ENOUGH JUST LIKE  YOUR FILE"
,markdavies3912,2012-03-15T00:07Z,"A NOTE TO ALL WHO  HAVE ALREADY GOT THIS ON YOUR MACHINE, YOU HAVE BEEN INFECTED AND WILL SOON FIND OUT THAT YOU ARE PART OF A BOT NET, MOST PROBABLY DESIGNED BY THE UPLOADER, WHO PROBABLY ALREADY KNOWS ALL YOUR SECRETS ANYHOW


ONCE UPLOADED GO TO C:WINDOWSSYSTEM32 AND LOOK FOR THE FILE IN 'R' CALLED rundll32.exe AND IF THE ICON IS A PAGE AND NOT A SYSTEM COG WHEEL AS IT SHOULD BE THEN YOUR MACHINE IS TOO INFECTED!!!

KYTHERONE U R A TWAT AND A WORTHLESS HUMAN BEING IF EVEN U R 1"
,Kythorne,2012-06-10T23:47Z,"markdavies3912,

The ISO was ripped directly from an OEM Dell XP disk.  My intention here is to give back what I can to the file-sharing community.  The problem may be that you're too incompetent to install an operating system.  Anyway, thank you for avoiding my uploads; I prefer it that way.
;)"
,bobalo,2012-07-01T22:22Z,"You fucking cunt... i burned this shit on dvd , windows started to install and upon loading files from this shit i got a BSOD saying- A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer. Check for viruses on your computer...
You piece of shit!! PEOPLE DONT INSTALL THIS"
,bobalo,2012-07-01T22:47Z,"Nevermind my last post , i tried original XP disc and i get the same error on my dell vostro 1530... but then again it might be because i am already infected... idk :S"
