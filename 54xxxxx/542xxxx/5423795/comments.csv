Simple & smooth install but unable to activate W7 Enterprise with KMS Activator. Message log is:-

[V],Murlok,2010-03-13T22:57Z," kanp   find this comments

DONT INSTALL ""KB1033"" from microsoft or you to will be reinstalling.it found my bie patch.

I just uninstalled the KB1033 patch from my ""uninstall programs"" settings in control panel.  No big deal, no need to uninstall.  Then you can just reinstall the bootloader.

If that will help you :)"

Activation has not worked with the crack (invalid serial, perhaps I didnt make the good serial:) but it was very easy, as said thesingy, with Microsoft KMS Activator 5 and Seven is now activated. THX !
Just 2 questions:

-How can I install a french pack langage (if it is possible) ?"
