,Jake415,2010-03-10T04:28Z,"""You ain't seeding you ain't succeeding""? Bit of a fail really seeing as though NO ONE is seeding AT ALL...for the sake of those who want this game...please seed!!!"
[T],Games4theworld,2010-03-10T16:10Z,"Hi, 

  Please note that this Torrent has JUST BEEN UPLOADED and that means that only our Seeding Central is Seeding it until more people have got the files. Please also note, we're humans like you and we CAN NOT SEED FOR 24/7, but we are doing are best to seed as much as possible. Please keep that in mind when you see one of our Torrents has just been Uploaded."

,Sentinalh,2010-03-11T02:52Z,"Everyone should be grateful that they are getting something for nothing. If you want the game immediately go out and buy it. If you want it free you'll have to wait, that's the trade off you're making.

Also wanna say thanks very much for uploading this game I've been wanting it and will seed once I get it downloaded, I'm in no hurry."
,tuckerton296,2010-03-12T01:36Z,is this online?
[T],Games4theworld,2010-03-12T14:20Z,"Hi,


   Yes, an Online Crack is included."
,Sentinalh,2010-03-15T18:27Z,"Just a quick question, one which I think is rather important. How am I supposed to play this if I can't save the game because I don't have a code to register a Live account? "
,Sentinalh,2010-03-15T18:47Z,"Problem all fixed, thanks Live Support."
,Ashwin1337,2010-03-15T21:25Z,"Just a quick question, one which I think is rather important. How am I supposed to play this if I can't save the game because I don't have a code to register a Live account? 

Having the exact same problem."
,Sokii,2010-03-16T08:40Z,"Same problem:
How do I play without a Live Account?"
,Sweden97,2010-03-16T15:30Z,"i press and i press and ive done exactly what i should and ive got windows 7, but, nothing happens, whatever i press.. and i followed the insctructions COMPLETELY! nothing that i done wrong, but u cant just start it up, exactly nothing changes -.-"
,Ashwin1337,2010-03-16T15:52Z,"i press and i press and ive done exactly what i should and ive got windows 7, but, nothing happens, whatever i press.. and i followed the insctructions COMPLETELY! nothing that i done wrong, but u cant just start it up, exactly nothing changes -.- 

Had that problem too, re-installed the game and it worked. If only i was able to save my game.."
,Sentinalh,2010-03-17T04:24Z,"To save your game go into the WL cloud and make a new profile button. Scroll to the bottom of the text and click the blue ""Make local account"" text and it'll work.

I've just been punched in the face by the game. I was close to the end, after a really climactic scene and I tried to save after regaining control only to be told the game ""failed to retrieve saved games list"" all the saves were gone, I couldn't save, the game quit and now it won't come back. Every time I boot it up the screen blackens, the arrow appears and soon after it closes to desktop. NEED HELP!!"
,Sentinalh,2010-03-17T05:54Z,"Nevermind, seems to be a common problem and found a fix on a forum, unfortunately I'll now have to start over from the beginning. 

Note to everyone getting this game, quicksave can corrupt and cause this error, manual save to avoid!"
,Ashwin1337,2010-03-17T13:51Z,"Everything solved for me now, awesome game. Thx!"

,.Steph.,2010-03-23T21:52Z,Whenever i click the launcher it says it dont have the disk inserted?...
[T],Games4theworld,2010-03-24T16:39Z,"Hi,

  You forgot the Crack -part:

3. Open the '# Crack' folder in this .rar file and copy + paste the 'SP' รกnd 'MP' folder 
to: C:\Program Files\2K Games\BioShock 2  and REPLACE them by the existing ones.


Ps. For Windows 7 users the Game Directory will be: C:\Program Files (x86)\2K Games\BioShock 2 

For more information, feel free to contact our (Live) Support: Games4theworld@hotmail.com"
,fierguy,2010-03-27T16:50Z,"Hello, I was just wondering if you could help me with step 3, because I dont have a 'copy' or 'paste' option for the SP, and MP files.
Please help me when you get the chance."
[T],Games4theworld,2010-03-28T13:11Z,"Hi

Just drag & drop the files to the folder."
,b1ackmamba,2010-03-29T03:08Z,"hi there, it's not working for me, i've installed it and everything but neither of the launchers work. One of them does nothing, and the other says there's no disc inserted. what should i do?"

,JD92,2010-05-02T19:49Z,"hi there, it's not working for me, i've installed it and everything but neither of the launchers work. One of them does nothing, and the other says there's no disc inserted. what should i do? 


Yeah im experiencing the same problem atm, what to do??"
,guyfromfinland,2010-05-04T18:13Z,have you done the crack  part
,JD92,2010-05-07T16:39Z,Yeah ive followed all instructions. But cant start/launch it :/
[T],Games4theworld,2010-05-07T17:17Z,"Hi,


 It looks like this Game doesn't work for some people, randomly. There's nothing we can do about it, sorry."
,Eron68,2010-06-07T02:41Z,"Hi. Just downloaded this today. Got it working after a bit of niggling.

Unfortunately, my computer (laptop) is not good enough to run the game, even on lowest settings.

Anyway, thanks for the download--at least now I know to pick this up for my ps3 ;)"
,twilightwalker,2010-06-07T22:43Z,"Okay, so for the people that are saying it isn't working

Don't copy over the whole folder, just select the files they tell you to and it should work, albeit with the saving problem. Copying over the entire folder is what results in the whole ""will not launch"" error, I've been playing it just fine with just the few files copied. "
,alcapowned,2010-09-18T15:58Z,"The download worked for me, and the first time I ran it i was able to play it. When I opened it up today, it kept saying ""Bioshock 2 isn't responding etc etc"" then closed it.
Also i've had problems with saving when i was playing, sometimes it would say that I couldn't save"
[T],Games4theworld,2010-10-19T14:54Z,"Hello,
