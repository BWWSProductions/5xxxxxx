         Today, one of our members leaves the building.              
         We had great times  together  as he is a very nice person   
         with a good sense  of humor. Also  he  is a very talented   
         reverse  engineer who did a great job in  breaking modern   
         software  protection  schemes  :P  His  presence  will be   
         greatly  missed,  but as  we all know, there are times in   
         ones  life  that  one  must   follow through  with  their   
         decisions.  So for now,   we  wish you farewell and ROGUE   
         will  be  here waiting  on  your  return. In  that sense,   
         farewell!
