    SecureCRT is a terminal emulator for secure access to    
      network devices and business applications on UNIX,        
      Linux, or VMS systems. Built on IETF standard             
    protocols, SecureCRT supports SSH2, SSH1, Telnet,          
    Telnet/SSL, Serial, and other protocols. SecureCRT has   
   file transfer capability and saves time by eliminating      
    many repetitive manual tasks.
