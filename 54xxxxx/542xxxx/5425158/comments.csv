,andy72184,2010-03-16T04:22Z,To answer to your question because someone can't post it in the info description.  This is PAL.  The Audio tricks you the second you see the 20th century fox whatever and goes to straight Cam audio shit audio but the picture is watchable.
,Lucy_Fear,2010-03-17T08:10Z,A timewaster
,Outback6,2010-03-18T00:55Z,"It would be so helpful if uploaders would include whether movies are NTSC or PAL in their description.

This is PAL encoded."

,mahler,2010-03-20T18:04Z,"SOmething terrible wrong with the film music audio. V=10 
A= 2"
,stenare,2010-04-07T22:33Z,"First of all: Don't complain about missing subs. The worst thing that can happen to a movie is translations... Most cockhead assholes can't translate a dicks worth, tossing words around, changing the meaning, ignoring the true meaning - And the worst of all; Adapting the language to their own instead of making the best of it!

Secondly, you who're complaining about being stuck at 9x% - No wonder since most are NOT allowing their clients to download ""first & last piece""!
This setting in ÂľTorrent is found in Prefs->Advanced. Select ""bt.prio_first_last_piece"" and set it to true"
,highsant,2010-04-10T11:37Z,"goeie film en kwaliteit, jammer van de snelle afloop aan het eind, zit meer in"
