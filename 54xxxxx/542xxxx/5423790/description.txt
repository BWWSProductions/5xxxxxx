Alex talks with Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer, a Bronze Star recipient who is a CIA trained senior intelligence operations officer and Army Reserve lieutenant colonel with more than 25 years of experience in the intelligence community. Shaffer is known for his connections and revelations regarding the Able Danger program that uncovered two of the three terrorist cells involved with 9/11 one year before the attacks.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
