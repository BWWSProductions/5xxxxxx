,lies3,2011-06-16T19:10Z,"I like the speakers much better in this one than in http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3308610/Pimsleur_speak_and_understand_japanese_I_II_III___Misc_books , and they both seem to be third edition. What's the difference? What would I look for to find all of Level I with these speakers?

I guess for now I'll just download these 8 and the other 22 from the other torrent."
