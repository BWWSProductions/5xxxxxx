Electronic Arts released one of its biggest movie-to-videogame conversions during the holiday season of 2002 with The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers for GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. Taking players on an epic quest, based on the modern cinema trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, The Two Towers delivers intense, large-scale action with tons of swordplay and all the trimmings of learning through experience. The more than 12 levels are directly taken from scenarios and events that appeared in the first two first films and EA added a smattering of bonus content on top of it, including interviews with all the principal actors, stills, trailers, and more.
