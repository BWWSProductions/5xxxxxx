If you want to play in a bigger window use NDS2xGL2

Have fun everyone and thank you for uploading bulletzz74"
,tpbSurge69,2010-03-12T14:13Z,I was thrilled to finally find a proper english version... unfortunatly I can't get past where you put your name in on either game using the pc emulator :(
,b5200,2010-03-12T16:31Z,The screen goes black after the name process for me too.  I've been having this issue with other HG & SS .nds files too.  Anyone know a fix for this?
,zpitak,2010-03-12T17:29Z,"can you use it without that emulator, on a TTDS?"
,b5200,2010-03-12T17:38Z,"I found this on a forum and it worked for me.  

This game works in No$GBA 2.6a + No$Zoomer 2.3.0.2 + the BIOS & Firmware.bin [google search for biosnds7.rom and biosnds9.rom I found a torrent for it somewhere but I lost the link and this guide doesn't say where to get it.]. Anyway, you need to do the following:

- First, open any game (HG or SS). Go to No$GBA --> Options --> Emulation Setup (or with F11). On the Reset/Startup Entry point choose GBA Bios (Nintendo Logo) and click OK. 
- Now go to No$GBA options again and click SAVE OPTIONS. This way you won't have to do it everytime you start No$GBA.
- This is very important, go to File -> Open on No$Zoomer or simply press F12. Open your game again. RESET function won't work, as you will get a rom image crash.
- Choose your game just like you would do it on a real DS.

This way the game won't freeze after the Prof. Oak talk. So far saves and runs fine, Dunno it it will freeze at some other point.

Cheers!

Edit. If you don't use No$Zoomer, you will need to use eNDryptS Advanced (google for it). Put the rom file in the same dir as the program and run it. Choose the first option. Now you can run the game with No$GBA 2.6a using the steps above (otherwise the rom image will crash). This is not required if you use No$Zoomer, but it still works anyway."

,bazoop17,2010-03-13T19:20Z,how did you save?? save state? or  save in actual game.. and every time i try to load No$gameboy then No$Zoomer it just crashes unless i load No$Zoomer then No$gameboy then the game.. idk if thats a big difference.
,tpbSurge69,2010-03-13T21:41Z,"I played the game for about 6 hours untill it locked up, I had saved through the game but when I went to load it the save was not there so I am giving up on this.  

Why they don't just create a Pokemon PC game I don't know, the possibilties are endless and more people would be able to buy, not everyone owns a DS."
,IronTank05,2010-03-15T01:36Z,"Whenever the screen has to go black for a short moment, like opening the bag, or entering a room, the game occasionally freezes. I'm playing Soul Silver on a R4."
,texasman2,2010-03-15T07:52Z,"Ok, I have all the required materials to make all this work like the no$zoomer and all that, I just don't know how to make it all come together and work. Like what do I do with the BIOS? Help with this would be much appreciated "
,Everdred,2010-03-17T05:34Z,"Even though it was pricey, I had to buy this one. It comes with a ""pokewalker"", which is a little device similar to a giga-pet/pedometer. You can transfer one of your pokemon to it and as you take steps all day, your pokemon will gain experience points. You can get items from mini-games and even run into wild pokemon on it. It's pretty cool. Btw, F U to any haters, because I played red/blue when I was little, and I still think they're great games."
,RussianKillerTeady,2010-03-19T09:37Z,The reason that red blue and green are so cool is because the original legendary pokemon were outstanding ^^
,RussianKillerTeady,2010-03-19T10:07Z,"yeah, just made my character and then he shrinks down to a mini size, game goes black and freezes... any advice?"
,RussianKillerTeady,2010-03-19T10:14Z,"did all steps by b5200
but it still dont seem to work with no$gba :("
,swayzterbul,2010-03-21T01:39Z,"If you are suffering from black screen freezes while playing on no$gba emulator, particularly at the beginning the game after your character shrinks, follow these simple steps to fix:

Please note that I have only done this in Heart Gold version, I do not know if it will or won't work in Soul Silver.

1. Open your game in no$gba emulator normally.

2. Click the ""Utility"" drop-down and select ""Cheats"" from that menu.

3. Select the ""Add New"" button in the bottom left corner on the new window that has popped up.

4. Copy and paste the following code into the text area of the cheat window.

020DE16C E1A00000
020D3FA8 E1A00000

5. Before click okay, be sure that ""Action Replay DS"" is checked at the bottom of the window, and ""RAW"" is checkmarked underneath the okay and cancel buttons. Once you are sure of the proper settings, click okay. The name of the code does not matter.

6. Double click the code title in the cheats window to enable it. To make sure it is enabled, look for a check mark next to it.

As long as this code is activated, you will not have any black screens while starting your game or loading a saved game. You can activate and deactiviate it whenever you want.

Please note that this code ONLY fixes black screens while starting a game or loading saved games. Your game is still vulnerable to freezes, crashes, the works. My only advice is to save often, and close out of the emulator completely after each save. If you save, and then your emulator crashes before you exit the emulator completely, your data will be lost."
