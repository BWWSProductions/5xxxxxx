Ripped myself.

Use VLC Player or Winamp to listen to the tracks on your computer.

Use Flac Frontend to Convert into lossless WAV format if you prefer that

Use CDR Tools Front End to burn to a CD:

Ripped directly from CD using Exact Audio Copy.

Torrent INCLUDES .m3u playlist file!

Please seed at least 100%.

If you encounter any problems with the audio let me know. I didn't get a chance to test all the tracks (listen to all of it) and EAC was unable to verify if it was ripped correctly since this album isn't in their database. If EAC ripped it incorrectly let me know and I will re-release it with a fix.

Thanks! And Enjoy!
