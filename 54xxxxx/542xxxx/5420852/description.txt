Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban [PS2] [PAL] [MULTI7]

The Prisoner of Azkaban, like the book and the movie, follows Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The Boy Who Lived and his best friends Ron and Hermione once more struggle through the day-to-day at the infamous school, go to class, learn new spells, play Quidditch and, naturally, stumble smack-dab in the middle of another great mystery. For the first time ever, players will be able to control not only Harry, but also Ron and Hermione two, occasionally alternating between the characters to maximize each one's unique skills and powers. The title also features a variety of new characters, enables players to fly on Hippogriff, engage them in a wide selection of sub-quests and even features a host of two-player challenges.
