Matriarch Mama Joe has held her family together for 40 years around a Sunday 
dinner of soul food. When diabetes hospitalizes her, the dinners stop and tensions 
among her three daughters start to break the family apart. Two of the sisters 
feud continuously: Teri is jealous of Maxine's marriage and irritated that everyone 
assumes her corporate salary is open to the rest of the family's uses. Maxine 
resents Teri's bossiness and insensitivity to family tradition. Bird, the youngest, 
newly married to an ex-con, accepts a favor from an old lover that leads to her 
husband's arrest. Mama Joe's grandson Ahmad cooks up a scheme to bring the 
family together, back to the table.
