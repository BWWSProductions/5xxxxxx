Each programme would begin with Jones facing certain death in some bizarre circumstance, such as being put before a firing squad in Mexico, or being faced with a cobra in the jungles of South America. At the moment before his death, a guardian angel would appear and freeze time, then spend the rest of the show reviewing and interpreting the events which had led up to his impending demise.
