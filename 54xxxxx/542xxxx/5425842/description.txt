This all-star musical adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic tale will delight children and adults alike. Employing virtually every prominent British performer of its time, from pre-Bond girl Fiona Fullerton as Alice and pre-Phantom Michael Crawford as the White Rabbit, to comic luminaries Peter Sellers and Dudley Moore, this magical and intoxicating version explores Alice's dizzying adventures in the rabbit hole both faithfully and metaphorically as coming of age story.
