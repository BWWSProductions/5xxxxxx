This is Catch 22's first album and the only one that contains all of the original band members. It was released on march 24th 1998 by Victory Records all songs were written by Tomas Kalnoky except for "Supernothing" which is a Gimp song.

The album was re-recorded in 2006 by Tomas Kalnoky and his new band Streetlight Manifesto. The Streetlight Manifesto version has slightly different instrumentation then the original and has some added verses and the final track of the Streetlight Manifesto version "12341234" has an explanation of why the album was re-recorded instead of the crucial thanks and shout out in the Catch 22 version.
