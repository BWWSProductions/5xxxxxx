,AnalogTV,2010-03-08T21:13Z,"I am seeding quickly now, thank you for helping me and commenting. I had trouble seeding for more than four hours, because I used the torrent file that Vuze had created, then I downloaded the torrent file from TPB, and now it is working much better. My own torrent file had no trackers, but that might not be the only problem, because when I added a tracker, nothing happened. Explain that if you can. This is my second torrent, so I am not supposed to know this yet."

,AnalogTV,2010-03-09T20:53Z,Thanks for the comment! Finally! I hope for many more comments. I will upload more soon. That it took so long time to download was surprising to me. My client is online most of the time.
