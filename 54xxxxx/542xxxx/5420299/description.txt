I need your help! Please tell me what you think about this picture quality. The file is small, so it won't hard for you to download it. Watch it and write a comment.

The picture quality is low because it is low resolution, low bitrate and the antenna signal is analog and weak.

Is it acceptable? I have at least 10 000 of hours of TV from Sweden to upload if this is acceptable.
