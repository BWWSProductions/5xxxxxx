Glenn Beck Program for March 10th 2010


After reviewing the comments...I have decided to ignore them all and do what I want. =D


I will upload the audio and video of the last hour. Since you can select what files you want, people with slow connections can chose to not download the video. That way people who can will be able to see it and can help seed it.


Trust me...I'm a professional ;)
