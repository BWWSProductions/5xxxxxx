Tough All Over is an album by American country music artist Gary Allan. It was released on October 11, 2005 on the MCA Nashville label, and has been certified gold by the RIAA. Recorded after his wife's suicide, the album is more somber than his previous works, with several songs termed "excruciatingly sad."

Two songs from the album were released as singles: "Best I Ever Had", a cover of the 2001 Vertical Horizon song, and "Life Ain't Always Beautiful" . Both placed on the Billboard Top Ten Hot Country Songs charts.

Rhapsody (online music service) ranked the album #7 on its "Countryâ€™s Best Albums of the Decade" list. "Allan's sixth album was the first one released after his wife of three years committed suicide. This collection of haunting, heartbreaking songs chronicles his pain and, ultimately, his path back to living. Steeped in grief, Tough All Over is one of Allan's most consistent efforts to date, thanks in part to his gift of conveying emotions like regret, heartbreak and emptiness in a single, well-phrased line.
