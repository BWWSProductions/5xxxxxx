Spanning a quarter century, this four-CD-plus-bonus-DVD collection of 

previously unreleased recordings captures spirited Sinatra shows at the 

Sands, Caesar's, and Golden Nugget--performances that initially 

underscore the salutary effect the desert playground had on the singer's 

muse, then warmly chronicle the autumn years of a triumphant career. A 

pair of '60s gigs at the Sands (of which Sinatra was part owner) capture 

an artist still building on his musical legacy in the midst of rock's 

rising fortunes. The 1961 show turns on the riches of his Capitol years, 

a musically straightforward set that balances the singer's 

interpretations of reflective material like "Moonlight in Vermont" and 

"In the Still of the Night" with upbeat, typically playful renditions of 

such Sinatra signatures as "Young at Heart," "The Lady Is a Tramp," and 

"Witchcraft."


But it's the '66 performance that may be the most intriguing for 

Sinatraphiles: A live workout with Count Basie and his orchestra that 

eschews the singer's mid-decade comeback hits--and even material from the 

recent Sinatra-Basie collaboration--in favor of a sassy set that's less 

summit meeting than swinging soirÃ©e, a freewheeling highlight reel from 

his back catalog that finds singer and band engaging each other with 

playful, often dizzy abandon. The anthology's '82 and '87 sets from 

Caesar's and the Golden Nugget, respectively, aren't nearly as musically 

challenging, showcasing a vocalist and still-boisterous crowd-pleaser who 

might have stopped breaking musical ground, yet never ceased reveling in 

the glories--and laughs--he could still bring to the moment. Rat Pack 

partner in crime Dean Martin stops by Caesar's for some good-natured 

razzing, while daughter Nancy guests on the set's lovably ditzy take on 

"Somethin' Stupid." --Jerry McCulley
