,Superbus,2010-03-11T02:25Z,"Not to spam, but I have been testing this 3 ways now, the original way with 1.1 crack and skip tutorial only got me a couple more missions. After reading about editing saves, I edited my own save and played tutorial and carried renown and tonnage to the next 2 missions which i unlocked. I am also able to unlock Happy times this way.

I deleted backed up my SH5 folder and tried this one, I see Happytimes unlocked but even after talking to mission guy and accepting a mission I see no objectives anywhere?

I think the editing the .cfg's done correctly from start works better, and then mod in the renown items as available and spend renown, not sure how to get the next sub though yet. Also I was able to carry over my tonnage.

Anyone else having better luck?"
,STrjesi,2010-03-11T02:59Z,i know...after talking to mission guy and accepting a mission I see no objectives anywhere? thats why whan you accept a mission go to your sub and open the map.... in the left down corner try to click on the mission british supplies... after that you can see the objectives... if you dont see the full text in the left corner try to set full resolution.....
