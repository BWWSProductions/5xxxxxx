Sonically, Grand Funk's second live album, 1975's CAUGHT IN THE ACT, is a major improvement 
over the one-dimensional sound of its predecessor, 1970's LIVE ALBUM. The performances 
throughout CAUGHT IN THE ACT are consistent and energetic, resulting ... 
Full Descriptionin great versions of such GFR classics as "Footstompin' Music," 
"Closer to Home," "Shinin' On," and "The Railroad," as well as an album-closing 
cover of the Rolling Stones' classic, "Gimme Shelter." Unfortunately, Grand Funk Railroad 
would run out of steam not long after the release of CAUGHT IN THE ACT, breaking up one year later in 1976. 

Recorded live in Terre Haute, Indiana, Toledo, Ohio and Baltimore, Maryland in February 1975. 
Originally released on Capitol (11445).
