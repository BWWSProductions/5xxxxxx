I will keep seeding during working hours and some of the weekends.  I think availability not a big problem anymore but I will keep seeding till the  torrent can sustain itself.
Oops....I forgot to change my upload limit. I changed it so now my band withe of 12 Mb/s is available :)!!!!
Enjoy and keep seeding"
