Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll's masterpiece of fantasy, radiates with a star-studded cast, overflowing charm and dazzling effects! The adventure begins as Alice slips down a rabbit hole and tumbles into Wonderland - a dream land where the official language is Jabberwocky and the official sense is nonsense!

Meet a zany cast of characters: the tricky Cheshire Cat, the wild Mad Hatter at his very strange tea party, play silly word games with Major Caterpillar or stop to chat with the talking flowers. Drinking magic potions or sampling mystical mushrooms changes Alice into many different forms until she finds herself in the croquet court of the Queen of Hearts - where the Knave stands accused of stealing tarts. When Alice is called as a witness in the comical trial that follows, she confuses the King and Queen, who banish her to the real world, where she returns as an inspired and changed young woman. Alice in Wonderland's vivid landscapes and unforgettable characters will delight and mesmerize everyone who sees it.
