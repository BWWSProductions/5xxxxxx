Requires an internet connection on the computer you're installing it to."
,bridog80,2010-03-26T19:02Z,"Ok. This has NO service packs installed. Like it says, this is extremely stripped out. I suggest you only get this if you have either a PC from 1990, an eepc, or a netbook. I was able to find sp1a with some dedicated research, lol. Google XP SP1 download. And SP2 the same way. Although, good luck trying to make it fully functional. But I'm not complaining. I can play Combat Arms on my P4, with 512MB DDR Ram, lol. So thanks are in order. P.S. you could slipstream sp2 & sp3 before you install it. Doesn't change the memory use."
,bridog80,2010-03-26T19:04Z,@vahnx: I suggest you get yourself a copy of Windows 2000 for that machine.
,rob_nds,2010-03-28T00:15Z,"Hi, sorry. but is anyone else getting multiple problems installing everything? :) cos im trying to use this with vmware and it runs like a dream, but it doesnt work well with installing stuff???!!!"
,kingpossum4,2010-03-29T07:48Z,"@Vahnx, used on a 256mb RAM 900mHz laptop worked extremely fast

@Bridog80, I'm adding the sp1a link and the sp3 link to the description.

@rob_nds, you need to enable the Crpytography or whatever service"
,djrush,2010-04-18T20:08Z,I'm having problems using windows updates.. It wont install the BITS update or the windows installer update thus not allowing me to access the more important updates (ie. the microsoft drivers for my pci to cardbus bridge). ANY help would be appreciated..
,timeujmass,2010-04-24T03:51Z,can this version of window install language pack or keyboard from an original windows CD?
,Cycron,2010-08-26T20:51Z,How do I connect to internet with this? Do I need a special driver?
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-02-07T13:16Z,"In case anyone is using this (or another homemade nLite version of XP) to install on VMware Workstation or Fusion and cannot get the audio to work, try installing the SoundBlaster drivers Creative's website. The ones that work are the old ones for the ""16 PCI"" card.

Don't know if this link will work in a day or two, if not go to Creative's website and find the drivers for the Sound Blaster ""16 PCI"" card:

,KickassWashingMachine,2011-02-07T15:36Z,"Hmm... That would be the driver meant for older Workstations/Fusions. Now, it seems the ""Sound Blaster PCI 128"" driver is the right one to use:

,KickassWashingMachine,2011-02-07T15:37Z,"LOL :D Forget it, that links to the same download :) Either one will do!"
,cableman67,2012-01-14T03:37Z,Don't you dweebs know that this is a lite version meant to run on a netbook or laptop with a slow processor and not much memory because the older Windows versions are obsolete. When you install an operating system you go to the brand computer website and download the drivers you need. They are free. Windows 7 is the only version that has most all drivers already installed.
