This is something i was asked to post so here we are;
This is something i got a long time ago from Napster. Its an mpg file, a vhs rip of the 2 videos of Loudness performing (miming) the whole of the Thunder In The East album. Some are also in the form of promotional; videos (PV) This, as i said is not my rip although i do have the two videos. This is very rare so enjoy them!
