By the mid-'70s, a number of problems were threatening to break up the original 
line-up of Black Sabbath. The stress brought on by lengthy touring, drug use, 
and alcoholism had begun to dilute the band's original, influential heavy metal. 
Sabbath ... Full Descriptionbegan to drift away from the straight-ahead power 
rock of such classic albums as PARANOID and SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH, as evidenced 
by its final two albums to feature singer Ozzy Osbourne, 1976's TECHNICAL ECSTASY 
and 1978's NEVER SAY DIE. However, TECHNICAL ECSTASY does contain some intriguing, 
overlooked tracks. 

The best known song of the bunch is the album-closing rocker "Dirty Women," which 
explores the topic of prostitution, and was later featured on the original line-up's 
1998 live album, REUNION. Drummer Bill Ward sings his one and only song with the band, 
"It's Alright," which is amongst Sabbath's most pop-friendly compositions ever. Also 
featured is the pacing album opener "Back Street Kids," the heavy blues and funk of 
"All Moving Parts (Stand Still)," and the somewhat predictable "Rock n' Roll Doctor." 
Osbourne would grow disillusioned with the band and would leave after the completion of 
TECHNICAL ECSTASY's subsequent tour, but would eventually return for one final album and road jaunt.
