,.xMule.,2010-03-10T04:03Z,"Greetings all.  Here's an article you may want to think about the next time democrats use our broken Canadian system as a positive example of further government involvement in Healthcare.

http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2010/03/09/mtl-qc-health-wait-fournier.html

It should also be pointed out that we don't have a national healthcare program or ""free"" healthcare as some would believe.  Each province has its own program and unless you are poor, either you or your employer still pays for the insurance, much like in the states.

Wait lists and inefficiencies are rampant.  The shortest times for diagnostic scans in some of the best hospitals will still make you wait a month or two whereas I have heard of people getting them within a day or so in the states.  Thankfully we now have expanding private options and of course access to American private care that we are very kindly allowed to access.  In fact, the nearest American city to my own substantially larger city, with about 18 times as many people, has medical centers that advertise in our papers.

At one time our system was very simple and was basically meant to keep people from going into bankruptcy but government involvement has grown very problematic and social democrats (who have held power in provincial politics if not the national level) have pushed the issue till they are literally killing people with their good intentions.

My prayers are with you."

I heard something absolutely insane on the news today from our health minister.  He is looking into trying to make BC the ""Mayo of the North"", drawing people here from out of the country, including the states, here for medical services and charging them extra for it.

http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2010/03/09/bc-health-tourism-falcon-dix.html

I am all for expanding private options but this man is seriously out of touch!  This not only ignores the fact that we have huge wait lists, shortages of care providers and that a tremendous amount of our best doctors go to the states but also that when we pay for care out of pocket in states like Florida, there is a discount.

This is also coming from the side that is decried as the ""heartless"" capitalists, too.  Just further proof to me that the more government gets involved in some things, the more they fuck them up.

I tell you, even with the Dem madness down there, a move state-side is starting to look better and better."
