> Plot Synopsis: This heartwarming true story is an American adaptation of a 
> Japanese tale about a loyal dog named Hachiko. This very special friend 
> would accompany his master to the train station every day and return each 
> afternoon to greet him after work. Sadly his master departs one day, passes 
> away and never returns to the station. Hachiko faithfully returns to the 
> same spot at the station the very next day, and every day for the next nine 
> years to wait for his beloved master. During his daily visits, Hachiko touches 
> the lives of many who work near and commute through the town square. He teaches 
> the local people love, compassion and above all unyielding loyalty. Today, a 
> bronze statue of Hachiko sits in his waiting spot outside the Shibuya station 
> in Japan as a permanent reminder of his devotion and love. It's almost like 
> real life story, one who loves dogs can link up with this movie so badly.
