At Interscope Records, she worked as a songwriter penning music for established artists, such as Akon. During the same time, she began to play her music in clubs throughout New York City. After Akon recognized that Gaga also had vocal talent, he signed her to a joint deal with his own label, Kon Live Distribution. Gaga then started to work on new material for her debut album. She began working with a collective called the "Haus of Gaga" in 2008 and released her debut album The Fame, which she explained was "about how anyone can feel famous." The album peaked in countries like United Kingdom and Canada while being critically appreciated. To date, the album has spawned the international number one singles "Just Dance" (nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 51st Grammy Awards) and "Poker Face." After performing as the supporting act for New Kids On The Block and Pussycat Dolls, Gaga started her own headlining The Fame Ball Tour.
