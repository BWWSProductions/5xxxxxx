,CouchWarrior,2010-03-11T23:37Z,"thanks man, great work as always!!

i wonder if there is a way to get informed if a new show is online!? something like a tweet or so. 
any ideas?"
,FancyBot,2010-03-12T00:01Z,Hey couchwarrior -- go to sidereel.com and sign up and then you can subscribe to all the shows you like and be emailed a daily schedule of all the new shows.
,CouchWarrior,2010-03-12T00:42Z,"kool, thanks FancyBot!! 

That's just what i was looking for. BUT since I am from the EU, I cant watch the shows on hulu or such. 
thats why i hoped to get a direct link to TPB. anyway, now i at least have the schedule.  "
,panzersiddhartha,2010-03-14T22:42Z,Did you know that the same people who used to spamm us with horrible links and copypasted messages telling us about how great their streaming page is now use more refined methods?
,panzersiddhartha,2010-03-14T22:45Z,"PanzerSiddhartha - I did not know that, however do you mean? This is news to me. Thank you for telling me. I better start disregarding links on TPB completely, unless they are info on the specific file, like IMDB links and such.

...

I won't even drop the name of any of the good epodisode air time guides that are available. That would make me promote a specific one myself. Search for fuck sake. :) Many use them as basis for their auto downloaders in the torrent program of their choise. 

Hugs to all.
