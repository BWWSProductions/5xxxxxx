,Flavour_,2010-03-09T12:37Z,Seed pls!! My download speed is like less than 1kb for last two hours (((
,motley666,2010-03-09T16:57Z,"Starcraft 2 is not out yet and you insist that you have the full game? All of you who download, don't you know that it's impossible that this file contains starcraft 2? Visit some gaming sites and get some updates. Could it be possible that the game was released and only this crappy uploader had a copy and noone else in torrent sites? Don't buy darkvoid's bullshit."
,GeorgeZmith,2010-03-10T00:20Z,"Hey I am trading a starcraft 2 beta key, if you are interested you can contact me at this email!

,Flavour_,2010-03-10T12:32Z,"DarkVoidZealot, you know how fuckin annoying it is to download 80% and not be able to finish it? Can't u just seed for another few hours man???"
,megamanx1232,2010-03-20T16:23Z,"WTF.... I WAS GOING AT 400KB/S AND GOT 71 PERCENT DONE UNTIL EVERYONE STOPPED F***ING SEEDING!!!

START SEEDING CMON THATS THE ONLY WAY TORRENTS SURVIVE!!!"
,Cybride,2010-03-22T16:15Z,Speed goes down at 71.... 
,Bobbias,2010-03-29T05:39Z,"You guys are all idiots. Maps, AI, Launcher... Who needs to say that all those are in this torrent? Someone who is uploading a SC2 beta torrent that has a Launcher for playing solo, AI files so you can have an AI to fight, and maps to fight on. If it was SC2 Retail, he'd have labeled it as retail."
,veslesmedem,2010-05-31T14:31Z,"this torrent looks dead, no seeder and only 71% of data available, complete waste of time, dont download"
