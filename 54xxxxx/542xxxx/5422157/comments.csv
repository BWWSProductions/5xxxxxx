,VixtoSirchy,2010-07-17T06:52Z,"i really dont know a whole lot about this stuff, but when i imported it, my itunes was set to import at 192kbps... if that helps"
,Trisste,2010-08-28T11:16Z,192 kbps????? Unfbelievable! Dude Do you know that we have 2010 not 1999 ? 320 kbps only please...
,Trisste,2010-08-28T11:43Z,It's 160 kbps. What a **it...
,brutusjr,2010-09-22T02:26Z,@triste : by all means crap all over the guy! You can always choose not to DL
,grenole,2011-08-29T19:10Z,"320kbs rofllolmao! jegus! don't you foolz no that its 1994 not 2012? Really though, grow up people. 320 is also garbage because it being CBR masks the true quality and reencodes are rampant. Lame VBR 0 or 1 should be all we use."
,chibwack,2012-03-29T02:15Z,"Ehh, by Trisste's grammar skills, I can only assume he has no idea what any of what Grenole said means and simply assumes more is better.  If you want flawless quality, buy the damn cd!"
