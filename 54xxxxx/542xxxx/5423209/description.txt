It explores the journey children take in developing their creativity, and helps child care students and practitioners to nurture creativity in babies, toddlers and young children. Written by a leading expert in an integrated approach to early childhood development and learning, "Cultivating Creativity" links theory and practice to provide a clear framework for this difficult, but vital, aspect of development and learning. It covers: discovering your own creativity; developing creativity in children; the inclusion of children with special educational needs or disabilities; diversity and cross-cultural approaches; useful websites; and, resources, including videos, books and reader friendly journals. "Cultivating Creativity in Babies, Toddlers and Young Children" is written in the clear and accessible style associated with Tina Bruce's bestselling books, and is generously illustrated in full colour.

Students following Foundation Degrees, Early Childhood Studies Degrees, and Certificate and Diploma students on in-service accreditation programmes will also find it useful, as will those wanting an introductory Masters Degree text.
