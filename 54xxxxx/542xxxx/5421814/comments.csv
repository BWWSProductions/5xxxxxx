,imrealgod,2010-03-10T11:05Z,"Thanks loads FXG. You truly rock. But please don't tell me that soon you'll be turning to uploading only BRrips (like what ZEKTORM has begun to do lately). For F's sake, please don't do that.

Besides, I'll appreciate if you can throw some light on the following issue:

Now, I don't mean to be ungrateful here, its just curiosity. Why are your recent uploads of a larger size than what they used to be? They used to be around 700 MB, give or take a bit. At first I thought it may have to do something with quality. However, when I compared ""The Blind Side"" uploaded by you with the one ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5417870/The.Blind.Side.2009.DVDRip.XviD-Emery1337x ) uploaded by Emery2010, there was hardly any quality difference, despite being a big difference in size. While the one uploaded by you was of 900 MB, the one by Emery2010 was 703 MB. So, what's going on in here? Are your future uploads gonna be way bigger than what they used to be (that is, around 700 MB)?

Thanks again for this, though. Hope there ain't gonna be drastic changes here."
[V],Team_xRG,2010-03-10T18:06Z,lol its team :) 
,imrealgod,2010-03-10T20:54Z,"@Team_xRG: hmmmmm... then I think the team must take tips from the approx. 700 MB uploader/uploaders. Despite of the file size being small, the quality was almost always maintained. And a few won't prefer that to larger sized files."
