,matriarchies,2011-03-21T14:47Z,"Lots of video corruption--in the neighborhood of 20 separate glitches.  One of the first glitches occurs near the beginning, while Kimble is helping an injured guard out of the crashed prisoner transport bus.  It's not a question of system horsepower, I can rewind and see a glitch occur repeatedly at the same point in time.  I also rechecked my copy of the torrent.  mplayer Ubuntu version ""2:1.0~rc4~try1.dsfg1-1ubuntu1"" prints this message when it hits a glitch:

[h264 @ 0x7fbe9667a120]number of reference frames exceeds max (probably corrupt input), discarding one

In response to saeen, it is 1080p, unless you have a reason to believe it was upscaled from a 720p source.  The video resolution is 1920x1080 (an aspect ratio of 1.778, but beware: IMDb lists this film's aspect ratio as 1.85)."
