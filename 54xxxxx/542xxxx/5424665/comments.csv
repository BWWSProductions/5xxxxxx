maybe you should just use .rar instead?"
,werring,2010-03-12T00:46Z,dmg is difficult? :/all osX mac's have the ability to mount .dmg's.. and i think about 90% of all torrents for mac apps are .dmg
,themadtexan,2010-08-18T04:23Z,Will this work with a PC?
,borriffick,2010-10-11T08:37Z,I highly doubt it will work on PC. It's a Mac archive file.
