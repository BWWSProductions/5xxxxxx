,Heracles_4048,2010-03-17T17:38Z,Is there a crack? and how do I change the language from Russian to English? Thanks.
,Heracles_4048,2010-03-17T17:45Z,"scrap that, found the keygen, I need a hardware key to generate the keycode? what's the hardware key?"
,Heracles_4048,2010-03-19T09:57Z,"scrap that, got it working. Thanks for the torrent but how about some instructions next time? I'll help you out.

1. Download the file and mount it with daemontools or similar (the file should be called 'n be').
2. Install the game as you would usually. Install the update if you wish.  As luckbaby said, open ""AvatarInit.ini"" file under ""installation folder/bin"" and change language to english. 
3. When you try and run the game, the registration process will pop up. In Russian. There's no way to change this, but the game will still play in English. Select the second option from the two in here, 'Manual' in English.
4. On the next page of the window you should find a hardware key. Copy this hardware key.
5. Mount the image again and find the only folder with a Russian title on it. In here there should be a file, keygen.exe
6. Paste the hardware key into the keygen and it will generate a key for you. Copy the key in to the box below where you got the hardware key.
7. Continue and set the game up.

also, to the idiot who said the graphics are like PS1; try turning up the settings."

""Could not retrieve version number. Installation will be aborted."" 

Please help"

,ilovepiratebay333,2010-03-21T19:58Z,"to that guy that deleted my account on the forums: there are these plugins for browsers that make it so in 1 click it shortens and copies the url so it's even easier then highlighting, right clicking, and copying the original url...and i see no one answered my question here @_@ i guess i'll just uninstall and reinstall next time i get time, but i have to do homework now :p"

,lukafilipovic,2010-04-23T09:38Z,How to change language from russian to english??
,ncc46537,2010-04-30T00:38Z,"To the assholes that can't figure it out by reading the fuckin' comments like I did...

1) INSTALL THE FUCKIN' THING.

2) GO TO THE FUCKIN' INSTALLATION FOLDER AND FIND THE FILE ""AvatarInit.ini""!

3) SELECT THE SECOND FUCKIN' OPTION WHEN YOU START THE GAME, IT'S IN RUSSIAN, DEAL WITH IT.

4) COPY THE FUCKIN' HARDWARE KEY.

5) FIND THE FOLDER ON THE MOUNTED DISK IMAGE THAT HAS A RUSSIAN NAME, IT'S THE ONLY FUCKIN' ONE WITH A RUSSIAN NAME!

6) START THE FUCKIN' KEYGEN!

7) GENERATE THE FUCKIN' KEY AND COPY IT TO THE REGISTRATION.

8) STAR THE FUCKIN' GAME, AND SET IT UP.

NOTE: IF THE FUCKIN' GAME IS NOT IN ENGLISH DURING THE FUCKIN' SETTINGS SETUP (NOT THE FUCKIN' REGISTRATION!), YOU FUCKIN' DID SOME FUCKIN' THING WRONG!

Note on the Note: Again, make sure the AvatarInit.ini has the language settings set to English...

The Epilogue...
See?
That wasn't so fuckin' hard, now was it?"
,ncc46537,2010-04-30T06:53Z,"Dammit...

,chrouch,2010-05-07T21:20Z,"It's pretty obviously that when you change the  language to English, by the AvatarInit.ini, because the game is also installed in english. So the game is installed in two languages, english and russian. So if you'd like to change the language you only need to: Go to C:\program files\ubisoft\James Cameron's AVATAR - THE GAME\bin, in this folder, search for the .ini file:AvatarInit

If you don't screw up 'till here, than(when you open the file)this text will appear:

[Avatar_INIT]
language=russian(or something like that)
GameId=(alway different)

the only thing you need to do: change the word 'russian' into 'english'. Than save the file. 
If you can't save the file in the directory, just save it to (for example) desktop and copy the file to the \bin directory, overwrite the file. Than launch the AvatarLauncher file.
If you noobs don't screw up, you'll be able to play the game in english!"
,marlow_meland,2010-05-27T23:17Z,"After i've pasted the key-thingy the loading is gets stuck when its halfway done, why?"
,Paav0,2010-08-03T16:57Z,"Hai. Ive got this problem when i start the game, it says ""
unsupported render settings detected while starting the game! Loading optimal settings instead!""

What the fuck is the problem? tried to change compability etc. nothing works.
