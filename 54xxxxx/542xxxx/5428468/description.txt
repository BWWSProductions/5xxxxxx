========================================================

BEFORE:

Install Magic: The Gathering, Duels of the Planeswalkers.
Install Spells of the Ancients.
Try getting it to run with compatibility mode, which never reliably worked.
See your wizard move too fast in Shandalar. See missing cards in your deckbuilder.
See invisible text in game dialogues.
Spend hours and hours googling for solutions, and following dead links.
Finally, if you still had the time, motivation, knowledge and hard drive space,
give up and install a virtual machine, then Windows 95 or 98, then DOTP and SOTA all over again.
Be stuck with a limited selection of cards.


TODAY:

All those hassles have been obliterated with:

===========================================================

This is an updated installer for MAGIC: THE GATHERING
"Duels of the Planeswalkers/Spells of the Ancients".

It has been modified to install and play on new operating systems
such as Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.

It has been tested with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

It runs in a screen resolution of 1024 x 768.

This version includes Mok's Manalink 2.01 unofficial updates,
Smiling Spectre's Application Compatibility Fix to
correct graphics issues, and hundreds of new cards added by
the Magic The Gathering Community, released as of early March 2009!


The CD-Rom Features:
====================
A professional grade installer that allows the user full control of the installation.

A reworked Autorun Menu featuring an animated splash screen and original CD artwork and sounds.

A new Tutorial Viewer. (Sorry, it's not interactive anymore, but all the info is still there.)

All the original manuals as PDF files. These are available from the program menu and the Tutorial Viewer as well.


The Installer Features:
=======================
Installer presentation with slide show and music from the original installer.

All the original registry entries are created by the installer.

The full game is installed already patched with manalink 2.01 plus
all the latest community card packs. 

A new Magic the Gathering Launcher Application that allows for starting the
Deck Builder, Magic or Shandalar, and Character Generator directly from the Launcher.
The Manuals can also be viewed from the Launcher.

However, the BIG feature of the new installer is the fact that it automatically installs
Smiling Spectre's ACT Fix WITHOUT having to use the Application Compatibility Toolkit.

And everything still fits on a single CD-Rom disc too!


INSTRUCTIONS
============
The ISO image can be burned to disc with any CD burning program.
Alternately, you can mount the image in a virtual drive such as DAEMON TOOLS, 
Slysoft.com's Virtual Clone Drive, MagicDisk from MagicISO.com, etc.

If the installer doesn't begin, navigate to the CD and run autorun.exe.
After that it is just a simple install process (that will look VERY familiar) ;)

* - Your OS should be installed on your C drive. 

* - Do NOT Install to a long folder path!
The Application Fix does not work with long folder paths!

EXAMPLES:
---------
C:Program FilesMagicTG	     -GOOD! 

C:Program FilesMagic the Gathering -BAD! Will have issues

After installing, the Install window will pop up again.
You can install the tutorial viewer at this time.
If you don't want to do that, then close the window.

* - Be sure to update the CardArtNew images. See CardArtNew Instructions.txt.

Launch the game from the Magic TG Launcher shortcut on your desktop or
the shortcut in the Programs menu.

* - The Launcher minimizes to the system tray, and you can have more than one open
at a time, so keep an eye on it.

* - Sometimes when starting or loading a game,
the display may not "fill the screen" and the game will run
in a window in upper left corner of the screen. To correct
this, simply save, exit, then reload the game and it
should correct the issue.

* - When Starting a new Shandalar Game, it is
RECOMMENDED that you save your character's image before
proceeding, or you may not have a character at all!

To view the Tutorial, run C:Program Files (x86)MagicTGTutorial.exe or
see the shortcut in your Start/All Programs Menu.
