THE WAREHOUSE 5 [VOL 1-3] [256k MP3] ***NOT MY RIPS***

The Warehouse is the official fan association for Dave Matthews Band. Founded on December 4, 1998, Warehouse gives fan early access to concert tickets, exclusive CDs and merchandise to its members.

Starting in 1999, Warehouse club members received an annual gift package. Membership packages are mailed to members that joined or renewed in that year. After the original package in 1999, all membership packages included an exclusive Warehouse CD. All of these CDs, except for one ***(see 2001)***, are Warehouse 5 volumes and contain five live tracks from various tours. In 2003, the first Warehouse 8 volume [coming soon to TPB] was released and distributed to those who had been members for three years or more. The Warehouse 8 releases have three additional tracks.
