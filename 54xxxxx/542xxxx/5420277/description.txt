All of the twelve recordings featured on the album have Never before been
released on a CD/LP.
The songs document the pivotal time period after Electric Ladyland and before
Electric Lady Studios and the recordings made there that would later take form
as Cry Of Love and now First Rays.
Valleys Of Neptune documents the final studio recordings Jimi made in 1969 with
the original Jimi Hendrix Experience and the first efforts with new bassist Billy
Cox.
As a number of the song titles will be familiar to fans and buyers alike, the
following details the key characteristics of each of the tracks on Valleys Of
Neptune.
