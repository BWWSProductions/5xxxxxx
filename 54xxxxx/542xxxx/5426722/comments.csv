,gyaradon,2010-11-25T20:20Z,"Windows 7: don't use it myself, can't help.

Serial: anything. Just fill up the space with anything. It'll take it."
,placemat1212121,2011-01-22T00:31Z,"It won't take any serial number. It loads successfully for me, but I don't know the correct serial number to make it work!:-("
,Freacable,2011-02-06T11:08Z,"Bad Win7 krakk.
In Win7 you can run any program in compatibility mode and as  administrator. I have set the installer (msi) for Win XP sp3, and the resulting exe to the same, still it asks for a number and will output silence. Do not waste your time."
,sigur2662,2011-08-07T15:56Z,"It works!!!! When you open the program for the first time, after you replace de dll file and choose the location of the library, it ask for a serial number, just write a 1 digit number and get fun. Tested on windows 7 64 bits."
,jackson81,2011-10-12T11:53Z,has anyone got this to work with mac? typing in random stuff for the serial doesn't work. any ideas?
,snavem,2011-11-01T20:43Z,"MAC USERS

Hey guys if any of you get a ""the installer requires admin privileges to run"" error do this.


I. MOUNT the M-Tron Pro.dmg file
II. COPY the INSTALLER to your DESKTOP
III. (right click show package contents) and go to:

/String Machine/Double-Click To Install String Machine.app/Contents/Resources/

open the installscript.plist file and change the Require Admin field to FALSE.

Save the file, quit, and go back to the beginning and run the file. It will quickly prompt you for your admin password and install properly.

Worked for me."
,macmody,2012-04-04T19:58Z,to get this to work install the mac or pc if you have a mac install the mac installer for your steam if you have a pc install pc installer for your steam put the crack in your vst folder this what i did to get it to work for me window 7 32bit 
,xXAstrixxXx,2012-07-07T01:40Z,"This is garbage. The crack doesn't work, plus it always crashes Ableton. 

Don't bother. "
