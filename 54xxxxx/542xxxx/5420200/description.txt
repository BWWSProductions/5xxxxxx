They have been one of Britains favourite bands for the past 25 years,
Clocking up 50million album sales and  22 Top 10 singles.

Their massive success earned them a prestigious Brit Award for 
Outstanding Contribution To Music. 

They are the fantastic Pet Shop Boys â€“ and they have put together a 
real treat.

Pet Shop Boys Story: 25 Years Of Hits â€“ includes classic tracks such 
as West End Girls, Go West, Its A Sin and eight other great songs  
spanning their chart career.

In an exclusive interview to announce their Mail on Sunday CD, Tennant 
nd Lowe revealed that, though their wild days are over, they are still 
exploring new musical frontiers. 

The anniversary of their 25th year in the business will be marked by 
nothing more colourful than yet more hard work as they plan summer 
concerts in London and Manchester.
â€˜The party days are over,â€™ admits Lowe, 49. â€˜The wildest night Iâ€™ve been 
on recently is a trip to the opera with my mother and sister. 

By the time we had dinner it was pushing midnight.â€™ 
He added: â€˜Before we go on stage, I normally have a lie-down. Before the 
Brits, Neil had a white-wine spritzer. I had a rest.â€™
Their musical repertoire is changing, too: the Pet Shop Boys are writing a 
ballet inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen story â€“ to be performed at 
Sadlers Wells theatre in London in 2011.
