      +- Release Information -+

 The number of individual applications you need to address threats, 
 risk, and compliance is surging. ItÃ†s virtually impossible for 
 security teams to manually correlate and integrate all the data 
 needed for an effective and timely response. McAfee ePolicy 
 Orchestrator (ePO) delivers real-time information and application 
 integration for network, desktop, and server security.

 McAfee is the first to offer such a comprehensive and integrated 
 security risk management approach, and ePO is at the center of it. 
 ePO 4.5 brings you knowledge-driven security that is automated and 
 actionable, so that you make more efficient and effective threat 
 protection and compliance management decisions.

 ePO 4.5 offers new capabilities in reporting and policy assignment 
 that significantly reduce costs and increase operational 
 efficiencies:

 Access the web-based, customizable console from just about anywhere. 
 ThereÃ†s no need to install any software on your system. Dashboard-
 based custom configurable reports can be scheduled and emailed for 
 improved information sharing. Workflow enhancements, such as 
 integrated reporting across your system and network security 
 environment, helps you make more informed security decisions. 
 ePolicy Orchestrator is the industry's most popular and respected 
 security management technology used by more than 30,000 customers 
 with over 55 million desktops and servers under management. ePO 
 is an essential component of McAfee Total Protection solutions, 
 providing central management for comprehensive system protection 
 as well as for network security and compliance management.
