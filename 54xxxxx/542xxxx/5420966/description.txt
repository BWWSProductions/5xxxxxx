If you love interactive board games that challenge your brain power, then
Stratajong is the game for you. It combines strategic elements of games like
chess with a host of customizable play features and pre-rendered
3D-graphics. It takes elements from Mahjong and mixes it with Stratego.

Stratajong is easy to play, but don't let its simplicity fool you. You'll
have to think several moves ahead if you want to capture the keys you'll
need to conquer the enemy's castles. The game supports several different
modes of play, including:

* Network play, against an opponent over a LAN or the Internet.

* E-mail play, exchanging moves in e-mail messages.

* "Hot seat" play, between two players on the same machine.

* Solo play, against a computer opponent with adjustable skill levels.
