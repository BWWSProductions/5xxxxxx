SP2 was released recently. Any chance that will become available here ?"
[T],tzanev,2010-03-11T16:44Z,Thanks
,olexade,2010-03-11T21:54Z,"Thanks!
But what is the password for SDLActivKits.exe???"
,olexade,2010-03-11T22:26Z,I have got it - no need to extract - only run.
,thuerrsch,2010-04-17T15:52Z,"Thanks to all the crackers and packagers who made this! Great work!

It's certainly none of your fault that I found the experience with SDL's translation ""solutions"" so traumatic. This whole thing just shows that they simply can't do software. They took Trados, which used to be a nice little kluge, not without its problems, but surprisingly useful, sodomized it in the most brutal ways imaginable, threw in a bunch of less successfull competitors they found in some garbage can, and turned the whole thing into a gigantic steaming pile of shit. Just installing the whole bundle will take hours and require literally over a hundred mouse clicks, putting, amoung dozens of other components with lofty names, a record of two Java runtime environments on your hard disk, both outdated and insecure, of course, neither serving any real useful purpose. There are endless hierarchies of assisstants, managers, and control centers that make the Soviet state bureaucracy look lean and efficient by comparison. 
If this was a car, it would have 19 wheels of different shapes and sizes, 5 steering wheels, 3 engines, each broken in its own way, the miles per gallon of a Sherman tank and a GPS system directly controlled by the Iranian secret service.

It's so horrible that I can see only one way out of this: SDL should open-source the entire Trados suite under the GPL and let the free software community make something useful out of it, if that's still possible. Then they should quit the software business once and for all and be what they've always been, a translation agency.

Hopefully this cracked release will cost them lots of license sales and in this way help to accelerate SDL's long overdue demise as a software vendor. So thanks again to the guys who did this for helping make the translation world a better place! 
"
[T],tzanev,2010-04-20T19:48Z,"@thuerrsch

Hear, hear. But what to do when most translation agencies require Trados for large projects and backward compatibility is yet another problem of the most bloated bloatware I have ever come across. All I ever use is TagEditor, Translator's Workbench and MultiTerm - I don't even know what the other applications do. However, spending 30-40 min. to install this is still far better than paying whatever ridiculous price SDL are asking for this package."

,jackson16,2010-04-25T14:01Z,"Hi - does the Trados 2007 sill rely on the MAC address change?

Also, when I go to License Manager under ""installed licenses"" I get three licenses - 1 expiring 21 March 2011, 1 expiring 14 April 2010 and 1 expiring 25 May 2010.  All trial.  the 25 May is the one related to this latest install (30 days??).  How do I delete the one dated 14 April.  When I try to run workbench with a word file and click on ""open/get"" in Word it says ""workbench is not running"" eve though it is.  I think related to Apil 14, 2010 date?

Any help appreciated!"
,jackson16,2010-04-25T14:05Z,"When I test the license under ""SDL license manager"" - ""license file locations"" it says ""The signatire of the license is corrupt"".

Any one else get this problem?"
,jackson16,2010-04-25T18:29Z,"Hi, managed to deleted the other references to licenses by deleting trados related registry components.

But, I still get the error that """"workbench is not running"" when I try to access it from MS Word.  Yet, it is running - or at least open...

Please let me know thoughts."
,jackson16,2010-05-01T16:51Z,Hi - works great.  had to install in adminstrator account though.  Solved currupt license issue by downloading whole torrent again.  Thanks.

,Buckley94,2010-05-03T11:41Z,"Thanks for the upload! I am so sorry to be a pain but I really struggle to get it right. I am not a savvy computer person and would really really appreciate a step by step simple installing instruction if possible?? I have tried 3 times now getting it right but Im doing something wrong. Don't know what a patch is, what dongle to untick and how not to install Passolo as its just doing it autimatically. I also got a Trojan Hourse threat the two last times I've downloaded the bundle and opened aktivkits. Don't know what to do! It means a lot to me to get this intalled and ready to use asap. There's no way I can afford ÂŁ800 software. What a rip off! Again, thanks for this, it clearly works according to everyone! Cheers, Buckley "

Thank you so much"
,funky_qwerty,2010-06-05T10:46Z,"Thanks very much to the uploader.  This works (at least the 2007 part of the bundle I've installed). Of course, it still has bugs, but that's a problem with Trados in general, not just this upload. For instance, I can't clean up Word 2007 and have to do it with Wordfast. Anyway, during installation of Passolo, don't forget  - ""make sure you deselect the check box next to the option to install the dongle driver. Then use vnekrilov's patch to activate the application. If Trados Studio 2009 SP1 tries to install Passolo Essentials, cancel it""

@ thuerrsch - amen. and thanks for a good laugh."
,kermit123,2010-07-12T21:35Z,"Like Buckley94, I think I would have needed more detailed instructions to get this working. I installed Trados 2007, ran ActiveKits (although I am not sure it patched the right files), and pointed the license manager to the license. License Manager says everything is OK, but the applications run in demo mode."
,kermit123,2010-07-12T22:35Z,"Like Buckley94, I could have used more detailed instructions. I installed SDL 2007, ran ActiveKits (although I am not sure it patched the right files) and browsed to the license file.

,Maja_K,2010-07-20T13:19Z,"Could anyone please tell me how to do the part ""If Trados Studio 2009 SP1 tries to install Passolo Essentials, cancel it""?

Thank you! "
,kater-acme,2010-08-30T07:30Z,"Hi all.
1 - a big thank you to all uploaders, hack makers and seeders for this release - saved me a lot of $$$

2 - I just installed yesterday, started it a few times, didn't open or create any projects, BUT the soft seems to work OK - after installing the whole suite and applying patches it starts fine, allows me to navigate etc. and will not ask for license key anymore etc.

3 - granted, I haven't worked with this release for a long time so cannot comment on any issues or instabilities, but so far so good

4 - installation was easy, the only thing that took me a while was to find proper directories with the original soft to apply the patch - the patch by default wants to patch wrong directories and would (in my case) warn me that some ""tradosbasis.dll was missing""

5 - one otehr problem I had was that once the patcher warned that some ""English interface was missing"" but it seems it was just a notice and the soft works OK anyway

6 - have not tried SP2 yet but definitely will and when I do, I'll report

7 - if sbd decides that they are knowledgeable enough and willing to share their exp on this, it will be most welcome as there are many Q's out there, and a short walkthru would be a treat"
,aTurro,2010-11-18T15:39Z,"Hi, so how do you cancel the installation of Passolo Essentials? I can't find any such option? "
,aTurro,2010-11-18T16:33Z,"OK, I hit CANCELL when it started installing Passolo with Trados 2009, and it skiped to installing next item. I installed Passolo with the Trados 2007 AND there was an option box for the dongle. I unselected it. However, when I try to patch the Passolo with vnekrilov's patch it says that SDL app is running (it isn't). Anyone any idea?"

,jackson16,2011-01-11T18:17Z,"Hi - trying to install this on another computer. I must not be directing the patches correctly as keeps saying it is in trial mode.

A few Questions:

- when exactly should I point the license - as soon as studio installes it asked for licence - do I point it at that point already before patching?  Or cancel the license direction, patch all programmes then startup trados (workbench for example) and point the license?
 - where to patch trados 2007?  In the final ""TT"" directory under ""SDL International""?
 - multiterm cannot seem to find the ""LicenseConsole.exe"" even though it is in the directory ""multiterm8"".
 - I also show 3 license in the license manager - 2 of which are trial - how to get rid of the other 2?
 - how to ""de-register SDLX"" so I can uninstall it.

Help very appreciated!"

,hederek,2011-01-29T02:16Z,"I hope this comment will help to others. I have downloaded Trados 7 on win 7  and I think I succesfully made it work. this is what I did:

-First I installed Trados 7
-When it was passola time, as suggested I unchecked dongle
-When all is downloaded, I closed everything and this time I run SDL activekit. And click Trados 2007
-Than I browsed to program files (Where SDL2007 was also downloaded) and downloaded it there
-Following, I manully went to program files, clicked SDL International file and than clicked T2007-and than TT
-Within that file found licenceconsole and chose the licence included with the package

that is all

The program does not run in demo but as version 8. So I think it worked. "

Now I did rolback via system restore and I'll try the process again. Because it is important for me to have some product from trados 2007 too, like winalign. Thank you for help (One more questuion.

,gajaba,2011-03-11T18:52Z,"OK, here are my experiences and suggestions.
I've done it on WIndows 7 SP1. 
At first I didnt succed, than I did system restore (because I couldnt uninstall it without ""de-registering (!?)), and than I succeded in second try.
Here si how I done it. 
Firstly install Trados 2007 suite from here, read all comments (program OpenVPN can help you  and follow all instructions from the torrent howto.txt file) 
Than instal Trados 2009 studio from this torrent and Multiterm. Than patch both with SDL Activation Kits program you have in this torrent. Activate just 2009 roducts with that kit. 
And thats it. 
The final result is that when I go to Help -> About... nowhere (207 nor 2009) I dont have any trial version mentioned. I hope it'll work after 1 or two month, I dont see why not. I think I patcehdit pretty well and all si working fine. First tiem I couldnt make 2007 Suite advance from trial mode... It was stuck on trial mode. "

Where do you have to go with the activations programs, i mean what do you have to select? And what do you do first, use the included licence or do the patching?

,cedrik1408,2011-10-15T23:21Z,"Hey, i had a hard time making this work but i finally did it, here are the stepts.

TESTED on WIndows XP 32 bit

-you don't need to back up your hard or anything, just delete the first instalation if it didn't work and try again.

1. You need the following :
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5526687/SDL_Trados_Studio_2009_SP2_activation

2. follow the exact steps in the instructions from the current torrent, even the patching.
( trados 2007 and passolo 2009 work but trados 2009 required the patch from the current torrent )

3. After installing the suite in this order : 

3.1 SDL trados 2007 suite 
3.2 SDL traods 2009 
3.3 SDL Multiterm 2009.
( passolo is included and other info for installing are in the instructions.text ) 

4. Patch them in the same order
5. If you followed the previous steps correctly, DON'T RUN TRADOS 2009, the first time it may start but it is a trial and will expire soon enough, instead use the files from the link above and apply the patch over the other patch.

6. To apply this patch copy the Licence folder in C:\Program Files\SDL\SDL Trados Studio\Studio1\  
6.1 copy the files from D:\download\SDL Trados Studio 2009 SP2 activation\SDL Trados Studio 2009 SP2 activation\SDL.Trados.Studio.2009.SP2\patch   
and run them according to the instructions. 
6.2 Do the same for multiterm even if it shows it is already patched just to be sure.

READY to Go , hope it works for you."
,alkyone9,2012-02-27T18:40Z,"I just installed this, took me a long time, but I followed instructions to the letter. 

It went like this:
- The torrent downloaded automatically in a folder named SDLBundle2009 (in MyDocuments/Downloads)
- I double clicked SDLTrados2009DVD and I got an installation window, where I chose to install, with the following order:
1. SDL Trados 2007
2. Microsoft Net framework
3. SDL Trados Studio 2009
4. SDL Trados Multiterm 2009
I did not install the Release Notes, nor the SDL FLEX License Server. 

Trados opens all right, but is asks for a licence every time, and I point to it every time. I don' t mind that, but is it supposed to be like that?

Then I double clicked SDLActivKits and I immediately got a Trojan horse alert, so I quit the installation. 

Is this normal? Should I ignore the warning? Is there anything else I should do?"
,8karu,2012-04-03T17:54Z,anybody who had the tradosBasis.dll problem during patching... - just change the directory when the activation offers it to the correct one(where the actual tradosbasis.dll is. So first find that in your system it must be there after the install
,Miss. M,2012-04-08T22:21Z,"Is the license file only valid for Trados 2007? It works on that but when I try to run Trados Studio 2009 it asks me if I want to buy the product or add a license key and I click the latter option and then ""Use a local license file"" and directs it to the license.lic file and it says ""Congratulations you have succesfully activated your product"" but when it tries to run again it says ""You should have a valid license to run SDL Trados Studio 2009"". What am I doing wrong?"
,opukaj,2012-04-10T04:56Z,"For all of you with problems getting Trados 2007 to register (especially on Windows 7 64 bit), read this carefully. When everything is installed and you are using the SDLActivKits.exe, be careful which folders it chooses: check whether the programs have been installed in Program Files or in Program Files (x86). The  SDLActivKits.exe picked all the correct folders in my case. 

Do NOT manually point the SDLActivKits.exe to your T2007TT folder! Leave the default folder that it displays (C:Program Files (x86)SDL International in my case) and have it install in there. The activation kit for Trados 2007 seems a bit bugged, as it will automatically suffix the T2007TT part even if it seems like it's not pointing to there; the files will be written in the correct TT subfolder nonetheless.

I found out about this after 6 hours of having all 2009 programs licensed fully, but only 2007 wouldn't work. I had tried to re-run the activation kit about five times and then noticed I had 5 separate ""SDL International"" subfolders in random places through Program Files. This made me realize that the activation kit tries to create these two subfolders if it doesn't see them already existing, which is only the case if you leave it pointing to Program FilesSDL International."
,opukaj,2012-04-10T05:00Z,"In other words, when running SDLActivKits.exe for patching Trados 2007, leave it pointing to C:/Program Files/SDL International. Do not add the subfolder T2007/TT manually, as the activator will do that on its own."
,conrad99,2012-05-14T19:30Z,"I have installed the program and it works fine. 
There's only one problem. When I try to open this type of file: software.sdltb (a termbase) Trados gives this error message:

""This termbase cannot be opened because it has been created with a newer version of MultiTerm. Consider updating your installation.""

But the option to upgrade the software has somehow been disabled. The help-menu gives me the following answer:

""If this option is unavailable for editing, your system administrator has set up a group policy enabling or disabling checks for automatic updates. For more information about group policies, see the SDL Trados Studio 2009 Installation Guide.""

I have read a couple of manuels, but I have not found the solution. I did find a installation guide for trados 2011 which tells me to configure a file named Studio2AutoUpdate.adm in order to define the group policy, but I have trados 2009 and I can't find any file of this sort. 

Does anyone know what to do?
thx"
