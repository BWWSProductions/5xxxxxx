You wouldn't watch a movie on a crappy 14 inch television, so why would you listen to an album like this?! 
I'm sure many people would would otherwise love to dl these albums aren't going to since they're lossy. If you have the albums, could you upload them at a higher kbps, please? It'd be much appreciated!"
