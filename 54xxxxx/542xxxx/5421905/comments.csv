Here we have a very interesting little Mac app that weighs in at a WHOPPING 800k, and our intrepid poster is no longer seeding it - less than 24 hours after initial release.

Check out your up MacStockManager. Even after K it is still limited and says trial version.
Thanks."

I'm always seeding...
If the TPB tracker shows no seeders, that's not my problem! "

I nabbed the share off of MSJ, as I suspected you may have posted it there.  Good guess.  Thanks!"
