Product Description:
ServerBar is designed for those that need to keep an eye on one or more UNIX based computers (e.g., Mac OS X, Linux, or OpenBSD) from their desktop. If you're running a web service, a computation cluster, you want to check your home server is well whilst you're at work, or all of the above at once!
It works over ssh, so there's no need to install any software on the remote machine - you just need to login via ServerBar and it will monitor the CPU load and memory statistics on each machine, keeping you constantly up to date. You can see what the recent history is, and you'll be alerted the moment ServerBar has any connectivity difficulties, allowing you to react quickly.

Features:
--> Keep an eye on the CPU Load, physical memory, and swap usage on your servers.
--> Monitor as many machines as you like.
--> Customizable orientation, sizing, and colors - designed to fit in with your desktop.
--> Uses standard UNIX technologies so no need to install anything on remote server.
--> Based on Secure Shell and Keychain, so all information is kept secure.
--> Immediate alerts when connectivity drops.
--> Click on any graph to see details, or double click to launch a terminal on that server.
