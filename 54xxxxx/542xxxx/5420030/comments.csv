,sanusiad,2010-03-23T10:20Z,"Can someone tell me why the background audio is louder than the dialog? 

For your information, I'm using K-Lite Codec 5.8.3 and i've tried winamp, media player classic, and windows media player 10; all give the same results. I used on-board speaker on my laptop and the soundcard that i have is a standard sound card. 

What codec or program should i use so i can get a clear dialog voice? Thanks a lot for your help guys. "
