I went to see this film when i was in rehab' for Alcoholism back in 2000.
(Still don't  use/abuse that destructive drug, 10 years on April 7th, best thing i did in my life, giving up Alcohol.)

While my problems were obsessive addiction to Alcohol and not really having issues with other drugs, i can choose to take and choose to stop nearly everything else except Crack, which i won't touch with a bargepole but quite partial to Coke leaf, impossible for me to addict to heroin, know my limits with stim's, weed isn't a problem, ever.

But i know many people do have real problems with some drugs other than the legal Alcohol.

This is an excellent film showing consequences of illicit drugs and prescription stim's, the avenues use takes each character into, the co-enabling, worsening circumstances etc.

very well filmed and if you know somebody in rehab', this is a good film to show them, if you watch this and see similarities, it's time for you to get into rehab'.

Girl i took to the cinema, also in rehab', was in denial about her Crack use and other drugs until she ended up freaked out by some elements of the film which broke through her idealism's of that dimension of her problems, sort of locked them away and focused on Alcohol as being primary substance problem, she opened up a lot to me, then in group and it helped her immensely.

Great film and not to be sneered at, analysed properly, most substance recreators will see exactly what Darren Aronofsky gets at and how it relates to them if one is honest, if some things aren't manifest yet in your lives, they will be.

Nothing wrong with alternative recreation but keep it real, once you start losing control of them and they control you, time to give it a rest or give up completely, all the usual signs etc are visible in this film, it's a work of art this film and a must see for every substance user as food for thought regards possible future consequences.


Peace. :)

I dont know anything about drugs but what you wrote sounds very valuable and honorable....Thank you"

I'd watch this movie and really pay attention. Can't say it stopped me, tho. hopefully it'll stop somebody."
