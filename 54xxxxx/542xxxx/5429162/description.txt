           It's 1955, and troublemaker Laurent finds himself at a         
           Belgian boarding school, where a teacher there recognizes      
           his intelligence and encourages him to write. As               
           Laurent's talent develops, he adopts his inspiring             
           teacher as a father figure, while at the same time             
           wondering about his real father, who disappeared during        
           the war. As Laurent investigates the past, he is forced        
           to confront his present.
