Eccleston really stamped his remarkable acting talent on this piece!
And what a piece! "

I think this is british TV drama at its finest. It's right up there with Barry Hine's 'Threads' and Alan Bleasdale's 'Boys From The Blackstuff'. It's not perfect, it could have benefitted from a lengthier script, but it's more interesting, thought provoking and entertaining than 99% of the feeble dross (mostly U.S. dross) that gets TV/advertising execs and other assorted morons so aroused."
