,leevi1974,2010-03-10T15:02Z,Is it just me or is this video kind of choppy and the audio is out of sync throughout the whole file?
,heavyen,2010-03-10T22:20Z,"choppy video and audio out of sync, avoid. also fuck off eztv for uploading a shitty file."
,leevi1974,2010-03-11T14:27Z,strangely this is the only 720p release :( sucks
,gazzi0,2010-03-12T10:19Z,"PERFECT FILE!! If audio is choppy to you it's because you have a shitty computer who is unable to playback a HD file smoothly. Watched the entire episode with subs PERFECTLY, with no problems at all!! A10/V10"
,Eizo47,2010-03-15T21:57Z,Thx
,Toistinen,2010-03-16T23:58Z,"Damn it, this file is stuttering and the audio really is out of sync a little. Plus, the Dolby Digital audio sounds like it's been dynamically compressed at some point.

Do not try to blame my PC for this; I played an HD episode of House right after this one (encoded with the same codec and embedded with an AC3 audio track) and it didn't chop frames off!

What's wrong with the latest HD episodes of Lost people? Goddamn it."
