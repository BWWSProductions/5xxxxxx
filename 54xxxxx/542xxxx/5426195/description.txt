So I have uploaded this again, this time I was able to make it a smaller file size, and not loose any quality (which is a bonus because the movie was ripped from a chinese vcd). The film is in manderin, and does NOT have subtitles, so if someone could PLEASE translate that would be awsome.

This is a spy movie from North Korea (1965), if you look on wiki it mentions a movie, I have a feeling this is that movie.

PLEASE SEED THIS!!!
