[V],sparkster22222,2010-03-18T17:35Z,Thank you :)
,slurpent,2010-06-10T09:09Z,"@rob9099:
I myself only have three episodes from season 5, so you're right, they are hard to find and not on any DVD release.  Not sure whether or not I'd bother seeding and posting them, since I'm a completionist and they really aren't that good compared to seasons 1 and 2."
,diabolic_scheme,2011-03-31T06:59Z,Fuckin eh.. ill seed this for a long time
,iTryWayyTooHard,2011-04-24T06:31Z,i love you for this

WHAT THE HELL?!

Apart from THAT, great torrent! I miss this show so much, I just wish I could enjoy every episode in the same glory as I used to, not with voices in the background I can't even understand. It's worse than the guy sitting behind you in the movie theater talking on his phone."
,AmandaJeanVt,2011-06-29T02:42Z,Seed this shit people!!!  I wanna watch it today not tomorrow! 
,VinBoy,2011-08-10T06:03Z,"I love this show, Fuck Spike for not showing this on tv no more"
,voodoo797,2011-08-13T22:46Z,"please seed, 12kbs"
,stangace,2011-08-15T08:31Z,"I know at least one person who is seeding has a really good rate.

I've been downloading this for 4hrs and I'm about 70% complete w/ the DL rate between 700k-1.2MB/s

Problem is that person does not seed quite enough.  I got to 30% last night before they quit.

Tonight I was an hour away from being done (currently on 65%), but the person w/ the good rate apparently quit for the night or something
(which is why I think it's one person) 

And once they do the rate immediately takes a nosedive. I'm lucky if I can keep 100-150kb/s absolute max.

Hopefully if I get it done, I can help fix that, but that's gonna take another day at least"

is that additional or alternative? is the original audio still there?"
,alck,2011-09-01T06:27Z,for the love of all that is holy SEED
,rob90991,2011-09-21T15:48Z,"A pledge to all fans of this series:
Season 5 has unlike the rest of the series not been released on dvd.
ROGUe has made releases of the whole season 5 capped from PDTV.
If anybody can get ahold on these releases or even cap the episodes from tv themselves would be awesome and the series would be complete. I have scoured the web and have been unable to obtain these episodes and also there is some mislabeling so watch out.
                    Thanks."
