Wii Karaoke Joysound DX ISO. NTSC-J

includes 70 new songs.

Not much info the NFO so it really isn't worth reprinting.  If you really need to see the NFO, check gbatemp.

Works fine on my 4.2J with D2pro on a standard dvd-r.  

Haven't tried usbloader, so you'll have to try that on your own.
