What's with all the fucking rar's?!!!

I mean, Fuck shit man! Am I supposed to keep one copy for watching AND hold on to ANOTHER spanned volume copy just to fucking seed?

Sure, why not? I mean, after all, my disk space is FUCKING INFINITE after all...isn't it? What?! It's not?! Really?!! Well, then...fuck me! 

I MIGHT not be seeding after I grab this...just an FYI."
