                    Wedding bells are in the air on the estate, a  
                    little too frequently for the police, as the  
                    Maguires exploit a new money-making scheme.  
                    Business turns to pleasure when Shane asks  
                    Kelly to marry him, but his dream turns into a  
                    nightmare when she turns him down. As his life  
                    unravels, Shane uncovers a terrible betrayal by  
                    those closest to him and must suffer for the  
                    sins of his father. Hitting rock-bottom, he  
                    finds the strength to make an important  
                    decision. Now Libby and her mother are firmly  
                    nestled in the Gallagher house, Frank    
                    volunteers to paint Patty's newly converted  
                    bedroom. In the pursuit of a bargain, Frank  
                    falls and feigns injury, leading to a    
                    potentially disastrous face-off between him and  
                    Patty. Elsewhere, Chesney holds a house party  
                    to get close to Sammy, but a promise turns to a  
                    threat when blood is spilt, leading to awful  
                    consequences for him and Carl.
