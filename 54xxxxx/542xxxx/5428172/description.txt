===========================================



DVD Info :
==========
Video : NTSC 16/9
Compression : 3,7mbps avg !
Source : Avatar 2009 DVDScr H264 AAC-SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release)
Subs : Yes, NL SecretMyth (selectable)
Audio : 2.0DD (192kbps), 5.1DD (448kbps) en DTS (768kbps)
Menu : Yes, Retail style (Main, 3x Chapters, Settings, All with BG Sound)




Audio Info :
============
The surround sound is made with a Dolby Prologic II (movie) encoder which converts the original 2.0AAC to 6 channels.
The level of all 6 channels is afterwards fine-tuned to improve the surround sound to its maximum.
This all is made to a multi wav with a bitrate of 4608kbps which is about 5gB!

The L/R right speakers have a good channel separation.
The Center speaker is mainly used for the dialogs !
The Rear surround speakers are used for special surround affect and will sound clearly with the music.
The LFE is fine modulated and will add sufficient Bass !

This multi wav is there after Encoded using the Sony SoundForge Dolby Digital Encoder and the DTS Master Audio Encoder.
The final result is really great although it will never be as an original "discreet" surround track.
Nevertheless it will sounds really good and most people will classify it as "perfect" !!
My favorite audio track is 5.1DD since this track has a more fine bass.
Still I know that DTS fanatics will prefer the DTS track.

P.S. I have compared also other Avatar 5.1DD sounds however these do not sound as good is this one. The levels are not optimised and no dialog filtering is being used !




Frame Rate :
============
The frame rate of the DVD is 29,97fps.
Also the DVD-Screener and the source of this Custom DVD where both 29,97fps and therefore no additional jitter is introduced.

P.S. An other popular Avatar DVD-5 version has a PAL framerate and this will add some unnessary jitter !




Overall :
=========
The video and audio quality are both very good.
Furthermore the menu is really nice, just like retail.

P.S. I have checked most Avatar DVD versions and this one is the best up till now !




Note :
======
If you want to burn it on a DVD5 or DVD9 please read the nfo or txt files.
Checking your dvd-files using the sfv file is recommended !




Again : Do NOT forget to remove the earlier version from your Torrent Client
Delete only the .torrent, keep the data files !
Then start this FINAL version with the corrected vts_01_1.vob !!



Please don't hit and run.
Keep seeding !!!
