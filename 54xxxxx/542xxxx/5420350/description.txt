They were the most stylish band of the 1970s and 80s - and Bryan Ferry 
was their iconic frontman.

With ice-cool singer Bryan Ferry, a string of unforgettable hits and a 
ground-breaking style all of their own, Roxy Music were one of the most 
influential bands of the Seventies and early Eighties.

Thirty + years on, and their instantly recognisable tracks such as 
Love Is The Drug and Angel Eyes are lauded as modern classics.

This is a superb collectors item that will appeal to music lovers of all 
ages, offering a unique anthology of the bandâ€™s ten years at the top of 
the charts.

Each song â€“ from the hypnotic Virginia Plain (the single released after 
the success of their first album in 1972) to the sensual Avalon 
(from the 1982 album of the same name) â€“ sounds as fresh and slick today 
as when it was first released.

Roxy Music attracted legions of fans due to their fascination with fashion, 
cinema, pop art and the avant-garde, which separated them from their 
contemporaries. Dressed in bizarre yet stylish costumes, the group offered 
a defiantly experimental type of rock.

They were one of the first bands to create and maintain a carefully crafted 
style that encapsulated their stage presentation, videos and record sleeves.

And they were a significant influence on new wave music and the experimental 
electronic groups of the early 1980s.
Bands such as Duran Duran, The Smiths and U2 have all admitted to being 
influenced by them.
 
Over the years, their popularity and reputation have remained strikingly 
consistent. 
Rolling Stone magazine recently ranked Roxy Music in its list of the 100 
Greatest Artists of All Time.

Ferry, the son of a North-East coal miner, wrote most of the songs. 
But the bands sound was also hugely influenced by co-founder Brian Eno, who 
went on to become one of the most significant record producers of the late 
20th Century, working with bands such as Talking Heads, U2 and Coldplay.

Other members include saxophonist Andrew Mackay, drummer Paul Thompson and 
guitarist Phil Manzanera.
