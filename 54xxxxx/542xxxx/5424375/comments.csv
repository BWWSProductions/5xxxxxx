,martialis,2010-03-12T01:02Z,"As of now, on IMDB the movie has less than 5 votes, and therefore no rating."
,martialis,2010-03-12T01:05Z,"also, willywonka, thanks for shitting up the thread with illiterate racism"

,g0d,2010-03-12T17:25Z,"hey, all the haters of dictatorships and whatnot... i'm american and it's pretty obvious that our democracy has been on the verge of epic fail for 30 years or so. Get a law passed without resorting to lobbyists. Go ahead, I dare you.

The thing about communism and fascism that was good was at least there wasn't overly much bureaucracy. Why is 'this law' in place? Cause 'that guy' says so. Got a problem? Ask 'that guy' to change it. Of course, change is near impossible in that system, but at least it's logical.

I'm not downing on america, governement is organic, and should evolve. I just think people should stop being spoon fed self-righteousness in grade school. Just embrace that government is allowed to change, and realize there's no need for america to BE no. 1. Who are we being no. 1 for? In the long run, it kills us to try to put so much good face to the world. We're gonna piss some people off eventually. But in the end, they'll still come for our music, movies and microcode. Just relax. Don't get all bent out of shape cause someone criticizes your government. They may just be trying to wake you up to the truth.

-Sorry, i have no idea about the movie guys. sounds horrible however."

,NiceStick,2010-03-12T23:49Z,"Fucking islamist should only die, there is NO  arabic state with democracy - ERGO - if they have problems: stay in home country. If they would like to move there problem outside, then we visit there home country, just to put thing straigth. All muslims are not terrorists - but almost all terrrorists are muslims. So if you kill one you do the world a favour!!!"
,AscorbicBloggs,2010-03-13T07:30Z,"NiceStick, ""All Muslims are not terrorists - but almost all terrorists are Muslims"".  Don't you get tired of repeating what others say?

Use your brain for once and think back to the 80s. If you were taking the tube in London, or sitting in a bar having a beer and got blown up, was that down to Irish Muslim terrorists?

Should the US have bombed Northern Ireland as a result and converted all the ""Irish Muslims"" to gospel-singing Christians?

Democracy is just a word.  It doesn't mean anything.  Unless you think when you're given the choice of two or three candidates for president, and each of those spent millions in their race for office, that this is actual democracy with true freedom of choice?

Does your naivety extend to believing that the US knows best and has the given right to force its beliefs and values on the rest of the world... and this is what you mean by number 1?

I am Christian. I empathise, sympathise and am extremely embarrassed about what was done to the Palestinians, as do most of the brain-endowed people I know. I also completely agree with everything said by Piid.

Ignorant narrow minded people like NiceStick have absolutely nothing to contribute to the world. Way to go Einstein!"

,dlarrym1111,2010-10-01T05:41Z,"Is this the chick flick comedy or the story of a German man during the onset of WW2. He has children to take care of, his wife is a narcissist and basically his life is hell. It' premiered at a film festival and is already released on DVD. Its major theatrical release is in December this year (2010). If this isn't that film, I do not want to waste band width. I feel the description may be wrong because the only description of any movie named GOOD at IMDB is the Chick flick comedy. Having said that, I wonder why this movie's comment boxes are all about a bunch of pissed off MFers screaming about everything but the movie plot, its quality or anything about the movie. WHAT the FUCK. can anyone stop the shit throwing contest and post a comment about the movie.!!!!"
