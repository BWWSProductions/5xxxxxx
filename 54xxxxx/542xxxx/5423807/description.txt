The man they call 'Britainâ€™s Funniest Milton', Milton Jones, stars in his own sitcom set in a house which Milton shares with his long-suffering sister Susan (played by Olivia Colman ("Mitchell & Webb"))and her slightly useless husband Ian. Above them is the houseâ€™s owner, their daffy Aunt Dilys (played by Rosemary Leach) and below them, in the basement, lives the ever-smooth ever-competent Anton (Tom Goodman-Hill ('The Office', 'Spamalot')).

In the first episode, itâ€™s time to decorate! The carpet hasnâ€™t been changed since the Sixties and thereâ€™s big holes in it - probably where someone dropped a lot of acid. And Milton discovers that "Hint Of Apricot" is a paint colour not a flavour of yoghurt. Doesnâ€™t stop him having three bowls though... Episode 2 and Susan & Ian are going on a second honeymoon - thatâ€™s if they can get Milton out of the boot of their car. And in the third episode, Susan & Ian are planning an intimate dinner party for a few friends. "Of course, the guests can always eat nibbles..." - but unfortunately, Nibbles is the name of Miltonâ€™s hamster. Episode 4, and Milton discovers a strange kink in his bloodline which means heâ€™s the rightful Duke of Eastern Wales. Heâ€™s also given the keys to the city of Wrexham, mainly because no-one else wants them. Episode 5, and a bar of gold, a power drill and a pancake alarm combine confusingly as Milton accidentally holds up a bank and ends up on trial for his very freedom. If only he could stop giggling at the fact that the judge is secretly wearing a wig... And in the final episode, Milton tries to organize a party for his nephews, and somehow gets tangled up with a stampeding rhino, and a skywriting Spitfire...

"Milton Jones is one of Britainâ€™s best gagsmiths with a flair for creating daft yet perfect one-liners." (The Guardian.)
