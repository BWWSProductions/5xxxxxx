i'd also like to announce that i just got a blu-ray drive for my pc, so 1080p concerts will be coming soon!

first up:
Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock Blu-Ray 1080p"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-03-15T22:10Z,"So if anyone read the last post, the Blu-Ray concerts are gonna be in 720p, just to save time. Once tpb is back up there will be:

Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock 1969
Rush: Snakes & Arrows (Live in Holland) 2007
Led Zeppelin: The Song Remains The Same 1976
ACDC: Live at Donington 1992

All the files are between 5-7 gigs, so very little if no quality loss to the video, audio is untouched (of course)

Hopefully I can get these out quickly, but i need everyone to seed please :D"
