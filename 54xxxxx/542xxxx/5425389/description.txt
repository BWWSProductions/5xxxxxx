Adam and the Ants were a British rock band active during the late 
1970s and early 1980s, they were one of the bands at the time that 
marked the transition from the 70s punk rock era to the New Wave/
post-punk era. 

Immensely popular in their time, they scored 11 UK hit singles 
between 1979 and 1982, including six top four singles (two of which 
were UKNumber 1 hits). 

Their style was quite original and especially notable for their 
double-drum sound. 

At the height of their popularity, their success was boosted by 
maginative and flamboyant music videos, which included 18th century
styles and pantomime pastiche.
 
This is particularly evident in the videos made for their biggest two 
hits during 1981 ("Stand and Deliver" and "Prince Charming"). 

The bands fashion sense and lyrics often exemplified this fun 
historical angle.
