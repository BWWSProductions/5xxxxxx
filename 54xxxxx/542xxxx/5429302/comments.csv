[V],meech,2010-03-28T00:42Z,"Glad you like it.  Like I said in the description, I am a huge Star Trek fan and was disappointed when I couldn't find any high quality rips out there.  I just bought a computer with the new i7 processor, so I can turn all the settings and bells and whistles up on the encoder without it taking forever to encode.  That along with a good denoiser filter...thus the high quality."
[V],meech,2010-03-28T00:43Z,"I unfortunately lost some of my recent dvd rips to a hard drive format.  Otherwise season 4 would've been posted by now.  I'm only missing 2 episodes.  Will be ripping them shortly, so season 4 should be up sometime next week.  And then the lst 3 seasons should follow on a pretty regular schedule."
[V],meech,2010-03-28T00:45Z,"typo on last comment.  Should say ""last"" 3 seasons...not lst :-)"
