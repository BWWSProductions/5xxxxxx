I looked around the torrent sites and couldn't find too many high quality rips of this, one of my favorite shows.  And I don't believe any include optional subtitles.

So I ripped these for myself and thought some might want to share in the enjoyment.  The file sizes are large (550mb) because I made them to stream to my 50-inch LCD.  While the quality is high, keep in mind that the source dvd's are not the greatest. I did however do my best to clean up the picture and these look great on my 50-inch LCD.  If you don't care about space (which you shouldn't with the cheap price of hard drive space), then these are for you.  My goal was to maintain a high quality and keep the entire series under 100gb.  I am working on the entire series.  The ripping and subtitles are a lot of work.  But if there is an interest in this torrent, I will continue to post the other seasons as well, as they get done.

Please seed when you are done...I good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded...thanks!!


p.s. ATT PS3 MEDIA SERVER (which I use for these) USERS : Make sure to disable ASS/SSA Subtitles.  Also if using MEncoder, if you have problems with audio sync, try unchecking AV/Sync Alternative Method.
