The Special Goodness
Land Air Sea
Epitaph Records

Pat Wilson isn't just a drummer. Most Weezer fans know that: the Special Goodness is his band, and has put out a few records over the years, the first of which I think is a freakin' awesome record. The band's newest album, Land Air Sea, has been out for about a year now, but has now been released under Epitaph and remastered.

Wilson is a really good guitarist, and his songwriting isn't shabby either. Songs like the single "Life Goes By" perfectly showcases this: very catchy, yet very precise. Wilson definitely has an ear for melody, and for good guitar crunch. He perfectly melds pop and rock into a very distinct sounding record.

"Day In the Autumn," is a slower, though more powerful song that kind of swings back and forth in melody. Atom Willard's drums are potent, and give a deep and controlled wallop to the beat. "NFA" is a fun song that has interesting breaks and switches from verse to chorus.

There are a few "older" songs on the record as well; a perfect example is "Pay No Mind." Though from SG's first, this is a newer, fuller version and stands out well as the album's closer. Wilson uses great skill in his solos and bridges, and his voice is definitely unique.

Land Air Sea is by far a solid record. Patrick Wilson, along with his buddy Atom, has made a collection of well crafted, meaningful songs that say something and are fun all at once. It's kind of rare these days to hear a record like this. The care taken, the overall goodness is, wellâ€¦ ok, I have to say it, "special."
