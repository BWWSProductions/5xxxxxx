,leave_th_room,2010-03-09T12:24Z,"Hi tanauser, i was eagerly awaiting for this, i downloaded the 29dlc4free too. These EUE are working fine in battle, but in grand campaign you CANT recruit most of them. You can recruit hayduit irregulars, circassian cavalry from ankara, and mounted nizams, and organ artillery. But bosnian , armenian archers, palestinian auxillary, libyan kolugu, and others, they are missing, you can check by going to their respective cities, and click on building tab and right click on the military academy, these units are missing. Hope you will fix it, im putting my campaign on hold.thanks"
[T],Tanauser,2010-03-09T13:07Z,"Let's take the exemple of 

Armenian Archers 

 they are recruitable only in armenia

with

minor_governors_residence
minor_governors_palace
minor_governors_mansion
minor_governors_barracks
minor_governors_encampment

if you don't built these buildings they won't show up in the table

Can you try and let me know ...."
[T],Tanauser,2010-03-09T13:18Z,"Libyan Kuloglu  only in cairo
(army_barracks , army_board , army_staff_college , drill_school , military_academy)

Palestinian Auxiliaries only in palestine

Bosnian Panduks   only in bosnia

With the latest Startpos.esf"
,leave_th_room,2010-03-09T15:06Z,"I had loaded the unlock minor factions startpos.esf, now i loaded the original startpos.esf and all the units have showed up :D, thanks"
,jakastou,2010-03-09T20:13Z,"Thank you once again for your great work Tanauser . . . 

Next request is now for Napoleon Total War ...

Can you do the Elite Regiment Units and the Heroes of the Napoleonic Wars ???

"
[T],Tanauser,2010-03-09T20:56Z,"I will first update my Pirate Mod for the latest patch4

Than I will check if I can do something ( I need a  mesh converter for the new NTW units else I can't work)"
,kent318,2010-03-11T10:50Z,"I'm sorry,I used the other packs but it's been so long. I need someone to tell me were to put this please."
[T],Tanauser,2010-03-11T11:43Z,"Again

put the 
user.empire_script.txt inside 

Application Data\The Creative Assembly\Empire\scripts

and the pack inside your Game DATA folder ((inside Program Files\Empire Total War))"
,obelisk_of_guidance,2010-03-11T12:27Z,"love the mod, just want to say that it seems the stats arent original. many things have been changed. like only the circassian cavalry has 12 morale, but here many units have the 12 morale, including armenian archers. and the reload time is wrong too. armenian archers have 15 reload skill. besides the libyan koluglu seem to fire mounted too, they only have dismounted fire, and they can form the diamond formation but in this mod they cant. i used this chart to check the stats, http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?t=241293 , even hayduit irregulars have been given 40 reload skill but in the original they have only 20. although the units are more powerful here i really want to get my hands on the real thing."
[T],Tanauser,2010-03-11T13:52Z,Than you should buy it ............
,obelisk_of_guidance,2010-03-11T16:38Z,is there any way i can change the stats myself?
,Scipio154,2010-03-11T17:40Z,nice job! hope you will do this for ntw as well
,kent318,2010-03-11T21:14Z,Thank You so much man.I really appreciate it I know it's a pain to help noob's.
,jakastou,2010-03-12T15:56Z,"I have one question for you :

15 units from America + 14 units from the West + 12 units from the East = 41 new units

why you say itÂ´s 44 DLC ... I only count 41 

what am I missing here ???
"
[T],Tanauser,2010-03-12T19:28Z,"What about the 9 preorder !?

but 44 4 free sounds good"
,jakastou,2010-03-13T05:40Z,"If you include the 9 pre-ordered that would make 50 new units then ...
but I guess 44 4 free really sounds good ...  ;P"
,pekim,2010-03-17T19:23Z,"I have installed the game razor 1911 and I have installed the Empire Total War 44DLC4free and did exactly as you  written ""put the

2. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5357334/Empire_Total_War_v1.5_Update_9unrar-Razordox -> needs:

A very alluring dlc package; thanks.

Can you advise?
