Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures S01E02: The Missing Years

Fitz (Shawn Ashmore) and Ming (Mayko Nguyen) talk about their imminent insemination plans. Fitz tells her that since he's decided to stay in Toronto and work at Mercy, he'll understand if she changes her mind. But she still wants to go forward even though she knows it will be uncomfortable for everyone. Their plans incite the doctors to reflect back on their early days as residents at the hospital and the professional and romantic rivalries that took root.


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion.
