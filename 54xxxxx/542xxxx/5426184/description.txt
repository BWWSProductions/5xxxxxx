Their music, which can be described as a humorous mix of synth-pop, new wave, electronica, punk rock and pop music, tends to embody a retro-hip European 1960s mod style, with references to that period evident in their music. Some songs evoke a mod/psych/garage-rock vibe, both in production aesthetic and lyrical content, along with 1960s French-pop, in the vein of Francoise Hardy. Some of their tracks are playful, low-fi versions of pop, rock and soul songs that employ the use of analogue recording equipment and reverberation. In that vein, they made a pop version of Salt-N-Pepa's electro rap hit "Push It".
