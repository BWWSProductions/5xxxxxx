,vchoice,2010-03-30T01:16Z,how do you convert these files to mp3?
[T],Valdo__PT,2010-04-07T02:07Z,"vchoice you can use Xilisoft MP3 Wav converter, when you go to convert the files choose all files so you can see the FLAC files you want to add to the converter, otherwise you won't see the files..."
