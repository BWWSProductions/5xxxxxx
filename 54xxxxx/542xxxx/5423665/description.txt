Good amount of stuff here.  Things from American Fireworks News, The Cafe-Former, and a pretty large volume of books written by professionals throughout the years, covering topics such as salutes, rocketry, glitter, and way way more.

I do have a lot of material on rocketry too, that can be used with pyrotechnics, obviously.  Once this torrent is seeded, I will upload it here.
