April 9, 2009 - This weekend marks the fifth anniversary of the original Painkiller's release. The hellish game took a decidedly old school approach to the first-person shooter genre, focusing on the straightforward running and shooting of early shooters like Quake and Doom. But though the gameplay was a definite throwback, the polished graphics and the immense scale of the bosses were firmly rooted in the next generation of gaming. Today JoWood and Homegrown Games are announcing a brand new sequel in the Painkiller series, Painkiller: Resurrection, and we've got the first exclusive details.
