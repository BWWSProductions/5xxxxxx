Silent Hunter 5 Mod tutorial for Campaign Offline Play

As a result of UBI Soft DRM policy and constant requirement for online connection during single play of campaign, legitimate users at their forum, found a way by modding game scripts to allow you guys to advance further in game without their shitty servers.

As this post has been constantly deleted on their forums even it didn't contain any
cracks or patches, or anything against their crap EULA or rules , I'm making it available here for all to download.

Pdf file of tutorial: 650 kb.

Post is a bit messy but understandable.

UBI has lied that unlocks and file saves have to be on their servers.

Everything works offline.

You can use legitimate offline play with ubiplay or cracked version here at Bay.

Either way campaign progression works and saves on your computer too.
