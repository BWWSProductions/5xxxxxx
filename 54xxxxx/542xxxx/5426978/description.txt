                  Type your  message, and  then just  a few     
                  mouse clicks can fax it, print it, e-mail     
                  it,  prepare  an  envelope,  and  print a     
                  label.  Best of  all, leave  your printer     
                  settings alone. To mail your letter, just     
                  stick  an envelope  where the  paper goes     
                  and let Easy Mail  Plus handle  the rest.     
                  You  can  put  a sheet  of labels  in the     
                  printer,   print   the   ones  you   need     
                  immediately,  and  use  the  rest  of the     
                  label   sheet   another  time.   Built-in     
                  importing    uses    easy   drag-and-drop     
                  technology to  make it  a snap  to create     
                  address  files  from  your  existing data     
                  files. Use  our predefined  envelopes and     
                  labels  (metric  and  U.S.)  or configure     
                  your own. Use  one of  our logos,  or any     
                  BMP, GIF, JPEG, WMF,  or ICO  image. Drag     
                  and drop addresses, logos, and bar codes.     
                  Put  post office  bar codes  on envelopes     
                  and labels. Print to the entire list, one     
                  at  a  time,  or  to  selected addresses.     
                  Print just one label or a few  per sheet.     
                  Print  a  full  sheet of  the same  or of     
                  different addresses.

                  After so many years in the scene, both as     
                  individuals   and   as   a  group   we've     
                  definately  become  more  refined,   with     
                  keygens  and retail  supplies and  not to     
                  mention the  latest addition,  ebooks. We     
                  hope  to  bring you  more of  the quality     
                  stuff  we've  brought  so  far  and we're     
                  sure,  unless a  meteorite hits  earth or     
                  something that we'll be  here for  a long     
                       time, on top, as you know us :)          
                  Even  though  we've   grown  quite   big,     
                  there's always room for more  people, and     
                  we're      looking      for      talented     
                  crackers/keygeners  who  can crack/keygen     
                  most protections like  arma/aspr/hasp etc
