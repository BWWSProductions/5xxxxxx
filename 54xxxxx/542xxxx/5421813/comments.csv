Would you be kind enough to check if you got the new ""The Besnard Lakes"" album, called ""The Besnard Lakes Are the Roaring Night"" or simply ""... Are the Roaring Night"", available. They´re canadian and this is their third  studio work. I´d be sincerely thankful _as always_ if your uploading it were possible. Cheers!!!"
