The Legend Continues

TWO DEADLY DESTINIES, 
ONE TIMELESS TASK...  
Turok 2Â® gives you two great ways to play: There is Quest mode, a Single player campaign that continues the Turok story through many new levels of darkness and danger.  Or try Internet/LAN Multi-Player mode: full-screen competition against remote human opponents across the Internet or a LAN (Local Area Network).  Whichever game you choose, you must conquer your fears and master your skills in order to survive to victory!

When TurokÂ® destroyed The Campaigner and the Chronoscepter, he unwittingly unleashed a new threat, this one even more menacing than the one heâ€™d mastered.  For back when time began, the one they call Primagen challenged creation and was caught up in a prison of his own making.  The Lazarus Concordance realized the danger and erected a series of Energy Totems at places thought to be vulnerable to the Primagenâ€™s power.  Awakened by the destruction of the Chronoscepter, the ancient Primagen urgently calls upon his hapless minions to destroy the Energy Totems and free him from his prison.  It falls to Joshua Fireseed, the new TurokÂ®, to confront the challenge as he struggles for the very existence of the Lost Land! He must pay close heed to the wisdom of Adon, the Speaker of Forever Light as she guides him through multiple levels of new adversaries.  As Turok,Â® you will meet some familiar foes, like the hideous Purr-Linn, and come face to face with a blood-chilling cavalcade of new adversaries.  As TurokÂ®, you will need daring, cunning, and all the wonderful weapons at your command to defeat the Primagen and save the Lost Land and perhaps the universe!
