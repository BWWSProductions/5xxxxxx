,Mr77FM,2011-01-15T22:41Z,"Download was quick Film plays well. However, there are many reinactments of Nazi, meetings discussing the fate of prisoners and ways of extermination. These are all spoken in German, with no subtitle or translation. I've been told that (Xivd asd), does not support subtitles. Is this correct?"
