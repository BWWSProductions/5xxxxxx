,KillaXKilla,2010-03-17T15:43Z,"i dont get it, do we unrar everything then what.."
,steinhole,2010-03-18T23:49Z,"Don't listen to the dumbass mac haters. There unrar for free, or you can get StuffIt, which is awesome. There's a couple other free rar programs for mac. Just google ""rar mac free"" and you should find some.

Again, don't listen to the dumbass mac haters. They're just jealous of our sweet computers that can do everything theirs can, but with class, style, and without crashing and having to reboot all the time. They would buy Macs if they could afford them (if their mommies would give them enough allowance money)."

Freaknik: The Musical is a musical special produced by T-Pain in association with Williams Street and Carl Jones. It features the voice of T-Pain as the Ghost of Freaknik, as well as the voices of entertainers such as Lil Wayne, Young Cash, Snoop Dogg, Sophia Fresh, and Rick Ro$$, and comedians such as Andy Samberg and Charlie Murphy who provide additional voices. It was scheduled to air on Cartoon Network's late night programming block Adult Swim sometime in 2009, but after several push-backs, it premiered on March 7, 2010. A soundtrack will also be released by Jive records and Nappy Boy records in June and will feature artists like T-Pain, Cee-Lo Green, Snoop Dogg & many more."
