             Obtaining accurate physical properties for steam and             
             water is critical in many engineering applications.              
             Looking up such data in handbooks is time consuming              
             and error prone. AFT SteamCalc 2.0 provides easy                 
             access to accurate steam and water properties                    
             through a standalone application and through an                  
             add-in to Microsoft ExcelTM.                                     
                                                                              
             AFT SteamCalc calculates properties using the 1997               
             ASME Steam Tables formulation, the most respected                
             source available. An alternate formulation from NBS              
             is also provided. Now engineers can conveniently                 
             access reliable steam and water properties on their              
             desktop PC.                                                      
                                                                              
             AFT SteamCalc Viewer provides three ways to                      
             calculate steam and water properties from a wide                 
             range of available input parameters using either                 
             ASME 1997 or NBS:                                                
                                                                              
             * Single point - a pair of input parameters with                 
               output displaying selected parameters for the                  
               single point                                                   
             * Two points - two pairs of input parameters with                
               output displaying parameters for both points and               
               the difference in value between the two points for             
               each parameter                                                 
             * Range - one parameter a single value with the                  
               second specified by a start value, end value and               
               increment, with output displaying properties for               
               each increment over the range                                  
                                                                              
             Output is user configurable for parameters                       
             displayed, display order and number of digits.                   
             English and SI input and output units are supported.             
             These parameter and unit preferences may be saved,               
             reloaded and set as the default. Input sets may be               
             saved and reloaded. Results can be printed, copied               
             to the Windows clipboard, saved to a formatted file,             
             saved to a delimited file, and saved to an Adobe PDF             
             file.                                                            
                                                                              
                                                                              
             AFT SteamCalc Add-in for Excel lets you directly                 
             access ASME and NBS steam/water property functions
