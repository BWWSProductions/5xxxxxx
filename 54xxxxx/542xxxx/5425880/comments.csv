,Jlas2h,2010-05-15T22:02Z,its a trial run and if you open up the added file it just crashes the application
,air247365,2010-05-16T02:31Z,"works properly, dudes!!!"
,naseer42in,2010-05-16T15:43Z,"Downloaded, installed.  Then installed the patch onto the installed folder.  Started the program, done with hiding the IP.  Then, checked with www.ip-adress.com and ""BAM"" shows my real ip.

Conclusion:  Doesnt work, don't download.

Maybe its working for you Ahmed..but you need to crack your brain a little more to make it work for others.  No grudges."
,zewex,2010-05-20T09:45Z,"Works Fine for me! Great upload, thx man! :) il seed with 10mb :)"
,Sneb_Goupter,2010-05-20T20:01Z,"Hi...Ahmed...just downloaded your torrent 5mins ago and no probs as to install,no viruses ... so straight forward... don't update this program just install first, don't run as yet, then copy the crack into your dir and overrighted....and Bobs your Uncle...enjoy... thx again"
,isisx3,2010-05-25T08:44Z,"Easy install, clean and working as far as I can tell. Does what it's supposed too. Doesn't exceedingly slow down computer like some programs that hide IPs. "
,isisx3,2010-05-25T08:44Z,"OH yeah, Thanks Ahmed1337."
,air247365,2010-05-28T21:27Z,it's 101 works properly
,jeremini,2010-05-29T18:50Z,"it works. same as a comment below. there is no readme in this(well there is but its to another torrent....)

-run setup
-dont update or run program after setup
-copy and paste crack exe into c://programfile/autohide blah blah
-then run and dont update


now it says im in austria 8-)  (but changes every 10 minutes and runs on windows start)"
,jeremini,2010-05-29T22:19Z,o after using it i would not suggest this product... when you use it it is extremely slow when using firefox. most pages dont even load so its pretty much pointless
,antboy6969,2010-06-17T09:41Z,"thanks ahmed
worked like a charm."
,stubz,2010-07-03T18:19Z,"works only on internet explorer, not FF or GC

,z3r0mt,2010-07-18T23:07Z,Very good torrent i was hiding my ip in about 5 mins after starting download only works in ff and ie for me but still a good torrent
,z3r0mt,2010-07-18T23:16Z,^actually i got it working in Google chrome now
,sitakott,2010-07-24T13:33Z,"Works on all browsers I use(IE, FF and GC)

Thanks Ahmed :)"
,Savestar,2010-07-27T17:54Z,"hmm ...yeah it works .. thats what the PROGRAM says ... try to go to a site that reveals your IP ..like ex. http://whatismyipaddress.com/  ..then its another story ...ANYONE CAN CONFIRM that they say its working AFTER they actually went to such a site? ...Or are you all goofed by the proggy saying it works? ....
INFO NEEDED! ASAP .......
Tell me Im wrong ..Id love to be fucking WRONG for once in my life ....Cus if it really works, then your rigth, and I have messed up in the install (which NEVER, NEVER, NEVER happens) ... but ...if .. Im WRONG ..and it WORKS ..I do not need to BUY a fucking proggy that saves my ass and whereabouts from hackers and the likes ....If Im RIGHT ..that it does NOT WORK ..I WILL BUY A IP HIDER! ..recommend me the BEST! ...Nuthin is too good for my ass ..."
,Barroquecore,2010-07-30T21:26Z,"Excellent torrent. Program does work and the new IP is shown on those showmyip sites.
Installation is easier than tits: setup > copy cracked exe > run and never update.
Lol, first IP I got was from China and it wouldn't let me do Google searches."
,Deadich,2010-08-04T19:42Z,"lol! thanks ahmed! it actually worked.

but does it only change my ip in thebrowser or does it change ip for other applications like games, utorrent etc.?


too you who think it's slow: that's normal when using a proxy, if it's extremely slow try changing to another proxy."
,iangrier,2010-08-06T13:04Z,"Works perfectly for me, I just followed the instructions, how hard is that!!!"
,jlkf3,2010-08-09T22:39Z,"Torrent works fine with no problems so thanks Ahmed!!! :-D

****Just To Let You Know*****

The software does indeed ""Hide your IP Address"" but your internet bandwith will be slow because of you Proxying threw there Server (So basically you are viewing the internet threw a server). Sadly i had to uninstall because of how slow browsing became, i didnt even want to attempt a download. So to finish, if you want to just hide your ip address and view simple webpages (No Videos) then this is the software for you."
,goldentongs,2010-08-12T08:13Z,"This does NOT hide your IP, it only uses transparent proxies which can be seen, if you check on showmyip.com it will state your correct IP and also state you are connected through a proxy and show the proxy IP. This program does not use anonymous proxies, it will probably be ok for bypassing regioned websites like watching videos on sites outside their country but probably not worth it due to bandwith being eaten connecting to the proxy, If you plan to use this becuase you NEED to make sure your IP is not detected it is not the tool you are looking for. "
,elGeKoN,2010-08-22T00:09Z,doesnt wor in REAL. when browsing ..Â¨. maybe ... but when u check ur IP .. its still same
,Pliskin.s,2010-08-29T11:43Z,"garbage /and webpage is infected .this one !
connects you to india automatically probably so ahmed can rip you off !  BEWARE ! 

froze my firewall completely ."
,RadiationX,2010-10-06T01:46Z,"hmm..
Froze my internet/firewall... Firefox started lugging..
but thats when i used ones far away..
and i kept requesting ha..
so. Other than that... Its heaps good :3"
,bjroks93,2010-10-10T03:16Z,aks for serial........
,Suba23,2010-11-04T21:22Z,"works,but when I check my ip on google it still gives me the original..so is it not hidden?  "
,Scullyy,2010-11-06T00:54Z,install+crack works. however program does not. useless garbage
,Alchemistry,2010-12-20T10:36Z,"Thx ahmed works fine, but like said someone else it slows big time my server when i have a 70Mps for download, once updated it doesn't work anymore
You're great Ahmed thx brother"
,hel000,2010-12-26T11:13Z,"this program does work! I used for some time, if you think it doesnt hides your IP, make sure you activated IP hiding in the program (just a button that needs to be pressed)

and I have a question, if I use a program like utorrent to make an internet connection, will that program also provide a fake IP? or will I still be traceable by using those programs, any help in welcome."
,hel000,2010-12-26T11:29Z,"just noticing; this program DOES NOT works in google chrome, the only supported browsers are IE, firefox and opera"
,johnquincyadams,2011-01-13T17:46Z,"This program works 100%... just make sure after you install to replace the ""AutoHideIP.exe"" with the cracked one... Thanks Ahmed"
,johnquincyadams,2011-01-13T17:48Z,"This program works 100%... just make sure after you install to replace the ""AutoHideIP.exe"" with the cracked one... Im using a router as well... Thanks Ahmed"
,bps3ce,2011-01-30T03:12Z,thanks
,strix37,2011-02-02T21:17Z,"I downloaded and installed according to instructions. However, although everything LOOKED allright, and AutoHide confirmed that I was connected to a British server, I got the message ""Not available in your area"" when I tried to watch BBC in my usual Opera browser. However, in despair I tried Firefox, and there it works fine! Then tried Internet Explorer, and it works fine there too! So why not in Opera, my favourite browser?"
,strix37,2011-02-02T21:39Z,"After pondering, I guess my Opera problems must have something to do with my proxy settings (they were changed when I tried another British proxy provider some time ago). Now I have tried to change the proxy settings in various ways, but nothing works: can anyone suggest what the correct values should be for AutoHide to work?"
,strix37,2011-02-02T22:02Z,"Sorry to write for the third time, but I have just managed to solve the problem! Some Googling led me to http://www.proxyway.org/ - and there I found out how to find the proxy settings in different browsers. After that, I found the settings in Firefox, and copied them in Opera - and Bob's your uncle: it now all works in Opera too!"
,strix37,2011-02-02T23:47Z,"EXCEPT that I now find that I cannot get OUT of using the proxy except by going into Opera's settings and deactivating the proxy there!! Disactivating AutoHide does NOTHING: AutoHide states that I am no longer using its proxy, but British TV (BBC etc) still works fine, thereby confirming that I still MUST be using the proxy!

So any suggestions as to the correct settings to make AutoHide work correctly in Opera (to make switching on AND switching off work normally) would be profoundly appreciated!..."

IP BLOCKING"" software only 'blocks' other machines from connecting to you. It 
does NOTHING to obscure your IP address, either internal or external in ANY 
WAY.
IP Blocking software simply has a big list of ""known bad"" IP's. IP's 
used by the **AA, government, spyware companies, etc, It keeps those IP's 
from making a connection to your machine.
Your ISP, on the other hand, could in theory (but doesn't bother to in 
practice) see every packet that leaves your machine. There is NO way around 
that.
If you use a secure proxy you can encrypt packets... FOR HTML WEB 
SURFING ONLY and your ISP will only see that you are requesting data from a 
proxy. However, this does NOTHING to hide your P2P activity. It ONLY works for 
web pages.
There is NO WAY to ""hide"" your IP address. Any program which 
claims to do so is simply lying to you. Period

Fact.............."

,indiekidjay,2011-09-10T03:03Z,"if you really want to know what the problem is double click on the crack file ""autohideip"" to open it and it will open loads of random shit then open the same error report about 350 times until it crashes ur pc, its a load of bullshit, ahmed has tried to con us and it doesnt even hide your I.P adress anyway so fuck you ahmed :)"
