,stev666,2010-03-12T07:17Z,"Thank you sir!!!

Guys there are so meny leechers but no thanks, you all just rape and pillage and dont give any thoat to the time and dedication put into uploading theses torrents for us. It takes a few seconds to say thanks and a few seconds after the download to come back and add a +1 to the quality. Dissapointed is not the word i would use for this"

@pdas544: For the same reasons you've mentioned I must restrain myself in upload of such long, big movies. Godfather trilogy is already available in small-sized formats, on like zillion places. Just Google. "
,laptopdog,2010-03-12T08:44Z,"I just wanted to thank you too twentyforty.. you're miraculous! I have slow download speed half the time because I've used up my bandwidth downloading huge-file-sized shows and my network slows me down, so discovering you has been a revelation! Thank you.. and I will continue to seed, as always.

I also love that you loved Life on Mars (as I read in a past comment on an old torrent) ..this isn't a request (I have LoM and A2A on DVD) - I just wanted to say I agre with you - it was magnificent television. 

Cheers."

We are not interested. Go away and never come back."
,nicermog,2010-03-12T16:12Z,"One of the reasons these are poorly seeded could be that there is bandwidth capping which is also a reason people would want small sized files and not want to reach the download caps by uploading, in places like India. Blame the isp's not the users :D"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-12T17:38Z,"@nicermog: Not true. Just another excuse.
As I said before, ONE of the reasons WHY I make files so small is because if people want to reach 1:1, it is much cheaper for files of 144MB, right? 
Get but give back... not as few hours earlier when ""Pippa"" get 17 Hit&Runs out of the first 28 who have finished download. 
Not as 72% of HIT&RUNS I get EVERY single day, no matter what I up - TV show, movie, oldie, piece of junk, cartoon, whatever. Anyone has seen how people vanish when they hit 100%. Be honest, to yourself, and do not spout nonsenses.


BUT... NOW true reason does not exist, except intrinsic flows of human nature... gathering, grabbing, be a swindler, a hustler, take a dump on someone's carpet and getaway with it, get for yourself but not to give others, share, care, empathy... I have more, you know? 

Your reasoning probably just reflects your character-flaws."
,stev666,2010-03-12T19:35Z,"I agree with 20-40, in the past I use to download 350mb tv shows and uploaded 1.1 now since I found 20-40 my bandwidth  has been cut in half, I try to keep a ratio of 1.1 even thou my ratio is 1.1 or 1.2 in the end I am still saving bandwidth coz the files are so small, I just feel that if you can't share don't download it, and if you realy just come here to hit and run I think you would be better off goint to eztv. I always thank 20-40 for his uploads and add a +1 to the quality, I do this because I am really greatfull for all the hard work and time 20-40 puts into the torrents he uploads. So ill say it again.

THANK YOU MY FRIEND!!!!!!"
,jon4fun,2010-03-13T01:18Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon"

No need to make it personal. I seed to well above 1x and i've uploaded enough torrents to know how hard it is to keep them seeded on a public tracker; I get reseed requests and then I restart them for a couple of weeks and then it turns out that I am the only seeder left yet again, so I can empathize with both sides :D"
