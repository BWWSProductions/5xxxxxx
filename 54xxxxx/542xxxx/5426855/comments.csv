Maybe I did not install the crack right.  Comments?"
,untrueparadox,2010-03-18T22:48Z,probably improper install. you cannot update it and you cannot install it over an existing demo. you gotta clear out everything the demo left behind and start fresh.

,Sebastian_b,2011-01-09T03:06Z,"This worked great. Thank you! Although, I wish this crack was applicable to GarageSale 6. "
