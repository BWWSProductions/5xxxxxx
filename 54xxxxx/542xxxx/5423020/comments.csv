Any chance you'd have or be able to get the three books of The Lost Chronicles? Searched high and low and have yet to turn up any results as far as an ebook goes. Only had luck with the audio books."
,Lochat,2012-03-20T06:41Z,"@R34per420: Yes, and you can be abbreviated as ""u"" that doesn't make the person using said abbreviation to be anything other than an utter dullard.

Then again, I'm talking to r34per420, so least that name was made out of a misguided irony, I'm sure the point falls upon deaf ears and think skulls."
