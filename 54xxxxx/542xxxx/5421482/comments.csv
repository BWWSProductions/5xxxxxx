   Least worthy academy award winner ever. The movie has a good intro, but a shitty ending and lines like ""let's split up to cover more ground"" is just ridicousley bad. It's not realistic. Or the sniper scene, I mean it's not easy to hit a guy on the run from that distant - and he had never used the rifle before. You have to adjust the sights.

,Rockalot,2010-03-25T00:07Z,"Yep, this movie certainly proves that the Oscars are just a propaganda-campaign. The fact that this movie won 6 oscars is so unbelievably stupid, it's one of the worst movies I've seen, it has no plot, it's very unrealistic and retarded, the ""terrorists"" with the detonators are probably some of the most patient people I've ever seen since they always wait till the guy has been defusing the bombs for 10 mins while they're standing next to him lol. This movie isn't worth a reward in a 3rd grade movie project.

I don't like war movies, but this was simply riviting. I don't get involved in the politics of war, therefore watch it for what it is. It is a kind of 'day in the life' cross-sectional depiction of war today. The soundtrack isn't overbearing as many US movies tend to be.

The point is here is a movie made 3 years ago and because I talked about it at work it generated interest and revenue for the industry.

When you download a torrent like this movie, you are downloading from other people while also uploading to others.  You don't get in trouble for the downloading part, but the uploading part is what you get fucked for.

You are uploading fragments of the movie to people that most likely don't own it, that is what you get sued for.  

If you were to only download and never upload, you would never get a legal notice from your ISP/movie studio but then all torrents would die if nobody ever uploaded."

,djOATS,2011-07-07T02:13Z,"So I watched the movie. It's rife with bullshit. The cinematography COULD be excellent but they waste it on poor techniques (80% of shots are unsteady and have the Slight Zoom in the shot for 'edgyness' but that means poor camera skills essentially) aside from that, it's Politically motivated, it's full of American dominated racism that is PERPETRATED not EXPOSED(ie the African guy being shoved aside in the opening scene by the Dickless Tough guy to control the robot) and then the African then being the one to be seen as racist and ignorant to the Israeli when he simply asks ""Are you californian"" Give me a break. And one of the sites that used to be good for reviews ""rotten tomatoes"" gives this basically the highest rating ever. Wow, this world is blinded and they are trying to perpetrate this to the young generation. You have this and Alex Jones really doing poeple in. We have crossed the rubicon of ignorance and pride, and it's a long fall down. I initially was told this was a Documentary (see people are so stupid they think this is real life doc) ... wow.

I missed about the first 30 minutes or so but figured I would give it a try. This movie was AMAZING! Like Jarhead and Three Kings it made the characters individual situations intensely interesting and was not just a bomb and bullet storm with no plot or emotion. I liked it.
