Today weâ€™ll be discussing the story of disgraced Congressman Eric Massa and his slow descent into madnessâ€¦ or a featured appearance today on the Glenn Beck show, which is kind of the same thing.  If you havenâ€™t heard, Eric Massa, an upstate Democratic Congressman from New York, is accused of sexually harassing a male aide.  At a wedding a few months ago, a male aide joked to Massa that he (Massa) should be chasing after bridesmaids. From what happened next, Iâ€™m guessing that comment was meant to be ironic. In Massaâ€™s own words â€œI grabbed the staff member sitting next to me and said, â€˜Well, what I really ought to be doing is fracking you.â€™ And then I tossled the guyâ€™s hair and left.â€ Yeesh. It would be less disturbing if he just used the real f-word and grabbed the guyâ€™s crotch. And I hope he didnâ€™t use the word â€œfrackingâ€ during the incident. Whatâ€™s the point of that? Is this sexual harassment thatâ€™s trying for a PG rating? From Masaâ€™s own description, this is the most awkward sexual approach ever that didnâ€™t actually involve a rag soaked in chloroform. 

So now Eric Massa is following up the worldâ€™s most awkward and absurd sexual incident with the worldâ€™s most awkward and absurd defense. He claims this is all part of a plot by the White House to get rid of him because he voted against the healthcare bill in the House. Iâ€™ll say thisâ€”if the White House dreamed up this scenario to destroy him, theyâ€™re geniuses, because when he described it, he sounded like a damned lunatic. This is like like â€œGaslight,â€ â€œWhatever Happened to Baby Jane,â€ and â€œHush Hush Sweet Charlotteâ€ all rolled into one. Massa said the White House â€œwill stop at nothing to pass this health care bill. And now theyâ€™ve gotten rid of me and it will pass. You connect the dots.â€ Well, if you want unrelated dots connected, the place to go is Glenn Beck. And thatâ€™s exactly where Massa is going, today.  Glenn Beck has never met two dots he couldnâ€™t connectâ€¦ and then connect them to a progressive conspiracy that started with Teddy Roosevelt. It should be more fun than a boiling pot full of rubber frogs. I just hope these two guys can have a nice cry together.
