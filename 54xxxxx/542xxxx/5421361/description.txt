IMAGiNE NOTES
IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....

Here we go again with our V2 of The crazies......this time its our video source but mix with some nice audio off Rx's release....thanks guys :)

The Audio hasn't just been remixed we decided to redo the video from the source files again....this time making it higher in bitrate for better quality and also filtered the video slightly different.
