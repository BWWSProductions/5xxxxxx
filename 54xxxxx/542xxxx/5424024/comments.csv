,z1-o.n.e.,2011-03-12T07:23Z,"Followed the instructions as best I could, applying patch to both .exe's and .dll's for ProTools 8. Just like previous commenter, app just stops working. Had to remove and reinstall, still same result. Am I doing it wrong or does this not work with the Digidesign iLok? Have you tried running this on PT? Just curious... thnx"

This used to work on older VST's Standalones and RTAS plugins but since Pace updated their protection it does'nt work anymore common results of using this include Plugins crashing or not showing up in your DAW after patching. We need a new version."
