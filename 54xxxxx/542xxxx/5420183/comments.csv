,ritahalo,2010-03-08T17:47Z,"Thanks man, really appreciate it! I will start download now. Please post the 2nd part soon."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-08T18:44Z,"@ritahalo: It's in encoding right now and ETA is 58 minutes from the time of this comment. I was in doubt, to post first two hours or to wait (in that time not knowing when) the Scene group to post 3rd CD. I have chosen the first solution, and I had right... 3rd CD (last part) was released almost two hours later. Now, it looks almost here..."
,nemesis160,2010-03-08T19:06Z,hey thanks man.......u made my day....missed it on the tube.......m a great fan of ur works....hey i had a question to ask......i download ur uploads for how i met ur mother n its awesome in hd...u give the quality in 85 mb which most uploaders do in 175 mb......have compared both n there is no difference....so going by that ur uploads for how i met ur mother is roughly 4mb per minute....so is it possible for u to do the same with movies ......for a 120 min movie 480 mb in hd wont be bad.....anyways dont know the complexities involved so was just asking........but even ur present uploads r just awesome .........so thanks man once gain
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-08T19:31Z,"@nemesis160: As many of my old regulars know, I am a single guy with relatively slow connection on two year old PC I have assembled myself from the components my small budget can allow. I'm telling you that to make you understand that files I encode are more ""governed"" by such side-factors, than anything else - 360p encodings ARE superior, without any doubt, but... encoding is 46% slower and files are - bigger, hence proper initial seeding takes longer; in case of the movies it takes up to 8 hours and - I can do it only during my night-time... 
You can see on this torrent how I have to split the upload in two parts, to obey the restrictions I, unfortunately, have.
As I said zillion times on ""blown star"" - if I have the money I would buy fastest connections in universe to the people who are less fortunate than me, and then, if something has left, I would buy a really fast connection and new, fast PC to myself. But, I obviously cannot do that...
Only thing I can and know how to is to joggle within silly resources I have, and limits come as derivative, not as main goal."
,valu59er,2010-03-08T20:08Z,"Hey 20-40...hope your doing OK...I've been looking around for 2 classic movies..found one on PB but doesn't want to complete dling :-(

[V],twentyforty,2010-03-08T20:53Z,"@valu59er: Le Chateau de ma mĂ¨re and La gloire de mon pĂ¨re (1990) - I have both. You must get the subtitles, OK? If you can't, say me and maybe I can find subs IF anyone has made ones at all.
Next week, a middle, OK?"
