twentyforty I just want to thank you for the fantastic stand up job you've been doing so far. I am totally grateful for your services. I live in Ghana, West Africa, and so have very slow internet connection. It really makes a big difference in download time when the files are as compressed as yours. 
I was wondering if by any chance you were considering putting up the Academy Awards telecast tomorrow?? I would be even more grateful than I already am if you did!!
Keep up the good work!!

@closetmaniac: Yes, because every year ceremony was released as 1.34 GB XviD (it automatically "fits" in by "really big in size"). Just be here around Monday noon. 

2nd part (last hour of the show) would be posted separately, after this one. Apologies, restrictions are because of the size.
