Newest version of Crossover as of March, 2010. The old v.7-8 patcher still works for the new 9.0 version so here it is.

Instructions:
1. Mount and drag to Application folder.
2. Open patcher and drag Crossover to Crack.
3. Hit patch and you're ready to go.

**This isn't the pro version. It's not out yet. Sorry for the mislabeling.
