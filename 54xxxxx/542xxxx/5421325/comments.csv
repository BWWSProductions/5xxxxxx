,heartgal,2010-04-15T06:53Z,"I'm still here, I remain faithful even as interest seems to be waning -- It would be nice if some who have gotten this and appreciated it would put up some positive comments to encourage those who are not familiar with this movie and are understandably hesitant to invest in a fairly large download.
Just a thought...

Will seed indefinitely - Sincere thanks to everyone that has kept this alive!"

,heartgal,2010-08-21T21:45Z,"Just want everyone to know that I am still seeding this and appreciate all who stay and do their part. I am only able to seed between 6am and 10pm pst, so don't give up if it seems no one is there, I will be back!
