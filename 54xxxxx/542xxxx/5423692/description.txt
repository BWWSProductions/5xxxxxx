Venal Indulgences and Pardons of the Church of Rome - A Collection:

As should we all know by now that the false doctrine of Indulgences of the Church of Rome and its abuses were part of the reasons that antagonized Martin Luther and initiated the Protestant reformation. Indulgences were completely nonexistent in early Christianity. The earliest record of a plenary indulgence was Pope Urban II's declaration at the Council of Clermont (1095) that he remitted all penance incurred by crusaders who confessed their sins, considering participation in the crusade equivalent to a complete penance.

Of course the most scandalous practice about indulgences was to sell them as a means to enrich the coffers of the Church. A complete system was developed to define the different types of indulgences; what sins they are used for, and their cost.

This upload contains 10 titles. Note that the book by Lea (3 volumes) was uploaded before in the group: Sex Solicitation in Auricular Confession. That book was in (pdf) format, the version here is in (dvju) format.

While the first seven titles in this group address in their entirety the topic of Indulgences, the last 3 books contain chapters that address the subject.
