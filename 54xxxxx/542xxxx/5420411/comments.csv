,kanib,2011-01-01T21:50Z,"hey can anyone help? if not, then i think this torrent might be a fake."
,pavloszed,2011-01-08T11:35Z,The noobish you are the best for ps2 games in TPB!! if you can plz upload Conflict Global storm there is one but it has no seeds!!
,pavloszed,2011-01-08T11:38Z,Oh i have a question does the cd speed have any role like 8x or 16x because when i burn games into 16x speed dvds it sais the disc cannot be played i have a chip i think infinity or something like that !!
,kanib,2011-01-20T02:12Z,"hey, i burned the game at 4x speed but i still get the ""not ps2 format disc"" message. could it be because my dvd is only 4.7 GB? The game is about 4.67 GB so it burns all the way to the edge. could that be a problem?"
