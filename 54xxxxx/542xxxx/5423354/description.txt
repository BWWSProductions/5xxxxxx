SYNOPSIS

Shot inside Tibet by two brave Tibetan filmmakers, Leaving Fear Behind is a 
remarkable testimony of ordinary people who are ready to tell the world of their 
suffering under the repression of the Chinese occupation.

Dhondup Wangchen and Golog Jigme travelled for thousands of miles within their 
homeland to record 108 separate interviews with their fellow Tibetans. The vast 
majority, at great risk to themselves, insisted that their faces were shown. The 
footage reveals with stark clarity the level of frustration at the deterioration 
and marginalization of Tibetan language and culture; the destruction of the 
lifestyle of Tibetan nomads through Chinese forced settlement policies; the lack 
of religious freedom and the vilification of the Dalai Lama; and the broken 
promises made by the Chinese government to improve conditions in Tibet in the run 
up to the Olympic games.
