Our good friend Peter Werbe joins us tonight to discuss a recent trip he made to an undisclosed location and what he found when he got there.  Donâ€™t miss this one!

Also open for discussion is the defeat of Kay Bailey Hutchinson by Rick â€œGood Hairâ€ Perry in the Texas gubernatorial primary, and can now continue his Dippity-Do infused rants against the Democrats in Washington DC.  Former Houston Mayor Bill White will be Perryâ€™s Democratic opponent in the general election later this year.

And Charles Rangel has stepped down â€“ at least temporarily â€“ as Chairman of the Ways and Means committee pending conclusion of the ethics investigation into his conduct around real estate transactions in New York and corporate-funded trips to the Caribbean.  Senator Jim â€œCurveballâ€ Bunning must be thrilled at this new media target.

And finally, President Obama unveils his final, ultimate, really, the last time, I mean it, version of his health care reform proposal today.  Teabaggers everywhere reach for their â€œdeath panals!â€ signs, Revolutionary War costumes, and Glenn Beck buttons and prepare to hit the streets!
