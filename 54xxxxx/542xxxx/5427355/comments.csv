I mean, It's been in theaters since February... lol

8.71Gb is a little small for 1080p DTS though"
,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-03-13T09:20Z,why y dont add russian audio and gr subs?
,Feel1ng,2010-03-14T10:31Z,Thank you for uploading! =)
,BrokenEmpires,2010-03-14T10:47Z,"If any of you have problems watching HD mp4 or mkv files such as this one. 
And you already tried VLC media player then:
Download and install K-Lite Codec pack (Mega)
http://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_mega.htm
It includes media player classic which is very light on cpu power.
If you have Win 7 make sure you enable the DivX H.264 decoder.
After install under tools folder open Win7DSFilterTweaker.
Change decoders from 'microsoft' default option.
That's the key to playing back HD videos. 
Thanks for seeding."

Unfortunatly most rippers and seeders only speak English. Though due to recent Russian, Swedish and German uploads that also include an English audio track, that we should do the same for them.

Though make sure if you do that you label the audio tracks properly. :-)"
,sciman,2010-04-16T12:56Z,@LAMBORGHINI38 why not find russian audio and d/l yourself and add it to it just as an idea. 
,Dheir,2010-04-28T02:30Z,"I know most people don't really care much, but if you reside in the US, take note that Warner Bros is monitoring this torrent, as I received a cease notice from my ISP, don't call this horseshit as I got an email with my IP and information about this torrent from my ISP, if you don't care, don't reply, this is simply a courtesy to others. As I own this movie and have since lost reasonable playback ability of it, I feel it is right for me to download it, but wanted others to know that you shall get a warning from your ISP due to DMCA. Thank for reading.  "

17905 x 512 kB pices(packages)
The torrent will Dl/Ul faster because you complete faster a 512 KB piece then a 4 MB piece. You can seed only complete pieces(packages).
I realized for instance a 4 GB torrent split in 512 KB pieces will be faster then a 4 GB torrent split in 4 MB pieces. The more complete pieces you got the more people you can handshake(share) with.
Cool torrent. thx CHD"
