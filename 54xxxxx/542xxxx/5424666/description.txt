Hello! Please do me the favor, and read this text regarding any future playlists!

This will be the last big playlist by me.

From now on, any playlists made by me will be smaller sized (mostly around 50 tracks),
as this year will consume a big amount of my real life time.

Not every future playlist might be finished exactly at the end of a month, 
as this depends on how much free time I'll have. But they will be done =)

Reason:
I'll have a small computer job soon & I can begin my long wanted apprenticeship 
as a caregiver for handicapped people in a few months. 

Both things will be time consuming, so I'm sure you'll understand my situation.

Another reason is that I'll work on a few small tumblr mixtapes (non related pl. tracks) 
in the future & a few mixtapes that I'll ship to other people.

Everything consumes time, so I gotta make the best out of it!

Small rant finished.

Another note:
I added/tagged myspace & artist links into the commentary section of each track, in case you want
to know more about a band, look infos up, or SUPPORT them.

The list is a bit more folkish than my last, but I was just in the mood for that,
but there should be something worthy in here for everyone, as there are multiple genres featured.

Thanks go out especially to fentiger for this fantastic cover!
& to everyone who'd send me recommendations.

Enjoy!
