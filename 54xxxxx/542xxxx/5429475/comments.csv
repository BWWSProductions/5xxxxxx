,dthardcore,2010-03-12T03:53Z,"Actually it is not really that big, This is actually small for a High Def video. But since you were wondering, that is the reason why, It has a resolution of 1280x720 using the x.264 library to encode an H264 video. Most videos you probably download use a much lower resolution closer to 450x350(est.) even though they came from a HD source they are compressed to save space."
,dthardcore,2010-03-12T04:01Z,"Also if you do not have a fast computer and/or newer videocard that supports hardware acceleration you may not be able to play this video smoothly. but if you do you will need to download Media Player Classic - Home Cinema edition to play it. There are other options but IMO this is the best way to play these videos with hardware acceleration.
