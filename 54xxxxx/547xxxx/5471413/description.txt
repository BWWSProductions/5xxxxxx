This is 4748 - Pokemon HeartGold (U)(Xenophobia) pre patched with the USA anti-piracy patch.  It is not the (JP) version patched with English text that I upped before.

If you were playing the JP version patched with English text your SAV file is compatible.

I am including my SAV file as well, it has all 16 badges and Red downed.  You can use my SAV to give you hints and such on where to go or something.


Tested on TTDS 1.17a12 firmware.

If you have an Acekard or Cyclo DS then DO NOT GET THIS as those cards support the game NON Patched.

The patch applied was from here:

Feel free to patch yourself or follow updates.  It appears to be working fine.
