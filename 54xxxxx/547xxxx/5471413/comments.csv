,Real1,2010-03-29T23:27Z,Does it work online despite changes in game structure?
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-29T23:33Z,I don't have a wifi network to test on.  I would guess it would work fine.  I beat the game using the JP patched version and then tried this version today with my save and it runs fine thats all I really know.
,kidio007,2010-03-30T13:25Z,"This works on R4i!!!! I tried walking in and out of doors for 5 mins, and no freezes. Have not had any problems with it, awesome job! ;)"

[V],poppedtart,2010-04-06T21:46Z,"wifi is fine.  GTS works fine, DS to DS battling is fine as well as trading."
,Devil_Spawn,2010-04-16T10:47Z,"again, how do you merge sav files???


ps thanks for all the great uploads"
,monkeysven,2010-06-12T10:21Z,Is it fully English
,classic-only,2010-07-18T04:27Z,"REVIEW:rnrnThis VERSION works FLAWLESSLY.rnrnTested on: R4irnrnNo freezing like the unpatched version. Fully English, Retail version. Even works with Nintendo WFC Mystery Gift Etc. If you have an existing HeartGold Save from an unpatched version, just rename it to the name of the existing save. (usually the game name.sav)rnrnBTW, For those of you who are into that kind of stuff, but are cheap enough to download the game, but not too cheap to skip the accessory :p, the Pokewalker is available from the nintendo store separately for like $8. I\'m not exactly sure what it does, but it\'s necessary for some part of the game."
,tubbaman5,2010-08-06T22:43Z,"How to make it work? when I load the game it says ""The save data could not be accessed.

Please turn the power off and reinsert the DS game card""
And its bullshit i just want to START the damn game! someone please show me how to make it work... (yes the game is running, but stops when it gets to that screen)"
,DefJamV,2010-08-31T04:22Z,"this rom worked great up until lydia attempted to show me the tutorial for catching a pokemon and it froze.

also, it black screened at the beginning until i found the fix code online.

im using the NO$GBA emulator and this rom is no different from the very first pirate rom i found back in 09.

shame :("
[V],poppedtart,2010-09-04T03:53Z,"lol

is not the fault of the rom, use a real nintendo ds and a decent rom card."
