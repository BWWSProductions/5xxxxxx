I too love Friends, infact I tried doing it in small size, but the problem is getting good source, or after decresing the size, result would be a dissapointment. It is on my list don't worry, I will eventually do it "

Eagerly waiting for 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN' can you please give me the release date.
