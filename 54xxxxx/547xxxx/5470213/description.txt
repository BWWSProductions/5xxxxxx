               DVD5, and has been patched with Paradox Patch for Pal or Ntsc
               option. Press O for Ntsc or X for Pal. I shouldn't take credit for 
               this as the source was downloaded from Snesorama.
              


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

And here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description:

The Guy Game takes the wild girls of Spring Break and challenges up to four players in the most extreme party game of all time! Answer trivia challenges, bet on hot college co-eds and compete in multi player mini-games and unlock sexy clips and uncensored Spring Break stunts!

An FMV-based trivia game, The Guy Game pits you and up to three other players in a series of rounds in which you must answer multiple-choice trivia questions for top scores. Whether you play alone or with friends, you'll also be playing in the company of a couple of comic relief voice-overs that provide commentary, as well as dozens of co-eds out for spring break, who are more than happy to drop their tops off should they lose the questions. Their naughty bits are obscured by "Guy Game" logos, but depending on how much bonus score you get, you can remove the censoring from the clips and unlock them for uhm... further analysis.

You get bonus points by figuring out if the girls are going to answer right or wrong, what they answer, and also by betting on the outcome of mini-games where the girls compete in races, and assorted beach activities.


Features:

* 20 different episodes, each featuring interviews, stunts, and challenges with
  hot college babes!

* Top scorer becomes "President" and can make rules and control the game, while 
  the low scorer loses influence and respect.

* Choose from 8 sexy cheerleaders with outfits that become more revealing the 
  better you do.

* Compete between trivia rounds in challenging mini-games with high-speed action.

* Test your knowledge with over 1000 unique trivia questions in a variety of
