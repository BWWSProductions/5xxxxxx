,Nakorentreri,2010-03-29T20:20Z,Hi this looks great but after installing its not working for me. I get a message saying the game needs at least 1024x768 res min. and that it closes the game. This is right at startup. The thing is i got that rez minimum lol im on a Rad HD 4770 on HDMI rez 1920x1080 so im thinking theres somoething wrong about this. Anyways if someone got an idea or suggestion id really apreciate it.

,DikkatDeliVar,2010-03-30T15:46Z,"Matrix Games is not a trusted game company which has playable games right at the beginning. You will need to wait for further patches and cracks to be able to play their games, including this one.
1.02 patch is up already, and official tech forums still full of messages game still keeps crushing.
Thanks anyway, thenoobish, we owe a lot to you :)"

Can anyone confirm if it's really the trojan or a false positive?"
