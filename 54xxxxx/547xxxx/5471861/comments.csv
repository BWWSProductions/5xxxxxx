,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-03-31T06:02Z,"sanpork, i downloaded the other torrent, and it works and all, but it's extremely laggy. voices, background audio is all out of sync during cut scenes and the gameplay gets really lagged out at times. is it just my comp or is it the download? should i try this one?

my specs:

Processor Type - Intel Core 2 Quad Q6700
Processor Speed - 2.66GHz
RAM - 6GB PC2-6400 DDR2 SDRAM (Exp. To 8GB)
Hard Drive Speed/Capacity - 750GB SATA 7200RPM
Optical Drives - Super Multi DVD Burner with LightScribe
Graphics - NVIDIA GeForce 9500GS
Shared Video Memory - 2303MB
Video Memory - 512MB
Sound Card - High Definition Audio
Integrated WiFi - Wireless LAN 802.11b/g/n

i can play any other game perfectly fine, fallout 3, battlefield bad company 2, mass effect 2, etc, but this game gives me major lag."
,GeekyMacBoy1,2010-03-31T06:02Z,so it takes 10 gigs away if u install??
[T],sanpork,2010-03-31T07:16Z,It takes only 4 GB but for extraction it takes more space & after setup completion all temporary files get deleted automatically.
