It is recommended you have the K-Lite Codec pack installed if your using WMP (Windows Media Player) in order to play these various FLV, MP4, and AVI files. 

-So if you are using WMP, Google K-Lite and stay Updated!!
(Or Download Vol.1 Which includes the K-lite Codec installer)
****Another Better Alternative
You could download the most recent version of the KMP player here which doesnt need various installations of multiple codecs.

  So once again I say, it is Highly Reccommended to use either Solution in order to play these files.
