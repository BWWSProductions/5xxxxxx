First, no 1 April Joke.

Workaround for the Animus-Whitescreen and first Version of the Server-Emulator:
1. Make sure, that you have the retail(nonsteam) untouched(nodumbcracked) Version of AC2 and the Ubi-Gamelauncher
2. Download the Package from Dormine here
3. Extract the whole content of the archive to a new folder on any location
4. Download Python 2.6 and PyCrypto 2.0.1 and install them(if you are too dumb for that, forget the crack and wait for a one-klick release  )
5. Open the tls.py in the source folder from the extracted content with an editor like wordpad oder idle.
6. Find these lines

Code: Select all | Line number On/Off | Expand/Contract
1. 
2. 
3. if extrasettings != binascii.a2b_hex("00001600040005000a000900640062000300060013001200630100"):
4. print "ERROR, unexpected client settings", binascii.b2a_hex(data)
5. sys.exit()
6. 
7. 


7. Delete them and save the file
8. Install a Webserver like xampp
9. Now, you must know the apache files folder for your webserver. For xampp, it's named htdocs in the xampp folder on C:
10. Copy the whole content of the htdocs folder into a new folder
11. Create the following structure in your htdocs folder:
xampp/htdocs/orbit/satellitelist/satellitelist.txt
open the satellitelist.txt and write in
127.0.0.1
12. save the file
13. start the apache webserver in xampp
14. Put the following lines into your hosts file(C:WindowsSystem32driversetchosts) and save it:

Code: Select all | Line number On/Off | Expand/Contract
1.127.0.0.1       static3.cdn.ubi.com
2.127.0.0.1       ubisoft-orbit.s3.amazonaws.com
3.127.0.0.1       onlineconfigservice.ubi.com
4.127.0.0.1       orbitservice.ubi.com
5.127.0.0.1       ubisoft-orbit-savegames.s3.amazonaws.com
6. 


15. Copy the values.db from the server-emulator folder into the source folder and Run Command line(cmd)
16. Browse to the folder where your extracted files are with the "cd DIR" command
17. Type in "cd source" and hit enter
18. Type in "server.py" and hit enter
19. Leave the command line open and start Assassins Creed 2
20. Login with any Username and Password
21. Play, until you are a baby and must kick with your legs 
22. Wait for an updated values.db with new responses
23. Have Fun

Not tested by me since I dont have the game. (Hope it works)
