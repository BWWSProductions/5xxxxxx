[V],Mbb15,2010-04-01T16:16Z,link=like -_-
,WayOne,2010-04-01T16:48Z,Although i know how to work with Xampp that's a little too much work for me. I'm sure a fully working workaround is going to be released soon (Splinter Cell Conviction). Anyway thank you for uploading it's nice to know someone is still working on it.
,ponaniek,2010-04-01T16:55Z,"can anyone confirm/deny this ""kaotik2k: by the way its a BETA crack only allows few mins of play""?"
[V],Mbb15,2010-04-01T17:11Z,"changed torrents name, now wait for final release and it is good to know for you people that people are still working on a crack/emulator"
,pakrat,2010-04-01T17:19Z,"IDIOT!!! remove the link to the website in your info, UNTIL a FINAL version comes out... "
,Deansdale,2010-04-01T18:42Z,"Honestly i think that's indecent to criticize the work of people devoted much of his time for others to enjoy. Simply criticize. 
I find it interesting to present what was done so that others can develop and improve what is done. 
Despite having to improve the emulator, congratulations on your work. 
Thanks

if this is a fail why do you post 5 comments? just go away"
,Deansdale,2010-04-01T19:02Z,"I never knew this Emulator (I think it says Beta) if it was not him.
This work is the Dormin now know. But it's evolving, is still in Beta, as it says in the post. Many look to this torrent and will follow this path to a common end, play the game and lead to Ubisoft to despair.

,ponaniek,2010-04-01T19:13Z,"kaotik2k, chill or GTFO. Thank you :)"
,Deansdale,2010-04-01T19:17Z,"@kaotik2k
By missing an 'e' in Dormine is enough to insult.
I think your despair by the crack is affecting your behavior.
Ridiculous kaotikok.
oh sorry, kaotik2k! :)
Deans"
,Deansdale,2010-04-01T19:38Z,"I think congratulate someone who is only to present the work of others can be frustrating for the creator of the emulator, I apologize and I understand the secrecy in developing this emulator.
Regarding the name, was a simple mistake, no intention and is excusable.
Your insults? They really were unnecessary.

,hrev4,2010-04-01T22:13Z,"@kaotik2k: so what if they know? if this really works as a server emulator, we dont have to connect to ubisoft server, therefore they cannot do much"
,cakes94,2010-04-01T22:45Z,"PRAISE MBB15 AND HIS TEAM, once again he has shown the company that fucking up the game for the players doesnt work either, even if it doesnt work fully, you could say its 90% complete since theres just a little fix neede.. i think/hope"

,Shadow9111,2010-04-02T00:56Z,"So just to clarify, this doesn't actually crack the game, but it prolongs the white screen? And further, it doesn't actually do anything for us except to show that AC2 can and will be cracked soon?"
,whitephantom,2010-04-02T00:57Z,"Well , I don't know if it was smart move to upload beta crack , but is very comforting to know that the crackers have not abandon the work on the crack."
,badboy420,2010-04-02T03:47Z,"FOR THOSE WHO ARE STRESSED UP TRYING IT.


JUST WAIT FOR SOME 1 CLICK VERSION FROM SOME RELEASER'S.

its not gonna take long.

This server emulator stuff is kind of beta.give the crackers some time to figure out the data packets that get transfered till the last mission in the game.


PATIENCE,PATIENCE,PATIENCE"

,badboy420,2010-04-02T18:45Z,"@kaotik2k

think about a mass PC platform with millions of legal buyers, and ubisoft trying a new method to overcome this emulation.

Well, they would definitely be afraid of another DOS attack on their servers,

wouldn't they..?

i dont think u understand how this crack works, donnu why really, it isnt that hard to get,, the game has been finished by too many gamers so all the data needed has been colected longtime ago ,, so ubi cant do nothing about it, the prob now is to make 100% working server emulator"
,SteXDudE,2010-04-03T20:05Z,"I done everything that is in readme file,instaled assassins creed 2,add 5 lines in hosts file,add ipconf... in cmd and i run setup.exe and the game and still is saying i need internet connection(in readme it says i need to update Ubisoft Launcher to 115 maybe thats the problem pls help)"
,NanoEntity,2010-04-03T21:09Z,"Yeah the DB only is updated to Chapter 5, after that you cant progress anymore.

Only way to fix is if someone plays all the missions and logs the values for the database else you wont have 100% working game.

Expect to take this very long time."
,SteXDudE,2010-04-03T21:28Z,Yes i done it and still a get i need internet connection to play any other solutions please i want to play BADLY
,SteXDudE,2010-04-03T21:33Z,"I dont think the firewall is the problem on the forum some guy wrote this:
You dont need an internet connection for emulator to work. The problem is probably because u haven't updated the hosts file. When you modify the hosts file it makes the ubisoft url redirect to the emulator so ur doing something wrong.

In order to help and support the emulator you need:

1. Original Assassin's creed 2 Retail Dvd
2. Download the emu made by dormine
3. edit your windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts file and add these values
