,sarsapil,2011-03-10T21:45Z,"I tried once, I was a given a computer system, it seemed to work using the laws of chance, they cleaned me out, the reason is that the casino owners set limits to your betting strategy so you can't possibly beat them, unless one day you happen to be VERY lucky, so THE HOUSE (almost) ALWAYS WINS !! Stay away and you'll keep your money..."
