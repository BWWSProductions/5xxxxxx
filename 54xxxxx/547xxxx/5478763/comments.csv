[V],twentyforty,2010-04-03T18:21Z,"@laptopdog: I was too... woke at 1:38 AM, downloaded 720p for one hour, encoded 272p for another and posted small sized encoding right here at 3:30 AM. Then I watched the episode just to see how bad was the supposedly 720p input. I left that first, uglier version up for three hors then - deleted... Maybe 50 fans get ""lucky"" and downloaded that ""preview"" version. This is second version, and I tried to some extent ""rectify"" or to improve really ugly input.
If you are a fan of A2A (and I almost know you are) read, please, the NOTE part in the description above, to avoid future ""misunderstandings"", regarding expectations about my encodings of A2A."
,laptopdog,2010-04-04T05:57Z,"You're right twentyforty - I'm a massive fand of A2A, and also LoM (one of my favourite TV shows of all time). And I'm in Australia and they're unlikely to screen season 3 of A2A here for quite some time, so I owe you big time. I only just finsihed the download (am on restricted bandwidth at the moment so your files are extra, especially appreciated) and I just started watching it (on VLC) - the quality is great (thank you!) but I can completely understand your frustration. I just greatly appreciate this episode that I'm about to watch right now! So I can't thank you enough for what sounds like a massive amount of work to upload it like you did. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"

I'm living in Poland and even if they show A2A in the future I'm unlikely to understand it properly, lost in translation as they say :)  I really really appreciate what you're doing, BIG thanks."
