NOTE: I guess FoV performed April-fools joke; their 720p is tagged as HDTV, but - either is that saddest HDTV transport stream ever seen or they simply upscaled plain cable capture to get both 720p and XviD releases from such horrible input.

Maybe - maybe - they have been pranked too by TV producers who have fooled the audience and saved few Euros they need as gas-money for Jaguars they adore.
Who knows?

IF some normal, decent group next episode doesn't release as nice looking 720p, I would be forced to kick-out A2A from any future considerations.
