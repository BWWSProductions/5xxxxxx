3OH!3 (pronounced "three-oh-three") is an electro hop group from Boulder, Colorado formed in 2004 named after the 303 area code,[1] which includes Boulder as well as the Denver metropolitan area.[2]. The band is best known for their hit single "Don't Trust Me", which reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their second single, "Starstrukk" featuring Katy Perry, was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Finland and Australia.

3OH!3 consists of Sean Foreman, born August 27 1985 (age 24)[3] and Nathaniel Motte, born January 13, 1985 (age 25)[4], both of whom are natives of Boulder, Colorado.[5] The pair met in a physics class while attending the University of Colorado.
3OH!3 is also known for their hand sign, referenced in their song "Holler 'til You Pass Out", performed by touching two thumbs and forefingers. This is frequently seen at concerts, and their album art of 3OH!3 (album) is the hand sign.

FUDGESOCIETY NOTE
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I'm personally not a fan of Live albums, and greatest hits. Because it's honestly redundant. Why have more than what you need unless you're a die hard fan. And if you're a die hard fan of a band, you wouldn't be torrenting their music. You would be supporting and buying, which I still support for every band album I upload. I promote torrenting, seeing if the band is good, then going out and buying the album. In no way do I promote the soul use of my torrents without intent to buy the album. Don't ruin the internet for us, these torrents are just a way to see how a band sounds, and find any missing tracks that you might not have.

Thank you and please seed. The support of my torrents, will greatly increase the amount of uploading I do. More seeds, more torrents, more smileys! :D
