    Raymond focuses on bread and the miracle of yeast. His     
    first recipe is a French classic, brioche, a buttery      
    bread using eggs that is the easiest of bread recipes.   
    Using this as a base, he makes a celebratory gateau a     
    la creme brioche filled with a lemony creme fraiche. To    
    follow, we get down to basics with a French country       
    bread recipe essential to any bakers' repertoire, that   
    is formed into beer-topped rolls, a basket-shaped loaf    
    and an olive-and-tomato-topped fougasse. To finish,        
    there's a delicate yet spectacular dessert of apple       
    croustade made from the thinnest pastry baked until      
    crisp and golden.                                         
    Along the way, Raymond visits one of the UK's oldest       
    flourmills, Shipton Mill in Gloucestershire, to           
    experiment making bread with gluten-free flour.
