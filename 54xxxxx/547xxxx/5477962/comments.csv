Seems they can't make up their minds about the title, or release dates, indeed.

But this is ""Alien Contact"" aka ""Life Out There."", also seems they intended to premiere season 2 Ep01 on the 15th but did so on 1st instead, info is ambiguous but here's the synopsis.

Are we alone? It's an age-old question that was relatively ""taboo"" in mainstream science until the mid-1990s, when astronomers found planets outside our solar system. Now, Known Universe joins the hunt for alien life as scientists search for planets with similar characteristics to Earth's. We'll take you on a journey to find planets that may support life and show you new space-based technologies that aid in the search for advanced alien civilizations.
