Being as this is a virtualization utility and not teh new haxorz game or w/e it's not surprising you don't a lot of comments. The people that would need this probably won't need to ask silly questions about how to use it."

,cocacolafire,2010-12-22T15:34Z,"@firebirdtransam

Haha, same here bro. I expect your using the chrome OS from http://chromeos.hexxeh.net/?

I havent seen another DL link for the chrome OS anywhere else. If this works, I will have the fastest computer in my college xD"
,hel000,2010-12-28T21:19Z,"just a question, when I start VMware, it sais there's an update available, am I safe to update VMware, or will it become unusable after that?"
,X02,2011-01-07T13:46Z,"@hel000: it's probably best not to attempt an update in case it checks for a valid serial upon doing so. This version should work fine for anything you need it to do, and when some major new features come out, you can be sure that someone will have a new download for you to use. 

Just waiting for it to finish downloading now, thanks for seeding guys!"
,OBizzle,2011-01-13T05:03Z,I tried the other ones and this is the one that actually works. Thanks!
