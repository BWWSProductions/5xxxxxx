Wes Merritt and his daughter Natalie (14) get more than they
bargained for when they buy an old house that was formerly inhabited
by the nice old Mrs. Ashboro and her pet cat, Margaret. When strange
things start happening in the house, all fingers point to the presence
of Margaret, who died the same day as Mrs. Ashboro. But why has she
come back to haunt them?
