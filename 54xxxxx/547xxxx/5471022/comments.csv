,yoyozo,2010-05-04T01:45Z,why MKV ?
,WENKERBOY,2010-05-07T19:42Z,"@yoyozo Without change and new developments, there is no progress. Your point seems to be that you like .mp4 and it's presently more popular so you think everyone should use it exclusively and never change. Well sorry, but we could all be watching 160x120 10fps Indeo Video 3.2 movies with that approach. As has been stated several times in this thread, .mkv is actually a superior container in several aspects. People are migrating to take advantage of this. It makes the A/V universe an evolving and better place. Down the road will come another container... perhaps one that supports video-in-video streaming and we'll move on to adopt that too. That's how the technology universe works... and it's a good thing."
