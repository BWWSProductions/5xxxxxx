Born in a Cincinnati zoo, two Bengal tiger cubs â€“ Ron and Julie â€“ have spent the last three years being taught how to hunt and live in the wild of South Africa by human teachers John Varty â€“ veteran naturalist and cameraman â€“ and young Canadian zoologist and cat-handler Dave Salmoni. If they can be successfully integrated into the wild, they could become the forerunners of an audacious plan to help save the worldâ€™s population of wild tigers.

Follow the journey from cuddly cub to professional assassin â€“ all captured on film and video â€“ as the youngstersâ€™ feral instincts slowly emerge in the African wilderness. Instinctively, all cats will stalk. However, it is the killing technique that must be learned by watching their mothers. Without their parentâ€™s guiding example, the cubs clumsily cut their teeth on large antelope â€“ often holding on for dear life.

More fascinating than gruesome, the drama of life and death unfolds in amazing detail. A handheld camera hovers inches from Julieâ€™s jaws as she prowls, while a clever, head-mounted surveillance camera captures Ronâ€™s point of view as he closes in for the kill â€“ the very first POV images ever recorded from a large predator while hunting. It is a documentary unlike any other â€“ an intimate, step-by-step look at the transition of two zoo-born tigers into the wild as they struggle to become independent and self-sufficient, while serving as pioneers for captive tigers everywhere.
