Simple as this, I've been tryin to download this from here, but that torrent didn't have any seeders. 

So I finally found these awesome vocals again! And this time I packed up the rar file and is now sharing the wave files, I will always seed on it since I downloaded it straight to my FL Studio pack!


I suggest you do the same, just choose the download path to /image-line/data/patches/packs and hit ok!

That way, you will keep seeding them since you use them, and won't delete them like you would with a rar file :)


Anyways, comment's are ALWAYS welcome to me :) And stay on it, you know how much you've waited for it, don't let others wait for it aswell!


(P.S Searching for collab, search dj hansson or user name babehasse onand msg me D.S )
