Using images from Arab TV, rarely seen in the West,
Obsession reveals an â€˜insider's view' of the hatred
the Radicals are teaching domination. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

The Third Jihad
---------------

In 72 minutes, the film reveals that radical Islam,
driven by a religiously motivated rejection of
western values, cultures and religion, is engaging
in a multifaceted strategy to overcome the western
world.

Islam - What the West Needs to Know
-----------------------------------

Main Idea
Virtually every major Western leader has over the
past several years expressed the view that Islam
is a peaceful religion and that those who commit
violence in its name are fanatics who misinterpret
its tenets. This claim, while widely circulated,
rarely attracts serious public examination.
Relying primarily on Islamâ€™s own sources, this
documentary demonstrates that Islam is a violent,
expansionary ideology that seeks the destruction
or subjugation of other faiths, cultures, and
systems of government.

Content
The documentary consists of original interviews,
citations from Islamic texts, Islamic artwork,
computer-animated maps, footage of Western leaders,
and Islamic television broadcasts. Its tone is
sober, methodical, and compelling.
