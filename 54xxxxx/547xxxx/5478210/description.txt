James Birdie's popular farce "It Depends What You Mean" provides the perfect source for director Frank Launder's whimsical comedy. Sim stars as Captain Paris, an exasperated army chaplain and entertainments officer of a conscripted battalion. Attempting to put on a show for his troops, his idea for fun and games is a Brains Trust. Amazingly the punters flood in but his effort falls apart when he enlists the help of others and brows become furrowed over the interlocking private lives of three panellists.
Pitch perfect in the central role, Sim had a personal interest in the production and was pivotal in driving it to the screen after producing Birdie's play at Westminster Theatre in 1944.
