,jersson,2010-04-01T21:11Z,Is there a chance to upload latest vers of Adobe Acrobat Reader 9.3. i have an old vers (9.0) and I like to upgrade it ?

You mean the Reader only, or the whole Acrobat package?"
[V],NoExcuses,2010-04-01T22:29Z,"@jersson
If you want the whole package, I've seen one on pha-zed-dl-.-co-m, it's about 1.42 GB. You can get it there, just remove all the - and add the extra triple w in the beginning. Some kind of filtering doesn't allow me to write the right URL."
