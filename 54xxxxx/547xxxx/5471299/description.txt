      Muddle Earth is a beautifully animated high              
      comedy-fantasy-adventure series that brings the         
      eponymous illustrated book to life. Intended as a      
      homage to Lord of the Rings, the series takes the       
      concept to a mad world, inhabited by ogres, goblins,     
      trolls and elves, where literally anything can happen.
