[T],artpepper,2010-03-29T17:30Z,@AlanonCapone-Did it work OK? I haven't actually been trying these apps. I just scan them for nasties and upload them if they seem useful. Hope it works for you.

,abigail03,2010-12-26T18:40Z,OMG. It doesn't work now mr. artpepper. It did work last time. Can you please work on it again? The program doesn't connect to the internet anymore. T_T Pleaseeeee..
,iamnotanashtray,2011-01-05T02:33Z,"When I copied the crack, I wondered why the crack would be near twice the size of the program it's self.

There's a trojan in it, BDS/Backdoor.Gen2"

I only download the crack and used it with the original setup, and it works perfect.

,Sophyah,2011-06-27T06:46Z,Well...there was really know point for this torrent if your paying for the books still and you have a virus in you torrent very pointless to even waste your time with such a torrent...your still paying for the books i can access this program from google and dont have to worry about any trojan in my computer.....smh huge disappointment !
