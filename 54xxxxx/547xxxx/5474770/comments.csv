,natyxxo,2010-04-01T15:33Z,Hey! Great UL! Could someone please upload discs 2 and 3 from the Target's Deluxe Edition? THX!
,Ganddi,2010-04-04T06:20Z,"natyxxo: no offense but could you please buy the Deluxe Edition from target so you can support the producers or just download this and stop complaining.

Thanks hjsn1. Ill seed for the whole month of April"
,natyxxo,2010-04-04T21:54Z,"Ganddi: No offence, but could you please stop butting into someone elses matters? Who was complaining??? I was asking, not complaining... hello? lol"
,natyxxo,2010-04-04T21:58Z,"Furthermore, if you look at the description closely, you can see this:

""PEOPLE WHO DOWNLOAD TORRENTS FROM DJFRED AND MYSELF, PLEASE SEED EVEN AFTER THEY ARE DONE DOWNLOADING. THAT WAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET MORE MOVIES UP. WHO KNOWS, THE NEXT ONE WE PUT UP MIGHT BE A REQUEST OF YOURS.""

I made a request. I assume that's why this part of the desctiption is there."
,natyxxo,2010-04-04T22:06Z,"What's more, only US residents can order it and I'm not one. So I can't order it."
,missywissy78,2010-04-05T22:27Z,"I would also like to get a hold of : discs 2 and 3 from the Target's Deluxe Edition!
That version is like natyxxo said only available for US residents ... and i'm not a U.s resident so i can not order it either !"
,missywissy78,2010-04-05T22:29Z,what puts this release apart from the others on TPB ? is there any extras on it?
,apath3t1cem0,2010-04-06T03:59Z,"My friend wanted the 2nd and 3rd discs.
