,Naivor,2011-01-27T15:18Z,"Theres one bad thing about this game, which is the fact that saves dont seem to work. I've started 3 different characters thus far, but the game still says that there are no saves. I even checked appdata/roaming/Bonetown/savegames, and there was the text file thats supposed to appear when you save.
Anyone else had this."
