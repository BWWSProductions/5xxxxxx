,Dstone5,2010-07-06T08:09Z,"I've used Pirate Bay for years, but I have made only two or three comments. I'm making a special effort at this very moment to let you know something important.

This is a LEGIT torrent. In fact, lazyjoe7565 you are a GOD for putting this up. This was a fast torrent for me. It's almost done and it took about an hour. I'm listening to Limelight right now.

Big thanks to the uploader, and you complainers stop complaining. I will seed this as long as possible. It's seedworthy :)"
