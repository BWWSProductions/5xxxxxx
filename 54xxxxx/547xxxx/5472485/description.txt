Phil Guy (1940-2008 ) never was able to establish an identity separate from his older brother Buddy, but as his debut album Bad Luck Boy shows, he didn't really try, either. Guy's stock-in-trade is Chicago blues, and while he doesn't perform with much imagination, he's hardly incompetent, either. The problem may be that he's simply competent, unwilling to shake things up even a tiny bit, but competency can be entertaining as well. That's the case on Bad Luck Boy. Guy never really got better than he did here, as he's supported by a number of Chicago veterans and he turns out a likeable, albeit predictable, set of Chicago blues, balancing covers with originals. There's not necessarily much passion here, but it's well-done music, and it illustrates that Guy can deliver the goods on occasion. Thom Owens, All Music Guide
