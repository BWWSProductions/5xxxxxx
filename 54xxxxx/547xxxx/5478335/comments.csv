but wtf is this dude
""Sound Quality: Varies. It also doesn't matter""
of course it matters. if its 96K instead of 320 that would be good to know so i know  if im wasting my time or not"

,codak29,2011-01-19T15:16Z,"Zeldafan21 has no idea what he's talking about.

LOW QUALITY WARNING

Tracks are 128 or lower except Year of the Black Rainbow (which is at 320).

Tracks less than 192 sound wishy-washy and I can HEAR the difference."
