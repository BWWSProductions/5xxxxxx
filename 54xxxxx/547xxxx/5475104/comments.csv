,trickdaddy0024,2010-04-01T05:39Z,"At least this host makes a better argument without being so annoying like you know who...END 

PS Does thunderbitch even know that Rush is not back yet...Driveby Troll...END"
,BarrySoetoro,2010-04-01T06:55Z,"Lulz... clevelandsteemer and trickdaddy are two neurotic little hypocrites, aren't they? One simply lies, the other has replaced the period with ""END"" in the hopes that he can shut down debates he knows he could never survive in.

One's named after scat play, and the other thinks he's an e-pimp... lol. Quite the revolution! An army of angry, uneducated, dependent idiots from broken homes who were brought up on pop-culture.

I'm shaking in my boots. No, really."
,booboo332,2010-04-01T07:08Z,"littletrick, you calling someone else a 'troll"" is perhaps the funniest thing you have said to date and that is saying a lot.

You spend more time under bridges than a hundred hobos."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-04-01T15:30Z,"Bugaboo, that right thunderbitch is a ""Driveby Troll"" he/she is always on here and then s/he speak w/o really knowing whats going on...Yes ThunderBITCH you are the official ""Driveby Troll""...Also bugaboo I would like to nominate you as the official Rush/Piratebay Troll because you on here everyday commenting on stuff having nothing to do with you...I dont think you have a girlfriend because you spend all your time fighting with people you dont know...Maybe you need to go outside and play or clean your room like your mom keeps telling you to...END"
,TedKennedy,2010-04-01T15:47Z,LOL this guy is a CLASSIC LIBERAL. shut down any real debate and just name call (they know the facts are not on their side).
,booboo332,2010-04-01T17:28Z,"""you on here everyday commenting on stuff having nothing to do with you""

""you spend all your time fighting with people you dont know""

I take back my previous comment, THIS is the funniest thing you have ever posted, littletrick.  Now that Maria Sistrom is no longer making her daily posts, YOU are the troll supreme on these torrents. Your accusations of others of trolling only illustrates how much you lack basic self awareness.

You are at your most entertaining when people get under your skin and your whining about me ""fighting with people (I) don't know"" is especially rich.  You're the douche keeping score of self appointed ""KOs"".  Don't stick it out if you don't want it slapped."
,thunderbum,2010-04-01T22:48Z,"Poor little trickydickster has TWP Syndrome (teeny weeny peeny) so he feels 'big' only when he pretends to be important.

Here's a head's up for ya little man: El Rushbo was supposed to be back for Wednesday's show, and only after listening for the first few minutes did we all find out that he was taking another day.

Now get off mommy's computer and go wank. Say- I'd bet you'd love to be Barney Frank's personal teabagger! 

PS: missed you and your fingerpuppets for the last few days. I only had Obama to give me my daily laugh, but I have to admit you're a whole lot funnier."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-04-02T00:50Z,"Don't stick it out if you don't want it slapped. --bugaboo Ahhhh good one but let's dive into the meat of your argument..""you on here everyday commenting on stuff having nothing to do with you"" --me Nice try b ut no dice...I am not here all day long like yourself...I make time to work, go to the mall, play video games, fuck my girlfriend, even go to the fair...You on the other hand are here everyday like you are reporting for work...Yet your other point when I wrote, ""you spend all your time fighting with people you dont know"" --me Is correct but I like to describe myself as Clint Eastwood. Like Eastwood, I goto the message board and expresses my opinion...But get attacked not based on fact but on Personal issues...Like Eastwood, I destroy my enemies with fact they dont get from Rush...But many of the idiots for example thunderBITCH who can be described as a radical fool who has a 4th grade education cannot comprehend that Rush is playing s/he for a fool...Nonetheless, you have earn half a point for efforts..53-2½ (53 KO's)"
,trickdaddy0024,2010-04-02T01:15Z,"Now get off mommy's computer and go wank. --ThunderBitch I would appreciate you not biting my style...Its like someone handing you the answers to a test then you telling the professor you studied all night...Be Original

""PS: missed you and your fingerpuppets for the last few days. I only had Obama to give me my daily laugh, but I have to admit you're a whole lot funnier."" --ThunderBitch Name one thing Obama said that was funny so we all could laugh...Was me calling you a Bitch funny?

""El Rushbo was supposed to be back for Wednesday's show, and only after listening for the first few minutes did we all find out that he was taking another day."" --ThunderBitch ThunderBITCH has proven my point...""Does thunderbitch even know that Rush is not back yet...Driveby Troll"" --me  I listen to the show yesterday (correct me if I'm wrong) and the host clearly stated that Rush will be back on Thursday...Although bugaboo is very annoying he would have not made that mistake...He is obviously more intelligent than you ThunderBitch and you are on an island by yourself when you try and debate with me...""...END 54-2½ (54 KO's) Didnt even break a sweat."
,thunderbum,2010-04-02T03:45Z,"Poor little dickhead with TWP. I daresay he's also Obsessive-Compulsive and quite likely a sociopath.

Gets kicks from swearing, loves to imagine he destroys people, and I think the only thing that you fcuk is your right hand.

That last set of retorts was the funniest yet, pencil dick. I'd say keep it up, but you'd probably need a magnifying glass, tweezers, string and some pepper! LMAO @ U."
,booboo332,2010-04-02T04:13Z,"TD - ""I am not here all day long like yourself. I make time to work, go to the mall, play video games, fuck my girlfriend, even go to the fair...You on the other hand are here everyday like you are reporting for work . . . you spend all your time fighting with people you dont know""   

The few minutes I spend on these comments here is hardly ""all day long"" or  ""all my time"".  We all have lives, tricky and you seem surprisingly eager to make unfounded assumptions about mine.

TD - ""I like to describe myself as Clint Eastwood.""  

The funniest part about this comment is that Clint usually describes himself as a libertarian and he endorsed McCain.  Yeah, Yeah, I know, you are referring to the ""Clint Eastwood"" character type, not his politics but the comment still made me chuckle.

TD - ""I goto the message board and expresses my opinion...But get attacked not based on fact but on Personal issues""

You yourself seem to enjoy attacking others personally and usually just seem to show up to post something inflammatory and declare self appointed victories.  It's your right but honestly, you don't have any high ground here.

TD - ""Like Eastwood, I destroy my enemies with fact they dont get from Rush""

Do you realize that saying you ""destroy your enemies"" makes you sound like a cartoon super-villian, but hey, whatever floats your boat.   And what do you hope to achieve by trying to ""destroy your enemies with facts (Huh?) they don't get from Rush""?  Did you really think that one through? 

""Nonetheless, you have earn half a point for efforts..53-2½ (53 KO's)""

Oh, come on.  Now you're just getting silly."
