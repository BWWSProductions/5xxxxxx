"
,5a5a5,2010-03-29T10:02Z,"Thanks, at the rate it's showing up for me it should be up by tomorrow. I'm not complaining, that's what I was hoping for at the least. I appreciate the upload.

I'm not sure about the blazing speeds some are talking about but whatever as long as it works eventually.

@ Coolboy_20, I am assuming this torrent is real. That being said, it's actually very close to 2 gigs, not 1 gig, which is not off for something 4 hours long in most cases. I have downloaded quit a few movies about 2 hours long that were about 700 meg in decent quality. Now, if this turns out to not work, I still think the size is realistic."
[V],RR-NE,2010-03-29T10:05Z,"i was at this.. amazing show.
11th wwe show but first ppv event"
,pti08024,2010-03-29T10:23Z,"thx for the upload natureboy!!! cant wait for it to finish downloading..... please people, dont limit your upload speed, it does not affect how quick your down speed is. my down is 45kbs yet my up is 400kbs... comon guys lets share fair."
,5a5a5,2010-03-29T10:25Z,"@ RAYMONDryche, thanks for not posting any spoilers. I would love to see a Wrestlemania before I die. Even a pay-per-view would be great but Wrestlemania has got to be great."
,solutioN-Ghost,2010-03-29T10:27Z,so many leechers meh. not even one seeders active
,blueblood95,2010-03-29T12:46Z,Fucking seed ya free loading cunts.
,Coolboy_20,2010-03-29T13:04Z,@5a5a5:Yeah you are right it's close to 2 gb!  
,pti08024,2010-03-29T13:17Z,"ok not happy, stopped on 95.3%.. why is no-one seeding after that?"
,pti08024,2010-03-29T13:20Z,"no-one get to excited, it will stop at 95.3% as not one of the 15 people who have 100% can be bothered to share. I so badly want to see this........"
,pti08024,2010-03-29T14:18Z,"great all done now. for all of you who are stuck at around 96%, just go to overtopropetorrents.com , register an account, its free! then look for the same file as you are downloading, you torrent client will check what you have already downloaded and then within seconds you will have 700+ seeders for the last little bit. Boom Boom..... gonna watch it now!!"
,Gesusoliver,2010-03-29T16:04Z,you people really need to start fricken seeding
,username9900123,2010-03-29T16:31Z,"use this list. not all work, but some good ones tho

,username9900123,2010-03-29T16:35Z,"btw, overtopropetorrents is a cool site, but this torrent is somehow diferent (even tho file sizes match) when adding their tracker to this torrent, is says invalid torrent. ? ? ?
i dont understn why. same file list, file sizes, torrent file name,everything.

but the list i posted has more connected seeders at faster speed.

but if u like wrestling, u should totally check out that site."
,torrtruk,2010-03-29T17:38Z,thanks man.
,McNavdo,2010-03-29T17:40Z,"seriously, you should all just register at overtopropetorrents.com i did just to see if it was any faster and it was alot faster, i managed to download it in under an hour at 500Kb per sec, "
,wrcpsm26,2010-03-29T17:41Z,"good quality
seeding @ ~3mb/s
those complaining, be sure to practice what you preach."
,wrcpsm26,2010-03-29T17:44Z,"btw, it took me 3 hrs to download without registering at the website mentioned above."
,rajan04735,2010-03-29T17:53Z,"Is there any 720p version out?
Thnx 4 this btw :-)"
,cactus316,2010-03-29T18:02Z,"does this torrent get stuck on purpose so peeps register at the advertised site??. Most of the torrents posted by natureboy in the last month have this overthetop site advertised..can anyone that hasn't registered on that site tell us if they have managed to download and watch this torrent.

Like many here I would like to use piratebay to download and not a site ive never heard of"

,TheAnt317,2010-03-30T01:19Z,"Yes this is real. Some parts are cut out, notably the very beginning (but the singing of America the Beautiful is still mostly in) and maybe a few second skips between video files. Other than that, perfect! 

I was surprised not only to see this up just an hour after the show finished, but that there are no spoilers in the comments!"
,stangkill3r1980,2010-03-30T02:01Z,been downloading since 730 this fucking morning what the fuck is the fucking problem i just started to re down load cuz i would only let me dlfor six seeders when there is 3108

,cactus316,2010-03-30T10:31Z,i gave up after 15 hours and less than half a file. guess theres no wrestlmania for me this year..well not untill ive read some of that big ass disclaimer on the overtoprope shite..why o why isnt a fast download available here..anyone know of any other download sites that might have wrestlemania??. one like here that dont require mandatory registration and contain some huge disclaimer!!!
,Intox123,2010-03-30T14:39Z,I don't know about you all but I'm getting damn tired of John Cena keep on getting titles just thrown to him at least Triple H and Ric Flair actually had to work for them. But anyways thanks for the upload. Farewell Shawn aka H.B.K
