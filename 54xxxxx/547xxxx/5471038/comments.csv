,JrodStewart,2010-07-01T23:55Z,This game was better than Final Fight because of the music and the ridiculous special attacks. Although a mayor who injects steroids into his balls whilst wearing suspenders and beating the shit out of the populace is also a huge selling point....

This collection of music is absolute brilliance, i loved playing streets of rage when i was a kid and the music is awesome, i tried to download the original soundtracks but it seems to be impossible, these remastered tracks have really made me happy, thanks for taking the time and effort to make this collection, peace dude, Kylos"
