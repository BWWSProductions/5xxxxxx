Yuzo Koshiro & Motohiro Kawashima - Streets Of Rage I + II + III OSV
Vertiphon 2010 Remasters

NOTICE: This is "version 2".  If you have the previous one and you're happy with it, keep it, but I wasn't.  Koshiro used some pretty harsh hi-hats and I've gone and dipped them throughout the songs.  And I noticed that some tracks were distorting.  So yeah the old one sucked, sorry about that.  Fixed a mistake in the art for SOR1 and SOR3, also.

This torrent contains the 66 tracks that make up the Original Sound Version soundtracks of the three Sega Genesis Streets Of Rage games.  Light remastering, a solid bass end to worry your subs, and enough punch to make The Advent quake on his turntables.  IMHO the copies of the sountracks available for download currently are [I]horrible[/I], and drastically required some low-end punch and boosted treble.  But NONE of the material here is taken from the officially released SOR audio CDs.  This is all VGM renders, and then 24-bit-quality remastering.

A couple of tracks from the SOR1 CD are not included here because I don't wish to remaster officially released sources, and put this even further into a copyright grey area.  Also, the SOR3 soundtrack order is a mess on the official CD, so I've taken the liberty to reorder the songs so that they broadly follow the gameplay.  However even then, some tracks are re-used, so try not to think about that too much!

I don't need to say much more, this is Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima. This is Streets Of Rage, and it's awesome.
