[V],GoodFilms,2010-04-02T20:21Z,nice uploads. wudnt mind knowing the bit rates myself.. 
[V],GoodFilms,2010-04-02T20:22Z,much more useful than release dates
[V],GoodFilms,2010-04-02T21:54Z,"first thing i check is the vid bit rate. i don't see how it's so hard to fill it in on one release where the nfo was blank. no need to make such a stink. your uploads are appreciated, but your attitude isnt"
,heretic576,2010-04-02T22:55Z,"dude, they are just interested in the bitrate. nothing to get all bent out of shape about. 

there is a repack of this anyway

here is the info FOR THE REPACK, NOT FOR THIS RELEASE:

[V],-jonny-,2010-04-02T22:59Z,Just stick to this one. The nuke/repack is absolutely pointless.

,NewDust,2010-05-27T13:07Z,"Screw this! this ain't The Lovely Bones, it's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!

I don't know why it it shows HP instead of the lovely bones and reading the previous comments I'm the firts to have this. Torrent seemed alright at first.

Anyone know what happend?"
,NewDust,2010-05-27T14:03Z,"Disregard my previous comment, now it plays fine. Still don't know what happend though."
,teabag87,2010-06-11T14:40Z,"i know this has nothing to do with the uploader, and i am not a troll/spammer.  BUT, I got a letter from my IP regarding this download.  Kinda funny since felony is in the file's title.  Just a heads up that its being watched/tracked"
,nuggz,2010-06-21T00:43Z,"@teabag87:

Get Peerblock, and also consider using an ipfilter. Peerblock is a must though.."
,movieaholic30,2010-07-20T14:01Z,"Excellent movie and download, Anyone know where i could get the second disc with the bonus features since they decided not to put the 2 disc in regular dvd form? Love this movie and want the special features! Thanx"
