A 1998 swedish game set in a medieval world where the Church of The One and the nobles struggle for power while the Iron Gate that kept the Darkness sealed away has been reopened. 

The setting, while the nobility and the Church are quite similar to Earth's medieval times, features an unusual take on elves and dwarves.
