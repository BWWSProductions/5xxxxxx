I don't know if it's worth posting this album again, but it is one of my favourites in the Jazz/Rock-Fusion genre. When you are well acquainted with fusion acts like Return To Forever, Mahavishnu Orchestra or Weather Report and don't know anything about Brand-X, shame on you! This effort is their first and probably one of the bestfusion ever. Don't miss this great album.
