Enjoy!

Missing US 011 The Great Steamboat Race is in Set 7.

Set 7 now available.
Set 4 is being checked over.
I am still putting together set 8-12.  

Found an excellent free disney comics website for updates.
Much thanks goes to that guy who has posted many more recent 
scans of wdc&s stories.  It gives me a quite a few more comics
to update though.


For set 11, I am encoding mkv videos of Carl Barks' Donald Duck 
short videos from the Chronological Donald Duck. 4+gb of cartoons.
(7.9 GB)
 
For set 12, I can put together Carl Barks' Ducktales .mkv 
videos from the DVDs.


The CBDA collection will be complete, but if you can find better scans 
than posted within this collection, then
please leave a message and post up your comic scans.


I will update this list as I go along.
Thanks for helping!
