,thunderbum,2010-04-01T22:21Z,Finally! *Phew* Viva El Rushbo and jwhitt! :)
,protongeek,2010-04-01T22:47Z,Sweet thanks jhwitt!
,protongeek,2010-04-01T22:48Z,Im not a fan of Mark Steyn. I guess the guys from Canada and Britain like him but I like Rush and then Hannity. Savage just gets a lil old with the yelling.
,Johannes58,2010-04-01T22:48Z,thanks from a conservative in Germany!
,booboo332,2010-04-01T23:20Z,"Savage is probably still whining about the whole ""Banned in Britain"" thing.  I definitely think it is bullshit the way he was lumped in with terrorists and other scum and their reasons for not letting him in were pretty weak.

I caught a little bit of one of his shows about a month ago and he was still going on about it and pushing his book.  The way he responded really didn't endear me to his cause.

However, it is sad how the British politicians will allow Islamists who openly call for the death of their Prime Minister and other violence but deny entry to Savage.

It is also pathetic how the media overlooks the thugs, racist bigots and segregationists of groups like the Black Panthers but get all twisted up over guys like Savage.


Thanks to the uploader."
,Tainan,2010-04-02T00:56Z,"Thanks JW.

Welcome Johannes.

Savage has his place, but I have never been able to listen to him for more than about 10 minutes.
Fingernails on the chalkboard kind of thing."
,booboo332,2010-04-02T03:00Z,"Though I don't think he's the best host, my money's on Levin for the smartest.  I disagree with Rush on some issues but I find Rush to be the best host.  I'd also rate Boortz as the last one I'd want to get into an argument with.

I am sure if everyone that posts here were to list their favs and why we like them, it would vary quite a bit.

On the other side, I'd have to say out of the liberal talkshow hosts I have tried to listen to, Randi Rhodes is the one best at making my ears bleed."
,thunderbum,2010-04-02T03:38Z,"@booboo: I noticed you used the term 'islamists'. What I don't understand is why the media in general uses that term. What those homicidal bastards really are are Muslims. So why the confusing term?

It's trendy words like islamists, journalists who are 'imbeded' (like a sliver), or using idiotic terms like 'phalangists (which can also refer to fingers) as opposed to phalanxes, and 'insurgents' when what they should say is what they mean: enemies.

Any thoughts? Anyone?"
[T],jwhitt62,2010-04-02T04:19Z,"Wow, there are conservatives in Germany? Why don't the three of you get together and form a club or something."
,booboo332,2010-04-02T04:59Z,"@thunderbum  -  What's confusing about it?  It is pretty clear what religion they follow and you knew what I who I was referring to.  Hell, once upon a time they were called Muhammedans and Moslems.  Some refer to politically active Muslims as Islamists but I honestly don't think it is that big of a deal.

It is good to call bullshit on the euphemisms, confusing terminology and PC nonsense but I really don't think the term is in the same league as the other words you mention.  Those terms are indeed absurd but it's not like I used a bullshit term like ""overseas contingency operation"" or ""collateral damage"". 

Honestly, man, there are battles that are worth the time and energy but I just don't think the word ""Islamist"" is one of them."
,spelz,2010-04-02T06:05Z,Long Live the Uploader!!!
,gordonl,2010-04-02T06:19Z,Thanks for the Rush.  I would at this time like to apologize to our American brethren for the Speech Nazis here in Canada who tried to intimidate Ann Coulter at the U of Ottawa.  The political correctness in the West is truly over the top.
,fizdude,2010-04-02T06:46Z,"Nice, thanks!!"
,thunderbum,2010-04-02T22:03Z,"@booboo: you're right, of course in your explanation. It's just that sometimes smaller, aggravating points are like burrs under my saddle.

Yesterday I wasn't having one of my better days (idiots at work driving me nuts).

Cheers :)    (in a great mood today! )"
,booboo332,2010-04-03T00:46Z,"@thunderbum - No sweat man, we all have days like that.  Have a great and hopefully long weekend my friend."
