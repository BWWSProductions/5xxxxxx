Since 2004, Tunebite has been named the best universal converter and program for removing copy protection legally several times over!

27 virtual soundcards provide high speed digital dubbing of legal re-recordings of copy protected songs at 54 times the speed. A virtual CD burner takes care of audiobooks quickly. Several audio recordings and partial recordings in several steps ensure that films are of the highest quality when re-recording them and converting DRM copy protected media. 

In order to maintain our standard of quality for music, audiobooks, videos and films, Tunebite has innovative features that no other software has. Converting files while sacrificing quality is not in our M.O. Therefore, there is a promise of quality with PerfectAudio and a perfected process, which only allows for the very best results. It also informs you of problems encountered during the conversion process and offers tips for support.

In order to legally remove copy protection from films via re-recording, films must be photographed frame by frame during playback. The higher the definition of the film (e.g. HD), the greater your PCâ€™s operational capabilities have to be. Such a process quickly pushes affordable PCs to their limits. But even here, Tunebite has a solution that no other software can provide.

The highest possible user friendliness and the simplest operation of the program are guaranteed via pre-configured formats for many device types. You do not need to know all the technical details of your device, you just simply need to select your device.
