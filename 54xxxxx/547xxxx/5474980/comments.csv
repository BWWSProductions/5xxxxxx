,Muggi-DK,2010-04-01T05:25Z,Is this really working on Win 7 ?
[T],artpepper,2010-04-01T06:07Z,"I couldn't say, @Muggi. It claims to work on Win 7, but I don't use 7. I'm still happy with XP Pro. Let me know how you get on and I'll amend the info accordingly..."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-01T09:49Z,"@Muggi-Google is your friend. I found lots of discussions of problems and solutions re: Tunebite 7 + Windows 7. This is a good place to start:

That is 7.2.9800.0"
,duvasae,2010-08-26T13:02Z,"after i installed this on my windows 7 machine i got a message telling me that this version of tunebite was illegal.  tried reinsalling but got the same message.  i haven't updated the programme and selected not to update.
any solutions?  thanks in advance"
,vikysaran,2011-11-20T05:39Z,"yes it is working for win 7
i have faced the issue of illegal copy on my xp machine so i installed this copy after disconnecting from internet.
then after full installation i unchecked the automatic update button inside settings options. It is working well."
,xxeonabyssxx,2012-06-18T06:46Z,this works with win 7. but if i try to convert a lot of protected files ill get a windows media revocation and renewal pop up and ill have to restart my pc same with aimersoft converter. can any one shine some light as to that if theres a way around it. thanks for program i like it better cuz its converts faster then the others
