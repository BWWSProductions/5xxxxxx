                    Liam befriends World War Two veteran, Reggie,  
                    to help him with a school project. Troubled and  
                    lonely without his sister and fed up with  
                    Libby's well-intentioned interference at home,  
                    Liam finds solace in his friendship with the  
                    old man. But when Libby spies on Liam and his  
                    secret friend, she jumps to the all the wrong  
                    conclusions - leading to a tragic confrontation  
                    between the Gallaghers and Reggie. Maxine is  
                    shocked when her brother, Bruce turns up  
                    sporting a black eye claiming a homophobic  
                    attack by his own dad, but her loyalties are  
                    tested when she confronts their father and  
                    discovers the real story. Bruce's arrival as an  
                    openly gay man on Chatsworth agitates the  
                    locals and he quickly outstays his welcome at  
                    Ian's house, but charms his way into Mimi's  
                    heart and the Jockey, leaving Micky teetering  
                    on the brink of a nervous breakdown. Meanwhile,  
                    Karen is put out when Joe appears to have moved  
                    on by taking control of his life and attending  
                    anger management classes.
