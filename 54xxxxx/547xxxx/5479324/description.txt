A very interesting documentary about the disaster (a gas leak) at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India.

Recommended together with: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3957480/One_Night_In_Bhopal_%28Indian_Industrial_Accident%29 which is also about this accident.

=== Background ===

I've been looking for Seismic seconds episodes myself and this was the one I was most interested in. I finally found it on a video site and downloaded it from there, in the highest quality available. While this quality isn't very good in general, it is definitively watchable. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been looking for this, so here it is! Credit goes to "utubekhiladi" for uploading it to the site where I found it originally.

=== Description ===

"In Bhopal, India, lethal methyl isocyanate gas was accidentally released from a pesticides plant run by a subsidiary of Union Carbide. Between 2,500 and 5,000 people in Bhopal died on the day of the disaster, and thousands more have died since from ill-effects." - Wikipedia
