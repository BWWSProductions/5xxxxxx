,phasar,2010-05-06T01:32Z,"It doesn't work

All my Xilisoft products became (unregistered) today. Even with ""Check for updates"" turned off, the software seems to be checking with their server to verify serial numbers"
[T],whodathoughtit,2010-05-07T00:30Z,"@phasar 
It works fine for me"
,anuskasvo,2010-06-20T15:12Z,"Just make sure the firewall doesnt allow the program to connect to internet, then it works and doesnt get unregistered."
[T],TalmudTimmy,2010-06-27T08:03Z,"Thanks, works great!"
,khaalid69,2010-07-11T20:19Z,how do i purchase this? i tried but they only have v6 available and i want v5.....i tried to dl it but after a while it just unregistered itself
,InThis_Nightmare,2010-07-27T19:11Z,How do i block it with a firewall?
,InThis_Nightmare,2010-07-30T00:19Z,i like to let the keygen run so i can listen to the music :D
,coltrane1825,2010-09-09T04:32Z,"I just installed with no problem. Just don't get confused when selecting the product. It's a long list. The Windows 7 firewall seems to block the program automatically, but I always disconnect  from the internet when first starting the program as a precaution. This is a good program, but really slow. I have a AMD 3.3GHz x4 processor and it still took an hour to rip a DVD at highest quality."
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2010-09-28T22:03Z,Malwarebytes scanner shows the keygen to contain a trojan.c I did find that the serials posted at serials.ws do work with this program however
