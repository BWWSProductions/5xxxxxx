I'm confused(nothing new).I just found out that this show is a sequel to 'Life on Mars' which I really enjoyed.I believe the version I saw was the American one.It had a very good final episode that explained everything.Now, to enjoy this series am I supposed to pretend that the final Americanized version never happened?Help!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-02T19:45Z,"@lilars: Well, Life on Mars is legendary UK series. Americanized version is plain rubbish. Original (two seasons, each eight episodes) is definitely one of the best TV series of all times.
There are BluRay rips and DVD XviD rips, and you should find it and download maybe first episode alone, just to see if it ""clicks"" for you."
,globu,2010-04-02T20:48Z,"Yes, you are required to forget the US version ever existed. It is among the many US copies which should never have existed. That said, the US version is probably closer to an original story if there was one -- it was all a dream is kind of ending Hollywood's fear of censorship that ruined many of its productions. (How can you spoil a spoiler?)

That said, the Brit version is worth the time but the take on old-time Brit police methods and events does not quite work in the US which at least justified a US version. Learning ""they were like us"" is not the same as remembering ""we were like that."" "
,lilars26,2010-04-02T20:55Z,Thanks guys.I'll check it out.
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-02T21:12Z,"Oh, I just remembered... it was 'cause and during the writers strike. No none knew how long they will need to reach agreement 'bout 0.0001 % plus or minus and suits went Europe.
Rest is one piece of ... history."
,mdaddio,2010-04-02T22:53Z,thanks so much 20/40!!
,mdaddio,2010-04-03T00:44Z,"This is not a request, i was just wondering if you were gonna do the New season of dr who.? That show pretty good."
,tdatb,2010-04-03T00:57Z,"The American version wasn't terrible - until the final episode! - it was just nowhere near as good as the British original.

That being said, one must also admit that Ashes to Ashes is not terribly good. Were it not for the Gene Hunt redux, even Keeley Hawes' delicious cleavage wouldn't be enough to make this show worth going out of your way to watch.

I give the original ""Life on Mars"" a ""10 out of 10"" for originality of concept, brilliant writing, and even more brilliant acting. I give the American version a ""6.5"" after a 1-point deduction for some rather bad casting choices, (Michael Imperioli?!? Dumping Colm Meaney for Harvey Keitel?!?) and ignoring the final episode, (which gets a ""0""!). ""Ashes to Ashes"" gets a ""7"", (is anyone else as thoroughly annoyed with that friggin' clown as I am???,) mostly based on Philip Glenister's great work."
,globu,2010-04-03T09:18Z,"Agreed that Ashes is not in the league with Mars. 

First we know what is going on which we sort of do for Mars -- whatever the last ep meant. So the opening expectation is to see how a liberated feminist handles things. I really didn't care. But she seems to know something about Mars so its last ep could not have happened the way I took it. 

Second, I agree the casting went downhill. 
Second and a half they also became more British in the way that doesn't play as well in the US. I do not particularly like Brit productions so a show has to have some merit beyond being a comfortable filler as are many of the US shows I watch. Given the kind of commercials that run on BBC America Cable they are not making much money so there is no need to consider the US market -- or maybe they should start. 

Third it took three eps before I got into the series and after replaying the first two. I'm still not sure what I was missing. 

All said, it turned out to be worth the time to watch the rest. I intend to watch this season. 

One hopes there is an explanation why it is a cop again. If it keeps up the entire idea will appear to be no more than a gimmick to portray old time, romanticized street justice of right wingers -- wild west sheriffs with cars. 

I would not be adverse to this series ending with the discovery of a far future group experimenting sending police back in time leading to a third series trying to find out who. Think the Riverworld series."
