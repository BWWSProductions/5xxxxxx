The ubiquitous Bud Shank played on many of Marty Paich's sessions, including this West Coast answer to BIRTH OF THE COOL, Actually that isn't strictly true. The whole West Coast scene starting with the Mulligan-Baker Quartet was perhaps an answer to Miles Davis's 1949 sessions. But ART PEPPER + ELEVEN is more accurately described as a brilliantly executed *homage* to bebop itself--to pure jazz composition with fresh treatments of "Anthropology," "Round Midnight," and Denzil Best's "Move," which opens BOTC as well. 



Of course, it's most of all a showcase for Art Pepper, the greatest mainstream alto player since Charlie Parker. The arrangements themselves are brisk, energetic, and thoroughly in the tradition. Whatever else he was, Art Pepper was no romantic lyricist so there are no dreamy settings here, the kind Gil Evans might write, or any other experimental voicings, the kind Stan Kenton loved. Marty Paich was a different type of modernist.
