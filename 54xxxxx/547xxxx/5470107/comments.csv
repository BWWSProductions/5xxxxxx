,shinobiung,2010-03-30T12:34Z,"actually its originally from the yanks, YOU FOOL"
,netrek,2010-04-02T12:49Z,Um the original show is the American one! Donald Trump started the Apprentice. Maybe you are thinking of Dragon's Den. The British and Australian Apprentice series came years after the American one which is the original.
,shinobiung,2010-04-05T18:11Z,"the british apprentice is about as exciting as english fish and chips, ie its shit and people who eat shit all their lives dont know any better. And Alan sugar is a Zionist and about as british as Argentina"
