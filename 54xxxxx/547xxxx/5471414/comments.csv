,DemonZee,2010-03-30T02:26Z,This movie is so fucking sweet!! :D
,Impul5se,2010-03-31T13:03Z,@DemonZee: I know! Can't wait to see it again! I was lucky enough to see it at the European premiere with most of the cast! Brilliant atmosphere!
,eLitePunK,2010-04-01T18:43Z,"ahh man when is this going to be cammed already, its already in theatres in uk right?"
,Impul5se,2010-04-01T21:56Z,"@Joeblowmoe: No problem, I was trying to download it and realised it wasn't on here so I thought I'd upload it as soon as I bought it!
Yeah, I had to line up for ages to see Mark Miller and John Romita Jr the day before the premiere at a signing but it was definitely worth it!

@eLitePunK: Yeah, it came out yesterday in the UK so a CAM can't be too far away, I highly recommend seeing it at the cinema if you can though! Just for other peoples reactions throughout the film!"
,bowieboots,2010-04-02T04:40Z,Ace film.  Just looked on play.com.  Soundtrack has 22 songs so why only 13 here?
,jace007,2010-04-05T02:36Z,"First of all, I was also at the European premiere (and have Facebook pics to prove it!) Thanks to whoever pointed out this OST is actually made-up of 22 tracks (this DL is missing the music where Nic Cage is taking out the gangsters). Also, I suggest you replace Bad Reputation with the original Joan Jett's version; not the lame Hit Girls attempt! "
[T],FrodooBagginz,2010-04-05T10:57Z,"Not sure how many songs are in the movie, however, every site that I have been to only shows the soundtrack (that you purchase on disc) as having 14 tracks.  A lot of the times, not all music from the films are included on their Soundtracks that you can purchase.

As for the Joan Jett version. Replace the Hit Girls version with the Joan Jett version? Are you serious? The Hit Girls version is on the official soundtrack and I would assume that it is the version heard in the movie as well since it is included on the OST. "

,atomo360,2010-04-16T02:21Z,"Just downloaded it heard it, perfect :)"
,corybrum,2010-04-18T02:36Z,"you wouldn't happen to have the ""how to train your dragon"" soundtrack would you?"
,Mosstromo,2010-04-19T14:15Z,"This OST as the film and the comic, do as they say: Kick-Ass brutally!!! Thanks a lot for the upload man (or madame)!!!"
,jochem678,2010-04-25T14:50Z,One thing... why on EARTH is this movie rated 12+ in freakin' Europe! (America: Rated R for brutal violence)
,LordReserei,2010-05-22T01:56Z,"@Lideln 

The music from that scene is actually from 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later, so it can be found on those soundtracks

Track 18 on 28 Days Later
Track 1 on 28 Weeks Later

I don't know why they didn't include it in this soundtrack because it's definitely a powerful piece. "
,asfbr,2010-06-24T19:06Z,does anyone know where to find the missing tracks?
,asfbr,2010-06-24T19:09Z,"just pointing out: the 'bad reputation' played in the movie is the joan jett's version, not the one included here."
,xsoccer92x,2010-07-07T20:55Z,"@asfbr
if you google kickass - the score on the first torrent you can get all the other mp3s from the movie"
,chick_flick,2011-03-05T19:46Z,"all the missing tracks: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5578692/Kick-Ass__The_Score

,maattmaann,2011-07-22T14:51Z,"Just gonna point out. There is the soundtrack with these 14 songs, There is also a Kick-ass score which has all the other music in it"
