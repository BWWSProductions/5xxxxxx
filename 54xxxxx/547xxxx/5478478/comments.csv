,xdaxdb,2010-04-03T12:14Z,"It's good, not sure why it was so difficult to download.

why do people split these up into .rar ? its lossy video people, you can't compress it anymore."
,Zagubadu,2010-04-03T18:48Z,Jeez almost thought it was fake. In the beginning they show ( You know when the recap the last 1 or 2 episodes ) the part where his wife dies I was so pissed thought this was a way older episode. Anyways its good legit A 9 V 9. Only thing is its a MKV file so it doesn't look like a video file but it is. IF you have Windows media player all you need to do is download a codec pack. Simply Google matroska media player codec and its the first links. Didn't think this was legit. Nice Time!
