Apocalypse Nerd is a six-issue comic book limited series created by Peter Bagge and published by Dark Horse Comics.

The story revolves around two men, Perry and Gordo, attempting to survive in the wilds of the Pacific Northwest after Seattle is destroyed in a North Korean nuclear attack. Perry is a somewhat introverted computer programmer whilst his longtime friend Gordo works in various "self-employed" fields and is also a drug dealer. The story is a masculine character study as the two evolve and adapt to the changes in the post-apocalyptic world.

The end of every main chapter is followed by a story of the American Founding Fathers. These are somewhat humorous and based on actual events.

Apocalypse Nerd has been adapted into a six-episode television series entitled Fallout by the BBC, which should air later this year.
