If you're downloading this season, chances are you've already downloaded the others as well.  So I won't go on about unimportant details.  I think (at least I hope) you'll enjoy the quality.

Please seed when you are done...I good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded...thanks!!


p.s. ATT PS3 MEDIA SERVER (which I use for these) USERS : Make sure to disable ASS/SSA Subtitles.  Also if using MEncoder, if you have problems with audio sync, try unchecking AV/Sync Alternative Method.
