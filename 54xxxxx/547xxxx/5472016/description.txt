Wikipedia - The Traveling Wilburys Collection is a 2007 box set compilation album comprising both albums by the Traveling Wilburys, a DVD with their videos and a documentary about the group. The set was released June 12, 2007 by Rhino, in association with Wilbury Records.[1]The album went straight to number 1 in several countries. Though the original issues enjoyed success, this re-release reached even greater heights, quickly topping the UK Albums Chart, the Australian ARIA Charts, Ireland's Albums Chart, New Zealand's Albums Chart, Apple's iTunes, and Amazon's pre-order and sales list. In its first week, the set sold over 110,000 copies. In the United States, the set managed to peak at #9 in Billboard's Billboard 200 album chart, beating the record held by the Nirvana box set With the Lights Out for highest debut of a box set. It also set the biggest first week UK sales for a box set. Over 1,827,000 copies have been sold worldwide to date, equating to over 5.8 million discs total. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 chart on June 30, 2007 at number 9, with sales of 77,787 copies. It remained on the chart for 13 weeks.

Amazon.com Review By Hal Horowitz - The Traveling Wilburys were one of the few supergroups that lived up to their promise, because they didn't try to. Things started inauspiciously when George Harrison, needing a B-side for a 1988 single, called in friends Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Roy Orbison for assistance. Two albums later--the second without Orbison, who had passed away shortly after the first was released--the loose-knit collective had recorded material that was as durable, and occasionally eclipsed, the participants' legendary solo work. The Wilburys succeeded due to a genial and contagious camaraderie that permeates both discs. What could have been a train wreck of ego clashes instead resulted in a frothy meeting of the minds. These guys are having a blast, trading lead vocals and harmonies on energetic folk-rock, quirky rockabilly, and Beatlesque pop that shimmers with the respect and esteem the members clearly hold for each other. Harrison and Lynne's rather slick production polishes off edges that might better have been left unvarnished, but there's no denying the loosey-goosey craftsmanship at work in tunes such as "Handle with Care," "End of the Line," and a striking Orbison performance on "Not Alone Anymore" that ranks with any of his finest. Both albums were million-sellers, but oddly went out of print for about a decade until Rhino resurrected them, adding two rare tracks per disc as well as a DVD of music videos and a band documentary. The resulting package is a comprehensive overview of a once--well, twice--in-a-lifetime project that, especially after Harrison's passing, will never be repeated.
