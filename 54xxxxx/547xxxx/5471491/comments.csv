Microsoft Windows 7 Activator V2 WiN7ALL Incl Patcher-ACTiVATiNG
Found trojan inside, deleted torrent."

It probaly isn't a trojan. It is becouse it is a program that does things on his own way (getting serial codes), so your virusscanner says it's a trojan. Easy as that."
,gateway2heaven,2011-10-28T18:26Z,"Okay, after a while, I started getting a dialog saying that Windows cannot be activated.  I checked my license saying that I had 1 to 3 days remaining until ""automatic activation"" and even that wouldn't go through.  Of course, even the ""rearm"" trick didn't actually help either.  So this is what I did (and read this carefully):

[1] I opened CMD and typed ""slmgr.vbs -upk""

[2] Reboot.

[3] A dialog should appear asking me to enter a product key but there should be an option called ""Ask me later"".  I did click that!

[4] Another dialog appeared about the importance of genuine software and yadda-yadda, so I clicked ""Continue.""

[5] I was able to continue using Windows under non-genuine restrictions, just to re-run the tools under the BIE directory.

It appeared that Windows was once again activated and things seem to be working fine."
