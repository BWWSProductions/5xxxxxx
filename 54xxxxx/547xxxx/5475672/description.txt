Diaspora is a role-playing game that uses the FATE system to deliver a hard science-fiction framework for adventure, where you build the setting on top of the basic, gritty axioms of the universe: everything is bigger than you are. You will pilot spacecraft driven by fusion torches that light the night sky towards rifts in the fabric of space that shift you between a small number of lost worlds, each with thousands of years of history. And it's all yours.

Although Diaspora is based on FATE, it is a complete game requiring no other purchases to play. You will need dice, pen, paper, and friends, but all the rules you need are right here.

Diaspora is the brainchild of three frustrated classic Traveller players, Brad Murray, C. W. Marshall, Tim Dyke, and Byron Kerr. While work in earnest began in 2007, it can reasonably be said that the seeds for the project were already sprouting in 1980.
