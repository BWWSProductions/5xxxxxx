The Upsessions are an early reggae-styled band from Haarlem and Amsterdam. They were founded in 2005 by trombone player Giel (former member of Amsterdam-based ska band De Hardheid) and lead vocalist Boss (former bassplayer of Rude Rich and the High Notes). After playing Hollandâ€™s biggest ska festival, Dutchska (along side big names such as The Moon Invaders, Intensified and Winston Francis), they went international, playing in France, Switzerland, Belgium and several festivals (This-Is-Ska and Summer Safari) in Germany. In September 2006, the Upsessions signed a contract offered by legendary UK Ska record label â€˜MoonSkaWorldâ€™, who released their debut album, â€˜The New Heavyweight Championâ€™, in 2007.
