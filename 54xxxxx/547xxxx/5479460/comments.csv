,RALSTON8358,2010-04-03T21:43Z,"Thanks I will have a look at that, I live in Australia (from London though) over here they just throw the seeds in the back garden and they grow, got a mate from Yorkshire who plants them behind a garage and a fence and they grow very well. Thanks again for all your good work."
,bubblegumjimmy,2010-04-03T21:52Z,"This is a fake.
It uses the beginning of the sneek peak and then episode 2x12."

,threecard,2010-07-07T07:58Z,"Please, asshat, could you explain to me why you would think that anyone would want to watch a trailer instead of downloading the actual episode? Get the fuck! Don't bother downloading, it's a couple of minutes of play time then a commercial. You'd have better luck with Megavideo or another torrent. What a dick..."
,baybreeze,2010-07-31T22:45Z,This is a complete first show of the season with a short trailer at the end of it. I don't understand why someone is writing otherwise.
,Andy_Rampage,2010-12-27T17:10Z,THX albiondean for fulfilling my 'fix' of THE DOCTOR!!
,bluebreard,2011-05-21T11:22Z,"i cant d/l this, keeps saying problem connecting to tracker operation timed out, its been like that for weeks"
