,jackamo,2010-03-31T03:15Z,"Thanks for the heads up over the early showing in Canada, I was astonished how quick this had appeared. All kudos must go to the legendary EZTV, its going to be so sad when this last series ends, best Lost season ever!"
,dark_isle,2010-03-31T03:16Z,Damn EZ! That's fast! My jaw's still on the floor when Widmore opened that locked door in the submarine and it was Aaron and Ji Yeon inside! Such a Man from Tallahassee moment! And  I was totally convinced it was Desmond too! Omg did he kidnap them?? What an asshole! Too bad Jack's dying though spoilers. 
,cafinatednarcotic,2010-03-31T03:32Z,why do you feel the constant need to show us how much of a wanker you are?  Go DL porn and post spoilers for that.  I can sure you would have more fun that way.
,jahnee,2010-03-31T03:33Z,720p pls
,masterersin,2010-03-31T03:41Z,"Because he is sad and has no life, the only enjoyment he gets is by ruining other people's.
Very.Sad.Indeed. Poor chap."
,jwords,2010-03-31T03:47Z,I officially now enjoy dark_isle more than the torrent.
,jahnee,2010-03-31T04:10Z,"dark_isle does this on purpose every time for his own amusement, in most moderated forums he would just get banned"
,gerenatal,2010-03-31T04:11Z,already? holy s#%@
,kickboy245,2010-03-31T04:22Z,eztv... you guys rock... keep up the good work
,sk74,2010-03-31T04:50Z,"Damn... I wasn't expecting this to be up so soon! Nice one eztv, you guys have delivered da goods yet again!"
,cafinatednarcotic,2010-03-31T05:36Z,"ya, I seldom actually read his posts.  I know he is full of sht, so just dismiss him.  Thing, he is never on, I doubt he actually watches any of this, and he is doing it strictly for attention.  Sad really - some people are that desperate."
,cafinatednarcotic,2010-03-31T07:07Z,"good show!  Great show!  I see the final confrontation building, and its promising to be good!"

,KwizatsHaderach,2010-03-31T20:34Z,"Immense thanks eztv, for once again going above and beyond.  
@ dark_isle Hilarious how many people still get angry at you. Thanks for the laughs."
,clipandgo,2010-03-31T22:38Z,I cant believe Desmond had gay sex with jin.
,christian199212,2010-03-31T22:59Z,thanks man
,VU7,2010-03-31T23:26Z,"Man, the reason I come here is to read dark_isle's hilarious comments. They're completely fake, unless people haven't picked up on that, yet..."
,Fostik,2010-04-01T00:43Z,thx
,apkonster,2010-04-01T01:39Z,I really hope Widmores homosexuality won't get in the way in his intentions to destroy Sawyer. They had a pretty hot time in that locked spank-chamber by the sounds of it --YESYES I WILL eat your yellow submarine... etc.
,jahnee,2010-04-01T02:45Z,this show is getting boring
,Colidez,2010-04-01T18:09Z,eztv is the best

,maxram2,2010-04-06T17:01Z,"@Burdurky; It's about these people on an island who do stuff and say things but never explain themselves properly.  I've seen every episode also and that's all I've gleaned.  As for your wife, your best bet is to smack her about until she makes you a turkey-pot-pie."
,rocco_sifredi,2010-04-07T00:50Z,thx a lot!
,adanackid,2010-04-09T01:19Z,Thanks.. great episode.
