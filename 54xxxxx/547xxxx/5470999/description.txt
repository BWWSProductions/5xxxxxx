A Partial Transcript Of The Audio
I was talking to someone yesterday who still did not yet realize that The Idaho Observer, a newspaper out of Idaho, is another of the alternative newspapers that is under the control of Zionists. The reason some people trust The Idaho Observer is that a couple years ago they were selling my book and DVD, and they even carried a couple articles of mine. However, Alex Jones, the American Free Press, and other people also sold my book a couple years ago. 
You can't judge a person, or an organization, by what they did a couple years ago. You have to look at everything they've been doing throughout their entire existence. If you do that with the Idaho Observer, or Alex Jones, or the American Free Press, and other truth seekers, then yoiu going to notice a pattern. The pattern is that during the past few years, virtually everybody in the so-called truth movement has been pretending I don't exist, or they're insulting me. This cannot be a coincidence because all of them are doing it. This has to be a coordinated effort. 
As I've mentioned before, different people should have different opinions. When you find people scattered all over the world promoting the exact same opinion, you have to suspect some sort of coordination. 
Years ago I trusted The Idaho Observer and lots of other people, but now it looks as if the only reason they were selling my book and DVD was to make some money and create the impression that they are honest investigators. However, the situation changed a couple of years ago. I think that's when the Zionists started to realize that they are being exposed, and they started to panic. They've been trying desperately to push me aside, and Christopher Bollyn, and promote their own agents as 9/11 investigators. 
It's also interesting that as these truth seekers were trying to push me aside, Daryl Smith began calling me on the phone and asked me to help him with his website and radio show.
