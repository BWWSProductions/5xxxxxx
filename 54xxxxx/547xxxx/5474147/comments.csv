Or something else caught my eye and I forget again to get back... or come to the end. I love to watch last few scenes then asking myself ""WTF... what happened...why for sake of god they haven't phoned each other or why she was dead and he just stands there... 
Yeah, I hate commercials, but I wanted to say something else.
But I forget what it was."
