        Jeremy, Richard and James head to the United States to see if 
        the Americans still make any good cars. Unfortunately, theres 
        a small error with their visas and the US immigration 
        authorities will only let them in if they promise not to do 
        anything entertaining. So, with serious faces on they set off 
        on a proper old fashioned muscle car road trip to the amazing 
        Bonneville salt flats. Along the way Richard becomes an 
        amateur aerodynamicist, Jeremy discovers a strange security 
        problem with one of their cars, and Captain Slow discovers a 
        hitherto hidden love of fast driving in what turns out to be a 
        dusty, dirty slice of pure car lovers heaven.

        This Director's Cut contains just the "film" from the episode 
        and not the guests or other segments. Tagged DC so that future 
        release of the full episode from R1 source will not dupe this.

        As this is from season 12, this was not filmed in HD and this 
        Blu-Ray source is simply upscaled and a 720p or 1080p transfer 
        can not be made.
