The free online game play URL the got sensored was Game Ranger, I don't want a TOS violation from TPB."
,SonJazrin,2010-04-01T05:01Z,"What do you mean ""free online game play?"" Online has no protections. It's free through gamespy anyway."
,tops.c,2010-04-01T14:19Z,"Yea I ran across game ranger on Utube it's free I have tryed to use gamespy it asks for a UN & PS which required a credit card, I'm no hardcore gamer but some of the latest games have been interesting, the ability to mod the Borderlands game is a good idea.  If Gamespy is free I wish someone else would confirm your statement SonJazrin, and I pretty sure Gamespy might require a software key, correct me if I'm wrong."
,SonJazrin,2010-04-01T17:17Z,"No credit card needed, you can make a free account either through the game or at gamespy's homepage. It will work just fine, trust me. I'm playing on a copy I got from TPB and using a gamespy log in I made back in the late 90's, it's all good baby."

If you're new to trying to mod borderlands, google Willowtree, the save game editor. From there you can google weapon parts from various sites and add them directly to the game.

Though IMO, the addition of knoxx and the 1.3 patch ruined borderlands, the ability to create insane, god killing weapons really added a lot of depth and dozens more hours of enjoyment to the game."
,tops.c,2010-04-01T21:20Z,"Yea they did that for a good reason back then the guns (however very cool) were disproportionately to big people would lose interest to the game to fast like the old days, thanks for the imput, the SMG that's included with this UL don't get much better, I hope Farcry 3 is simillar to Borderlands."
,tops.c,2011-05-25T15:37Z,I can't believe people are seeding this and still playing. 
,irishboyblue,2011-10-23T10:53Z,never stop playing this game ty for the files !
