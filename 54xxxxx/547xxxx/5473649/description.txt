This save file has a full set of the starter pokemon for use with HeartGold or SoulSilver.  Can be used on either and most likely the JP version as well.

All starters are Level 1 egg hatched, other than Pikachu which is level 10.  Look in the PC and you can see they are all in one box.  Also includes a level 1 Manaphy.  There are other cool pokemons on here like a lv 5 eevee as well and other cool ones.

If you have 2 DS you can trade them to a new game and start off with cool level 1 pokemon's.  You may be able to trade them with 1 DS using a SS game and a HG game and trading them through the GTS system though I haven't tried it.
