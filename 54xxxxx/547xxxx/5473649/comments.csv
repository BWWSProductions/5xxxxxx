,Devil_Spawn,2010-04-14T15:38Z,i hope it works on TTDS 
,Devil_Spawn,2010-04-14T15:42Z,what moves will pikachu learn eg volt takle
,Devil_Spawn,2010-04-14T19:12Z,how does it work
[V],poppedtart,2010-04-14T19:34Z,"its a sav game file.  you would put it on your ttds.  make a copy of your current save game file and then overlay it with this one.

You will need 2 DS to do the trades.  You would trade pokemon from this SAV to your SAV.

You can trade them to legit retail cart as well."
,Devil_Spawn,2010-04-15T21:46Z,how do you overlay
[V],poppedtart,2010-04-16T01:49Z,rename this save file to whatever your save file is named.  or rename your rom to whatever this save file is named so they both match.

,Devil_Spawn,2010-04-16T11:27Z,it does work thanks for all the ups
,jackdegroet,2010-04-22T09:29Z,"Yes it works just fine. Just rename the SAV file the same as the NDS file.
For example: 
Pokemon HG.nds
Pokemon HG.sav
That's it"
,vivien12,2010-05-16T18:06Z,Do I have to remove my old sav-file before I put this on on my card? And do you know if it works on Ds one supercard?
,Pr0nzlolololol,2010-05-21T01:54Z,"okay, so i have a nintendo ds rom for heartgold and my girlfriend has a legit copy of soulsilver. if i were to trade these pokemon from a sav file to her legit copy, are there any risks of her game messing up?

by the way, excellent download, thanks man"

,aditya1996,2011-08-25T17:04Z,"Steps to make it this awesome file to work on Desmume 0.9.7 :
1] Open a HG/SS rom. 
2] Go to 'File' and click on 'Import Backup Memory' and then select THIS {Pokemon HeartGold SoulSilver Full Starter Pokemon} file (this file name and the rom name should be same...like HG.nds and HG.sav.)
3] Then go to 'Emulation' and click 'Reset'.
4] Then let the rom load and click on Continue from main menu with the player name as Jason...
