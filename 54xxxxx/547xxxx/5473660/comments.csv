The files it deleted caused my system to BSOD on reboot.  nnJust to be sure I restored from an 6 month old backup, tried this program again and it did the same thing.nnThe only fix is to edit the registry and remove \""snapman\"" from \""UpperFilters\"".  I had to remove the hard drive and connect it to another system, run regedit and mount and edit the registry hive from the trashed OS.nnIf you have any Acronis software installed, you might want to avoid the portable version and just use the included installer and keygen."
