!!!WARNING!!! !!!WARNING!!! !!!WARNING!!!
Don't use this Portable version on a PC that has already ADDS installed, as to work it deletes some files that will force you to reinstall and recover original files. But why run the Portable version if you have installed it?

Acronis Disk Director Suite 10.0 is a comprehensive workstation partition and disk management suite that combines a number of previous Acronis products into one solution:

â€¢ Create individual partitions for your system and your data using Acronis Disk Director Suite.
â€¢ Image your system partition using Acronis True Image only before applying system changes, such as installing new software and the like.
â€¢ And make scheduled data backups from your data partition by selecting specific files you need to backup.
â€¢ Thus, using the combination of two great Acronis products you will always have an image of your system and backup of your data. This will greatly save you time and reduce your storage requirements.

Acronis Disk Director Suite 10.0 adds new key features making it easier than ever before to modify your partition structure and boot new operating systems.
â€¢ New! Split partitions â€” Split one partition into two and leave your data intact
â€¢ New! Merge partitions â€” Merge two partitions into one and leave your data untouched, even if file systems on the partitions are different
â€¢ New! Explore partitions â€” Windows-like explorer interface to view partition data before performing partitioning operations
â€¢ New! Boot from an additional hard disk drive â€” Select the hard disk drive you want to boot from
â€¢ New! Boot from CD/DVD â€” Insert a bootable CD/DVD and it will automatically be detected and displayed as a boot option by Acronis OS Selector
â€¢ New! Automatic operating system detection â€” Detect operating systems that became unbootable due to some accidental reasons with the Acronis OS Selector detection tool

The Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.


This has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.



SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal

http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
