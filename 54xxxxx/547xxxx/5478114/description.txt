About The Author:

Anna Maria Foscale began Annaveda as a blog for sharing vegetarian and vegan recipies where she could illustrate that healthful, dairy-free recipes could taste as delicious and even better than their less healthy counterparts. This culmination and desire to share these recipes with those who are body aware and have cholesterol or dairy issues led to the production of this DVD series. In addition to furthering her culinary studies, Anna Maria also holds healthy lifestyle workshops.
