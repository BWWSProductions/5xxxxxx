[V],twentyforty,2010-03-30T13:37Z,Look... last episode was 197MB. I wont do that. And - I get more suggestions to stay at 272p than move to 360p. I know that this doesn't bothers you - but I have you explained in greater details why I must stick to 272p and encode only shorter shows as 360p. The Pacific is only exception.

,hkoraddi,2010-03-30T13:46Z,thanks for sticking wit 272p size does matter man 
,stev666,2010-03-30T13:58Z,"@hkoraddi

I agree I'm happy with 272. The size does matter or we would all be dl 350mb versions."
,beckinsale_95,2010-03-30T14:07Z,Hi. Did you happen to do Alice 2009 mini series? I searched your ups but didn't find any. Searched tpb and found this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5201964/Alice.2009.Part1.HDTV.H264 and this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5205926/Alice.2009.Part2.HDTV.H264 These 2 are from anonymous but have the same info as yours. I have to make sure before I DL. Might be a fake.
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-30T14:28Z,"@Stev: Chuck would be upped after scheduled shows. Schedule is more like ""I'll do that no matter what"". Other shows can be upped if my situation allows.

@hkkorad: 272p is native H264 format. Other misuse the whole idea beyond x(h)264 and avc.
H264 was invented for saving the bandwidths, not to made spoiled brats go wild.

@back-in-sale: Nope, these are mine, and I have no idea why these went Anonymous. Maybe 'cause they are ""dead"". I would load them now and we can try to ""resurrect"" both. BTW, torrents have been upped December 9-10 2009. and my torrents live maybe month or so...
