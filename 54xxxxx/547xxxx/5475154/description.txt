SynaptiCAD Product Suite v14.19e | 124MB

SynaptiCAD was founded by electrical engineers to create design tools that helped engineers think critically about their designs. Being engineers themselves, they were frustrated by having to almost complete a design before being able to get simulation results. 

Our founders decided that there must be a better approach for interacting with design tools and from this simple idea they created SynaptiCAD, a company that creates "tools for the thinking mind". This idea permeates all of our tool interfaces. 

With SynaptiCAD's tools you are able to begin analyzing and simulating design ideas right away without having to complete an entire circuit model or schematic. Our tools automatically handle many of the minor details involved in the design effort, leaving you more time to focus on the bigger picture.

The SynaptiCAD Product Suite includes the following products: TestBencher Pro, VeriLogger Extreme, VeriLogger Pro, BugHunter Pro, DataSheet Pro, WaveFormer Pro, WaveFormer Lite, Timing Diagrammer Pro, GigaWave Viewer, Vhdl2Verilog, and Verilog2Vhdl.
