This is a collection of Mashup songs I've collected over time. They're some of my favorite, and I don't know where all of them came from.

Some were downloaded here, some over Limewire when I used to use it. Stuff like that.

Also, I grabbed them out of my itunes music folder, so most of them are separated into a bunch of folders. Sorry about that, but I wasn't willing to put the extra effort to organize them. Besides, if you use your music program (like Windows Media Player or iTunes) you can just add the main directory and everything else will fall into place.
