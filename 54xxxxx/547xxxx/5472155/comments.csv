,pheldd,2010-03-30T21:56Z,"Thank you Steve.

Does anybody know how many episodes there are in this season?  Web searches turn up a few different episode guides."
,yakkob,2010-05-27T08:55Z,Has Episode 15 ever been aired?
,pheldd,2010-06-01T08:21Z,"There have been two more episodes in season 13 (19 eps total) that are not on TPB, and now they have started airing season 14 too.  If anybody knows where we can find any of these missing ones please post here."
,stevenitro,2010-06-06T05:03Z,"Hey guys, sorry for the lack of Good Eats.  Some family issues had come up over the past few weeks and my DVD recorder failed.  However, I do have the episodes on my DVR and as soon as things get back to normal I'll have a bunch of Good Eats up.  :)"
