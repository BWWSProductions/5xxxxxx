    Simon Reeve continues his epic journey around the world    
    following the Tropic of Cancer, the northern border of    
    the tropics region.                                      
                                                              
    Simon rejoins the Tropic of Cancer in Egypt and follows    
    it through Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Oman. In Southern      
    Egypt, next to the ancient temple of Abu Simbal, Simon   
    meets Nubians struggling to maintain their culture        
    following the damming of the Nile and dives in the         
    pristine reefs of the Red Sea.                            
                                                             
    In Saudi Arabia, he goes racing with the Jeddah Boyz;     
    and in Dubai he meets construction workers suffering in    
    the economic downturn and he watches as rare baby green   
    giant turtles start their own epic journeys as they      
    head into the Arabian Sea from the beaches of Oman.
