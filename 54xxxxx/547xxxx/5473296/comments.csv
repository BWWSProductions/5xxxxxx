thx"

you can fly the canadian version used in the missions with the added radars etc in free flight as long as you have acceleration cus im sure it uses the f-18 in acceleration and just adds things to it."
,JasonVoorhees95,2010-04-01T10:49Z,thx!!!by the way any chance for the concorde x????
,chuckmamuck,2010-04-02T05:52Z,"im after Concorde X myself mate, im desperate for it so im hoping to have it very soon.
just seen it go for sale on ebay for ÂŁ49, you can buy it for ÂŁ56, it was being sold as a download from the producers site that the seller had dl'd then saved on a 1gb pendrive and thats how he was selling it.
i bet he dl'd it, installed it on his own system then sold it on ebay and got his money back. good idea. i bet its got some heavy security on it tho like 1 registration only works with 1 install or something. i wish i possessed the skills and knowledge to be able to crack software. we need a resident cracker who can crack these items."
,kingwael,2011-02-16T05:20Z,"can you please upload the original fa18 file from accelaration because i dont have accelaration and most of the aircrafts like the t45c they use its mfds and hud so can you please do that.
thanks in advance"

Anyone working on uploading DRJ Simulation's F-18 Mission pack?  It sounds very good and has great reviews.  "
