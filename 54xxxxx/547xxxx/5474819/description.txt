Snatch. is a 2000 crime film by British writer-director Guy Ritchie, and featuring an ensemble cast. Set in the London criminal underworld, the film contains two intertwined plots â€” one dealing with the search for a stolen diamond, the other with a small-time boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham) who finds himself under the thumb of a sadistic gangster known as Brick Top (Alan Ford).
Snatch. is characterized by an assortment of colourful characters, including the "pikey" Irish Traveller Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), Russian-Uzbek ex-KGB agent and arms-dealer Boris "the Blade" Yurinov (Rade Sherbedgia), professional thief and gambling addict Frankie "Four-Fingers" (Benicio del Toro) and bounty hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones). It is also distinguished by a kinetic direction and editing style, a circular plot featuring numerous ironic twists of chance and causality, and a fast pace.
The film shares similar themes, ideas and motifs as Ritchie's first film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It is also filmed in the same visual style and features many of the same actors, including Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham and Jason Flemyng.
