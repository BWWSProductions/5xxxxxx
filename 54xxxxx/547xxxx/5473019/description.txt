30 Seconds to Mars - BBC Live Lounge 2010 (2 songs)


30 Seconds To Mars were in the Live Lounge and performed their single This is War and covered Bad Romance by Lady Gaga. Fearne also presented Jared with his 'trophy' for the Ultimate Live Lounge Cover. Nice.

Jared told Fearne the band are thinking about moving to the UK. They love hanging out in Covent Garden when in London and would love to live here all the time. 30STM have recently finished a huge UK tour where Jared ran into the crowds and took requests on his guitar while sitting up in the balcony. They're now heading off to the US for some more gigs before coming back here for the summer festivals.
