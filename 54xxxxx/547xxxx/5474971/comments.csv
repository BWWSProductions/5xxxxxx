[T],renman,2010-04-02T17:34Z,People you're NOT seeding! I can't and wont do this by myself. This is called FILE SHARING  be fair and help to seed this or I wont up the other 4 Alastair Sim movies I have period.
[T],renman,2010-04-03T15:52Z,4.793 ratio and no-one is seeding except me WTF. Ending this up shortly unless people help to seed. Be fair and Share!!!
[T],renman,2010-04-07T22:10Z,I realise a lot of you are getting stuck at 99.8% the reason for this is I'm not seeding this all of the time as I have other items to seed. No-one has bothered to seed this except me which isn't very helpful. SO please in the spirit of file sharing help me to seed this thank you
,dutara,2010-04-09T19:33Z,"Yep, 99.8%, 1 Mb from completion.  Been there a few days now.  Oh well, that's about 10 seconds of movie time."
[T],renman,2010-04-09T20:24Z,I am seeding this every day but you'll just have to take pot luck when I am. Others should help me to seed as I've been stating all along and I'm more than a little disappointed that no-one else is
,morphirr,2010-10-10T12:09Z,"Thanks for these Alastair Sim movies, great actor, please seed "
,dennives,2011-08-14T09:05Z,"Please seed!
It's necessary to download only a few percent!!! "
,kodabar,2011-09-11T19:37Z,There are 16 of us stuck at 99.8%. Any chance of a re-seed? Surely some of us would keep seeding after that...
