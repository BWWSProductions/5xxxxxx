LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE
More fruits from the Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat production line, Left, Right and Centre is a lively romantic comedy about two opposing candidates in a Parliamentary by-election.
Bob Wilcot (Ion Carmichael) is a suave television personality standing as prospective Conservative MP at the Earndale by-election, not out of an ethical imperative but because his uncle, Lord Wilcot (Sim), needs the publicity for the commercialisation of the ancestral home. But the young Tory becomes smitten by his attractive opponent, Labour candidate
Stella Stoker (Patricia Bredin). As the election looms, the candidate's respective agents join forces to become obstacles on the pair's path to true love. Brilliantly performed, not least by Sim as the avaricious uncle, and blessed with an abundance of supporting character comedians, the film also succeeds as a deft political satire.
