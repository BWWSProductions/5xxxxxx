CRIZNITTLE IS BACK. Search around. There IS an April, 2010, Criznittle Indie Rock Playlist torrent out there. And it's great to see him back, finally.

And then there's my little playlist. Enjoy! 

See you in May in spite of my horrible little April Fools joke on the blog on the first.

See NFO file for more info and for a list of files, click the number next to "files" above.

It's another great month of new music. And now we have Crizz back, too. It's a good month. Matter of fact, don't even bother with mine right now and go grab his!!!
