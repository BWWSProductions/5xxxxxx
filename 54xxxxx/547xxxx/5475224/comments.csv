,rollie1967,2010-04-29T02:30Z,anyone know where to find criznittles lists? had most of his 08 lists- but HD failure has left them in doubt. havent seen anything from him in ages.

(it's a BT search engine) As far as the old torrents go, I'm not sure they are around. I bet some are on BT and maybe even some of the older file sharing networks. They USED to all still be on Mininova. :(  But not anymore. You might try Demonoid."
