The project began when Lama Denys Teundroup, the spiritual director of Karma Ling and Honorary President of the European Buddhist Union was traveling in Ecuador to give some Buddhist teachings. It was there that the author and poet Alexis Naranjo invited him to join him on a trip into the jungle to visit the Shuar. Along with their kinsfolk, the Ashuar (collectively known to outsiders as "Jivaros" ) they inhabit the sacred waterfalls where the Andes plunge thousands of feet into the green depths of the Amazon rainforest. The Shuar are famous as the proud tribal people who, when gold-greedy Conquistadors built a town there in the sixteenth century, killed every last Spaniard in combat, except the Governor who expired after having been made to gulp a drink which they prepared especially for him: a goblet of the precious metal he craved so much, in liquid form! The Shuar have enjoyed the traditional lifestyle since then, until Big Oil recently began prospecting in their jungle sanctuary.

It was in the rainforest that Lama Denys met Don Hilario Chiriap, a Shuar shaman and a spokesperson of his people. The two men soon became fast friends. While comparing their spiritual beliefs, Lama Denys was impressed by the profound reverence for nature - implicit in the Shuar cosmology - and its similarity to the Buddhist regard for the welfare of all sentient beings. Like most Indigenous Peoples, the Shuar worldview does not feature a split between the creator and the creation, spirit and matter, or mind and nature. Because the whole of nature is sacred in their way of seeing, their position on the front lines of tropical deforestation is also a spiritual stance. Don Hilario voiced his concern about the impact of deforestation and oil and mineral exploration on the rainforest, and expressed his wish for an international gathering where Indigenous shamans, traditional wisdom-keepers and medicine men and women from around the world could meet each other, and then present their united message to high level representatives of the world's organized religions, so as to challenge the latter to take up the environmental cause on spiritual grounds. Don Hilario's hope is to enroll the South American Christian Churches on the side of Indigenous People and the rainforest.

Lama Denys agreed, quickly realizing that because the spiritual traditions of Indigenous Peoples are so intimately related to the places where they live, their holistic and ecological vision of the universe - transmitted down through the generations from very ancient times - has tremendous inspirational value for the development of the new way of thinking which is so urgently needed to correct the social and environmental imbalance which now threaten our planet. He sent out the first invitations six months later for an Interfaith Gathering "to explore the common themes of peace, compassion, and solidarity which underlie the world's faiths, and to draw attention to the endangered spiritual traditions of Indigenous Peoples, whose holistic ecological wisdom and social insights have so much to offer the modern world."

One of the first to accept the invitation was H.H. the Dalai Lama, who is very keen to promote interfaith dialogue. He expressed this at Assisi in 1986, in the Dordogne in 1991, and at Lourdes in 1993:

"From my personal experience, I believe such a gathering should have two major objectives. The first is that the world's principal traditions consider how to participate in the improvement of the world and of Humankind as a whole, by promoting fundamental human values such as compassion and ethics. The second objective is that each of these major traditions consider how to contribute to the preservation of different ancient traditions which are working for the well-being and survival of their own communities."

Karma Ling itself also has a long tradition of interfaith dialogue, going back to its roots in Tibet in the 19th century. The brochure for the Gathering stated the following:

"The 21 st century will be one of dialogue. The monotheistic religions descended from Abraham, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, together with Hinduism and Buddhism, now communicate with each other through a deepening interfaith dialogue that is actively engaged in the development of peace and the promotion of universal values. If these religious traditions, through some of their representatives - in their differences, oppositions, or rivalries - become factors of war, then their dialogue in respect of the difference of each one, is on the contrary the true source of a profound peace."

The gathering - officially held as part of the United Nations Decade of Indigenous Peoples (1995 - 2004) - was scheduled for April 26th to May 2, 1997. With only three weeks to go, Lama Denys asked Global Vision if we would like to produce a documentary about the event. This was extremely short notice, but because of the historic nature of the project and of the Dalai Lama's personal involvement, we were able to secure a distribution deal with Mystic Fire Video, and raise the funds for David Cherniack - one of the world's leading documentary filmmakers, to fly to Karma Ling along with a three-camera crew from Canada and New York, in time for the gathering. We shot 60 hours of footage at Karma Ling, and more footage on location afterwards with the Mohawks in Canada.

There were 40 representatives of various faiths and traditions, approximately half of whom were from Indigenous cultures. The latter were accompanied by intepreters and anthropologists to help translate and explain their traditions and rituals.
