In 1990 TEA began their comet like rise with Birth ... a place somewhere else and Sexual Decay. After the first studio takes in the legendary SSE Studios in 1991 with Winus Rilinger they produced their follow ups Visions, Door to my Pain, Daughters of Guyon and finally the first version of San Diego for their debut album Atroci(-me)ty. Ever since TEA were a fundamental part of the German alternative clubscene.
They went on their first headliner tour in 1992 with the EP Luminographic Agony and the hit songs Agony ... I like and Paint it Black.

Overwhelmed by their enormous success they recorded their next album Trauma Rouge in 1993 and performed the probably most legendary electro tour of the early 90's. The Trauma over Europe - Tour broke all sales records for alternative bands as yet and rocketed them to the top of the European electro scene.

In 1994 their success was even topped with their follow up album War. Including songs like Childhood and the ballad Jonathan they conquered the alternative charts worldwide.

Reaching the climax of their carreer the members of TEA decided to dedicate themselves to solo-projects â€“ bands like INSIDE, CYAN KILLS E. COLI and CYAN evolved, mingeling between accustomed and new electronic styles.

After a four year break TEA published their Best Of Album Nothing meant Forever in 1998. But it took another five years until they finally got back together and produced a new long player. Katharsis was published in 2003 and after a long time as Live ' Teetotallers TEA came back to electrify their audience with songs like Godless or Babylon at various festivals.

In 2004 the publication of the EP Black Heritage followed, which included not only cover versions of some of their favourite songs but also a new title in their mother language called Schwarz.

Even up to date the band has it's critics - but TEA was, and will probably remain to be the most discussed about electro band of all time. They will always go their own special way without adapting to conventional methods or oppinions.

One year later TEA released their most discussed about CD in their carreer. EUPHORIC & DEMONIC (2005) split the fanbase as well as the press community in 2 opposing lobbies. 
The ones loving the very raw and direct sound on the album, and those who critize the missing of the wellknown groove and directly into the ear sound of TEA. The following European Tour was a great success nevertheless. At the end of 2006 it was time for a new "Best Of" - update called "Realict or Requiem". 
After this outtake the TEA members again chose to spend their time with their own or new projects, taking their usual 2 year break from each other without working on new TEA songs.

Parallel to the distribution and release of SAN DIEGO 2K9 on the bandâ€™s own label AFFLICT:ME Records, TEA already worked highly concentrated on the songwriting and the production of their next CD. After a fabulous appearance at the WGT, the long awaited new album â€“ION will be released which has already been praised in various fanzines as the best output after TRAUMA ROUGE. Stay Tuned!!

Conform or be cast out is not their way of making music...
