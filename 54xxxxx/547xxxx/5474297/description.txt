Description:

ByMeR-CS 1.6 Next Generation!

Next Generation version looks more than a modern and not cause disturbances even in the most demanding one player, while the majority are guaranteed to be ecstatic. Models weapons look very realistic if you compare to the standard CS1.6. The same applies to the player models. The game fully supports the Online mode and compatibility with ZBOT. And the result of closed beta testing has allowed long before the official release to identify and fix bugs present in earlier versions.
