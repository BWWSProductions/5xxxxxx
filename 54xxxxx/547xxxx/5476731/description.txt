           Where does this play?
           
            -> BD5 is meant for playback on pc/popcorn/htpc/ps3/bluray-player
            
           How does it work?
           
            ->  For playback on pc simply extract and play the mkv in your favorite player.
                another option is to create the bluray/image for playback with powerdvd.
            ->  For playback on ps3/bluray-player run mkv2bluray.bat and chose "B".
                This will convert the mkv to bluray and create an image that will play
                in the PS3 or a Bluray Player.
           
           How's the quality?
           
            -> Qualiy is to be considered the same as BluRay releases.
             
           Why is BD5 "undersized"?
           
            -> The conversion to bluray takes up some 200-300MB space which is the bluray
                overhead. Because of this the mkv is sligthly "undersized".
                
           Why doesn't everything get released as BD5?
           
            -> We don't know and there is no logical reason. However, as time goes on other
                groups cannot continue to ignore the bluray community by stubbornly releasing
                incompatible BluRay releases. It's like releasing DVDR's that don't run in
                DVD Players.
                
           
           These types of releases are also meant to replace BluRay releases in archives.
