The second part is a godawful lecture from some bible puching freak droning on in his south African accent about the second coming, analyzing the bible as though it were a factual textbook written by God. Unless you are some religious loony like him this is a sure cure for insomnia. I found it a waste of time so I deleted it before I went to sleep."

By the way, do you hold this contempt of yours toward everyone who doesn't agree with you or just Christians? and what would you even know about the Bible? In my experience, it's about impossible to learn anything about a matter if you start off by assuming it's nonsense. Just like with the pyramids, many people assume that the ancients were ignorant. Then look at the pyramids: there are enough of those huge granite blocks to form a perimeter around France. We have no clue how we would pull off such a feat, let alone how a ""primitive"" people 
would pull it off. I don't know. Maybe you're just really intellectually arrogant, or then again maybe you just hate anything that has to do with God."
