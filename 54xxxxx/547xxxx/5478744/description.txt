Army@Love is an American comic book series from DC Comics' Vertigo imprint drawn and scripted by Rick Veitch (Swamp Thing, Maximortal), with Gary Erskine (The Filth, Dan Dare) on inking duties.

The story follows the adventures of a unit of New Jersey National Guard in "Afbaghistan", a fictional Middle Eastern country based on Afghanistan.  The unit includes both men and women, a great deal of the action following the amorous adventures of various members.  The contrast between the surreal combat in Afbaghistan and the comfortable lives of the rear echelon and the people the Guardsmen and - women have left behind is also a recurring theme.
