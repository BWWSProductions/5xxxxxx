This is Halo 1 in literal terms, it is the portable version and plays perfectly online, i havent had any problems with it, windows firewall will pop up asking if you want to allow it, give it access to the internet or you cant play online and it wont let you connect to any servers!

please seed

I have packaged this in a win-rar standalone sfx archive, just unrar and play it! Simple!

Happy Gaming
