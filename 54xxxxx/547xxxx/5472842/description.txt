Here's another FANTASTIC documentary from the crew over at ESPN. I have a personal friend who worked on this project, and the movies are hard to find on the internet and rarely get rerun, so I want to make sure people can see these engaging documentaries.



From ESPN's 30 for 30 official site for The Legend of Jimmy The Greek:

â€œThe NFL Todayâ€ on CBS was one of the preeminent sports programs on television in the early 1980s. It was a perfect combination of reporting, analysis, predictions, humor and talent. But there was no personality on the show more popular than Jimmy â€œThe Greekâ€ Snyder. Born in Steubenville, Ohio, to Greek immigrants, Jimmy overcame childhood tragedy, moved to Las Vegas, and eventually became the biggest name in the world of sports handicapping. When CBS added him as an â€œanalystâ€ on â€œThe NFL Today,â€ â€œThe Greekâ€ not only further increased his stature as a sort of national folk hero, but he also gained an air of respectability never before associated with gamblers. Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Fritz Mitchell, who broke in as an intern on â€œThe NFL Today,â€ will examine Snyderâ€™s impact on the growth of sports gambling, while also taking a fresh look at The Greekâ€™s tragic downfall.
