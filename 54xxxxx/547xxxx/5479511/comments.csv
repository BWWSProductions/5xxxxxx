I hope your ham is cooked to perfection
and that you were able to find some hidden
eggs.A little wine would probably be in order
as well.May the comment section be kind 
to you at least for a day."

,hkoraddi,2010-04-04T07:51Z,"happy Easter to all ppl n 2040...

and one thing to ask are you going with clone wars or not.."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-04T08:40Z,"Happy Easter. Thank you guys.

@hkoraddi: Yes, but late afternoon CET. I am still ""trembling"" because of the warning of some SWCW fan that my encodes are piece of shit, too small and belongs in Handheld section.
--------------------------------------------------------
Regarding such things READ (it goes for all of you) following:

- I wont up the shows where are no Thanks AT ALL (happened with Star Wars MORE than half dozen times - search my torrents if you like). I feel endlessly stupid if my uploads of CWSW are downloaded by 700 people per episode - but NOBODY bothered to say plain and short Thanks. I am obligated to do a shit, everything I do is for the people who turns to be selfish and/or unthankful bastards thinking ""he MUST do that"". Nope. And I wont.

- 2nd, even more important: I am last couple of years surprised how I must deal alone with lunatics every now and then. Very rare I feel ""protected"" by fans, or regulars or whoever from maniacal claims and intrusions.
Contrary to that I can read hundredths of requests ""do that, 'cause..."" and still puzzles me ""Where in hell have been all these people a day ago"".
What is even sillier, every week I can read a request RIGHT BELOW some crap, as nothing happened and nothing matters...
In short, if I felt ""overwhelmed"" by attacks AND by not getting protection or counter-arguments/response to such vicious comments (lukewarm response included). Only Jon and few times lilars, Stev or grayscales have been exception to that.

I will, I promise, stop doing such shows. It happened with Leverage, Big Love and Damages - and Spartacus and Southland are next to go - but ""saved"" by the shaky balance between the shit and the thanks.

You know what I'm sayin'?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-04T09:00Z,"@hkoraddi: I just found out that today's 

Star Wars The Clone Wars S02E17 READNFO 720p HDTV x264-2HD 

is a DUPE (duplicate) of European 720p I have encoded last week

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5470218/Star.Wars.The.Clone.Wars.S02E17.272p.HDTV.H264

So - I wont do Star Wars CW today."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-04T16:51Z,"@myself: Never say never. Star Wars Clone Wars S02E18 (European, week ahead US) is up."
,lilars26,2010-04-04T16:56Z,"@20-40
LOL"
,lilars26,2010-04-04T21:47Z,"Thank you.
I just finished watching this and found it quite interesting.It's basically about the historical
significance of the bible.I don't think it is trying to change anyone's view,just trying to give you the facts as uncovered through archeological digs.Interesting and informative."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-04T23:05Z,"@lilars:  Yes, facts which basically proves that all was fiction. As you said few days ago: ""Blame the devil"". He surely has gone into past (he doesn't need time-machine for that)  and mixed, planted and covered the true evidence (as we have seen what has devil done with fossils 'cause dinosaurs have lived 6000 years ago, in harmony with early humans). But, we know how to recognize footsteps and the work of devil. Big wise books have taught us how and what for, right?"
,lilars26,2010-04-05T02:26Z,"Big,wise books have perpetrated the biggest con in the history of mankind but as long as your not hurting anyone else I agree with John Lenon's ""Whatever gets you through the night."""
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-05T08:43Z,"@lilars: Yeah, uthopia... People would use any excuse to cut each-other throats - ""as your not hurting anyone"" NEVER EXISTED. It's merely a cushion, when WE need to justify still going religious war (without ""s"") everywhere. What we have is killing in the name of the same con - it happens that THE BASE both Christianity and Islam is ABSOLUTELY THE SAME."
,lilars26,2010-04-05T14:52Z,"I never knew about the connection between the 
Muslim and Christian faiths.That is one of the things I found so fascinating in this documentary."
,DeltaPan,2010-04-07T15:04Z,"I download and watch this type of material out of interest because i am a pagan and have very different viewpoints to those faithful to the Egypto - Roman control mechanism that is the form of Christianity being believed today and for the past several centuries and created 2 millennia ago give and take 5-700 years either side as it formed, not the spiritual and Gnostic forms of what it was millennia ago but the control mechanism it became, used by savage ruling elites to slaughter pagans who wouldn't/didn't convert to a slave theocracy and forcing the rest at sword point to go against nature and worship man instead, so on so forth, etc.
I've only watched the first two thus far and all i see is a manipulation.
Theologians and theocratic hierarchies of the monotheist sects realise that societies of nations are waking up to the huge inaccuracies and disparities in the so called book of god, created by man and once believed to be absolutely perfect and truthful, is now realised as nothing but a story taken from pagans and Gnostic's and mashed together to be used as propaganda and get everybody following the Roman empire, instead of actually wiping everybody out, they realised they needed a remnant of the pagan peoples to do the work and create wealth for them, so they slaughtered the druidic arya's leaders in spiritual and warrior castes and gave the survivors this bible of nonsense to believe in, or else.
All these documentaries and others like them are doing, is trying to say this that and the other are obviously not true and these are the facts of archaeology so this is what really occurred, but is actually looking at what many non christian intellectuals have realised are key points of the lies and obfuscations and are simply putting the lie straight in an attempt to explain all the utter detritus the books themselves prove themselves to be, putting timelines right so it again appears to be the truth of the period, like, oh it's all true guys just things were a little out of whack we've sorted that out so now you can believe it all with confidence.
It is a manipulation by people seeming to trash elements but are in fact reinforcing it by adjusting the indicators which prove it is a Roman tool to gain servility of pagan peoples of the lands invaded and they subjugated.
When you see these documentaries from a pagan perspective, not atheist or as follower of any Christian sect, you see what they are in the plane of reality.
They are apologist to the inaccuracies and just fine tuning the lies and obfuscations.
I know many will not understand nor want to believe what i'm saying, but i gotta say it, this stuff is so obvious it's unreal, do you realise how archaeology has been controlled and how everything which doesn't reinforce Egypto-Roman JudaoChristianity is hidden, the record has been kept so what they find which explains what has actually occurred by those creating monotheist religions, people who attempt to prove what actually happened in history which contradicts the lies are destroyed academically and even murdered because they know it will turn people against the churches when the proof becomes known and facts are realised against the lies, so many people will lose credibility who have power and influence, they destroy people in various ways to maintain the status quo.

look at how devoted to maintaining the religious integrity these archaeologists are in these programmes, no actual objectivity at all, it's all subjective to the monotheist doctrine and protecting the integrity of the bible, were they to include everything in the Apocrypha and excluded books which are in the hundreds not just 14 and lesser known scriptures as much as those kept from the many, ones they don't shout about, the whole thing would be so completely different and tear the bible as canonised by the Romans and vassal states of the empire as aligning with the Romans to try and avoid constant attacks when the lie was finally put together in the first official bibles, later fine tuned by King James and an even greater manipu"
