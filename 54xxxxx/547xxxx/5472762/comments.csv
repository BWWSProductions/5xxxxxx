[V],twentyforty,2010-03-30T19:53Z,"Somebody was very, very ... what? jealous or simply crazy?

Giving -1 on Quality BEFORE anyone has  downloaded a movie?

One shit per day - do not be so modest... How about -100 and few curses for dessert? "
,sasash,2010-03-30T20:32Z,hey what about family guy latest>>>>?????
,Pothead808,2010-03-30T20:35Z,"hey 20, thanks for this, saw it came out recently and was going to download a larger filesize, but always choose your rips over others lol, and chance of a rip of the new movie Icarus?"
,lilars26,2010-03-30T21:11Z,"I was just going to ask how 2 people have judged this when I am still waiting for initial seeding to finish but 20-40 beat me to it.Some mean spirited people here.
Show you care and turn up your upload speeds.
Peace,out."
[V],pluto999,2010-03-30T21:18Z,Fuck the fucker who gave -1.. Go to hell man.. No need to download anything & no need to question about the source also..If you want it just grab it & say thanks twentyforty & fucking seed ...else.. go to hell
[V],pluto999,2010-03-30T21:19Z,Just one question which subtitle should be appropriate?
[V],pluto999,2010-03-30T21:20Z,+1 mate
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-30T21:48Z,"@pluto999: At least some reaction, and I hope that ""fucking seed ...else.. go to hell"" wasn't for me. That madness should be stopped and I usually delete the torrent, no matter what.
Regarding subs - in next few days, not sooner, search on subtitle sites. Better subtitles usually appear after week or two, but first ones get more downloads. Google and decide."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-30T22:02Z,"@gangmie: I have no clue. Greatest minds try to figure out the same: ""What was before?"" ""What was the source, in the beginning?""

I am afraid that we never could have one definitive answer.

Capisce?"
,hunt_0710,2010-03-30T22:05Z,"Well, I dont know what others r saying...... but if it is 2040..... +1 from my side...."
,stev666,2010-03-30T22:57Z,"Everything 20-40 has uploaded has been worth the download, if you don't want it don't don't download it go somewhere els the internet is a big place there are lots of other places your idiotic comments might be welcome this isn't one of them."
,lilars26,2010-03-30T23:00Z,"What was before?Only one answer.

I dunno."

Signalboy, I have no clue why that happens. You do have 5.5 up?, maybe you need to flash with newest firmware or use newest iTunes?

It's 360p and it wont work on older models of Ees. Sorry."
