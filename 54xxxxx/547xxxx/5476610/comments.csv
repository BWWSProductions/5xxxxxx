Thanks!"
,halomoe,2010-04-18T07:11Z,"Ok, well what you would be doing at the moment is downloading the song right? What your actually doing is 'using someone elses upload up'. As in, someone else around the world who already has the mp3 file is uploading the file to you and thats why you're downloading it. However, this is leeching. To seed, you yourself must upload the torrent to someone else so you can keep it alive and so the next person can download the file aswell. Therefore, just keep the torrent on after you have finished downloading it. A recommended program is uTorrrent. Very user freindly!
