,footyshorts,2010-04-18T02:22Z,"Odins_Blade, your memory is flawed, if you have even seen this show before.  This is a puppet show, not anime.  In the US it aired as Planet Patrol."
,implaca1,2010-04-18T06:42Z,Many thanks g8aso - I've been looking for this on DVD for ages but it seems to have gone out of print - at least in my part of the world - so the upload is very much appreciated.

,scottsasse,2011-02-02T18:58Z,"I would rather watch Benny Hill re-runs than British sci-fi from the early 60's!!!! ""I got me finger stuck in me bum, could you help me get it out??"" I'm NOT dissing the Brit's at all (I love them). I live in America and it's a SHIT-HOLE now (mostly due to our government, president police, health care and laws) but we DO still have AWESOME TV, movies, music, etc...... that the rest of the world LOVES!!! And WHAT was your point in commenting simply ""1987"" on my Fat Boys torrent yesterday?????????????? It WAS from 1987!!! If you can PROVE me and Polygram Records wrong then please accept my apology in advance!! Otherwise FUCK OFF and STOP using TPB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love, DrScott"
