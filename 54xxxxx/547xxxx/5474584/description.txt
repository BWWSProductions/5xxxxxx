The WindowsÂ® Automated Installation Kit (Windows AIK) is a set of tools and documentation that support the configuration and deployment of WindowsÂ® operating systems. By using Windows AIK, you can automate Windows installations, capture Windows images with ImageX, configure and modify images using Deployment Imaging Servicing and Management (DISM), create Windows PE images, and migrate user profiles and data with the User State Migration Tool (USMT). Windows AIK also includes the Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT), which enables IT professionals to automate and centrally manage the volume activation process using a Multiple Activation Key (MAK). 

To install the Windows AIK, you must first download the ISO, Write the ISO file to a DVD using a third party tool, and then install the Windows AIK from the DVD.

If I am o=not mistaken, this software can be used to create a custom Windows 7 OR Windows Server 2008 DVD disc.

Enjoy.
