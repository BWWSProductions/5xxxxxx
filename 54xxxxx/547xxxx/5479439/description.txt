IMAGiNE NOTES
This time we've used the german internal by CiNEJUNKiEZ (thanks) and muxed our
own line audio to it.
Video was really nice ,but we've opted to tweak it still as it was too dark and also changed the rgb colours slightly aswell as a few other things.
Audio was a pain to sync but got there in the end.
