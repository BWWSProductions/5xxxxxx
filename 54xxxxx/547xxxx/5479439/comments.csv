[T],bulletzz74,2010-04-08T01:33Z,Demonoid is open
,eightballr,2010-04-10T15:46Z,ty kids love it. very good quality for a cam 
,kotique,2010-04-11T22:07Z,"video quality is good for a TS, but wtf is with audio? It sounds like it has been processed through old analog gain amplifier and a lot of clipping occurred. "
,BinkyDeath,2010-05-04T21:46Z,"Wow the quality is surprisingly great for the size and the fact it's a telesinc from a camcorder in a cinema.  Whoever tweaked the colouring and audio and sharpened it up did a great job. 
Whoever animated that dragon must have had a dog very similar to mine too - made me laugh. ^_^

@kotique - I didn't have any of the audio problems you mentioned. 

@metalracket - I seriously doubt you'll get a 3D copy until this is released on DVD.  The security is MUCH tighter in 3D cinemas."

,dsabljak,2010-05-25T12:11Z,nice filme
,mrdirectorman,2010-06-07T07:49Z,"Alright folks I'm bringing something totally new to the TS table and I know this is the forum to ask for it. Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!
By the way, THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS AN UPLOAD RATIO!"
