Mr. Iverson Minter, better known around the world as Louisiana Red, is an expatriate American bluesman living in Germany who has brought his incendiary guitar and raw, soulful vocals to appreciate blues fans in both the U.S. and Europe since the early-1950s. Although his unique style of gritty Delta-influenced juke-joint blues are often overlooked by stateside audiences, Red has released better than two-dozen albums throughout his lengthy career, and performed alongside legends like John Lee Hooker and Lightnin' Hopkins.
Jumping at the chance to work with his musical idol in the studio, album producer and guitarist Little Victor picked out a flat dozen of his favorite Louisiana Red tunes and enlisted guests like harpists Bob Corritore and Kim Wilson of the Fabulous Thunderbirds, as well as pianist Dave Maxwell, to record Back to the Black Bayou at the Juke Joint Studios in Notodden, Norway. Working with a core band of Norwegian blues musicians in an old-school, 24-track analog studio with real 2" tape, RCA ribbon microphones, and a vintage 1960s mixing console once owned by Stax Records, Little Victor and crew captured the brilliant energy and passion of each one of Louisiana Red's performances
