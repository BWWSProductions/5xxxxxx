When I was new to torrenting, I ripped my albums to mp3 at somewhere between 64-128 kbps to save space. Since then, I have had many requests for certain albums at a higher bit rate. This is one of those albums. Many of these are already available at lower bit rates as part of certain compilations Iâ€™ve put out, but the requests for higher quality have mounted, so here ya go. All albums are ripped to 320 kbps mp3, and are properly tagged and labeled.

The Clancy Brothers were an influential Irish folk music singing group, most popular in the 1960s, who are often credited with popularizing Irish traditional music in the United States. The brothers were Patrick "Paddy" Clancy, Tom Clancy, Bobby Clancy and Liam Clancy. They are best known for their work with Tommy Makem, recording dozens of albums together as The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. They were a primary influence on a young Bob Dylan and on the reemergence of folk music in the U.S.
