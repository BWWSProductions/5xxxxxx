MAX HARDCORE CHERRY POPPERS VOL 1, VHS RIP FROM A 15 YEAR OLD TAPE,  VERY HARD TO 

FIND THESE DAYS SINCE THEY MADE THEM ILLEGAL IN THE 90'S THEN THE SUPREME COURT OVER 

TURNED THE LAW.  80 TO 90 PERCENT OF THE TAPE IS GOOD BUT YOU GET THE TRACKING 

EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.  JUST LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.  ENJOY.
