Description...................: Just 15 miles south of Cleveland,  Ohio, in the town of Peninsula
				lies the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad.  Nestled along the banks
				of the Cuyahoga  River in the beautiful  Cuyahoga  Valley National
				Park, the railroad offers  passengers 26 miles  of rivers, forests
				and wildlife.  For thousands  of years Indians  used  the Cuyahoga
				River and Valley as a  north-south transportation  corridor. Later
				the Ohio & Erie Canal provided the early settlers a slow, but easy
				way to move bulk goods and people.  This railroad offers a one-way
				ticket for those riders who choose to bike back along the original
				towpath. The grandeur  and elegance of dining  on the rails can be
				experienced  on the Grand  Traverse  train in  northwestern  Lower
				Michigan. The train features  a five-course  gourmet meal prepared
				and cooked entirely  on the train.  Passengers are  transported on
				restored Pullman articulated dining cars that were built in 1940.
