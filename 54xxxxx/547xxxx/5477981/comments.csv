,andrewrox424,2010-04-10T09:05Z,Don't download. It's ripped straight out of the movie. With background noise and everything.
[T],artpepper,2010-04-10T11:41Z,"What part of the English phrase 'Original Soundtrack' didn't you understand? Dialogue from the film is interspersed between tracks to give them context. The 216 kbps bit rate is good enough. Background noise? Jesus Christ, one has to put up with some prize morons on TPB..."
,atomo360,2010-04-16T02:22Z,"True, that is how an OST really is...with some phrases of the movie :)"
,maxpower69,2010-05-01T00:42Z,"I'm not a big fan of vbr mp3's.
A constant 192kbps is better than a 216 vbr.
IMO."
,PeaTearGryphon,2010-05-06T08:32Z,"Right good stuff you've got here, artpepper. Ignore andrewrox; the rest of us are."
,rangers1983,2010-05-07T20:57Z,@andrewrox your an idiot! The soundtrack is great quality. And for the record a soundtrack is supposed to have clips from the film in it!! 
,twilightred360,2010-05-10T16:57Z,"its not backround noise...just a few sound clips from the movie, which is normal for an ost"

I don't know if it's the same song that plays while Big Daddy is killing the mob guys in the warehouse but at least you can find that one on either the 28 days later soundtrack or the 28 weeks later soundtrack take your pick...

,Psykopat71,2010-05-14T04:50Z,"It's the first track on the 28 weeks later soundtrack and the 18th track on the 28 days later soundtrack. I don't know why they didn't include this song on Kick-Ass soundtrack, it's a really great and emotionally powerful song."
,tardis4444,2010-05-23T23:27Z,"@Lideln
Pretty sure it's also from the film Sunshine. That's one of the reasons I love that film so much. If I recall correctly it's played several times."
,espisito,2010-05-26T03:10Z,"thanks a lot! good up.
Have a question for any smart people out there. The two extra songs listed above by John Murphey I know, but there are two additional songs that are great.

First is when he is about to jump off the roof when he's ""training""
Second is the ending when they are flying the jetpack through the town.

Any ideas?"
,praveenbh,2010-06-25T23:40Z,Good one mate :)
,praveenbh,2010-06-29T16:31Z,thanks mate +1
,xsoccer92x,2010-07-06T08:43Z,@espisito you can google kickass - the score and in the first torrent the song is called roof jump
,jojojooo67,2012-01-22T00:06Z,"""The 216 kbps bit rate is good enough"" Bullshit - That's like saying a small cock is good enough. Listening to an mp3 is like settling for the skank at a party...and you wouldn't do that would you?

Lossless formats are the only way to go. "
