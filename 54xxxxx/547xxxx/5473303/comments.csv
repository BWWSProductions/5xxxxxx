I like Usher's new CD, Hey Daddy and There Goes My Baby -- plus Drake's new single Shut it Down with the Dream is sick... but that's all R & B. As far as hip-hop, not sure... I was catching up with a lot of the 2009 stuff at the beginning of the year so far

I would LOVE to check out your list if you make one. Always lookin for new music. And since you dig this list, our taste must be kind of similar : ) Thanks and let me know if you make that torrent so I can comment and download"
