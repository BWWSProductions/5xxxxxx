There is nothing wrong with this one save that there are no subtitles just for the Navi dialogue; you turn on subtitles and it's for the whole movie.

In any case, thanks AITB for sharing this."

This is the nuke message for the Avatar.2009.PAL.MULTI.DVDR-TED scene copy of that DVDR

bad.nfo
reencoded.dvd9.to.dvd5
not.untouched.video
undersized
modified.volume.label
low.bitrate
repacked.from.web

So basically the problem would be that the DVD source is reencoded"
