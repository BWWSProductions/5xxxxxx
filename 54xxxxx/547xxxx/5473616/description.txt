          Episode: Mystery Of The Nile

          Join a team of explorers on the expedition of a lifetime as they set
          off to become the first to navigate the Blue Nile from source to sea.
          The epic 3,260 mile descent down the world's greatest and deadliest 
          river has eluded humankind for centuries - until now! Ride shotgun on
          the team's 16-foot rafts as they crash through the rapids in Ethiopia's
          desert canyons. Battle through some of the world's most extreme whitewater
          rapids with renowned kayaker, Gordon Brown. Over the arduous, four month
          journey, the team faces nearly in-surmountable challenges - from crocodile
          attacks to armed bandits and arrests. Through breathtaking cinematography, 
          Mystery of the Nile reveals a wondrous region and abundant treasures, from
          Tissisat Falls and the wonders of Egypt to the forgotten black pyramids of
          Meroe and 12th century churches that were carved into sheer rock.
