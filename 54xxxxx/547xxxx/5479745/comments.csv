What is causing most of the changes in the sol system, is we are heading into a front of greater gravimetric influence in extrasolar space as we transit the arm of our galaxy.

It's a cycle this system goes through every 250 million years per cycle of galactic transit, with lesser cycles as per Mayan calenders, 26,000, 52,000 years etc, the nature of existence is cyclic, this is an ancient understanding and is the reality of what is occurring.

2012 is not going to mean the end of out planet or life on it, unless some nation unleashes strategic nuclear warheads, 2012 will pass without global destruction.

Many will shift spiritually and psychically though, there are influences we will experience as we pass into the opposite galactic plane, many shall evolve to what we were in the stellar ages, those spiritually cultured but not yet at that level will find such enlightenment much easier to achieve as we pass through 21/12/12 especially noticeable for the three years past that to 21/12/15, as such 21/06/09-21/06/15 very much indicates the precursor shift into the Aquarius age although from 21/12/12 the transit through the galactic plane will begin to affect everybody on the planet, just moreso those already on a path in mysticism, Gnosticism and are noetic etc

Now i'm downloading this, wonder what nonsense or enlightenment it holds, always intregued by the 2012 material, so much confusion when there should be clarity, for 'tis easy enough to fathom, forsooth

Peace. : )
