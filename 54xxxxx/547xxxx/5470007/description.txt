International Handbook of Anger: Constituent and Concomitant Biological, Psychological, and Social Processes
Springer | January 1, 2010 | ISBN 0387896759 | 562 pages | PDF | 7 MB

From the individual rage-driven violence of domestic abuse to the destructive causes and lasting consequences of large scale ethnic and political conflict, anger and its effects are ubiquitous in human life, and are the focus of intense study across many scientific disciplines: fields as varied as affective neuroscience, health science, psychology, psychophysiology, and sociology have all contributed to recent advances in the understanding of anger. The editors of the International Handbook of Anger bring these major contributions together for a unique portrayal of the many aspects of angerâ€”evolutionary and biological bases, behavioral processes and effects, physiological concomitants, clinical aspects, and role in the larger social pictureâ€”with coverage that is both wide-ranging and integrative. State-of-the-art findings by highly regarded experts are organized for maximum utility, with extensive cross-referencing between chapters and editorsâ€™ introductory commentary linking the bookâ€™s sections.
