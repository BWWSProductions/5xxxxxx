All Saints are one of the most successful girl bands of all time, with a string of 
hits including Pure Shores  - later memorably used in the Leonardo Di-Caprio film 
The Beach â€“ Never Ever, Black Coffee and Bootie Call.

Their glamorous good looks, insouciant attitude and irreverent, self-penned lyrics 
changed the face of pop music in the late Nineties. 

Clad in combat trousers and full of brazen self-confidence, All Saints offered a 
real alternative to their manufactured rivals, the Spice Girls, and gave a shot of 
life into an industry otherwise dominated by the last acts of Britpop and meek boy 
bands. 

They were an instant success, scoring eight top ten singles - including five No1s 
- and two double-platinum selling albums, THEY also hit the headlines with a string of celebrity boyfriends and a spate of highly publicised spats - and in 2001, after a tumultuous four years together, the girls - Natalie and Nicole Appleton, Shaznay Lewis and Melanie Blatt - split acrimoniously. 

They launched solo careers but the individual projects they pursued were no match fortheir joint achievements and in 2006 the girls - by then all thirty-something women and with husbands and children admitted they had missed each other, reconciled theirdifferences and hit the charts again.
