Wenona is back for her second single match up of the year. Ranked 6th, this former gymnast is still ripped like she was in college. Wenona spends about 2 hours a day in the gym and it shows. 

Welcome Krissy Lynn to Ultimate Surrender. Like every wrestler before her that had an older brother and grew up a tomboy, Krissy thinks she can win her first match against a top ten opponent. Krissy made a hell of a first showing, but learned that experience will win out over brute strength any day.

Krissy does remarkably well for her first time, and I mean remarkably. She still got her ass kicked and Wenona got to fuck her good, but it was a solid effort! We will see Krissy again soon.
