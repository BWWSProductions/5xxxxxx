Lil Flip - Clover Kush


Wesley Eric Weston, Jr. (born March 3, 1981), better known by his stage name Lilâ€™ Flip, is a multi-Platinum American rapper. He is known for his freestyle ability and claims to have been on 1000 mixtapes.

Lilâ€™ Flipâ€™s career was launched when he released his first album â€œThe Leprechaunâ€. The album quickly gained national attention and spawned the hit single â€œI Can Do Thatâ€. The album sold over 100,000 copies regionally and gained attention from Def Jam South, A & R, and well-known Houston rapper Scarface. He was briefly signed to Def Jam, but abruptly left the label a few years later after concerns about his financial earnings. He soon signed to Loud Records and began recording his first national debut album.

While recording his album, he was apparently shot by unknown assailants in a drive-by shooting. He survived the attack and pressed on to finish the album. At the age of 20, Lilâ€™ Flip released his sophomore album â€œUndaground Legendâ€, his first nationally released album, which included the hit single â€œThe Way We Ballâ€ and a remix to his hit â€œI Can Do Thatâ€. The album reached platinum status even though it didnâ€™t get much promotion from Loud Records.

Lilâ€™ Flip recorded his third album â€œU Gotta Feel Meâ€ on Sony Records. This album was more commercial and featured Ludacris, Three 6 Mafia, and others.
