   -------------------------------------                                    
                                                                            
   Updated in v1.01:                                                        
                                                                            
   Added steam cloud support for all in-game progress                       
                                                                            
   Fixed a bug where following a link to a web page from a popup within     
   the game would make all other in-game popups attempt to take the user    
   to the same web page                                                     
                                                                            
   Updated the readme to include additional known issues                    
                                                                            
   Fixed a crash that would occur when detecting certain input devices. A   
   warning is now shown when Shatter detects an incompatible device         
                                                                            
   Fixed an issue with leader board times for boss rush where times over    
   40 minutes would wrap back around to zero                                
                                                                            
   Added detection of modified game data. When the user has local           
   modifications to their data Shatter will enter offline mode and will     
   not upload scores                                                        
                                                                            
   Fixed an issue where Shatter would incorrectly enter offline mode if     
   the user had set their Steam account to appear offline. Shatter will     
   now enter offline mode if Steam is offline
