It'll keep you entertained for a few hours, its a great little arcade game to have on your computer to play when you're bored.

The graphics are wonderful, the music is awesome, the gameplay is just plain amazing for a block breaker game. All kinds of different things in this game to keep you entertained the entire playthrough.

Also its got nice physics for the blocks."
