The Jersey Devil; The Yeren 

For this investigation, Team Truth welcomes Kris Williams from Ghost Hunters. The New Jersey Devil is one of America's oldest legendary creatures, with sightings going back over 300 years. It's said that the Devil was the thirteenth child born to Mother Leeds back in the 1700s. The origin story of this "dark prince" is clearly folkloric.
