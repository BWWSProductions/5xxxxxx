[V],mothergoose56,2010-03-31T23:46Z,"Something going on with this encode, it was glitching in one player for me late last night but was OK in Winamp so I didn't freak out. I will re-encode the source flacs and re-up a new 03-30 128k O&A encode. "
[V],mothergoose56,2010-04-01T06:42Z,"I only had one comment out of hundreds of downloads (over at d3m0n0id) - has anyone else had problems with this file? I suppose it could have just been a glitch while moving it to that particular device I had it on. 

I'd hate to kill it if it's fine, I just ran the archive mp3 through an integrity checker and it passed. Strange. I'll try more research and if it is indeed corrupt I'll up a new 03-30 encode tomorrow before the 04-01 show is upped. "
