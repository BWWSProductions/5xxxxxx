,MikeHaggarKJ,2010-03-29T22:17Z,What's the original location of the savegames? (ie where was it in the original skidrow release)
,FREE-T,2010-03-29T23:09Z,Does this work with the reloaded version?
,cirios83,2010-03-29T23:10Z,"holy shit

,cirios83,2010-03-29T23:26Z,"Scorpion1311       Thank you for teling me to read the NFO
Now i know where to put my savegames.Thanks again.I was really stupid."
,doradhorror,2010-03-30T01:53Z,Thanks and congrats on your green skull man!
,GMD463,2010-03-30T04:26Z,it would be nice to know where the original save files are...
,TempDude29,2010-03-30T08:25Z,Works great! Thanks!
,GMD463,2010-03-30T09:00Z,Scorpion. Go fuck yourself. Die. Die. Die.
,h3ll4b0y,2010-03-30T12:48Z,"scorpion is so right, read the fukin NFO ppl it takes 5 minutes and it will solve hours of trouble"
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-03-30T14:12Z,"For everybody:

1) Your saves are located in your game folder (RELOADED)
2) This works flawlessly
3) This adds some stuff to the game:
a) Badass revolver, really cheap if you use it at the start of the game
b) Parachute with an skull drawing
c) Normal parachute if you wish to change
d) Shit semiautomatic assault rifle with scope
e) Muscle car with attached guns
f) MONSTER TRUCK WITH ATTACHED GUNS
g) ArmoredBoat with guns"
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-03-30T18:21Z,"Johannes, if you used RELOADED's version your savegames should be RIGHT at your install directory.

BTW, DO NOT FUCKING COMPLAIN ABOUT SOMETHING YOU GOT FOR FREE"
,_Metal_Guitar_,2010-03-30T20:56Z,"@johannes15...is this torrent not free then?

If you want carefree gaming, try buying it. On a console.

Otherwise stop complaining and try fixing it yourself like everyone else with more than 2 brain cells."
,GMD463,2010-03-30T21:58Z,"You people bitching about reading the nfo and dont complain about free shit, are the only ones complaining."
,GMD463,2010-03-31T00:35Z,How is that complaining. Srsly. Your mind. Its weak. Go. Die.
,theloston3,2010-03-31T08:31Z,"This problem seems to persist, and let me make myself clear, I have never even got to play the game yet. What happens is, I run JustCause2_Launcher, load english, and the game opens, then closes. Says

Fatal DirectX error!
Code: 15
Result: 0x80070057: E_INVALIDARG

The game will now exit. Try starting the game with /failsafe if the problem persist.

Now it says that without this DLC and the normal JustCause2.exe, I am using Reloadeds version of JC2, but I refuse to believe that just because they are 2 different uploaders, a core file was changed in the game. So in terms, this DLC should work with any uploaders JC2 if it is the correct game. Yet this still happens. Before it would just run, then not even load the game or anything. Just run the language thing, then stop after i click finish or whatever. Now it doesn't open the language executable and just runs the game, but has the error, and this happened after I installed the SKIDROW version of the crack. I still don't think that would be why, but maybe, please let me know. Also, I downloaded SKIDROWS crack because appearently Reloaded has missing files. Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit"
,blessthesheep,2010-04-01T07:51Z,anyone got a cd key
,CommentsAbove,2010-04-01T09:47Z,"Naive idoits. This game is meant for Windows Vista, set compatibility to Windows Vista."
,ambar_47,2010-04-02T13:00Z,"To all Reloaded version players, Just extract this patch to a different location instead of the original location of the game. For eg, make a folder called JC DLC on your desktop and extract it there. Now, open JC DLC folder, there will be a dlc folder. Copy this folder to the folder where Just Cause 2 is installed, don't even touch other files. Thats it, play the game. No need to change save game locations or any such shit."
,SubGum,2010-04-02T18:18Z,"Works like a charm on Win7 64x over the Skidrow release.  Just had to move my saved game to the location as indicated in the readme, and viola!"
,Raventhorn,2010-04-03T13:59Z,"Downloading this now, have the Skid release of JC2, so it'll probly work :D

@CommentsAbove
Its not ""meant for Vista"", its a GFWL release, so its meant for Windows - any version ;)"

1.open you just cause 2 folder
2.copy all the files that say ""justcause2savXX""    where xx is the save file number (non-important)
3.open your C:\User\yourusername\appdata\local\skidrow\SAVES\
4. paste all the save files into that folder
5. Restart the game. you should now be able to continue the game with the awesome extras."

,Failseeders,2010-06-18T13:47Z,"It's actually made for Windows 7, not fucking Vista, faggot.

Also, I've bought this game, sadly not the Limited Edition version, and it's with Steam, ffs.
So where do I install the stuff to for the Steam version of JC2?"
,XRA,2010-06-23T15:24Z,"Just a quick question.  I hit the DLC button, saw the content, but couldn't find how to actually get the stuff.  Please help.  Thanks"

,ZombieJoN,2010-07-27T19:24Z,"This DLC torrent works perfect with no viruses detected by COMODO, MalwareBytes, or WSE.

Downloaded, copied to skidrow folder and played. At first I did not have all my saved games, so then I copied all the files in my Justcause2 folder and pasted them in the new skidrow folder this torrent creates. Game works perfect and saves are no a problem.

1. Open downloaded torrent using winRAR. 
2. Run the launcher that is included in this torrent.
3.Copied all of the existing files in c:program/justcause2 to the new SKIDROW foler located - C:Users/YOURUSER/AppData/Local/SKIDROW/SAVES/8190
4. restart the game.

!make sure to create a system backup before doing this.

Hope this helps."

if you have problems with the save files then the new save location will be this: 

C:Users/YOURUSER/AppData/Local/SKIDROW/SAVES 

then copy the saves from the old saves map and put them there.
