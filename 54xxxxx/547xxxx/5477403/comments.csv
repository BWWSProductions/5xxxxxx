,xiIix,2010-04-19T22:42Z,"AWESOME. Can't believe I found this in 1080p. And PS3T rips are sterile clean for their size, too, so this is a good find."
,MIdniteRayne,2010-04-20T08:02Z,This is the greatest upload known to man. I need to get you a fucking beer man!
,xiIix,2010-04-20T15:29Z,"Seriously, if there was a way to buy someone a beer, I'd have bought these guys a beer a while ago. A lot of their releases are great films that are hard to find."
,xiIix,2010-04-20T15:30Z,"If there was a way to buy someone a beer on the internet, that is."
,Lord-Darkstorn,2010-04-30T23:57Z,Totally remember this film from my childhood...brilliant upload.
,amathaka,2011-03-19T20:45Z,"The quality for a & v is fantastic!
but it's a shame about the black letterbox.
Either way I ended up re encoding it without letterbox and at a smaller size (1200x512)
The 80s film simply isnt very sharp even with the highest quality blu-ray technology, so it can stand to get a size reduction, however this was only possible at the quality I now have thanks to the original quality of the torrent (and of course, some great audio quality!)"

,ThaPyratBay,2011-09-10T03:36Z,The soundtrack has good beats!
