,liekpasts,2010-12-01T14:42Z,"The smallest file in the torrent  disc4.iso (165MB)  is the so called Windows 7 recovery disc, possibly customized (branded) by Toshiba. Can be used to repair some problems in the existing windows instalation. Can not be used to reinstall/restore windows on a newly formatted partition or hard drive. :("
,liekpasts,2010-12-01T14:51Z,"Please seed!

Dear uploader and whoever might have downloaded a full copy previously:  please seed these files again for a while at least!  
This torrent has 0 seeds and about 30 leechers with the help of DHT, and the total availabilitiy in the swarm is only 0.522%. So,  everybody's got unusable half downloaded files and some laptops waiting for the chance to be recovered to factory state with the legal OS we have already paid for.

Thank you in advance! :)

-----------------------------
For those who do not object paying twice for the same OS, Toshiba backup media can be ordered (baught) here for about 35 EUR:

https://backupmedia.toshiba.eu/    (for products sold outside US).

https://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/serviceUnitVerification.jsp?orderType=SFF    (Possibly for US products).

The page asks to enter your notebook's serial number."
,liekpasts,2010-12-02T21:56Z,"NB! to any newcomers!
In case you consider joining to this torrent - be aware, that, as it stands today, the download of the 3 large (and most significant) ISO files in this torrent will stop at about 52.2% and stay there indefinitely, unless someone who had downloaded all the files when this torrent was first uploaded  comes back and starts seeding again. :(

Only the 165MB windows live recovery disc is available at 100%, and it can't be used to reinstall your OS."
,temoshi,2011-03-29T19:55Z,"Someone please seed!

I'll seed for a few weeks once it's done."
,ehonda666,2011-05-20T00:58Z,PLEASE SEED SOMEONE! STUCK AT 52.2%
