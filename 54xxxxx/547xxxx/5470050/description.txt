This guy failed at suicide 30 times. He reached Nirvana. The Buddhists suggest this means he is the Buddha of the Age. They say he is not warmed up yet.
I read this second volume and he is a mental Leviathan.
He says flat out ..

"No man knows the time or day but the father." in reference to the second coming. Then he says
No man knows the time or day on an ACCIDENT but the father of the accident.
And the accident was Oct 31 st 2008 at 1:38 PM

I am getting the third volume and I will upload it soon.
So far he has published 5 volumes averaging 150K words in 5 months and explains he is writing infinite books.
I am uncertain what this means but he appears rather vengeful.
He suggests people give all his books away and he will not enforce his copyright.

I am uncertain what to think honestly but his books are worldwide and quite popular in Asia already.
He is quite an angry author thats for sure.
Maybe he is just the anti-Christ.
