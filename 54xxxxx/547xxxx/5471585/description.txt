using XYPlorer to ultra-tweak your PC for Gaming etc
========================================
	first you download a shell replacement software named EvilDesk. (its a GPL=free software.)   	http://evildesk.netevil.org/
	or use Aston2 (paid but you can get the crack.) 
	it kills your windows shell- mean no icon or explorer.exe. and combined with that you use xyplorer= your PC's lot of RAM / CPU memory is free for other uses like gaming or whatever stuff you do.
