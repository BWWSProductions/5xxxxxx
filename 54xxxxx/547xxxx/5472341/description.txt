Description
In Jamaica in 1959, a 21 year-old music fan called Chris Blackwell created a seemingly insignificant music label that over time would become one of the most powerful and influential record companies in the world. Three years after its launch, having established his Island Records as a hit-making enterprise, the young entrepreneur transplanted the operation to London, where he set about releasing the best in authentic West Indian sounds for a growing British fan-base. And while ventures into rock and pop later brought his celebrated imprint even greater success, works by an array of talent, from Jimmy Cliff and Lee â€˜Scratchâ€™ Perry to Bob Marley and Sly & Robbie, always ensured Islandâ€™s heartbeat remained Jamaican--a tradition that has continued to the present day.

Charting Islandâ€™s rise from its very origins in to the modern age, War Ina Babylon not only provides a fascinating insight into the changing sound of Jamaican music over the past 40 years, but also brings together some of the greatest ska, rock steady and reggae recordings of all time. In doing so, the collection tells the story of both Reggae and the celebrated label itself, through the 64 essential tracks
