Plot: Discover the glorious variety of life on Earth and the innovative, intelligent and sometimes bizarre tactics animals and plants employ in order to survive. More than four years in the making, taking full advantage of the latest advances in filming technology, this breathtaking ten-part blockbuster reveals the natural worldâ€™s most remarkable behaviour in unprecedented depth and detail.

Full of amazing filming â€˜firstsâ€™ on every continent and in every habitat â€“ from 250 six foot Humboldt squid hunting
as a pack to Komodo dragons
(the worldâ€™s largest venomous animal) stalking buffalo and cheetahs (notorious lone hunters) working cooperatively to hunt prey twice their size â€“ this is evolution in front of your eyes. Yet this astonishing series is not simply about revelation, it is also about entertainment. With sequences that inspire awe, wonder, sadness and humour, Life allows us to truly relate to the animals and their endeavours, and to understand and appreciate them as never before.

Narrated by David Attenborough.
