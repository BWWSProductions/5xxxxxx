,victorlazlo,2010-04-11T02:00Z,Is there any way to get rid of the subtitles?
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-05-10T04:35Z,"WOW, thx a lot. 25 Frame rate  for BDRip is unusual. The Blue-Ray source had 23.976 didn't it?
Would be nice if someone would post a snap shot."
,kayoslogic,2010-05-14T17:50Z,any one having any luck getting this to play?  Maybe my player stinks
,dexterdexterstjock,2010-06-03T10:38Z,are the subtitles hard coded or can you get rid of them?
,dexterdexterstjock,2010-06-03T12:34Z,"answered my own question. of course you can.

@victorlazio just turn off the subtitle track."
,cpratt22,2010-06-13T07:02Z,I am just wondering if anyone can say anything about the quality of the torrent? I found the sample to be a bit. Jittery. 
,kithylin,2010-06-24T17:58Z,"this works fine, just make sure you have enough cpu horsepower to run this!

I tried playing this on a 1.8ghz dual core with AMD/ATI HD4650 card, and it would run 30 seconds then video would freeze with 100% cpu and 60% gpu load.

Then i tried it on a 3.4ghz dual core, and similar video card and it would run okay, and stutter every other minute or so.

Then went and tried it on my ""big"" 3.2ghz intel quad core with an ATI/AND HD5750 and it ran perfect with no issues, 20% - 50% cpu usage on all cores and 30% gpu usage.

using windows 7 64-bit and Media Player Classic 64-bit on all machines, along with ffdshow for sse2, and ac3filter 64-bit."
,kithylin,2010-06-26T07:40Z,"After 2 days, my first episode/disc finished today and i just finished watching it on the house's 1080p Samsung LED HDTV and i just must say.. freaking beautiful, this is everything you expect from high definition: crisp color, excellent quality.

Well worth the time, however long it takes to download. Thank you for sharing this with us."

,minjigga,2012-01-30T15:09Z,"To those of you who are wondering about the frame rate:

This is from the BBC, which is European..  so I'm guessing this source is PAL, which is 25 fps.."
