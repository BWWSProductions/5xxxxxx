Opie and Anthony XM/Sirius show commercial-free uncensored VBR 128k mp3
Rip+Edit mg56

04/01/10 Rundown: April Fools, Whacky Pitcher, Turk February, Cobra, 
Guy Earle, Pearl Jam, 90's Rock, Steve from Yellowstone prank calls,
Ian Halperin phones in, Nick Cannon, Serial Killer, Cocks in a Box

Note: I didn't hear a proper show exit (could have missed it) and I 
left in the Cocks in a Box replay as it was referenced in the show.

Also - anyone having trouble playing back today's or the 03-30/31 
shows please let me know. I actually think the issue is my device is
on the fritz, but the one comment from someone else having an issue 
has me concerned.

Oh yea and no live show tomorrow either - I will up the Worst of.
