HOW TO PLAY


Emulator Setup
It can happen that there are, at times, someone that it finds the white screen after he has loaded the rom in the emulator.. 
to correct this bug is very simple.. 
it will be enough for you to plan the emulator as in the image.


[IMG]http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/4936/74197289.png[/IMG]


when you will have planned the emulator as in the image, loaded again the rom and the game should depart. 
In the case in which this didn't have to happen planned the modality Flash 64K
instead of Flash 128K. 


Don't forget to say thanks
