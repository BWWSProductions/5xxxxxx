,PanzerVitch,2010-05-26T03:52Z,"@masochdesade I tried this myself with DSTT and I know It works fine with original R4, haven't tried with other cards."
,edgeuser,2010-07-07T10:39Z,you guys all use the wrong cart ive got a normal edge and i havent got any problem with almost every game. so buy an edge and you dont have to use all the shit that shit can only crash your ds

,Eggmonster,2011-03-31T18:39Z,Does someone know what i did wrong? I put the game on my R4 and add.nds but when i play it the game has ''no title'' and when i press it it turns white! please help
,haddadbruce,2011-05-24T05:39Z,does anyone know why once i beat it i can't do the kanto region? i beat the elite four and it says game over. and then it won't go back to the title screen or go to wherever it's supposed to after i beat them.
,mmikern,2011-08-04T14:36Z,"i added .nds using no$gba and zoomer and it said ""cartridge not found""... so what do i do?"
,tykep44,2012-03-18T21:31Z,on acekard2i updated enough to work on nintendo 3ds(oddly not enough to support 3ds games) this works... but so far I can't really enter and leave houses normally.. I get black screen... I can enter houses like a few times before this happens though.
