   Ondrej, a young boy who loves bees and bats, is introduced to his   
   new mother, a woman much younger than his father. Her brings her a  
   bowl of flower petals which she starts to throw in the air and      
   then gives out a shriek, as she discovers several bats in the       
   bottom of the bowl. In a rage, Ondrej's father picks the boy up     
   and hurls him against a wall. Then as the boy lays in a stupor the  
   father promises the Holy Virgin to dedicate the boy to her if she   
   will spare his life. The boy lives and Ondrej is raised in a        
   strict monastic order, where he is mentored by a very pious         
   warrior monk, Armin. One day after being chastised for no good      
   reason, he escapes and returns home. Armin heads out to bring him   
   back. With his father dead, Ondrej becomes lord of the castle and   
   becomes engaged to his father's widow. Near the end, Armin shows    
   up and attempts to get Ondrej to come back to the order.
