,r.ot69civ,2011-02-08T10:24Z,"What a bunch of leechers sucking on this torrent.  I'm stuck to this great download (thanks to the uploader!) for almost 2 weeks now and just passed the 50%.  This compared to the 400 GB that I already uploaded for this torrent!!!  My average upload speed is 1.5 MB/s while I'm getting a lousy average of 60 KB/s!!!
Just to make sure I do not get smacked by my provider, I have set a max on my upload to 500 KB/s, thanks to all those slow leachers out there!! "
,deadvillager,2011-02-12T16:09Z,"MAybe someone can help me. I've set several movies to download first and they have finished. But I can't open them in their folder, only through Bitlord. When I try normaly, Windows media says it can't play the file. I've tried shutting off Bitlord and playing them but they still don't work. I have done a manual hashcheck and it came up fine, any suggestions?"
