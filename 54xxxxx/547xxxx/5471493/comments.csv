Perfect rip, but I don't think all the hype about this movie is justified."
,biglargo,2010-03-30T06:16Z,Yeah was inspired by the ps3 team ...really like their uploads just wanted to give back...
,Skip2012,2010-03-31T23:52Z,well big won't you be apart of the ps3 team
,collapsd,2010-04-01T22:45Z,"OMFG! This is SOO SLOW!!
I find that it's better if I just stop it for the day, and start it for about 5mins. That way it'll DL from leechers @~1.5MB/s, but then it drops off to ~1kB/s.
I have a Ratio of 4.2 after DAYS and stuck ~81%, wtf?!"
