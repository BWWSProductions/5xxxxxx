Question for Blacktroy: Do you have a keygen that works with the Standard edition, not just Premium?

Thanks!"
,orm123,2010-05-25T11:25Z,"Hi, Act is great!, however, I must be doing something wrong with the key gen. No problem with serial number, no problem adding the installation code to the key gen. (I put it in manually not cut and paste)The problem is that is as far as I can go. I cannot figure out why the activation code will not generate. Can anyone help me please, the time is running out for the trial and I have put a lot of work into the database!"
,cyberkeg,2010-06-17T04:33Z,Can you please create a separate torrent for the KeyGen?  Many Thanks in advance.
,tsen1962,2010-06-29T20:34Z,the key generated is not working; whether choice of country zone while installation is problem? I chose Asia Pacific instead of default location. Please advise blacktroy!

,price79,2010-07-07T09:41Z,"Hello to all those having problems you need to high light and copy then paste the instillation code one section at a time adding the dashes - yourself, I did this loads of times yesterday and got an activation code everytime. 

So do not type the instillation code in manually it will not work!! Just copy and paste all the parts individually you only have to add the dashes manually.

Hope this helps.

P.s Great torrent many thanks"
,Shaydee_Lady,2010-07-30T18:32Z,"I dl ACT from the site suggested and followed all instructions given on here but it wouldn't let me register. I tried time and time again and finally rectified it by generating a different serial number. It was plain sailing after that.

The joys of computing lol

I'll report back if there are any problems later on.

Thank you BLACKTROY for a great dl. "

,imnotyou,2011-03-30T06:58Z,Anyone have the Act! Exporter?
,telecomsearch,2011-04-10T00:18Z,"!! --DO NOT DOWNLOAD--!!!!
PROGRAM INFECTED WITH A VIRUS THAT CORRUPTS THE WINDOWS 7 OR XP OPERATING SYSTEM.

It causes all program start applications to open Windows Media Center. The only solution if you download and try to install this program from this malicious creator is to reload W7 or XP into a new directory and then spend hours transferring data and reloading programs. And that's in addition to the $60 and several hours you'll pay Microsoft Support to help you.

,Westave,2011-04-20T18:39Z,Anything new on the keygen(erating) a serial that works with the current trial download? Thanks in advance!
,frankvalle69,2012-03-24T09:13Z," i got me Sage ACT Premium 2011 from the main website and downloaded the keygen from some uploaded called  *EnTek 
now, feel free to get the keygen from that asshole but dont install the program, it got some 50 diferent viruses, the only good thing is the keygen, i cant explain why these specific programs have been altered with viruses"
