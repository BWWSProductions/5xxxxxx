    Professor Brian Cox visits some of the most stunning       
    locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature     
    have carved natural wonders across the solar system.     
                                                              
    The worlds that surround our planet are all made of        
    rock, but there the similarity ends. Some have a          
    beating geological heart, others are frozen in time.     
    Brian travels to the tallest mountain on earth, the       
    volcano Mauna Kea on Hawaii, to show how something as      
    basic as a planet's size can make the difference          
    between life and death. Even on the summit of this       
    volcano, Brian would stand in the shade of the tallest    
    mountain in the solar system, an extinct volcano on        
    Mars called Olympus Mons, which rises up 27 km.           
                                                             
    Yet the fifth wonder in the series isn't on a planet at   
    all. It's on a tiny moon of Jupiter. The discoveries       
    made on Io have been astonishing. This fragment of rock   
    should be cold and dead, yet, with the volcanic          
    landscape of eastern Ethiopia as a backdrop, Brian        
    reveals why Io is home to extraordinary lakes of lava      
    and giant volcanic plumes that erupt 500 km into the      
    sky.
