AND FUCK YOU DJ BLAZE, I PROBABLY WOULD LISTEN TO YOUR TRACKS AND PROMOTE THEM BUT SINCE YOU'VE FUCKED UP THE ID TAGS COMPLETELY, BEING SCARED OF SOMEONE MIGHT RENAME THEM AND TAKE AWAY YOUR NAME FROM IT AND FORGET IT WAS YOURS. I COULD ASWELL BE LISTENING TO A RADIO WITH RUSSIAN FOLK MUSIC AND NOT UNDERSTAND A SHIT. FUCK YOU!

To all who did not get this. The ID tags are set that www.just4dance.fw.hu is set as text on Artist, Album Artist, Track Name, Composer and Comments.

Dear Dj Blaze, I hope you die a painful death"

,TechnoDjZ,2010-08-20T07:43Z,"My dear =bou24= , if u think that renaming about 70 tracks it will ll spend all your life doing this , i'm sorry to say , but - FUCK YOU ! ... 
If you don't like this fuckin' music , why did you download'em ? Why did you spend your life doing this ?
And , as your mention about his website - like you say , Yes ! , I had to wait 1 hour , 1 hour and half or maybe 2 hours [ of course , it is embarrassing ] to download a pack. But it's worth !!!! The tracks are recorded or ripped to 320 Kbps and they have pure quality , pure clarity.
If you don't like what Blaze doin' , go , you fuckin' faggot and buy all the tracks if you don't like to spend 1 hour to download ! 
Cheers Blaze , all your fuckin' music is damn crazy !!!!!!!
go and download ........ !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
