Soon as I'm done seeding family guy I'll put up another good stand up I think you'll like. In fact I have two more I'll put up. "
[T],Magash,2010-04-10T20:19Z,Thanks Agentbay I got the initial-Seeding thing working.
[T],Magash,2010-04-10T20:24Z,"Oh yeah. I lost everything on the computer when I had work done to it and lost the Bill Burr before I was finished. 

I just put it back up and I'll be sure to leave it for a few days plus (thanks to you) I got the Initial-Seeding thing working now. 

Thanks for the help. "
