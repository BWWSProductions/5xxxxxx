
Glenn Miller - The Best Of CD(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
_______________________________________________

Glenn Miller was a wartime orchestra leader who died in a mysterious aeroplane crash, 
which is explained in the DVD documentary Glenn Millers Last Flight (*recommended).

This genre of music was more in tune with my parents generation, but it overspilled,
and we heard quite a lot of it via 78s and the wonderfully drawling James Stewart 
playing his role in The Glenn Miller Story which seemed to be on TV back then quite 
often (now also on DVD!)
 
So, even though the music was cringeworthy as far as our peers were concerned, 
(we wouldn't have been Hip in the mid-60s if they knew we held a light for 
Glenn Miller!), but in all honesty, some of his music gave you the old adrenaline 
rush / backbone shiver, nevertheless. 

Call it getting older, call it nostalgia, call it what you like, and these days, 
if my freinds and family see a Glenn Miller CD in my rack, well, I will own up to it. 

I ENJOY his music, I dont care, its a bit different to what I listen to usually, and
a change is as good as a rest as they say and coupled with the nostalgia, the music 
seems to time-slip you back to the days when you listened to it with Mum & Dad there
in your youth, and it was only being petulant that made us say we didnt enjoy it back 
then, because in actual fact, we did!

A nostalgic trip into the past when the big bands were great and the music played gave 
pleasure to so many, as it still does today.....
