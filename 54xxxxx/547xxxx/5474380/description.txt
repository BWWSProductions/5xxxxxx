CLASSIC BRITISH COMEDIES

One of my favourite comic actors from a bygone era, This is just one of the films in my collection of Alastair Sim movies to get you started.
Please show your appreciation by helping to seed this thank you.


LAUGHTER IN PARADISE
One of Sim's most delightful comedies, Laughter in Paradise is founded on a deliciously dastardly premise.
A practical joker, Henry Russell (Hugh Griffith), leaves Â£50,000 to each of his four relatives on condition they complete an unusual task. When the relatives gather for the reading of the will, his spinster sister Agnes (Fay Compton) learns she must earn her living for a month as a maid; rakish playboy Simon (Guy Middleton) must marry the first girl he meets; meek bank clerk Herbert (George Cole) must try and hold-up his bank and retired army officer/ novelist Deniston (Alastair Sim) must commit a petty crime and spend a month in jail. A deftly executed and splendidly acted affair from prodigious director-producer Mario Zampi (Too Many Crooks), the film also skewers the human capacity for avarice and greed.
