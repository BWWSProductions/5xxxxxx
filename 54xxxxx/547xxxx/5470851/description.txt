[color=yellow]The Machinist (2004) BRRip XviD AC3-SANTi[/color]
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361862/

Plot: Trevor Reznik is a lathe-operator who suffers from insomnia and hasn't slept in a year.
      Slowly, he begins to doubt his sanity as increasingly bizarre things start happening at
      work and at home. Haunted by a deformed co-worker who no one seems to think exists, and an
      ongoing stream of indecipherable Post-It notes he keeps finding on his fridge, he attempts
      to investigate what appears to be a mysterious plot against him and, in the process,
      embroils two women in his madness.
