The Medic Droid was started in 2005 with Chris Donathon, Hector Bagnod and Johnny Chavez (Droid). Bagnod and Donathon first met in 2003, but Donathon moved away from the city after they met, only to return (and begin the band) a few years later.[1] The group gained a strong initial following through the social networking site MySpace; by mid-2008 the song "Fer Sure" had logged almost 2 million plays on the site[1] and the group had accumulated over 100,000 friends there.[2] Soon they were noticed by their now former manager Avery Andon who brought the band to New York where they played their first live show opening for Enter Shikari at The Bowery Ballroom and caught the eye of A&R's from Epic Records who would later go on to sign the band. The group eventually made two new songs "Keeping Up With The Joneses" and "FScene8", enlisting the help of Australian DJ S3RL to remix these songs. In 2007, Johnny Droid left the band, due to issues with the other members and created his own one-man band called J0hnny. In 2009, he announced he was making a band with S3RL called R0bots. A few months after Johnny Droids departure, The Medic Droid hired Storm. Storm stuck with them for a few months, and then left the band in early 2008. They later hired Greg Rudawski as drummer for live shows.

The Medic Droid was signed to Modern Art Records, a local Phoenix indie label distributed by Epic Records. They wrote and recorded their debut album What's Your Medium? and it was released June 10, 2008. What's Your Medium reached #33 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.[3]

The band was heavily inspired by 1980's popular culture, taking their name from a character in the Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back,[4] writing a song based on a catch phrase from Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, and even recording a version of the Madonna anthem "Into The Groove"

FUDGESOCIETY NOTE
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I'm personally not a fan of Live albums, and greatest hits. Because it's honestly redundant. Why have more than what you need unless you're a die hard fan. And if you're a die hard fan of a band, you wouldn't be torrenting their music. You would be supporting and buying, which I still support for every band album I upload. I promote torrenting, seeing if the band is good, then going out and buying the album. In no way do I promote the soul use of my torrents without intent to buy the album. Don't ruin the internet for us, these torrents are just a way to see how a band sounds, and find any missing tracks that you might not have.

Thank you and please seed. The support of my torrents, will greatly increase the amount of uploading I do. More seeds, more torrents, more smileys! :D
