,GPB2008,2010-04-01T20:32Z,"Not For Nothing And I'm Not TOTALLY 100% Correct On This, But I Don't Think This Is REALLY An IMAGiNE Release, I Mean, Yes The SOUND Is Hella Better Than The Other Cams, But I Always Thought IMAGiNE's Quality To Be A Bit More Better Than This, And ALSO The Filesize Gets To Me Too, Because IMAGiNE Release Are USUALLY 1.3 - 1.9 Gigs, Not 700 MiB ... But AGAIN, If I'm Wrong, I'm Wrong, Just Sayin...

But THANKS IwannaFan2, This Is 100% Watchable... 

A-8
V-7

Funny & GREAT Movie, Get The Popcorn Ready & ENJOY!!"

,29385729-Unknown,2010-04-02T09:10Z,"Not bad, the audio is good, but it's of low quality, maybe like 48Hz, or 44KHz. I'd probably say like 44Hz, ...

The Video Quality is Pretty damn good, I have my LCD Screens Resolution set to 1080 x 1024 and it seems pretty good, it's a little fuzzy but overall, it's definitely watchable.


My Rating is as follows : A: 6.0, V:6.5 or 7.0.

Decent, Definitely watchable. Thanx.

,slats649,2010-04-26T14:57Z,"Hello,
Where do you leave request for a movie on this website? You seem proactive you may know. I NEED ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" for a couple of kids and I cannot find it. I've looked on other websites and none of the movies I download there play. I'm trying to burn the movie to a DVD so they can play it on thier DVD player. I seem to have the best results off TPB. 
Thank you."

,mrdirectorman,2010-06-07T07:50Z,"Alright folks I'm bringing something totally new to the TS table and I know this is the forum to ask for it. Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!
By the way, THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS AN UPLOAD RATIO!"
