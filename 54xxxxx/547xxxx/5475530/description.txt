Craig Ferguson 2009 03 04 Archbishop Desmond Tutu

Craig's guest is Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Apparently, this was the episode that resulted in the show winning a Peabody award in March 2010 

The resolution is 576x432 and the video quality is watchable but the background flickers very noticeably. As far as I know, this is the only version of this episode that is available.
