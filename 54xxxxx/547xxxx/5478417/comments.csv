,Hutlernn,2010-04-04T08:52Z,"raymondhome should be demoted for this.
It is a bad quality screener, and he calls it a DVDRip (it's nowhere close to that quality).


Mislabelling!!"
,ambhai,2010-04-04T12:28Z,Why the fuck people dont get that there is NO REAL DVD RIP unless the movie is released in DVDs in their FUCKING MARKETS !!!!!
,dexangers,2010-04-04T14:59Z,"thanks so much for all your comments!!!!. 
I'm not going to waste 1.37 GiB of download. 
I will wait for the dvdrip.

I just can't watch a movie if the quality isn't there!"
,JPeterson,2010-04-04T20:12Z,"@ambhai Movies can leak out before the retail date. It's a long way through production, warehouse storage and retail distribution. The Bluray of Transformers 2 was out a month before the retail date."
,ericv1984,2010-04-05T05:56Z,"When I try to burn this to dvd using Windows DVD Maker on Windows 7, it won't burn cause my DVD only holds 2 and a half hours and this copy I have is 2 hours and 36 min. long. Says it won't fit, how to I get it to burn then??? Email me at ericv1984@gmail.com is anyone knows, thanks."
,jadedknutsak,2010-04-05T06:11Z,Don't email this fucker  ericv1984  works for MPAA
,allrockedout,2010-04-05T09:34Z,"im waiting for blue ray, not worth watching any other way, unless you havent seen it"
,NewLogic87,2010-04-05T09:50Z,Anyone know if it's possible to set the subtitles for na'vi only? I tried downloading na'vi only subs from some other sites but they all have huge delays.
,Demonrazor,2010-04-05T15:06Z,"Its Fake, its not DVDrip"
,allrockedout,2010-04-06T09:37Z,"thanks for the upload, still waiting for 1080 blue ray for sure though"

,JPeterson,2010-04-09T00:33Z,"@allrockedout and other that asked about the bluray. MakeMKV was update to support MKB 17 today, so it's possible that an Avatar bluray copy can be made then."
