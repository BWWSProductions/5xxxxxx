,sonofdog,2010-04-06T21:58Z,"I thought the IMDB review was a little harsh. so much so that I am considering reviewing imdb myself. This is slightly overdone at the end perhaps and you have to understand that this is from the viewpoint of a murdered adolescent. Oscars are likely here as much as critical reviews. I was not nearly as disappointed as the reviewer on IMDB. I nearly didn't check it out because of that review, however the actors involved made it essential to watch. You can love/hate the cgi but the acting is fine if not first rate. As for the format its annoyingly in two parts but it does come with optional subs. lets have it in one part HD thankyouverymuch. Love it or hate it it has an acsentuated style along the lines of the tv series ""the forgotten"" (The Christain Slater one). Dead peoples narratives are always a bit weird to appreciate."
