,Moderat1,2010-09-22T02:24Z,"Humble Request -- audio book Dune. Macmillan ed.
Cold you please rip audio book Dune (new edition )
http://us.macmillan.com/all/editorslist/General/DuneAudio
I don't live in the country that have that edition in the library.
The only complete edition I could find was the old one (reader must be a robot, not nice reading at all) and in only 64 kbps
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3517838/The_Complete_Dune_Audio_Books

Pity that kind of classic literature should be made available to a broader public, even to us that cannot buy all the books we would like to read (listen to) and with misfortune to live in the country that doesn't have libraries with that audio book.
Thanks in advance
Cheers

,Dueepjs,2012-04-09T16:11Z,"Blessings on the altruistic head of that genius who uploaded this treasure. After reading these particular classics, it is really good fun listening to the BBC version. And because we cannot hear / find/ buy these treasures in India, thanks be to Pirate bay.
Please keep up this good deed in a naughty world, grin!"
