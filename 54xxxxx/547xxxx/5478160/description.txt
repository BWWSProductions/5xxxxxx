A career-woman becomes a housewife, and immediately becomes bored and disgusted with her new life. Placing her eggs in the basket of her husband's career instead, she becomes ambitious for him. She is very creative about it, including "working on" his boss, in the classic femme-fatale fashion.

Barbara Stanwyck is certainly a perfect casting for her part in this love-triangle, housewife-gone-mad noir. Excellent depictions of the claustrophobic inanity of 1950's middle-class family life: I can imagine this one kept a few husbands up at night.
