This is the Romanian language edition of the Age of Empires 1 PC game.
It's the first and only Romanian language edition of the game.
And it exists thanks to M3 Software (a.k.a. 3ogdy).
Don't bring up things like: 
-why bother translating a game that's more than 10 years old(it's 13 yrs old)
-why didn't you start with the latest edition of the series...
and other questoins like these.
I ' bothered ' translating the game 'cuz I'm a fan and 'cuz I don't want GTA San Andreas,Vice City,Call of Duty and some other games and applications(Kaspersky Antivirus,Ad-Aware..etc.) to be the only set of applications M3 Software translated into Romanian.
Currently  working on other game translations.......gonna make'em public when I finish them...if I do.
