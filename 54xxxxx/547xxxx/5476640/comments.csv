,diskmeedel,2010-04-09T16:09Z,"Yes, this is ep 15. The double episode was named 11 and 12 but was in fact 12 and 13. Ep 11 was a recap of the first 10 episodes. "
,diskmeedel,2010-04-09T16:10Z,I meant 14 ofcourse
,PI22,2010-04-09T18:08Z,"Boy, am I glad that 15=15 again. (hehe)
I am failing to see any proper numbering with ABC, so it is easy to make a mistake like this I guess.
But never blame the uploaders... they are angels to do al this work for nothing!"
,Apocalypticdreams,2010-04-16T19:18Z,"Could we just put episode names on these torrent files because obviously people just can't get their heads out of their asses due to the combination of the double episode and the naming errors. 
We all know that when 11 and 12 go to sindication they will be 11 & 12 and the 12th release will be 13 so let's start naming correctly right off the bat and make it easier for everyone. Episode names would toatly avoid this retarded confusion."
