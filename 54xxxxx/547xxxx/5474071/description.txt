PLOT

Two crew members are stranded on a spacecraft and quickly - and 
horrifically - realize they are not alone. Two astronauts awaken 
in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. 
It's pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low 
rumble and creak from the belly of the ship. They can't remember anything: 
Who are they? What is their mission? With Lt. Payton staying behind 
to guide him via radio transmitter, Cpl. Bower ventures deep into 
the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the 
spacecraft's shocking, deadly secrets are revealed...and the 
astronauts find their own survival is more important than they could 
ever have imagined
