Stephen (Edward Hogg) is a profoundly neurotic young man suffering from agoraphobia, though this is a relatively recent development, and as he ponders the dim prospect of going out for food, he recalls a vacation in Europe with his former best friend Bunny (Simon Farnaby). While Stephen is quiet and shy, Bunny is outgoing to a fault, and he chases women, guzzles booze and bets on anything as if there's no tomorrow. When Stephen gets dumped by his girlfriend, Bunny suggests a trip to Europe is just the thing to cure his blues, especially after he's enjoyed a windfall at the track...
