Part of the British 'Free Cinema' movement, which included Lindsay Anderson's 'Every Day Except Christmas' (daily life at Covent Garden fruit/vegetable market) and 'O Dreamland' (a working-class trip to Margate amusements), and Reisz and Tony Richardson's 'Momma Don't Allow' (about a London jazz club) all made in the mid to late 1950s, before the three went on to direct features in the British 'new wave' social realist genre that drew from their experiences in Free Cinema. The movie was a naturalistic depiction of the members of a South London boys' club, which was unusual in showing the leisure life of working-class teenagers as it was, with skiffle music and cigarettes, cricket, drawing and discussion groups. The film represented Britain at the Venice Film Festival. The BBC made two follow-up films about the same people and youth club, broadcast in 1985.
