thanks for this, it is absolutely pristine and crystal clear.

One stupid question though... how on earth do I get it to play with audio for my regular two speakers on my pc? I don't have a surround sound set, just the two speakers. I hear the audio fine, but I am only getting two of the channels. Any advice? Thanks again :)"
