PLOT

Four heavily armed men, led by Bernard Ryder (John Travolta), board the New York 
City subway 6 train departed from Pelham Bay Park Station at 1:23 p.m., and 
proceed to take control of it.

Meanwhile, MTA dispatcher Walter Garber (Denzel Washington) is assigned to 
the Rail Control Center, due to an ongoing investigation that he took a bribe 
to recommend a Japanese car manufacturer for the next subway car contract. The 
group then uncouple the front car from the rest of the train and hold the 
passengers in this front car hostage. One of the hijackers, Bashkim (Victor 
Gojcaj), kills an undercover police officer in the course of the action. Ryder 
and a former MTA train operator named Ramos settle down in the front of the car, 
while the other hijackers watch the hostages in the back. They demand $10 million 
in ransom money to be paid within 60 minutes. For each minute past the deadline, 
one passenger will be killed. Garber and Ryder exchange conversations through the 
microphone, while his men set up a wi-fi booster apparatus to enable Ryder to 
access his laptop in the tunnel to watch the stock market plunge nearly 1,000 
points during the next hour.
