"This book comes at a time when we are asking searching questions: How exactly do we earn the loyalty, trust and commitment of our people? How do we balance the needs of our organisations to do more with less with the need to create environments in which people can grow, develop and achieve their aspirations? The answers lie within each of those through whom so much can be achieved. This book is the key to unlocking them."
--Gareth Ford, Training & Development Manager, Atkins
