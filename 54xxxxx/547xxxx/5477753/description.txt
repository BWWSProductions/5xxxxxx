From Wiki:


Everclear is a rock band formed in Portland, Oregon in 1992 most well known for their radio hits spanning more than a decade. For most of its existence, Everclear has consisted of Art Alexakis (lead guitar, lead vocals), Craig Montoya (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Greg Eklund (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Eklund replaced original drummer Scott Cuthbert in 1994. Montoya and Eklund departed the band in 2003, but Alexakis continued the band with Dave "Davey" French (rhythm guitar), Josh Crawley (keyboards), Sam Hudson (bass guitar), and Tommy Stewart (drums, percussion). However all members except for Alexakis left the band in July 2009 to be replaced with a 3rd lineup of Everclear.








Sparkle and Fade 1995


Sparkle and Fade is the second album by Everclear, released on May 23, 1995. It was their first album to be released exclusively on Capitol Records; their previous effort, World of Noise, was re-released on Capitol after its introduction through the Portland, Oregon based label, Tim/Kerr Records.

The album's lead single, "Heroin Girl," performed well on college radio but did not gain significant mainstream airplay. That would be granted to their follow up, "Santa Monica," which effectively put Everclear on the map. The next two singles, "Heartspark Dollarsign" and "You Make Me Feel Like A Whore," would have moderate rotation, but the band wouldn't gain major success again until their next album, So Much for the Afterglow.

The cover art to Sparkle and Fade features childhood pictures of the three members of the band, with bassist Craig Montoya on the left, guitarist/singer Art Alexakis in the middle, and drummer Greg Eklund on the right.

The album is Everclear's third best selling album to date with 1 million copies sold. It was dedicated to slain singer Mia Zapata of the Seattle punk rock band The Gits.

So Much for the Afterglow 1997


So Much for the Afterglow is the third album by Everclear, released on October 7, 1997 (see 1997 in music). It contained the singles "Everything to Everyone", "I Will Buy You a New Life", "Father of Mine" and "One Hit Wonder". This album straysnoticeably from the band's past work, which is much less clean and polished. This main tracklist begins on track 7, following 6 tracks of silence while those past attempts were clear examples of grunge, listeners have been more inclined to categorize So Much For The Afterglow as power pop. A number of the songs from this album, especially "Everything to Everyone" and "Father of Mine," received heavy rotation on MTV's Total Request Live and launched Everclear into mainstream popularity briefly in the late-90's. So Much for the Afterglow provided Everclear with their only Grammy nomination to date, a Best Rock Instrumental nod in 1998 for "El Distorto de Melodica." 7th track is that the first 6 tracks were 4 seconds of silence each adding up to twenty-four seconds of silence.

"So Much For The Afterglow" remains Everclear's best selling album with 2 million copies sold.

Pop/Punk band Four Year Strong covered So Much For The Afterglow for the band's 90's Cover Album, "...Explains It All"

Songs from an American Movie Vol. 1: Learning How to Smile 2000


Songs from an American Movie, Vol. 1: Learning How to Smile is an album by Everclear, released on July 11, 2000. The album (along with its sequel, Songs from an American Movie, Vol. 2: Good Time for a Bad Attitude) is a loose concept album based around lead singer Art Alexakis' second divorce. The first album is much more influenced by American pop music, especially from the 1970s, as well as being more "loving" in tone than the hard rock Good Time for a Bad Attitude. The album is dedicated to David Ridderhof and Louis Montoya.

The cover art is a parody of the famous painting American Gothic by Grant Wood. It could also allude to the music video for So Much for the Afterglow track, "I Will Buy You A New Life", in which the band can be seen performing in a yard through a spyhole.

"Learning How To Smile" is the band's second highest selling album ever with 1.28 million copies sold. It is also the band's only album to debut in the top ten on the Billboard charts, and the last album by Everclear to sell over 500,000 copies.

Songs from an American Movie Vol. 2: Good Times for a Bad Attitude 2000


Songs from an American Movie, Vol. 2: Good Time for a Bad Attitude is an album by Everclear, released on November 21, 2000. They recorded Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 in the same year and released them only a few months apart. Both albums are loose concept albums based around Art Alexakis' second divorce. The first one is more pop-based and melodic, the second angrier with a more punk/hard rock sound. It also focuses more on the destruction of relationships in its lyrical content. The album comes with a parental advisory sticker, the only other album by the band to feature one is 2006's "Welcome To The Drama Club".

"Good Time For a Bad Attitude" was seen as a disappointment compared to predecessor. The album debuted at a disappointing 66 on the Billboard charts. No singles received any significant air play on radio or MTV and the album quickly fell out of memory. To date the album has only sold about 100,000 copies.

"When It All Goes Wrong Again", "Out of My Depth" and "Rock Star" were the three songs released as singles from this album.

"When It All Goes Wrong Again" was also featured on the soundtrack for the 2001 film Antitrust starring Ryan Phillipe while "Rock Star" was featured for the film of the same name starring Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston.

Slow Motion Daydream 2003


Slow Motion Daydream is an album by Everclear that was released (in the U.S.) by Capitol Records on March 11, 2003 (see 2003 in music). Recorded in 2002. The first single released to radio from Slow Motion Daydream was "Volvo Driving Soccer Mom", followed by second single "The New York Times".

Though the album debuted better than the band's last album at 33 on the Billboard charts, the album quickly fell off the charts due to lack of promotion by Capitol Records and a dwindling fan base. The album has sold only 100,000 copies to date.

This was the last album of new material to feature long time members Craig Montoya and Greg Eklund who left the band later in August of that year.
