,Anakunda,2010-04-03T13:09Z,does the vinyl rip have better sound than 2009 remasters????????
[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-03T17:23Z,"well... i dont have a milti-million dollar studio to transfer the songs, but i still think it sounds just as good. 
i've been doing some side by sides, and i find the 2009 has a little too much bass, these rips sound more ""original"" than the remasters"
,fistorbefisted,2010-04-29T00:42Z,remastered versions are bullshit..  ty for these
,dr4cul,2010-05-12T11:30Z,Many thanks!
[T],insinuendo,2010-10-04T01:02Z,Merci!
,gizmol1212,2010-10-31T10:40Z,remasters in general are victims to the loudness wars that have started in the middle of the 80s I suggest downloading/buying these early recordings since they are of greater value to those with more subtle listening skills... and plz seed
