Wikipedia - Singles is a two CD compilation of New Order's singles from 1981â€“2005, released on October 3, 2005. Unlike the CD version of earlier singles compilation Substance, the B-sides are not included. While Substance aimed to showcase New Order's 12" singles, Singles instead features mostly 7" versions, some of these being quite rare as well as differing from album versions. Of special note are several early singles that have never appeared on CD in their original form: "Ceremony", "Everything's Gone Green", "Temptation", and "Confusion". One song, "Turn" was released on this album in a new form despite it not being a single. 
Amazon.com - The massively influential band New Order formed in Manchester, England, in 1980, rising from the ashes of U.K. post-punk pioneers Joy Division (after singer Ian Curtis took his own life). Guitarist Bernard Sumner assumed vocal duties for the new unit, and with drummer Stephen Morris, bassist Peter Hook, and keyboardist Gillian Gilbert, made music history. Successfully fusing new wave, electronica, synth-pop, and club music earlier than many bands now seen as contemporaries, their unique sound was as insightful and soulful as it was perfectly suited for the dance floor. From their earliest singles to their latest hits, this historic double-disc collection offers a career-spanning portrait of one of the most enduring and distinctive bands in modern rock.
