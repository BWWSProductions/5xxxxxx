Made Me Glad' was written in an old moldy house in Sydney. I found this place because it was low rent and decided to have no tv for a few months which ended up closer to a year. Often over the years all those beautiful psalms would spring up like 'you are my refuge, my fortress, sheild etc. After coming home from work one day, I was walking around the house speaking a few psalms and feeling nothing in particular. When I casually spoke out 'You have made me glad' the presence of God filled my heart as worship began to flow out of my spirit to God. I was overwhelmed as He gave me fresh revelation that day that it doesn't matter where I am, if it's in the slums somewhere or in a plush hotel, Jesus is the one who makes me glad and all my joy is found in Him!
