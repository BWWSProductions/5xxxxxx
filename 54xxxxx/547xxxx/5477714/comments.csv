,XenoSilvano,2010-05-31T00:01Z,I have a question - Is this 'April' edition an 'add-on' to the previous one or do I need to download the previous ones aswell for better coverage?  I'm confused!
,XenoSilvano,2010-05-31T01:48Z,I just read the caption above 'The Speedcam Loader will overwrite your existing files (older Garmin EU Speedcams files) in POI folder to newer version.'
