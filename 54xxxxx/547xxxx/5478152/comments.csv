Thanks for the upload, top quality, much appreciated :)"
,gorejuice,2010-04-05T12:10Z,Pleasure! I've got tons of this vinyl stashed away... takes huge motivation to rig it up and sit through the ripping process! I'm having fun with Mixmeister doing mixes of all this stuff at mo... see some of my other torrents. Enjoy anyway! :0)
