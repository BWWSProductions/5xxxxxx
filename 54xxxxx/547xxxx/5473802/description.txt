Another mix of modern New Zealand music- mostly roots funk soul based.  This CD was made in early December 2009 for a mate K, but has been gifted to a few others before going online in 2010.  Respect to all the artists.

FYI:
While much New Zealand music is well known at home, in the greater world few are familiar with our household names.  This results in relatively little activity on this and other NZ music torrents.
Furthermore- In NZ we have broadband capacity and speed limits, while in most of the rest of the world (particularly Europe and America) there are no bandwidth restrictions.
These two factors make it difficult to seed new NZ music torrents from NZ.  It is particularly frustrating when leechers in restrictionless countries do not seed back what they download because that makes keeping the torrent alive a slow and costly task.
Pleeeeaaase- help support this torrent by seeding it back for as long as possible.
