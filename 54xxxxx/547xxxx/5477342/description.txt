*this is an odd addition to the cd, because on the back of the case it shows a link to avideo which is the band dancing to some pop song and humiliating themselves, but on the actual cd it is a 90 second track with pianos and shit...dunno

All in all, its a great listen. Sleeping with Sirens have done a good job in capturing the vibe with their debut release
If you like it too, dont forget to buy the cd or their merchandise and support them...and PLEASE SEED! :)

!! note: ive noticed that some files have incomplete names , which probably occurred when i converted from aac to mp3, so apoligies for that but im sure it wont be too hard for you to finish off the names ;)!!
