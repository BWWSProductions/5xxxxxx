Got NOD32 Antivirus or Smart Security (v3.0 or v4.0) and no internet connection?

You want to update your NOD32 product but don't have a username & key?

NOD32 Offline Update will find your SystemDrive and create the correct folder, put the latest updated virus defâ€™s and module files in it (delete previous files if present) then change the update server details in the registry; (no manually setting up server) so all you have to do is click â€œupdateâ€ in your NOD32 product.

Portable, so you can run it from your HardDrive, USB stick, DVD, CD, USB Key, SD Card and moreâ€¦

NOD32 Offline Updater 49xx will update the following:

Virus signature database:
Advanced heuristics module:
Anti-Stealth support module:
Archive support module:
Update module:
Cleaner module:
Personal firewall module:
Antispam module:
System status module:

(I haven't tried this myself because I don't have any problem updating my NOD32 but I checked out a bunch of forums and the consensus is that this app does exactly what it says-@artpepper)
