It's said there's no honor amongst thieves.  Add to that a thief operating in the occult underground, and it's a whole different kind of nasty!  Luci Jennifer Inagcio Das Neves, Lucifer for short, takes a new job that will expose her to the macabre underbelly of the city, and a secret that she'd rather nobody know.
