December 23, 2009: Lilyanna  + Pics
  
 
There is a certain look that turns PD on. Call it shock, surprise or terror.  Part of it is the wide eyes, but thatâ€™s not all.  Some of it is the dilated pupils, but thatâ€™s not quite everything either.  A combination of arched eyebrows and a gaping mouth, maybe?  Whatever it is that defines fear best, it is everything he is looking for from a girl.  Lilyannaâ€™s screams match her expression perfectly.  They provide the melody while his whip plays a beat.  Her pleadings are the lyrics and her suffering the song.
