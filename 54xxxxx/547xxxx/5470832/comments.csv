Also can you plz confirm if the saves are working?"
[V],globeplus,2010-03-30T11:37Z,"the repack is not needed , the extra files are very short in size to justify that and the problem is the saves , it looks like they work all right but only at the end of the levels and they are large levels , tough to play , it is a trainer to help available at my blog or gamecopyworld , but you only get infinite health , ammo and power not the saves in the current position , you still have to make the jumps properly for donÂ´t comeback to the start of the level , i normaly donÂ´t advise trainers for any game and normaly , generaly  speaking you donÂ´t need them but under the circunstances of the saves , any help is welcome .
