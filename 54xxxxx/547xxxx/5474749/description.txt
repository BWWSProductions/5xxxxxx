Season 2, Episode 17: Could I Leave You?
Original Air Dateâ€”26 March 2006
Susan comes home from the hospital after her surgery where she invites Dr. Ron to meet Karl after he finds out about their arranged marriage. But the conniving Karl creates friction by having Mike and Dr. Ron meet face to face to provoke a reaction for his own amusement. Lynette is surprised that a new employee at work, named Veronica, is still breastfeeding her child of five. Gabrielle becomes very picky when choosing a surrogate birth mother, and a beautiful baby which leads her and Carl to pick out very pregnant erotic dancer Libby, who apparently rejects them for being middle-class Mexicans. Bree plays her part in Alcoholics Anonymous, but has to deal with a fresh accusation when the twisted Andrew threatens to tell the courts, and anyone that will listen, a concocted story about "repressed childhood abuse" to make his emancipation case stronger, leading to Bree getting drunk and locked up in a department store after hours, leading to her getting rescued by her AA sponsor. History seems to repeat itself when Caleb Applewhite develops a crush on Matthew's new girlfriend Danielle, and breaks into her house to try to win her affections.

Bree overcomes her alcohol addiction by falling in love with her AA-sponsor Peter, only to find 

he's also a recovering sex-addict, so he passes her on to a woman. Meanwhile, Lynette is torn between testifying at Andrew's emancipation trial in his favor, as he claims to be systematically abused by Bree, or in hers. So, she tests his eagerness to become able (trough his trust-fund) to afford an expensive car. If only he had learned from Bree appearances must be kept up always and everywhere! When Edie finds out from Dr. Ron McCreadie about Susan and Karl's re-marriage behind her back, Edie demands Karl to pay her a wedding that he cannot afford and forces Susan to organize it all. When Gabrielle and Carlos learn that Libby, the girl who promised them her unborn baby, is engaged to the bouncer in the strip-club where she waitresses, they try to pay her off as well as get Libby's boyfriend, Frank, to waive paternity rights prior to birth, but the sale still has a hidden defect...

Original Air Dateâ€”16 April 2006
Lynette is called in to her kids' school as Parker has gone from being obsessed with Dinosaurs to being obsessed with female nudity. Carlos and Gabrielle must go to court to get custody of their baby, Lily, after they "steal" her from the hospital nursery ward. But they find their court victory for temporary custody bittersweet when Gabrielle resents the baby's crying and enlists their Chinese housekeeper Xiao-Mei's help. Bree's overbearing father Henry and stepmother Eleanor come to town to mediate between Andrew and her after postponing the court 
trial for Andrew's emancipation. When Henry and Eleanor decide to take Andrew back to live with them in Rhode Island, Bree and a surprising objective ally craftily make sure they find out about his homosexuality. Convinced that Karl doesn't really love Edie, Susan goes to a movie theatre alone and spots Mike with a date. This turn of events leads to Susan making a new friend when she has a run-in with dentist Orson Hodge, whom she confides in her troubles. Felicia heats up her war-of-harassment against Paul, trying to provoke a public reaction from him to make herself look like the victim, and him as the aggressor.

Original Air Dateâ€”30 April 2006
Gabrielle and Carlos are surprised when their temporarily custody-awarded adoptive baby Lily's biological teenage father, quarterback Dale Helms, turns up and wants to lay claims to his infant daughter, inspired by his elder brother Frank Helm, the mother's cuckolded fiancÃ©. The Solis want Dale to sign away his rights, but the dumb jock doesn't seem to see it their way, until a little intimidation from Gabrielle in his high-school makes him do just that. But on the other front, Edie is heartbroken after Karl breaks off their engagement, and has him followed by P.I. Oliver Weston. Susan becomes very worried that Edie might find out about hers 
and Karl's fling. This leads to Edie going out drinking with Susan where she gets so drunk that she attacks a waitress. When Lynette's boss, Ed, has her work late to forget his marital problems, intimate e-mails get crosses; she tries to coach his on-line love-life back to health, but it backfires badly with Tom getting blamed for their lies. Bree puts her mind to keeping Peter McMillan in her life by having his overprotective sex-addict sponsor removed and continues pursuing him, but soon learns just how bad his other addiction is. Caleb is caught at another horny intrusion when he makes a play for Danielle
