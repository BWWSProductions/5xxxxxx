,ClipperCigars,2011-12-13T02:10Z,"Thank you. I lost disc 4 a while ago, and thought I'd never have it again. 

But, while I do appreciate that someone decided to share this, I would like to offer some constructive criticism.

As you mentioned, it was released on 4 CD's, and it may have been better had this torrent remained in that layout. In all honesty, your way does make more logical sense. But ALL discographies, references, music databases and what have you will list it as 4 CD's.

The casual listener may not care, but to anyone trying to have a proper collection, it creates extra work having to move around and rename half the files so that it's correct and conforms to the original official specifications. 

For me, it's not a big a deal, since I'm only dealing with one missing disc. To someone else looking for all 4 discs, I could see it being a little frustrating. 

Just something to think about. Please do not be offended as no offense is meant.  

And thank you again, also, thank you for preserving the quality by using a nice high bit-rate. :) Which more people would do that."
