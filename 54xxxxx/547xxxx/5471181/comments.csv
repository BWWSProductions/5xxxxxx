,ZombiePanda,2010-05-15T10:15Z,"Really good quality, thank you...I could really use some subs for the Vietnamese speaking though. But oh well. :D"
,ZombiePanda,2010-05-15T10:15Z,"My bad...I just found the subs in the folder...I feel like a fucking idiot now. xD
Thank you! You are WONDERFUL. "
,nittany,2010-05-30T09:18Z,"No hard coded subs, there are SRT files but I don't want to deal with having to load a SRT file just for the foreign language parts."
,nittany,2010-05-30T09:28Z,"Nevermind, the part I was watching didn't have subs for that part.  These do in fact have hard coded subs for non english parts, most of them."

,c3bhm,2010-07-10T08:58Z,"Can only comment on \'Rambo\' (the 4th/final movie) - didn\'t d/l the other 3, but:nnI don\'t know what kind of advanced alien technology SecretMyth is using for the encoding, but the visuals are INSANELY good considering file-size.nHow is it possible that a tiny little *1.5 gig* file can look absolutely superior to anything I\'ve ever seen on a 4-8gig DVD?!?nSeriously - how in the hell is that possible???nnIt\'s some form of witchcraft.  I bet SecretMyth doesn\'t float...n"

,Saki33,2011-03-13T15:07Z,"Thanks for the download.

Btw, and I hate to complain, but the Eng subtitles in the package suck. Out of synch and not even close to word for word. More like a translation back into Eng from a foreign language. I got better subs from Subscene, and they are the ones for exactly this release.

,Saki33,2011-03-13T15:08Z,I should have said that I meant the Eng subs for First Blood were awful. I haven't downloaded the other titles.
