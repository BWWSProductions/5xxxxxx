"BRAZIL" 

When an environmental scientist, Dr. Oscar Silva (guest star 
Elliot Villar), is poisoned during a global warming 
symposium, Detectives Cyrus Lupo (Jeremy Sisto) and Kevin 
Bernard (Anthony Anderson) initially suspect competitors 
from Dr. Silva's field of study. It is soon discovered that 
Dr. Silva is involved in a messy custody battle with his 
wife's (guest star Tammy Blanchard) ex-husband, Phillip 
Shoemaker (guest star Tony Hale) and the focus of the 
investigation quickly shifts to the victim's family. 
Meanwhile, the case becomes personal for Cutter (Linus 
Roache) as it stirs up unpleasant memories from his own 
past.
