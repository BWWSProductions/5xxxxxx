,kiraveli,2010-03-29T22:24Z,"Video is a little grainy, audio is hollow, but all in all very watchable and not bad for a first cam.
Cute movie, thanks so much!

(I don't get why people are complaining it's a virus/fake - was perfect for me..)"
,jran0880,2010-03-29T23:48Z,Checked other ups and there are quite a bit. Taking a chance.... Will let everyone know my results. 
,jran0880,2010-03-30T00:22Z,"Just watched sample after scanning with McAfee version 13.15.116 that was updated 2day. No viruses. A=5 (echoed and dubbing off) V=5. What I would expect for a cam. Very watchable. After this one is done, I'm DLing Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus from same uploader. Many thanx GPB2008!!! Hope your skull shows soon!!!"
,mestuart77,2010-03-30T15:54Z,"definitely not fake. not the best cam I've seen but far from the worst. When the shots are dark, the video gets a little muddy but the rest of it's OK. sound is pretty good throughout considering there's alot of ""explosions"" and ""fireballs"". I'd say- for me- A8V6 but it's worth a download if you just want to see the movie. I'm living overseas so I can't see it in the theatres (it's dubbed into Korean) so I definitely appreciate the U/L... I was entertained! cheers."
,Mithumann,2010-03-30T21:22Z,"Fastest torrent I ever experienced.
Quality on screenshots given by GBP2008 verified.

Here is a screen of the torrent speed.
I got 4 MB DSL.

every chorse box in width is 5 minutes (grid).
took 2 minutes 30 secs for achieving max speed. it continiously was maxed."
,texasknight,2010-03-31T07:59Z,thxs for the up load i think this is the best one yet will seed as long as needed
,GPB2008,2010-03-31T08:28Z,"You are all very welcome. but IMAGiNE released Their TS, Best Copy Thus Far Until An R5 or Scr!

,doc.sm,2010-03-31T12:31Z,"@09gugan: Thanks for the warning m8! This must be the new .avi file virus everybody is talking about. You know like super-AIDS, just for the computer. Scary stuff!"
,dlarrym,2010-04-20T22:34Z,"does anyone upload DVD rips or Screener copies.... or is every uploader trying to make TS copies watchable.... Even when a TS copy has been improved, it NEVER is as good as a RIP or even a screeners copy... I just noticed that it seems like with this film and especially movies like ""The Book Of Eli"". There is still NOTHING available but TS (witch are glorified CAM copies but still are  inferior and never even get close to a rip) Just commenting in general. It looks as if everyone is satisfied with these tweaked up TS copies and if no one complains about them, it will become the Status Quo. TS copies become the norm is a BAD BAD thing... Just thought I'd toss this question out to whom ever..... L8R"
