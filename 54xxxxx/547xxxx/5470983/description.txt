Synopsis:
Robert, a depressed and broke middle-aged New Yorker, is being evicted from his apartment. He hires Branko, a young Serbian immigrant who does moving jobs with his van, to help him move out. Branko desperately wants his girlfriend Ivana in Serbia to join him in USA, but it is impossible for her to obtain a visa. Branko offers Robert a deal: he will pay him to go to Serbia and marry Ivana there so she can be granted a FiancÃ© Visa. Robert, desperate for cash, agrees. While waiting in Serbia for Branko to send him the cash, Robert stays in the apartment of Olga, Brankos mother. Olga is kept in the dark about the marriage plan. Robert is introduced to her as simply a good friend of Branko's from New York. Feeling like a fish out of water, Robert is distant and cynical, even though Olga tries to take good care of Brankos friend in the best tradition of Balkan hospitality.
