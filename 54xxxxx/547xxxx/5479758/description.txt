Jamie has made a new series for the ABC American TV network about food â€“ how families eat, what kids get at school and why, like the UK, the diet of processed food and snacks is causing so many health and obesity problems. The series is set in Huntington, West Virginia.

Jamie's challenge is to see if he can get a whole community cooking again. He works with the school lunch ladies and local families to get everyone back in the kitchen and making tasty meals with fresh ingredients â€“ no packets, no cheating. He's started a Food Revolution: to get people all over America to reconnect with their food and change the way they eat.
