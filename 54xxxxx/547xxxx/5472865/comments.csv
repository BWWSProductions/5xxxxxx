,hsn_kmr,2010-03-31T06:45Z,"Dear RiddlerA ,

I am very dissapointed with your's LOTR release .
The quality in not bluray and it is not up to the mark.
It is DVD quality .
Also the bit rate is also very low as compared to your other rips .

Overall i will rate the quality of LOTR trilogy as :-

A - 8/10
V - 5/10

I just hope that PIRATES OF CARIBBEAN trilogy will be of sure bluray quality with high resolution and high bitrate.

Your's Truly

[V],RiddlerA,2010-03-31T08:57Z,"Thanxs for FeedBack Lover & Kmr

Well, Kmr it was not a BRRip 
Also the bitrate for this movie was infact higher than my other Uploads --- 600 as compared to 450-500 kbps. Hence its size was greater than my usual uploads
You have to understand that bitrate & Size doesn't go hand in Hand. If Bitrate is high than size will also increase

Ty for Listening"
,hsn_kmr,2010-03-31T09:58Z,"Thanks for your reply RiddlerA I realy appreciae it.

So can You upload PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN in true bluray quality with high resolution and bitrate between 1 to 1.5 GB.

Thanks
HSN_KMR"

[T],fachman,2010-04-14T04:08Z,"Dear Fellow encoder:
I usually do not talk about others work, but i have downloaded the sample and thanx to you I have understood why low bitrate HD rips have so bad reputation.
I am sorry to inform you that the quality of your rips is not even good, and can be considered only as acceptable. I believe that saying that your rips quality is excellent is the result that you have not seen so many others rips and its is hard for you to have proper judgment.

It is not something wrong to use low bitrate and I absolutely do not want to discourage you, but give you the motivation to improve the quality of your rips.

Good quality small rips are possible, but you will not achieve it by simply setting the low bitrate and pretend to have ""Excellent"" quality. 

At the end I just show you what i would label Small Size Excellent Quality Rip:

You need to learn a lot about lossy compression and I encourage you to do it... Greetings friend"
[V],RiddlerA,2010-04-14T17:43Z,"@ fachman

First of all, Thanxs for ur feedback
I have attached the sample for this reason only
Its simple - You like the sample, Download the movie
If u Don't, Don't
As to Low bitrate, its in lieu of Small size
Also, I again Reteriate that for the given Size, Quality is Excellent
If u can Rip it better in smaller size - u r Welcome do so. It would Benefit everybody - Remember Sharing is Caring

TY for Listening"
[T],fachman,2010-04-15T02:15Z,"Well, I would never use the word Excellent in the case of Quality, no matter than its low size. 
As for your advice, I know that I am unable to put HD quality into this bitrate so I am not doing it, even if my rip would be much nicer.
 I am concentrated on other things, but you seem to have audience for what you are doing so keep doing what you are doing, but you should be aware that you are just at the beginning of your road and could enhance the quality of your rips by reading forum on doom9.org
greetings"

,attackfighter,2010-06-09T01:09Z,"BIG PROBLEM WITH THIS TORRENT

around the fall of osgiliath (little before 1:10 I think) the subtitles start appearing way before their corresponding speach. This is very distracting because there's hard-to-ignore text during action scenes, and during dialogue scenes I'm hearing one thing and reading another 

otherwise this is a good torrent, I also liked your Two Towers upload (I downloaded Fellowship of the Ring from someone else though). I'll definately check your profile if there're any other movies I want to see :)"
,pbfriend,2010-06-18T17:54Z,i'm also havng the same sync. problem between subtitle and scenes. in my case the prob starts almost from the begining. i have k-lite codec pack instld. what should i do? suggest plz. otherwise it's a very good copy.
[V],RiddlerA,2010-06-24T18:40Z,"@ above

Play on GOM player
You can manually Sync using > & < buttons

> if subtitles are coming late
< if Subs are coming quickly(which seems to be a problem here)"
