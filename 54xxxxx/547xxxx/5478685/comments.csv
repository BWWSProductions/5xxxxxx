It was all explained in so few words it breaks my heart to touch another key.  But i literally have nothing better to do with my time than check on torrents i actually care about."
,darwinsmunky,2010-05-01T08:51Z,"Frankly as popular as this band was in the UK, and internationally, there must be some other torrent out there giving you all their albums....I havent seen one giving quality audio, but maybe theres one out there somewhere.  Maybe theres someone offering flac files to do what ive done WITH THE ACTUAL CD'S!!!!  Whos know..."
