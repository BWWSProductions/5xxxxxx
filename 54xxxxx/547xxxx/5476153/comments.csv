,kxt2009,2010-04-03T15:55Z,this program don't work.
,kxt2009,2010-04-03T16:06Z,P.S: it works only if u choose custom install and clik next. Otherwise it will be a fake instal everytime u try to instal.
,DarkerSkies,2010-04-04T04:34Z,"Word of warning!!  un-installing this in windows 7 may well cause your system to fail to boot. Ive check this and it`s happened constantly (several times) it even occurs when using their own removal tool.
Also had issues with ""One Click"" failing to run hence the unistall which lead to the initial problem being found. Just a heads up for you guys,  beware of any attempt to remove this on 7. It`s a nice bit of kit when it actually works.     "
,dsrs,2010-04-05T11:07Z,"it is really annoying when someone installs acronis and says 'IT WORKS'

what do you want this to do?
WAIT for the trial to expire and you will find

1. you cannot restore the backups you made while it was 'working'

2. as noted, trying to remove it can crash windows 7. it happened to me

3. all keys will be blacklisted within a short period of time

there has never been a scene release of acronis since version 11, just jerkoffs with torrents
there has never been a comment on pirate bay of someone who has tried this version for 30 days and THEN says 'it works'

for losers by losers
some people never learn"
,shilohpyte,2010-04-18T15:06Z,"Can't comment on the longevity of the licence etc, as have only been using it for a week, but it's really slow to backup!

I was using NTI Shadow which I binned as it kept restarting a full backup each time it finished its nightly task. However, this would backup about 100Gb from my Buffalo NAS to a Netgear ReadyNAS in about 3-4 hours on a Vista Ultimate x64 system running 12Gb RAM and an overclocked i720 processor.

Sadly, this version of Acronis takes about 11 hours to do the same task.

Although it does, as one TV paint advertisement says, ""What it says on the tin"", it does take rather longer to do it than the paint takes to dry...

Thanks for the upload, I just regret that this app doesn't suit my situation.

Am now looking for something else."
,shilohpyte,2010-04-18T15:09Z,"Sorry for typo in above: what reads 'and an overclocked i720 processor', should read 'an overclocked i7 920 processor'."
,pxpx,2010-05-09T06:22Z,@shilohpyte: using Windows Backup on Win 7 64-bit Ultimate on a laptop 6GB i7-720QM NOT overclocked & doing a full backup system image 116GB to my WD 1TB via eSATA: it took only 1h25 min.
,dsrs,2010-05-15T12:56Z,"@dog-43
that is very useful and looks like you did a good job testing. i don't know how acronis wrecks this software. of course you can block various acronis names in hosts file or firewall. but how do you know they are not using an address that has no relation to the name 'acronis'?
i see several people have had problems with this on windows7. as noted, i had to reinstall windows to go back to the old working version 11. please let us know if you are still having success."
,dsrs,2010-05-15T13:02Z,"@dog-43
it appears that you used the boot cd to access acronis, and made backups and restorations using the linux cd?
my problems came from backing up and trying to restore images made under windows 7 while running acronis
i wonder if this makes a difference?
the one feature which makes me want to use this build is the ability to NOT have backups overwrite previous tib files. the only way to do that in v11 is to use confusing batch file"
,hornynieco,2010-05-23T23:37Z,"i cant get hte plus pack install to work, im using this produck key for it but it wone accept it. 
its the same as the 1 in the proper installation.

where am i goin wrong"
,nittany,2010-06-03T04:24Z,"I installed this on windows 7 Ultimate X64, works fine.  Created an image, verified it.  No problems or errors.

The only thing that remains to be see is if it can restore the image I made, but I don't want to test that out only to fuck up my new build."
[T],TrettioSju,2010-06-07T19:49Z,"Direcly after I install this crap and reset computer as forced to, my other computer does NOT find this computer anylonger over LAN network.

I am not able ro repair it either, so have o GHOST-back my C:-partion again. "
