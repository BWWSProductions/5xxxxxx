Review: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/vampire-hunter-d-bloodlust 

I wasn't happy with how the 700mb copy looked on my PS3 + 32" LCD so I encoded it myself. File is english only and has no subs, just like my Urban Vision DVD. Oddly(for an anime) the english language track was the master and it was dubbed in japanese. It shows.
