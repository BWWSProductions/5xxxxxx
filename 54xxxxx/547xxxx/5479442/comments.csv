,rstanley,2010-04-04T00:37Z,Ok this doesn't even fix the save bug. WTH? I still can't save my games
[V],Mbb15,2010-04-04T00:54Z,"Thats really weird, mayby you need admin rights to run the game, thats what I saw somewhere, so try to open just cause as admin"
,mrpras,2010-04-05T18:59Z,"The Skidrow crack didn't work for me, but pleased to report that this works fine on Win7x64

Saves games etc.. No problems yet and several hours into game..
Woohoo"
,PCgamerDude,2010-04-06T12:19Z,"Ive tried every crack on TPB, but I still cant launch the game. Someone told me I had to launch the game by using ""JustCause2_launcher.exe"", but I dont have that file. The only .exe files I have are ""JustCause2.exe"", and ""JustCause2_game.exe"""
,gunit007,2010-04-19T01:48Z,NEED NO SAVE FIX!
,FutureVisions,2010-04-22T23:35Z,"Am I the only one not able to press the ""enter"" key to sart race missions?

This has to be the game with most different issues I've seen in a veeery long time."
,Psythik,2010-05-09T04:29Z,"Hopefully this will fix the ""Save Failed"" issue.  I tried running as Admin but the game just hangs in the task manager if I do."
,Psythik,2010-05-09T09:23Z,"Fixed the save issue, yay"
,bLoWsMokE,2010-05-10T23:39Z,"I don't know man there are a lotof missing things they must be looking over because if you play long enough you will notice that the upgrade box indicater arrow will double and be stuck on the bottom of your screen until a cut scene sheldon will talk when you call the black market dealer BEFORE you find out that he is the sloth demon.... the roaches will not drive away if you jump on the room of their trucks in front of one of their main bases..... it SCREAMS virus.... I'm just trying to find a copy that this doesn't happen with and so far both reloaded and skidrows does the same..... only skidrow doesn't use a retarded installer and when you WANT to UNINSTALL the game you can do so through the normal means however with RELOADED the installation is VERY questionable and then when you finally see JUST CAUSR in you program files all of a sudden and surprisingly.... you play the game and realize that when you look in the control panel and try to uininstall just cause 2 it's not there......

Well I just hope you guys stop fighting nd start helpinbg each other out making these fuckin cracks ACTUALLY WORK WELL!!! I mean both their torrents do it the same way...... they make fakle steam executable show up in the program files proly to emulate steam on your computer without having it somehow.... I am just guessing that's the reason because that MIGHT bexplain WHY the crack shows up as a trojan...................."
,slip_out_kayz,2010-07-16T20:11Z,"To those of you guys cant save the game or somehow cant get the option to worknand says \"" Save Failed \""nnDownload The New Crack by Reloadednhttp://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5479442/Just.Cause.2.Crackfix.Proper.on.Proper-RELOADEDnnAnd run the game AS AN ADMIN using the Option \"" RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR\""\""nnthats all nnhave fun"
,koroll,2010-08-22T13:51Z,"Run as an ADMIN, it works for vista users"
,yelloo,2010-09-19T03:41Z,Thanks Mbb15.
,Juoka,2011-01-10T22:45Z,"""Not enough storage is available to complete this operation.""

Hrmph! I am trying to find a crack that really works. THAT is what we need! Not two cracker groups pushing out dysfunctional garbage and fighting."
