,jjacobs,2010-04-01T09:29Z,@20-40 WHAT HAPPENED TO  AMERICAN IDOL? THANKS FOR ALL THE GREAT UPS.
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-01T09:52Z,"Nothing. I did Main event (last week's) because it was /00MB as XviD.
I have said that I wont encode Results show. Results are available on-line as part of the News almost everywhere.
Sadly, I was unable to encode AI yesterday and today's Results, as I said, I wont. (spoiler alert: Didi was voted out). Besides, I found (personally) this year as very bad one (except Crystal) and especially yesterday's Main show was without any uplifting moments or performances. So... I feel no guilt about. If next week's show raises up AND if my situation allows, I'll encode the Main show only."
