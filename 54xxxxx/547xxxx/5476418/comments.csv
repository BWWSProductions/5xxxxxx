The voices of the people on the street was what made the game feel alive!!!"

[V],Mbb15,2010-04-02T01:12Z,no 11 days!!! :)
[V],globeplus,2010-04-02T02:21Z,"thank you for your comments and i understand the anxiety for more nice gta games , the true is that all the predcessors of this huge game with more than 14 gb in the original iso , made from this game the absolute toughest gta to work properly to get a really decent rip , i respected completely the gameplay of the game and only cutted things that can be nice but not really important for shore , guaranteeing the gameplay in total normality to the player and i included as a bonus a private launcher with easy acess to many nice stuff already created to this game like a trainer , walthrough or lot of mods , i think it will be a total pleasure for who didn´t played this game yet having easy acess to all the nice stuff already created specificaly for this game and having all the important gameplay to play , like i said in the nameof this file : this is a perfect rip . thank you ."
,RICO1401,2010-04-02T03:18Z,i have downloaded globe's game previously ... he is quite good with his rip BUT SOME TIMES HE MAKES SHIT BY REMOVING SOME BASIC FEATURE OF THE GAME like here 1> no secondary voices or the voices of the people on the street and 2> cut seances voices.
,AZkiller7,2010-04-02T04:17Z,"at least he mentioned what has been removed, if you don't like it, stay away from it"
[T],Knaster,2010-04-02T05:35Z,"Well said AZkiller7 i wish more people would take that to heart but nooooo they have make useless comments that they hate the torrent contents etc......

oops sorry here i go ranting on :)"
,palyakabal666,2010-04-02T08:45Z,"blobeminus, u r definitely abortion victim with half brain ripped off. kill urself with keyboard."
[V],globeplus,2010-04-02T13:10Z,"thank you for your comments and i respect the opinions , but now think with me : this game already have the complete game in original pc dvd iso with more than 14 gb , it was very complicate for different until we have a first decent rip , now analising the nice things that are normaly addicionated to the gta and are superfluos in the context of the real gameplay , extracting them with can get the best possible size for a file for this game , THIS IS A RIP , and that means the user will be direccionated to the important features of the gameplay and the things that are nice but not really needed to the gameplay cutted , irepeat : THIS IS A PERFECT RIP . thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-04-02T13:15Z,"it is posible to addicionate in the appropriate folder , radios for example , if you get them somewhere , inside the game look for the stations that you have available if you download them but you don´t spent too much time inside the vehicles , depending on the mission , a few minutes maybe , and many times is less than a minute using the vehicle , so , not a indispensable thing too . thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2010-04-02T13:21Z,To finish the observations maded in the last comments i have to say that the user of this file basically got the gameplay of the game with a nice bonus added with a nice interface . thank you .

,asia_rules,2010-04-03T10:59Z,"i remember a russian uploader who uploaded f.e.a.r  2 setup, it wasnt a ripped version but that was highly compressed file and it was only 6gb, globe could have done something like that, taking off radios, cutscenes and voices kills the game, no point. effort is appreciated but it's worth not downloading it."
,razzie_3,2010-04-04T06:58Z,how can i extract ARC files?
,budtokens89,2010-04-05T02:28Z,"great rip, appreciate the extras, one note: it seems setting wanted level in trainer causes a crash. everything else working fine. thanks"
,feliks000,2010-04-11T18:50Z,Hello globeplus! Thanks for uploading the torrent.. i downloaded it with dl speed 100 - 300 kb/ps .. but.. when i started extracting it showed speed 60 kbps and 29 hours.. i waited for almost a hour.. and it shows 800 hours and 3 kb/s  .. compuressed and total compressed things are the same value on both sides and the bar below shows 0.1 % .. is it supposed to .... do stuff that long? and ratio is 55889 % .. (i do it with freearc)

,directrip,2011-07-24T04:17Z,Hey how to install new patches to it tell me faster
,FragPL,2011-07-31T09:07Z,"In order to update this version you need to create a new text file, pate this:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV]
""InstallFolder""=""C:\\INSTALL DIR HERE!!!\\Grand Theft Auto IV""
""InstallComplete""=""1""
""INSTALL_LANG""=""1033""

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV\1.00.0000]

be sure to specify a correct path to the game!

then ""save as"" gta4.reg.
Then close notepad and double click the file you created. This will make a registry key making it look like you installed the game.

Next, download the Social club standalone and install it.

Now you should be able to patch!"

,ishanya,2011-08-02T12:10Z,"who had  ""Seculauncher: failed to start application. [2000]""
try this
Step 1: Install GTAIV and get the error stated above.

Step 2: Navigate to Control panel > Add/Remove Programs.

Step 3: Locate Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable, more importantly, one's that say something with x64 on end. Apparently this game runs on 32-bit? Im not completely sure, but 32-bit installer comes in the downloaded package once GTAIV is installed.

Step 4: Uninstall any Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable items listed in Add/Remove programs.

Step 5: Navigate to the GTAIV main folder, and locate the installers folder. (In my case its Program files > Steam > Steamapps >Common > Grand theft auto iv > installers. People using a disk it would be to right click on your DVD/CD drive in My computer, click explore, and find the folder named ""Redistributable""

Step 6: Find ""vcredist_x86.exe""

Step 7: Run this installer, complete the installation.

Step 8: Check Add/Remove programs to see that the new 2005 C++ was installed.

Step 9: Attempt to load GTAIV once more, through Social club Play button. This is as far as I got before I got a new error, the above got rid of my seculaunch error though.

Step 10: If you're receiving a new error titled ""GTAIV FATAL ERROR: RMN40"", continue these steps, if not, play the game (Hopefully this worked for you, I could NOT find a solution until I tryed this reccomended by ""theunknownsd"" on gtaforums.com. He was the one who I found the above solution from, but I figured I would re-do these steps and post them as many places as I could to help other people in the same place I was.

Step 11: If you did get the ""GTAIV FATAL ERROR: RMN40"" after doing the above, right click on LaunchGTAIV.exe in the main GTAIV folder, and GTAIV.exe in the main GTAIV folder, and make sure that under the Compatibility tab that ""run this program in compatibility mode for:"" is not checked on all of the launchers. At this point, I got a NEW error once I solved that one, so if you had the RMN40 error, and unchecking compatibility mode fixed it, you may have now received the error ""GTAIV FATAL ERROR: WS10"", if so continue reading.

Step 12: If you got the ""GTAIV FATAL ERROR: WS10"", check Add/Remove programs to make sure you have ""Microsoft Games for Windows Live Redistributable installed, if you do and you still get the error, uninstall the program at this time.

Step 13: Navigate to Program files > Steam > Steamapps >Common > Grand theft auto iv > installers >xliveredist.msi (Or the redistributable folder when exploring the CD for people using a CD.

Step 14: WS10 error supposibly has to do with windows live, so you want to uninstall and reinstall if you already had it, or install it from the folders in step 13 if you didnt have it at all. After uninstalling run xliveredist.msi (Or if your just now installing) and complete the setup.

Step 15: If you still get the WS10 error, download the following GTAIV Patch (Normally downloaded through social club, but at the time it wouldnt let me login to social club, this way is probably faster anyway) http://files.filefront.com/GTAIV+PC+.../fileinfo.html

Step 16: Unzip the GTAIV_PC_Patch folder, and run the Setup.exe

Step 17: Hopefully now, when you launch GTA through social club, it will load up with no errors. In my case, all of the above got me up and going, there needs to be a hardfix patch for all this BS but I took the time to write this up since I was so mad over it. 

Hope this helps some people."

Comments about the rip :Its terrible, why was the game set to run in windowed mode,  I had a hard time searching google. Is this the latest  version because I'm unable to install patches/fixes/updates and the ripper has failed to provide them.This rip maybe small but definitely not worth it."
