extv, correct your flaw numeration!!!"
,vivendix,2010-04-03T11:41Z,"the first new episode was named:

Flashforward S01E11-E12 HDTV XviD-2HD [eztv]

and it was double-episode;

and then you start counting from 12 instead 13 !

CORRECT THIS SH$T"
,paizit0,2010-04-03T15:25Z,"This has been incorrectly named since the first double ep everywhere, I just add 1 to the ep number to know which one it is :p"
