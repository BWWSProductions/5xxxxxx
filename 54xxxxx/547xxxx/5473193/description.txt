Final Notes about the project:

With this upload in the last week of March 2010 we celebrate the first anniversary of the project. In one year a total of 1227 titles were uploaded distributed over about 80 uploads.

The main objective of the project was to collect evidences against Christianity and put them on the internet. During the course of the project  some comparisons between Christianity and Islam were found to be useful. Hence the uploads included 45 titles about Islam. Furthermore, there were a limited number of repetitions to some titles that were found to fit into different groups. 

Thus, we can put the number of unique titles that discuss evidences against Christianity that were collected and uploaded at about 1150 titles. All of these titles were written by Western writers. Every effort was made to exclude the books about Christianity that were written by Muslim or Arab writers.
