Quote by Friedrich Nietzsche: 'God is dead'
Well, now Nietzsche has been dead for 110 years and so are these books authors. Kind of ironic."
,billiewinkle,2010-04-01T05:25Z," your mother is the offspring of a monkey and a pig, 
your Prophet was a sodomite and a liar.
 Your sisters are whores and their fathers are their pimps. 
You are a fool if you think any of your children are yours. 
Your only aunts are the products of sex-change operations 
and your uncles perform fellatio on barnyard animals"

Did you know Mohammad was a Christian and a christian preacher until his epilepsy began and he went nuts? Of course the syphilis might have had something to do with it also."
