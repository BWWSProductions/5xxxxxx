,SuperGanjaman,2010-04-01T11:10Z,"@Spamcrap. You really don't no what you are on about do you?. How many people upload 
anonymously?. Do you think it' the same person?. Before you go and make coment like that, sit back and think first before you post a comment, and if you are not happy then go to another site or better still go and buy it.
People are going out of their way to upload
torrents and there are twats like you putting them down. Have you ever thought that it might of being their first upload and got abit
messed up, but hey we are not all perfect like you. Maybe you should start to add some torrents and we can see what yours are like. This is for you all the way from GB
ENJOY
