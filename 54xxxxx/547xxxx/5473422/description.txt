"Clark Raving Mad"

Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord) immediately butts heads with the 
Blaze's new faculty advisor, Mr. Cannon (guest star Hal 
Ozban, "Californication"), and is reprimanded in front of 
her peers. After failing to convince Navid (Michael 
Steger) to back her opinion, Naomi decides to tell a tiny 
lie that soon snowballs out of control. Adrianna (Jessica 
Lowndes) is now the lead singer of the Glorious Steinems 
and confides in Silver (Jessica Stroup) and Naomi about 
her newfound feelings for Gia, and the two go out on 
their first official date. Teddy (Trevor Donovan) decides 
to test Silver (Jessica Stroup) by attempting to make her 
jealous. Dixon (Tristan Wilds) and his birthmother Dana 
(guest star April Parker Jones, "Jericho") continue to 
bond. Liam (Matt Lanter) catches his stepfather (guest 
star John Schneider, "Smallville") with another woman and 
confronts him with his fist. Debbie (Lori Loughlin) and 
her instructor, Kai (guest star Greg Vaughan, "General 
Hospital") share tea and conversation after yoga, but Kai 
oversteps his boundaries.

Enjoy :)
