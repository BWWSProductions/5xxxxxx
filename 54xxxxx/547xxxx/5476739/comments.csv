,thesoftparade,2010-04-05T13:37Z,Thank you very much!
,supergex,2010-04-05T15:42Z,"720p is the resolution of the video (1280x720pixels) which is HD Ready resolution
and X264 is the codec used to encode the video from the TV stream.
It's much better quality than ""xvid"" codec or than a 350MB video.
Plus the audio track is AC3 used on DVD (more than twice the quality of mp3)
Hope this could help."
