Picturesque is an application designed to make images look gorgeous for the web. With an animated â€œdrag and dropâ€ style interface, Picturesque can beautify your images with reflections, soft glows, shadows, delicate curves, strokes and fades in less time than it takes to open Photoshop. Picturesque is also able to beautify a whole folder of images in batch with a single click, and includes Automator actions for automation.
