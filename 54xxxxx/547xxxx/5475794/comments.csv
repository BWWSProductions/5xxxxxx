The latest one is the today's freebie from Giveawayoftheday, and it comes with its regular license. The other is the 2.1.8 that's the version you download from the original site with the relative crack. It's a little bit older, but it gives you some extra VIP proxies that can be useful. This one doesn't require a license, and as they are quite small I've uploaded both of them. With this program I'm able again to access TPB without hassles, so I decided to share them too. It's good for privacy, but it's necessary for the ones that can't access to a blocked site, as TPB from my state."
