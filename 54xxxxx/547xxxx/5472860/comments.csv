,Big-fat-cone,2010-04-01T21:21Z,"You guys usually rock, but for a BRRip this is terrible quality it looks like a normal 700mb DVDRip!

And you might wonder why you have such low seeds?

Thats because of the fucking WinRAR files! People have to keep two copies which is almost 4.5 GiB. 

Thanks but no thanks. BAD TORRENT."
