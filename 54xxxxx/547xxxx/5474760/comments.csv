,waif68,2011-06-03T19:52Z,It's SAD that many of the old time videos on Vol. 4-5 have a voice over by some jerk which ruins the whole thing.

,ramBEBE,2011-09-03T23:36Z,So big size ; /
,ghandi253,2011-10-01T05:27Z,@ ramBEBE---->Duh its a fucking big size. Its several DVD's from almost 7 or 8 decades of animation history. Fucking dumbass. If you dont like big file sizes then get a faster fucking connection dipshit.
,dielaughing,2011-10-22T12:10Z,"get  some fkn terrabyes then, I have 21TB myself. Great Up.. I was wanting an all encompassing, definitive collection of all that ever was Looney... so, hope this is it.. a voice over? What, why? can't the originals be in there without someone talking about the show in which you are trying to watch? And how about all the old ones with racist undertones and making fun of the Nazi regime? There must be a better collection of EVERYTHING Looney, not just the politically correct stuff they want to be remembered for."
,funseeker521,2012-04-20T19:34Z,The comments reflect a scary amount of mental illness amongst you geeks. @ghandi253 seriously dude? do you know who ghandi was ignoramus? how about Hitler253 or jeffdahmer253? get a life you festering pustule. @dielaughing I think most of us wish you would. Do you need all that storage to make the 3 inch pencil in your pants seem bigger? Thanks for this DL I love LooneyTunes.
