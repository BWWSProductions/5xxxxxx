,rrmerlin51D,2010-03-31T19:32Z,Thanks for the great uploads.  You guys are the gold standard.  Could you please upload the smaller versions for those of us that prefer them to the gig+ versions?  My bytes are carried by a stream of ants along with a bit of sugar they found.  I only recently found out about Pres. Nixon's resignation.  And how about that Hindenburg explosion.  Many thanks.
,MrBendez,2010-03-31T23:14Z,Thanks for the upload. I don't know what EZTV is up to but from a group previously known to always deliver they've failed quite a few times recently...
,MrBendez,2010-03-31T23:55Z,"I'd like to correct my previous statement, DO NOT, for fucks sake, stop seeding until at least two other people have downloaded the full torrent. Now everybody is stuck at 63% or something..."
,Rugburn54,2010-04-01T01:19Z,"Many thanks for past efforts in delivering many, many great torrents.  It comes as quite a surprise that after loading this torrent before heading off for work I come home to find it stuck at 71% and 0 seeders.  Hope things improve in the future.  Again, thanks for your many past efforts."

,Jogyn,2010-04-01T02:41Z,"Christ, EVERYONE is stuck at 78%, what a terrible uploader."
