,Nigu22,2010-03-30T21:06Z, can i play it online? or dedicated servers 
[T],Knaster,2010-03-30T21:14Z,"If you want to play online why dont you simply buy the game? I can understand ppl downloading for a sneakpeek but imo playing online it's ""better"" to just buy the game. Thats my two cents atleast!!!"
,ironman1711,2010-03-30T21:15Z,Thanks to the uploader and to skidrow this game will be fucking awsome

,dracownsu,2010-03-31T06:17Z,"Please, I know this sounds stupid here, But if you like this game PLEASE buy it.

It is a great game done by a VERY small company. They REALLY need all the help they can get. This is a truly unique and innovative new type of game that deserves to be supported. So PLEASE if you do like it help these guys out and buy a copy. 

This is one company that truly believes in making good games that are for gamers, not console retards. Help them out or before you know it we wont have good devs like these anymore!"
,fxjlk,2010-03-31T08:00Z,I totally agree to the above comment

,mrclive11,2010-03-31T08:44Z,my lucky day dling at over 1mb ....ty
,Ocegues,2010-03-31T10:07Z,"Yeah i gotta agree if you really like a game and it has online play there's no reason not to buy it but if a game doesn't have demos and you don't have any friends that have the game downloading it is a good option to try it out, if it's a single player game and you blast through it in 20hours or less you're gonna be happy you didn't buy it in the worlds current financial situation"
,moe5512,2010-03-31T10:53Z,thx :D  if i find the game in a local store ill buy it

,tabiwan,2010-03-31T15:21Z,"for me there is some odd graphics issues, like no sky,red blinking everywhere. I re-installed and same problems, fucked with the graphics options, still a problem. I need to know if i am doing something wrong or if there is a way to fix it. I am on vista 64"
,18Zulukiller,2010-03-31T15:23Z,"Armagedon the guy that developed this game is a lying theiving son of bitch. The guy has litterally commited fraud on a massive scale against the people that payed for its development through the Beta. I know this for a fact as i'm one of the people that payed for its development (over 4 years ago) and have followed its development very carefully. 

So unless you're desperate to play online (another thing he lied about as he said there would be no online play) i encourage you all to not give this thieving turkish twat a penny of your money."
,Makubex27,2010-03-31T16:37Z,"This torrent does work online for now.  Not sure when this will be 'fixed', but you can play it just fine on the dedicated servers at this time.

On a side note, people that paid for the original game, this isn't worth shelling out $30 for.  Better to pirate it and let it be.  Had the developer given a $10 option or so to upgrade the original game into this I would have considered it, but I say just pirate it.  If you own neither, I recommend supporting the developer eventually if you like this of course :)."
,Neuro109,2010-03-31T21:19Z,Amazing game! Definitely buying once i get the money
,siim357,2010-04-01T13:46Z,"nice seeding ty a lot, it finished downloading in 12 minutes :D

,moe5512,2010-04-03T18:11Z,i bought the game today and shit its overpriced... 34 euros!!!
,zewalrus,2010-04-05T10:34Z,"They made some server for 1.102
You juste have to modify the hosts files

Open notepad in administrator then open
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Add:

190.210.56.155 taleworlds.com
190.210.56.155 www.taleworlds.com

Then look for internet server ingame
Server in South america its a bit laggy
Need one in North America !!!!!"
