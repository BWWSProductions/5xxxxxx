,kmr1684,2010-04-20T20:35Z,first disable the self protection and strat update it should work :) unless after disabling self defense stop the real time scan then it should do if nothing works then i do not anything more ;) :(
,CaptainPicard,2011-03-07T14:07Z,You might want to inform people when you are uploading an app that is 32-bit only.  If you have a 64-bit system this is useless
,GrimeyMike,2011-07-18T20:28Z,"I'm assuming this is NOT a virus, and downloading it anyhow thank you AlbaGuBrath."
,GrimeyMike,2011-07-18T20:43Z,Is there a valid serial number in the download or am I missing something?
,mistboy231,2011-11-18T01:32Z,the application is too old!
