Like T-Model Ford, Seasick Steve (aka Steve Wold) began recording his own music much later in his life than other musicians. A storytelling singer reviving traditional country-blues, Wold spent his childhood in California, but left home at 14. As a hobo, he traveled for several years, jumping trains and working odd jobs. After drifting around the U.S. and Europe, he finally ended up in Norway. Aside from his respectable musical background (which includes recording early Modest Mouse, appearing on BBC television, and playing with John Lee Hooker), Wold is also noted for his unusual custom-made stringed instruments. By the time he was in his sixties, he'd finally released some official material. His first solo album, Doghouse Music, out in late 2006, was performed almost entirely by Wold. Another record, Cheap, was recorded with the Swedish rhythm section the Level Devils. An amorous, seven-track, Valentine?s Day EP called Songs for Elisabeth (six of the cuts were culled from previous releases) arrived in 2010."
