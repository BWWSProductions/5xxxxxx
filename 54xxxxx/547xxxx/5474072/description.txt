Wraith: The Oblivion places characters in the role of recently and not so recently deceased spirits who have not yet passed onto their next life. Wraiths inhabit the Underworld, a reality which intertwines with our own reality where the dead can observe the living, but interfere with them only marginally. 

Of all the White Wolf Games, Wraith had the most troubled history. Mark Reinâ€¢Hagen stated early in the development of the game that he wanted players to feel uncomfortable playing it. As a result, Wraith uses several rules which are unique to the system and require advanced players, particularly the Shadow, which requires that each player in the troupe play as an antagonist to another player. Wraith is a demanding game for both players and Storytellers, and consequently had a limited audience throughout most of its history. Wraith ended several years before the other original World of Darkness games, with the supplement Ends of Empire during the Year of the Reckoning.
