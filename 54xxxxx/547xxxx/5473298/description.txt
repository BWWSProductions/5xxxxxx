Pretty. Odd. (or Welcome to the Sound of: Pretty. Odd.) is the second studio album by the band Panic at the Disco, released on the record label Fueled by Ramen. The first single from the album is "Nine in the Afternoon". The second single released as a digital single was "Mad as Rabbits" (released as a digital single on iTunes), although this was not really a radio single, a video was made (clips of them recording the song and clips of the filming of "That Green Gentleman" were used). The third single is "That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed)". The fourth single is "Northern Downpour."

One difference between their sophomore and their debut album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, is that many of the song titles come directly from the lyrics, whereas in A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, the majority of the titles of songs were from books and movies. The album also features songs where Brendon Urie and Ryan Ross both contribute the lead vocal roles. The album is heavily influenced by the music of bands such as The Beatles, The Beach Boys and The Byrds.[1]

It has sold over 1,000,000 copies worldwide and spent 18 weeks on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album is a departure from the sound on their previous album A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.[2]
