Really?
Its just some stupid comedy crap, has nothing to do with Documentaries."
,Phatfish,2010-04-03T20:47Z,"Ok, WARNING!

Fine quality, thanks TvTeam,
but ""movie"" is completely unwatchable.
Its like a porn movie without the porn if you know what I mean."

Opinions vary, everyone's got one and we all know the rest...some people like a mindless comedy now and again. every movie doesn't have to be an award winner - it's FREE, you wanker."
