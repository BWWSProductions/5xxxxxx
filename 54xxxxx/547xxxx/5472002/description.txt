Dickie moves on again, but this time with a familiar Brazilian girl who may be looking for someone else entirely. It is up to Clint to try to keep her identity hidden and figure out what she wants before anyone â€“ especially Abbey â€“ works out who she really is.

Elsewhere, events take an unexpected turn, which leads to several of the group re-examining their lives and juggling their relationships into new patterns.

This hit show gets to the heart of modern relationships, and stars some of Britainâ€™s top actors, including Amanda Abbington, Dean Lennox Kelly, Ralf Little, Miranda Raison, Shaun Dooley and Lucy Davis.
