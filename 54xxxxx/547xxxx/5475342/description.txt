This is a compilation of early Darkthrone,live performances from 1991 and some amusing news reports,spotlighting Norway's infamous Black Metal scene, and some news reports from the U.K and the U.S. You get to Catch up with the dudes in Immortal,check out some Church barbeques,Varg, Euronymous, kids vandalizing graveyards and churches,blood,fire,death,and the usual outraged parents and priests that usually show up in news reports about those "outrageous" metal scenes.Brings me back to 1985, and the fun we had with Al(Hot Air)Gore's wife,Tipper's tuppwerware party of Washington wives,the PMRC(Parents Music Resource Center)and let's not forget the 80's "Satanic Panic" and the hilarity that ensued.Good times. Variable quality, but overall,good fun to watch.
