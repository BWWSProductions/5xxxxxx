* About

The Matrix Reloaded: The Album is a 2003 soundtrack  album from the blockbuster movie, The Matrix Reloaded. The two-disc album is groundbreaking among soundtrack releases in that it includes separate discs for the film's songs and the score, whereas most films release the songs and the score as two single-disc albums.

The album's lead single was "Sleeping Awake" by P.O.D. The song's lyrics and video refer to elements of the film.
