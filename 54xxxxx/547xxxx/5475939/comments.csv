Any way, the boys are off tomorrow and I wouldn't be surprised if they take Monday off as well...

(In a lisping effeminate voice.)""Yeeessss.. Monday off."" Scroll scroll scroll... ""I'm gay.""

I'll post March 2010, and an as yet undecided classic month of O&A this weekend. Any suggestions?"

[T],shuazien,2010-04-02T17:14Z,"Never mind the suggestions, I've stumbled across ""the most offensive song"" contest. So that will be the classic month I post this weekend.  I might get today's ""Worst of"" and post that later as well."
,SissyCuckboy,2010-04-02T17:26Z,Do you know what segments they do for the Worst Of?
[T],shuazien,2010-04-02T19:25Z,"No clue, I've gota D/L the pieces, edit out the commercials, and stick it all together. It should be about an hour."
