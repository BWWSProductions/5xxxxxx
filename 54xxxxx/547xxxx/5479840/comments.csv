,The_Old,2010-04-04T10:05Z,Than ??? it is possible to write down? I ImgBurn refuses!
[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-04T16:24Z,"you can use burrrn to write them to dvd, or you can just copy and convert to mp3..."
,toja92,2010-04-04T17:40Z,"""you can use burrrn to write them to dvd, or you can just copy and convert to mp3... "" No point in downloading the FLAC version then, right? ;)

Anyway, I'll give this a go, thank you!
(And I'm requesting more Pink Floyd as well as Tool if possible)"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-04T17:51Z,"i'm gonna do Rubber Soul by the beatles first, and then i'll put up The Wall :D"
,miguel_n,2010-04-04T19:56Z,"HMVinyl, what's the difference between this upload and original Dark Side of the Moon CD ?

I own the original CD

and why to convert FLAC to MP3 ?
better FLAC ... I think ...

Thank you."
,]eep,2010-04-04T21:05Z,"'quality'? vinyl torrents? 

I'll give it 2 out of 10 for trying. I'v d/l track A1+2 and B1 just to hear.

Track A2 didn't play, B1 only 5 seconds and A1 was really bad. There is a lot of noise and it was modulated on amplitude (more noise after loud part). I could't hear how it tracked because A1 is really soft. 
There's no bass and highs are muffled. I really, really don't get it why you keep uploading this garbage. 

Making a 96k FLAC is completely pointless with this bad recording. "
,]eep,2010-04-04T22:04Z,"hm, it is something with Foobar that doesn't play these 24/96 correctly. MPC does play them. On the louder parts the sound is better. But tracking isn't good and that makes distortion clearly audible. 

So I'll give it 5 out of 10. Still a waste of bandwidth (the size being 3x as large as the better cd version)."
[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-05T00:39Z,"personally i find the cd's are worked on a little too much, the vinyl sound is untouched from the 1973 release, the cd's have been re-sampled through various filters throughout the years. These vinyl transfers are for the fans, who want to hear that old/warm sound.

also the tracks play fine for me in winamp, no distortion at all. make sure your sound card can handle 96 khz, some cant"
,]eep,2010-04-05T02:13Z,"compare it to this one:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5481074/The_Dark_Side_Of_The_Moon_(De-emphasized_Black_Triangle)

No need to BS me around. I've been a vinyl fan/supporter since before the introduction of the cd. I know what it is supposed to sound like. The introbeat is supposed to sound like a heartbeat. Here it doesn't.

*I do admire your effort for this though!*

I've just d/l a vinylrip of ACDC Highway to hell. Now that one sound good. Let me show you how that is done:

Technical Info About My Rips
Unless otherwise stated here is the technical info on my vinyl rips:

Turntable: VPI Scoutmaster with Trans-Fi Terminator Air Bearing Linear Tracing Tonearm

Cartridge: Audio-Technica AT33PTG

Phono Preamp: Pro-Ject TubeBox

Soundcard: E-MU 1212

All rips are recorded in full 24bit 192khz resolution and then resampled to 44/24 for manual click repair.

They are then dithered to standard redbook 16bit/44khz

I use IzotopeRX Advanced for all resampling/dithering

Try it, listen, and learn. 
The only trouble is: It 'll cost you money to reach any serious level with vinyl. And you won't get there with a Technics SL1200 DD.

Vinyl is the best and most user-agreeable copyprotection the record industry ever had. :)"
,]eep,2010-04-05T02:21Z,"""also the tracks play fine for me in winamp, no distortion at all.""

It's not my HD soundcard bro. It's your shitty round groove-trashing needle. Get a good headphone (like my DT880) and learn how to LISTEN. That takes training. It's not the ears, its what's in between that allows for the ability to listen and enjoy. 
You seem to be able to pick the right discs. So I trust you'll get there someday. Just be critical on your output and have something to make good comparisons."
[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-05T20:44Z,"if ya don't like it

don't download it

:)

@toja92 Sorry dude, I have 2 copies of ""The Wall"" but neither of them are in good enough condition to transfer, i'm always checkin the record stores so when i find a clean one i'll post it. Sorry again :)"
,toja92,2010-04-05T23:19Z,"HMV: Aww, too bad. Oh well. I'm getting stuff for free so I guess I shouldn't complain. Other Pink Floyd torrents would be appreciated aswell :)

(And Tool if you got any)"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-06T00:03Z,"sorry not a tool fan, not since the 90's at leased. i do have the delicate sound of thunder... not the best condition, but i'll give it a shot for ya :D"
,toja92,2010-04-06T00:22Z,"Awesome, thanks!"
,retardoface,2010-04-06T00:32Z,"quit your fucking complaining, i downloaded HMVinyl's rip of Rolling Stones hot rocks, best sounding rolling stones ive heard in a while. Ive been listening to forty licks on cd and its been gathering massive amounts of dust, these torrents are original and sound so much better in my opinion, i havent listened to this one but i imagine tit will be good. GOod job HMVinyl"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-06T02:56Z,"just for that, hot rocks is next, 96/24

the old rip imho sounds like shit, i just wanted some stones on my list, but this time it'll be on the technics tt :D"
,retardoface,2010-04-06T18:15Z,"this sounds pretty fucking amazing, original how its supposed to be. I find these days remasters fuck up the music alot, especially with The Doors, Rolling Stones and others too many to name, the doors is the up most worst though. The only remasters i beleive to be worth buying is the name beatles remasters, they sound fucking beastly"
,rosma32,2010-05-29T07:07Z,"Thanks for the effort mate :) In generall, coding analog audio (such as vinyl) into digital audio is a kinda hard.. with high quality results.. A professional or semiprofessional Analog/Digital convertion (ADC) audiocard will do the trick. Onboard audiocards are.. well. useless really.. I'd recommend bying something like ESI Juli@ or any M-Audio card.  
Hava a good one : )"

my newest torrent, a must have"
,j2k9p,2010-07-11T15:22Z,"Very nice! The quality of this rip is absolutely INSANE! I just registered here to thank you for the rip.rnSadly you don\'t have the whole discography. But people should learn from you.rnTHIS IS HOW THE FLAC IS SUPPOSED TO SOUND!rn(Other people\'s rips are just only good to spend hours of remastering...)rnVery nice, very nice!"
,j2k9p,2010-07-11T16:08Z,"...okay, on the second listening. I can say the CD mentioned up here really does sound much more better.rnYour version is better than most here. But there are few thing that are quite disturbing. Even considering your goal to make it sound \""like in the old times\"" you\'d be more careful about details. This rip has too much in lo-freqs. In mids it\'s too much wide and the highs sounds a bit flat to me. I\'ve also noticed distrotions in track Time.rnFor the normal listening, on some mainstream aparature / AI should be good thought. With all the written facts the files could be actually smaller. rnRefer to ]eep\'s comments if you want to know more.rnAs I said the first listening on mainstream speakers should sounds very well.rnJey."
