UGK Presents: UGK For Life


A unique memorial to Pimp C, who died in December 2007, UGK 4 LIFE doesn't smother the duo's swan song in posthumous sentiment. (There's a foreboding proclamation from Pimp C during the intro that he and Bun B are "back from the dead.") But from there, his surviving partner and production team let the music--and familiar themes of sex and other forms of indulgent relaxation--take center stage. Apart from inviting a revaluation of the late rapper's underrated soulfulness, 4 LIFE serves as a testament to UGK's trademark smoothness, which, on their final collaboration, evokes what the Ohio Players might sound like if they were updated for the hip-hop generation.

Audio Mixer: Mike Dean (Z-ro's Producer) .Rolling Stone (p.86) - 3.5 stars out of 5 -- 'Da Game Been Good to Me' reminds us what rap lost with Pimp C's death: one of its most musical and melodic MCs, with a thick drawl and a knack for wildly elongating words..."
Spin (p.98) - "UGK 4 LIFE is a fitting capper to this Texas duo's storied career -- nothing groundbreaking, just funky, rough-hewn, celebratory tracks."
Blender (Magazine) - 4 stars out of 5 -- "The languid beats are hazy with heat-distortion organs...the spirit is carefree....Pimp excelled at scowling, bawdy boasts, and he creates his own eulogy here..."
Pitchfork (Website) - "Bun-B's performance is a masterwork of nuance here, sounding doubled even when it's obvious he's not..."

Mike Dean's Quote From p.86 Rolling Stone:

"Back from the dead!" crows Pimp C in the opening moments of the sixth studio album by these Texas crackâ€“rap pioneers. It's an eerie moment â€” Pimp C was found dead in an L.A. hotel in December 2007 â€” but thankfully, Pimp's surviving partner, Bun B, doesn't wallow in the macabre. Instead, we get UGK basics: songs about drugs, sex and flossing, flavored with thudding, noâ€“nonsense beats. Cuts like the sulfurous "Da Game Been Good to Me" remind us what rap lost with Pimp C's death: one of its most musical and melodic MCs, with a thick drawl and a knack for wildly elongating words â€” stuffing seven or eight extra syllables into phrases like, well, "back from the dead."
