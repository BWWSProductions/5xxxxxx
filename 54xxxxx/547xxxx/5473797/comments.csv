this movie is only Norwegian?"
,vaultkeeper,2010-04-02T02:24Z,"This movie is made in Norway, so i think its pretty logical that it's in Norwegian language, why do you think there should be an English version?"
,SeeSirInn,2010-04-10T20:44Z,@vaultkeeper - ever heard of English dub or subtitles?
,vaultkeeper,2010-04-11T23:57Z,"It already have subtitles, in English. Why the hell would someone want a dub?"
