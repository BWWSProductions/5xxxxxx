        Sasha is distraught after another girl is attacked, and      
        worries that it's her attacker striking again. In an attempt 
        to get one over on golden boy Calvin, Malachy concocts a     
        plan to cash in on Mercedes' "assets". Jake ignores Loretta  
        and Frankie's calls as he settles into life with Caroline    
        and Johnny. And Carmel is convinced that Calvin is a changed 
        man.
