Star Wars The Clone Wars
Season 2 - Episode 18 "Zillo Beast"
HDTV XviD Cinemascope 2.35:1 16x9 AR

First off, i tried a new encoding method on this one and i think
it looks better. Not that the others were bad, but hey! any 
improvement is always good imo. So on that note... here is the
newest episode of the clone wars, which aired in the UK a week 
ahead of CN yet again. They also air it in the 2.35:1 Cinemascope 
AR (like the BD rls' of the first season)! Enjoy!
