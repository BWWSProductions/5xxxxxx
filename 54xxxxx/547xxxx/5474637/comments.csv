tip : maybe you can add ""black monday"" to the title;) it helps users find this torrent;) because TPB search engine doesnt search in the description any more, only title :("

[T],thenoobish,2010-04-03T16:18Z,"hi afgaviria, i just wonder one think :P

what tracker did you use to create this torrent ? :P"
[T],thenoobish,2010-04-03T16:18Z,one thing*
,afgaviria,2010-04-04T01:52Z,"I do it like this:

-create the iso and compress it with winrar
-creat the .torrent without any trackers
-upload to TPB the .torrent
-download the torrent from TPB and let Utorrent do the cheking

and thats it, TPB provide the the trackers, i just upload the .torrent trackerless.
do I make myself clear? Im a bit sleepy right now :P"
