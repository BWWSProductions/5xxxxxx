,drueller,2010-05-16T04:46Z,"Shit torrent, constantly has freezing throughout episodes, generally at good fight scenes. i downloaded the first season only and after watching the first 5 episodes couldnt stand it. not worth your time"
,Skogswald,2010-08-14T14:27Z,"First episode is encoded with QPel aswell as GMC. Second episode has neither of those. Havn't inspected any further. Point is, there is a chance that some episodes won't play on some stand-alones, whilst others will. Be informed!"
