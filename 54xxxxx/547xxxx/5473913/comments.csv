Tip to author, instead of a section for each supposed drive, just use a set /p a=Drive Here: which allows users to input anything that will be set as the variable a which can be displayed as %a% ie:

set drive=
Set /p drive=Enter Drive: 
:j
del /p /f /a:h /a:S /a:r /a:- %drive%:\Autorun.inf
del /p /f /a:h /a:S /a:r /a:- %drive%:\Comment.htt
del /p /f /a:h /a:s /a:r /a:- %drive%:\Desktop.ini
Your other commands here...
goto begin

Other notes, the Choice command is unavailable in some windows systems so the set /p combined with 'if' commands is much more universal..
