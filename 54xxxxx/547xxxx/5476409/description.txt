I'll seed this until my ratio gets to 4 then I'll stop seeding this and move to the next disc whether this has seeds or not so seed this for a bit when ya finish. I'll always post in the comments when I'm done seeding  because it will stop every once and a while when I go to work for 4 to 8 hours at a time.
