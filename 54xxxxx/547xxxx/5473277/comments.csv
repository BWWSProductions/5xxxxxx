,kedawa,2010-04-19T03:15Z,"FAKE!
All this is is some printer drivers hidden in severl layers of compression.
Uploader is a fucking tool."
,cockandballs,2010-05-01T12:09Z,@kedawa: Are you fucking stupid?
,amivoytec,2010-07-04T01:44Z,"@kedawa
What the hell are you talking about?"
,luke_s,2010-10-07T10:30Z,"I can confirm what Kedawa said. This is FAKE! The last layer of compression is even corrupted and contains a folder with printer drivers.

Looking at ""cockandballs"" other uploads and so called comments makes me think he probably works for the industry or is just a kid wanting to spread crap uploads.

Easiest way to find out for yourselves is just to download this file and open it. Make sure to comment here so no one else makes the same mistake."
,luke_s,2010-10-07T11:04Z,"I think I found the original upload here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3279190/

Not sure how alive the seed is"
,kedawa,2010-10-20T01:17Z,"Thanks luke_s  That torrent has everything I need.
This shit cockandballs put up is just botched.  What the fuck is the point of compressing something that many times?  What a retard."
,luke_s,2010-11-11T17:10Z,You can also find LOTS of apps on the English Amiga Board site (eab.abime.net). I downloaded them all and I'm trying to share them in a torrent here but after 6 weeks of trying to upload and only getting error messages I'm giving up.
,luke_s,2011-01-21T16:21Z,I think I might finally have been able to get my torrent working. Feel free to check it out: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5950028/Commodore_Amiga_-_Applications_-_ADF_%28TOSEC_20100813%29
,cockandballs,2011-08-08T10:42Z,"@kedawa aka luke_s: Go fuck yourselves.  This is the real deal.  Since you're being such a bitch about it, I'm going to upload MORE in the future."
,luke_s,2011-08-14T17:23Z,"So what you're saying is that with me claiming this upload is crap, asking people to find this out by downloading it themselves you will ""get back at me"" for trashing your upload by uploading even more crap? Or do you mean ""borrowing"" other people's uploads and seeding it as your own? Feel free to borrow mine... it actually works :)"
,cockandballs,2011-08-23T21:09Z,"You are almost right.  Except the part about my upload being crap.  You are simply too incompetent to use it, and now that you've realized it, you're too retarded to admit it.  Discussion is over, more uploads will follow."
,cockandballs,2011-08-23T21:12Z,"luke_s: one last thing - where did I say this was my own?  Nah, I won't bother checking for your answer anyway."
