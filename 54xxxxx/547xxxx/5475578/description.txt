       1/3 - Speed Limits

       Richard Hammond explores the extraordinary wonders of the world of 
       detail hidden in the blink of an eye.
       
       The human eye takes about fifty milliseconds to blink. But it 
       takes our brain around a hundred and fifty milliseconds to process 
       what we see. We're not aware of this time lag going on, but in 
       those few milliseconds, there are extraordinary things happening 
       that completely pass us by.
       
       But what if we could break through this speed limit? Bend and 
       stretch time in ways never thought possible. What new marvels 
       would we see?
       
       Now, using the latest high-speed cameras, Richard takes us on a 
       journey beyond our eye's limits, letting us see secrets hidden in 
       every element of our planet.
       
       A world where thin air can shatter rock.
       
       And water can tear through metal.
       
       A world where the fastest thing on earth lies right beneath our 
       feet.
       
       And where a spectacular celestial display is finally captured, 
       even though many have claimed it doesn't even exist.
