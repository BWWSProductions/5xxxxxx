These cartoons were directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, famous for Dexter's Laboratory, and Samurai Jack. They aired on Cartoon Network as a series of shorts after the theatrical release of Episode II, but before Episode III. Then they were released to dvd, linking all the shorts back to back as movies, in these two volumes.

These Cartoons are in no way connected with the subsequent Clone Wars computer animated movie or the series of the same name which also aired on CN. However those projects did borrow heavily from this series' character designs.

These Movies are PS3 ready, in mp4 format, with commentary tracks included. Volume 1 has hardcoded subs for the few blurbs of alien dialect in Chapter 6. and the dvd extras are also included.
