`       CUT THE CRAP PLAYLIST - SERIOUSLY UNCRAP - MARCH 2010        `
     ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This month: NEW Kate Nash, Holy Fuck, The National, Gorillaz, Bocce,
Caribou and the list goes on. Beck remixes Air. "D.A.N.C.E." by Justice
in its original, wonderful form. Introducing: Tanlines, Archie Bronson
Outfit and Cults. This month's playlist is shorter than usual but it's
also pretty damn good if I do say so myself... hope everyone's spring
break was good/is going well... enjoy! And happy spring!
