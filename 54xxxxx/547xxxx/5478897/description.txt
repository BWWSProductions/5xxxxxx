BBC Sacred Music Series2 2of4 560p PDTV x264 AC3 2010

Four-part documentary series in which Simon Russell Beale explores the flowering of Western sacred music.

Part 2: Faure and Poulenc
Simon Russell Beale travels through the urban and rural landscapes of France to explore the story behind Faure's Requiem, one of the best-loved pieces of sacred music ever written. With Harry Christophers and The Sixteen, he goes on to discover how this work laid the foundations for a distinctively French style, a tradition continued by the compelling music of the outrageously fashionable Francis Poulenc, working in the heart of jazz-age Paris.
