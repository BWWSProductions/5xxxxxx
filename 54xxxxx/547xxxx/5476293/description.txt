The Kundalini Target is the debut solo album from Ocean Colour Scene member and Paul Weller collaborator Steve Cradock due for release in January 2009. The album was recorded by Cradock at Paul Weller's Black Barn recording studio in Surrey  with Cradock playing most of the instrumentation on the album with contributions from Paul Weller, backing vocals from Cradock's wife Sally together with additional production by former Talk Talk Bass player Paul Webb.
 Steve Cradock recently described the genesis of the album as thus: It started with me trying to write a song for my two kids. I wanted to write something that wasnâ€™t too sweet or saccharine and I think I managed that. The album just kind of grew from there.  All songs were written, produced and performed by Cradock, with the exception of 'Something Better' which was written by Gerry Goffin and Barry Mann.
