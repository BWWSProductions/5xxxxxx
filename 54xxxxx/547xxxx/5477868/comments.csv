,Famousdim,2010-04-03T07:50Z,Thanks for your Torrent!
[T],artpepper,2010-04-03T09:19Z,"My pleasure, @Famousdim. Glad you found it useful. I haven't tried it myself but I'm going to. 

All the other desktop recording  suites I looked at before were just too steep of a learning curve. This looks like it might actually be quite easy (comparatively) to learn to use."
,320hunter,2010-04-03T10:55Z,"This works as it should, no problems at all, I thank you ""artpepper"" :D :D :D"
,puma_ile,2010-04-07T00:08Z,Has anyone got some additional soundpools for this ?
,loza007,2010-04-07T07:20Z,seeding....
,robjay,2010-04-10T14:01Z,Haven't tried it yet but it's gotta be easier than Ableton for a newbie like myself. Might even upload some demos if i get any good at it. Thanks uploader !
,Nick_14,2010-04-17T12:53Z,your instructions are very clear and thank you for a great upload BUT i have downloaded this program in the past and the 7 day trial has expired so when the program opens with anything i do it closes automatically. I also do not exactly know what you mean by the installation folder...you may call me retarded for that or whatever but it doesnt matter i REALLY want this to work. thanks to anyone who helps me out with this
[T],artpepper,2010-04-22T19:53Z,"@Nick, the 'installation' folder just means the folder in your Program Files where this program mainly resides. Just copy the cracked file into that folder. You should get a message saying 'xxxx file already exist. do you want to replace it?' click on 'yes'. And you're done."
,cody912,2010-04-25T10:21Z,yea im a pretty big noob at this stuff to and im pretty confused this directions sound pretty simple but im still if someone could do almost a complete walkthrough that would be great thx
,Inciser,2010-05-02T02:35Z,"Great Torrent. Thanks alot. I've ony got one issue though, ive instaled it correctly and inserted the crack, but there are only 3 styles with limited loops, surely for a ""premium"" package there should be more?? or can i get more off the net? thanks guys for you help"
,swass316,2010-06-06T06:09Z,Works great
,jester9200,2010-06-29T23:19Z,"hey, does anyone wana give me a step by step explanation of this shit? sorry to be a pain. but im not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed. it would be greatly appreciated if you help me."
,htcrebel,2010-07-03T11:50Z,"@jester9200....
after the download just install the program..it will ask for a key to register...just ignore it,close the program, search it again in your program file where you installed it...open it, than copy the crack from the download in their..it will say ""file already exists"" just click ""replace file""...start the program again and your done:)"
,twztch,2010-07-06T02:12Z,"I DL this and copied the crack into the program files, now it says that there is a problem with the program and I need to reinstall....idk what to do!"

,rojolimar,2010-08-27T04:21Z,"I downloaded it and installed it just fine, I think, but every time I load it up the all the other tabs (Syntesizers, etc) disappears save for Soundpools. What do I do? :/"
,gearheadtheman,2010-09-11T00:43Z,"Thanks dude! Downloaded very quickly- great torrent! But the soundpools that came with it...they didn't work :/. So for all the people that are asking where to get more music from, you get a soundpool, here. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5596585/MAGIX_Soundpool_DVD_Collection_16_for_Music_Maker
*Note that I haven't tried this yet- I'm downloading it right now. According to the comments, it seems pretty legit! :D"

Thanks for the upload."
,Bootsystem47,2011-05-20T00:04Z,"You can't go wrong with Magix, anytime.

Many thanks, Artpepper, for your effort and time. We always appreciate. That's why the community is teeming and busy!!"
,lolage23,2011-05-22T12:51Z,oh fuuuu v 16
,mazdarati,2011-05-25T17:45Z,"doesn't work, cuz after install it keeps searching for VST modules and then it do nothing. so i stopped the proces and try to run the crack but he says automatticly that it doesnt work.HELP!!!"
,molly_dog,2011-08-29T05:34Z,"Hi artpepper,
I'm trying your torrent now. I've already tried 15 and 17...both worked, but like inciser noted down the page (up the page?), I only have access to an extremely limited selection of loops/instruments/sounds, etc. I'm fully planning to $ 17 premium but want to try the entire program first. The trials just aren't enough to convince me to whip out my card.

Do the bulk of the soundpools have to be d/l'd from magix or what?

Hoping I have better luck with 16......"
,molly_dog,2011-08-30T00:26Z,"Oh, well...got the same thing as with the others...no matter the crack, it's still a trial according to Magix where you have to download additional soundpools, etc.

Still, I'm going to tinker around with it because I do plan to buy it eventually"
,im_da_1,2011-09-10T04:11Z,works like a charm....@artpepper ur da man ty very much...
,Baethos,2012-05-03T02:44Z,"anyone who can't get it working isn't doing it right.
if not then let me help:
1: install in trial mode
2: go to C:Program Files (x86)MAGIXMusicMaker16Premium_Download_Version
3: copy-paste from the torrent file crack into C:Program Files (x86)MAGIXMusicMaker16Premium_Download_Version
4: you now have MAGIX music maker 16 download version"
