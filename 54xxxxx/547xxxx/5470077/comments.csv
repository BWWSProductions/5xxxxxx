,samgrey,2010-03-29T09:04Z,Not a DVD - the sound is pretty wonky throughout - muffled and noisy - and for several minutes near the end the dialogue actually switches to another language altogether (something Eastern European sounding).
[T],extremezone,2010-03-29T16:42Z,"yes is same as r5 , mislabeled release"
,manavkalra,2010-03-30T08:20Z,where the fuck is the DVDrip for this... its been a while !!
,ptv83,2010-03-30T17:37Z,"mono sound - line audio R5 and ending is in russian (not english) . NOT A DVD

same as what was already out a long long time ago... "
,ahalheru,2010-03-31T03:09Z,"God damnit!!  Quit posting DVDRip in the title if it's an R5.

,QoMSoL,2010-03-31T12:10Z,Video is off a dvd true. But the sound is awful!
,horsse,2010-03-31T19:13Z,"raymond only re-seeds movies, admittedly without even watching them, don't expect quality .

Possibly a bot."
