I don't know what you need Acrobat, but if you use it to create and edit PDF files, you can find many smaller programs that do the job, working also on protected files. AAR looks a lot like what someone call ""Bloatware"", 1.4 GB for handling such kind of files seems too much for me. I've found some other progs that do the job and are max 30 MB. Of course if you need all the extras that AAR gives, then it's better to have it installed. Portables are for quick 'n dirty works on machines that don't have the Real SW installed."

Just to give it a try. I've D/L v9.3.1 from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5462571/Adobe_Acrobat_9.3.1_Pro_Extended___Keygen_[WL] and I've made it Portable using ThinApp. It was coming out as big as more than 2 GB, not the stuff you can fit easily on a key, hoping that the license continues to work. My opinion is that if you need it often, you better install it, and if you seldom need a tool for PDF management, find a smaller one that does what you need."
