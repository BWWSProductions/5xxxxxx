DOCman 1.5.2 released on 1/20/2010
----------------------------------

Today we released the latest update of DOCman 1.5 to our customers. These are some of the most important changes:

* PHP 5.3 compatibility. Depending on your server configuration, running DOCman on PHP 5.3 produced a couple of innocent yet annoying error messages.
    
* Special characters in filenames. DOCman is now much better equiped to handle filenames with all kinds of strange characters in them.
    
* Deleted users. When you delete a user, the documents that user owned now no longer generate errors.

* Clear Thumbnails. This new item in the 'Clear data' panel allows you to remove the thumbnails for all documents. This useful in combination with the upcoming Thumbnail generation add-on.
    
* ... and a whole bunch of other fixes and improvements. 

As usual, users who bought v1.5.x get free updates. To get you own copy, head over to the Joomlatools Store.
