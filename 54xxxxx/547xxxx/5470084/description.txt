History of Detroit by the BBC

Powered by extraordinary archive â€“ vivid projections of the cityâ€™s heyday on itâ€™s now abandoned buildings â€“ and the irrepressible music that continues to come out of Detroit, from ragtime and rap to techno, the documentary charts the rise and fall of the â€˜Big Threeâ€™, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, and the impact the decline of these giants has had on the city. Detroit was at the forefront of the American dream of the 20th Century.
