i see this is an iso. why is it telling me the file is too big to save when i'm saving it on a 500GB HDD?  this has happened a few times and i never thought to ask until i tried downloading your New Moon & Sherlock Holmes torrents.  any help would be greatly appreciated.  

thank you in advance."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-03T07:55Z,"disregard my last comment. i figured it out. my external HDD is FAT32, it needs to be formatted to NTFS to override the default 4GB file transfer.  sorry for wasting your space with stupid comments but i am downloading your torrent so thank you for this!"
[T],FatFreddy007,2010-04-03T08:35Z,"Agradezco el comentario, hizo darme cuenta por qué no puede guardar en mi pendriver Usb. gracias"

[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-03T09:00Z,i've downloaded some dvd-rs from this user too with no problems.  i didnt say the problem was on his end. i looked into my problem and found it was my HDDs. i never once said it was his fault.  i never saw the error message i received before.  god forbid i ask a question.  so shut the fuck up you faggot cunt.
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-03T09:26Z,"@ agentbay

thank you for commenting on my problem and not ridiculing me for a mistake i made.  i am very good with electronics and it never crossed my mind to reformat.  i am not reformatting my external for SK's torrents. i've chosen to save this torrent to my laptops hard drive which is NTFS.  when the download is complete i will just burn it off my computer.

its nice to see there are still decent people willing to help in the world.  thank you for understanding and taking the time to comment me back!  much appreciated my friend."
,Mercyflush64,2010-04-03T19:06Z,"Yesterday I ordered a Rosewill external HD case for $40 off of Newegg. This allows me to use 2 hard drives in it up to 2TB each and they can raid together to form a single drive. Something to think about in the future if you have extra drives sitting about or consider this is far superior vs. the self contained external drives you can't swap out if there is a failure.

And my comment about this user having good downloads was not directed to you or your problem. I was commenting only that this user has proven downloads before the ""fakes"" start posting due to this being the only full rip of this movie posted so far."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-03T22:16Z,"@ mercy

then i will apologize for being a dick.  this situation is a prime example as to why text on the internet gets interpreted wrong and starts problems with people.  have a nice day everyone!

& SK continue to post dvd-rs! you always seem to post the ones no one else has.  the ones i want!  thank you."
