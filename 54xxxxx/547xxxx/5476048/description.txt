Sunset Blvd. (1950), Directed by Billy Wilder


Joe Gillis: You're Norma Desmond. You used to be in silent pictures. You used to be big.

Norma Desmond: I am big. It's the pictures that got small. 


Perhaps the greatest of all Hollywood films about Hollywood. If you've never seen it, you don't know what you're missing. Great acting, great script, great directing, scenes that'll burn themselves into your memory, great lines...what's not to love?

The wiki entry is well worth reading but the film is what has to be seen. If you're the kind of film-goer who has Attention Deficit Disorder and needs lots of shooting, explosions and car-chases to keep you focused, this won't be the film for you. You won't get it.

 If, on the other hand, you're a bit of a cynic with a dark sense of humour, the kind of person who thinks that the world is a pretty fucked up place filled with some seriously deranged people (but you love it anyway), then this is your kind of film and you're my kind of people.
