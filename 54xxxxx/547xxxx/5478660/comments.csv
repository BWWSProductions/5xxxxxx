,cinesimon,2010-04-03T15:15Z,"Here's hoping this isn't a re-encode of that terrible TED 'DVDR' without the Turkish 5.1 audio - that really was/is stretching the meaning of the term 'DVDR'!
Hopefully some feedback about quality and whether it really is a retail copy will arrive soon - I see some folk have already got it..."
,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-04-03T15:53Z,where are the subs info?
,JPeterson,2010-04-03T17:10Z,@cinesimon Same here. The best way to be sure though is if there is a non-nuked scene DVDR. Which there isn't at the moment.
,theone_nr,2010-04-05T06:17Z,VCD Quality !!!
,FlyingFrisia,2010-04-05T12:00Z,"Yes, still signs of compression , so I can't believe it is retail. Yet much better than everything I've seen so far.
Thanks!!"
,rudi_k,2010-04-05T12:14Z,"The quality of this DVD version is mutch worse then the latest DVD-Screener versions.

The compression is very good visable as mpg art-effects ""blocks"" !

The source is indeed RETAIL R2 (turkish, magyar).
3 Audio's are available (English, Turkish and Magyar)

Because of these 3x 5.1DD (384kbps) the avg videobitrate is only 2.6mbps.
This is for a DVD-Standard far to low !!!

Furthermore it is obviously that a very poor shrink tool is being used.
The mpg art-effects are realy good visable !?

Video : 6
Audio : 9

Best Regards."
