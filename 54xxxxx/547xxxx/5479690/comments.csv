You know, things like:

1. How to type up a fooking decent description of just what the Hell is in the upload

2. How to provide a preview picture

3. How to pick a proper handle so we don't have 4,196,478,612,184,841,516 anonymous people (or is it anonymi if it's plural???)

I mean geez...thanx for uploading ""sum hawt gurlz"", but take some pride, ya' slope headed, knuckle dragging, slack-jawed, mouth breathing, mono-syllabic troglodyte.

Have a nice day."
,jetsgiant,2010-04-04T05:57Z,where is ur upload
,MT_Head,2010-04-04T07:39Z,"I don't have an upload, mentalgiant...but if I were so inclined to upload whatever I may have that you would be interested in, you can rest assured that I would be gracious enough to include a description and a courtesy pic. 

I do apologize if I have offended you by insulting your boyfriend...but perhaps you should take him by the hand instead of by the mouth. Perhaps you could take a moment from all your vast experience of uploading and teach him a few things, what with that plethora of things you have shared I'm sure you could write a phucking book on the subject.

Oh wait...after looking at your lonely torrent, I can see that maybe you have taught him all he knows."
