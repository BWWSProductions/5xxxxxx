,Livens,2010-04-03T05:37Z,"thanks eztv, love your work. However, my HD is gigantic and my DL speed is outrageous. The difference between a 350 and a 1000 MB download is negligible these days. So I really don't see the need for anything less than 720 for these anymore. So I will have to patron those TvGuys from now on... if only they would stop using those incessant rar files."
,rastanikoten,2010-04-03T07:02Z,"this must be a fake.
see http://eztv.it/shows/326/stargate-universe/

that torrent is 1.09gb"
,rastanikoten,2010-04-03T07:04Z,oh i was mistaken
,Glamdring_RS,2010-04-03T07:36Z,"Livens: Now wait a moment, my friend. I don't know exactly how it works wherever you live, but here in Brazil (and I bet in most of the world) the difference of downloading and storing 350 or 1,000 Mb is huge. So I think eztv is doing us a favor. And for ""us"", I mean everyone else not so rich as you seem to be."

,csabaxb,2010-04-03T11:10Z,Thanks. Fast download and good quality.A9V9.
,Devilinious,2010-04-03T11:21Z,"stop fucking crying you fucking fags you speak like you have never downloaded a torrent before

You want different format? Then you go fucking download it elsewhere than this link!

20kb/s? then you fucking start seed instead of leechsteal ninjarun

I start to get pissed off about this global stupidity I read in every fucking comment area on every fucking torrent. People WASTE comment area which is suited for gentile questions and opinions and not this fucking shit chat.. hell! grow balls and use your fucking brains you fucks fuck.

Also, thanks eztv
you are doing awesome job, don't mind these jackasses with 0 IQ"

,Artess,2010-04-03T12:42Z,"Well, I watch all the series I download here on my PC screen and the quality of eztv's 350M uploads are good enough for me, so once again - thanks for the job you're doing."
,hart37,2010-04-03T12:45Z,Brilliant as always Eztv. Really the only place worth getting any TV on the bay

Sorry, but how egocentric can you get!

Do you understand these files are not there for your convenience and only yours?

Plenty of cappers/encoders and uploaders understand that plenty of people don't have more than 1.1mbit connections because they are still copper wire, a number still have to use 56k modems even, you know, like people in the 3rd world and impoverished countries and even impoverished peoples in more affluent countries.

Not everybody has massive hard drives and ""outrageous"" connection speeds, you may have but if you noticed, you ain't the only one downloading this or other titles which are smaller files.

Bloody incredulous attitudes some people, try thinking about others more, not your own egocentric existence, egocentrism is one of the major states of being and mind which have led to so many negatives we see in this world today.

Apart from that, smaller files are ideal for portable devices.

Appalling attitude, you are not the only person in existence!

@rastanikoten at 2010-04-03 07:02 CET

LMAO!

See that green skull, it means **trusted**.
You only have to click eztv's name there and you'll see all previous uploads, not a fracking fake among them.

First timer are we?

eztv often up's a 1.9Gb as well as the smaller 350Mb versions of weekly shows and nice of them to do so, so prissy HQ whingers can have quality which allows them to analyse the pixels as much as people who just want to watch the shows and are not HQ whingers and those with slower connections can watch shows quicker.

Thanks EZTV! : )

a definate ""Doh!!"" moment, lolz! : )"
,ZoolooCH,2010-04-03T12:50Z,"@Livens, please grow the fuck up and leave your elitist, egocentric bullshit for another website. "
,DeltaPan,2010-04-03T12:53Z,"To add.

When it comes to weekly shows, i am satisfied with filesizes which are around 175mb when available, i just want to watch the fracking shows, not analyse pixels!

Peace! : )"

When I open this it wants me to download FLVdirect""

Reason it's asking you to download flvdirect is you're trying to watch it without having correct codecs installed.

Encoding to xviD/DivX whatever, compresses the information, which shrinks the filesizes, then using the codec installed on your computer, the files are decompressed to inflate the binarty information in the file and realises as much quality as the decompressed info can give, if this wasn't the case, we'd all be downloading DVD size files, not 700/350mb files, without codecs files would all be 4-5-6Gb's for basic quality.

Essentially, that is.

It's not like fakes asking you to download a media player etc.

Here!!!

Download K-Lite codec pack, standard, free, nothing dodgy, no con, no cost to you.

Torrent or direct download.

Peace. ; )"
,Sattori,2010-04-03T19:55Z,Thank you!!!!!!! I was starving for this episode. Keep it up guys!!!!!!!!!
,doomjack6,2010-04-03T20:04Z,"thx eztv! :) 

..and thx you to DeltaPan.  ...but the wired this is that some videos of eztv play, no probles but some ask the flv player... some are with codec and some not or what? :D"
,rasprenkle,2010-04-03T22:51Z,FUUUUUU  this had to be the WORST episode of the series.. makes NO sense and has NOOOO future.. This is why every other space show keeps the cycle of Aliens speaking English..
,DeltaPan,2010-04-04T13:45Z,"@doomjack6

It's the source file before encoding, if show is capped to .flv, then encoded to XviD, the manner the XviD codec decompresses for play by most media players is dependant on elements of the .flv algorythms also as they are also encoded into the XviD result we download.

If capped to .avi, which all media players have decoding algorythms as default codecs, when encoded to XviD, media players won't require the non standard .flv cidec algorythms to decompress..

Depends on the original format cappers use before files are further reduced in filesize using standard xvid encoding.

Basically.

Hope that helps matey.

Some would say, why don't capper/scene groups standardise, i would say, indeed, but that's the way it is.

Peace."
,pimpmobile,2010-04-05T09:05Z,"lame they finally do an action episode and the so called battle lasts less than 5 min!  to add more to the lamality they play some redneck country music at the end, this show blows!   I say someone should shoot them then the it might become interesting I'd watch them squirm in pain for hours it'd be fun!"

,drewkrew,2010-09-19T01:59Z,"BY FAR the best episode so far, and made even greater by the fact that like many others, I got upto episode 10 and had to wait months before the rest of the series became available, and so the long wait was made worth it with this episode.
Why has Stargate Universe took so much stick, by SGA fans aswell as non-Stargater's lol!
If you don't like it, don't watch it, innit!"
