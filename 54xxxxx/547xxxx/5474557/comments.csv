,warrior161,2010-06-08T22:17Z,Don't try and download the 32 and 64 bit versions at the same time. They have the same names and overwrite each  other and screw up
,naraku00,2010-06-11T20:20Z,Is this really the x64 version. All the the programs in this suite has *32 next to the executable in task manager. 
[T],xxThugxx,2010-06-27T21:02Z,"Yeah naraku00 is right this is a 32bit version not 64bit, thanks anyway thingy am not arsed the 32bit version will do me lol clean and works well :D"
,alxfreeman,2010-08-31T03:21Z,Read comments carefully!! The both torrents are with identical names and overwrite each other. Download it separatelly.
,vasudeva,2010-09-17T20:02Z,"Works without a hitch but that is nothing new for thethingy. Paragon is a welcome breeze for me after ATIH 2011 and ATIH 2011 twice messed up with my PC's boot loader and caused that `starting acronis loader.... Once you get to know it, the program seems very versatile and cool."
,mark17022,2011-01-13T00:28Z,Hey thethingy I know this is an old torrent but any chance you have the latest version 2011 of this? Love all the good work you do man!
