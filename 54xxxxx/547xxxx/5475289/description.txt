Double-episodes or Pilot ep. will be issued only as MP4 or 360p.
MP4 is ISO 14496-1(H264 video & AAC LC sound) and playable on PCs, Macs and iPod-like portable-mobile devices.
Due to smaller frame-size recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768.
360p is fully compatible with newer iPod, iTouch and Nokia U97. 
Requests should be posted in Comments section of newest torrents.
"Out of schedule" shows or pilot-episodes may get uploaded randomly, if situation arise (free slots).

I recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.
VLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.
One can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.
QuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.
PS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.
I am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system and proper loudspeakers.
And please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).
Many of movies I encode have embedded or external  subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.
