When Tintin and Snowy travel to Syldavia with Professor Alembick they find themselves mixed up in a rebel plot to depose the Syldavian king. If the king does not carry King Ottokar's sceptre in the royal procession he will lose his throne, and when the rebels manage to steal the sceptre the detectives Thomson and Thompson are called in.  An all-night chase over the mountains and an adventurous trip by airplane ensues.
