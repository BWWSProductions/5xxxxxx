"Eleanor Rigby" is a song by The Beatles, simultaneously released on the 1966 album Revolver and on a 45rpm single. The song was written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon. With a double string quartet arrangement by George Martin, and striking lyrics about loneliness, the song continued the transformation of the group from a mainly pop-oriented act to a more serious and experimental studio band.

Twisted Sister guitarist Eddie Ojeda recorded a cover version of the song for his 2006 solo album Axes 2 Axes. Dee Snider performed the vocals.

Eddie "Fingers" Ojeda (born August 5, 1955 in New York City, New York) is one of the two guitarists of the American heavy metal band Twisted Sister. In early 1970s he recorded a couple of singles with a band called SPX. He joined Twisted Sister in 1975. He also recorded a solo album named Axes To Axes in 2005 featuring Dee Snider, Ronnie James Dio and Rudy Sarzo among others. In a 2006 interview with rock & roll comic C.C. Banana, Eddie revealed if Twisted Sister ever retired that it would still be possible for the band to continue performing under their alternate name Bent Brother.

Eddie, along with other popular rock guitarists in the mid-80's, performed in the Hear 'n Aid project, launched by Ronnie James Dio, which had a similar goal as both Band Aid and USA for Africa.
