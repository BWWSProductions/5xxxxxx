This Album takes our mind way back to 13th century when there was no evidence to prove
the existence of mankind, "Stampede has its root in a real story where all the Giants
Lived,The word Stampede goes farther back to when these giants were the only ones
practicing Rituals and Ceremonies to enhance there powers Thus there purpose was not to
destroy the creation of God infact they were like a safety tool against evil. 

it was said that the evil would return after every 300 years,so that was the main reason
for existence of these species called Giants, as they were like coast guards who would
not only defeat evil but also destroy it from the root so that mankind could exist
without any fear of evil. These Giants were specially trained under the influence of
hardcore organics which were known to heal and make them strong,usually the life span of
a giant was around 400 years so they kept taking rebirths until and unless they fulfill
there duty and there duty was to defeat evil without any regrets whatsoever and if they
fail to do so they would have to take a rebirth and shall continue there job,once the job
is done giants would return back to paradise forever and only then mankind would exist. 

The main aim of these giants was to destroy evil and live like a free soul away from the
materialistic world and just to be a free soul the karma of destroying evil was the key
!!! 

A life without a birth,a soul without a body !!! 

This Album takes us through the training procedures and rigorous processes explaing how
good prevailed over evil and the exact story beign demonstrated through sound when heard
in higher state of conciousness would explain the entire epic in detail that caused an
Evil Stampede, so be prepared for an excruciating yet ultimately power packed dark
psychedelic mystical journey into the deep realms of mind to attain next level of
awareness and Let the music do the talking !!!!
