[T],artpepper,2010-04-01T06:44Z,The full version. That's what '+ Crack' means in the description...
[T],artpepper,2010-04-01T09:43Z,"I'm sorry, @jsingh but I don't use this app myself and don't have it installed. 

I can only suggest that you try installing the 'templates' .exe file first, then do the xara installation. If that doesn't help, let me know and I'll install xara on my machine and see if I can work out what's going wrong for you."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-01T09:52Z,"Also, you might try xara's problem page here:

http://support.xara.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&_a=view&parentcategoryid=477"
[T],artpepper,2010-04-01T14:56Z,"OK, @jsingh, I think I've solved your problem.

 The templates.exe file that came with this is faulty for some reason. What I did was I opened Xara, clicked on 'help', then clicked on 'download templates'. 

A download will start automatically (a 157 MB exe.file from Xara). When completed, double-click on this file and it will install automatically.

Now open Xara, click on 'file', click on 'new from design gallery' and you should see a whole shitload of 'themes' (complete multi-page website templates). Now delete the downloaded .exe file and the old templates .exe file.

Hope this helped."

,abgar,2010-04-10T02:07Z,Beware ! Mouth fucken retard artepper is uploading virus contaminated files !
[T],artpepper,2010-04-11T17:37Z,"Poor @abgar. Never mind, believe it or not, even a spiteful little dolt like you may one day find a girl-friend. Miracles DO happen, chum. 

In the meantime, why don't you upload something instead of spamming other peoples work? Make a nice change from being a parasite.

You're pathetic, dude..."
,sludgegulper,2010-04-14T23:38Z,"thanks for the up, works like a dream didn't even have to muck around with the templates, all downloaded and installed to perfection. Once again many thanks."

,gruntworker,2010-05-25T00:34Z,"Much as I'd like to like this program, the people at Xara just seem to be missing a bit when it comes to designing software that works with Windows. Using Vista Home, this thing worked well for a while and then simply started crashing every time I asked it to do something unusual, say import a graphic or save a file. I removed, reinstalled - no help. Maybe you'll be luckier."

,ZDaddy,2010-12-01T22:02Z,"(Simmo3749) Uninstall any previous installation attempts, then run a registry cleaner to remove any leftover xara stuff. Then  1. unplug from the internet. 2. Install program, but DO NOT start it up 3. Copy the Patch into the Xara directory (C:\Program Files\Xara\Xara Web Designer 6) 4. Apply the patch 5. Re-connect internet 6. Start up the program (if it asks you to register, Don't) 7. On the menu bar of Xara click on ""Help"", then Download Templates. You should be good-to-go! "

,lodpot,2011-04-20T15:43Z,"Is there a way for you to upload ""Xara Template Pack 1 for Xara Designer and Web"" torrent for people who do not have access to speedy internet and would rather be able to download it of torrent?
