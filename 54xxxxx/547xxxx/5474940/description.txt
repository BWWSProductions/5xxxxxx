Xara Web Designer 6 with Templates | 102 MB


Xara Web Designer 6 which goes beyond the realms of other website builders. Unlike other website builders, Xara Web Designer is the only truly free-form WYSIWYG web design tool, that allows complete freedom of web page design including the the ability to draw shapes. You can position text, graphics and photos anywhere on the page, at any size or angle, overlaid or with transparency and Web Designer will produce a pixel accurate, perfect web page.

Xara Web Designer 6 can do things that are regarded as near impossible with other web-authoring software, such as repel text around irregular shapes and photos and the ability to draw anything from simple shapes to complex company logos and graphics using its advanced vector graphic tools. Xara Web Designer 6 includes automatic optimization of graphics that not only produce optimised resolution images, but automatically detects repeating elements across the website thus producing faster, more optimised websites.

Aimed at graphic designers who do not want to learn HTML or scripting languages, itâ€™s also the perfect â€˜rapid website prototypingâ€™ tool for graphic designers and webmasters. The simplicity of Xara Web Designer means that even the beginner can create professional looking websites with ease.


â€œXara Web Designer 6 provides no programming tools, no script editing and doesnâ€™t even provide an â€˜HTML viewâ€™â€, says Managing Director, Charles Moir, â€œOur design philosophy is this: You donâ€™t need to know the PDF programming language in order to produce PDF files, so neither should you have to know anything about HTML or Javascript in order to create great websites.â€

Xara Web Designer 6 supports CSS layers with advanced features such as full or graduated transparency, mouse-over effects, animated photo pop-ups and more. It creates cross-browser, cross-platform XHTML compatible websites.
