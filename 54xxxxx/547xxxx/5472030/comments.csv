,moodude,2010-07-06T03:13Z,"Well here's my review:

1)Very Fast Torrent(which can change, just saying as of right now it was fast with 15 seeds and 1 leech)
2)Very Good video quality. Hardly any grainy effects or blurry images
3) Sound quality is very good. I don't speak any other language other than English so I'm not sure if the voice acting is perfect.
4)The audio is in Russian(or German, not sure) but the subtitles are in fact ENGLISH!
5)I highly recommend this torrent to everyone! 

6)MOST IMPORTANTLY IT IS VIRUS FREE



Never let this ship sink. SEED MY FRIENDS!"

,Regztem,2012-01-08T04:12Z,"res - 640x360, frame rate - 25, audio - 128 kb/s, 44100 Hz

length - 1h9m42s (1:09:42)

Very good audio, video and translation overall.

As for the movie itself - it was awesome, purely awesome - I can't recall seeing such good piece of work in long time; strong resemblence to Hellboy (in a very, very good way too) - themes like occultism, war, secret agencies & societes. Only thing I can accuse it for - I crave for more !
Seriously, I would love to see it become TV series or perhaps another movie, 'cause it has a lot of potential.
Will definitely buy a DVD copy if I ever come across one.

Worth downloading and seeding.
