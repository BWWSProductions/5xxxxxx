This intimate motion-picture odyssey into the world of dolphins and orcas was shot over several years while Talbot searched above and below the sea for the best light and water conditions.

All of the topside scenes in the film were shot in super slow-motion at speeds up to 300 frames per second revealing exquisite detail impossible to see in real time.

The raw film footage was transferred to a digital format then painstakingly synchronized to the ethereal music of Mannheim Steamroller and Ray Lynch.

 Using no narration, Talbot's vision of taking the viewer into his subject's world is realized in this series of powerful and moving encounters with the most enchanting creatures in the sea.
