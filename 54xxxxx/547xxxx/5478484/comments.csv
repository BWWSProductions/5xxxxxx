,superbay,2010-04-05T10:50Z,I've never downloaded TV series with advertisement on them but apparently this one got one in the early of minute 29. I'm not complaining but it would be nice if only the ad were finished because i haven't ever seen how advertisements in US TV series look like. Nice flash of ad :)
