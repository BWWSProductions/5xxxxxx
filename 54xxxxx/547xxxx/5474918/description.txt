River Deep - Mountain High is a 1966 single by Ike & Tina Turner, considered by producer Phil Spector to be his best work, the single was successful in Europe, peaking at #3 in the United Kingdom, though flopped on its original release in the United States, resulting in Spector withdrawing from the music industry for two years, and beginning his personal decline.

After Eric Burdons version it was re-released in 1969, and has since become one of 
Tina Turner's signature songs.


See You Later, Alligator (though more commonly spelled without the comma in the
title) is the title of an iconic rock and roll song of the 1950s.

The most famous recording of the song, however, was that created on December 12, 1955 by Bill Haley & His Comets at a recording session for Decca Records.

Unlike most of Haleys recordings for Decca, which were created at the Pythian Temple studioin New York City, Alligator and its flip-side, The Paper Boy (On Main Street U.S.A.), was recorded at the Decca Building itself in New York. 

The song was featured in Rock Around the Clock, a musical film Haley and the Cometsbegan shooting in January 1956,Decca records released this disk on February 1, 1956 in both 45 
and 78 formats.

Whole Lotta Shakin Goin On is a song best known in the 1957 rock and roll hit version by Jerry Lee Lewis.

Jerry Lee Lewis had been performing the song in his stage act, and recorded it at his secondrecording session for Sun Records, on May 27, supervised by producer Jack Clement, Lewis radically altered the original, adding a propulsive boogie piano that was complemented by J.M. Van Eatons energetic drumming,


Ray Charles (September 23, 1930 â€“ June 10, 2004) was an American musician. 
Charles was a pioneer in the genre of soul music during the 1950s by fusing rhythm & blues, gospel, and blues styles into his early recordings for Atlantic Records.
He also helped racially integrate country and pop music during the 1960s with his 
crossover success on ABC Records, most notably with his Modern Sounds albums.

During his tenure with ABC, Charles became one of the first African-American 
musicians to be given artistic control by a mainstream record company.


Kim Carnes (born July 20, 1945, Hollywood, California) is an American singer-
songwriter, she is a two-time Grammy Award winner, noted for her distinctive, raspy
vocal style.

Bette Davis Eyes is a song made popular by American singer-songwriter, Kim Carnes.

The song was written in 1974 by Donna Weiss and Jackie DeShannon. DeShannon recorded the song that same year on her album New Arrangement, but it was not until 1981, when Kim Carnes recorded her version of the song, that it became a commercial success.

The Kim Carnes recording of the song spent nine non-consecutive weeks on top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 (interrupted for one week by the Stars on 45 Medley), and over eight million copies of the album on which the song appeared, Mistaken Identity, were sold. The single went on to become the highest seller of the year and won the Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and 
Record of the Year. 
The song was also a number one hit in 31 countries, including Germany, Australia, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Japan, and Brazil, but it achieved more moderate success in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number ten.
