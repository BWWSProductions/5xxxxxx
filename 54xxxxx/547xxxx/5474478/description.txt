With piano-driven songs that tug at your heartstrings, a trendy bar might be the last place you'd think Keane would film a music video. However, in the new clip for 'Stop for a Minute,' the band's first single off of their fourth record, 'Night Train,' Keane frontman Tom Chaplin is found lounging on a posh couch observing the people around him enjoying their drinks as he sings. 

Opening with a quick trip through the streets of London, the video is filmed like a flowing montage of party photos that you'd see in a fashion spread. Chaplin and Somali/Canadian rapper K'Naan, who's featured on this song as well as 'Looking Back,' sing heartfelt and sometimes sad lyrics while everyone else is making the most of their evening.

Taking a different direction on 'Night Train,' which was named after Keane's preferred mode of transportation while on tour, Chaplin hopes to show the band's other side. "I think these tracks show in a completely different light," he said in a statement. 

'Night Train' drops on May 11 while the new single, 'Stop for a Minute,' will release on April 11. Meanwhile, check out the video below...
