,crazybones8585,2010-05-21T07:33Z,"Hi Robston
                I?m having trouble with audio sync on some of these episodes. I have tried to sync the audio with it but it seems that only a couple scenes and not the whole file are out of sync so by fixing these scenes screws up the rest. I was wondering if it was my set up, or if it is the files. I am pointing out a spot I found a sync issue to see if you can help me out. Can you check out S01E09 @ 48 - 52 minutes and tell me if you are having the same problem. This way I can know how to move forward in fixing. Thanks for the help"
[T],Robston,2010-06-02T23:59Z,"Hi Crazy,
I saw a small glitch at the point you mentioned - 48 mins - which does throw the sound out a tad, so I assume this was either a fault with the original uploaded files or with the original HDTV transmission. Don't forget these are HDTV copies not bluray rips, so any faults during broadcast will show up. I think we'll all have to live with the odd error until HBO sort their arses out and release the BD versions.
