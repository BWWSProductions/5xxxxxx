Description...................:	David  hosts  the  show   from  the  famed  Railroad   Museum   of
				Pennsylvania, which boasts  one of the largest  indoor collections
				of railroad equipment in the United States. Our travels begin From
				the North Creek  Depot of the Upper  Hudson River  Railroad in New
				York. Here, Vice  President Theodore  Roosevelt learned  he was to
				become President  after the death  of President William  McKinley.
				This line was built as transportation  to what was hoped to become
				the Central  Park  of  the World  in  the Adirondack   Mountains,
				establishing the first  railroad built solely  to create a tourist
				industry. The  glories of  the East continue  to be featured  from
				aboard the Green Mountain  Flyer through the  Vermont countryside.
				It travels along the banks of the  Connecticut River. This line is
				still a major freight hauler and  passengers regularly see freight
				trains pass by the  historic Bellows  Falls station  as they await
				the daily Amtrak train.
