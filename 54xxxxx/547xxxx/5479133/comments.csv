,lambofgodman,2010-04-03T20:16Z,Thanks for the work you do in putting this stuff for all of us. I truly do appreciate your efforts.
,cyberboyke,2010-04-04T12:53Z,Zo  slechte kwaliteit heb ik nooit gezien dus je bent gewaarschuwt  slechte  kwaliteit deze  ik gaat  nergens  in discussie  dus lul maar lekker  verder

Audio9.5/Video6.3"
,jared1107,2010-04-07T22:05Z,"Thanks for the up, man. Your damn right when you say this is for the hard core titan people that have to dl it right now haha.

I kinda got the jist of the flick, but don't wanna pass an opinion until a decent looking file comes out. It's another cgi heavy flic, so a good cam or dvdrip is whats needed to really enjoy it.

Thanks for the up. You people are fkn awesome, and we appreciate all your efforts to get this stuff out. Later"
,paulefretwell,2010-04-08T08:27Z,"I see a lot of complaints but I missed the part about you went the effort to go to the movie and then download it for those who want to see it now regardless of the cam shots. That"" expected. My name is PAUL FRETWELL and I appreciate the work put into this video. Thanks for the effort."
,tatt00,2010-04-08T22:54Z,"@cyberboyke

Hou je bek met geen discussie over, je zet t bij elke titans torrent als je het niet bevalt dl het niet.

Wat ben je 5 jaar ofzo? Of een Belg?"
,bychance,2010-04-09T06:10Z,Good for a cam. Just don't expect too much. Watchable. Thanks GPB2008.
,shrgr,2010-04-10T19:24Z,"I've only watched about 30 random seconds but i love it already. The A/V's are horrible, but visible and audible. I guess i'm just a sucker for bad quality, must be cos i'm from the audio cassette tape era. Can't help it, it feels so grungy. Many thanks to the uploader and/or filmer for the effort. Keep seeding."
,NobiteR,2010-04-13T01:27Z,"such a bad quality. Bad quality movie and bad sound.Worse than cam rip or TS.

How a disappointment ! "

I mean only this torrent so bad not mean this movie bad . I am lookin' forward to  a better quality."
,pjthunder,2010-06-12T19:12Z,well the screenshots don't come up...that's usually a big indicator of the quality of workmanship regarding the movie itsself..
