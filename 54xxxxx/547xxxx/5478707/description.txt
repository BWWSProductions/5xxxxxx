Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures S01E07: Isolation

After Fitz transports a sick patient from China who later dies, he is stricken with a mysterious respiratory ailment. He's put into isolation, but has already infected Chen who examined him. Ming is in quarantine at home where she starts to reconsider their plans to adopt a child. Carrying the wounds of having never known her own mother, she's not sure it's a prudent thing to do.


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion.
