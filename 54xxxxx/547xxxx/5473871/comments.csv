,asfalterisk,2010-04-22T03:43Z,Video quality is great but the audio breaks up from high volume at time.
,intobearzz,2010-04-23T05:59Z,"it took me a while to get the full BluRay. i used the best converter and the ""AUDIO"" is screwed up. both converting and playing with Divx. Sorry uploader! Maybe u needing to re-upload for us AolOffLine. Thanks anyways. for the down-loaders, be-aware the ""Audio"" is screwed up.

[T],djsforfun,2011-03-15T18:48Z,"weird how these 720p mbluray are not as short as the 720p regular movies...

for example, the madonna 1080p is 8,8 gb and this 720p is 6,6

and for a regular movie a 1080p would be 8,5gb and the 720p would be 4,4 (1 dvdr size).

would be nice to this these 720p music bluray on 1 dvdr size so we could rec them...

btw, thx for the torrent. "
