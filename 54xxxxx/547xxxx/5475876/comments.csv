,ThyFrozenSun,2011-04-10T13:16Z,"Please, someone tell me if these are DVD or TV rips, and the resolution!"
,ThyFrozenSun,2011-04-11T08:42Z,"I'm getting almost 1 Mbps download speed, so I guess this torrent is going to be downloaded in less than 15 hours! Thanks for uploading! :)"
,pjsmoke,2011-07-04T09:43Z,"Sorry, horrible quality. They are encoded with DivX 3 low and based on the quality that means they were encoded with fast settings rather than quality.

Every single Hercules TLJ torrent [including the single season torrents spread around] uses these dvdrips and that's a shame because they are shit...background pixelation and compresison artifacts everywhere.

However, the Xena Warrior Princess DVDrips are good and worth downloading."
,pjsmoke,2011-07-04T19:37Z,"Ah fuck. Forget about the Xena comment as that isn't exactly good quality as well, although it's still better.

It sucks that these DVDrips look worse than tvrips, but free shit is still free shit."
