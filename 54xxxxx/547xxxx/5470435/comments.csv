Try Sony Sound Forge for that purpose. I made a little comparison of your rip of this CD and of mine bought one and here you can see the result: 

A MUST SEE VIDEO ! The most of FLAC coded songs downloaded from web are crippled !!!

I know you're probably gonna hate me for this comment but I can't help it. It's the truth and I'm an audiovisual pro. Sorry."
