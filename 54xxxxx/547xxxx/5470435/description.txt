Judas Priest are a Grammy Award winning English heavy metal band from Birmingham, formed in 1969. Judas Priest's core line-up consists of vocalist Rob Halford, dual lead guitarists Glenn Tipton, and K.K. Downing, and also bassist Ian Hill. The band has gone through several drummers over the years, though Scott Travis has held the position since 1989. They have been cited as an influence on many heavy metal musicians and bands. Their popularity and status as one of the definitive heavy metal bands has earned them the nickname "Metal Gods" from their song of the same name.[2] They have sold over 35 million albums worldwide.
