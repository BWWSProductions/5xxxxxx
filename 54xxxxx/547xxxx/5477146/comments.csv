,psichoate,2011-07-24T01:46Z,"thanks for the cool documentary, but it should not be called 'how to win at chess'
i thought this was going to be opening analysis or endgame positions or something, serves me right for being lazy and wanting a video instead of breaking out the textbooks.
this is chess for people who know how to move the pieces but have never heard of tactics or tournament play"
