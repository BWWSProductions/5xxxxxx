,protongeek,2010-03-31T05:35Z,I love rush but I really get bored listening to Mark Steyn.
,BarrySoetoro,2010-03-31T05:41Z,"Mark Steyn... boring?! 

Maybe some of the British / Canadian analogies are going over your head. That's one of the things I like; he always makes interesting parallels between the UK, Canada, and what America is becoming.

As a British citizen who currently lives in Canada, believe me when I say most of his ""jokes"" are actually the sad reality of the British commonwealth."

,fizdude,2010-03-31T05:53Z,Thanks!! Mark Steyn whoohoo!!
,dnstest,2010-03-31T06:20Z,Viva Steyn!
,booboo332,2010-03-31T06:35Z,"Actually Mr Steyn was born in Toronto and is still a Canadian citizen.  He grew up and went to school in the UK which explains his un-Canadian accent.  He now lives in New Hampshire.  

I always get a kick out of Mark's sense of humor.  His book ""America Alone"" is a must read and very thought provoking.

Thanks to the uploader.

Here's a little article about a Democrat's big mouth getting him into trouble in a way that even ol' ""Plugs"" Biden wouldn't have.  Well . . . probably.
