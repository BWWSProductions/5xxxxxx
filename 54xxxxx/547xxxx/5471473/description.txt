Alex talks with Idaho Republican Rep. Phil Hart [hour 4] about his bill to limit the use of naked body scanners in the state. Hart's bill passed 58-9 earlier this month. Hartâ€™s bill would require the Idaho Department of Homeland Security to prove the scanners arenâ€™t detrimental to health before any machine is allowed to operate in the state.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
