This is a DVD rip of "Over The Top" I made and also embedded and sync'd up the Rifftrax audio with the video.  


If you enjoy the commentary please donate to the Rifftrax guys so they can keep doing what they do.

As far as Stalone goes feel free to pick up Over The Top for 5 bucks at Best Buy if you are feeling generous.
