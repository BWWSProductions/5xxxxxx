Week 7: Hip Hop Nation Challenge and Last Chance Challenge

    * Aired on April 1, 2010

This week on ABDC the crews will compete against each other in two challenges: the Hip Hop Nation Challenge and the Last Chance Challenge. For both challenges, the crews got to collaborate with producer Swizz Beatz.
Challenge #1: Hip Hop Nation Challenge

The remaining 3 crews must display mastery of hip hop styles from around the nation. One crew will then be given the boot halfway through the show. The crews received help from three guest ABDC alumni from past seasons. Each alumnus was assigned to one of the dance styles the crews will be responsible for.


Challenge #2: Last Chance Challenge

The crews will be creating original beats with Swizz Beatz to groove to during their routine for the Last Chance Challenge to show America why they should be crowned the winner. The remaining two crews will then perform their prepared routines before the lines open for the final voting session of the season.
