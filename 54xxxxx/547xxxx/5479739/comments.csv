It says 2 seeders and 133 leechers on this end.  The download speed is pretty good.  I'll seed this for as long as I can (days).

If you like Google Maps, Yahoo Maps, etc, you'll love Streets & Trips.  It's a great program just like those sites except with added features which make it great.  Customizeable, upgradeable, is GPS capable, etc.  A must-download if you ever travel and want a reasonably sized off-line map program on your desktop computer (Laptop especially)."
[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-04-05T17:01Z,"Well, that would be nice, except the most any one leecher has at this moment is 86.6%. So, in the next 30 minutes, you should have your comment. And no where in the torrent did I promise anything except that this is the 2010 version. Regardless, enjoy, seed.

,[kyle],2010-04-06T00:39Z,Hi! I can install but cannot run because I don't know how to register. any hep?
,blombardo,2010-04-25T08:36Z,"Anyone know how to deal with this:  Torrent downloads fine - it is a .001 file (use WinRar) then mount the ISO image - and install...   Upon first load  - it gives this error:   ""The Volume License key could not be installed.  Please try uninstalling and reinstalling the application.""

Anyone get this installed successfully? how did you do it? -- Windows 7 64bit."
,cibersatan,2010-04-26T02:00Z,Got the VLK error too on Vista Ultimate
,vix2000,2010-04-26T03:27Z,Also getting VLK error. Any ideas?
,vix2000,2010-04-26T04:03Z,"Have I missed a step, or do I need to uninstall and reinstall as it says? I have been looking through all the files to see if I've missed something, but can't see anything. Thanks. (downloaded unzipped and installed perfectly btw, thanks)"
,blombardo,2010-04-27T21:32Z,"I've tried MANY versions (over 10) of Streets and trips on my new laptop - windows 7 64 bit - they have ALL failed to work (even some known good copies that I've used on other OS's...)

I found a working 2009 version on another torrent site; I wish I knew how to properly add it to thePiratebay - if anyone knows how post a link in comments.  - as in how to add a torrent that exists on other sites but is not listed here..."
,blombardo,2010-04-27T21:33Z,"
Google for this:
""Microsoft Streets And Trips 2009 (Already Patched)""
I cant seem to post a link here - 'database error' keeps appearing.


Google for this:
""Microsoft Streets And Trips 2009 (Already Patched)""


The file is available on many places - like torrentreactor"
,blombardo,2010-04-28T03:45Z,For those who want to 'fix' the problem - the fix requires 1 on 1 interaction with a Microsoft agent - they will use the 'Easy Assist' to give you a file called 'ResetTool' (with the date included at the end) - the file seems to be valid for one week only.  more info here:        http://www.laptopgpsworld.com/microsoft-streets-trips/938-streets-trips-2009-licensing-initialization-error-2.html
,vix2000,2010-04-30T03:57Z,Any news on making this torrent work?????????
,casemods,2010-05-09T21:02Z,"I get the volume licensing kit error.

Don't download this unless you lost your CD/DVD"
,jake48001,2010-05-22T06:41Z,"Hello I just tried to install and it gave me this error ""The Volume License key could not be installed.""  Does anyone know how to fix it?"
,sysmark1,2010-05-25T19:08Z,eventhorizon: when are you going to upload the corp copy?
,kustok,2010-05-31T10:16Z,"Hold on, is it pre-activated or just a digital copy requiring a key?"
,kustok,2010-05-31T20:41Z,"Doesn't work, same problem with volume licensing."
,volvo06,2010-08-17T05:35Z,Does anyone know if this would work if installed over top of a working copy of 2009?  My 2009 copy from Pirate Bay last year was pre-cracked and did not require any key or anything
,bluedognv,2010-08-20T06:07Z,"This torrent is useless - can't be activated even when installed over top of a legit, working copy of Streets & Trips 2009. 

As for calling MS to get the ""Reset Tool"" - somehow I don't think that's going to work - not really willing to try it. The article referred to is talking about 2009."
,FitchleyHornbuckle,2010-08-22T06:14Z,"Dosen't this Jugz, respond to any of the comments posted? I think this is all just a waste of time."
,11western,2011-02-10T02:46Z,"Think I'll upload mine, it's 2008 but also has gps and all that stuff. Unless your looking for a new street all the older copy's work fine.
I'm a truck driver and have used 2008 all over the country for a while now.
All I've got to do is find my copy...lol and I'll post a key."
,de173,2011-03-06T02:25Z,"After installation, i had to goto the 
c:\program files x86\ microsoft streets and trips 2010 then right click on 'Streets.exe', then 'Send to Desktop'
Then, I had to right click on the desktop icon, then goto properties, then to Compatibility, then put a check mark in the box 'Run as Administrator'.

Runs fine and dandy now. VL though.

,mylarkee,2011-07-07T01:23Z,"Like many here have said there seemsto be no way to use this without a key. De173's idea does not work either, I am using Win 7 so his OS must be different. Until someone gives a hint of how to activate this or furnishes a key, it's useless."
