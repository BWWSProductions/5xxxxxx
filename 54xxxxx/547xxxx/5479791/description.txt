You want to play again to those old good CPC Amstrad games? Here they are, with many maps, cheats codes, screenshots, etc...

You don't know how to play CPC Games? You don't remember the old good commands:

CAT
Run"Commando.Bas"
cls
print
|cpm
etc...

;) ;)


Do not worry, select the game you want to play in the list, double click on it, a pop up appears, click "Run" and there you go.
