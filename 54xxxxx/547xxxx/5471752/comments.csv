,souptyrant,2010-03-31T22:32Z,"Thanks for the upload, its hard to find this on torrent sites.
For everyone else, I'm no expert, but the quality is decent, and a scan with my basic virus/malware stuff didn't turn up anything."
,souptyrant,2010-03-31T22:52Z,"Actually, this may be unrelated, but about 5 minutes after download and playing the files i got about 10 virus warnings. So dunno, someone should verify this."

I don't think they have an MP3 Virus so IMO it's clean.
Thanks :D"
,hsusgusu,2010-04-12T03:34Z,BTW you can get both albums for free at their website
,gti-r,2010-04-14T06:25Z,"@hsusgusu    ya I really doubt there's a virus in mp3 (can that exist??). 
Also, nice to know that they have it up for download too. A lot of people must not know though, my ratio is over 100 right now and still going. "
