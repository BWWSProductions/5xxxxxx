Marvel Spotlight is the name of several comic book anthology series published by Marvel Comics. The first series ran for 33 issues from November 1971 to April 1977. The second series ran for eleven issues from July 1979 to March 1981.

Many Marvel Comics characters that were later given their own individual titles first appeared in the first Marvel Spotlight series, including Ghost Rider, Spider-Woman, Werewolf by Night, and the Son of Satan.

In December 2005, The Marvel Spotlight title was used for a series of comic book-sized magazines featuring profiles of and interviews with Marvel creators (usually one writer and one artist each issue) or spotlighting special Marvel projects and events such as Stephen King's The Dark Tower and the Secret Invasion cross-over.
