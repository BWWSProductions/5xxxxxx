,stev666,2010-03-31T13:25Z,Thank you my friend you are a ledgend. Another +1 from me and they will keep comming
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-31T15:29Z,"@beckinsale: Yeah, it was done yesterday, when you asked and took 'bout 3 seconds.
Anyhow, next time would be polite from you to answer back within few hours, not the next day.

@Stev: Thanks. I plan to."
,D3vo666,2010-03-31T18:34Z,Thank you m8
,Kaovar,2010-03-31T19:58Z,"Thanks 20-40, looking forward to watching this later."
,cpsgirl,2010-03-31T20:41Z,Thanks for all the great stuff you bring us...does your new schedule mean you are no longer doing Justified?  Can I bribe you with homemade brownies or chocolate chip cookies?  Bribes aren't the same as requests:)
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-31T20:55Z,"@cpsgirl: It sound delicious, any of the things you've mentioned. This morning I was >so< close to do Justified 'cause of missing (late) XviDs for first two eps. Then I saw that both 720p and XviD went public and I backed off... so - IF in the future Scene misses again - you know where to look for... I cannot do better than that."
,cpsgirl,2010-04-01T03:16Z,"Well, I still feel you deserve treats for all the stuff you make available:)  I don't really want to post my email on here to get a mailing address to send you anything...is there a private message setup on Pirate Bay?  I haven't really looked into it.  If not, accept some virtual brownies with many thanks:)"
