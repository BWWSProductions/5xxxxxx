[T],mikemelo1369,2010-03-30T01:17Z,Dude I love your torrents. AMAZING. I'm glad you're associated with djfred:) Keep all these AMAZING movies coming. I personally love these old ones. I usually upload at least 500GB for each of freds and jsn's torrents. I have been doing the same for the ones you have put up:) Any chance we could also be seeing Major League 2 and even possibly 3? Once again thank you so much for the amazing quailty movie.
[T],ctang,2010-03-30T04:59Z,"@mikemelo1369: as soon as i have this one completely uploaded i will be uploading ML2 (couple days) but unfortunately i dont own ML3...i actually havent ever watched it, which is odd since 1&2 are pretty close to the top of the list as my 2 favorite movies of all time...i am a lifelong Cleveland Indians fan...some of my earliest memories are of the games with my dad"
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-03-30T15:23Z,Thats fantastic:) Yeah number 3 has a bit of a different cast line up but it's still fairly solid:P I am looking forward to have number 2 as well:) Keep up the great work my friend:)
[T],ctang,2010-03-30T17:54Z,no problem
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-01T23:56Z,Hey bro I got the upload on control. Already uploaded 148 GB. You should definately put #2 up when you get a chance:P
[T],ctang,2010-04-02T04:21Z,will very soon...thanks for the help on uploading because i can only upload at around 70kB/s or so
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-02T20:52Z,Hey no worries dude. I upload at anywhere from 1Mbps - 5Mbps depending on how much people are downloading. I once uploaded the Xmen origins from Djfred at 9.4Mbps lol. I had to screen shot that one lol.
[T],ctang,2010-04-03T23:15Z,must be nice...where im at now is max up speed at 65kB/s...lucky me
