,SolomangrunD,2010-04-02T06:49Z,Another great upload! Just waiting for siege and war! Thank you for your time Juan.
[T],Juan.Too,2010-04-04T07:23Z,"So, Juan.Too's official Blackest Night reading order is now up.
Reading orders always take me a lot longer than I think they will.

How I decided what went where: Toward the beginning I primarily used the black lantern rings power levels (2%, 57%, etc.) to put the issues in order.  After issue 4 of Blackest Night I had to rely on character appearances (or character attribute appearances), lines or scenarios repeated in more than one issue, and stuff like that.  Of course, some of the placement is arbitrary - there's no real reason to put Flash 002-003 after Wonder Woman 002-003 or even after Green Arrow 030, but something had to go first and I chose what I thought would carry the story along in the best/most readable way.

Anyway, if you use my reading order and notice something wrong or even just something you think would work better another way, just post here and tell me and I'll look into it."
,BlackLaval,2010-04-06T05:07Z,"Thanks a lot, Juan, this series was really awesome. I'm sure to buy it when it is published in my country.
EAGERLY awaiting for Siege - March."
,micomiciano,2010-04-06T11:42Z,"Hi Juan! Thanks for uploading this! would you mind if I requested for a torrent that singles out Blackest night titles for march? i've downloaded pretty much all of your previous uploads. 

thanks! "

[T],Juan.Too,2010-04-09T04:06Z,"OK guys, Siege - March is up.
Get it here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5487082/Siege_-_March

Sorry it took so long.  Had a lot going on with work.
Also, I needed a small break after all the effort that went into this Blackest Night torrent/reading list - was a little sick of comics for a few days (hard to believe, I know)."
,n00bsterrr,2010-04-11T17:53Z,"If I downloaded all of the Blackest Night torrents you ""Juan.Too"" uploaded, then I don't need to get this right?

Thanks!

and thanks for uploading everything!"
