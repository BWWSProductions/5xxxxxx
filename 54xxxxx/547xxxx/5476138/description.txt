Comabt Records, put out this video recording of the show held in New York,at the legendary Discoteche,Studio 54,headlined by Venom, with openers, Slayer and Exodus.Dubbed the Combat Tour 1985, those hallowed halls were forever tarnished that night as the bands put on a blazing show, making it clear that they were out to denigrate and put to bed forever, that abomination of the 70's,at least in their minds and the fans,that night anyway.
