Here you guys go! A lot of great releases this month... 120 Tracks to tide you over til' May.  Hope you guys enjoy it. I recently added a feature to BIRP now that allows you guys to rate your favorite tracks from each playlist. If you go to the download page for each month you'll see that you can rate each song.  Be sure to come back and rate your favorites! This will help significantly at the end of the year when it comes to putting together the best of 2010 playlist.

Started back up the Mix CD trade except this time everyone had the chance to sign up and I paired everyone together.  If you signed up go to www.blalocksirp.com/forum to see who you are paired with.  If you didn't sign up and would like to take part look out for the May Cd Trade Sign-ups. 

Also, I have new merch up for sale. A huge Thanks goes out to noxmortis for the giving tree design.  If you enjoy the lists and feel like supporting BIRP! be sure to head over to the merch store at www.BlalocksIRP.com/merch

That's all! Huge thanks goes out to Whipple, Rebjukebox, Lonerider06, outroversion [.] wordpress [.] com, droenn, and many others!
