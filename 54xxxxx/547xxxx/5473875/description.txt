This is the Legenadary Radio Clash of David Rodigan against Barry G from 1985. The officer of the halfway tree police station drops coin in the beginning to get known who has to start.
It is in three parts in good listenable quality.
A lot of sleng teng riddim, which was brand new at this clash!

Enjoy and Seed
