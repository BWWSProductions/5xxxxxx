Live Mission album from when they were still touring as the 'Sisterhood'. recorded in Holand (don't have access to the original as its at home in my folks loft so can't give full details or make a copy of the cover art. Can't find details on the web) The track names are listed as they were given on the album with the proper titles in brackets. Quality is poor and is probably only of interest to collectors. OBie
