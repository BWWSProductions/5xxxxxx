,madtown4,2010-03-30T06:30Z,@demonicjack i think there are no more [req]. 
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-30T07:47Z,"@madtown: You are right - but I wait for Heavy probably 'cause of Shannyn Sossamon.
For sure I'll encode one soon as the movie comes out."
,demonicjack,2010-03-30T08:25Z,"Thanks 2040...thats the same reason im waiting to watch the movie, cos of Shannyn :D

[V],twentyforty,2010-03-30T08:58Z,"There is no need to force-feed me.
I have been informed about release dates a month ago.
I CAN DOWNLOAD ONE of files you pointed out two days ago. But, I have second thoughts. I PREFER sources I trust. I know little more than you, about Scene, about groups, about my needs for encodings I produce.
1st) I said I'll do it, right?
2nd) I need to download several GIGABYTES as input. When I've said ""when one comes out"" I meant ""when I can get BluRay copy or rip from sources I trust"". ""Get"" include ""to have on my disk"".
None from your list qualifies... BUT, hour ago I start to download a BluRay rip from other ""source"", it is 2200 MB - so please, be patient. Besides, TV shows and Schedule have priority.
This night CET, if source turned out to be fine, I would up the torrent. I can't do it sooner."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-30T13:14Z,"Sorry d.j... I am cranky last few days. I am so sorry but in last few days I was called ""motherfucker"", called out numerous times, shit has been thrown at me, all sorts and from all directions. I AM fed-up, so excuse my atypical reaction and too much ""I did that"" ""I know this"" and similar crap."
,demonicjack,2010-03-30T15:30Z,"No probs :D!!!!!!
