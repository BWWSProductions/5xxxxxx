Windows 7 Activator RemoveWAT v2.2.5.2 by Hazar


This is the latest version downloaded from Hazar's Forum. All credits go to him...


Hazar's comment:


WORKS ON ALL EDITIONS OF 7/R2!

NOT FOR VISTA/ORIGINAL SERVER 2008!!!!

IMPROVEMENTS SINCE 1.0:
renames slmgr on x64 aswell
Works on unicode systems
silent mode with /s switch
UI tweaked slightly
No reboot
neccessary
Passes WGA on X64


This is a little tool I put together to remove WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) completely from the OS, whilst still retaining genuine status and receiving all updates (optional aswell). You can also pass the genuine check in things like Windows Defender.
There will be no windows activation section in control panel (thanks to nononsence)

no slmgr

no nags, no prompts, nothing. WAT gone.



IMPORTANT NOTES/INSTRUCTIONS IN ARCHIVE!


In theory this should have a 100% success rate on all machines.

/s switch is for silent mode

SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal 
http://virusscan.jotti.org/ 
http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at: 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
