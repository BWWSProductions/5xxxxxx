If you want to run it from a script and want to keep it silent just write ""removewat /s"" as the command to launch it."

This proggie gets detected as a HackTool:Win32/Wpakill program. What do you expect from a hack program made to override WPA? That's what it effectively is, a Hack Tool and a WPA killer. You don't think that M$ will consider a danger (for themselves) a program that activates W7 without buying a legal license, and ask to AVs maker to show it this way? It's like being amazed that AVG detects as dangerous AVG Keygens, try to understand why..."

Today was my last day so I turned to one of my most trusted sources for quick-fixes, Pirate Bay.

It's not ""doing"" anything but it's just that message appears and i dunno if it's gonna do something?

When I click my computer > properties it shows a product key but above that it says ""You must activate today. Click here to activate windows now"". 

I am a little bit scared since I am new to this stuff, am I going to be okay? My friends tell me don't worry but I would like an opinion from here..."
,azervayne,2010-10-04T11:36Z,"ATTN! MPAA and ALL OTHERS WHO ARE ""NOT GENUINE"" AFTER USING THIS UPDATE:

This update will work for a while, but after update KB2158563, as MPAA pointed out, Windows caught on and broke this method. Here's how to get your copy genuine again:

Download this torrent and reinstall WAT (The exe within has that option, thankfully. Credit to author for allowing us the option to restore WAT. Restoring WAT *IS* necessary because the alternate way to activate windows tricks WAT rather than removing it.) or rerun it if you didn't delete the files from this torrent

Restore WAT (as i said above, just remind ya...)

Program will reboot your computer

Download this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5541849/Windows_7_Loader_v1.7.9_%5B_Windows_7_Activation_For_all_versions_ *

*If for some reason the above link broke, Google for the following to find it: ""Windows 7 Loader v1.7.9 thepiratebay""'

Run the exe within that torrent

The program will minimize to background immediately then a few seconds later ask you to restart your computer (this is normal, btw)

Upon boot windows will stay say it is not genuine with the pop up prompt, but you will notice that the ""This copy of Windows is not genuine"" in the corner is gone - this is your (and was my) first hint that this worked for you

Go to the Windows 7 start menu search bar and type in activate windows and you should see the program for Windows activation come up (it's named ""Activate Windows"" hehe) then click it.

It should say ""Activation was succesful""

Reboot your computer

Enjoy your ""discount"" copy of 7"

Before the removal of WAT, there's a prompt that pops up every time I boot my PC that states that I have a fake Windows7. The watermark is at the bottom right corner, reminding me that it's fake.

After the removal of WAT, the prompt is no longer there, but the watermark at the bottom right is still present.

Tried it on this computer. This one DID have Microsoft Security Essentials. After running the program and restarting, MSE said that Windows did not pass genuine validation, and MSE will be disabled within 30 days if this is not fixed.
Moral of the story: don't run RemoveWAT if you have MSE installed."

Still having issues with Microsoft Security Essentials saying that my stuff still isn't valid. Any ideas on this?"

I just installed this, it literally took 5 secs then a reboot, and yahoo no more pop ups, thank you very much and keep up the very good work."
