Hereâ€™s a cam from Toxic, combining Elektrikaâ€™ s video and Luâ€™s English audio.

Plot: From the studio that brought you â€œShrek,â€ â€œMadagascarâ€ and â€œKung Fu Pandaâ€ comes â€œHow to Train Your Dragon.â€ Set in the mythical world of burly Vikings and wild dragons, and based on the book by Cressida Cowell, the action comedy tells the story of Hiccup, a Viking teenager who doesnâ€™t exactly fit in with his tribeâ€™s longstanding tradition of heroic dragon slayers. Hiccupâ€™s world is turned upside down when he encounters a dragon that challenges he and his fellow Vikings to see the world from an entirely different point of view.
