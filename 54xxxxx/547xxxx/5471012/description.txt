We Can't Coexist Peacefully!
Either We Suffer....Or The Criminals Suffer.

The "innocent" people who can't cope with the problems of modern society are inadvertently allowing tremendous corruption, suffering, and wars. 
We have to push aside the TALKING MONKEY, put more advanced humans in control of the world, and then remove the people who are destructive.

Nobody wants to exile or kill people, but allowing destructive people to live among us is allowing them to kill, rape, and abuse us. We can't fix their problems with jail or fines. We have to decide who is going to suffer. If we exile or kill the destructive people, then they will do the suffering, but if we let them live among us, then we become their victims, and we do the suffering.


We Can Make The World Safe And Peaceful...     ...Or Allow The Abuse To Continue.

The sheeple - regardless of their race, education, or intelligence - will eat whatever the Zionist feed them. When we explain to the sheeple that the Zionist are taking advantage of them by staging the 9/11 attack, by lying about the Holocaust, by taking over the banking system, etc., they ignore or insult us! They don't care that they're abused.
