,clayton42,2011-03-20T16:02Z,"to get the game running you need 5 missing .dlls
go to http://www.tanksimzw.com/dl.htm and install first file.
Also check out http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showthread.php?t=180619 for improvements. So install game. add Dlls then install MMP mod. The game in single player is better and Multiplayer is been fixed soon"
