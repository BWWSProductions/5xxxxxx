Read my request again before commenting."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-02T14:06Z,"@mattbdon: Actually, it was my intention and I have searched last week for 720p. And... nothing can be found. I'll try to re-encode XviD I have, but very often it turns bad or too low in quality. I just hope that tomorrow BiA or FoV will release a 720p... otherwise A2A would be on shaky ground."
