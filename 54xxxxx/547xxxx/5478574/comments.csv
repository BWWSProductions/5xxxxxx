,DogMan12,2010-04-03T12:51Z,thanks for the up.
,cbarnardo,2010-04-03T13:55Z,"The quality of this ""[micro]"" is very good. I only hope its the whole thing :)."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-03T14:00Z,"@cbarnardo: Today is April 3rd, not 1st... You are first-timer, right?"
,MrEvolution,2010-04-03T15:01Z,Thx man.
,cbarnardo,2010-04-03T15:08Z,Apparently so though the other 2 torrents I got  of this this would disagree about the April 1st part. The thing I am wondering now is why were the other one's @540mb+. The quality of this was great. Hi-res @1.4gb make sense but alas now the 540's confused me.
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-03T15:38Z,"@cbarnardo: Unfortunately ""fakes"" all around, not just for ""Spartacus"".
On TPB it's easy: can you see that ""pink skull"" next to my screen-name? It is sign for ""Trusted uploader"". That title must be earned. Load torrents uploaded from such members. Nobody of Pink Skulls wont upload a fake."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-03T15:48Z,"LOL... -1 on Quality and on Spartacus again.

Some Spartacus fan is, unfortunately, mad about non-GB encodes...

BTW, I KNOW how good [micro] is, same goes for at least 600000 other people who have downloaded True Blood, Weeds, Burn Notice, OTH, The Big Bang T. as [micro] and SAVED terabytes of their own money through reduced bandwidth. I am here, on TPB maybe five months. Before I was someplace else."
