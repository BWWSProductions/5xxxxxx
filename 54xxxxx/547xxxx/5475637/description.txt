Java for Web with Servlets, JSP and EJB is the one book you need to master Java web programming. It covers all the technologies needed to program web applications in Java using Servlets 2.3, JSP 1.2, EJB 2.0 and client-side programming with Javascript. These technologies are explained in the context of real-world projects, such as an e-commerce application, a document management program, file upload and programmable file download, and an XML-based online book project. 

In addition to excellent content, this book includes licenses to two Java web components from BrainySoftware.com. You receive a full license of the Programmable File Download component for commercial and non-commercial deployment. You are also granted to a license to deploy the author's popular File Upload bean for non-commercial use, which has been licensed by the Fortune 500 company Commerce One and purchased by major corporations such as Saudi Business Machine, Ltd. and Baxter Healthcare Corporation.
