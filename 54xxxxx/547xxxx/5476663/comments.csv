,coder42,2010-04-03T05:22Z,Does not work with newest version of k-lite codec pack or newest version of VLC player. If its not fake then its just fail codec..
,skyflat,2010-04-03T08:53Z,It works with the k-lite codec pack and vlc and also on BSplayer. Thanx for the upload eztv!
,coder42,2010-04-04T04:49Z,"I downloaded newest version of k-lite codec FULL (2.8.3) and reinstalled.

I downloaded newest version of VLC player.

I have BSPlayer.

I can play EVERY other codec/format/movie out there except these new FQM releases.

It still does not work. 

It. Wont. Play."
,coder42,2010-04-04T04:57Z,"So i finally figured out why i couldnt play this file. It is a protected codec license you need to obtain ""free"" via media players license system.

The group have added their own link ""3090_movies"" as affiliate to the codec so they will earn money on it. Dont download this piece of shit."
