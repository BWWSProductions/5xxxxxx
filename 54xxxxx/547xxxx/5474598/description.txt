[umunu] From The Bunker 11_25_06 Zionism_ en.MP3

Thomas "Dire Wolf" on his radio show From the Bunker  that airs on the Revere Radio Network every Saturday at 10:00 PM EST. Mainly we do off the cuff type of discussions where a foundation topic is used as a starting point from which we branch off into its many connections, offshoots, and back alleys. Sometimes you will hear Thomas and I discussing issues solely and other times it is a round table situation where a handful of people will be taking part.

The great thing about From the Bunker is its informal format and spaciousness of head room to speak freely as it being a reflection of the open-mindedness of the host. It is also a great forum where the listeners may participate as well and take part on the show over Skype. If interested you can contact Thomas "Dire Wolf" through Skype with his user name, "direwolf420" to find out more information about doing so.
