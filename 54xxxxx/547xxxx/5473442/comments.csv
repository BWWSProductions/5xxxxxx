,ExhamPriory,2010-03-31T19:45Z,This is not a 2010 release. Why would you label it as such? Thanks for the upload of course but I don't get why you would want to post is as a 2010 release to make it seem like Eclipse? Why? To impress who exactly??
[T],raidy,2010-04-01T02:13Z,"We dated the folders based on our release date, not when the movie originally came out in theatures. As this has resulted in unnecessary confusion we will be naming them the previous way. We didn't intend to confuse or impress? anyone by doing this. Sorry for any inconveniences or misunderstanding caused by us."
