 After Bella recovers from the vampire attack that almost claimed her life,   
 she looks to celebrate her birthday with Edward and his family. However, a   
 minor accident during the festivities results in Bella's blood being shed,   
 a sight that proves too intense for the Cullens, who decide to leave the     
 town of Forks, Washington for Bella and Edward's sake. Initially             
 heartbroken, Bella finds a form of comfort in reckless living, as well as    
 an even-closer friendship with Jacob Black. Danger in different forms awaits.

Happy Hacker Industries 

Is an Audio/Video ripping group founded several years ago
by a few individuals who do nothing but deal with computers
on a yearly 24/7 schedule; and sometimes when sleeping. 

We release things as we find the time to do so, we do not 
release items necessarily as they come out in the stores.
We take pride in our releases and do monitor various outlets
where our work can be acquired.
