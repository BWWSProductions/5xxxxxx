     Set against the backdrop of Melbournes late 70s punk rock scene, Dogs in 
     Space chronicles life in a chaotic, squalid share-house. Hippies, addicts, 
     students and radicals fill their days and nights with sex, drugs, parties 
     and television. Writer/director Richard Lowenstein balances a series of 
     chaotic vignettes with the central story of the romance between housemates 
     Sam (Michael Hutchence), the lead singer of the band, Dogs in Space and 
     his lover Anna (Saskia Post) as it spirals out of control.

     Hutchence is a brilliant symbol of reckless youth in this, his first 
     dramatic screen role, giving Dogs in Space instant cult status upon its release.
