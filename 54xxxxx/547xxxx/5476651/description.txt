[b]TVO Allan Gregg in Conversation, March 19, 2010: Chris Hedges on 'Empire of Illusion'[/b]

A quote by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Chris Hedges opens this year's Oscar-winning film, [url=http://www.thehurtlocker-movie.com/]The Hurt Locker[/url] -- "The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug." It's from his bestseller [url=http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400034635]War is a Force That Gives Us Meaning[/url]. In his latest book, [url=http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307398468]Empire of Illusion[/url], Hedges laments the rise of a culture that craves fantasy and illusion, too distracted to confront society's real problems.
