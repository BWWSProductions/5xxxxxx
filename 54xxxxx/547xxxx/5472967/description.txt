This pack doesn't contain the game itself but  game laucher+maps+Replays

The laucher is made by Vernam7 from darkblizz
(only Laucher that allows you to watch your own replays vs AI if the game was played using this launcher)
(Sadly you can't watch you previous  replays vs AI if you didn't use this launcher to start the game)

How to play

1)Install starcraft 2 beta(at any location) and update to latest patch

2)Install sc2allin1 laucher in default location only

3)Place the AI  folder in starcraft 2 beta folder where you installed your game

4)Place the cache folder in C:UsersUSER_NAMEAppDataLocalBlizzard EntertainmentBattle.netCache and yes to replace all files
Maps are loacated in cache folder i.e in CacheDownload

5)If you wanna watch  replays
Place the replay files in C:Documents and SettingsrajeevMy DocumentsStarCraft II BetaReplaysMultiplayer or C:Documents and SettingsrajeevMy DocumentsStarCraft II BetaReplaysSkirmish
and copy the original base.sc2data file from ai folder and place it in StarCraft II Beta(where you installed your game)ModsLiberty.SC2Mod and click yes to replace file.
P.S. You are only able to watch the replays of your games vs the AI if you have loaded the correct AI-Script. Meaning if you want to watch a replay from a match between you and a 6.1 AI you have to select the 6.1 AI script, start a game, exit the game and then select the replay you wish to watch. So if you update to a newer version of the A.I-script and want to watch an old replay you HAVE to load the old A.I-script first.  
After new patch is released replays won't work untill you download the latest cache file

6)Difficulty can be changed using laucher itself but some times it won't change so you need to do it manually ke you did in previous step
P.S I recommend you to play strategy 0.22 ai as it will truely test your skills

7)Enjoy playing starcraft 2 aand if you wanna watch some starcraft 2 videos with commentary I recommend to subscribe to the following channelsfavourite)
