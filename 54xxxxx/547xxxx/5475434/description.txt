Audio CD November 4, 1992

Format:Mp3@320



Some of the atomic energy that Little Richard emitted nightly during the mid-'50s must have spilled onto Grady Gaines. As the hardy tenor sax blaster with Richard's road band, the Upsetters, Gaines all but blew the reed out of his horn with his galvanic solos. He wails with the same unquenchable spirit today. In Horn Of Plenty Gaines is surrounded by more vocal talent this time -- Carol Fran, Teddy Reynolds, and Gaines's Texas Upsetters pals Big Robert Smith and Paul David Roberts. Hollimon and Anson Funderburgh are the guitar heroes this time, as Gaines whips up another Lone Star-size sax storm with his lusty tenor.
