Are you watching this on your cellphone or something?"
[T],teslaman,2010-03-31T16:16Z,"Lol, the sad thing is that you aren't joking. Search for ""Lost s06e10 eztv"" and compare those seeds/leechers between the 350mb rip and the 1gb rip........yep, 720p is still in the minority. doh! Fact is the 350mb rips suck for the majority of us, why shouldn't we have a nice quality 480p res rip? But the real question is, why do you even care? Did I offend your precious 720p rip? LOL."
,noob2TPB,2010-04-01T08:40Z,"Yeah, it is pretty sad that afkuser is serious. Anyway, I really appreciate your work teslaman. I watch it on my 360. Keep it up. 

Cheers!"
