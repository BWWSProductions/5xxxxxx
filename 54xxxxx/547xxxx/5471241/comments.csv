,r3vo_lt,2010-03-29T22:26Z,Do they just have the 4th hour on certain days?
,joeshmuck,2010-03-29T22:44Z,"Hey Q, did they put anything up on eXtreme on the Saturday ""American Revival"" ?"

Since they are on vacation there isn't going to be a 4th hour this week =(

@joe
There isn't anything up as of yet for ""American Revival"". If anything pops up I'll be sure to post it up and let you know.

I had no idea he was going on vacation either...did I just miss that or are other people in that boat with me? (not that any of us can do anything about it mind you lol)"
,saturn.uc,2010-03-30T00:53Z,I think he mentioned it once on Thursday and then the guys talked about it on Friday in the 4th hour.
,tomc100,2010-03-30T04:14Z,"It's strange that Beck, Rush, and Levin are all missing this week."
,joeshmuck,2010-03-30T04:44Z,"Kewl.
Nah, I never heard Glenn mention it.
I did hear Pat and Stu mention it on the 4th hour on Friday.
I bet almost every none Insider was unaware."
,Mhockey1505,2010-03-30T05:35Z,"i'm pretty sure that he did on thursday of last week -i think he said something like ""i forgot to tell you until now, and don't want people to start spreading rumors that they fired me"""
,TedKennedy,2010-03-30T16:04Z,man i wish they were doing the 4th hour this week. and im gonna miss glenn but oh well pags is okay.
