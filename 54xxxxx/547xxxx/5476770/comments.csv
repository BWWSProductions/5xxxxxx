Left a comment but it didn't appear!?
Thanks for the up
Any hints on replacing all the host ID entries quickly/easily with Notepad+++ 
Thanks"
,NeverLegal,2010-04-26T20:10Z,"still not sure why people haven't commented.

@buccago
if you click edit at the top of notepad and select replace you can then select ""replace all"" to get them all switched at once.

btw... still haven't gotten it to install correctly.  Starts up n shuts down immediately.

,chsimon,2010-05-08T20:31Z,"First of all, thanks for the upload, but I have the same problems, can't start it correctly. I always have license issues. Also the crack doesn't seem to work, or maybe it's just me ... anyone can help?

Sorry about the extremely late reply.

,calebmcd,2010-07-30T06:41Z,"this does work, the instructions and crack files are in the iso in the directory; \lic_gen\wf5_f000\WF5_Win64_crk.rar.
follow the instructions to the t and ul be fine. few notes,install all the features in the install u can leave out the unnecessary languages, make sure u do the cracks properly. the mech directory is in the ptc proengineer directory, and if you open eack of the 4 cracks they tell u where to put the files and runn from that directory, MAKE  SURE U KEEP CLICKING NEXT AND CONTINUE TILL IT IS DONE. each crack does multiple things and you need to keep going till the end. good luck"

I was wondering for the guys that were working did you all do a 1 time install? or part by part for example pro/e then pro/mech?
some of the replacement from crack i had to do search to find it's location of the files

also in the license.dat file it seems to be for 4.0 or that doesnt matter? 
Some Help will be greatly appriciated!
Thanks in advance"

,tropinone,2010-11-02T15:49Z,I'm not normally one to complain about this sorta thing... but the crack instructions are in the Cyrillic alphabet. Could someone please type out the instructions to the crack.

,dorkpunk,2010-12-27T22:09Z,"thx for the upload
noticed so people having problems with the crack files. for future reference the crack files need to be run as administrator. just copy paste the crack file right click"
,gmanchu,2011-01-26T20:37Z,"This file works like a charm. Follow the instructions carefully. I was not able to edit the license at first in my super-duper WIN 7 wordpad, it kept saying ""i was not authorized to modify this lic file"",  then used an older computer with wordpad to edit and save, (by the way, let me save y'all a ton of time: open the license.DAT file, click edit, replace text, enter the 12-zero sequence user id in the ""find what"" line and then enter YOUR computer id in the ""replace with"" line and hit ""replace all"" , then just save file) then copy lic file back onto subject computer's folder. and finish installation. When you copy/paste .crk files onto files indicated by instructions IN .RAR file, right-click file just pasted and ""run-as-administrator"", then follow the NEXT-OK sequence indicated in instructions. IF you get the ""FILE NOT FOUND"" message, write down the name of the file, go back to the entire folder page and look it up on on the 'FIND FILE"" option, then go to that folder, paste the crk file there and run the drill again. files might just be in a different folder, but they will be there IF you installed ALL the required files in the setup wizard. DO NOT Forget to run an antvirus scan of the DECOMPRESSED files before you try anything else. If you can't install  this deal and get it to run after executing BLACKTROY's instructions and this little tutorial, then you have problems. THANK YOU, BLACKTROY!!"

,hottotrott,2011-02-16T21:43Z,"Help Please . . . Thank You.

So I followed the instructions.  During the installation process the licenses are noticed after making the changes to the License.dat.  I start to have issues when I insert the crack files into the appropriate directory.  Once I run the crack (aka patch) applications I recieve an error stating the following: ""File not found or file access error!""  I do not understand why this us occuring because the target file is there.  

Can someone provide me the solution to this.  Thank you."

,hottotrott,2011-02-16T23:07Z,Okay I must have done something wrong when I first installed it.  This download does work.  Well at least I can get it to open.  I don't think my lap top mouse works with this.  It seems I need a three button mouse.  But so far so good for now.  I had to uninstall and reinstall.  Instead of copying and pasting I dragged the crack files to the appropriate locations.  Definitely read the comments if you have issues.  One of the patchs you have to browse for during the patch installation the file is in bin32 I think it is the mech.exe file.  When you get to that point just direct the crack app to where the mech file is located.
,ally.st1,2011-02-19T22:26Z,"Blacktroy, it still doesnt work. Even after changing the stuff in crack folder. I think it needs better explanation. :-( but thanks for trying to get it for us"
,ally.st1,2011-02-19T22:40Z,Got it. After about millions trial. You have to change the zeros in licence folder to your host name. Which will be given to you when your start set up (left hand bottom corner). Safe the licence somewhere and then when you get to the point where is telling you no flex net licence server...thats were you upload your saved licence with your updated host name
,ally.st1,2011-02-20T23:43Z,"ok so the part about the licence I have done. I dont really understand this thing :
for pro/engineer:
Copy ""proe_WF5_Win64_crk.exe"" to folder \x86e_win64\obj and click ""Next > OK > Next > OK > Next > OK > Next > OK > Finish > OK""
Where is the proeWildire 5.0 etc?"
,ally.st1,2011-02-21T00:05Z,"ok find the file and copy the crack to it. well it still doenst work.
anyway, thank you very much blacktroy for getting in for us"
,omniTed,2011-03-21T10:02Z,Sorry if I'm asking a dumb question but what kind of text editor do you use to open the LIC file? 
,omniTed,2011-03-21T12:05Z,"Hey BLACKTROY thanks for the torrent. It works like a charm. The only problem I'm having is sometimes a dialogue box shows up stating 
THIS PROGRAM IS MISSING A COMPONENT 
I chose This program is running correctly and that is all. And also @Hottotrott : Thanks for your tips, I followed them and successfully patched all the required files."
,srinathchili,2011-07-04T14:51Z,hi
,srinathchili,2011-07-04T15:24Z,"I think these are the the few errors that most of us make apart from from the instructions in the read me file.

1.During installation check the license as nodelocked and locate the the .dat file that you had edited earlier using notepad and proceed to next. 

2.for patching/cracking.

for pro-engineer:
double click the patch, it shows where it has to be pasted.Paste according to that and run it (as administrator) press  yes or ok what ever appeared and finally finish.

*patching for 'proe distributed' also follows the same as above.

for mechanica:

The directory of mechanica:prog files,proewildfire 5.0,mech

for crack#1,

double click the patch it shows where it has to be pasted and close it.paste it and run(as administrator) it checks the .exe files to patch.
the file except mech.exe is located in bin 32. remaining all are located in bin.  

if there appears error like 'file not found'.check the location of the .exe files during patching.

crack#2 
also follows the same procedure.


Thats it,



enjoy...."
,ForeverZen,2011-08-25T17:02Z,"THIS IS CORRECT !!!!! BELOW !!!
INSTRUCTIONS AND PATCHES ARE FOUND IN lic_gen\wf5_f000 -->word document

1)  start pro E either from Setup or Run.exe
2)  add new license by directing to a license you copy and paste to your new location.  the new license.dat has all the 00-00-00-00-00-00 replaced with the computer host found in bottom left corner of install wizard)
when you make new license.dat file, open in a text reader, choose Edit->Replace->type in the replacement-->Replace All and save somewhere new.  this is the location you will refer back to when you add new license during installation.

for the Patches (Pro E):
proe_WF5_Win64_crk.exe copy and paste to C:\program files\proeWildfire5.0\x86e_win64\obj
ptc_distributed_services_WF5_Win64_crk.exe copy and paste to C:\program files\proeWildfire5.0\x86e_win64\obj (same location)

for the Patches (Pro Mechanica):
proe_mech_WF5_Win64_#1_crk.exe copy and paste to C:\program files\proeWildfire5.0\mech\x86e_win64\bin
    4 of 5 patches will work from that set, but mech.exe is found in C:\program files\proeWildfire5.0\mech\x86e_win64\bin32
    so repeat there for mech.exe
proe_mech_WF5_Win64_#2_crk.exe copy and paste to C:\program files\proeWildfire5.0\mech\x86e_win64\ptc

MAKE SURE TO RIGHT CLICK ON THE PATCHES WHEN IN THE NEW FOLDERS, AND CHOOSE ""RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR"" !!!!

HERE'S THE IMPORTANT THING:  WHEN CHOOSING THE INSTALL AT THE BEGINNING, PRO E IS A DEFAULT INSTALLATION, BUT PRO MECHANICA IS *NOT* A DEFAULT
INSTALLATION.  THEREFORE, MAKE SURE TO SELECT PRO MECHANICA AND ANY LANGUAGES YOU WANT TO INSTALL.  OTHERWISE, YOU WILL NOT FIND
THE PRO MECHANICA CRACKS BECAUSE THOSE FILES WON'T BE INSTALLED AND THEREFORE YOU WILL SPEND MUCH TIME LOOKING FOR THOSE FILES THAT YOU DIDN'T
INSTALL !!!

if you do all this, it works like a charm.  if you computer or laptop gets bogged down with both pro E and mechanica, just install Pro E and do the 2 patches for Pro E.  i installed both ways, with Pro E and then added Mechanica, but uninstalled Mechanica and Pro E runs swiftly.  if i need Mechanica, it literally takes 3 minutes to add back plus the patches, so i will just reinstall mechanica when i need to analyze designs.  happy designing !!  best, Zen."
,Munku,2011-09-15T06:06Z,"For everyone having issues dealing with file not found or unable to access. This is possibly due to the way permissions are setup in Vista and Windows 7 (My OS specifically). Right click each file in the \Obj folder and under the security tab click Edit. Click your user name, not administrator, and check the Full Access tickbox. Hit apply and Ok to close the window. Do this for each file and it should work! Good luck guys."

I had successfully install the software and launched it. All is good until where finally, the license gave up. 

I got this from the launch screen:

"" License request failed for feature

Requesting PROE_200 ...
