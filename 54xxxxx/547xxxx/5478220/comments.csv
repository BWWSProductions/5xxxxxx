,Infinitex2,2010-07-25T06:48Z,"Just so people know, this torrent contains:

A lecture series about Nietzsche by Robert Solomon, which I highly recommend.

A Biography and Analysis of Nietzche that spans four audio files.

NONE OF THESE BOOKS ARE BY NIETZSCHE but it's a good secondary learning experience :)"
,Blodhosta,2011-09-02T22:27Z,"In case someone's interested, the lectures by Robert Solomon are lecture 10-13 from his series of lectures for The Teaching Company called ""No Excuses: Existentialism and the Meaning of Life""."
