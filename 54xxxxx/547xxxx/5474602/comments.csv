[V],globeplus,2010-03-31T20:46Z,"thank you very much , it is for comments like that , that i try to keep my funny hobby work in making pratical files .
This game ends in my working schedule a very nice series of survival horror games that i had in stock waiting for an appropriate moment when not too much nice games was available , i started with EVIL DEAD REGENERATION then I`M NOT ALONE , after that DARK SALVATION and finaly this fantastic and intense highly recommended CALL OF CTHULHU - DARK CORNERS OF THE EARTH , so this file ends a fantastic sequence of work in some fantastics survival horror games and i think all the fans of this type of games love it ... thank you for the prefence and as usual i only want to be a valid option to the possible users of the pc games ."
,upwithevil,2010-04-01T05:38Z,This game is especially great if you're familiar with Lovecraft's writings.  Insmouth looks just the way I imagined it.  
[V],globeplus,2010-04-01T08:33Z,"thank you for your comments , iÂ´d like to say that it is true that some fantastic survival horror games are inspired from great books that transportate the reader imagination to a fantastic state full of imagination and books rich in that imagination are good argument for nice survival horror games , we have for example S.D.Perry that the books inspired the Resident Evil world famous series ."
