,jersson,2010-04-02T13:04Z,Thank's but I have this one already. I meant Adobe Acrobat 9.3 but maybee it's not possible to make it portable. Could it be made with a crack ?

The other Acrobat 9.3 that I've seen is 1.42 GB of size. Looks difficult to make it Portable. ;o)
I've not tried to D/L it to see if licenses or Crack are OK, too big only for a test."
