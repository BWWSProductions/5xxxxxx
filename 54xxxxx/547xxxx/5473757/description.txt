Gigantic fleets prowl the starlanes, mysterious aliens devise inexplicable fates for humankind, devilish scientists operate enormous engines of destruction and swashbuckling princes defend their world from ancient empires.  
 
Each of Starblazer's 281 issues explored a whole adventure set within the vast galactic empires of the far future, giving the forthcoming roleplaying game from Cubicle 7 Entertainment a wide variety of settings to explore. From low-fi space exploration to galaxy-busting wars to space fantasy epics at the end of time, there is plenty for everyone.
	
Published by British publisher D.C.Thomson, Starblazer was the home to some of the best British science fiction space opera of the 1970's and 80's. Featuring stunning art and classic space opera stories, comic creators such as Grant Morrison and John Smith, artists Enrique Alcatena, Mike McMahon, Cam Kennedy, John Ridgeway, Alan Rogers, Jaime Oritz, Ian Kennedy, Colin MacNeil and Casanovas Junior helped bring the fantastic 'spacefiction adventure in pictures' to life.
The Starblazer licence was picked up by British games publisher Cubicle 7 Entertainment, who also publish SLA Industries and Victoriana. To help you relive and create your own stories of comic book sci-fi derring do, the developer, Chris Birch, chose the critically acclaimed FATE rules system.  FATE was recently seen in action with Evil Hat Productions' popular Spirit of the Century RPG and has been tweaked to give Starblazer players the full intergalactic meal deal.	
	
The core release will include three detailed settings based on the very best stories from Starblazer. It will also detail recurring characters, organisations, empires and aliens such as the Fi-Sci (the Fighting Scientists of Galac Squad), The Star Patrol, The Suicide Squad, The Planet Tamer, Cinnibar the barbarian warrior of Babalon and galactic cop Frank Carter to name just a few.
