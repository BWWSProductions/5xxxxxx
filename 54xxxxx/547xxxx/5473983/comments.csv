,jg4545,2010-04-06T12:21Z,"Thanks for UL.  However after unzipping i'm still left with 'Launch WinRAR.exe' and 'WinRAR.exe' which still seem to be zipped and double clicking brings up the unzipper.  What should i do at this point?  
Thanks"

This one is supposed to be used on systems where you don't have already installed WinRAR, even if it doesn't makes any harm to it. Running the program on a clean machine you 'll get the WR functions in the menu when you click with the right mousebutton on a file. Obviously if you already have WinRAR installed you 'll not see any difference."
