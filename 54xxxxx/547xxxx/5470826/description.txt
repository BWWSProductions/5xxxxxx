Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures S01E06: All Souls

Fitz goes to Guatemala for a med-evac escort. Unfortunately, his patient has bleeding in the brain and if he doesn't die there, is likely to be killed by the cabin pressure on the flight home. Back in Toronto, Ming contends with an emergency delivery when her patient's baby gets tangled in the umbilical cord. 


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion.
