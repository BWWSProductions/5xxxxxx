PLOT

Kate and John Coleman are rebuilding their troubled marriage. Kate had a 
drinking problem, but is in therapy and is doing well. She has been sober 
for one year. The couple decides to adopt a child. When they meet the 
nine-year-old Estonian girl, Esther, at the St. Marina Orphanage, they 
immediately fall in love with the well-educated orphan. Their young son, 
Daniel, is hostile to his new sister; but their deaf-mute daughter, little Max, 
is enchanted with her - at first. Eventually, Kate begins to feel that Esther 
is manipulative and possibly even psychologically disturbed. John refuses to 
listen to his wife's misgivings, and the wounds in their marriage reopen. 
Kate calls Sister Abigail at the orphanage, and the nun informs her that 
Esther has a troubled and mysterious history. Kate delves further into Esther's 
past and discovers she is not at all who she pretends to be.
