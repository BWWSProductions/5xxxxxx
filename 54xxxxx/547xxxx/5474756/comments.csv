,bramsie,2010-03-31T23:35Z,Thnx alot :-)
,the_shroud,2010-04-01T01:34Z,"Thx 2040, really been wanting to watch this but the distributors never bothered to release it in the theaters here. Well, all those with ""...brilliant writing, witty dialog..."" usually get passed off over here.

I really need to get myself an external hdrive. My netbooks starting to slow down......"
,lilars26,2010-04-01T02:31Z,"Thanks 20-40.
I have so many cartoons that you have 
upped and my grandaughter will be here 
for Easter.She will be very happy.

@the_shroud  My son bought me a 500 gig
Seagate external drive for Xmas.It is great for storing movies.Prices have come down quite a bit.Great for backup too."
,the_shroud,2010-04-01T06:58Z,"Thx lilars, gonna check out some this weekend. I wonder if they have something that can play av files directly to lcd tv?
My netbook was almost full when i discovered 2040. Then I started to encode all my avi and started following 2040 (it feels like i'ts been forever) but even now its nowhere near as full as when it was b4. A toast to the best uploader. Cheers :D"
,bhailog,2010-04-01T07:26Z,"great work dude!!!
will definitely seed"

Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers

[V],twentyforty,2010-04-01T11:06Z,"@the_shroud: IMHO, PS3, HDMI cable and LOT of blank DVDs are the best solution. People are often abused by false advertising about some devices which ""can play it all"". Google one hour and you'll get more information you probably need.
Maybe a new HDD (I bought last year a 500GB Samsung for 68 bucks) and CHEAP housing/adapter for external HDD are good solution too... However, because you have laptop, you are stuck with slowish USB and relatively limited choices."
,the_shroud,2010-04-01T13:32Z,Thx 4 the advice. Think i'll go for the last option. Thought i could get something permanently plugged to the tv without getting a desktop. But i guess i'll just have to keep plugging and unplugging my netbook after every show. But archiving the movies i've seen to HDD will keep my netbook light (unless i'm still seeding it) :)
,jon4fun,2010-04-02T04:35Z,"Hi 20-40,
Just wanted to let you know that I burned 2 copies of this movie today and I know that 3 different families, at least, have/are/will enjoy it.

Thank you from them & me.

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-04-02T04:39Z,"@the shroud - I've got a question out to a firend of mine who has been raving about a 'magic box' that he bought.
It plays all formats without conversion (including .mkv).
I'll post to this torrent when I get the answer.

Cheers
Jon
P.S. I bought a 1TB external HDD for 80 Euros from Aldi this week. Tested with Vista, OK!"
,jon4fun,2010-04-03T03:15Z,"@the_shroud:
I got the name etc. of the device previoulsy mentioned, sorry it took a while.
I'll post the link to site in next comment as unsure on TPB policy on links.
Google -  WD TV? Live Media Player.

I hear nothing but good things about this item but I don't own one myself so not a recommendation just some information.

Cheers
Jon"
