Anyone have any ideas?  NukeX 6.0.1 worked fine, and I made sure I was in 32 bit kernel mode."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-03T09:07Z,"@largesize, I'm not actually a Nuke user so I can't help, I'm afraid. But if you're going to find an answer, I think the place to look is here:

,largesize,2010-04-03T16:25Z,thanks for upload and the reply largepepper-  were there any instructions about installation for this?  
[T],artpepper,2010-04-03T19:31Z,"No, @largesize, I'm sorry to say, there weren't. It was 3 compressed files. I unpacked them, hoping to find an .nfo file or something with some directions but no dice. 

So I scanned it for nasties and uploaded, thinking that people who are more familiar with Mac apps than I am would know what to do with the files. I wish I could be more help. Sorry."

You can view such text files by opening them with your Browser and selecting the proper text encoding.
In this case I used Internet Explorer, under View->Encodings I used ""automatic"" and it is clearly Russian.

Google translation to English:
1. Install the necessary software.
 2. For each individual product, run win32-crk.exe or win64-crk.exe
 (depending on the version you installed - x32 or x64).
 3. Run FoundryLicenseInstaller.exe. He rugnetsya that your System ID does not match that specified in the license.
 But the bottom of the window will show you your System ID.
 (eg I've got it 001a4d9a3c74)
 4. Click on it with the mouse, highlighting it and clicking the right mouse button, copy to clipboard.
 5. Open any text editor file foundry.lic.
 6. Change the value HOSTID = 000000000000 on HOSTID = your System ID, is inserted in the buffer.
 (I will be so - HOSTID = 001a4d9a3c74)
 7. Save the changes to the license file.
 8. Now again run FoundryLicenseInstaller.exe, but now you should be all ok.
 (in confirmation of this, there will be an inscription error and will enable the button Install).
 9. Install the license and enjoy ...

 P.S. Be careful when you install the x64 version. Do not forget to specify the installation directory
 ""Program Files (x86)"" or ""Program Files"".
