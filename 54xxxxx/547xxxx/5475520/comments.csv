,eylenn,2010-06-16T11:39Z,does this torrent have trojan or is it safe?
,xxaetherxx,2010-08-01T20:34Z,"I find it ironic that Rasta found a virus in the ""Does this look infected"" Folder."
,yelloo,2010-09-21T14:27Z,Thanks yanek231.
,TheLegendaryCracken,2010-12-11T12:37Z,"Decent download speed, it said it has 48 minutes to go, but i reckon it will take about 30 minutes if not that, but for 1gb i wouldnt expect anything less :)"
,ThePirate1011,2010-12-18T03:51Z,"My computer went to download and detected a trojan, just a heads up."
,Strabby,2010-12-24T02:44Z,i'm already afraid of dowloading. 
,retux,2011-02-27T01:36Z,"If you're afraid to download it, then don't bother. 2 people have already confirmed that there's a trojan in the torrent. Fuck it."
,Zedlav,2011-03-09T03:27Z,"Downloaded and Scanned with Avast!, nothing found."
,KaZaM-117,2011-03-23T22:31Z,"Downloaded Go Chuck Yourself folder, scanned with Kaspersky Internet Security 2010, no threats detected.
Then downloaded the ""Still Waiting (live in Brussels)"" file rastas959 said contained a trojan. No threats detected.

Not downloading anymore because I already have their other albums, but thank you yanek for uploading GCY."
