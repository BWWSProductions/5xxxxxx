Alex welcomes back to the show Washington, D.C.-based investigative journalist, author and columnist Wayne Madsen [hour 2]. Mr. Madsen is a former government consultant on contracts for the National Security Agency and worked for the Navy's Naval Data Automation Command as a civilian employee before taking up investigative journalism.

Alex also talks with William R. Fain [end of hour 4], executive producer of a grass roots production company based in Tennessee encompassing film, music, and marketing products. Mr. Fain was working on a film project with former Georgia senator and CPS activist Nancy Schaefer before she was suicided by unknown assassins.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
