Tonight's Show: Junk Science (FBN 8pm & 11PM ET)

Should America ban "Dihydrogen monoxide?" Itâ€™s odorless and tasteless, and yet the chemical kills thousands every year.  Most people whom I asked agreed that dihydrogen monoxide should be banned.  No one realized that dihydrogen monoxide is just another name for  H2O, or water.

When it comes to science, most people are ignorant. That makes it easy for government and other zealots to scare us into agreeing to give up some of our freedom. Our scientific illiteracy makes us vulnerable to junk science.

That's the topic of this week's show (Thursday on FBN at 8pm & 11pm ET).

Take global warming. Many good scientists are genuinely worried that greenhouse gases may cause disruptive warming.  So then why do some environmentalists, like Al Gore, feel the need to mislead people with nonsense? Gore claims we set a record for tornadoes in 2004, but there has been no such trend. Gore also claims there is no debate that today's warming is unprecedented in thousands of years, but he cherry-picks temperature records to hide the "medieval warm period", a period when temperatures might have been as warm or warmer in the northern hemisphere.

Climate scientist Roy Spencer will join the show to help sort fact from fiction in the global warming debate. Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute will expose energy myths on the Right and the Left. Plus, find out how environmental hysteria got light bulbs and plastic bag banned -- and how junk sciencee got me a free golf cart from the government.
