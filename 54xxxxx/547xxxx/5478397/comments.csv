[T],skJGZV6z,2010-04-03T06:19Z,"That H2O bit is only a warm-up pitch, framing the questions and debate to follow. The main aim is that various entities might invoke ""junk science"" to gain an unwarranted credibility necessary to provoke some desired sort of action...usually at the expense of tax paying citizens.

I saw that particular Bullshit! show, and highly recommend it...and all the other episodes too, Penn & Teller are praiseworthy!"
,hdhcst95,2010-04-07T02:14Z,"Could you upload the wide screen versions of these episodes? They broadcast the show in 16:9 yet you keep uploading them in 4:3 for some reason. That means we're missing like 20-30% of the image for every single frame. 

A bit irritating. If you wanna record it in wide screen you'll have to watch it on fox business HD (they broadcast wide screen there). "
[T],skJGZV6z,2010-04-08T23:42Z,"hdhcst95: My cable provider doesn't provide the HD version of Fox Business (they don't even advertise that they carry the SD version in channel lineups, I just happened to find it one day). And unfortunately for me, even if they did add the HD version of the channel, I do not have the equipment to capture it.

But, according to their website, Fox Business program content is broadcast 4x3 on the 16x9 HD version. They use the resulting side pillars to display market and exchange data.

Even if Stossel was shown widescreen (I cannot know this), by virtue of the fact that many in their audience will be watching the 4x3 SD channel, their camera crew will be framing 16x9 shots in such a manner that no critical details are cut off once cropped to 4x3. It is and will be standard TV practice until the day when all the legacy 4x3 tubes out there are finally replaced."
,hdhcst95,2010-04-10T01:33Z,To see the difference check out Stossel on Hulu's website. They don't just fill the side with numbers or crop it.
,InfidelSerf,2010-04-14T05:18Z,"hdhcst95 just use the ""widefit"" or stretch feature on your widescreen tv.  The show is 95% dialog and any visual aids are front and center. No loss there.  I am just extremely grateful to skJGZV6z for the uploads, as I do not get FNB in my area."
[T],skJGZV6z,2010-06-04T10:12Z,"hdhcst95: I took your advice and compared my SD version with what's playing on Hulu. You're right, it is made for HD there. Some picture elements do get cut as a result, hopefully they are not significant (they oughtn't). I noticed that at the show's open, the ""STOSSEL"" crawling logo in the corner is sync'd differently on top of the program vid. It suggests FBN releases a separate version of the show for Hulu. Perhaps that explains the long delay before episodes show up there?

I regret I cannot bring you the HD version."
