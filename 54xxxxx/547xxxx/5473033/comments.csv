I have been waiting two years every since it was announced that these 'lost tapes' had been found and I heard 'The Dance' track which just blew me away in the fact she pre-dated techno by nearly twenty years. I think as time goes on, the recognition of Delia Derbyshire as a true pioneer of electronic music can only grow because culture has finally caught up with her; she was just too far ahead of the game and its such a shame she died precisely at the time in 2001 when she was finally getting long overdue recognition (in part thanks to Sonic Boom)."
