,Slyguy3129,2010-05-03T19:10Z,"Alright just a fair warning to people who want to download this.

While the movie is in English, as in that is what is spoken, all the subtitles as far as hard coded into the movie language is German.

So while you will be able to ""understand"" the characters, when it switches to the ""real footage"" everything is subed in German. When the movie is telling you the location and time and date it is in German. When the archive footage is subing what is being said ie 911 calls where it is hard to understand what is being said the subs are in German. At the end of the movie where it tries to tell you something, is in German.

This is NOT the english version of the film. It is German. Find another torrent if you want to be able to understand everything going on.

It is very annoying when uploaders do things like this."
