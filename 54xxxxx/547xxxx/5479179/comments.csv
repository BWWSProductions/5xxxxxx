Start from another Mac or partition, only then you can replace files!"
,decebal2003,2010-04-10T00:00Z,Is there any version for Windows please?
,pReStOn_C,2010-04-16T17:52Z,"@decebal2003 - now that would be a good question to ask in the mac applications section now wouldn't it, then again you never know. sorry dude have no idea period! try asking in the windows application area, you would probably get more info there than here... or just google it with +torrent added to it and you may get some results?????"

,respider,2010-06-13T21:24Z,"doesnt work...I have installed the package, replaced the .app (with terminal) and runned prefPane to replace the preference panel. Still asking for registration"
,hustondk,2010-08-12T14:12Z,Installed the package but don't really know where to place the file... Plzzz helpppp
,gchenfc,2011-08-09T05:30Z,"lack of instructions could make things very tricksy, but you have to install it, then uncompress all the compressions or whatever till you find the preferences pane file. run the app in there and the preference pane to reconfigure the section in system prefs.  idk if this is relevant, but when i was installing, little snitch asked me if i would let it connect, i just denied it to be safe"
