srsly no offense but the english subtitles are terrible, i found a way better english translation on  opensubtitles.org but its formatted for the 1cd version, so if anyone wants english i recommend that (its plain txt so you can edit it yourself or tweak your players settings to work with the 2cd vids).

again, you uploaded 1.37GB of awesome and im only saying 22KB isnt the greatest, so please dont take this as negative

thank you fasamoo :)

idk if TPB will let me post a direct link but heres my attempt:
