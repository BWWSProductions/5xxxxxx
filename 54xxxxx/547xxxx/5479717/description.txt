 1946 to 1953 [Box] [Remaster]: Release Notes:  
Guitarist/singer Lowell Fulson has long been an overlooked blues innovator, overshadowed by more commercially successful artists such as B.B. King. In truth, Fulson gave King "Three O'Clock Blues," which became a hit for King in the '50s. British label JSP does its best to present a more complete picture of Fulson with the four-CD box set Lowell Fulson 1946 to 1953. A superb collection, the set traces the rise of Fulson from obscure Oklahoma guitar slinger to "chitlin circuit" blues star. ~ Matt Collar
