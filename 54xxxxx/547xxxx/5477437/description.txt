This is one of the best episodes from early in 
the 3rd Season: the one where Judge Garth considers 
running for political office.

It's also a good showcase for actress Roberta Shore 
(played Betsy Garth) who would soon leave this series
and show business in 1965 after three years on the show.

Guest stars are Steve Forrest, Warren Stevens, and Steve Ihnat.
