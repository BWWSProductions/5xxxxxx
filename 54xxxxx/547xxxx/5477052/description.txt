This is the full season without the annoying hard-encoded Spanish subs. I downloaded each file separately, which took forever, since only between 0 and 4 people seeding each, took me like two full days. There are plenty seeding the one with the Spanish subs, which I also watched, but I don't want to put anyone else through that agony, so here is what you all want, no stupid subs to distract. Someone obviously never heard of regular subs. Enjoy - I know you will - it's shit funny :-D
