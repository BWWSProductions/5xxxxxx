SHUT DOWN XAMPP OR OTHER WEBSERVERS BEFORE STARTING THE SERVER! 
OTHERWISE YOU WILL GET PROBLEMS!
To save your game automatically, you must login with the same username everytime!
No Tutorial needed! Download the newest Version of Server and read the instructions of the readme! With the values.db from 0.3.1 you can play till Giovanni wants you to take some documents and bring them to someone! Till then, everything is working!"

,samouha20041,2010-04-02T17:29Z,where exactly i can found the host file and can i play it with the other crack or i have to install it from begining
,badboy420,2010-04-02T17:46Z,"a small explanation for those who dont understand.

This works on trigger principle.
A data is sent from the server corresponding to a data sent by the game.Once check is done the game advances.

ubisoft mentioned that even 56kb/sec connection is enough for the game.

values.db is used related to the above mentioned process.

U don't need to worry about them altering their servers, cause when u run the game from here, u dont connect to their servers.its just emulated.


data is collected from legal copies, database is created and given to u.

@kaotik2k - try to get enlightened by reading stuff given above & in the comments of this torrent."
,SteXDudE,2010-04-02T17:58Z,"When the final version of ""values.db"" is coming out?"
,badboy420,2010-04-02T18:47Z,"think about a mass PC platform with millions of legal buyers, and ubisoft trying a new method to overcome this emulation.

Well, they would definitely be afraid of another DOS attack on their servers,

wouldn't they..? "

For those of you interested in playing go to this website and follow this post : http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=55769

they are updating all the time.....

as for what it does...it fakes the game out to make it believe you are connected to the ubi soft server spoiler alert* I am playing the game it goes past the white screen I have made it to Enzio's fathers execution

you need to keep updating the ""values.db"" file to keep playing or wait til they have it all."

1) use the orignal host file present in 

C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc

2) Dont start Server.exe

3) Run the game, but dont allow the Ubisoft AutoPatch to run.

u should get the message 
""Trying to download update file from http://static3.cdn.ubi.com/assassins_creed_2/assassins_creed_2_1.01_eu.exe. Destination: 

C:\DOCUME~1\PD\LOCALS~1\Temp\ubi140.tmp.exe.
Fatal download error (The requested URL returned error: 404).
Deleting downloaded data.""

in the ""advanced"" section.

4) Let the Assassins creed 2 updater to run.usually it runs once u cancel the Ubisoft autopatch.

U NEED INTERNET CONNECTION FOR THIS STEP.

5) once u get it done.It takes only a few seconds.U ll get the ""PLEASE LOG IN"" screen.

6) close the screen.

7) Modify the Hosts file in C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc

add the following to it

127.0.0.1       static3.cdn.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       ubisoft-orbit.s3.amazonaws.com
127.0.0.1       onlineconfigservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       orbitservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       ubisoft-orbit-savegames.s3.amazonaws.com

8) Now run Server.exe

9) Run the game.
use any random username,password.

10) to save and load use the same username/pass


11) enjoy
