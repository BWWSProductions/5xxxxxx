,Bromthebard2,2011-08-05T06:41Z,"does anybody know how to add these to my kindle app for the ipod touch, you can't add it to itunes"
,mantip,2011-08-08T15:42Z,"@Brom I don't think you can put them on Kindle, you should be able to add pdf files to iTunes and put them on iBooks, which is a free app as well.

,allanahx,2011-09-06T20:27Z,you need to convert them to mobi files to put them on a kindle. You can do this by downloading calibri and then converting them and it is very easy to do. Thanks for the torrent :) love these books
