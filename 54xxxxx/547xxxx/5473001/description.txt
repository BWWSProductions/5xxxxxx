          Dope is a New York-based quintet led by brothers Edsel Dope (lead vocals, rhythm     
          guitar) and Simon Dope (keyboards). Children of divorced parents, the two grew up    
          separately in Florida. Simon studied chemistry at the University of Florida, then    
          received a scholarship to Polytechnic in Brooklyn. There, he was joined by his       
          brother; the two claim to have financed their demos by selling drugs. Raiding other  
          bands for lead guitarist Tripp Eisen, bass player Acey Slade, and drummer Preston    
          Nash, they began a selective series of gigs in late 1997. In October 1998, they were 
          signed to Flip Records, which made a production deal with Epic. Dope's debut album,  
          Felons and Revolutionaries, was released in September 1999. The Dope brothers gutted 
          their lineup after the ensuing tour, switching Slade to guitar and bringing in       
          original bassist Sloane Jentry, guitarist Virus and drummer Sketchy Shay. In the fall
          of 2001, they released their second album, Life. Two years later, the band inked a   
          deal with Artemis, and issued Group Therapy. American Apathy arrived in summer 2005.
