,darklordofspawn,2010-03-31T03:01Z,"thank you skidrow and uploader.
thank you for the early release.
i am downloading this now, hope it works :)"
,darklordofspawn,2010-03-31T03:38Z,"do we have to download the 600MB file?
or can we just go to the taleworlds website and download it?"
,darklordofspawn,2010-03-31T04:01Z,"+ 1 more thing.
can we still use the old UniLoader that worked for most versions of mount and blade?"
,dracownsu,2010-03-31T06:13Z,"Please, I know this sounds stupid here, But if you like this game PLEASE buy it. 

It is a great game done by a VERY small company. They REALLY need all the help they can get. This is a truly unique and innovative new type of game that deserves to be supported. So PLEASE if you do like it help these guys out and buy a copy."
,darklordofspawn,2010-03-31T08:09Z,"alright, ive downloaded, installed and applied the crack and i am able to start the game.
but the first time i started the game and whole lot of errors came up, something about direct X and that nothing will be rendered.
(i am using Windows &(64bit))
i then set Mount and blade to windows XP comparability mode, i was able to then start the game and create my character, then when the gameplay started all i saw was a grey background and my cross hair. I was able to move, walk and hear everything, but i couldn't see anything.
is there any way to get this working on Windows 7 (64)?"
,pmk98,2010-03-31T08:17Z,darklordofspawn// it works fine on win7 64.

,darklordofspawn,2010-03-31T08:56Z,"ok dw about it, i just had to mess with the graphics settings.
i still dont know why my screen actually turned gray during gameplay. i set  the graphics setting back to maximum and now its fine...
anyways, thanks. works great."

,18Zulukiller,2010-03-31T15:22Z,"Armagedon the guy that developed this game is a lying theiving son of bitch. The guy has litterally commited fraud on a massive scale against the people that payed for its development through the Beta. I know this for a fact as i'm one of the people that payed for its development (over 4 years ago) and have followed its development very carefully.  

So unless you're desperate to play online (another thing he lied about as he said there would be no online play) i encourage you all to not give this thieving turkish twat a penny of your money. "

You are SO right! Piracy of games is illegal we all know that, but I hate wasting 40? on a game that I don't even like... Not that I don't like Mount & Blade, but today's game developers don't make demos of their games, that's why we download them; To TRY them and then, if we enjoy them, we BUY them... So please folks, buy the game if you like it. Else we won't have any games in the future..."

,Fenk,2010-04-02T12:27Z,"@Tornadobullet: Nevermind Windows thinks they are VLC files. Any CD-burning software will recognize the ""bin"" and ""cue"" files as disk images. You can also mount them with Daemon Tools or Alcohol. The two files together actually make a single disk image. When burning or mounting, the programs will only ""see"" one of them (the .cue, I think). The other file (the .bin) has too be in the same directory and have the same name.

So burn it, or mount it, and from there I don't know, I'm still downloading it, install the game I suppose. (Read the nfo with any text editor or nfo viewer, you have instructions there)."

,1stand15th,2010-04-06T18:44Z,"@ Tornadobullet

Had the same problem mate, then I realised I was being an idiot and all you have to do is mount the file as you normally would during an install, and hit 'Explore' on the CD drive from the Computer menu. The SKIDROW folder and files are in there!"

,FireSign,2010-04-10T19:56Z,"No, you dont need a Serial Key/CD Key, the cracks in circulation do the trick. You might want to buy a CD Key though, for the multiplayer option, although you CAN play on multiplayer without buying, just on LAN/VPN though.

You can play multiplayer on hamachi (after settings things up in MNB).. 

If your going to play online on non-legit servers, i recommend using Tunngle instead of Hamachi, it's simply a huge amount better (for example, around 256 people can join each tunngle server)"

,Ronbert,2010-04-25T11:24Z,"Well I'm not to much into the game it's okay though but needs some tweaks. For free though I can't really complain, torrent is clean and works well. Also when you mount the image make sure to click ""explore"" to look inside the folder, in there is the Skidrow crack folder which is what you'll need to crack the game."
,AParkInBOTSWANA,2010-04-26T01:20Z,how do you use the skidrow thing.  I press space and doesnt work
,Mr.Deceptive,2010-05-03T10:41Z,"Installing game steps:
1. Use Daemontools to mount (you can download a trial version of Daemontools).
2. With Daemontools open, drag+drop OR open the .BIN file in Daemontools (mounting the file)
3. Click the icon for Mount and Blade that should show up in Daemontools. This will start the installer.
4. This will install Mount and Blade: Warband version 1.011

Installing crack for the game steps:
1. Go to the Mount and Blade: Warband directory (Usually C:Program Files\Mount&Blade Warband)
2. Locate the folder titled ""SKIDROW""
3. In this folder is the crack and the icon/.exe you will use to run this game under the crack
4.Move both files in the folder to the main Mount and Blade directory (C:Program Files\Mount&Blade Warband). It will prompt you to replace a file, replace the file.
5. Run the .exe file called SKIDROW. This will bring up a strange looking screen. I just let it run for a few seconds, then hit SPACEBAR as it tells you to. This will shut the screen automatically. I am not sure if this runs the crack or is just author info, couldn't hurt to do it anyways.
6. Then open the game with mb_warband. Use this icon to open the game from now on.


Follow these steps and it will work. That's how I got mine working."
,akwey,2010-05-04T07:56Z,"I tried to run the 'Skidrow.exe' that came in the crack folder in Sandboxie and Avast! popped up and warned me that it was a rootkit.

The file itself has no effect on the game so I would recommend deleting it before you install the game."

And as for everyone else asking for instructions use your fucking eyes and read. Or look the shit up. You cock suckers should either use your fucking brain and figure it out or google the shit if the instructions given on nearly every cracked game torrent are too hard to figure out.

Step3: When your done installing you'll be moved to the serial screen just exit it out.

Step4: Go to ""my computer"" and look for Mount n Blade.

Step5: Right Click it and then click explore.

Step5: Goto the Skidrow folder and copy mb_warband and over-right the one at

If I get a steady job and a reasonable amount of expendable income then I'll definatley start buying games and probably invest into good video game companies (ie companies who are doing innovative things and need funding, not people like EA who only act to please their shareholders)"
