[V],twentyforty,2010-04-02T17:57Z,"@nevin_al: I did OTH on site where was my home, but, back then, OTH significantly has lost the audience. It happens to all long-lived shows; only hard-core fans stays loyal - but they watch episodes on TV and even do not know what torrents are...
Now, I cannot. I was tempted, I admit (miss Bush is my desktop wallpaper and keep bugging me about) but I must kick-out all shows without regular, normal people (not hard-fisting bastards) and with loyal-seeding fan-base. OTH is one of many which have similar faith. Sorry."
