The Road shares the premise of the novel on which it is based: a father (Mortensen) and his young son (Smit-McPhee) struggle to survive a number of years after a devastating cataclysm has destroyed civilization, killed most plant and animal life, and obscured the sun. Although the disaster itself is never named, the world is in a state of nuclear winter. Only remnants of mankind remain alive, reduced to scavenging or cannibalism. Man and boy, both unnamed, are traveling southward, in the hope that it will be warmer. Along the way, they search for shelter, food, and fuel, and avoid bands of cannibals while trying to maintain their own sense of humanity. The man carries a revolver, but has only two bullets which he seems to want to keep in case they need to commit suicide. Flashback and dream sequences spaced throughout the narrative show how the man's wife, who has a much more expanded role in the film than in the book, committed suicide after losing the will to go on in a seemingly doomed world.
