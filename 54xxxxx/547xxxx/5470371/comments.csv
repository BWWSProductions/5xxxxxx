,Dj-ToneZ,2010-03-30T14:57Z,CRAP CRAP CRAP - Fake Doesnt Work - Installs Fine Then You Get A Crapy English Version With UI Infront Of Everything Then Ya Try Play The Game And It Doesnt Respond And Closes Down :@ !!!!
,imr147,2010-03-30T16:30Z,"@ DJ-Tonez:

you said ""copy them over where?""
Well,isn't that too obvious? maybe over the existing ones created after installing, updating & then running the game at least one time?

It's not a crap nor a fake...  you followed scrupulously all steps depicted in that included ""How to install"" file???

It's working great at my side. I've both installed and tested twice before sharing this...

Do you want some screenshots of my working v1.04 to probe how it works with no probs on my computer?"
,patrioticparadox,2010-04-21T21:03Z,why would you put the install instructions in a pdf. damn pirates and their crazy formats. but thanks for the up. hopefully install is fairly standard and I wont even need to open the pdf. thanks again
,patrioticparadox,2010-04-21T21:51Z,"Confirmed: works

very easy install. I did run into 2 issues though
1. In the #3 folder, one says to place in your documents folder. The folder you put there has a different name than the one the game creates.
Suggested fix: install game, run patch, copy other folder to install dir, run launcher, cancel launcher, then copy files to ""German Truck Simulator"".

2.my launcher screen has issues. instead of saying, for example, resolution it says [3004] resource id. this is the same for every option and button on the launcher. even ""start game"" button says [3000] resource id. this is probably just a local problem and i will try a reinstall later

other than those two very minor things the game runs perfectly. thanks again for the up"
,4l3k51,2010-05-15T13:47Z,"I suggest not to dowload this, in the middle of downloading my avast! antivirus says that there's a win32:Skimorph (cryp) virus in the installer, and this virus is pretty bad, it slows down your computer and steals your private information (user names, passwords... etc.) and i really hope that it was an false positive alert. :("
,imr147,2010-05-18T12:24Z,"@ 4l3k51:

Both the installer itself and the update file ARE OFFICIAL from the developer website so they're not modified or patched in any way by myself nor anybody else (apart from developers of course).

You might want to kindly test these files with another AV or with any online AV test site (like VirusTotal) before dropping yours ""Incendiary Suggestions"" here.

Just  to be clear: THIS WHOLE PACKAGE IS NOT INFECTED BY ANY VIRUS, PERIOD."
,4l3k51,2010-05-20T15:18Z,"@imr147

Well, its been about a week now, and there's no sign of the virus, so i'm  pretty confident that it was an false positive alert. So, i'm sorry of blaming you about the virus thingy. Oh, and i read about this, there's been more of these false alerts (not in this file) by avast! AV, so if you have avast! saying about a virus in this torrent, its false. :)
sorry again. :D"
,dkoda55,2010-10-05T06:06Z,"thank you , very much .  no problem at all . "
,lions_truck,2010-10-10T21:23Z,"It works nicely, the only problem is that all the city names disapear when its in english, but its still great"
,MareBgd,2010-10-11T18:39Z,"yeah all is kl, just if u can fix this problem with city names dissapear? from everywhere, not only from map, u know when they say we have our offices in Dortmund, but there isnt Dortmund, just empty space..."
,Shunlucard31,2010-10-26T14:36Z,Hey 4l3k51 I SUGGEST THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR ANTIVIRUS INTO AVG 2011 
,ubek89pl,2010-12-10T23:33Z,4l3k51 YOU ARE FUCKING DUMB ASS!!!!! If you are so afraid to catch a virus then why the fuck you come here? Go on and buy this game and live on with $30 less in your pocket. I donâ€™t use any antivirus software and i dint get any virus for over 2 years. 80% files on pirate bay are considered by every antivirus software as virus and it is complete bullshit. The whole idea of virus is bull shit. It is all so people spend more money. I suggest you to get the fuck out of this site and never come back(unless you gonna start using your fucking potato head)
,en12,2011-01-01T17:48Z,"Hi all!

Be careful with the English files, there are 2 wrong folder names!

/INTO German Truck installation/bin/win x86 is wrong, you should copy the file to the win_x86 folder!

/INTO YOUR Documents/Game Truck Simulator is wrong, please use the ""German Truck Simulator"" folder instead!"
