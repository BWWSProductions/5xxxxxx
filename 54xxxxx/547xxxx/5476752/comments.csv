,EL SUECO,2010-04-02T12:55Z,"Thanx dude for the upload
Have a nice weekend =)"
,believenu,2010-04-02T16:03Z,thank you again
,woytek2k,2010-04-02T16:52Z,"Thanks for the upload, but why can't you also upload the full version besides the 272p one? Watching this on a 24"" monitor is crap."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-02T17:07Z,"No... LOL, you simply use inferior playback-chain or/and player.
Listen... do not call someone's work CRAP. Most of the time people mirroring what they do for life or feel like. 
If you need to go in the bathroom, just go - it's easier then to wrote nonsense like your comment and to insult not just me, but millions of people who have downloaded my excellent 272p."
,DannyBoy734,2010-04-03T21:09Z,"Thanks again 2040.
Don't take any notice of woytek2k, he gloats about his big 24 incher but hasn't had the sense to change his graphics card!
In any case, he has never uploaded... Thanks for nothing(apart from critizism) woytek2k!"
,scratch10,2010-04-04T01:29Z,"Why do ppl download then complain, idiots.

Thanks uploader, for the size of the file, its good quality viewing, and quick to."
,ninapuss,2010-04-04T11:24Z,"Well, try streaming to a big screen and you'll see what crap actually means in this context... shite!"
,ninapuss,2010-04-04T12:17Z,"...and this is episode 13, not 14.
Stop wasting people's time with crap quality, mislabelled files."
,woytek2k,2010-04-04T18:19Z,"@twentyforty
I am not saying your upload is crap, it is probably fine for ipod/pocket media players/etc. It is however, NOT FINE, for a 24"" computer monitor. In that case I would much rather watch a sharp 720p episode. Thank you for uploading this one, I am simply asking for a HQ version next to it.

@DannyBoy734
Whether or not I have uploaded is of no relevance here whatsoever. Besides, my graphics card is a 5850 and that is inserted into a X58 motherboard together with a i7 920 and 6GB of RAM. Yeah I'm gloating, and you are flaming/talking shit."
,PAWZ76654321,2010-04-05T19:40Z,I confirm that this is episode 13 and not 14!
,PAWZ76654321,2010-04-05T19:53Z,"My mistake! :-s This is ep.14 'Better Angels'.
Apparently, 11 & 12 were coupled together so some episode 13's were wrongly labelled causing the confusion!
Sorry 'twentyforty' hope this clears it up for anyone else & thanks for the up! ("",)"
,believenu,2010-04-05T21:14Z,I have been catching up on this series and was wondering ... does anyone besides me want to smack the main fbi agent(Ralph Feinnes) ..he appears to be always about to burst into tears or haul his hair out. I hope I don't ever need this guy to save me.. Good series however and great download and speed .. seed and share everyone.
,moortser,2010-04-07T20:22Z,"This is identical with ep 13. I've DLed 11+12, 13 and now this 14 that is 13 over again."
,moortser,2010-04-07T20:35Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441135/episodes

What's going on? There should be 4 parts of FlashForward. Where is the episode Blowback?"

,soundboy13,2010-05-03T11:23Z,This is episode 13 not 14!
,soundboy13,2010-05-03T11:24Z,This is episode 134 not 14!
,Peetness,2010-05-07T07:59Z,"@believenu It's not Ralph Fiennes, it's Joseph Fiennes. They are brothers, though.

Thanks a lot for the upload, it's great for people like me who watch everything on their ipods not their 22"" moniters, or whatever it was."
