What we have here kids, is a Movie Pack. My first one in fact. All this is,
is some of the movies that I watched recently. They may be great, or they 
may suck, I just want you to watch them too. =] Here are the movies that I
have decided to put into this 

MOVIE PACK #1


2102 (Very good movie)

Brooklyn's Finest (Meh movie)

New Moon (Ugh....)

Ninja Assassin (yay for blood)

Sherlock Holmes (very fun to watch)

Hurt Locker (most 1337 movie in a while)

The Informant! (not my thing, but some may like it)

Zombialand (also lots of fun)





Emjoy and leave lots of nice comments and remember to seed. =]
