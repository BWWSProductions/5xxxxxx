Hi guys... just follow this guys instructions and don't try to modify it to suit your own needs and you will do well.

To start off you will have to put up the initial Â£25 and you will have to use it to bet with. Once you have completed Â£25 worth of bets, win or lose, you will get the free Â£25 added to your account... if you so wish you can then transfer the Â£25 back to your card and you aren't down anything... if all goes well your Betfair account will be nicely stacked.

I have been using this system for over 2 years now and i've done quite well, I'm very nicely up... give it a go you have nothing to lose.
