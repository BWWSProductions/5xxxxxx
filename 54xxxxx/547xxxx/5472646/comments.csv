[V],poppedtart,2010-04-02T07:15Z,its done with AtomicParsley.  There are other tools that can do it as well however.
,krillert,2010-04-02T19:56Z,What encoder do you use for the convertion?
,Cespur,2010-04-02T20:10Z,"Ah, thanks. Even though I see it's yet another Command Line tool, I don't understand shit of those things. But thanks anyway!"
,krillert,2010-04-02T20:13Z,@Cespur use MetaX. It cant be easier for taging mp4Â´s
,Cespur,2010-04-02T20:45Z,"@krillert: Yeah, I've been using MetaX for a while and it's indeed awesome, but it's missing the feature to add the HD tag."
,krillert,2010-04-03T00:42Z,"@Cespur What do u mean by ""HD Tag"" ?  "
,Cespur,2010-04-03T03:19Z,@krillert: I found a way! It's shown next to the minutes: http://cl.ly/BEO
,krillert,2010-04-04T02:37Z,"@Cespur Ok.. yea. I dont use Itunes to transfer my movies. I have them on a external drive connected to my ATV. (I have patched it) :P Where did u get ""Distubia""?"
,Cespur,2010-04-04T13:07Z,"I downloaded it in .MKV and then converted to .m4v with Handbreak, I believe (so I'm not completely sure) I used this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5079373/Disturbia_[BDRip-720p-Mkv-Ita_Eng_Ac3-Sub_Ita_Eng][TNTVillage.sc"
,krillert,2010-04-04T19:41Z,@Cespur Thanks man. Been trying to stay away from converting since it take ages to do :P
,Cespur,2010-04-05T03:23Z,"@krillert Hahaha indeed, it's a real pain in the ass but now-a-days I just set it up before I go to sleep, and when I wake up it's ready!"
