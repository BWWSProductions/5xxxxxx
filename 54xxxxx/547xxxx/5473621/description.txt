 An intense portrayal of elite soldiers who have one of the most dangerous    
 jobs in the world: disarming bombs in the heat of combat. When a new         
 sergeant, James, takes over a highly trained bomb disposal team amidst       
 violent conflict, he surprises his two subordinates, Sanborn and Eldridge,   
 by recklessly plunging them into a deadly game of urban combat. James        
 behaves as if he's indifferent to death. As the men struggle to control      
 their wild new leader, the city explodes into chaos, and James' true         
 character reveals itself in a way that will change each man forever.
