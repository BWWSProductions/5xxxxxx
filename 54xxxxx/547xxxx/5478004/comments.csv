Have a great (and safe) weekend!"
,Doninbrazil,2010-04-02T22:05Z,Thanks again jwhitt. Looks like Rush and the Bamster are escalating their war of wits. Not really fair to have a war of wits with an unarmed president.

Have a great long weekend everyone.  Let the Spring festival of chocolate. sugar and cholesterol begin!"

,Mitch_Bainwol,2010-04-04T16:10Z,"Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot.

He's a drug addict that took so much oxicontin that he lost his hearing for a while (a side effect of it.)

Rush made fun of Michael J. Fox's shaking to say he was exaggerating his Parkinson's, not knowing it was a side effect of the drugs Fox took for it.

Did I mention he's a big fat idiot?

Anyway, I'm getting this one to hear what the disloyal opposition has to say. Ya gotta listen to the idiots once in a while to know how to counter the conservatives.

gObama!"

Oh you poor cookie.  Typical liberal douche.  You can't counter arguments so you have to insult the source.""

""He's a drug addict that took so much oxicontin that he lost his hearing for a while (a side effect of it.)""

Lost for his hearing for a while? Do you even know what a cochlear implant is?

""Rush made fun of Michael J. Fox's shaking to say he was exaggerating his Parkinson's, not knowing it was a side effect of the drugs Fox took for it.""

Whether or not he was exaggerating it is beside the point.  He was exploiting it.  This is old news and a very tired talking point.

""Did I mention he's a big fat idiot?""

Aw does the little lib want his bitty.

""Anyway, I'm getting this one to hear what the disloyal opposition has to say. Ya gotta listen to the idiots once in a while to know how to counter the conservatives.""

You are an emotional Obamatard and your intent to ""counter the conservatives"" rather than effectively debate them is very telling.  People like you want their way, period.  Truth, consequences and democratic processes be damned.

gObama!

He's going alright.  Going DOWN!

[T],jwhitt62,2010-04-04T23:20Z,"Mitch, you didn't counter anything conservatives stand for in your little. man-child, juvenile rant. All you did was call Rush names and continue your mindless worship of our neophyte, ill-informed, unqualified President. When you do have a coherent, counter arguments to conservatism, you're welcomed back. But until then, (which will be never, because there ARE NO coherent, counter arguments to conservatism) please keep your juvenile, petty, self-absorbed name-calling to yourself."
[T],jwhitt62,2010-04-04T23:22Z,"And by the way, Fox did confess that he deliberately doesn't take his Parkinson's medicine to ""demonstrate"" the effects of the disease. That's what Rush's point was. By those are facts and leftists are allergic to facts."
