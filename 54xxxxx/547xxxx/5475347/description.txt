Nick Mohammed brings sketches and a series of character monologues to life, in this late-night audience comedy 

series. Characters include rambling weatherman David Sunshine, and a clueless bank manager.

Series 1 was known as Nick Mohammed In Quarters. The programme has been re-named as Nick Mohammed In Bits for Series 

2...

The latest series will see Nick return to Radio 4 with his quirky character comedy featuring familiar faces from the 

first series and entirely new creations. Each half-hour episode focuses on a different character - from Mr Swallow, 

the anger management guru, to a relationship counsellor on the edge.

www.comedy.co.uk Review: 
This sketch show made a great debut we thought. Mohammed impressed us with his performance and his sharp character-

led material. Each episode introduced new characters too - keeping things fresh and original.

It certainly deserved to get a second series, so we are pleased to hear Nick will be back in a few months for a new 

series, plus the new episodes will now be 30 minutes in length, rather than 15.
