XIIMERSE is OOS by multiple delays for the entire episode. 
Included particular sample is -320+.

[They forgot to add the delay to the first few segs of 
of their parenthood as well, but we're tired of cleaning
up after people tonight.]

"Welcome to the War"

Erica finds her life in danger when she's attacked at 
home; a dangerous new member is recruited for the 
Resistance, as the Visitors shore up their defenses; Anna 
wonders why Chad hasn't followed up on his diagnosed 
aneurysm; and Ryan's concern grows over Val's "abnormal" 
pregnancy.

Enjoy :)
