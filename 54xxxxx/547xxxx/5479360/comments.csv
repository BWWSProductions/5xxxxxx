,SatansCradle,2010-04-07T04:51Z,"the screens don't look so good, it doesn't even look 720p. You sure this is 1080p?"
,x7thdayx,2010-04-07T20:44Z,Not every studio gives every movie they release to Blu-Ray the magical touch when it comes to the Video quality. I've seen many released to Blu-Ray that didn't strike me as that HQ at all.
[T],suavecito195782,2010-04-07T21:36Z,satanscradle yo what are you talking about the screens are in 1080p resolutions they look good what kinda of monitor do u have a old crt 
,JayjayAbnormal,2010-04-10T01:10Z,"I dont have an old CRT. and I doubt he does. I have a Samsung 2053BW and I definately see artifacts on those 1080p photos. I understand what 7thday is even saying but in that case it would be grainy.

In other words; nice job."
[T],suavecito195782,2010-04-11T04:23Z,well like he said not every movie is transferred to blu ray  with the top notch quality studio's like to pop these out sometimes without putting much effort its such a shame because certain movies deserve alot more attention then others if you aint happy with the quality i suggest you dont download the ps3 rips and just buy the movie me personally cant tell much of a difference between these 4gb rips and the actual blu ray disc so that answers that no one forces no one to download

,asdfg8732,2010-12-08T14:03Z,Thank you very much for this great quality
