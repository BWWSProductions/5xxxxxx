CTU is -200 ms OOS for their final segment. 

"Santa Fe" 

Ella (Katie Cassidy) discovers someone is embezzling from WPK 
and framing her for it. Panicked that she could go to jail, 
Ella investigates and starts with Jo (guest star Daphne 
Zuniga), who realizes Amanda (Heather Locklear) is up to her 
old tricks again. Meanwhile, Jonah (Michael Rady) decides to 
throw a party in the courtyard to celebrate his newfound 
success. Jane (guest star Josie Bissett) shows up to confront 
Amanda for not firing Ella and runs into Michael (Thomas 
Calabro). Lauren (Stephanie Jacobsen) is shocked after 
Michael tells her he'll reveal her secret if she doesn't 
sleep with him, so she makes a harsh decision. Riley (Jessica 
Lucas) and Drew (Nick Zano) share a sweet date.

Enjoy :)
