Things that last are often those that are allowed to grow naturally: organic talent that develops over time, nurtured along by the love of family and friends, spread by means of a grassroots effort and good old-fashioned word of mouth. That is the story of the band Chasen. With gifts honed by nearly a decade as a woship pastor, Chasen Challahan, lead singer for Chasen, built a following one person at a time while simultaneously shaping his craft as a songwriter. The band is poised to continue that growth with That Was Then, This Is Now, a melodically-driven, pop-rock musical journey that includes both upbeat tracks and worshipful moments with a clear directional focus towards God.
