This is the USA Pokemon HG and SS patched with Rudolph patch 
http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=217811

and then has the ARM7 from Pokemon Platinum to allow saving.

SS was tested for about an hr and half and worked fine.

G6 U-DISK Manager 5.1 was used to sync with no specific options, just write it.

Let me know if it works for you.  This is not needed except for old old cards.  Just patching with Rudolphs patch is enough for most cards.  The G6 just hasn't been updated in eons.


This is the G6 card it was tested on

with a passme device.

update:

kid now has 8 badges using this SS rom on G6 Lite with 0 freezes.  So I would say its workin.
