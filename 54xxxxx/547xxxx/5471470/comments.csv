,hannibal0,2010-04-02T20:05Z,"im having a problem trying to patch this, when exit SAS then copy patch to directory where SAS is i then run it as ADMIN but nothing happens, it opens a tiny new window with info of what to do but no button to patch.

can anyone advise please?"
[V],Slickinator,2010-04-03T00:54Z,well on the bottom right corner of the patch it will come up saying info and patch click patch and if u have any other av going at the time it sometimes will snag the patch as a false positive because its a patch and thinks its a hack tool and might be blocking it just go in to your antivirus=av and see if it attempted to block the patch and then just exclude it from being snagged or make it trusted and try again and u can also try in safe mode also
,Blaze_Of_Glory,2010-04-03T02:15Z,"I'm having the same problem as Hannibal. The patch window opens but there is no ""patch"" button in the bottom right corner or any other place on the window. You cannot tab to any location in the window."
[V],Slickinator,2010-04-03T11:14Z,well i just tested mine again and its working fine like i said your av or even superantispyware might be catching it make sure all ur antivirus and or spyware programs are allowing and or excluding it from scanning because thats the only way it won't work try redownloading the patch again from me with your av off and or watch all your quarintine area's as mine did have it once in it and i restored it and excluded it from scanning try again and see
,Blaze_Of_Glory,2010-04-03T18:08Z,"I still could not get the patch to work - could be 'user' error :). SO, I tried the patch you provided with 4.33.100 and what do you know, IT worked :). Thanks!"
,hannibal0,2010-04-03T18:22Z,"#slickinator=

thanks but still no joy even after deactivating my AV ans SAS, so i done just as blaze of glory and it worked just fine :-)"
[V],Slickinator,2010-04-04T08:07Z,so did you just update after it patched? well all in all i am glad it worked for u i am just baffeled why when i used everything exactly as u did and no problems
,hannibal0,2010-04-04T08:33Z,"#slickinator=
