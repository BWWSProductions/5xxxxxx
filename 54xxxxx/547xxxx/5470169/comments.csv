Strange it might kick up in a bit. Mine started slow then BAM it picked up. Am seeding all day so al be on for another 8 n a half hours"
,Malakka,2010-03-29T18:02Z,"Gee, eztv! You are a rock solid dude that one can relay on. 
Part 3 of this today, and yesterday I've just finished watching 1 & 2. 

Thank you, Sir! :)
********************

OFF TOPIC: Since I am a rookie to this (even though I am > 50 yrs old) I have to ask; how much is good manners to seed? 
Is it okay to seed so that one is even-steven (that is a quota/ratio over 1.00), or is there an unwritten ""law"" that one oughta seed, e.g. 1.4? 
Why I am asking is due to that my upload is at its maximum 100 Kb/s. (Read; it takes ages). And I do not want my computer running 24/7.

BTW: I love The PirateBay!"
,nutmaniv,2010-03-29T21:08Z,"Downloading pretty slowly for me too. Highest it got was 330 kB/s. Now it's between 30 and 100.

@Malakka

Most people just seed 1:1"
,tnekyaj,2010-03-29T23:14Z,Is anyone going to put up a version NOT from HBO Canada where it has censored the language. &$%# you Canada... 
,Malakka,2010-03-30T00:10Z,"Thanks, nutmaniv. I've done it so far. "
,dawnthief,2010-03-30T01:24Z,"Fuck, when did my country become a bunch of pussy cocksuckers.  Your going to censor this!!  

WTF CANADA - BE ASHAMED.

(no free speech - wtf did people like my grandfather fight for?)

Damn you to hell liberalfags."
,Jamester420,2010-03-30T02:10Z,"Just a heads up, I haven't watched this version but I watched it at 9 and 12:30 on HBO Canada last night and nothing was censored,all the swearing, nudity, etc.  Careful what you say about our country, it's the uploader, not our censors.  I've never seen ANYTHING censored on HBO Canada, in fact Canadian content standards are much lower than the states when it comes to nudity swearing and violence.  The CBC, the government funded nationally available network has aired shows with plenty of uncensored four-letter words on primetime friday nights before.  Let's see NBC or CBS do that!"
,islandartist,2010-03-30T07:46Z,"Yes, I just watched this last night on HBO Canada and there was NO censoring of the episode... Dang, should have used my PVR..."
,novamdm,2010-03-30T10:10Z,"I watched the 1.4gb version and didn't notice any censorship.

But yeah, this was a pretty lame shore-leave episode.  Not much action, just...""drama""."

,r3Xh4X,2010-04-08T01:59Z,"This version where the expletives are *bleeped* out seems disrespectful to the soldiers who died. They will show people, on both sides, being kill in the thousands but they won't let anyone hear them swearing.

Guess what? Soldiers swear, and in such extreme conditions even the soldiers who usually don't swear probably do. 

Whoever thought it was a good idea to *bleep* a realistic recreation of wartime events needs to get their fucking head examined."

,1stmatejohn,2010-04-21T04:18Z,"Serv-Bear - you're a retard. Libs NEVER censor!! That's why they are ""liberal"". The only ones who censor are Conservatives/Republicans - the neofascist fundamentalist christians.
Get your politics straight and recognize your own party's conduct."
,clawedthecat,2010-04-30T01:36Z,"its nice that eztv puts these torrents up however no one is seeding, I got the torrents two weeks ago (or there abouts) and have been stuck at 65% for part three and 69% for part teo.
WHY ARE PEOPLE NOT SEEDING FFS!!!!"
