      |  PgcEdit is a DVD IFO and Menu editor designed to allow the   | /
      |  modification of the navigation commands and parameters of    |/
       `  an already authored DVD structure.PgcEdit is also an         '
       .  excellent tool to learn how a DVD works, with its powerful   .

       |  PgcEdit v9 has a new function to automatically simplify the  |
       |  DVD, remove useless PGCs and commands, convert useless       |
       |  menus to dummies, etc... The resulting DVD is usually        |
       |  simpler to analyze and understand.                           |
       |                                                               |
       |  The possibilities of PgcEdit are so numerous that it is      |
       |  simply impossible to list them all. Just try it, and see!    |
       |                                                               |
       |  PgcEdit is free. However, to boost the donations, a nag      |
       |  screen is displayed during some seconds at its startup. The  |
       |  donors will receive a code to disable it.As a consequence,   |
       |  the source code of PgcEdit is no longer available. It will   |
       |  be released later, but only a previous version will be       |
       |  available. If you want to run the latest update, you must    |
       |  donate. Sorry.                                               |

       |  PgcEdit runs under all versions of Windows                   |
       |  (including Vista), and with some limitations under           |
       |  Linux.                                                       |

       |  Remember that you have to install wine on your system, and   |
       |  that the preview does not work well any more.                |
