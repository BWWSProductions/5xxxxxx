,CupidKills,2010-10-10T14:05Z,"Clean download, no viruses, and good quality; all of which are a simple standard for the FXG team.

A:10, V:10.

The movie was generally good; the only complaint I have was that it seemed to drag on far too much. The parts that actually contained some action or suspense were great, but the rest of the movie was either a bit too dry or simply boring. I'm glad I watched it, but I definitely wouldn't sit through 2+ hours to see it again."
