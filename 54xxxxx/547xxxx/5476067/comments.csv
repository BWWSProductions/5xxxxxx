As Daffy_Duck said last month:

""The key doesn't work with newer versions.
You have to download cycle 0901 or earlier (take this
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4717891/FS2004_FSX_-_Jeppview_3___Airac_0901
for example, install and activate it, and then use the new cycle to upgrade.

Don't forget to uninstall the new version first!"""
