Step 5. Copy the contents(yes all) from the cracked folder on cd 1.iso & paste it into the Game Directory
Eg: C:Program FilesEANeed For Speed Most Wanted  or something similar will be your directory.

all my torrents work. how do you think I became trusted? just cause your a noob, and can't read, doesn't mean you got to tell ppl NOT to dl my work. learn to read before you flame

2.Right Click on speed.exe and select properties.

3.Go To Compatibility Tab

4.Select Compatibility Mode for Windows XP(Service Pack 3) And Run at resolution 640x480

5.Now start your game and Enjoy!!

everything was great but I still dount understand what to do in step 5. The thing is that Im from Latvia and my English isnt goood (just dount understand) So maybe you could explane me what to do in step 5. in some diferent way!  :)

"
[T],GWpirateGW,2010-06-19T06:58Z,"@eriQeriQeriQ

np.

Step 5. go to the CD Drive where the game is in
now right click on cd drive and open
there is a folder called crack, which is on the 1st cd.

copy everything inside that folder and paste it to the game directory which depending on your OS, will look similar to

C\:Program Files\EA\Need For Speed Most Wanted.

Hope that helps.  oh and be sure when you paste you click yes to replace or copy over."

yes, I scanned the crack, I felt it was a false read, but i posted the finding in the description as I would not misinform my fellow leechers. it has cost no harm, and u can also google for a different crack as wwell.
