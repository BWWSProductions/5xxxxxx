,hannibal0,2010-03-30T19:46Z,122 seeds and not 1 comment...MMmmmm.
[T],artpepper,2010-03-30T20:07Z,"...and your point is? I already went through this paranoia bullshit on my first upload last week. 

Because I had Justified before anyone else, people assumed it must be fake. 

Check out the comments on my first upload and my other ups and spare me your snide 'Mmmm..', OK dipshit? 

I notice that like all the whiners, you've never uploaded shit. Typical. Just fuck off."
,hannibal0,2010-03-31T17:02Z,"Think your the Paranoid one not me, i was merely just commenting on 122 seed and not one comment meaning i didn't think 122 folk downloaded without leaving a comment, meant no harm by the comment whatsoever.

sorry you took it the wrong way.

and on another note, there is no need for that kind of language toward someone for just a comment as the one i left. pretty dammed harsh!

anyway thanks for the upload."
,blackburn2009,2010-03-31T17:38Z,"is this just nero 9 lite? lite sucks, safe download for anyone wondering, no virus's"
[T],artpepper,2010-03-31T18:35Z,"If I misunderstood your remark, hannibal, I apologise. However, what am I supposed to make of:

""...i was merely just commenting on 122 seed and not one comment meaning i didn't think 122 folk downloaded without leaving a comment, meant no harm by the comment whatsoever.""

No? Then what did you mean? That I somehow faked the 122 figure? My advice? When your in a hole, stop digging....and start uploading some stuff of your own.

@blackburn2009- You can read, right? See where it says 'Lite'? That means it's 'Lite'. So why ask, you idiot? Oh, I get it...just another fucking parasite who's never uploaded anything but wastes bandwidth making imbecilic remarks. Got it..."
,Bootleg84,2010-04-01T04:08Z,Drama Llama Llama Llama thanks for the DL 
,NETkoholik,2010-04-02T07:24Z,"there's no need to upload anything when you're seeding at a 1,5-2,5 ratio man.. i'm not an uploader myself, but i like to seed as a way to say thanks. that's what this is about, right? sharing.. there are people like you and there are people like me. no need to show an offensive language. be cool man, just share the way you like to share. i choose to seed.."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-02T20:17Z,"Fair enough, @NETkoholik . I'm just sick of assholes who feel free to call me a 'motherfucker' (check out the comment on my SmartDraw upload) because their crappy anti-virus (probably AVG) tells them the keygen is a 'trojan'. 

Before posting insults and insinuations and moronic quesdtions ('...is this Nero Lite?'), it would be nice if people took the time to read the info and check the poster's other uploads. Is that too much to ask? 

I'm just trying to contribute after a few years of just leeching (and seeding) and I don't take kindly to faceless twerps making snide remarks. I mean, seriously, dude...what's in this for me? 

I'm just trying to be pro-active and give something back. Why should I put up with trigger-happy assholes and idiots? I won't put up with it in the meat-world and I won't put up with it here. Do you? Anyway, I appreciate your courteous comment. Live long and prosper."
,NETkoholik,2010-04-03T01:21Z,"@artpepper ""I'm just sick of assholes who feel free to call me a 'motherfucker' because their crappy anti-virus (probably AVG) tells them the keygen is a 'trojan'.""

hahahaha damned right. as if antivirus would be indifferent to keygens (OF COURSE ANTIVIRUS WILL DETECT THEM AS THREATS).. sorry peepz, he's got a point here.."
,nobuargaoda,2010-04-05T14:38Z,"@artpepper :
nice torrent. Well done & keep up the good work!
I'm going to seed this.....

And yeah, I agree with you about those motherfuckers that wrote a statement based on AVG. Ignore them, they don't know about what is we called technology :D"
,improveurself,2010-04-08T17:36Z,"beat them hard to all these retards, artpepper!

thks for the up, man."
,abgar,2010-04-10T02:02Z,"It is a fucken VIRUS ! Even it does not install Nero, just the fucken Ask toolbar with virus insinde - that is all what You get ! .artpepper: mortal dick in your gay ass and fuck your mother with a rotten cucumber - just as your freaky father did ! "
[T],artpepper,2010-04-11T17:41Z,"Poor @abgar. Cant' spell, can't work out how the technology works, can't find his dick with a magnifying glass and can't get out of that chicken-plucking job at Uncle Gomer's broiler factory. I feel for you, dude..."
,rico98,2010-04-14T15:51Z,"artpepper lol they don't know jack i leech much but all my downloads who works, i seed as long i got the program.some times i put it on a external hd to make live more relax for my 250gig hd.but people don't download if you don't know how it works.don,t be scared and ask i still do i know much but software no i don't know much,but enough to do what ever i want 1thing i dont know is how to make a torrent because i got alot people like and i want to share"
[V],nilsm,2010-04-16T00:27Z,"I have dream of a world where people could appreciate the effort others do just to be nice to unknown fella's.

Yes this is the Light version. Perfect for some, like me.

Yes it installs the Ask toolbar thing which I guess nobody wants, but hey, You were given the choice. Be careful what you Ask (lol) for, you might get it.

No, this have no viruses. And Yes, many AV's will consider a cracker or keygen a trojan, because it have code to binary edit an .exe or whatever.

My thanks to you artpepper, whatever it will mean to you."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-17T14:26Z,"I haven't installed this myself because I don't really like Nero, but surely you get asked if you want the Ask toolbar during installation? 

If not, then just uninstall it afterwards. Lots of software does his nowadays and it's a very minor irritation."
,kinsley007,2010-04-18T07:58Z,"hey guys, cud u suggest an alternative for nero... I've tried CDburnerxp, imgburn & burnaware free.. but des softwares don keep the hidden fles hidden, I mean even hidden files r unhidden in DVD after burning... Any alternative which keeps hidden files hidden>> Pl?"
,samuelb07,2010-04-18T16:58Z,"@artpepper

Great Upload! I'll deffo seed. ignore all the noobs, they can work it out for themselves. "
,[cpu],2010-04-20T19:30Z,"Instead of copypasting, you should have put some instructions, also, not working for me"
[T],artpepper,2010-04-22T19:40Z,"@kiunsley, this is what I use. It's never let me down:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5328769/Easy_CD-DA_Extractor_Pro_12.0.8_Build_1___Crack_%28FFF%29_%5BRH%5D

The trouble with Nero is that it invades every corner of your system, whether you like it or not.

@cpu, pre-cracked means that it doesn't need any fucking 'instructions': just install it. If it doesn't work for you, too bad. It works for everyone else (including me-I installed it just to make sure it works). 

Tough luck, dude. "
,flurryous,2010-05-03T21:10Z,"@artpepper: smh... Totally misunderstand the dude, end up making an ass of oneself...

Uploading isn't the only important part of the process, kid. Leeches matter. That's the point of uploading. Seeders matter more. That's how your shit gets distributed. NETkoholik made the point clear.

And Comments matter as well. That's the point hannibal0 was trying to make. To speak on his/her behalf... The point of what s/he said was not to imply you fabricated your numbers. It's to say that, even with all these downloaders, no one had anything good, bad, confirmatory, derogatory, ANYTHING at all to say about it.

That was all.

I just hope the upload works better than your temper. At least then something relevant can be said, instead of 21 comments related to your pms backfires and nerd raging."
,sammeh,2010-06-02T23:50Z,"artpepper you FUCKING asshole, it AUTOMATICALLY installs ask.com shit, even if you untick the box...

thx for fucking my pc, i hope you get your 'trusted' status removed as you totally don't deserve it... 

worst torrent I ever download, people like you fuck up tpb!!!"
,Gnarizard,2010-06-03T01:37Z,"@sammeh: If the ""ask.com"" toolbar ""fucked"" your pc, then you, sir or madam, suck at the internet.

@artpepper: I love how you spaz at everyone and make yourself look like an asshole, but I'll download your shit anyway.
All you had to say to any of these guys was...
.........
...You're still waiting?
The answer is ""nothing"".
Don't feed the trolls, man.
The most you EVER need to say is ""all virus scanners pick up keygens as a false positive, feel free to bitch if your pc actually suffers any symptoms.""

Happy trails."
,arjen.nl,2010-06-08T22:05Z,"Hey Artpepper,

Thanks! It works 

Hey to all the others that seem not to know what they are writing about or know how to spell. 

Get a job and go out and buy the SW and than blame it on the sales guy  :)

(profanity use = Ignorance at the highest level)


Ciao"
,L.PATTERSON,2010-06-16T23:24Z,"Artpepper just installed every thing works great
thanks for the upload.To every one else respect the people that bring us these files come on......
take care  -----LP"
,DevilMan420,2010-10-31T15:45Z,this is a virus 
,Therrito,2010-12-21T19:18Z,"@ artpepper
Is it too much to ask to be nice?
Nobody likes when others flame thier comments"
,neogen45,2011-03-24T11:14Z,"Lol, so this is what I was looking for when I found this torrent: http://updatepack.nl/

Basically what it does is installs only the basic options of nero(using a nero install package you have to download elsewhere) without any of the bloatware. Check it out if you liked nero before it turned into garbage. 
Thanks again for the upload art."
,neogen45,2011-03-24T12:03Z,"Ok so my first comment didn't post. Some of these people shouldn't be downloading torrents let alone on a computer so please forgive their ignorance. This torrent is a solid win, unfortunately I can't say as much for the software. This wasn't what I was looking for but it was a simple install, product key auto-populated itself, works fine for what it is."
,GonzinFranklin,2011-03-31T14:42Z,Thank you for the DL great job on the crack if you did it.
,term0117,2011-06-15T12:18Z,"This is a virus, installs ask toolbar nonsense. "
,Therrito,2011-07-22T07:16Z,"@artpepper you have a bad attitude.
i will never download any of your torrents"
