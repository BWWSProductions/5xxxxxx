,Strikefear13,2010-03-30T12:08Z,"Actually, it absolutely is real.  The Dolphin emulator has been working really great, especially in the last year or so of it's revisions.  Plays a large number of wii and gamecube games at near full speed with a moderately good computer.  I, for example, have a 2.4ghz core 2 duo, 4 gigs of ddr2-800mhz ram and a GTX 260 video card.  I play several games including Wind Waker for gamecube and Smash Bros: Brawl for wii flawlessly."

,AZkiller7,2010-03-31T15:54Z,"yes, it doesn't, you just need to get the x86 build instead

,Hezkore,2010-04-02T05:10Z,"Why torrent this when it's faster to just visit http://www.dolphin-emulator.com/ and download?
The page btw, updates automatically as soon as a new build is released (a few times per day)"
