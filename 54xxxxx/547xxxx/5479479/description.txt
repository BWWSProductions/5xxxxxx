Doctor Who
"The Eleventh Hour"

On 1st January, 2010 the Tenth Doctor regenerated and the era of the Eleventh Doctor began in explosive style. As the TARDIS span towards Earth he yelled 'Geronimo!' and then... Well, then came the great wait for his debut adventure, The Eleventh Hour.

Now, the wait is over ...

The Doctor has regenerated into a brand new man, but danger strikes before he can even recover. With the TARDIS wrecked, and the sonic screwdriver destroyed, the new Doctor has just 20 minutes to save the whole world - and only Amy Pond to help him.

The Doctor ... Matt Smith
Amy Pond ... Karen Gillan
