wow deus!! you must have one hell of a bill then, judging by the quality of this show

i've been watchin bbc since i was 6 and could understand english (thats 17 years now, so before the interwebs) and i have never properly thanked YOU for all that... blackadder, fawlty towers, flying circus ofcourse, and much much more... THANK YOU DEUS 

anyway, thank you for making this show a reality, and i've got some ideas for a new show if you still have the cash to pay for it
[/sarcasm]

tnx uploader 
a lot of us in the netherlands love the doctor but our tv programming people don't have the sense to put it on here last time i checked "
,baybreeze,2010-07-31T22:51Z,I'm going to ignore your rude anti-American comments and take this show and enjoy it. So there Queenie!
