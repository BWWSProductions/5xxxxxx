A:V:M ---> 8.5:8.5:9.0

I would rate it 10:10, but that's DVD Quality.

This is probably just as good as DVD quality, or looks like it, but it's not.

Pretty Cool Movie, I liked It, Thanx





LONG LIVE THE PIRATE BAY !!!

,godswallops,2010-04-02T15:19Z,"Thanks - best copy so far by a country mile.

There won't be a better copy until a DVD or bluray rip is made.

The video quality on this is absolutely brilliant - props to the people who did as it really is an awesome copy.

Thanks also to PrisM for the great job syncing the audio. I only noticed one or two spots where the audio was out of sync, but it didn't last long. 

The audio is the only part that gives away the fact that this is not a DVD rip. It's that good.

The audio is a bit choppy early in the movie with the occasional drop out on the right side channel. Also the background sounds & music flare a bit, sometimes almost drowning the dialogue.

Until a DVD rip is available, this is the best.

Please note that my criticisms do not detract from the excellent work here (I couldn't do any better).

,Dicepheris,2010-04-06T11:06Z,"It's high enough quality to watch and not miss any graphic details that might be relevant to the story or movie. Once your eyes get used to the slightly imperfect quality. You kinda' stop noticing unless you remind yourself that it's a tiny bit pixelated but only if you fixate on it.  Even transferred onto a DVD on a big screen TV. It's just like watching a movie on cable TV that you can tell has been digitized and condensed.

I really, really recommend seeing it in 3D in a cinema, but if not, this is a very nice telesync.

Hi , This is no joke mate, It is a humble request from a fellow pirate.

Since you are one of the class uploader , I thought of asking you to do this for all the fellow pirates here in TPB.

I saw DIARY OF A WIMPY KID in a website, I just want you to check out if it is real. If it is real then i wish you could upload it here in TPB... , I dont want to write the link here cause it will be considered as a scam.

Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!
