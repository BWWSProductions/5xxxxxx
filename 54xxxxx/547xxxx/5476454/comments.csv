,InstantStarFan7,2010-12-14T20:58Z,Come on guys let's seed this! I'm stuck at 97 percent and that's because I am only downloading part 2 right now! I'm seeding part 1 already so let's stop running! 
,VscarfaceV,2011-10-17T12:30Z,"Perfect quality.

But the subtitles don't work. The dutch and english subs are very weird. If i play the movie in BS Player then the subtitles are just very weird. The subtitles are not in a normal language. I don't know of others have that problem too. But it is unfortunate."
,screwball17,2012-07-11T00:04Z,Spiderman 2 has the same stupid problem with the audio sync as DarkLord2011 and PenAndPike around the 51 min. mark. Does ANYONE have a good copy?
