The Shadow of an Empire is the second studio album by Irish singer-songwriter Fionn Regan, released on February 8, 2010 on Heavenly Records/Universal Records. The album's sound differs from Regan's previous album, The End of History, featuring more electric guitar-based rock songs. Regarding this change in musical direction, Regan states that "this album's lyrically quite fast, with lots of word changes and phrase changes, and it asked for a different kind of coat."
