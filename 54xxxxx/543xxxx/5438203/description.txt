John Wayne produces, directs and stars in this larger than life chronicle of one of the most remarkable events in American history. At the Alamo - a crumbling adobe mission - 185 exceptional men joined together in a sacred pact: they would stand firm against an army of 7,000 and willingly give their lives for freedom.

Filmed entirely in Texas only a few miles from the site of the actual battle, The Alamo, is a visually stunning and historically accurate celebration of courage and honour.

Co-starring Richard Widmark, Laurence Harvey and Chill Wills, and garnering seven Oscar nominations, it is a truly memorable movie spectacle.
