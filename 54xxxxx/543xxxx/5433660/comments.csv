,crni123,2011-03-20T12:04Z,is this left 4 dead 1 or 2 i dont want 2 becuse i dont have a strong computer so plz somebody tell me plz
,massrcor,2011-04-16T11:55Z,"^^ I have l4d2, and this has probably the same system requirements.

I run it pretty good on an ati radeon hd 4200, 5 gigs ram, amd athlon II x2 240, win 7 64 (not the best rig lol)
but it runs most games pretty well,including l4d2."
,massrcor,2011-04-17T07:03Z,"also, don't waste your time with this torrent, The big ass cotta.exe has a big ass 'virus' in it.
download another torrent if you want left  dead, there are CLEAN versions here."
,groozer,2011-04-18T18:18Z,when i want to install the standalone patch setup i can not click install
,COTTA,2011-05-17T22:29Z,"massrcor shut a fuck up piece of shit.

Thanks =)"
,Armstrong14,2011-09-13T23:46Z,...You need to install a rip? That makes no sense. A RIP is when you just download the game and automatically play it.
,yashgurbani04,2011-10-18T07:57Z,"Hello Cotta ,

I was very impressed by your torrent. But after downloading I extracted the compressed file and started setup. After seup, I ran the installer, entered password but it was stuck at 10%. I tried again and again on both xp & 7 but got no results. Then i downloaded your other torrent of left 4 dead (tht 900 mb one) - 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5426339/LEFT_4_DEAD__[FULL]_________[Full-Rip_COTTA]
AND GOT THE SAME PROBLEM! AGAIN AND AGAIN IT WAS STUCKED AT 10 % PLZ HELP"
,ratedloud,2011-11-01T23:19Z,Im having the same problem. Stuck at 10 percent
,ratedloud,2011-11-01T23:48Z,OK. I guess i was just being impatient lol it installed perfectly! thank you. works fine on windows 7-64 bit.
