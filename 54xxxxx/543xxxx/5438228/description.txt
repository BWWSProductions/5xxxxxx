VHS rip of classic long-form music video with rare stereo sound.  Alice Cooper performs all the songs from "Welcome To My Nightmare" plus his anthem "Ballad of Dwight Fry" in this Emmy award-winning 1975 TV special.  Vincent Price co-stars.  As a side note...if you haven't seen Alice live his concerts are as great as ever.  Go to AliceCooper.com and check out his tour schedule.  66 mins.
