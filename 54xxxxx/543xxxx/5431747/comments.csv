,SalazarAnja,2010-03-19T22:19Z,"The vid quality was so bad i stopped the movie from playing after 3minutes, i couldn't even tell if this yellow long ""things"" were corn or flowers...on the opening scene, full of little squares and so plastic picture....

STOP BEING FUCKING CHEAP AND BUY THE MOVIE!!! you won't be bitching about a/v watching this in blue ray
It's funny how people can get stuff for free and rant & rave about how's its not good enough... Its fucking free, what the fuck is there to bitch about? Extremezone thanks bro, I'm not gonna sit here and complain. You took your own free time to upload this without benefitting from it, you deserve alot more credit than these ungrateful degenerates can give. you da man EZ! ~ Big Dame "" Real Talk, all fucking day!"""

,iiiratep,2010-04-19T08:20Z,"I've seen people flaming each other on every single torrent I've looked at today. Makes me lose hope a little. But hey, thanks for the upload EZ! Lots of fast seeders on this one. :]

As for everyone fighting, just remember that if you can't practice restraint instead of lashing out every time someone says something you disagree with, you'll grow old with more enemies than friends. Taking a hit to your pride is always worth keeping the peace IMO."
,xtremnik,2010-05-03T05:40Z,"Ok I'd say the movie is about an 8 in video and a 6-7 in audio. Definitely more than watchable.

Wouldn't call it a dvdrip but its almost there, like a good looking screener.

Thanks for the upload.

Oh and yea the kid in the movie was fucking terrible what a chickenshit couldnt stop crying all the time wtf"
,VeganSausage,2010-05-12T09:14Z,"@ Big dame

I assume most people have to PAY for their bandwidth. I know I do. 

Therefore (for me at least) DLing these torrents is NOT FREE!

I for one appreciate all comments regarding the quality of the UL, especially the honest ones that still thank the ULer for his or her efforts.

What I dont appreciate is half sucked comments from dimwitted racists. 

Now go fuck yourself with a sideways pineapple"
,Samyukth,2010-05-15T08:59Z,booooring movie :-|
,SeanFMT,2010-05-18T17:39Z,"@Big_Dame
Spend more time learning tech.
It's blu-ray, not blue ray.
It's retards like you that make people lose faith in humanity.

Thanks for the UL man. Your films always rock."
,sRyder93,2010-05-19T22:07Z,"hey guys, ive been doin this for a couple years now, i think i know a good amount of downloading torrents....the only thing im not sure on is on Vista is the little computer logo in the torrent file....
what does that do? do i have to download that every time? (i have btw)"
,whatever89,2010-05-22T20:51Z,"Great  movie! I loved it, but as a warning you won't have any fun watching it. It's depressing, slow, but that's what it's meant to be. More a study of human nature then anything. Reminded me of playing Fallout 3 but without the monsters. Just vast wasteland with nothing left in it. If you like popcorn movies eg. Transformers, G.I. Joe, this won't be your thing. If you love movies like Das Boot, then you'll love this. "

Don't argue about stupid shit on the internet.

fuck ya self extremzone!!"
,DesertFlame,2010-05-29T09:09Z,"@ Lardplanet - proof pl0x? if your going to make sht up at least make it sound believable. extremezone doesn't need to bash other ppls torrents, hes already one of the most popular uploaders on tbp the crap u talk of is for nubs tryin to get more than one seeder on there torrents"
,Video_Veg,2010-05-30T17:55Z,"Torrent = Good quality, slow on my poor WiFi link. Thanks extremezone and seeders.
Movie = Slow moving post apocoliptic escapade with dreary organ music, etc. Some gory scenes and predictable storyline where nothing of real consequence ever happens. If you've seen the cover, you've seen the movie.
~  Don't watch it if you're depressed --- better yet, don't watch it at all."
,ReeMels,2010-05-31T00:52Z,"This movie is the worst fucking crap i have ever seen! i will never ever see this movie again!!! even if i gett 1000 bucks i wont! fucking shit ass crap!!

=)"
,tekrunner26,2010-06-01T13:09Z,Fast download but not worth it. So depressing. Its all about cannibalism and not much else.
,max2562,2010-06-02T17:02Z,"Please people comment on the movie without sounding like haters and idiots. And don't argue with those that do. 
It's funny, I just came back from Sweden/Denmark and the best I can tell people there don't act like immature children. It was such a nice relief to be around people that respect other people. Then I get back on here... why flame? get a therapist PLZ!

and thanks for the upload extremezone its good to see someone doing something constructive instead of destructive."
,whatever89,2010-06-03T01:22Z,"@tekrunner. this movie is not about cannibalism at all. Cannibalism is just serves as a plot device. If you watched the movie you'd realize what it's actually about. SPOILER ALERT!!!!! The movie is about a man who believes he is a good man just trying to survive in a world gone wrong, but in all actuality is not a good man at all. Throughout the movie he keeps telling his son that they are the good guys, but everytime they are in a situation where someone needs their help he refuses to help because he has lost so much faith that there is anygood left in people. He didn't help the humans in the cellar from being eaten by cannibals, he didn't help the woman and the child in the field from being hunted, he didn't want to help the old man along the side of the road, and he left a man naked and defenceless, without anything. Yet he continued to believe he was one of the good guys when he had become the very thing he was trying to protect his son from. It wasn't until his death that his son found salvation with a group of people who really were the good guys. The movie was about faith and trust. That's why I'm glad movies are usually reviewed by people who are smarter then the general public.......watch it again!"

,tekrunner26,2010-06-07T09:16Z,@Whatever89. I dont think I will watch it again. It was too depressing the first time. He is trying to stay true to being one of the good guys. It is set about 15 years after the bombs drop ( I can only guess as his son looks like he is in his early teens). There is no food left and the world is in a deep winter that it is not going to recover from in his life time or even his sons. He will starve or become one of them. He is just kidding himself if he thinks he or his son has any kind of future.

You are such a fake. You always post poor quality torrents, they are almost never DVDRip, usually TS or R5 if you are lucky! And your torrents always always have fake trackers which report huge number of fake seeders/leechers.

You should check it out for your-self. It is a well known fact that his torrents are always of shit quality and the only reason he is popular is because he uses trackers which fake the number of seeders/leechers!"

,flatusgass,2011-03-31T09:49Z,"Like I wrote before:

Why are the days of nearly 2GB (and 2+ GB) STANDARD def movies still around? These people who rip, whom get such intense ass-sucking from clueless fanboys, are not really that great at what they do. I just watched two different 720p rips I got off Demonoid, which were an unbelievable 500MB! I figured they'd suck, but I was curious as to how bad they'd blow. Well, not at all, turns out. They were indeed 720p, not fuzzy/soft, and looked miles ahead of these ridiculous 2GB standard-def rips.

Really though, why arent more films being ripped in HD like that? There are people out there who clearly know how.

MORE 500MB HD RIPS!"
