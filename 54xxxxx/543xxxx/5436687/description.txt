WinRAR - What's new in the latest version:
===========================================

Version 3.93:
---------------

   1. Bugs fixed:

      a) in WinRAR 3.92 -xd:pathfolder switch could also exclude folders,
         which path does not match the path specified in the switch
         and only the folder name is the same as specified;
      
      b) switches -y -or did not work correctly together. Switch -or was
         ignored in presence of -y.



Version 3.92:
--------------

1. If you start WinRAR command from Explorer context menu in multiple
   monitor configuration, the command dialog will be displayed
   on the same monitor as context menu. In previous versions it was
   always displayed on primary monitor.

2. WinRAR "Compress and email..." context menu command adds the archive
   name to email subject. Previous versions left the subject blank.

3. In RAR 3.91 -x switch could also exclude folders from archiving
   even if mask contained wilcard characters and did not contain a path.
   For example, -x*. excluded all those folders, which do not have
   the extension in the name. Now -x switch uses RAR 3.80 approach
   for masks without path, excluding folders only if mask does not
   contain wildcards and matches the folder name exactly.

4. Bugs fixed:

   a) WinRAR 3.91 reported the incorrect "Unexpected end of archive"
      error, when opening an empty ZIP archive created with
      "New WinRAR ZIP archive" context menu command;

   b) if "Delete archive" option was enabled when unpacking several
      ZIP archives and if one of archives was damaged, WinRAR did not
      delete archives after the damaged one, even if they were unpacked
      successfully;

   c) if file matched two different masks in RarFiles.lst, WinRAR
      could select the last match. Normally, if neither of masks
      is a subset of another, the first match must be chosen.
