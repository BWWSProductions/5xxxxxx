,HackinGeek,2010-04-10T15:27Z,"Yes you can, but unless you have a modified (jtagged) Xbox 360, they won't show up and run. These games are MODIFIED to show up as full versions, not trial. That means official m$ dashboard won't show them, because the signature is broken. Jtag only!"
,superbanned,2010-04-16T14:39Z,"Hi, will this work on Flashed ( iXtreme 1.6x+ ) boxes too? or only JTagged ones?"
,HackinGeek,2010-04-17T23:41Z,"As I wrote: It's JTAG ONLY! iXtreme means flashed DVD drive, and DVD drive has nothing to do with that. You need Freeboot/XBReboot."
