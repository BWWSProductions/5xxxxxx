George Bush once famously asked â€œIs our children learning?â€  If theyâ€™re from Bushâ€™s home state of Texas, the
answer soon may be â€œno, they isnâ€™t.â€ Conservatives on the Texas Board of Education have instituted sweeping
changes in the Texas schoolsâ€™ curriculum.  Iâ€™m a little surprised. Who knew Texas had a Board of Education? The new
social studies curriculum will put a conservative stamp on history. More accurately, it will stamp out any history
thatâ€™s not conservative.



As the nationâ€™s second-largest textbook market, Texas has enormous leverage over publishers, who make their standard
textbooks conform to the specifications of their biggest customers. Thereâ€™s free-market economics for youâ€”if enough
people are ignorant, then everybody has to be ignorant. As The Washington Monthly said, â€œwhen it comes to textbooks,
what happens in Texas rarely stays in Texas.â€  At least the textbooks should come with some kind of disclaimer. â€œThe
contents of this book arenâ€™t true anywhere except Texas.â€ Maybe the simplest textbook disclaimer would just say
â€œWarning: contents under extreme pressureâ€¦ from ultra-conservative nutbags.â€



The Texas Board of Education made some huge changes. In the world of education in Texas from now on the â€œthree
â€˜Râ€™sâ€ are going to be â€œreading, writing, and revisionism.â€. Conservatives donâ€™t like Thomas Jefferson
because he coined the term â€œseparation between church and state.â€ So the Board removed Jefferson from a section of
the Texas curriculum, replacing him with St. Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, and others. If you have no idea who John
Calvin is, donâ€™t worry. That means you probably have a pretty accurate knowledge of real American history. The board
also now requires that students learn about â€œthe conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s, including Phyllis
Schlafly, the Contract With America, the Heritage Foundation, the Moral Majority and the National Rifle Association.â€
Hey, I want kids to learn about all that stuff. Well, not so much learn about it, as be warned about it. It looks like
the only thing these Texans want anybody to remember is the Alamo. And they donâ€™t want people to remember that
accurately. The hard-right conservatives on the Texas Board of Education probably want textbooks to say that Phyllis
Schaflaly was at the Alamo.
