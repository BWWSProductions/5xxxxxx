We need setup.dat and the razor installer. way too big for a crack..."
,pastefqa,2010-03-17T13:52Z,"why 2GB ? :/
crack only - please!"
,XshareFileX,2010-03-17T13:54Z,"setup.dat
and 
razor1911 installer"
,Grihan,2010-03-17T13:57Z,"No, it is not a rip version. It's only 3 files (content.vfi, content.vfs0, sounds.us.vfs0) and Phoenix 1.3 beta. Unzip the game and replace files. Use this crack with the one from Razor1911(M2033.ProperCRACK.Razor1911.rar).
I've checked only at MILTI11 version. Hope it'll work on others!!"

,COM76,2010-03-18T02:50Z,"I amd downloading this now.  Can someone please post as to if this really does work.  And perhaps a fool proof step by step on how to do it.  Once you have all the files extracted and add the content.vfi, content.vfs0, sounds.us.vfs0 do you need to use a crack like the razor one to replace the .exe file?  2 gig is a lot for me to download if it will not work.  Thank you to the uploader also i know you  know it works but it may not work for others."
,COM76,2010-03-18T11:20Z,Finished downloading.  Followed the directions.  Used Razors exe crack.  What do you know it actually works.  Thank you Grihan you saved me 4 gig of download quata.  Good work mate.

,rcplpower,2010-03-20T09:05Z,I have downloaded this torrent but I cannot find any iso to mount...Can someone please tell me if there is a different torrent to download before I can use this one? (like do I have to download the iso of this game first?) Thanks in advance.
,pibc,2010-03-20T14:49Z,"rcplpower:

read comments."
,rcplpower,2010-03-20T18:39Z,"from the comments, ive understood you need to download an iso first; an iso thats over 6GB...i thought i could play the game with this torrent alone :-("
,dzavi84,2010-03-21T01:54Z,Ihave some problem whit X3Daudio1_7.dll files who is missing.What should I do?
,Cra5hh,2010-03-21T12:56Z,"@dzavi84 

it's direct x error.
Install DirectX 11. You will find ?install? folder inside the game installed."
,Cra5hh,2010-03-21T12:57Z,"Grihan, thanks its working :)"
,xtatict,2010-03-25T23:09Z,"Excuse me but can someone, preferably Grihan could explain little further, where we would put the iso file rather then replying as ""read the comments"".

I agree with rcplpower and still could not figure out how to unzip this files."
,xtatict,2010-03-25T23:39Z,"Well,  Thanks for making me spend my time for this garbage.

And Thanks for the shitty explanation, too dude.

Why would I d/load this 2 GB of shit if I need extra 6 GB iso file for unzip while there is 3.45GB decent repack version.
