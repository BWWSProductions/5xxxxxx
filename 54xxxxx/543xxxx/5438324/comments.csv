With more and more mobile phones supporting higher resolution videos, I think it's a necessary switch. It doesn't look bad on my Motorola Droid X, but it doesn't look good - there is a big image quality loss on a screen that's 854x480."

The video bitrate is only 128kbs as stated on the description. It looks pretty good on my samsung eternity. It was basically a test run on making mobile apps too....its only 287 mbs....I could have made it a high res at 500, but it would eat up all the memory card space as well."
