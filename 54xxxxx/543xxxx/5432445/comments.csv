THE LINK BELOW IS THE THE MARCH 19 SHOW

The people who run this site are dopes."
,VelvetMirror,2010-03-21T21:23Z,"If anyone knows where to download the torrent for the last show, please write it. "
,Tarmbosse,2010-03-21T21:26Z,"There probably isn't anyone. Nvra911's link does however work well for streaming it (at mediocre quality, of course - but its still watchable.)"
,iamrifter,2010-03-21T22:22Z,"That link didn't lead to actually playing the episode, but instead to a site that rickrolls you claiming to show the episode but instead leading to some pay movie site pushplay.com.  Actually the site seems to round robin where the ad leads you to several shady looking movie sites.  Who knows what kind of malware they hold and what kind of scam they are running.  Don't be fooled by spammers."
