Thanks again!"
,persianknight,2010-06-04T07:53Z,"Thx for the greet upload. 
i dnt have a ps2, but i downloaded Pcsx2 emulator, but cant exactly figure out how to work it. kinda need of a bios. can anyone help me out or direct me to a site that would explain how to work this so i can play the games on pc. thanks in advance."
,ThePalindorme,2010-06-05T12:08Z,"persianknight:
Dude, you could simply go and buy the ps2. This is recommended because thats how you can really enjoy the game. True..
I know you can easily find out the bios source, but configuring the emulator is the biggest headache. I for one dont know how to do it.
I saw a torrent on god of war, it came with the emulator saying that it was correctly configured for playing on  a pc. You could give it one shot.

If all else fails you could still buy the damm thing its really cheap now."
