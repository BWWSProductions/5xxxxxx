,barbaneli,2010-03-21T14:22Z,"@ ATI DX9 USERS:

After i have been getting the crash after starting the metro2033.exe i have managed to start the game on Radeon x1950 pro with Catalyst 10.2 and Win XP SP3.
I installed the ""Ati enbseries patch"" intended for the game ""Saboteur"" released by a Russian coder after reading about someone that did it on official Russian metro forum.

Same issue was with the Resident evil 5 which just would not run on that series of older Ati cards.

However the game is UNPLAYABLE even with the patch because of the black artefacts and squares and overlapping textures on large portions of the screen.

The framerate was high on low details and acceptable normal details in 1024x768 and even 1280 x 1024 (over 30ish on average) so card should be able to run the game fine.

So it is a driver issue after all. All we can do is wait for a fix be that from the developers, Ati or even that Russian guy who tweaked the Dx9 driver for RE5 and saboteur.

It's a shame that Ati drivers for ""legacy"" cards are now updated only 4 times a year.

As for the devs, if the game was not tested they should not have released those minimum system requirements. They could have just wrote ""Nvidia DX9 3.0 shader graphics card"" because the game runs fine on Nvidia equivalent older cards.

I hope this helped some people like me who just could not start the game no matter what they did."
,spalala,2010-03-21T19:12Z,"barbaneli is right. if you google """"Ati enbseries patch"" you can find it, but as the poster says its unplayable. 
I hope they will a get fix soon."
,player96,2010-03-22T16:39Z,"I have a little problem.I have installed game but everytime i try to start it says that ""The program cantÂ´t start because X3DAudio1_7.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix the problem. Can someon help me with my problem."
,Leomacedo,2010-03-22T20:02Z,"Nah...you dont need other crack.

Just use the setup...apply the patch 1...copy the exe and works great.

BTW...the requirements is bullshit...i playing in high using a core 2 duo, 9800gtx and windows 732bits.

And the IA sucks but the game is great (too dark)"
,Stalkerdauno,2010-03-23T15:44Z,@barbaneli thx so much! Still it crashes after a minute or so but still thanks at least i can start it! xD
,player96,2010-03-24T16:54Z,"I have new problem. Every time I try to start the game it says that"" your NVIDIA video driver needs to be upgraded-system can be unstable! I have tried to upgraded but my computer says that you have the best possible upgraded. Pls help and comment."

The user.cfg isn't fully functional, e.g. the function keys won't bind for some reason.  This was the same case with the Simon repack.  The Razor version wouldn't even begin the install procedure.  Thanks for the upload."
