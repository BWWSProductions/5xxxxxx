Just google around and try to find some .srt files in the language you need.
Download it and simply rename it exactly as the .mkv file (of course not the extension) so any player should pick up the subtitle file when you play the movie.
If it's not in synch try to find another .srt which fits better or try to adjust the synch in your media player.
Hope this helps.  :)"
