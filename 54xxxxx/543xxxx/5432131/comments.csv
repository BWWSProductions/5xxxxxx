The internet series was built around low (no) budget at all, just filming for a good time, then the plot actually started coming in.. which was cool, I guess. But now they have thousands of dollars, and a likewise amount of viewers, so it only makes sense to go mainstream. But still, it's Pure Pwnage, and I loved it."
,SnubbyZ,2010-03-13T18:01Z,"But yeah dude, you should label this as Season 1 Episode 1, I think they're disregarding the internet series for now, and making this their new series. Season 2 ended on a cliffhanger, and this one barely touched it. But whatever, doesn't matter; just in case you were wondering."
