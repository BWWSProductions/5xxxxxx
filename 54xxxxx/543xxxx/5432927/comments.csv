THANK YOU!!!"

,Mephisto656,2010-03-14T03:50Z,"Also on the forum Idea, I think honestly, it would have to be setup like Darmeth, as kind of like a protection issue. To keep bandwith and users down to just the one purely interested. It also would seem to help some prying eyes out. I know not all or enough, but some. "
