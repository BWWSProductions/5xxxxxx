Hi guys,
bad news, this is my very fast retirement from F1 Releases yet. I want to provide it, but i just havent much time. Yesterday i needed 10hours to have seeders besides me for my both pratices sessions
Now, i made a movie which shows you, how to watch F1 like me online. It works 100%
As you can see, i was caputring F1 from BBC website, that causes the bad quality and framedropping. There are not many tools, which can caputre desktop very good.
i hope you unterstand that
as long as it is possible to watch from bbc iplayer, nobody will release any pratice
im pretty sure, that qualify and race will still be released by the big groupes, so downloaded there

email me, if you want to

P.S. Please think about the Forum Idea, which i mentioned in the video. I think there a lot of interested  parties. Just write me an email

Goodbye
