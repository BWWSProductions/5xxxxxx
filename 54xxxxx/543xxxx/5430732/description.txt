Treasure Planet brings Treasure Island, Robert Louis Stevenson's epic adventure of bloodthirsty pirates and buried treasure, not just right up-to-date, but into the future - a future in which the spaceship Legacy is over-run by mutinous pirates, led by the cyborg, John Silver.

A combination of platform exploration adventure and space flying game, Treasure Planet takes all the most exciting parts of the film and adds it's own compelling storyline. The game sees you controlling Jim Hawkins across a series of beautifully realised locations. You'll explore derelict mines and caverns on far-off planets; investigate thriving spaceports; evade and fight enemies with a precision laser pistol and put yourself to the test among the many perils of space on your rocket powered surfboard, the high-speed Solar Surfer.
