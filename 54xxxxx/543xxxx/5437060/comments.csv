,jon4fun,2010-03-16T23:25Z,"EXCELLENT.
Thank you for the encode/upload 20-40.
I've been waiting for this one.

Will wait a little longer though as I see you are still the only seed and don't want to slow anything down.

@ ALL downloaders: This is a 10 part series so please don't be assholes. SEED!

Cheers
Jon"
,jjabrams,2010-03-17T03:01Z,Its ok to join the initial swarm - Just seed to AT LEAST a ratio of 1:1. And its also better if you can upload fast (not sure what is considered fast because if you're from japan 100mbps upload is only normal!)
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-17T10:01Z,"Thanks guys. Small-encoding was actually done more than a day before this one, but I was thinking ""Why in hell are XviD episodes 525 MB?"" Having one season on 1 and 1/2 DVD-R somehow bothers me, always did... in fact.
I encoded episode for myself, tweaked video and audio and... decided to up this one first.
In my opinion, quality is sensational, but my small-sized version would be upped sometime today (it's busiest day in my schedule).
Well, as I said before I hope that someone find this file-size useful, because ""The Pacific"" is definitely a ""keeper"", for times to come.

@jjabrams:  Regarding initial-seeding anyone who has at least 50 kB/s upload speed could join to initial-swarm. Members of initial-swarm must not care about ratios, speeds and such crap, they should be generous people with fast connections - that's all...
And do you know how many of them comes here? 22, someday 27... and 10000 morons who jump-in in initial-seeding and clog and choke and screw up not just me but anybody else.

Regarding Japan, I am on-line from 1998 - 24/7... and I have never seen really fast Jap, not even ""disguised"" one, never. In matter of  torrents, of course."
,lilars26,2010-03-18T16:33Z,Thanks 20/40.  :-)
,lilars26,2010-03-18T18:48Z,Just started watching this and I had to come back and tell you WOW...well done.
