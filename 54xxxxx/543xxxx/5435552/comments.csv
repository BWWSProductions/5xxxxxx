""I will download and have a look."" as Empornium used to say. 9020 seeders and no comments about it being the wrong episode sounds far fetched."

,Drejo,2010-03-19T07:32Z,"My downloader locks up when I try to use this torrent. It happens once in a while with some torrents (not often, but those torrents that cause the program to freeze do so every time).
Anyone else have this problem (with this torrent)?
Or know what causes it?
I use Azureus 2.5.0.0"
