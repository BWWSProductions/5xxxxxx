,whiskey_bob,2010-03-19T08:08Z,"Yes, it's my gear. .. I changed the enviroment settings for my sound card and the audio started working... I have the same problem with flash audio. Sorry to rag on your release. Thanks for the up."
[T],agentpiratebay,2010-03-23T02:04Z,its good to know that. i can't blame you because there are too many fakes on piratebay and i don't have pages of uls to get a skull. but i'll do the best i can:D
