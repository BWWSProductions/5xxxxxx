  Garland's novel centers on a young nicotine-addicted traveler named Richard,
  an avid pop-culture buff with a particular love for video games and Vietnam
  War movies. While at a hotel in Bangkok, he finds a map left by his strange,
  whacked-out neighbor, who just committed suicide. The map supposedly leads
  to a legendary island paradise where some other wayward souls have settled.
