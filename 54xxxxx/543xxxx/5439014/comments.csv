[T],FaeGiN,2010-03-17T16:54Z,"Just the same as the other crap audio releases around.
This is the same audio line. Until someone gets a better source then this and others like it will be just different recodes of the same material... still, watchable.
Oh not not you with the religious propaganda again is it...?
lightmiddleway. Great :)
That'll solve all the problems of humanity mate. Great thinking. Well done.

and it plays back with great sound and video. I would expect a better review coming from
a trusted uploader knowing the excellent quality of these files."
,bychance,2010-03-21T02:39Z,"O.K. FaeGin, I've played it again and to be fair to you there is slight distortion in the voice
 audio when played at high volume. But you'ld want to be hard of hearing to play it that
 loud. By the way, thanks for the movie RH."
