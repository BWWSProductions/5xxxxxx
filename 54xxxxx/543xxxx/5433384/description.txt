The Bangles, two albums, Diffrent Light 1985 and Everything 1988. (With covers)

The Bangles are an American pop group formed in Los Angeles, California in 1981 and was active until 1990 and then from 2000. The group was formed as Supersonic Bangs, which was shortened to The Bangs. They were then forced to change the name when a girl rock band from New Jersey, said they had the right to that name.

Originally The Bangles were singer and guitarist Susanna Hoffs, born January 17, 1959, sisters Debbi Peterson (drums), born August 22, 1961, and Vicki Peterson (guitar), born January 11, 1960, and Annette Å½ilinskÃ¡ on bass. In 1983 Å½ilinskÃ¡ left the group and was replaced by Michael Steele, born June 2, 1958, who had previously played in the band The Runaways.

The Bangles were most successful in the second half of the 1980s, with songs like "Manic Monday" (written by Prince under the pseudonym "Christopher") that reached second place on the U.S. Billboard chart and "Walk Like an Egyptian" (# 1). They also had success with a remake of the Simon and Garfunkel song "A Hazy Shade of Winter" (# 2) 1987 and â€œEternal Flameâ€ (# 1) 1989. That same year the group disbanded, but reunited to tour in mid 2000 and  three years later released the new album Doll Revolution. (Wiki)
