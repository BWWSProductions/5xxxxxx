Ken & Rick Burns New York Edu. Resource â€“ Documentaries, E-Books, Music

Although familiar with KEN Burnsâ€™ many famous documentary series, many people are unaware that his brother ALSO makes documentaries, and they often collaborate. Shortly before the WTC attack in 2001, Rick Burns completed a 7-part magnificent PBS series on the history of New York City. Following the attack, he added an 8th part dealing with the building of the Twin Towers, and their subsequent destruction. There is footage of the attacks here that I have never seen anywhere else. The series doesnâ€™t really concentrate any time on either the Brooklyn Bridge or the Statue of Liberty, as brother Ken had already done documentaries on both.

What I have done here is to place the entire Burns Brothers series of NY-related documentaries in one large torrent, along with a more complete BBC documentary on the Brooklyn Bridge and 3 excellent e-Books describing the city, the Empire State Building, and the Subway system. I have also torrented each episode individually already, but they donâ€™t seem to be staying seeded very well. For the sake of flavor, I am also including an edited-to-remove-the-commercials .mp3 file (as much of it as I have, anyway) of the Howard Stern Radio Show from the morning of the attacks. These have also already been torrented individually. Finally, by way of fun and weirdness, I have added a nifty little assortment of New York related pop songs, comedy, radio broadcasts, and historical music to round out the torrent.
