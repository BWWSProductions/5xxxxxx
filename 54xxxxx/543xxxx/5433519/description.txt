Release notes:

The second album from Australian singer-songwriter Gabriella Cilmi is inspired
by music from the 1980s and was recorded with producers including Greg Kurstin
(Lily Allen, Little Boots, Flaming Lips), Dallas Austin (TLC, Gwen Stefani,
Michael Jackson) and Xenomania (the production house behind Girls Aloud and the
Sugababes). Ten features the single "On A Mission", a song that initiated
Cilmi's move away from the stripped-down acoustic style of her debut album
Lessons To Be Learned.

Enjoy!
