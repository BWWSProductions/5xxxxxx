This is not my rip. once again i dug through the depths of the internet & found another r*pidshare gold mine. it's just a pain in the ass to dl 8 to 15 separate files & piece them together so i did the work for you & up'd it here as a torrent. Thank you to the original file creator, im glad i could find this because i love the 42nd street trailers! i also have Volume 5 (dvdrip) which i will be uploading very soon.
