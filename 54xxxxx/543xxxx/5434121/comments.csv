[T],renman,2010-03-15T16:24Z,Various sources mainly the HDTV ones. can't be more specific sorry
,Vossiej,2010-03-15T18:17Z,Downloaded this one and it has good quality when you watch it on an iPod!
[T],renman,2010-03-15T21:37Z,glad you like it but be warned episode 8 and 9 aren't quite so good as they came from a different source. I have since got a HD version of episode 8 but yet to convert for mobile. Want episode 10 now but the only ups are fakes
,Vossiej,2010-03-23T08:14Z,When will you get the episodes that are left?
[T],renman,2010-03-25T18:19Z,Got proper episode 8 and 9 now so I'll convert and up shortly but am waiting for 10 so I'll probably up when I have all 3 for mobile format
