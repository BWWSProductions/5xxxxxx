Blood 2 - The Chosen

_-General information-_

This is a fully working Blood 2 - The Chosen torrent which tested,
virus and spyware free and easy to install! This is my first Torrent!
After a friend showed me how to do WinRAR installers I decided to do 
my first upload here!


_-Game information-_

Blood 2 is a oldschool First Person Shooter. It's in a way 3D
and pretty fun to play. It doesn't need a cracked launcher and
it's fully Vista/Windows 7 compatible (tested, it works)


_-Installation-_

-Open the File with WinRAR
-Run the Blood.part01.exe
-Install the game on your main drive (for example C:, 
 this is for Vista and Windows 7 Users really important!)
-Go to the Folder where you installed it and create a Desktop Shortcut


!-DONE-!



_-Notes-_

The File is password secured, the pssword is:

dobermann

If you want more releases of games put a comment with your suggestion under
this torrent and I see what I can do!

Sorry if there are some grammar mistakes, my english is really good but I'm not
english!
