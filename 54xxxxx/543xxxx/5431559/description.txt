        Toby Buckland offers advice on roses as he plants them       
        around a pergola at Greenacre, and Castle Howard's head      
        gardener Brian Deighton gives an insight into the varieties  
        grown around the stately home. Carol Klein uncovers the      
        history of the iris family at Glebe Cottage, explaining how  
        their root types give important clues as to which            
        environments they thrive in.
