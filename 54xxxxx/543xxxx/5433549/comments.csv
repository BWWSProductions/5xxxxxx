This is not what it says it ""covers"" ... it is SW Florida (Withlacoochee River to 20 mi south of Key West) as depicted in the map above.

To use it do the following:
1. You will need your Card ID. Get it like this:
   a. Put the card into the GPSMap 640
   b. Hold your finger on the upper right of the screen
   c. Power on (keep your finger on the screen). If it does not reboot then switch modes and hold your finger in place (can use car or boat mode).
   d. You will get a data screen. Touch Next twice. See the Card ID shown as ""Serial"".
   e. Move the SD card to your computer (below I used e:)
2. download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3924373/Garmin_Keygen__made_by_JetMouse_
3. Run the .exe (it is safe --- I virus checked it with Avast!)
4. Enter the Card ID into the top box and click Generate.
5. Under ""Select Map Product"", click the drop down and select .
6. Enter the number 487 for the MapID code and click Generate for that.
7. Swipe and ctrl/c the unlock code that gets displayed for the ""your map unlock code""
8. Notepad e:\Garmin\GMAPSUPP.UNL (where e: is where your SD card is)
9. Paste in the value from step 8 and save the file.
10. Copy the gmapsupp.img from this torrent to e:\Garmin
11. Be sure to use Safe Removal to be sure the data was written to the SD card.

You should now be able to put the SD card into your GPSMap 640. Select Charts/Navigation Chart. Zoom out until you can see all of Florida and you will see the outline of the map data for VUS011R."
,funnyq,2010-09-17T16:44Z,"Opps, I was not clear above.

In step 5: select  (at the bottom of the list).

In step 8: Make a folder called Garmin in the root of the SD card. Then Start/Run/Notepad e:\Garmin\GMAPSUPP.UNL (where e: is the location of the SD card). If GMAPSUPP.UNL does not exist, Notepad will create it. Don't make a mistake by copying the GMAPSUPP.UNL file from a torrent over the top of the one created by you."
,funnyq,2010-09-17T16:56Z,"If you are loading a map where they did not give you the map ID, get it this way: use GmapToolSetup055.exe (get it from http://www.anpo.republika.pl/download.html), open the .img file, click ""Info"" and search for ""FID""."
