Unpacking the first list of .rars leaves me with 
* unl-g5to.rar
*unl-2010.nfo
*file_id.diz
(So far so good right?)

When trying to upack the .rar further I get 

unl-gsbe.exe (Which is the good stuff) 

but when trying to either run or extract the .exe, I get an error that I am missing unl-g5to.r00 

Not sure where I can go from here?

You need to extract each initial .rar (Click the top ne, hold SHIFT and the click the bottom one. Right click, extract here)

Thanks Lads.
