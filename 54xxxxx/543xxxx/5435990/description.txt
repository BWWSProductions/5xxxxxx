   Release Notes:

   Who needs backstory? Who needs resource-gathering? Diplomacy is so       
   last year. Gratuitous Space Battles cuts right to the chase of sci-fi    
   strategy games, and deals with large, completely unjustified space       
   battles between huge opposing space fleets.                              
                                                                            
   Gratuitous Space Battles combines the visual appeal of an RTS, with      
   the addictive unit-placement and design gameplay from tower defense      
   games. In GSB, the player does not control individual ships at all       
   during battle. The ships fight to a pre-determined set of orders and     
   formations given to them by you before the battles.                      
                                                                            
   GSB casts you as supreme space admiral, tasked with the design of        
   individual spaceships, and the composition of your fleet, as well as     
   general orders of engagement. This is not a twitch-based real time       
   arcade game like many an RTS, but a game of careful thought, planning    
   and big-picture strategy. Huge space battles can be won or lost          
   depending on just how cleverly you balanced the needs of defensive       
   shielding and armor against the expensive punch of laser cannons and     
   plasma torpedoes.                                                        
                                                                            
   GSB also features an innovative multiplayer challenge system. You can    
   upload your ultimate fleet to serve as the enemy to other players, and   
   keep track of how many other players have won and lost against your      
   challenge. That way, you will never run out of cunningly designed        
   enemies to battle against!                                               
                                                                            
   4 different unlockable player races                                      
   Over 40 different ship hulls                                             
   Over 120 spaceship modules                                               
   Choice of skirmish vs AI, never-ending survival mode or play against     
   other players fleets with the online challenge system                   
   Play with different rules as each battle has different spatial           
   anomalies to deal with.

   =========================================================================

   1) Added flickering and slow growth in visual effect for missile flares. 
   2) Improvements to performance of various bits of the battle screen.     
   3) Fixed bug that rendered the module icons for ships on the             
   deployment screen unclickable.                                           
   4) Added a new tutorial pop-up to explain that you get more honor when   
   re-fighting a mission.                                                   
   5) Slight improvements to some cruiser explosion effects.                
   6) Fixed a graphical bug where some turrets seemed to fire but no        
   bullets would appear.                                                    
   7) Fixed graphical glitch with pulsing text on text edit boxes.          
   8) Stopped the current scenario details reloading every time you         
   scroll on the battle screen.                                             
   9) Fixed hang on start-up involving multi threading message checks on    
   certain PCs.                                                             
   10) Fixed crash bug when you hit the delete key on deployment screen     
   whilst also dragging a ship.                                             
   11) Fixed range indicator UI on deployment screen so they are the        
   right size now...(oops)                                                  
   12) Added new tribe-specific debris, so they don't re-use another races. 
   13) Changed the tribe and alliance engine glow particle effect to be     
   less blocky                                                              
   14) Changed engine glow effect so it oscillates smoothly in size         
   rather than flickering suddenly                                          
   15) Fixed minor rendering bug on the deployment screen (window 3d        
   highlight was wrong)                                                     
   =========================================================================
   version 1.32                                                             
   1) Performance: Speed increase for drawing the deployment screen.        
   2) Bug Fix: Fix for design picker scroll buttons not always working      
   right if you have used the design filter buttons.

   challenge browser screen.                                                
   4) Usability: Various Improvements to range-setting UI on the            
   deployment screen.                                                       
   5) Performance: Differential challenge data downloading means that

   6) New Feature: Fleet overlay UI for the battle screen showing every     
   ship on your fleet and it's current status.                              
   7) Bug Fix: Shield modules that are destroyed no longer count towards    
   calculating shield resistance.                                           
   8) Usability: Mouse cursor now changes to the hand icon when over

   even if ordered not to attack a certain class, providing that no other   
   suitable targets are in range.                                           
   11) Bug Fix: Fixed missing hulk for the rebel atlantis bomber.           
   12) Bug Fix: Fixed bug where armor module reduced effectiveness          
   through stacking was not always calculated correctly for UI purposes.    
   13) Bug Fix: Apostophes in challenge map names and taunts are no

   =========================================================================
   version 1.33                                                             
   1) Bug Fix: Fixed bug where the challenges didn't update their           
   ratings, attempts and so on, when you clicked refresh.                   
   =========================================================================
   version 1.34                                                             
   1) Bug Fix: Fixed calculation bug regarding targeting boosters so they   
   work correctly now.                                                      
   2) New Feature: Fighters returning to carriers now return to that        
   module's location rather than the ships center.                          
   3) Bug Fix: Fighters hopefully no longer 'stutter' in their movement.    
   4) New Feature: Missiles now launch on top of parent ship if observed,   
   and MRV style decoys launch smoothly from the parent missile now.        
   5) Bug Fix: Moved debug files to an offshoot of mydocs so they are      
   always writeable, and fixed some minor debug reporting issues.           
   6) Bug Fix: Fixed bug where tutorial highlighted the wrong window on     
   the ship design screen.                                                  
   =========================================================================
   version 1.35

   =========================================================================
                                                                            
                                                                            
   THE TRIBE EXPANSION:                                                     
                                                                            
   The galactic war has gone on long enough. There is only one power in     
   this galaxy that has the common sense to bring the fighting to an end,   
   and now that power is about to be unleashed. Ladies, Gentlemen,          
   Entities, I present to you the almighty power of the pan-species         
   collection of idealistic space-hippies and bringers of galactic peace    
   (through a short-term period of intense furious stellar warfare) - The   
   TRIBE.                                                                   
                                                                            
   The Tribe are the latest race to enter the fray in Gratuitous Space      
   Battles. Known for their patronizing attitude and their use of kinetic   
   weapons, plus their cunning ability to somehow squeeze auto-repair       
   systems into frigates, the tribe are here to sort out the warring        
   factions and bring peace in our time.                                    
                                                                            
   The Tribe is an expansion pack for Gratuitous Space Battles. It's for    
   people who have played the original game enough that they crave new      
   ship designs and scenarios, and want more variety in the game.           
   Expansion packs and DLC often get a bad press, so I'll be 100% up        
   front about exactly what this pack contains and let you decide for       
   yourself if you think it's worth getting:                                
                                                                            
   What The Pack Contains:                                                  
                                                                            
   11 New ships. 4 Cruisers 3 Frigates and 4 fighters, all in a new         
   graphical style by the same artist who did the original GSB artwork.     
                                                                            
   1 New weapon type: The kinetic weapon. Basically autocannons,            
   howitzers etc. These fire rapid-fire bursts which are good at short      
   range, not so good at long range                                         
                                                                            
   Enhanced repair modules. The tribe are great at repair, and their        
   repair modules are race-specific and out-perform everyone else's.        
                                                                            
   New ship bonuses. The tribe ships have only half the shield and armor    
   strength of everyone else, but they have twice as strong hulls as        
   their opponents. This means Tribe ships seem to be on-fire and falling   
   apart for half the battle. It also means you need to re-think your       
   tactics.                                                                 
                                                                            
   2 New Scenarios. Two maps for you to fight against the tribe, or for     
   you to use in uploaded challenges with whichever fleet you like.         
                                                                            
   What The Pack does NOT contain:                                          
                                                                            
   Completely new gameplay modes, and major features that change how the    
   game plays, any new AI orders... basically anything that is not listed   
   in the list above. This is basically a data-pack with new ships, not a   
   sequel or gameplay re-write.                                             
                                                                            
                                                                            
   THE ORDER EXPANSION:                                                     
                                                                            
   Be warned heathen un-believers. The Galaxy is not your plaything.        
   This galaxy was created in a weekend by the one true god, and he has     
   no room in it for the likes of heathen aliens such as you. If your       
   species is not listed in the holy book of the one true god, then it's    
   pretty clear you are a mistake, and the order is here to rectify         
   mistakes. For is it not written (depending on translations) that the     
   total destruction of all alien species with devastating radioactive      
   cannons and nuclear space-missiles is the will of the one true god? So   
   say us. So say The ORDER.                                                
                                                                            
   The Order is the latest species in the universe of Gratuitous Space      
   Battles. The order are here to do gods work, and it's done primarily     
   through nuclear missiles, limpet mines and radiation guns. Apparently    
   leafleting and hymns just didn't get the job done. In any case, the      
   order have you in their sights. Prepare to be crushed alien swine.       
                                                                            
   What The Pack Contains:                                                  
                                                                            
   10 New ships. 4 Cruisers 3 Frigates and 3 fighters, all in a new         
   graphical style by the same artist who did the original GSB artwork.     
   The order ships use tractor beams to keep the different components       
   together. Girders are so 2450's.                                         
                                                                            
   4 New weapon types:  The radiation gun does impact damage plus ongoing   
   internal radiation damage as its effects devastate your ship from the    
   inside. Nuclear missiles provide the same entertainment in missile       
   form. Firefly rockets give normal cruiser rockets a boost of speed,      
   and lastly, cunning anti-fighter limpet mines latch on to incoming       
   fighters and drag them down to speeds where everyone can take pot        
   shots at them.                                                           
                                                                            
   New ship bonuses. The order ships have pretty poor engines, but those    
   big green throbbing powerplants kick out more juice on order ships.      
   What could you design given more power and less speed? The order is      
   your opportunity to find out.                                            
                                                                            
   2 New Scenarios. Two maps for you to fight against the order, One is a   
   normal map, but with the fun and games of a nice aesthetically           
   pleasing 3D style asteroid field (does not affect gameplay but looks     
   cool), and the other is a 'survival' mode match where you play last      
   ship standing and try to score higher than other players in the global   
   high score table.                                                        
                                                                            
                                                                            
   RIPPED: Nothing
