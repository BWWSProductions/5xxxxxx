It depends on the Media you're using: Nero, VLC, BS Player Pro and the ""others"" Winanp, WM Player.
I strong suggest you to have the first 3 ones, you'll find here with keys.
On the other hand, this version was seeded from a Japanese, with 400 movies of ""Sword, Martial Art, History"" of Japan and I am sure I didn't change anything.
Keep seeding."
,nikko1,2010-03-18T03:27Z,Subtitles are not in English. seems to be Portuguese.

Yes, I've cecked it out, VLC does not work on this Musashi. 
I opened it with Nero 4"

Exactly, Portuguese.

The Quality is not good, but for who loved Budo's Gender, this is nice to see. A concetrate movie. There are also in 4 or 5 chapters, NHK I will post it here and another one, but I need solve something on my laptop"
