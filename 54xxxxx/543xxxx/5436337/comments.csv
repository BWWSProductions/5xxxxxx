[V],Ltt_01,2010-03-17T10:57Z,"Once again : error of the description 
the contents of this torrent are well a ""Sherlock Holmes""
thank 'CorE FreaK'  for your remark "
,forwhom,2010-03-25T00:25Z,"I downloaded MKV to DVD converter, so i could burn it to a DVD, but it´s a trial version, and it says, that it only supports a limited amount of subs, anyone know wich (can´t see it anywhere) or anyone know of a better converter??"
,zilexa,2010-04-28T00:41Z,"Although picture quality seems amazingly perfect (checked first minute), this encode won't be played back using DXVA hardware acceleration on my Ati HD 3200/780G so probably it won't work with any hardware playback.

Conclusion: it is a very good rip! Plays fine in Media Player Classic. But not compliant to DXVA standards, therefore your CPU will be needed for playback. 
Wich is still fine! But I want silent pc during playback, thus prefer something that can be played back by (integrated) videocard (via dxva/Media Player Classic Home Cinema/XBMC). 
Too bad! thanks! Will try the 6700 MB version, a lot bigger unfortunately. If I see no quality difference on my 720P I might still watch this 4,5GB version."
