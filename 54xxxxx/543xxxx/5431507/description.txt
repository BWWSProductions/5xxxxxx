West Pole (1969) Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Steve Miller Band 
 
West Pole 

Following on the heels of the release of "A Night At the Family Dog" and "Go Ride the Music", this 2008 release brings together the final program from noted music critic and Rolling Stone co-founder Ralph J Gleason, covering the San Francisco psychedelia scene of the late sixties and early seventies. 

"West Pole", originally airing in 1969, features a diverse range of acts including Ace Of Cups, Sons Of Champlin, the Grateful Dead and the Steve Miller Band performing live in various settings and takes a more analytical view of the music and the times. The sound quality (upgraded from its original mono to 5.1 Surround) is excellent.
