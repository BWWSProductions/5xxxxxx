F G coming along slowly...in fact it is often showing to up faster than it is dling at times....my connection I suppose..I never mind waiting...At the moment saying it still will take me another day to get...maybe I disable my schedular for this one and don't do any thing else on comp for a while...6am here now....Still uping the big Chill..and the mentalist..:-)"
,valu59er,2010-03-14T04:30Z,Ok got my Fathers Glory ....the subs didn't come through tho-..I must of done some thing wrong...
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-14T07:08Z,"@valu59er: Yes, you've get the subs too. They are in the same folder as the movie (mp4) and have .srt extension.
If you click on ""Files"" in upper left page corner of every torrent - you can see exact content.
Just use VLC as player (in ""Video"" you can turn subs on-off and choose the language)."
,valu59er,2010-03-14T07:33Z,"I had gone to vidio with vlc player and clicked on sub title track..and.. just got a whole lot of folders pop up but none of them when I opened them had the subs in them...
I don't get so much about how this works I will have to find some one to show me I guess..
Thank you for movie any way I will get it worked out sooner or later"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-14T08:05Z,"Well, VLC loads subtitles automatically, if they have the same file-name as the movie file - but only have different extension. For instance, here we have:
/La.gloire.de.mon.pere.1990.H264[PC.Mac.Xbox.PS3.ipod].en.srt 99.12 KiB 
/La.gloire.de.mon.pere.1990.H264[PC.Mac.Xbox.PS3.ipod].mp4 375.54 MiB 
/La.gloire.de.mon.pere.1990.H264[PC.Mac.Xbox.PS3.ipod].nl.srt 101.15 KiB 
/La.gloire.de.mon.pere.1990.H264[PC.Mac.Xbox.PS3.ipod].pt.srt 100.04 KiB 

everything is fine, undoubtedly OK, and when one starts to play movie-file (mp4) ALL subtitles are loaded in the same moment. Languages (two letter code in file name - does not appear in VLC player, but does in Media Player Classic (but MPC has totally different setup). So, one MUST have/do two things in VLC:
1. In ""Video"" menu, in ""Subtitles tracks"" UN-MARK ""Disable""
2. Choose the right language by choosing Track 1, Track 2 et.c.
Thats all.
Maybe your VLC is screwed-up. Delete the Settings folder in ""Documents and settings""  Application data VLC and play the file again.
If it works here, now and as I have explained - it would work anywhere and for anyone."
