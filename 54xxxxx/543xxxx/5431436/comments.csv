,BarrySoetoro,2010-03-13T00:00Z,Tracker must be screwed up...
,BarrySoetoro,2010-03-13T00:01Z,Maybe the Obama admin took over TPB...
,WarrenZ,2010-03-13T00:04Z,Barry: Give him time. He just hasn't got around to it yet.
,BarrySoetoro,2010-03-13T00:09Z,"WarrenZ: I think you're right... if Obama were running this show, we'd all be stuck at 0.1%"
,WarrenZ,2010-03-13T00:31Z,Plus your download will then be taxed and given to someone less fortunate then you.
