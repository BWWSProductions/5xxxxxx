by the way thx"
,CellorDoor,2010-03-13T17:22Z,forgot to ask about saturday pratice? didnt see it at all
,Durgon,2010-03-13T17:24Z,I followed your torrents last year. Thanks TDMK!
,tdmk1,2010-03-13T17:33Z,"Yep, I'm back for the whole 2010 season for F1 & MotoGP too... :)

I'm not planning on capping the practices because the interactive 'red button' stuff can't be recoreded easily on my setup... 

If people really want them I could grab them from the BBC iPlayer site & upload them too - I have limited bandwidth though so I'd probably have to up them _after_ I've seeded the Qualifying & Race... :("
,fezp,2010-03-13T17:45Z,pls do 1 red button feature? i live in aust. therefore get no access to it.
,CellorDoor,2010-03-13T17:46Z,"i often try to grab f1 from iplayer, but i doesnt work
can you explain how to do that?
mfg"
,fezp,2010-03-13T18:10Z,"do you live in the UK? cause if you do i can help (even though i dont..) if you dont.. then you're in the same boat as me, i know what needs to be done to get it to work but i can't do it myself atm im searching the net still to find a way."
,tdmk1,2010-03-13T19:00Z,"I am in the UK so do have access to iPlayer - Users outside of the UK can't get iPlayer content as you have to be a UK Television Licence payer to get access...

There are ways of proxying the connnection but I suspect they'd notice if an IP suddently had loads of concurrent connections! ;)
"
,CellorDoor,2010-03-13T19:01Z,"i´m not from uk but i can play bbc iplayer with proxy
i just cant download files without DRM"
,resonator,2010-03-13T19:25Z,"Thank you tdmk1, it's great to hear from you again."
,sbrown0903,2010-03-13T19:46Z,Welcome back TDMK for another year - from across the pond - Newfoundland
,tenretni,2010-03-13T19:52Z,THANK YOU UL!!!!!
,earlrue,2010-03-13T21:53Z,"you made my day!!
bbc f1 coverage is by far the best. living outside uk as hardcore fan really sucks... 
thank you for the great job! see you for another 18 weekends...yipiiee"
,tdmk1,2010-03-13T22:09Z,"We have crap weather, pay far to much tax & our companies are all in foriegn hands - but we have the BBC... ;)"
,Cock_Pushup,2010-03-13T23:13Z,"Thanks a ton, tdmk1! You wouldn't believe how bad the American broadcast of this was. "
,castic,2010-03-14T00:24Z,I was able to watch this week's practices because of CellorDoor (thanks!) but I would love it if you would upload practices of future events -- even if it's after the main race or whatever.  Thanks!!
,0wizard,2010-03-14T00:28Z,thank you TDMK1! I look forward to another great season!
,Bidissy,2010-03-14T00:50Z,"Thanks a lot, good release, and in good speed.

I think you could crank the resolution up a bit, even with the same bitrate it would probably make a better picture.

I'm looking forward to the race, and I hope to see a good release followed by a great one :-)"
,Huarachi,2010-03-14T03:22Z,"Firstly, thank you tdmk1. I'm from London and I used to watch the whole season on TV with live timings but now I'm 5000 miles and well, its tricky. I really appreciate what ur doing and it sounds like you know yor technical shit too. Practice seasaons would be great if you can be bothered. Again, thank you."
,srr37,2010-03-14T05:49Z,Woo - i'm as giddy as a schoolgirl
,bradfa,2010-03-14T15:23Z,"I concur about raising the resolution slightly.  It could help a little bit on the picture quality.
Other than that, nice job! :) Keep up the good work!"
,exile21,2010-03-14T17:35Z,no audio - even with VLC !!!
,tdmk1,2010-03-14T18:00Z,"@exile21 - I can only guess you're missing some codecs - try the Combined Community Codec Pack at;

http://www.cccp-project.net/"
,tdmk1,2010-03-14T18:01Z,"@bradfa - If I bump it up it could cause problems with XBMC & the iPhone compatibility... I'll have a play with the settings before Round 2, Australia..."
,bradfa,2010-03-14T18:18Z,"@tdmk1:
Ah, didn't realize the iPhone compatibility was a limit on resolution.  I understand.
Regardless, thanks for the stream! :)"
,bradfa,2010-03-14T18:24Z,"@tdmk1:
Found interesting article on ARStechnica about iPhone supporting movies with resolutions larger than 640x480, might be of interest?

,mrvain32,2010-03-14T18:48Z,"when can we generally expect you to upload the real race[not qualifying etc]. That very day or the next day? So that we all be prepared as when to expect. Please respond...

Thanks for uploading though I haven't downloaded anything."
,srr37,2010-03-14T19:40Z,"@exile21- I had problems if watching from flashdrive but it worked if I moved file to harddrive.

@mrvain32- watch the 1st half of this- lots of interesting new season info."
,moonlistener,2010-03-14T20:21Z,"1st, THANKS TDMK for the great work uploading the coverage of F1.

I'm a big F1 fan, but I live waaaay back in a VERY rural area of the US in the mountains and get NO TV except what I can download, so I REALLY appreciate everyones efforts to share these files.

Best wishes,
ML"
,tdmk1,2010-03-14T20:30Z,"Sorry for the delay in uploading the race people, it's been ready for almost 2hrs but uploads are broken on TPB at the moment - looks like everything stopped at 13:39... :(

I'll keep checking back every 15mins or so..."
,earlrue,2010-03-14T21:21Z,"Dear TDMK1!
Totally appreciate all your efforts. Just to know that somebody out there cares about the real life essentials is of great reassurance. I´ll keep checking in a 15min tact too and hope that tpb. ul. will work soon...
As we saw 2day (at a very basic stream and immersed in live timing) the season will see some overtaking too, yeah!! "
,earlrue,2010-03-14T22:11Z,"...and btw...weather´s crap here in CE(AT) too, taxes keep rising, not sure who owns what...except DM got Red Bull...that´s nice at least...the UAE may get rid of some of their investments though...and no BBC1...that sucks...so, the only way to get to the real stuff...rely on heroic and social tech´n´petrol heads...cheers! (nice ride btw)"
,ftpv014,2010-03-14T23:50Z,Thank you very much for taking the time to put these up.
,moonlistener,2010-03-15T02:29Z,"could you upload the race onto EZTV?

just wondering.  :-)"
,exile21,2010-03-15T06:12Z,"Thanks  TDKMI for ur effort, video is fine on VLC, but still no audio. VLC usually plays  AAC formats without any problems, any other ideas ?
Thanks"
,bradfa,2010-03-15T09:52Z,"@exile21:
I think you're the only one with issues using VLC. Have you tried reinstalling VLC?
No issues with sound or video for me using standard install VLC 1.0.2 on WinXP or VLC 1.0.5 on Fedora12.
Are you sure other videos play sound and mute isn't on?"
,jazzme84,2010-03-15T14:34Z,Hey TDMK...! Can you Upload the Bahrain Sunday Race Please!
,bradfa,2010-03-15T17:07Z,"@jazzme84:
TPB uploads aren't working as of yesterday mid-day.  Nothing new has gone up on TPB because of the upload issue."
,fone-fan,2010-03-15T18:51Z,"cheers and thanks a heap, this is the only way I can watch F1"
,wheezyv,2010-03-15T19:05Z,I really appreciate you uploads.  This is the only way I can watch F1 these days.   I'm looking forward to watching the race.
,daveyboy79,2010-03-15T20:06Z,"TDMK1, You kick ass.  As a UK expat who now lives abroad, no one covers the F1, and all the news to do with F1 like the UK.

God bless you and your uploads to a f1 fan like me."
,ccdxb,2010-03-15T21:22Z,BBC rocks!! thx for the upload. excellent qual. Really appreciate it.
,sbenus,2010-03-15T23:08Z,any news when the race will be available? i'm dying over here. hehe
,CBL_war,2010-03-16T02:13Z,"Thank you TDMK1!!! Its excellent!!
BTW, Im seeding (both), like I always do...and Im wondering whats that password? You know what I say, right? 
Please could you help me in that? 
Thank you man!"
,ccdxb,2010-03-16T15:27Z,"not sure how this works, but can't u upload the race on another site?"
,bradfa,2010-03-16T16:56Z,TPB is back! :)
,wheezyv,2010-03-16T17:20Z,I see someone posted the Bahrain race highlights recently.  I'll try to hold out for the race.  
,yyario,2010-03-16T18:09Z,thanks a lot for the fast upload! great to see F1 back again for another season.  Any news on whether the race day will be available?
,tdmk1,2010-03-16T22:56Z,"Sorry that the race upload was delayed, but it was uot of my hands. The database errors wee stopping me from even commenting let alone uploading this weekend... :(

Anyway, FYI, I'm gonna upload the torrents to Demoid too from now on..."
,Jim_Male,2010-03-16T23:26Z,Thanks. Good job.
,tdmk1,2010-03-17T13:54Z,"@CBL_war - Sorry, I'm not sure what password you are referring to ? None of my uploads will ever be password protected... :)"
,CBL_war,2010-03-18T07:37Z,"I probably got wrong and downloaded yours from another site, being indeed not yours...sorry, and again thank you, excellent Qualy!!   "
,tdmk1,2010-03-19T00:40Z,@CBL_war  - No probs... :)
