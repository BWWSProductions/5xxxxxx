
The 1990 debut of Urban Dance Squad revealed a band smashing the boundaries between rock, funk, punk, metal, and hip-hop. "Fast Lane" leads the program with a blistering groove powered by chugging guitar and sampled horns. Later, "Brainstorm on the U.D.S." alternates rap verses with a punky shoutalong chorus, while "The Devil" borrows a murky string bassline and greasy slide guitar from the Tom Waits bag. Rudeboy never really sings; rather, he raps or -- when the song demands it -- sort of chants along in a singsong cadence. But for a non-singer he has a great voice, one that comes from the chest but has a sharp enough edge to cut through the mix. Also notable are polymath guitarist Tres Manos and the unbelievably funky bass of Silly Sil. (AMG)
