Well I [was] gonna turn BitTorrent off straight after download.

But now your words keep ringing in my ear like an ominous prophecy from a mad African witchdoctor. ""Share and seed...."" I

""Share and seed...."" 

""SHARE AND SEEEEEEEED""

holy fuck!

I just know sth really bad is going to happen if I dont now. Like on Final Destination where people are just fated to die horribly no matter how careful they are.

Will my giant 30"" monitor topple on my head as I adjust a power cord? Maybe the anti-piracy armed response unit will make an example of me and only me (in the whole fuckn world except that one chinese dude busted for pirated DVDs wtf lol only another 2.5million vendors to go)and shoot me dead like Im a notorious and heavily-armed drug dealer.

idk...  but im fuckn seeding thats for damn sure"
