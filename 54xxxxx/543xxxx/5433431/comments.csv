,jorrell0733,2010-03-14T01:13Z,"Re: giffo5. I will be uploading the Full Formula 1 Season, both Qualifying & Race Day in MKV format."
,giffo5,2010-03-14T01:25Z,"YOU ARE A FREEKIN GOD !!! 

Thank you so much my friend ! .......
I know most people on here dont realise just how much time and effort goes into uploading the races for us to get free of charge.
So please guys, before you complain or bitch and moan as anyone who uploads stuff for us... Take that into consideration ! 
Thanks again man ! .... Please keep your computer running sweet ! lol..... "

Keep uploading Formula One!"
,giffo5,2010-03-14T11:19Z,"Ok Guys.... again i want to thank Jorrell0733, but i have some awsome news !! 
In my panic to find an alternative source for F1 when i realised Darmeth was not running, i came across a system that seemed to be to good to be true.
You can check it out at filmon.com
Its a small d.load of a system that streams live bbc and many other channels in near HD quality.
You can watch the chanels for about 5 mins free of charge. But they offer a small package of bbc itv and few other channels for $7.95 for a month.
And i am about to sit down and watch the race in perfect quality right now!
I know torrents are all about free stuff and i dont want to take away from the awsome work you guys do,but its worth the money to me.
 I will still be downloading the race to watch again and keep. But watching it live will be awsome! 
Check this system out... i was watching match of the day live last night too !woohooo !!
Keep up the great work guys !
And let me know if anyone likes this system ! 

PS... I promise this is not some person who works for them... i just wanted to share this with my fellow F1 lovers ! "
,warentee,2010-03-14T19:03Z,"Thanks so much!

For those of us who are traveling or otherwise not able to make plans to watch, your efforts to get f1 up quickly (including early extra seeding help) are *really* appreciated.

The quality on this was great.  Plus, I didn't have to listen to that idiot Bob Varsha on speed.

,Quattrox,2010-03-14T19:04Z,"Waitng on the race pleace ;)
Thank you."
,jocusvtc,2010-03-15T12:48Z,"Thank You very much!!!
Still Waiting for RACE!!!!!!"
,majinhurricane,2010-03-15T20:12Z,"I miss darmeth :(

The one torrent I found of the race didn't have the preshow and went straight to the race.  I usually catch the races live but TSN (canada) only shows the race.  No preshow. 

so +1 for still waiting on race."
,Eat_Guy,2010-03-16T07:04Z,Race day would be nice :)
,pevermei,2010-03-30T16:49Z,Thanks from Brasil!
