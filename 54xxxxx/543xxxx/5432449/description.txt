This is the latest edition of the great microgame from Steve Jackson, from ye olde times when he was actually designing wonderful games and not bitching how everyone steals from him.
Inside the archive you will find all the original hex maps as well as tools to build them, various counter sheets from original b&w to fan-made fullcolor ones, OGRE cybertank record counters, and all the official rulebooks and supplements along with the best unofficial ones. There is even a GURPS Ogre splatbook to familiarize you with the background and the OGREverse.Everything is print-and-play. There is also a VASSAL module inside, to play through the net. 
The rules are elegant and streamlined, simple enough to be learned by a 10 year-old, yet the game has a lot of tactical and strategic depth.
So go ahead, read the rulebook and play this jewel of a game.
