This shit is so frustrating because I haven't had any problems since I've been downloading games.

Did they smoke weed before doing that sys Req?

And @RDCMrT

If you think that installing Phyx will make a game work. You're totally stupid.

And look at every comments made on torrents named Metro 2033 , There's no one that made it work , Either WITH or WITHOUT the damned ''Razor1911'' Crack , That is if its their crack...

I'm althought , Downloading this , Which prolly won't work at all 

Oh and between , Razor1911 , Please read this stupid Sys Req posted right here.

first, this Proper release work fine so far. I played more than 1.5 hrs

my rig - C2Q2.4 / 4GB / 9800GTX+ / w7 32

if u have TL/9multi/Clone release forget it. don`t even try to extract it using Razor1911 installer or Phoenix 1.3beta to extract that copy and use crack only. its not working

if u have x3DAudio1_7 dll problem, use metro2033 extracted folder find `install` folder. install new updated DirectX setup. also PhysX & vcredist_x86 for more good

but this game have worst optimization issues.
frame rate is so variable and killer for even good Gaming rig at the moment

,akhellbinder,2010-03-17T16:04Z,"When it says i need to copy all of the content of the crack folder, into the install folder, do they actually mean the place you installed the game, or in the actual folder called INSTALL inside the folder you installed the game.

Very confusing.

,mikemenes,2010-03-17T16:05Z,Guys it might be the crack.I conclude to that as when i looked at the first immage the uploader has for proof that the game works i count 18 files without the instal folder and when i go to my computer and find the metro 2033 main folder i count 14 in it...so i bet its the crack

You realize there are more people having problems with the game on piratebay, than theres people actually playing? Just because the game works for YOU, doesnt mean it works for everyone. Its like that with each and every game here. Works for some, doesnt work for others. This is my first time a game doesnt work when its from a proper release group.

We all did the exact same thing as you. Yes i have windows XP (SP2), and i prefer tried and tested systems. I did have windows 7, but i grew tired of it.

1.
Dx11 is available in 9 days for nvidia fans when GTX 480 and GTX 470 Fermi cards are launched.

2.
Physx IS ACTUALLY required in certain games even if you DO NOT USE NVIDIA cards,its an engine that can either use your gpu or cpu,its much better suited to your gpu but has to be nvidia.

The system rquirements quoted are infact true.

Here are some things i have learned after googling for few hours :P and still havent found a solution.
Razor and skidrow releases should both work with the razor proper crack. However, both cracks should be able to start the game. Apparently skidrow crack hangs up at some point and crashes.
I have same problem as you that the game crashes a few seconds after starting the exe file.
I have the same release as in the folder screenshot on page 8 from andehman.

I have installed the Nvidia physix, updated directx and the vcredist.
With both cracks tried out nothing changes.

Im starting to think that the problem is in the ati drivers.
Im using catalyst 10.2. on Sapphire x1950pro.
System is dual core amd x2 with sp3 and 2 gigs of ram so that's not the issue, as i can run all newly released games.

Can anyone else give any more insight please?"

NEXT COPY ALL FILES FROM RAZOR1911 FOLDER - NOT JUST SINGLE EXE FILE - ALL INCLUDING content.upk0 sounds.es.vs... etc - all 7 of them and paste them into your game folder.  that should get your going without crashes on load screen. BYE now"

There should be 2 user.cfg files. The one that game actually uses is supposedly in Documents\username\AppData\Local\4A Games\Metro 2033.

,nitbbe,2010-03-18T04:15Z,"ok, i figured out how to fix the crash at the thq screen, i was trying to figure it out since last night. as annoying as this is, download your graphic driver from whatever website and install it. even if you have the lastest driver for your gfx card already, install it again. it worked for me. i didnt read it anywhere but thought id give it a shot because i had nothing better to do. if anyone has any problems let me know."

,kidkayos,2010-03-18T04:55Z,"I was having the quitting-at-launch problem and realized it was an I/O error = Ignorant Operator. When I usually replace the original files with cracks, I move them elsewhere first - the only duplicates I saw were Metro2033.exe and a Content file. I moved both to a backup folder and copied all the files over from the crack folder. launched and immediately failed.
What I later realized was that the ""content"" file I was backing up from the original install - ""content.vfs0"" I think - was not the same as the one in the crack ""content.upk"". So in essence, the only file you are replacing from the crack is the Metro2033.exe file, the other files - all the sounds and ""content.upk"" are added to the game folder.

Now, I'm not sure if this next thing helped as well because I did both at the same time and didn't test it but see if it will help with your crash-at-logo problem. I went to the NVidia site to download the latest PhysX and found it is version 9.x. The one included in the the installer is version 10.x. I installed 9.x and was playing for two hours afterwards so it seems to work OK.

I hope these suggestions help someone out there. Good luck."

if your playing in dx11 and notice the crappy performance issue. turn off advance DOF in dx11 options. it dose absolutely nothing and watch your framerate sky rocket.

also even tho you have physx installed. download the physx software package off of nvidias website or guru3d. it should solve the issue where the game detects no physx.api file,blah blah blah.

if your experience crashes. un-check advance physx in the game options. it will stop the crashing in game everytime a ganade goes off or whenever.

if it crashes at start up.try the separate  razor crack posted on here or try to run the game as admin. these things are the only things i can think of right now.

I see many people with problems with the install.
It worked for me like this!

   1.  Install DirectX  - Navigate to THQ\Metro 2033\install\DirectX and run DXSETUP.exe
   2. Install Visual C++ Runtime ? Navigate to THQ\Metro 2033\install\ and run vcredist_x86_sp1_atl_4053.exe
   3. Install PhysX System Software ? Navigate to THQ\Metro 2033\install\ and run PhysX_10.02.22_9.10.0222_SystemSoftware.exe

There can be several causes for black screen at startup and other similar issues. Several possible fixes are listed below.

   1. If you are running on a DUAL MONITOR setup, please UNPLUG the secondary monitor before launching the game.
   2. If you managed to run the game once (and if it fails to load after the first run), delete the user.cfg file located in the game?s installation directory and try running the game.

i hope this wil fix your problems, it worked for me.

just before i give up hope of playing i try a last resort;

1. follow the steps as normal to install the game, components and crack

2. find the metro2033.exe in the install directory

3. right click -> properties -> compatability

4. check ""disable desktop composition"" and ""run as administrator"" and click apply

,barbaneli,2010-03-21T14:21Z,"@ ATI DX9 USERS:

After i have been getting the crash after starting the metro2033.exe i have managed to start the game on Radeon x1950 pro with Catalyst 10.2 and Win XP SP3.
I installed the ""Ati enbseries patch"" intended for the game ""Saboteur"" released by a Russian coder after reading about someone that did it on official Russian metro forum.

Same issue was with the Resident evil 5 which just would not run on that series of older Ati cards.

However the game is UNPLAYABLE even with the patch because of the black artefacts and squares and overlapping textures on large portions of the screen.

The framerate was high on low details and acceptable normal details in 1024x768 and even 1280 x 1024 (over 30ish on average) so card should be able to run the game fine.

So it is a driver issue after all. All we can do is wait for a fix be that from the developers, Ati or even that Russian guy who tweaked the Dx9 driver for RE5 and saboteur.

It's a shame that Ati drivers for ""legacy"" cards are now updated only 4 times a year.

As for the devs, if the game was not tested they should not have released those minimum system requirements. They could have just wrote ""Nvidia DX9 3.0 shader graphics card"" because the game runs fine on Nvidia equivalent older cards.

I hope this helped some people like me who just could not start the game no matter what they did.

As for people complaining bout viruses and spyware

Truth 1 : Most keygens/hacks ARE trojans or malware so they fool the system and the programs itself online internet security and registration verification - they wont harm your system even if your antivirus says otherwise

Truth 2 : What WILL harm yous system are win32/Viruts usually downloaded as active-x or popus in even well known not only blacklisted ones pornsites (worst of them all are SYNCMAN.EXE , reader_S.exe , igqjj.exe , windows fake security center , Dr.Guard - Paladin Antivirus)
These infect most of your C:\windows C:\Program Files .exe .dll files even if you downloaded before the infection -

so if you downloaded a game and installed it and then the hidden virut infected its .exe or .dll's dont blame it on the uploads or stuff that are innocent  

Instead a solution : dr. Webs Cure It (made in Russia ;P) Cured most my stuff when i was having trouble some months again instead of deleting , and deleted /windows/system32 dlls and exe hidden tmp's waiting to infect again my new files or new windows instalation

I noticed that the install when finished was only 4.5 gig or so and thats wrong ofc. So I got a hold of the skidrow update here on TPB. Installed it and still didnt work. 

I then tried re-installing the razor1911 version again over the top of the old install and it worked fine. Install is over 7gig.

Make sure you install everything in the install folder after like DX and so on and you HAVE to have steam running in ofline mode.

Works great, Shame about the game. Same old same old but it a different wrapper, No imagination games devs have these days!!!"

For some messed up reason it works. 

Running it with an AMD 5600 X2 at 2.8 GHz, and a gtx 260 216. It's pretty smooth for the most part maxed out. But my fans are blazing like hell. Poor things :( Get crazy temps. Card's running at 87 degrees. 

Also. The game's worth playing for the visuals and atmosphere alone. The gameplay and story is average so far, about 2 hours in. :D "

Install Notes
1. Extract RARs

2. Mount or Burn image

3. Run Installer.exe (when it ask for SID file you have to select it on your
dvd drive)

4. Copy the whole content from crack dir to your install folder

5. Have Fun!

Some things you have to do to get/keep it running:
Install ALL additional content in the /Install dir (directx, physix, etc, it'll tell you when you already have it.), and if you're running it on a vista 64bit (even tough it seems to happen on 7 too) don't use the directx10, stick to 9, otherwise it won't start but a blackscreen will appear."

,ThePopov,2010-03-26T03:09Z,"BLACK SCREEN FIX: (windows 7)

To all of you that are getting BLACK SCREEN it is because you do not have 1680x1050 compabile monitor and that is default resolution in cfg file.

IMPORTNANT:
not the user.cfg file in game dir, but in C:\Users\UserName\AppData\4aGames\Metro2033\user.cfg

scroll down and look for:

r_res_hor 1920
r_res_vert 1080

and numbers to your monitor's resolution."

To solve the problem you are having go to your c:drive and find your windows folder then look inside for system 32 folder.
When you find it you need to delete the entire contents then reboot your computer.

,Harrier125,2010-03-30T00:07Z,"Installation Guide:
(Note that Quotes aren't apart of the file name and are put there to clarify that this is a name of a file)

1. Download the torrent.

2. With your RAR (Named 'rzr-2033') Right-Click it, a Drop Down Menu should appear, Right-Click ""Extract files..."", Extract it to where your 'rzr-2033' RAR is.

3. Right-Click 'rzr-2033' RAR, a Drop Down Menu should appear, put your Cursor over ""Power ISO"", Click ""Mount Image To Drive [E:] C\Users\Owner\Downloads\Metro 2033 Proper\Razor1911\rzr-2033.iso""

(Note that your Directory or 'Dir' may differ)

4. Open ""Start"", Click on ""My Computer"" or ""Computer"", Double-Click Drive [E:].

5. Click through until you see ""Install"", Click ""Install"".

6. When it asks you for a File, navigate to the [E:] Drive, Right-Click it and choose ""Open"", Click on the file it has asked you to select (If my memory serves correct, the 2 Files it asks you to select are 'Metro 2033_disk1_1.sid' and 'Metro 2033_disk1_3.sid').

7. You may have to do this twice, again follow the same instructions

8. Once installation is done go to your download location where your 'rzr-2033' RAR is located, when there open up the Folder you made by extraction the RAR (It should be named 'rzr-2033' just as your RAR, but under ""Type"" it should be 'File Folder' instead of 'WinRAR archive').

9. Click on the top File, hold the ""Shift"" Key on your Keyboard and click the bottom File, all the Files in your Folder should now be selected.

10. Right-Click any of the Selected Files, a Drop Down Menu should appear, Click 'Copy'.

11. Navigate to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\METRO 2033"", Right-Click anywhere in a blank space in this folder, Click 'Paste', all the Files should now appear in this Folder, when a Prompt comes up asking if you wish to replace the older file with the new one, Click ""Yes"" or any variation of ""Yes"".

(Note, ""x86"" is for 64-Bit Operating System Users only, if you're using a 32-Bit Operating System it should appear in C:\Program Files\METRO 2033)

12. Download SKIDROW's Metro 2033 Patch Torrent located here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5443942/Metro_2033_Update.1-SKIDROW

13. Once downloaded, navigate to the Patch Directory, when there open up ""Metro 2033 Update 1-SKIDROW"", inside should be a Application named ""Metro 2033 Update 1-SKIDROW"", Double click this.

14. When installing the Patch when it asks you for a Directory, the Default should be ""C:\Program Files (x86)\THQ\Metro 2033"".
Remove the ""THQ"" part, it should now look like this: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Metro 2033"".

15. Once installed (It should take around 1 - 2 seconds, don't be alarmed by this) open up the other folder named ""SKIDROW"", Right-Click ""metro2033"", a Drop Down Menu should appear, Click 'Copy'.

16 Navigate to your Metro 2033 Folder (Default: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Metro 2033"") Right-Click anywhere in the Folder which is blank, a Drop Down Menu should appear, Click 'Paste', after this a Prompt should appear asking if you wish to delete the old File and put in the new one, Click ""Yes"" or any variation of ""Yes"".

(Note x86 is for 64-Bit Operating System Users only, if you're using a 32-Bit Operating System it should look like this instead ""C:\Program Files\Metro 2033"")

17. In your Metro 2033 Directory, go to ""Install"", Double-Click it, once inside the Folder go to the ""D3D11Install"" Folder and Run the ""D3D11Install"" Application.

(Note the ""D3D11Install"" is only if you have a DirectX 11 compatible Video Card)

18. Go back to the ""Install"" Folder, open up ""DirectX"" next. Once inside ""DirectX"" Scroll Down  until you come across ""DXSETUP"". Run this.

19. Go back to the ""Install"" Folder, now Run the ""PhysX_10.02.22_9.10.0222_SystemSoftware"" Application.

20. After this has been Run and Installed, Run the final Application, ""vcredist_x86_sp1_atl_4053"".

21. Once this is installed you should now be able to Run Metro 2033.

I wish you luck and I really hope this guide helped anybody who hasn't got much experience "
,Harrier125,2010-03-30T02:26Z,"If you do download and get this game working, you'll realise that it's really nothing special.

The game is very linear, nothing wrong with that apart from the fact that most linear games keep a pace up, so it doesn't bore the player, this game really doesn't care about the pace, it's so slow.

The game itself is very hard, after playing it on Hardcore for a while, and seeing people survive 3 Shotgun blasts from 10 feet away, only to die on the 4th blast, I just couldn't be bothered and decided to turn it down to Normal, only to find out they die from the exact same amount, it appears you do a small bit of damage more and take less.

The gas mask is annoying, I really hated it, swapping air every few minutes isn't what I call ""immersion"" as the developer put it.

The flash light charging how ever, feels right, you don't need to charge it often and realising your light is running low is a nice thing, the charger is fun to use as well.

And don't tell me about the common mutants, are they creative in design? Yes they look very good, but why do they jump right through you, sorry but do they have Noclip? And why, why on earth would any animator actually make them jump on 2 feet from side to side after hitting you, and putting there mutant claws in front of them while swaying them back and forward, I'm not joking about what I'm about to tell you, I thought it the instant I seen them, but these mutants act like Boxers. Yes, Boxers, the sport, Boxing, mutants now do it.

And good luck running this, I'm using 4GB of GDDR2 RAM and 1GB of GDDR5, with Dual Core 3.6GHz Processor and a Radeon HD5870, and I'm playing it on DX9, High and the most FPS I get when fighting a few guys is around 35 - 40. Doesn't sound bad and it isn't, but the 5XXX series is the latest ATI cards out, and they can't even run this on DX10 with out a drop of around 10FPS, and on DX11 I was going around 9FPS in the market.

This game has amazing visuals, but good luck seeing them.

This game really isn't amazing, I didn't even get hyped up about it, really I would say ""Yea, it's worth the DL"" but Hell, don't buy this.

If you go into this game expecting a okay linear game, you'll still be slightly disappoint. 

I think it's safe to say that it's just best to stick to good linear games, like Half Life or Bioshock.

It's not a ""sport"". PC Gaming never has been and never will be a ""sport"", calling it that just shows how dimwitted and sheepish you are.

Also Nvidia and ATI cards, seriously why is this stupid ""Nvidia is betar"" still on going.

I've had multiple cards from both Nvidia and ATI, guess what, there isn't a huge difference apart from A. Performance and B. Names.

Honestly, ATI bring out a better card, then Nvidia does, then ATI does, then Nvidia does, none are better than the other, I've had problems with both ATI and Nvidia, everyone does.

The sooner people get over there little ""Nvidia is betar"" shit the better, this also goes for ATI fans.

Most real PC Gamers can appreciate both Nvidia and ATI."

Installed the Game, looked for the SID in the Installation disc, copied all the Contents from the Razor Folder in the Disc. Launched the Game...

This is what i get:

""The Program can't start because X3DAudio1_7.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix the problem""

My System:

Win7 x64 (64bit)
GTX260 Geforce Palit Video Card w/ latest driver

8GB Installed memory
Asus P5QL Pro MotherBoard

Thank You in advance!"
,Harrier125,2010-03-31T18:06Z,"@ ansfav

Go to page 25 and follow my guide, there is definitely a step you have missed and my guide covers all of that. (The problem is you didn't run the DXSETUP Application).

@ garthbartin

I'm past that but I still have the save from it, I'll upload it but I'm not sure how far past it may have been, you can see for your self, I can't remember.

@ Hotwired05

Try Re-Installing it but keep your saved games, if the save doesn't work you could try using an older save and replaying through it."
,reeferwarrior420,2010-03-31T19:23Z,ok got the game too work and i just beat it took me about 2 days to beat. 1st of all great game really nice visuals.tho i have to agree with Harrier125 the mutants do BOX like a UFC fighter and they indeed do have noclip got really annoying having mutants jumping through me b4 i could shoot them then haveing to turn around to try and shoot again was annoying. I thot the gasmask was a cool idea tho once it gets damaged it makes it really hard too see. all in all i would never pay to play this game but defenitly worth the download good job again razor1911
,eid1000,2010-03-31T19:59Z,I got the fix for this problem X3DAudio1_7.dll the only thing you have to do is to update DirectX. You can do so by going to microsoft home page ;) and it works 100 %

In the matter of fact yes nvidia GC are way better than the ATI, the one and only ATI i purcahsed was 4870 X, from the first day it was overheating whith a cooling fan louder then a ship siren, with the nvida GC not a single issue, and that is my opinion which is my right to have it, you don't have to agree whith me and i don't even care!!

Firstly, thank you for posting this up for us all, I greatly appreciate you doing it.
It took 5 days for it to down load, but I finally got it. 

My problem is as follows:
After down loading it on my MAC, I copied the raw files (as downloaded) to my PC Windows 7 32bit.
I unrar'd the files and used  daemon tools lite to mount the image. Once mounted, I tried to run the ""Razor1911_Installer"" app. All that happens is small black DOS-like screen is displayed so fast that I can not read it, Other than that, nothing happens. I also tried burning the Image, but the same thing happens.
I also tried all the above on my Windows 64bit OS.
But when I try and run the ""Razor1911_Installer"" app, the OS tells me that it is not a compatible program and even trying to get it to run as XP sp3, it still won't work.
Do I need to disconnect the internet or Steam??
Do I need to run this out side of the unrar'd folder?
Can you or anyone Please help me out, I would really love to try this game. I would greatly appreciate some help, Thank you."

First off, if you get the X3DAudio1_7.ddl error, you must upgrade your direct x version using the install included in your installation.  So go to the DirectX folder and click on the setup program.  

If you get the physX error, then you haven't installed it before, so use the physx install that was provided.

If you get any other errors, you need to update your videocard drivers, or you did not copy the crack correctly, but seeing as most of you that are complaining don't have a clue what they are doing, then I would suggest you lie in the corner and cry to yourself since it took me all of 3 minutes to google X3DAudio1_7.ddl and figure out what was wrong.  ;)"

Very, very, very good game.

No bugs, no random crashes, no graphic errors. Amazing gameplay, amazing story, and it never gets boring, there is ALWAYS something new that comes up in the next mission.

,Derragon,2010-04-22T04:01Z,"To killfate:
You believe this game is full of glitches and looks like crap? Well, perhaps you should be building yourself a half-decent computer that is not using an NVIDIA graphics card. The only reason you see better performance with the 470/480s is because NVIDIA payed the creators of this game to design it especially for their cards (the dust particles and PhysX are overdone to make sure that you require CUDA cores to get optimal performance with tessellation). Apart from that if you are getting glitches you should get a hold of the store who sold it to you and get a new DVD, your's is probably F'ed. I have it store-bought and it works like a charm, however I found the torrent for a friend. The game-play is very unique and original which I found interesting, as for difficulty... Perhaps you should take the game off of very easy. If you are looking to rage about the game, don't post on a torrent that is promoting the game. Fuck you and good day.

To HurtMaster88:
Read the above post and take most of what I said from it. If the game sucks in your opinion don't fucking post on a torrent that is promoting it; people who like this sort of game will most likely love this one and I highly recommend it! We don't need idiots like you coming in TPB and raging about the game when really you should be going off somewhere else playing World of Warcraft or some shit like that.

To everyone else:
The 'X3DAudio1_7.dll not found' error is commonly found when you DO NOT have the latest version of DirectX. You do not have to have DirectX11 installed to play this game as it is available in DirectX Versions 9 to 11 (10/10+ included). You can download the latest version of DirectX (if you read this post 6 months from now it is best if you go to http://www.windows.com to find the latest DirectX Update) from here: http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/7/1/1718CCC4-6315-4D8E-9543-8E28A4E18C4C/dxwebsetup.exe

I hope that all of this helps. I can run everything nearly on maximum settings (tessellation WILL fuck up your performance on any card) with the current build:

Processor: AMD Phenom II 965 Black Edition over-clocked at 3.85GHz
Memory: 4GB DDR2 667MHz
Motherboard: ASUS M4A79 Deluxe
Graphics Card: XFX Radeon 5850 (ATI)
Resolution: 1600x900
(the rest doesn't really matter)

As for those who believe Razor1911 has fucked up with their torrents, you're wrong. Just learn to read instructions and learn to use Google if you are having problems. This link: http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com should help you out.

The game works like a charm, I was just wonderin, how do I uninstall the game because the game never came with a uninstall."
,Derragon,2010-04-24T08:51Z,"@tmbax
This game requires a decently powerful computer. Your's meets the base minimum requirements and, because of that fact, you need to set the video settings quite low with DirectX9. This should help you get better frame-rates. Apart from that getting yourself a bit more RAM and a better video card will help you out a bit more.

@bigmaq91
The uninstall file is within the game folder, I believe. However I have the game on Steam and it is legitimate therefore I am not sure how this one works. If it is on steam you can just right click it and select 'Uninstall'. Otherwise, there should be an 'UNWISE' file or a 'Uninstall' file. Hope that helps out, and remember, [url=http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com]Google[/url] is your friend."

I am getting the Simpack right after I click install asking for this file
""To continue unpacking, file 'metro 2033_disk2_0.sid' is required from disc 2""
Razor instructions show it may ask for a .sid file and if it does just simply point it to the proper .sid file in the ISO thats mounted or on the DVD if you burnt it on a disk.
The problem is there is NO file by that name in the ISO directory

there are these 4 .sid files for installation

metro 2033_disk1_0.sid
metro 2033_disk1_1.sid
metro 2033_disk1_2.sid

,Derragon,2010-04-24T22:52Z,"@Vaylgar
This must be an error on your own part. No one else is having this issue and therefore, you'll have to figure it out yourself on that part. There is a chance you are just reading it incorrectly, however you can try to select different files. There may be a 'Disk 2' folder in the installation ISO, and so you can just keep looking around. If all else fails use the 'Search' tool in Windows to find the file.

You have no idea what bloatware is, do you? It's a piece of software that you install that comes with a massive amount of 'bloat' that is basically completely useless. You have to install all the other things for it to work because they are REQUIRED for the game to work in the first place. You can't run DirectX11 without DirectX11, can you? Or perhaps you would expect the basic/advanced physics to work without the required PhysX engine installed?
Don't fucking post about something you know nothing about. If you didn't like it, don't post about it. Thanks, jackass.

@jstop311
If you got a black screen using more than one monitor, you have to either:
1. Update your drivers or get a better graphics card.
2. Set your Catalyst Control Center or NVidia Settings to use both screens stretched out on a higher resolution.
Other than that, you shouldn't be getting a black screen. The game is developed to use more than one monitor.

@ttzimas
Learn to use the uninstall file.

@adventurjunky
If you're going to help someone, actually help them. Don't be a fucking dick and give them shit feedback about it, because they're actually looking for help.

Yes, this is very normal. The installer doesn't go by 1% increments, but by steps. It's normal for the progress bar not to move as it is completely a process before it goes on to the next step which updates the progress bar."

This is the definition of lag due to a system that is not powerful enough to run the game. Set your settings to the lowest possible or to the settings that allow you to run the game without this lag. Otherwise, you're going to have to get a better system, because the reason you're getting this lag is because your computer is incapable of handling the settings, or even the game itself."

now did you remember to copy everything from the crack folder  (content.upk0,metro2033,sounds.es.vfs0,sounds.fr.vfs0,sounds.it.vfs0,sounds.jp.vfs0)
and drag it (or copy and paste) it to your install directory

how about the directx update?

1)install game
2)download the Razor1911 or SKIDROW crack (either works)
3)move the new metro2033.exe to the Metro 2033 folder (you can either rename it or just replace it)
4)go into the ""install"" folder and run ""vcredist_x86_sp1_atl_4053.exe"" and ""PhysX_10.02.22_9.10.0222_SystemSoftware.exe""
5)go into the ""D3D11Install"" folder and run the ""D3D11Install.exe"" if you havnt already updated it
6)go into the ""DirectX"" folder, copy all the files and paste them into the metro 2033 folder
7)run the ""DXSETUP.exe"" (in the metro 2033 folder)
8)run the cracked .exe of metro 2033

install the PHYSX installer that came with the game.
"" *gameInstallFolder*/INSTALL/PhysX_10.02.22_9.10.0222_SystemSoftware.exe""

after that is done go to

64bit users

""C:\Program Files (x86)\NVIDIA Corporation\PhysX\""

32bit users

""C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\PhysX\""

go into the ""common"" folder

copy all the files directly into the game's install folder. ALL of them even if you are not 64bit/vice versa.

Then back out of the common folder and go into the ""engine"" folder and then to ""v2.8.3""

copy everything in there and paste into the games install folder too.

whala. you are done and can run the game. presuming you have no other errors besides a ""PHYSX*.dll"" error or one of the PHYSX sort.

,Franci14,2010-08-20T01:29Z,"Ok guys... I've now discovered the way to install it and to play it without any errors... 
JUST FOLLOW THIS MANUAL

1. After downloading the torrent extract it.
2. After extracting mount it with daemon tools.
3. It will start ""Razor1911 Installer"".
4. After inserting the destination folder of the installation it will ask you for the "".sid"" files.
5. To install this "".sid"" files do this: Acess the file where you have extracted it through the mounted file / for example / I mounted the file on the K:\ drive so I will open that drive and find the "".sid"" file.
6. It will ask for 1 more "".sid"" file do the same process.
7. Now crack it with ALL THE FILES that are in the Razor1911 file.
8. As many of you know it will say that the audio.dll is missing if you dont instal the items coming next.
9. Go to the folder where you have installed the game and open the folder named ""install"".
10. Inside it install this 3 items :
-D3D11 Install
-DXSETUP (it's inside DirectX folder)
-PhysX_10.02.22_9.10.0222_SystemSoftware
-vcredist_x86_sp1_atl_4053
11.To end copy all the files that are inside the Install folder to the main folder ( the folder where you have installed the game)


Hope it helps, sorry if it didn't. Any doubds just ask them I'll see if I can help!"

Solution: This may seem obvious to most but im bit of nitwit half the time but i simply uninstalled the current and the most uptodate PhysX driver and re-installed it and suddenly the game works fine.

I repaired and re-installed over with different physX drivers but it was always still bugged. Hope this helps some of you :)

thnx again!, ur the best!"
,tizzay89,2010-11-29T00:03Z,lol razor games are the hardest to install. period! SKIDROW- are very easy on the other hand. kinda weird they have less seeders on this game lol. i dld borderlands from razor took me 2 days to get it to run.. so many issues and once i uninstalled it it would not let me reinstall no matter what i did. i have dlded countless games and compared to razor they are the worst uploaders of games imo. atm i am searching for the files to even run this game via there installer lol it says it cannot find them so i now have to unpack the iso file with another program to try n install that way. i doubt it will since they have removed the real game installer in added there own. so it has to be a certain which with vista is near impossible.
,tizzay89,2010-11-29T00:38Z,"yeah i have to unpack from iso. its going now but seems stuck but most games do have a lag point they all reach.  

since i hate hearing issues n no fixes ill answer some

black screen but has sound is a good sign. i dld a monoply game that most the time ill hear sound before i see anything. comps will run what it can and wont what it cant. a way to by pass this is to close everything open task manager and but the priorty for the game to above normal. this will put more cpu into running it. u can also just keep clicking the screen if u see ur mouse no mouse then make sure ur drivers are up to date. im useing a 4 year old hp hdx 9000 and it will run anything just fine as long as i give it time.
also cracks are tricky if u download the game to say data d and the cracks are on osc a it will make a shortcut rather then just move it. the fix is to copy and paste it or move it via move option. make sure u also delete the old game exe shortcut on screen and make a new 1 lol or it wont work either. no sound or very low sound which i had an issue with hitman blood money and borderlands. the issue is not the game but ur comp.  most games only do 2.1 sound meaning to speakers left right. ur sound options are mostlikly set as 5.1 wich is surround sound. the game does not support this.  crashes are most likely do to ur cpu over tasked. if this happens try closing everything u can and just run the game. if u still crash  open task and close what u no can be closed. explorer can be closed and will bump cpu useage way down but its tricky to open things u have to do it right from the manager. slow glitchy... turn down graphics /window mode the game.  if u cant seem to install the game. by using the instructions remember these are just what worked for the maker using maybe a dell or gateway... doesnt mean it will work for ur 4 grand hp lol :P  as of now i had to unpack the iso file to even make it anywhere which is fucking sad in my book. why pack if som1 has to unpack?

as i move on ill fix any issues i run into and post on here"
,tizzay89,2010-11-29T23:25Z,this game has managed to crash my vid card once lol. at the point of VALLEY i drop down a man hole and i get an error.. done it twice now. also noticed that during a rail car ride with another guy when he dies and i get throughen off and the car lands on top.. the game will sometimes  WORLD me. sends me to the basic game code in which everything is built on. did this once and my fix was just having the silenced 6 shooter enstead on my ak in hand.. but this man hole seems to be a perm issue maybe an update fixes this?
,cyd_will,2010-12-04T23:31Z,"Who is having problems with crashing right after running just install the PhysX, it's in the install folder in the game folder.

During the installation it froze after selecting disk 1 but I left it running for a while and it started installing everything, then asked for disk 3, it froze there also, after that it installed fine.

So for those who are having trouble during the installation just let it run, you don't need to press anything. Also install the Nvidia PhysX and DirectX even if you have them."

Thoughts about game:
   SCORE - 5/10
gameplay was ok but not what i was expecting, the shooting needs to be revamped in my opinion.  the guns seemed a little weak, and you will probably need to use your knife to fight once or twice.  ammo is hard to come by and so is money.  the enemies, not vary many types of them.... game gets somewhat boring with dumb side missions, not really a fast paced shooter.  the storyline is very good, just dont think they did a good job following it.. did not like the weird dreams you had to control, alot seemed off topic.  

overall score 5/10
with my pc specs and setup i played 45-70 fps through 90% of game some spots hit 24 i seen as the lowest using FRAPS to monitor framerate."

But this is like the fourth game new game I've tried in a week that has turned out fo kind of suck. The graphics are good, I like the music, and the atmosphere is OK, but the actual fighting is really irrtitating. Bloody mutants leap at you and then you can't see where the fuck they are. And when you fire your gun it's hard to tell if you're hitting or not and the recoil makes you lose your target. Overall, the action is just a mess, and after a couple hours of playing I'd had enough and gave up. Really disappointing. "
