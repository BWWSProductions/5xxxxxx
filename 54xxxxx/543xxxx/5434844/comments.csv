,Anarith,2010-09-08T21:24Z,"wtf the torrent name says 1.2 but the setup file is called ""VVVVVV_v1.0_setup.exe"""
,weirdfunk,2010-09-11T21:05Z,"For some reason when i try to run the installer i get an error ""Can't write: C:\Program Files (x86)\Games\VVVVVV v1.0\JoyToKey.exe""

And a bunch of other similar stuff.

Anyone know whats up?"
,BLACKMESALOL,2010-09-17T17:18Z,"well. indeed. its not 1.2 its 1.0
however. it shows me a lot of errors too ... the funny thing is:

i first tried it on my computer (win 7 x64). it worked perfectly.. 

so i just thought installing it on laptop (win vista x86) too. there it didnt work. mh

Maybe that 8 bit shit is not compatible with 32 bit? LOL"
,devonsanders,2010-11-06T07:51Z,You have to run the setup.exe as an administrator and it works :)
