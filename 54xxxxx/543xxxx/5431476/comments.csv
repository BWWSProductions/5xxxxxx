Will you be uploading f1 regularly? BTW, is this practice one or two?"
,CellorDoor,2010-03-12T23:48Z,"As it is tagged it is first pratice from friday
im not sure about doing that regularly, but will do it for this weekend
was quit excited about schuhmacher rejoinig

i dont know if somebody knew that darmeth has a forum ( just google for it )
but nobody can register like since summer Â´09

if darmeth read this , please comment about you situation

btw sorry for the slow speed , just have 1Mbit upload, if somedody would like to help me, write a comment"
,ordellbrown,2010-03-13T00:16Z,"Well, first, thanks very much!

So... I was searching but, maybe, Darmeth, don't upload this season. 

But, if you take this ""cause"" for you and for us, we loved and appreciate. Really! 

one more time: 

Thanks, CelloDoor!"
,Torpor,2010-03-13T00:40Z,"Thnx indeed!!! This season looks to be spectacular, new teams, new drivers, OLD drivers returning... oh my!!!"
,GetTubed,2010-03-13T00:50Z,"Thanks , far more superior than Speed Channel"
,CellorDoor,2010-03-13T02:27Z,"sorry guys,
i just realized that both friday practices are huge asynchro
i will try to solve the problem for the next ones"
,theredbarronsf,2010-03-13T03:12Z,"please seed, 4+ hours for 650mb is crap.....stop being greedy :("
,giffo5,2010-03-13T03:21Z,Thanks for your efforts ! ... So does anyone actually know for sure that Darmeth is not uploading this year ??
,CellorDoor,2010-03-13T03:29Z,"i already told you that my internet connect is to slow
if somebody else is out there, who would do that, please go ahead
but as long as nobody wont do that, i will take care, at least this weekend
better to have it slowly and in poor quali than havent anything

@theredbarronsf stop being so disrespectful"
,hakuna_matata,2010-03-13T03:31Z,"Hey

Thanks a lot.. you are certainly the life saver thanx a lot darling!! 

As for darmeth .. No idea man... he sue does good job.. dont know wat happened to him after the Brazil Race last year, They did comeup late for last race Abu Dhabhi 2009 though but not using same user name. Strange.. I know they have this forum and they are a group rather than a person.. but they sdont allow us in dont know why? have been trying to register for 2 years it just say .. cant register right now. What the fuck. anyways.. i hope they comes back soon. Anyone know where else can we find them? and use account pages.. where do they release first if not on TPB!

as for this.. thanks for the effort, the BBC F1 team is the best cant beat it.. 
as for the video ripping.. try to use H.264 or VP70 for video bcoz these are the best. and for audio you can choose ACC MP4 112kbps is more than sufficient for audio, as for video bitrate can try anything around 600 or 800 depending on the resolution. even the 512kbps would give good results. for your own testing you can try VP70 or VP62 .. its good NFS Videos are made in that .. very very good codec but not that popular. H264/X264 are basicaly similar. for the container you should try mkv instead of avi. can try VirtualDubMod and mediainfo instead of Gspot to view the details of the mkv files.

Keanu

,giffo5,2010-03-13T03:55Z,"Thanks for the info man ....

Cellordoor... Keep up the great work... you are right... i would rather watch this in black and white that watch the terrible Speed channel ! 
Just please keep up the work and do what ever it takes to bring us the BBC coverage !
We love ya man !! "
,CellorDoor,2010-03-13T03:59Z,"hi,
i think i know pretty much about all the video codecs and so
please dont forget that this isnt a tv capture, i captured this with a programm called ""camtasia"". it records you display, while the movie is played 
because of that, i have strong framedropping by using codecs like xvid or even higher h264
also i cant capture the F1 and re-encoded after, because the releases will delay more and more. i try to upload them 3-5hourse after they were broadcasted
even if my computer is fast ( Quad 3,4Ghz ) it would take ages 
i will change a few setting and show it to you tommorows pratice

p.s. i dont belong to any releasegroup, im a private person who enjoyed darmeth release since last year
since hes gone, i thought to look how many people are still interessted in it"
,Huarachi,2010-03-13T04:41Z,"Hi CellorDoor,

Thank you so much for your efforts! As someone mentioned; darmeth folded after Brazil last season.  Tenac did the Adu Dhabi GP and I was hoping that they wold be continuing this season, but I'm so glad you've stepped up to the challenge. Keep it up! Once again thanks!!"
,Jurica89,2010-03-13T08:08Z,Thanks.
[V],albiondean,2010-03-13T09:34Z,"CellorDoor, For starters the quality is ok mate, take no notice of some of these lot they'll have you jumping through hoops if you let them. Your the capper so cap in what container and what quality suits you."
,Torpor,2010-03-13T10:42Z,"Was going to let you know about the framedrop, but you sorted out that one by yourself, I'm NOT complaining what so ever, I think you are a life saver too, so please keep up the good work and my weekend will be splendid, thnx!!!"
,aramis74,2010-03-13T11:38Z,"Thanks for your great work.
I am also a fan of DARMETH's work. But I don't know if he will upload anything this season.
You probably know that he was using .mkv as compression file type. Maybe that might make the frame dropping issue disappear. See what you can do. But thanks a lot from Geneva!"
,Mephisto656,2010-03-14T03:29Z,"@CellorDoor

Thank you so much, the us has horrible F1 Coverage. As for Darmeth, I was an avid follower on mininova before they folded, and I believe Darmeth had some health Issues at the end of the season last year. In addition I to have been waiting to register at the Darmeth forums, but to no avail. Thank you for your uploads!"
,Tec5nical,2010-03-14T20:56Z,"Oh God.. Thank you man, thank you.
If I were in your shoes, I'd never stop helping other lovers lose the beloved!"
,mathias921,2010-03-15T13:04Z,Learn how to upload or DON*T! 
,fone-fan,2010-03-15T18:52Z,"this is great, keep it up, much appreciated"
