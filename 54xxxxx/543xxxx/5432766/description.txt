 RELEASE NOTES:                                                             
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                              
 The easy way to download and convert Web videos from hundreds of           
sites. This works also for audio and picture galleries.       
                                                                            
 DownloadHelper is a tool for web content extraction. Its purpose is to     
 capture video and image files from many sites.                             
                                                                            
 Just surf the Web as you are used to, when DownloadHelper detects it can   
 do something for you, the icon gets animated and a menu allows you to      
 download files by simply clicking an item. For instance, if you go to a    
page, you'll be able to download the video directly on your file   
 system. It also works with MySpace, Google videos, DailyMotion, Porkolt,   
 iFilm, DreamHost and others.                                               
                                                                            
 You can setup the extension to automatically convert the downloaded movies 
 to your preferred video format.                                            
                                                                            
 When you are on a page containing links to images or movies, you can       
 download some or all of them at once. Moving the mouse over the items in   
 the menu will highlights the links directly in the page to make sure they  
 are the ones you want to pick up.                                          
                                                                            
 DownloadHelper also allows you to download files one by one, so that you   
 keep bandwidth to surf for other stuff to download.                        
                                                                            
 Enjoy another fine release from HERiTAGE!
