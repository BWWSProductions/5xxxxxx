#The network was a massive protest against the DRM protection from UbiSoft.
#
#This new method of digital rights management, which requires a complete game for #the availability of a permanent Internet connection.
#
#DRM does no longer start the game and record the checkpoint passage in case of #absence or break the Internet connection.
#
#Games that already have this mechanism: Assassin's Creed 2 and Silent Hunter 5.
#
#Join the protest!
#
#Remember Only Moscow Time! 15:00, 18:00, 20:00, 22:00, 00:00 <<<Today 13 Th Of #March! Change Local Time To Moscow...
