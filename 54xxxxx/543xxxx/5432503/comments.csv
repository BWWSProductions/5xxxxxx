,sgniraic,2010-03-13T13:27Z,"@MrWessz: If you get a lot of ""Request timed out."" it most likely means it's working. I get the same thing with the second address, which appears to be their forum. And it's normal because servers are overloaded. But otherwise it can also mean that your connection dropped a bit, which is not the case here."

,Ykalon,2010-03-13T14:01Z,I would appreciate if you didn't attack the forums. Just the games severs not the forums please. There is a 72 page thread on ubisofts forum protesting against the DRM.
,sgniraic,2010-03-13T14:09Z,"Okay, it's 16.05 Moscow time right now. Stop pinging second address for 15 minutes, that's until 16.20 Moscow time. If the forums are working in these 15 minutes, it means the second address is indeed their forum servers.

It's important that we keep their forums working. Otherwise nobody can complain!"

,sgniraic,2010-03-13T14:58Z,"Anyone knows which address is for the forums? I managed to open their forum page a few times, but this doesn't mean much, it could be either one of two addresses. We, at TPB, are only a small portion of attackers though, so we don't have much control over which server is attacked and which not. Ykalon has a good point about not attacking forums, no forums means no complaints.
BTW, it's 16.53 Moscow time now (for all of you that didn't set your clock to Moscow time)"
,buttoners,2010-03-13T15:00Z,keep attaking until their servers are broken !

,sgniraic,2010-03-13T15:14Z,"@Neo2007: Yes, just leave the window open, but attack both addresses, because nobody knows which is which. We don't want attacking their forums while leaving DRM servers alone.
If something is not clear, then close downloaded files and do this:

,sgniraic,2010-03-13T15:28Z,"@Tiucaner: You are right! Thanks for the info!!!

Go to start -> run -> type cmd and hit enter -> type ""ping 216.98.48.35 -t -l 1024""

DO NOT do the same with 63.251.9.26, it's their forums! Again, they need to hear some complaints from players!"

,sebdhaese,2010-03-13T15:50Z,"I think that they need to check the activity between the game and the servers when they play the game, so that they can copy that in a crack file... ???"

It doesn't matter how hard they try preventing piracy, in the end, piracy wins. When there's a method of prevention, there's always a way of breaking the protection. I'm proud of what the RaZor and Reloaded team are doing, reverse engineering and hell yea, making working file/files which can be used as an alternative to real cd copies. 

My point is, when people are wealthy enough, they would drive/walk themself to shops and grab the cd, I'm a fan of both hard and soft copy of games, I just don't feel secured having to know that my hard copy might be damaged under any circumstances without a working soft copy to make it up.

@sebdhaese: About the soccer ball - it's a bit different. When you buy a ball, you own the ball. When you buy the game, you're actually only buying the license to use it. Game itself isn't yours. So basically you're paying $60 for a license to play the game.

To all of you that are against us - this is only one-time thing, at least for me. I feel bad about legit players that can't play their games right now, but we need to prove to Ubi that their servers are still unreliable. I hate to say it, but what we're doing is some form of extortion."

,sgniraic,2010-03-13T23:32Z,"For all of you that still can't get it to work:

1. Apply the 3 cracks (the same that are in all AC2 CloneDVD torrents)

2. Run ""AssassinsCreedIIGame.exe"" (otherwise you'll replace crack by updating ubilauncher) - I always run it as administrator just to be sure, but I think it doesn't matter.

3. Make sure you enable offline saving - click the gear icon next to minimize icon when it's logging in.

4. Start new session and wait at the animus's white screen at least for a few seconds.




Is anybody still pinging? If so, DO NOT ping the second IP address (63.251.9.26) - it's ubi's forums. You can do that by opening .bat file with notepad and removing ""start ping 63.251.9.26 -t -l 1024"" line.

@CiumacabraChaChaCha you will need an ubi account so you need to register first. After that, with the crack you can just skip the key stuff without entering anything.

,Ze3g,2010-03-14T02:26Z,"Allright, STOP the fucking attack the Ubisoft DRM shit. If anyone is working on a crack, they will either need to hack the Ubisoft servers and take them over. Now even though that will never happen, it would require the server to be up lol ;)

But seriously, if anyone really is working on a crack or fix to make the game playable offline etc. They really have to get the save files that just happens to be stored ON THE DAMNED UBISOFT SERVER!!! And in order to get a hold of those files, they would have to be able to connect to them. And if the servers are down at that point, then guess what? It will take an even LONGER time for the game to be cracked. So stop being a dickwad and don't attack the servers yet.

PS: Even though it's a bullshit move to make by Ubisoft, we can't say with a good concience that we haven't forced them to do this in a way...
I mean someone is after all making these games, and works hard doing it. So yeah, we are all causing harm collectively by downloading all this stuff. And attacking the servers is like pissing on someone you just beat up seeing as the game technicly is already cracked and downloaded by so many people. The same with all the other games that despite naivity and arrogance, is stolen. (I'm not saying I'm a saint, I download ALLOT, but what I'm saying is still true)"
,Ze3g,2010-03-14T02:27Z,"Oops, I meant mission files not save files..."
,sgniraic,2010-03-14T02:36Z,"@Ze3g: I have a feeling that the removal/modification of DRM by Ubi will happen before crack is released. And we are forcing them to do exactly that by overloading their DRM servers, so that the DRM appears to be nothing but trouble.
I could be wrong though and the proper crack will be released soon. I actually really hope I'm wrong, but I'm afraid crack is far away from being ready.

Is there anyone that can still play the game fully?"

"
,sgniraic,2010-03-14T04:58Z,"@Chibicho: I don't think server was completely overloaded, it was still working, but very poorly. What might have happened is that Ubi partially removed their DRM protection for a few minutes and we managed to download the whole set of encryption keys at that time. That's why some can still play the game. "

I can think of two possibilities:
1.) I downloaded the whole set of encryption keys - This is highly unlikely, since the whole point of DRM is to require another key at the start of every mission.
2.) I'm registered as a legit player until I log out - I think this is more believable.

,CiumacabraChaChaCha,2010-03-16T05:52Z,have a little respect you idiot..anyway DRM will fall a way or another and they know that..but they take that time to make people buy their game to grow their budget..i think AC2 was very expensive to make it..so be patience..there will allways be cracked games
,drifterkings,2010-03-16T06:22Z,It wasnt really that expensive only 45 bucks
,amorSophia,2010-03-16T06:41Z,"Friends!
Today at 12:00 UTC (15:00 Moscow time) attack would be renewed. Join us, please! Together - we have power!

My apologies for Google Translate."
,neetz,2010-03-16T06:57Z,@amorSophia:  thanks for the updates buddy 
,amorSophia,2010-03-16T07:08Z,Do not forget to invite people from other websites and trackers)
,franko_slipknot,2010-03-16T09:32Z,33 minutes before launching attack..
,franko_slipknot,2010-03-16T09:49Z,If you utilize a proxy they shouldn't be able to track you

,kostochka_abricosa,2010-03-16T09:56Z,try this program - freecap

then 
file-new application "
,kostochka_abricosa,2010-03-16T10:19Z,"yes, file-new application-browse-your application))"
,franko_slipknot,2010-03-16T12:50Z,14 minutes until attack
,franko_slipknot,2010-03-16T12:56Z,"9 minutes, I want the drm servers down, I wanna hear users complaining, I'm tired of this capitalism senseless bullshit"
,franko_slipknot,2010-03-16T13:12Z,"websites are on, start ddos!"
,franko_slipknot,2010-03-16T13:22Z,"Aim, death sentence!
the sites still on?"
,Kethilas,2010-03-16T13:54Z,"hmmmm im looking at the ping windows and I think its not fast enough, we should put a ping like every 100ms instead of 1 sec for more efficiency"
,Kethilas,2010-03-16T14:00Z,well some servers are responding and sometimes quit responding so at least it seems to have some effect but not enough :( I don't think they can change IPs without a patch to the game also
,Kethilas,2010-03-16T14:10Z,I don't know :S ill probably keep attacking for all weekend just to be on the safe side XD
,sgniraic,2010-03-16T14:14Z,"@Kethilas: ###ms just means how much time it takes between a ping and a pong.

What you can do, is increase size of packages. Instead of pinging 1024 bytes, ping 4096 (""ping xxx.xx.xx.xx -t -l 4096"")"
,Kethilas,2010-03-16T14:15Z,we need to think of a way to advise everyone at the same time when to attack... piratebay should put it on the first page :D
,Kethilas,2010-03-16T14:19Z,anyway if they dont fix the DRM bullshit soon ill make a program that ill post here to ddos attack thousands of times more effectively
,sgniraic,2010-03-16T14:52Z,"I've read somewhere that they change encryption keys every 1-2 days, so we might never see a working crack.
During the attack on Saturday I got through Animus and I didn't close the game. I played the game FULLY until today, when missions stopped working. I think this means that they changed encryption keys today.
So even if future attacks allow us to play the game fully, it will only last for a few days until they change encryption keys.

I have no idea how are they able to change encryption keys without changing the game files though."

,sgniraic,2010-03-16T16:38Z,We should start writing links to this page at other torrent pages. I don't think that many people actually know that the attack is still going on...

[T],dark_dark_dark,2010-03-16T20:12Z,"I was just thinking... if we can fuck up ubisoft servers, why can't we fuck up fakers? I bet there wouldn't be more than 50 ips to attack, ips that post every day all kind of fakes with an obvious intention. It wouldn't be difficult at all since ips can be seen on download...
Anyone up for it?..."
