[ Release Notes ]

In a little over ten years, Google has transformed itself from a
search engine, into a powerful advertising machine and is now moving
into the world of "cloud computing". Using incredibly powerful computer
servers spread around the world, Google wants to become the primary
depository of all things digital about you - your e-mail messages,
your documents, your music, your movies, your television shows, your
favourite web sites, your financial transactions, perhaps in the future
even your medical history will reside in Google's cloud. In return, you
will be able to access everything, everywhere and at any time.

How and why Google is approaching this daunting endeavour is the focus
of the behind-the-scenes documentary. Filmed in Google offices in China,
Russia and at the Googleplex, its Silicon Valley headquarters, the
documentary reveals a corporate philosophy and attitude unique among
major companies today. Beyond its "Don't be evil" motto, Google has set
as its goal "to organize all the world's information and make it universally
accessible and useful" and to do it in the next 300 years. As Google CEO,
Eric Schmidt says in the documentary, "Successful companies start with
very audacious goals." If Google achieves its goals, it will not just be
successful; it may very well become the most powerful company in the world.

Google World is produced by Ted Remerowski for Centillion Productions
Ltd. in association with CBC-TV.
