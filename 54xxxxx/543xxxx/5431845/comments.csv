[V],poppedtart,2010-03-13T16:30Z,Worked on that hurt locker.  Seems to have worked ok though encode-handheld doesn't appear to be setup to handle dts-ma.  It looks like dcadec and ffmpeg only understand dts core and not the ma portion.  I played it back listening to both the aac and ac3 tracks and they seemed ok though.
