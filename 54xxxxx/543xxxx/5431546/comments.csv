,King_Noobington,2010-03-13T18:17Z,"Someone needs to make a tutorial on how to play the game.  For the people who get the dreaded black screen after talking to Oak.

Anyone, please!"
,masterduvel,2010-03-13T22:20Z,"Its works for me 
but it freesse after a while "
,Skull_Emblem,2010-03-14T00:02Z,"First off, yes it's the real deal, just compressed as previously mentioned.  As for getting the game to work, it should be pretty simple once you know what you're doing.

What I did was download and install the program ""WinDs PRO"" (just google it for the download).  From there you want to open the program and then select the ""No$Zoomer"" option (I think it was included with the download, but if it wasn't just google for it).  Load up your ROM and then go under options > No$Gba settings then you want to change ""Reset/Startup Entrypoint"" to GBA BIOS.  Then close the everything and then re-open it.  It should work from there although it won't be entirely stable and is still subject to small glitches and crashing, so save often.

If there are still problems with this, let me know."

,billy1989,2010-03-21T15:14Z,"If you are suffering from black screen freezes while playing on no$gba emulator, particularly at the beginning the game after your character shrinks, follow these simple steps to fix:

Please note that I have only done this in Heart Gold version, I do not know if it will or won't work in Soul Silver.

1. Open your game in no$gba emulator normally.

2. Click the ""Utility"" drop-down and select ""Cheats"" from that menu.

3. Select the ""Add New"" button in the bottom left corner on the new window that has popped up.

4. Copy and paste the following code into the text area of the cheat window.

020DE16C E1A00000
020D3FA8 E1A00000

5. Before click okay, be sure that ""Action Replay DS"" is checked at the bottom of the window, and ""RAW"" is checkmarked underneath the okay and cancel buttons. Once you are sure of the proper settings, click okay. The name of the code does not matter.

6. Double click the code title in the cheats window to enable it. To make sure it is enabled, look for a check mark next to it.

As long as this code is activated, you will not have any black screens while starting your game or loading a saved game. You can activate and deactiviate it whenever you want.

Please note that this code ONLY fixes black screens while starting a game or loading saved games. Your game is still vulnerable to freezes, crashes, the works. My only advice is to save often, and close out of the emulator completely after each save. If you save, and then your emulator crashes before you exit the emulator completely, your data will be lost.
