Plot Outline
Drama is set in 1954, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels is
investigating the disappearance of a murderess who escaped
from a hospital for the criminally insane and is presumed to
be hiding on the remote Shutter Island.

Plot
It's 1954, and up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is
assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from
Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital. He's been
pushing for an assignment on the island for personal
reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been
brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors
whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to
downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon
provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him
access to records he suspects would break the case wide
open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the
mainland, more dangerous criminals "escape" in the
confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply,
Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner,
even his own sanity.
