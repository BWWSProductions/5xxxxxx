,jon4fun,2010-03-13T17:14Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon
P.S. Thank you for including last weeks OT."
,jon4fun,2010-03-13T17:16Z,"@ ALL Downloaders,
Say thank you! 
What is wrong with you people?
Seriously.

Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-13T18:09Z,"@jon: Somehow, you don't say Thanks to someone whose DUTY is to oblige and serve you, right? We distribute and get illegal things, and decent person must not support this illegal activity by showing gratitude. As last and most important - we (me) are heavily paid for this job, not just in un-marked dollar bills but also in bars of gold, and whatever we (I) wants.

Wrong, people seems to think so - but they cannot be wrong more, and if you wind-back a week or so - number of Thanks is - proportional to posting ""Requests on hold"" notice..."
,jon4fun,2010-03-14T14:15Z,"@20-40, There does seem to be some mathematical formula you could apply to those that say 'thanks' & why they don't.
Perhaps it is something like Drakes Formula (likelihood of finding intelligent life).
Assholes Formula - likelihood of having manners without expecting something more in return.

Perhaps, there is some math genius who would be willing to work that out, perhaps they already have?

It's this torrent in particular though, it just rubs me the wrong way.
I feel like there should be one of Bills New Rules - 'You cannot DL one of 20-40 torrents with out saying thank you, particularly Real Time, you ignorant scum'."
,NippaDeeDooDah,2010-03-16T18:13Z,"Hey! Many thanks for this! 
AND MANY THANKS FOR THE ""OVERTIME"" !!"
