Original Description
"'A picture says more then a thousand words'

This is a collection of images saved from various blogs, online communities, portals and imageboards.

We are children of the internet and our culture is just as important as that of our ancestors, and I believe that it should be free and accessible to everyone.

I want to thank the people who run non or low profit sites dedicated to spreading ideas, images and opinions for performing that service for us. And I want to thank the many heroes who will make crudely drawn MS Paint comics about video games, the neckbearded fanboys and fangirls drawing hilarious rule #34 and those who will make threads with original content even when it's not funny, because it's that creative spirit that shapes our culture and not the people sitting on their high horses comparing everything to the Renaissance masters.

All I did was unrar and rerar into individual categories.
