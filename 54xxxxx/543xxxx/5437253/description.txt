This both secret mission expansion packs to the Original Wing Commander.
I could not find this anywhere here other than the windows 95 re-release which I could never get to work on windows xp and up.  I have got this to work quite well on Dosbox 0.73 and have included some basic instructions on how I did it which can be found in readme files in each of the two folders.  Hope everyone has the same luck with this that I did, have fun.

IMPORTANT TO ANYONE DOWNLOADING THIS.

I forgot the pdf file with the codes for The Secret Missions 2 so here they are so that you can copy them to a notepad file or something.  Sorry for the mistake.
