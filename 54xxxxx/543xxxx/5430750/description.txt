Sweet originally began as a pre-packaged pop outfit for the producers/songwriters 
Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman. By combining the crunch of hard rock with the hooks 
of bubblegum pop, the pair provided Sweet with its first handful of mindlessly ... 
Full Descriptioneffective hits in the early glam soaked '70s, notably "Little Willy," 
"Blockbuster," "Wig Wam Bam," and "Ball Room Blitz." Underneath this teen-pop glitz 
however, a real rock and roll band was smoldering. Determined to make its own statement 
and get out from under the Chinn-Chapman control center, the band took a leap of faith 
and cut DESOLATION BOULEVARD completely on its own. 

What is surprising is not so much the band's desire for independence but that Sweet succeeded 
on all fronts with this release. Keeping the power hooks intact, the band displays its own 
knack for songwriting. DESOLATION BOULEVARD contains the band's biggest single, "Fox on the Run," 
a telling rocker featuring the band's multi-octave vocals. The other highlight on the album is 
the softer "The 6-Teens," which harkens back to the band's pop formula with considerably more 
texture than the their earlier hits.
