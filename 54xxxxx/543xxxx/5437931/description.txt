Heartland S03E16: Spin Out!

In this episode, Caleb struggles to get over the physical and emotional scars from his terrible accident as Amy tries to get him back on a horse. Tim recognizes the path Caleb is travelling down, and he decides to dole out some tough love. Also, Jack and Lisa's little secret kind of loses its secrecy, which has Lou concerned, and Mallory gets help from an unlikely source, considering the circumstances.


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Mar 14, 2010. 

The next new episode will be next Sunday, March 21. The episode after that on March 28 will apparently be the season finale (according to the Heartland blog on the CBC website)
