Seed it you fucks, otherwise I won't upload anything again!!!"
,hovborgvej,2010-03-14T12:40Z,"Nice comment.... --- NOT!
You must be a cousin to Eminem! An angry young man....
If that is the way you look at people, I think you shold keep away..."
,jebus197,2010-03-14T14:39Z,"Fuck you! And did you just steal it or are you seeding? I've got an 8.0 upload ratio on this and not a single extra seeder yet.

I'm going to stop soon, because clearly no one else wants to share."
,patrickw59,2010-03-14T15:30Z,"Why do you need to be so rude?
It reminds me of the movie Borat seen yesterday on TV, when the actor addresses travellers in the New-York public transportation. The same feedback. There is no need to misbehave like this."
,jebus197,2010-03-14T16:24Z,"The whole point of doing this was to share. However if you're not willing to share, then why on Earth should I?

I think just taking and not sharing is extremely rude."
,reedybloke,2010-03-14T21:46Z,"Jebus
I agree, and your ratio is commendable.
But I doubt you will make people seed by abusing them."
,jebus197,2010-03-15T00:50Z,They weren't sharing anyway. That's why I got annoyed.
,reedybloke,2010-03-15T07:57Z,"Technically, surely all leeching is stealing, and seeding is supplying stolen goods. If TPB ever gets busted. the seeders are the ones they will be after, so a ratio of 8 would definitely put you on the firing line. Easy tiger !"
,hovborgvej,2010-03-15T09:41Z,"Right, I am not seeding - but I did not download it either. I will not download enything from a person that rude... In this case I do not need this..

Try something new - try to be kind Maybe this will change your way to see the world - and the way the world sees you."
,Redgrass,2010-03-18T03:42Z,"Thank you very much, great up. will seeeeed."

Says someone who has never shared anything."
