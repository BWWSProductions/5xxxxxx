If you're looking to dig a bit deeper than the great single-disc UFO best-of collection ESSENTIAL UFO, then the double-disc BEST OF SINGLES A's AND B's is highly recommended. Featured are all of the A and B sides of UFO singles spanning the years 1969 through 1986, which show the band developing from a no-frills, blues-based hard rock band to anthemic arena rockers.

The best selections are those taken from the band's 1974-1979 peak, when Michael Schenker was their lead guitarist, such as both studio and live versions of "Doctor Doctor," "Cherry," "Only You Can Rock Me," and "Lipstick Traces." If BEST OF SINGLES A's AND B's whets your UFO appetite, you may be ready for such '70s classics as LIGHTS OUT, OBSESSION, and the near-perfect live set, STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT.
