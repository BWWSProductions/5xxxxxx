,ridnwild,2010-09-22T05:27Z,"An ISO file is an image of a disk but you can't just copy the ISO onto a disk you have to use a program to read it & extract it onto a disk. I use roxio mostly but there are tons of programs that work just as good. Use a dual layer DVD 8.5GB. Burn it at 2X or 4X max. the faster you burn the more data loss you have. The nav disc is only compatible with the 07 & up SUV's.
Try & google ""ISO files"" & you'll probably get a lot better explanation. "
,bluecar5556,2010-12-01T17:09Z,"I burned the *.iso using imgburn but it's possible the layer break was set to ""1913760"" due to previously burning an xbox 360 game.  Does anyone speculate that could be the reason why it shouldn't work?  I'm going to burn using no layer break and see what happens...  I'll report back"
,bluecar5556,2010-12-02T19:23Z,"Setting the layer break to auto did not do the trick.   Just using verbatim DL's and imgburn to burn the ""image to disc"" button on imgburn.  When I open the drive contents its all the files extracted inside as the root directory.  Is this correct or is there any other steps?  I have a 07 chevy avalache and it says, ""disc read error.""  Any help or suggestions, thanks!"

Do I have to extract files first? If so Which files have to be burnt to disc, all of them?"
,da_piper,2010-12-23T19:03Z,Denali_XL you will need a dual layered dvd-r
