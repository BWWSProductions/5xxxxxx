It is the early 22nd Century. Less than fifty years ago the worlds worst nightmare came true when the last American President pushed the button.

The world was ripped to shreds with only parts surviving the Atomic Wars, while most of the surface became a radiation desert. In America three mega-cities with massive populations and overcrowding were left. With government and country now gone, the already developing Justice Department took over.

They are the Judges. A new breed of police force, authorized to act as judge, jury and executioner.

Note:
The Readme.txt contains all the information you need to get bots running for this mod. It was one of my personal favorite mods for the original Half-Life, and I still play it time to time. 

I am uploading it because the original site no longer exists. It went down sometime in the last year, and I do not want to see this mod forgotten. 

Enjoy.
