,LST99,2010-03-19T11:57Z,Thanks for sharing. This type of not main stream film is really hard having chance to watch them overseas. It is certainly helpful other people to reference whether their country should take U.S. as a role model and go for it.

Some of the ones from PS3 team I have had problems with that show over 3.99 gigs, because of the FAT32...Am I missing something I should be doing, or are they not too big for a fat32 external or the ps3 harddrive?"
,LAMBEE,2010-03-20T20:11Z,"I was just wondering, how you get all these movies? Do you use another site to download or buy/rent the blu rays?"

The video looks flawless."

Are you using a Mac with OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard? because that OS changed to a base-10 calculation model for it's storage data. Everything appears bigger than it would normally appear on another computer. (Mac OS 10.6 says: 1000kb=1mb ; Other OS say: 1024kb=1mb)

A file that will fit on a FAT32 HDD for Mac OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard will be 4.29GB or smaller. 
Hope that helps"
