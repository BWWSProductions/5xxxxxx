Hamas and co have no problem attacking or hiding behind civilians. As long as folks like you give them a total pass on culpability you've handed them control of the agenda.

I'm sure bombing germany made for many angry germany youth as well. But to blame the uk would be missing the point entirely. people who make such propaganda films shifting blame and attention from the true cause of these issues are nothing but enablers of the ones that poison any chance for peace.  they are nothing more than apologists for terrorists who breed hate, and total disregard for civilian life.

,w000ter,2010-03-17T06:54Z,"Its pretty simple, the terrorists are the ones that fired 3000 rockets and mortars indiscriminately at civilian populations with clear murderous intent.

i know its too bad the israelis use bomb shelters to keep themselves alive.  it lets simpletons use the moral calculus of death count.  aka more german civilians died in world war 2 than british=germany in ww2 is morally superior."
,w000ter,2010-03-17T18:49Z,"its not alright, but the fundamental blame goes back to the hate mongering hamas and co.

that german children were killed by allies in ww2 doesn't make it right, but the blame wasn't on the allies fundamentally.

have some shame. those rockets are worthless u know that, but i truly wish they were effective only then selfish jews like u will understand what real war is.
Hilter didn't teach u nothing!!"
,w000ter,2010-04-09T00:48Z,"@nxg9897

yea, you hypocrite, if some jew wished idf bombs killed more palestinians you'd be outraged.
your hatred speaks for itself."
,nxg9897,2010-04-12T16:46Z,"@w000ter:

any sane person will be outraged seeing the killing of innocent people, but i guess u people are not human (that explains a lot).
here is what i'll suggest, become human before history repeats itself!!"
