[T],Quazza,2010-03-16T22:18Z,"i upload and it just...doesnt let me do it...

ive tried a zillion times...it just says no

perhaps i will just email you the torrent file and you can upload it for me on there if tpb is down?"
,joeshmuck,2010-03-16T22:20Z,"BTW...TPB is possessed! I keep hearing (randomly) TV audio coming from my browser.
Before I was hearing clips from some HBO ad. Now I just heard some audio from American Idol!

The only way to stop it, is to close my browser or refresh the page, and hope it doesn't start again."
,joeshmuck,2010-03-16T22:27Z,"Yeah....you need to be be a ""verified uploader"" otherwise it puts a hold on it. When you go to upload, there should be a check box to request becoming verified. Also, until you become verified, there is one of those stupid graphic number/letter things you need to type in, or it won't let you up.
Is the ""image verification"" thingy showing up? If not, it might be your browser."
[T],Quazza,2010-03-16T23:08Z,i have asked to be verified numerous times but no luck...
,joeshmuck,2010-03-16T23:38Z,"Hmmm.....looks like something is amiss at torrentzap judging by what is posted in the ""community"" section.
I also upload at kickasstorrents, you should give it a try. Very active community there. "
,joeshmuck,2010-03-16T23:40Z,"@GhostSquirrel
