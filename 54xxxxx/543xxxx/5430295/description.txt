As Mr. Yang's (Ally Sheedy) book is released, Shawn and Gus meet up with Mary Lightly (Jimmi Simpson), who believes that Yang had a partner: Mr. Yin, and he turns out to be right when a dead body turns up. As another murder is committed, Shawn, Gus, Juliet, Lassiter, and Henry find themselves in scenarios from classic Hitchcock films in order to stop Yin. Just like Yang, Mr. Yin makes it personal when Abigail (Rachael Leigh Cook) is dragged into his game, but she is not the only victim.
