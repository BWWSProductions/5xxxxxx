             NOTE: Regarding Atomix.Virtual.DJ.Pro.v6.0.4.PROPER-UNION        
             we were not able to replicate the error stated in the nfo.       
             For the midi mapper a mixer (external hardware) is needed.       
             Without having this external hardware we could not test if       
             this was a bug in the software itself or just a trial issue.     
             UNION please provide clear proof so indeed if there is any       
             error we can work on fixing it if possible. Of course, if it     
             can not be fixed, we will not rls the cracked trial anymore.
