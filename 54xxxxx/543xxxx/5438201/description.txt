This torrent contains emulators for the Atari 2600,5200, and the Atari Lynx.  Each one has a full rom set along with instructions on how to play.

This took me awhile to put together becasue for some reason these emulators are 
not sent with all of the necessary files to use them. I know that many people, with more expierence with this sort of thing, would have no trouble getting these to work but considering that I am the only person I know in person that has gotten these going I figured that this might help a few others out.  There are some games that are not fully compatable but this is the best I have found so far.  The 2600 is the most compatible, and the most fun in my opinion but the others are worth a try as well.  Have fun.

Just to let anyone starting out in emulation I know more than one person that has bought pc controllers and had no idea how to use them.  If you have bought a Logitech dual analog controller or are considering getting one I have posted some profiles in my torrent list that will hopefully help someone out.
