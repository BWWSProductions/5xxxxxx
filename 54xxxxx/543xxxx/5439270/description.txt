Richard Hammond's Invisible Worlds


1/3 - Speed Limits

We open on an extreme close-up of Richard Hammond's eye. Then we pull back to reveal the presenter standing on the edge of a gleaming city skyscraper, for no reason other than that it looks cool and dangerous. And, crucially, the programme has instantly grabbed our attention. Which is the gist of the idea for Invisible Worlds: to grab us with fancy photography as a way to make us focus on science-y stories. How can a dolphin swim faster than a human? Here are some lovely slow-motion shots to explain. What does the shockwave from a gunpowder blast look like slowed down 100 times? Or lightning? Or a bumblebee in flight? The answer is they all look enchanting and strange and, while we're gazing at them dreamily, Hammond can smuggle in facty nuggets to feed our brains. It's a good system and it works, helped along by Hammond's shaggy-puppy enthusiasm. And if you don't know what cavitation is or what lightning sprites are, you'll find out.
