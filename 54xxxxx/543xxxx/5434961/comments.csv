,Lucky13s,2010-06-23T07:31Z,"Fun game, easy to set up and no problems found.

@people who say its the worst.

You just dont get it. This is a real-time simulation game, meaning it takes 24 hours real time to complete 24 hours in game time. Meaning you'll spend a month playing this game to finish it.

Hence the name Virtual Villagers, you take care of your villagers every day and come check up on how they're doin, and tell them what to do... You dont sit there for 12 hours playing it like most of you no-life people here.

Its like one of those neo-pet things we all used to have when we were kids, we fed it, took care of it, raised it, but if we left it alone for a day or two it dies and we have to start over. Except on this game you can train your villagers to sort-of take care of themselves to an extent."
