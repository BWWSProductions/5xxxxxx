[V],mothergoose56,2010-03-17T02:55Z,"03-16 is coming. slowly. I grabbed one source but it's short, getting another now. I was gonna grab the 1-5 replay and up that tomorrow but I think I'll just recode this source and up that - it's good quality. It's gonna be a bit until I have it and then probably an hour for re-encoding. I'll do a z share of that incomplete one in the meantime...."
