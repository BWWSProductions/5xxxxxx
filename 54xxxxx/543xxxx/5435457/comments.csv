i can't believe the quality of the fight.  the referee should have threatened clottey with a stoppage around the 7th round when it was obvious that clottey was only interested in surviving the fight.  bad referee-ing if you ask me.  i wan't my money back!!!!

hey, wait a minute, i did not pay to watch.... so i can't complain...  "
