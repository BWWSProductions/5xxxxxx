,franznoear,2010-03-13T22:09Z,"@ akhfr-----Rajiv is absolutely correct.  This is a California produced run-of-the-mill porn film with American actors.  And Mr. akhfr, I always down load your posts as soon as you upload them.

MTV?s Real World, CSI, The Casino, Dr. Vegas, Father of the Pride, American Casino, etc. Television is quickly turning Las Vegas into one of the most recognizable cities in the world. The glamour, the lights, the mega resort casinos. Was Vegas always this big and clean? Why not take a trip to the Vegas of yesteryear and see how much it has changed. The story of Indian Lady ? if you can honestly call it a story ? has Debbie Truelove roller skating back and forth across early 1980?s Las Vegas, voyeuring her friends during their most intimate moments. The sex is hot, the plot is lame, and as a bonus, if you watch closely, you?ll even see how much Sin City has changed over the last twenty years.

Overview
Debbie roller skates from place to place and watches people having sex ? that?s pretty much it story wise. Sometimes she joins in, and other times she just looks while touching herself through her clothes.

The sex scenes average about five minutes each, and everyone has a natural body, ie., no implants and plenty of hair to go around (except on a few of the men?s heads). As far as looks go, the men and women seem like average people you would meet on the street in the early eighties ? no models or rock stars here. The sex, however, is very hot. Everybody seems to really enjoy it. If anyone is faking it, they deserve the Academy Award for their efforts. This enthusiasm easily makes up for the lack of attractiveness of the players as this is one of the most authentic (Is that the right word?) feeling pornos I?ve ever seen.

My biggest complaint about this film (Yes, it was shot on film!) is the annoying narrator. She has an irritating voice and says nothing of any importance. The worst is when she talks during the action, blocking out the moans with rambling nonsense. My advice, watch the film without the volume turned way down.

,tre.work,2010-03-27T21:55Z,"Rajiv_Maity1111, it is American Indian, not East Indian, and yes it probably has no native Americans in it, but ""Indian"" is the right category since the name of the freaking film is Indian Lady. "
