New release by SPRiNTER its a thriller starring Milo Ventimiglia who you may know from TV show â€˜Heroesâ€™. I canâ€™t say much about the movie, it has only 12 ratings at IMDb but they are rather positive. Check the sample for quality, tho itâ€™s pretty nice.

Synopsis: John Pulliti is the new all American apple pie. Almost rich, almost thirty, he never lies or cheats. When his beautiful fiance orders him around and his ball-busting boss uses threats as motivation, John never makes a sound. Eager to do right, he is a perpetual â€˜yes manâ€™.Rick Carlson is not. A smooth talking, coercive â€˜no manâ€™, Rick turns Johnâ€™s life upside-down when he not only moves into his building, but starts working at his competitive law firm. Here, every new guy represents another obstacle on the path to partnership.As Rick and others become more and more of a threat in Johnâ€™s eyes, John becomes paranoid and obsessed with uncovering the truth about those who are intent on ruining his life. Driven by his delusions, John starts to become what he hates, and learns that in a world of no absolutes, right and wrong is just a matter of perspective.
