In a city filled with trust-fund babies and armchair revolutionaries, Heavy Parker rules the punk scene as a benevolent dictator. He sings lead in a local hardcore band. He puts out zines, pseudo-revolutionary material, and flypost propaganda about town. It's good to be king. Or at least it is until Missy, Heavy's girlfriend, goes away for college. How can a guy like Heavy be expected to handle a long-distance romance? Short answer: He can't.

Missy is out of sight and Heavy's mind is already drifting towards his next sexual conquest. A king can't be expected to live without a queen. But can he maintain his throne when Missy returns, reborn as a true NYC punk and pissed as all hell? Can Heavy survive a true group of hardcores invading his turf or will he just wind up Pounded?

Written by Brian Wood (Couscous Express, Channel Zero) and illustrated by Steve Rolston (Queen & Country, Mek).
