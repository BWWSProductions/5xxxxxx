[T],jonnoel1,2010-07-06T13:25Z,Jeez...enough of the .rar files! Rip the seasons in a format you dont have to unzip etc....what a pain in the ass. 1 episode takes 6-8 downloads? No thanks...especially from a fileshare site that takes 30 minutes for 1 part file. I'll pass.

You said ""Rip the seasons in a format you dont have to unzip etc""

That makes no sense btw! none at all.
Firstly nothing has been ripped, that means ripping something from cd or dvd for example.
Secondly you say you want it in a format which doesn't need to be zipped up!!!!! that makes so little sense it's amazing!!!! you can take an .avi and zip it up, you can take a mpeg and zip it up, you can take an .avi and not zip it up, you can take a mpeg and not zip it up! makes no difference, no format needs to be zipped! nothing needs to be zipped! do you get that? zipping is just to make things smaller or for security or to break it into downloadable chunks.

So ripping (no actually!) the season in a format you don't have to unzip (doesn't have to be zipped) makes no sense."

,666ASPEN666,2012-03-05T23:11Z,I'm only after the specials... Dammit! I hate these shitty magnet links!!!!! The features such as file size or chose which files you want to download doesn't work with magnet links!.. does making magnet link pure crap!
,DaemoN67,2012-06-29T09:51Z,"Nah, most magnet links are okay (most of mine downloaded at 100kB/s, which is fast for my internet), but one out of five isn't good. They either have a really slow download speed, or don't download at all. This one for me took a couple of minutes to start, but if it was taking a long time, remember that this is over 60Gib. Unfortunately, because of this, I downloaded it straight to my 1.5TB external hard drive, so I can't seed, sorry. But thanks for the great torrent."
