How the hell can you mix up these two programmes? "
[T],renman,2010-03-18T18:02Z,While I am not infallible I simply don't make those sort of mistakes. Methinks your comments were intended for someone else's torrent as this IS what it states it is
,krist420,2010-03-20T18:27Z,can someone help me. i need the last 2 episodes of wild at heart and i have d/l this torrent twice but i still keep getting american hotrod. Do you have the same problem? or is my computer screwed
[T],renman,2010-03-21T02:06Z,Oh dear it sounds like yo are deffo having probs matey. I assure you it's not this or the other torrent causing your problem
,krist420,2010-03-21T17:49Z,"oh dear, must have some virus problem, thanx anyway renman, ive never had a problem with any of your other torrents so i guess it must b a prob on my side of things."
