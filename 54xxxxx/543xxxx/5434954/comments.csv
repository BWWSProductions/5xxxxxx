Posting to Piratebay is currently not working but editing previous threads is possible so use the magnet link instead and enable DHT."
,BasilBrush,2010-03-14T22:30Z,"All the torrents are cross posted on Demonoid under the username 'tdf2007':
www[dot]demonoid[dot]com/files/?uid=3469164"

,BasilBrush,2010-03-16T14:16Z,"Looks like Piratebay won't be fixed by 17th March 2010. I'll cross post the FIS and IBU torrents to Demonoid. If you use the magnet link try manually adding the tracker:
http://tracker[dot]openbittorrent[dot]com:80/announce
and enable DHT. This'll help you find the seeders quicker."
