,panthar,2010-09-12T06:00Z,"Guys, just a friendly warning here. I just got served (lol) a DMCA copyright infringement notice from my ISP. IF you are going to download this torrent make sure you are running something like peerblock to put these asshole ESA bullies in their place. I think they caught my IP because I had accidentally forgot to start my PeerBlock application when seeding this game. "
,Farion911,2010-11-21T02:49Z,"I'm using DeSmuME 0.9.6, it plays but it's laggy anyway to make it faster?"
,king_coo,2010-12-29T02:12Z,"This torrent doesn't work.

I've down loaded 3 different emulators and all of them could not play this game correctly. I would get a black screen when I played for an hour or so. If the screen didn't turn black then at some point the game would freeze.

If someone knows of an emulator that works for this game please let me know.

I have windows 7 home premium.

P.S. I tried all the emulators listed in the comment's above."
,ovi2wise,2010-12-31T20:29Z,"im also playing in desmume and it lags like mad, i went to config and there is a tick box where its suggested i untick and the game works a lot better, but isnt there a key that speeds up the game while you play it like the gba emulators?"
,ShiroEnd,2011-02-26T11:31Z,unticked it but speed didnt change
,uking94,2011-03-10T19:07Z,will this work on a real dsi with an r4 card?
