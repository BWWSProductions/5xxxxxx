This mighty saga started over a year ago, when one of my Canadian DJ Hosts pointed out that most of my existing Karaoke was Sun Fly and Sound Choice were better.   He was right, for there attention to details on the backing vocals and music is second to none and the mass swap out began.   Loads of time and cash later the collection of over 10,000 tracks are mostly all Sound Choice.   I do have to look else where for chart hits outside of North America where Sound choice fall down a little.

Thanks again to the original seed of the 3000 torrent, for whom I owe this series for I very much doubt if I could be bothered to re rip all my Karaoke CD's for this lot.

Thanks to the authors of two low cost but very good items of shareware...

1.   Windsome file renamer         http://www.filerenamer.net/
2.  Tag & Renamer                        http://www.softpointer.com/tr.htm

Who helped automate the otherwise very painful rename and tag process for all my units and now you!   If you still use physical media and official Karaoke hardware then check out the original seed for that is still in the Sound Choice format and tags.

I hope you enjoyed the series and your PC collection looks all the better now for my hard work.

One day, one day soon I hope, Karaoke companies will realize that not everyone uses physical media any more and the advantages of using OtsAV Pro or other Audio and Video Discotheque software simply blow Karaoke CD Players out of the water, and they will wake up and issue correctly tagged Karaoke on a CD as PC files just like this download and save me all the bother.
