was wondering if you have the ability to find a specific cdg volume? Movie Madness - Vol. 2 from sound choice spot light series
specifically the song   ""We All Die Young - Steel Dragon""   thanks, as well wondering how you used your program to fix the annoying chartbuster backward name file issue, ie.  John, Elton instead of Elton John  , i tried the 2 programs you listed before, but couldn't seem to find the easy solution to the problem. I have about a 1000 tunes listed this way, and individual rename would take forever

thanks again for all your hard work and great selections
Dan 

remember people don't be greedy seed , return the favor, your download rates will reward you for this  "

,rhi-aonifal,2011-10-23T10:05Z,"soundchoice is quickly being banned in many venues due to the trolling lawyers they have hounding people for a 1:1 disc to song inventory. If you play soundchoice legitimately or not you may still encounter a fine! Those who are reading this and are GIGGING KJ's you run a real risk here (being as this is a place of non legitimacy) i know some come here vs the 15 minute rip for a disc you may have, but really , watch out, or @toerelect switch back to sunfly.

Here is my Customer's selections....
Pop/Electronic music, Sunfly
country, Chartbuster
Rock, Sound choice/Some sunfly

keep in mind sound choice may not ever create any new discs but still make money from law suits... see their site.... so blank out sound choice from all cdg files and enjoy a non trademark infringing good time!"
