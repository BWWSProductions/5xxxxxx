Het betreffen volledig digitaal remasterede films dus zelfs de oudste films zien er nu glashelder op een lcd tv uit door de hedendaagse technieken !"

,ady22,2010-03-29T16:52Z,How do I get this working? I've got Daemon Tools and MAGIC - ISO but can you tell me what I can do to get it running without having to burn it to disc please.
,ady22,2010-03-30T00:32Z,"This didn't work for me, maybe I did it wrong? I d/l'd a prog called Starport and mounted it then went to load that virtual drive in DVDplayer but it wasn't having none of it. not used to bd iso's tbh usuallu when you mount an .iso it gives you the dvd folder's which it did, but which file do you select to play the movie???"
,exateit,2010-04-02T09:25Z,"Download ImageBurn and mount the downloaded image file into ImageBurn and burn to a writable bluray disc.

Works fine, english audio is there + Menu's + 3 or 4 trailers.  Picture quality is excellent in 1080p.

No problems at all with this upload, and thanks a lot for this great upload!"
,exateit,2010-04-02T09:26Z,"If you want to extract the image, bit pointless really you can use ISOBuster, the cracked versions usually dont work for long or at all, and unfortunately if you dont want a cracked version then you need to pay for this program!"
,muzm_an,2010-08-20T11:00Z,"I am sort of stuck at ~85 %. Download rate is 4.3 kB/s even though my upload is > 250 kb/s. I have already uploaded 65 GB.

Could the seeders increase their bandwidth please. At this rate it will take weeks to finish.

Thank you."
