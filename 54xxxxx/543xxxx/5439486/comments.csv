,sudhan,2010-04-27T00:24Z,Get into demonoid and get the crack.
,tellmz,2010-05-04T09:33Z,"So you finally downloaded the oxford dictionary 
but to run- it requires a CD to be inserted first. 
You don't need a CD or Crack to use the 
software. Just follow these steps and you will 
wonder how easy it is!

And if you like it- Please use your PayPal to say 
me thanks! Please. And yes, if you are having any 
problem just mail me the link I will give you the 
solution.
 nikhilsoni.wn@gmail.com 

So, lets first solve this one..

1. Extract OALD8 with Winrar or Winzip.       OK

2. Double click on Setup.    [30.8 MB]        OK

Install !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3. Go To /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\___

C:\Program Files

4. Hover your Mouse on Oxford Folder. It will display 
[30.8 MB] same as setup size. This means that necessary 
program files are already installed on your computer but 
the only thing is missing is Oxford data.

Friend, this is the reason why it ask for a CD. So to prove 
yourself smarter and not let oxford fool you in their 8th edition. 
What you have to do in this last step is to copy the unsaved data to 
your C:\ drive. Check it out!

5. Go back_ to your extracted OALD8 zip files and from there copy [oald.data] 
folder. Rush to..

 C:\Program Files\Oxford\OALD8  

and paste [oald.data] folder just there. Please select [Yes To All] and close all 
open windows. Your desktop is now visible to you & please hold your breath (not more than 10 seconds!) and click on Oxford Advanced Le... icon on desktop. Solved```````````````````

No crack and Just cracked!"

,Biohazard870,2010-09-10T23:17Z,"The right procedure to crack Oxford advanced learner's Dictionary 8th edition 

follow these steps and you'll be able to fix all problems about your dictionary 


1. download the torrent 
2. install daemon tool lite -
3. mount image and install the application 
4. download mozilla from http://ifile.it/udx0ovp
5. extract mozilla 
6. double click on the extracted folder
7. when you open the folder you'll find many files in it 
but we just need there is mozilla.exe 
8. copy it and paste it on desktop
9. now go into the directory of oxford dictionary in c:\
there you'll find the .exe file of the application 
right click on it then click on rename and then copy the text of .exe file in rename mode
10. now go to the desktop and rename your mozilla.exe file which we already have copied on the desktop. 
11. replace the text of (mozila.exe) with the text we copied from the .exe file of the dictionary(it would be old8 i think)

now copy the new  mozilla.exe file from the desktop which would have become OALD8.exe
and paste it on the installed directory( or follow the path 
C:\Program Files\Oxford\OALD8\ and paste it) 


just paste it like a crack file, the way in which we usually 
crack games. 
if you find any trouble with this just add me in your msn account 
i'll help in every posible way ( and sorry for the weird english :) coz em not a native speaker)

,god_is_great,2010-09-22T04:31Z,"this is a great torrent. very easy to use. i am using windows 7 home premium 64 bit os

1. First of download the torrent.
2. Use a virtual drive software to mount the .iso image.( i use virtual clone drive )
3. Run setup file (30.8 MB in size) and install the dictionary in a location you would like to install.
4. Go to the folder you installed the dictionary in and see the size of folder. it should be somewhere around 559 MB. If it is not close to this then go to the .iso file image and open the mounted file and copy the oald.data in oald8 of your folder where you installed the dictionary. On opening the folder you would see a oald8 application file. This is the file we need crack for.
5. Next you need is the crack file. go to this site
http://www.filestube.com/7aa4c30948eb259c03e9,g/oald8-crack.html
and download the crack file. It will be in .rar format so use a software like 7-Zip to unrar it and on opening you would find a file named oald8
6. cut this file and replace with the one in the installation folder under oald8
7. you are ready to go run this same file oald8 and the dictionary opens up."
,prnscr,2010-10-02T17:43Z,"First of all you dont need a crack.
Follow the instructions by tellmz.
DO NOT run setup.exe from a CD(emulated or not).
Copy it to your harddisk first then run it.
After that copy oald8.data folder to the installation folder; overwriting the existing one."

,marnild,2010-11-29T22:53Z,"This is a seriously frustrating download.. There are no instructions, no cracks, and the nice people who try to help are all saying different things..

I tried all the suggestions, have tried both extracting the folder installing it from there, have tried demon tools etc.. nothing works..

On my computer (Using win 7) this download DONT WORK WITHOUT A CRACK ! 

I took a chance and downloaded a crack file, the one suggested by ""God-is-Great"" above, it contains simply the .exe file, i copied it and pasted it to the directory where i had the dictionary installed.. THAT WORKED .. ! 

THX for the upload pnkj, though i prefer not having to play sherlock holmes everytime i need a new programme.. 
thx to God_is_Great.. without him this torrent would be useless for me.. 

It would be nice if someone would merge the crack and the programme into 1 torrent !  "

Also thank you tellmz and prnscr for the intructions
Work for me with no problem.
I don't why people have problem with this maybe I using WinXp Sp3
What I do is  
1)Extract setup.exe and oald8.data folder from the OALD8.iso and nothing else using WinRAR
2)Copy setup.exe to desktop and double-click it.
3)After setup finish and I chose not to start the program
4)Copy the oald8.data folder to C:\program files\Oxford\OALB8
5)Click on the OALB8 shortcut on the desktop and it work like a charm.

Best of all, I copy the whole Oxford folder into my thumb drive and it also work on my office PC too by just double-clicking oald8.exe in the folder.

I don't about other OS but WinXp Sp3 confirmed work!"

Here is the crack again, if some one can not find it.

1. First of download the torrent.

3. Run setup file (30.8 MB in size) and install the dictionary in a location you would like to install.
4. Go to the folder you installed the dictionary in and see the size of folder. it should be somewhere around 559 MB. If it is not close to this then go to the .iso file image and open the mounted file and copy the oald.data in oald8 of your folder where you installed the dictionary.
