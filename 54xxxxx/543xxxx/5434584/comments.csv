,voltorb,2010-04-16T14:29Z,"Thanks, great upload.. Anyone else having problems with those .m4v files?"
,Legalize70It2,2010-07-09T12:31Z,"VLC should play those .mkv files just fine.  Otherwise if you absolutely HAVE to play it in a certain video player, I\'m sure the codecs are a quick Bing search away.  (Google is eVil)nnI\'m gonna give myself a project pretty soon to make compressed versions of this and others that haven\'t been made yet."
