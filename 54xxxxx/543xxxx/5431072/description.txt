                    Effy has been in a psychiatric hospital, but  
                    with the help of Anthea and her counsellor John  
                    Foster she finds the will to get stronger and  
                    return home. Effy is worried, but she is  
                    assured that so long as she is disciplined she  
                    will be ok. Her life is now dictated by routine  
                    and self-control. Anthea has completely cleared  
                    out her room so there's no evidence of the old  
                    Effy remaining. She appears happy, clear and  
                    hopeful for the future. She goes to visit  
                    Freddie and tries to pick up where they left  
                    off, but it's not that easy now that she has to  
                    live life by the strict routines she has set  
                    herself. Freddie and Anthea become concerned  
                    about her, she's stronger and more self-assured  
                    than ever, but something isn't right.

                    Due to technical problems we are unable to cap
                    encrypted channels at the moment. We have given
                    other groups some time to do a hdtv release of
                    this episode but it looks like nobody else
                    capped it so here is a pdtv release.
                    
                    The episode is repeated on Monday and Tuesday.
                    We will do a hdtv release if we can get our
                    problems fixed in time to cap one of those
                    repeats.
