,safenelle,2010-03-13T07:12Z,How can i launch the 29 files? Do I have to unzip them or smthn else?
,teikyo30,2010-03-13T08:56Z,"Seriously? lol, okay, right-click on the rar file and pick extract to here. Make sure you have winrar or 7zip. That's it, the files extract to the movie file. Back in the old days it would make a bin and cue file and you then needed another program to make the movie file, that was annoying (or you could watch with vlc player which plays nearly anything)."
,safenelle,2010-03-13T09:19Z,"So I have to unzip all thos 20 something files?!
lol, yeah, there really are people that might not understand what to do with 29 small files that need to end up in one movie file.."
,Jewellz,2010-03-13T15:30Z,Thanks.
,tfizz,2010-03-13T18:41Z,"@safenelle- I have known how to ""unrar"" a file using WinRar for about 15 years now---since I was 10 years old.

Its your fault- If you are going to download torrents- learn your basic fundamentals or GTFO nigger

toodles- good day PB"
,mattmcfadyen,2010-03-14T22:06Z,"It's easy as to unrar, to click on any of the rar files and select unzip, or unrar, or expand, or whatever your program says"
,safenelle,2010-03-19T09:21Z,"I know how to ""unrar"" a file, I just got confused when i saw that there are 29 files that need to be ""unrar""'ed.

I'm as white as your ass ;)"
,snakeboy69,2010-03-19T14:36Z,"tfizz said it best.  If you don't know how to unrar something then what the fuck are you doing downloading torrents?  You telling me this is the first time you've ever encountered a multi-part rar? 
You say you know how to unrar, but clearly you don't because unraring one file and unraring 99 of them is exactly the same procedure.  You'd know that if you've ever unrar'd a single rar file in your life.
You are a special kind of idiot that should be banned from using electricity, never mind the internet.  Ever heard of google?  You fucking nitwit.  Start at the beginning like everyone else, go educate yourself."
