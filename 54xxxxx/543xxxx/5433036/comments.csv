,imrealgod,2010-03-14T18:40Z,"FXG, are you gonna upload ""The Road""???"
,Quantum12,2010-03-16T00:51Z,"Quality is pretty much perfect, as it always is on an FXG release. Film is pretty good too. No fancy special effects here, just really solid acting and a good script. Incalculably better than the deplorable shitbombs Hollywood are currently producing to try and claw themselves out of the recession. Spare me Saw 46, I beg you."
