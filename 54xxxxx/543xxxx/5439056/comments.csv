,gkiller9,2010-05-24T11:40Z,^^ Same.  Receiving an error with the installer when trying these.  No error message is written to the sims log either.  Anyone else getting this?

,tgcleader,2010-08-12T20:12Z,You have to have High End Loft Stuff installed. I used one with an img file that can be updated normally with no problems. Cause I tried installing stuff  too and got an erro cause the items did work with just the sims 3.
,BigJIm35,2010-08-13T14:43Z,Hi.  I don't seem to see the icon to initiate the download for these items.  Are they still available?
