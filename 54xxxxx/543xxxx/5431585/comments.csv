,halfmonkey,2010-03-13T03:50Z,"OK. I now have a fast PC and have tried to encode 2 movies using Ripbot and the associated programs and both have been perfect quality, but are either missing chapters or start OK, but have parts of the ""Extras"" as the main part of the film - I've tried putting all the contiguous original rips into one folder and encoding from that folder, but it only encodes part of the film (as if its missing a playlist to stitch the proper parts back together?) Am I doing something wrong or can only certain Blu-ray discs be encoded? (I was trying Enemy of The State and Deja Vu which have split files as the original source from the ripped discs)...."
[T],bricktophd,2010-03-13T13:32Z,u dont need to stitch them at all just grab the first fileof the main movie and ripbot will seem it together.
,halfmonkey,2010-03-13T14:39Z,"I did that, chose the first file (checked as it was the beginning of the film) and tested it on my PS3 once converted thinking it was OK to seed and about 40 mins in the next portion was part of the extras from the disc - Ripbot had put the second file as part of the extras on the disc.."
[T],bricktophd,2010-03-14T05:34Z,every once in a while u get one that is a pain to convert. the other option is to us tmuxer and put all the pices in the right order and m2ts mux them into 1 file then load that into ripbot. make sure u dont put the new file in the folder with the old ones it sometimes gives problems
,halfmonkey,2010-03-14T08:52Z,"Thanks. I've re-run Ripbot and it seems OK. I only watched half the film last night, so I'll wait until I've watched all of it before I pass a sigh of relief - It's a shame it takes so long to convert. I have a brand new PC and it still takes approximately 5 hours."
,DGray978,2010-03-15T13:31Z,Is it possible to add a subtitles on these files that PS3 Team is doing?
,normalicy,2010-03-29T22:09Z,"Does this include the special features?  If not, would someone be kind enough to load them too?  My wife is in one of the deleted scenes & it's only on the Bluray version & I don't have a Bluray player."
,iBox01,2010-04-17T19:02Z,do you have american gangster in blu ray ?
