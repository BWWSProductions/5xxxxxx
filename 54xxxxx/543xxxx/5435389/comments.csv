,Cold-FX,2010-03-15T08:43Z,"Hi !
I want to precise somethings about the game.
This game include a launcher who can :
- change your nickname
- connect to our server
- connect to our ventrilo audio server

He contains an update support, so we can modify it when we want.

BUT ! This version of the launcher is in french only ( for the moment, a multilanguage update is in developpement ). And a little detail on Windows XP, the background is dark, normally he's gray, --> because it's black some text are hide. Sorry for my bad english... And all this will be corrected in the new update who will be accessed via the Mise Ä‚  Jour button first click on Verifier la version and click on other button when they're unlocked"
,Cold-FX,2010-03-15T08:55Z,"And I forget to write infos about the new version.

With the new version you can launch a server easily ( no commands are needed, just select your map, name, password and run the server )
In development -> english support
                       -> "" server list"" support (not in game, in the launcher )
                       ->French / English language change ( actually the game text is in french -> can be modified in the rev.ini, in the game directory )"
,Cold-FX,2010-03-15T08:59Z,"If you want to help us to traduce the launcher, in other language or who have a problem with the game register and discuss here http://flarf.xooit.fr/t47-English-Section-Trad-problems-Temp.htm

I'VE FORGET SOMETHING !!! ON VISTA / SEVEN, YOU MUST RUN THE LAUNCHER IN ADMINISTRATOR MODE !!!"
