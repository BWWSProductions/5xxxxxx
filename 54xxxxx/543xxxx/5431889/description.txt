These are some assorted Aynsley Lister songs (33) I've recorded from 

Bellyup4blues.com. I've ran some thru wavepad sound editor to 

clean them up a little. The songs are MP3's running mostly at 

128 kbps;  good for walkmans and the like...lol. Just a note, 

one song in particular, Without You (EXT), I liked the song a 

little too much so I actually extended it by a few minutes... 

it's a different version than the original. Hope you enjoy his 

tunes.

Please post a comment if things aren't up to par, I don't want 

to do his music an injustice!

Cheers,
