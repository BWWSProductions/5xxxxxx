The first album of "Mind Necrosis Factor" features melodic soundscapes through electronic and industrial ambiences. "Entropy" describes a dark world where minimalist and depressive voices flutter on distorted rhythms. The 9 tracks mix crystalline textures and corrosive patterns within atmospheric themes. Based on additive and repetitive constructions, these tracks reveal one long and expressive rise, leading to an explosive climax.
