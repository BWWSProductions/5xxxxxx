,owley,2010-04-22T16:05Z,hats off to u mate !!!
,ysin21,2010-05-04T11:24Z,Is this in the right order? I think they might b mixed up.
,noOrp,2010-05-27T10:22Z,Thanks a lot ! :D
,freqazoidiac,2010-08-29T10:30Z,"Superb transfer for a DVD sized package.
The file format was unknown to me when I opened it up, but it's just a variation of .AVI wrapper. If anyone on a Mac has problems with these files, just make sure you have at least Quicktime 7x and Perian installed. Thanks so much! Really enjoyed the first four episodes tonite with my Gal. Downloaded in 1 hour and a half on a basic internet connection. Amazing."
,Marncia,2010-10-25T03:09Z,"O, thank you SFM for this! I just discovered the show a few days ago and it just might be the best american comedy I have ever seen. How is it possible that it didn't get good ratings?"
,mandarp,2011-01-13T17:52Z,good video quality but the subs don't synch up
,PCorMac,2011-01-14T19:45Z,The quality even when full screen is still great. If you move the subs to another folder or even delete them they won't load and thus you won't have to look at them on the screen. They are all the .srt files. Good job RiddlerA!
,solanus,2011-01-20T05:57Z,"WARNING: Episodes are NOT in order. 5 and 6 are switched, 7 and 8 are switched. Quality is fine, but seriously?"
,solanus,2011-01-20T09:59Z,"Correction - according to wikipedia this is actually the preferable order in terms of continuity. However, the episodes are still mislabeled."
,solanus,2011-01-20T22:49Z,Does anyone know if other episodes are out of order?
,klu9,2011-01-23T23:26Z,"thank you so much.

""Small file size, execllenet quality"" YES!. Is there a group/forum/list that collates the releasers doing this?"
,mandarp,2011-01-27T10:24Z,awesome quality
,mandarp,2011-01-27T14:33Z,"awesome quality

,mandarp,2011-01-28T12:58Z,"can anyone tell me the proper viewing order such that the 'in the next episode' part at end of each episode coincides with next episode
"
,NoodleBaker,2011-02-01T02:19Z,"Okay, guys, I'm here to clarify a few things, and to explain how I fixed the ""episodes out of order"" issue.
First of all, not everything shown in the ""in the next episode"" bit, at the very end of each episode, actually happens in the next episode. Some of it is actually wrapped up IN that bit, instead of further concluded or continued in the following episode.

As for the issue everyone has been having, THE EPISODES *ARE* IN FACT IN THE PROPER ORDER!! CONFIRMED BY BOTH NETFLIX AND IMDB!!
***All I did was move all of the subtitle files to a different folder, and voila!*** Before I moved the subtitles, it was not playing the episode I clicked on. I would attribute this to the fact that the subtitles have to have the same name as each episode, but some glitch must have happened. Either way, I don't really give a shit. This is what worked for me, so please stop whining.

To RiddlerA: Excellent upload buddy! Thanks a ton!"
,NoodleBaker,2011-02-01T02:20Z,"Oh, and, MANDARP, knock off the comment spam bro. 5 comments in a row is unnecessary."
,Fleabr,2011-02-26T21:00Z,"It's possible to get the chronological order on the wikipedia page.

I understand that this is in the correct broadcast order but it'd be nice if you'd put an explanation."
,Fleabr,2011-02-27T17:36Z,"A heads-up, the subtitles are completely out of sync, at least on the 1st season.

And the episodes names are mixed up.

Charity Drive = Visiting Ours

My Mother The Car = In God We Trust

Missing Kitty = Alter Egos"
,alagrande,2011-03-10T07:44Z,Some of you are commenting on the in last episode and next episode discrepancies compared to what actually happened or what is shown. I borrowed the DVD's from a friend and this was the case beginning in the second season and maybe continued into the third season. The show schedule was reduced as it was it was being aired during the second and third season. I began to think I missed something. I think they just cut episodes out of the season to shorten it all together. 
,alagrande,2011-03-10T07:57Z,Are these copies explicit or censored?
,alagrande,2011-03-10T08:07Z,"Yeah, forget my previous post. The episode order is not correct. "
,stlctan,2011-03-29T01:49Z,"THESE EPISODES ARE IN CORRECT ORDER
A 9
V 9

One of the best shows ever on TV, hope the movie comes together this yr"
,pengos,2011-03-30T02:26Z,Pls Seed. Give back what u take. Its so goddamn slow.
,Smooth_Pianist,2011-03-31T23:59Z,"@Noodlebaker

I should clarify that I just watched the first season, and the labels for some of the episodes actually ARE mixed up you total douche -- check the three episode labels 'Missing Kitty', 'Altar Egos' and 'Justice Is Blind' (all three are mixed, e.g. the episode labelled 'Missing Kitty' is actually 'Justice Is Blind'. 

Moron, just checking the order of the episodes does NOT mean that the labels are right...I can only say this for the first season though as I have not got any further than that.

(Thanks RiddlerA, great torrent, good quality and great file-size. Long live Arrested Development!)"
,devlin679,2011-05-03T06:49Z,quality is complete SHIT. Maybe its okay for a computer screen but on my TV it was HORRIble. quicker download times < better quality. Id go for the one wit about 9 Gb 
,gdtms28,2011-05-14T01:28Z,"The titles may be listed in order, but they are indeed mislabelled on several files. This has nothing to do with the end-clips - they're simply wrong. If you want to verify it with IMDB as you said you did, then actually read the episode summaries and compare to what's in the videos."
,Ginlyf,2011-05-26T11:23Z,Dude! You're fucking awesome man!! love your uploads! Thanks a lot for all of them :D
,noizyme,2011-06-06T07:51Z,Awesome torrent!  I'll be watching this for years to come (possible movie?).  Thanks to all the seeders; I'll be doing my part for at least a week.
,thePegglegg,2011-06-20T19:49Z,"For those wondering if the episodes are in the correct order, I found this on wikipedia: 

The episodes below are listed by the order on the DVD and not their original broadcast order, as there are three instances where Fox aired the episodes out of chronological order."
,Jiia,2011-06-23T05:48Z,"What is this crap? 

- The video quality is HORRIBLE: 389kbps. That's the bitrate of a high quality MP3.

- The subtitle FPS is out of sync, not to mention offset.

If you like to watch your shows at least in standard quality, stay the hell away form this torrent."
,penwickpark,2011-07-29T17:46Z,thanks very much for this!

,Monstruoso,2011-12-20T22:42Z,"Season 1 episodes are listed after air date, to file it correctly check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arrested_Development_episodes and compare ep # and air date."
