,ToastieBeast,2010-09-30T20:01Z,"Can you get this for the PC? If it's not possible, then ill guess i can stop looking for it then. I got the original game but it does NOT work. :("
,BULLTRON,2012-03-10T01:50Z,"Okay, what's the deal with this iso shit?  There's no autorun installer after I mount it, and when I open the file to view all the other shit, the only thing that makes sense is a .bin file called DUMMY but it won't mount.  Don't ignore this torrent, noobish!  Help me out here, anybody."
