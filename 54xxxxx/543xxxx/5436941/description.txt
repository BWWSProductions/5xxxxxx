   From the company that revolutionized vocal production with Auto-Tune  comes 
   AVOX  Evo  -  the  newest generation  of  the  Antares  Vocal Toolkit.  Now

   Evo combines ten state-of-the-art vocal processing modules to give you  the 
   power you need to create stunning vocal tracks in any musical style as well 
   as design unique vocal effects for audio post-production applications.  
             
             
   New in  AVOX Evo  is the  incorporation of  Dr. Andy's  groundbreaking Evoâ„¢

   seamless, natural-sounding (if you want it to be) throat modeling, AVOX Evo 
   plug-ins  just work  better. Leaving  you free  to focus  on creating  your 
   music.    
             
   Other additions include  redesigned user interfaces  for the original  five 
   AVOX  plug-ins,  five  integrated  channels  of  our  unique  CHOIR   Vocal 
   Multiplier in  Harmony Engine  Evo, high-quality  pitch shifting  in THROAT 
   Evo, tempo-synced alienization rate in MUTATOR Evo, and more. And at a new, 
   lower  MSRP, AVOX  Evo matches  its unbeatable  creative power  with truly 
   unbeatable value 
             
             
             
   Harmony Engine Evo Vocal Modeling Harmony Generator 
             
   Harmony Engine  Evo is  a real-time  harmony generating  plug-in that  puts 
   professional-quality  vocal  harmony  arrangements  within  reach  of   any 
   songwriter, producer, musician or engineer.  
             
   With  four  independent  harmony  voices,  a  variety  of  powerful harmony 
   generating modes, humanization features for natural sounding  performances, 
   five integrated  channels of  CHOIR Vocal  Multiplier, and  a flexible real 
   -time preset system for harmony and vocal type, Harmony Engine Evo provides 
   incredibly easy-to-use tools  to quickly and  easily produce virtually  any 
   vocal arrangement you can imagine.  
             
   Whether you're an experienced vocal arranger, a songwriter looking for that 
   perfect  backup  vocal,  or  a  composer  experimenting  with  unique vocal 
   effects,  Harmony Engine  Evo gives  you entirely  new ways  to create  the 
   harmony parts you hear in your head. In fact, experimenting with  different 
   harmonies is so  easy (and, dare  we suggest, fun),  you may find  yourself 
   using Harmony Engine  to explore harmonic  alternatives you may  have never 
   otherwise considered.  
             
             
             
   MUTATOR Evo Extreme Voice Designer 
             
   MUTATOR Evo provides a combination of tools for creating unusual, weird, or 
   downright wacky voices. With high-quality pitch shifting, throat  modeling, 
   pitch-tracking ring  modulator-based â€œmutation,â€  and a  mind-bending tempo 
   -synced Alienization function, MUTATOR Evo  is the perfect tool for  unique 
   special vocal effects and post-production sound design. 
             
             
             
   ARTICULATOR Evo Digital Talk Box 
             
   A modern-day version  of the venerable  talk box, ARTICULATOR  Evo lets you 
   extract  the  formant and  amplitude  information from  a  vocal (or  other 
   dynamic source)  and apply  it to  any other  audio track  or to a built-in 
   broadband noise generator. Perfect for talking guitars, singing synths, and 
   a wide range of special effects. 
             
             
             
   WARM Tube Saturation Generator 
             
   Based  on  Antaresâ€™  legendary  Tube plug-in,  WARM  warms  up  vocals with 
   Antares'  world-renown  analog  tube modeling  technology,  while  being so 
   processing-efficient that  you can  put an  instance on  pretty much  every 
   track in a project and still barely see your CPU meter twitch.  
             
   With two tube models, a variable Drive control to set just the right amount 
   of dynamic saturation,  and an innovative  OmniTubeâ„¢ function to  apply the 
   tube effect to the entire signal (as opposed to just the transients),  WARM 
   is a great-sounding, incredibly easy-to-use tool for giving your vocals the 
   benefits of a wide range of modeled analog tube effects. 
             
             
             
   ASPIRE Evo Aspiration Noise Processor 
             
   ASPIRE Evo is  the world's first  tool for modifying  a voice's breathiness 
   independently of its harmonic content. Whether reducing a bit of vocal rasp 
   or adding a bit of smokiness, ASPIRE Evo allows modification of the  amount 
   and quality of a voiceâ€™s  aspiration noise without otherwise affecting  the 
   vocalâ€™s harmonic characteristics.  
             
   When you speak or  sing, air from your  lungs is forced through  your vocal 
   chords,  causing  them to  vibrate.  The resulting  waveform  is propagated 
   through the throat, the mouth and out through the lips. It is the shape  of 
   these structures  that create  the resonant  characteristics that  define a 
   unique vocal identity.  
             
   But  going  into  a bit  more  detail,  the vocal  waveform  is  actually a 
   combination of two different components.  One, the one we usually  think of 
   as the primary element of  vocal timbre, is the harmonic  content generated 
   by the process described above.  However, there is a second  component that 
   is generated by the  turbulence of the air  rushing past the vocal  chords. 
   This component, aspiration  noise, does not  have harmonic content  and can 
   roughly be thought of as â€œbreathiness.â€  
             
   Aspiration noise presents itself in a variety of ways, from a subtle bit of 
   breathiness to a full-blown rasp. Of course, whether itâ€™s a problem or  not 
   depends on the amount of noise and the style of a performance. A whole  lot 
   of roughness that would work well  for screaming punk or roots blues  might 
   well be a problem for mainstream pop or a smooth ballad (of course, it also 
   might not). Up to now, there wasnâ€™t  much you could do about it. Now,  with 
   ASPIRE Evo, there is. 
             
             
             
   THROAT Evo Physical Modeling Vocal Designer  
             
   THROAT Evo is a revolutionary new vocal tool that lets you process a  vocal 
   through a  meticulously crafted  physical model  of the  human vocal tract. 
   THROAT Evo begins by neutralizing the effect of the original singerâ€™s vocal 
   tract and then gives you the ability to specify the characteristics of  the 
   modeled vocal tract.  
             
   THROAT Evoâ€™s controls allow you  to modify the voiceâ€™s glottal  waveform as 
   well as  globally stretch,  shorten, widen  or constrict  the modeled vocal 
   tract.  For  even  more detailed  control,  THROAT  Evoâ€™s graphical  Throat 
   Shaping display allows you to individually adjust the position and width of 
   five points in the  vocal tract model, from  the vocal chords, through  the 
   throat, mouth and  out to the  lips. THROAT Evoâ€™s  Breathiness controls let 
   you add  variable frequency  noise to  the model,  resulting in  a range of 
   vocal effects  from subtle  breathiness, to  raspiness, to  a full whisper. 
   Finally, THROAT Evo allows you to shift  the pitch of the voice up or  down 
   an octave to create a wide range of alternative vocal characters.  
             
   While  THROAT Evo  has been  designed to  allow subtle  modifications to  a 
   voiceâ€™s vocal quality, the range  of the controls also allows  the creation 
   of vocal  tract models  well beyond  the limits  of physical human anatomy, 
   offering  the  possibility  of   vocal  characteristics  that  are   simply 
   unattainable by any other means.  
             
             
             
   DUO Evo Vocal Modeling Auto-Doubler 
             
   DUO  Evo automatically  generates a  doubled vocal  part from  an existing 
   vocal. In addition to allowing programmable variation in pitch, timing  and 
   vibrato depth, for  even more realism,  DUO Evo also  includes a simplified 
   version of THROAT Evoâ€™s vocal modeling to provide timbral variation for the 
   doubled part. DUO Evoâ€™s output section gives you independent control of the 
   level and stereo position of the original and doubled voices.  
             
             
             
   CHOIR Evo Vocal Multiplier 
             
   Neither  a harmonizer  nor a  conventional chorus  effect, CHOIR  Evo is  a 
   unique processor that actually  turns a single voice  into 4, 8, 16,  or 32 
   distinct individual  unison voices,  each with  its own  pitch, timing  and 
   vibrato variations. The voices can, if desired, be spread across the stereo 
   spectrum. Assign an instance  of CHOIR Evo to  each of four voices  singing 
   four-part harmony and voilÃ , instant choir. . 
             
             
             
   PUNCH Evo Vocal Impact Enhancer 
             
   PUNCH Evo is a unique processor that, as its name implies, lets you quickly 
   and easily give your vocal more dynamic impact, allowing it to cut  through 
   a dense mix with clarity  and power. Combining advanced dynamic  processing 
   with  an incredibly  easy-to-use interface,  PUNCH Evo  gives professional 
   results while letting you focus on your music. 
             
             
             
   SYBIL Evo Variable Frequency De-Esser 
             
   SYBIL Evo  tames vocal  sibilance with  threshold, ratio,  attack and decay 
   controls as well as a variable  sidechain high pass frequency to match  any 
   vocal performance.
