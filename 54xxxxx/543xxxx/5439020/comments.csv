,azzaman77,2011-01-30T11:38Z,"Hi, I'm willing to download and seed for some time, but is it working properly? What's with that ""blank-screen"" joutilas is mentioning?
Could it be due to his ""old ps2 laser"" or your disc was dirty/scracthed when building image?
Is every thing OK :) ??
Please repy for the benefit of all others ;).."
