What would you do if you discovered you were turning to stone? What would that extraordinary circumstance do to your life?  Writer Joe Casey (Wildcats Version 3.0, X-Men, Superman) and Eisner Award-nominated artist Charlie Adlard (Walking Dead) answer these questions and more in this gut-wrenching original graphic novel drama.  Thomas Dare was an ordinary man with ordinary problems, until fate stepped in to turn his life upside-down. Make no mistake, this is no superhero origin story... Rock Bottom is an epic of human proportions.
