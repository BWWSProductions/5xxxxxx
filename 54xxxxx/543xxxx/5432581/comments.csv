,euphoria4949,2010-03-23T03:29Z,"COME ON PEOPLE!!! 
Been downloading it now for 36hours none stop on a 32Mb/s connection and its only at 8.2% complete!

Please SEED SEED SEED!!!

Limiting your upload rate as I know a lot of people do DOESN'T improve your download rate, it wont make it any fastest so if you have done this please stop it so other people can enjoy the movie! Thanks"
,euphoria4949,2010-03-25T03:26Z,"OMFG!!! 48 hours after my last comment and it's only moved from 8.2% to 12.4%!!!
Dame people that's less 500MB in 48 fucking hours!!!

After being downloaded for 88 hours none stop it's ETA for completion is ""22 FUCKING DAYS!!!"""
,euphoria4949,2010-03-25T03:30Z,Oh yeah almost forgot! I've downloaded 1.6GB but uploaded 19.3GB!!! -So for christ sake be fair and give something back............ SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED  SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED  SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED  SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED  SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED  SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED  SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED  
,euphoria4949,2010-03-28T10:32Z,"THAT'S IT I FUCKING GIVE UP!!! I QUIT!!!

In 5 years of uploading and downloading torrents on the net this is the first movie I have ever quit and given up downloading because of the shit DL speed!!
After a FULL week, 7 bloody days and 7 frickin nights of continuous none stop downloading it's only on !!!! 27.8% complete !!!!
A full week on a 32MB connection and it only reached 27.8%!!! I uploaded near 85GB and only downloaded 4.5GB and STILL had an ETA of 19days until completion!! That's a fucking joke!!

In the same amount of time I managed to DL 5 other Blu-Rays that had even less seeds, 2 copies of windows 7 and about 9/10GB of other data, movies and stuff!!

CONCLUSION: DON'T EVEN BOTHER!!! Until people stop being selfish and start uploading or stop restricting their upload speed its not worth the time!"
