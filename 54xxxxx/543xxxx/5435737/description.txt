                         - RELEASE NOTES -                         
                                                                         

       From dramatic pitch enveloped hits to squelchy filtered noises, Analog
       Drums contains a huge grab bag of multisamples all expertly programmed 
       for Ableton Live, Kontakt and Logic. Produced entirely on Doepfer, 
       LiveWire and MFB modular systems, Analog Drums was designed to pump the 
       modern DAW full of real diodes, resistors and transformers!

       This Micropak includes 5 'base' kits alongside a selection of looped 
       clips. The Ableton Live version includes a detailed programming of drum 
       racks employing Live 8's latest features. Each kit is paired with a 
       selection of MIDI based Live Clips for extensive editing capabilities or 
       simple 'drag and drop' song production.

       The Logic version of Analog Drums includes all 5 kits, multiple variation 
       kits and channel strips. A library of 50 SIAL (Software Instrument Audio 
       Loops) Apple Loops are also included.

       Analog Drums for Kontakt includes the 5 'base' kits, each one programmed 
       with a custom KSP GUI for fast tweaking and parameter adjustment. The 
       library of 50 Apple Loops can easily be integrated into any Kontakt 
       track, automatically time-syncing to your master session tempo.
