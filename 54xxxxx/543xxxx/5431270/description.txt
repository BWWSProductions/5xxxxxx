Get this brand new Voice Set Expansion Pack with thousands of new voices and sound files for ProFlight Emulator Deluxe. ProFlight Emulator Deluxe brings back the all time favourite Flight Simulator ATC program to FS2004 and FSX.

Features:

    * PFE version 2.00 supports the optional installation of our new voice set expansion pack which will give you and additional 59 newly recorded, specifically for PFE, regional voices.
    * Once installed there are new PFE options that allow you to use just the new voice sets, the old ones or a combination of both. If you choose to use both the original and new voice sets together you will have an unbelievable 103 different voices available.
    * The new voice sets include a much wider vocabulary and as such some of the new version 2 features will only be available when the Voice Expansion pack is installed. The new voice sets cover the following PF regions.... African, Arabian, Asian, Australian, British, Canadian, Caribbean, Dutch, French,German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latin American, Spanish and US.
    * Approximately 1,000 New call signs have now been added to the product in version 2. These include WizzJet, Air Contracts, WestJet, EasyJet, Monarch, TNT, etc, etc. These are additions and not replacements. So you should hear ATC using the full call sign rather than the three character airline ICAO or the first three letters only.
