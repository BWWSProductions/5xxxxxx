,V112,2010-03-29T19:14Z,Does anyone know when english version is released?
,Aemilius_Paulus,2010-04-25T23:38Z,"@V112

Sorry, friend, the game was made primarily by Russians, and released in Ukrainian as well as Polish. According to their site, there is no English version planned. That may change, but face it, the game is most interesting for us, Easterners.

I do have to say that Ogniem i Mieczem is infinitely better than M&B or Warband. After playing this, I felt that I could not go back to Warband, even though I have only had Warband for about two weeks before getting this game. 

The only weakness of With Fire and Sword/Ogniem i Mieczem is the bugs. They are very few (about five of them) but there are no solutions for them, and one of them can ruin your game. I am speaking about the prisoner bug, when the game crashes every time you sell, capture, move or disband prisoners. I just got it, and I will have to see if reinstalling this game will help. "

,Farkas444,2011-03-06T08:24Z,"I am from Hungary, and can't speak Russian (i am only 14, and we are learning English yet) only my father can talk in this language, so I need him when I play. And that is the problem. Currently he is in Germany and I can't figure out how to get serial...
So, PLEASE TELL ME ONE! THX, and respect for Tale Worlds!"
,Farkas444,2011-03-06T08:34Z,"Sorry, I understand now! There is a file, the update, and THEN i have to crack it. OK.
I download every paradox game that is not relased in Hungary! (It's a pity but this game only relased in 2011 April 21, but i can't live without it!:() "

,TheSexpistols,2011-04-26T10:07Z,"the game is superb i say

but it s unplayable,and i m an eastern!!

romanian actualy and i CAN T SPEAK RUSSIAN OR POLISH,it s like chinese"
,punkekahh,2011-04-27T15:31Z,"It seems to be a nice game
I just finished instalation and cracking, but, i'm brazilian, i just speak portugues, spanish, english and french, how-in-hell could i play this game?
People who released it should think that the internet and game's language is english. and although its history is linked to polish or russian story, idk, it cares the mount and blade name, and mount and blade is a strike in rpg world...
so, you guys whom know this language (moreover my game is all in ??????? ?? ? ?? ???) have fun. i'll try to play this way and wait for translation :)"
,handsomeguy,2011-04-29T17:31Z,euhm i have windows 7 i can t open the setup what do i do ?
,SveaVikingen,2011-05-03T10:09Z,why make a game in russian?? itÂ´s not like the story only effects eastern europe... sure mongolians (the horsepeople) but there are vikings like my self to. plus russian is like a minority language onlyt spoken in 1 country
,Kasseopea,2011-05-19T02:19Z,"Goddamn, im sorry for you ancestors, who had the misfortune to have a descendant like you.

For noobs: russian is spoken in all former UDSSR countries, so its a couple more then 1.

The another reason might be, that the developers were russians, but hey, why the fuck making a game in your own language, right?

god fckn moron"
