,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-03-18T22:04Z,...And about $40 cheaper as well lol. ;)
,shwaria,2010-03-20T22:58Z,"if you already split your drive into different partions, and you install 7 to a section different to your current one, will you get the option to change os's at the beginning"
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-03-21T17:00Z,"@shwaria 
I'm pretty sure it always gives you that option.  I did set up this copy of windows 7 on my friends computer and it successfully dual-boots windows 7 and windows xp now.  I hope this helps!"
,fishoto,2010-03-22T02:57Z,"anyone got 100%??

only loads of 22%, please seed!!!!"
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-03-23T00:10Z,"@ DanielRemains

Thanks for the upload, and I do have to admit that your version is newer, possibly/probably better, but I haven't run into any problems at all with this version as of yet."
,Crickers1,2010-03-24T18:51Z,Please seed. Its stopped at 22.8%
,kpbradley,2010-03-31T17:06Z,Will my Alcohol120 1.9.7.6221 work with this?
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-03-31T17:21Z,"@kpbradley

Yeah, I don't see any reason it wouldn't.  But if it doesn't just try like UltraISO or something, it's technically something you need to buy but there are serial keys and cracks everywhere.  If you can't find one that works, download a program called CRAAGLE, if they can't find you something, it can'tbe found."
,kpbradley,2010-03-31T20:42Z,"Sorry but, No serial needed, and registration right?"
,kpbradley,2010-04-02T00:32Z,It is saying Windows is not genuine?
,pjwrig,2010-04-02T15:11Z,"Doesn't load, does anyone have one that works?"
,kpbradley,2010-04-02T22:22Z,"$hit copy, stopped working in less than 12 hrs"
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-04-03T04:08Z,"@kpbradley

Try configuring a flash drive to load it.  I've been using this copy for over 2 months now and have had no problems.  Or, try this copy: httttp://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5351100/Windows_7_All-In-One_Pre-Activated_Release_2_by_Orbit30, just delete the 2 extra ""t""'s.  This is supposed to be a newer version.  I'm sorry this copy did not work for you."
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-04-03T04:08Z,And thanks for all the seeds guys!
,kpbradley,2010-04-14T15:51Z,"I installed this OS with no problem but I cannot use ""Grabbit"" It is so slow, prior to installing this I was using Vista Ultimate. Any ideas?"
,msmmpts,2010-05-03T13:19Z,can u tell me the included updates?
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-05-05T00:04Z,"@kpbradley  no, sorry I have no idea.

@msmmpts Yes, this version includes updates.  (But really I did mention that like 3 or 4 times lol)"
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-05-06T03:26Z,"@msmmpts
Sorry I misread your comment lol, my fault.  Um, it includes every update microsoft releases, when you first install this copy you will [robably need to download several updates and that will take a little while, there are a lot to list."
,msmmpts,2010-05-06T09:51Z,what about WAT update??
,DARKSUPR3MACY,2010-05-16T18:07Z,"Just a heads up to all; as of yesterday a couple of computers I already installed this on came up with a problem with it not being geniune.  This is NOT a problem, just download a windows 7 ultimate cracker, such as WGA Chewer, to remove the WGA checker."
,HussleFlow,2010-05-28T11:24Z,varifying dmi pool data.....success   help please?
,ptcruiser70663,2010-07-01T16:11Z,Methinks this is a scam. 91 GB not enough room to store the temporary files? C'mon now!
,pylopor,2010-08-03T06:48Z,"Thanks! works like a glove. To everyone do not download the update ""KB971033""
Hey Dark, are we suppoe to activate it? I didn't I'm just curious."
,pylopor,2010-08-03T06:53Z,"Thanks! Worked like a glove. To everyone who uses this, when you click updates make sure you look at the updates and uncheck ""KB971033"" because if you do it will pop up that it is not genuine or whatever.
Hey Dark, are you suppose to activate the version of windows or no? I'm curious and haven't yet."
,pylopor,2010-08-03T06:54Z,"(sorry for the duplicate, my desktop kept saying error so I jumped on my laptop)"
,headshooter,2010-08-10T15:21Z,can I install all new updates
,pylopor,2010-08-18T21:27Z,"@Headshooter, you can install everything except the update I listed. the KB971033"
,JonVanes,2010-11-04T23:29Z,New at this. Want to know if its a quick setup. Is there anything extra i have to do. And how can i install off my usb.
,happyjme,2011-08-20T17:52Z,"Im a newbie at this so bare with me.. lol
Is there a way to split the ISO file so it fits on multiple CD-RW's of 700 MB?  Just so I dont have to go out and by new disks if I dont have to. "
,happyjme,2011-08-20T22:54Z,"Its me again.  Ignore my last post. I figured it out. But now I have another problem. It's only giving me the options to install it in x82 or x64 versions, but the windows XP I have now is x32.  Is there a x32 option or am I able to run x64? I'm not going to try anything with it untill I get a response though. "
,happyjme,2011-08-20T23:01Z,"EDIT: 
to be more specific. I have a Gateway GT5028 with AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 DCP 4200=, MMX, 3DNow (2 CPUs) and my current OPS is XP professional (5.1, Build 2600).  DirectX 9.0c
In case you need to know. "
,kclaytontx,2011-09-05T01:47Z,"Thanx, hope this helps my problem. I have Vista and thanx to my son downloading viruses, had to reload the original programing. Now my sound won't work. I've tried everything that I can think of and can't get it to work. I have downloaded every driver even hinted at to work on the internet. I am doing this as a last resort. I have to wait for my tuition check later this month to buy a new computer. I can't wait to go MAC!"
,knarr26,2012-06-08T20:40Z,Hey does this come with drivers too. my harddrive crashed and I'm starting out with a new one.
,christopher.thorpe95155,2012-07-17T01:46Z,is this better than the home edition windows 7? sorry im new and havent a clue...
