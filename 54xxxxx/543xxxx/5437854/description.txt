Well, this is yet another copy of windows 7 ultimate.  I got this from a friend, it is preactivated, has not even one little virus in it, gives you the option to install either x32 bit or x64  bit operating system, as well as other standard perks like the ability to simply upgrade your current operating system to Windows 7 while keeping all your original programs except for your previous operating system.  It seems to be genuine and will, I repeat WILL download updates with no problems, (I remember that being the biggest issue for a while).  To install, simply burn it to dvd using any image burning software, MagicISO, UltraISO, etc...  If your a little bit more tech savvy look up how to install off of a USB device!  If you have any further questions feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer any/all questions you may have.  Hope you enjoy Windows 7!
