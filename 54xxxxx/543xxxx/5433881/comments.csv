,cintronix,2010-03-20T23:25Z,"I'm stuck at 86.8%.  I promise to seed for weeks.  I have a 25MB down/4MB up connection.  I'm downloading at .2Kbps, but uploading at 300+Kbps.  Even when I play with the upload speed, the download speed won't change.

Seed people PLEASE!!!"
,flavaflav,2010-03-23T04:13Z,@cintronix  I see about 25 peers I'm connected to have over 95% downloaded. So hopefully we should be getting some more seeders soon.  My computer's been overheating due to leaving it on all day and night.  Gotta start turning it off overnight at least.
,flavaflav,2010-03-23T18:32Z,new seeders coming up. oh yeah.
,Xsniper,2010-03-27T16:21Z,What's the format? Seeed the torrent. It is waaay too slow. THX.

,bbr11,2010-05-08T04:22Z,"In the calender it says to do cardio circuit but there is only polyometric cardio circuit :S can anyone confirm if they are the same thing or not. It seems like they are not to me because they use the two of them but there is ""cardio circuit"" in the dvd's. "
,russ0943,2010-05-22T21:07Z,I'll be seeding this for awhile.  Just gotta get it DL'ed first.  At 70% and only hitting about 10kb/s
,russ0943,2010-05-25T01:47Z,"Got it downloaded.  Perfect uncompressed quality!  10/10!    Thanks Flav.

,Entensify,2010-06-11T19:09Z,"All I got to say is... WOW! Audio and Visual is flawless! If your patient with your download the dvd will be worth it, or you can be impatient and get the smaller torrent on the other link. Yes, you will have to burn the images which are provided. All in all this is a great torrent, and the quality of it is immaculate! Like flavaflav says, ""Hey people, turn off your video game, put down the potato chips, get off your asses and work!"" lol Thanks for uploading flavaflav! and thanks for the seeders!"
,chris19978,2010-06-12T09:10Z,"I am getting a little angry my windows 7 computer is down, I am working on fixing it and I downloaded this on my MAC computer and I have not found anything to burn iso files from the MAC. Can someone help me out. Thanks"
,stuntz0rZ,2010-06-14T04:57Z,"come on peoples! SEED!! just started the download and my ratio is already 2.1

im putting out more than whats coming in :("
,LittleBuggerx,2010-06-21T05:54Z,"Not sure if it was just me but 2 of the CD's do not burn correctly, the chapters get completely out of wack. 

Max Interval Sports Training & Insane Abs
and
Insane Abs

Both are part of the extra 3 CD's included and don't seem to be mandatory to have for the program. They do play but the chapters are completely mixed up, any way to fix this after downloading it??"
,flavaflav,2010-06-21T07:28Z,@LittleBuggerx I found out later that this was a bootleg copy from China.  Wasn't till I tried the Insane Abs that I got the problem you mentioned. They're on the original DVDs that I bought and the ISOs.  If anyone knows how to fix that let us know but I believe the standard workouts and max interval sports training are ok. Maybe someone else can seed those individually.
,CRC1988,2010-06-21T07:28Z,"I've finished downloading this, how do I go about burning this to a CD"
,LittleBuggerx,2010-06-22T07:26Z,I just used MagicISO and a bunch of Sony CDs and they worked just fine
,stuntz0rZ,2010-06-30T09:57Z,the deluxe dvds really are out of whack as i tried them also. please try doing it again. ImgBurn ??
,stuntz0rZ,2010-07-07T14:37Z,israelis_r_pigs: these are whole dvd images.

,erikfx,2010-10-12T15:22Z,"Total insanity quality, THANKS MUCH DUDE, GREAT JOB!!!!
I will upload for couple of months, it's quite large file, in fact the largest i've downloaded ever, worth its size in gold. "
,Elperron71,2010-12-21T09:24Z,"Great work Flava flav. Awesome quality. About the workouts Insane Abs and Sports Training videos being all scrambled. I figured out it's probably because when you ripped the ISo file from the DVD, the CSS (Content Scrambling System) which is a copyright protection system used for preventing pirating DVDs, kicked in and scrambled everything up. Im currently trying to figure out a way on how to descramble already ripped ISO files, but no success :(. Anybody have an idea?"
,coolvicks,2011-01-07T19:12Z,"Dunno, why you had to package the ISOs as a single RAR file when you could've just made one torrent with all the different ISOs...!??"
,Stillborne,2011-01-27T18:51Z,"Yo flava:
11 of the disks are emaculate.
Problem is that everyone and i mean everyone has ripped the Max Sports and Insane abs dvd's when it was copy protected by the latest copy protection at that time. I see how that can happen. You check for faults on them and after about 6 or 7 of flawlessness you figure ""eh"" and just punch the rest out. I do the same.
Now, your DvD's are out everywhere and if they aren't pushing yours then they have done the same thing you did, understandably. 
Now that time has passed. and software more than likely has caught up with this protection do you think you can re-up the MAx sports and the Insane Abs? Yours were ripped with Excellent quality and no matter how many links others throw up....they just don't compare or work.
Appreciate it.   "
,lovetofly101,2011-02-14T20:17Z,It's saying that I'm exceeding filesystem limit size?  What does this mean? I have over 200 gigs of space available.  Any suggestions people??

Dude, I dont burn dvds any more or anything. 

How do I watch these on my computer?"
,kroan,2011-03-20T16:21Z,This is awesome. Thanks so much for all the work of putting this package together. I'm really excited to try this system!
,haddadbruce,2011-03-22T00:38Z,can someone please tell me how to use a .rar file?! it would be much appreciated.

,wanathan,2011-04-23T23:36Z,"You will be unable to download on FAT32. Make sure that your drive is NTFS. Also, if you like the routine support the industry by purchasing it from Beach Body. If it is worth it, they will get my money."

,tplewis,2011-06-09T15:12Z,If you don't know how to deal with the .rar search for Beach Body Insanity. There are other torrents that are mpeg or dvd rips which are much easier to deal with.
