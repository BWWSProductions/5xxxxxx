Few tips:

-unrar everything to a single new folder
-you need java in order to open the .jar keygen
-I couldn't get Geneious_win64_4_8_5_with_jre to work but you can download Genious 4.8.5 easily, just google it
-after installing Geneious 4.8.5, start the 14day pro trial and exit the program
-run keygen and patch installdir\iSeek.jar
-generate key!
