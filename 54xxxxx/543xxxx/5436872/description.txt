Dark Chords on a Big Guitar was a 2003 album by Joan Baez. The sound was more "rockish" than her prior releases, and it was composed of work by mostly Generation X songwriters, including Natalie Merchant, Ryan Adams and Steve Earle. The title was taken from a line in Greg Brown's song "Rexroth's Daughter". Critics and listeners were surprised that Baez's voice had lost little of its original power and beauty, given that she was sixty-two when she made the album.

The album was recorded at Allaire Studios, Shokan, New York, January - April 2003.

Album was produced by Mark Spector. Backing musicians included: George Javori and Duke McVinnie.

Baez dedicated the album to Michael Moore.
