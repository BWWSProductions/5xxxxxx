        Martin  Shaw  returns  as  1960s  Northumberland  in Inspector
        George Gently in four feature length films. The series  throws
        Chief Inspector Gently into a maelstrom of murders and mayhem,
        whilst lovingly recreating the swinging sixties as it  finally
        hits the North-East, in perfect and nostalgic detail.

        Chief Inspector George  Gently is the  classic unsung hero  of
        detective fiction and in Martin Shaws expert hands he becomes
        a passionate, growling, ex-army boxer. With his sidekick,  the
        ambitious and undisciplined  Detective Sergeant John  Bacchus,
        they make the perfect  police partnership, full of  warmth and
        humour. But even the closest  partners can come to blows  when
        Gently and Bacchus enter the boxing ring, to raise monies  for
        the police widows fund  but who will be knocked out for  the
        count of ten?

        Season 2, Episode 1: Gently with the Innocents

        Gently and Bacchus  investigate when elderly  Alfred Peachment
        is found murdered in the  grounds of the large house  where he
        lived alone, formerly a children's home which he superintended
        but now closed  for several years.  The house was  being sold,
        against his wishes, by a  committee headed by his ex-wife  and
        her  brother,  the  local  doctor,  to  the  seemingly callous
        property  developer  Cora  Davidson.  Harry,  Alfred's   mute,
        simple-minded gardener,  is the  chief suspect  and he attacks
        Bacchus.  Only overly  helpful local  copper Blacksmith  seems
        able to communicate  with the boy,  causing Bacchus to  resent
        him. A discussion  with an old  flame leads Gently  to suspect
        that Peachment may have been a paedophile, abusing children in
        his care, and that any of the suspects may be acting alone  or
        as a group of avengers, to punish him for past misdeeds.
