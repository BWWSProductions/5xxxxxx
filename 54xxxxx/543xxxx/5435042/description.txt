Touhou 12.5, also known as Double Spoiler, Bunkachou, and Shoot The Bullet 2, is part of ZUN's ongoing Touhou series of games, mostly shooters with a few fighters thrown in for good measure, and is a direct sequel to Shoot the Bullet, covering characters from Touhous 10-12.

From the Touhou Wikia:
In Double Spoiler, you can play as Aya Shameimaru or Hatate Himekaidou. Just like Shoot the Bullet, heroines must take pictures of various bosses and their bullet patterns while avoiding them as well.
