Lucy is eleven years old. Having been neglected by her estranged mother and father, she is placed in a children's home. Through her eyes, we follow Lucy's struggle to cope with the system. Her saving is her self-belief and her certainty that she is being watched over and protected by the holy spirit. Hers is a heroic quest for love, beauty and transcendence.

With a barebones narrative and a visual depth of compassion, this is the life of a young child, any child, caught up in the British care system. Seen through the eyes of an eleven-year-old girl, this, a child's journey and first steps into a wider world. Her desire for recognition is both low on dialogue and high on sentimental empathy of how the physical and emotional abandonment of both parent, and an indifferent system and their respective responsibilities, can isolate and do harm.
