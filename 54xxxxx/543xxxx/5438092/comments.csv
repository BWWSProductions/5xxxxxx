,Juggalo559M,2010-03-19T13:50Z,I Dunno where everyone is saying this is a bad movie i actually liked it even though i am a die  hard George A. Remero fan when it comes to his zombie movies i actually think it is good i mean not his best work but good i still think his best work was the 1990 Classic Remake of Night Of The Living Dead but other then that his zombie movies are still the best!

Actually,the 1990 NotLD was a remake directed by Tom Savini, not Romero."
