 The horror comedy Zombieland focuses on two men who have found a way to      
 survive a world overrun by zombies. Columbus is a big wuss -- but when       
 you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive.            
 Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single            
 determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with  
 Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the      
 zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each   
 other or succumbing to the zombies.
