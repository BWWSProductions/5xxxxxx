you get to explore Aliceâ€™s magical world (just follow her down the rabbit hole!) on your Nintendo Wii! Not only that, itâ€™s Tim Burtonâ€™s version of Wonderland, so you know itâ€™s going to be colorful! In fact, the graphics are SO colorful in this game, they almost make you want to believe in magic again. Everything from the characters (who actually resemble the actors in the movie) to the environments look very magical, and the voiceovers in the game are phenomenal â€“ most of them are done by the actual filmâ€™s actors and actresses. By playing this game, youâ€™ll probably get a glimpse into what watching the movie will be like.
