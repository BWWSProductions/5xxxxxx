Voodoo Chile and Voodoo Child (Slight Return) are two different songs, both appear on the Electric Ladyland album.

The use of the word 'chile' is a deliberate misspelling of the word ""child"", to mimic that Hendrix didn't pronounce the end of the word, which he also used on the song ""Highway Chile"".

Your torrents are awesome !
Take care,
Gonzalo
