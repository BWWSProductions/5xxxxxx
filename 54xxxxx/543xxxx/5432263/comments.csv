One classic example of their bizarre, foolish and quaintly childish reasoning:
""Because there was no nature and there were no natural forces ontologically prior to the Big Bang?nature itself was created at the Big Bang.""
CLASSIC! 
I'm SURE the writer knows this because s/he was there! Who needs an entire civilizations-worth of modern scientific theory: just make stuff up and state it as fact: that'll reassure those who believe in talking snakes that their religion is real and science is evil!
Tee bloomin' hee.
I love how creationists pretend to be scientists - and then claim their bizarre theories are 100% fact - not theory, but complete fact - despite the fact that any five year old could pull apart their silly reasoning in no time."

,derek31a,2010-03-13T11:53Z,"Cinesimon - you said it yourself - ""Who needs an entire civilizations-worth of modern scientific theory"". I'm afraid that's all you have - theory from todays great minds .... no fact!!
Darwin himself recanted his theories on evolution before he died - but evolutionists try to hush that part up. It is you who needs to open up the mind and look at the beauty of CREATION around you."
,cinesimon,2010-03-13T12:55Z,"OH. of course: it's a CONSPIRACY!
Actually, he didn't at all denounce evolution. I'm sure you've been told he did, and you want to believe it with all your heart, therefore to you it has become fact.

Science is ALL theory.
Time is theory, so is gravity.
There is more scientific evidence for evolution than those two combined. 
THAT is a fact - not theory.

Yet with nothing but spin and fake science, you're willing to call creationism 'fact'. Without a shred of actual science behind it. 
Do you the deluded also include your book of life lessons a scientific journal of fact also these days?"
,LurkerrX,2010-03-13T14:47Z,"Darwin did -not- re-cant anything about Evolution before he died.  And even if he DID, it wouldn't matter.  The science is based on data, not based on the authority of the person who wrote the book.

The flawed logic of this film can be seen in black and white in the description:
""?spaceless because it created space
?timeless because it created time
?immaterial because it created matter"" . . .etc..
Creationists look at the world from a superstitious point of view.  In their minds the universe was ""created"" by some magical being.  They don't even try to wrap their minds around the idea that the universe wasn't ""created"" at all.  Because we experience linear time, they assume that time must have ""began"" at some point.  Once you start to learn about the singularity that existed before the big bang, and quantum physics, you will start to understand that time WAS created. . .by humans.

tldr; the whole argument is based on ""Everything that begins to exist has a cause.The universe began to exist. Therefore the universe has a cause."", which is not nessicarily a true statement."

,Tamarind777,2010-03-15T02:02Z,"Lol... Way before you or your evolution religion and its prophets knew the earth was round, the Bible said it. It says in Is. 40:22 that God sits above the CIRCLE of the earth. If you believe that says the earth if flat, YOU are brainless. Oh, wait. The reason you can't understand or have any common sense or logic is that your brain isn't finished evolving yet. You do believe that your brain is still evolving, don?t you?
Evolution is NOT science but a fairytale and a religion for fools. ""The fool has said in his heart that there is not God."" Ps. 14:1. Try reading a textbook and see how it begins: ?Millions and millions of years ago?? In other words, ?Once upon a time?? Sounds like a fairy tale to me. In fact, you think that the Frog and the Prince is a documentary! You think the kiss of time will turn a frog into a prince. That?s science???
Prove that there is a God? Its religion, you buffoon, NOT science. It has evidence, NOT proof, and the evidence ultimately rests on faith, just like your evolution religion. How do you see a bunch of bones in the ground and conclude that they had kids? That's not faith? In order for those bones to be ancestors to anybody or anything they MUST have kids to pass on their genes. You buffoons are so daft and dull you miss this logical and common sense step entirely. Also, how does natural selection create anything new? Have you EVER seen this in nature? NEVER! Natural selection only selects something to survive. It makes a species stronger or selects it out to be eliminated. It's simply a quality control mechanism. Now that's science and fact! Your babble is simply a religion.
I have no problem if you believe you came from rocks, but don't call that science. Science by definition means to KNOW through the senses (observation, etc.). Just when have you observed macro evolution? Bacterial antibiotic resistance? Fools! That's not evolution, they're STILL bacteria and will always be just that. Each time I get a cold or flu I get resistance too, I am not evolving into a new species? Lol...do you see how your religion lack sense and logic as a science? I would have so much more respect for evolutionists if they'd only admit that it's their religion. It's completely based on faith and faith alone.

The only sense evolution makes is NONsense! "

The modern Theory of Evolution has been observed and proved many times since the times of Charles Darwin. Meaning it has left the 'hypothesis' realm to become an established theory, that is to say: a fact. Just to cite a few examples of evolution in action: bacteria antibiotic resistance, the peppered moth and the avian influenza. Every other observation, from the fossil record to molecular genetics to wildlife observations, have all fit soundly with evolution predictions.

What's more, evolution is used by humankind for such things like artificial selection, genetic engineering, vaccine production and computer science (evolutionary and genetic algorithms). If evolution wasn't a fact, these applications of it would have failed. 

Once again evolution is a FACT"
,Godskalken,2010-04-20T07:22Z,"Now, the title (""scientifc fact""?) of this film shows that it is pure dogma, but to address the more serious claims:
If we accepting the hypothesis that ""everything must have a cause"", then I agree that the ""creator"" must be
?spaceless because it created space
?timeless because it created time
?immaterial because it created matter
But what about
?powerful because it created out of nothing?
That would depend on your definition of power, but I would say that for any reasonable definition, something that is spaceless, timeless and immaterial is also powerless. 
And as for
?intelligent because the creation event and the universe was precisely designed,
what does ""precisely designed"" mean? Sounds to me like, if glaciers created the fjords, then glaciers must be intelligent. Similarly for
?personal because it made a choice to convert a state of nothing into something (impersonal forces dont make choices),
here you just claimed that the ""creator"" made a choice, without any clear definition of what a choice is. I could equally well claim that a meteor chose to kill the dinosaurs, therefore the meteor must be personal."
,Tamarind777,2010-09-11T04:31Z,"cinesimon,
You're actually a buffoon for calling Christians ""Flat Earthers."" Little do you know (and it's pretty clear how little you know) that the Bible said that the Earth was round thousands of years ago. Read Isaiah 40:22 and see. It says, ""God sits on the circle of the earth."" Now, here is a text for you: ""The fool has said in his heart that there is no God"" (Psalms 14:1)."
