Thats what it says when i try to unrar it..

Do i need a password for this?"
,tdmk1,2010-03-21T21:17Z,"Very confusing, this is not a .rar file! I can only guess you've associated .m4v with WinRAR (which it shouldn't be), try right mouse clicking the file & openening it with your favourite media player - I'd suggest VLC which you can download for free from here;
