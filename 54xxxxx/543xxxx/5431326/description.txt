 On the day of James Kirk's birth, his father dies on his ship in a last      
 stand against a mysterious alien vessel. He was looking for Ambassador       
 Spock, who is a child on Vulcan at that time, disdained by his neighbors     
 for his half-human nature. Twenty years later, Kirk has grown into a young   
 troublemaker inspired by Capt. Christopher Pike to fulfill his potential in  
 Starfleet even as he annoys his instructors like young Lt. Spock. Suddenly,  
 there is an emergency at Vulcan and the newly commissioned USS Enterprise    
 is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov  
 and even Kirk himself thanks to Leonard McCoy's medical trickery. Together,  
 this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier where the old legend  
 is altered forever even as the new version of it is just beginning.
