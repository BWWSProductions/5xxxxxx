Promo Only is a music and music video subscription service for professional disc jockeys. It was the first monthly music service available to music professionals on CD. Promo Only began in 1992 when DJ Jim Robinson met up with another DJ Pete Werner on the pursuit of Janet Jacksonâ€™s â€œMiss You Much (The Mama Mix)â€ re-mix. Werner was able to help out Robinson due to his connection with record labels. Robinson offered to digitally clean up 12-inch vinyl releases Werner received each month onto one DAT. After joking that they could even press the DAT into a CD, they realized that there was a need for putting these mixes onto CD for the emerging CD DJ, and the company was born. The Original Promo Only subscription (renamed one year later â€˜Promo Only Clubâ€™) officially began in June 1992, offering the latest 12â€ Dance mixes and hard to find releases.
