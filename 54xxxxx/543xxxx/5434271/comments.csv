,barrly,2010-03-17T11:37Z,"I don't understand whats going on here. Here it says there are 24 seeders and 28 peers, but I've been downloading since it was posted and I've never seen even one seeder. I am now at 9.7 percent as is one other peer. No one else is online. How can there be so many seeders and peers who are invisible?"
,cerealr,2010-03-17T12:37Z,"barrly, you probably downloaded another torrent which had a problem, it was deleted and this one was uploaded a few minutes later, the other torrent didn't remain online more than a few minutes. Just download this torrent here and resume your download. Don't delete what you have already downlaoded. Just ot let you know this torrent here have been downloaded about 100 times by now. I alone seeded 500GBs till now.

Best,
CR"
