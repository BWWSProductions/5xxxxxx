An inept Czech peasant is torn between greed and guilt when the Nazi-backed bosses of his town appoint him â€œAryan controllerâ€ of an old Jewish widowâ€™s button shop. Humor and tragedy fuse in this scathing exploration of one cowardly manâ€™s complicity in the horrors of a totalitarian regime. Made near the height of Soviet oppression in Czechoslovakia, The Shop on Main Street features intense editing and camera work which won it the Academy Awardâ„¢ for Best Foreign Film in 1965.
