       EViews 7.The Enterprise Edition contains all of the         
       features of EViews 7, plus support for ODBC and the         
       proprietary data formats of several commercial data         
                     and database vendors.

        access to ODBC1 databases or queries and provides          
      transparent connection to Global Insight's DRIPro and

         easy-to-use EViews database interface has been            
       extended to these data formats so that you may work
