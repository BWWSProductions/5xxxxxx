,sayfu,2010-09-14T15:00Z,Thanks works fine
,lanhec,2010-11-29T21:01Z,"Thanks for the upload!

I got it to work! The only thing i used from this torrent was the install. i got the patch elsewhere (see below).

To get the patch, go to the link provided by ""sotelo"" in his comment. Once at the site, scroll down to post #51(look for the number at the top right corner of the post's box).  To see the link you'll have to join that site (its free and only takes a minute). I would post the direct link here but its only fair that these people get their acknowledgment too.

D/l this torrent as usual then:

1. Go into ""setup"" file
2. Go into ""INSTALL"" file
3. Run ""Setup""
4. Enter ""demo"" when asked for a serial
5. Uncheck ""Help"" and ""Documentation"" files when you reach the screen that asks you what you want to install.
6. After installation finishes do NOT run the program,instead run the ""EV7 Crack XP"" you got from that site i referred you to. When it comes up click ""Patch"".
7. Wait for it to finish doing what it has to then click ""exit"".
8. That's it, run Eviews 7!

Program has never crashed on me, ran some regressions, unit root tests, and correlograms. Works like a charm....hey that kinda rhymes :p"
,lanhec,2010-11-29T21:04Z,"also i forgot to mention, there is a patch for Vista and one for XP (the link calls them crack, but its really a patch.) I have XP so that's the one i used. Thus, i cant speak on the functionality of the vista patch. hope it works though!"
,siftekhar,2010-12-16T21:23Z,"Downloaded and works perfectly.  Follow lanhec's suggested procedure (2010-11-29) and it works like a charm. 

Tested on Vista and Win7 for hours and several thousands of extensive processes.   "

,akhilv,2011-01-26T03:52Z,"can someone post the download link for the crack? the thread on board4all closed and you can no longer access it even with registration, thanks"
,lanhec,2011-02-16T23:48Z,"I just checked the link it works fine, although the post's number has actually changed to #49. I can access it just fine, don't know why you guys can't. sorry, can't help you there."

But when I run the patch, it keeps on saying that the file is in use. I wasn't running the eviews files at all. Did anyone get the same problem? Please help me here."
,Jysta,2011-03-17T02:34Z,"my antivirus software flagged and deleted the patch as soon as i downloaded it...

,lans2405,2011-03-26T21:45Z,"@Jysta : Yeah me too! I wasn't confident about the crack so I fallowed de Red Team instruction which indicate to copie the eviews7.exe icon on the eview's ""programme file"" file...it's work just fine that way!"

I DO need a key generator... that would be NICE!"
,Uruburu,2011-06-19T15:31Z,"There is an important shortcomming in this cracked version of EViews, and that is that EViews-programs give 'random' error messages and then shutdown EViews. Of course i tested if it was my bad programming in that (shit) language or a problem with my version, by simply running it on a completely 'legal' 7.1 version. And there is just one conclusion this crack is not functioning properly. 
@ Siftekhar: ""Tested on Vista and Win7 for hours and several thousands of extensive processes. "" I seriously doubt that, what do you mean by 'extensive processes'? Surely not EViews programming code.

http://www.board4allcz.eu/showthread.php?t=245744&highlight=eviews&page=2 

all problems are solved! My Norton also gave a warning, but i switched it off and run the crack anyway: EViews including the prog. part works without errors! 

Thanks"
,woody189,2011-07-29T00:05Z,"Can someone help me?  In the instructions it says to unpack and install from INSTALL folder, but I can't find it .  WHen i DL the torrent, its a bunch of zip files and none of them are named INSTALL and inside each zip file there is a a folder SETUP, but nothing seems to work.  How do I initiate the install? After that, i understand I must go to the link provided and get the patch, but I can't even begin to install it...

Thanks"
,timonis,2011-09-15T16:08Z,"Problems i encountered: 1) after downloading i couldnt figure out how to run setup.exe 
2) after i figured that out when i run the patch (given from @lochang) it would say missing file or file in use message.

Solution to problem 1: extract all rar files to another folder, then in the new folder that you just extracted the rar files to there will be a new rar file open that and SETUP should be in there.

Solution to problem 2: i am running WIN 7 so run the eviews7_crack. exe in compatability to WIN XP and run as administrator. 

Note: make sure to turn off ANTI-VIRUS "

,GoranSvetkovic,2012-04-21T23:15Z,Very difficult access the Ceh website to get the patch. Administrator has to examine my application to see the post.
