,McNewmann,2010-03-17T21:46Z,what does seeding and leechere do ? plz tell me :D
,4rror,2010-03-18T09:29Z,"Seeders are people who are currently sharing the complete file/torrent. Leechers are people who are in the process of downloading it.
Please note, however, that the amount of seeders and leechers indicated here on TPB has been off for a while now. In my client (uTorrent) I'm seeing 18 seeders now, and 14 active seeds/leechers.
For more info, have a look here:

,4rror,2010-03-19T11:34Z,"^^ That should read ""14 active peers/leechers""."
,robotx13,2010-03-22T22:37Z,"everytime this game crashes, when im playing skirmish or the campaign."
,4rror,2010-03-24T00:43Z,"Works flawlessly here. Can you give a bit more information? Which version of Windows are you running, are your graphics drivers up to date? Did you install the update before installing the crack?"
,CrashMorra,2010-04-26T07:55Z,is this C&C 3 tiberium wars only or with kane edition?
,4rror,2010-04-26T10:38Z,Tiberium Wars only. Sorry.
,CrashMorra,2010-04-26T18:08Z,damnit :( btw you know what's the difference?
,CrashMorra,2010-04-27T17:43Z,"downloaded the game, can't find the game or the file or the folder whata hell man? is something corrupt? again what's the difference between C&C 3 TW regular and kane edition?"
,4rror,2010-04-28T11:30Z,"I have not played the Kane edition (yet), so I really couldn't tell you...
Do you mean you can't find your download, or where the game is installed?"
,yinyang107,2010-06-13T09:05Z,Works like a charm. Thanks ever so.
,chacolah,2010-06-17T23:58Z,"I own kanes ediition, it comes with a bonus disc, a couple new skins for units, and i think a few missions"
,4rror,2010-07-21T15:38Z,"@chakolah:
And I'll get around to sharing that one too, eventually. :-)"
,4rror,2010-07-21T15:39Z,"I meant to write ""chacolah"", of course."
,BlackOpGhost,2010-12-13T04:34Z,"Dear 4error.

              Every time i start my game up it starts up normally. But when i try to play a skirmish or campaign mission it suddenly crashes saying ""The program has stop working"" i don't understand why. i am running a Windows Vista 32.bit Dell Vostro 200. with a normal Video card. no fancy video card. the one that came with my Computer. I patched then cracked successfully but i don't really know why its crashing. Any advice or fixes?"
,4rror,2011-02-24T14:20Z,"@BlackOpGhost:
Have you tried running the game in compatibility mode?"

,The_Jiten,2011-06-30T20:09Z,"Hey, I installed it and ran the patch and applied the crack. The game works, but I have no cursors. The mouse works, I can click and stuff but it's an invisible cursor. Not sure what else to do, I checked and there is a cursors folder in the main directory as well as other locations but I'm not sure why I can't see any cursor then."
,khanzz,2011-09-21T01:50Z,"when I load the disc in daemon tools, the beginning screen shows up and it says ""Please remove disc from current CD/DVD drive and insert the original ""Command and Conquer 3"" disc"". can anyone help me?"
