                    Carl and Chesney's attempt to outrun their  
                    troubles lead them to discover the grass isn't  
                    always greener. Stranded on a Welsh farm they  
                    are offered sanctuary by a mysterious woman,  
                    Hazel. But things soon turn sour when news  
                    reaches them that they are now the prime  
                    suspects for Bonehead's murder. Back home, Liam  
                    and Maxine seem to be the only ones concerned  
                    by their disappearance which forces Ian to  
                    confront Jimmy, the real murderer, in order to  
                    establish the truth. Elsewhere, Micky and Liam  
                    have been picked by the local council to make a  
                    community film in the hope it will inspire the  
                    residents of Chatsworth now that their estate  
                    has been identified as the most run down in  
                    Britain. With Kelly and Shane's help Micky  
                    decides to stretch poetic licence in pursuit of  
                    glory, whilst Liam uses the competition as a  
                    cover to film evidence that could save Carl and  
                    Chesney from prison.
