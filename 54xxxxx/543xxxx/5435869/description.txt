             NOTE: Several commercial solvers are also included:

             AMPL is a comprehensive and powerful algebraic                   
             modeling language for linear and nonlinear                       
             optimization problems, in discrete or continuous                 
             variables.                                                       
                                                                              
             Developed at Bell Laboratories, AMPL lets you use                
             common notation and familiar concepts to formulate               
             optimization models and examine solutions, while the             
             computer manages communication with an appropriate               
             solver.                                                          
                                                                              
             AMPL's flexibility and convenience render it ideal               
             for rapid prototyping and model development, while               
             its speed and control options make it an especially              
             efficient choice for repeated production runs.                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
             Key modeling language features                                   
                                                                              
             * Broad support for sets and set operators. AMPL                 
               models can use sets of pairs, triples, and longer              
               tuples; collections of sets indexed over sets;                 
               unordered, ordered, and circular sets of objects;              
               and sets of numbers.                                           
                                                                              
             * General and natural syntax for arithmetic,                     
               logical, and conditional expressions; familiar                 
               conventions for summations and other iterated                  
               operators.                                                     
                                                                              
             * Nonlinear programming features such as initial                 
               primal and dual values, user-defined functions,                
               fast automatic differentiation, and automatic                  
               elimination of "defined" variables.                            
                                                                              
             * Convenient alternative notations including node                
               and arc declarations for network problems, a                   
               special syntax for piecewise-linear functions, and             
               columnwise specification of linear coefficients.               
                                                                              
                                                                              
             Key modeling environment features                                
                                                                              
             * Interactive command environment with batch                     
               processing options. Powerful display commands let              
               you view any model component or expression,                    
               browsing on-screen or writing to a file, using                 
               automatic formatting or your own preferences.                  
                                                                              
             * New looping and if-then-else commands. Simple                  
               programs in the AMPL command language can now be               
               written to solve sequences of related problems,                
               for sensitivity analysis and for decomposition or              
               other iterative schemes.                                       
                                                                              
             * Separation of model and data. AMPL models remain               
               concise even as sets and data tables grow. Models              
               may incorporate many kinds of conditions for
