,morgan1212,2010-03-20T16:16Z,seed seed seed pleas
,drewkrew,2011-08-21T16:12Z,"CiosCorp v3.5 is very much out-of-date now, but it was a great release. 
It has evolved thru developement to what is now known as DarkCorp v1.1 which enables DVD-R backups to play via Disc Channel (no loaders needed etc) however, newer Wii's that ship with v4.3 firmware have the newer DVD drive modules that will not read DVD-R discs at all, so you won't get these wii's (including most black wii's to play disc backups at all)
USB HDD loading is the option to take... works on ALL wii's ;-)"

I just changed alternate dol in neogamma options on- disc than i watched motion plus video and changed back alternate dol to -no and this game and any motion plus game works fine. Thanks for the best FPP game on Wii...
