So, here's the second FMV collection I've compiled. This includes all 50 FMV scenes that can be viewed from the Luca Theater. Instead of giving each FMV it's own chapter, which would have taken forever, I inserted chapters by location. So all FMV's to do with the opening Zanarkand scene are one chapter. All the scenes while Tidus is in Besaid are one chapter and so on. Some scenes, however, merited their own chapter (The Dance - Kilika; The Spring - Macalania Woods).

No Menu. No Watermark.

My next endeavor isn't for an RPG, but I'm sure action game fans will be pleased.
