    Simon Reeve starts his epic journey around the world       
    following the Tropic of Cancer, the northern border of    
    the tropics region.                                      
                                                              
    In this first episode Simon travels from the beautiful     
    Pacific coast of Mexico, where he visits the luxurious    
    holiday resorts of Baja California, before crossing the  
    country's rugged interior.                                
                                                               
    Along the way he goes on patrol with a heavily armed      
    police unit in Culiacan, headquarters of the fearsome    
    Sinaloa drug cartel, and gets more than he bargained      
    for from a female Lucha Libre wrestler.                    
                                                              
    The Tropic of Cancer skirts Havana, where Simon learns   
    how allotments are helping the Cubans counter the         
    effects of the US trade embargo; and in the Bahamas he     
    discovers the hidden menace on the beautiful coral        
    reefs that make these islands famous.
