In 2007, 2008, and 2009 he was voted number one DJ in DJ Magâ€™s annual Top 100 vote. Van Buuren currently hosts a weekly radio show called â€œA State of Tranceâ€ and claims to have over 30 million weekly listeners in more than 40 countries, which would make it the most listened to radio show in the world. Armin van Buuren was born in Leiden, the Netherlands on December 25, 1976. He finished high school in 1995, and left for college to study law. While studying law, Van Buurenâ€™s interest for making music blossomed, and he began working as a DJ in a local club called Nexus. As his musical career began to take off, he temporarily put his law degree on hold, however, he did complete his law degree in 2004 via Oxford University.. On September 18, 2009 Armin married Erika van Thiel in Wassenaar, Netherlands.

On October 28, 2009, DJ Magazine announced the results of their annual Top 100 DJ Poll, placing Ultra Records artist Corsten at #7. Ferry Corsten produced and remixed under many aliases since the release of his first record at the age of sixteen, but he officially started to work as a musician when he was 27 years old.
