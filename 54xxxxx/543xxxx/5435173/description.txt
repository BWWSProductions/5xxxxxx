This week Dana Dearmond is on our show. She's been dating a lot of duds lately, so we stepped in and helped her out. So we set Dana up with Elias, he's a Construction Guy who came from Tucson to La to maybe start his business over there. We weren't surprised when Dana went Ga Ga over the guy. Turned out he was just her type. So he probably didn't have to do much to get her in the sack...Dana is socially weird and a space cadet. So can these two hook up or will ADD mess it all up... CAN HE SCORE?!
