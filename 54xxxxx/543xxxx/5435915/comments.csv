,smihajlo,2010-03-17T17:00Z,"crack dao:origins has
 a  variant of Win32/Kryptic.BXZ trojan.

Could you not at least make a crack with a virus that cannot be found?

Scanned with Eser Nod Antivirus 4"
,smihajlo,2010-03-17T17:02Z,Scanned with Eset Nod Antivirus 4 sorry for the mistake
,andrew.i1987,2010-03-17T17:13Z,most anti virus scanners will detect cracks and keygens as a virus by the way that the crack/keygen operates (virus like). I assure you this torrent does not have any viruses or trojans within it!!
,smihajlo,2010-03-17T17:30Z,"Well i don't have the sufficient knowledge to tell,but lots of torrents have then and i only say what i see from my eset nod antivirus 4.I found another crack torrent 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5437249/Dragon_Age_Origins_Awakening_Razor1911

the crack doesn't have a virus ,but the keygen has .
but i still don't know if it works when i download the game i'll tell,but anyway thanks for the download even if it has a virus it's still free."

,Jorick123,2010-03-19T20:47Z,"Please someone help me. 

I have mounted the image, using DAEMON Tools Pro. Now when I try to start the drive it says 
the file or folder is damaged and unable to read.

Is it because of the file, or do I do something wrong?

Thanks in front!"
,pick739,2010-03-20T00:15Z,"@Syteri  This does NOT have ""the awakening"" Guide included.  Only the original strategy guide for the main game."
,muminwarrior,2010-03-20T09:13Z,"Could u please configure your tracker so that ppl with realy low bandwidth dont't hog your UL lines, or at least put a limit in so that more ppl can complet the DL and start seeding. Still only 2 seeders with 2000+ leechers after 4 days.
Otherwize thanks for a nicely formated torrent."
,thegreenbadger,2010-03-20T13:00Z,"Thanks for this torrent, though the only reason I'm downloading this for the PC is due to the extortionate price of Awakening on the PS3 in the UK. Had it been priced more reasonable I would not have had to resort to downloading it from here.

Just thought the developers may want to know if they are monitoring torrent sites"

,andrew.i1987,2010-03-23T21:29Z,"did you copy the crack?? the crack is so you dont need a cd, and if you did.... did u copy the correct one, in this torrent i included the cracks for patch 1.02a, patch 1.03, and the awakening expansion. so if you installed origins and awakening you will only have to copy the awakening crack to your game's root directory! hope this helps.."
,FragHero,2010-03-26T06:32Z,Great Torrent.  Will seed all my down time for weeks.
,Tripgnosis,2010-03-28T03:31Z,"I'm having a problem trying to install the awakening expansion....after entering the serial, it starts to install but then it stops and says that the installation failed. Gives me no reason or or anything... any help??"
,Tripgnosis,2010-03-28T04:07Z,"nm, I reinstalled the main game and then installed awakening (skipping the patches) and it's workin fine now. "
,Tripgnosis,2010-03-28T06:07Z,"ok, I guess I spoke too soon - it just took longer before I got the sintallation failed message. In order to get it to work I had to install it with the compatibility mode set to win2k. 

surprised no one else had this issue...."
,dangirdas,2010-03-29T19:20Z,wtf why dont the dlc works on awekning?

,Nakus,2010-04-07T00:33Z,"Downloaded started slow, but jumped to 1MB the next day. 

Installation was easy, just follow the ''readme'' file. 
After you have installed awakening you need to put patch 1.03 in the Bin folder. 

Have not played it yet, but so far it works perfectly. 

Job welldone Andrew.i1987"

,Kanng,2010-08-21T23:38Z,In order for the game to keep working after applying the 1.04 patch so you can install you must reapply the 1.03apatch I personally thought you people would be smart enough to figure this out on your own but obviously not.

I started playing and everything going well minus a few glitches, but hey I can't complain to much can I as I didn't spend any money hmm? However, when I get to the point where my Main Character reaches the Warden Outpost where he/she first meets Morrigan after the diologue with her you leave to go to Morrigan's mother, however, on the load screen it gets stuck there and keeps loading and loading. The sound eventually dies away and I'm left standing looking at the load screen for 30+ minutes. Any way to fix this or get around it to the next part of the game? I would not recommend playing this torrent otherwise IMHO."
,Yodaman81,2010-08-24T07:34Z,Please ignore my last comment. I managed to fix my own issue. If anyone else has the same problem I did what I did to fix it was completely uninstall all files(I did click keep save game files though) and then I ran CCleaner on the registry and restarted my computer. Then reinstalled everything per the instructions included in this torrent and then tried again. This time around everything worked like a charm. This torrent has this blessing once more. Two thumbs up.
,Mortiferon,2010-08-24T15:26Z,"Both installed perfectly, keys work, cracks work, both games launch fine and it is exactly what it says it is - no gimmicks or addware and you DON'T need to keep the ISO mounted to play.

However, after launching ""Character Creator"" it claims that it is a Demo only... the other, main games do not state this anywhere though.

I also can't seem to figure out how to modify the addins.xml file, but I'll probably figure it out eventually.

Overall, a great torrent. Kuddos.

P.S. Any info on the ""Demo"" notice of the ""Character Creator"" would be appreciated. And if somebody could also provide dummy instructions for editing the addins.xml file that would also be highly appreciated!"

However, I had to unmount Awakening with Origins and then remount Awakening by itself for the autorun to launch and get it installing, so you might have to do the same as well.

Itâ€™s either that or you just got a bad file and you need to try torrenting a new Awakening ISO. Beyond that, I have no clue what could be going wrongâ€¦ sorry and I hope you get it fixed!

As for me I managed to get .xml edited and all of the DLC is working. However, Iâ€™m wondering now if it is safe for me to remove the Tages drivers that these games have placed on my computer and which are disabled due to incompatibility anyway.

First of all this error most probably has nothing to do with your system. It manifests because some of the original DA : Origins components are built using an older version of Microsoft C++ library and the new DA : Origins patch uses components built using a newer version. Solution is simple â€“ download the new C++ runtime, install it and run the game.

You need to download the latest version of C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable or it will not work. "

tried running the installer from dameon and tried copying files inside iso to computer then installing but neither worked
is the only way to fix this to re download this game? slow internet so would be a kick in the dick :( 

ty for upload either way, is baller game. cant wait to try out all the DLC packs"
,Dufox,2011-02-25T11:06Z,"FINALLY fixed it :D

1st: mount iso, open folder to view files, highlight all files/folders (control + A) then drag them to a new folder on ur desktop

2nd: find what rar file is corrupt, for me was in data folder. go in data folder then make a new folder on desktop and extract each rar inside the data folder to the new folder 1 rar at a time.

3rd: when the operation fails leave the little box open that shows the file that is corrupt, then follow the path inside the rar to the exact file (make sure you find the right one, can get confusing)

4th: right click on the file and press delete files.

repeat until you have extracted all rar files in data folder without the operation breaking. 

game ran perfect. only worth doing with the awakening iso, cause you can easily download the origional game from another torrent.

hope that helps, will prolly find a few bugs considering i deleted 4 files but we will see :D"

Use Daemon tools to install both Iso's.

Install the game from the game iso first. Use the provided serials.

DO NOT PATCH anything! Do not run the patches!

Run the installer on the Awakening iso next. Use the provided serials. 
This will also patch the DA game. If you patched already, uninstall and start over.

Copy the patch 1.03 crack file into the appropriate directory.

Run the game.  You cannot install the DLC's until after the game has been run once....files are created by the running that do not exist otherwise, and the DLC installer will fail.

Run the DLC updater, and install any DLC's.

When you run the game the second time, you'll have to ""Turn on"" the DLC's you want from the DLC tab menu.

6. back to the folder where you extracted everything, find the crack, the 1.03 one, and drag it into c:/program(x86)/dragon age/data
7.move and replace
8.mount the image if you haven't done so already somehow(poweriso is free, fellow windows7 runners, otherwise daemontools works well)

The simple way of authorizing your DLC's is to locate the Bioware folder in your My documents. Go into Settings, edit the AddIns.XML file with notepad.

Do NOT change anything but the number. This file is located in ( My documents/bioware/dragon age/settings/ ), regardless on which partition you have installed your game.

Just as well, my suggestion is that once you're done installing all the patches, now you change the Addins.xml file, cuse other wise it will reset and you will have to do it all over again, and once you're done with the installation fully, run the game, see if you have everything running correctly, now you can install the addons.
