Mind telling the quality?"
,rachelmed,2011-07-02T19:28Z,"Just to let you know, you are missing a whole 30min episode between what you have labeled as episodes 3 and 4. Your first file labeled ""episodes 1 and 2"" is really just ep 1 but an hour long so you are missing the real episode 3 from the torrent.

Good quality but it makes the story confusing and hard to follow without that episode."
