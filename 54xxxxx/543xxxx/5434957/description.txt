I'm rather surprised that I can't find any albums by Imperial Teen on any torrent sites I've checked. I thought they were more popular!

Anyway, this album contains their greatest song ("Yoo Hoo") but is otherwise not nearly as good as their next album. Unfortunately, I no longer have that album. So... here's this one. Definitely still worth getting!
