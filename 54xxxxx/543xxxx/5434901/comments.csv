,daleangus,2010-03-14T10:18Z,yeah.  spoiled it for us.  no surprises here though as it was in the news and pacquiao was favored 8-1 to win!
,goldpig,2010-03-14T10:33Z,LOL. What a doosh. If its fake then good for you for fooling us and making us read results. Are there any other fights on program? 
,KarpoofdaJulii,2010-03-14T11:07Z,you fucking piece of shit. why the fuck would you put the results in the description? fucking asshole. fuck you.
,mcjhon23,2010-03-14T12:12Z,Look at the foot of clottey he's fucking stepping on pacmans foot he is dirty
,garrb87,2010-03-14T13:06Z,Clottey WINSSSSSSS ASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
,gumamela,2010-03-14T13:32Z,so is this real or not?
,djforti,2010-03-14T14:36Z,Clottey always fights like that.  He is tailor made for pacquiao and never had a chance
,codeakira,2010-03-14T15:14Z,"its not fake. use vlc and load playlist, then add directory. Pretty boring. clottey probably figured out that he couldn't win. probably i'll do the same if i were clotty and take the money. that's it."
