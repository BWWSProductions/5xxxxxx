,RID2,2010-03-17T07:34Z,"Thanks! 

If someone could try and crack FSdreamteam's KLAS Las Vegas for FS9 that be great! "
,mOuse_X,2010-03-17T14:35Z,It's v2 and not v3
,chuckmamuck,2010-03-17T17:17Z,"@mOuse_X
i think ya right mate, ive just had a look on the link that hitchup added and it looks like v2 to me too, i'd not heard of excellent edition either, i just downloaded it on tuesday night from INeedFile.com, i got it on a direct download so i added trackers and upped the files on here as it was cus i couldnt find v2 on tpb and a few people were requesting it. 
cheers for confirming it mate, i'll change the title to v2. i should of looked into it before i uploaded it really and re-titled it, i'll know for next time tho."
,chuckmamuck,2010-03-17T17:25Z,"does anubody know a way to make the virtual cockpit lighter?
its ok during daytime flights but ive just flown it at dusk and its quite dark until you fly with the sun at ya back then its perfect. ive tried messing about a bit but its made no difference, is there a way to permanantly illuminate the VC to how it is when the suns a ya back?
cheers."
,badderer,2010-03-17T18:30Z,"thanks for your effert chuckmamuck, but in fsx only a few of the plane are usable and no missions are loaded."
,chuckmamuck,2010-03-17T18:56Z,"@badderer.
thats strange mate that you cant fly all the variations. can you drive the tractors?
i use FSX, sp1 and Acceleration and ive got all 49 aircraft and tractor options available to fly and drive in my in game aircraft file for free flight or select aircraft option whilst flying. some aint got pictures but all 49 are available, ive tried most of them from all nations and formation flights and had no problems.
have you taken the 2 files: EF_afs_ee_9V and EF_afs_ee_S from aircraft/AFSEurofighterTyphoon in the main FSX directory and put them into simobjects/airplanes?
it was only when i did that i could use all 49 options.
the 3 missions(well i wouldnt call them missions) are in the ""flights"" file in ya main fsx directory, just click on them and they open fsx automatically and load the mission, all 3 are formation flights, 1 in germany and 2 in saudi arabia i think, they work but they're nothing special.
hope that helps. :)"
,Rlymdlr,2010-03-19T21:40Z,"Gorgeous model, the driveable tractor is cool, but the FDE of the model is totally FUBAR. Ground handling is almost impossible, and it is WAY too powerful. 

Thanks all the same for letting me try it out!"
,chuckmamuck,2010-03-20T00:03Z,"@Rlymdlr
no worries mate.
i know what u mean about ground handling, its sharp, the slightest touch on the rudder and its all over the runway. i liked the ground acceleration, eurofighter can build take off speed rapidly in a short runway distance so i thought that was quite good, and supercruise aint too bad, ive hit 780knots at max power without afterburners but as soon as you apply reheat it goes crazy. 
it looks good inside and out and is a good improvement on V1 but theres still alot of room for improvement. roll on V3 ;)"
