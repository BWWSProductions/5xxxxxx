>> TJ090901 -- The BMP is NOT the registration code.  That is located within the ISO file, and is named, QuickTime Pro  7.0.2.120 Serial.txt.

To all, if you already have the latest Quicktime installed, you do not need to install this version, simply use the code in the aforementioned text file, which also has the instructions on how to activate.  

Furthermore, if you do not have quicktime installed, but would like to have the latest version, you can download it from www.quicktime.com and again follow the instructions.  

I am unsure if this will work once quicktime is upgraded to 8 however, it does work for Version 7 (Current version is 7.6.6, as of this posting), and all updates within this version.  

It will possibly still work with 8, depending upon whether or not any more royalty-bearing technologies are included in it.  Time will tell!!"
,tj090901,2010-09-12T01:13Z,"The registration code in the ISO worked. But two observations:

1. Why upload a trial key in the torrent instead of just putting the real key there?
2. Why was it made an ISO? Could have just been a ZIP or RAR or just a bunch of files."
,Valtrex666,2010-09-25T06:18Z,"Thanks For The Comments Guys & Girls!
I know I could have done this a little smoother way, but ""hey!"", it works!
Please Enjoy and RATE!! I hope to be a trusted member in the future."
