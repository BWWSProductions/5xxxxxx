Release notes:

After the release of their next album, STING IN THE TAIL, and a three-year
mammoth tour, which will take them across five continents, one of the most
successful rock bands in the world, SCORPIONS, will be ending their career.
During their 40-year career, SCORPIONS sold over 100 million albums and received
many awards, such as the World Music Award and several Echos--the German
equivalent to the Grammy. Today they still play sold-out venues around the
world. Not long ago, 152,000 South Americans came to 15 SCORPIONS concerts
between Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City. Their song "Wind of Change" has become
an anthem for the fall of the Iron Curtain. The tour will launch in the band's
home country Germany in May. After that, they will be touring through North
America before they continue their journey through five other continents until
2012.

Enjoy!
