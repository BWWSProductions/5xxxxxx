Very complete collection of Whedonverse comics...includes all Buffy(Darkhorse run,one shots,specials,season 8 through #33)  Angel(all After the fall/Aftermath through #30,only missing issues 4+ of Only Human run that I haven't seen anywhere out there) Spike,Fray,Firefly(not much...more on the way!) plus a few others

  Post Script...
    Not as complete as I thought...forgot to put the last few Angel books I have...the sets of Smiletime and Not Fade Away(from episodes of the show) and a 4 parter called "Blood and Trenches"(a WW one tale,in case it isn't obvious)...if anyone needs them let me know and I'll upload them...and if anyone has Angel-Only human #s 4+ let me know
