,Neondangel,2010-04-12T01:39Z,"you can already download the beta in steam for free.... the real versions coming out in about a month or so for $50, yet i am sure some people would be working on a hacked version till then of the full version"
,Archive555,2010-04-25T07:03Z,"Alright.
You need Steam to play this. Once everything is complete, you can crack steam to run offline.

It's only a beta, so there is no campaign.
If you're missing a DLL, google it and download it.

And Dofus Octopus, if a game is too challenging for you, doesn't mean it's shit. It means you're stupid ;)"
