,badshortdaddy,2010-05-11T16:00Z,"I'm guessing you're using windows media player. It doesn't have an option to change the language. You may be able to find a codex to dl to get it to work. It's probably easier to just dl a different media player. I'm using VLC media player and it's a free dl too. With it you go to audio tab then audio track and click on track 2. I'm sure there are plenty of others, some which may be better, but the point is use something other than windows media player."
