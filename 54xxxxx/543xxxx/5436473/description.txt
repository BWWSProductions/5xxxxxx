SYNOPSIS:
Luis BuÃ±uelâ€™s final film explodes with eroticism, bringing full circle the directorâ€™s lifelong preoccupation with the darker side of desire. BuÃ±uel regular Fernando Rey plays Mathieu, an urbane widower, tortured by his lust for the elusive Conchita. With subversive flare, BuÃ±uel uses two different actresses in the leadâ€”Carole Bouquet, a sophisticated French beauty, and Angela Molina, a Spanish coquette. Drawn from Pierre LouÃ¿sâ€™s 1898 novel, La Femme et le Pantin, That Obscure Object of Desire is a dizzying game of sexual politics punctuated by a terror that harkens back to BuÃ±uelâ€™s brilliant surrealistic beginnings.
