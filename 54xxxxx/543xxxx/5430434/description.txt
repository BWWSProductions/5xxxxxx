This one not too many people outside of Germany (or even in Germany itself) know. Quite sad, because its a really good Reggae/Dancehall/Hip-Hop Album with a lot of famous Feature-guests.

Joni Rewind is the alter ego of DJ Dynamite of the popular german Rap-Group "Dynamite Deluxe", who brought out his first (and until today) only Solo-Album  in 2002. My personal favourites on there are "Madness (Joni's Theme)" and a Remake of "Uptown Top Rankin'" with an at that time unknown Est'elle.
