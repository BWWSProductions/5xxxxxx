                                 : If you had to pick someone to write the 
                                   autopsy report on the Wall Street 
                                   financial collapse 18 months ago, you 
                                   couldn't do any better than Michael 
                                   Lewis. He is one of the country's 
                                   preeminent non-fiction writers with a 
                                   knack for turning complicated, mind 
                                   numbing material into fascinating yarns.

                                   He wrote his first bestseller, "Liar's 
                                   Poker," about his experiences as a young 
                                   Wall Street bond trader when he was 
                                   still in his 20s and has since followed 
                                   up with seven more bestsellers on 
                                   subjects ranging from Silicon Valley in 
                                   "The New New Thing" to big time sports 
                                   in "Money Ball" and "The Blind Side."
