[umunu] Wing Chun Pure & Simple - James Sinclair

This is the first in a series of instructional tapes produced by the United Kingdom Wing Chun Kung Fu Association and feature Master teacher, James Sinclair.

This series came into being after many requests by students and public alike for a realistic and professionally presented private training system. This training tape is useful to both beginners and instructors as a valuable reference resource. It also uniquely offers a great opportunity to those students unable to attend classes allowing them the opportunity to study the dynamic and effective Wing Chun Kung Fu system at home.

This tape covers:

  * The Centre Line Theory
  * Centre Line Punch
  * Side Punch
  * Multiple Punching including Short Distance Power
  * Weight shifting and the turning punch
  * Stance & Footwork
  * Distance Judgement
  * Wallbag and Hand Conditioning
  * Sui Nim Tao (Little Idea Form)

Although slow motion is used throughout, no part of the recording has been sped up.

We acknowledge that no tape can completely replace a good teacher, but it is hoped you will find this series educational, useful, inspirational and entertaining.

Martial Arts Illustrated stated in Feb 2000: 'James' video is the business and will certainly prove beneficial to the viewer regardless of the style or system that they practice'.
