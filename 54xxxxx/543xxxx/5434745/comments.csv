,berthild,2010-03-14T21:36Z,"ItÂ´s no fake. Real bloody beginning.
Just one problem. How do you get the sub to work. Have tried it in both VLC and MPC. "
,zato1,2010-03-14T22:17Z,"Oh sweet, been looking for this! Thank you for uploading zenka_ona."
,zenka_onna,2010-03-15T02:45Z,">How do you get the sub to work.

In VLC:""Video-Subtitles track-Open file..."" -select ""Vampire Girl VS Frankenstein Girl_en.srt"""
,zato1,2010-03-16T02:43Z,"Subs--make sure the .avi and .srt names match--in this case remove the ""_en"""
,Aces77,2010-03-16T14:49Z,"Work fine with VLC and MPC ... the sub also.
Movie is a japan gore with lot of blood.

,briareosdeunan,2010-12-05T02:41Z,"Here is my rate: (Out of 10)
Audio= 9
Video= 9
Movie= 5

Great quality but the movie itself sucks. 
Why don't they stop making this kind of crap? 
I love Japanese but  I know that you can all do better than this.
And by the way, you look pretty Monami.
You can have my blood!
Any problems with your video player or anything under the sun? 
Please e-mail me at emzdoe@yahoo.com.
Thanks for the upload. I really appreciate it."
