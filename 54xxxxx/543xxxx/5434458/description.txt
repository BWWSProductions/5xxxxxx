Local is a twelve-part Oni Press comic book limited series written by Brian Wood (Demo, DMZ, Northlanders) and illustrated by Ryan Kelly (Lucifer, American Virgin, The New York Four).  Each issue is intended to be a stand-alone short story, taking place in a different town across North America.  Each issue features Megan McKeenan, a young woman who sets out from Portland, Oregon with nothing but a rucksack and a bad case of wanderlust.   These emotional vignettes each represent a year in the life of this young vagabond as she searches for a place to call home, both physically and spiritually.  Megan is the main character in some issues, while in others she is a spectator or background figure.
