Disk Defrag - Intelligent Defragmenter

Auslogics Disk Defrag is a compact and fast defragmenter that supports both FAT 16/32, and NTFS file systems. It is supplied with advanced optimization techniques, which will remedy your system sluggishness and crashes caused by files fragmentation.


Optimizes file system

This tool will speed up your computer and make it run more smoothly by moving system files to the faster part of the disk and clearing the MFT Reserved Zone from regular data files.


Consolidates free space

Disk Defrag doesn't only defragment files - it prevents further files fragmentation by merging free space on the disk into a large contiguous block.


Can defrag automatically

You can set the program to run automatically when your system goes idle.
It will analyze the disks and defragment them in the background if required.
With this feature your files fragmentation will be eliminated as soon as it occurs.


Provides flexible scheduler

Defragmentation yields better results when implemented on a regular basis.
Using flexible scheduler you can set the most suitable time span for defragmenting your hard drives.


Can defrag a single file or folder

Have no time for defragmenting an entire hard drive?
With Disk Defrag you can defragment a single file, several files or a folder.


Supports multi-terabyte volumes

Disk Defrag is supplied with a powerful engine, which can easily defragment large disk volumes of several terabytes, as well as several drives simultaneously.


Compact & Fast

Smart defragmentation algorithms allow Disk Defrag to run much faster than similar defragmenters and consume less system resources.


Advanced Defragmentation Features by Auslogics

Defragment & Optimize

Disk Defrag allows not only to defragment, but to optimize your hard drives for maximum performance. It can consolidate free space, move system files to the faster part of the disk and clear the MFT Reserved Zone from regular data files. These optimization techniques will speed up your system and make it more stable. And with all the advanced optimization techniques it has, Disk Defrag is extremely compact and easy to use!


Free space consolidation

Simple defragmentation of data files leaves fragmented free space.
This means that there are many free space "holes" all over the disk.
Windows fills those "holes" with newly created or extended files.
The more fragmented the free space is, the more fragmented new files will be.
Disk Defrag merges free space into a large contiguous block during optimization process. This technology effectively prevents further files fragmentation and speeds up disk access.


System files smart placement

System files are necessary for the operating system to perform its numerous functions. Commonly used by Windows, system files may be scattered all over the disk and intermixed with regular data files. Disk Defrag defragments them and moves them to the faster part of the disk. Such intelligent way of defragmentation minimizes the time needed for HDD to access system files and thus improves overall computer performance.


Keeping the MFT Reserved Zone Clear

Normally, NTFS file system reserves about 12,5% of the disk space for the MFT records. However, when the rest of the disk space is getting low, the MFT Reserved Zone will be used for storing regular files.
This may lead to MFT fragmentation. Disk Defrag moves regular data files from the MFT Reserved Zone into the rest of the disk space, allowing NTFS to allocate contiguous space for the MFT records and thus to prevent its fragmentation.


Single file or folder defragmentation

Sometimes it makes more sense to defragment frequently used files only, instead of defragmenting an entire drive. Disk Defrag can save your time by defragmenting only files that you want. It allows you to defragment a single file, several files or an entire folder. This option would be useful if you want to speed up application performance immediately and have no time for defragmentation of the entire hard drive.


List of fragmented files

Disk Defrag lists all fragmented files after performing disk analysis.
Selecting any file from the list will highlight its clusters' location on the fragmentation map. You can find the most fragmented files and their paths by sorting the list. The list also lets you chose which files to defragment and files you want to add to the ignore list. All you need to do is right-click on any file directly in the list and select the operation you want to perform.


Auto-defragmentation mode

With its auto-defragmentation feature, Disk Defrag acts in real time, while your system is idle. Since the program is very compact and requires few system resources, it can easily defragment your hard drives in the background and you will not even notice its activity. Use a handy icon (in the bottom-left corner) to easily customize and control auto-defrag mode. Just set Disk Defrag to run automatically and you'll forget about files fragmentation shortly.


Scheduled defragmentation

Running Disk Defrag at least once a weak assures your hard drives are optimized for maximum performance. The program's scheduler will help you to maintain your hard drives on a regular basis. Use a wide range of its options to set the most suitable time span for disks defragmentation. It can be run daily, weekly or monthly, at any time you want. In addition, you can set Disk Defrag to save reports after each defragmentation to control its activity.


Customizing Disk Defrag

Use many handy settings to customize your Disk Defrag.
It can be integrated into the Windows Explorer context menu and minimized to system tray on close. The last option you'll find especially convenient when using the auto-defragmentation mode. You can also set the program to automatically shut down your computer after defragmentation is done.
And with its several fragmentation map colour themes you can change the way your Disk Defrag looks.


Multiple Languages
