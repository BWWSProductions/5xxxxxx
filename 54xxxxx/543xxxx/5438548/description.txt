This is the second studio album from Phoenix, AZ band blessthefall. This is their first album with their new vocalist, Beau Bokan. On the album, he does only the clean vocals, but does some screaming live (they're really good live!).

And yes, the song "God Wears Gucci" is a shot at metalcore band The Devil Wears Prada.
