,Poolshot43,2010-03-18T13:37Z,"As far as burning just use imageburn and double click on the iso file ( after you Extract  it with winrar ) if prompted what to do with an iso file "" open with "" and find the imageburn .exe file and you should be all set.."

,DodgeNeonRT,2010-04-17T17:29Z,Anyone have the AI version (Jan 2010) to share? It's being sold on eBay but I refuse to pay for warez.
[T],JMUTHAFUKND,2010-04-27T08:53Z,People give feed back on this please... hows it working for you?
,Burnasty,2010-08-16T08:24Z,"Works well.  Didn't fix the disc read error problem that everyone gets with this nav system.  The updates that come with it are just map updates and not firmware if you have the af version already.  So unlike when you upgrade from ac to af like i did before and you couldn't use the older disc anymore, with this you could still use your older disc if you need to.  fyi"
[T],JMUTHAFUKND,2010-09-22T00:55Z,"So How should we burn this? On a dual layer Disk? and just put disk into Nav? how to update, I found this disk on internet and decided to shar with everyone, so please somone help me out, LOL"
,Techman71,2010-09-26T05:43Z,"It seems to work fine.

I just upgraded from 5064033AE to this AG in my 07 Pacifica. After a short update It was loaded and ready to go. All I did was use ImgBurn and put it on a Sony DVD+R Dual Layer disc.  "

"
,JubJub1991,2012-06-22T00:51Z,"Well JMUTHAFUKND it seems as if no one has answered your question yet.  Yes you need a dual layer disc and a dual layer burner.  I dont know if yours is a dual layer burner from the desxription.  The best .iso software is PowerISO, and it will allow you to burn it to a disc.  I appreciate you uploading this, and I will seed"
,RandalB,2012-06-30T17:09Z,"Great Torrent! Used Power ISO to create DL DVD for the system, worked like a charm. Also has the override programming so your passenger can enter data while in motion. Seeding as we speak.."
