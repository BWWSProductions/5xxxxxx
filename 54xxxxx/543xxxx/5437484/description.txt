ExposureÂ® 2: The worldâ€™s best film simulator just got better. 

Exposure 2 is the new, even more feature-packed version of our award-winning Photoshop plug-in that gives digital photographs the look and feel of film.

Whether youâ€™re a fashion or wedding photographer, a designer or art director, with Exposure 2 youâ€™ll have one-click access to the broadest range of film stocks and special effects settings available in any software package. Thatâ€™s why Exposure 2 is the closest thing to film since film.

Pick a film, any film. When it comes to the variety of films you can simulate, Exposure 2 has no peer. You can match the look of popular film stocks like PortraÂ®, VelviaÂ®, KodachromeÂ®, PolaroidÂ®, and TRI-XÂ®. Weâ€™ve even saved some films from extinction in Exposure 2, like AgfaÂ® ScalaÂ®, GAFÂ® 500, and KodakÂ® EES.

It all comes down to grain. Exposure 2 gives you the most realistic grain on the market, now with even more control over sharpness, color variation, and intensity throughout the tonal range. And since Exposure 2â€™s grain size automatically adjusts to your image size, you get consistent results across all of your cameras.

More effective effects. With over 300 presets, Exposure 2 has even more special effects settings than before, including push and cross processing, a vastly improved infrared simulator, and sophisticated color to black and white conversion.

So easy to use. Exposure 2 simplifies your workflow by collecting color, dynamic range, softness, and grain control into one easy-to-use plug-in. Correct a colorcast, soften a digital portrait, or tweak contrast with our powerful slider and curve controls. Or even define your signature look and save it as a one-click effect.
