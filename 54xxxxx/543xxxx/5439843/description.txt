Since Mention R5 release of Shutter Island was nuked (cam.audio_out.of.sync.throughout) I have decided to post this release which is better.I recommend you to watch this movie if you havenâ€™t already. Why? Because story is awesome & unpredictable. Just watch the trailer and you will seeâ€¦ Get ready to test your sanity.

Plot:
Itâ€™s 1954, and up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Bostonâ€™s Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital. Heâ€™s been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasnâ€™t been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister.
