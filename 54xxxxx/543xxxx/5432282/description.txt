Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person tactical shooter and the sixth entry in
the popular Call of Duty series. True to its name and following the lead of
its predecessor, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, it places players in modern
combat settings, as opposed to the WWII environments of the earlier Call of
Duty games. This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and
options. Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player,
multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the
most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to the Call of Duty series
