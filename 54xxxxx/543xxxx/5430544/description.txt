A "sandbox" war action game with open-ended gameplay in a gigantic world. Set against the outbreak of warfare spurred on a Korean dictator coup, players have free reign of a massive landscape to take bounties on the "Deck of 52" evil warlords and minions as you work towards taking down the general who started the onslaught. Commandeer tanks, choppers and other military hardware to traverse the game's literally miles of landscape across two complete battlefield areas, and build up cash for armory to finance the big jobs by taking on bounties from field agents.
