,ninja78,2011-10-14T06:19Z,"does PSx stand for PS2? and if so, can I only burn it and play it on my PS2 or can I use an emulator and play it on my computer too?"
,ninja78,2011-10-14T23:39Z,"not to be a downer, but I downloaded this game. Installed PCSX. tried to play the game but, found out I needed the video, BIOS, and audio patches for the Emulator for it to work. best just to go to a pawn shop and buy it for $2 and play it on my PS2 lol. was fun trying to figure this out though."
,wwex786,2012-02-03T00:43Z,"Hey can someone upload this game in PAL.

Thanks."
