They say the mind bends and twists to deal with the horrors of life, but sometimes the mind bends so much that it snaps in two... And so begins the next chapter in car combat: Twisted Metal: Black. Designed and developed by the makers of the original two PSOne games in the series, Twisted Metal: Black sends gamers on a deranged journey through a world rife with horror and desolation. Once underway, players will experience nine vicious battlegrounds with interactive environments and dynamic weather, 14 diabolically destructive vehicles, more than 20 deathmatch maps for four-person multiplayer action, and an improved physics engine that boasts more exaggerated powerslides and more responsive turn rates.
