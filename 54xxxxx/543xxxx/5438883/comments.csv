,lilrush,2010-05-27T22:16Z,"I have put this on my iphone with diskaid, to the same directory as the installous apps are stored in. Except when I press ""install"", it says decompressing archive and never moves past that screen. I can lock and unlock my phone fine but not access any other features while it is stuck on this screen. Is it normal to be stuck on this screen for a while due to the size of the ipa?"

thank you!!"
