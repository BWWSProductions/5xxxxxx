i'm brazilian, been looking forward for a real torrent of this game, i mean, one who REALLY works on my drivekey modded wii, but it's been useless... my question is: does it REALLY work through the disc channel on a drivekey wii? mine is 4.1 U and no softmod. i see it must be your 2nd uploaded torrent, that's why i'm asking for this not included information. can you please answer? see ya! o/"
,repoguy151,2010-03-18T02:35Z,i have drive key NSMB comp. the one with yellow sticker. ...works with that 1 fine... no issues. i also have the drive key not NSMB comp on another wii... but it wont work on that 1  (Drive key must be NSMB comp) or you have to use neogamma or usb gx.... thats all i tested it on....this is clean copy...not scrubbed. LIKE i say i can only verify what i have tested (sorry) any other comments or test PLEASE leave feed back for others.

,simweb,2010-03-20T08:56Z,Hardmodded D2PRO Wii PAL with Firmware 4.1 does not work with this ISO. It just makes black screen. (Have no soft modd on the console)
,simweb,2010-03-20T08:57Z,tested it after I bricked it. (removed the update from the ISO)
,gnetix,2010-04-30T00:03Z,I can't burn this for some reason. Keep getting an error at 90%. I'm using memorex  dvd-r's and imageburn at 3 and 4x speeds. Wasted two disks. I'm going to try a different burning program. Imageburn works for my 360 games using dual-layer disks. This is the first time I've tried a wii game though.
,gnetix,2010-05-01T00:05Z,"Sorry about the bum comment. When I reinstalled imageburn, I used a bad installer. It was only 2MB in size and kept wasting disks. Finally figured it out and got the REAL imageburn(4MB) and everything is fine. Didn't want to scare anyone off. Thanks for the up!!"
,steviekeyz,2010-05-05T05:49Z,"Works great, had some new DVD-R's laying around and would only burn at 4x... but still played fine. 1st disc I didn't patch the main.dol file inside the ISO so when I used NeoGamma the error disc screen came up a few times randomly during game play. 2nd disc I patched it using WiIScrubber then burned it again and plays perfect. thx!"
,one2btrbl,2010-06-02T01:46Z,"Using NeoGamma with 4.2U and it doesn't work! Used IMGBURN and still nothing, just keeps rebooting to main system menu. If anybody has any ideas or suggestions, I'm willing to listen and try. TIA"
