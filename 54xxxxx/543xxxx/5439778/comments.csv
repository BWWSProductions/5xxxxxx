,Strikefear13,2010-03-17T16:32Z,"Very first thing I tried worked perfectly.  Skidrow release with Razor1911 patch applied.  Make sure you copy EVERYTHING in the patch folder over, not just the exe.

[V],globeplus,2010-03-18T22:03Z,"the concept o this file under the high standards of the video cards required to play this game , the most common is series 6 in front run the games , was to reduce to the minimum graphics suplements like , shadows , reflexions , antialiasing and things like that , not requiring than the video cards to have the latest technology in that graphics standards that some series of video cards can not be correctly aprimorated then if this extras in the graphics quality are reduced to the minimum exigences in video cards standards decrease a bit no really needed the all the highest standards in the graphics quality , than more nice video cards that maybe don´t support high standards in the graphics have a decent shot to run the game , is like you can have the possibility in a nice game to choose medium quality standards to play a game inside the game options , i think they pushed a little bit the requirements i the video cards for this game and this was the only way for the requirements in the video cards be more close as possible to the general normality to play nice games ."

I recomend:
1 Extract this file
2 copy the orginal ""textures.vfs1"" file to extracted folder
3 Creat a New RAR Archive with the game created (so you can burn on DVD0
4 Delete any files from another Installation (i Mean):
you have to delet : C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Local Settings\Application Data\4A Games

Delete ""4A Games"" Folder
Run The Game !

You are mixing the meaning of two things:

video game PUBLISHER and video game DEVELOPER. They are not the same!!!!

For example : Batman: Arkham Asylum is developed by Rocksteady studios and published by eidos. (Not developed by eidos...)
Ea Sports has nothing to do with BF: BC 2. that game was developed by EA Digital Illusions CE (DICE) which is EA's (also publisher here) own development studio.

if we try to run game on intel x4500 onboard graphic adapter, the game won't run due to unsuppoted Graphic card.
there is a workaround to run this game on low settings that if we patch the game to skip that message saying unknown graphic card detected, the game will run fine. I tried and worked for me.

here is we first update the game to ""metro 2033 Update 1"" and copy crack. then open the file metro2033.exe in any hex editor and goto offset x0053607D and change from 18 to 00 and save. then run the game, change graphic options to low. that's it."
