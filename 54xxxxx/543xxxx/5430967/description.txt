This is a collection of Samplers of german Funk. I know, "German Funk" sounds like a contradiction in itself, but hey, you should give it a try. The music is mainly from the 70s, except Album "No. 2" which is modern electro Funk (or however you want to call it...). I admit that some stuff sounds quite wacky, but if you understand german, you`ll love it, i recommend the Song "Marihuana Mantra"!
