,Strikefear13,2010-03-16T05:24Z,"Not fake, just not region free or ntsc.  To the unintelligent, that means if you bought your xbox 360 in america..you're shit out of luck."
,Strikefear13,2010-03-16T05:25Z,"Also, it's out early because games are leaked days or even weeks early all the time.  Wait till later today, ntsc versions will be all over the net."
