It is Christmas Eve, London, and all's quiet - save for the whispering of a grass. Now if there's one thing Jack Carter can't stand, it's a grass, especially as Jimmy Swann is about to put him and his mates down for a twenty-year stretch.

The answer's simple - shoot him before he shoots his mouth off. Simple maybe, but first you've got to find Jimmy, who isn't advertising his whereabouts.

Jack Carter is a hard man, and he doesn't give up easily; though even he was not prepared for the trail of murder and mayhem that dogged his search for the informer.

Ted Lewis's second Jack Carter thriller combines horrific realism with sardonic humour and crackles with tension and excitement as he portrays the brutal half-world of pool-halls, massage parlours and teenage pornography. Nail-bitingly gripping
