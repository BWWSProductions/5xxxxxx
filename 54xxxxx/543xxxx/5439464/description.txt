These 29 tracks are my picks -- the songs from both 
The Velvet Underground years and a very limited 
selection from Lou Reed's long career since then that 
I wanted to save.  Most tracks are 320K, except for 
Lou Reed's 1996 CD, which I could find no higher than 192K.

I only included one song by Nico, who was gone after
VU's first album anyway.


This is The Executive Collection, 
and you are in.....The Music Zone!
