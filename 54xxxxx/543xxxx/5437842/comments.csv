,godofgrind,2010-03-19T17:23Z,any chance of a reseed for this amazing pack of classic Canadian metal. Thanks from Edmonton
,DiscipleOfPower,2010-03-20T00:33Z,Ya i'm still seeding it but no one else seems to be so far :/ 
,godofgrind,2010-03-22T16:37Z,"I'll seed it now that I've got it. Was just at Wes Sontag's house Friday night, saying how I hoped this torrent would work as it's so damn hard to find D.O.P. anywhere anymore. I also asked him what would be the odds of a D.O.P. reunion.
He just laughed. Thanks again for sharing this bit of classic Canadian metal. Cheers"
,DiscipleOfPower,2010-03-22T19:57Z,"Awesome.. Ya i know how hard it is to find so thats why i scoured the net to find it and put it all into a torrent. I have old cassette tapes and maybe a cd or 2 but having them all in mp3 is even better. Haha thats apparently the reaction all the dop guys give when asked about a reunion :/ No worries, thanks for helping share it !! Btw i have a dop group on fb.. check it out."
