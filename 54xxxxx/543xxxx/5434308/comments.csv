Posting torrents to Piratebay is not working - use the magnet link instead to download new torrents."
,BasilBrush,2010-03-14T22:33Z,"All the torrents are cross posted on Demonoid under the username 'tdf2007':
www[dot]demonoid[dot]com/files/?uid=3469164"
,BasilBrush,2010-03-16T14:15Z,"Looks like Piratebay won't be fixed by 17th March 2010. I'll cross post the FIS and IBU torrents to Demonoid. If you use the magnet link try manually adding the tracker:
http://tracker[dot]openbittorrent[dot]com:80/announce
and enable DHT. This'll help you find the seeders quicker."
