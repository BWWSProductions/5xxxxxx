The film is set in a typical Tokyo High School following the story of a perpetually teenage vampire named Monami (Yukie Kawamura) who falls for her classmate, Mizushima (Takumi Saito), who happens to already be the reluctant boyfriend to the vice-principal/science professor's daughter, Keiko (Eri Otoguro). The ensuring love triangle leads Monami to seek the assistance of her father who, unbeknown to his daughter, moonlights as a Kabuki-clad mad scientist with the school nurse as his assistant.
