can you upload ps1 ""fighting force 2"" and ""galerians""? Thanx"
[V],Big_dude,2010-03-15T06:23Z,Game wasn't able to rebuild to dvd some games you can't.
,mervynsow,2011-07-23T23:27Z,In the Release notes it sez that it cannot be converted to DVD. therefore you cannot patch with ESR cos it has to be on a DVD. those with Free McBoot could try putting it on a hard drive and using OPL to load it. 
,mervynsow,2011-07-24T01:23Z,"This must be the smallest ps2 game ever. 60meg! shrinks to 50meg when converted to iso. i put the image in a virtual drive (alcohol 120%). then ripped it as an iso with ImgBurn. renamed iso to SLES_518.59.Billiards.iso  
Dragged it onto a USB drive in a folder called CD. booted PS2 with Free McBoot then loaded iso with OPL from USB drive.  "
