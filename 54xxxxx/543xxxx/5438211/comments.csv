,SixStringSlinger,2010-03-22T10:00Z,"Hey aeroyacine and Kileruw, stop requesting so many videos you selfish jerks. You've probably scared 2nafish off. The guy just uploaded a whole concert for you....that's how unselfish and generous he is. 
So just download whatever he wants to upload and stop asking for so many of your Precious little requests ....you stupid wankers!
He give's you a drink...you want the whole fucking lake.
So do us all a favour and shut the hell up.
