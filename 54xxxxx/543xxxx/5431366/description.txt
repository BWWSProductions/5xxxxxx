This is a classic 1983 concert from Japanese rockers Loudness. I'm sure it is NOT the same concert as released on the CD, Live Aloud Live. For one thing their is a completly different song list, and when i played Exploder it was different to the CD version. (i don't have the CD case with me) I ripped this from my own original DVD, it should be region free, 4.04 gb. Burn it straight to a DVD and crank it up! :)
