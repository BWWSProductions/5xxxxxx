After a devastating battle with the alien villain Brainiac, The Man of Steel learns that a piece of his home planet Krypton survived - the shrunken, bottle city of Kandor! And when the city is grown to normal size, it looks like Superman finally has the connection to his past he's been missing all his life as thousands of Kryptonians are suddenly able to walk the Earth. But his happiness soon turns to dread as relations between the Kryptonians and humans dissolve, and the two cultures face a massive clash! 

Written by Geoff Johns, James Robinson, and Sterling Gates with art by Gary Frank, Alex Ross, Renato Guedes, Jamal Igle and Pete Woods.

This story begins a planned "link" in Action Comics, Superman, and Supergirl as part of their collective plans for Superman and his cast of characters through 2008 and beyond. The events of this story lead directly into the 12-part series Superman: World of New Krypton and the World Without Superman story arc.
