├é┬½Morphogenesis├é┬╗ proposes an initiation trip through the cultures and the Ages, where ancestral voices are confronted with the deafening silence of modernity. Within this second album, ├é┬½Mind Necrosis Factor├é┬╗ mixes acoustic instruments and shooting rhythms, tribal cries and post-industrial atmospheres. More than genesis of a new shape, this album relates the emergence of a mind, from the obscurity of the first moments to pain cessation. It invites us to look beyond the flesh, to feel the breath of the hidden self inside us.
