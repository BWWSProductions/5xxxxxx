,j-d-uk,2010-03-17T03:58Z,"EZZZZZZZY!

Oh yeah this eztv team are the best guys around, the dogs bollox!

None of that fuckin' unRARin' BS you get from the TVteam what's all that about anyway?
Having to unRAR a 350Mb video, bunch of fuckin' muppits if you ask me, and the sound is usually blow out and fucked up too!

Cheers ez!"

Quit complaining already. It'll come out eventually. Some people are actually grateful that the episode is out this early.

Any later and I would have had to wait until tomorrow to watch it.

Thanks for the quick release, EZ!"

,audio_god,2010-03-17T06:14Z,"720p is shit compared to the 1080i that they broadcast in the UK on Sky. trouble is, it doesn't air until Friday - and I'm not fucking waiting 3 more days to watch Lost"
,suzuki600srad,2010-03-17T09:11Z,jahnee i think you should be grateful that you are able to watch this so quick eztv are the best for this kind of thing so stop being a twat. if you want 720p wait and shut the fuck up. people do this for nothing it takes up there time all you do is click a button. so top bitching and grow up. dick head
