Dutch reissue label Disky's Golden Greats series of triple CDs of the works of major pop singers takes advantage of the European copyright law that releases recordings more than 50 years old into the public domain. When it comes to people like Billie Holiday and Judy Garland, that puts a substantial number of the artists' recordings at the label's disposal for no charge. Dean Martin is another story. Something of a late bloomer, he didn't start to take off as a recording artist until 1953, when "That's Amore" became his first gold record. But given that this album was released in 2002, that and Martin's later hits were off-limits to Disky. The label adapts by trimming the length of the package, which contains only 60 tracks and runs less than three hours. Still, those tracks have to date from Martin's apprenticeship period of 1946-1952. He did score one Top Ten hit, "Powder Your Face With Sunshine (Smile! Smile! Smile!)," and it's right up front. But for the most part, he did a lot of recording without a lot of success. Every studio recording he made up to mid-1950 is here, including tracks for the small labels Diamond, Apollo, and Embassy before he signed to Capitol in 1948. There are also several tracks -- "Again," "Some Enchanted Evening," "If I Knew Then (What I Know Now)," "Till Then," an early take of "If You Were the Only Girl in the World," and "Deep Purple" -- that you won't find in a Martin discography. Most likely, they are airchecks from the radio series The Martin and Lewis Show. Martin sings a variety of material, including Broadway show tunes, numbers from his movies, and assorted novelties, demonstrating his usual versatility. The packaging, meanwhile, is Disky's typical bare-bones effort, without even a CD booklet included.
