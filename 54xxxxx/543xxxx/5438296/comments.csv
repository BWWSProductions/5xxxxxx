VHS quality was nothing compared to theater film. Even when TVs upgrade to 4k HD in the next 10 years (2160p), these old movies will still be able to be upgraded for home use. The quality of movie film even from the 60s was really good.

@xiIix

I thought so too at first but when you think about it, this movie bombed at the box office and the only people who cared about it were people who grew up watching the re-runs. Those people (like me) are now in their late 20s or older and really don't care about children's movies anymore. A lot of us have already gotten past our nostalgia stage, too."
