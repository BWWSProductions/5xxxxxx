The follow-up to the blockbuster Spider-Man movie brings with it a follow-up to the blockbuster game, Spider-Man: The Movie. The menacing Dr. Octopus has put NYC in crisis again, but the webslinger is older, wiser and more in command of his powers now. In keeping with the more in-control Spider-Man, the game's controls have been beefed up considerably to allow never-before-seen moves and amazing agility in a fully-explorable 3D world that takes the popular "sandbox" concept of games like Tony Hawk's Underground and GTA and allows Spidey to take on missions and challenges all across the city as he and his spider-senses see best.
