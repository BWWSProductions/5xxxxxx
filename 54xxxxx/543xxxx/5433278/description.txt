Bedroom boffins such as Danger Mouse have changed the sound of pop music, but home recording methods have had less audible impact on jazz and world music, which is more about performance than fiddling with a PC. However, guitarist Nguyen Le has used the freedom of home recording to make an album that's relaxed, flowing and uncliched. Where his recent albums have used regulation rhythm sections, Homescape is based upon improvised duos with either trumpeter Paolo Fresu or oud player/ vocalist Dhafer Youssef, usually backed by simple, loops and samples. Le's post-production (all at home, too) has then crafted these performances into a piquant series of moving and thrilling world-jazz tracks.

Le gives plenty of space to his collaborators, but resists the temptation to be too self-effacing; this rhythmic electroacoustic melange is a sympathetic setting for his guitar solos, too. Fresu's trumpet playing is fleet and crisp, while Youssef's resonant oud-playing provides a great foil to Le's distinctive electric guitar parts, which evoke lands both further east and west. Youssef also delivers some passionate, wordless vocal parts, the one on Byzance taken from the recording of a live gig in Glasgow.

Nguyen Le is a masterful, inventive player who has cultivated a wholly unique voice on the instrument. He ranks right up there with Bill Frisell, John Scofield, Mike Stern, and Allan Holdsworth in the post-Hendrix world of jazz guitar.

In the main sunny and joyful, though not without some darker and more abrasive moments, the fifteen tracksâ€”average length three minutes, a handful six or sevenâ€”resemble a series of round-the-world postcards sent by Le, who mixed and post-produced everything solo, to his collaborators. As a soundtrack to an evening communing with the big bamboo, the exotic and the very exotic drifting in and out of the mix, it's rich, colourful and beguiling.
