You rock!"

,bhobson333,2011-05-25T22:22Z,"Hey, longshoredrift and Iron_Yuppie!  How about seeding?  I'm stuck at 80.5% and have been for a week.  You were hung at 97.5% and I guess someone was seeding after that, so you should be able to seed for us.  If someone will seed until I have the whole thing, I will convert it to a top-quality 2 GB AVI and upload it and seed for a long time."
