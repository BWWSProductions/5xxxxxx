How the hell can you mix up these two programmes?"
[T],renman,2010-03-18T18:02Z,While I am not infallible I simply don't make those sort of mistakes. Methinks your comments were intended for someone else's torrent as this IS what it states it is

[T],renman,2010-03-21T02:10Z,It certainly is a weird error your getting. Is it only my torrents your having a problem with? Be interested to know what's causing this too.
