,Balagran,2010-03-19T18:02Z,"Ahaha
Hahaha
Bwahahaha.
This is a steaming pile of horseshit. Really.
The book is FICTIONAL. Keyword: FICTIONAL.
Fiction (Latin: fictum, ""created"") is a branch of literature  which deals, in part or in whole, with temporally contrafactual events (events that are not true at the time of writing)
Quit making such a big deal out of it ""OMGLOLOL!!1!!ONEone1!1eleven NECKROWNAWMEEKAWN"""
,kahuna808,2010-06-13T22:24Z,"People, Listen carefully...
Humans are very powerful creatures that have power in thought. Never EVER think for a second that a Negative Entity can take control of your life or drive you mad or insane. Even if you accidentally studied wrongly or made mistakes in your search for this ancient knowledge that so many people Hoard and hide for themselves for greedy personal gain ,FEAR Not for only fear is there power! Just Make or Have some ORGONE nearby or wear as a pendant and watch the Negative entity's Burn and Crackle in front of your own eyes. LIFE GOD ENERGY ORGONE !!! Make Orgonite yourself with the very intent to dissolve these Fears or Attached Souls and I Swear this will thwart there negative motives or intents effortlessly. With every negative there is a positive and Negative cannot survive near the positive elements. Orgone Burns Them Down!! Read read read away for Orgone is here to stay !! "
,Leecher13,2011-03-21T04:20Z,"yeah right! completely fictional, nobody forces you to believe it. besides why would authorities trying to ban this book? I haven't read this one but if you'd try to read other copies of it then you'd know."
,Aurasan,2011-07-13T11:24Z,"yeah sorry I'm gonna have to go with the masses on this one. Fictional. (I own this, it was printed in the 90s).

Yes, a malignant spirit CAN take control of you. Anyone who says otherwise is a fucking idiot. Got it, Bra? A real-life Micah (the douche from Paranormal Activity - a FICTIONAL movie)

However, I'd give a closer look at the keys of Solomon as opposed to this book if youre interested in REAL magick.
-OR-
find a copy of some old ass research books on the occult and on magick protection, find a demons name and (in a protected space) summon the bloke to do what you will."
,Aurasan,2011-07-13T11:39Z,Oh and for the record.. AncientBlackMagic.com is a total scam site.
