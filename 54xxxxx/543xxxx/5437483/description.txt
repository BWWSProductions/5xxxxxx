Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover in the late 1940s. However, only Andy knows that he didnâ€™t commit the crimes. Sent to Shawshank Prison to do hard time, Andyâ€“a taciturn banker in the outside worldâ€“has to learn to get by in the brutal, cutthroat confines of prison life. His quiet strength slowly earns the respect of his fellow inmatesâ€“most notably, Red (Morgan Freeman)â€“and even much of the prison staff. But Andyâ€™s seemingly stoic acceptance of his unjust imprisonment hides a fierce determination for freedom.
