,JesterDev,2010-04-26T08:08Z,What you are on about? There is nothing like that going on here. Just copy over the file in the crack folder to the installed folder and run. A child could figure this out.

The trail version has expired and wanting to crack it so i can use 3.0. 3.0 is downloaded, but says train version has expired. What in the world do I need to do now?? Step by step for I am a big dummy with this stuff. I do not have a key generator installed on computer so like i said i need step by step instructions on how i get the full workin version other than paying 350.00 for it :)"
,DemonTraitor,2010-08-11T12:12Z,"Works great. Inside the NEW FOLDER, there is a ""Setup"" install executable. Just run that and it works fine.

,lymur,2010-10-22T23:06Z,"Great torrent, works fine, lots of seeders, now including myself ;) 

Anybody who was a bit confused like myself, don't put the seed in the initially extracted folder, install the program fully, THEN replace the 'Audition.exe' file in your programfiles/adobe/audition folder with the crack file in the CRACK folder.

 Quick question: What's the point of disallowing the program internet access? I couldn't seem to access my firewall's settings for specific programs, but the program seems to work dandy."
,lymur,2010-10-22T23:13Z,"Nevermind, figured out the internet connection. I'm assuming disabling it is to block verification of authenticity. If anyone else is wondering, open firewall with advanced security, and find the program (or create a new rule and select it) and then click disable connections. SIMPLE"
,YungRod2G,2010-11-14T22:36Z,"so I'm not gettin it..I got windows xp..after I click save, its like I have this file that I have to pair up with another program to open..what do I do?"
,isausalcedo,2010-12-22T06:43Z,"Whoa. Thank you grimreaper420! I'm just a teenager and I managed to install it successfully! THANK YOU SO MUCH. To all the other people having problems, open ""setup"" folder, then double click ""Audition3_EFGJSI_Trial"" to start setting up. Then a new folder will be made somewhere in your computer (in my case, the folder's name is ""adobe"" located in my desktop) I click it then I double click ""Audition 3.0 Setup"" to run the actual installation. When it is done, I go to ""C:"" then ""Program Files"" then ""Adobe"" then ""Adobe Audition"". I copy ""Audition"" file from the Crack folder to the folder in the Program Files, then I click yes when asked the permission to replace the original ""Audition"" file in Program Files. Then DONE. I double click the ""Audition"" application. It loads, then there you have it. A complete version of Adobe Audition brought to us by grimreaper420. :) Sorry if my instructions aren't that clear, but I hope you get it, so.. ENJOY! ĂÂź"

,Way2Fonky,2011-02-08T09:25Z,"Sorry guys. Can someone help me I did what isausalcedo did but when I used it, it kept freezing. I probably did it wrong. Can y'all show me step by step."
,amishbuggy116,2011-04-23T18:27Z,"This is the first time I've ever commented, THANKS alot. This program may be old but it is  still freakin awesome. Just download and install the trial version (disconnect from the net), once intalled go to ""program files x86"", Adobe, Adobe Audition, scroll down until you see the .exe file and delete it, paste the crack .exe file into Adobe Audition, fire the net back up and you're good to go.

,fllmetlspaceman,2011-05-12T05:58Z,thanks grimreaper420 did it just like isausalcedo said and works great

,Jishwashdishwash,2011-08-08T10:49Z,"Can someone help me? I messed up and just went on with the 30 day trial. I figured i could fix it later. Is it too late? If not, what do i do?"
,immerseyoursoulinlove,2011-10-30T18:40Z,"@amishbuggy116, thanks a lot!!!"
,torbot1,2011-12-26T16:17Z,Okk ! Thanks to all for helping me :)
,Poseidon_M_Hernandez,2012-01-02T18:35Z,I love this program but it started freezing up after I installed it along Photoshop CS4. I think Adobe Bridge detects it and messes it up. It used to work fine when other CS software wasn't present in my PC. I am not saying anything negative about this torrent but speaking generally. 
,wvyno,2012-03-25T04:44Z,Worked perfectly. Thanks man.
,wvyno,2012-03-25T04:56Z,"Worked perfectly. Thanks man. The only thing is I get an error that says ""Sound Card driver does not support DirectSound input"" and warns I can't record with a mic. I haven't tried using a mic, but I feel like this is a driver issue and not an issue with the software/torrent. I was able to mix from MP3s on my computer perfectly, so thank you."
