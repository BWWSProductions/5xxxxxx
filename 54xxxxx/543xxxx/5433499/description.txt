Release Notes:
--------
John Hiatt recently picked up a lifetime achievement award from the Americana
Music Association â€” a fitting tribute to a man who was writing and singing
Americana long before we knew that was what it was called. On Fireball Roberts,
he fashions the kind of simple, bluesy, yearning ballad he has long been the
master of, aching guitar work wrapped around finely turned lyrics: â€œI was trying
to leave the black dog home/But it followed me to your house/And it carried its
own chewed bone.â€ But this slow, melancholy style is outweighed by upbeat
bar-band rock and an optimistic desire to get back out there. Even the glimpses
of world-weariness â€” â€œI used to roll through here like a freight train, but my
wheelâ€™s come offâ€ â€” are trumped by the overall air of defiance. â€œIâ€™m gonna go
down swinginâ€™,â€ Hiatt sings, â€œsinging till the end.â€ Excellent news.
