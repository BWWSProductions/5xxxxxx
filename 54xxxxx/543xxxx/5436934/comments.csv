,aabell77,2010-04-08T20:24Z,"all this did was give me the manual for the program, and an uninstall"
,Creepy_wonder,2010-04-16T11:27Z,"@franenwer... thanks dude :)
@philbagg... It should work.. It working for me :)
@aabell77... there should be a .dll file installed in the default VST folder...
If you use any Steinberg product.. it should be inside it... If you can't see the VST listed in the host.. then find out the folder in which the .dll file is installed & add that to the VST directory manually...n your host should scan it out... Then it should work :)
Hope this helps :)"

,ibutton77,2010-05-19T02:01Z,"using AVG v9.0
scanned rar file downloaded, no hits.
Scanned unpacked rar setup.exe, no hits.
Ran setup, which produced a readme, uninstall and vst. Scanned those, no hits.

Ran vst in audacity, shortly after beginning to use VST's interface AVG resident shield began detecting threats, executable files in ""temp"", ""content.ie5"", etc. File explorer identified the baddies in content.ie5 as coming from support.w2c.ru, most of the executables are marked as some kind of trojan or another.

My goal is not to freak people out and my evidence linking that event to this autotune offering is limited mostly to the temporal coincidence. But I would appreciate anyone with more scanning experience than I to look into this more closely.

Thank you."

,Yedae,2010-07-31T03:57Z,4.7 megabytes for Autotune? I don't think so. This is bullshit.
,stk_rew,2010-08-15T18:22Z,greak! thanks!
,Antubis,2010-09-15T14:29Z,"Odd little issue. My antivirus put a stop to the download, claiming ""TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen"". I threw an exception on, finished download, then sent to Virus Total, and it came up fine (even for my current active AV)

http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=ec815652769b8547a36d6d50145b36da5688184f4148a64faeee41e4c93d053e-1284553533

Time to give it a go, I am assuming only the VST plugin based on size. "
,Antubis,2010-09-15T15:17Z,"Ok, threw in the sandbox grinder, and out the other side. 

Puts files in 
%Program Files%\Antares Audio Technologies\Auto-Tune Evo\(How-To PDF)
%Program Files%\Antares Audio Technologies\Uninstall\(Uninstaller)
%Common Files%\Digidesign\DAE\Plug-Ins\(RTAS PLUGIN)
%Program Files%\Steinberg\(VST PLUGIN)
%AppData%\Roaming\Antares\(Config Files)
%StartMenu%\Programs\Antares Audio Technologies\(Start Menu Links)

Installed Audacity 1.3 (has native VST support) in the Sandbox

Copied VST dll to the Audacity plugin folder and ran it.

Its working fine, listed just after WahWah in effects. With the effect 'opened' (need a track, I recorded myself saying test), the Options button in the top right brings up the configurable options for Auto-Tune, with the version in the lower left listed as 

Auto-Tune Evo VST Version 6.0.9

At this point, another scan of the sandbox files and activity shows only audacity running, and no unexpected files are anywhere in the sandbox system.

SO....

As far as I'm concerned, this is a clean release, and I do believe ibutton77 had a case of temporal coincidence. If anyone wishes to double check my findings, by all means. Software used to test includes Audacity 1.3.12, Sandboxie x64 3.48, and the VirusTotal Uploader"
