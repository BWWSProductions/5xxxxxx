boujou 5 Features
-----------------

New Automatic Sequential Solver

Previous versions of boujou took the entire shot into account before delivering a solve. boujou 5 looks at a single frame at a time, enabling the user to intervene as needed and making the entire process significantly faster.

Fully Functional Graph Editor

The Graph Editor enables the user to manually tweak the camera data and, if necessary, resolve. boujou 5 also provides the ability to lock valid sections of solve data or sections known to be correct. Those sections can then be used to improve other areas.

Reference Frames

The Reference Frames feature enables users to import still images taken with any camera and use them to assist in a solve.

New Target Tracker
The Pattern Matching Tracker in boujou has been completely rewritten so it provides a faster workflow. Target Tracking now can specify a pattern on a single frame as well as tracking multiple patterns simultaneously.
