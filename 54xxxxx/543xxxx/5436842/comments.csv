,doctoreee,2010-03-17T01:07Z,scratch my last comment. I found it. Spotlight had to index it first. Its 32bit and seems to be working.

,hundert1,2010-03-25T01:55Z,"Hi,

I am wondering, who cracked it?

There is no credit to it.
I dont care about the software as much as about who finally broke the nut open. No one could crack BJ 4.

Was it Xforce?"
,dankspot,2010-03-25T10:01Z,It was cracked by a member of forum.gfxnews.ru named pikachu1965
