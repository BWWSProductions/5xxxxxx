Can you confirm this girl, who does seem to look very young is posing for other photographers?

It is not that the pictures are not appreciated, but anyone traveling with a computer these days can have it searched by any LEO it seems on general suspicions. And if you're traveling abroad, the customs agents at any border can have a look at all your files and you can't say word one about it. 


With all this being said, 

Thanks for the pics.

I know she still looks young, but I've seen people not yet 25 who looked over 50. We can't all look our age, after all.

Also unfortunate,but I can't speak nor read Polish, Though I love their dill pickles and their Sauerkraut. There is a nice little grocery store near where I live which sells a lot of imported foodstuffs from Europe and some from Asia.
