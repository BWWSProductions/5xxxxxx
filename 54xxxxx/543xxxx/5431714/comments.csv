The aspect ratio is a bit off (2.18), I think the encoder meant to encode at 720x300 (not 700x320). LOL Otherwise, a fine release, if not the best of The Road so far."

story is kind of cool, movie is long but not as boring as first thought, but i hope someone would explain the ending to me.

thank you for sharing,"
