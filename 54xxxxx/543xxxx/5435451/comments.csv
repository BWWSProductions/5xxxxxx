,scissor88,2010-03-14T17:41Z,This is APE so why is it posted under FLAC ? Probably only kalhan knows.....
,Meshuger,2010-03-14T19:23Z,"where (and why) did you find ""FLAC""???"
,timtowtdi,2010-03-14T21:05Z,"There is no lossless category, there are other formats than FLAC, like APE, or even better than FLAC like Wavpack, which I prefer over FLAC.  The category should be renamed to LOSSLESS, why should all people stick to FLAC?"

Its 2:30 pm Mountain Standard"
,kalhan,2010-03-15T16:33Z,"guys... here's a list of lossless formats, fyi

wave, wv, flac, shn, ape, aac, alac

any audio in these formats can be converted to one-from-another using dbpoweramp (my personal preference) or other audio converting softwares...

ALL LOSSLESS"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding

Expect loss from AAC.

I too am often annoyed with uploads of ape and shn files (I have yet to get stuck with ALAC).

If you plan to upload one of these formats, please include that information in the title (as this one does) so users are prepared for what they get.

Though I would recommend using FLAC as there is no reason to use any of the others (and for some of them good reasons not to use them: wave, alac, & shn)."
