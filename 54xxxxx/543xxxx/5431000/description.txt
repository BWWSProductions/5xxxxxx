A good man, a bad move, and then all Hell breaks loose!  Cole Claudle was just one big score away from his happily-ever-after when everything went off the rails, and fast.  Now, one man's last shot at the American Dream becomes the first shotgun blast in a mob war halfway between Vegas and nowhere.
