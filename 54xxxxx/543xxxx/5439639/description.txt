Introducing a different kind of add-on from HiFi that works with both FSX and FS9!  With XPax, the experience of carrying passengers in an airline environment is brought to you in an entertaining and realistic way. 

Passengers and their individual statistics including health and approval rating are constantly updated based on the performance of the flight. The entire flight process, from pre-boarding to deplaning, is simulated and supplemented by multimedia content including audio and video.
