It seems to crash due to a lack of license, and never ever asks for a serial :P
So this is either a fake or broken."
,Husky_65,2011-09-04T15:26Z,I've had some issues with FS passenger X too. I hope this one's trouble-free. Does this have the same sort of qualities as the FsPassenger X? Can You create companies and watch their success? Does it record personal data and improvement?
