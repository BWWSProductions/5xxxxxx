,jrock1112,2011-04-27T08:33Z,"Hey having a bit of trouble extracting.  Everytime I try to unrar, it says I'm need to have a certain volume to continue extraction, then to insert disk with this volume.  If I try a later file, I get the same error.  Any help with this would be greatly appreciated."
,jrock1112,2011-04-27T08:55Z,Nevermind.  Figured it out
,BrikSquad,2011-05-16T04:07Z,@jrock1112 What did you do to figure it out?

,ibanessie,2012-01-09T12:04Z,"Hi, to unrar. First you need to unrar all 16 files. Then you get 16 new folders with a new rar file in each folder. Secondly you need to put all the new rar files into the same folder. Then you should be able to unzip the new rar files. Its very important they are in the same folder, otherwise they will keep asking for each other, or whatever they do.
Best regards, Ibanessie"

It's an old throwback to the days when people needed to download smaller files due to slow/crap internet. These days it's just used to fuckin annoy people. (I suppose there's still the binaries)"
