,yayagu1,2010-11-25T15:01Z,"This is INSANE! I made this rip back in 2002 (hence the CD size) and put out on torrentspy. The site's been dead a while but am I surprised the rip I made still lives! :-D
WOW! Thanks. This is an awesome movie! I remembered it after watching Exit Through The Gift Shop. Banksy rocks!"
