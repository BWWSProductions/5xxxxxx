Collecting the torrents together seems like a good idea but it dilutes the seeding and will eventually slow down the download. A better idea is to just collect the torrent files together and create a grand-daddy torrent rather than the huge MKV files.

Then people will run the grand-daddy torrent and create the sub torrent files. Hopefully people would then import the sub-torrent files to join with the original torrents."

i dont care if its in 1 file or not, but spreading information must be more important than spreading pixels!"
