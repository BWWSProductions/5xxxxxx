Witness every stage of the world's most electrifying rock band! Plug Me In - the new 3DVD Collector's Edition set contains over 7 hours of rare and unreleased LIVE video from AC/DC. DVD 1 goes all the way back to 1975 and original singer Bon Scott with the band's first appearance on TV, quickly followed by two never-before-seen performances from the 1976 show at Sydney's St. Alban's High School. Also on DVD 1 are live clips from Melbourne, London, Glasgow, Holland, and Munich - including the very first public performance of the song "Highway To Hell"! DVD 2 picks up in Tokyo, with Brian Johnson at the mic. Tearing through new songs and old, the band clearly doesn't miss a beat and goes on straight through 2003 - performing with childhood heroes The Rolling Stones. Also included are rare interviews, tour promo films and alternate live versions. DVD 3 is a 2 hour collection called "Between The Cracks" - stuff too good to leave out! Included are both Bon and Brian eras, featuring the never-before-seen 1983 show from the Houston Summit.Total Running Time: approx. 7 hours
