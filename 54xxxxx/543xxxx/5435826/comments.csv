,_MardyBum_,2010-03-16T20:24Z,Thanks! So I guess the problem is fixed now?
,pt.caesar,2010-03-17T16:42Z,"Nope~~~~~;
Everyone stuck at 99.9% with a imcomplete .r00!

Please do something, maybe a .r00 torrent;
Thanks in advance."
[T],Robston,2010-03-18T10:59Z,"Yes the torrent gets stuck at 99.9% but the file still extracts fine.

Thanks for the upload."
,pt.caesar,2010-03-18T11:55Z,"Robston, would you mind sharing your PC knowledge -- how to extract the file?"
[T],Robston,2010-03-18T12:37Z,"The original video is in an RAR archive, so once you have downloaded all the files right click on any archive file and extract (to your choice of location, for example desktop).

I've got WinRAR installed which is one of the pieces of software to extract archives. Search TPB for a copy of WinRAR.

Hope this helps."
,pt.caesar,2010-03-18T13:29Z,"Thanks for your kind inputs, Robston!

It's my bad, I didn't express myself clearly;
I mean how to extract the file with an incomplete .r00, for instance the parficular Skins s04e07 720p achieve."

As per my previous comment above, in this case the incomplete file as shown by utorrent (or whatever you're using), isn't actually incomplete. It shows as 47.4mb but is actually 47.6mb, which is a complete file.

Have you actually tried extracting?"
,pt.caesar,2010-03-18T14:28Z,"I did, Robston.

At first, WinRAR said .r00 is damaged and refused to extract.

Then I checked ""saving damaged file (something like that)"" and extracted the .mkv to desktop. When I played the .mkv, it crashed KMPlayer once I shifted to finishing part of the .mkv (Everytimes I download a video file I do that to check the file)."
[T],Robston,2010-03-18T14:46Z,"Ok I see the problem, the file r00 file IS damaged and needs replacing. I've downloaded a copy from another source and the torrent for the replacement file is here

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5442490

Replace the original with this and it should be fine, I hope.  Let me know if the torrent/file doesn't work. Good luck."
,pt.caesar,2010-03-18T16:08Z,"
Thanks a lot, Robston!

I believe it should work, I'll report the result."
