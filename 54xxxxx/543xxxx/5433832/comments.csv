,xtrasauce,2010-03-27T15:32Z,"Guys, support this amazing band and go BUY the album. I saw them in a very small venue recently and you could tell by their technical problems with their crappy equipment and the size of the place that they don't really make money out of this. So go out there and support those geniuses!!!"
