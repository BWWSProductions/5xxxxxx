Kirsten Price, She's Been Living In Her Uptown World!

Claire (Kirsten Price) has it all, stunning looks, glamorous career, upscale lifestyle... and an uptown attitude to go with it. Vinnie (Tommy Gunn) seems to have it all too, but in a very different way. Loyal to his friends, he rarely charges customers for their car repairs, and life is simple but good. When their two worlds collide, Claire must face her true past and with Vinnie's help, might even find true love...
