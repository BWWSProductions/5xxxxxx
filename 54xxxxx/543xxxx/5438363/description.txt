Bob Dylan
Blood On The Tracks
(Half Speed Master)
CBS Mastersound Audiophile Pressing
HC43235 (HAL43235)

I have two copies of this, both purchased at time of release at different London stores. Both have identical
pressing faults at the end of 'Shelter From The Storm' and intermittantly through 'Buckets Of Rain', both
also have some vinyl clicks. I exchanged both for replacement copies and these were the same so I assume
many circulating copies must also suffer from this. The copy transfered here has only been played once
previously.
