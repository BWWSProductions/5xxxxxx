Dynamic HDR photography can be created by taking few photos with different exposures, then combining them in the software into a high dynamic file. The last thing is to tone-map the HDR image so we can see it in our screen, print it, post it on the web and enjoy. We created our software to be very enjoyable, fast and straight forward. No fiddling with incomprehensible parameters. And as it is common for Mediachance products we added many cool new inventions that you may not have seen yet in any other package.
