          PointCloud CAD 2010 is a high performance CAD,           
               Surveying, and Point Cloud system.                  
                                                                   
      Built on the successful MicroSurvey CAD 2010 Premium         
      platform, PointCloud CAD includes the same rendering         
         engine that is used in products like 3DStudio,            
       Solidworks, Pro Engineer, and Microstation. It lets         
      you look at and work with your data in ways you never        
      thought possible. Our rendering capabilities give you        
         the tools you need to analyze, edit, and build            
    compelling surfaces, drawings, and animations with ease.       
                                                                   
                  The PointCloud CAD Advantage                     
                                                                   
       Surveyors all over the world use MicroSurvey CAD to         
       complete their infrastructure and design projects.          
         MicroSurvey has been building software for the            
     surveying industry for over 20 years and with all this        
       experience, we are able to offer the best surveying         
              CAD software package available today.                
                                                                   
         PointCloud CAD is built using the most powerful           
      graphics engine available combined with the Leica pcE        
       point cloud engine. This combination allows for the         
       easy manipulation of millions of points. Our use of         
      DWG files allows for the display and animation of DWG        
              entities directly in the point cloud.                
                                                                   
      MicroSurvey has been developing its desktop software         
     on the IntelliCAD engine for over 4 years. MicroSurvey        
         CAD opens and saves AutoCAD drawing files (V2.5           
        through 2009) and uses DWG as its native format.           
      IntelliCADs command set, toolbar and menu structure         
          is very similar to AutoCAD so you can install            
       MicroSurvey CAD into existing AutoCAD environments          
                           with ease!                              
                                                                   
       We value and listen to our customers and we support         
       what we build. MicroSurveys technical support has          
      been ranked number one by industry professionals and         
      our customer service is world class. MicroSurvey CAD         
      includes over 12 hours of extensive training movies,         
         which equates to reading thousands of pages of            
      manuals. Learning while you work has never been this
