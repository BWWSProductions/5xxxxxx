The greatest adventure of escape ever filmed!

Based on the true story of Henri Charriere, also known as Papillon,

which is French for 'butterfly' (the character even sports a large

tattoo of a butterfly). A petty criminal, Papillon is wrongly convicted

of murder and sentenced to life in a French penal colony in 'Guiane'

(French Guiana, South America). Papillon is determined to escape but

attempt after attempt meets with difficulty, resulting in eventual

recapture. He continues his attempts to escape despite incarcerations

in solitary confinement as punishment.
