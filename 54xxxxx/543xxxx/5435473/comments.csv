,_Metal_Guitar_,2010-03-16T17:47Z,"I pirate shit all the time, but you have to draw the line when you are actually disrupting paying customers. I don't like the DRM, but you guys trying to break it isn't going to change ubis mind. It's only going to prove their point. This shit is pretty fucking sad. If you really want it go out and buy it, like any of you hardly disconect you 'net anyway. And if you didn't keep running these stupid attacks, their servers would be fine. You are all being spoilt little kids, not getting their own way and throwing a tantrum. Congrats."

,Bykram93,2010-03-16T17:50Z,"actually, we are giving crackers a bit time to do what is to be done!!!

and we can buy this game of course... but if this DRM is not stopped... it will be taken in later games... like PoP - The Forgotten Sands... and Splinter Cell - Conviction...

and then other developers take it and implement!!!
well, then POOF!!! evry1 makin crowd in stores, and developers don't hav enough copies to sell out... LOL guyzzz"

Refuse to buy anything made by those companies you disapprove of. And actually bother to write them a calm and articulate letter explaining why they lost your business.

If you want to go to war against this you must see that being a dick and flooding them will only give them the means to have your internet connection cut off. You may even be charged with cyberterrorism or some such BS.

JUST write them and explain that you will never purchase anything from them or any company that does this. And bother to find a company that has a policy that you like to hold as an example for them."

There is no point worrying about what stupid people will do. Just let your actions be your protest. This sort of DDoS has been done before. It almost NEVER works. 

All that is achieved is the silence of those who participate. Do you think that you can not be tracked when you directly ping the server? A ping could not work if you could not be tracked. You will be reported and your ISP will cut you off to avoid being sued for permitting clearly illegal actions.

We have similar goals. Just different means. Make your choice.  My option is more like sniping occasionally over years. I am entirely safe since I am not doing illegal things or taking risks just because I am upset. Your tactic is like charging the enemies stronghold with a knife. Sure you may hit them, but they will slaughter you without any difficulty.

Was this stupid torrent started BY Ubisoft? Get rid of all those who can protest by removing their capacity to communicate? (Your internet connection)"

,hitec1691,2010-03-16T19:02Z,"i found this 

Peer-to-peer attacks

Attackers have found a way to exploit a number of bugs in peer-to-peer servers to initiate DDoS attacks. The most aggressive of these peer-to-peer-DDoS attacks exploits DC++. Peer-to-peer attacks are different from regular botnet-based attacks. With peer-to-peer there is no botnet and the attacker does not have to communicate with the clients it subverts. Instead, the attacker acts as a 'puppet master,' instructing clients of large peer-to-peer file sharing hubs to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and to connect to the victim?s website instead. As a result, several thousand computers may aggressively try to connect to a target website. While a typical web server can handle a few hundred connections/sec before performance begins to degrade, most web servers fail almost instantly under five or six thousand connections/sec. With a moderately big peer-to-peer attack a site could potentially be hit with up to 750,000 connections in a short order. The targeted web server will be plugged up by the incoming connections. While peer-to-peer attacks are easy to identify with signatures, the large number of IP addresses that need to be blocked (often over 250,000 during the course of a big attack) means that this type of attack can overwhelm mitigation defenses. Even if a mitigation device can keep blocking IP addresses, there are other problems to consider. For instance, there is a brief moment where the connection is opened on the server side before the signature itself comes through. Only once the connection is opened to the server can the identifying signature be sent and detected, and the connection torn down. Even tearing down connections takes server resources and can harm the server.

This method of attack can be prevented by specifying in the p2p protocol which ports are allowed or not. If port 80 is not allowed, the possibilities for attack on websites can be very limited."
,OmniNegro,2010-03-16T19:04Z,"@madwiggyNLD
No. I will never buy their garbage even if they removed the DRM. I do not forgive this shit.

Those games are never going to be purchased by me. I previously purchased games from Ubisoft. But never again. And they will receive a written letter explaining this.

Decide what you want to do. I will not resort to stupid things like DDoS and name calling."

You don't seem to understand that YOU are the one who will end games for PC. Ubisoft try to protect their games, which to be honest is fair enough. They own it, they can do what they like with it. If you keep showing them that PC gamers are uncapable of just buying a game and playing it without complaining, they will just stop making them. That would be a very cost effective method of DRM for them wouldn't it. Have you considered any of this? Also I really can't believe how selfish some people are. Their are people that have spent MONEY on this, and they can't play, not becasue of DRM, but beacuse of YOU. Maybe you could think of others before yourself sometimes yeah?

,_Metal_Guitar_,2010-03-17T17:52Z,"@Bykram93. I understand, that this is not fair of ubisoft, but it's not fair of you guys either to stop people that HAVE payed from playing. See my point? You are no longer just attacking a faceless company, but all the people that just want to get home and play a game. And to be honest anyone who has bought a game on PC without knowing what is required in order for it run (the front of the box has it written that an internet connection is required at all times) deserves all the trouble they get. 

Let it be clear, I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS DRM.

That said, I don't support punishing people that have bought the game either. Those few that actually buy games on PC are the only thing that keeps developers making games for PC.

Also, as to this being for people without decent internet...errr...you're in the wrong place I'd guess, seeing as this IS a download site I'd wager nearly everyone on here could play on it fine if they bought it.

Another way to look at it is that if more and more things need fast, stable 'net connections this will push demand for everywhere to have better 'net. 

Whatever though. I just think it's unfair to people who have payed, however, I am just one voice in a sea of voices."
,bLoWsMokE,2010-03-17T18:12Z,"Metalguitar hear me out.

I bought AC2 and I ALSO support these efforts 100%.

Ubisoft HAS to recognize they have made a mistake by doing this.

(BTW I already beat dragon age three times and am downloading metro 2033 right now so no there aren't any other games LOL)

I don't understand what Ubi was thinking when they did this. As a pirate for about two years now I have been anticipating a developer requiring you to be online to play single player although I never expected one to actually be ballsy, or actually dumb enough to do it. What are they accomplishing here? THEY are the ones that made people who buy their games screwed, not the piraters who are trying to counter it.

Seriously what do you think their logic was? Prevent anyone from pirating the game: CHECK!

What does this do for them though? It makes it so that people who were not going to buy the game anyway CONTINUE to not buy the game it makes people who WERE going to buy the game, think twice about buying it, it made the people who would have pirated the game unable to, therefore losing advertising for ubisoft, a HUGE loss of word of mouth and a gain of bad word of mouth, it also caused people to not buy ANY of their games on principle.

If there was NO retaliation at all on this WHO KNOWS maybe they would have started to do this with all their games in which case I would say FUCK Ubi soft for good. I think that a combination of all the things I just said PLUS the hack attacks on their servers will make Ubi think twice about doing this to another one of their games... the only other approach I can think of that Ubi could take after this is to  discontinue making games for the PC.

This DRM they made is BAD FOR BUSINESS and they need that point emphasized to them"
,sgniraic,2010-03-17T18:15Z,"@_Metal_Guitar_: If nobody is able to play, Ubi will be forced to release offline patch. At least that's our goal.

But lets face it, that won't happen because Ubi doesn't care about its customers (go to their forums). ""Take the money and run"" is what Ubi is singing right now.

So yeah, these attacks are only hurting poor suckers that bought the game without getting some knowledge about its protection system."

,sgniraic,2010-03-17T18:22Z,"@bLoWsMokE: This DRM might actually be good for their business, because nobody can buy second hand copy of this game. Anyone that was always buying second hand copies, has to now buy new copy, so that Ubi gets $60 per player and not $60 per copy."

,_Metal_Guitar_,2010-03-17T18:37Z,"I get what you are saying, but the only thing thats going to get Ubisoft, and every other developer to change their mind is if everyone (or at least nearly everyone) stops pirating games on the PC and starts buying them. If people didn't pirate games, they would never use DRM...look at games that didn't use any DRM...Oblivion, or more recently Prince of Persia, they were pirated like fuck. 

Pirates all over say that if their is no DRM they will support the devs and buy the games. They've given us all chances to prove what we say, and we failed spectacularly. So that leaves devs and publishers with one choice, to use ever harsher and unfair methods of DRM.

As it is, Ubisoft will do this for all their games, because until it gets cracked it works. The servers will get bigger and faster over time, the system will be improved and no one will have any trouble connecting.

I'm just saying that stuff like this only hurts us. Like someone said, Ubisoft don't care about it, they want the money. And attacking just reinforces their opinion that the PC market is a hopeless cause. No one wants this. At least I wouldn't have thought anyone wants this to happen.

If you're planning to attack ubis servers, your net must be fairly stable, so go out buy the game, finnish it, then put it out of your mind. It less trouble for everyone all round. And believe me, the more people that buy this and other PC games, the quicker DRM will fade, beacuse it will be unnecessary.

I know that its not you want, but from what I can see its the only real option. You're all trying to prove ubi wrong by boycotting...this is what they expect, prove ubi wrong by buying the game. That will send much bigger shockwaves through the industry than attacking the devs.

Again, no disrespect to anyone, becasue I know you think you are doing the right thing. I just think their is a bigger picture to be observed. Thats all."

Valve don't complain because they sell lots of games, not just their own ones. The developers that sell things on steam DO complain about piracy.

Again, if people didn't pirate games in the first place, consoles wouldn't be the first priority for developers and publishers, games would be released at the same time. As it is they release console games first because its going to give them better proffit margins. 

In short if you want decent games, start buying them and supporting developers.

FUCK THAT. And yes, we will do nothing with these attacks. I stopped long ago. I say, don't buy their games. But that's not going to happen either.

,sgniraic,2010-03-17T20:02Z,"It's not that it's intrusive. FUCK THAT.

DRM forces you to buy new copy of the game. You can't buy or sell used copy (every cd-key gets tied to an account). Meaning: everyone that wants to play = $60 for Ubi.
Many many many people buy used copies, because it's cheaper. But not anymore, because of this new DRM.

Besides, the idea that you have to rely on Ubi's servers to be working to play SINGLE player game is just wrong. But I won't argue with you about that, because you will probably just say something like ""oh, but it's their right!"". Yeah, well go read Animal Farm or 1984 by George Orwell. Ubi's RIGHT to implement this kind of protection system doesn't prove that the system is OK.

I'll just buy cd-key from someone on e-bay.
Fuck Ubi, I'll pay to play their game, but I won't pay THEM. Just because that's what they want from us."
,sgniraic,2010-03-17T20:23Z,"Attacks are pointless. They won't change their minds, DRM is here to stay unless their sales won't be good.

From what I've heard, AC2 isn't in top 10 of the most selling games anymore. And if it doesn't sell well, they have to change their strategy. So there is still some hope.

It's better to stop the attacks, you're only hurting those that payed their money to play the game. Ubi won't do nothing at all until the ""sale wave"" is over.



Vote with you money, don't buy the game."
,_Metal_Guitar_,2010-03-17T20:26Z,"@sgniraic...so you'd argue that it's your right not to pay ubisoft for the time and effort that went into making this game? To see it from ubisofts point of view, a lot of people pirate their games and they've had enough of it. Can you understand that? Would it be ok for me to come over your house and steal all your stuff?

I suspect not. It is their right to protect their products, and the sad fact is, pirates have made DRM necessary. No pirates, no DRM. 

Besides Ubisofts servers are working, except when some pissed of people try and spoil it for everyone else.

And I have said I don't support this DRM, or any DRM for that matter, but I hate even more pirates trying to fuck it up for people that have payed to play it. 

And PC games are cheap enough anyway. Give it a month or two and AC2 will be like £10-15 online."

,sgniraic,2010-03-17T20:54Z,"Look, first of all, pirating isn't stealing. It's using their game without license.

Second, no, this game won't be $15 in a month, are you insane? They will keep selling it at $60 for a long time. It's a trend now, check out 1year old titles and their prices.

Third, if I buy this game, I can't sell it to someone else. The only way to get rid of it is to throw it in trash. Why do they do this? Because the person that would bought it from me counts as a lost sale. Money money money. Get the point?

And last, do you think it's developers idea to implement this kind of protection system? No, it's publishers.
Every game-developing company that publishes their own games doesn't do this, because they want their games to work for sure. And their work is very much appreciated when it works without problems. They know that and that take that as part of the exchange for letting you play their game. That's why games published by developers are cheaper. Of course they care, they spend their time making it, they want us to see how amazing their work is. They don't want some stupid DRM stand in a way of their work.
Now take a look at Ubisoft (publisher), do they care about player's experience? PFFFT, NO! What they care about is money. That's why they ruin your experience by making insane protection systems. Their main goal is money.

If I could buy the game by only giving money to developers, I would do that. Now why would I do that if I could pirate the game? Well, because I'd like them to make more awesome games like AC2 (=support) and also because I could afford the game without thinking about other stuff I need to buy - games would be cheaper if published by developers. But I'm not going to buy a game by a publisher, because by buying it, I'm not only supporting developers, I'm also supporting their insane protection systems and their insane high prices!

It is obvious that you work for Ubisoft so hear this;
All these numbers you see being downloaded do not necessarly translate into sales. In 3rd world countries, they just can't afford full price games, the $ exchange rate is too high 1$= 85 Pakistan Rupees right now. These guys can barely afford a PC,if they don't pirate games, they won't play them at all.So when their condition improves enough to pay for games, they certainly won't be paying for yours no matter how good you say they are. Then there are those in rich countries who try before buying, with this DRM you loose them as potential customers as well. Despite the fact that their previous downloads have translated into money for you. If you won't listen to me then listen to Bill Gates ""Every person pirating Windows is one less switching completely to Lunix"". Also when I do get the money, I WILL pay Ubisoft for the Prince of Persia series(all 4), Splinter Cell Double Agent and Assassin's Creed 1, Far cry and Far Cry 2(which I actually hated but played the first part)."

Here is the truth about the DDOS, it actually happened at 3:00 PM Moscow Time.

Welcome to the Official English DDOS Thread

First and foremost, we apologize for inconvenience to the players who bought the game and now cannot play. Please understand that we would prefer not to impact you negatively if we had the choice. In fact, many of us have a licensed version and also cannot play the game during DDOS. However, Ubisoft designed the DRM in a way that holds their customers hostage. Reasons for that will be explained further. The simple truth is that if we don?t stop this DRM system now, it will become accepted for most PC games by ALL major publishers. For the sake of the future of PC gaming and consumer rights PLEASE TAKE A STAND WITH US.

How Ubisoft DRM works

Surely most of the people reading this are familiar with how it works. If you are, skip ahead...

The Ubisoft DRM is the most restrictive DRM ever implemented in a PC game. Currently, 2 games have it: Assassin?s Creed II and Silent Hunter 5. They are both SINGLE PLAYER games and Assassin?s Creed doesn?t even have a multiplayer component. Nevertheless, both REQUIRE CONSTANT INTERNET CONNECTION. If your connection to the Ubisoft server is interrupted, the game pauses until such time as the connection is resumed (note that the first version of the game quit into main menu). If it is not resumed promptly, you will not able to save your progress. Ubisoft requires you to be online to save the game and saved games are stored on their servers. Although they allowed to store saves offline recently, they are still synced with online saves. If DRM fails during the sync, the save is lost. This caused many gamers to lose 10-20 hours of progress, when Ubisoft wiped their saves during the sync process see: http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/4721051016/m/1641051148 With Ubisoft DRM, you are no longer BUYING the game; - you are RENTING it at full price. Your ability to play a SINGLE PLAYER game is completely dependent on Ubisoft servers (and how protected they are )

What are we trying to achieve

We are trying to get Ubisoft to remove their DRM or at the very least to implement an offline mode. In the bigger scheme of things, we are trying to prevent this form of DRM from taking over the PC gaming market.

Why Ubisoft has done this

People who think that this is about preventing piracy of a specific game are missing the BIGGER PICTURE. Ubisoft is testing a new platform for game delivery (think: Steam). This is NOT about piracy, as much as it is about maximizing revenue. If your game is tied to your online account, you are no longer in possession of the game. The game cannot be resold. It cannot be given as a gift. You cannot buy a game from a different platform (think: Half-Life 2). You cannot lend it to a friend. If you can only play the game while online, Ubisoft is in complete control of how and when you use the game you bought. In the future, it enables them to implement whatever pricing structures they feel like. They can even charge you per save if they want to.

What Ubisoft could have done differently

If Ubisoft had more concern about you ? their customers, they would have implemented fall-back mechanisms. For example, forcing online saving and pausing the game when the connection is lost was unnecessary. IT DOES NOT MAKE THE GAME EASIER TO CRACK. Instead, the game could easily pause at the next checkpoint. However, it was not their objective to create a worthwhile gaming experience. Their objective was to BETA-TEST THE MOST RESTRICTIVE FORM OF DRM POSSIBLE to see how easily users will adopt it. Unfortunately, without this protest, they will be successful.

If Ubisoft wins, you can expect this form of DRM to become standard in the PC gaming industry.

Even developers who do not want to put it into their games will be required to by investors. For the future of PC gaming and consumer rights, WE CANNOT LET IT HAPPEN.

its not about piracy, but these ppl (big publishers) are the big official pirates.. they steal from the general mass of ppl just to gain profit.. richer is getting richer and poorer is getting poorer.. ppl should think of other ppl living in other parts of the world.. example over here in malaysia, if u want to buy pc games, it reaches up to $300, $500 or more.. the windows dvd itself, above $1000.. how do ppl expect to buy at this price? thats why ppl looking for pirate dvd which is much more cheaper.. the pc components such as graphic card from $400, $500, $1800, $10000 or more.. CPU, from $600, $800, $1800, and the latest intel i7 $3800 only for that CPU chipset.. motherboard from $350, $550, $1400, or more.. and also many other items, if this is the price, then how could ppl able to buy original stuff.. for those living in the western, of coz no problem coz everything is cheap and u can even get intel i7 pc within $1000.. perhaps u will say buy game online but here, almost 80% ppl will not use credit card etc.. also, internet itself for the package of 1mbps cost us monthly $120 + 50 for the land line phone and all together $170 monthly just for this internet.. so if this sort of games comes out with DRM thing, its a problem, and where is the Freedom??"
,_Metal_Guitar_,2010-03-18T09:53Z,"Do you not understand that the freedom is being taken away BECAUSE of piracy, no pirates, no DRM. Ubisoft may have other intentions further down the line, if they do, it won't be things like 'paying per save' if they offer their own distro service why does that matter? More competition for Steam means lower prices.

I understand that people can't afford games, I can't afford many...maybe 1 game every 3/4 months, so trying before I buy is important to me also, but you can't pirate everything and buy nothing, that is bound to have an impact in the minds of publishers. And developers, people that think its all the publishers fault are wrong. The developers are all well paid people, they like money just as much as the publishers do. 

I get that you're all really pissed at ubisoft for this, I get that you're all pissed off for the right reasons (I don't agree with not being able to re-sell/lend your game to a friend though, the accounts are free, so just give your login details) but attacking them isn't going to solve anything.

If you'd just left Ubi alone and their servers had gone down and people couldn't play, then the fault would lie soley with Ubisoft, as it is, what you're actually doing is giving them an excuse as to why the service isn't working. Completely unknowingly you've all become the scape goat Ubi was looking for if it all went wrong.

,Snakebearer,2010-03-18T10:55Z,"@_Metal_Guitar_
You're a realist, I give you that. But you're the one not opening your eyes.
You're speaking of extreme capitalism.
With your reasoning a corporation is almost something divine.
Your thesis: Piracy brought DRM, and if the pirates refuse to buy the games, the company stops producing them altogether.
That's unrealistic. Because that assumes you believe that the people are there to serve the companies, and not the other way around.

Let's assume I produce cars. I decide to only sell red ones, but the market demands blues.
According to your thesis, I will continue to sell the red cars until I'm bankrupt - THAT is unrealistic. And stupid of me.
The market is a social construct of supply and demand. Just like any right or obligation. It will exist for as long as we, the general public, want it to.
Just because a company has a fix idea of where they want to be in 5 years, does not mean it physically CAN be, if we, the consumers, don't appreciate what they do.
Ubisoft is a company with a money intrest. If they don't sell, they find another way to get the cash.
Observe: DRM is NOT that atempt. Poking piracy is about forcing Additional customers.
(Not minimizing losses, but to maximize income.)
Like I said, what you're preaching is extreme capitalism = If we don't oblige to the companies' wills, we lose.
With that kind of reasoning, the rich will only get richer, and the poor will only get poorer - and US will eventually rule the world.
Don't get me wrong, this is a philosophical argument. I couldn't care less about what people assume is their rights. I even hate the word ""right"". People only see their rights and never their obligations. Human flaw I guess.
But the same thing is true for companies. It's their obligation to bow down to the rule of supply and demand. To exist for the customer.
That's pretty much where it all ends anyway."
,_Metal_Guitar_,2010-03-18T11:31Z,"@Snakebearer. Again I appreciate your views, and I thank you for your level headed repsonse.

You're evaluation of my mindset was not quite accurate, however.

""Piracy brought DRM, and if the pirates refuse to buy the games, the company stops producing them altogether.""

Yes if demand/sales fall for PC games, comapanies will stop producing them Its happening all ready, did you enjoy playing Gears of War 2 on your PC? According to sales figures (I am aware that these don't include online distros, such as steam) most money is made from the console side of gaming, if there is less and less return for PC games, they will stop making them. 

""Because that assumes you believe that the people are there to serve the companies, and not the other way around.""

Again no, thats not what I believe, I believe companies are there to serve people, however if there are no people to serve (in this case, paying customers) they will stop the service, yes?

And as I've stated, I don't like this DRM, but A -your being unfair to people that paid and can play, and B -you've all unwittingly shifted any blame from ubisoft to yourselves. 

You should have left them to it, bought the game and proved that their system wasn't good enough to handle genuine users. As is though, any weakness that was there, is now, or so ubisoft will claim, your fault. 

The only thing I'm really oppoesed to is these DDOS attacks. They are litteraly helping no one. You're disrupting people and you're damaging your own cause."
,Snakebearer,2010-03-18T11:54Z,"@_Metal_Guitar_ 

You're correct to some degree. But you're still angeling it through a capitalistic perspective.
First off, don't refer to numbers you're not linking. It's impossible to validate or comment on it then. Other than that, you're not denying what I said. If a market is fed up, it can only go down, yes. But if they are hampering their own income, through either DRM or only producing red cars - it's up to them, and not the consumers to do something about it.

You're referring to a hen/egg debate here, and I'm not interested in that. If a company don't have customers, it dies. And if the customers don't have a company producing something - they are not consuming.
Supply and demand. But what you're don't seem to see is that demand comes before supply.
If the marked wants blue cars, and the company produce red ones and refuse to change - they are headed for bankrupcy, and that's not the consumers fault. It's their own for not conforming to the market.

What you're referring to is actually stereotypically called a swedish mentality. Just be silent, and let it run it's course.
If no voices are heard, nothing will change. Society has an obligation to protest when something is heading in the wrong diretion.

Ever heard the term strike breaker? That's pretty much what you're trying to accomplish here. If an organization is treating it's employees unfairly, but over rewarding it's management and a few select floor workers. It could lead to a strike, right? What you're saying now is that we should not strike, because the managment and the few priveliged workers are content with their pay and working conditions.

Remember, we're not discussing piracy, we're discussing DRM, which even you agree to is wrong."
,_Metal_Guitar_,2010-03-18T12:05Z,"@Snakebearer ""If a company don't have customers, it dies."" Yes that is true, but what I'm saying is that the PC games market is small in comparison to the console market. 

Publishers/developers are not making games on the PC and it dosn't matter to them because most of their revenue comes from console sales.

They don't NEED the PC market to thrive.

,Esmad3,2010-03-19T12:27Z,"""What is piracy? Piracy is killing the PC game industry, much in the same way it killed the music industry and the movie industry. Piracy is such a powerful force that it can cause massive damage despite obstacles like ?baseless supposition? and ?lack of evidence?. It?s the Freddy Kreuger of any business: you can?t ever see it because it damages you in your dreams, with the injury magically becoming real -- but then it?s too late. It?s that strong.""

,Bykram93,2010-03-19T14:26Z,"@ Esmad3...

we never mentioned piracy about movies or videos... am totally against it!!! nor musics...

pirates just try to make 'em available to the people at a cheaper price... but I don't support that!!!

becuz I know that no music or movies industry will ever implement a DRM like UBiSoft!! if they do... I'll change my view... and I think it's not possible...

but in case of games, this is totally opposite!! theyimplement DRM, and we look for a crack!!

I, personally suggest games to be bought... I, myself, bought all the PoP series, and Splinter Cell series, all of 'em!!! even AC1...

but, this is NUTS!!!!! X("
,CiumacabraChaChaCha,2010-03-20T00:42Z,it will never be a crack for assassins creed 2 only if ubisoft wants it and they kinda enjoy the profit from this game..razor and others says: if you like a game buy it..this is useless..so screw you guys..i'm gonna buy it
,CiumacabraChaChaCha,2010-03-20T00:45Z,..and i'm gonna play it..and enjoy it..while you are waiting for jesus to come and turn water into wine or something like that..
,Bykram93,2010-03-20T05:43Z,"Then EA did not enforce th DRM to be so restrictive!!! at least EA respects and cares about it's customers... They don't see $$$$$$$$ everytime...

@ CiumacabraChaChaCha... [funny name] xD
You buy the game, play it... enjoy... but we ain't gonna support UBISOFT... you cannot persuade us ANY WAY!!! so, SHUT YOUR MOUTH!!"

,Noriso,2010-03-22T02:43Z,"Im against DRM, but not up for Ddos ubi.com.  Btw, you can just do a simple ping from cmd to see what the ip adress of the server is... (as in start cmd, type ping (www.ubi.com) and get the ip (216.98.48.35).  Please do not attack the forums because the customers of ubi post their rage comments on them."
