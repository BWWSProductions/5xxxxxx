NOTE FOR LOGITECH DUEL ACTION CONTROLLERS ONLY

These profiles are for Project 64, Nestopia, Stella, and ZNES and are to be used with Logitech duel analog controllers (corded or cordless). These profiles are easy to create once you catch on but I know of a few people who have bought these controllers and realized they have no idea how to set them up so I hope this helps some of you out.
Please note to use these you will need to install version 5.08 of the 
Logitech which can be found here:

just select download then select your operating system and scroll to the bottom of the screen (sometimes the download start bar just looks like a blue bar)
