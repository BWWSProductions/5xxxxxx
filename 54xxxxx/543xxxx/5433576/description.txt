Secret.Service.In.Harm's.Way.PC.Game(djDEVASTATEâ„¢)


A budget first person shooter incorporating some tactical elements. A first person shooter where you play as a bodyguard to various political bigwigs. Aside from keeping yourself alive, you also can't let your charge be killed. I believe it uses the Quake 2 engine, though it has been modified. You can shoot out lights and shoot through walls and doors. Also, the game uses rag-doll physics. When enemies are shot, they slump against walls, fall out of windows, etc. rather than following pre-scripted animation.
