,felcher,2010-03-15T14:44Z,"This puppy is going to get deleted from my machine as soon as the one above downloads and proves clean, looks like it is the same release after all."
,felcher,2010-03-15T16:54Z,"That's it, deleted torrent and data get this one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5241543/Windows__7_Complete_Retail_Edition_32_Bit__amp__64_Bit_Pre-Activate"

,chris1523,2010-05-09T22:44Z,anyone?
,cmonsterf50,2010-05-16T01:54Z,"Dear chris1523,

I've installed this copy twice now, once as Ultimate x86 and again as Home Basic x86 with no issues. I am currently backing up another PC for the attempt of installing Ultimate x64. Are you trying to install x86 (32bit) or x64 (64bit)? Are you installing updates at time of install?"
,cmonsterf50,2010-05-17T07:01Z,"Update:

I installed x64 Ultimate this afternoon. The install went fine. However after about an hour I got a Windows Validation prompt. So far I've disregarded it and haven't seen it again. I'll update if I do. Additionally have 2 other computers running x86 Home Basic from this download, no issues so far."
,Cody1233,2010-06-11T15:57Z,Is this an actual working version?  It sounds as if there's a lot of stuff for 4gb
,charis_r,2010-06-23T15:50Z,"HEEELPPP ! ! !! 
I downloaded and intalled the torrent about a month ago. Everything looked to work just fine so far. But today, after my windows ran the windows update... all of a sudden the following message appeared : "" windows 7 Build 7600. This copy of Windows is not genuine""
And it tells me to activate it online and that all the optional updated are disabled and this message above keeps appearing on the botton right of my screen on my desktop. Help what can i do????"
,Cody1233,2010-06-30T03:09Z,"i'd say you cant update this, cuz microsofts getting smarter...im not gonna anyway, otherwise, this works good"
