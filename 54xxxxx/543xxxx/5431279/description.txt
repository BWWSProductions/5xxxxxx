And i have included for activation:

RemoveWAT 2.1: little tool I put together to remove WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) completely from the OS, whilst still retaining genuine status and

receiving all updates (optional aswell). You can also pass the genuine check in things like Windows Defender.

There will be no windows activation section in control panel (thanks to nononsence)

no slmgr

no nags, no prompts, nothing. WAT gone.

How to:
