Excerpt From Chapter VI

A science or any scientist that unquestioningly follows the Gregorian calendar is, in reality, not worthy of the name. What is science? A concern for logic and precision of measure, we might answer, as well as standards of measure which utilize uniform units of measure in accord with what is being measured. Yes, the year is calculated as being 365.241299 days in length, but if the annual standard of measure that is used is irregular and unscientific, then it avails nothing, and indeed deforms the mind leading it down byways that may only end in self-destruction. Thus, the pursuit of a true and accurate year in itself may be an illusory pursuit, blinding us to the actual nature of time, and leading us away from a genuine understanding of ourselves, and our role and purpose on this Earth.

To change and replace the calendar with the thirteen moon standard is to return us to our original purpose, leading us back to pathways of harmony and natural health. According to the Law of Time, the damage already inflicted in the time humanity last hesitated and lost the chance to alter its timing frequency, 40 years ago, has been incalculable. The final opportunity to change the calendar and the timing frequency is now upon us. Because of this we must be very clear and unshakable in our understanding and determination to expose and eliminate the current civil calendar for once and for all. Even apologist David Duncan's unabashedly pro-Gregorian book Calendar (1999) concludes with its time line on the date 2012, "Current Mayan Great Cycle will end."11 But will we also end? By 2012, it will be too late to change. We must begin to change now.

In reviewing the quirks and twists of history that constitute the Gregorian calendar, we must ask: why do we continue to use such an instrument, and what are its effects? Is a calendar something more than a tool for scheduling the payment of debts (calends), or is it an instrument of synchronization? The harmony or disharmony of time is a profound matter rooted in the instrument of time reckoning that we use. There can be little question that we live more in a time of chaos than of harmony. We may also say in regard to the effect of standards of measure on the mind, that the chaos of the time is embedded in the calendar we use. If we are to leave this time of chaos and enter a time of harmony, then we must exchange the instrument in which the chaos is embedded for an instrument that is the very model of harmony-the Thirteen Moon/28-day count. This is the choice humankind must now make.

The issue of the nature of time, or of the times in which we are living, cannot be separated from the issue of the calendar. The very nature of the calendar that the world follows has stunted the mind and warped the body's innate timing sensibility, reducing the understanding of time to being merely a matter of chronology. "Chronology is a register or reckoning of successive years, a time scale. It may also be described as a system of registering time massively."12 Virtually all time reckoning has proceeded from astronomical indicators, the major exception being the Maya, who actuated from a solely mathematical outlook. Yet, with this mathematical outlook, the Maya devised a chronological method that has never been surpassed, a fact attested to by many, including the architects of the Kitt Peak Observatory, Tucson, Arizona, where a mosaic mural depicting the civilization of the Maya asserts the superiority of their calendar over that of the Europeans.

It is significant that the earlier calendar reform movement, while occasionally acknowledging the brilliance of the Maya, made no use of the Mayan knowledge. But this was because the time sensibility was restricted to thinking of time solely in terms of chronology, or at best as a schedule for keeping good accounts, with little comprehension at all of the synchronic nature or order of time. And since the system of chronology was synonymous with the system of control embedded in the Gregorian calendar system, the earlier reform movement failed altogether to make any impact on the Vatican, much less on the global power structure itself.

All of the thought, action, and good intention put into the years of calendar reform notwithstanding, the Gregorian calendar prevailed, and tragically, not one of the proposals or recommendations was ever even considered for adoption by the papal authorities who maintain control over the calendar. In the 1930s, the propaganda of the Church was aimed at limiting any possibility of reform, for it would not give up the succession of the seven day week. In any perpetual calendar, such as the Thirteen Moon/28-day calendar, the observance of the Day Out of Time is necessary for maintaining the harmony of the 52 weeks which completes itself in 364 days. The continuous succession of the week does not stand in a constant relation with the other elements of the calendar and is one of the main causes of confusion in the Gregorian calendar. Arguing that such a break as a Day Out of Time, no day of the week at all, would plunge the world more deeply into chaos, barbarism and war, the Vatican effectively blocked all effort at reform. The completion of the century of total war, capped by the Inevitable Event, roundly refutes this point. It may just as easily be argued that because we did not change the calendar, we are now plunged into the final barbarism and unholy war.
