PLOT

Two friends [Madhavan and Sharman Joshi] embark on a quest for a 
lost buddy. On this journey, they encounter a long forgotten bet, 
a wedding they must crash, and a funeral that goes impossibly out 
of control. As they make their way through the perilous landscape, 
another journey begins: their inner journey through memory lane and 
the story of their friend--the irrepressible free-thinker Rancho [Aamir Khan], 
who in his unique way, touched and changed their lives. Its a story of 
their college days that swings between Ranchos romance with the spirited Pia 
[Kareena Kapoor], and his clash with an oppressive mentor, Viru Sahastrabudhhe 
[Boman Irani]. And then one day, suddenly, Rancho vanished. Who was he? Where
did he come from? Why did he leave? The friend who influenced and inspired 
them to think creatively and independently, even as the conformist world called 
them three idiots. Where is the original idiot now? Finally, in misty mountains 
of unparalleled beauty, the friends find the key to the secret. Loosely based on 
the Chetan Bhagat best seller "Five Point Someone", Three Idiots is a comedy of 
ideas that is as provocative as it is funny, as wildly entertaining as it is 
insightful.Three idiots dares to challenge the monotonous stream of education 
persisting in India without going too much into a social propaganda but the tone 
in which it delivers is light. A laugh-riot that talks about the most important 
of human pursuits: self-actualization
