2069: A Sex Odyssey pits a rural West German township nestled in the bosom of the Alps against a saucer full of Venusian astronauts. These lithe ladies clad in slinky silver have an important mission: to collect spermatozoa to keep Venus in new babies for 10,000 years. The aliens are unaware of Earth customs, and thus fall prey to the lamest of advances. It hardly matters: the ladies are here for the seed anyway.
