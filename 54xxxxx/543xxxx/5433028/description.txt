In the beginning, some were against us
But we proved them wrong, and made them envious
		
Then all the talkin', all the squawkin',
Some tried to steal the Fame, but keep Skyy-walkin'

Steppin' together, movin' as one
sure NOT for the money... but for the Fuuun.

Being explicit straight to the freak
Not forgettin' the roots to an up-tempo beat
