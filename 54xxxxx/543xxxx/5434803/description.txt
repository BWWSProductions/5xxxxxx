Welcome to the whimsical world of Sitting Ducks, where life is good, food's a plenty, and alligators are lurking in neighbouring Swampwood. One bird stands out amongst the flock â€“ Bill. Well-liked, but seldom understood, Bill waddles to a different beat. He is a quirky, smaller than average duck with a big imagination and a secret fun loving side. Billâ€™s best friend is Aldo, from the neighbouring town of Swampwood. A big lumbering bull-in-a-china-shop alligator, chock-full of rough edges. Aldo is also a tough guy with a soft centre. This unlikely friendship between these two creatures on opposite ends of the food chain sets the scene for unique challenges... and a lot of fun.
