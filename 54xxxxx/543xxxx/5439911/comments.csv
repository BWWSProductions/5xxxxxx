You have to Mount the Game file so it thinks its in your CD Drive"
,Worlds.Finest.,2010-05-03T16:50Z,"Actually^^ i take that back, i cant mount the right file either."
,Worlds.Finest.,2010-05-03T17:06Z,"What your gonna do is, go to where you Installed the game...Default ->
""C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas""

 Open it. That good, Now Go to the Drive you used to Mount whit Daemon tool's, Should be F:.

 Explore it, you should see HOODLUM, Open it. Now there should be gta_sa, Copy that.

 And Paste it in your Install Folder, the folder you installed GTA SA, and Paste it.

Create a shortcut to that file, it works :]"
,josh5361,2010-05-12T00:53Z,Is this the 1st or 2nd edition?
,Scavenger1997,2010-05-19T02:00Z,"Guys you know why it asks for a CD?
well i dun actually know lol but what i know is that you need to download the crack copy and replace it with the real gta_sa.exe

but first backup folders because im not responsible for any thing that happens"
,yjui,2010-05-21T03:05Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD

AVG anti-virus has detected a Trojan in the HOODLUM folder"

,Naw3x,2010-08-30T00:02Z,"Look, this is not hard you guys.

Just explore the dvd, and you will see a map named hoodlum, in there is the crack for the game, all you have to do is copy paste it in the game folder probably like ""C:\Program\Rockstar Games\San Andreas"" or something like that, and you will get no errors saying ""insert disc""."
,HamBurger1112,2010-10-13T18:25Z,"lol bunch of noobs dont how to get the game to work .

mount it , go to ""my computer"" and there should be a CD called GTA.SanANDREAS right click it , explore there should be a crackfolder called hoodlum open it, copy the track into the download folder you downloaded san andreas in and then it should work perfect !"
