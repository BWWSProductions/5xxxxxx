They targeted civilians firing over 3000 rockets and mortars and israeli civilians over a few months.Its rather rich of any palestinian apologist to complain about civilian casualties after such displays of barbarity. Its the equivalent of 30,000 rockets being fired at the uk, or 150,000 at the US.  you can imagine their response to that kind of situation would not be so restrained.

of course the children will be angry, i'm sure children in nazi germany were angry after the allies bombed their country.  but the root of the issue was the murderous behavior of their leaders.  i wouldn't expect much from children steeped in anti israeli propaganda, just as nazi youth were brainwashed and readily became martyres in the closing days of the war, such things cannot be avoided, the blame lies on their leaders, and the brainwashers.  the apologists like you that just enable them should be ashamed."

Compared to a multi-billion dollar funded and American and British backed IDF who ignore more UN resolutions than Saddam Hussein and breach all international agreements on production of nuke related materials.

Get a grip on reality.

Armchair critics.... and Zionist sympathisers... all the same."

ah yes like those efficient home-contructed roadside bombs that are killing american troops as we speak?

don't even try to pretend they are not deadly.  and yes, the palestinians use IEDs as well, sometimes rigging entire homes to explode.  Its why so many israeli troops die at the hands of these ""innocent and defenseless"" palestinians.

there is a completely different mind set going on here.  The palestinians aim to murder the maximum they can possible manage. the IDF  never does this, in fact they send in men on the ground when possible and put jewish blood at risk to lower civilian casualties. This is never a courtesy granted to to the israelis by hamas.  If the israelis were really like the palestinians they'd simply bomb them endlessly from the air and never endanger a hair on their own heads."
