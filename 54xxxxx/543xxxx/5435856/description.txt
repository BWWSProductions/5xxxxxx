Dispatches -  Children of Gaza
==============================
UK Channel 4 TV -  March 2010


Description
===========
None needed. We don't really need more images of testimony of what the Zionist belief system and IDF killers are doing these days -  but this focuses on how the events  hit children and thus should be watched and passed on to any doubting friends and family.

Off-Topic Note:
==============
The reason many of us support the formal acknowledgement of UFOs and Extra-terrestrial life by power structures and at grass roots level isn't just for the reasons most ppl assume.

Once you've examined geopolitics-  particularly the complex 'deep' politics of the likes of Peter Dale SCott -  which suggests that there is now no difference between state, government, civil institutions and major trans-national criminal networks -  you come to realise that NOTHING is going to interrupt this system.
Wave all the placards you want -  it won't work.
What *may* cause a significant enough global reality "neuro-shock" is the arrival of legitimate [forget that BlueBeam cliche for once NWO addicts] and huge ET ships over many capital cities of the world at the same time.
At that point ALL current power structures cease to be just that...
Whilst this may seem a deluded dream to some -  i suggest finding two hours to listen to this interview or the Project Camelot one.
