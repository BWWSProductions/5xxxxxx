SYNOPSIS:
This wicked adaptation of the Octave Mirbeau novel is classic Luis BuÃ±uel. Jeanne Moreau is Celestine, a beautiful Parisian domestic who, upon arrival at her new job at an estate in provincial 1930s France, entrenches herself in sexual hypocrisy and scandal with her philandering employer (BuÃ±uel regular Michel Piccoli). Filmed in luxurious black-and-white Franscope, Diary of a Chambermaid is a raw-edged tangle of fetishism and murderâ€”and a scathing look at the burgeoning French fascism of the era.
