CHILL BRAZIL 2 

CDRIP FROM THE ORIGINAL CDS PERFECT SOUND QUALITY 320KBPS

This is a continuous in-the-mix CD compiled and mixed by Marcus Vinicius.

A collection of "38 sexy soul bossa tracks," Chill: Brazil, Vol. 2 benefits from being compiled by Brazilian singer/songwriter Joyce. It's a bit more up and down than you'd expect from an album with "chill" on the cover, but things never get too chaotic. Joyce focuses on the more organic with a few modern-day electronic artists snuck in (ZUCO 103, In Soul). Marcus Vinicius does the "soft-mixing" and his sense of pace in near perfect (light and acoustic bossa nova to start the discs, trippy electronica to finish them). The only speed bump is a complex Hermeto Pascoal number, which is great, but it may lead some to question how "chill" it is. Those looking for a little unwinding with music that isn't vapid and has that slinky Brazilian flavor should be very pleased.


A collection of sexy, steamy soul bossa tracks with the sounds of Brazil. With some of the most-recognizable names, not to mention many of the others present from the many wonders of Brazilian music, this is the perfect compilation to chill out to.


ENJOY!
