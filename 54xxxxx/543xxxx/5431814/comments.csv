,BlackRain604,2010-03-13T21:27Z,its not fake.. looks to be the same cam going around alrdy. A3/V3
,donki,2010-03-13T21:45Z,"I agree with the person above.

Seems all the releases are from the same source media which is sadly of very poor quality.

I think the cameraman must have been pissed or stoned when he took it.

Appreciate the effort however."

,baba73,2010-03-15T00:36Z,Appreciate the effort m8 but these so called ppl that say FAKE get a fuckin life ya mong ffs 
,wraymogg,2010-03-18T18:52Z,"I presume all the ppl that are saying this is a good torrent do so just to trick ppl into thinking there is a missunderstanding and they still might check if is a good torrent or not.

Let me enlighten you about his torrent without spamming 100 of FAKE.

Yes, IT IS FAKE, it contains an small movie data to trick into thinking that all the file is THE movie, but is not. Is a trick commercial, and the rest of the file meaning 700mb is full of the word PADDING. So it is a FAKE movie. Don't be as isiot as me to question the 1000 FAKE words :)"
