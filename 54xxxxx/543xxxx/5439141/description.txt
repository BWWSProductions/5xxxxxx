What could be more fun than a high-stakes video game version of the world's most popular sport? Well, make the players and settings out of LEGO pieces and things start to get kind of interesting. Assemble your squad from groups of Martians, pirates, cowboys, and other LEGO favorites, and choose the story-based Adventure mode or the soccer-intensive LEGO World Cup mode. There are 23 themed stadiums to compete in, and up to four players can get in on the action. Hey, where else are you going to find firefighters playing soccer in the Wild West?
