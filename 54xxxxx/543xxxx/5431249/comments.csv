,BenDaley,2010-03-17T04:10Z,Hoges was the subject of some 'remember when?' pub banter last night - so stoked to find this here today! Will come back when d/load complete. Cheers
,Vulturama,2010-03-24T10:10Z,"Psychodad you're a legend! I've been searching fortnightly for this for about three years - and suddenly it's here. Can't wait to see Strop, Delvene, and of course the man himself - it's been quarter of a century... Is this from a recently released DVD collection or something? Or converted ancient VHS? However you did it you've done an old Aussie a big favour. Cheers!"
,Vulturama,2010-03-24T10:26Z,Sorry - ignore my question. I see it's from DVD's. Thanks again!

,boring123,2011-03-13T04:13Z,""" Although the Crocodile Dundee films were instant hits in the US, The Paul Hogan Show never made a lasting impression on the American viewer. ""

Every American I know whose seen the show loves it. They just never showed it on US tv while Benny Hill was on nightly."

Thanks for this!"
,dmkartist,2011-08-12T05:55Z,"A thousand thanks to Psychodad149. I've been searching for this for years!! I remeber watching this as a kid, I think it was aired on PBS for one season in the early eighties. BEST POST EVER!"
,dogfood123,2011-10-08T04:20Z,This show was on a station in Idaho in the early 80's when no one else ever heard of Hoges.  Many thanks for putting this up.  Will seed for a long time!
