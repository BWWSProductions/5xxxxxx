Most of the hackintosh installers would prefer that format. "
,poon!!,2010-03-13T13:08Z,"I mean they prefer the iso format, it could be misunderstood what I meant."

It's not as easy as to rename the dmg to iso to be able to burn it on a windows machine, why do you think there are software like magicISO to convert dmg to iso format? 
You should also check your keyboard, it seems that some of the keys get stuck ;-) "
,untrueparadox,2010-03-30T08:05Z,"theres another one out there by hotiso thats in iso format. and no, you cannot rename and burn. dmg is compressed, iso is not. you gotta use winiso to burn dmg in windows."
