Plot: In Werner Herzogâ€™s new film â€œBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans,â€ Nicolas Cage plays a rogue detective who is as devoted to his job as he is at scoring drugs â€” while playing fast and loose with the law. He wields his badge as often as he wields his gun in order to get his way. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina he becomes a high-functioning addict who is a deeply intuitive, fearless detective reigning over the beautiful ruins of New Orleans with authority and abandon.
