PLOT

It's the 21st century, but the gods of Mount Olympus and assorted 
monsters have walked out of the pages of high school student Percy Jackson's 
Greek mythology texts and into his life. And they're not happy: Zeus' lightning 
bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect. Even more troubling is 
the sudden disappearance of Percy's mother. As Percy finds himself caught 
between angry and battling gods, he and his friends embark on a cross-country 
adventure to catch the true lightning thief, save Percy's mom, and unravel a 
mystery more powerful than the gods themselves.
