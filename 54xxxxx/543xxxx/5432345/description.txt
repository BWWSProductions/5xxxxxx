
Kazantzidis was born in Nea Ionia, in Athens, Greece. He was the first of two brothers born to Haralambos Kazantzidis (of Pontian roots from Ordu) and Gesthimani Kazantzidis, who moved from what is now Western Turkey to Greece during the Greco-Turkish War. Kazantzidis derives from Turkish word KazancÄ±. Kazan means a cauldron in Turkish and -cÄ± is an agent suffix similar to "-er" in English. Thus, KazancÄ± means someone who produces, repairs, and/or sells cauldron.
He was orphaned at the age of 13 when his father, a member of the Greek Resistance, was tortured to death by the rightists. This forced Kazantzidis into employment, working as a baggage-carrier at Omonia Square and then for an interstate bus company, as a seller of roasted chestnuts at open markets, and as a labourer at the Nea Ionia textile mills.
His life changed when the owner of a factory, which was located in the Perissos working district, gave him a guitar. He spent long hours playing music.
He made his first public appearance at a Kifissia night club in the early 1950s and soon after, in July 1952, made his first studio recording at Columbia studios with a song entitled "I'm going for a swim" (Î“Î¹Î± Î¼Ï€Î¬Î½Î¹Î¿ Ï€Î¬Ï‰), written by Apostolos Kaldaras. It did not do well but he tried again, recording Gianni Papaioannou's "The suitcases" (ÎŸÎ¹ Î²Î±Î»Î¯Ï„ÏƒÎµÏ‚) soon after. The song became the first of many hits and with his newfound popularity he began to make appearances in some of the biggest clubs of the time, like "Theios", "Mpertzeletos" and "Rosignol".
With his career in full swing, Kazantzidis began to collaborate with some of the biggest names in Greek music, among them Vassilis Tsitsanis, Manos Hadjidakis, Mikis Theodorakis, Stavros Xarhakos and Manolis Chiotis. He and Marinella became a legendary duo.
In Israel, he was a musical icon. Many of his songs were translated into Hebrew and performed by the country's leading singers. Yaron Enosh, an Israel Radio broadcaster who often plays Greek music on his programs, described the singer's ability to combine joy with sorrow: "This is the task of music: to touch the entire range of feelings...Kazantzidis could do this; he played on all the strings." To the Greek Jews who immigrated to Israel, Kazantzidis was "the voice of the world they left behind, for good or for bad." According to the operator of Radio Agapi, a station that plays Greek music 24 hours a day, "Kazantzidis was the voice of the people, of the weary, the exploited, the betrayed. And the voice of the refugee and the emigre, too." 
Kazantzidis also sang in Turkish.
Kazantzidis died of a brain tumor on September 14, 2001. His death was an emotional event for Greece, as attested to by the many obituaries in appreciation of his life and work. Kazantzidis was given a national funeral through the streets of Athens which was broadcast live on Greek television. His music was also beloved by Greek immigrants all over the world, capturing their feelings in the difficult post-war period.
