,Chaoswing,2010-05-16T04:34Z,"I keep getting a broken file error for the setup.exe

This happens whether or not  it has been unzipped, and has the same error when I try to un-rar it.

Anyone else have this issue/ know how to fix it?"

,Chaoswing,2010-05-17T00:12Z,Yay it worked. Thanks.

there six .zip files like  f4made01.zip inside those are three files, 2 useless and one like f4cg.r00. you need to take the f4cg. from each f4made and put them all in the same place and extract them to get the setup file"
