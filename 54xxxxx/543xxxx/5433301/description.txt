Marcelo D2 (born Marcelo Maldonado Peixoto, November 5, 1967, in Rio De Janeiro) is a Brazilian rapper.

A former vocalist of the band Planet Hemp, he started his solo career in 1998 with the album Eu Tiro Ã‰ Onda. The album was recorded in his studio by David Corcos, and was mixed in New York and Los Angeles by Carlos Bass and MÃ¡rio Caldato Jr. Eu Tiro Ã‰ Onda was well accepted by the public and rap movement within SÃ£o Paulo, earning respect from names such as Black Alien, ZÃ© Gonzalez, Dj nuts and BnegÃ£o.
Marcelo returned to Rio de Janeiro with a pregnant girlfriend who gave birth to his son Luca. He found renewed success after restarting his solo career with the participation of the Hemp Family, a group formed by the pioneers of rap in Rio de Janeiro.
In 2003 he released Ã€ Procura da Batida Perfeita (Portuguese for "Looking for the perfect beat", a reference to an Afrika Bambaataa song of the same name) produced by Beastie Boys producer Mario Caldato. The album mixed hip-hop with samba, and included a collaboration with will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas. The album was a hit, and led to an AcÃºstico MTV performance, analogous to MTV Unplugged in the United States. The album was released with the English title in Asia, Europe, and North America. Finally, the album was promoted with a two-year tour.
Marcelo D2 appeared as a guest performer on two tracks of Sergio Mendes' album Timeless.
His third album Meu Samba Ã‰ Assim ("My Samba Is Like This") was released May 8, 2006. It features Chali 2na of Jurassic 5 on the track "That's What I Got".
