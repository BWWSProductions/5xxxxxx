,aliendydo,2010-03-16T18:11Z,"Ben ik al mee bezig :)

,RMJ13,2010-03-17T05:30Z,"RULE #1  never use steam VERSION! 

 get the RETAIL version  both SKIDROW and RAZOR are ""RETAIL""  version and  are installable and razor CRACK works with both! "
,RMJ13,2010-03-17T05:33Z,"I have the SKidrow version  got it last night!  had to wait for RAZOR1911 CRACK to play game! 

 oh yes RAZOR 1911 to the rescue again! "
,XshareFileX,2010-03-17T13:43Z,HELP THE PEOPLE WHO DOWNLOAD THE STEAM COPY. UPLOAD setup.dat AND THE RAZOR INSTALLER. BE BROS.
,Deathstryker,2010-03-17T22:52Z,"@ RMJ13

You are stupid. The retail version requires steam, therefore the version you download and the version you buy at retail are one and the same."
,superj1977,2010-03-18T01:06Z,"@Deathstryker

The version you download and the version you buy at retail are not the same at all."
,Deathstryker,2010-03-18T02:21Z,"@ superj1977

The installation method is different but the content afterwards is not."
,iwilleatu,2010-03-20T14:06Z,"question?, when i dl a game uaually i use the crack provided but, i've never used a diff crack, do i still need to drop the skidrow exe. with the razor crack? or just the razor? thanks in advance"

,prmayner,2010-12-08T13:49Z,i'm using win7 64 and both patches crash for me. it doesn't ask me for a any kind of file.
,prmayner,2010-12-08T14:16Z,"sorry it does work, had to remove skidrow's patch then everything fine."
,lju,2011-11-27T01:17Z,"dudes, just a hint.

I got over the ""windows won't run the executable file"" whatever.. problem.
Just install Physx.

I have an ATI so it made no sense to me, but I figured what the hell. 
And voila.

And the net is full with ""there's no solution to that problem"" BS.

Don't overthink it. Give it a shot."
,gentlemanrogue012,2012-01-16T16:35Z,"i've downloaded the game and this crack both from razor, and now im getting an application load error 5:0000065434 message, any help please?"
