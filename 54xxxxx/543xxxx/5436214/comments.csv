,EndFED,2010-04-10T16:53Z,"My computer is AMD Athlon 6000+, 3GB ram, nvidia 9600GT 512MB on Windows 7 ultimate 32bit ( x86) 

Install the game using a virtual DVD ( I use powerIso) then go to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4289444/Chronicles_of_Riddick__escape_from_butcher_bay_Patch_and_Crack patch it and then to use the crack = go to C:\Program Files\Starbreeze Studios\Riddick EFBB and backup the system folder (copy and paste) then go to vitality crack and copy and paste all Win32_x86 folders in the system folder to the other. Windows 7 or Vista will ask if you want to merge files you say yes.
*XP you will have to manually go inside all Win32_x86 folders and exchange the SbzEngine files.

Then you double click to run the game. It is possible that it refuse to start. Just double click again and this time it should work as it work for me."
