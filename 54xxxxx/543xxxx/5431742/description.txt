When the single middle-aged Luis (JosÃ© Luis LÃ³pez VÃ¡zquez) travels from Barcelona to bury the remains of his mother in the vault of his family in Segovia, he is lodged by his aunt Pilar (Lola Cardona) in her old house where he spent his summer of 1936 with her. He meets his cousin Angelica, who was his first love, living on the first floor with her husband and daughter, and he recalls his childhood in times of the Spanish Civil War entwined with the present.

This sensitive movie is a touching love story having the background of the beginning of the Spanish Civil War with the coup d'Ã‰tat of General Francisco Franco in July 1936. The original resource of Carlos Saura, using the same actor (JosÃ© Luis LÃ³pez VÃ¡zquez) representing the boy and the man, is awesome. The forbidden love for his cousin, the dogmatic education of the Catholic Church, the relationship with his family are revived by Luis in this simple and unknown gem. 

Spain, though, is the real subject of the film, and at the time it was released there â€” 1974 â€” "Cousin AngÃ©lica" caused quite a stir with its references to the war, Spanish Catholicism and the possible nobility of at least some members of the Republican cause. Even if it's difficult for someone not familiar with the subtleties of Spanish life to get all of these references, the movie is extraordinarily compelling, an invitation into a world until recently closed, but whose vitality has remained undiminished.
