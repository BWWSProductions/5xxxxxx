Hitman Blood Money (1.2 RETAIL DVD UNTOUCHED, RUNS WITHOUT DISK IN DRIVE)

Hitman: Blood Money sees the return of the world's deadliest assassin and takes killing for money to a whole new level.
Agent 47 is back and this time he's paid in cold, hard cash. How the money is spent will affect his passage through the game and the weapons at his disposal, resulting in a unique gameplay experience for each player. Powered by a new version of IO-Interactive's stunning Glacier engine, Hitman: Blood Money will deliver the most brutal and realistic simulation of the life of a merciless assassin.
In Hitman: Blood Money, Agent 47 finds himself in the midst of a war between two rival contract agencies. When assassins from his contract agency, the ICA, are systematically eliminated in a series of hits, it seems a larger, more powerful agency has entered the fray. Suddenly, Agent 47 loses contact with the ICA. Sensing that he may be the next target, he travels to America where he prepares to make a killing!

I bought this from Amazon.  It came with patch 1.2 preinstalled and doesn't require the disk be inserted in order to play, so it is no-cd by retail, WOW!
