,Rastamanse,2010-10-13T21:39Z,"Remember to download DirextX if you get dll errors but you also really need it to play! it's needed for newer games like this!  If you have 256 mgb Nvidia or RADEON and over 3.2 Ghz Intel or AMD it Can Not Work! But best way is having 512Mgb with 3.6 Ghz processor then it wont lagg with best perf settings!

,xGroWleR--,2011-08-16T19:51Z,Always when I finish a mission the game crashes to desktop when loading newspaper or the newspaper doesn't show and it freezes. If I ALT + TAB when loading and then switch back to Hitman Blood Money the newspaper works. But I can't use always ALT + TAB. How to fix this? I have Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bits.

,suprimat,2011-10-05T19:39Z,the game may crash on some video cards. on ATI u may encounter many problems. u need to apply the last game patch to end those problems.
,Xero3,2011-10-10T21:36Z,"Its works! 

The only problem I have is that the load in between levels take FOREVER. I mean, around 6-10 minutes. This may be the fault of my computer. 

This is a small complaint though, considering the game works wonderfully after it loads. "

,RustyMcclintock,2012-04-28T00:14Z,"---WARNING POSSIBLE TROJAN---

Began downloading this and suddenly Avast started shitting bricks. notifying me that Every single HTM file associated with Vuze was being modified and was a trojan. Usually avast doesn't freak out nearly this bad with false positives but this was a bit different. Never had something like this happen. Ended vuze process and the files quit being modified. Scanning now and I'm not sure yet, just a heads up."
,vlad_ivx,2012-05-03T23:14Z,"100% ok, thanks"
,Dude32111,2012-05-07T07:05Z,"@TORCUTT Your OS has nothing to do with your ability to run games. It depends on your processor, ram, hard drive, and sometimes your graphics card. The only issue you would have with an OS is compatability. We have the same one so I can say that it works."
,vlad_ivx,2012-05-14T01:57Z,just perfect. thank you
,kmjansen83,2012-05-20T21:56Z,"@Dude32111 : ur comment backfired on u, u say OS isnt the problem to run games, but at the end u say the compatability is, so it is a OS problem, as games can only run on platforms they are created for, if a pc has the latest tech but runs W98 u wont run anything of this gen games, so if u have a wrong OS u cant even run the game, i have Windows 8 preview running but i fail at every game test because of that"
,usernameavailable,2012-06-08T08:35Z,CRASHES EVERYTIME I TRY TO RUN IT! HOW DO I FIX THAT??!
