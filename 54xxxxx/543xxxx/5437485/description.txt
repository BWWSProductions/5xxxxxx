The end isn't near... it's here!

America has become a wasteland, leaving the few cities that remain transformed into impenetrable fortresses. Beyond these walls lies The Zone, a brutal, plague-ravaged landscape stretching from one city to the next, populated by mutants, monsters, and warring factions of survivors driven insane by disease and starvation. Only the very brave or the very foolish voluntarily step foot outside the protective confines of the mega-cities. Nick Masters just happens to be a little bit of both. Nick's a driver, the best there is. If you need something picked-up, delivered, or disposed of, Nick's your man. And he's all business. But when he fails to deliver an important package to a local crime lord, Nick's business suddenly becomes very personal.
