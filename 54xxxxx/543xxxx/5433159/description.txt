Release notes:

'Head First' is the fifth studio album from British electronic group Goldfrapp.
Having wandered into the realms of pagan folk for their highly-acclaimed 2008
release 'Seventh Tree', the band have once again drawn from the synthpop style
of 2005's 'Supernature', while maintaining much of 'Seventh Tree's subtle
nature. Alison Goldfrapp's vocals are as heavenly and bright as ever, while the
synths of Will Gregory compliment her perfectly, as evident on anthemic single
'Rocket'.

Enjoy!
