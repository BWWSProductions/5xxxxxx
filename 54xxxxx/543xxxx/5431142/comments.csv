Thanks guys.

@valu59er: Oh, I was expecting so and I got English and Dutch subs for both, I hope they're good (as translation).

[V],twentyforty,2010-03-13T14:52Z,"@valu59er: Also, you should let me know when you finish downloading and when you can download the second one."
,trotar,2011-02-20T08:07Z,"hi, I'm new to torrents. I have downloaded the movie onto my mac using utorrent. It shows in my desktop as succesfully downloaded, it is an avi file. When I click on it, Quicktime opens up and the screen appears black. How do I watch it?
Please help. Thank you"
