A disillusioned killer embarks on his last hit but first he has to overcome his affections for his cool, detached partner. Thinking itâ€™s dangerous and improper to become involved with a colleague he sets out to find a surrogate for his affections. Against the sordid and surreal urban nightscape (set in contemporary Hong Kong), he crosses path with a strange drifter looking for her mysterious ex-boyfriend and an amusing mute trying to get the worldâ€™s attention in his own unconventional ways.
