About the album:

Black Ice is the Grammy-Award winning sixteenth Australian and fifteenth internationally released studio album by the Australian rock band AC/DC, produced by Brendan O'Brien and released worldwide between 17 and 22 October 2008. AC/DC were known to be working on the album as early as January 2006, with it being delayed because of an injury to bassist Cliff Williams and a change of record labels from Epic Records to Columbia Records. It is their first album since the release of Stiff Upper Lip in 2000, the longest gap to date between two AC/DC studio albums. The band recorded it at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, Canada, the same studio as their previous album Stiff Upper Lip.

Black Ice sold approximately 1,762,000 units in its first week. The album went to number-one in 29 countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In its first week, it sold 784,000 copies in the United States alone. It was eventually certified 5x platinum in Australia. As of December 2009, the album has sold 6.2 million copies worldwide and is the second-best selling album worldwide of 2008, including physical and digital copies. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Black Ice #41 on their Top 50 Albums of 2008 list. Black Ice received two Grammy nominations; Best Rock Album and Best Hard Rock Performance for the song "War Machine." It won the Best Hard Rock Performance category.
