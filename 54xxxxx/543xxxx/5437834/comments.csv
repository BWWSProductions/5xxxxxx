,Bob__Dole,2010-03-17T02:32Z,"RAR files means nothing, previous TvTeam torrents were rars."
,sberesni,2010-03-17T02:45Z,"DJMykee: Settle down homey, TvTeam releases are good.."

V: 8 (to get down to 350MB = -2)
A: 8 (cooked hi sound level - might be in original = -2)

Not ""HD"" either though, 624x352 as listed above.

Thanks TvTeam!"

,writers,2010-03-17T09:24Z,"asks for rar password, links to annoying scam download site just to get password file, hell no"
,crescentstar,2010-03-17T17:30Z,"The surveys are not even available to all locations.
Fuck this idiot!"
,Hydra25,2010-03-17T18:53Z,"I don't know what file you guys are downloading, but this one does not ask for any kind of rar-password or any kind of password in the video either."
,jrod236,2010-03-17T19:49Z,"Neither have i ever acounted a password protected rar file, even when alot of people says that it needs password to unpack. And TvTeam upl's are always good, so no need to complain.. anyways, download it first before you acuse it for beeing fake. Last but not least, Thx for the up TT"
,strikerzero,2010-03-17T21:23Z,Thanks TvTeam

Thanks, TVTeam, for the the upload! 

I am shure they will show the same quality as your previous shares !

To all mates: I have been downloading TVTeam releases, not only of LOST, but also of other series I follow.

The rar files have always been OK, NOT passworded and they have never carried any malware, trojans or virus whatosever.

In time: for the Brazilian language subtitles users only:
Every .srt Brasilian subtitles I have downloaded from  ""www.addic7ed.com/serie/Lost/"" are oddly encoded, and strange character combination are shown in screen for accented letters, like ã, õ, é etc, both on VLC and on DVD recorded to be seen through a DVD Player on a TV set.
You can find correctly encoded Brasilian subtitles at:
legendas.tv or
opensubtitles.com

The English subtitles of addic7ed.com are very good, no problems in these.

Best regards to all and have a good time with this episode!
