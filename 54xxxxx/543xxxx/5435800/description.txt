    Raymond makes roots exciting! To start a simple salad      
    of steamed beetroot with balsamic dressing, hot smoked    
    salmon and horseradish creme fraiche. Next up is a       
    creamy yet nutty celeriac puree served alongside a        
    crisp-skinned roast wild duck with blackberry sauce. A     
    simple and stockless watercress soup is a bowl of         
    health on a winter's day and to round off, a             
    celebration of the season: a winter vegetable salad       
    featuring pumpkin, beets, wild mushrooms and a red wine    
    reduction. Along the way, Raymond tries his hand at       
    cutting watercress in Britain's watercress capital,      
    Arlesford in Hampshire.
