,surx325,2010-03-31T10:36Z,"In order for the original Sims 3, World Adventures, and High End Loft to work correctly you...

1. Install Sims 3, then patch the game to version 1.11.7

2. Install World Adventures, then patch up to version to 2.6.11

3. Install High End Loft, then patch to version 3.2.8

4. copy and paste High End Loft crack to /bin

if this is correct please respond in a comment. "
,sting977,2010-04-05T12:40Z,"When I download this crack it is named TS3SP01.exe but the file of my game in program files is named TS3EP01.exe so the crack won't work... What should I do now =S and for all people who just take a guess, changing the file name won't work..."
,Kolida,2010-04-06T16:05Z,"@sting977

TS3EP01 is World Adventures.
ST3SP01 is High End Loft Stuff."
,Bladeboy05,2010-05-04T19:07Z,"@surx325 Your steps work, IF y'all having any crashing or no disk crack problems follow surx325 steps. IT WORKS!"
,silencesummer,2010-05-21T22:52Z,"This works! I pretty much followed steps like surx, but didn't worry about manually updating (each installer will update anyways, and when I did manually update it caused issues). For some reason the crack on the Vitality High End Stuff torrent I downloaded didn't include the TSLHost, so I needed a no DVD crack.

Here's the steps I did:

1. I installed Sims 3 Razor1911

2. then Sims 3 WA Reloaded

3.then installed Sims 3 High End Vitality

4.then installed this crack.

Keep in mind do not install any cracks until you get to this crack, as the Sims installer will probably not update (always keep a backup of original files anyways, by renaming files that are replaced _old rather than deleting/replacing)

Thanks again for the upload!

,awolfe,2010-05-23T14:35Z,"Hi, Mac user here.

My game also crashes in the middle of the neighborhood loading screen.

I followed these steps...

-Installed TS3, Razor version. Manually changed text in download.ill to an ""updated"" version with region 2 to work with WA install.

-Installed WA Reloaded. Manually changed text in download.ill to an ""updated"" version to work with HEL install.

-Installed HEL. Manually changed text in download.ill to an ""updated"" version so that it would stop telling me to download.

-Replaced TS3EP01 and TS3SP01 files in both their respective game/bin folders.

-Replaced TSLHost.dll with cracked one.

I am unsure how to patch the game without just manually writing in different versions, at least on a Mac. How exactly (IE, idiot steps) does one get this to work on a Mac?

Thanks so much in advance."
,awolfe,2010-05-23T14:47Z,"Sorry, not ""download.ill"" - I meant to write ""default.ini""."
,awolfe,2010-05-23T17:07Z,"Actually, just followed surx325's steps.  Thank you so much!  Will write more in-depth how-to in a little bit."
,ffsims,2010-05-23T21:53Z,"First I want to say this works great, but I have a problem. The serial code provided V677-YLAC-SCRM-E201-0VTY, no longer works.

This has nothing to do with installation, I simply screwed up. Is there another working serial code for high end loft?"
,LaMaraVish,2010-06-02T21:13Z,I installed using the same serial code (V677-YLAC-SCRM-E201-0VTY) Might want to double check
,mr.v,2010-06-11T13:18Z,"it's not work!
i cannot install the game
cannot extract .rar file because it's error"
,Gary0Oak,2010-06-17T01:22Z,"Whenever i try to play it says ""Your The Sims 3 Base Game is incompatible with the current Sims 3 Expansion Pack. Please update your game via the game launcher."" Can someone help?"
