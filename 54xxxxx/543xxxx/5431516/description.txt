This is the 1st author I've done in well over 6 months due to personal issues.
I almost forgot how to author this shit! LOL.
I would like to thank KISSPEP, Rob Bertson, Jean Cover Design and the NYC Bitch Committee, for the
material and for letting me completely rip-off all of your hard work. LOL. This disc was never intended
to be shared, but for personal use only. So I'm very sorry for ripping you all off like this. But,
thank you for your hard work.

I worked on the picture and colors to my liking. There is only 1 audio track and it is a 5.1 surround
matrix of the cam audio and the Concert Live soundboard. I did my own audio tweaking to the tracks also.

Please do not sell.
Thanks, Mick E. Gee
