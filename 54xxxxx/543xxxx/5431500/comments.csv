[V],globeplus,2010-03-14T01:44Z,"it is true that the capacity of the computer can improve the performance , specially in games that are more hard to make the emulation but still true that correct configurations help a lot in the normal gameplay using the emulator , before 0.9.6 version of this emulator this game for example was listed as imcompatible almost with nothing emulated and now with a nice computer you have a shot to finish the game and the 0.9.7 already have fantastic indicators that make allof us , pcsx2 users think that the next emulator version can be absolutly fantastic with probably 5% or more of incompatible games (games stucked at the menus or the ingame) with chances to start running fine and the gameplay with at least 5 frames per second more than the 0.9.6 version , what means more normal gameplay as possible including for the toughest emulated ones , so this emulator is really improving and what we have now is already positive , please enjoy this files , they are fantastic ps2 titles without a pc version that now with a ps2 emulator you can play in the pc . 
I wish the best of luck for 0.9.7 version and more ps2 for pc files with nice ps2 titles to coming up from me . Thank you ."

,alleworkz,2010-03-14T10:12Z,Do you need a ps2 controller to play this game? or can you play with the keyboard
,alleworkz,2010-03-14T12:32Z,"The quality is great but the sound is awful, is there anyone who know what i should do to make it better?"

,RICO1401,2010-03-19T03:17Z,aneesh ARE U SURE THAT IT IS PLAYABLE WITH PC-KEYBOARD? I DONT HAVE PROPER IDEA ..... JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE.
,RICO1401,2010-03-19T03:18Z,also it will be great to know if the game is working or not ..... some feedback will be great guys.
,xnajkn,2010-03-19T07:19Z,Seed please.
,flirtyguy10,2010-03-27T20:24Z,"For those who are not sure about this rip, the game works perfectly. I just had to tweak a little as it was a bit laggy on my gpu (Nvidia 9500gt 512MB).
Those who are not sure whether they can use keyboard to play, yes you can. You just have to configure the controls in pcsx2.
Hope this solves all your problems."
,gbroman,2010-04-09T05:50Z,"hey flirtguy10 or anyone else, can you give some advice to morons like me that wouldn't know how to configure the controller?
Pad1 is full of L1, L2,L3,R1,R2,R3 etc and is basically the buttons on a PS2 game controller and that does sweet FA for a keyboard user.
Pad2 is full of blank spaces..............what we meant to do, assign keyboard keys to the empty boxes?
Cheers
gbroman"

,jonnychadootz,2010-04-14T22:52Z,"Didn't work for me, got to Poseidon in the 1st stage. As soon as I go to get the lightning magic from Poseidon (when the game goes to end the cutscene) the emulator crashes and that's that (does the same shit over and over)

PC Specs:

3.5G Dual core CPU
2 gigs Ram
9600 GT 512MB

PC has more than enough to play the game. Hopefully when 0.9.7 comes out it will work correctly. Thanks for the up.

,Lilreaper69,2010-06-30T03:54Z,Game works fine for me can play it and works great only problem is that for some reason my FPS is fairly low which makes the game almost impossible to play it's all laggy. Does anyone know how to fix this. any help would be greatly appreciated.
,Miseria,2010-08-11T18:50Z,"please be careful sharing this one, we got a letter from our isp and they turned off our service till we sign it, i guess they got a hold of this one and downloaded a piece of it so they could get the ip addys of the people reseeding it. i'm not saying don't seed, god forbid lol, i'm just saying be cautious and mind your connections on this one. since we received notification after removing the torrent once seeded, i can't point to a particular connection unfortunately. it's terrible what's going on these days, essentially forcing the isp to police it's people. they're trying to shut us all down and they can't win, we're too sneaky :P best believe i've tightened my security now...although i have to wonder why this game lol, you can get it in the bargain bin for 5 bucks. why not halo or dragon age or any number of more recent, popular games. you could almost argue that this game has been reworked, with proprietary coding and whatnot, and therefore is actually the property of this uploader :P
