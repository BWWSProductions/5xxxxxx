,FunKeyDawg,2010-03-18T02:43Z,Has anyone tried this? Does it work? 
,cjnkmp,2010-03-19T16:47Z,"Dont try it, I made the mistake and it gave me a worm. It completly fucked my computer. The person who put the torrent up is obviously a sad little man who cant get laid to save his life."
,Hades85,2010-03-22T00:17Z,this guy is full of crap I'm glad I already have the 90 day trial installed and partially hacked so every day the trial resets itself.this thing has a trojan worm virus embeded with it plus about 16 other viruses within the setup itself.this dude is a f***ing prick.this torrent needs to be removed before others are infected by it.
,CherryxDarling,2010-03-24T22:35Z,Thank you to everyone who left comments about this torrent. I would probably have about 2 million viruses if it weren't for comments lol. I will definitely not be downloading this.

I just have one question.
How did you hack the trial so that it resets?"
,Hades85,2010-04-01T01:55Z,jack2230 sry havnt been back here in a few days its just a thing I set up that every 88 days the removal tool will run and the 360 installation will run and update on its own.the 90 day reset thing only worked for about a week and then I got an automated update and it stopped working.sry to burst your bubble on the hopes of that.I've tried redoing my lil hack and have looked at the code several times to try and fix it but no luck.just cant fix it.so I gave up and deleted the coding.

,cintronix,2010-04-12T18:12Z,"This works great.  The users who posted above that it's full of viruses are lying...probably Symantec employees.

Works great."
,van_helsing_80,2010-04-28T08:17Z,"What the heck... Torrent's comment says its with 2 year license and the title of the file says that its an OEM version with 90 days license!

I am using a 90 Days OEM license and the setup file is around 140 MB, and this guy is providing it in around 31 MB!"

,jr_mtz01,2010-05-26T06:16Z,"well this IS an .exe file when ti should be a .rar file, and it is wayyyyyy too small to be the application itself, so you kids that actually downloaded it... hmmmm i feel sorry for ya returds :)"
,echo873,2010-07-20T17:46Z,"Instead of using lousy English, could anybody report this torrent?"
,ThePlatypus,2010-08-02T05:23Z,"31.57 MiB. Yeah. The real OEM version from the Norton website is like 140 MB. I downloaded this to be sure to a quarantine folder on an external bootable drive running Windows XP. Lets see. It had a keylogger, it had a worm that placed it self in just about every folder on my C drive, and many, many others. Don't call me a retard or anything, I new from the start. Just wanted to warn everyone as thats what that drive is for."
