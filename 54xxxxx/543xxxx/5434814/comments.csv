,hannibal0,2010-03-17T18:38Z,"i take it this is not for the actual TOMTOM Device???????

anyone?"
[T],chuckie6,2010-03-17T19:14Z,"For the TomTom device to give prior warning of speed/safety camera locations. Add the database to your device.

The principle is that each speed level is added, in effect, as a point of interest. The linked page within the upload gives instructions on how to set the warnings etc.

Up to date as of January 23rd 2010."
