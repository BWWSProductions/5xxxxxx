,vandergraaf100,2010-03-16T23:35Z,Let the rapturous joy begin! Part 13 is upon us! REJOICE REJOICE!! No seriously dude many thanks!
,gearofwar,2010-03-18T16:19Z,"Despite already having Kaipa, Kansas and KC, just got very endeared towards Kayak, am currently getting completely blown away by Kenso, and am looking forward to finally discovering Klaatu, who I have heard lots about... SB, you have outdone yourself, this one's a corker!
I don't suppose you have any other Kenso albums? Listening to it right now, and seriously, it's incredible!

Proud to be a seeder!"
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-03-18T17:34Z,"@gearofwar:  Thanks mate, glad you like it and glad you like the Kenso album.  Sorry I don't have any of their other albums.  I've just been having a listen to it myself just then, it's great you're right!  Anyways, hopefully this one should go strong now.  I've fully uploaded it, just hoping that the earlier torrents for the collection don't start to weaken off probably because there's still lots of people out there who haven't seen it on here yet and would most probably want to download this stuff...

I've been having a problem just recently trying to get tags to work with these torrents but it doesn't work on Pirate Bay and I don't know why?  I've for example got ""Krautrock"" as a tag for all these torrents for this collection but when you search Pirate Bay for that word it doesn't find any of my torrents :-(  I was hoping that if people wanted to find some Krautrock then by typing in that word in a search they would find some in my collection because there is lots of Kraut stuff that I've mixed in with all the Prog stuff and the others."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-03-18T18:08Z,"You know when I listen to all this Prog and stuff from these torrents I don't really listen to the albums on their own, what I always do is mix up the tracks on my MP3 player.  It's good that way, I've got used to doing it.  I've got a Cowon S9 16 GB MP3 player at the moment, only snag is you can only put 16 gigs on it.  I have all the latest ones on it now from this torrent back to Greenslade.  I have been listening to all these bands now since I started making these.  I take my MP3 player all over and listen to these, my S9 has a good sound too, much better than say an IPOD touch.  I fancy getting one of those IPOD classics, they're supposed to be a good quality sound so I've heard.  The 160 gig one would be excellent to load all these songs onto and then you could listen to them all the time

I listen to these bands for hours and hours sometimes, sometimes it's what I do all evening when I'm at home or when I'm on the PC.  I just let them all mix up going from one band to another one, sometimes I have to look to see what it is I'm actually listening to sometimes because I don't have a bloody clue lol"
,gearofwar,2010-03-20T18:20Z,"I've had the 160G ipod classic for over 2 years now, I must say (and I'm not normally an apple person) it's the best mp3 player I've had. Great quality, battery life is insanely good, and it's very durable as well. Highly recommended.
Unfortunately, I currently have around 220G of prog on my computer (and rising thanks to you), and another 200 of other music!
When I get your torrents I listen to as many albums as I can all the way through, and put my favourites on the mp3 for shuffly goodness.
Waiting for the next gen to come out, although I fear they are abandoning the classic to develop the gadget-ridden touch line. It's just not about the music anymore... Archos also do good players with plenty of memory, but they're physically a lot bigger too.
Had to reset my computer last month so lost parts 1-5, but am still seeding the rest. My bit client was at one point registering over 1,200 leechers for this torrent! Must be great to know your collections are reaching so many people."
,hujev,2010-03-21T02:04Z,"Wow, holymoly! A long-delayed thanks for this and the other 12 and your hard work keeping these from the dustbins of forgotten art. You should be getting government arts grants for this! (you know, for record cleaner, cartridges, drive belts, beer, etc.)"
,Bioshock1000,2010-03-24T19:31Z,This is the best one yet! Fantastic. Thank you so much. I'm loving the King Crimson stuff
,jeffstmed,2010-03-24T20:07Z,"Thanks for this torrent. I re-discover some beautifull groups. And I discover so much, like Koenjihyakkei, wonderful zeuhl music... Great job you are doing....."
,gearofwar,2010-04-18T01:55Z,Congratulations on the skull!
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-04-18T11:36Z,"Thanks gearofwar, I am lucky.

The next installment should be along soon.  I've been having a break to tell the truth, I've been meaning to get L finished, there won't be a massive amount of band for L but M there will be a lot so I will have to get busy and get them all done so I can upload.

Hopefully people are joining these ones, this one took a fair bit of effort.  I'm glad they're all seeding pretty well at the moment."
,grubtrot,2010-05-03T02:20Z,I love you.
,CURTILINGUS,2010-05-04T05:42Z,Spandau thank you so much.  I have been with this collection since #2 and I have made a concerted effort to listen to all of it!  I have played in several bands and I'm sharing it with as many friends as possible.  Thanks so much for your gift.  I'm sure the bands appreciate all the additional fans and exposure that they never would have had if it weren't for your efforts.
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-04T20:49Z,"@CURTILINGUS:  No worries mate and thanks so much for listening.  Stay tuned, there's more to come yet.  I have more bands coming your way, please forgive me but I have been missing spending time in making more of these torrents with the prog etc..  My life has been a bit weird just recently, I'm about to finish college soon and then I shall have masses of time to get my way through these.

I have been doing this for a while now, yes I remember making the very first one and now it's 14 next.  I have backed all these up to disc and I should suggest that you do exactly the same.  DVD-R Dual layer is a good idea, you can get lots of bands on a single one.  So don't forget that I shall be making more real soon, I haven't given up and I won't do either.  Just give me some time and surely I will be getting back into the swing, hopefully then I can go right through the alphabet all the way to Z and get all these out there.

I have to agree some of these bands are timeless and amazing musical feasts.  Not to be missed by any serious rock music fan :-)"
,throwin_mixer,2010-05-09T18:43Z,"SpandauBaby: do you need help? 

i am as fanatical as you are about tagging so it's something i can do easily enough... take some work off your shoulders to get it out quicker.
"
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-10T00:37Z,"@throwin_mixer:  Thanks mate, that's very kind to offer.  I'm ok though really, I do this alone.  It's what I do when I'm on my own and have nothing else better to do.  With the tagging I have a system now that I use to try and ensure that it's all constant and without making any error, something I have practised doing myself for a while now."
,blomfest1979,2010-05-10T17:18Z,"thanx, great collection, it still goes 'till Z ???"
