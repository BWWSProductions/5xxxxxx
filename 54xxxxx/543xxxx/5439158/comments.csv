Anyways, someone who has this game legally but still is a pirate could in theory upload savefiles that are at different places in the game, like one that is gamed specificly leaving all treasures, upgrades etc. for any player to get =)"

If it still doesn't work then there might be something else that is wrong..."

,glasswings21,2010-03-18T00:58Z,What to do in this game not accept any mission and just jump around those buildings and hop around the city? this is weird why the white screen by choosing the mission or accepting any maneuver practice i hope there would be something very soon enough because i can't wait to get this game working 100%.
,pukss,2010-03-18T19:01Z,"synchronizing save games.....

,DofusOctopus,2010-03-19T01:49Z,"dont download this bullshit ... its just files ubisoft create .... in the save content .... 

this cunt is a wanker and he deserves to get slapt by a DILDO (BLACK RIBBED)"
,DofusOctopus,2010-03-19T22:44Z,"i didnt download this thanks to the feed back comments ... lol 

what i will say is... A month prior to the date released and there will be a crack!!!

ill explain how hard it is to crack!!! 

it needs an 24/7 internet connection 
so obviously! packets of data are being transfered back and forth from the servers to your computer. 

a hacking team are playing the game and recording/saving these packets' so they can impliment them into the game data files so it doesnt need the internet, its basically like writing the whole fucking game again (Screech)

but whens its done the game should be exacly what it was supposed to be like.... ""DRM FREE"" 
which makes us happy 

sorry ubisoft i would have baught your game if you didnt try and claim half of the product and my computer. 

Your are a bunch of cocks with ball bags as friends. "
