...Assassins Creed II Working Save Game...  SAVE GAME FROM himkimos  


so... here's the big deal... wen u get past the animus bug by saved games... don't go to Mario... u'll get white screen...

instead go to the other cities...
Florence, for example... there u can do evrything!!! shop, fight, swim, leap of faith, steal, get codex pages, bribe heralds, assassinate... and evry other thing!!!!

so, juss entertain yourselves with this till there's a crack...


How to install:

open up C:/ Program Files/ Ubisoft/ Ubisoft Game Launcher/ storage/ dG9taXRyZWJh /4

and delete all save files... 

next step: copy/past new saves...

you will have to clear out your save folder and plonk in the 4 saves from this torrent every time you start a new game but at least you can play it for now untill a proper crack comes along.	


next step: start AssassinsCreedIIGame.exe...

next step: When asked the Serial just click on Play/Ok	
	


If you don't want to place the saves every time you want to play.
You can just click the gear icon at the left of the minimize icon in the Ubisoft Loader, so it stops synchronizing your save with the server. If you do this, you can even save your progress using this savegame, but you can't go into missions. Remember: if you accept a mission, the screen goes white, and you can only see the HUD. 



once again to those with cd-key problems... The first time the Ubisoft gamelauncher starts up it updates itself, thereby uncracking it. So just re-crack it after the update and it should work like a charm...
