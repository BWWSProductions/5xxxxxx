,kolokythis,2011-04-07T14:22Z,Thank you for this but its only a part of the game's music which numbers more than 40 tracks.
,ScoreGods,2011-08-08T15:05Z,"The complete NN album from 2002 includes 45 short tracks but the uploaded tracks are great plus top quality.  Thanks tonmild!  


Compare the latest work of Jeremy Soule with this older album and feel Soule's improvings. Studio technology (samle quality, recordings, mixing and mastering) is clearly getting in the limelights. 

Top Notch upcoming release on 11.11.11 for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Original Soundtrack by Jeremy Soul with a *bombastic* atmosphere !!! 

The release date is unique and the games and scores that will be released on this date will be unique, special.
