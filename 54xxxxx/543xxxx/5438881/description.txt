Treepeople was an alternative rock band from Boise, Idaho, although it spent most of its time and was officially based in Seattle, Washington. The band was composed of Pat Brown, Wayne Rhino Flower, Doug Martsch, and Scott Schmaljohn, many of them ex-members of the Boise punk band State of Confusion. The band gained local notoriety and success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but after losing members to family complications and other projects, particularly Martsch and Flower to The Halo Benders (and, subsequently, Martsch to Built to Spill) the group disbanded in 1994, having released three albums and a handful of singles. Scott Schmaljohn later played in Stuntman, The Hand, and The Treatment. Schmaljohn also guested on Built to Spill's latest release There Is No Enemy, playing on the song "Pat," a tribute to Pat Brown.
