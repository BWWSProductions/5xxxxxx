,ireallyamabum,2011-01-06T23:04Z,"Get this: I was actually THERE!!!! I was in the middle of the crowd witnessing this masterpiece take place. Ive never had so many goosebumb attacks in my life. The original albums awesome no doubt but this was fucking magic. I heard confused metalheads around me saying ""i didnt pay for this"". What?! I guess the didnt know what the word symphony meant. Shitheads. It exceeded my expectations by a galaxy. Im so ever greatful for Serj doing this for us and himself. My normal cupotea is log and slipknot but this was just...well if you recognise good music ull embrace this. Bet this will reach beethoven status in a few hundred years..if mankind will be able to survive that lĂÂśong..doubt it. And oh yeah, i think i lost contiousness during gate 21. Or maybe time stopped for a decade or so, not sure. Serj for world leader."
