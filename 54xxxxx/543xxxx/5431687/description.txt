 Dr. Adrian Helmsley, part of a worldwide geophysical team investigating the  
 effect on the earth of radiation from unprecedented solar storms, learns     
 that the earth's core is heating up. He warns U.S. President Thomas Wilson   
 that the crust of the earth is becoming unstable and that without proper     
 preparations for saving a fraction of the world's population, the entire     
 race is doomed. Meanwhile, writer Jackson Curtis stumbles on the same        
 information. While the world's leaders race to build "arks" to escape the    
 impending cataclysm, Curtis struggles to find a way to save his family.      
 Meanwhile, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes of unprecedented strength      
 wreak havoc around the world.
