PLEASE NOTE!
Normally I rip my CDâ€™s with EAC to flac files. But here I had to use Winamp for CD 1. For some reason EAC couldnâ€™t read CD 1. Iâ€™ve enclosed log files from Audiochecker to verify that the tracks are genuine flac files. CD 2 is ripped with EAC to flac. I hope you will appreciate the sound quality. (If anyone has any idea why the reading error occurred, please leave a comment).
