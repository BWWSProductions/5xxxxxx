                             ------------


  Creative input is inevitably required of the PR practitioner, and yet many PR practitioners lack a real understanding of the creative process. Creativity in Public Relations addresses this situation. It guides the reader through a range of techniques and tips for generating creative ideas, as described by the "five I's" of the creative process: information, incubation, illumination, integration and illustration. Among the topics it explores are: techniques for stimulating ideas, ways to evaluate ideas, obstacles to creativity, the creative individual, and the creative organization. It includes practical examples and research carried out by those in the PR industry who are regarded as creative by their peers.  By clearly establishing a definition of "creativity," this book will help PR practitioners use the creative process to greater effect in their work.
