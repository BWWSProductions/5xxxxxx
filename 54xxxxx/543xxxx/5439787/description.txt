I could not find a plain old-fashioned DVDrip with Nordic subs for this new film, so I rented the DVD and made one.

My ripping procedure now produces decent quality for such a long film compressed 
into just 700 MiB. I enclose a sample for ye weak in faith.

Widescreen DVDrip XviD 2-pass 704x368, great stereo sound AC3.
Runs well in both my standalone DivX players.

Fun stuff: Meryl Streep (height 5' 6" or 1.68 m)is imitating Julia Child, who was 6' 2" or 1.89 tall. In most of the film, she appears to be taller than everyone else.

In the sample scene, the French women with the heavy accent asks Julia if she knows how to 'bone a duck' ('bawn e deck'). This is a great challenge for most cooks, who must surgically remove the bones from a raw duck and stuff the meat back into the skin before it is sewn together again. In a later scene, Julia has completed just that surgery.
