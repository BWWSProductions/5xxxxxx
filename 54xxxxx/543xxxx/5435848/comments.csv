[V],twentyforty,2010-03-16T18:23Z,"Merantau = encoded yesterday, OK, coming
The Final = tried to watch, bad, NO WAY
Zombies of Mass Destruction = a joke... no way
Survival of the Dead = another junk, waste of bandwidth
Cut = radioactive waste

And... I downloaded them all yesterday and day before and I'm speaking my mind. I have SO many good, best movies ever done, a few new ones ... and really honest desire to share them all. But..."

,pirate_007,2010-03-16T20:38Z,"i saw this link  http://thepiratebay.org/search/The%20Penguins%20of%20Madagascar%20Operation%20DVD%20Premiere%202010/0/99/0 
and thought it may released k  thks fr the info..."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-17T06:49Z,"I repeat, you are wrong. It doesn't exist. 

Or... I can ""release"" any movie from 2009 and put 2010 in the title instead.

Please, always Google ""imdb "" and you can save yourself from embarrassments."
