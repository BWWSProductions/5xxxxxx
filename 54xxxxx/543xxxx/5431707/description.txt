BBC Franz Peter Schubert: The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow PDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 1994

Christopher Nupen's documentary uses Schubert's own words and music to help us feel closer to a composer who failed to achieve public recognition and financial success in his own lifetime, the first great composer in western music to live by his art alone, without patronage. With Vladimir Ashkenazy (piano), Andreas Schmidt (baritone), Michael Sanderling (cello), Antje Weithaas (violin), the Petersen Quartet and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.
