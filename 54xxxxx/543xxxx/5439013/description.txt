                   This brand new documentary film tells the story of The 
                   Doors, not from the perspective of the surviving       
                   members - as has been told so many time before -but    
                   from the recollections, memories, stories and anecdotes
                   of those who knew the group and its members best.      
                   Our panel is headed by a woman who was as close to Jim 
                   Morrison as anyone ever was; his widow Patricia        
                   Kennealy-Morrison. Patricia has rarely spoken on film  
                   about her relationship with Jim, or about her own      
                   memories of The Doors. This is a once in a lifetime    
                   contribution from someone who knew just about          
                   everything that went on. Next up is Billy James, the   
                   man who discovered Jim Morrison and an early           
                   incarnation of The Doors. Billy signed them to their   
                   first deal with Columbia Records, and gained the trust 
                   and respect of the entire group. Here he tells all     
                   about those very early days when The Doors were known  
                   only to a select few. Richard Goldstein â€“ ex-editor of 
                   Village Voice and close friend of the band is on hand  
                   too with his anecdote-heavy version of events, as is   
                   Mark Benno, the legendary blues musician whose searing 
                   guitar graced the L.A. Woman album.                    
                   The very finest Rock journalists and writers, and those
                   who lived through and were affected by The Doors music 
                   as it was being released also contribute to this most  
                   original documentary film. In this regard, we are      
                   joined by Robert Christgau, Johnny Rogan, Dave         
                   DiMartino, Ritchie Unterberger, Doug Sundling, and Jim 
                   Morrison's biographer James Riordan.                   
                                                                          
                   The programme is further enhanced by the rarest footage
                   of the band in existence, classic live and studio      
                   musical performances, seldom seen photographs, news    
                   clips, location shots and much more.                   
                                                                          
                   EXTRAS include featurette, Conversation with The       
                   Lizard Queen, in which Patricia Morrison reveals her   
                   own views about Jim Morrison as an artist, a poet and a
                   visionary.
