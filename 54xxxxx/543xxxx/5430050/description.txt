Wet Dreams 2 centers on the sexual fantasies of Sung Eun (Kang Eun Bi) and her gal pals Bang Su Yeon (Jeon Hye Bin) and Kim Mi Sook (Park Seul Gi) in Korea circa 1991. But fantasy soon becomes a reality with the arrival of a handsome student teacher named Kang Bong Gu (Lee Ji Hoon). With his chiseled good looks and sparkling smile, no girl could resist him, that is if he didnâ€™t have one fatal flaw. It seems Kang has an incurable disease; it isnâ€™t really fatal, but it might as well be. Poor Kang has a â€œgassyâ€ problem that puts a major damper on his sex life! However, that little problem doesnâ€™t stop Oh Sung Eun from trying to snag her man! For those looking for a rousing American Pie-style comedy, look no further than Wet Dreams 2!
