I can seed only for a few hours a day... sorry!"
,salakutt,2010-03-16T17:51Z,why it is so small? I hope it isnt fake :O
,salakutt,2010-03-16T17:55Z,"Ok :)

i thought about it too, i am suprised that this is so small :).

If it is right one then THANKS!!!"
,hellwisp,2010-03-16T18:01Z,is that a question?.. if yes.. i don't understand it.
,hellwisp,2010-03-16T18:03Z,Ok.. this was dumb.. i didn't even test if it works.. i will try to install it now.
[T],[D],2010-03-16T18:04Z,"Downloaded this from a private tracker so it shouldn't fake. Works fine.
Some problems I encountered: after 1-2 minutes it said installation failed. Solved by selecting win98 compatibility mode for setup.exe in the root of the dvd (i have windows xp).
It seems you need to select a lower compatibility then your OS version, so in windows 7 you have to select XP, etc."
,Norwegian_Smiley,2010-03-16T18:21Z,"Will this work only for US versions,
as it won't be released in Europe until Friday? : )"
,hellwisp,2010-03-16T18:26Z,It works fine... had no trouble installing..
,hellwisp,2010-03-16T18:27Z,Yes it's the US version.. don't know anything about compatibility..
,hellwisp,2010-03-16T18:30Z,well actually the language is English (united sates) so i suppose it's US
,merary,2010-03-16T18:43Z,its multilanguage?

,Metalprofi,2010-03-16T19:42Z,"so, this works only with Daemon tools, and not with Power Iso..can some1 confirm please?"
,Faitu,2010-03-16T20:07Z,"@PhelanKell
Well, there is still the risk that this might not work for European versions, someone should give it a try. There are some core differences between the two versions of Dragon Age, or so it seems. There are a few mods, for example, that only work for the US version."
,hellwisp,2010-03-16T20:24Z,it worked for me.. where should i look to check if I have US or EU.. it's not in the properties 
,hellwisp,2010-03-16T20:28Z,i think it doesn't matter if it's US or EU 'cause Razor would have mentioned it...
,phatfunk,2010-03-16T20:49Z,your a legend ive been waiting ages for this. tried the fast download thing matsumi mentioned and it wasnt all that fast. it was faster that this though. Anyways i will comment if it actually works though. By the by  does anyone know what the difference is in return to ostagar 1.0 and 1.1?
,Zael06,2010-03-16T21:12Z,"So i downloaded it fine, but all i got were a bunch of rzr-daoa.001 rzr-raoa.002 files etc..., i have powerISO and daemon tools lite, but cant interact with these files. Also there were no .rar to extract. Do i have to do something to these files before i can install?"
,Zael06,2010-03-16T21:26Z,"Yeah thanks i just figured it out, for some reason winrar wasnt recognizing it i had to force launch it with winrar and was able to extract them."
,hellwisp,2010-03-16T21:30Z,Is there a way to increase my Seeding speed.. usually my download speed is 400kb/s+ but i'm uploading at about only 50kb/s.. how come? :/
,hellwisp,2010-03-16T21:47Z,"how to add a tracker to a torrent.. i added http://open.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce to this torrent but its not working
What does it change anyway?.. there are no tracker for now and it's working"
,Metalprofi,2010-03-16T21:56Z,"@Zael06 
so, how did you do it? Forcing rars?"
,hellwisp,2010-03-16T22:01Z,"@Metalprofi
Use 7Zip"
,gnetix,2010-03-16T22:21Z,"I was surprised by the size as well. I too got this from a private tracker, but couldn't get it to work. Kept getting an error and installation failed message. Thanks to D's comment, I changed the compatibility from vista to XP and everything was fine. Character imported no problem. Thanks for the comment D, helped me out!!    "
,gnetix,2010-03-16T22:23Z,"Oh yeah, @ metalprofi: I had the same issue and I just opened winrar and pulled one of the files into winrar. Then I drug one onto my desktop and it started to extract the disk. Hope this helps!!"
,Metalprofi,2010-03-16T22:28Z,"Thanx to both :hellwisp n gnetix ..I will let you know after 15 or 16 hours cos i dont know lately ppl r so mean, they dont want to seed cos of gigabytes or what...im uploading in max and downloading in min...so unfair"
,hellwisp,2010-03-16T22:29Z,When i import my character it has no armor.. is it supposed to be so?

,bigggdan,2010-03-16T23:58Z,"Its just a false positive(they make u think its a virus when its not), i recommend getting a better antivirus the crappy ones always say keygens are viruses.  Im guessing u have like AVG or something, i would get Avast Antivirus its also free but very good quality program."
,IntAut,2010-03-17T00:19Z,"I actually do have Avast. If it's just a false positive, I'll disable and run it..."
,bigggdan,2010-03-17T02:53Z,"ah ok avast doesnt usually pick up on those false positives, im sure its nothing though i know Razor rips are always clean.

At least i hope it is."
,Saerain,2010-03-17T03:11Z,"Keygens and cracks are detected as viruses because they are, really. Just 'friendly' ones, if you will."

,bigggdan,2010-03-17T05:59Z,"@Dole
You can usually find dll's if you google them for example type this in google      fmod_event.dll

usually there is a site that says download here, just download dll and then throw it in your C:/windows/system32 and it should work.  no garuntees but usually it works, also repeat if you are missing anymore."

,bigggdan,2010-03-17T18:12Z,"mine said same thing muder but i think its because i didnt fully install game i just copied files to HDD and ran it, im redownloading original dragonage from skidrow so i can do full install."
,BlockMe,2010-03-17T19:13Z,"Does this version break all The Origins DLC?

in other Torrents, people claim this will break all the DLCs, as oppose to allow items from Return to Ostagar to import"

,jasta85,2010-03-18T00:37Z,"question: I have skidrows dragon age download and have gotten up to the 1.02 patch, however when installing this it seems i need the 1.03 patch to play however i cant use the official one as it breaks (probably due to the cracks i use to run origins).  any way to get skid rows version to work with this? thanks"
[T],despo1ler,2010-03-18T04:28Z,"I was nervous about this being a 1st uplaod but all these comments have put that to rest thanks every1 for your input,@hellwisp looks like you beat everyone else on releasing this,so thanks for sharing."

,BlockMe,2010-03-18T07:11Z,"@jasta85
I thought The Awakening automatically installs Patch 1.03 for you. Although, without any 1.03 crack, I'm not sure if it's possible to play yet."
,Funkification,2010-03-18T08:31Z,I installed this and it appeared as if it were going to work until I noticed that none of the characters lips moves or they do not speak. There isn't even a narrator in the opening title. Is there any fixes to this possibly ?
[T],[D],2010-03-18T10:33Z,"Items from Ostagar work. I had the king's set in my inventory and it's still there. Not a very good set though, will sell it, the dragon armor set made by that funny guy is much better."
,osjjdb89,2010-03-18T13:21Z,would the patch 1.03 they are saying is required to play the game be automatically installed while installing this one or has it to be done separately manually?
,bigggdan,2010-03-18T14:33Z,"@last 5 or so people ~~~~Hey guys thought i would share my success on this torrenet.

I previously installed skidrows Dragon Age Origin game on my computer, i then installed the DLC packs, then i downloaded this torrent and unpacked rars, mounted ISO, then installed it onto my computer.  It didnt ask for cd key or anything for me, and it worked 100% flawlessly.  ALSO it automatically upgraded my game to version 1.03 which i was glad about :)

O also when i chose to import a character i noticed on both characters i tried to import it didnt give me my same armor or weapons i had (skills imported though) but on positive not the armor and weapons it did give me were better than the originals so thats fine with me lol.

Well i figure if you guys do install same as me it should work flawlessly, good luck and thanks hellwisp for awesome upload."
,hellwisp,2010-03-18T15:50Z,"well.. I apologize that i don't seed for 24 hours a day.. I just can't afford it ('cause I live in Latvia (fucking morons in government))
I'm happy to see that it works for most of you.

I had SKIDROW v1.02 and the Awakening installer installed the 1.03 automatically, but i think it should work if you install the patch manually"
,hellwisp,2010-03-18T17:15Z,"Here is a torrent with with better seeds

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5437217/Dragon_Age_Origins_Awakening_%5BMULTI8%5D%5BPCDVD%5D

should I take this torrent out?"
,bigggdan,2010-03-18T17:54Z,"na i would leave it up this one actually went faster for me (i tried both), it has less seeders than other one but also way less leechers so it goes a bit faster.  At least it did for me, also i read about people getting some dll errors or something on other one. "
,osjjdb89,2010-03-18T18:47Z,hey bigggdan........ your skidrow version of origins was unpatched right?its name was 'sr-dgnage.iso' and size of 7.71 gb?just checking if our copies are the same
,bigggdan,2010-03-18T19:03Z,@osjj yup exact same version
,Nothrazim,2010-03-18T20:12Z,"Man, i can't get this to work- it says ""This version of the Dragon Age: Origins- Awakening installer does not support your installed language of Dragon Age: Origins."" Anyone knows what to do? I tried changing my language in the Config, but all i see is en-us and English, with en-us being the current, but i can't even switch to English as it automatically returns to en-us when i exit. Anyone can help?"
,hellwisp,2010-03-18T21:00Z,I had en-us and after awakening installation it's still en-us.. you should not have a problem like that.. did you download SKIDROW version of DA:O?.. so far it seems that it works for everybody with SKIDROW
,osjjdb89,2010-03-19T05:01Z,where can i download the DLC of origins (i think they are named WARDEN'S KEEP and RETURN TO OSTAGAR) compatible with the skidrow's version of origins?downloading them from the in-game menu comes for a price i think.can anyone provide a link for free download?
,osjjdb89,2010-03-19T05:54Z,@ bigggdan-----where did you download the DLC Packs from?

,sethenmannen,2010-03-19T17:51Z,"my installation failed, i cant tell why , i have tried several times  plzzz anwser!"
,bigggdan,2010-03-19T18:29Z,the only reason i would think it would fail is if your dragon age origin was not installed correctly or something.  Try downloading skidrow version of dragon age: origin if you dont have it already then reinstall.
,bigggdan,2010-03-19T18:30Z,Cause it installed fine for me and plays perfect.
,sethenmannen,2010-03-19T18:33Z,i have played dragon age origins before. so why would it be any wrong with that?
,bigggdan,2010-03-19T18:57Z,i dunno it was just an idea you arent giving us alot of info about your problem.  What exactly happens when you try installing it?
,sethenmannen,2010-03-19T19:23Z,"ok here is what it says: output foleder :M\program\dragon age
extract: unrar.dll... 100%
extract: saferun.exe... 100%
extract: saferun.dll... 100%
installing update: patch\dragonAge1.03.exe

and then finaly for just a sec:

prepering to extract ep1_core.rar bla bla bla (this may take several minutes)

*its there only a fraction of a sec so its weary hard for me to see

but after that there is a message: the instalation of dragon age: origins - awakening has failed


hope that helped =)"
,bigggdan,2010-03-19T19:48Z,"hmm i am actually not sure why it would do that, i would try completely uninstalling and reinstalling the original Dragon Age: Origin then try isntalling the expansion again.

Not sure if it asks when you are uninstalling original if you want to keep your save files so i would back them up in case so u can always recopy your saves into the folder and all your characters will be there then.  Save folder for dragon age is in  

C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Bioware  

by default, i have windows 7 so it may be set up a little bit different if your dont but ya thats your best bet probally other than reinstalling it i have no idea wat could be wrong with it....unless somehow your download got corrupt.

P.S. when you reinstall your original dragon age game u would want to copy and paste/overwrite you save file into that same spot and then start game and your characters should be there."
,TwoCoins,2010-03-19T19:51Z,Thanks for updating the description with keys!!
,sethenmannen,2010-03-19T20:58Z,it dident work it got further then it did before.but ill try to re-download it
,sethenmannen,2010-03-19T21:07Z,and if that dont work ill try to download another torrent=/
,bigggdan,2010-03-19T21:20Z,is your version of Dragon age origin the skidrow version cause that one should work with this torrent
,sethenmannen,2010-03-19T21:29Z,idk + i dont want to download the f*cking game all over again.if i dont have to. =P
,bigggdan,2010-03-19T22:09Z,"It could just be an issue with your version of Dragon Age:Origins thats making it not work not sure, but look at your installer if the iso is named    sr-dgnage.iso  then thats skidrow if not you may want to download skidrow version of game since i know that one works with the cracked expansion...

Other than that im out of ideas its to hard to try to figure out peoples issues without being by their computer to diagnose problem lol.

P.S. most of the releases of awakening on piratebay are all same rip just renamed, so getting different one of that wouldnt do much."
,sethenmannen,2010-03-19T22:15Z,"ok thanks for the help,you have been weary helpfull . now, could you send me a link to the skidrow version please"
,rule_pad,2010-03-19T22:50Z,i also have the same problem as sethenmannen.exactly the same problem.my DA:Origins is SKIDKROW.i dont know what the problem is

,sethenmannen,2010-03-20T09:12Z,and my awakening has no installation folder so i put mine in dragon age's bin_ship folder. was i suposed to do that????
,bigggdan,2010-03-20T09:30Z,"yes to your installation folder question, and for your game question to start awakening you click other campaigns button on main menu....there you can import characters etc."
,bigggdan,2010-03-20T09:32Z,"should have said that more clearly the button is called ""Other Campaigns"" to start awakening."

@snoop~~~i had that issue at first to but i found out it was because when i opened 1rst rar in 7zip i was dragging iso to different folder, instead wat you want to do it drag the iso from 7zip to the folder with all the rars and it should work.
