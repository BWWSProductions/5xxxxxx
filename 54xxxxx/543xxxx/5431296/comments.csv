,Riax,2010-03-13T23:22Z,"From Wiki:

Metro 2033 is an upcoming action-oriented video game with a combination of survival horror, RPG, and first-person shooter elements. The game is based on the novel Metro 2033 by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky. It is developed by 4A Games in Ukraine and will be released in March 2010 for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.[2] In March 2009, 4A Games announced a partnership with Glukhovsky to collaborate on the game.[3] The game was announced a few months later at the 2009 Games Convention in Leipzig;[4] a first trailer came along with the announcement.[5] When the game was announced, it had the subtitle The Last Refuge but this subtitle is no longer being used by THQ."

Idiot proof guide to extracting this game correctly would be awesome guys please"
,geelad1212,2010-03-16T11:47Z,"guys is this safe to play , dont think its out yet is it, and i cant get it stealthed or verified on abgx360 sorry if this is a stupid question but im just getting the hang learning u know."

,lenlendois2,2010-03-16T13:04Z,lennie1202 you have to download it again the swag-metro.r14 file
,Denzil,2010-03-17T07:30Z,"geelad1212 - Unless the game passes all stealth checks, has valid splitvid info and is patched to SSv2 then it's always going to be unsafe. Even if a game is perfectly patched with all green there's still a slight risk but having any of that info missing is always going to be far more riskier.

I'm waiting for the ini/SSv2 patch to be uploaded, which hopefully shouldn't be too long."

,Bujaaa,2010-03-24T23:13Z,I finished playing this game on PC and XBOX360. In XBOX360 version controls are much better but you can take aprox 50% less damage before you die. Anyways this is a very good game.

,igorgile,2010-05-24T10:30Z,"U fuckin idiots,this stupid game doesn't want to unrar,all i get its 95% and a message that This peace of shit is corrupted.I have wasted another 6.5 gb 4 nothing...So people DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS,its CORRUPTED...."
,ben2000677,2010-10-07T18:17Z,"As far as unraring goes, this torrent is fine. I just can't get ABGX360 to verify. So stealth is uncertain.... the XEX is F68D96F7, does anyone know how and when the database is updated? or if they do requests?"
,LNC123,2010-11-02T09:19Z,thank you to everyone that is seeding this im busy downloading it now THANK YOU.
