If you run it inside Sandboxie you can see it extracts a hidden downloader to your system. (The proper keygen _also_ then runs but you have a background bot sitting on your system.)

Having said that, running inside Sandboxie is safe, and you can retrieve the real keygen.exe from the Sandbox and throw the trojan away. 

Not for the faint-hearted."
