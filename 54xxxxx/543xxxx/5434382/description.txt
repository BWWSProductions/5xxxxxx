IMAGiNE NOTES
Well what can we say ....firstly we're a bit late releasing this, ran into a few problems with both video and audio, but we carried on and in the end got the result we wanted.
Video had to be rotated and leveled up, need the colours, contrast etc all tweaking so we did what needed to be done.
Audio was pain in the ass.....spent hrs trying to get it right and in sync.
Overall we're really pleased with the outcome .........So enjoy this really nice TS
