@paradime1... you likely are experiencing a local problem. All is OK... All is OK... All is Ok... are you comforted?

,patientx,2010-03-15T14:25Z,"TAMMIT1971

If folk want to watch bad quality movies that is up to them, because you lose the whole atmosphere of the movie and it's stunning resolution, so basically what you are watching is like the Matrix hypothesis....a bit unreal and untrue, to appreciate a movie on it's atmospherics and stunning resolution you have to see the movie with top quality audio and video and there are movies of that quality to download on this site...  Other than that, I love this site for downloading brilliant quality movies and Tv shows which I download at my choice because of the comments I trust from others, but dont give a movie 10/10 for audio and video, especially when it is not the case. My two cents worth ....but I should have known better that a cam will never be like a screener."

This one is centered and is the next best thing until an R5 or a DVD/Blueray comes out: 9/9 (for a cam). I wish more cams were this well done and distributed, bravo!

,stopngo,2010-03-19T06:05Z,"@charlesdickens
You do know what a TS is don't you?? It's a CAM either with a direct connection to the sound source or one that has had the sound source replaced with a higher quality one. The actual telesync definition is supposed to be a CAM with a direct connection but the dubbing is done a lot as well. "
,bajungadustin,2010-03-19T07:19Z,"@ charlesdickens 

Do you read the descriptions for the movie or do you just go around clicking links and downloading?

because it clearly says ""Alice In Wonderland 2010 TS XViD ""

So when you see TS that means it was recorded in a theatre... 

Also... its a common notion that when a movie is in the theatre still you are not going to get a Screener copy from a critic copy. that doesnt happen with every movie.. so generally when you want to see a movie thats in teh theatre you can either;

A- Download a lower than dvd quality TS CAM
B- Wait for the DVD release date and download the DVDrip
C- Wait for the DVD and go BUY it
D - Go watch it in the THEATRE

or... just plain dont bitch...

thank you for your time and have a nice day"

,Luxxxuria,2010-03-25T06:18Z,if it weren't for the random people walking across the screen every now & again i'd almost be convinced this was an R5. amazing upload. 10/10 for a TS.
,boiblu21,2010-03-25T08:08Z,"I don't know what movie these guys were lookin at when they rated it with 10/10, 9/9, and 8/9, this is clearly 4/5.  One of the worst i've seen.  Now im not one of those lames who complain about free stuff, My gripe is when ppl see a crappy movie and still say it looks good......STOP IT!!!  PS  Still appreciate your hard work raymondhome"

There's a few people passing in front of the cam here and there, but the picture is still great. The sound is good, but gets low at some parts. I also had to do a quick rewind in the middle because it fell out of sink. It got back into sink after the rewind. All in all, its a great copy. "
,missy0330,2010-03-30T02:19Z,Thanks for the movie will seed once it finishes downloading in a week...lol
,adell1979,2010-03-30T04:03Z,Something is wrong with the sound when I try to play this movie. The voices sound muffled and crackly. Is there anything I can do to fix this on my PC? From previous posts about A/V the quality is supposed to be excellent so it must be a problem just for me. Please help. Thanks!

,digmeup,2010-04-01T07:46Z,"Did anyone happen to have any problems with the new site called, KickassTorrents.com? Cuz I downloaded a movie called Coraline and my whole internet got shut down within a matter of minutes. Apparently when I called Cox, they said I performed a Security BREECH and that NBC held all the copyright infringement. So I say to all BEWARE OF THAT SHADY SITE! See what really happened is that after I downloaded it, I forgot to stop seeding, and someone within range hacked into my network and UPLOADED the damn movie! So they thought I did it!"

Then covert the movie wich with the program mentioned is pretty simple.
