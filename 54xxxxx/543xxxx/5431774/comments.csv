Have a great weekend! "

A clunker that travels 12,000 miles a year at 15 mpg uses 800 gallons of gas a year.
A vehicle that travels 12,000 miles a year at 25 mpg uses 480 gallons a year.
So, the average Cash for Clunkers transaction will reduce US gasoline consumption by 320 gallons per year.
The Obama administration claims 700,000 vehicles so that's 224 million gallons saved per year.
That equates to a bit over 5 million barrels of oil.
5 million barrels is about 5 hours worth of US consumption.
More importantly, 5 million barrels of oil at $70 per barrel costs about $350 million dollars.
So, the government paid $3 billion of our tax dollars to save $350 million.
We spent $8.57 for every dollar we saved.
I'm pretty sure they will do a great job with our health care, though."

Typical."
,sonews,2010-03-16T05:01Z,"Conservatives are nothing more then a bunch of angry men who hate what America stands for.  Plain and simple.  If you hate America,  go to Iceland.  A country that used Reagan's teachings to destroy the whole country."
,booboo332,2010-03-16T05:37Z,"Bullshit.  The lion's share of anger and hate is on the left.  I am a libertarian, not a conservative and I am constantly sickened by the arrogant elitism and bigoted venom some liberals and progressives unabashedly display towards conservatives.

There are several issues that I disagree with conservatives on strongly but I find I can engage them in an actual discussion about them.  With liberals, I find that their discourse usually devolves into emotional ranting.  As per usual, both the comments of trickdaddy and sonews today fit this trend."
,sonews,2010-03-16T08:59Z,"@Johannes58 

The 1.2 trillion dollars spent by the republicans through reconciliation to pass the bush tax cuts for the top 1% saved us how much money?  I'd like to hear your math on that one..."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-16T11:16Z,"Attack the messenger instead responding to the message.

Typical. you said...On the contrary I attack the message and messenger at the same time...We all know that the government wastes money(Dems and Repubicans) but what can any one of us do about it...Nothing...So when Johannes58 says that money is always being wasted he/she is telling us something we already know...This will not stop HealthCare...I mean explaining that Government spends too much is too easy...Government will always spend too much...Its not their money...END"
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-16T11:28Z,"Lol...sonews makes a comment about conservative and the response is to say that it is ""bullshit""...Now if someone says something I dont like I could just say ""bullshit"" and use myself as a reference...Pretty convincing argument...END"
,booboo332,2010-03-16T18:27Z,"And ""next you will tell that the world is round not flat"" is a compelling argument?

You demand others back up their statements, accusing them of ""pulling them from their asses"" when you are the one most guilty of what you claim.

Keep trying, tricky."
,Mhockey1505,2010-03-16T19:01Z,"@trickdaddy

i usually read the comments, but had to register for this one.  In your argument you said ""I mean explaining that Government spends too much is too easy...Government will always spend too much...Its not their money""

Is there a greater case for smaller government?  Money in the pockets of the richest 1% created more jobs than the government spending could ever dream of.  If they don't reinvest it in their own business, they're spending it on schooling (paying teachers salaries), a big boat/house/tv (paying salaries for people to BUILD those things), investing it in other businesses through loans, or even giving it to charity (where it won't be skimmed by the government)."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-17T05:02Z,"""compelling argument?"" you said...No argument here...We agree that Government spends too much...I just pointed out why people should not assume what others are thinking because you make an ass out of yourself...END"
