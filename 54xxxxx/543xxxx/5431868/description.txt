Atomic Rooster were an English progressive rock band, comprised of former members of the Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Throughout its history, keyboardist Vincent Crane was the only constant member, and wrote the majority of their material. Their history is defined by two periods, in the early 1970s and the early 1980s. Their genre in music is difficult to define, since they went through radical changes in very short times during the life of the band. However, their best-known era represented a more hard rock/progressive rock sound, exemplified by their only hit singles, "Tomorrow Night" (UK no. 11) and "The Devil's Answer" (UK no. 4), both in 1971.

Nice 'n' Greasy is the fifth studio album by British rock band Atomic Rooster. It was retitled Atomic Rooster IV in the US, as their first album, Atomic Roooster, failed to secure a US release, making this album the fourth album instead of the fifth. The US version also had a somewhat different tracklist to the UK version.
