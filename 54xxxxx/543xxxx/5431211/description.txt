The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It (1977)
Running Time: 55 min.

John Cleese  
Connie Booth

The Strange Case of the End of Civilization As We Know It is a spoof of the Sherlock Holmes detective series, as well as the mystery genre in general.


Cleese's performance is reminiscent of Basil Fawlty, with Arthur Lowe's Watson standing in for Manuel, although Manuel of course was not the blithering dolt this sidekick is.  This show aired once or twice in the US, and many critics regard it as the least of Cleese's works, citing flat humor, low budget, and ethnic references which may be inappropriate by modern standards.  The last has probably received the greatest assault in dismissing this movie, yet the original Monty Python series had far more racially-charged material.  


All in all, even if this is not the best work that John Cleese ever did, it is still John Cleese. And that alone puts it head and shoulders above 99% of the rest of what passes for comedy these days.  So there.
