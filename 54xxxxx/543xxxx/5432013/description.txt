Brainiac has set his sights on destroying Earth and finishing off the Last Son of Krypton once and for all!

This hard-hitting story features the return of the pre-Crisis bottled city of Kandor, as well as revitalized Brainiac and set the stage for the storyline "New Krypton." 

Written by Geoff Johns, with Art by Gary Frank and Jon Sibal.

The penultimate issue of the series, Action Comics #869, was recalled at the retailer level by DC Comics for cover content. The original cover depicted Clark and his adoptive father outside the Kent farmhouse apparently holding what may be beer.
DC issued a statement to retailers that the issue was recalled, and that any copies featuring the original cover be destroyed. The next week, DC reprinted the issue featuring a cover in which the label on the bottle was changed to read, "soda pop." This was the second such instance of censorship invoked by DC that month, the first plaguing issue #10 of Frank Miller and Jim Lee's All Star Batman and Robin for insufficient censorship of profanity within the issue.
