All subtitles are from the original retail DVD.

Personally, I can't hear a big difference between AC3 5.1 and DTS 5.1, but then again I don't have an expensive sound system. the DTS audio track is 720 MB and the commentary tracks are 89 MB each. The picture quality would be noticably lower with the DTS sound track. 

Anyways, actually I didn't make this ISO originally to be uploaded here, I made it to burn a copy on a DVD-r for my brother. I thought I might as well upload it here, since it's already on my hard drive."
