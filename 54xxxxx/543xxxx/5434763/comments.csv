Good flick for real, but the creators are sadly stuck in the phony baloney Left vs. Right Paradigm....

Otherwise good stuff"

Actually the guy who wrote and made this DVD is not a right vs left guy. Mike Church on Sirius/XM Patriot Channel constantly gets upset at his own listeners for thinking that Rep's can fix what Dem's do. He teaches true paleo-conservatism/Classical Liberalism not any of this phony neo-con stuff. He was the guy who introduced me to Ron Paul the most anti-establishment Republican since maybe Coolidge. One of his favorite sayings is for people to stop falling for the coke vs pepsi, Yankees vs Red Sox, Left vs Right, Dem vs Rep arguments, both parties are in it together. Listen to him sometime if you have Sirius/XM I think its channel 144 and he's on real early now because of Glenn Beck. Mike Church starts at 6am - 9am est."
