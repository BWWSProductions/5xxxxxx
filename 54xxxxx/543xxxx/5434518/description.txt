Here's an interesting one for documentary fans...

Just for Kicks (2005, documentary)

Color, 1.33:1 (original aspect ratio), 81 minutes.  Decent transfer, and sound is in sync!

An energetic hip-hop-themed documentary regarding the popularity of athletic shoes in various US subcultures.  Covers the history of athletic shoes, their rises and falls in popularity, the shoe collector scene, and more.  Quite interesting as a sociological study or for an aspect of corporate/brand marketing, even if one is not into hip-hop, breakdancing, or graffiti.

It's definitely not as self-conscious a documentary as many subculture documentaries I've seen; while there is a conscious style to the film, it's not concerned with style over substance... instead of stylish and time-wasting wipes, fades, and graphic embellishments, the focus is on the interviewees.

Oddly enough, it's a French co-production.  Maybe that explains the focus on content.

Seeding on a standard DSL line, give this one a while to fully propagate!
