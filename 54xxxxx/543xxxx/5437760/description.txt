PLEASE COMMENT AND SUPPORT THIS TORRENT IS LEGIT

FUDGESOCIETY NOTE
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I'm personally not a fan of Live albums, and greatest hits. Because it's honestly redundant. Why have more than what you need unless you're a die hard fan. And if you're a die hard fan of a band, you wouldn't be torrenting their music. You would be supporting and buying, which I still support for every band album I upload. I promote torrenting, seeing if the band is good, then going out and buying the album. In no way do I promote the soul use of my torrents without intent to buy the album. Don't ruin the internet for us, these torrents are just a way to see how a band sounds, and find any missing tracks that you might not have.

Thank you and please seed. The support of my torrents, will greatly increase the amount of uploading I do. More seeds, more torrents, more smileys! :D
