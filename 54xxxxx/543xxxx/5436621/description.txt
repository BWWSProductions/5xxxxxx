Rx NOTES
-----------------
Source: OUR OWN NTSC DVD5
Work: Not the greatest quality source but we've done what we could with it.
Blurred timer, sharpened, denoised, etc.. Sample included.
Such a long movie, we opted for a bigger file size for a better bitrate.
Sized to work on all standalones and fit on a 2GB flash drive. Enjoy. =]
