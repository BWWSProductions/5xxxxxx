This is a fantastic movie adapted from Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhya's short story. 


The characters are real, and define their roots themselves. Most of the people who acted as village people did their job well but I personally feel that putting on the "village accent" would have done miracles.

The director's work was clearly visible and incorporation of certain insignificant yet beautifully crafted elements made this work, if not masterpiece, a real enjoyable one. 


I won't reveal anything about the storyline but if you really want to enjoy this movie PAY ATTENTION to the songs of Rabindranath Tagore. esp. the last one - it's so meaningful and fits (I'll rather use the word blends) into the movie. I'm sure the viewer will like the movie.
