,bilocan,2010-03-21T19:39Z,im having trouble downloading this torrent. i installed first 2 parts but this one is not working could you upload it again?
,knoxbox,2010-03-22T11:42Z,"there is nothing to install... these are in cbz format if you read the about cbz.txt file it'll explain what that is and how you view these files... 

look into programs like comic rack or cdisplay, just google them. then open the files with either of these programs to view them.

or if you want to be arbitrary you could always just change extension from cbz to .zip or .rar and uncompressed them and look at each image individually but that is rudimentary viewing at best."

,bilocan,2010-03-22T20:29Z,"i already downloaded part 1 and 2 of c.a. and they work fine but i cant download part 3,maybe uploading it again could work"
,knoxbox,2010-03-24T11:19Z,"i have 18 seeders without a problem... and your wanting me to reup for one person... if these 18 other seeders had a problem i wouldn't mind.

try downloading it again, cause no one else is having the same issue, try using a program like VUZE or utorrent. limewire is just shit."
,bilocan,2010-04-05T13:16Z,"i did it now, ty bro i agree that limewire is shit compared to utorrent"
,boxman0,2012-02-29T00:19Z,Just trying to get Death Vol. 2 onwards so seeding those would help very much... Currently connected to 3 Peers and 0 Seeders
