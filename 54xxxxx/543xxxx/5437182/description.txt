THE ALEX JONES SHOW

Alex talks with film and video director, producer, and musician Kevin Booth. Booth's film, American Drug War - The Last White Hope, has won three consecutive awards for "Best Feature Length Documentary" and was featured on Showtime. In his latest film, How Weed Won the West, Booth traces the fight against Federal drug regulation in the State of California. He interviews radio host Alex Jones, former drug dealers, real-life gang members, legal-weed pitch men, activists and advocates to find the truth. Alex also talks with author, historian, and journalist Webster Tarpley. Tarpley is the author of 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Obama - The Postmodern Coup: Making of a Manchurian Candidate, Surviving the Cataclysm: Your Guide through the Worst Financial Crisis in Human History, and Barack H.
