Those who are reading this far probably know the connection Sean Delaney had to KISS.

Just in case:

Now, upon revisiting the album wiki page, I noticed that the release date is 1979, but the tags, reading 1978, are based on the original source where I found this. My apologies.

All of this aside, I would say that this is for die-hards and KISS completists. Although Sean Delaney shared many co-writing credits with KISS, this album has this listener questioning the extent of his involvement with the various members that share credit with him. You be the judge.

Not my rip, but apparently this is a vinyl transfer, as the album has never been issued on CD.
