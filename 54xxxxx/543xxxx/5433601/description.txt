Ernan Lopez-Nussa - Delirium
1999

His extraordinary CD "Delirium," which is difficult to come by in the U.S., points to a pianist who communicates in telegraphic bursts of sound, an artist who clearly prefers to hint at an idea rather than spell it out. The radical ways that Lopez-Nussa reworks everything from Wayne Shorter's "Footprints" to John Coltrane's "Count Down," the ingenuity with which he unfolds quirky original compositions such as "Lobo's Cha" and "Rumba Para Zapateo y Haydn" affirm that Lopez-Nussa is every bit as much composer-arranger as pianist-improviser.
