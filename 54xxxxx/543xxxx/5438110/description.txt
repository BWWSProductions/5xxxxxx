Terminator Salvation (2009) FOR MOBILE DEVICES THAT SUPPORT MP4/H.264/AAC 



                     **** -READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING THIS-****


1. This torrent contains THE FULL LENGTH VIDEO in MP4 format, ripped for MOBILE DEVICES.

2. THIS IS NOT A HQ FULLSCREEN VID FOR COMPUTERS!!!!!! It has been COMPRESSED for viewing on SMALL screens.

3. I have only tested this rip on 2 mobile devices (both support MP4/aac), SAMSUNG & iphone.

4. As far as I can tell, it should also be compatable with most mobile devices like PSP, ipod, and most cells
that have MP4 capabilities, and after looking online, MOST newer cell phones will play these files with no problems
and they use minimal space compared to other formats, like .3GP, ALSO  T-MOBILE SIDEKICK (LX) and BLACKBERRY COMPATIBLE!

5. I AM NOT YOUR TECH. Learn your device capabilities before you DL.

6. DO NOT ASK ME HOW TO's. The only advice I can offer, is the only way I've tried, which is:

 download file to computer

 open explorer

 plug in mobile device to computer

 drag and drop file from computer folder to device (SD or memory card may be required for file space 1-2 Gb recommended for
multiple files.) Each file can be between 140-250 megs depending on length, and resolution bitrate.

PLEASE NOTE: if you are using this for PSP, GOOGLE how to install, (unless you already know installation), 
because I did see online there is a sepecific way to do it, but the file (MP4) is compatable.

Here are the codecs...

Video codec: MP4v (H.264)

Video bitrate: 128 

Resolution: 320x240 <--MOST phones use this resolution SOME support larger, like iphone

Just keep in mind, I did make this for mobile devices to SAVE SPACE, so the QUALITY is not at a high bitrate. HOWEVER I did also test
other files at a higher bitrate of 192, (which increased the file size approx. 100 megs), and it looks a LOT cleaner on my phone.

(Check my torrents for: 192 bitrate vid rips (about 250 megs or so) for mobiles, its the Hi-res I tested for quality)

I WANT INPUT from people who use these to see which types you prefer, the smaller-low res space savers, or the high-res bigger files. 

A 2Gb mini SD card can hold around 6-7 low res movies, or 3-4 High-res movies. I am just looking for input for future uploads, so all
feedback, and constructive criticism is welcome. Thanks for checking the movies out, and I hope they work out ok for you! 



If you Download this torrent, feel free to comment and let me know if it works on your device, TECH TIPS WELCOME
so others can DL it to use on theirs as well (or not...lol). and PLEASE DONT FORGET TO SEED THIS TORRENT! Its a small file
 so it shouldnt take long to seed it out so PLEASE give back to the community and SEED! Thanks, and of course, ENJOY!
