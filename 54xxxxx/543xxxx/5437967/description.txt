Note's: one of first
marley show's i obtained
threw snail mail tape trade , not
sure if that kinda tradeing exist 
today , seen's cd's are easy replaceing
tape's , also i belive that show is missing
2 or 3 song's, Positive Vibration ,Wake Up And Live 
and Them Belly Full. unfortunatly this show
as far as am aware or seen on exist in web in that
lame mp3 and no one wants that, lastly this
show , well i was told was one worst audio
show's from bob , but after transferin this
and listening too each song i dont belive that
is true , audioly it is poor for 1979 , but
hey you gotta mek do with what you have.
