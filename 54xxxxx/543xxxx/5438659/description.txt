Your dog ate the disk that I mailed you so here is the replacement files...I won't charge you full price for the replacement, but you owe me a beer next time I see you. and keep the damn mutt away from your computer.
Hopefully now that TPB trackers are on line this upload will work.

If you are NOT the person this is intended for, you will need the password to decrypt the files, as well as another password that will unzip them so don't waste your bandwidth.
