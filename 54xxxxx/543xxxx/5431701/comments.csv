,bj1604,2010-11-10T20:37Z,No where does it state that the film is in german. How do you upload this garbage?
,Gugle,2010-12-22T22:27Z,"German audio... Do not download.
How Germans (and many others) do it? They remove ALL audio from the movie, and then they insert their own. The result is terrible. Even basic sounds, like door closing, are improvised and usually out of sync."

I think some ppl need to show a little more appreciation, especially with TvTeam going to the trouble of uploading this classic British gangster movie in the first place. I for one, am very grateful. Cheers."
