  The film is based loosely around events in December 1995 that culminated
  in the murders of three drug dealers in Rettendon, Essex, UK. On 6th December
  Patrick Tate, Craig Rolfe and Tony Tucker, three drug dealers well known to
  the police, were lured to Workhouse Lane, Rettendon. There they were blasted
  to death with a shot gun while sitting in their Range Rover. They had been
  lured to their deaths on the pretext of a lucrative drugs deal. The three 
  bodies were found the following morning, 7 December 1995.
