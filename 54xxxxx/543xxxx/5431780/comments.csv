[V],Kuthumi,2010-06-09T11:56Z,"Thank you, fantastic quality, fantastic film! English subtitles are sometimes difficult to read because they change too quickly, but we are still happy."

,richardpa,2010-10-06T13:15Z,"Excellent copy and a quick download...
A/10 (English srt subtitles)
V/10
Great copy and an Excellent movie...
Many Thanx to ViSiON and to all the seeders for an Excellent rip...:)

@outs838 Why don't you just remove the srt files and play movie without them.... and if the subs are harcoded then just look for another copy!!!!!"
,peek3354,2010-10-11T17:51Z,"I have watched this movie before & loved it,  but i lost my copy. Now thanks to you icould watch it again. thanks"
,sonnihoney,2011-03-05T13:41Z,"It's not difficult to find your own sub in whatever language on google, open subtitles etc. so stop the whining! When someone makes the effort, and takes the risk to upload a film just out of pure unselfishness it's so depressing to get all these comments about bad sub. Don't be lazy and unappreciative! Get your own f***g sub!!!"
,omeezy500,2011-05-02T06:51Z,"DO NOT GET THIS RELEASE all! This is a daym good movie but VISION's subs not only interpret english bad, it doesnt tell the story correctly & is waaaay off! Nothing against Vision,the video & audio is good but sadly you'll miss the whole story & meaning of this movie w/ this release. There r better releases w/ accurate subs out there, I've had 3 versions "
