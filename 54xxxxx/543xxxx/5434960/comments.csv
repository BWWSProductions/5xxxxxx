Thanks.

,iComet,2010-03-14T23:03Z,"Is this real?
Does in include the hbo sports intro, anthems, interviews, and credits???
Btw, how was this ripped/recorded?
Thanks..."
,walkerneo,2010-03-15T00:56Z,And what exactly are we downloading that is almost 6Gib?
,iComet,2010-03-15T01:14Z,"GUYS...
This is definitely real. I just checked.
It's in HD, and starts off right after the hbo sports intro, includes anthems, interviews, and goes onthrough the very end.
Thank you, very much MagicPotatoe!!!

Please don't forget to seed. This seems like the only HD version for HBO out at the moment."
,BrokenEmpires,2010-03-15T02:17Z,"If any of you have problems watching HD mp4 or mkv files such as this one. 
And you already tried VLC media player then:
Download and install K-Lite Codec pack (Mega)
http://www.codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_mega.htm
It includes media player classic which is very light on cpu power.
If you have Win 7 make sure you enable the DivX H.264 decoder.
After install under tools folder open Win7DSFilterTweaker.
Change decoders from 'microsoft' default option.
That's the key to playing back HD videos. 
Thanks for seeding."
,BrokenEmpires,2010-03-15T03:15Z,"For the love of pirating.
Please seed.
If you want to keep getting free shit all you have to do is seed at least until you upload as much as you downloaded.

Cap the upload speed at 80% of whatever your upload speed is.
Then after torrent is done,
upcap to unlimited in upload then leave it for a few hours.
Don't be fucked up, you're getting a prestine HD version for free and all you have to do is leave your machine on for a few hours."
,BrokenEmpires,2010-03-15T03:19Z,"Theres over 3999 people leeching and only 217 seeding.......

And only 18 comments, and three of them are mine."

,wrgupta,2010-03-15T08:05Z,"I have seeded over 6GB of this already and am still at 83%. 

I have had 5.8GB of H264 files on Cotto Pacquiao before and the picture was awesome. I hope the picture quality of this one will be as great. 

I will be leaving my dedicated computer on for a whole week once download is complete, so I hope everyone do the same."
,saranghae,2010-03-15T08:07Z,go search mine only 300+mb name saranghae  and its hd 
,BrokenEmpires,2010-03-15T09:41Z,"Oh shit, heres a tip.
If you are using uTorrent.
Under Preferences>Bandwidth I set
Global maximum number of connections:500
Maximum number of connected peers per torrent: 500
And it helped with the speed.
I went from 1-2mbit to 3-5 mbit.
I have a 6mbit connection.
only 750kbps up tho :(.

I wish I had found that out 6 hours ago when I started downloading this torrent...........
Heres a forum of people talking about this.

,avatar8,2010-03-15T11:34Z,@mgicptato - Why 59.94 FPS? It should be set to 29.90 since this was recorded from NTSC HD broadcast. Can you please help correct the frame rate and upload again? I downloaded this video but it judders when I played it on my HD Media player due to incorrect frame rate. I felt like I wasted 24hrs downloading this torrent. It could have been perfect only if frame rate was set correctly.
,Evolfire,2010-03-15T14:57Z,"The Quality is Superb!!! Video and Audio are a 10+!! 
@Avatar8: Download the K-Lite Mega Codec Pack mentioned above, and I recommend using Media Player Classic Home Cinema. It's a free player and can handle anything you throw at it!!! It plays fine using WMP and MPC!! No hiccups or jitter at all!!"

,snuffy08,2010-03-15T16:19Z,why I'm stuck at 99.9% and my it freezes my bitcomet ... please help me out guys ... thanks in advance
,frequenzy,2010-03-15T16:37Z,"still waiting for the scene release, bitrate and fps is too high for a 720p"
,iComet,2010-03-15T21:33Z,"I'm through 55%
Video - 10
Audio - 10

This is the whole fight, intros and everything...
It's legit 720p"
,mgicptato,2010-03-16T03:18Z,"if you mean burn it onto a DVD that will play on a standard DVD player, yes you can, and it needs to be transcoded into mpeg-2 format first. most modern DVD authoring software will take h.264 video in mkv container, try tmpgenc or sony dvd architect. the format it is in right now won't play on a DVD player even if it's 2gb and fit on a DVD."
,wrgupta,2010-03-16T05:02Z,"10+ excellent video quality but at 59.94 FPS, still plays at slow motion even when loaded and played with K-Lite Mega Pack MPC. Also tried WMP it still plays in slow motion. 

I even converted this into MKV file into DVD NTSC format using Allok Video Converter and the results came out to be jittery, although picture quality remains superb. 

59.94 FPS is simply too fast, 29.99 FPS should've been more than adequate.

I even tried using Super DVD Creator, but Super DVD Creator is unable to recognize MKV files."
,mgicptato,2010-03-16T05:20Z,"it's not really the framerate, it's the bitrate that burdens the CPU, at 9000kbps you need a very fast dual core or a video card that supports hardware h264 playback. it barely plays on a laptop that has a 1.5 ghz dual core. anything less than that and it will drop a lot of frames or have audio sync issues. anyways, i'm done encoding this at 2000kbps, still 720p but expect a quite a bit of quality loss, i used msharpen filter to compensate for it but still not the same, size is around 1.4 gb"
,rugburn11,2010-03-16T07:03Z,"For everyone wanting to burn this to a DVD...here is all you need...
these are FREE 

tsMuxer  http://www.smlabs.net/tsmuxer_en.html
Imgburn  http://www.imgburn.com/

take the MKV file and dump it into the tsMuxer as a ts file...then add the ts file to IMGburn and burn it to a DVD...just that easy

or you could get convertXtoDVD  but this downgrades the Video file

enjoy"
,rugburn11,2010-03-16T07:07Z,"OH and if you just want to watch it on your computer...get KMPlayer
yes its free as well

http://kmplayer.en.softonic.com/

kmplayer will play back any file you can find...
yes even Blu ray files

find it
load it
use it 
enjoy it
KMPlayer"
,wrgupta,2010-03-16T09:04Z,"Finally got this video into DVD and is now playing correctly. 

I first converted this MKV file into MP4 using allok video converter (the conversion lost some picture quality but it's still good quality). Once got it converted to MP4, I used Super DVD Creator to convert it into DVD9 NTSC format. The DVD pictures still remains pretty good, DVD9 quality.

THANK YOU, mgicptato!"
,LanMax,2010-03-16T15:25Z,"Thanks. I'll just answer my own question. This is for real HQ video. I'm seeding, but with these people cursing and profanity is really not necessary. Only if I can choose whom not to seed to. 

Just plug your laptop to the TV via HDMI and enjoy the quality."
,wrgupta,2010-03-16T23:03Z,"ConvertXtoDVD is the best way to put this into DVD-9 or DVD-5 format.

I have tried other converting programs such as allok, Super DVD Creator I priorly mentioned and from my evaluation of the results, ConvertXtoDVD is the very BEST, it brings out crisp DVD-9 quality. And the good part with ConvertXtoDVD is that you don't have to convert the MKV file into other format in order for it to accept it.

Super DVD Creator, and NERO-9 is unable to recognize nor able to convert any MKV files; These two programs first requires you to convert MMKV files into files they could recognize in order for these programs to convert it into DVD. 

With ConvertXtoDVD it converts MKV files directly, very easy to use and the picture quality is crisp, near to the original picture quality."
