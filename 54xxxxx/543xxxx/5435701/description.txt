     Pointwise is a software solution to the top problem facing        
     engineering analysts: mesh generation for computational           
     fluids dynamics (CFD).                                            
     Quality - We designed Pointwise so users could be in              
     control, not the system. Whether your grid is structured,         
     unstructured, or hybrid, Pointwise uses high-quality              
     techniques with powerful controls so you can achieve              
     accurate and reliable results while reducing computer             
     resources required.                                               
                                                                       
     Flexibility - Pointwise offers the best of both worlds:           
     advanced automation, as well as flexible manual controls          
     for those times when only human intervention can create the       
     outcome you demand. It's the workhorse that gets you              
     confidently from dealing with less-than-perfect CAD to            
     formatting the grid for your flow solver.                         
                                                                       
     Service - Our commitment to your success is only beginning        
     with your Pointwise license. Whether you encounter a              
     technical issue or just need advice to get the most from          
     Pointwise, our industry-tested engineers are ready to help.       
     We generate more than just grids - we also build long-term        
     relationships.                                                    
                                                                       
     We have combined our reliable CFD meshing with modern             
     software techinques to bring you the eponymous Pointwise -        
     a quantum leap in gridding capability. In addition to the         
     high quality grid techniques we have always had, you will         
     appreciate Pointwise's flat interface, automated grid             
     assembly, and full undo and redo capabilities.                    
                                                                       
     Pointwise's well-organized and intuitive interface and            
     exceptional functionality give you the tools and the              
     freedom to concentrate on producing the highest-quality           
     grids in the shortest possible time. It's simple and              
     logical - meaning you don't have to get bogged down in            
     trying to learn or remember how to use the software every         
     time you sit down with it. But while being easy to use,           
     Pointwise doesn't sacrifice grid quality. Pointwise               
     provides the power to produce the highest quality grids           
     available. After all, your analysis is only as good as your       
     grid.

          got big projects that you can undertake, and with the        
          dongle crew you will be working in a joint effort to         
          find sollutions - preferrably complete emulators for         
          the different solutions.

          programmer that can develop a complete cracktro and a        
          update system for that particular cracktro. Experience       
          from the demo scene is preferred, but achievements that      
          can show your skills can also be accepted.                   
        * General programmer(s) - you will be recieving projects       
          that will range from everything from updating our

     You work as a engineer or something similar where you got         
     access to the latest software in the CAD/CAM area. Preferrably    
     with experience in the supplied software as testing your own      
     supply would also be required to ensure validity. We are also     
     interrested in people able to supply us software in the           
     GRAPHICS/MUSIC/PROGRAMMING area. One time suppliers are not       
     welcome, a steady base of supplies will be required.

     If you run a dedicated site, on a 100mbit link, a well            
     supported site that have at least 6 months of up-time and         
     decent affiliation. Then your site might be of interrest to       
     us. Do note that we do NOT accept site offers from the US, DE     
     and AT.

     First of all you should know that we do NOT release our cracks    
     so that you "the end-user" can benefit from it in the term of     
     using software or any other of our releases without buying        
     the required licenses. Linezer0 however believe that everyone     
     should have the option to backup their program/game and be        
     able to run it without any problems.                              
                                                                       
     Further we do NOT in any way condone the spreading of our         
     cracks, in other words we do NOT spread the releases to any       
     websites, P2P networks or any other public available location     
     and we urge that our releases should not be spread like that      
     at all.                                                           
                                                                       
     We -Linezer0- has nothing to do with the distribution of these    
     cracks, it is all done by third parties. As such, and             
     according to the laws where the individuals of Linezer0 reside,   
     it is not our responsibility what others desides to do with       
     these releases. However, let it be said quite clearly;            
                                                                       
       "We DO NOT in any way condone the selling or redistribution     
        of our cracks, this was NEVER our intention."                  
                                                                       
     Linezer0 does NOT take any responsibility of computer-loss        
     or any data-errors that may occur from using our cracks.          
     Keep in mind that you are using a third party sollution to        
     something we did not develop in the first place.                  
                                                                       
     Do note that the usage of our cracks are legal in most            
     countries outside the United States, IF and ONLY IF you own a     
     full copy of the program/game - then you may use our cracks       
     for backup purposes, and only that. It remains to be seen how     
     affected you are of the End User License Agreements (EULAs).      
     They can't supersede domestic laws, remember that.                
                                                                       
     According to the "DMCA ACT" in the Unites States, you have no     
     rights to circumvent a copy protection. Beware, they will         
     punish you harder than if you stole the shrinkwrapped software    
     in a mall. Though Linezer0's base of operation does not reside    
     in the Unites States, and thus we are NOT bound to the            
     US legislations like:                                             
                                                                       
        * No Electronic Theft Act                                      
        * Digital Millenium Copyright Act                              
        * The Patriot Act                                              
        * <other US legislations>                                      
                                                                       
     You should ALWAYS buy the software that you do use, or find       
     suitable Open Source replacements (as there are loads), we do!

      to the written agreement above, and thus the responsibility      
           regarding whetever you are affected by any EULAs is
