,hakuna_matata,2010-03-13T03:38Z,"Hey

once I am done.. i will post the comment on the rippping, but rest assured I am glad just for the effort you made bro. I have posted reply at previous page itself read that.

for codec: dont use XviD, it was good but now with H.264 we get better results at low bitrates. VP70 isnt that popular but equaly good .. give it a try. just search on google how to rip properly using H.264 video codec and make mkv container files you will be surprised with the results. thanks for reading.

Regards
"

What a great relief to have you around!! I really hope you will keep up throughout the season. This year is going to be tremendously exciting. So you can become a real hero for all the real fans out there...!!!"
,importmonster,2010-03-13T09:51Z,"CellorDoor-san!

Thank you so much! We are watching your practice1 upload atm. We are 15mins south of Suzuka Japan. BBC coverage is world best by 10000%. Cant watch any other coverage! Without a BBC upload our F1 season is.... please keep up the good work!"
,hanzaki,2010-03-13T11:24Z,"Well thanks CelloDoor for the effort, I really appreciate what you're doing!

Unfortunately it's still runs around 19 FPS (the actual framrate), which is not to good especially with a fast moving sport like F1 :)
It's really hard to watch this way, not really enjoyable after a short period of time.
Please try to stick with (at least) 25 FPS.

Thanks!"
,lburgguy,2010-03-13T13:49Z,Thanks for the effor Cellordoor but the framerate is almost unwatchable.  
,lburgguy,2010-03-13T13:50Z,Darmeth where are you???
,Trace-Elliott,2010-03-13T15:21Z,"Thanks CellorDoor, I couldn't watch F1 without your help (french coverage is a bad joke)
I hope you can manage to cover the whole season!
Thanks again!!!"
,mathias921,2010-03-15T13:03Z,Learn how to upload or DON*T!
