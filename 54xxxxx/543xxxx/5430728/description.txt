Holmes is re-acquainted with Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams). She offers him a sum of money to pursue a case of a missing red-haired midget by the name of Reardon. Holmes disguises himself to find the identity of Adler's employer, but can only surmise him as a professor. Three days after Blackwood's execution, his tomb is found shattered, from the inside out, and an eyewitness reports seeing Blackwood walking away. Holmes, Watson, and Lestrade find Blackwood's coffin contains the body of the red-haired midget. Holmes follows clues from a pocketwatch on the body to the midget's home, where they discover several chemistry experiments. They narrowly avoid capture by three thugs that have arrived to destroy the evidence in the home, but subsequently are arrested for property damage. Watson is released on bail by Miss Morstan, while Holmes is taken to the Temple of the Four Orders, an occult-dabbling secret society. Their leaders reveal Blackwood was a former member, and plead for Holmes to help stop him. Holmes declines their generous offers of reward but continues to investigate. As Holmes and Watson investigate, the two senior members are killed through apparent magical means by Blackwood, and he assumes control of the order, desiring to use the Order's power to push for England to retake the United States after their civil war has weakened their defenses. Blackwood orders the Home Secretary, a member of the Order, to issue a warrant for Holmes' arrest.
