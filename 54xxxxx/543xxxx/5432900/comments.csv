,adv_200,2010-03-13T16:22Z,"i agree with rod, predvd is and always have been a screener. this one isn't..it's a T/S with above average quality.

i prefer direct rips so i couldn't watch and ruin the movie for me.. i'll wait"
,ohoho,2010-03-13T19:31Z,"cam or screener, same shit....."
,ohoho,2010-03-13T19:35Z,"wtf predvd?... DVD not a quality, DVD is a capacity.."
,GPB2008,2010-03-13T20:11Z,"Ok First & Foremost...

@rolly20 ... A PRE-DVDrip, Would Be A ""Screening"" Of The Film, Maybe For critics, awards voters, video stores, producers and distributors. Also They Have Extra Crap On The Films.. These extras includes timers, scrollers, black & white scenes, logos and serial numbers.

This Release Was Filmed With A ""CAMERA"" in a Theater Thus Being A CAM...

If You Edited The Video to Make it Look Better, Thats Fine & Dandy, Thanks Homey.. But Its STILL Just A CAM!!!

Here Are The Screenshots For Rolly20's Release!!
