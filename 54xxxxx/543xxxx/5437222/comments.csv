,VelvetMirror,2010-04-10T15:53Z,"Thanks, this movie looks promising.

In the beginning of the movie the japanese audio it's solaped with english audio, it's that on purpose on the movie?"
,darkmind35,2010-04-18T22:15Z,"Downloading this ATM. I expect it to be a good release as I also downloaded your ""The girl Who Leapt Through Time"". :)

Btw why not just have the .srt file inside the torrent?"
,skutts,2010-05-04T03:03Z,Theres no sub for cd2 on the opensubtitles page. Can you please provide?
[V],-jonny-,2010-05-09T02:03Z,CD2? It's all one file mate (and there are no CDs involved)...
