,sunbleached,2010-03-21T01:23Z,"any other backup game I've downloaded has always included a .dvd file - I'm wondering why this one doesn't have a .dvd file..... will it still burn and run properly?

I know....""noob"".....sorry if its a stupid question...."
,moous,2010-03-21T17:38Z,"Just run it through ABGX and it will make the dvd. file I didn't include it as I always like to run all my games through ABGX myself to make sure they are stealth patched its the safest way and gives piece of mind 
If you don't have ABGX360 just type it into google download it and run *ALL* the games you download through it"
