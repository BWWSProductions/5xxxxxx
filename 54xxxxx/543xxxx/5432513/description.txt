NEON NIGHTS sets a standard against which all other films must be judged. CECIL HOWARD (the man behind FIRESTORM, THE LAST X-RATED MOVIE, PLATINUM PARADISE, SNAKE EYES, BABYLON PINK, etc.) has given us a hot hard-core odyssey into the phantasmagorical mind of a troubled girl. He illuminates the blue-movie screen with all the tour de force of erotic invention. In bed, bewitched and motionless, Sandy is levitated in a remarkable sensual special-effects sequence that must be experienced. The bizarre storytelling reaches its carnal climax with a steamy, Fellini-esque orgy in which flashing lights, billowing smoke and blissful faces all merge in a veritable celluloid bacchanal in which she gets thoroughly ravished. Visually there has never been an X-rated film like NEON NIGHTS.
