A review of the CD:
The thing about political punk rock is that most of the time it's really bad, conceived by earnest yet immature left-wing kiddies and kindled with half-understood philosophies cobbled together from watching Michael Moore docs, leading to music that bears that disagreeable "lecture" feel. Thankfully, Montreal's Humanifesto, while overtly political, bring some real ruckus to accompany the politics on their debut disc. And if that wasn't enough, they take a monstrous shot at overzealous and sometimes-embarrassing lefties like Moore (Michael Moron), proving that these guys don't feel the need to thrash along party lines.
