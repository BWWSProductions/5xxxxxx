Final Fantasy XIII: The Complete Official Guide

Format: Search-able PDF
Size: 163MB
Pages: 260
Scan Res: 300 DPI

This is not an eGuide; this is the result of scanning the physical guide page by page at 300 DPI, then using Adobe to convert it to a search-able PDF.  OCR is not perfect, so the functionality of search is somewhat limited
(OCR incorrectly recognizes some words, so searching for them yields no results).

To compensate for the OCR errors & the simple table of contents in the guide, a more
elaborate index was created using bookmarks (complete with expandable categories) 

If you look closely, some of the artwork has a bit of a white, grainy look -
this isn't due to the scan, that's just how the pictures are in the guide.

Special thanks to Piggyback Interactive for creating the guide and to gamegotme for taking the time to scan each page.
