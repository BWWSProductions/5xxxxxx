Alex talks with film and video director, producer, and musician Kevin Booth [hour 3]. Booth's film, American Drug War - The Last White Hope, has won three consecutive awards for "Best Feature Length Documentary" and was featured on Showtime. In his latest film, How Weed Won the West, Booth traces the fight against Federal drug regulation in the State of California. He interviews radio host Alex Jones, former drug dealers, real-life gang members, legal-weed pitch men, activists and advocates to find the truth.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
