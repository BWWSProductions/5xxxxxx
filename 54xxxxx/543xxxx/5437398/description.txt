  It's the ultimate city, packed with 8 million people and overgrown   
  with skyscrapers. But before this land of glass steel and concrete   
  sprouted, New York City was home to alien worlds and strange         
  creatures stretching back over many millennia. Eight-ton             
  elephant-like mastodons walked down what is today 5th Avenue, and a  
  sea turtle bigger than a compact car swam directly over Midtown      
  Manhattan. The Big Apple still bears the scars of a time when it was 
  obliterated by a titanic glacier, and it sits on the site of a       
  200-million year old volcanic catastrophe. This is also where some   
  of the world's first dinosaurs walked. And although it enjoys views  
  of the Atlantic Ocean today, New York City was once in the middle    
  of a vast desert continent. No matter the era, it's been the center  
  of the action throughout the history of our planet.
