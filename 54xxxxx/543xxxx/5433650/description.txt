Teen Island star Justin Bieber's newest single, "Baby" featuring Ludacris is the
newest single from his forthcoming album, MY WORLD 2.0.

Justin just appeared at the 52nd annual Grammy Awards telecast on CBS-TV and
joined fellow Def Jam artist Rihanna and an all-star cast of NFL players at the
Pepsi Super Bowl Fan Jam LIVE concert in South Beach televised on VH1. MY WORLD
(released November 17th) crossed the RIAA platinum plateau in just seven weeks,
for U.S. sales in excess of 1 million units. The album contains his premiere
quartet of Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 hits, "One Time" (certified RIAA platinum),
"One Less Lonely Girl," "Love Me," and "Favorite Girl." Justin is the first solo
artist in history to send four songs from a debut album into the Top 40 of the
Billboard Hot 100 prior to his album's release.

Now plans call for MY WORLD 2.0 to be issued on March 23rd. "Baby" is the first
new track to be released from that upcoming CD. Meanwhile, Justin has surpassed
100 millionvideo views (the first 50 million of them as an amateur
starting in 2007, posting renditions of his favorite hip-hop and R&B songs).

Born in Stratford, Ontario, Justin Bieber is a multi-talented pop/soul singer,
and a self-taught musician on drums, guitar, piano, and trumpet. His manager
Scooter Braun introÐ¼duced Justin to the music industry in Atlanta two years ago.
There he met multi-platinum superstar Usher, who signed the 13 year-old to his
first professional deal and formed the RBMG joint-venture label with Braun and
Antonio `L.A.' Reid, Chairman, Island Def Jam Music Group.
