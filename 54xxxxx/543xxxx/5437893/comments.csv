,Madrig,2010-05-14T06:21Z,"Perhaps its a bit small looking, however, I've idolized Weird al since I was a kid, and the files seem to be accurate, I've bought the same Tapes, CD's, movies, everything multiple times, but with a house full of kids, its kind of hard to keep anything in one piece.

Thanks for the upload. Once I finish downloading I'll seed it as long as I possibly can. I believe everyone should have a chance to listen to his music, and watch his recorded concerts if you can find them, at least once."
