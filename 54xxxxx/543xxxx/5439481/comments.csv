,vivatpb5776,2010-12-10T01:51Z,"Finally, a version of this movie with hardcoded subs. The video is not the best DVDRip I have seen but it is good none the less. The one issue I noticed was that the audio was slightly off in the beginning but it adjusted itself shortly thereafter.

Overall:
Audio: 8/10 (5.1 with hard coded subs)
Video: 8/10

Thank you uploader."
,azer000,2011-01-03T11:40Z,"I don't want to disappoint you, but the audio is stereo..."
,vivatpb5776,2011-08-07T11:09Z,"Audio Stream
    Wave Type: 85 - MPEG Layer 3
    Avg. Bitrate: 114,92 kbit/s
    Sample Rate: 48000 Hz
    Bit Depth: 0 Bits
    Channels: 2


My apologizes for not catching this the first time. Yes, this is indeed stereo; however, that does not take away from my desire to keep this version. Again, thank you uploader."
