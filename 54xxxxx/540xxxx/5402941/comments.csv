,daddie05,2010-10-05T06:01Z,So is the specials on this game still a messed up?  Thanks guys...
,purcell117,2010-10-22T04:30Z,"help please.. i finished downloading the game, but it say ""this application has failed to start because d3dx9_30.dlll was not found..... please reply back asap... "
,gl3nnie,2010-12-26T00:23Z,"@falcongun/purcell117
you two just haven't installed direct x"
,p1gp3n,2011-07-16T06:58Z,"The ""small fix"" is unnecessary. Just delete the demo mission files once you applied the crack. You can still delete the censor images, or replace them with transparencies, but you don't even need to do that... Still, Powermoves aren't functional. I might just buy it tho. The game is hilarious."
,p1gp3n,2011-07-16T07:00Z,"Actually, meant to post for http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5400091/BoneTown-PL09YiSO"
,hristingur,2011-09-07T20:37Z,"Game freezes when i go to sandbar, also freezes often when i go from the iland where the ppl cant talk and i go from there to home island, so i'm just going to buy the game, not much money to lose."
,hcobain,2011-11-20T22:11Z,Does this works ?
,Cerebral222,2012-02-13T12:37Z,"I had no issues with this game, & I put it on 3 different computers, 1 was a old 2007 laptop, no sound or freezing problems, it goes to show that how you set-up your pc, impacts on what you can soundly do with it. Thanks globeplus, +1 from me."
