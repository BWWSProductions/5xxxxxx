You could easily dismiss this band as another run of the mill NSBM band by their looks, but if you dig deeper, actually listen to their music, read the lyrics, and just get into this album, you will find pure fucking brilliance.

The music is punishing. From the pure, unrelentic assault of "Train Wreckage on the Underground Railroad" to the hooking, demonic harmonics on "Uncle Toms Cabin On Fire" - you know this is Black Metal like you have never heard it. Forget those riffs Euronymous wrote, Sir Reginald and Seamus DeVille cook up far better riffs. Check out the two songs I just mentioned, plus "Kall of the Kvlt Klux Klan" and "Abraham Lincoln, I Fucking Hate You" to see what I mean. The guitars are hard hitting, sonically menacing, and well-executed. High-rung harmonics can be heard, and there are alot of tremolo-picking sections. 

This is a release worth downloading no matter what your taste in music is.
