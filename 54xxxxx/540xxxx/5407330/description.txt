Jungle Legend is a 3D first person action game that takes place in the jungle. A strange disease is spreading through the jungle, killing the flora and turning the fauna mad. As an inhabitant of the jungle you have to find out what is going on. You spoke with the shaman of the ancient Malu tribe and learned of four magic stones representing the four elements. These stones can invoke the power of the ancients and restore balance to the land.

You start the game with only a knife, but throughout you will find many more weapons including a crossbow. Interaction is limited to walking back and forth, turning, using and switching weapons. Mad animals will attack you throughout your quest through jungles and ancient temples.
