2009 release from the British MC/producer. Tongue N' Cheek is undoubtedly the most upbeat album Dizzee has ever made whilst still retaining that lyrical sharpness that underlines his records. As well as three hit singles ('Holiday', 'Bonkers' and 'Dance With Me'), it features 'Road Rage', a thumping House track, and 'Dirtee Cash' which features a sample of a classic Stevie V tune. Shy FX, who collaborated with Dizzee on Maths + English, adds production duties to the carnival-esque, summertime anthem of 'Can't Tek No More' and Trance superstar Tiesto has provided the beats to 'Bad Behaviour', but it's 'Chillin' Wiv Da Man Dem' which is Dizzee's biggest departure to date: a classic, smooth-sounding R&B tune reminiscent of Tupac or Snoop Dog Dirtee Stank.
