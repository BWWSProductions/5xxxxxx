WWE/WWF Power Hour 

Do you like wrestling? Do you like drinking? 

If you answered yes to both then this is the power hour for you! 

This is a collection of some of my favorite WWE/WWF entrance music (quite a few late 80â€™s and early 90â€™s) with a few more recent entrance themes mixed in. Listed below are the songs that make up the power hour.
Enjoy!
