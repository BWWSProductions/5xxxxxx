[V],MKVGuy,2010-03-04T18:43Z,"@pluto999, I used a high-bitrate rip not a DVD and there were no subs with that file..
I hardly rip from a DVD because of my limited bandwidth but tries to arrange for a DVD, I mostly download 1.5-2.5 gig rips and re-encodes them to 400 mb with the help of x264 and ND.."
