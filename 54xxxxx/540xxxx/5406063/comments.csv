Thanks for all the Foghat so far. This is a really good album, although only tracks 2 & 8 match the song titles, all the others are mixed up. It plays in the correct order, just the titles that are wrong.
I think of you as my 'Healthy Listening' site as I get my 'Two-a-Day' each morning. Tomorrow I am expecting Zig-Zag Walk and Return Of The Boogie Men.
All the best, fendermental."
