,xiIix,2010-03-02T14:46Z,"Guys, disconnect your damn controller from your PC. Gamepad or wheel, whatever, just unplug it, then your mouse look problems will go away."
,xiIix,2010-03-02T14:47Z,"My problem is I'm getting CTD's all the damn time, and it simply won't stop no matter what. If anyone has any solutions (or the possible cause) for that lemme know."
,xiIix,2010-03-02T15:08Z,"Fuck this, I just preordered it two hours before release. If it still CTD's I'm just going to reinstall windows and/or find out what my hardware issue is. Because it seems to be a problem on my end. Damn parts always fail at the worst times, mm, but I guess that comes with the territory when you're running a Q6600 at 3.9Ghz. Fuck it."
,Blubs,2010-03-02T21:10Z,"same prob with mouse, only looks up to sky... cant move mouse around just looking up all the time"

,englen,2010-03-16T10:18Z,"If you have the ""always looking up"" problem, try unplugging your webcam.
That made the difference for me, no idea why, but the same thing worked in ""Dead Space""..."
,[SeriousDesert],2010-03-20T03:06Z,"ok so the download was fine, everything works but i seem to have the same problem as everyone else. I've unplugged everything so i literally only have my video cable my mouse and keyboard and my internet. makes absolutely no difference. 

I've noticed that if i move my mouse left it goes right, so possibly a problem with the axis?"
