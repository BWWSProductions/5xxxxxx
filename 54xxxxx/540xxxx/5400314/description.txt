Each deck has a pitch slider with a selectable range from +-8% up to +-100% You can pre-listen to the song using headphones through the rear-out of your 3d-soundcard, with a second sound card, by splitting left and right channels or by using ASIO drivers.

PCDJ DEX has a very advanced BPM detection that will help you synchronize your tracks. It's very easy to set a cue-point and start your song exactly wher you want. PCDJ DEX makes beat-matching two tracks easier by using the virtual record in order to speed a song up or down.
