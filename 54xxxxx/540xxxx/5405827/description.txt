As we brace for another wave of wintry weather in the deep South, we marvel at the blatant, almost proud ignorance of the regional dittoheads who build â€œAl Goreâ€ memorial igloos and snowmen.  Look Bubba, we know your hero Bush bragged about being a â€œCâ€ student and a drunk fratboy who went AWOL and racked up DUIs and never succeeded in any professional endeavor yet still made it to the White House, but do you have to embrace his anti-intellectual rally cry by tossing every scientific study out the window?  Okay, thereâ€™s no mention of global climate change in the Bible, but seriously â€“ the snow is a product of increased water in the atmosphere, as a result of increased evaporation, as a result of increased (wait for it . . . ) temperatures.  Wow.  Really not that difficult to grasp, unless youâ€™re a Fox â€œnewsâ€ fanatic.

While weâ€™re waiting for the snowfall tonight, weâ€™ll discuss the latest tragic earthquake, this time in Chile, the use of reconciliation to settle the health care reform matter once and for all, Obamaâ€™s plan for education reform, and the latest rounds of Congressional resignations.
