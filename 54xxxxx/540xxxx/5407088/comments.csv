Oh really was it boring? Which part was the most boringest for you? What message did you take away from this movie? Are you able to relate to any of the main characters - oh wait a minute I DONT GIVE A FUCK! 

Heres a fucking idea, why doesn't your opinionated ass just tell me what the video, audio quality was  out of 5 or 10 and how fast it downloaded than hit submit. I don't surf the TPB for film critiques  SO EITHER RATE THE GODDAMN FILE  OR SHUT THE FUCK UP! "
,fuwad84,2010-04-17T07:11Z,"uaef,

hey guess what I'm gonna do whilst your typing up your 3rd whiny lil comeback to blatant, unforgiving obviousness. 

V:8.5/A:9 Thank you extremezone for this extremely good upload.

gee, even between all the incest/rape I'm constantly having/committing, I still manage to find time to rate the media quality of this torrent that a fellow PB user worked so hard to upload and that other potential users care about. 

mabe you should manage your time better? Whining alot whilst getting nothing done is a terrible use of your time and last I checked people don't give a shit about what some shmucks dumass opinion about the story of a movie is. Theres places to go for that, here isn't one of them. "

Who knows. Weird."
,mcflan,2010-05-04T14:03Z,"Jesus Christ, would you cunts quit your infantile bickering? No one gives a rats if you personally liked the movie or not. All we want to know is how the quality/sound/etc is. If you want to regale the masses with your self-indulgent ""critique"" sign up at RottenTomatoes or something. Sheesh.

Thank you to extremezone for uploading. I appreciate it and will seed."

,medthief,2011-11-10T21:59Z,"fuwad is right. shut the fuck up about how good or bad the movie is, and stop spoiling the movie for people who just want to check comments before they download so they can see if the movie is quality ripped."
