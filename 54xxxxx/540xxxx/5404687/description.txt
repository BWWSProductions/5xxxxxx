Proper note:

SKIDROW uses direct calls to API in their crack, for example:

00402A34: E85565F47B                 CALL 7C348F8EH
00402A39: 59                         POP ECX
00402A3A: 6804404000                 PUSH 00404004H
00402A3F: 6800404000                 PUSH 00404000H
00402A44: E875F2F37B                 CALL 7C341CBEH

Because modules are sometimes loaded at a different memory base, indirect
jumps for API calls are required.
That is why IAT exists.

Game info:

Ghostly buccaneers Papa Doc, a vooju priest; Jane Starling, a lovely female
pirate; and Blue Belly, a bashful ships cook, must work together to discover
a way to reinhabit their bodies after being separated from them by a curse.
That wont be easy, however, as ghosts have only limited ability to directly
influence the world around them.

Pirates, Ghosts, Puzzles and tons of Humour: developer Autumn Moon
Entertainment is putting together a promising mix of gaming ingredients for
their new PC adventure game Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island.

All three playable characters recently turned into ghosts and are now looking
for chances to get back into their living bodies.

Being a ghost is a curse: they are now invisible and inaudible to the living.
Theres a lot more ghosts can take advantage of, but with that, the three
ghost pirates have also to deal with a lot of troubling hurdles: As ghosts,
for instance, they cant move physical objects, cant talk to living humans
and can sometimes struggle at other things we take for granted. However there
is a lot ghosts can take advantage of  their special ghostly powers more
than make up for this.

This mixture allows many innovative adventure gaming puzzles that will
challenge the players of Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island: How can you interact
with human beings, when nobody can see or even hear you? Are there other ways
to communicate with the living? Thats the kind of questions players are
asking themselves in order to solve the games puzzles.
