,JAC_69,2010-03-09T00:17Z,"Virus alert!!
And it's no false positive.
I recognise the difference between a false positive and a fucking trojan!
Nanosuit is right do not download!
And in the last six months is becoming hard to find a vitality crack clean.
I don't know what the vitality fuckers are doing but they are becoming one of the viruses best friends!
Open your eyes ppl!"
,kasdj,2011-02-26T15:31Z,"I didn't find any virus,not that there's no any. Installed game,cracked,everything works fine.. except that i can't play the game because:

This game isn't properly cracked. Your ""time freeze"" ability won't work properly due to the DRM. Basically when you try and freeze certain objects, they will immediately unfreeze. This includes the spinning signs near the beginning and more importantly, the vine which can't pass no matter what you do making it impossible to progress. We need a new crack essentially or at least a crack fix.
If you know any way to fix this,please comment"
