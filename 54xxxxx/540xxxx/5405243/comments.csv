THERE IS NO TINA TURNER ALBUM CALLED ""THE BEST!""

Is this one of Turner's ""greatest hits"" compilations?

One is called ""Simply The Best"" (1991) and there are three totally different versions of it; the original UK release, a USA version, and an Australian version.

The other is called ""All The Best"" (2004) and is available as a 2-CD album, or a single disc of highlights.

So... are you giving us an album (and if so, which one?) or just one song?"
