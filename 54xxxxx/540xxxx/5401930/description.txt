Iso2God v1.2.2 and God2Iso v1.0.2


>> A new version of Iso2God and God2Iso have been released.

KrK / Team 360h released a new app called ISO2GOD, a PC app for converting Xbox 360 ISO images straight into Games on Demand containers.
What's new/fixed:
+ New settings for padding removal mode and FTP port.
~ Low disk space confirmation replaced with status bar notification.
~ Fix for FTP upload progress.
~ Fix for FTP connection issue.

Rab released a new version of GOD2ISO.
What's new/fixed:
* Now works on god made by Iso2God (with XSF header) and some tools that produce gods without an XSF header. Some/all NXE installs (converted to god) have XSF header stripped and have incorrect offsets in them. I don't know how the xbox works around this, but if I find out I'll be able to add support for them too
