,dj801x,2010-03-13T03:28Z,Thanks dude :D can u maybe upload the .iso's for all discs? this DVD is total awesome.
,SystemFolder,2010-03-19T04:29Z,"For all those doubting because of the date it was uploaded, this is real. The audio for the episodes is in English and the audio/video quality is 10/10. Don't believe me, then download one random episode from this torent and see for yourself; that's what I did."

I only downloaded one episode to make sure it was good (I\'m re-downloading all 14 seasons of South Park, in order, one at at time; as of right now, my internet can\'t support more than one). However, when I get around to downloading this, I\'ll leave it seeding for a while. From what I\'ve seen, great torrent."
,darkside8,2010-08-03T22:34Z,Great Quality Thanks uolamer!!! I Was A Little Worried Becuse All The Files Where .RAR
,frailwordscollapse,2011-03-15T16:38Z,If this is a DVD rip does it mean it's the uncensored version?
,frailwordscollapse,2011-03-15T16:51Z,"Legit torrent. Amazing quality. I really just downloaded it cause I wanted an uncensored version of ""The Coon"", but thanks anyway!"
,domenicastolfi,2011-05-17T21:53Z,Seed!
