*For Elvis Week. #This segment was dominated by the stage presence
of Ken Kesey and The Merry Pranksters. Colonel Forbin doesn't meet
Icculus this time but rather finds "Ken Uncle Sam Bozo Easy Kesey".
At this time Kesey, dressed as Uncle Sam, appears on the stage and
accounces that the Bozos have been missing for two years but are
on Phish tour now. He calls one by one the Tin Man, the Scarecrow,
and Frankenstein (Phish breaks into "Frankenstein") to help him
find the Bozos, which soon appear as four white things in costume.
After singing about the Bozos which are doing interpretive dance,
the Pranksters all leave the stage after Kesey hears the "Bozo
Mockingbird". Trey comments that this is what happens "after you
do too much acid 30 years later..." Phish had been playing
background music (including McGrupp and Ghost teases) which had
developed by this point into a deep funk jam. Trey announces that
"we are supposed to start 'Famous Mockingbird', but the funk is
too deep." The band continues the funk jam and eventually segues
into "Camel Walk."
