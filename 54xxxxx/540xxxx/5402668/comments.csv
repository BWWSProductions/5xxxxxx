,Quantum12,2010-03-04T19:02Z,"For centuries now, people have been indoctrinated into the notion that competition is BENEFICIAL to the species. It's insane.

People actually believe that working against each other is the best thing for humanity. They are brainwashed into thinking that fighting for the same small portion of resources passed down from the top of the pyramid is the smartest thing to do.

How much longer will people be this stupid? When will they learn that the entire purpose of dividing us is precisely so that we can never rise to facilitate change? There is no trust because everyone wants the same jobs, the same resources and the same small percentage of wealth. Over 95 percent of the world?s wealth is owned by less than 1 percent of the population.

The answer to fighting crime isn?t to put more police on the streets. Crime can only be defeated by removing the inequality that gives people the incentive to commit it in the first place. Politicians know this but are trapped in the system just like everybody else. Political success requires massive amounts of funding to be pumped into campaigns and advertising. I assure you that the poor don?t pay for this.

When will people learn who their enemies are?

Did slavery end, or did it just evolve into something more nefarious and cunning?

I say wake the fuck up. It starts with you, America. Evil happens when good men do nothing. Capitalism must end or the human race will not survive.

P.S. There are three things you can do to help.

1) The system isolates people from one another by giving them conflicting interests from their competition. The way it hides this is by uniting the people in hatred of something else.

Unity is everything provided we face the right enemy. Tell people who the enemy is. They will not believe you, so be patient and persist. Do not let ignorance destroy us.

2) Do not have anything to do with the military.

The military takes orders from the government, but the government takes orders from the banking industry. War is about profit because the system is a business and not a charity. The best way to convince men to fight is to make them want to fight. Think about it. 

Don?t fall for the jingoism bullshit. There are no great pieces of land, just great people.

3) Know your enemy.

The system that lets most people suffer in poverty and a few to wallow in self-indulgence because of bloodline or blind luck is the enemy. This is the same system the Romans used, and will end in the same way. The greed of a few is holding back evolution for the rest.

The heart of the enemy is the banking industry. The banking industry perpetuates debt and most horrifyingly of all, it keeps people static. It weighs them down with car loans, mortgages, personal finance, stock options, credit cards, overdrafts etc..... The point is to keep you in permanent debt, and therefore an employee of the bank until you die. Everybody works for the banks: the only difference lies between those that know it and those that don?t.

Strike the heart."

Quantum12-""For centuries now, people have been indoctrinated into the notion that competition is BENEFICIAL to the species. It's insane.""

first off your entire comment is telling people to not conform with one idea and place all your trust into this other one idea. in other words your idea is the other ideas competition.

there is nothing that can possibly be more motivating and forceful in the way of making people better then competition, and nothing can be more anti capitalism then doing exactly that. by there always being competition there will never only be one source of anything therefor no corporation and no organization will EVER posses the right to tell anyone that anything is mandatory. and this can only be possible through competition.

one example would be the monsanto company, because they created the roundup ready soybean which is now believed to now be used by 92% of all soybean growers in america they were able to capitalize on that market therefor giving them the rights to govern there product.

by having this power they were allowed to make it illegal to save seeds, clean seeds, or trade seeds between even your own family making it mandatory to purchase more seeds every year from monsanto.

the penalty from breaking these laws? infringement fines up to $35 000 aswell as losing rights to your property where you grew the unlawfull seeds for 5 years in order to eliminate any chance of you repeating the offence. capitalization in its crudest form

now why are 93% of soybean growers using these seeds, because there is no real competition for monsanto, and public seed stock, which is the seed that your allowed to harvest annually and clean yourself is now virtually empty.

this company only got this powerful because it had, has, or will have nearly no competition in the future, so back to the reason for this epic post 


Quantum12 at 2010-03-04 19:02 CET:""I say wake the fuck up. It starts with you, America. Evil happens when good men do nothing. Capitalism must end or the human race will not survive.""

competition must continue for capitalism to end and those under its tyranny be saved. capitalism will not go away when competition seizes to exist, it will only prevail.

,ouellette666,2010-03-08T20:21Z,near the bottom i mistakenly said 93% rather than 92% spare me the bullshit of having 20 people correcting me because i am well aware of the error and unable to correct it as far as i can tell
,burt64nyg1970,2010-03-15T08:25Z,"@ Quantum12........ While you sit at your desk and write you rants on a computer that was manufactured and sold under capitalism, Think about this, If Adolph Hitler Won, You wouldn't be sitting writing your bullshit! You would have been sent to one of the many camps! Be grateful you have a computer to scribe your nonsense on. Just post the friggen quality of the torrent! YA FUCKIN HUMP!"

,SoloLegions,2010-03-15T22:24Z,"Does anyone know what the quality of this torrent, is it fake, is it worth downloading?"
,zoggnoff,2010-03-16T11:21Z,Is it NTSC or PAL?
,habaneros,2010-03-16T17:08Z,NO PIC GOOD QUALITY AT ALL!!!
,LordNitro2008,2010-03-16T20:33Z,@ every one!! Why in the hell are you all talking about stupid shit like this in a message board about The Wolfman movie?? I dont get it lol. Talk about how the movie is. Whats the rating for this over 4GB movie? Most all suck so far from what i seen. Whats the rating on the A and V? For this size it should look like a blue ray version.
,LordNitro2008,2010-03-16T20:35Z,O and how in the hell do you use these files to make a DVD? i use ConvertXtodvd. I think you have to have only 1 file to make this work. If you cant then this is a pointless download. Make it a MP4 like the rest of the great blueray rips.
,zoggnoff,2010-03-16T21:25Z,"Blueray-shmooray, DVD Video is only capable of up to 720x480 NTSC & 720x576 PAL so no matter the source ConvertX would convert it to this standard anyways. Load your burner with a blank DVD, open up ImgBurn, switch to ""Mode>Build"" then ""File>Browse for a source folder"" locate and choose the VIDEO_TS folder, then set ""Output>Device"", choose your burner under the Destination drop box, adjust the write speed to 8x under the device tab (never burn faster than 8), optionally label the disc under the label tab, check to see that both ISO9660 + UDF is the File System chosen under the Options tab, switch to the Information tab click the calculator button and if all checks out press the Build button at the bottom and you're done.  for best results use high quality +R media if your device supports booktype bitsetting to ROM. If it doesn't then use -R as it's an older media and more compatabile with most players. ROM is the standard for retail DVD movies and your best bet. Taiyo Yuden or Verbatim are best, stay away from the cheap stuff."
,LordNitro2008,2010-03-17T19:29Z,Thanks thats some good info lol.
,LordNitro2008,2010-03-17T19:33Z,"O and the A and V rating for this movie i would say is.

A:6 i guess because its a cam

V:1 its not worth downloading if you like to make dvd's. Its a stupid cam video and its to dark to really see the graphics of the movie and most of the movie from what i ran through is mostly all dark so you cant see much of this dark blurry movie that is not worth downloading yet. If you think this looks good then your a noob to downloading movies. I think ill wait about 1-2 more weeks till i try a new download of it."
,Damgood,2010-03-20T14:26Z,Really bad cam version

,boichiha1,2010-04-04T22:25Z,such a disappointment... :-(( bad quality(((
,snowbirds,2010-04-12T11:26Z,"@Quantum12, i was shocked to find such clarity in the comments section of a cheesy movie torrent on the PB!  Where the hell did you come from? ;)

Anyway, I hope you already understood that you would be attacked for speaking the truth like this.  People can't help themselves; they have been brainwashed and you are saying things which will shake their minds free.  It is often a very messy process!!  That is why you get such negative reactions like you see here; the brainwashing doesn't leave them without a fight... 

However, I'm guessing you already know this...

Don't lose heart, Quantum12.  Keep speaking to the intelligence in people, and ignore the ignorant attacks they will make on you.  Even these ignorant folks want to wake up, but they are like wounded dogs who bite you when you try to help them.  Like the wounded dog, they can't help but bite you; our inhumane system forced them to give up hope in a good world long ago... 

Good work Quantum12.  Do not lose heart.  You are not alone.  Keep going for it!
