Blood Moon Rising is an amazing independent film set Ã
somewhere in California. The year is 1969. An ancient Ã
curse has spilled over into the world of the ordinary Ã
iving, with werewolves, vampires, and zombies shedding Ã
bucketloads of blood. In short, Tristan (our vampire) is Ã
not a bad guy despite his undead status, and he was in Ã
love with a girl named Lucy. Tristan's former wife, the Ã
daughter of the Devil, doesn't take the news of Tristan's Ã
love affair with Lucy very well, and she curses Lucy to Ã
become a ravenous werewolf roaming the Earth for all Ã
eternity...that is, unless a silver bullet pierces her Ã
heart and kills her. Lucy's death brings the daughter of Ã
the Devil back from Hell.
