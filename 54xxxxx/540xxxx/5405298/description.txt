V5.5 Changelog:

- Multiple opens for each race.
- Zerg and Terran opens have been re-written.
- AI has a delay before he scouts.
- AI should attack in larger waves and more often.
- Lots of balancing and tweaking!


What's comming in V 6.0:

- New state system, this will mean less AI stalling. The AI will make
complete use of his minerals. This should make him hard enough to warrant
different difficulty settings. He will also be using multiple, builds
and mixing it up a lot more.
