,GAZZA7745,2010-09-05T19:42Z,"Game does work perfectly but is quite hard to install (if you speak English). But it is not as hard as some I have tried. Here's how I did it.

After downloading and opening directory.



1. Start setup.exe in CD1 folder. Setup will start and game will part load.
2. It will ask you to start CD2 but will automatically bring a browse window up, and it will already be on CD1, so just click CD2 and then click on 'open'. Game will install fully then.


The problem with the initial setup is that it is not in English. Just use comon sense to start with as you go through the install. ie you know although it is not in English that it says NEXT, INSTALL, I AGREE etc. You will also (near the beginnig of the install) need to change it from Russian (or whatever language it is) to English. The rest of the install will still be in Russian, but the English version of the game will be installed.  

Good game. My son is playing it now.

Thanks uploader."
