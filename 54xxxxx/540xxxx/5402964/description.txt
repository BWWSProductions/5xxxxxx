Links.Extreme.PC.Game(djDEVASTATEâ„¢)


The black sheep of the Links family, this alternate take on the popular golf series created by Access Software was the first game put out in the series after Microsoft bought out the development studio.  Eschewing the realism and detail that the series is famous for, this title includes zombies, World War I biplanes and howitzer-balls, attempting to inject some fun and frivolousness into what is arguably the most serious of golf simulations available.


Product Warning!

Links Extreme (active ingredient: destroyamojochaosafan) is a radical solution made up of 61% golf, 18% testosterone, 16% trinitrotoluene, 4% shrapnel, and 1% a strange glowing object we found out in a field.  This is an experimental application which is not yet (and most likely will not be) approved by the FDA.  Links Extreme is highly volatile and should not be mixed with anything sedate or respectable.  Known side effects include: hysterical laughter, mouse-finger cramping, paranoia (the feeling that other golfers are trying to annihilate you), and the uncontrollable urge to play for hours on end.  Prolonged exposure to Links Extreme may lead to delusional behavior.  Some of the ingredients in Links Extreme (such as Deathmatch and Poison) are highly toxic and may trigger an allergic reaction in people who forget that golf is a game.  If you have no sense of humor, are pregnant, or feel uncomfortable with gratuitous violence, please consult a physician before using the product
