well forgot to read the fine print
hehhehe

[V],twentyforty,2010-03-01T19:31Z,"@htctouch: Why, does it make less ""awsm""? Movie has decent IMDb rating, regarding how new it is DVD... and quite stupid sounds complaints ""is so hard to watch and read in same time""... LOL, IMO even more stupid thing is to dub voices in domestic languages.

Few of the best movies I've ever seen have been non-English, and even if they weren't - have been already subtitled by movie-distributors. In short - I don't mind and I do not notice. However, I found enormously stupid some Polish voice-dubs, where ONE single GUY (in male voice, of course) read the lines of Michelle Pfeiffer... ROFL."

Viva a Portugal e ao Sporting."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-01T19:36Z,"@houruoha: Yeah, right. Like two times plus half (hint: subtitles, and that is something htctouch complained a lot, before...)."

well i recently saw District.13.Ultimatum in french .. i had no probs as it was an action movie

but this is a comedy movie , n its d way d things r spoken not the literal meaning of it i guess 
so for me a comedy movie is quite difficult to catch up d funny breaks n punches ..
if i sound stupid i guess im .. :) wt can b done .. lolz"
,lilars26,2010-03-01T20:01Z,Michelle Pfeiffer talking like a dude? I hope that was a comedy because that's just wrong.
