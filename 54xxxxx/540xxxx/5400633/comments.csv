,420therock,2010-03-01T16:51Z,which feed is this? American or Canadian?
,artvandelay2007,2010-03-01T23:01Z,"It appears to be a British feed; neither the NBC nor the Canadian CTV feed.  But the PQ is good and it's 1440x1080 H264 codec, so it's nice to have this quality available."
,artvandelay2007,2010-03-01T23:06Z,Update: it's the BBC Sport feed from DBS satellite
,hbc1980,2010-03-02T02:12Z,"its from BBC HD .TS H264 format 1440x1080
