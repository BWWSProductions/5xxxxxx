This crack is like the most anticipated ever and yet not many people r commenting on quality except for people i have seen on other torrents being called ""fake"". I just wanted people to start commenting more on the quality of this before i download it is all, cuz i really want it, but id rather not have my computer get fucked up from a virus or what-not since i need it for school.

,SnowKid32,2010-03-07T23:42Z,"Okay shitheads, since you're all fucking retarded and love to trash people for the way they reward you let me dumb it down for you. This is NOT a trojan. The programs code has a source code that works similarly to a backdoor worm/trojan but it will NOT harm your computer in ANY way. If you need AI maps, go to here for the ultimate mappack that includes a lazylaunch that will NOT mess up with the errors you keep getting about not having permissions. That happens because that version is old and wasn't rid of the kinks. 

Hopefully that works. Moreover, you open the packhack lazylaunch and browse to a map (I recommend always selecting Insane difficulty as they are never harder.) and launch it. Be sure to browse to one that says AI map! Then, if you see the race you like, either play or click ""return to game"" if it says ""VICTORY!"" If, for example, you are not the race you want, just click restart until you eventually do get it. That is all.

For maps that contain AI and for a good LazyLaunch go and download this:

,ShadowBoss,2010-03-30T01:28Z,"ALRITE...so, i hardly comment on torrents, because i just dont...however i love starcraft, and i want more people to get involved with the 2nd one... i can PROUDLY say this is a 100% working upload.

As the instructions already state in the nfo file. All you gotta do is

1: go into the lazy folder and extract the lazy launcher (this is a faster extract so do this first)

2: go back into main folder and extract the SC 2 BETA INSTALLER

3: once extracted...install the beta, and just LET IT PATCH UP, it'll do it on its own no login stuff required.

4: once its done patching up  (it'll patch a few times), dont click play, exit the installer (click the x at the top right). Go into the lazy folder, and start up the lazy launcher, go back to the main folder and load the ""AITest.s2ma""

5: once the game loads, click restart and bam you'll get to play, keep pressing restart till you get the desired race that you want. All upgrades and units are fully functional....Also you can go into the options and adjust the settings to what you want.....Impressive game.

Easy install...no more complaining peoples, it works."
,cazeract,2010-03-30T10:49Z,i don't know about anyone else but i found that if i let it patch past .3.0 something lazylaunch would just shut down on load. so as i saw it working on patch 4.0 something i exited and all worked great. though i should post something cause if it was a problem for me i probably will be for some else too.
