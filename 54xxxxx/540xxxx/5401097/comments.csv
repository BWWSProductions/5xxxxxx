,ddawg,2010-03-01T07:52Z,Wrong category... these are m4a's another lossy format :(
,FCCKiller,2010-03-01T19:29Z,"To ddawg:

These files are Apple Lossless files and they ARE lossless. m4a extensions are used for 2 different formats: AAC and Apple Lossless. If you look at the file sizes, you'll notice they are much larger than that if they were lossy AAC files and are equivalent to FLAC file sizes. "

,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-09-12T09:34Z,can someone convert this torrent to mp3 @ 320kbps as it does not exist yet? would be awesome. much more compact yet amazing quality
,morphevs,2012-01-10T16:02Z,"xxxchromaticxxx: I'm sooo glad that this is in m4a and not mp3, mp3 is lossy, and when you listen to songs with lots of hihats/tambourine etc. (lots of highs) you can hear that and mp3 file is lossy... but thats just my opinion. thanks watchitfoool!"
