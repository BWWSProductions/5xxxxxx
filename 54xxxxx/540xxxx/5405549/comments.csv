Just a question did you happen to record the program after the supercross called ""Four Legends"" (think that is right) on Reed, McGrath, Carmichael and Stewart?  If so could you put it up, dying to watch it.  Many thanks from Australia!!"

,zipper927,2010-03-04T00:37Z,"Thanks again slick, is there any chance you can put an Avi version on there, my computer doesnt play quicktime too good? Thanks anyway"
,slicknick610,2010-03-04T02:52Z,"@zipper927

Sorry man it is a lot of work and I am only going to post in one format. x264 has the best compression for HD video. There is someone else that posts in avi but doesnt have the high resolution. Try ffdshow codec or vlc player."
