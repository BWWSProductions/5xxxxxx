,freshtex,2010-03-01T19:51Z,"no, i don't think it would work, cause after jailbreaking you will have to get 3.1.3 appsync to go along with it for the unlock, you may have to downgrade your baseband if it has been updated, go to iclarified.com and look for help on downgrading your baseband if that is your case."
