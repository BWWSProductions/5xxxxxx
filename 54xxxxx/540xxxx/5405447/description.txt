The PROS

    * Slight upgrade in graphics quality over COD4
    * Slight upgrade in audio quality over COD4
    * Some objects in the environment are manipulative (eg. some destructible walls, exploding cars & barrels, breaking windows)
    * Excellent character and weapons design, great level detail (even in multiplayer) great environments to tie everything in
    * Decent single player campaign game play portions that helps the bad storyline
    * Excellent cut scenes to break up the campaign sessions
    * Spec Ops co-op mode addition that is a lot of fun and offers 23 additional levels that are different from the single player campaign
    * Future DLC material will probably build upon the Spec Ops co-op mode
    * A multiplayer experience that lets you easily find a game with random people and start playing with just a few clicks
    * A few new perks and changes in perks like Martyrdom and Last Stand that make multiplayer a little more bearable
    * Prestige mode included for those that enjoy replaying multiplayer for unlockable content

 
The CONS

    * There are limited audio options (eg. canâ€™t adjust levels for music, voice, sound effects)
    * Single player can be completed in as little as 5 hours on regular difficulty
    * Steam will manage all updates and changes to the game
    * Poor single player storyline that is not very clear and is mostly told through cut scenes or AI talking during bad times (eg. during intense fire fights, chase scenes, etc.)
    * The single player campaign is very heavily scripted which makes game play very predictable in some situations and requires you to play the game a very specific way to accomplish your objectives offering practically no replay ability
    * There is no leaning in the game to â€œpeekâ€ around corners or objects
    * The co-op game play is limited to only two players
    * Most multiplayer games modes are limited to 6 vs 6; some are 9 vs 9
    * Multiplayer generally seems to be laggy at least during some portion of any game
    * Multiplayer matchmaking does not always match geographic locations correctly
    * Multiplayer match making games are short due to the standard IWnet set time/score limit
    * Some multiplayer game modes are locked and can only be unlocked after â€œranking upâ€
    * There is a noticeable host ping advantage during multiplayer matches
    * A players ping is no longer shown as number but same as the console in bars
    * There is a noticeable pre-delay of issues when the current host quits playing and the Host Migration starts and you are sometimes kicked back to the lobby to find a new game
    * Some of the multiplayer maps seem to be too large for the amount of players the game supports which leads to pointless roaming in game modes
    * There are no dedicated servers and multiplayer games rely on IWnet & Steam
    * Steam will manage all updates and changes to the game
    * There is no PunkBuster; instead cheat protection is through VAC (Valve Anti Cheat)
    * There is no way to kick or ban troublesome players when playing in ranked matches
    * On the second day after release cheating is already very present
    * There are NO multiple accounts or profiles for use with others in your house that would like to play the game â€“ everything has to be played through a single Steam account
    * There is no access to the console limiting configuration changes severely
    * There is no built in support for SLI/Crossfire configurations
    * There is no possibility of future mod tools or modifications for the game at this point
    * There is no possibility of future custom maps at this point
    * Future DLC will most likely have to be paid for
    * Increased cost of the game at $60
    * The PC version is a direct console port. Period.
