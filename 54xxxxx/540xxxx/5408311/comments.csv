only if you have Windows Anytime Upgrade. The one who gets the code is the one who 

gives me a steam game first

It can be any LoL game what so ever. It must be a product key that works!

This is not a lie or fake!!!!!!!


SO LETÂ´S GO!!!


Send me a mail if you are interested. The mail is: tommynhl@hotmail.com


OBS! you can give me something else if you want but something I want shall it be!"

This is a ripped torrent, it's the 2010 February release from BIE from an unauthorized uploader(or so I'd assume).

I'd be careful and download the other torrent I linked above."
,LOTSAFINGAS,2010-05-14T14:06Z,"yo kazelement, i downloaded your windows 7 torrent and burned the iso with no problems. i even installed and patched it with the activator from Hazar. why does it use the internet connection on idol, i seem to be downloading nothing constantly, any ideas
"
,LOTSAFINGAS,2010-05-14T14:07Z,i think there could be a malware virus in the registry allowing whatever program it is to use the internet connection. even when not surfing?
