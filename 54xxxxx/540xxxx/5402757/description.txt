Trained since childhood to be a lethal killer, Raizo has since turned his back on the Ozunu clan that raised him and now seeks revenge for their heartless murders. Teaming up with Europol investigator Mika, Raizo steadily butchers his enemies while inching ever closer to the long-awaited bloody reunion with his former master.

When several people are killed in a peculiar manner, a Europol agent suspects that it could be the work of Ninja assassins. Her superiors warn her that she's entering dangerous territory. But she investigates nonetheless and it leads her to another dead agent who was also investigating the same thing. When she is marked for death, she is saved by another Ninja, whom she learns has gone renegade.

Cast: Sung Kang, Randall Duk Kim, Ben Miles, Rain
