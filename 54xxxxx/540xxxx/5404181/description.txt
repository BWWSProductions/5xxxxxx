Notes:

Congrats to SMOKEY for getting this one out some days ago.
However they again decided to exclude the subs present on the
DVD and tag it as DANISH. This release includes all the subs that
is on the DVD. Also decided to use a different resolution to get less
AR error.

For the nukers who thinks this is a dupe of the SMOKEY release, I
suggest that you read the TXD2K9 rules. They clearly state this:
A release containing English subtitles after a foreign-tagged release
is not considered a dupe, regardless of whether or not the foreign-tagged
release has English subs.

Some may think these releases are lame. But, tbh I don't give a damn.
Danish movies that have english subs included, deserves to be spread
to a wider audience. And I will keep doing this as long as other groups
won't include the subs eventhough they are on the DVD.

Thanks to the one who supplied the source.
You know who you are.
