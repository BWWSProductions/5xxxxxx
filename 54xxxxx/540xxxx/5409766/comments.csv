,lorikano,2010-03-04T22:35Z,"can somebody please confirm that this version works from beggining till the end without any problems ,(asking on behalf of AC2)"
,bomath,2010-03-04T23:09Z,"And what's even better: comes unpacked. Greater chance to have seeds, since people will keep the actual ISO image as long as they wanna keep the game.
The RARs get axed in the very second that one needs space on HDD..."
,Armix,2010-03-05T00:06Z,GIVE speed pliz!!!!
,syso01,2010-03-05T08:08Z,"I'm pretty sure that this release is NUKED.

You can only play first mission, free patrols and historical events. But you can't play campaign after first (intro) mission."
,NeoOhm,2010-03-05T14:16Z,"To get the game missons work:
Start game DIRECT from crack, not from shortcut.
Then use the DEFAULT name already typed by game

(i also skiped tutorial on my try, i had already done it and i started a new campaign. Dont know if u MUST do this)"
,JAC_69,2010-03-05T18:27Z,"This shit doesn't work!
It's not cracked properly!
I will wait for dopeman.
Stupid skidrow mother fuckers!"

,DragonF.C.Porto,2010-03-06T02:18Z,Thanks..SKIDROW
,Hamirez,2010-03-06T14:08Z,Thanks for the game but how do I unistall it?
,fufubar,2010-03-06T17:24Z,"Game doesn´t work for me neither. Before you start insulting me: I did not use a shortcut, I did not use the game luncher (even uninstalled it), I used the the default name (Oscar Entwickler). Result: When I play tutorial, I dont get the first mission; when I skip the tutorial I get he first mission but cant complete it.

I don´t know why it works for some, maybe they didn´t play past the first mission, or it is system related, I dont know... "
,lolwut11234,2010-03-07T01:24Z,"I have the same problem, Installed and patched correctly, started new game with default name, skipped tutorial. got the missions, chose the east coastal shipping one, sank tons of ships off the east coast but none would count towards the mission total. Ran out of ammo and went back to base, tried again with a new patrol, same thing happened. Is this a part of Ubi's DRM?     "
,NeoOhm,2010-03-07T10:44Z,"Complete ALL missions: Sink the tonnage, and then stay and cirkle around a bit at the mission waypoint.
Then send radioreport, and u will get a complete message.

Still, the mission will be playable again, till it EXPIRES. YOu also get new missions. But a complete mission is always active till it expires, in june or something, ingame time."
,NeoOhm,2010-03-07T10:45Z,"AND when u run out of ammo, DONT END MISSION, refit and go shoot some more torps."
,NeoOhm,2010-03-07T10:50Z,"Dont forget to send mission report and to stay atleast a few days close to mission waypoint. if u dont send radiomessage about tonnage sunk, how can they know u done and send message to you do u can return to port.

So, sink the tonnage, if u run out of ammo, go to a port and REFIT, dont end patrol. Then circla around the mission waypoint, mission complete. i mean, if they say sink ships THERE, dont go sink them somewhere else tehn.. its like painting the wrong house and complain that they dont think u done.. :)"
,BookieM,2010-03-07T13:28Z,"Guys what to do, when I receive radio contact and locate enemy ship on map, when I closing to the target red dot gone from map and around that point no ships even visual...what to do?"

,acemantron,2010-03-10T08:56Z,"I need a bit of help please.I see you guys are saying that in order to play the game i have to 
1)start game from crack
2)finish the tutorial with default name
3)start new campaign with default name
4)skip tutorial and select the new mission

Well i start the game from crack,i start a new campaing with the default name,i do all i have to do in mission ""Total Germany (1939)""  (i guess that's the tutorial),i complete all objectives and head for Kiel to report and i cant select new mission,so i just click on start new patrol with no mission selected and after that i exit the game.

So exit the game and start new campaign with default name,but i cannot skip the tutorial mission ""Total Germany"" ,the next mission is ""Happy Times"" but when i scroll the mouse over the mission it says ""You need to meet certain requirements to unlock this campaign"".

Am i missing something here? 

Thanks for any help :P"
,Noddy1992,2010-03-10T17:25Z,I don't know where to put the crack. I cannot find the gamefolder no matter what. All I can find is Ubisoft Game Launcher but nowhere to put the crack. Please help.
,bapcules,2010-03-11T18:58Z,"Yess, the Game works perfect, without this fuckin GameLauncher from Ubisoft :)
Big Thanks to all these Genius from skidrow.   (sorry 4 my english)"
,monteri,2010-03-12T01:10Z,"do we have more subs??
insted this boring 11 torpedo(default),
if positive,how  many more subs and torpedos capacity??
Thanks"
,DikkatDeliVar,2010-03-13T12:01Z,"The crack is not working properly even if you do not launch from launcher but the cracked .exe . You can get the 2nd mission if you run it, however when time comes for the operation waserubung (however it is spelled), no upgrades, no crew option, and save option disappears. So we will need to wait a bit more until they put a proper crack."
,thijssie93,2010-03-13T14:30Z,"cant get it to work

,TheBigHase,2010-03-15T10:48Z,"It's working fine now! And I'm glad that I got it from here if I was from Germany it could be a hard to get one by now lol ;-) Thx again u guys rule! Will u publish further patches to come!? Sure thang,huh!?"

,catamaranman,2010-04-07T02:17Z,"@BookieM- The contact you see first is simply a reported enemy position.  Go to the reported position and then proceed in the same direction that the enemy was reported to be travelling in.  
Also try:
1. Upgrade hydrophones
2. Move crew to battlestations to increase the range of the hydrophones.
3. Every few ""hours"" submerge and cut engines to better ""hear"" the target.  Also, if you still have the wimpy hydrophones that don't turn, you will need to submerge and turn the boat 360 degrees at dead slow speed since you wont be able to hear targets anywhere but in front of you.
4.Realize that you need to notice and get moving toward a reported contact AS SOON as it appears on your map.  The enemy wont stay in that position!  They will be long gone by the time you get there!  The best possible chance you have to intercept is if a radio reported contact appears very close to you and headed in your direction.  Try and choose the easiest report for you to intercept!

Hope this helps! :-D"
,catamaranman,2010-04-07T02:26Z,"BTW....although still very buggy even after the update, this game OWNS SH4!  Those that say ""just keep playing SH4!""  are pissed cause they cant get it to work....I loved this game so much that I bought  it!  Just seems like DRM  is still causing problems."

,Savestar,2011-02-22T15:02Z,"anyway .. cant start next mission after the first mission ..Im in the pen of Kiel .Talked to the officer .Did the ""What are my mission orders"" and then after listend to all the babbel I did the ""Lets start the new patrol"" .Then I get : ""Are you sure you want to start a new patrol without a mission order?"" YES or NO!  I have to talk to my second in command who is in the conning tower .I cant get there .. Now I read in UBISoft forums that its a bug intended for the pirated version of Silent Hill 5 ..... so ...  New crack needed I guess ..."
,Savestar,2011-02-23T03:25Z,sorry .. the important part I forgot .. NO IRONCROSS on the map when I did the talk .. No cross = No missions .. A bug made by UBI ...some say ... but its only a bug pirates suffer .. such as gents as us :)
,Savestar,2011-02-24T03:55Z,"Now .. the ONLY way to play this is to SKIP tutorial .. you take it, and you will NOT get the iron crosses on the map so you can continue campaign ...so if you want to play this game SKIP TUTORIAL! And even you can see the Iron Cross for the tutorial, and you still have time to do it, you wont be able to do it anyway - You can only start the campaign, by choosing one of the 2 other crosses ....
By the way THANKS FOR ALL THE INFO about how BUGGED this is ... (sarcasme applied) "

if you guys want less hassle while playing go download this:
