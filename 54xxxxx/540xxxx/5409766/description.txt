Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
Were a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We dont earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then dont hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.


twice the fun   / double the trouble


On with the game release information:

Silent Hunter 5 hails the return of the number one submarine
simulation. For the first time the player will be able to play
feel as U-boat captain leading his crew from a first person
view in a true dynamic campaign.

Operate against Allied shipping on a vast area all across the
Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea and participate in famous
encounters with strong enemy warships. Can you do better than
the best U-boat aces?

Silent Hunter 5 raises the levels of interactivity and
immersion inside the U-boat and outside

For the first time the player will walk through highly
detailed submarines in FPS view and be able to access every
inside  outside part of the U-boot

With the help of an advanced order system the player will
interact with the submarine crew, watch them doing their daily
jobs and experience the tension  fear inside the U-boot.

Player actions will impact the outcome of battles and the
scenario evolution in campaign. Depending on his approach the
player can open new locations with upgrade and resupply
possibilities, while the Allied response adjusts dynamically
