[V],.BONE.,2010-03-03T20:03Z,the 700mb 1 is more or less the same because its ripped from this file
,OCbeta,2010-03-04T14:34Z,"This is quite possibly the worst cam ever, it's not the quality,k its the fact the person recording didnt have the common sense to sit at the back of the theatre to get a fullscreen.

AND THE FACT THEY DIDNT DET THE CAM TO 60HZ.

n00b recorder. audio is about 2 seconds off at the start but 5 minutes in its ok.



--- to other pirates.

WAIT FOR PROPER rip, dont bother with this, it ruins the movie. 2/3 of the screen on each side cant b e seen.


Plus side, the audio is top quality for cam.

A: 9
V: 2"
