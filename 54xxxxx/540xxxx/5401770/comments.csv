[T],charlesdickens,2010-03-06T15:20Z,"you are Fake....

you say on tags fearFM ????

i can say fearFM is no longer exist.....it is dead
this top 40 is fake"
,-Memphiz,2010-03-06T18:38Z,"Fake, this isn't the real top 40.
For current the real ones check this site:
http://www.hardstyletop40.com/
It will continue where FearFM has ended."
,roedie,2010-03-06T21:08Z,"Who cares if it's real or not?
It just gives you an other perspective on the best hardstyle of this moment, most of the songs will probably be in the top 40 anyways...
But more importantly more hardstyle!!

So uploader: whatever your sources are, as long as they're good, actual songs, I don't care if it's from FearFM or not!"
,M41N41,2010-03-07T21:02Z,"I never said this was a fear.fm top 40. I know fear.fm is dead and I loved fear.fm, im not trying to replace them or anything. The only reason I've put fear.fm in the tags is because people who are looking for an old fear.fm top 40, also might like this new one.

And about hardstyletop40.com... No disrespect, I know it is made by the man who made the fear.fm top 40, but who decides that is the REAL top 40? I started uploading this top 40 after fear.fm died, hardstyletop40.com didnt even exist yet and I was just filling a gap. After all the positive reactions I received I decided to keep on going making these.

So, if I were you, I would download both my top 40, as the hardstyletop40.com top 40. That way you can be sure you keep up with all the new releases ;)"

,Pulle68,2010-03-10T19:20Z,Thanks!! Great work! I really hate that fear.fm stopped. I don't care if it's real or not. The songs are of good quality and the best alternative. Keep up the good work!
,M41N41,2010-03-26T14:50Z,"Since the hardstyle top 40 is back, I decided to quit composing these top 40's after this month. I would like to invite everyone to download the top 40 at www.hardstyletop40.com from now one. Thanks everyone who supported me the last few months :)"
