,redmetoc,2010-10-14T03:43Z,Is this a video along the lines of Morris' excellent book of the same title in uploaders comments?  I learned to tie my first flies using that book - highly recommended.  Looking forward to this vid.  Thanks.!
,redmetoc,2010-10-14T03:47Z,I understand now!  This is the AVI version of your previously posted VOB version  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5396396/Fly_Tying_Made_Clear_And_Simple   ?  A little more detail in uploader comments for the VOB version.
,redmetoc,2010-10-17T14:20Z,"BIG PROBLEM with this torrent!  

2 files included but only 1 is the fly tying video of interest!  

Download the ""1-DVD-Title0.avi"" file for the fly tying vid.  The other file is some William Holden / Ricky Schroeder movie I didn't bother watching after scanning the opening scenes to figure out what it was.  Just ""Skip"" or whatever your torrent client calls it to not download the useless ""DVD-Title0.avi"".  "

the fly tying vid works fine and is a much smaller version of the uploader's VOB version (the VOB version is a much faster dl with more seeders - I recommend dl'ing both to ensure getting a complete vid.  You can decide later which to keep.).  The last 10% of this torrent came in very slowly but eventually I did complete the dl .  I'll seed this torrent until at least a 1.0 ratio but most likely up to 2.0 so we can get more seeds out there.  I've ""skipped"" the WH movie (using the uTorrent client) so all you'll get from me is the fly tying vid."
