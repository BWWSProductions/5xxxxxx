,darknessv,2010-03-03T01:12Z,nice!
,69iner,2010-03-11T15:44Z,we need seeders! Im stuck at 99.9% for 2 days now!
,ChadVader,2010-03-14T17:59Z,Managed to pull the first %99.9 in about an hour... now I'm stuck?  Throw me a seed and I'll seed back!!!
,dragoness22,2010-03-15T19:12Z,stuck at 99.9% could anyone seed me that last 0.1?
,JocePT,2010-03-16T01:07Z,"Can someone please send me the last .1% its been while!
Thanks!"
,ChadVader,2010-03-16T03:27Z,So... I've uploaded 4x file size and still can't get last .o1%  is this a bum file?
,mook300,2010-03-16T13:29Z,stuck at 99.9 as well
,SkillZ112,2010-03-16T22:00Z,For those of you who are stuck at 99.9% uncheck the download of the calender for some reason it wont download once youve done this it should finish the download.
,JocePT,2010-03-16T23:38Z,How do I remove that. I use Miro and mostly use it for books on tape... not multi videos
,ChadVader,2010-03-17T00:52Z,skillz; I was about to call bogus on this torrent... how do I do that with bittorrent?
,JocePT,2010-03-17T01:12Z,And what are the padding files when you open up the files? Should they be there? or should I delete them to complete the file... Thanks for the help in advance! 
,ChadVader,2010-03-17T02:05Z,"Fuck this noise.  This is a shit torrent.  I dl'd 99.9 in less than an hour.  Spent the next 3days uploading 20GiB. and can't get the download of last 0.01;  dustin37398 is a bullshit punk, said he would dl for ""a pretty long time"", and couldn't last 2 weeks.  dustin37398 justifies the nasty rep p2p has in the popular conscience. "
,mook300,2010-03-17T14:27Z,"I use utorrent, was stuck at 99.9...
removed the torrent, re added it ...
removed the calender and ALL of the padding files and it finished.  You dont have to redownload the whole thing it will check the file once you re-add it and finish.....
Thanks skillz and dustin"
,Czar_Mohab,2010-03-17T18:47Z,"This is a great torrent! Still stuck at 99.9% but I think that with only 2 seeds (I've seen up to 7) and over 1500 leeches at any given time this will take some patience to d/l completely. Shouldn't go bashing someone who's most likely been seeding forever for not seeding when over 1500 people are trying to connect just to him and one other.

Eventually this will even out and there will be 100% for everyone, just be patient. I doubt that the volume of people was expected. Or just do like mook300 did and don't d/l the stuff that isn't d/l'ing."
,TopShoTTa7,2010-04-06T22:05Z,"this is awesome torrent took 24hours to download 99.9%, i use u torrent... what i did was looked at the tabs at the bottom, clicked on the ""files"" tab and i saw that 2 of the files had a red bar under the pieces column, so i right clicked the 2 files and clicked ""dont download"" and that solved the problem....
the 2 files were the calender and the first padding file..."
,TopShoTTa7,2010-04-06T22:09Z,"i'm assuming ""dustin37398"" used bitcomet to upload this torrent thus creating those padding files, they have nothing to do with the files desired and can be deleted...."
,TopShoTTa7,2010-04-06T22:20Z,"guys if u want to convert the mpeg-4 movie(mp4) files to avi, vob, mpg, wma or whatever u can just use this.... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5091144/Xilisoft_Video_Converter_Ultimate_v5.1.26.Build.0904.Multilingua"
,scjrpb,2010-04-13T10:02Z,Real deal. Downloaded pretty fast. Just remove all the padding files and the calender and you're good to go.

,jephunk,2010-04-30T23:50Z,"@Skillz, thanks for that tip... was stuck at 99%, unchecked the Calendar, and now it finished."
,eppa2277,2010-05-04T18:08Z,Is anyone else having problems with video 3 and 7?? I can't watch them
,m4e_81,2010-05-25T20:36Z,"Excellent Videos and Info, just remove the .xsl file from the list and you'll be able to complete download. The .xsl format is not need it.. You have everything, the .xsl is just an optional file. 

I'll be seeding today.. thank you for this!!"
,rocafella13,2010-06-10T06:35Z,BEAST! I used U-Torrent unchecked the padding files and the file with XLS extention DL'd in 3 hours. Umm how do I make DVD's out these files now? HOLLA

Using uTorrent, I unchecked (didn't download) all the padding files and the !Insanity Calendar.xls file as mentioned by m4e_81 and you will get everything you need.
