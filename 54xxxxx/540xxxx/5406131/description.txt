Working Beyond Time/Space in the Imaginal Realm

Excerpts from Living Your Vision - Vital Keys to Greater Happiness, Success and Joy, Los Angeles  Intensive, June, 1995

Time/space and the Imaginal Realm are vast topics, as are the Archetypes whose assistance we need to move into, experience and work with the Imaginal Realm. In this brief discussion, Lazaris talks 
about the torus through which we can pass to move beyond space/time and into the Imaginal Realm where imagination imagines itself and creativity creates itself. This is not a complete discussion but it is a fun and enlightening overview that brings with it the flavor of this vast realm of tremendous power.

April 10, 2008 Audio Only OnLine Blending: The beautiful Blending from the April OnLine Conference includes two (2) 33-Second Techniques. Many have asked for this kind of recording. Together we blend our desire, our imagination, and our expectation with Lazaris' desire for our happiness, Lazaris' imagination of our success, and Lazaris' expectation, not of us, but Lazaris' expectation for us. It's an amazing recording.

Valley of the Giants, A View of the Archetypes

click here to listen to a sound clip of this tape


Excerpts from Living Your Vision - Vital Keys to Greater Happiness, Success and Joy, Los Angeles  Intensive, June, 1995

The Valley of Giants from space/time -- a metaphor -- is a place far more real than anything in our illusion. There the Archetypes, those "formless forms," reside as grand receptors and vortices of energy that is coming into formation. To enter the realm of the Archetypes one must come as a spiritual adult and with Higher Self or Soul -- never entering alone, as we need our Higher Self or Soul to translate the truer meaning of what the Archetypes say and to grant their decision for any exchange of gifts. The magic and mystery of the Archetypes is intense, and the creations and manifestations we conjure with them can be immense.
