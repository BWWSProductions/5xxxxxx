,yoyoyoy,2010-03-03T17:33Z,try reading the nfo vagir
,vagir,2010-03-03T17:36Z,What is ppf ?? 
,yoyoyoy,2010-03-03T17:41Z,doesnt matter what ppf is - the instructions ar ein the info when you download it - open it in notepad and READ
,ShinoBoy,2010-03-03T17:52Z,"Here are the instructions from the nfo file (don't know why this was so hard to just copy/paste in the comments, yoyoyoy):

Instructions: Place both DVD images in a folder, copy over the contents of this release, click the .bat.

My comments: fixes the first 2 dvds, which were 'nuked'.  3rd disc should be fine"
,vagir,2010-03-03T17:57Z,"ou , sorry , my fault . didn't notised nfo file / thanks "
,5468741,2010-03-03T19:55Z,Will this fix still work if you only have disc 1? I followed the directions but the .bat keeps giving me errors. 
,TidusZ,2010-03-03T20:48Z,"Guys its important to keep the original file names.
If you renamed the ISO files it will not fix them.

This fix is for the first 2 DVD's, copy all the downloaded files from this archive to FF-13 download folder and run the bat file.
"
,ShinoBoy,2010-03-03T20:51Z,"@ 5468741, yes, you can get it to work for just the first disc by manually editting the .bat file.  Open it in Notepad and delete the following line: ApplyPPF3 a all-ff13-disc2.iso all-ff13-disc2-fix.ppf

Then when you run it, it won't try to apply the disc 2 fix to the non-existant disc 2 iso"
,brian0423,2010-03-03T22:14Z,i don't see what the hype is on final fantasy... i tried playing it...and you can't even fight in the game. you just choose how you fight and everything else is done for you.
,laranoye,2010-03-04T10:15Z,"Lawl at brian0423,
this is the classic final fanatsy battle which is by my preference the best ever going bak to final fantasy's pre XII and its pretty much the same as VII with all the benefits of VIII and X. if you dont like that kind of battle or this game why even commment or look at a final fanatsy torrent? do'h go play ure FPS's bye bye"
,john5246,2010-03-05T05:58Z,"Ok so this ""fix"" will allow me to continue from DISC 1 to DISC 2 correct????


I have ixtreme 1.6 and can't do wave 4 so it won't let me move on to the second disc."
,boystreet,2010-03-06T13:00Z,Does the patching process take long? Mine is 1 second. I doubt something's wrong?
,studomer,2010-03-06T18:48Z,"I'm a HUGE FF fan, but I'll try to spare some of you the dozens of hours of downloading this game. IT SUCKS beyond belief. It is as far removed from the FF series that it shouldnt even be called FF. Its not even an RPG fir christ sake: No towns to explore, no people to talk to, no side quests, no world map, no mysteries to solve, no limits breaks, no eidolon customization, and the battle strategy for about 70% of the game is ""smash A button"".

This is as lackluster as it gets. Dont get me wrong, the graphics are incredible... but you can't make a great game with ONLY good graphics. They literally must have employeed 100 artists and like 1 or 2 gameplay developers... I mean really, the game sucks that much. After about 40 hours I just gave up, I couldnt stand another second of that tedious piece of crap. I sadly say that I am no longer a FF fan."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-07T22:39Z,Man abgx360 fail becuase its not in the datatabase get. The game must be Verified first by abgx360. Just becuse the game is relased dont mean its in the abgx360 database. And it will still fail some because abgx360 dont support wave 6....
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-07T22:40Z,as soon as abgx360 Verified the game it will be fixed.
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-07T22:50Z,There for is very importen not to play the game before its in there (abgx360 database).
,studomer,2010-03-11T16:42Z,Check out a PROPER review of this game b4 your waste time to download: http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/03/final-fantasy-xiii-review/

,mesley,2010-03-13T10:25Z,"beat this game allstars rip with fix patch 54.4 kb
i played it on iextreme 1.6 with boot disc.
had to convert disc 2 and 3 to wave 3 cuz of the disc swap between discs doesnt let you save til after u insert the new dvd not allowing you to use a boot disc.  Now just waiting for it to verify so i can play it on my new box.  Love this game graphics and gameplay are unmatched by any other ff game.
Worth a purchase cuz this game has some replayablilty"

,sinshixxi,2010-03-14T09:03Z,"what if I clicked ""fix.bat"" twice (in an error obvisouly)? meaning that I patch again a patched file. Does it change anything?"
,mesley,2010-03-14T12:15Z,"its easy to patch, the patch is for disc one and two so make sure to have them both extracted before you run the .bat file
i assume that the new firmware will run it fine without any conversion or boot disc"
,mesley,2010-03-14T12:16Z,Yea my 3 dvds worked fine on verbatims
,egozi44,2010-03-14T17:53Z,"did someone here try to fix the game useing abgx360 after he use the allstars fix?

i want to know if its necessary to fix it to be  invisible from the xbox ""net""  so i not get ban

so there is anybody here that try to fix the game after he use the allstars fix and finish the game with all the 3 dvds working? or its make the other 2 dvds to stop workinG? : O"
,paulosergio96,2010-04-24T17:23Z,"When i try to use the bat file it says it doesn't recognize ApplyPPF3 as an internal or external command, operation program or batch file

Any ideas?"
,Maurus,2010-05-09T17:59Z,How do I apply the fix with mac os? It wont accept the .bat since the patch is made for windows users...
,andreyvul,2010-08-11T10:40Z,@Maurus: use Wine to run each command in the bat-file
,chippy92,2010-09-04T16:59Z,"ive succesfully burned the game but when i put it in my xbox it say's it's a dvd. does this have annything to do with updates on 360, if so please tel me how to ``downdate`` it =D
