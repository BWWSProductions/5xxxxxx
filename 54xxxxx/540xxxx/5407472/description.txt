The miraculous adventures of Jakub in his grandfather's garden.
It all begins after the libidinous Jakub is booted out of his home by his father after he is caught making love to another man's wife.
He is banished to his grandfather's garden and given explicit orders to sell it.
In the garden he finds Helena, a young girl dubbed the Virgin Miraculous in the title cards. Strange things happen in the garden, and some of them do indeed seem like miracles. Helena teaches Jakub to appreciate the delicate mysteries of life.
