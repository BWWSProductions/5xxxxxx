Two brothers and gamers for life choppin' it up about video games and gamer culture. A non-platform specific podcast, just pure gamer passion. Hosted by Kevin and Ryan Ballerstein.

  This week we finish up on Bioshock 2 discussion, later we dive into Silent Hill Shattered Memories, and Michael Pachter predictions.  Finally, Ryan details his Heavy Rain experience, and Kevin talks AIDS games.  Wave back everyone, it feels good to be a gamer!
