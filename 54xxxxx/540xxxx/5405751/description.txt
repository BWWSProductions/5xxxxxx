Beelzebul is a one man act. The guy plays all the instruments and records entirely by himself. In the vein of Windir, the forces of dark music run strong in this combination of Thrash Metal, Black Metal and Death Metal. Beelzebul claims that "although Satan is an influence it is not in the manner of the usual Black Metal imagery." Beelzebul's full catalog can be viewed via:
