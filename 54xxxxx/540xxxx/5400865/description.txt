Factual drama about how the glamour-studded career of
Britain's most famous footballer destroyed the life not only
of George Best himself, but also of the close-knit family that
he had left behind in Belfast. At the same time as high living
began to take its toll on George's own career, his previously
teetotal mother descended into alcoholism, with damaging
repercussions for the whole family.
