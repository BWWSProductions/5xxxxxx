,arakon74,2010-03-04T23:40Z,"It works for me on Win XP.

First, follow instalation instruction. If you do NOT have real time data provider you can't use regular shortcut from desktop. You have to start MetaStock using shortcut from start menu ""MetaStock Professional Offline Mode."" This way you can read all daily and intraday data from your disk.

Hope it helps."

System Requirements
Windows Vista 32-bit, XP 32 bit (Service Pack 1 or higher)

Probably doesn't work in 64 bit OS. 

I don't know about Win 7. Maybe in XP mode..."
,arakon74,2010-03-09T00:39Z,Ive found out. It will work on Windows 7 64-bit as a 32-bit application. No problem.

Thank you for your effort in bringing this software to us! "
,jpdl10,2010-09-20T23:45Z,"Hi pappu90, Could you kindly share your serial number? When I install, it asks for serial number, and input ""-"" does not work. Thanks in advance."

,waynev1964,2010-12-29T02:48Z,"Arakon74,

thanks for the download, xcuse the lack of knowledge could you help with the following?
the download was successful, use the Y328-M7UL-NCJNJ code to get past the install.
But now to extend the trial period requires serial number.

i have read all the comments but see no record of it. the 4 files that were downloaded
MS10 CustMenu,MS70CTB, plus Pro setup and MsWin don't seem to have it.

What am i overlooking.
thanks in advance."

,Big_Deal,2011-03-30T09:42Z,"Hey, thank you for this upload! 
Maybe you could help me with a problem. The program is asking for a DBC data manager. It can't start without it. 
Thanking you in anticipation!"
,santoshdts,2011-06-18T15:24Z,Used  key & installed trial but wat about Installation key where can i get that
,sicmare,2012-02-26T13:31Z,"guys, this is how you make it work ok. after you've installed and entered the serial number, copy MsWin.exe to program files/equis/metastock. if it asks if you want to overwrite file click yes. 

then launch metastock professional offline mode to use it. you can launch the normal one if you've got a real time data provider. i don't have one so i haven't tested it yet."
