Paul Merton in Europe 6of6 PDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Having travelled far afield to explore China and India, Paul Merton is ready to take things easy with a relaxing trip around Europe. "But things didn't turn out quite as expected," he says. Far from gorging on sumptuous food and wine, lying on ravishing beaches and enjoying breathtaking architecture, Paul will be exploring some of the lesser-known areas of the continent. "Prepare to see Europe like you've never seen it before," he promises.

Part6:
In the final episode, Paul travels to Spain, where he encounters a former monk who has spent the last half-century building a gigantic church  single-handedly. At a bullfight, he witness a spectacular display of acrobatics that leaves the animal in one piece. Elsewhere, Paul takes part in a gigantic human tower, learns about the legacy of the Civil War and tries his hand at flamenco.
