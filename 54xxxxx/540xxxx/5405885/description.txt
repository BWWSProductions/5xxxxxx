Product Description
DAVEY HAVOK/JADE PUGET: TWO BOYS IN LOVE WITH SYNTHESISERS & SOFTWARE
BLAQK AUDIO, the electronic side project of AFI's Davey Havok and Jade Puget, 
will finally see the light of day in the form of the debut album CexCells. 
Recorded by the band in between AFI's extensive touring for 
DECEMBERUNDERGROUD and mixed by Dave Bascombe 
(Depeche Mode, Tears for Fears, Placebo), CexCells expands upon 
and fully indulges the dark electronic textures and influences increasingly 
prevalent in AFI's recent work. The results range from evocation of prima 
era Depeche Mode and early Ministry ("Stiff Kittens," "Bitter for Sweet," 
"Where Would You Like Them Left?") to four on the floor club-friendly 
fare ("On a Friday," "Snuff on Digital") to vulnerable balladry ("Wake Up," "The Fear").

The common thread running through all of BLAQK AUDIO's material-Havok's
 signature dark vocal and lyrical stylings combined with Puget's epic, 
emotional arrangements -will be instantly identifiable to AFI fans, despite 
the synthetic washes, keyboard flourishes and electronic beats supplanting
 the traditional guitar /bass/drum AFI frame work.
