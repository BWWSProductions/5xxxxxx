,MiutheMoth,2010-03-20T01:21Z,"This torrent is soooo dead -.-. Could someone seed it, pretty please???  "
,MiutheMoth,2010-03-20T01:22Z,"I'd seed it like, forever, after that :D"
,MiutheMoth,2010-03-20T13:23Z,"I know I comment here a lot, sry for that, but I'd like to tell you, that when I started to download, I thought, maybe a seeder will show up sooner or later (hasn't happened yet :P) and I managed to download 98,7% without a seeder, so don't panic, it won't stuck on 45% or something, this torrent is almost OK. :) "
