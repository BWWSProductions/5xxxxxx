,LenaIsAPirate,2010-05-10T16:38Z,So... I've downloaded probably more a hundred torrents and none were like this... Can someone explain to me... do I have to unpack all of them? And then what?
,LenaIsAPirate,2010-05-10T16:48Z,Never mind! All you have to do is extract all of them at once in one folder and then unrar them with winrar and run the setup. Works perfectly. And it's safe. Thanks!
