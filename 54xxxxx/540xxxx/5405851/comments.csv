,andy72184,2010-03-03T23:13Z,Who needs subs?  If you can't understand english please fucking kill yourself.  More I believe in stupidity in the world I believe in population control.
,Dbeurl,2010-03-09T15:15Z,"I rather love the irony of an ignorant fucking moron waxing poetic about stupid people who don't understand English - in piss poor English.  As for the stupidity of the initial question, people who are hard of hearing or deaf tend to find subs particularly useful.  

Having lost most of the hearing in my right ear in an accident, I find it very difficult to understand what people are saying sometimes.  Thus either subs or headphones are often a necessity.  This says absolutely nothing my intellect.  

Your commentary, on the other hand, speaks volumes about your own there Andy."
,Dbeurl,2010-03-09T15:16Z,"BTW, Thanks for the upload..."
,sugared,2010-03-11T07:19Z,"Thanks for the upload and the subs. Subs are one of the best ways to learn another language. 

To andy72184: It's people like you who need to be stopped from breeding. 

Besides that, what right do you have to say that people with bad hearing can't watch TV?"
,HobbyBuggins,2010-03-16T22:55Z,"thx VTV for another perfect upload.

I've read some incredibly stupid comments at TPB, but this is the first one to which I haven't been able to resist the urge to respond.

Andy!  Young fellow, (I'm really hoping you are young) to suggest that anyone lacks intelligence or should die simply because the speak another language is the most moronic statement in the history of statements.  I can't even comprehend the level of ignorance it takes to conjure up a thought like that.  

That is all."
