,artistofwords,2011-02-12T20:04Z,"for everyone who's bitching about this being a bad movie, this isn't funny the way The Hangover is funny... It doesn't stoop down to cheap humor. If you like things like Fargo and Burn After Reading, you'll like this movie. DL it. "
,jemicarus,2011-04-12T08:10Z,"Excellent quality, small file size - a/v 10/10 - thanks!"

,The_BLaCK_ReDNeCK,2011-08-04T02:49Z,"Finished downloading in about 32 minutes. I'll come back later to give a little mini review on the movie...

Thanks to the FXG_team fer the upload! I appreciate it."
,amilcar503,2011-08-05T07:31Z,2.5 MB/s so less than 5 minute download GREAT and thanks....now if i only knew how to seed?
,The_BLaCK_ReDNeCK,2011-08-05T20:15Z,"Back. Here's my mini review:

Audio: 10
Video: 9
Excellent quality fer its size. No lagging or syncing problems--Fullscreen using VLC.

Movie: Not the best movie in the world, not the funniest, but it's good I think. Worth watching. Very innerestin stuff... Makes you think about all the other crazy stuff the gov does/did lmao. If yer into the paranormal (sorta) or yer just a weird person, check out this movie.

Thanks to the uploader again, and thanks to the seeders. Have a good one.

---------------------------------------------

@amilcar503: Depends. I'm not sure if this is true fer all clients, but I use Vuze (Azureus), and when I'm done downloading my torrent, it automatically seeds. I can choose to pause/cancel/resume seeding and downloading. You might want to check with yer bittorrent client's support (like a forum or some website it should have). Goodluck dude."
