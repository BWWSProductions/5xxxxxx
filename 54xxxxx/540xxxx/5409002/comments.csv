,pspaddict,2010-05-09T01:50Z,Fuck fake torrents and the people who upload them!
,Exile002,2010-05-16T17:30Z,This is indeed fake. Have a little patience and wait for May 25.
,VoKoCA,2010-06-03T23:07Z,"Why is this shit still here? I thought it was fake, so why keep it up?"
,sweetchilliphil,2010-06-04T19:46Z,"actually guys, the US and EUR version has been either leaked or released early... There are multiple confirmed working links on PSPISO.COM with people confirming it works on various firmwares including M33-6.

I think this is the leaked promo version. And I have heard a rumor that the promo version excludes multiplayer. But you might want to research that before jumping to conclusions (Yeah, looking at all you previous posters)...

Anyhow. This is legit. There are many other versions out there being downloaded and played. Don't miss out! I'm on the second level and this game is SUPERB! I don't know about this versions ""legit-ness"", but it was uploaded around the same time all the other ones were. So with that in view, I'd say this is SAFE.

Download it now and don't be disappointed! Props to the misunderstood (but he probably should have put more information regarding its legitness rather than just the working firmware, so it is partially his fault) uploader..."
