,benus,2010-03-22T01:52Z,"Hi SM. I am your secret fan, and have a big request. 
Since the LOTR started to appear on usenet and torrents could you be a decent lads and make a really great quality rip. By great quality I mean 1080p in 4.37 GB or in 8 GB. 
This particular release is all about quality since these all parts are not even extended cuts. I am positive your fans would really appreciate it. 
You are the only guys who can do this up to really high standard. 

Thanks for all the hard work. Stay cool and remember FullHd is a proper direction, when size kept under 4.37GB. 
It'll quadruple the results of your work."
