,rebelcasper27,2010-03-02T21:08Z,Having a problem extracting files about 80% through. WinRar tells me it is the wrong password and stops the operation...bad rar or something?
,rebelcasper27,2010-03-02T22:08Z,r63 is the bad rar file...any way to get around it? WinRar won't be let me do anything with after that...
,fishfan77,2010-03-02T22:10Z,"I, too am getting a bad rar file. This stinks started the download last night and basically been a waste of time. Aren't these tested before they are posted to see if they at least extract???
"
,rebelcasper27,2010-03-02T22:26Z,r48 and r63 are telling me bad encryption or wrong password. I'm going to attempt to download these 2 rars again and see if that works.
,brian0423,2010-03-03T00:50Z,whats the passward?
,daperdon,2010-03-03T00:56Z,m
,daperdon,2010-03-03T01:15Z,cap the X SOS
,daperdon,2010-03-03T01:16Z,www. .com normal
,daperdon,2010-03-03T01:17Z,nothing wr with any rars 
,brian0423,2010-03-03T01:22Z,thank you..
,Resse815,2010-03-03T05:51Z,"The password for anyone that couldnt figure out the semi-retarded post up above me is ""X360SOS"" just add the www and the .com to that. Doing that will fix any issues with your extraction."
,VistaVick,2010-03-03T06:47Z,"If you are banned from xbox live you may not be able to play the game at all. I dont even have an ethernet cord in my xbox and when you try to launch the game it says it requires an update to play....I guess the update must be on the disc, but when it tries to patch it gives a dirty disc error....I have no problem with any other discs and the game shows up pretty fast on the dashboard, you just cant play it.

Any idea if this is related to the iso copy, or not being able to connect to xbox live?

If anyone is able to update the game, if they can share whatever it puts in the proper directory and share it, it would be most appreciated. "
,VistaVick,2010-03-03T06:48Z,Its also wave 4 if anyone is interested.
,beer122586,2010-03-03T06:54Z,Vista Vick. Try letting the system install the update without the hard drive attached. 
,VistaVick,2010-03-03T07:00Z,"ah thanks, you can run the game at least without updating, of course not with a hard drive, for now"
,MeatCleaverXXX,2010-03-03T17:36Z,"I too had troubles extracting until I used the password Reese815 suggested. Works like a charm!!!! I had no updates to download just burn and play!!! Also, it has Avatar awards!!!"
,fishfan77,2010-03-04T02:47Z,"Does not work. After finally getting the darn thing to extract, i burned the .dvd file (not the .iso) and put it in the xbox. BAM! It said PLAY DVD... I knew right away it was a coaster. I even tried the active.iso file. No luck. not to mention i caught a REAL nasty virus. The file scanned clean, but when i extracted it i got a real fucker of a virus. I have Avast! Malwarebytes and Super Anti Virus running and still got it.  "
,VistaVick,2010-03-04T04:51Z,"what firmware do you have, as I said its wave 4

you may try patching it to a lower wave if you are already banned from live

am I the only one who it keeps asking to an update before playing?"
,Resse815,2010-03-04T04:55Z,"Fishfan - you're an idiot and a liar. It says ""Play DVD"" because its a wave 4 game. Like most games released in the past 5 months. You need to either flash the newest firmware or just make a wave 4 playable disk which you put in before the game. The game works just fine and has no virus attached to the RAR. 

VistaVick - I'm playing it just fine on a banned 360. I havent even been flashed to update so thats odd. Did you run the game through ABGX360 before you burned it? If not that will fix your issue. (Hopefully)

This is probably the best MLB game in years. I love the new career mode."
,bizzyjae2003,2010-03-04T06:06Z,i keep putting the 2 passwords and i keep getting r63 wrong password can someone help plz
,daperdon,2010-03-04T19:06Z,to bizzy look at my prv mess
,fishfan77,2010-03-05T04:03Z,"Reese- FUCK YOU and your mother for having you. You dont know the first thing about me you little Troll. Turn off your mothers computer and go get some sun. I did get a virus and if you read what I wrote, the RAR scanned cleaned but when i extracted it. Perhaps i will send it to you so you can have the fun i did removing it.  Or maybe i will just politley suggest that you cram it up your cornhole like you do with everything else you get your hands on
"
,Resse815,2010-03-05T06:36Z,"HAHA, did baby get his feelings hurt! 

Simple, if you cannot figure out how to burn and play Xbox games. Don?t do it, you obviously have no idea how to run ABGX and patch the game. That is a given considering you don?t even know what a wave 4 version is. Instead you come here troll and tell people not to download because it?s a virus. Yet there are multiple people here that are having no issue what so ever. If you would stop visiting queer porn sites you might not get anal trojan?s. KKTHXBYE"
,BigDet,2010-03-05T14:52Z,can someone seed this
,dalbonit,2010-03-05T17:03Z,"I downloaded and extracted to winrar but here is the problem: The password worked fine and got all the files extracted, but no .ISO or .dvd files; I got the following files: 
Folder name = $$ystemUpdate with some files inside the folder example: FFFE07...
Folder name = AUDIO_TS
Folder name = VIDEO_TS with the following files inside the folder: VIDEO_TS BUP       VIDEO_TS.IFO       VTS_01_0.BUP     VTS_01_0.IFO     VTS_01_1.VOB
