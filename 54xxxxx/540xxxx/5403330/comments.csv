,Scraps2point0,2010-04-04T17:14Z,Thanks! I need these. Can someone please seed?
,newmouse,2010-04-11T07:15Z,"Thanks itzdarc.
But I've been trying to copy my Bioshock 2 Saves from Windows XP  to my new install of Windows 7.
And the Game won't recognize that they are there.
I've tried editing the Saves file names &
lots of tricks & it just won't list them in game.
The only reason I can think of right now is that the Win XP saves are with DX9 settings while the
Win 7 is DX10. @@@"

But from the link provided by newmouse, it looks like we would need your Games for Windows Live profile as well. If you created an offline profile, it shouldn't reveal any privacy-rleated stuff I guess, so it would be great if you could upload these files.

Thanks again."
