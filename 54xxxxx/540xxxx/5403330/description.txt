These are my game save files from Bioshock 2.  I figured someone out 

there maybe lost their game saves and may not want to start from 

scratch.  I save pretty frequently -- not all the saves will fit in the 

directory.  I typically save immediately before a larger battle or event 

and immediately after.


I played the game through on Medium difficulty.  I rescued all the 

little sisters, and forgave the NCPs (with the exception of the big guy 

-- the third one, as his sane self had requested to be 'set free from 

this mindless nature').


Basically, just throw these guys in your Bioshock 2/SaveGames folder 

which should be located in your My Documents folder.  I believe 30 is 

the limit the game allows, so choose the ones you use wisely!  I 

typically got to 10 saves and then archived the saves from that 

directory so that I could have more.  :)
