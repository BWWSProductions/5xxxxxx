The Legion of Super-Heroes reaches out for help against a powerful foe they can't beat alone. From the moment Superman landed on Earth until the end of time, the Time Trapper has sought to erase Superman's impact on the universe. But the Legion of Super-Heroes have always been there to stop the relentless villain. Now, one Legion isn't enough as the Time Trapper taps a twisted mirror image of The Boy of Steel from a parallel Earth long dead: Superboy-Prime! 

The story features Superman and the post-Infinite Crisis version of the Legion of Super-Heroes teaming up with their post-Zero Hour and "Threeboot" counterparts to battle the Time Trapper and a new incarnation of the Legion of Super-Villains led by Superboy-Prime.

This story arc is the finale of DC's three year reinvention of the Legion, coming after the JLA/JSA "Lightning Saga" and the Action Comics story "Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes."
