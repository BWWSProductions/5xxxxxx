The Playn Jayn were a raucous and rebellious psychedelic band from London in the 80's. They were a fantastic live band that had a great following. They played very often at the Marquee Club and released a Live album recorded there - Friday The 13th.

This is their only studio album - an unrecognised gem - far ahead of it's time.
