[V],globeplus,2010-03-06T12:07Z,"Please users of this file READ THE DESCRIPTION and the multiplayer not available is a kind of normal for torrents stuff , that means only with a few exceptions and with extra support programs for multiplayers you can use , beside that what you can expect from a file in the torrents is the SINGLE PLAYER . Thank you for understanding and please enjoy your game !!!"

,zahavpz,2010-05-04T23:04Z,Hey Globe@ please Reupload the music files
,zahavpz,2010-05-04T23:22Z,"Hey All Please Seed
im stuck on downloading for like weeks
i always download globe's torrents but none seed this 1.
btw anyone that has the game loading realy slow and has to wait on start then go to configures and lower the refreshment rate like to 60hz+/-.
this problem causes when your graphic card is too weak to handle the current setting.
also the solution for freezing,black spots,when you use nuke your pc crash,videos and/or cutscenes auto skipped after a freeze.
hope i helped and realy reupload the music files i just get like crazy when i play in silence"
,zahavpz,2010-05-05T02:06Z,"thnx for anyone that seeded that night, a 5 weeks download was downloaded over 1 night unfortenatly it was too fast for internet current speed so i got a crash but i fixed that thnx everyone"
