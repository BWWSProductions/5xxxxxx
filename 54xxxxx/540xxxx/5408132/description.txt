* STORY : *

* The story starts with the newly-elected president's assassination. A trailer for the game released at the Entertainment Software Association's 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo indicates that the story takes place twenty-five years after the conclusion of Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, and centers on the breakdown of peaceful relations between the United Earth Federation, the Aeon Illuminate, and the Cybran Nation, implying that war has been instigated through a single bullet. Supreme commander 2 is more focused on conflicting characters rather than ideologies.
