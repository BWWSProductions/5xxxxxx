THE ALEX JONES SHOW 
2010.03.01 Monday

Singer-songwriter Shooter Jennings, the son of country music outlaws Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter, talks with Alex about his latest project with novelist Stephen King. Jennings and King teamed up to produce a concept album entitled Black Ribbons, an indictment against government censorship and the New World Order. Alex also talks with Pastor Clenard Howard Childress, Jr. of Montclair, New Jersey, who uses his â€œThe Urban Prophetâ€ radio show to deliver a pro-life and pro-family message to urban America. Childress is the founder of the pro-life Blackgenocide.org, a website designed to reach the Afro-American community with the truth about abortion.
