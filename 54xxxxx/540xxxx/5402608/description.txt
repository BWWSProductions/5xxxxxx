Paul Merton in Europe 3of6 PDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Having travelled far afield to explore China and India, Paul Merton is ready to take things easy with a relaxing trip around Europe. "But things didn't turn out quite as expected," he says. Far from gorging on sumptuous food and wine, lying on ravishing beaches and enjoying breathtaking architecture, Paul will be exploring some of the lesser-known areas of the continent. "Prepare to see Europe like you've never seen it before," he promises.

Part3:
Paul resumes his travels in Ireland with a stop to witness the unusual sport of road bowling. Near the lunar landscape of the Burren, he drops in on Father Ted's house, before visiting a remarkable Brazilian enclave. In Dublin, Paul meets an enterprising pair who are selling Irish dirt to America,  and an artist who lives in a 1930s house.
