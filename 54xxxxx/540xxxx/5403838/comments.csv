,JoinX,2010-03-07T11:50Z,"Sweet, it works!

It's a simple text file with instructions on how to modify a registry key, making the Kaspersky Servers believe you're on a new computer, and thus allowing you to receive a new Trail key every time you edit the registry key!"
,cryfxx,2010-03-08T08:37Z,"yes, this is only a few kb text file(it is 100% safe!).. it details us on how we can regedit and always get a NEW 30 days trial... according to the info.. it hardly takes 2 mins to do this!.. i say this is the best thing ever... than all the halabula u have searching & downloading all those keys.. na'''' this seems to be the best bet!..
