From Wiki:


Tears for Fears are an English pop rock duo formed in the early 1980s by Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith.

Founded after the dissolution of their first band, the mod-influenced Graduate, they were initially associated with the New Wave synthesizer bands of the early 1980s but later branched out into mainstream rock and pop, which led to international chart success.

The band has sold more than 22 million albums worldwide (including over 8 million in the United States alone).
