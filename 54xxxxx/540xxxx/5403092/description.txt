What's New?
--> Removed the Customize Toolbar menu under the View in the main menu, since we don't currently allow toolbar customization. Should we need to, it will be added back in the future. (Daniel Jalkut)
--> Removed the Visualization of Reports menu since users have no real need for it at this time.
--> Edited the wording of the preference utility that lets users turn on all alerts. (Daniel Jalkut)
--> Fixed the selection after delete behavior for most tables in the system to be more consistent(ie: it will attempt to select the object above the one being deleted). Delete behavior of an object in a source list (ala clients or expense categories) will be fixed in 2.1. (Daniel Jalkut)
--> Multiple business support; toggle the active business from the toolbar!
--> Better syncing with Address Book.
