Benefits of the Isolated Sandbox

    * Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially. 

    * Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows. 

    * Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system. 

    * Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox.
