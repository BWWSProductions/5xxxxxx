,daba_1,2010-03-03T16:59Z,"Don't be deterred by the rather misleading title. Not a rock opera in the sense of Tommy or Jesus Christ Superstar, this 

sprawling double disc is more akin to a song cycle about Southern rock, in particular Lynyrd Skynyrd. Almost six years in the 

making, the Drive-By Truckers have created a startlingly intelligent work that proudly stands with the best music of their 

obvious inspiration. Largely written and conceived by lead trucker Patterson Hood (son of famed Muscle Shoals bassist David 

Hood), who sings the majority of the songs in a torn, ragged, but emotionally charged twangy voice somewhere between Tom 

Petty and Rod Stewart, these 20 literate tracks encapsulate a remarkably objective look at what Hood calls ""the duality of 

the South."" Rocking with a lean hardness, the story unfolds over 90 minutes, but the savvy lyrical observations never 

overburden the songs' clenched grip. While bands like the similarly styled Bottle Rockets have worked this territory before, 

never has a group created an opus that's thematically tied to this genre while objectively exploring its conceptual 

limitations. The two discs are divided into Acts I and II; the first sets the stage by exploring aspects of an unnamed 

Southern teen's background growing up as a music fan in an environment where sports stars, not rock stars, were idolized. The 

second follows him as he joins his Skynyrd-styled dream band, tours the world, and eventually crashes to his death in the 

same sort of airplane accident that claimed his heroes. The Drive-By Truckers proudly charge through these songs with their 

three guitars, grinding and soloing with a swampy intensity recalling a grittier, less commercially viable early version of 

Skynyrd. A potentially dodgy concept that's redeemed by magnificent songwriting, passionate singing, and ruggedly confident 

but far from over-the-top playing, Southern Rock Opera should be required listening not only for fans of the genre, but 

anyone interested in the history of '70s rock, or even the history of the South in that decade. More the story of Hood than 

Skynyrd, this is thought-provoking music that also slashes, burns, and kicks out the jams. Its narrative comes to life 

through these songs of alienation, excess, and, ultimately, salvation, as seen through the eyes of someone who lived and 

understands it better than most."
