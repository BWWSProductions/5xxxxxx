,khaled777,2010-03-02T12:30Z,"hi masuid

i have aloso sygic on my n95black and its works greate."
,masiud,2010-03-02T12:47Z,"thanks again Khaled is work greate  :-). 
do u know tomtom for nokia n97 ,where i can find ?"
,T-1OOO,2010-03-03T12:44Z,"I have Sygic installed on my Sony Ericsson Satio and it works perfect! Sygic still have alot to improve though. I was a long time TomTom user and I have tried Garmin Mobile XT aswell.. TomTom was the best but they don't develop it for symbian anymore. Garmin have always been crap according to me. It's so much details and if you are lost on the road you will be lost in Garmin also. The graphics in Sygic are well done and everything is looking ok, but there's some features that isn't working at all, like automatic night/day skin. I have to change it manually. and to configure the internal GPS is also very buggy at the moment. Another thing with sygic is that if you chose another road instead of the one sygic is giving you it kind of ""jumps"" for a while and before you even know you have already passed three crossroads.. Tomtom was better to deal with that.. I hope Sygic will be there soon too!
Thanks for the upload khaled777! much appreciated!!!"
,khaled777,2010-03-03T13:42Z,"hi T-1OOO
automatic night/day skin works without any broplem in the nokia n95 black and also once you configure the internal GPS it wel not ask again for connfiguration.what."

The automatic skin switch between light and dark will only work if you have  a light sensor.  The Sony Ericsson X1i for example has one for automatic screen backlight brightness and keyboard backlight"
