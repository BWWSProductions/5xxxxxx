Here it is...Only for the Nexus 2....the NXP format Guitar Expansion.


If you have problems loading it, leave comments below and I'll do my best to help you guys....I know the Nexus can be a bitch- but trust me...this thing is worth it.




YOU MUST HAVE A WORKING VERSION OF NEXUS 2 for this Expansion to work.


Since I'm more into the music promotion than software, I've also included a couple choice Mp3 cuts from one of my favorite unsigned bands in the Rar file.

Enjoy...
