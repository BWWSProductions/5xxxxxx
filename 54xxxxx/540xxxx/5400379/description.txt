Moraff's Maximum Mahjongg is a collection of four titles that began as
Internet freeware games called MoraffWare. 2D Net Editions of each game
were released on the Moraff Games website (www.moraff.com), but without
the many extras included in this Global Star Software published package.
The four packaged games are variations on the Mahjongg theme and include
Moraff's 3D-Jongg, Moraff's MoreJongg, Moraff's SphereJongg and Moraff's
RingJongg. The CD published version has many extras (additional classical
musical, tilesets and so forth) not found on the original freeware
versions at the Moraff Games website.
