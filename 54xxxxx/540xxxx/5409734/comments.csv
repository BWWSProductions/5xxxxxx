You don't see a rating this high
very often.I'll be back."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-04T17:28Z,"Yeah, it's always like that when number of votes is really small. "
,hkoraddi,2010-03-04T18:44Z,thanks heard the movie is good
,hkoraddi,2010-03-04T20:13Z,initial seeding has taken too long itso still waiting
,lilars26,2010-03-04T20:23Z,"I came back too soon.Please turn up 
your upload speeds so the dingoes don't
get this."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-04T20:42Z,"Number of Hit&Runs is high (nothing new). Out of 28 who have finished first, 15 stayed as seeders. That's the problem, aside the one lilars has mentioned - low exchange, during the download.

Initial swarm had decent transparency (bytes received > bytes given to fellow peers) but torrent can be killed easily with so incredibly high H&Run percentage. Well, it's not up to me, anymore."
,lilars26,2010-03-04T22:12Z,"It's up to us now.

Thank you 20/40."

double pay.Susan Sarandon still
looks wonderful.I wouldn't kick her out of
my bed.I`ll give it a nine."
