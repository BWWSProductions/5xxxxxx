[T],Dodecahedron9,2010-03-09T04:15Z,I would be grateful if you guys could give me a hand seeding this torrent. It took me a while to put this together and I'd hate to see it gone. Any speed is appreciated. Thanks in advance.
,l2yuuk,2010-04-24T23:11Z,"Thanx a lot for uploading this series.
I will be seeding it after i complete downloading this anime.
I hope u would upload more anime like this one."
,Cinj,2010-06-30T09:20Z,"Now this is what I like to see in a torrent: A very detailed description of exactly what it is you're downloading.

I can't comment on the actual content itself because I'm actually looking for an English dub, so I have no use for this torrent, personally. But if as much care was put into the ripping/encoding as the description, I'm sure it's excellent.

Now if this torrent came in dual audio, it would be perfect. (Hint, hint)"
,honnou,2010-08-06T19:36Z,this sounds like one helleva torrent dude. am downloading this at the moment and everything looks good. Great series and great upload. hope to see more stuff from you man.
,FfanaticR,2010-12-07T02:16Z,"I read the first couple volumes before One Manga took it down... wicked series, I'll be sure to seed."
,magnus_bane,2010-12-08T09:41Z,"cant wait to get it, downloading now but can more people seed?"
,Lomedin,2010-12-24T21:38Z,"Cinj, there's no such thing as a perfect anime dubbed in english. Therefore, this is perfect the way it is. Japanese with english subs is what the vast majority of people are looking for (wink, wink)... o.O"
,Editional,2011-01-25T22:05Z,"Great Job yo!
@Lomedin  Full Metal Alchemist is without a doubt the finest english dub ever created. I should know, I was an original member of the CFO in 1986. We brought anime to this country. Other than that I agree completely."
,nikotiini3,2011-02-17T12:12Z,"200kt/s :) Not the maximum speed, but good enough. I'll seed, but it sends it at only 0,5-2kt/s even though I have not put any upload limits :/"
,TRIrarrazabal,2011-04-19T00:10Z,"hey guys i need some seedes plzplzlpz, love this kind of format, thanks a lot Dode!"
,medikonroids,2011-06-29T06:01Z,"Hows the quality?
For 26 episodes i think 1gb might be low"
,medikonroids,2011-06-29T06:29Z,"Ok, downloaded this in about 1-2 hours with all 26 episodes and its pretty decent quality...
As said above its Japanese with eng subtitles
A: 9
V: 8
Subtitles: 8"
