,drcat125,2010-03-03T10:41Z,"It is watchable if you can take the flashing all through the movie. If not then pass on this one 

a 6 v 5 (flashing big time ) seizure alert "
,snai|,2010-03-03T22:43Z,"ok , lets be fair, this was shot from the first row, the framing was tightened to fill more screen but we lost about 35-40% or the actual movie. 
v5/10  a6/10
this is barely watchable, and hard to follow because of the low quality, i would wait for a better copy"
,snai|,2010-03-03T22:46Z,"because it's shot from the first row, when they do a closeup of bruce willis he looks like jabba the hut lol. i noticed this at about the 10min mark"
,m00nman,2010-03-04T12:32Z,"V3 /A5
It even says in the description that this is crap and not watchable. Not worth it. 
Not to be rude... thanks for sharing."

Remember ... never click links unless they are from the uploader or someone with the skull and bones beside there name."
,belgie,2010-03-06T19:21Z,"It's not a new AVI file.
There IS cropping.
What's the point in having a ""Description"" text, if you're not accurate with it?

The screen is maybe 25-40% of the actual screen. The cam is focused on the lower right-hand portion of the screen, so you're seeing about a quarter of the picture.

Plus, it's skewed at an angle.

The sound is pretty bad, but much better than the picture."
,benjgan,2010-03-07T16:08Z,"VERY BAD QUALITY, A-5 V-2, THANKS ANYWAY."
,concord24,2010-03-08T20:46Z,"this is realy bad
