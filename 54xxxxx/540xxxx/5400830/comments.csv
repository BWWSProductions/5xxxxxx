,maxigawa,2010-03-01T20:49Z,can you set your upload speed to unlimited please i think you may have capped it?
,darrencaf,2010-03-02T17:52Z,"maxigawa - I'm not capping any of my torrents, it's just I've only got a max upload speed of 48 Kb/s and I'm seeding other stuff at the mo and for some reason it's only going out at 1 kb/s.  I'll try and speed it up for you, but don't worry these torrents will be here until there are at least 10 seeders for each..."
