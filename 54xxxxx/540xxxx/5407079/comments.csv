,cbns007,2010-03-03T20:46Z,"um.
A lot of 720p rips are like that."
,nbm710,2010-05-02T13:53Z,"I have a question to TvTeam, I got this file and also your Anchorman Unrated. The playback is like stuttery or choppy or something, any ideas? Other files of this size play fine for me, just these ones with the ""Mack"" tag seem to have problems. Anyone else getting this problem?"
,DjMighty,2010-05-03T18:46Z,Yes indeed a lot of them are ripped in this resolution :)
,akaleeroy,2010-05-07T19:05Z,"People. About the 1280 x 544 and not 720p resolution: 720p is the commercial designation for things like high definition TV broadcasting and television sets and the like... which is standardised to the 16:9 aspect ratio. It's a convention to say 720p for the 1280 pixel width, 720 pixel height, 16:9, progressive scan image.

Cinema works with wider aspect ratios than 16:9. Like 1.85:1, 2.35:1 (also known as Cinemascope), 2.4:1, even 2.5:1. The Game was shot in 2.35:1, as you will discover by dividing 1280 by 544.

The real indicator of the types of HD images should have been the width - 1920 for Full HD, 1280 for the other one. But they chose to say 1080p and 720p because there's this thing about resolution being expressed in horizontal TV lines..."
