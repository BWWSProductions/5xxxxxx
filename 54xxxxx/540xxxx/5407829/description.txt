[hour 2] Alex welcomes to the show film director, producer and screenwriter AndrÃ© van Heerden. He is the writer and director of Shadow Government, a film that provides an up-to-the minute analysis of the ever changing technological landscape and offers new evidence that an ultra-secret global elite controls technology, finance, international law, world trade, political power and vast military capabilities. The DVD is available at the Infowars Store.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume support or endorsement on my
 part of all contents. 

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
