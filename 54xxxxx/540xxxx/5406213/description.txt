Summary

Since its discovery in 1930, Pluto has held a warm
place in the public imagination. So, when the American
Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium stopped
calling Pluto a planet, director Neil deGrasse Tyson found
himself at the center of a firestorm--a firestorm led by
angry, Pluto-loving elementary school students. But what
is it about this cold, distant rock that captures so
many hearts? NOVA joins Tyson as he follows the story
of its discovery and the science that surrounds this
former planet, including the possibility of finding more
Pluto-like planets in the mysterious Kuiper belt -- an
area of icy rocks at the edge of the solar system.
