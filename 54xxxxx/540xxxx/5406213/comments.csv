,GiantCock,2010-10-31T07:31Z,"@MrHamster - What the hell are you talking about? 550MB for an hour long video... that's gonna be pretty good quality. Typically, I see hour long episodes of shows around 350MB. What do you want? A 1 GB file?

Thanks to the uploader. Perfect quality. Great episode. NOVA is probably the best show on TV right now.

a/v - 10/10"
