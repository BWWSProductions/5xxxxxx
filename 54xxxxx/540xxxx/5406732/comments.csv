[V],twentyforty,2010-03-03T15:17Z,"READ THE SCHEDULE - it's posted as header of all regular shows.

>...""Wednesday: NCIS, NCIS LA, Lost, White Collar, The Good Wife (maybe next day) as MP4 H264; ~3.48 MB/minute""

Lost have been encoded as 360p ONLY last two weeks due to diluted schedule 'cause of Winter Olympics.

Thanks people. Slow day today, and I have encoded Lost as 360p. It was exception, right? And I guess nobody objects to that.

2040 - like your .mp4 posts (for PSP)!!... Also, how come LOST resolution settings different from other shows? No complaints just noticed.

@mona: 'cause somebody asked nicely to encode Lost as 360p.
I've promised nothing, but said that I do it whenever I can. In past two weeks it happened twice. What else? I am great Lost fan, I guess.

However, 360p is nothing unusual, for instance today three shows have been encoded as 360p, three as 480x272. Mainly, it's size issue (LOL), most of my ""regulars"" expect and prefer shows under 145MB and movies under 350.""

Last comment was - yesterday. Must I explain every decision? Nope. But I did."
