Killer Instinct takes place in a future where corporations have taken over the governments, including the very corrupt Ultratech.  Ultratech entertains the people with its bloodsport tournament known as Killer Instinct.  Most of these competitors are part of the tournament due to Ultratechâ€™s crooked ways. Some fighters are their own creations, while some fight in return for answers to their own dilemmas.
