[V],twentyforty,2010-03-02T14:04Z,"@stev. Chuck is ready from the dawn. It goes up at 16.00 CET. Married.Single.Other after the Chuck. Jurassic One HDTV goes as the last one today.

I try to avoid a black-hole from 13.00 - 16.00 CET."

,mona666,2010-03-02T15:11Z,"2040 - like your .mp4 posts (for PSP)!! Thanks!!!
in past, have noticed that even if upload speed is set at unlimited on user (seeders) end: 
ex: DL-20kb; UL-5kb
(1)  The IP provider is stopping or limiting seeding, i.e. remote sites. (2) if allowed to upload (seed) at non-remotes (years ago), it may take hours. (3) on remotes/non-remotes, seeding may stop on its own.

Also, how come LOST resolution settings different from other shows? No complaints just noticed."
[V],pluto999,2010-03-02T15:31Z,"could you please upload ""Sorority Row """
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-02T15:35Z,"@mona: 'cause somebody asked nicely to encode Lost as 360p.
I've promised nothing, but said that I do it whenever I can. In past two weeks it happened twice. What else? I am great Lost fan, I guess.

However, 360p is nothing unusual, for instance today three shows have been encoded as 360p, three as 480x272. Mainly, it's size issue (LOL), most of my ""regulars"" expect and prefer shows under 145MB and movies under 350."
,mona666,2010-03-02T17:12Z,"well, FYI (if you're not aware), the 480x272 H264 coding work is acceptable for PSP 3001.
I have to recode 640x360 H264 for PSP @368x208 (experimented) resulting in higher MB (still learning) than your work.

Wish I had known how to rip before I pawned my DVDs in 2008(LOL)."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-02T18:05Z,"@mona: Well, after the frozen Olympic weeks, full season starts from today. Luckily for PSP owners, I doubt that I can find bandwidth and resources for 360p encodings as in past two weeks, except the ones proved ugly (mostly 720p of 20min. comedy shows).
But... you should re-encode 720p or at least XviD (even if I consider XviD to low in quality for my usual work). Re-encoding re-encoded files is like making a paint of Mona Lisa by framing the photography or making audio CD from mp3. It defies logic, a copy from copy is like xeroxing already xeroxed thing, you would always have worse looking copy, always."
