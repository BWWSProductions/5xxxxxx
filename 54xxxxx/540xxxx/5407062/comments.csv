,Pananakot,2010-03-03T16:50Z,Is this release any different than the one already seeding at a decent rate? 
[T],thenoobish,2010-03-03T16:53Z,"this is the same release just that this is unpacked, so u dont need to unpack anything."
,Pananakot,2010-03-03T17:16Z,"Ah thanks, I figured there was a good reason."
,Robot23456,2010-03-04T06:12Z,"I'm running Windows 7 64-bit and the mouse pointer doesn't move on the screen. I can highlight units, but its impossible to tell where the mouse cursor is at.

Anyone else share my problem?"
,rbvieira,2010-03-04T09:04Z,"I downloaded and when I extract appears an error message saying I need the file ""rzr-spc2.r00"" to continue extraction of the rzr-scp2.iso"
,JuggernautOfWar,2010-03-04T20:26Z,When I point it towards the SID file during install the installer crashes. What's going on? I've got Win7 x64.
,JuggernautOfWar,2010-03-04T20:27Z,"Now that I'm looking at it, the instructions say to extract the rars. I don't have any archives to extract, only a .iso file. Maybe that's what's wrong?"
,JuggernautOfWar,2010-03-04T20:37Z,"Yeah it says ""SimPack.exe has stopped responding and needs to close"" every time I try to insert the SID address."
,pertti18,2010-03-04T22:03Z,"After i have installed the game and try to launch it, I got error: It cant find .exe file? Can some1 give me good instructions because i am noob... Thx"

,chill414,2010-03-07T22:57Z,"Hey. i am having trouble installing, and maybe you can help me.  When i install it, it installs the first SID, then when i put in the second, it says its installed and closes.  Only problem is; how the heck do i start it?"
,chill414,2010-03-07T22:59Z,"Sorry, nevermind i figured it out.  I didnt copy the razor1911 folder to the game folder 8^0"

,elyk123,2011-02-13T13:45Z,"when i am extracting rzr-spc2.iso, it keeps tellin me that a lot of files cant be made. help?!"
,Xyloks,2011-02-22T18:38Z,"So for Steam is there a way to bypass that or do you just have to kinda go through it? 

Sorry I'm pretty noob at this."
,Xyloks,2011-02-22T19:11Z,"Nevermind, Clicked on setup.exe instead of installer.exe my bad."
,Xyloks,2011-02-22T19:49Z,"/sigh sorry to be a pain but this is what I got after installing it. 
Followed the steps. got the crack folder which I assume is called Razor 1911? copied that to the install directory.

When I start it up from the bin folder it says:
Application load error 5:0000065434

Could somebody please help me out with this?"
,jonsaber,2011-03-10T00:53Z,"This torrent does work properly, I have managed to get the game up and running with no problems. Mount the iso normally (or extract the .sid's to a desired directory), once mounted launch the setup and you will be prompted for the first .sid's files. Search(...) for the directory you extracted them or just open the virtual Dvd drive b/c this is where they are located. Ok, the installation should be done by now. In the Virtual-Drive there is a Razor 1911 folder, the contents of this folder are to be copied and replaced with the contents located in the directory were you installed the game (files in the folders, Bin, Gamedata, Movies, Sound). Ex. the contents in the Razor 1991 bin file are to be copied over to the bin file in the game directory. 

Once all the files are copied/replaced... go to the Bin file in the games directory and run the game, everything should work fine from here. 

Enjoy and Good Luck "

,bizmark2000,2011-04-05T13:30Z,"Supreme Commander 2 v1.250 Definitive edition = http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6237979/Supreme_Commander_2_v1.250_Definitive_edition

JUST INSTALL AND PLAY- that Simple, its already cracked and patched.

This game is currently Working, Checked and Tested it. And it works Fine, even better then fine, no buggs at all.

Several things you need to remember:
The installation is so easy that it doesn't need a guide. Just read what it's asking you and press next. It's that easy.

Here are the steeps for really NUUB people.
- First step Install Steam and make an account. then Logoff from steam when installing this crack.
- Mount game
- Choose Language
- If it asks, install Net frame If it doesn't skip this step.
- Tic to install DirectX, Visual C++ and SmartSteam
- Choose Steam Version ( Online Multiplayer ) To play ONLINE.
- When you get the Windows Command (window) do not close until you se the text that it's done and press any key to close. ( The installation is slow so be be patient )
- Mini window will pop up and ask you to choose language. Choose language and close it.
- When the installation is done.
Start (SmartSteam) then to start the game go to Star - All programs - Supreme Commander 2 - And press on (Play.exe)

You are done now. and can play Online with others.

Spread the word ----"
,1989nikhil,2011-06-07T14:04Z,"while running the setup of steam, asking for the product code.

,1989nikhil,2011-06-07T14:16Z,"while running supremecommander2.exe .

,adi5402,2011-07-15T22:38Z,This worked great but i had to get the 5 mb ctc crack from another torrent 
,Furious1964,2011-08-11T11:06Z,"Can anyone help me? I'm stuck at the loading screen and the game won't even start. I have the latest DirectX and everything, but still nothing."
,icepax,2011-11-26T08:01Z,"Works great. Thanks.

Don't have to unrar - I think it's a redundant step in the instruction.

Just mount the ISO with Daemon Tool or VirtualCloneDrive and install.

Then copy the contents under Razor1911 folder from mounted drive to installed folder and overwrite existing files.

Unmount ISO file and play game.

The only gripe I have with this release is you can't save Skirmish games. Damn!..."
,bleakessence,2012-06-09T16:13Z,"if anyone is crashing to desktop while starting a skirmish or the tutorial, search piratebay for a supreme commander 2 crackfix designed for this razor1911 release and uploaded by lan3y. "
