Have you got the latest codecs? With what player do you watch?

http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_lite_codec_pack.htm   this one should solve it"
,Kimoguri,2010-03-16T21:43Z,"G'day,

I use Windows media player 11 and Realplayer SP. All updates applied. I should have any codecs that come with the std versions.

I can't tell what codec was used for this file- What did you use?"
