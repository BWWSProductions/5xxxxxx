"We are here to remind you that pain and fear are not the only methods of growth; that you can more elegantly grow through joy and love. . . that you create your own reality . . . that there is a God/Goddess/All That Is who loves you, who knows your name. . . and that you love good enough"   â€”  Lazaris

Coming Home: Seeking God/Goddess/All That Is â€¦ Finding the Splendor of Your Self (Evening Only)


This eveningâ€™s discussion, the first part of a phenomenal journey into the light, begins with a brief review of the year that for many, too many, was a treacherous one. Though we witnessed or experienced treachery and tragedy, we did not allow that darkness to overshadow the light. We learned to listen to the voices of illumination; more than listen, we learned to hear and to respond. And now we turn to Coming Home. Now we turn to seeking God/Goddess/All That Is with greater resolve and greater light. And what do we find? We can discover the splendor; we can discover the splendor of ourselves.


As the remaining days of this amazing weekend unfolded, Lazaris guided us with a bit of magic and a lot of love as we experienced the search and as we found our splendor. This evening is not the whole of the weekend, but it offers us the map and the gems of this culminating weekend so that we can remember and reunite . . . so that we can again be touched by our own splendor.
