,OverKi11,2010-05-10T21:47Z,"Yes, amazing up sweee, can't wait to finally watch this shit in HD, let alone originals with new scenes!"
,mbm82,2010-06-03T10:07Z,"great quality, the subtitles and translations arent exactly consistent as you go through the episodes (some translations and subtitles on certain episodes better than other ones)... but a great torrent nonetheless and recommended for people who want to watch dbz in a new light. this torrent is the saiyan saga up to around halfway of the freiza saga"
,evirus,2010-06-05T16:22Z,"Major butt hurt with the naming convention, even if you want to maintain who subbed the episodes the least you could do is drop nearly all those ""tags"" or just include the credits in at text file."
