it has only a 45-second
blank screen - no audio or picture.

the rest work fine."
[V],catflap,2010-03-03T23:23Z,"update:

i spoke too soon.

it will not play in windows media player 11.

so i checked it on my standalone dvd players
and episode 3 plays fine.

then i checked it again on my pc. still won't play
in wmp11 - but it does play in GOM player and VLC.

sorry about that dman007. :( it's a great ripping
job otherwise, and i can't figure out why episode 3 is messed up over here."

ps Windows media player is jacked anyways.  "
