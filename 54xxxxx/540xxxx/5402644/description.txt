Southland takes a "raw and authentic look" at Los Angeles and the lives of the LAPD officers who police it. The show's seven episodes center around the experiences and interactions of LAPD patrol officers and detectives, and is more a character-driven drama than a police procedural.Among the characters are rookie Officer Ben Sherman and his training officer, John Cooper; Detective Lydia Adams, who must balance work with responsibility for her mother; Officer Chickie Brown, who aspires to be the first woman on the elite SWAT Team; and Detective Sammy Bryant, whose home life interferes with his working life.
