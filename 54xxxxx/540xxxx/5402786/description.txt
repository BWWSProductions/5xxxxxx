This is milestone release 1B of NoZone. It's been greatly improved over 1, but it's still not complete. Milestone 2 will come when I'm ready to do some major 3d modelling work, and that might not be for a while. Milestone 3 will be when I start to code, but that's a long way off. For now, the game is fairly polished and playable.

As before, to install and play:

1) Unpack .7z files.
2a) Run nozone.bat to start the game.
2b) Or server.bat to start a local server.

Again my testing server at 80.177.160.241 will be up peridoically. I desprately need beta testers now, so please join. Please? Preetty please with a great big cherry on top? Ah, fuck you.
