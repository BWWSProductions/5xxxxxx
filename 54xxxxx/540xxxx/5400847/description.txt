# This tool requires lazylaunch v2.0 or higher. ### (I have included it in there + the AI enabled Maps!).

This allows you to play Single player AI (Even though they are crap).  Allows for a Graphical interface for ease of play!

Instructions:

# Put all files directly in Starcraft II folder
***(MAKE SURE YOU USE THESE MAPS AND NOT THE REPLAY ONES FROM THE OTHER TORRENT)***.
|- Maps
|- AI
|- Starcraft II - Beta Launcher.exe
|- ReadMe.txt
|- Lazylaunch2

# HOWTO: Add new maps
To add new maps, just put them directly in "Maps" folder.

# HOWTO: Add new AI
To add new AI, create a folder with the name of your difficulty into "AI" with "Base.SC2Data" file in it.
ex. "AICustom Starcrack V3"
|- "Base.SC2Data"
