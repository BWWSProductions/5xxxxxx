,the_perfect_one,2010-03-07T22:46Z,"Hi, great torrent, as the others that you put.

This one is giving me problems...
I have a PS2 SCPH-30004, with Swap Magic 2.0, but also a copy of Swap Magic 3.8.

Burned it in: 
-a DVD-R Fujifilm (16x) at 1x
-and a DVD-R Sony (16x) at 8x

Both times, after I press down the ""X"" button in my pad and disapear the scren of the swap magic... simply nothing happens... just a black screen.

Should I rebuild it?








Just a note, I have games that I burned that work: PES 2010, Twisted Metal: Head On, The Warriors, GTA:SA, Smash Tournament 2, Moto GP 2008.
But at the same time: NBA 2009, TOCA 3, Tiger Woods PGA 2010... doesnÂ´t work any....


(Sorry about my english)

,the_perfect_one,2010-03-25T22:59Z,"@PowerJam 
First of all, thanks a lot to care. :)
But if I may ask, do you have some reason to think that by burning with alcohol 120%??
Don't take it in a wrong way, just trying to understand why it will work, since DVD Drecrypter ia a fine fine tool. :)"
,MoleP,2010-08-13T06:41Z,"@the_perfect_one, 
DVD Drecrypter is fine tool!
But you should burn it at 4x speed, Thats all "
