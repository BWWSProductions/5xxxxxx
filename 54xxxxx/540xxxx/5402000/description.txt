one biggest show's on judy i have have ever seen.
i received this about 7 year's ago , & only came about it
six week's ago whilst i was looking for something else.

any who set list is big and i don't or was not sure on title
for certain song's so i was picking from verses & chorus's in the song's
i not knew the title's for , so feel free too help me correct
the correction will not be made too the torrent, only too
the post on marleyandtoshtorrent.net , so if you on public open site and see
this i urge you follow my url for greatest ride of a life in reggae music & history
in it all. lastly this show has few problems judy was laste intoo the show due 
too transportation and threw out judy talks crowd and sound & lightin enginer's
too fix lightin & the vocal presence on mic's on the backing & on her's, apart
from that all gets sorted & show is paramount too i & i my fav song so far on this show
is track 14 What The World Needs Now.
