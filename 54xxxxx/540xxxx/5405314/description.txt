Alex talks with Brad Martin, a local business owner in Cornelius, Oregon. Martin was raided by ATF agents in October for the crime of selling Airsoft BB guns from his store. The merchandise is valued at $12,000 and the ATF has vowed to destroy it as a threat to the public.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
