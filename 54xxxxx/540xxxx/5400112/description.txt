       3/4 - USA
       Jimmy Doherty sets out to discover if the world's farmers will be 
       able to feed us in the future. Demand for food is expected to 
       double within the next 40 years. Yet we can only grow food on four 
       per cent of the earth's surface, the climate is changing and 
       resources like water and fuel are under threat. Jimmy meets the 
       men and women who claim to have new techniques and new 
       technologies that will help meet these challenges.
       
       Jimmy visits the USA, the greatest food-producing country on earth. 
       The farmers have put their faith in new technology to increase food 
       output, but is it enough? In search of answers he visits the tomato 
       fields and bioscience labs of California, a high-output pig farm in 
       Iowa, and gets a taste of the Wild West while herding buffalo in 
       South Dakota. Yet it's a farm in North Carolina that offers the 
       most surprising approach of all.
