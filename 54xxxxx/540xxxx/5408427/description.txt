             FileConvert is a batch PDF conversion software for               
             turning existing files, like scans, faxes, and Word              
             documents into searchable PDF. It will watch for new             
             scans from a network scanner or crawl for files to               
             convert. If you scan with a desktop scanner, look at             
             FileCenter. But if you want to convert network scans             
             or update existing files to searchable PDF, you need             
             FileConvert.

             1. Unpack and install.                                           
             2. When asked for a key, choose trial option.                    
             3. Replace the main .exe with the included one.

      Always remember to block applications (or go off line) from calling
