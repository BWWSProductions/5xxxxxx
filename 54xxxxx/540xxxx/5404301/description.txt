According to Cassady, the New Earth Army is changing the way wars are fought. A legion of â€œWarrior Monksâ€ with unparalleled psychic powers can read the enemyâ€™s thoughts, pass through solid walls, and even kill a goat simply by staring at it. Now, the programâ€™s founder, Bill Django, has gone missing and Cassadyâ€™s mission is to find him.
