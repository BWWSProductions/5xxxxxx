During their various adventures, Kei and Yuri, along with sometime partners Mughi and Nammo, set out to solve crimes, arrest criminals, and cause varying amounts of destruction. The characters and setting, and possibly some of the stories, are based upon a set of novels by Takachiho Haruka.

The final 2 episodes were first released as an OVA called Dirty Pair: With Love From the Lovely Angels.
