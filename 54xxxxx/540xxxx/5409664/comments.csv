,Rozyx,2010-06-16T19:02Z,Too bad that this one doesn't work in WiNdows 7. It crashes what ever I try to do.
,jatimatik,2010-07-25T12:09Z,Works just fine with Win7 64-bit without any compatibility modes. Run setup and game as administrator.
,Yugemossy,2010-09-23T10:26Z,Thanks for the shit torrent. This thing is chocked full of spyware.
,dustman_01,2010-10-31T22:37Z,"speed is ok for me dl @ ~1.6mb/s upload around 140-150kb.seeding from a seedbox for 2 days.enjoy,and thank you!"
,evilan,2010-11-14T14:18Z,"This is only a standard sof setup from the year of 2000.

A sof setup has been recreated by this game-community in 2010, check the torrent here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5956534

that community torrent has support websites, and the setup is optimised for multiplayer-experience."
,Sohan11,2011-02-09T11:48Z,It works on my computer
,ViscEV,2011-02-18T00:09Z,"Found a fix for Windows 7 64 bit.

I honestly have no idea why this works, but it does.

1) Open the game directory that has the SoF.exe file in it.

2) Copy SoF.exe elsewhere (like your desktop).

3) Rename the SoF.exe file that's in the game's directory folder to ""mohaa.exe"", without the quotes.

4) Copy the SoF.exe file that's on your desktop back into the directory.

5) Run the game using the mohaa.exe file. No need for any compatibility mode settings or anything.

Apparently, this works for all Quake II engine games... except Quake II.

Enjoy!

Enjoy!"
,tattash,2011-03-09T15:18Z,what a fuking waste of time!!! did as instructed n fukall ther tosser!!!!!!
,Takehiro,2011-03-20T19:58Z,"Works a treat on Win7/64bit. Simply right click on shortcut, Properties and then Compatability, and set to run in Win98 mode with disabled desktop composition. No renaming of files needed or anything else. It worked for me, it should work for everyone else. Thanks for a great upload!"
,resi10,2011-04-07T13:28Z,"What I did to get SoF working was rename Sof.exe to mohaa.exe

Worked like a charm for me. Good luck to you
Almost forgot....before the rename, copy the sof.exe to another folder. Rename the sof.exe still in it's original location to mohaa.exe then move the copied sof.exe back. I had to do this cause the game wouldn't start without it. Run the game using mohaa.exe

this trick works for all Quake 2 engine games so far except Quake 2. I have an Nvidia but it also works on ATI cards =)"
,megaman951,2011-05-04T23:40Z,"@ VISCEV:

renaming sof.exe to mohaa.exe did the trick, the game works for me under win7 x64.  thanks a lot!"
,StarMatt,2011-05-22T21:46Z,"I'm on Vista, and when I try to install it, it just won't do a thing. I click on ""install"" and nothing happens... Do you know what to do ?"
,fr8nck,2011-06-14T00:14Z,Which file does I have to mount on the CD?
,merx987,2011-07-02T10:46Z,YES it works for any WINDOWS system including 7
,VirtualSpooky,2011-07-08T09:46Z,"Hmm this doesn't seem to be a working torrent for me. I normally have no problem with these types of files.
My problem is this - I extract using .7z or winrar, mount the disk image inside, then click the setup.exe. It brings me to the main SoF page where it says 'play' 'install"" 'etc. etc. etc.' and of course I click install.
Well, that's where it leaves me. Seems to crash, but still running in task manager. 
Any help? I'm using Win7 64"
,VirtualSpooky,2011-07-08T10:34Z,StarMatt it sounds like you and I have the same problem.
,Razr92,2011-07-14T02:34Z,umm I installed it on my Win 7 32 bit n it works without any compatibility or admin mode :/
,Schwa7,2011-09-22T22:58Z,"I've tried everything people before me have said (run as admin, 256 color, compatability mode, rename, etc.) and it still crashes on startup. Anybody have anything else to try?"
,Chris_Yaz,2011-10-01T11:26Z,I have distorted graphics to a serious level - tried unistall & reinstall and didn't work. Any help from the uploader ?
,mw2pro123,2011-11-03T15:20Z,"@ViscEV That solution also works for Win7 32bit, THANK YOU SO MUCH! I love this game, thanks for sharing your info!"
,GIjoe346,2012-02-07T08:58Z,"doesnt work for me, the game starts ok, but wen i try to load the tutorial or a mission the game goes to the loading screen with the bullets, then it just freezes on that screen and doesnt load, im on vista. Any ideas????"
,dmmm123,2012-05-25T14:13Z,"I'm having the same problem as VirtualSpooky. I'm trying to install the game on Win7 (not x64), and every time I enter setup from the splash screen where it says 'Play', 'Install', etc., the small setup window with a loading bar appears in the bottom right corner of the screen, loads to 100%, and then hangs for a few minutes before it just...disappears. The processes that are still working afterwards are ""_ISDel.exe"" from the ""Setup"" folder, and ""_INS5576._MP"".
Can anybody tell me why I can't install the game at all? I tried running in compatibility mode, as admin, everything."
,dmmm123,2012-05-25T14:30Z,"Come one people, I really want to play this game. This disappearing setup is getting on my nerves! Nothing works!"
,Semblance,2012-06-23T07:31Z,"Works fine for me, thanks a lot."
