The Angelic sound of St. Vincent emanates from Annie Clark, a musician who lent her musical skills to the Polyphonic Spree and Sufjan Stevens before composing her own intricate pop songs. We'll feature a full band performance of songs from her critically-acclaimed release Actor on Morning Becomes Eclectic at 11:15am.

There's a short drop during "The Strangers," but the audio picks up quickly and the rest of the recording is fine.
