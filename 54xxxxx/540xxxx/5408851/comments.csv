,ChrisIIX,2010-03-04T20:58Z,"Hmm, it doesn't work on my 5.00 M33. How should I solve this?"
,chokethetalker,2010-03-04T21:34Z,"It is patched to work with cfw 5.50 GEN D-3. I'm not sure if it works with any other cfw, as that is what I am running. I apologize for not including that in the description. If anyone else can get it to run on another cfw, please post."
,ChrisIIX,2010-03-04T22:07Z,"Alright, then I'll go install that. This line of game is pretty much the sole reason I own a psp."
,theman004,2010-03-05T04:26Z,I installed it on 5.50 gen D3 and when i try to save it shuts off. One time i was playing and the loading screen for a game ran for 3 minutes until i just rebooted.
,tpbfan111,2010-03-05T23:49Z,me too this game is bugged or bad upload

I'm having the exact same problems. All other modes are fine; just RttS for some reason. I will work on this problem. Again, I apologize, but at least there's a little taste here..."

Please post if this works for anyone else, thanks."
