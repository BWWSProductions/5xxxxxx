 Another of the "Fate and Irony" films from              
 director-writer-producer-actor Hugo Haas but this one   
 has less hair-shirt torment than most of his offerings, 
 although his camera, as usual, lingers provocatively on 
 the contours of the leading lady and, in this case, the 
 leading lady is more than well-contoured. Mary Adams    
 works in a tawdry waterfront restaurant where the owner 
 not only maltreats her, he also cheated her father out  
 of a fortune years ago. The owner acquires $25,000 in   
 an illegal transaction, which Mary promptly steals,     
 hides, confesses her crime and serves a short sentence. 
 Freed, she goes to work in a restaurant owned by        
 Dragomie Damitrod and when he gets into trouble over a  
 gambling debt she offers to help him by telling him     
 where the $25,000 is hidden and she will loan him the   
 amount he needs. But circumstances indicate that he has 
 stolen all of the money and she clouts him on the head  
 with a whiskey bottle, apparently killing him. She then 
 learns that he didn't steal the money, digs it up and   
 donates it to an orphanage and then surrenders to the   
 police where she learns that Damitrod is not dead.      
 Well,dang. But all is not lost as she seems to be       
 heading for matrimony with fisherman Johnny, who has    
 been hanging around romancing her at her various jobs   
 between jail stints.
