This CD is (mostly) full of â€˜50s and â€˜60s style blues harp tunes, along the lines of music first heard from Little Walter, James Cotton, Rice Miller, and others. The album really is a labor of love for Estrin, as he covers songs by many of the artists that have influenced his own playing (4 of Rice Millerâ€™s tunes)....
