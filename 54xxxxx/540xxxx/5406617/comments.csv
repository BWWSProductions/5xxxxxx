,Robot23456,2010-03-04T06:12Z,"I'm running Windows 7 64-bit and the mouse pointer doesn't move on the screen. I can highlight units, but its impossible to tell where the mouse cursor is at.

Anyone else share my problem?"

Set it to be in Windowed Mode. 
I'm running Windows 7 32bit and I share that problem but when you set the game to windowed mode the mouse moves again, you can just maximize it after you start it up anyway so no real biggie there"
