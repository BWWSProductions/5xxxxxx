          Blood Moon Rising is an amazing independent film set      
          somewhere in California. The year is 1969. An ancient     
          curse has spilled over into the world of the ordinary     
          living, with werewolves, vampires, and zombies shedding   
          bucketloads of blood. In short, Tristan (our vampire) is  
          not a bad guy despite his undead status, and he was in    
          love with a girl named Lucy. Tristan's former wife, the   
          daughter of the Devil, doesn't take the news of Tristan's 
          love affair with Lucy very well, and she curses Lucy to   
          become a ravenous werewolf roaming the Earth for all      
          eternity...that is, unless a silver bullet pierces her    
          heart and kills her. Lucy's death brings the daughter of  
          the Devil back from Hell. She returns not just for revenge
          but to find a talisman, which, together with a book bound 
          in human flesh and inked in blood (yes, a bit like Evil   
          Dead in that regard, I know) that, if finished by the hand
          of an unwilling virgin, will unleash Hell on Earth. So, it
          is up to a hippie chick, Sadie Hawkins, and a comic       
          book reading soda Jerk, Darrel Lee, to save the world, but
          not without alittle help from a group of indie film reject
          shooting a zombie flick in a town called Desolation.
