The congregation at St. Matthew's Episcopal Church, in Prosser, WA, has suggested that the Reverend Jennings invite the Ghost Hunters to come in to examine a number of strange sounds, smells, and sights. Back in New England, TAPS then goes to the Sprague Mansion in Rhode Island, a beautiful building with ghost sightings dating back to 1925.
