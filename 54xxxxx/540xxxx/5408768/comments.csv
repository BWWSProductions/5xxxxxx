Thanks for the generosity. But...! Is this a real one or a fake one. This file cannot be mounted with either daemon tools or alcohol."
,lykknis,2010-03-14T19:46Z,"Who the fuck tries to mount an .exe with daemon tools? Your problem isn't me, it's that your a massive fuckup."
,blue_star,2010-03-15T05:35Z,You are a fucked up slut. That is why you upload such rotten meaningless files. A 500 MB game exe. file can never be of just 96 KB. This is either a virus or a fake one. At least everyone is intelligent enough not to download this crap (there are never any leechers for this file). Only you can go fucking up this shit on PIRATE BAY.  
,Rage613,2010-05-09T17:18Z,Works PERFECT! Follow simple directions. Thanks
,lykknis,2010-09-12T10:20Z,^^^^^ See...
