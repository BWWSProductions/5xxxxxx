Options:

- Switch player team (switch to spectator for god mode)
- Telefly (allows you to fly with ASDW / Space buttons)*
- Teleport (teleport people to you or to others)**
- Gravity (lower the gravity for better telefly)
- Infinite ammo (speaks for itself)

*Select yourself (or someone else) and click on the "host textbox".
now you can enable telefly. If you put some1 else in the "host textbox" you will be able to control their movement with your movement keys.

**Select the player you want to teleport and click on the "who textbox"
next select the person you want to teleport to and click on the "to textbox".
You can click on the teleport button or just press 'V'
