             Process Lasso is a unique new technology that will,              
             amongst other things, improve your PC's                          
             responsiveness and stability. Windows, by design,                
             allows programs to monopolize your CPU without                   
             restraint -- leading to freezes and hangs. Process               
             Lasso's ProBalance (Process Balance) technology                  
             intelligently adjusts the priority of running                    
             programs so that badly behaved or overly active                  
             processes won't interfere with your ability to use               
             the computer!                                                    
                                                                              
             Process Lasso also offers an assortment of ways to               
             take full control of how your CPUs are allocated to              
             running programs. You can choose at what priority                
             processes should run, and which CPUs should be                   
             assigned to them. You can also disallow certain                  
             programs from running, log all programs run, keep                
             programs running, and SO much more.                              
                                                                              
             * Prevent processes from monopolizing the CPU(s)                 
             * ProBalance dynamic priority optimization                       
             * Apply persistent priorities and CPU affinities                 
             * Foreground boosting                                            
             * Limit number of program instances                              
             * Disallow programs from running                                 
             * Keep processes running (auto-restart)                          
             * Unique system responsiveness graph                             
             * Event logging                                                  
             * Supports multiple users                                        
             * Stand-alone process management engine                          
             * Extremely low resource use                                     
             * Much more...                                                   
                                                                              
             Once you install Process Lasso, it'll just start                 
             working. More advanced users can tweak the                       
             configuration, but you needn't touch anything to                 
             have it instantly improve your system responsiveness             
             and prevent stalls in high load situations.                      
                                                                              
             For network admins, Process Lasso works wonderfully              
             on Terminal Servers and in multi-user environments.              
             We have many clients that have been using Process                
             Lasso on their Terminal Servers for years.                       
                                                                              
             Process Lasso is written in native C++, not .NET.                
             This means it consumes very few system resources -               
             considerably less than any similar software.                     
             Furthermore, the process management engine is                    
             independent from the GUI. This means it can run                  
             without the graphical interface (GUI).                           
                                                                              
             Graphical Interface Features                                     
             * Basic task manager capabilities for convienence                
             * Displays per-process CPU history
