Biography:

VirgÃ­nia Rodrigues is a Brazilian singer.
She grew up singing in church choirs in her native Salvador, Bahia. Caetano Veloso has been involved with her recording career since the beginning, having first heard her sing at a rehearsal of the Olodum Theatrical Group.

It was in 1998 that international audiences first heard the extraordinary voice of Brazilian diva Virginia Rodrigues. She'd been 'discovered' by an ecstatic Caetano Veloso, in a rehearsal with a theatre group in her hometown of Salvador da Bahia, the epicentre of Afro-Brazilian culture.

Veloso was so impressed by her rich, almost operatic contralto that he became her mentor and musical director, initiating the recording of her first album Sol Negro and its follow-up NÃ³s in 2000.
