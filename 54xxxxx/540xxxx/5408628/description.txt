This is an incredible debut by the boys, well worth the wait...saw them in Melbourne in mid-January supporting Every Time I Die, and they were absolutely amazing..stubborn crowd though :/ ... so hop on the HvH bandwagon :):):)instant satisfaction guaranteed ;) (unless you don't appreciate real music :))
