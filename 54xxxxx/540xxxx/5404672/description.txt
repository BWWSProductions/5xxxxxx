Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
Were a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We dont earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then dont hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.


twice the fun   / double the trouble


REPACK Notes:

Somehow our previous ISO got some bad sectors. This repack is
corrected. We apologize!


On with the game release information:

Ghost Pirates of Vooju Island brings adventurers to the
Azurbbean Sea, a place vaguely similar to the Caribbean Sea of
the late 1600s. Its an upside-down sub-tropical paradise

unusual places! Explore over thirty locations and get
acquainted with a cast of unique and crazy characters as the
