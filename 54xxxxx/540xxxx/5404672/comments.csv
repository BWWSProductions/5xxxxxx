,Docoptik,2010-03-07T10:45Z,"I also having problem with the load system (i have the repack version).
I have found from a forum this solution: 

* Open the ""Documents"" (XP: ""My documents"" folder and then the Ghost Pirates folder.

* Open the file ""14793.bin"" with a text editor.

* Change the line

to

(just change the ""False"" to ""True"";)

* For Windows Vista/ Windows 7 change the line

to

(Just change the value part. The right windows user name is important! I've chosen ""Nikos"" for this example)

* For Windows XP change the line

to

(Just change the value part. The right windows user name is important! I've chosen ""Nikos"" for this example)

* Save the changes and close the file.

* Start the game.

The game should now automatically load the autosave savegame after the title loading screen of the game. Therefore the screen could stay black for a few seconds. If the main menu appears again, just leave the game and try it again.


It worked for me but the problem is that you will play from the autosave point not when you last save.
BUT i thought a solution:

* After you do all the above steps, play the game and choose save.

* Go to (for XP) C:\Documents and Settings\Nikos\My Documents\Ghost Pirates

* View the files in Detail mode so you can see now the name, the size AND the date of each file.

* Look for the BIN file with the most recent date (for instanve mine is 1267925374.91)

* Open that file with the text editor (notepad).

* Copy everything inside.

*Now open the Autosave bin file with the text editor.

*Erase everything inside and paste the lines you just have copied.

* Save and exit from the editor.

* Run the game

* With the first steps the game automatically load the autosave savegame and with the last steps you 've changed your last save as autosave, so now you will play from the point you have left the game

* Enjoy!!"

-------------------------------------------------------
SIMPLE METHOD
Problem is now fixed, it appears that the game doesn't like it if you have your regional settings in Windows set to Greece or whatever. If you turn them to ENGLISH (UK), then the game doesn't crash every time you hit the load button. I'm now enjoying playing the game.
