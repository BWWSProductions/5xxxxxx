  Two unpopular teenagers, Gary and Wyatt, fail at all attempts to be accepted
  by their peers. Their desperation to be liked leads them to "create" a woman
  via their computer. Their living and breathing creation is a gorgeous woman
  Lisa, whose purpose is to boost their confidence level by putting them into
  situations which require Gary and Wyatt to act like men. On their road to 
  becoming accepted, they encounter many hilarious obstacles, which gives the
  movie an overall sense of silliness.
