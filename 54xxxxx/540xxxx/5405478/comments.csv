if u dont have SLIC2.1 u need to use a good win7 loader to activate it.

burn the ISO on DVD & boot from it, installation is same as Vista. do a CLEAN INSTALL.. & after ur installation is complete, use a loader to activate it.."
,noriki,2010-03-13T15:20Z,"It is possible to use it without trouble ..anything.. though it installed in Latitude E6400 this OS.

,redwalnut,2010-03-17T15:48Z,"@layue:

OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer.
in this case Dell. which takes the product from M$ [windows 7], re-brands it [u get the DELL logo in system properties & DELL watermark on Windows Media Centre], & activates it with the brand specific [e.g. Dell, HP, Lenovo etc..] volume activation key provided to it.

- u can use any amount of RAM with x64 system [preferably more than 2 GBs].

- u can use the restore disc that came with ur PC or the factory restore partition on ur hard drive to restore ur PC to the original Out Of the Box state.."
,layue,2010-03-17T16:22Z,sorry to say that but I didn't get any restoration disk. By the way way which laptop due you have and please help me out
,redwalnut,2010-03-17T16:47Z,"@layue:

I've Studio 1555.
Dell PCs come with a recovery partition on the hard drive. U must b having a setup disc with u that came with ur PC. boot from that disc & select repair PC option, in that u can get the restore from the system image option, there u can select the partition on which the DELL image is stored [it is generally a 10gb partition].

but tell me, y u wanna restore ur PC to factory settings at all?
u've downloaded this setup, right?
then burn it on a DVD & just do a clean install?
I didn't get the point in restoring ur PC to factory settings.."
,redwalnut,2010-03-17T16:52Z,"@layue:
r u aware that if u restore ur PC to factory settings, u'll lose all ur data as well as all the partitions u created on it.

ur PC will be restored to the state as it came from the factory..
what exactly do u wanna do?"

,redwalnut,2010-03-17T18:29Z,"@layue:
come on man,
i can see that u r already seeding a version of windows 7 @ TPB...
so I'm pretty much sure that u r well aware about this Installation monkey business..

what exactly is ur problem?

i'm glad to help & I guess i'm already helping a lot of Dell users out there by sharing the OS..
but come up with some genuine query bro..

I'm not a Kindergarten teacher to start from ABC..

___________________________
Anyway, 
u dont need to restore ur PC based on the problem u r telling. if u've already taken the back-up of ur data, take the following steps:

1. get the updated drivers for the OS u want to use from the DELL website. [display, sound, touchpad, chipset, webcam, bluetooth, & wifi r the drivers of primary importance]

2. burn the setup DVD & boot from it

3. delete all the partitions on the PC by using the installation options during the setup.

4. create a partition of 40 to 50 GBs [depending on the kind of SWs u r gonna install later], & install the system on it. [format/repartition rest of the HDD from management console]

5. use a good antivirus like Avira.

6. properly install all the driver SWs.

7. do a compatibility check b4 installing any 3rd party SW."
,layue,2010-03-17T19:05Z,"Thanks for the information .

The version I am seeding is a test version of 7. I have already searched Google for genuine 7 but I couldn't get it. 

But with your answers I feel that Now I will get the genuine 7.


I am downloading it and it says that it will take 2 days 15 hours .

I have two questions.............

I have checked the dell site and it says that DELL INSPIRON 1525 is not compatible with 7.



The question is

1 Should I install  as the 7 dell says it is not compatible?

2 After installing it do I  require any sort of activation or product key...............?"
,redwalnut,2010-03-17T19:35Z,"@layue:
alright bro. i checked the Dell site too. & ur PC is not in the list.
but still, u update ur BIOS to the resent one [A17].
& make a clean installation of the system..
if it does not autoactivate, check out the link of a good loader i've posted in the previous comment for this torrent..

it shall solve ur problem.

& any PC having a better hardware profile can run the system.."
,layue,2010-03-17T19:43Z,So you means to say that it will auto activate.............and if not then I should use a loader????????????
,layue,2010-03-17T19:47Z,If you do not mind can you tell me from which country do you belong?
,redwalnut,2010-03-17T21:03Z,"ya, i think it might auto activate.. if not use that loader i suggested..
