Plot Outline


Streetballers is for basketball, what Field of Dreams was for baseball. 
Defining street basketball as America's new favorite pastime, it is a 
story driven by passion, faith, and achieving goals. A story capturing 
the poetic nature of street basketball, highlighting the struggles 
endured on and off the court by the purest of athletes. Constantly
earching for sanity in the midst of alcoholism, racism, and drugs, 
John Hogan and Jacob Whitmore, two junior college basketball players, 
find release and therapy while competing at one of the most competitive 
and poetic street courts in the U.S. Both men must spend an entire summer 
helping one another overcome their adversities.
