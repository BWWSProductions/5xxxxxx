,ajones81,2010-03-03T10:37Z,"Thanks, I never knew about the Savage Dragon issues!

BTW, in Savage Dragon 127, Page 13 of 33, what is that anyway? I see the top part seems to have a scanning error, but most of all, is that even part of the comic? Seems like some randomly inserted stuff?"
[T],brodahisou,2010-03-03T18:51Z,"I don't read Savage Dragon so I don?t really know, but from what I can gather Page 11 is part of the comic.  It is drawn by Larsen.  It looks like it is intentionally made to look like an old comic book page, like the 70's and 80's comics.  The characters of Sgt. Marvel and Solar Man are characters within the Savage Dragon universe.  They're basically Erik Larsen's versions of Batman and Superman.  Why it's made to look like an old comic book or what its relevance to the storyline is I couldn't tell you.  Solar Man appears in Savage Dragon #128-135, #137, #139-141.  Those issues might shed more light on the subject."
,ajones81,2010-03-03T23:29Z,"Yeah, I don't read it either, which is why I was confused. Ok, so maybe it's part of the issue, but don't you think the topmost section of that page has a scanning error? Or do you think that repeated portion could possibly be in the original too?"
[T],brodahisou,2010-03-04T02:11Z,It?s not a scanning error; it?s done on purpose to mimic comics from the 70s and 80s.  
,ajones81,2010-03-04T21:42Z,"Sigh... I was talking about the repeated portion on top of that page. I know it's deliberately made to look old.

I've pointed out the section in question here () in case you still don't see what I'm referring to."
,ajones81,2010-03-04T21:51Z,"Stupid TPB, doesn't seem to allow external links. Let me try again:

%68%74%74%70%3A%2F%2F%69%34%38%2E%74%69%6E%79%70%69%63%2E%63%6F%6D%2F%33%31%35%6B%32%31%77%2E%6A%70%67

(Just search for ""Text Unescape Utility"" and unescape it.)"
[T],brodahisou,2010-03-04T23:20Z,"Sigh... that's what some old comics look like.  The printing process was not anywhere near as professional as it is now days and some comics were printed on paper that was very similar to newspaper. There would often be coloration errors and overlap printing.   As I said before, for whatever reason Erik Larsen has done this deliberately.  The repeated portion is not a scanning error it is on the original comic page.  It is meant to look like that."
,ajones81,2010-03-05T22:44Z,"Ah, that clears it up! Thanks for bearing with me. :P

I was thinking that by saying it mimics old comics, you were only referring to the discoloration etc. and not the overlapped printing.

Thanks a lot and cheers! :)"
