CeDigest is the brainchild of Joss Iles A.K.A Avi. It was conceived summer of 2004 and has gained a strong reputation as one of the most brutal EBM acts in europe.

Although often compared to other bands under the â€˜Terror EBMâ€™ flag, CDG brings other elements into the music that not many other acts do. Rooted in classical, metal, trance, and a whole array of other styles of ear candy, CDG promises to take its music to new, unexplored territories.
