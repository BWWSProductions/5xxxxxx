,tuggtugger,2010-03-06T18:44Z,"this torrent is really inching along.
i just wanted season 7 and it was going pretty fast for the first bit, but i'm only missing 5% and it's going at 0.5 kB/s ( 5% of season 7. roughly 40 mB)"
,teen4ersb,2010-03-09T17:24Z,"we need seeds!, plz."
,thaladdas,2010-03-15T08:34Z,dammit its going slow
,thaladdas,2010-03-15T08:35Z,i just wanted season 7 and its going like o.1 0.2kb
,smallfry22,2010-05-25T06:27Z,can you reseed this PLEASE!
,bertvid,2010-05-29T16:55Z,What a jerk off! The files are in two different formats. Why would anyone do that? Idiot!
,deathtrooper30,2010-07-08T02:42Z,Stupid fuckers!
,mkh0x45,2010-08-04T13:44Z,"This is the biggest bunch of clusterfuckery I have ever seen, clearest example of leeching assholes I have ever been witness to.  I am sitting here watching the seeds drop at a rate of like 1 per hour to under 200 and since I've started this torrent the leeches have gone from around 800 to over a thousand.  Clearly there are some of you in the torrent community who do not understand how it works.  I will NOT be seeding this once I am finished, apparently there is a huge convergence in the venn diagram of torrent users who are selfish pricks and people who like two and a half men and I dont feel like helping people who don't feel like helping me."
