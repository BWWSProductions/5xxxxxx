,PinkPuspe,2010-03-03T07:39Z,nice episode. this is legit.
,leevi1974,2010-03-03T09:04Z,"this is rar'ed, will NOT seed"
,baretoof,2010-03-03T09:33Z,thanks
,Massim0,2010-03-03T11:10Z,Why use rar for such a small file size?? makes no sense at all
,MitsEvX,2010-03-03T11:20Z,"Fantastic! On television at friday's in The Netherlands, but I can watch it now! :D"
,micktalbot,2010-03-03T14:23Z,"massim0, it makes perfect sense for us who have just a little bit of knowledge of the scene."
,zophras,2010-03-03T16:57Z,"micktalbot, clearly the ""scene"" are a bunch of cretins. It's not 1992, we don't need fucking rars."
,LostLocke,2010-03-03T18:49Z,"ugh rar, but it seems to be that way this week so ill have to DL"
,ExecutorE,2010-03-03T21:17Z,"rar is for stupid people who still think we all use dialup or some crap. Soon as I have this, I'll unpack, and stop seeding (or seed the actual single file without the bullshit). "
,ExecutorE,2010-03-03T21:23Z,"aha. Someone already did.

suck it, rar people."
,true_lucifer,2010-03-03T22:10Z,"true. you cant expect people to keep it seeding for long. seeds that way will drop rapidly, my guess that 7/10(to say the least) people will dump the rar'd pack as soon as they unpack it. just as said by other fellas above...
Thanks for the upload anyways"
,apple_juice_82,2010-03-03T23:05Z,.raaaaaar!
,apokalypse24,2010-03-04T04:36Z,thx god for this pure torrent
,2Stoned2Frag,2010-03-04T18:36Z,"If you don't like .rar files don't download. Besides what is so hard about unpacking rar archives? For multiple files just select .001 file and unpack, winrar will automaticly unpack all the archives and you have the single extracted file. And another thing, almost 75% of the downloads go faster than when you download one big single file."
,Agathon_81,2010-03-05T00:13Z,"Thx for the upload.
I'll prefer a fast rar-download compare to a slow sigle file download anyday!"
,s20dan,2010-03-12T16:54Z,And I'll prefer a fast single download to a fast Rar download.
,crazychicken123,2010-03-21T15:39Z,"Unfortunately, whatever the reasoning the folks who insist on rar'ing have, the fact is that the chance of seeding is MUCH higher with a single file. Otherwise you have to use up DOUBLE your disk space - one version for viewing, one for seeding. I'm tight on space so only seed the single file versions."
