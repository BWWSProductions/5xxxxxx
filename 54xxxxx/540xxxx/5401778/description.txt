Techno Soft - Thunder Force II, III, IV Original Sound Version Collection
Vertiphon 2010 Remaster

This torrent contains the 91 tracks that comprise the soundtracks for the Sega Genesis games Thunder Force II, III and IV by Techno Soft.  Techno Soft released a variety of game soundtracks, some containing this music, but they're insanely hard to track down and very old now.

As with my Gunstar Heroes OSV remaster, I have added some sympathetic mastering, made appropriate edits and rearranged the tracklist so that it makes for a better listen as an "album" (watch out for the continuously segued "boss medleys" on III and IV).  This is some of the very best music the Sega Genesis had to offer, and seeing as a few nabbed my Gunstar Heroes torrent I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, it's one of my favourite Sega Genesis soundtracks.
