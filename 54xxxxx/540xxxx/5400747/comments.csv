,SageBear,2010-03-01T05:46Z,"Does this torrent include the commentary? The ""full game"" replay available on the official site had the game with no voice-overs.. and I can't tell who's who on my little screen without them :o)"
,rugburn11,2010-03-01T06:09Z,"We appreciate you effort but I'll wait for the

 High Definition version.

,MTLGENTLEMAN,2010-03-01T08:25Z,"Thank you for ALL the UL during the Olympics !!!

Well done !"
,reaperfudo,2010-03-01T09:20Z,"This video is from NBC with commentary, from HDTVÂ source, but encoded at 624x352 with MPEG-4 video and MP3 audio.

I wonder if there's a CTVÂ version out there... I prefer the Canadian commentators. "
,WaveDT,2010-03-01T13:57Z,Can someone post Canada vs Slovakia semifinal and Russia vs Slovakia preliminary round.  Thanks - starved for hockey where I live!
,syndre,2010-03-01T15:06Z,"reaperfudo!!
THIS a thousand times!

I cannot stand that Pierre faggot, I just want to shoot him in the face"
,scatattack,2010-03-01T16:23Z,"Thanks for the up. I've never watched ice hockey before, but I'll watch this game. I'm a big fan of Canada/Canadians and I'm proud of you guys. P.s  This is Gary from Ireland wishing you all the best in future events in the uk. God bless Canada :')"
,sinshixxi,2010-03-02T01:38Z,"Their golden goal is truely epic, that's why they were crying like bitch with silver medal after losing in OT. Anyways is a great game and I bet no US people will download this torrent lol"
,freakindawg,2010-03-02T05:56Z,"Great game. Both teams played really well and were exhausted in the end. It came down to who wanted the gold medal the most. That's the way hockey goes. The Canadians were decidedly the better team and overall, the best country at the games. 14 gold, baby!"
,freakindawg,2010-03-02T10:15Z,"@syndre

At least McGuire knows his hockey. American colour commentators don't know the first thing about hockey, let alone the announcers. We're better off with the CTV broadcast."
