,InfoWarriorSam,2010-03-04T04:17Z,Nice Download and quality 9/10. Shame the last few seconds of each track is cut off but can't complain about such a quick release.Thanx Uploader!
,assmunch3,2010-03-04T07:28Z,"yea the cd goes into sub tracks that eac didnt pick up. (nothing more than 1/2 second).

i reccomend buying this one and hearing it without pause. great cd and the packaging is well thought out"
,petevspete,2010-03-07T09:18Z,"Thanx again... great album...Went out and bought it yesterday, and pre-ordered the vinyl... Yeah, the way it cuts out cannot be avoided on the rip, unfortunately, it's just the flow of the album.. As stated previously, its only about half of a second, so it's not that big of a deal..."
,assmunch3,2010-03-07T18:14Z,i've t my vinyl on preorder also. cant wait. i think something this good deserves a proper listen.
