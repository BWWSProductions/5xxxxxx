,WeedWon,2010-03-04T20:37Z,"I registered just to say:

THANK YOU UPLOADER!!! This DVD came out, what... 2 days ago?



GREAT _FUCKING_ job with this torrent... I thought there was maybe a 5% chance I would actually find this DVD online without having to buy it, and you came through... and for that, I am forever greatful and will show my gratitude with seeding.



I'll be seeding this @ 250kbps cap'd until 500:1 ratio, or for 2 months... whichever comes first.



DL speed: GREAT! (AVG. 400kbps so far)

A: Can't comment
