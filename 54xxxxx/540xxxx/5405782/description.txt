Additional Notes:



when i was a kid my mom broke my first pressing copy of doggystyle because snoop was a "murderer"


after that every copy i had was missing stuff but i couldnt put my finger on it. later on in life i found out about the track "gz up, hoes down" being taken off because of sample clearance issues. so basically i bought a copy on ebay after not finding a proper rip on the internet and am now sharing with with all of you.




love,

The infinitely handsome, elite, baller, boss don, social diplomat, trend setter extraordinaire, King Edward The Great!


The best to never do it.


aka Mr. I TOLD YOU SO!




SWALLALUJAH SWALLA BACK!


EARLY!
