@blushroom: Somebody asked for and when I've seen that rip was silly 1.4GB I knew what to do... Thanks.

@stev: Obviously, my torrents draws the people from eztv swarms. Sadly, these people bring their shitty behavior with. So, say'em No. Anyway you can. Choose wisely ""normal"" ones and share with them."
,stev666,2010-03-03T12:32Z,Thanks 20-40 final ration was 3.321 but all is good
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-03T19:37Z,"@stev: ANY ratio during the download above 1:1 indicates sort of ass-raping. One either fed the gremlins or the leechers. It's silly because that prevents people from seeding after download finishes - they have so high ratio already - and by the way - in that moment usually comes to mind that eztv is a ""cheaper"" solution -traffic/bandwidth/cost-wise.
Also, it is totally unwanted 'cause We do not support true, ugly leeching, right?"
