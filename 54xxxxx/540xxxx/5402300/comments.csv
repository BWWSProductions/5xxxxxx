,AD7863,2010-04-12T10:01Z,"Hey guys I finally managed to download this (3 days) works like a charm. Gonna watch it tonight.

I live in the UK so I had to download over 3 nights, don't bother downloading during the day, if your lucky you might get speeds over 1kbps for an hour or two. Not worth it at all. Download during the night if you live in Europe, you will get speeds of about 400kbps, that's if you have the right internet connection of course.

I will continue to seed for a few days."
