,doria001,2010-07-31T19:15Z,This is my favorite show.  If you are having trouble getting it I uploaded it to Gygen.  Better for really large files.  Thanks for a great upload.

Maybe you shouldn't have encoded these yourself. LOL! And no its not my equipment. Tried PC, PS3, Playing strait from my tv media center at 240hz. They all look the same (choppy as hell). just shitty encoding. Nice try..."
,nickces,2011-06-09T07:55Z,"oh and i thought i was the only one with this problem... XxxCutterxxX is right, the frame rate is really bad, it's really choppy 

i wouldn't advise this torrent for anyone else

and no, it's not a problem with my laptop, i have the latest version of the macbook pro and i already tried restarting my laptop and using other video players, and i keep having the same problem"
