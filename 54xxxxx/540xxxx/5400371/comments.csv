,blue_star,2010-03-01T16:23Z,"dark_wizz, i never see seeds whenever i choose to download this file. why doesn't anyone seed ?
this is a really fantabulous(fantastic+fabulous)game but i am never able to download it. plz seed."
,dark_wizz,2010-03-01T18:55Z,"I don't know why u don't see seeders. I'm seeding this since i add it, and see another 67 seeders and 190 leechers. i'm uploading it @aberige speed of 990kB/s so someone should already download it since yesterday."
,blue_star,2010-03-03T17:15Z,"Please dark_wizz,refrain from telling a lie. How is it possible that you have been continously uploading ? I never see even a single seed.  Note the time when I have written this comment and check whether you have been seeding at this time. I bet not."
,Cpt_Quirk,2010-03-05T07:10Z,"no, it's working.  I'm downloading at 200k and seeing 16 active seeds (using Âľtorrent 2.0)"
,cool_kate,2010-03-18T02:59Z,i dont understand how to install this game? 
,blue_star,2010-03-28T10:15Z,cool_kate and digifan18 are both idiots. Why dont you open your eyes and see what's mentioned in the game description area. If you know how to mount this image file.....! 
,Ashlander80,2010-05-16T11:18Z,Installed both games and the patch. But the No CD crack doesnt do anything. Click and nothing happens?
[T],nlx_78,2010-05-29T06:28Z,"Works perfect. Also on Voobly.com to play online with 7 other players (which is more fun then alone). |

Thanks Dark_wizz"
,CoJuarez,2010-06-26T12:19Z,"i cant play, i need to have a cd but i dont got"
,jkpanon,2010-10-17T10:18Z,"Great download, and install went perfectly well, but I don't understand the phrase ""and copy NoCD crack.""  Where should I copy the crack to?  Thank you!  "
[T],nlx_78,2010-11-23T13:11Z,"With copy the crack is meant:

On the CD it's shown a folder called CRACK. When you go in there you'll see the 1.0c patch and in the other folder you see Age2_x1. You copy that file into the folder where you installed your game. Normally in C:/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Age of Empires (or somewhere else when you choose another location). Now you go inside that folder and go inside folder: Age2_x1 and paste what you have in your copy. When it asks what to do you should select: Copy and replace. 

When you can't find your installation folder, just do a search for Age2_x1 and it will find it for you. Hope this is clear, have fun. "
,datbunnii,2011-02-21T18:42Z,"Since no one actually posted a comment being specific about the issue of this download, i will... The installation is fine, mount the disk using Magic Disc, mount it to J: drive, install- easy. I followed the instructions with the install, and patching right after... But unfortunately, when I launch the game using the short cut, it says I have to enter the correct CD-Rom. (The expansion was still in the J: drive) I try launching from My Computer, same thing- launches the game, I hit play, and it says I don't have the CD in the drive... I try unmounting and mounting the non-expansion, still the same issue. Is it because It's not going directly to the J: drive, but instead checking the C: drive? If so, is there another disc mounting program I should be installing besides Magic Disk? Any suggestions would help. Thanks in advance."
,stele22,2011-09-11T02:25Z,"Ty dark_wizz, i was looking for this game, and this one works gr8. For all of u having problems installing the game. 1st mount AoK and install it, copy crack and unmount. Mount AoC, install it and copy crack then unmount it. Then Install 1.0c patch and copy NoCD Crack to folder where u have installed the game. I had to unmount AoK b4 installing AoC cuz i was getting error and could not install AoC when AoK was mounted in other drive."
,piyalsilva,2011-12-29T04:47Z,"I still remember i played this game at my childhood. Great game that i ll never forget. yep agree with u dark_wizz . Really enjoyed those times, even today after 11 years I can rem Genghis khan and Barbarosa"
