It's the same video, sure, but it's just not rarred.  I'm not saying that you should follow me.  All respect to those who originally upload the files, but myself, and a number of other people I know personally, HATE dealing with stuff that's been rarred.  If having a non rarred version is so terrible for you, don't download it.  I'm just providing another option for those who want it this way.
What have you uploaded so far, btw?  Nothing under this name.  So if you aren't going to upload ANYTHING AT ALL, why don't you just keep to yourself?  I'm sure I'm not causing you any problems.
Got a problem with the quality of it?  Fine.  Got a problem with any other aspect of the video, or for some reason it doesn't play?  Fine.  Tell me.  But quit whining that I decided to provide others with another option. Thanks!"

,psut,2010-04-06T04:36Z,"Just wanted to add here, that I've been seeding this for about a month now.  I have a ratio of about 32, and have uploaded 141GB.  The file is 4.4GB.  I hope all of you do the same for everyone else with all of your torrents!  Happy Viewing!"
,psut,2010-04-06T04:37Z,.....all of that means that I'm stopping seeding this torrent for now.

,piratorrentor,2010-12-20T06:12Z,"hope its not too much to ask, but could you upload only JUST the DTS audio by demuxing it from the mkv?"
