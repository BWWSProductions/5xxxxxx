,freejellyman,2010-03-03T14:14Z,"Key worked great on Windows 7 64 bit.
But before I installed I also blocked their domains and IPs in my hardware firewall to prevent the software from calling home."
,freejellyman,2010-03-03T14:16Z,"Below are the things I blocked:

67.228.213.247
75.119.221.229"
,freejellyman,2010-03-03T14:17Z,"dopus.com
gpsoft.com
gpsoft.com.au

and the www of the domains.

If you dont have a hardware firewall, then you can block the domain in the hosts file by redirecting the domains to 127.0.0.1.

Thanks for uploading this!"

Thanks a lot to scenebalance and the uploader, this works great.
This is the way i've installed it, i have :
- dowloaded the trial version 9.5.2.0.3660 from the official web site and install it
- cut my internet connexion
- installed the licence
- added all the sites written previously by Freejellyman in my hosts file (by redirecting the domains to 127.0.0.1.)
- reconnect to internet, and it was done, and it works marvellously :o)
Thank you guys ^^ i love this soft (compare to the windows explorer beeeeeuuuurrrrkk)"
