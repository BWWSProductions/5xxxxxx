,Aces77,2010-03-04T00:23Z,"didn't you guys read the torrent name ...
it said ALICE 2009 not 2010 ... so why the complaining ? 
Thanks BONE ... "
,thadream101,2010-03-04T09:11Z,yes i do retract my statement... i saw the 2009 but thought it was mistake(which happens all the time) and the girl in the sample looks alot like the girl in the new movie....how misleading!!! i will be checking the imdb link from now on
,MeNoob,2010-03-05T12:13Z,"Well this is not the upcoming new movie ?Alice in Wonderland?, but the 2 part mini-series aired on SyFy channel late last year. MOViERUSH released the DVDRip yesterday."
,Jenna_PT,2010-04-07T22:06Z,"Personally I think the torrent name is quite clear.  I don't understand how anyone could mistake it for the movie.  Different name, different year, not to mention the fact that it says ""part 1""... pretty obvious."
