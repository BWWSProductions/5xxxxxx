i already have a collection of met, so i dont want to dl if i already have the stuff.  

you have any idea when this is from?"
,bart001fr,2010-03-04T16:06Z,"yes, some more details are needed, such as whether those files are HQ or simply MQ.

I don't collect middle quality files; they're a waste of time. 

A list of the models and sets would also be greatly appreciated, especially on that big a collection to fill a cd.

It would make a small text file you could put in the comments.
