,skytwin,2010-03-03T01:01Z,"Its real, but nuked...

check scnsrc.net for details"
,skytwin,2010-03-03T01:01Z," anydvd.curruption.dvd1.and.dvd2 

is the reason anyhow"
,lourock21,2010-03-03T01:33Z,What does nuked mean for us idiots??
,drakeno21,2010-03-03T01:39Z,It means SE put code into the game so that people who download the game will turn their 360 into a Nuke and explode upon playing! Be careful! You might need a hazmat suit to play. 
,kelmers,2010-03-03T02:05Z,very funny...but I mean for real...nuked version means not working version anyway or what?
,drakeno21,2010-03-03T02:07Z,"Yeah, there should be a Proper out"
,skytwin,2010-03-03T02:17Z,"yeah, sorry meant to post more :)

Nuked means there's something wrong with the release.  Sometimes they're nuked because they break the rules (not that p2p has any bloody rules but the scene does).  

In this case, anydvd (which decrypts video on the fly) is screwed.  This potentially could alter game data.

I'm hearing mixed things, some say this release will work, others say not.

I'd wait for a fix or a proper to come out if I were you."
,lourock21,2010-03-03T02:24Z,"I am downloading from Vip-file, All I want to know is if it's playable on a banned xbox 360 I don't give a shit about live. and if it's not is there a way to fix it"
,lourock21,2010-03-03T04:23Z,"Well, I finished downloading disc 1 and patched it using the wave patcher and burned it using imgbrn and I haven't had any crasheds yet"
,agreen1027,2010-03-03T05:53Z,can believe someone has already finished downloading from this torrent. what are you guys' download speeds?
,manowx28,2010-03-03T07:59Z,downloading it with 30 k/b
,Bujaaa,2010-03-03T08:48Z,I downloaded this from a private tracker. Disc 1 works fine so far.
,foxdie_3,2010-03-03T09:35Z,"--------------
What's the difference between :

WTF are you doing Allstars ??? you are confusing .... don't you notice that :(
Give us a full description about the torrents you provided earlier .... nuked or corrupted ... you make things even worse ......
----------------"
,tnt3k,2010-03-03T10:12Z,This ff works.  however it has anystyle dvd corruption which will expose you if you have xbox live.  If your console is already banned then no worries.  This will work
,kelmers,2010-03-03T10:15Z,"at last, some great news :)"
,Bujaaa,2010-03-03T11:50Z,"I have 1 question not related to this torrent. I don't play on Xbox Live so my console is not banned. So if i connect to Live only to make dashboard update, can my console get banned? I heard that with banned console you can't install games to your X360 hdd. Is this true?"
,aymanbashir,2010-03-03T12:43Z,can someone plz tell me if this will work on ntsc\j consoles?i really wanna know.
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-03T12:59Z,"@Bujaaa

It always a risk. But why go online ti update? Use CD/DVD or USB stick."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-03T13:08Z,And yes they ban your HD as well. But there is method to unlock it again. :D. But im not going to talk about this here. ;]
,manowx28,2010-03-03T13:25Z,"playing disk 1 right now and have encounter a crash after 10 in the game,  think the crash is random"
,gamergames,2010-03-03T14:17Z,"Thank you for uploading hope its works! its regio free and not ntsc, yess!"
,manowx28,2010-03-03T15:42Z,OMG!!! this games is awsome!!  been playing for 5 hours straight
,railex,2010-03-03T20:30Z,can this be played in asia?i wonder why its only ntcs/u...and not ntsc/j...square.enix is from japan right?anyways stick to first question
,UncleMoe9999,2010-03-04T06:21Z,I thought this was on 4 DVD's for the 360?  Shows only 3 in torrent.
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-04T12:53Z,4dvd version is the  the collector's edition i think. But i can be wrong. Heard some rumor about it.
,lourock21,2010-03-04T15:10Z,I would like to know who started with the nuked shit??? Because I've been playing this game for hours and not one glitch. There are some goofy names though like lightning hope snow. WTF and I hate the battle system
,outcastded,2010-03-04T19:42Z,"I'm having troubles!!! 
I've been downloading many different games the past two years, and I've gotten used to patching the waves of the games to wave 2. 
That's been working until now! 

Now I've burned out three different copies of disc one, but when I try to start the game, a message states that the game requires an update to my software, and I agree to do that. But then the 360 complains that it cannot read my disc! 

I managed to get my console banned from live some time ago, so I cannot download updates through live. 

Is it possible to update the 360 with some software downloaded from the internet and transferred to the 360 from a memory stick?
Would that solve my problem? 
Why else would the game not work? 
I've been using the same verbatim discs all the time. Burning with imgburn.. "
,Bujaaa,2010-03-04T21:20Z,"@ outcasded
Download the dashboard update if you need it from the internet. just google XBOX360 DASHBOARD UPDATE and then copy it to USB stick (you must format USB in FAT 32 file system).Plug the USB stick in your XBOX and then turn it on. The update should be done automatically. I think. Didn't tried doing it like that yet. :)"
,outcastded,2010-03-04T22:11Z,"Thanks.. 
I already solved the problem though. 
I downloaded the console-update at xbox.com, and that was the whole solution to my problem!"
,russ010,2010-03-05T05:29Z,the game isn't even out yet!!!! so how ez would it be to ban anyone that is playing it? 
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-05T12:09Z,"@russ010

This game is a mega release/ban magnet. So playing it before it have bean Verified and released in shops makes it very certain ban. But its up to you. :D."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-05T12:14Z,I will play it on my banned console. And if ilke it maybe i buy it and playing (LIVE) on my none banned console. ;)-
,Access_Denied,2010-03-05T15:55Z,"Sweet, downloading at 500kb/s"
,jotunhammer,2010-03-05T15:57Z,"im already at the end of 2nd dvd and I got to say im dissapointed, I had hopes for something a little more lasting, like FF series use to be, I remember spending 80 hours total to get to the end but after 20+ hours to get to the end of the 2nd dvd is not promising...."
,victoryami,2010-03-05T17:02Z,Does this version works with an ASIA/NTSC-J console? I saw some REGION FREE links in a couple of places.
,badcopy,2010-03-06T00:34Z,"To all wondering about banning!!

C4eva stated that all firmwares pre i xtreme LT
will show on live and be banned any game not ripped with 0800 (aka 360 drive) or not split vid will show!

ALSO its been put to the test updating while your modded will get you flagged and most likely banned you need to flash back to stock then update then back to flashed... it was confirmed to within a thre month span between 6 xbox 360's updating three of them while modding and putting the other three back to stock pre update... all three that were not put back before update failed!

Again the only confirmed route for online play is split vid games runnning on LT firmware ...

Kreon drive lens cannot read at the same angles the 360 drives can so i personally only trust ripping the game my self and burning that way i know its 100% i just come on here for games i know i wont get on live with..

ive also read using upgraded 250 hdd will get you banned..


another souution is the new team xecuter Xdrive its bassical a connectivity kit and fancy plastic case for a secondary DVD drive to keep one stock and one flashed! allowing you to flick a switch and go back and fourth between drives.

also banned xbox 360 cannot yet be unbanned but you can unban your hdd with a transfer cable and xplorer 360 you just have to delete specific files...

,manowx28,2010-03-08T12:01Z,"ok well i didn't knew that, anyway thanks for the warning...and forgive me for calling you num nuts UncleMoe :)"
,manowx28,2010-03-08T12:04Z,"anyway final fantasy 13 is kinda dissapoiting

battle system is not that great, they should have sticked with the turn based thing.

and de graphics may be good....there is just no magic in it."
,jotunhammer,2010-03-08T12:44Z,"Im on the 3d dvd after 23 hours, its becoming better and better....although I had hopes for 40-50 hours of gametime...but its epic still"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-08T12:53Z,"Well i can agree abit. I have played for 3h and its not the FF i expected. Im a FF fan and so far im very disappointed.  The put the fokus on makeing the video's and gfx at top notch and made a terrible game play. Nothing makes any sense and after 3h i totaly lost the interest for the game.

No world map
No side quests..etc...

VERY disappointed Square Enix.

A scale from 1-5 i give it a 2. Just becuase of the gfx."
,manowx28,2010-03-08T14:21Z,"yes true  i think i'm for like 8 hours in the game  and it's like cut scene's all the way.

it just doesn't live up to the hype, well i have to say when i found out nobuo uematsu was not a part of this game, i was very dissapointed...i mean that guy always been the soul of the franchise.


Final fantasy x had no worldmap but still it had that good old ff feeling..turnbased

Sorry, but if it aint broke don't fix it.

i will finish the game but i doubt i will play it again."
,manowx28,2010-03-08T14:24Z,don't know about you guys but my thumb hurt like hell hahahah  bashing the same button all the time
,soro22,2010-03-08T21:47Z,"totaly agree whit sunblock.
this is even worse than ff x-2"
,outcastded,2010-03-08T22:44Z,"Another problem!! 

I just finished the first disc after about 12 hours of game-play. And so the game tells me to insert to next disc. But when I do that, the message states that it's the wrong disc. WHY?? 

I've done nothing wrong as far as I know. I've patched it from wave four to wave two. I burned it the same way as I burned the first disc. And I used the same Verbatim discs! 
Did all the same way as I did with the first disc. 

Just for fun I burned out the third disc, just to see if the 360 would recognize it at all, but it did not. SAME problem. 

Any suggestions?

Maybe I'll just buy the game tomorrow.. It's the release date after all. "
,xchillin,2010-03-09T01:56Z,If this game is so (relatively) short for an RPG; what is so good about it that it required 20-Gigs and 3-DVD's to code? Are the graphics absolutely mind-blowing? For 3-DVD's I would think it would take at least over a hundred hours to play??? There have been many games released that play over 100 hours and they were contained on a single DVD. So what is exactly that requires so much coded information about this game?
,krysthal,2010-03-09T03:18Z,@xchillin the game has a ton of CGI cut scenes that take up a ton of room.
,soro22,2010-03-09T03:18Z,"well this @stupid@ game. contains noting more than 5min walk. then a small or medium video of talk..

then the gruop act like children and leave eact other. then after 20min whit difrent gruops. they end up back together. also forgot the tons whit small talk. and kinda wierd battle style.

story is squareENIX not squaresoft :(
grapi is more than enough decent.

but still not worth buying. its crap.
but cant complaince since i got it free tough ;)"
,proboarder11,2010-03-09T15:27Z,"@sorro22  You are right. Final Fantasy died when X came out. Once you take out the ability to explore it ceases to be a true final Fantasy game. Hopefully they will go back to their roots for the next game.

,soro22,2010-03-09T17:48Z,"yea deletet hard time.

,co30op,2010-03-25T01:10Z,"A couple things.

 Sembu if you have a lite on or benq drive upgrade to LT and you won't need the boot disc.  If you have to use a boot disc put on a DL DVD, but use only the first layer with no specified breaks, burning with DVD decrypter or IMG burn.

Secondly, sinshixxi you don't need a usb key reader for Lite on 83's.  You can do them using jungle flasher, with the tray half open, using the LO83 tool.  And for all other lite on models there's no need for soldering just get the key from the R7 point on the dvd's board.

best place to go for any of those mod or boot questions is robinhoodsplayground com video tutorials"
,cwi87,2010-03-25T19:30Z,"Ok its messed up!
I had dl it, used the fix on both DVD's (1st and 2nd)
and try to burn the first one but its stoped on 94% of finallising disc and retried 5 times to finalise!
I thought maybe I use abgx360 and it actualy burn with succes.
Now what... ? 
Im putting the activate ISO (boot disc) into my X reading it - white screen , then jumping in with DVD1 and what a miracle he reads it! 
theres screen to push any button , next the game wants me to select the memory device, im selecting my hard drive and then theres big nothing - black screen for a half hour now! 
What to do please help me... wanna try FFXIII even if its bad."
,Cloneufc,2010-04-01T23:22Z,"WASTE OF TIME, DONT DOWNLOAD! Disc 1 and Disc 2 have corruption errors. Doesnt pass Abgx360. Disc 3 works fine but that doesnt help if disc 1 and 2 are fucked up."
,sinshixxi,2010-04-08T02:42Z,"@Cloneufc

there's a fix file release for disc1 and 2.  check the other torrent ""Allstar-FIX"" and you don't need to download the whole disc1 and 2 again."
,Cloneufc,2010-04-13T23:48Z,Thanks the allstar fix works. You just place Disc1 and Disc2 iso's and click on fix. You can get the fix here. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5407112/Final.Fantasy.XIII.X360.FIX-Allstars
,Kinslayer120,2010-04-19T00:49Z,"have played the game for about 1 hour.. I watched a movie while i was repatedly pushing (A) I won every fight.. The thing that scares me, is that i'm not kidding=/"
,paulosergio96,2010-04-24T17:23Z,"When i try to use the bat file for the fix it says it doesn't recognize ApplyPPF3 as an internal or external command, operation program or batch file

Any ideas?"
,Termina,2010-04-28T05:38Z,"Kinslayer120,

Yeah, it's really easy at the start. Wait until you get to fight Shiva/Odin.... the difficulty picks up quite a bit. xD"
,sarkissian1,2010-05-13T20:57Z,"Can someone tell how the fix work, with instructions please, i don't want to waste Dl dvd's.
I have downloaded FFX 13 and the fix, what do i do know?"
,m3o,2010-05-21T09:53Z,"hey, just a heads-up - if you are in germany, I got a warning letter from RKA and a fine of 650 euros because of this torrent. So i guess they are monitoring this ...."
,dd32809,2010-05-25T04:42Z,omg. awful. I regret burning one of my Dual Layers for this bullshit. They should have just come out with a fuckin movie. so don't waste your time downloading this bullshit. I'm just glad I burned the first disc to try it out instead of burning all three discs.
,Nimaru,2010-06-07T19:32Z,not being too hasty about stuff but seed please?!
,Zaftikins,2010-06-24T05:07Z,Please do not vote this down before using the FIX found at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5407112/Final.Fantasy.XIII.X360.FIX-Allstars  . I'm not sure why the author doesn't include it in the info (unless you can't edit it after posting -- I wouldn't know myself).
,Amorvulnerat,2010-07-04T14:30Z,"Seeeeeeeeeeeed plsssss!!
Downloading with an average of: 36 kb/s
That's just great while downloading a 20gig file.."
,Rcst11686,2010-07-07T02:23Z,"I had issues loading up Disc 2 . Kept saying wrong disc inserted. So here is the trick for everyone having the same issue.

When prompted to insert disc 2.

Remove Disc 1 - Insert the Boot Disc (Activation Disc) .
You will receive the ""incorrect disc message"" 
Remove the boot disc and insert FFXIII Disc 2.

Now you can play the game. 
Repeat for the 3rd disc as well.

ENJOY! Thx for the torrent!"
,hitsugara,2010-08-22T02:26Z,People with NTSC/J consoles... stay away. The NTSC/J version was never released for asian countries. all you will get is a wrong region error when you try playing the game. unless someone found a fix for this... this torrent is useless for us. T_____T i reallly wanted to play this game T____T
,hitsugara,2010-08-22T02:28Z,"oh yeah...
@wuneo can you please specify that its not an NTSC/J release???"
,B2005,2010-11-11T02:54Z,I have a problem. Burned successfully the dvd and when i put it in the console it says that i need to update. I have no idea of what firmware i have but almost positive i've got a lite-on drive. Is it ok to update?
