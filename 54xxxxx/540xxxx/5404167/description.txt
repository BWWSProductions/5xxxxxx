Plot

The Mason clan of drunks, convicts and deranged cripples is a pox on their community. In keeping with prewar government policies, officials at the Board of Health offer Ma and Pa Mason welfare for life, on the condition that they and their children submit to being sterilized. The couple agrees -- causing all sorts of consternation and complications. Sterling Holloway, Crane Wilbur (who also directs) and Diane Sinclair star.
