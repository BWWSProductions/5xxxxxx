Do you know if this will happen often, and if there is any way to prevent it? Thanks once again for your time"
,gigifericitu,2010-08-08T16:27Z,Great torrent. Fast downloading and the game works perfectly. Except for the fact that it crashes when I get to speak to Damien at WatiCorp. Does anyone else experience this bug? Does this happen only in this version or is it a common bug in this game?
