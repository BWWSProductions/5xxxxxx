By MEzawa review:

This DVD is a solid collection of dolphin encounters, stories of people who have formed relationships with dolphins, dolphins in the wild, and dolphin intelligence observations (which are truly impressive). 

There is no cruelty in this DVD, which does make it more relaxing to watch. On the back of the DVD case there is a warning about violence, but that applies to the entire "Explore the Wildlife Kingdom" series, not this DVD directly. There is no cruelty to dolphins in this film. Tihs is a family-friendly movie. 

From a lone dolphin in Ireland to the river dolphins of the Amazon, this DVD covers man-dolphin relationships all across the globe. The background scenery is stunning as well, but nothing compares to the animals themselves. 

This is well worth the money. It's also a good film to watch to calm down or just to relax.
