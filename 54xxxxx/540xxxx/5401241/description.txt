Although little known in English speaking countries, LÃ©o FerrÃ© (1916-1993) is a monument of French chanson, revered throughout the francophone world. A singer, songwriter, author, composer, and even orchestra conductor, he is mostly remembered for songs like "Avec le Temps," "Les Anarchistes," and "Jolie MÃ´me." His career began in the cabaret and took him through four decades and a number of styles, but his best material and his popularity peak happened in the â€˜60s and early â€˜70s, as the generation of May â€˜68 adopted him as an anarchist figure.

LÃ©o FerrÃ© was born and raised in the principality of Monaco, between France and Italy. Throughout his life, the artist would live and work in the two countries alternately, even recording a few songs in Italian.
