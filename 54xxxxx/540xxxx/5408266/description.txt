Olav Brekke Mathisen is the new guy on the Idjut Boys Discfunction label. 
    Olav has been involved in the Norwegian house scene for a couple of
    years. His refers to Moodyman and Pepe Bradock as his biggest influences,
    which once you have listened his new 12" I am sure you will agree that
    his style lies somewhere between the two masters. While in his studio
    Olav claims to have been inspired by the theme tune to 80's cops and
    robbers show Miami Vice, not only did he grow a blow dry mullet and roll
    up his suit jacket sleeves he made 'Crockett & Me' a tripped out journey
    into disco which will have asses shaking the world over. On the flip
    side the tempo gets booted up a little but things still groove along
    nicely, a smoking Discfunction debut from Olav, just watch this man go!
