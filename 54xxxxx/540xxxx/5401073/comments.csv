,simplis,2010-03-01T12:19Z,"mkv is not good format. Why it's problem to put it on standard avi format?
V/10
A/3
It's better to wait avi format."
,Flokker,2010-03-01T13:07Z,thanks as usual!
,gskrillz,2010-03-01T17:53Z,"@simplis - WOW. you do realize that it says 720p right? .mkv is HIGH DEFINITION format, hence the reason it is a bigger file. what a horrible question you asked. MAYBE some people like watching the show in HD instead of standard .avi. we want MORE quality. get with it."
,DrAnal,2010-03-02T10:45Z,"@ simplis

and just to say what Im sure everyone is, or should be thinking, how dare you even make a statement like that?  A request, that's one thing, and about format, well, if yours was a request, it should have come with more tact and couth, but dude? 

Everyone here read that for what it was, a lame ass and un-called for whining gripe about an up-loader's choice of format.  Bad, way bad, form.  Its easy to sit behind your screen and leech ain't it?  Even easier to complain about what you apperceive

@TV Team - thanks for the hard work"

As I was saying.....Even easier to complain about what you apparently perceive as your right to this content.  Guess what homey? You are NOT entitled to anything you don't work for, and certainly beggars can't be choosers.  This kind of behavior, to me, is worse than a punk kid cursing or posting against the rules because YOUR behavior indicates the kind of person you really are and that, were I an admin, would get you booted faster than the cat got kicked out of my room."
