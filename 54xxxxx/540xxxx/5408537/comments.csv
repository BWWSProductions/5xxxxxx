This is a really entertaining animation; meant for adults I'm sure.

Some of the puns with character names are hilarious, the voices are brilliant in fitting the players.

Even though the pace is a little slow, if you treat it like an old time western/gangster flick the intensity builds in the gaps filled with the ""music"".

This one is from out of left field & I really liked it.

Thanks :-)"
