,libertaswv,2010-03-01T01:05Z,You guys are the best - thanks a ton for this recent flood of quality releases....It's been really great checking the FXG bookmark lately :)
,grg426,2010-03-01T02:54Z,"Thanx a lot guys! Keep up the good work, you're great!"
,pogogogo,2010-03-01T06:45Z,"i was so fucked up dl extremezone's n other people's uploads.

all their uploads r around 1.36 GB, with average quality ( FXG's quality is better at just 700 Mb).

i hope FXG would continue uploading and not disappear for couple of months.

As of nowdays, the whole p2p community would agree that FXG holds the top spot for quality rips."
,imrealgod,2010-03-01T23:45Z,"Thanks a bunch FXG, you really rock........ Now awaiting DVDRIP of ""The Stoning of Soraya M."""
,Daniel_Tiger,2010-03-02T03:01Z,"This movie is AWESOME!!!

Made me laugh throughout the ENTIRE flick!!  The 10 pc chicken part.  The collard greens n hairy pigs feet part.  The part where she eats her moms pussy.  The parts where people can tell Precious is pregnant.  ITS FUCKIN CLASSIC COMEDY at its BEST!!!!!

10 stars for the LoLz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,kowkow,2010-03-13T20:30Z,There is no upside-down in space
,Skogswald,2010-03-16T01:27Z,"In concern of the sync issue, yes, it is really there. However, it doesn't seem to be progressively out of sync. Meaning, it's quite easy to fix (for those familiar with VirtualDub, anyhow). I reckon that putting a delay on ~200ms on the audio track makes it more enjoyable. The actual value is prolly even +/- some 10's of milliseconds more or less, you ""perfectionalists"" out there could prolly narrow it dows to a perfect match. However, like I said, 200ms audio delay, and this one's aaaight! =)"
,anyeuha_80,2010-03-21T06:08Z,Thnksssssssssssssssssssssss

,Sklyn,2010-04-04T01:55Z,"Thank you FXG, the movie is great!

And thanks to Skogswald, you're right. I did what you said (200ms audio delay) and -at least for me- now is perfect. I can't complain. Thank you so much. :)"
