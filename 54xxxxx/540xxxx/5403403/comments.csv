,g8aso,2010-03-02T07:39Z,"Why use a RAR file?
Torrents are automatically boken up into pieces by the encoding program, there seems to be virtually no reduction in file size, and using zip and rar files are the tools of those trying to get trojans, worms, and viruses onto computers.
Also, hiding the torrent in a rar file means you can't check it for content until the entire thing is downloaded.
I can't see any advantages, just disadvantages.

However, I DO appreciate the effort............"
