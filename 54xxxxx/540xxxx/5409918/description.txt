History

Volume 1 was originally released (credited to Camp Kill Yourself) on February 27, 1999 by Teil Martin International and was limited to 2,500 copies.[1]  A second release on December 12, 1999 was limited to 1,000 copies, before the album was reissued by Volcom Entertainment when the band signed with them in 2000â€”first on April 1, under the title CKY and limited to 2,000 copies; then on May 1, under the title Camp and limited to 4,000 copies; and finally on October 1, under the title Camp Volume 1  and limited to a much larger 20,000.[1]  When CKY signed to Island Def Jam Music Group in 2001, they too reissued the album. Island/Def Jam's edition was an enhanced CD released with different coloured album coversâ€”purple, blue, orange (all of which were limited to 5,000 copies each) and red (of which copies were unlimited). CKY's British distributor, Mercury Records, also issued Volume 1 in 2002, and a downloadable version of the record was made available in 2008.


Album cover

The original album cover depicted Budd Dwyer as he famously shot himself on live television. When it was prepared for release by Volcom, the label's manager demanded the cover be changed, and that the band change their name to something less offensive (hence the switch from Camp Kill Yourself to CKY).[2] The next, more well-known, cover features a photograph of lead guitarist Chad I. Ginsburg performing his trademark 'bitch toss', in which he throws his guitar 360 degrees around his back and catches it when it returns. The photo was taken on the 1999 Warped Tour.

Trivia

    * "96 Quite Bitter Beings", arguably one of the band's most popular tracks, was written one afternoon when Deron decided not to go to work.[1]
    * "Rio Bravo" was originally called "Rio Bravo Truckstop", but a design error on the first pressing had it labelled as "Rio Bravo" and the band decided to keep the condensed title.[1] The longer title is that given to the first hidden track on the albumâ€” a reprise of the song.
    * During "My Promiscuous Daughter" there is a section which includes background speech which features Jess and Deron making fun of their old manager and talking about how Ryan Bruni doesn't even know they are making an album.[1]
    * "Shippensburg", a song from Volume 2, was originally supposed to play after "Sara's Mask" but it was removed as it "didn't fit well with the album".[1]
    * The alternative album artwork is an artist's impression of politician Budd Dwyer's filmed suicide.
