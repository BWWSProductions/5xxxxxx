PLOT SUMMARY FOR "SONS OF ANARCHY"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sons of Anarchy, aka SAMCRO, is a motorcycle gang that operates both illegal and legal businesses in the small town of Charming. They combine gun-running and a garage, plus involvement in porn film. Clay, the president, likes it old school and violent; while Jax, his stepson and the club's VP, has thoughts about changing the way things are, based on his dead father's journal. Their conflict has effects on both the club and their personal relationships

SEASON TWO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Production of the new season began on April 23, 2009; Season two premiered on Tuesday, September 8 at 10 p.m. WST. According to Kurt Sutter, "This season is all about internal alliances. For me, the big antagonist this season is just a catalyst to ignite the deep, primal conflicts within the club. Lives will be threatened, sides will be taken and SAMCRO will become the biggest threat to the SAMCRO."

The season opens with a new threat in the form of white separatists (in the premiere episode they say they are not supremacists) called the League Of American Nationalists (L.O.A.N. for short) descending upon the town of Charming. Led by businessman Ethan Zobelle and backed by Zobelle's enforcer, A.J. Weston, the two seek to drive the Sons of Anarchy from the town of Charming, on behalf of a group of wealthy would-be developers (one of them being Deputy Chief Hale's brother) looking to expand the town beyond the sort of "Small Town USA" status kept by SAMCRO, to an investment opportunity of strip malls and condos. The duo make their intentions known when they walk into the garage and tell Clay that he is done "selling guns to color." Zobelle then arranges for the kidnapping and gang-rape of Gemma Teller by Weston and two other men, as a warning to the group. We see later that it was Zobelle's own daughter who sets Gemma up when she pulls behind Gemma's car in her mini-van and pretends to be a mother in distress. However, Gemmaâ€™s rape does not have the effect that Zobelle and Weston were hoping for, as Gemma does not reveal to Clay what happened. Instead, the only ones who know the truth are Chief Unser (who found Gemma after she was raped), Tara (who treated her injuries), and later, Deputy Chief Hale. Because of this, L.O.A.N. resorts to other methods to rid Charming of SAMCRO. Very few of L.O.A.N.â€™s attempts involve a direct assault on the club. Instead, Zobelle and crew seem to look for ways to provoke SAMCRO into destroying themselves.

The animosity between Gemma and Tara has cooled and even turned into a bit of respect for each other. This is largely due to Taraâ€™s help with Abel and with Gemma after her rape. Elsewhere, Tara and Jax move towards rekindling their relationship even as Gemma tacitly gives Tara her blessing by telling the doctor to demand complete honesty from Jax in order to ensure that their relationship can survive Jax's dual loyalty towards Tara and the club. Unfortunately, while Jax and Tara grow closer, Gemma and Clayâ€™s relationship struggles and Gemma struggles with the after affects of her rape which is complicated by the fact that Clay knows nothing about it.

From prison, Otto Delaney reaches out to SAMCRO, asking them to help his wife, Luann, and her porn studio after a raid from law enforcement and intimidation from a rival pornographer, Georgie Caruso, threaten her business. Jax proposes that SAMCRO become partners in Luannâ€™s studio and offer protection to her and her performers, a move he hopes will raise money for the club legitimately while they re-build their other revenue streams.

Opie, struggling to deal with Donnaâ€™s death, throws himself fully into the MC and, consequently, becomes increasingly distant from his children. Opieâ€™s relationship with Jax also becomes strained as Opie, who is unaware of Clayâ€™s role in Donnaâ€™s death, becomes increasingly loyal to Clay and distant from Jax. Later on, Opie becomes involved with Lyla, one of Luannâ€™s performers, who is, herself, a single mother. This development is not met well by some involved with SAMCRO, particularly Tara, who do not think that Opieâ€™s children need to be around a porn star.

Fueled by SAMCROâ€™s role in Donnaâ€™s death, the rift between Clay and Jax continues to grow, with Jax challenging most of the decisions that Clay makes. This has repercussions throughout the whole club. Tig, Happy, and Opie remain steadfastly loyal to Clay, while Piney, Chibs, and Bobby begin to side more and more with Jax. Clay warns Jax that if Jax does not drop the subject of Donnaâ€™s death, Clay will kill him. When a L.O.A.N. car bomb nearly kills Chibs, Clay demands the SAMCRO retaliate immediately. This was L.O.A.N.â€™s intention, and several members of the MC, including Clay, Jax, Bobby, and Tig, are arrested in a botched attempt to attack Ethan Zobelle. While in jail, Agent Stahl from the ATF returns in an attempt to get SAMCRO to rat out their IRA connections. Although they don't give up the IRA, Stahl succeeds in provoking Clay and Jax into a physical confrontation in jail. Out on bail, the divisions in the club only get worse, with the members at each other's throats over everything and everybody doubting one another's loyalty. Further complicating matters is SAMCROâ€™s suspicion (later confirmed) that their IRA contacts are starting to sell guns to L.O.A.N. instead of the MC and increasing pressure from the Mayans, who are receiving free guns from L.O.A.N. in order to wage war on the Sons of Anarchy. When Luann is later murdered, presumably by rival porn producer Georgie Caruso, Clay holds Jax personally responsible. The tension between Jax and Clay reached a breaking point when the porn studio burned down shortly after Clay announced that he wanted SAMCRO out of the porn business. Jax initially believed that Clay had the place torched (it was actually L.O.A.N.) and announced that he was going to "go nomad," which meant that while he'd still be a member of the Sons of Anarchy, he would no longer be a part of any particular chapter of the club. Most of the SAMCRO members were upset with Jax's decision but ultimately voted in favor of him going nomad. After the vote, Gemma had Jax and Clay sit down in her home and revealed that Zobelle's people had raped her. As Jax leaves her house, he takes back his SAMCRO tag, symbolizing his intent to stay in Charming rather than go nomad.

Gemma's revelation brings Jax and Clay back together. The two inform the other member of SAMCRO what happened to Gemma and the MC begins to plan their revenge. The club, however, nearly falls apart again when Tig, overcome with guilt, confesses to Opie that he murdered Donna because Agent Stahl and the ATF had made it look as though Opie had become a rat. At the same time, Chibs agreed to help Stahl take down the IRA and its head, Jimmy O, who is in town to repair the IRA's relationship with SAMCRO and who Chibs had a long and dark history with. Based on information supplied by Chibs, the ATF was able to apprehend Edmond Hayes, who they then wanted to use to apprehend his father, Cameron, and Jimmy O. Opie later witnessed Chibs leaving a meeting with the ATF and informed the club of what he saw but asked them to confront Chibs before acting. Chibs, already having doubts about becoming an informant, revealed to the club what he did after having a heart-to-heart talk with Gemma.

Meanwhile, it the Sons learn that Ethan Zobelle's true intentions were not racially motivated but were to get in business with the Mayans on the prison heroin trade. The MC was able to exploit this information when they reveal it to AJ Weston, who was deeply committed to his racial beliefs and would not tolerate doing business with the Hispanic Mayans. This caused a split between AJ and Zobelle. Unfortunately for the club, they were not initially able to capitalize on this split as their first attempts to take down Weston and Zobelle were thwarted by Deputy Chief Hale. First, AJ Weston was arrested in connection with the fire at Luann's porn studio. Later, Hale arrives at Impeccable Smokes as the Sons are confronting Zobelle. In attempt to save his and his daughter's lives, Zobelle informed the police that he was in possession of narcotics and is arrested. However, both were released by custody and Unser learns that Zobelle, unbeknownst to both the ATF and Weston, has actually been an F.B.I. informant for the past three years. With the loss of Weston's support, Zobelle turned to the Mayans for protection. Weston, however, was on his own and was eventually gunned down by Jax.

Agent Stahl continued to hold Edmond Hayes in an attempt to use Edmond to lure and arrest his father. Cameron, knowing the situation his son was in, told Edmond that he needed to kill Stahl. Edmond had a gun stashed at the safe house he was staying at and tried to shoot Stahl but was unable to pull the trigger on her. However, the ATF was already aware of the gun's presence and Stahl informed Edmond that they had loaded it with blanks. Edmond then attempted to escape ATF custody but was gunned down by Stahl. Shortly afterward, Polly Zobelle, Ethan's daughter who had been having an affair with Edmond, arrived at the safe house. She had been followed there by Gemma. At the safe house, Gemma shot and killed Polly. Stahl witnessed the shooting and let Gemma escape but then proceeded to frame her for Edmond's shooting. After learning of Edmond's death from a police scanner that said Gemma killed Edmond, Cameron broke into Jax's home, tied up Tara, stabbed Half-Sack, who was assigned to protect Tara, and kidnapped Abel.

Meanwhile the rest of the Sons had ambushed Zobelle and the Mayans forcing the Mayans to retreat while Zobelle fled on his own. The Sons followed him to a Deli some distance along the highway, possibly the next town over. Zobelle attempts to hide himself amongst children who had just arrived off of a school bus. The Sons chose to wait until the children had left before making their move on Zobelle, who has called Deputy Hale only to be told his daughter was found murdered and that he would be sending officers to assist him. After getting off the phone with Zobelle, Hale instructed his department to ignore what he had said to Zobelle.

Earlier, Tara called Jax to tell him Gemma was on the run only to be interrupted by Cameron. Concerned, Jax returned to his home where he discovers the body of Half-Sack (actor Johnny Lewis wished to move on.) Distraught, Jax notices Tara is no where to be found and frantically searches the house for her only to find her tied up and gagged next to Abel's crib. After ungagging her Tara tells Jax that Abel was taken by Cameron. Jax calls Clay who returns to help track down Cameron without killing Zobelle. The Sons pursue Cameron who makes his way to the docks where he takes Abel and boards his boat. Chief Unser, after receiving a phone call from Gemma, is last seen driving in his police cruiser with her past Charming's city limits, apparently running off with her. Ethan Zobelle is seen quickly getting on a chartered plane back to Budapest without his dead daughter, Polly. The season ends with The Sons arriving just as Cameron is leaving the docks with Clay comforting a sobbing Jax.
