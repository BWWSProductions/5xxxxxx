This is a history channel program called turning points in history, this one talks about Newfoundlands sacrifice in WWI mainly at the battle of the Somme in France.
  I find it disgraceful that these generals that made these attack plans were even allowed to command armies, they were obviously quite incompetent when it came to battle tactics and they continued to use the charge mentality of the 19th century.

  Perhaps my opinion is based on the fact i am an armchair quarterback and i may have made the same decisions they made at that place and time.
