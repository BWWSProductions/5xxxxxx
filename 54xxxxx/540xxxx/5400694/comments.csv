,ivanhoe22,2010-03-01T15:07Z,"how lame!
let's hope there's no spectacular scenes in those minutes!"
,skooterzz,2010-03-01T19:03Z,"dang!
it's the same as the one I got from a private torrent site - something like the last minute is missing.
Any chance of a proper? =)"
,aphra,2010-03-02T01:28Z,First time I've got it uploaded the same day it was aired; first time I've screwed up! That'll teach me. PROPER coming tomorrow if you can wait.
