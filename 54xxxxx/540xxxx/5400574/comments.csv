,mik11212,2010-03-03T17:36Z,Does it work??? anyone?? 
,ScorpioPirate,2010-03-05T11:27Z,"Ok.. I try one more!!!!
Have you CoPilot Live 8 to Windows Mobile??"
,JoKeZ,2010-03-07T20:47Z,"Funka fint att installera på Nexus one!
Men verkar inte va crackad? Den frågar efter både google chechout och Copilot ID....hur kommer man runt detta??

Sen skulle jag även vilja veta vart man skall lägga kartorna?"
,JoKeZ,2010-03-07T20:50Z,"Maybe i should write in english also....

Easy to install on Nexus one! But the crack dont seem to work :( It keeps asking for Google checkout code and CopilotID. How do I avoid this?

And i also wanna know where to put the map-files?"
,xarvox,2010-03-13T01:12Z,"map data (.cfg files) goes into: /sdcard/copilot/maps

enjoy and drive safe :)"
,xarvox,2010-03-13T01:15Z,"correction, there are more map data file types than just .cfg.."
,ricovettie,2010-03-13T20:44Z,"programs keep saying "" no maps installed""

i have put the folder ""europe"" from this torrent  on my sd card in folder --copilot --->maps --> europe (is the folder from this torrent)

where did  i go wrong ??

thnx"
,Benja7,2010-04-08T11:40Z,"I got it to work on a Sony Ericsson X10.

Only thing is that every time I start copilot I have to click ""skip"" when it asks for googlecheckout code.

When I just skip that the program works fine. 

I could not get the maps to work so I just downloaded the maps I needed from within Copilot. And it worked fine.
Copilot came up a says that no maps are installed do you want do download ? Yes please :-)"
,kallekula33,2010-04-12T21:30Z,"Bejna7 , did you manage to get the application use the whole screen ? I tried an previous version and it didn't work. If you made some modifications to config files or anything else please let me know what you've done. Cheers !"
,clank182,2010-04-13T00:51Z,works great on my hero
,urtiltsman,2010-04-16T21:30Z,"I have installed the app on my HTC Desire. Its possible to download the maps for the Nordic countries.

The map files for the European countries that are included in this dl does not work. If you try to use them you are forced to enter a licence code.

Am i doing this wrong? How is it supposed to be installed so all maps work, anybody post a tutorial?!?

Cheers"
,urtiltsman,2010-04-17T00:29Z,"Correction,

When the sign that you dont have the rights for the maps, just press the X and it will work, dont enter the registration page. Place the folder Europe --> EU --> copilot to make it work."
,asniam,2010-04-17T17:31Z,How do I install? Dont find any .apk file.
,nil7,2010-04-18T19:59Z,"This CoPilot may or may not have worked, but it asks for email to get a code. 

So I googled and found ""Navigon 2.5.1 2010 for android"" (not on TPB). That one works fine on my desire.

http://www.google.com/search?q=navigon+filetype:torrent"
,tolare,2010-04-22T20:36Z,"That Navigon is working fine on my X10i also, didn't get CoPilot to work."
,Pboa,2010-04-30T00:52Z,Write any mail and password and the activation will suceed. It is only to get future updates you have to sign up :-)
,grandenano,2010-05-06T03:06Z,"hi everybody!
i just got the benelux maps to work... how i can do to activate the rest?"
,grandenano,2010-05-06T11:24Z,"Hey urtiltsman i have the htc desire as well but can't manage to get the maps working... if i put them like you said in copilot-EU-Europe, it still says no maps installed... can you please tell me how you did it? thx"
,sweatyrich,2010-05-06T23:00Z,"@grandenano
I also have the HTC Desire.

Forget about the maps from this torrent and ONLY download the apk.
Install it and when you run it, you can download whatever maps(s) you want via WiFi.
I've just downloaded the UK & Ireland map (80+MB) and it's working BRILLIANT!!

Many thanks locazor!!"
,psxvince,2010-05-08T19:45Z,"Doesnt work, you can install the program but after that it asks for code

DONT DOWNLOAD, a waist of time!"
,sweatyrich,2010-05-09T11:15Z,"@psxvince
It DOES work - It prompts for the Google checkout every time on startup, but simply press .

This app is AWESOME."
,sweatyrich,2010-05-09T11:28Z,"Missed the SKIP button in the above text - opps.

Press the SKIP button to get thru the Google Checkout question."
,itsvashi,2010-05-10T20:10Z,"Works perfectly fine on HTC Desire

Here what you have to do:
- DL the .apk file
- install with file manager (as ASTRO - free in market)
- google checkout - skip
- registration: random mail / password
- download map of your choice over Wifi
- restard copilot

--> drive ;)

crashes from time to time... if the software is okay I may will buy the legal version.."
,psxvince,2010-05-11T07:04Z,"Got Navigon 2.5.1 2010 for android, no chrashes,looks good,runs smooth."

,sysman,2010-05-25T12:04Z,"It is an Demoversion, only works for 10 days, dont waist time on it !!!!!!"
,Nagyfonok,2010-05-28T17:55Z,"the app good for desire, but the maps... So: installed, and downloaded tha UK maps. then figured out where shud i put the map-data. partially worked: saw all POI, borders, river but NO ROAD??!! tried couple of setting but could not make it visible. now navigon is on as recommended, but looks amateur compare to the APP. any idea how cud the original app work?"
,0794ice,2010-06-15T00:26Z,i have downloaded these copilots apps and they only last for 10 days to a week. They are great while they work but how do you stop them from being blocked. 
,Rikplay,2010-07-28T00:25Z,"Nexus one user using froyo (2.2)
Copied to SD card,
installed using astro, all went swell.
Started copilot - it copied a few files over to the sd card then gave me this
""invalid Library- Copilots code cannot be loaded by the system""
Here my only option is to press ""OK"" which closes the app. Other people talk of a skip button, Not on the nexus one. The only physical button that does something is the search button which makes the message go away and the app background stay, but nothing else happens after that, i waited. Does anyone have better intructions"
,gamerspowers123,2010-08-01T22:27Z,does this support move to sd from the 2.2 update? does it work on HTC Desire 2.2?
,dirtyswed,2010-08-10T18:57Z,"Cant get the maps to install?
I have a HTC Legend.

In the beginning when you can choose your map i choose my country, and it says that it downloading in the background but nothing happens, anybody know what i can do?"
,baaambey,2010-08-21T02:33Z,Amazing! I was looking for this app!! Now I can turn my good old G1 into a navigation system!!! :)) Thanks friends!
