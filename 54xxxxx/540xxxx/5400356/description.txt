                          ..: DESCRiPTiON :..                           
                                                                          
                                                                          
    Security and privacy are two of the most important issues in          
    today's world; leaving passwords on sticky notes around your          
    computer simply will not cut it anymore. Data Guardian is a secure    
    database application with up to 448-bits of Blowfish encryption -     
    regardless of how sensitive your data is. Create multiple             
    databases in Data Guardian for a variety of purposes such as an       
    address book, customer database, Christmas shopping list, journal,    
    password manager, or even notepad.                                    
                                                                          
    Easily create collections to store records, and even apply custom     
    color labels and icons! Change the view options for each              
    collection to see the information you want, and add your own          
    custom data fields. Do not be stuck with a program which forces       
    you to input your information into predefined fields. Enter the       
    data you need to, not what you are forced to.                         
                                                                          
    Aside from Data Guardian's easy to use Keychain integration* to       
    autofill passwords on web sites, it also offers a variety of other    
    tools and features to enhance each record. Dial phone numbers         
    through your modem with a single click, create new e-mail             
    messages, generate secure passwords (based on an algorithm of your    
    choosing), and even synchronize two databases.                        
                                                                          
    Data Guardian is the ultimate database solution, and not only if      
    security is a priority. Allow it to become your computerized Swiss    
    Army Knife in an age of digital chaos.                                
                                                                          
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                          
                                                                   
                                                      
                                                          
                                                
                                                           
                                                       
                                                            
                ..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..              
                                                                     
                                                                         
                                                                         
    1. Make sure you're offline or use a firewall to block the           
      application from connecting to the internet. This is the only      
       way to gain access to offline activation.                         
                                                                         
    2. Select "Activate Product" from the main menu or when you're       
       given the option upon running the program for the first time.     
                                                                         
    3. Select "Activate this product now" and enter anything into the    
       buyer's email edit box.  This email is never used in display      
       or for registering, so it can be anything. Press                  
      Continue/Activate button.                                          
                                                                         
    4. Next it will give you a dialog to activate offline, press "Yes"   
       button.  Now, for the buyer email enter in what you want to       
       display as registered user.  Press "Next Step" button.            
                                                                         
    5. Copy the "Challenge Code" into our keygen to generate a valid     
       "Answer".  Press "Next Step" button.  Enter in "Challenge         
      Answer", press "Activate" and you're done.                         
                                                                         
    6. After this, the application can connect to internet and will      
       stay registered as far as we can tell (maybe the protection       
       will change in the future, who knows...).

      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      
      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
