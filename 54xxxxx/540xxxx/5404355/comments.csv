,Purpin,2010-03-21T02:44Z,"I've got the same problem, I downloaded it, opened the dmg, and tried to drag the game onto the crack, nothing happened. I draged the crack onto the game, nothing happened. I tried using MacHacha to merge the files, nothing worked :/
Couldja put some more DETAILED instructions, or maybe get a better working crack. If I open the crack, it says there has been and unrecoverable error has occured."
,Purpin,2010-03-21T02:56Z,"Ooohhhhhhhh I gets it nao c:
You drag it into the folder and replace the old app :o
I thought that would delete a 25gb thingy which would take about 2 hours and it would take about 3 days getting it back agaainnn but the apps only 22mb... and the crack is also that... lulz :3"
