,drdavil,2010-03-03T06:45Z,Why such a poor bit rate
,CharlieAllnut51,2010-03-07T12:11Z,"Poor bit rate? 64/kbps is a poor bitrate. Although, on a portable MP3 player you might not even notice if you didn't know. For years 128/kbps was the standard and 320 just happened to be the lowest compression setting that nobody really used. I like 192 and it's probably a little bit overkill. 192/kbps offers near perfect sound and still compresses enough so that the file isn't unnecessarily large.

The moral of the story? Don't be so fixated on the numbers. If I had you listen to assorted tunes, half of which were uncompressed WAVs and half were 192/kbps MP3s and had you guess which was which, I can guarantee two things... you would indeed have to guess and you would be correct precisely fifty percent of the time."
,CharlieAllnut51,2010-03-07T12:23Z,"I should mention that there is a flac version of this torrent floating around. The files are not named or tagged, the whole thing is more than twice as large as this one AND you probably won't be able to tell the difference... but it's out there... knock yourself out. "
