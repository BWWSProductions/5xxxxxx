,KTMmarkus,2010-03-01T14:32Z,"Slick got some problems with the captureing and editing of his version, hopefully it will be available later.

His own words:

Sorry I was not home last night. When I got home I set up the computer to record it off the dvr and went to bed. I woke up 3 hours later to set up editing. When I attempted to open the video file in my usual editor it would not open. It said the file was corrupted. So I set everything up to record again but this time in a different format to hopefully fix the problem. 3 hours later when I tried the new file it would not work either. So this gave me the problem of either record it for a 3rd time and probably fail or try to edit one of the videos I have with a different editor. I had to research and find a different editor. These live races are tough on my computer I guess. It sucks to troubleshoot the process because recording takes 3 hours and the compression process takes about 5 hours. So right now I have the video being running in the new editor. It will be complete in 4.5 hours and I hope it is correct. I tried the editor on a 1 min video but it might act differently on a 2 hour and 15 min video. If there is a problem I will give an on here. 

The new editor I used had a major audio/video sync issue. Plus it lied to me about the quality. It looks good but is over 6GB in size. I will try to have the race up when I can but no guarantees when that might be. I am going to try to record it in 1 hour pieces and see if it saves them properly. I love the 3 hour live races but they are hard to record, edit and compress. "
