,Luhgnut,2010-03-02T14:48Z,"I just scanned it with malware bytes, TrendMicro, Avast.  No problems.
Getting tired of these nubs where everything is a virus.  The way the password crackers work, you always get a false positive."

I don't know if that means it is a trojan or not, I'm just posting results.  On a further note, it worked, and after scanning my computer for viruses, RootKits, et al, she turned up clean."
,drastic77,2010-03-26T22:54Z,It worked great for me i was trippin to ha ha thanks for those with the splash screen mine went away when i restarted
,eazest,2010-04-13T01:52Z,"Great thanks, it works fine and tested by me on about 20 machines with both x86 and x64 Windows 7 systems. 
But can anyone ask if it will work on RC1? That computer restarts each 1,5 hour.
Thanks in advance!"
,ekdikeo,2010-05-13T22:04Z,works great :D
,kiss4me,2010-05-20T00:17Z,"Kaspersky found a virus in 7loader file. Trojan.
unnormal behavior..since never happened to other loaders.. :-s"
,erikme,2010-05-24T13:38Z,"F-Secure found also a troijan.

But it sounds reasonable what Luhgnut is saying. The cracker makes changes to the system so the anti-virus program should give a warning.

What I don't get is why some anti-virus programs do give a warning and some don't ???"
,Dexter101,2010-06-14T14:38Z,"wow... didnt work...
i have done all the instruction but i failed :(

in the command line for CMD as admin
the command from instruction "".....4e35~x86~~7.1.7600.16395""
but in the CMD says image...sth.... : ""7.1.7600.16386"" 

does it matter????? thanks"
,Bulldawg2525,2010-09-05T07:47Z,"caution,
malicious software that hides in Windows processes and opens a back door. after being installed the program creates network connections to several ip addresses at port 80, and several websites."
