And this is definitely not a God of War Rip Off!!! I kinda feel this is a God of War Rip off at first co'z theres so many critics that this is a God of War Rip Off, But now i'm telling you this is'nt."

,TheWayHeWantsIt,2011-03-19T11:40Z,"Hi guys, i just updated my psp from cfw 5.00 m33-4 to m33-6. i got the same message as u guys, ""the game could not be started"". I found a solution, http://blog.ocmodshop.com/2010/03/how-to-get-dantes-inferno-working-on-custom-psp-firmware/ . Hopefully this will help u too.. Enjoy! :)"
,TheWayHeWantsIt,2011-03-19T11:48Z,"p.s. I downloadet the torrent with most seeds, but i think it should work on this one too. If u have similar problem with other games, getting the message ""the game could not be started"", try this out. I had similar problems with Dantes Inferno (as u know), the newest silent hill game and Angry birds.. Using the link above will hopefully help u :) ...and again, ENJOY! :)   "
