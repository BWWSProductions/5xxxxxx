The reviewers tell us what to buy, but the public actually part with the cash. 
Surely 26 million people cannot be wrong, as original Mac guitarist Peter Green's 
creation became the prime example of AOR long after his departure. The inner 
strife and turmoil of the band is credited as having helped to make this many-headed 
beast into such a success. Keyboardist Christine McVie sparred with husband/bassist 
John, and singer Stevie Nicks scrapped with boyfriend/guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. 
Drummer Mick Fleetwood held the emotional mess together with confident steadiness as 
demonstrated in his confident, inventive playing throughout the record. Nicks' fiery 
vocals on "Go Your Own Way" complemented McVie's beautifully understated style on tunes 
like "You Make Loving Fun," exemplifying their successful fire-ice dichotomy.
