When he was a boy, Clark Kent was isolated and alone until he met this teen team from the 31st century.  Today, it's been years since Superman saw his childhood friends. Why haven't they returned to visit him?  What's become of the symbol of Superman in the future?  And just why is the future so dangerous for Superman?  They warned him away, but now he's determined to help his friends - even if it means his life!
