,denvargo,2010-03-13T18:06Z,"program can not start because d3dxp_41.dll not exist.

I run the patch with FM.exe file and try to open FM.exe file after that. Then I get the error message. What I have to do?"
,santasa99,2010-03-13T20:19Z,"Download dll from --> http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?d3dx9_41

Save it where you want, then unrar and you will find instructions file with dll that you need. 

It is best that you cut and paste your dll directly to FM folder where your fm.exe is."
