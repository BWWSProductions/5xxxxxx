In the last 48 hours we have learned some fun facts about Senator Jim â€œCurveballâ€ Bunning (R/Ky): he can define the word â€œFilibuster,â€ rivals the Palin clan in the progeny department â€“ boasting 40 grandchildren, didnâ€™t lose the use of his middle finger during his years as a professional baseball player, cusses like Cheney, and is concerned about deficit spending . . . . all of a sudden . . . .  and only if a Democrat is proposing it.

Bunning had no problem funding Bushâ€™s illegal terror wars or passing tax cuts for the wealthy or any other middle-class-hostile programs during the eight year Bush Crime Family reign of absolute terror and fiscal ruin.  But if 400,ooo regular olâ€™ Americans are going to lose their benefits because heâ€™s holding their allotted monies in his tight little fist?  Tough Sh*t, as he said.  He only votes for spending bills initiated by Republicans.
