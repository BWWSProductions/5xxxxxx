he already did 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5230440/The.Hurt.Locker.2008.BluRay.H264"
,womenball,2010-03-03T12:15Z,"will you upload ""Did You Hear About The Morgans"""
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-03T12:33Z,"Hurt Locker was done even before that, but resurrected for the second time. When this, one of the best movies ever (IMO) has been upped for the first time (on blown star) only few people got it, even if I have ""screamed"" how good it is. Now, almost a year later, everybody talk about this for Oscar nominated film and after movie has won Golden Globes and like dozens of awards on all movie Festivals. Definitely, absolutely, totally - ""must see"". Neglected, never talked about (much like ""The lucky ones"") this movie needed almost two years (since screenings) to be recognized at all. Grab one, whoever read this...
Thanks, womenball... for the link, and input... but I would not encode ""Morgans""... I cannot stand main female part almost organically..."

[V],twentyforty,2010-03-03T13:25Z,"@stev: ROFL, ""can't stand"" can be broadly interpreted in these ways:

-you cannot endure something
-you cannot tolerate something

Another idiom that is similar in meaning is '(can't) put up with'. In this case I can't endure and ...LOL... ""organically"" is like ""every fiber of my being"" - which is - true.

Glad I made you laugh."
,lilars26,2010-03-03T18:05Z,"Hey 20-40

Could you upload some
'Sex in the City'"
,lilars26,2010-03-03T18:11Z,"...'Sex and the City'.
Sorry,what do I know?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-03T18:56Z,"Immediately, lilars. Just wait a little, I'm going to clean the stables... in fact, I did that this morning and I'm still so stunned by the resemblance that I must check it again."
,lilars26,2010-03-03T20:52Z,"You can never get rid of all
the crap.It just keeps on getting
deeper.I never realized how much
until I started file sharing.
Peace,bro."
