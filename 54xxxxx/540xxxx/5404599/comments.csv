,rippervanwinkle,2010-03-22T19:27Z,"Not a good rip. There are small discontinuities, breaks where small parts of a scene are missing, some of these are very abrupt and impossible to ignore. The film should be slightly longer than 160 minutes but this rip is 155 minutes. Also the aspect ratio is wrong. The original is 2.55 but this rip is 2.5, a small difference but noticeable.

It's also extremely hard to see the value in a 333MB 2 channel AAC audio track in place of AC-3. A two channel AC-3 track would not be much bigger. It would be easy to make a rip which looks at least as good but without breaks/omissions, with correct AR and which included the AC-3 soundtrack.

A classic film but a disappointing release."

,rippervanwinkle,2010-04-12T16:01Z,"You (or whoever made the capture) got the aspect ratio wrong, and lost small parts of the movie.  Pointing that out isn't trolling or idiocy.   "
[T],kriss_kringle,2010-04-14T03:35Z,"Listen bub,I just ripped the source.As you can see the source is a HDTV.If you wanna blame someone blame the tv program who aired the film like that. I couldn't have known there were parts missing.Pointing that out is actually bitching.If you don't like it don't download it."
