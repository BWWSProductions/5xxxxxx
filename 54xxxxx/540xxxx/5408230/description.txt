The Michael Schenker Group (or shortly MSG) is a
guitar-oriented hard rock band formed in 1979 by the former
Scorpions and UFO guitarist Michael Schenker.

It is best described as mostly melodic hard rock with
progressive undertones. Schenker is famous for his half-black,
half-white Gibson Flying V guitar and for his unorthodox
approach to lead guitar, and is well known in the
neo-classical genre.
