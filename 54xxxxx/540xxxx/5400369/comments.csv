It will be very kind of you if you could post a tutorial for step-by-step instructions for creating such multilanguage install DVD. There are .cmd scripts posted on the internet or in forums, but they are difficult to follow. It is also cool if you want to keep it all to yourself, just please kindly upload updated ISO for windows 7 SP1, SP2, etc.. :P
Thanks for everything you did!"
