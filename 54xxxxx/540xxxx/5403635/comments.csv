[V],twentyforty,2010-03-02T09:16Z,"@JoSox: I remember you very well. Thank you and I'll for sure look into new shows and if they ""fit"" (by the content, 720p regularity and overall quality and popularity /seeding fan-base/) it may get included in weekly schedule. However, as I always did in the past, I might upload episodes even if shows doesn't enter the schedule. 

@htctouch: Have I missed one episode of HIMYM? Nope. Do not worry."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-02T09:25Z,"@houruoha: You MUST use PeerBlock (would block 106 millions of gremlins) AND 3rd party firewall (block leechers IP one by one, transcribing their IP addresses from uTorrent/BitTorrent to ""Blocked addresses"" or similar within your firewall (I use COMODO, it's the best, safest and - for free).
Google about."

And all the others."
,honey88foru,2010-03-02T17:24Z,"This is perfect. Downloading 720p or even XviD would have taken me so much longer and I have to go away tomorrow. This should be finished in an hour or so :D

Thank you so much."
,honey88foru,2010-03-02T17:25Z,"btw, why don't you put ""-TwentyForty"" at the end of the filename? O_o;"
