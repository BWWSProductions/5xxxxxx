[V],AlbaGuBrath,2010-03-04T23:04Z,"oh and just too add, good call with the addition of subtitles, i personally dont need them but im sure there are plenty of others grateful for your efforts :)"
[V],meech,2010-03-05T23:35Z,"Glad you liked the quality.  As far as the sound.  Not sure why it wouldn't be loud enough.  They seem to be just as loud on my p.c. and surround sound system as any other video that I've played.  The sound is 5.1 AC3 pass-through, which if I recall is pretty much the same audio feed that's on the dvd.  The audio isn't re-encoded and therefore should be the same quality as the dvd.  Sorry that you are having problems with it.  Hope that it's just a setting in your player, maybe."

There's not much I can do about the speed.  When I originally seed a torrent, I usually do it at around 250-300 kbps (the max my connection can handle).  Once it is totally seeded and there are enough seeders to keep it alive, I stop seeding the torrent and upload the next one.  I like to do just one at a time, that way it maximizes the time it takes for new torrents to become ""self-sufficient"".  After that however, the speed is entirely up to the people that are uploading and downloading/uploading...seeds and peers.  Some people just don't have enough bandwidth to upload at a fast rate, while others throttle their speed, limiting how fast they upload (usually for no good reason except selfishness).  The second scenario hurts the whole concept of torrenting...it's a character trait - called greed.  In any event, the short answer to your question is...i don't know.  Speed is entirely up to you and the other people who are/have downloading this.  I'm sure the speed will fluctuate (hopefully upwards) as new people jump in and old people jump out."

All i have is TNG all seasons, and there is no reason for me to put out a torrent because you have dominated it. Seasons in 5.1 are so rare!! Maybe i'm missing something, but I've never been able to find any season of any show in 5.1 except for the ones you put out. I've watched countless seasons in 350mb asscrap stereo and longed for a quality experience, especially in the sound department. Guys, please dedicate the extra space and get this. much nicer experience than 150-350mb files. If you can't notice a difference between 640x352 and 720x480, and 2.0 shit and 5.1 ac3, maybe endless re-runs of reality shows would be more up your alley. If you watch more than 2-3 episodes a week, you really need to get equipment/hard Drive space capable of storing/playing these files!! People actually take dvd files and LOWER the sound and LOWER the video, just to make the files SMALLER!!!!! It's harder to understand than the most advanced scientific principles. WHY!!!  Why the hell would you LOWER the quality of an exsisting video/audio stream? ""O my god i just can't take a 14gb season, i just have to have a 2-7 Gb season."" what the hell??? Thanks for being the ONLY guy that keeps the majority that wants decent files in mind. You sir, are great.  Any audio/video problems you are experiencing are the fault of your user settings/software/ or computer. The audio/video from this guys files is better than the DVD. If the audio or video isn't loud or good enough, that's because paramount or whoever handles that part of the dvd production made it that way. I seed your stuff up for however many days it takes me to download which is usually a week or two for whatever given torrent. Thank you so much you bad ass philanthropic scholar. I to have a nice 62' inch tv and surround system, and I love to play Episodes with Tv out!! keep it coming bro!! I Would love stargate atlantis personally, I can't find the bluray rips you mentioned on another torrent."
,moldybudz,2010-09-09T07:15Z,"Thanks for these. Great video quality and its nice to have a real 5.1 audio track on these. I'm a huge audiophile when it comes to my tv shows and movies so this fits my collection perfectly.

I use a SPDIF out from my media server into my receiver and it decodes the AC3 5.1 as Dolby Digital 5.1 flawlessly. Sounds perfect and really adds depth to the episodes, especially the musical score and any battle scenes.

This is most likely the issue others have had with it not sounding good. On 2.0 or 2.1 speakers just pumping out Stereo sound, you won't hear the audio the way it is meant to be heard."
