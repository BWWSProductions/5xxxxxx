2x2 giga ddr3 1600Mhz
GTX 260 Core 216

You do not need to install the game using deamon tools or other tool like that. If you want, extract the iso file and run Setup.exe

WORKS GREAT.Thanks for the Uploader"

For Windows 7 64 Bit: Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Wow6432Node/Electronic Arts/Battlefield Bad Company 2 

2.change the language to English and the locale to En

Windows 7 crashes?
OK it seems got a fix for anybody that CTD or blackscreen after launch game.... GO TO your documents folder and find ""BFBC2"" folder. Open it and there will be ""settings.ini"", change the directx value from AUTO to 9. That work for me, Windows 7 ultimate 64bit.

,telep_man,2010-03-06T19:03Z,"Problem with mouse and keyboard. I can walk around ok but the middle mouse button doesn't work (I can't kill the guard with the knife on the 1st level). I tried to assign some other button instead, but it doesn't react to the keyboard at all. Does anyone have this problem? BTW, the game runs in english, and my OS is win7 ultimate 64bit. Thanx in advance"
