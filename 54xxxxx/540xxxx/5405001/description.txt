After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.

So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 

Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

Once I was talking with a german friend and I observed that the best Yes albums for me were those where Rick Wakeman played...

So my friend gave me a present: 62 albums of this keyboard virtuoso. I never had the time to listen them all... but I guess you can...

This is not the complete discography, but it's a good sample anyway...
