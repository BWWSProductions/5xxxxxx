Please be patient and wait for pro teams to work on this like razor or reloaded. SAVES DON'T WORK!!!"
,lordtuxlozad,2010-03-03T22:16Z,"your prevoius crack doesn work.i ll try this
i have xp sp3"
,n-t0wn,2010-03-03T22:21Z,im still waiting for the english version :(
,Man_123,2010-03-03T22:23Z,"Damn, it actually works! Just got the game loading screen, don't know how smooth it'll go later, but anyway, thanks!"
,nasos95,2010-03-03T22:26Z,"No it doesn't work...It's an EXACT copy of ""AC2 BETA CRACK""
It gets stuck in the First Animus Session where you see the ""birth"" of Ezio!"
,lordtuxlozad,2010-03-03T22:26Z,"are you trollin' me?
it works only till he lays on animus"
,pesh095,2010-03-03T22:26Z,Can we SaveGame with this crack ?
,nasos95,2010-03-03T22:27Z,Yes but it doesn't matter because you CAN'T play the game!!
,nasos95,2010-03-03T22:29Z,"CafEmulatorTeam...something more you can do please??
In your PC it works normally?
Because in ALL others we get stuck on the Animus scene!!"
,Man_123,2010-03-03T22:30Z,"Well, yeap, it stucks at animus. At least I saw intro video."
,amdm,2010-03-03T22:53Z,"Well SKIDROW cracked SH 5, witch has the same DRM as AC 2, so its just a matter of time now"
,ThomasDollar,2010-03-03T22:53Z,this torrent just got deleted? hey good to see gamesfromtorrentsru is still active
,WayOne,2010-03-03T23:02Z,Yep SH5 has already cracked. I believe AC2 has also been cracked... they are just waiting for the English version to get released so they can make a scene release. Now we just have to lay back and wait for a team to release it tomorrow or after tomorrow.
[V],Mbb15,2010-03-03T23:05Z,*****This night ASII will be released*****
[V],Mbb15,2010-03-03T23:05Z,FIX *****This night ACII will be released***** 
,WayOne,2010-03-03T23:11Z,Mbb15  Really?!? Can you tell us which group is going to release it and when... damn i'm not going to sleep tonight :)
,RobertinhoNIKE,2010-03-03T23:14Z,"To Mbb15:

A multi5 release will be released? Tank you."
[V],Mbb15,2010-03-03T23:44Z,"''its only a guess'', I think it will be Skidrow or Razor1911(not reloaded) and there comes a PROPER version by one of them because the group that will release the game first will forget something and thats why there comes a PROPER release I think its will come in 12 hours from now
(Dont read this, this theory makes no sense) "
,lorikano,2010-03-03T23:55Z,"Off course it will come out in 12 hours the release of this title is inevitable ,I was thinking of a bit sooner though."
,WayOne,2010-03-04T00:04Z, Mbb15 Thank you for the info. And yes your theory definitely  makes sense.
[V],Mbb15,2010-03-04T00:04Z,I said that so I know im not wrong at that point lol
,Noobhead,2010-03-04T00:35Z,"OMG this is also russian, dont download if ur not russian, cuz its unreadable :p"

,KilleRRRtk,2010-03-04T05:44Z,Just find savegame after animus and play with crack
,dphunterr,2010-03-04T05:58Z,"if someone could provide us with a savegame right after the animus, it would help us to hold on till the real crack comes out."
,weezy69,2010-03-04T05:59Z,i got some saves i just dont know where in the ubisoft folder to put it
,CAfEmulatorTeam,2010-03-04T07:09Z,"I do not understand what errors you have.

I took this picture with my phone.
Could you tell me where you get the error? When you try to use the animus?"
,Surfgen,2010-03-04T07:37Z,Just white screen after animus...
,lordtuxlozad,2010-03-04T07:44Z,"yes

,sebek335,2010-03-04T10:42Z,Yes white screen after :(. 
,mn88,2010-03-04T11:16Z,"it is possible to change language to english in regedit.. but language change doesn't work in game. voice and text is still russian after you install this v2 crack. btw I also get the ""white freeze"" after the animus :/ if anyone have savegames, pls post them here."
,Cipulla,2010-03-04T12:24Z,"@CAfEmulatorTeam: My problem is (I think, all others have the same one), that if you get inside the animus there´s just a white screen. Nothing else. I waited around 2 minutes, maybe it was loading, but nothing changed. funnny thing is, you still can press ""esc"" to go to the menu and shut down the game normaly... Could you pls provide some saves after the animus??? And pls. write where to put them because I couldnt find until now a saving folder. THX"
,EvilClown_,2010-03-04T12:46Z,"Yeah, its starting, but after he lies on this machine its just white screen. Too bad, but thnx for trying."
,CAfEmulatorTeam,2010-03-04T13:45Z,"Make sure you are using our client.
I had no problem with the animus. Please just, I will upload the save game when I get home."
,Cipulla,2010-03-04T13:54Z,"What client? the ubisoft gamelauncher? Yes, of course. And your DVD from here. But, like you read, all the other guyscan´t make it run. it´s not working on our machines :("
,Knight1997,2010-03-04T15:20Z,i have same problem i stay on animus white screen please help us
,RobertinhoNIKE,2010-03-04T15:36Z,"But, where is de release of Skidrow?? Because, Skidrow cracked the Silent Hunter 5 with same DRM of Assassin`s Creed 2. When will be released de multi5 vesion? Tankyou."
,WayOne,2010-03-04T15:53Z,"Look. I'm 100% that every group has already cracked it or at least know how to crack it. They are just waiting to get the English version which is going to be tomorrow (5th march). I'm sure they would never make a scene release with a Russian language only game. 

So just wait until tomorrow, everything is going to be fine. ^^"
,miragebauer,2010-03-04T15:58Z,"OK dude i installed and the game is english, to cafemulatorteam: PLZ upload ur savegame after u enter the animus.

,Cipulla,2010-03-04T17:34Z,"i read on other boards, that there are a lot of triggers and if you have a save after animus, there will be an other whitescreen, after you´ve talked to your uncle...

,wn-47,2010-03-04T17:52Z,i cant find multi 9 
,RobertinhoNIKE,2010-03-04T18:06Z,"A group of Russian crackers have said that today, March 4, would launch the full version of crack. The same people who took out the BETA crack. When the crack will draw them without bugs? Thank you."

I also saw the english files... but i'm not in such a hurry so i can wait for a scene release like skidrow, reloaded or razor. I mean they have already cracked SH 5 and so it's going to happen with AC2. They are just waiting for the english version - multi5 or 9. If it's out then we'll be seeing the release rather soon. Anyway i'm going to play Just Cause 2 demo from steam so waiting is not a problem problem ^^"

,Cutor,2010-03-05T18:46Z,How it work?
,john-a,2010-03-05T19:14Z,"Assuming you got the game to work you can download savefile here: h**p://lollandster.com/temp/AC2_Savegames.rar

Hit the cogwheel in the top right corner before the launcher starts the game and confirm to disable online storage of your savegames (next to the minimize button)

Logout and replace/copy the savefiles to C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\storage\am9objYw\4 (the last two folder names might be unique). Next time you launch the game it will not download your saves but use the one on your hdd

I do not know who supplied this savefile, but it did work for me. Got it from Leroy&Doc Snyder7987 at Usenet"
,john-a,2010-03-05T20:33Z,"Sorry, but it seams the game whites out when trying to meet Mario at the training ground. I guess for now this game works about as good as a demo would."
,Surfgen,2010-03-06T16:48Z,Well.. I'm just wanna to tell you guys... I bought a licensed game.. and it's very beatiful and playable... sorry for my english. In Russia Assassin's creed 2 cost in 550 rubles. Very nice game... buy it... for ubiplay online service (like a LIVE in Microsoft). Have fun.

,erzsike66,2010-03-07T18:54Z,"here is message from Razor buddies:
This is the first day that we have been working on Assassin's Creed 2 and in this time we have achieved alot. We have bypassed the Ubisoft Launcher and you won't have to keep entering the cd key again and again. Even if you disconnect from the internet, the game will continue. And about the savegames; The Ubisoft server has only started working on March 5th. Only then we have been able to find out where the trigger files go to, their format and other vital information needed to make a working crack. A crack should be released the 5th, 6th or in the worst case scenario, the 7th of March."
