 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                              
 Blaze MediaConvert is a powerful multimedia (audio, image, and video)      
 batch converter and CD ripper software application supporting conversion   
 among over 70 image, audio, animation and video formats quickly and        
 easily. Unlike other conversion applications that support only one or (at  
 most) a few formats, Blaze MediaConvert is able to batch convert among     
 nearly all multimedia formats conceivable.                                 
                                                                            
 For audio formats, unidirectional conversions and compression among CD,    
 MP3, WMA, WAV, and OGG are all supported. Powerful, yet intuitive audio CD 
 burning is also supported from all supported formats.                      
                                                                            
 Blaze MediaConvert can also perform two-way video conversions among        
 MPEG-1, MPEG-2, AVI, WMV, Multi-Page TIFF, and FLIC. The Video Constructor 
 combines selected images as frames to create a video in the destination    
 format. The Video Decompiler saves all frames within the selected video    
 file as single images. The extracted images can be saved as BAY, BMP, GIF, 
 JPG, PCX, PNG, PNM, RAS, RGB, TGA, TIFF and XPM.                           
                                                                            
 The Audio CD Recorder allows you to burn MP3, WMA, WAV, and OGG files to   
 CDR and CDR/W discs. Its features include Fast multi-threaded design,      
 Advanced buffering for superior performance, Easy track manipulation,      
 Works easily with IDE and SCSI CD drives, Disk caching offered for the     
 best quality results possible, and the ability to Write from network       
 locations with caching feature.                                            
                                                                            
 The CD Converter provides many advanced options, including a FreeDB        
 auto-save feature, which enables track title, artist, and album            
 information to be dynamically downloaded from the Internet CD Database and 
 used when converting CD tracks to WAV, MP3 or WMA.                         
                                                                            
 Additional features include Animated GIF creation, Animated GIF            
 decompiling, complete drag and drop support, versatile preferences for     
 maximum control and much more.                                             
                                                                            
 The conversions are easy to use and straight-forward. Simply select the    
 type of conversion to perform, add the files to convert, arrange the files 
 in any desired order (optional), select the output format, and select the  
 convert command.
