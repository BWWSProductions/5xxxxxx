,the_shroud,2010-03-04T09:31Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for all the great uploads. Currently seeding all 6 ep of EoD but haven't watched it yet. Saving ti for a butt numbing weekend. The movie is opening here next week...perfect.
One request though, can you do Damages S03E06? Its been out for a few days now but no small size.
Thanks again"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-04T09:48Z,"@the_shroud: I cannot do Damages regularly, however if I have seen that Scene haven't released XviD, I jumped in to help people.
As you know, full season have started and for sure I intend not to push any of my regular shows from my weekly schedule.
So, when I've seen that both versions of Damages were released, I haven't bothered myself with it (especially considering the shit shoved on me from Damages fans in the past).
Here is the link for XviD

,the_shroud,2010-03-04T10:10Z,"OK, but thanks anyway. Guess I'll have to try and encode it myself. Tried it on a couple of Vampire Diaries with Videora. One was 1+GB 720p and the other was 360p. The first took about 24hrs and the second took more than overnight. But it did end up just under 200MB"
,evisecrate,2010-03-04T11:43Z,"Don't know why but when I tried to unpack it came up unable due to corrupt or unkmown format, any ideas twenty four, first of your DL's to have problems."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-04T12:21Z,"@evisecrate: Unpack what?
Click on the ""Files: 1"" in upper left page corner.
There is nothing to ""unpack"".
Just to play Criminal.Minds.S05E16.HDTV.H264.[PC.Mac.Xbox.PS3.ipod].mp4 in ANY mp4 capable player or device.
"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-04T12:52Z,"@the_shroud: If you can wait, I would up one approx. 10h from now. That's the best I can."
