,Cashy57,2010-03-04T01:35Z,7 is too hard to get free that's why.
,skibbeb,2010-03-04T03:18Z,also 7 is much larger and takes more memory

,NoiRMonD,2010-03-07T17:56Z,"Is this version solving the problems with the airport wifi? I mean, there is a lot of people that had problems (including myself) installing the drivers from boot camp in XP. The thing is that the airport wifi is impossible to run with those drivers. Anybody here with the same problem?

Thanks anyway! :)"

You must be plain stupid, Linux is far more superior than Windows 7, Who uses the Windows 7 trash anyway?

@Cashy
So is XP also, unfortunatly it seems like XP is a heavy target for new Viruses, wonder why? M$ perhaps?

@skibbeb
That is completely true, However I myself use Windows 7 but I made a little workaround to decrease the memory usage (I can't do anyting about the size) I installed bbLean (desktop replacement) on top of Win 7, not much but a little less mem usage and CPU craving. 

@Talking Evil
I so completely agree! they should have keept the GUI, it was the top of the evolution.

@Archpope
I guess your living will become harder (for a while at least) with Windows 7.

@Me!
I guess (or should I say hope?) that Microsoft lost some market shares with this new Vista / Windows 7 approach for a GUI. I totally loved XP and NOT loved Vista (Which I never got) I also do NOT love Windows 7 and that I have.

This is a 32-bit version of XP."
,skjhmduvx,2011-05-28T02:45Z,XP Compatibility is absolute crap so with a windows 7 system this is an easy reliable way to keep using your windows xp programs/games.  Backwards compatibility is too hard for microsoft apparently.

i will seed for a while "
,llleeeooo,2011-07-01T17:02Z,contains a very cleverly crafted virus!
,llleeeooo,2011-07-04T15:05Z,I detract that last statement.  I'm not sure where the virus came from.
,gunner152,2011-07-10T06:31Z,How do I install this????
