N2KMaster Black Hat Coder and Webmaster Pack 2 - Video and Audio Tools
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Blender Portable - Don't use it personally, dont really care for it I liked 3D Max better

Bonk Portable - General Video Tool

Net FX from M$ - included cuz its required

GIMP Portable - Another graphic tool i dont use but hear good things about it.

K-Lite Codec Pack - Mega Edition (stops the annoying codec errors, has everything included)

VLC Portable - VLC hands down best audio/video player out there in my opinion cuz of its compatibility with everything that ive seen from avi, mpeg and other normals to MP4, MKV, RMVB, without loss or degration

Audio DVD Creator + Serial - make audio dvds that are playable in your home DVD Player

Ultra MP4 Converter - Convert/Extract any video file to MP4,MP3,AVI,MPEG and about 100 more types effortless, does large batchs of files to. Used it for a while, the version i got was infected, this version is cleaned and includes serial

PC-DJ Red 5.1 + Serial - Used it for years, loved it, all the other versions of PC-DJ i hated, even the new ones, been using this since the pentium 2 days.

Macromedia Flash Portable - Portable version of a flash editor that everyone uses

Super DVD Creator + Serial - I included this and another app due to this does a really nice job on avi, mpeg, and mp4 however it doesnt burn flv files to dvd so i included the other tool for that. This makes really nice menus, makes a dvd quite quickly, i use it to burn off the reworkz i do and tested the dvds on several machines and they all worked fine

Xilisoft DVD Creator + Serial - second DVD authoring tool, does mp4,flv,and more formats that the other DVD creator cant do, doesnt make any title screens but makes VCD as well

Watermark Master + Crack - AS SEEN IN N2KMASTER REWORKZ OF ZOMBIELAND, TRAILER PARK BOYS 2: COUNTDOWN TO LIQUOR DAY, ASTRO BOY, AND MORE! Love this app, blurs out watermarks in videos, cleans video, fixes gamma, adds natural lighting cuz sometimes gamma doesnt always look right, fix colors and more. It can increase resolutions of cams and more and clean up a lot of really bad cams. The normal 4/10 rated cams can usually turn out to a 7/10 to 8/10 which fixes your wait for a nice legit axxo or r5 line to come out.WARNING the crack tests false positive with AVG but it is a clean cracker so ignore the warnings.
