An amazing book, clearly designed to help people. The author's fearsome refutation of religion is only matched by his compassionate beliefs. After annihilating nihilistic belief systems, the author offers up replacements and theories for maintaining the human civilization. Part I and II are designed to identify the problems of the world at large. While the rest of the book is clearly meant to show people how to fix these problems.

Truly a great read!
