Release notes:

Multi-platinum selling recording artist Birdman is primed to rule with
"Pricele$$". Three singles from the album are burning up the radio airwaves as
anticipation for the album escalates. Birdman's current single, "Money To Blow,"
featuring the vocals of reigning Cash Money superstar Lil Wayne and Young
Money's newest red-hot addition Drake, was the No. 1 most added song at Urban
Radio. Produced by the talented Drumma Boy (Rick Ross, T.I., Fabolous, Plies,
Young Jeezy), "Money To Blow" reached over 1 million listeners in its first week
of release. On a similar trajectory, the banger "Always Strapped," produced by
Mr. Beatz (Rick Ross, T-Pain & Lil Wayne) reached No. 5 on Urban Radio charts
and has a combined radio audience of 433 million in Top 40, Crossover, and
Urban. "Always Strapped" is a Top 10 Ringtone for the Universal Motown Record
Group, with 350,000 downloads sold to date.

The buzz for Priceless continues to rise with new Cash Money signee Jay Sean
bringing his British sensibility to Birdman's "Written on Her," which was the
No. 1 most added track on Crossover Radio as of August 25th, attracting an
audience of 8.5 million. "Written on Her," is No. 22 on the Crossover Charts, is
gaining momentum with a 40% increase in sales over three weeks. With the release
of "Pricele$$", Birdman, a man of considerable talents, answers his first
calling -- making hit records -- which he has done time and again, selling 7
million mobile products and with the platinum "Pop Bottles" ringtone. "It's not
about showing who has the most swagger," Birdman says. "That all comes with the
package. I'm just being me. But the focus is always great music. I want to
stretch myself. The overall theme I'm trying to get across with this album is
life is priceless. You have to enjoy it. You have to live like it's your last
day. Live how you feel."
