,WvBrsci,2010-03-03T04:43Z,Thankyouthankyouthankyou! For a while this one was somewhat hard to find credible torrents for.
,WvBrsci,2010-03-03T06:16Z,"So, I'm not complaining; I'm not in a position to do so. Though I always seed enthusiastically, I'm still a leech on those who up the torrents. You guys have my gratitude. Just wanted to point that out before I continue.

I was a bit disappointed with the availability and speed, so I connected to 130 peers to check the availability, and it's 0.05. That's not very impressive, even for a pretty new .torrent. What's the problem? Is it just lazy ingrates who won't seed after dl'ing, or something less transient? Are someone getting good speed on this torrent?"
