`       CUT THE CRAP PLAYLIST - SERIOUSLY UNCRAP - FEBRUARY 2010        `
       ```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

REPACK: track 6 is 320kbps as it should be, and album is correctly named.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

This month: New Four Tet, Late Of The Pier, Xylos, Zeus (remember them
from CTC August 2009?), Marina And The Diamonds, and a bunch more. Tiga 
demonstrates his uniquely French-Canadian brand of crazy. Diplo and Robyn 
collaborate and fuck shit up. Justice x2. And Phantogram, oh my god. CTC
is kinda of all over the place this month... hopefully in a good way.

Thanks so much to everyone who submitted songs. Unfortunately, I didn't
get to use many (I'm trying to stick to 25 tracks as a max from now on),
but I really do appreciate all of them. I'll be sending all of you a
personal email ASAP.

Submissions used this month: Caro Emerald, Robyn + Diplo, and Two Door
Cinema Club (a version of the track I had never heard before, with an
extended intro).

Know of a song or artist that deserves to be in a future CTC Playlist?
