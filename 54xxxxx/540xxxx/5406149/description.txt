Paul Merton in Europe 5of6 PDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Having travelled far afield to explore China and India, Paul Merton is ready to take things easy with a relaxing trip around Europe. "But things didn't turn out quite as expected," he says. Far from gorging on sumptuous food and wine, lying on ravishing beaches and enjoying breathtaking architecture, Paul will be exploring some of the lesser-known areas of the continent. "Prepare to see Europe like you've never seen it before," he promises.

Part5:
In France, Paul meets show jumpers who perform without horses, hears from a playwright who lived in a zoo with a panda, and learns the bittersweet story of a heartbroken graffiti artist. In Champagne, Paul discovers that boundary changes could make some locals very rich indeed. The intrepid explorer also visits a macabre museum devoted to the horrors of the world, and catches up with the man who has invented the worldâ€™s first full-body rollerblading suit.
