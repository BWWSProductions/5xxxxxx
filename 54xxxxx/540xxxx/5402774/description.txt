Singer-songwriter Shooter Jennings, the son of country music outlaws Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter, talks with Alex about his latest project with novelist Stephen King. Jennings and King teamed up to produce a concept album entitled Black Ribbons, an indictment against government censorship and the New World Order.

Alex also talks with Pastor Clenard Howard Childress, Jr. of Montclair, New Jersey, who uses his â€œThe Urban Prophetâ€ radio show to deliver a pro-life and pro-family message to urban America. Childress is the founder of the pro-life Blackgenocide.org, a website designed to reach the Afro-American community with the truth about abortion.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
