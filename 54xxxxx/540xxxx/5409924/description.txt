"Part 1 Marathon Special"


Today's broadcast looks at part one of award-winning Italian filmmaker Massimo Mazzucco's documentary [in eight parts], The New American Century.  It presents the historical, philosophical, economical and political background -- some of which is totally unknown to the public -- that lend support to the accusation that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were in fact an inside-job.

This film goes in detail through the untold history of The Project for the New American Century with tons of archival footage and connects it right into the present.  It exposes how every major war in US history was based on a complete fraud with video of insiders themselves admitting it.

================================================

"Guns & Butter" investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, "Guns & Butter: The Economics of Politics" reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
