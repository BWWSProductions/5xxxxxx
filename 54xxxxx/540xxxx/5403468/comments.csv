,Vossiej,2010-03-02T08:01Z,"Hi HR, does this mean you're back or that you are trying to pass your job on to someone else?"
[V],jainmehul,2010-03-02T08:22Z,how to use this i didn't understood
,sabian212,2010-03-02T17:14Z,All the best man!:) keep us posted...
,piscesca,2010-03-03T16:14Z,"Thanks... Been looking for something like this under ubuntu...

P.S.

HR - Do you have a script that will encode to .mp4 and hardcode soft subtitles into the vid... i.e. for Godfather II, I keep trying to find a good way of making a decent backup for watching off my PS3 and not have to keep pulling out my DVD or use my computer.

Thanks, and keep up the great work and best of luck on the job search... seems tougher than usual these days."
,greatsunrise,2010-03-03T21:08Z,"how went the interview, brotha?"
,HellenKeller420,2010-03-04T02:33Z,"I dont really understand why you are going to quit uploading, especially for when the big movies like Avatar and Book of Eli come out... i am not to sure who to go to now, anyways you are my favorite uploader and good luck with the job"
,tphart88,2010-03-05T01:09Z,"dude hr you are the best- would it be possible for you to put out the pulp fiction (ipod) torrent without the zip file, its one of my all time favs and i cant get it with the .zip -Also if you dont mind it would be badass if you put the evil dead trilogy on in ipod format. 
thanks for the 17 great movies i have allready downloaded!!"

,olglow,2010-04-06T05:31Z,"About a week or so before HolyRoses went MIA, I requested:

Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut
Terry Gilliam's Brazil
Plan 9 From Outer Space (color or not, doesn't matter to me)
Ed Wood
and What About Bob 

any of those would be awesome, but I would also like to see Tron, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, or King of Kong: Fistful of Quarters.

Doing any of those would be AWESOME, but I'm just happy to see someone else with the same set of skills as HR is willing to take up the slack. I'll be happy with just about anything.
Thanks BloodyRoses!"
,saltbrook,2010-04-08T13:09Z,Missing you real bad HolyRoses.....please please come back....piratebay without you sucks big time for me...m sure for most of the guys too....

,kabubuki,2010-04-18T04:21Z,"Hi HR,

Thanks for all these great uploads. The quality and compactness of file size are just superb.  

Too bad I'm not proficient enough in UNIX to use your tools.  I've tried other tools on Mac to do what you do and simply can't get to your level of video + audio quality with small file sizes.

Good luck with job hunting...  All the best..."
,jcja123,2010-04-18T04:40Z,theres nothing wrong with ppl trying to get a better job! if all the experience some ppl have is Mcdonalds then so what??? there just trying to get a job! thats why there web sites like monster and stuff. its not there fault u cant find a job. now dont get me wrong i hope u find a job and stuff cause i like all ur movies and stuff but dont downgrade someone like that cause they might not have all the experience you do!
