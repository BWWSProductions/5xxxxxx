,Aces77,2010-03-02T23:41Z,Thanks Raymond ... Seeding now ... :))
,954blade,2010-09-22T22:19Z,Thanks Raymond.
,Lethalbynature,2011-04-09T04:15Z,"Raymond all of your shit comes out nice, but why the hell are you uploading this in spanish or whatever language that is?? I downloaded it for nothing man"
,Nitraam88,2011-04-11T11:36Z,"Because it's a spanish movie, and dubbed movies are nothing short of heresy?"
,Lethalbynature,2011-04-25T19:43Z,So meaning there isnt a copy of this in english? Yeah overdubbed movies the lips dont match suck..
,raa714,2011-07-16T05:44Z, I would rather have it in English that have to try to read the entire movie at the bottom of the screen!!
,daniel98,2011-07-18T07:36Z,thaaat's because you're a fucking illiterate.
,doomsday2012lol,2011-09-01T22:46Z,"Fucking BOOOoo this man, English or GTFO we conquered the Nazi's and we run shit so L2English"
,zappnickel,2011-09-25T19:45Z,"If you want to watch this movie in english, they've remade it. It's called Quarantine 2. Shut up with the complaining and do your homework! The Spanish version is better anyway."
,Alyxm,2011-10-16T17:47Z,"The first film had subtitles, and its better than its american rip off quarantine.  So get the hell off kids from downloading films, seriously anyone under the age of 21 shouldnt be allowed download films, you ungrateful little shits."
,bazalo92,2011-12-01T14:04Z,Why does it say it has english subtitles when it doesnt?
,DctrEvil,2011-12-17T07:51Z,"I'm with raa714. There are very few movies I will tolerate reading subtitles for (Hero being one of them). I hate the spanish culture, their language, and people...but if its a good film I'd like to watch it, just not in their bastard-gutter language.

Are there versions of these films that are eng dubbed?"
,theghostwriter,2012-03-04T16:07Z,Pretty funny reading the comments from those who don't like subtitles. Bunch of illiterates. I can't imagine what it must be like to be limited to English-only (read: American) films. Boooooring.
,tom444422,2012-03-26T00:04Z,"Ignore the barely literate spoilt kids-advice stick to your predictable hollywood rubbish and don't even bother watching anything with subs-after all its going to take a great effort to read the stuff.Movies in foreign languages whats the world coming to-how selfish-should make em all in english eh??

Raymondhome, your tireless work is always appreciated-only just found out there is a Rec 2-lol! loved the first one, can I recommend for your good self the excellent South American ''The Man of the Year (O Homem do Ano) ''.
Thanks a many:)"
,lizmm,2012-03-31T12:36Z,"Nice one Raymond for uploading in original version. GTF you philistines
"
,781redruM,2012-04-16T02:28Z,"Damn, people are even lazy to read nowadays...
Anyway, thanks for the movie Raymond, I appreciate it."
,bluesborn,2012-04-23T05:05Z,"Subs are the only way to go.I even use them in some English films if I'm having a problem with the sound or accents etc.There is nothing cheesier to me than dubbed movies,although admittedly every once in a blue moon you'll see one done right and the actors don't sound like robots."
,Frozteh,2012-05-19T02:10Z,"Unless you're retarded, you'd know that all Rec movies are originally in spanish. The english dubbed ones are entirely different movies, and not nearly as good as the originals. "
,taptone,2012-06-02T11:22Z,is this the one when he is fist deep in her ass?
,e4tTh3b4bY,2012-06-22T00:07Z,"Wow, some people are so lazy. ""Oh no! I have to exercise my brain a bit by reading"". I swear, soon people are going to just stop reading altogether. Reading is just too difficult I guess. 

In any case, thank you raymondhome for the great torrent. I don't mind reading, as I am capable of watching the movie AND reading the dialogue at the same time, unlike these spoiled little children these days that get everything they want handed to them on a silver platter. Ignore their ignorant statements and please keep bringing us good work like this. "
,vampzcore,2012-07-05T19:33Z,thanks!!
