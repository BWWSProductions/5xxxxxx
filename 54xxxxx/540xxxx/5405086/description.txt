Schisms in Christianity - Religious Wars and Civil Wars:

Although the core message of Jesus was love and peace, Christianity after the time of Jesus evolved to become the most cruel and bloody state/church system endured by humanity.

In every religion we find fanatic groups or crazy rulers who committed terrorist acts or crimes against their own people or the followers of other religions. But generally, these acts were sporadic and were not supported by mainstream religions.

Christendom, however, was a different story. The official Christian political/religious organization was behind all the atrocities committed in the name of Jesus Christ that  started in the 4th century and continued for more than 1400 year.

The early atrocities were in the form of systematic religious persecutions of the Christian sects that differed with the official version of Christianity adopted and enforced by the Roman Emperors. Then came the Crusades that continued for about 200 years, with the First Crusade in 1095-1099, and the last one-the Ninth Crusade in 1271-1272. 

They include the Inquisitions that continued for about 700 years; the  Medieval Inquisition (1184â€“1230s), the Spanish Inquisition (1478â€“1834), the Portuguese Inquisition (1536â€“1821) and the Roman Inquisition (1542 â€“ 1860s).

They include the colonization missions in the 15th- 17th centuries that caused the annihilation or enslavement of native people in many parts of the worlds. And within the same period we had the religious wars and civil wars in Europe between the different Christian sects.
