    Raymond looks to the UK's favourite fruit, apples, for     
    inspiration. Raymond returns to memories of childhood     
    with a simple apple tart made with a foolproof pastry    
    and custard filling. Oven-baked apples prove that this    
    simplest of fruit can create a dish without much work,     
    with the addition of a calvados caramel sauce and         
    toasted nuts. Next, apples get a savoury twist as they   
    are marinated with lemon verbena and olive oil to         
    accompany a confit of fresh salmon. Raymond's piece de     
    resistance is an apple souffle prepared using a           
    hollowed-out apple, served with a sabayon and apple      
    sorbet.                                                   
                                                               
    Raymond travels to Kent to learn how to graft apples      
    from fruit expert William Sibley, so that he can grow    
    many different varieties of apples on one tree in his     
    own soon-to-be planted orchard.
