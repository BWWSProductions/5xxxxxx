          RELEASE NOTES:                                     
                                                               
      However you connect to the Internet...through your home    
      computer, workstation, or a laptop on the road you leave   
      "tracks" behind you through your IP address. Whether       
      you're surfing web pages, shopping online, or even simply  
      chatting with friends, your IP address is recorded by      
      servers in various places and logged. This is fine with    
      trusted sites...but what about those that are "not         
      trusted"?                                                  
                                                                 
      If you really think about what can happen when someone     
      gets a hold of your IP address, it's pretty scary and      
      many of us don't think about it much...until it's too      
      late. iSurfer Shield protects you from that "too late"     
      happening to you                                           
                                                                 
      Spammers, phishers, and hackers are working hard behind    
      the scenes of those less trustworthy sites. Once they can  
      pick up your real IP address, they can often hack right    
      into your PC and harvest personal data or your financial   
      information. Identity theft happens every day of the       
      week, and hackers know how to do it simply to those who    
      aren't protected!                                          
                                                                 
      iSurfer Shield STOPS this disaster BEFORE it happens by    
      helping you to protect your IP and email identities.       
      Prying eyes, malicious sites, and spammers? They can       
      forget about trying to get to your information. They can   
      keep trying, but iSurfer Shield will shut them down cold   
      every time and eventually they'll just give up.
