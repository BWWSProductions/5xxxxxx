Fabulous - Series 01 to 03 - Audio Comedy - BBC Radio 7 via DVB-T 
6 x 15 & 8 x 30 Minute Episodes - 128Kbps - Mp3 - Slimoo



Radio sitcom focusing on Faye, a woman who wants to lead a glamorous lifestyle but is thwarted by laziness, disorganisation and work commitments.

Faye is anxious. She knows that today's women are "Fabulous". They have the job, the house, the colour-co-ordinated capsule wardrobe; they cope with singledom, marriage and having kids with peanut allergies; and they all do it effortlessly, with nothing more than a copy of Prima and a poem by Pam Ayres to guide them. So Faye wonders why she can't pull it off. 

Fabulous unearths the slightly unhinged madwoman that lurks behind this "having it all" fantasy. The sitcom follows Faye as she tries to get through her day with her "fabulous" facade intact.

www.comedy.co.uk Review: 

Quote:The first series of this sitcom provided some bite-sized amusement to the ears, but this was somewhat at the expense of men (portrayed, in the main, as idiots).

The episodes in the second series were extended to thirty minutes each, allowing time for longer adventures and some new characters to be introduced (more ineffectual men!).

Some felt this second series was an improvement on the first. However, on reflection, we think we preferred the first series more. The comedy was stronger when the focus was more squarely on the battle between Faye and her boss Edith.
