Burn Notice Season 2 HDTV

Spies don't get fired; they get burned. Michael Westen receives a 'burn notice' while on assignment in Nigeria. Dumped in his Miami hometown with no money or resources to his name, Michael works as a freelance spy/private investigator to fund his investigation into who burned him and why.

This is complete set except for S02E06 Bad Blood and S02E07 Rough Seas that will be made available for download of the entire season in HDTV when they have been obtained, but in the meantime you may wish to download the standard definition episodes for S02E06 and S02E07 yourself.
