You get your dayly dose of porn, molestin, murder, war and other shit legaly on tv."
,Zirc0n,2010-03-02T17:54Z,"Why would you even bother commenting if you don't like hentai? If you don't like the content, just ignore it and move along."
,brnblnk,2010-03-03T00:43Z,"This is awesome! But ti's too big! I would suggest breaking this up into parts, but I can't grab all 67 gigs all at once so I'm just grabbing the A's right now. Just a thought - thx so much for sharing a killer collection!"
,brnblnk,2010-03-03T00:45Z,"One more thought - at 67 gigs, how many folks will be able to seed that? Don't get me wrong, this is awesome and I hope that everyone will get a chance to enjoy it."
,Zirc0n,2010-03-03T19:48Z,"The RAR files are split by letter. If you're looking to some useable data quickly, download a letter like S or E.

In hindsight I probably should have made individual RARs instead of split archives."
,Zirc0n,2010-03-03T20:23Z,"If anyone has 200KB/s+ upload and would be willing to seed this for a few weeks, I'd be happy to burn this on a bunch of DVDs and mail them out to someone. Just email me on zirc0n@bigfoot.com if you're interested. Don't email me if you're just going to take the data and not seed it."
,romeoluv2539,2010-03-04T04:49Z,I would be able to help and upload for you up to 500 GB if i had the files to do so......
,Zirc0n,2010-03-04T05:29Z,Email me and let me know the address to ship the DVDs to. I'll burn them tomorrow.
,romeoluv2539,2010-03-05T14:22Z,I tried to email you and it came back as delivery failure....are you sure you type the correct email? Send me a message at Romeoluv2539 @ gmail dot.com
,Zirc0n,2010-03-15T04:51Z,"I'm working on web-seeding some of this. Please add http://rule34.20x.cc/torrents to your web seeds list.

In uTorrent, you can do this by going into the torrent properties, clicking the Advanced tab, and pasting the URL into the box."
,t260x3,2010-12-03T12:14Z,"how was this ripped?
