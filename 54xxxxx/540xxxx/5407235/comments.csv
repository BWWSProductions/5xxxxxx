,kiasu1,2010-04-30T06:36Z,"Hope it is less buggy than number 2. I LOVED that game until one mission that crashed more than 50 times. I even turned every visual setting down to the lowest detail on my Quad Core with Geforce 8800 GT at which point i gave up. 

Searches on the Internet showed it was a common problem.

Anyone ever complete Star Wolves 2?"
,Wsmack,2010-06-14T15:29Z,"I saw this game in a magazine and I liked it, i'm downloading it now. I think that the best scenario-tactical fleet game is Nexus:The Jupiter Incident. Just those who don't understand it won't like it, but I am learning programming and I'm just dreaming of making a game like it! It is absolutely perfect."
,Wsmack,2010-06-14T15:33Z,"And to answer kiasu1, game crashes only happen when the game is not fully compatible with your grapic card. For example, some texturing procedures don't work on my old ATI and I get a snowwhite of Oblivion and many other games won't even change resolution. Mirror Edge, however, has a new graphic option that works only on a couple of Nvidia cards, which makes the game freeze when other graphic card is required to perform that."
,YiffyFox117,2010-07-17T06:59Z,"Could someone PLEASE tell me how to get the skidrow torrents working? I don\'t know how to un-rar it and get it to work. Every time I do, I get a message saying that the file is corrupt and can\'t be played. What am I doing wrong? I am using 7Z to unrar it."
,jasperz0r,2011-02-04T17:20Z,"Downloading now, hope it works :D"
,pontusrud,2011-04-25T05:16Z,"OK...
I played a while and it got really hard. Then I rememberd: It´s an RPG, and I haven´t level´d up. 

How do I do that? I found the menu, but I can´t do anything there... :("
