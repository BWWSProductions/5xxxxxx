Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
Were a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We dont earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then dont hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.


twice the fun   / double the trouble

Large-scale battles have become a vestige of the past,
depleting resources of conflicting parties. Settled space,
where welfare and order had reigned, has become a cemetery for
dead ships which is flooded with pirates and adventurists.
Complete impunity, black market flourishing where gun and tech
trade is on the move, arbitrariness and anarchy - the Galaxy
has become a real dangerous place. Events in the Universe and
its habitants destiny are completely up to players choice
and tactical decisions.
