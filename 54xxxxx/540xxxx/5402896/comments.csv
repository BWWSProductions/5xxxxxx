,nathantruant,2010-03-02T04:54Z,"A: 7 V: 4  Very blurry, overly saturated, tilted, shaky, and  overall not very good.  The audio is pretty good, however.  It is watchable if you're too impatient to wait for a better copy.

Thanks for the upload though!  Nice effort."

,Nolan87,2010-03-02T20:16Z,Watched sample. was ok. so d/l torrent and it is complete shit screen is on an angle visual is even worse..lol 
,Nolan87,2010-03-02T20:18Z,nice try though GPB2008 
,cbath,2010-03-02T23:09Z,"If the camera was zoomed in a bit, this would be a fairly decent file. As it is, the image takes up only about a half of the screen. As others have noted, the image does move around and it's blurry at times. I watched this on my TV, and using the zoom function, it was okay.

Download the sample first. If you don't like how it looks, move on and don't bitch about it. Thanks to GPB for contributing."
,killergreen420,2010-03-03T00:59Z,everybody if you dl you should seed.PPPPPPPPlease seed

,whitepony1989,2010-03-03T18:43Z,"just watched this. is definitely not horrible. its not great, but its FREE! good movie!"
,PathOfWar,2010-03-04T05:41Z,"V/3 A/3

Camera guy is constantly fidgeting and moving the camera around or blocking it with some part of his body but it never occurs to him to zoom 4x. Most of it is film slanted (about 70ì§¸) from the back row.

The movie itself pretty much matched the quality of this CAM."
,jeff-ffej,2010-03-06T03:48Z,"@Nolan87,cant you fukin read ,just look at the comments,GIVE THE GEEZA A BREAK u whingin bitch"
,anthonysanders,2010-03-07T23:32Z,"I have a question. 
it's something I can't figure out. 


How come when I find a movie and everyone says that it's a great copy, and such, it always has like more than 10 files sometimes up to 170 files, and when I download it, and it is complete I open my download folder, and there are ALL of the files right there in WinRAR. 

Am I doing something wrong? 
I just want everything in one file, so All I have to do is double click the movie, and it will play. 


Please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
