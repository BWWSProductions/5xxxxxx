,goddreaming,2010-04-01T01:33Z,Very very nice! Could you give me a list of some good trance torrents? I've been getting a lot of 3rd rate stuff lately and yours is 1st rate.
,PetreckMusic,2010-04-15T18:53Z,"Thank you and sorry for such delayed reply. I do put a lot effort for my mixes to sound good and as professional as possible and I think I'm getting better and better at it. And regarding your question - I make these mixes because I can't find mixes that I'd like to listen to - uplifting, melodic and embracing wide spectrum of genres. You'd want to look for compilation CDs such as Gatecrasher or Godskitchen. I personally recommend Gatecrasher Classics 2 lots of classic tunes, also Sensation White 2002, Tiesto's Nyana (2003) (though you might not like tiesto, it is an amazing compilation) and google up sets from A State Of Trance 400 (Daniel Kandi, Duderstadt, Above & Beyond etc.) and AfterHours End Of Year Countdown).
P.S.: I'm finishing my new mix spring 2010, should be up in a week or so."
