,honkenill,2010-03-03T20:31Z,Can I play multiplayer with this one?
,honkenill,2010-03-03T20:34Z,"And the game only taks 4,48gig when installed, so this is probably fine."
,cncmasterw,2010-03-04T01:59Z,what is missing from this? because looking at STEAM. the game is 4-5 gigs. so i think this is real.
,NanoEntity,2010-03-04T05:17Z,"If you wander why its so big/not big, because Razor Crack is 3GB on the ISO CD, this has all the fixes combined, that's why teh size is smaller then the original."
,Sharon3,2010-03-04T14:17Z,"Does the HOST works i Downloaded the Razors iso file, but i cant play the Skrimish mode and cant host game.???"
,ice02,2010-03-05T06:48Z,Is this release in english....coz the installer screen has some other language????
,Syteri,2010-03-05T11:08Z,Does this work? Is it in english?
,Zakafein,2010-03-05T15:42Z,"the size is alright, but im still only 20% done dling.  so slow seeders...  I'm guessing that it's in english, ill reply when im done (could take a while at this rate)"
,WOLFAKIA17,2010-03-06T09:42Z,"works ok, just one question. How you change name?"

,ice02,2010-03-06T16:43Z,"Hey WOLFAKIA17

,Lordeseis,2010-03-08T01:19Z,"It works perfectly and the game language is english(only) for those who cannot read the description above.
Thx for this Thenoobish."
,pyao,2010-03-10T16:54Z,"Need some help. Ran ""Supreme Commander 2.exe"". Installer w/ unreadable language came up. Kept on clicking what I assumed to be ""next"". Finished the install, but the program crashes every time I run it"
,pyao,2010-03-10T17:44Z,"My mistake, seems my video card does not support Hardware T&L."
,jezebel420,2010-03-12T05:29Z,"hopefully this one works, the TPTB one didnt seem to wanna work, it was like i was installing air to my hard drive, and the razor one didnt work for shit"
,fleetkid,2010-03-12T16:14Z,"Thanks a lot thenoobish.

Guys, the game is English. Only the installer seems to be of a different language. Took a while to download thanks to the ****in leeches. Game works perfectly fine :) 

Will definitely upload for a while."
,lukyboy99,2010-03-20T11:59Z,"i have downloaded it, it's great!
just run the setup.

I have also the torrent sc2 from razor1911. but that didn't work for me

i advice this torrent!"
,R3mors3,2010-03-23T00:10Z,So yeah the name thing is kind of annoying. I get that razor 1911 wants acknowledgement for their excellent cracks (hence the reason I keep coming back to them) but branding their name into the game doesnt help
,-kamikurosu-,2010-03-29T23:22Z,guys...in the installation thing im having a error can someone explain me why?
,Ganjoneous,2010-04-05T15:36Z,Will this let me enter a profile name? Because Razor's release of SP2 doesn't let you change the profile name from his. It bugs the hell out of me. if this one does then i will seed for a couple weeks.
,T221WA,2010-04-06T12:08Z,Can't get MP hosting to work :-/ What to do??
,ajaichohan,2010-04-15T10:42Z,"Easy install, worked fine.

,Klooski,2010-06-13T18:26Z,"Colors are messed up, how do I fix them? I run on Vista x32"
,delsol0000,2010-06-15T14:09Z,dont upload shit like this again. Doesn't work properly - missing SC2_Vo. Nextime repack it better u tard. 
,JackDupier,2010-06-15T20:46Z,"Worked perfectly for me, so maybe it's not him thats the ""tard"". Food for thought."
,goo79,2010-07-05T20:58Z,"well not sure what happened. I installed, played fine for a couple skirmish games, then when I went to play again a few hours later, it won't start. I can get into game and select map and computer players but game crashes on map load. wtf?"
,jarooko,2010-08-26T11:26Z,"Good day to all.

I tried to DL a couple of releases for Supreme Commander 2, and non of them worked. If anybody can't make it work with one release, this is what I have done to make the game work:

1) DL-ed Razor1911 release, in which, for me, the Razor 1911 installer didn't work, reporting an error ""Cannot open AVI"" (hell if I know what it means);

2) DL-ed the Supreme Commander 2 [PC] [Full Repack] release, which crashed my commuter on run every time;

3) Installed the game with the [Full Repack] release, and then used the Razor1911 crack from the mounted image, and Razor1911 crackfix, and the game finally worked!

And is still working, like a charm.

If anybody has the problem of not making any release work on it's own, this is the only way I know how to make the game work; combine the releases.

Hope it helps."

,timsta1,2011-01-28T10:28Z,Is there a way to play multiplayer with this download?
,roger_bf,2011-02-14T14:35Z,"Worked well here, thank you man!"
,Kamori,2011-03-20T04:15Z,"Worked great. Install is easy, even in other languages, if you have common sense to click where ""Next"" SHOULD be.

Played through the entire campaign and some skirmishes, no crashing (Windows 7 Ultimat x32). Would be great to have multiplayers, though ^^."
,bizmark2000,2011-04-05T15:15Z,"Supreme Commander 2 v1.250 Definitive edition = http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6237979/Supreme_Commander_2_v1.250_Definitive_edition

JUST INSTALL AND PLAY- that Simple, its already cracked and patched.

This game is currently Working, Checked and Tested it. And it works Fine, even better then fine, no buggs at all.

Several things you need to remember:
The installation is so easy that it doesn't need a guide. Just read what it's asking you and press next. It's that easy.

Here are the steeps for really NUUB people.
- First step Install Steam and make an account. then Logoff from steam when installing this crack.
- Mount game
- Choose Language
- If it asks, install Net frame If it doesn't skip this step.
- Tic to install DirectX, Visual C++ and SmartSteam
- Choose Steam Version ( Online Multiplayer ) To play ONLINE.
- When you get the Windows Command (window) do not close until you se the text that it's done and press any key to close. ( The installation is slow so be be patient )
- Mini window will pop up and ask you to choose language. Choose language and close it.
- When the installation is done.
Start (SmartSteam) then to start the game go to Star - All programs - Supreme Commander 2 - And press on (Play.exe)

You are done now. and can play Online with others.

Spread the word ---- "
,xaowx,2011-04-23T22:51Z,"Works great.

For the noob people. 

(This is how I did it).

Run the application, let the game install. It installed on the c drive for me, not the program files. 

Then I got the cracks from razor and applied them.

Run game. 

FYI - I don't have a steam account and it works great."
,PhOeNiX56,2012-01-10T07:01Z,"Runs perfectly in W7 64x.
Just moved my mouse cursor over the install icon, double tapped the left mouse button twise, waited for about 1,2 min. (Enough to take a leak), then double tapped my left mouse button with mouse cursor over the Supreme Commander icon in my start menu. (Note. installed in a self-created folder on harddrive E: or C: or whatever)"
