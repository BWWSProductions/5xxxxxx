Key Features

Smarter Scanner Ã» Threats don't always enter your network in ways you expect. ESET NOD32 Antivirus inspects SSL-encrypted communication channels like HTTPS and POP3S and intelligently scans compressed files to find hidden threats other products miss. Proactive protection begins at the earliest point in system startup to ensure your computer is always secure.

Clean and Safe Email Ã» Email scanning for Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Mozilla Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail, Windows Mail, and other POP3/IMAP mail clients, ensuring your email is free of viruses and other threats.

Removable Media Security Ã» Threats can enter your PC from removable media such as USB thumb drives. For self-running media, ESET NOD32 Antivirus scans autorun.inf and associated files when the medium is inserted, in addition to scanning any file on any removable device when it is accessed, or during a full-scan of the media. Power users can adjust ESET NOD32 Antivirus to perform additional levels of scanning on removable media.

System Tools Ã» ESET SysInspector and ESET SysRescue simplify diagnosing and cleaning of infected systems by allowing deep scans of system processes to find hidden threats, and creating bootable rescue CD/DVD or USB drives to help you repair an infected computer.

Self Defense Ã» ESET NOD32 Antivirus has built-in technology to prevent malicious software from corrupting or disabling it, so you can rest assured your system is always protected.

                    Atomix Virtual DJ v6.0.2 Professional + Key



VirtualDJ is the hottest MP3 mixing software, targeting every DJ from bedroom DJs 
to professional superstars like Carl Cox. With its breakthrough BeatLock engine, 
your songs will always stay in the beat, and you can work your mixes incredibly 
faster than any other DJ could.

Atomix VirtualDJ features a breakthrough BeatLock engine that will keep your songs
in tune and let you work your mixes incredibly faster than any other DJ. 
The automatic seamless loop engine and the new synchronized sampler will let you 
perform astounding remixes on the fly. VirtualDJ is compatible with timecoded 
vinyls that let you scratch your MP3s directly on a real turntable, and with many 
other DJ equipment. 

You can use several interfaces to suit both beginners and professionals, record 
your mixes and burn them on CD, rip DVD, rip vinyl, create your own Internet 
radio, automatically mix playlists, use VST effects, display karaoke, and play 
DRMed file. The automatic seamless loop engine and the brand new synchronised 
sampler will let you perform astounding remixes live, with no preparation at all. 

The visual representation and the cues allow you to clearly see the songs 
structure, and never be surprised by a break anymore. The vinyl controls will let 
you scratch like on a real turntable, except that with the beatlock engine your 
scratches will never end out of the beat. Add to that an infinite number of cue 
points you can save for each songs, a bunch of wonderful effects automatically 
beat-synchronised.



Features:

  Create great mixes faster than ever!
* Automatic seamless loop: perform astounding remixes live with no preparation 
  at all!
* Synchronised sample machine: sample-and-play on the fly, and free your 
  creativity!

  and beatmatch)!
* DVD Ripping
* Vinyl Ripping
* Infinite cue points saved per song, lots of great effects which are beat aware, 
  recording and broadcasting options, and much more?



This new version of VirtualDJ brings many new and exciting features. It greatly 
enhances the core values which made VirtualDJ so popular: accessibility, 
versatility and cutting-edge technology.


* New script language

Because no two DJs are the same, we think that every DJ should have a custom-made, 
tailored software application. VirtualDJ 6 has been centered around a new language, 
called VDJscript, that really lets you take full control and full ownership of your
software, and tweak it to your perfect liking in a matter of minutes.

With VirtualDJ 6, all the commands used in skins, keyboard shortcuts, controllers'
mappings, etc, now use VDJscript.

VDJscript language has been designed to be both simple and complex, depending on 
how you will use it.

When used for your day to day needs, VDJscript is very simple, and look similar 
to the actions from VirtualDJ v5.x. You can write such commands as play, pause, 
crossfader 50%, etc.

But if you have more complex needs, VDJscript can turn into a full scripting 
language, complete with global variables, conditional branching, etc. You can 
write such commands as var $myvar ? pitch_range '10,16,50' : goto 400ms & loop 4 
while_pressed

See the full documentation on VDJscript on the wiki page.


* New controller support

In VirtualDJ 6, we changed the approach we had on external controllers. 
In VirtualDJ v5.x, and in many competitors software, the software was designed 
around a mouse-and-keyboard use, and as the market released new USB DJ controllers, 
they were added one by one as emulation of the keyboard.

With Version 6, the controllers are now at the center of the software, and the 
keyboard is seen as just another kind of controller.

Any controller, be it HID or MIDI, can now be used with VirtualDJ, and every 
buttons, jog wheels, sliders, LEDs, LCD displays, etc, can be assigned to 
VDJscript macros to make your controller react exactly as you want it to.

By default, VirtualDJ comes preinstalled with an impressive list of over 40 
different USB controllers, already fully mapped and ready to be used plug-and-play.

But if you have a controller that is not in the preinstalled list, you can easily 
create a "definition" file for it, using a simple XML syntax, for any HID or MIDI 
controller. Or, you can find on our website many user-submitted definition XMLs 
for almost every controller available on the market.


* NetSearch

Because the technicality of the mix is only half of DJing, VirtualDJ 6 puts a 
strong focus on the other half: playing the right track at the right moment.

Two new features are there to bring you the tools to make the best musical 
selection. NetSearch is one of these new tools. Whenever you are looking for a 
song but don't have it, NetSearch will automatically crawl the Internet to try to 
find the song you're looking for. You can then instantly stream the song or video 
directly off the Internet. You will never again have to turn down a request 
because you don't have it, or be frustrated because you can't find a file.

If you don't have an Internet connection where you are DJing, do not worry. 
You can search all the tracks you need at home where you have a connection, 
and cache all the songs on your local or external hard drive, then play them 
offline from your club.

The songs browsed by NetSearch are files which are freely available on the 
Internet, as found on promotional websites and free catalogs. That includes 
several millions of songs, mainstream music as well as underground tracks or 
specific remixes. Atomix Productions is also working with selected content 
providers to keep NetSearch catalog as extensive as possible.


* MusicGroups

Next is MusicGroups. MusicGroups is actually two features in one.

First, MusicGroups let you show to the world what music you play.

When you DJ with VirtualDJ, your playlist will automatically be sent, to your 
MusicGroup. Your friends and fans will be able to follow what you play, and vote 
for you or leave comments.

You can also get together with other DJs who have the same musical style as you, 
and try to create one of the best generic MusicGroup, and become a reference.

But the true power of MusicGroups lies in the feedbacks it will give you. While 
you are DJing with VirtualDJ, MusicGroups will constantly analyze what you are 
playing, and will make suggestions of what other DJs would have played next. 
The suggestion is based on what other DJs around the world play, with a stronger 
weight to the ones from the MusicGroups you subscribed to.

Unlike existing music matching solutions, MusicGroups suggestions are not based 
on automated music-likeness. MusicGroups gives you real advices, based on what 
millions of real DJs are playing every day in clubs.

You will find out that MusicGroups is a very good way to discover new tracks, 
and expend your sets.


* New Timecode Engine

For those of you who like the touch and feel of vinyls, you will love the new 
Timecode Engine of VirtualDJ 6. Rewritten from scratch, it brings a much better 
accuracy and responsiveness to timecodes.

The new Timecode Engine has been optimized with the traditional VirtualDJ v5 
records, but can now also run in noisemap mode, and bring VirtualDJ's myriad 
of features while still using competitors' timecode solutions.


* New skin engine

VirtualDJ 6 got rid of one of the annoying limitation of VirtualDJ v5: You can 
now resize your window on-the-fly, without worrying about which skin is in which 
resolution.

The Skin engine brings many new elements, like ScratchWaves, ResizeZones, etc.

See the wiki for more information on Skins.


* Improved video engine

More and more video codecs are now being played by the internal video decoder.

The video engine has also been optimized and is now 15% faster than in version 5.


* Unicode compatibility

VirtualDJ 6 is now fully Unicode compatible.

From USA to China, from France to Russia, all your files and songs written in 
foreign languages will now play and display flawlessly in VirtualDJ, both on PC 
and on Mac.


* Various improvements and bug fixes

Version 6 also brings a long list of small improvements and bug fixes, thanks 
to the reports and help of hundreds of users who helped us to make it the most 
flawless software we ever released.
