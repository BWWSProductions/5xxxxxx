All the season 2's I've tried to download are either in .mkv files or are of awful quality."

Seasons 2-5 play fine, good quality."

,dwils23,2010-06-11T08:13Z,Sound quality for me wasn't that good. Video quality was good though.
,IntheVineyard,2010-06-12T01:26Z,"Audio quality for 2 is terrible, the video isn't very good either.  If anyone finds a good Season 2 please let me know, I've been looking."
