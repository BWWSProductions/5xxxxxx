,syndre,2010-03-05T21:23Z,"I've uploaded a bit over 100gb on this torrent, I'm not going to seed this forever. When I watch people go from 99.9% up to 100% and then there is still only 1 seed an hour later, it makes me not want to keep making torrents. "

,chamber44,2011-01-14T16:14Z,Please don't get discouraged.  Maybe try to not upload so much into one torrent b/c ppl tend to just get what the want/need.
