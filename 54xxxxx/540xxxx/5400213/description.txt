From"HFOBG was initially composed of myself, Carolyn Klumpp (drums), Kevin McQuilkin (bass) and Mike McQuilkin (synthesizer). We started the band in 1992, and played some gigs at the Billerica club Edible Rex before breaking up and reforming with a different lineup... The lineup on this track includes myself (vocals, guitar), Jon Dyer (guitar), Carolyn Klumpp (drums) and Bob Wilson (bass).  TJS-510 was recorded in 1992 in Wilmington MA, by the fella who did sound for Edible Rex. He had a little studio called Kashmir where we recorded 5 tracks."
