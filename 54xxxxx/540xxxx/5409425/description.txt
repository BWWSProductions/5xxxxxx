Jacques Costeau tried. Pioneer dolphin researcher John Lilly said it couldn't be done. But in 1978 a ship of fools set out to swim in the open oceans with wild dolphins. Taking a cue from Aristotle, who said, "dolphins care for man and enjoy his music", the filmmakers played an 'underwater piano" and for three days interacted with a school of wild dolphins.

A "close encounters of the aquatic kind", this classic film documents the first recorded human-wild dolphin encounter in modern times.

Plus special feature short: The Wonder of Dolphins.

By Ken Lee:
A friend who knows I love dolphins gave me a copy of this video. The footage is old, and I have trouble with some of the talk about how happy the captive dolphins are. But as a historical snapshot of a past time in our ever-evolving beliefs about, attitude toward, and efforts to communicate with dolphins, this video is worth watching--especially the underwater footage of humans interacting with wild, friendly dolphins in the Bahamas. This footage comes like a gift at the end of the documentary, just as these encounters do to the people involved, and it's exquisite--enough to earn the film a place in any dolphin-lover's archive.
