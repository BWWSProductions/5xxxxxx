IF this man handles explosive materials in any fashion, it vital to be very far away.
Boring beyond belief."

Itâs been over 35 years since I first heard this man (live in the west midland). 
Still makes me laugh my head off.
But I donât think the humor travels well outside the UK.
Thanx again."
