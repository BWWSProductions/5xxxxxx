Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€œCoolâ€ uncles have always gotten kids into all kinds of wonderful mischief, but 22-year-old Peter Oâ€™Grady from London , better known as Joy Orbison, was especially blessedâ€”he credits uncle Ray Keith with introducing him to jungle and U.K. garage long before he could ever hit the clubs. At the age of 13 he took up DJing and eventually moved into production, beginning with Fruity Loops-crafted 8-bar grime loops before shifting into headier territory that combined his love of house, disco, and dubstep with the atmospheric fuzz of bands like My Bloody Valentine, Josef K, and The Beach Boys. His debut single â€œHyph Mngoâ€ has become the forward-thinking dubstep/2-step tune of 2009, and was followed by â€œBRKL CLLNâ€ on Oâ€™Gradyâ€™s own Doldrums label, which he runs in tandem with partner Impey."
