The story follows Alice Hamilton who suddenly finds herself on the other
Ã side of a looking glass in an outlandish city under the rule of the deliciously
Ã devilish Queen of Hearts (Oscar winner Kathy Bates). In Wonderland, kidnapped
Ã captives from our world have their memories erased and are held in a casino
Ã where everyone is always a winner. As they gamble, their extreme emotions of
Ã joy and excitement are drained, bottled and consumed by the citizens of
Ã Wonderland. When Aliceâ€™s new love, Jack Chase is kidnapped, Alice embarks on
Ã a desperate quest to find him. She enlists the help of Hatter, Dodo and the
Ã White Knight who help her navigate the daringly different, boldly colorful
Ã and delightfully skewed dreamscape of Wonderland.
