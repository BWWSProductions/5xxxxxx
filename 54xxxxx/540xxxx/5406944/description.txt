        Fight monsters and explore a medieval world. Aveyond is packed
        with more than 60 quests, hundreds of places to explore, and over
        30 hours of game play. If you like games like Final Fantasy,
        Chrono Trigger, and Dragon Warrior, you are going to love
        Aveyond.

        A powerful deity, Ahriman, has opened the Demon Portal and dark
        creatures now threaten the great isles. You must stop the
        destruction and destroy Ahriman before it is too late. The Sword
        of Shadows is the key to your redemption. You must find it in the
        mystical isle of Aveyond and use it to seal the Demon Portal and
        stop Ahriman.

        In addition to a great story, this award-winning game is packed
        with additional great features. Chase monsters around in
        real-time, and fight them in turn-based battles. Explore dozens
        of non-linear quests, marry off your characters, buy a mansion,
        pets, and more! 

         30+ Hours of gameplay
         60+ quests!
