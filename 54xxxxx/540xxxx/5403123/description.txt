THe torrent download might be slow because a lot of people would want to download this torrent, and my upload speed only goes up to 30kB. So be patient if you want to have this complete discography.
If there are no seeders, that simply means I'm offline. So don't worry because I will be seeding this for a long time.
Enjoy.

THANK YOU FOR ALL THE SEEDERS :)
