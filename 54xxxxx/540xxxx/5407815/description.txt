The Carpenters were a vocal and instrumental duo, consisting of siblings Karen and Richard Carpenter. Carpenters were the #1 selling American music act of the 1970s. Though often referred to by the public as "The Carpenters", the duo's official name on authorized recordings and press materials is simply "Carpenters",
without the definite article. (Wiki)


This is the Carpenters best-of collection (there are many) that gives the listener their strongest Top 10 songs in one flawless package. From the hopeful opener, "We've Only Just Begun," to the wistful closing track, "Close to You," these songs epitomize the band's lush and sincere style that won them so much adulation (and many awards) in the 1970s. Karen's passionate vocals take the listener on dizzying rides on "Hurting Each Other" and "Rainy Days and Mondays," and irresistibly pleasant ditties like "Top of the World" and "Sing" continue to rule the perfect-songs-for-the-car-radio kingdom.moreâ€¦ Their take on the Beatles "Ticket to Ride" is inoffensive if not agreeable, and weepy tunes like "It's Going to Take Some Time" and "Goodbye to Love" can still wring a sniffle out of the sensitive listener. This collection signifies an important period in the timeline of pop-music history. --Lorry Fleming
