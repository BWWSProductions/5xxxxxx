Ever wondered where your Mac's disk space has gone?

With DaisyDisk you can free up disk space by quickly finding and deleting big, useless files. The program scans any mounted disk and displays it on the sunburst map, where segments mean files and folders, proportionally to their sizes. The map is easy to read and navigate. You can also quickly preview any file and reveal it in Finder to delete.

Analyze disk usage
DaisyDisk uses sunburst visualization to display disk usage. It's easier to read and navigate than rectangular treemaps used in other products.

Fantastic interface 
Who said disk tools have to be ugly and tangled? We strived to make DaisyDisk both easy to use and visually appealing.
Get rid of disk space wasters 
Find a large file. Hit Space to preview its content. Right-click to reveal it in Finder. Delete the file. Done.

More than meets the eye 
We took care of numerous details to make your experience with DaisyDisk as smooth as possible. And there's more to come. 

Requirements: Mac OS X 10.5 or later.
