,andrugator,2011-01-28T14:55Z,"Thanks for upload, this is more useful than public NIH (i suppose?) free version of 4th edition.
But you know what? 4th edition you can buy at amazon for as low as 40$ and that is the price every student, going into MCB could pay. Other question is shipping around the world, but there is no ""too high price for buying"" reason. Good books afford any price.
I have my 4th edition as home-basis preparation material and it is much better than computer version (yah, i like paper and hate trees too) and this will be portable copy."
,Dragonite_9,2011-02-21T17:18Z,"Thank you alot!

You or anyone else does not happen to have the book ""The World of the Cell"" ?

Really need that book, can't afford to buy it as a poor student :-/

I hope this one could be a good substitute for that one otherwise, anyone know if they are pretty much the same?

Thank you in advance!

Best regards!"
