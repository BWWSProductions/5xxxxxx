,Adamfromky,2012-01-07T18:53Z,"I don't know if this has happened to anyone else, but when I try to run the game in ePSXe, the battle menu only shows a tiny rectangle in the middle.  I can't see any of my HP or MP, and the only way I know what attacks I am using is by reading the description once I hit the select button.

Anyone know what could cause this?  Thanks in advance, and otherwise a good torrent."
