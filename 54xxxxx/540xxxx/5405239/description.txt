Description: Age of Empires returns to the screens of our monitors! But how is returned: pathos, majestic, beautiful. I think in the world, there is no lover of computer games who never heard about Age of Empires. And much fans strategies and do consider it a game, thanks to which this genre is developing by leaps and bounds. After that first game, the second (The Age of Kings, if anyone forgot) set new standards in gameplay strategies, and in the schedule, and the musical design. Age of Empires 3 is no exception. Believe me, this actually still have not seen. Yes, there were many beautiful policies, yes, there were many clever strategies, yes, were amusing strategy, but Age of Empires 3 rises above all.
