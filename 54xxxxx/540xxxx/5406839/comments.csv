,poincy,2010-03-03T15:18Z,Do these have hard-coded subs for the non-english parts? Thanks for the great up!
,lovefreeshit_09,2010-03-03T16:28Z,"Yes, all of the Klingon and Vulcan, etc, is hard coded, np."
,lovefreeshit_09,2010-03-03T16:29Z,"BTW, sorry for the slow speed, blame my ISP."
,poincy,2010-03-03T16:33Z,"Great! Thanks for the quick answer, even if the speed isn't all that quick yet ;)"

,mike18xx,2010-10-21T22:01Z,"Nemesis is only 20fps...wtf?

You decimated out a sixth of the movie."
,lovefreeshit_09,2010-10-30T20:36Z,"I retained the ORIGINAL frame rate on Nemesis just like I did on the other 9 movies, bitch to paramount, or just stop bitching and take what you get since it's free, that would be great."
,Philonetic,2011-03-06T00:44Z,"right, so the audio is shite on VLC and WMP.
nice try but besides the subtitles which are easily found BONEs version is better.
Don't give up tho, but try uploading something that isn't already up with more seeds k? that would be great."
,pauliep,2011-03-06T14:18Z,"Did not have hard coded subs for Klingon, and also...whats up with the beginning? Its about 2 minutes of flying through space, then the movie starts..every subtitle Ive downloaded is for the one without that...i know iknow..everyones gonna tell me to adjust them in VLC...but its 2 minutes off...are their any subs available for these versions?"
,pauliep,2011-03-06T14:49Z,Sorry....meant it DID have Klingon hard coded subs
,xanhellx,2011-04-17T19:53Z,"-Thanks for the hard work man, i really appreciate it :D"
,azvampyre,2012-01-01T08:50Z,"Only viewable on PC. Don't bother trying to stream to Xbox 360 or PS3 until you spend 12 hours re-encoding the VBR to FBR.
Bones files are better."
