        Entertaining fly-on-the-wall show revealing what happens     
        when injured British holidaymakers swap sun-loungers for     
        hospital beds in Mallorca. Hospital interpreters Viv and     
        Shellie have a fight on their hands when an operation to     
        repair a badly fractured arm is threatened by obstructive    
        holiday insurers. A tourist faces emergency treatment after  
        a dive into the sea goes badly wrong.
