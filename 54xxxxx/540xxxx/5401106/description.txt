    Director Christopher Hines paints an intimate portrait of 
    contemporary gay culture by asking pointed questions and 
    studying the diverse lifestyles of its members, with the 
    resulting film offering a fresh look at masculinity and 
    homosexuality. Interviewing gay men ranging from rugby 
    players to rodeo stars, Hines also talks to historians, 
    psychologists and sociologists to help identify the similarities 
    in the way gay men view themselves.
