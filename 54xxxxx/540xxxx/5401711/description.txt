 RELEASE NOTES:                                                             
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                              
 Powerful, fast, and easy to use video conversion for AVI, MPEG-1, MPEG-2,  
 WMV, MOV, Flash (SWF and SWF), iPod, PSP, 3GP, and other various video     
 formats. Blaze Video Converter MAX makes conversions for all popular video 
 formats a quick and easy task. Settings are provided for video and audio   
 bitrate, output dimensions, start/end processing time, image header, video 
 rotation, overwrite protection, and more. Convert from AVI, MPG (MPEG-1    
 and MPEG-2), WMV, ASF, MOV, FLV, 3GP, MP4, DivX, OGM, PSP, and iPod to     
 AVI, MPG (MPEG-1 and MPEG-2), WMV, MOV, FLV, 3GP, PSP, and iPod with ease. 
 Blaze Video Converter MAX can also be used to change the compression for   
 supported formats. The comprehensive range of supported formats makes the  
 software very flexible, and provides a complete solution for conversion of 
 most any video file desired. Conversions are performed directly from       
 format to format, which increases conversion speed and eliminates          
 potential quality loss. The ability to set codec and/or compression        
 settings for all formats that support them is also present.                
                                                                            
 Blaze Video Converter MAX offers an extensive array of options for         
 complete control over how the software functions. The software is fully    
 functional and can be utilized easily by users of any experience level.    
                                                                            
 Conversions can be performed on an entire folder of files simply by using  
 the Add Folder option. Furthermore, when converting a folder, you can      
 specify an option for all subfolders to also be included. Additional       
 built-in options include: the ability to automatically use the source      
 file's path for conversion output, overwrite protection (append unique     
 numeric value to the base filename for existing files), deletion of source 
 file(s) after successful conversion, and much more!
