The band also garnered a small amount of media attention as the liner notes of this album contained a picture of an airplane and the text "This Plane Will Crash Tomorrow". A rumor circulated that the album was released on September 10, 2001, the day before the September 11, 2001 attacks, but this is untrue. According to Amazon.com, the album was officially released September 4, 2001, exactly one week before the attacks. An interview with Stylus Magazine claims the album was available as early as August 24, 2001. Members of the band told Stylus that they had the artwork and idea for the liner notes for over a year before the attacks on the World Trade Center.
The track "Have You Passed Through This Night?" is one of the first Explosions in the Sky songs to contain any words: a sample from the film The Thin Red Line.
The track title "With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept" was used as an episode title for a landmark episode of Season 3 of the television show One Tree Hill.
The artwork for the album, by David Logan, was inspired by The Angel of Mons.
