,Sicrea,2011-11-17T16:56Z,"As witten is for instaling from a HDD but it can be installed from USB formated for  xbox too, just make shure the first zero string is 16 ""0"" length and the innnermost  dir is  renamed to ""00000002"" (different number of ""0""). must be injected in  the ""content"" folder

Then just plug the USB into the Xbox 360. Works like a charm, Thanks"
