[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-03-06T18:00Z,"We are 90% seeded everyone! uTorrent update: 382 Leechers! Haha, sweet."
[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-03-07T09:35Z,"Thanks for all the +'s with no comments guys. Thanks a bunch. Although, thank you for seeding cuz that is always welcomed."
,BULLDOG_VIII,2010-03-09T23:34Z,"You are an actual genius.
Mine is still downloading at the moment.
but hoping it won't take to long.
Been a serious fan for as long as I can remember, and this has just blown my mind. 
thanks for your consideration to other fans.
how the fuck did you actually get all of these in the first place?"
[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-03-11T04:07Z,"Well, I searched long and hard on the internet and it took me forever because most of the files were FLAC and that just makes the file size even more amazingly HUGE. But it really did take a long time and I'm glad that you'll get to experience it! And hope it does come quick! Let me know Leechers if additional seeding is required. Over 1500 leechers on uTorrent the other day. Hope this makes a lot of fans/people smile!"
,manz88,2010-03-16T03:23Z,"Hi dude! It is AMAZING what you're doing here! Im really excited about this... I am downloading the torrent, but there's only one seeder, can you do something about it? cause it's gonna take forever haha...
I have 4 Ray's solo albums and two from Krieger if you wanna get them into the torrent or just having them for yourself.

Thnx!"
[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-03-17T19:12Z,"Well, a true fan will wait for it all. And I'll look into the albums you suggested. Thanks.

,StereoHead,2010-05-18T11:21Z,You just made my year!! Thank you so much!! hugs&kisses to the fellow Doors fan who made this possible :D :D :D :D
,slowhandfan,2010-08-15T15:05Z,"Jugz, thx for your hard work to put this together for us Doors freaks. Saw them in Chicago in 1968 on my 11th birthday. My bro took me and my mom worried I'd be corrupted and never again be her sweet daughter.  She was right! Long live Mr. Mojo Risin! (anagram of Jim Morrison.)"
,NoCode0680,2010-08-16T03:20Z,"Hey Jugz, great torrent, lots of really hard to find stuff in here.  I just wanted to tell you that I noticed a track that had a skip in it.  It was on Full Circle, I'm not for certain which song but I think it was Get Up And Dance.  Other than that everything is great though."
[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-09-02T18:43Z,Thanks for pointing that out. I'll see what I can do about that.
