,sunny2008,2010-03-05T09:08Z,"Hi Sailo1, I look forward to your BluRay ripped DVDRs that play perfectly on my dvd players. The quality is good too, however, lately I feel that they could be better if you removed the director's commentary as well. It takes a few 100 mbs, which could be utilised in improving the picture quality instead. Will be thankful if you could implement this soon. Thankyou. "
