Since 1974, Lazaris has channeled through Jach Pursel, his only channel, offering his friendship and love and generating a remarkable body of tools, techniques, processes, and pathways for our Spiritual Journey to God/Goddess/All That Is.


"We are here to remind you that pain and fear are not the only methods of growth; that you can more elegantly grow through joy and love. . . that you create your own reality . . . that there is a God/Goddess/All That Is who loves you, who knows your name. . . and that you love good enough"   â€”  Lazaris

Passion's Secret: The Mystery and Magic of Boundless Love 

â€œPassionâ€˜s fire can consume you, but it can also illuminate and then forge the truer, more real self. Its juices can drown you, but they also buoy you up and nourish and nurture you. Passionâ€˜s secret: With it you can hear the music with greater clarity and purity. You can hear the music and respond with greater resolve: will, imagination, and love. Your magic can be more vibrant as well as more powerful.â€ (Lazaris)

During this delightful evening, Lazaris elegantly reviews the true nature of passion and then guides us into the mystery of boundless love and then onward to uncover a step-by-step process for harnessing this transcendent expression of love: Pause/Reflect; Engage Will/Action; Engage Imagination/Feeling; and Understanding/Meaning - Perception/Conception. 

In an enchanting meditation we can awaken our passion once again and we can stir the energies and forces of boundless love. We can be the beneficiaries of its mystery and of its magic.
