,Lord-Darkstorn,2010-03-06T03:43Z,"Quality's amazing as always, but the movie is kind of lame. The social commentary kind of falls flat - they could have been much more critical of the war, IMO.

@buxtona-
A lot of those movies haven't even come out on Blu-Ray yet. Soon, though (one can hope...)"
,Skip2012,2010-03-10T07:44Z,ya and alot of those movies have been done already 
,Please_wait...,2010-03-12T03:12Z,"My players (Gom Player, Nero Showtime, Media Player Classic) stop responding and stops video playback at 00h:44min. I think my download got corrupted or maybe the upload is.
I enjoyed very much the first 44 minutes of this movie to my frustration.

I will try suggested players. Hope they work."
