NOTE: Today's episode of A. Idol is too big (XviD is 700MB) and by that unsuitable for many people... especially for the people with bandwidth limitations, as people who requested small-sized AI three weeks back and I turned them down. As I've said back then, my "as usual" 720p re-encodes of AI and other live shows always turns bad. Hence, this is XviD re-encode for the people willing to take trade-offs.
