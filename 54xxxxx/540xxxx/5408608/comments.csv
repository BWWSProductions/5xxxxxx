,phinot,2010-03-04T16:16Z,Pretty sure this is a fake! The only albums outside Depeche Mode are Hourglass and Papare Monsters (dave gahan) and the two parts of Counterfeit (Martin Gore). Apart from that is the work of Recoil (Alan Wilder). So... what the fuck are you uploading in the name of Depeche Mode???

,phinot,2010-03-05T17:11Z,"Yes, that's true. I will never understand why people do things like this. 
He's not seeding because he has not anything new at all. 
Go hell!"
