I lose every day too.

Her IP wasn't that hard to get. It wasn't used for anything malicious either; I just needed final confirmation before releasing any info in case it was a coincidence, as that would be really lame.

Anon is what you make of it. This was just a one-man raid that has long since been overshadowed by bringing TheYoungTurks to its knees... and that was very malicious! I'm pretty sure Ana Kasparian literally shit herself, lulz.

Thanks for the uploads!

Also, The Game."
,BarrySoetoro,2010-03-02T23:58Z,"Ooh, extras! Thanks, man.

VLC is great, but there's a free media player called ""The KMPlayer"" that plays anything I throw at it- OGG, FLV, WMV, MP4... tons of preferences, too.

Spill it!

Oh and BTW, TheYoungTurks lives on it's (his) knees."
[T],Quazza,2010-03-03T02:16Z,I use KMPlayer myself...VLC is a lot more user friendly though.
,r3vo_lt,2010-03-03T05:57Z,"Thanks a lot man, now if only we can find somebody who can upload the TV show every day."
,joeshmuck,2010-03-03T17:26Z,"What is this ""game"" you speak of?
And who is this incontinent ""Ana Kasparian""."
,joeshmuck,2010-03-03T17:28Z,"@r3vo_lt

I up the tv show at torrentzap and kickasstorrents."
