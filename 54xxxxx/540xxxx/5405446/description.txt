NOTE: 
I do not take any credit for anything except for putting all of this into a pack.

This is an easy install of Halo Custom Edition...Just install.
Find where Halo was installed and copy the maps into the "Map" folder in the Halo directory.  Usually it is located at:

C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft GamesHalo Custom Edition

                        or

C:Program FilesMicrosoft GamesHalo Custom Edition

Have fun...

My personal favorite map is Yoyorast Island V2

MULTIPLAYER WORKS!! 

PLEASE SEED! OR I'll STOP SEEDING...
