,countkurt,2010-03-04T07:42Z,"The reason being: 
""This film was completed in 2007 and was set for a Febuary 2008 wide release in theaters. But due to Yari Film Group (the film's distributor) filing a Chapter 11 protection (Bankruptcy Code), its release has been pushed back close to a dozen times and was then finally given a straight-to-DVD March 2010 release in the United States."""

,whatnow2009,2010-03-04T15:29Z,"Here is an important tip for everyone: 

Never watch a movie where the description beginns with.

""A woman's life is thrown into chaos after"" 

It will be sickening drama romantic crapp that will make you puke.

Only agree to watch such crap if it is guaranteed it wil get you laid right afterwords, if not stay well clear..."

,Phatfish,2010-03-11T02:43Z,"LOL, these comments amused me.
I will contribute! 

@countkurt:

It's: ""release has been pushed forward""
NOT: ""release has been pushed back""

Anyway...

V - 9

A - 9

M - Well, you sort of figure out where it's all going after only about 16 min. Watchable though I guess...

,serellie,2010-07-08T07:01Z,I strongly recommend you stop watching this movie with 30 minutes to go and search out the alternate ending. It makes the film a more unifying and satisfying experience.
