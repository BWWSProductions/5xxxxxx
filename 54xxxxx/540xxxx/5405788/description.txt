Synopsis: Sarah Michelle Gellar stars in this eerie mystery thriller as Jessica, a young woman whose nearly perfect marriage with Ryan (Michael Landes, FINAL DESTINATION 2) is marred only by the regular interference of Ryanâ€™s reckless and self-absorbed brother, Roman (Lee Pace of THE FALL and TVâ€™s PUSHING DAISIES). Jessicaâ€™s world comes crashing down when both her husband and brother-in-law get into a devastating car crash and fall into comas. But when only the difficult Roman wakes up, he claims to actually be Ryan. In fact, he knows things about Jessica that Roman couldnâ€™t possibly know. Now Jessica must expose the truth: can souls move between bodies? Or is this phenomenon the work of a much more sinister force? POSSESSION is a gripping tale of romance and mistrust in the mend-bending tradition of BIRTH and VANILLA SKY.
