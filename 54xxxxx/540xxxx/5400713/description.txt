Southern Californiaâ€™s hottest rising surf/rock/reggae band, THE B FOUNDATION draw influence from reggae rhythms, teen angst, and the salty waves of the Pacific Ocean. With three albums under their belt and a growing nationwide fan base, THE B FOUNDATION stand to gain more ground with the release of their highly anticipated third studio album â€œSouvenirs Novelties and Party Tricks.â€

THE B FOUNDATION are touring machines performing upwards of 200 dates annually. In the fall of 2008, the guys were invited to open for indie giant SLIGHTLY STOOPID playing 1,000 to 2,500 capacity rooms from coast to coast after a nationwide co headlining summer Surf Roots Tour with Ballyhoo!. THE B not only tour the states but are also fostering a growing international following touring in Japan playing a string of 12 sold out shows their last visit and an European touring slated for 2010.

THE B FOUNDATIONâ€™S albums are continuing to receive great reception and with the release of The Pier.orgâ€™s 4 anticipated release for 2009,â€œSouvenirs, Novelties and Party Tricksâ€, the sky is the limit. THE B has not relied on label support to move records but rather their D.I.Y. mentality, a direct connection with their fans, and word of mouth that always accompanies good music. This mentality has seen the band sell over 20,000 units with sales still pouring in from the release of their newest LP.

â€œSouvenirs Novelties and Party Tricksâ€ is the strongest album to date for the band, and they are starting to reap the rewards for their hard work. After the first day of sales on Itunes THE B FOUNDATION were the 2 downloaded artist in the reggae genre and also the pick of the month. College and commercial radio stations across the country are picking up the album organically. In Los Angeles, KROQ features the single from the LP â€˜Too Damn Toughâ€™ weekly on Kat Corbettâ€™s Locals Only show. Indie 103.1 plays â€˜Spliffedâ€™ on Native Wayneâ€™s Reggae Smoke-In and KROQ also featured â€˜Spliffedâ€™ on their Locals Only CD with 10,000 copies given out on the Vans Warped Tour and other events. THE B have participated in countless on-air interviews and live performances including KROQ, Sync Live, KJEE Santa Barbara, ThePier.org, Flashrock.com, Marijuana Radio, Seacrets Irie radio and a special acoustic performance at the Moboogie Loft.

The music is being featured in all types of multi-media including Bud Light using â€˜Rinconâ€™ in their commercial for the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing, â€˜Dirty Girlsâ€™ on Margarita Wrestling/Ampâ€™d Mobile cell phones, â€˜Say It in Sinâ€™ on Body Gloveâ€™s GPS Japan DVD, compilations such as Sense Boardwearâ€™s â€˜Poetry in Motion,â€™ One Big Family (Japan), Forever Free: A Tribute to Sublime, Resin Musicâ€™s Surf Roots 2 Benefit for the USA Surf Team, â€˜Be Alrightâ€™ music video in the Surf Roots DVD and an previously unreleased track â€˜Timeâ€™ featured on The Pier Comp One.

The stage is where THE B FOUNDATION truly shine, packed with an insane high-energy show and musicianship to keep all interested. THE B has become known as the go-to band for good time party vibes! For this reason SWAT tapped them to play their El Nino Winter Trip on Dec.21st in Lake Tahoe for over 1,000 high schoolers along with Rebelution & the Dirty Heads. THE B also played SWATâ€™s college Spring Break in San Felipe, Mexico last March, as well as events such as the KROQ Microbrew Fest at Santa Anita Race Track, the KROQ stage of the N.H.R.A. World Finals at Pomona Raceway, Float the Boat on the Queen Mary with Pepper, Bank of the West Beach Games/US Open of Surfing as well as the Vans Warped Tour. THE B FOUNDATON calls their musical style â€œkick-assâ€ and thatâ€™s exactly what the band is doing!
