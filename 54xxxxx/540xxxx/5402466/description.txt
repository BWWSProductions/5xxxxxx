The Honour of the Knights is a creative commons licensed science fiction novel, by Stephen J Sweeney.

What was far more disturbing was the amount of information he wasn't being given...

Across the other side of the known universe a terrible fate had befallen a once glorious imperial nation; a fate that dozens of governments throughout the galaxy were keen to keep secret for as long as possible.

But the danger was growing, and only a few months after his return Dodds would find his world, along with that of his old wingmates, flipped on its head. Very soon the five pilots would come face to face with that which destroyed an empire: an unforgiving, unstoppable, and totally unrelenting foe.
