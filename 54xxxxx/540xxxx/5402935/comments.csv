,BJDarter,2010-10-21T10:40Z,"Zerane already posted that all episodes of Season 8 are hard subbed in Swedish. I found out the hard way that Season 2 is also hard subbed in Swedish. While I do appreciate the uploader's effort greatly, I do wish I'd known in advance those two seasons are hard subbed. Pretty good quality overall otherwise. Thanks straffkungen. "

,dip10520,2011-07-22T14:31Z,thanks a lot
,nikki14izzy,2011-08-17T09:13Z,"I thought it was nice that somone put the effort into putting 9 seasons together but i wouldnt recomend downloading it, at lest 1 episode per season dosnt work, isnt there, or the voice isnt in synce plus more then one of the seasons have subtitles. I'll be redownloading from another source and probly will never go through this person again"
,Rock_King22,2012-05-11T06:23Z,"Thank you for the upload. I love the Absolute Justice episode, but why are episodes s9e11 and s9e12 both 700 mbs? I believe episodes 11 & 12 from Season 9 were aired as a 90 minute episode.
These are TVRips, not DVDRips. 350 MBs is too small for an episode to be a DVDRip."
