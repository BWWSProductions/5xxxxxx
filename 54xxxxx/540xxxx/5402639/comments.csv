,goldsilentmac,2010-05-25T16:37Z,"Hopefully everyone has figured this out that has had this problem, but when trying to install the expansion and it asks for the play disc, just mount the Diablo 2 play disc and it should install."
,smeegy,2010-05-26T02:16Z,It asks for an install CD but I can't find it.
,mit40,2010-05-26T09:27Z,I installed one of the patches and then it stopped asking for the CD.  The patches are hidden in the nodvd file.  Appropriate name I guess.

+1 for ya"
,suckbox554,2010-08-02T11:14Z,"Mounted with Alcohol 120%

Installed fine.

Every once in a while the buttons would crash the custom install menu, just restart it from the ""my computer"" directory and you'll be fine.

Works good, One of Easiest installs for multiple disk games yet."
,ekzoekzo,2010-08-16T09:41Z,i know how to use daemon tools. but i have no idea why the stupid 'insert expansion disk'error keeps popping. i patched to 1.13. i did everything i could think of. i cant find the reason for this problem and that's what pisses me most
