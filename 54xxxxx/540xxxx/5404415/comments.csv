Great upload man, I'm sure there's tons of VJ's thanking you around the world.

I'm commenting cause Resolume 4 was just announced on the 1st September. Take a look: http://www.resolume.com/software/whatsnew.php

Man it would be great if you could get it for us out here! I mean, Resolume 3 was huge but this is definitely going to become the industry standard. This is like Photoshop for VJs!

Anyway, thanks again for the upload! Hope you can get it out!

Best,
R!"
