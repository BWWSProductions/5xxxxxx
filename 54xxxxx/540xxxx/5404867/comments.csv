,redtrooperX,2010-03-28T11:24Z,"It works perfectly thank you soo much!

ps: there is no error in this torrent like respawning with no weapon."
,TheOriginalDaniel,2010-04-29T16:29Z,"@redtrooperx are you sure??? im only getting this for the multiplayer and if you check the torrent files it has a ""allstars"" text file so that means its one of theres is there any way to fix that multiplayer problem in case it does happen?"
,Jujutsuboy,2010-12-30T23:40Z,"TheOriginalDaniel, I downloaded this to play online with some friends. I've never played this type of game before so I have no idea what I'm doing on it, but when I died, I respawned without any weapons so I think this does have the problem you mentioned. I'm gutted."
