how can i start dis?"
,josh839,2010-03-08T23:37Z,"Go install daemon tools and mount it with the virtual drive, or you could use img burn and burn the files to a CD and install and play that way. Either way is up to you and links to both programs are listed above."

If you run this program in Compatibility Mode (on a 32-bit system), it should run perfect."
,mishmatthews,2010-11-01T08:26Z,"I have vista and tried to open it with Daemon tools lite....and it comes up with error...why???, everytime I download a game off here, it wont open"
,DaytimeTelevision,2010-11-02T02:38Z,It won't let me mount.  I un-archieved the .bin file and I get a .bin.cpgz file that is not mountable.  Any suggestions?
,Alexander97,2010-11-07T12:01Z,"I downloaded it and i got a.cue and a .bin. I tried to mount the.cue with daemon tools, but nothing happens, the same way with.bin!"
,Pink_Rage,2011-04-23T00:56Z,Will this work with PowerISO mount? Just wondering...

,klampflm,2011-05-15T03:19Z,"when i download that, i get a .bin and a .cue file. Neither of them I can mount with demon tool. Burning on CD doesnt work either. Can you please help me out here?"
,SeanTaylor,2011-09-19T03:57Z,"This game works perfect on Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.

I mounted the cue file with: Daemon Tools Lite 4.41.3.0173

Ran the installer, waited for installation to complete.

Got a no-cd crack from gamecopyworld, put that into the game directory and voila loads perfectly :)"

Could you please do a step by step to help me and many others who are having similar problems. I'm going to keep trying and I will comment again telling people how to do it if I figure it out. Thanks and I look forward to playing this game."
