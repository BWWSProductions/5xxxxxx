This week on Money Talks we have a little fun with video games. We get two couples to have a dance, revolution shake off money talks style. Next we continue part of our road trip in Tallahassee where we get two girl friends to battle it out in a body slap off. Next we find a couple of ladies two make out and show us there tits. For the main event our crew takes over an aquatic pet store and has some fun with the customers. We have sharks and eels biting people, as well as girls eating live crabs and showing tities. Finally J mac cant take it anymore and finds a victim for his land shark. We have this cute little hunnie getting fucked and begging for more.
