    If you're like us, you have managed to create your own                
    mini-library of books, magazines, games, CDs, software titles, and    
    movies. It is difficult to sort through all of them to see which      
    ones you have on file, or to find where you last shelved a            
    particular one. Librarian Pro is a complete personal inventory        
    system!                                                               
                                                                          
    Organize items into smart collections, add them to the in-program     
    Amazon shopping cart, mark them as lent out to friends, and even      
    export for the web or your iPod! Librarian Pro also supports          
    importing from other cataloging applications like Delicious           
    Library and DVDpedia.                                                 
                                                                          
    Search for items in-program on Amazon by author, artist, title,       
    and keyword. Details will automatically fill into new items -         
    including product images! Additionally, up to five Amazon reviews     
    are also retrieved for your reading pleasure. Afterward, even add     
    your own reviews!                                                     
                                                                          
    Librarian Pro's databases are fully compatible with both the Mac      
    OS X and Windows versions. Additionally, one license will grant       
    activation for both copies of the application. Download the free      
    fifteen day trial and have serenity return to your media

    1. Make sure you're offline or use a firewall to block the           
      application from connecting to the internet. This is the only      
       way to gain access to offline activation.                         
                                                                         
    2. Select "Activate Product" from the main menu or when you're       
       given the option upon running the program for the first time.     
                                                                         
    3. Select "Activate this product now" and enter anything into the    
       buyer's email edit box.  This email is never used in display      
       or for registering, so it can be anything. Press                  
      Continue/Activate button.                                          
                                                                         
    4. Next it will give you a dialog to activate offline, press "Yes"   
       button.  Now, for the buyer email enter in what you want to       
       display as registered user.  Press "Next Step" button.            
                                                                         
    5. Copy the "Challenge Code" into our keygen to generate a valid     
       "Answer".  Press "Next Step" button.  Enter in "Challenge         
      Answer", press "Activate" and you're done.                         
                                                                         
    6. After this, the application can connect to internet and will      
       stay registered as far as we can tell (maybe the protection       
       will change in the future, who knows...).                         
                                                                         
                                                                         
                                                                         
                          ..: iMPORTANT NOTE :..                         
                                                                         
      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      
      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!      
                                                                         
                                   else
