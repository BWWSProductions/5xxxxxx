Use military-grade procedures to surgically remove all traces of any file.

BCWipeTM data wiping software enables you to permanently delete selected files so that they can never be recovered or undeleted. BCWipe embeds itself within Windows and can be activated from the Explorer FILE Menu OR from the context (right-click) menu OR from BCWipe Task Manager OR from a command-line prompt. BCWipe complies with U.S. Department of Defense (DoD 5220.22-M) standard, U.S. Department of Energy (DoE M 205.1-2) standard and a set of other standard wiping schemes. You can also create and use your own customized wiping scheme to wipe sensitive information from storage devices installed on your computer.
