I downloaded it and when I unzipped my AV came up with 3 different pop ups about a virus trying to install.. and I hadn't even started to install anything yet. So I checked out some of 2mean2die's other torrents and some of them have people shouting virus too. I can't be sure but I think this is a no good torrent. I know that a keygen creator could be flagged by AV software by mistake. Downloading the file from jetico's website for version 5.1.whatever is 4.4mb

I dunno, I am skipping this one."
,bearzoo,2011-05-07T01:16Z,by pop ups I simply meant dialog boxes. I didn't mean this program is causing popups. those dialog boxes were from my AV software
,bearzoo,2011-05-07T01:27Z,"yep, got hit by a virus. will report which one when I have all of them removed. Thanks fagot. Get a job and stop being a fagot."
