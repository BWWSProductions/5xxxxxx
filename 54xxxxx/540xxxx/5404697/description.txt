              A british documentary from 2004.
              In the 70's the small american town of Whichita got a
              serial killer. Not just any serial killer either, what they
              got was B.T.K. who hasn't been caught yet. It's been over
              30 years since B.T.K. started to make a name of himself and
              in this docu you'll be shown how he did so.
