  In Los Angeles, a gang of armed thieves is hitting serious targets - major
  banks, vaults, and armored cars. These thieves are led by arch-criminal Neal
  MacAuley. One of their operations, an armored-car robbery, goes bad and the
  armored-car guards are murdered by the gunmen - putting LAPD homicide detective
  Vince Hanna on the trail of the thieves. Hanna knows it will take a lot to 
  bring these dangerous, armed thieves down, and it will end in a horrifying gun
  battle when the thieves try to rob a major federal bank...
