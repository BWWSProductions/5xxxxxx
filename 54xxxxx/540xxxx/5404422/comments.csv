,Porkster,2010-03-03T00:55Z,"""killed by the Romans"" It's commonly know the Jews(Ashkenazi+some tribes of Ben+Judah) killed Jesus.  The Romans carried out the task.

It's like says a foot soldiers declared war on Iraq/Afghanistan when we know the N.W.O declared war."
,romeoluv2539,2010-03-07T13:57Z,hey Hhiiimmmm  you still fail to provide the fact to your opinion to how JESUS CHRIST is fictional....all i see is you trying to make Him do something you want Him to do and irritated bcuz He does things in His own time

[T],Valdo__PT,2010-03-09T01:49Z,"No matter what you may say Jesus Christ is the most important man in the history of mankind, and you are a little ignorant if you blame Jesus Christ for what other people did, do or may do in His name, Jesus Christ words and acts talk for Himself and not other people's actions and words..."
[T],Valdo__PT,2010-03-10T02:44Z,"You took those words out of context, I don't have a Bible here but I can quote these words ""Fortuned are the meek because they will inherit the Earth..."" but don't mistake meek with weak, because people who followed Jesus Christ gave their lives even faced being eaten by lions for what they loved and believed... I am just a sinner here and anyone is free to believe what they want to believe... and being a sinner I believe in Jesus Christ and even if Jesus Christ was not the Son of God as I believe He is, there is no better man in the history of mankind to follow and respect..."
[T],Valdo__PT,2010-03-11T02:39Z,"You must learn how to read I said I am just a sinner, irony is good for losers."
[T],Valdo__PT,2010-03-11T23:12Z,And that means what...?
,Iceviking1,2010-05-01T18:41Z,"Was Jesus a real person or not is irrelevant !
The Q is. Did GOD create MAN or did MAN create GOD ?
