,jayposer2000,2010-03-01T10:13Z,"As another Canadian here I would like to say that im proud off all the Canadians athletes accomplishments in Vancouver. GO CANADA GO.... That being said, I would love to get ahold of the CTV feed for the closing ceremonies. TvTeam? Any chance?"
,sTyLnK,2010-03-01T11:29Z,The NBC coverage was not the greatest unfortunately. I read CTV stay on the air for every everything. If you could upload the CTV coverage that would be amazing!
,dstryr712,2010-03-01T14:29Z,"please, for the love of God, upload a non-split version of this one, for those who don't want to have it cut halfway through...

if anyone has the men's skating from friday night i'd love to see it too, thanks;)"
,claytonb,2010-03-01T14:46Z,Can anyone post a link for 720p version? Thanks. 
,Squrl,2010-03-02T01:57Z,"I too would love the CTV version of this and the Opening ceremonies if I could. But I have a feeling this will have to do as for the 2 cd thing, WTF does it matter?  YOu have another copy of this hanging around?  If you did then why are you hunting around for one?"
,believenu,2010-03-02T02:03Z,any chance of the ctv coverage? 
,harmoncp,2010-03-02T02:55Z,Would love the CTV coverage. Please share it if you've got it!!
,highlander777,2010-03-02T04:48Z,I read NBC really screwed up the closing ceremony broadcast by breaking it up because they wanted to air another show. A really stupid move on their part. One of the reasons I almost never watch TV anymore.
