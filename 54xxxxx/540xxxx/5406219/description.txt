  London 1969 - two 'resting' (unemployed and unemployable) actors, Withnail
  and Marwood, fed up with damp, cold, piles of washing-up, mad drug dealers
  and psychotic Irishmen, decide to leave their squalid Camden flat for an 
  idyllic holiday in the countryside, courtesy of Withnail's uncle Monty's
  country cottage. But when they get there, it rains non-stop, there's no food
  and their basic survival skills turn out to be somewhat limited. Matters are
  not helped by the arrival of Uncle Monty, who shows an uncomfortably keen
  interest in Marwood...
