,]eep,2010-05-05T16:17Z,"I'm surprised so few ppl want to see this. Ppl would rather see the latest blockbuster to flee into a fantasy world while this movie contains information that affects your real life. 

Just like in the Matrix ppl can choose the blue pill or the red pill. WAKE UP! SEE THIS. 

Furthermore I totally agree with the comment on Zeitgeist, what a load of FUD. Bad information, badly researched on purpose to offend christian viewers (the average american) so as to make them object to the rest of the information (like SoO) as well. 

thank you for sharing"
,timlit,2010-05-07T06:51Z,"]eep,
thanks for commenting.
cinematography is a drug after all.
In fact, the Matrix is only one of thousands of movies ment to gradually pervert & degrade the earth's population. (Sorry, Americans. You're not the only victims)
Mind at least two facts in the film:
- unreasonable over-use of the word ""sh*t"" (so suggestive for teens!!!)
- suggestion of truce with the powers that be

Let along the abundance of masonic symbols ( the sun, the eye, etc.)"
,V12HCMF,2010-08-18T11:27Z,"Yes THESE are the real types of videos that use LOGIC as the tool to root out propaganda, deception and distraction from the real truth of how our supposed ""democracy"" actually functions.

It's like getting a technical tour from behind the scenes of a major production/movie/corporation etc. Every institution has a cabinet where all the gears turn, the grease and oil flow and the people that maintain said gearing. 
_These are the people that WE all as citizens of human should be seeking; they hold the true power behind our multitude of ""societies"" (mass collective-programming hives) and how the root functions are carried out. Politicians, governors, mayors etc., are merely customer service reps for said shadow-authority.
_Whenever people give you illogical, filibustering and or irrational (see logic, again) answers to your questions, or attempt any kind of ad-hominem attack; they are lying!

Alas the problem with being ""awoken"" is that now you start to view everyone else that isn't as ""zombified..."" It's really changed my opinion about so-called ""intelligent"" people. And talking about meeting chicks... haha man, the MOST brain-washed of all humans... I meet so many that are 100% zombified, beyond ""re-education,"" very sad for them and us all. "
,Naphtha132X,2010-09-07T03:51Z,Wow. The zeitgeist movement isn't a brainwashing gimmick. did any of you people see Zeitgeist: Addendum? Thats where the good stuff is at. Watch the Zeitgeist activist orientation guide to really see what the movements about.

,ChimChimtheOmni88,2011-02-15T02:42Z,"I've heard a lot of anti-zeitgeist rhetoric on the internet, but not any clear reason for the opposition. As for the 'alienation of the religious' argument presented in the description of this torrent, I'll admit that the anti-religious section of the first Zeitgeist movie never seemed essential to the overall message to me, which is why I recommend that more closed-minded Christians skip that section. In calling the Venus Project (what I assume you mean by 'paradise in technology') a useless solution, I wonder if you would present an alternate solution. I am open to new ideas."
,sunman11,2011-08-19T06:08Z,"A great book people would be interested in would be the book,
Basic Training For Revolutionaries. It was once in hard copy format and then it was banned. You can read more about it here.
