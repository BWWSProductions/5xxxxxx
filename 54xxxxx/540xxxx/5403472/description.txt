The film "The Secret of Oz" concisely discloses the issues covered in  â€œThe MoneyMastersâ€ (thepiratebay.org/torrent/3580067/The_Money_Masters).
Still, The Money Masters is a must as it is most educational.


"... today, in our crazy money system, the government has to borrow our money into existence and then pay interest on it. Thatâ€™s why they call it the National Debt. All our money is created out of debt. Politicians who focus on reducing the National Debt as an answer probably donâ€™t know what the National Debt really is. To reduce the National Debt would be to reduce our money â€“ and thereâ€™s already too little of that.

â€œNo, you have to go deeper. You have to get at the root of this problem or weâ€™re never going to fix this. The solution isnâ€™t new or radical. America used to do it. Politicians used to fight with big bankers over it. Itâ€™s all in our history â€“ now sadly â€“ in the distant past..."

*WARNING*:
Movies Zeitgeist, Ring of power and many others are part of a anti-awakening  brainwash campaign on the internet. The Illuminati (or whatever their ultimate name be) speculate using semi-truth and suggest useless, if not negative, solutions, such as total rejection of the system and paradise in technology, for instance. They act like rats by blaming nations (e.g.Jews) and various religous, political and other social groups), produce fake specialists (for their movies in particualar) and 'geniuses' for downgrading our values and reason. Stay cautious and look for real-life solutions.

The Ill-luminati are retarded and immoral, and are only trying to bring us down to their level. Cheer up and get active!
