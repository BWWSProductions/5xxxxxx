this is a 9.0 on the imdb and is a marvelous movie and a not too bad script based on the book."

,merisaukko,2010-12-05T23:41Z,"Thank you for this! A great series it was, i just watched it. The industrial history and the class relations were maybe the most interesting things for me, even if whole the story was really good. 

The subtitles didn't work for me though, fortunately i understood pretty much everything without them as well. Whether it was my fault or the torent's fault, i don't know. "
