(note: some awesome tracks from this unknown group.  also, some pretty bizarre tracks and a total mix of genre.  mostly indie tracks with guitar breakouts with lots of fuzz, some electro stuff like junior boys (more bizarre).  Also pretty dense and lo-fi.  Hush is def the stand out. Sharing this because i love the album but not many people have heard of it. i know it through a film i saw) 

My Darling Dia, the first full-length release from Shanks and the Dreamers takes the band to all new musical territories and away from their instrumental past. The two piece production duo consisting of filmmaker Amir Motlagh, and Art Toussi continue the path of sonic evolution mixing a broad palette of sounds including everything from post punk, shoegaze, electro and hip-hop, with a seamless integration of attack that has all to due with their diverse backgrounds and relentless creative instincts. My Darling Dia is simply, electro, sonic, bionic music for the social classes.
