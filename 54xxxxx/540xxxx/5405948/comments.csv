,gregmlr,2010-03-16T18:31Z,"ctang, I burned and tested the movie and it is NTSC.

The quality is great (being a DVD-R), the menu's have been stripped (probably necessary to remove some copy protection) but the chapters are still in tact.  A quality rip and super fast download!  I left my computer on overnight to download and by this morning, it was finished.

Thanks!"
