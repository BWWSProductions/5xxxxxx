,thekanknast,2010-04-17T19:17Z,"i bought this album from mckee at a concert in pittsburgh.  the man is crazy awesome.  see this guy in concert, you won't regret it."
,dr.pieper,2010-04-23T02:21Z,"Please Please PLEASE!!! Someone seed for just a little while, I'm stuck at like 99%!  If you seed long enough to let my download finish, I'll seed for at least two weeks.

I want this terribly, and I'm almost there, just seed for a little bit, please and thank you!"
,dr.pieper,2010-04-25T16:27Z,"once you download something, it automatically starts seeding for you.  Just don't click the button that says stop seeding on it.  and if you have stopped seeding, you can click on Audio in your library and right click on the files and select ""resume seeding.""  but if you haven't downloaded it already, then you can't seed obviously, because you don't have the file.  Someone who has already downloaded this needs to seed it to help everyone else get it."

,arpatiko,2010-05-19T21:50Z,I must apologize for downloading this but I just can not afford buying the album. Andy is truly the most amazing guitarist on planet. Really. I'd really like to encourage you guys to buy his albums and watch his performances. Influence for whole life.
,coopatroopa89,2010-08-17T04:03Z,"Here's a link to an andy mckee joyland torrent that isn't stuck at 99.8% but it's about half the quality. 

side note that the quality of acoustic guitar is negligible due to it only having one instrument playing

happy torrenting :-)"
,Adjustice,2011-01-03T00:15Z,"Hi folks,

First of all: Happy New Year to everybody!

I've seen Andy McKee on youtube and then live in concert, uncomparable great music!
I talked to him after the concert. he is a real nice guy and I support him, bought his CD.
You can do that too, it's just a click away...

But then, go, see him live, it is worth it!

And via Andy I got to know Preston Reed, check him out too, interesting...

All the best !!!"
