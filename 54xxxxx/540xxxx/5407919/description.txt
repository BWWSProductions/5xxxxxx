The Boppers, Swedish band, who became popular by playing covers of 1950 - and 1960s songs, especially doo-wop music. The group was formed in HÃ¤sselby 1977, by Ingemar WallÃ©n, Ville Wallen, Peter Jezewski, Mr Jezewski, Mats Lagerwall,
and Lars Westerberg - but many members have come and gone over the years, including King, who still makes guest appearances in the group. They are perhaps best known for their cover of the Spaniels hit Goodnight sweetheart.

The album Number 1 was released 1978 and sold 420000 copies in Sweden.
