,blue_star,2010-03-10T16:53Z,That means it is an ISO image file. It simply means that. But what does 'fixed exe' mean ? Is it a reference to the game.exe file ?

,blue_star,2010-03-13T15:07Z,"You are the greatest bitch among bitches(if you are really a slut). I just want to know whether this is a image file. If so, I have to get daemon tools to mount this up. Understand, you rowdy knave? -- if you can be rude, I can too.   "
