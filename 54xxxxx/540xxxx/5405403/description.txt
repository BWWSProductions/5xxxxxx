PLOT
"What is a ghost? A tragedy condemned to repeat itself time and again? An instant of pain perhaps. Something dead which still seems to be alive. An emotion suspended in time. Like a blurred photograph. Like an insect taped in amber".

It is this rumination which opens THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, a ghost story set during the Spanish Civil War directed by Guillermero Del Toro (Mimic, Blade 2) and presented by Pedro Almodovar.

From the director of Hellboy & Pan's Labyrinth.

Run Time: 106 minutes
Language: Spanish
Subtitles: English Hardcoded
