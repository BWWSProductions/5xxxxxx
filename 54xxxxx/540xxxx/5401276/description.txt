   Create and deploy professional Perl applications

   The Perl Dev Kit (PDK) provides essential tools for building and deploying 
   Perl applications. PDK features cross-platform wrapping and application 
   builders for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, and AIX, plus a suite of 
   tools to speed development time and improve code quality and consistency 
   across teams.

   PDK 8.0 supports ActivePerl 5.8 and ActivePerl 5.10. 

   Deploy:
   - Develop and deploy your Perl programs to anyone on any platform with 
     PerlApp's new cross-platform wrapping.
   - Deliver code as executables or as Windows Services, ActiveX components, 
     .NET assemblies or in the System Tray.
   - Easily create MSI files using Perl code.

   Code:
   - Be your own best critic: Enforce best-practices or personalized coding 
     policies against your source code. Great for teams! 
   - Filter text interactively, with on-the-fly results.
   - Jump start your transition from VBScript to Perl.

   Fix:

     hotspot analysis and data set comparisons.
   - Find problems fast with the nimble Windows debugger.

   PDK Pro includes the complete suite of PDK tools for creating and deploying 
   Perl applications. Graphical user interfaces for all application builders 
   make creating executables fast and easy, with visual guides to a wealth of 
   build options. The comprehensive feature set includes PerlApp, Coverage
