0: Install Sygic on your phone. Open the Sygic program on your phone and go to about sygic you will find the ID of your phone 

1: Run the keygen and select the mlm file that is included with the keygen.

2: Enter the divice id for your phone.

3: press on generate to get a key to activate.

4: open the notepad and copy the key you get -1234567890 to the notepad and save the file with the name license.txt. Important is that you start with - and then your key. For example -8AOA9D18FKD9

5: copy the mlm file and the license file to your phone to the folder maps.

6: run Sygic and load the maps and it wel not ask any more for activation."

,ghostaki,2010-04-25T16:58Z,"Hi Khaled,

I'm having problem activating Mobile Maps on my HTC Desire. I use the keygen with every possible combination of ID/mlm, but no luck. I've tried using phone's 'Device serial number (HT03RPL04177)', the 'device code' given by MM10 (0380b2eab6), and both the .mlm files (one supplied by EUROPE DVD and the other supplied in keygen folder) but program still asks for activation. 

All I do i paste the .mlm file to MAPS folder. The same I do for the licence.txt file, where I've copied the code I'm being given by the keygen. I've copied the code with a dask '-' in front of it. 

any ideas? 

thanks!"
,sbsdegb1,2010-04-26T23:30Z,"Its all to do with the spelling of licence. It has to be license with an S not a C. Baffled me for 10 mins but once I changed it voila.

Hope this helps."

2: Enter the divice id for your phone. wat the o and 0 they look the same (this was my mistake xD)

3: press on generate for a serial

4: open the notepad and (let my say your serial is 34j5h677iy4 or something) you must fil in       -34j5h677iy4- Put the - or it didn't work :)

5: copy the mlm file and the license file to your phone in the maps map

,an-kara,2011-02-24T13:21Z,"To :  jflex_ 

(I will explaine it as good I can in english)

1. install sygic (Sygic_Assistant)
2. run sygic (need activation)
3. activate manual
4. On the screen u will get a DEVICE CODE, copy that ore remeber the code!

  now, u need 2 things to generate:
  SMM10 Europe(in the folder; maps)  and 
DEVICE CODE

  Type in sygic keygen:
  MLM File: SMM10 Europe
Device ide: the device code ( the code u copied)

 5.Generate and u will get the serial number
 6. run sygic again and type the serial number (manual activation)

 So.. u do not need your device ide ore the mlm file in the keygen folder. 
 Forget what others have written, good luck
