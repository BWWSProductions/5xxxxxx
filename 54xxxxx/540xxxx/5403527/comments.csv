,darkbreed,2010-03-02T17:00Z,"Please keep seeding this pack and help others get the full working version of the newest updated Sims 3 + World Adventures, along with the mentioned extra EA store items and mods!

This torrent has been checked and verified and the package put together by me, virus scanned and trojan free.

If you have any problems with the installation even after following my easy instructions feel free to ask here. But, before asking, at least know what ""rar"", ""zip"", ""winrar"", ""winzip"", ""iso"", ""poweriso"", ""daemon tools"" etc are, if not GOOGLE it first!

Best regards and happy playing!

,darkbreed,2010-03-02T17:04Z,"I created this package with the instructions because I had a BIG pain in the arse getting this game to work properly on my own PC the first time. Took me a couple days just to figure out how to get it properly installed. And then I had problems applying all the patches and mods, installing riverview, problems with the awesome mod and so on.

So, I have FIXED all those issues in this package and included WORKING files for everything, and updated the errors and informed about the changes you neeed to make within both the Windows Registry as well as the game folders themselves to get everything up and running correctly.

I hope someone will find this package useful and easy enough to install, and enjoy the contents!

Cheers

,darkbreed,2010-03-02T18:47Z,"And people, please help SEED this package! I will let it seed for a good time myself, but please help seeding so others can benefit too!

It took me a LONG time to properly create this package, add all relevant updates, files, mods, patches etc, fix errors, and write the PROPER installation instructions for the complete thing.

As far I am aware, this is the most complete Sims 3 Package you will find currently on any torrent site, and I hope you will give me some kudos by helping SEEDING so others will be able to get it as well.

Feel free to tell your friends and anyone else about this torrent so they can come here to download and thus assist in seeding and spreading the package for as many as possible. Link to this torrent on your site and whatever, on forums where it is allowed, and so on.

Cheers to all whom helps seed and spread this new super-package of the Sims 3 with World Adventures!!

,deepthoughtdevil,2010-03-02T19:16Z,"Great torrent man. You've created a really comprehensive package. I'll be playing The Sims for the first time, so this looks like a nice BIG introduction. Nicely done. Cheers."
,ELNINOKOP9,2010-03-02T19:34Z,"OK WELL I DOWNLOADED RAZOR911 AND IT WAS VIRUS ETC N SIMS CUDNT CONFIRM ITS REAL GAME SO CUDNT PLAY HOPE URS WORKS U SEEM REAL AND TRUSTWORTHY 

and seed people seeeeed its well slow atm"
,darkbreed,2010-03-02T22:09Z,"If the exact instructions are followed, this package should work flawlessly. I tried several other releases, and downloaded Riverview etc, without getting it to work properly, such as Riverview not showing up even though it said ""installed ok"" in the launcher. With this release, the riverview files are already ""pre-installed"" so all it takes is to copy to the correct folders as explained. The same goes for all other store objects.

I also had major problems patching the other releases, and the instructions were not clear etc on how to properly install things, so I have worked it all out and included everything that is needed, and excluded that which is not needed, and written the complete and correct way to install it and get all running perfectly. I have tested and verified the installation of everything on both my own computer and a friend, and all is smooth and all objects are there etc, the uncensor patch works perfectly, so does the Awesomemod (which is really great btw, read the info file in its own zip for all details - I fixed some errors it had such as graphics issues many people experienced with it).

I thus hope others will find this worthwile as well, and have no problems installing it, I myself had a bunch of problems finding out how to get everything to work before I solved it. I had to uninstall and reinstall the game several times and what not, try different updates, find the correct patches (there are different patches for different country releases etc, I have included the ""worldwide"" patches, thus you need to configure the Regedit SKU to 2 from 7 as this is valid for the ""worldwide patches) and so on.

After a lot of back and forth, testing and experimenting, downloading different packages and releases of both store items, patches, mods, the games themselves and so on, I have now managed to put together a complete working full release with all available items mentioned within my installation instructions.

Good luck and please seed this all :)

,aparanae,2010-03-04T14:50Z,Does this work for mac?
,darkbreed,2010-03-04T16:36Z,"aparanae:  Yes, it should work on Mac too, at least the base games (Sims 3 and World Adventures) are for both Mac and Windows. I do not know anything about Macs myself, never used them, so you would have to adjust the installation instructions to be valid for Mac (installation paths, where to put files, and so on). Also, I do not know if the keygens supplied will work on Mac, nor do I know if all/any of the extra material is working for Mac since I have only tested on PC's. BUT, as said, the game itself should be working for Mac. Here is the system requirements copied directly from the installation DVD's readme file (the ISO, a direct copy of the original game):

The Sims 3 requires at least the following:

FOR WINDOWS XP
 * 2.0 GHz P4 processor or equivalent
 * 1 GB RAM
 * A 128 MB Video Card with support for Pixel Shader 2.0 
 * The latest version of DirectX 9.0c
 * Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2
 * At least 6.1 GB of hard drive space with at least 1 GB of
   additional space for custom content and saved games

FOR WINDOWS VISTA
 * 2.4 GHz P4 processor or equivalent
 * 1.5 GB RAM
 * A 128 MB Video Card with support for Pixel Shader 2.0  
 * Microsoft Windows Vista Service Pack 1
 * At least 6.1 GB of hard drive space with at least 1 GB of
   additional space for custom content and saved games

For computers using built-in graphics chipsets under Windows, 
the game requires at least:
 * Intel Integrated Chipset, GMA 3-Series or above
 * 2.6 GHz Pentium D CPU, or 1.8 GHz Core 2 Duo, or equivalent
 * 0.5 GB additional RAM

FOR MAC OS X
 * Mac OS X 10.5.7 Leopard or higher
 * Intel Core Duo Processor
 * 2 GB RAM
 * ATI X1600 or Nvidia 7300 GT with 128 MB of Video RAM, or
   Intel Integrated GMA X3100.
 * At least 6.1 GB of hard drive space, with at least 1 GB 
   additional space for custom content and saved games
 * This game will not run on PowerPC (G3/G4/G5) based Mac 
   systems, or the GMA 950 class of integrated video cards.

  4850, 4870

Intel(R) Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA)
  GMA 3-Series, GMA 4-Series

Laptop versions of these chipsets may work, but may run
comparatively slower. Standalone cards that are installed in
vanilla PCI slots (not PCIe or PCIx or AGP), such as some
GeForce FX variants, will perform poorly. 

Integrated chipsets such as the ATI Xpress and the NVIDIA
TurboCache variants may default to settings that are higher 
than what would be optimal for them.  Graphics settings 
can be lowered to improve performance. 

The NVIDIA GeForce FX series is unsupported under Vista.


MAC OS X Supported Video Cards

NVIDIA GeForce series
  7300, 7600
  8600, 8800
  9400M, 9600M GT

Unsupported Video Cards
-----------------------

Please note that attempting to play the game using video 
hardware that isn?t listed above may result in reduced 
performance, graphical issues, or cause the game to not 
run at all.


Known and Possible Hardware Issues
==================================

Audio hardware acceleration is unsupported.

Mac OS X:
On Mac OS X systems that have NVIDIA cards with less than
256 MB of VRAM, you may need to reduce the graphics quality
in the game options menu for improved performance.

If running the game on a Mac Book Pro with display mirroring 
turned on, ensure that you select a resolution which is 
supported by both the internal and external displays. 
A workaround for this issue is to ensure that the internal 
LCD is the main system monitor before turning on"
,darkbreed,2010-03-04T18:34Z,"Please SEED this package for a while after downloading. I am seeding this 24/7 at full speed and will be seeding it for a while, but please help by letting it SEED once downloaded! Shame on the ones of you whom got it downloaded and then stopped as soon as you were seeding! It was 3 seeders here earlier but now I am the only one again..

I can only upload at 60kbs so please keep your torren ON so it SEEDS after downloading.

Personally I have my computer on 24/7 anyway, so I let it seed all night long. If you can do the same that is great, help share, that is what this community is about!

Thanks to all for downloading and seeding and shame on ya lousy quitters whom just download and then stop ;) Keep it alive folks thanks.

,strippy78,2010-03-05T16:22Z,"I have one question. First of all, congratulations for your effort about this thing. Now... I don't understand do i need to have already install Sims3, or I can only download this torrent and then install everything. In 3-rd ""item"" of your manual u said that we got to unrar sims3 into main sims3 installation path. If i don't have already install sims3 on my computer, what is main installation path?! I suppose that i must have already sims3 on my computer with 1.0.631 patch, and than i done everything what u said in your manual. Am i right? 
I hope that u gona answer me, sorry about my bad english :)"
,darkbreed,2010-03-05T23:26Z,"strippy78:

Cheers mate, this package included the FULL game of Sims 3, and the FULL expansion pack of World Adventures, in addition to ALL store items (extra objects etc to use in the game, from clothes to hair styles, furniture, cars etc) released until January 2010 - and it also includes the Riverview world, as well as uncensor patch and a couple other mods (Such as Awesomemod - google it for its features).

So , no you do NOT need the Sims 3 already, it is INCLUDED in this package :)

Just follow every step as described and you will have it all. PS: The instructions got a bit fecked here in TPB for some reason, but they are included as both Word doc and txt file in the package itself).

Enjoy!"
,darkbreed,2010-03-06T01:17Z,"UPDATE:

Although it says, at the moment of writing this, that there is only 1 seeder for this torrent, the actual number is 29 according to my uTorrent - perhaps because I have uploaded this to other trackers as well and have multiple trackers in the torrent.

So, thus, please start downloading as there are now many seeders, and not only 1 as said here. 

Also please SEED this package yourself after the download is finished. To seed, simply let this torrent ON, do not stop it even when complete.

Let it be on and seeding for several days at least if possible to help increase the speed of downloads and contribute to the sharing of this package as my own line is slow.

If you do not want to use all your bandwith for seeding as it may slow down your other internet activities, remember you can RIGHT CLICK the torrent, and chose a specific Upload rate yourself!

So , do not worry about getting your own line slowed down from seeding, simply right click, select ""Bandwith Allocation"", then ""Set Upload Limit"" and select whatever suits you - I recommend at least 50% of your bandwiths capacity, and this should leave you with no noticeable slowdowns in other normal internet use such as browsing etc.

It is better seeding at a low speed than not seeding at all - so please be kind as it has taken me one heck of a time and efforts putting all this together and collecting all the various extras :)

St-Thomas"
,Ihloria,2010-03-06T09:22Z,Thanx for a great torrent! :-) I have one question. I already have both sims 3 and WA installed. Can I still use this torrent by just downloading the patches and extra content?

,adylyn,2010-03-06T22:34Z,"Is there a place somewhere that explains how to download in english :P I have googled BitTorrent, but I am not sure where to get PowerIso, I tried google and got links that didnt work, or I had to pay for ;(  I am just confused from the beginning with 
""Mount The Sims 3 iso with PowerIso. If the installation window for the game comes up, let it for now. Open the Drive the ISO is mounted on and open the cracks folder. Rld-sims3.exe is the KeyGen you need to run now""

Maybe there is a link for newbies to read and then I can understand what to do? Sry to be a total noob! I am just a girl that doesnt have the lingo down."
,darkbreed,2010-03-07T02:34Z,"adylyn:

Simply search for PowerIso here in Pirates bay and download and install with reg code etc.

Once installed, you get a virtual dvd drive. You simply right click on the .iso file, and chose Drives first and select 1 drive, then you click on it again, and this time select Mount and chose the virtual drive to mount it on.

Next thing that will happen is that you get a new virtual drive on your pc that looks just like any other drive, and by clicking it it is the same as clicking the drive for the actual DVD, and you can see its contents just like on the actual DVD, and run the setup files etc.

You get a new drive station called by a letter no other drive station is assigned already, for example G:

I installed the game it worked fine i'm so happy for this torrent because i have had so much problems until now..But in my documents folder electronics art the sims 3 is no folder called DCCACHEnor id the folder called custom music and these folders should be there but i can't see them? Please the only thing with cche in it's name is the folder called SIGSCACHE and i don't know? can i copy the dbc files into that folder? I dont understand why those folders are missing...Please can someone help me..Would hate to have to everything again..Thanks
Sis"
,darkbreed,2010-03-08T15:24Z,"D12sbabe:

It should be this folder:
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\DCCache

If that does not exist, go to the folder before it ( C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\ ) and there simply create a new folder with the name DCCache , and then put the .dbc files into it.

Then delete scriptCache.package in C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 

And restart the game and see if it works now.


Frosteeze:

Did you follow all the instructions correctly and copy all the files into all the needed folders?

All works fine here, including Riverview with save"
,darkbreed,2010-03-08T15:42Z,"Also, regarding riverview, you need to copy the .dbc files into the mentioned folders which you have to create as per my instructions, and also use the resources.cfg file as mentioned.

You may also try this if it still is not working:
Copy Riverview.world file into both these places:
""Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\InstalledWorlds\""

Then to ""\The Sims 3\GameData\Shared\NonPackaged\Worlds""

Then again delete the scriptCache.package in C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 before restarting the game. You can try to delete all the files with the name ""cache"" in them here and restart to make the game rebuild itself.

St-Thomas"
,darkbreed,2010-03-08T15:47Z,"And please seed this people, it would be appreciated as a thanks for the effort putting this together.

Let your torrent client on, and if you stopped the torrent after downloaded, start it again and it will start seed - it will NOT start to re-download so dont worry about that.

Also, if you feel seeding is eating bandwith and slowing down your internet do this:

go to the settings and set upload limit to half or even a quarter of your full upload rate (for example if you can upload at 100kbs set it to 50kbs or 25kbs etc). In total amounts of uploads per torrent set 3 or so as using more will slow down the upload for each connected peer (for example if you set it to 10, the total upload rate you have chosen will be split on those ten so they only download at one tenth speed each. Setting it to 3 will at least only split the bandwith on 3 so they get a decent enough download speed).

Thanks and spread the word and let people know about this torrent and where to get it.

I do not have that extension pack myself so never tried. I assume you could download it and install it in the same way you installed World Adventures.

,SveinMorten92,2010-03-09T14:23Z,"Hi darkbreed!
First of all... great torrent! but, i'm having a problem with the regedit step, as the info on the left you write about isn't there... what to do? only thing there is reg_sz file, with no values."
,darkbreed,2010-03-09T18:44Z,"DB12Babe: Hope you got it worked out :)

And if that file I said to delete is not there then no worries, it is a cache files generated when playing the game and only needs to be deleted if playing the game is not properly working with all installed items, then it should be deleted, and game restarted.


Svein Morten:

I think you must have gone one folder too short, you probably only went to the ""Sims"" folder, click the pluss (+) sign on it to open it and you should see ""The Sims 3"" as well as ""The Sims World Adventures"" (if you installed both)

Clicking on either of these gives more info, and double click the ""SKU"" and change the number to 2 (it should be 7 if not changed, if it already is 2 then no worries).

The same goes for The Sims 3 World Adventures, check the SKU there too.

So, the total path for the correct location in RegEdit is:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - SOFTWARE - SIMS - THE SIMS 3

That's where you change the SKU

If you still cant find it, click on ""EDIT"" then ""FIND"" in RegEdit, and search for ""SKU"" manually - Check the ""Find whole string only"".

Hope that helps."

,darkbreed,2010-03-15T18:37Z,"If people can not get the game to run after following the instructions exactly as pointed out, it must either be something wrong with their computer and settings (perhaps not meeting minimum game system requirements), or they have missed something during the installation steps. The game has been tested and found to work fine on all computers I personally have installed it on, and as seen here people whom download it and follow the instructions correctly do get it working. Personally I use Windows XP and have only tested it on XP but others are playing it fine on Vista and 7 etc too. Personally I would recommend XP as the operative system though not only for this game but because XP is the most stable and supported version of Windows out, and it uses tons less system resources, runs smoother and quicker and so on.

I bought several computers with Vista pre-installed, and I formated those computers immediately before installing anything else, and installed windows XP instead. Wow wow wee wah! Get Windowx XP Performance Edition ! It is the best XP out there, incredibly fast and stable, and takes extremely little space (less than 500mb for the total installation)

I have used the Performance edition for a year and it works flawlessly and better than any other Windows version I ever tried.

Remember you can have several operative systems installed, just install it and keep the old if you want without formating, and you can chose on startup which operative system you want to run.

My two operative systems are Ubuntu Linux and Windows XP Performance Edition. HIGH FIVE!"

Step 8 says to install the world adventures but your instructions mention nothing about another code to be entered.

Why am I being prompted for the activation code?

the regedit thing in instructions not working for windows vista was a minor bobble but on guys foudn the solution... but now this activation code on the world adentures thing that no one seems to have entcountered yet?

So uh, I have to download a world adventures key generator now?  Is that step 7.9.1 A or something?"
,amnios,2010-05-14T13:27Z,"so fortunately I had the not so bright idea to look on the world adventures cd for a crack folder... and got a code generator for world adventures...

BUT...

but really... if the instructions say ""follow exactly"" and you do but the instructions do not tell you exactly what to do then...

Then am I crazy or?

minor peev I guess... I'll keep seeding at 100KB a second but if one more bobble comes up...

I'm only installing this gay game for my GF to play so she wont get mad at me when I play real games."
,amnios,2010-05-14T14:02Z,"by the way.

Is it really necessary to uninstall the EA game updater?

I have other software that likely uses it"
,amnios,2010-05-14T14:07Z,"Because I'm pretty sure I've now done the parsed instructions but I run the game and it takes me to the updater again and asks me to update.

I ran it once before like you asked and my version now is 2.6.11.005002

so this is obviously different from the version you used when you made this torrent.

SO is the Ea manager causing me to continuously go back and update before playing?  Or do I have to crack the 2.6?

Man this is really involved.

How has no one run into ANY of these things I've run into?  Like thanks by the way for telling me to create the one folder in the documents.. which is different in vista by the way.

I'm on Vista 64... maybe I should be using crappy XP?

THis is becoming quickly not worth it.  I'm still seeding at a lamborgini pace but I'm thinking about stopping soon if I cant get this thing running."
,amnios,2010-05-14T14:37Z,"ok thanks but no thanks.

There is a reason why I do not make torrents. Because if I did they would not work easily.

LIke this one.

I suggest people look elsewhere because the instructions are not up to date and I wasted 2 weeks of my life downloading this garbage and already to much BW seeding.

screw it.  Game is gay anyway my GF can go out and buy it."
,AssassinGamePlayer,2010-05-14T18:40Z,"I ran into all those probs, and got them all fixed, but  after the video intro on the game it crashes..."
,falsewipe,2010-05-17T05:17Z,"the current patch from EA Games is v.2.6.11. Though the crack in this torrent package is for v.2.5.12, it still support the latest patch.

But if you want to get the intended patch for this crack, you can go to some sims modding site like 

www.modthesims.info

http://www.modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:TS3_Patching:Patch_Download

they also provide alternate patch for different operating system like OS X"
,ekam3000,2010-05-18T14:48Z,thanks this sims 3 is realy working.. your instruction is very fixed i understand very well but that is to long to me.
,darkbreed,2010-05-19T19:17Z,"If people just READ the instructions properly.

Regarding other versions that the game updates to now since its been some time since I uploaded this:

I clearly state the following in the instructions on this very page:

""IF your game is updates to anything ELSE than v.2.5.12 by using the automatic update mentioned in this step, it means you need to get the crack for the specific version you got updated to. OR you can simply download the v.2.5.12 update patch somewhere online using google and stay there and then apply my crack. However, if you want get updated to a newer version than what is currently available as I write this, you need to get the crack if you want it to run. You can go to www.gamecopyworld.com for cracks (NoDVD cracks) for the game""

Also I will update the instructions a bit more noob-friendly since some people can't find simple things like the file ""sims 3 reloaded.rar"" (ps your windows has a ""Search"" option to look for files, and browsing through folders to have a look manually doesn't hurt either). Oh well, I will update the info with the exact path of where the file is found too.

This torrent works flawlessly if instructions are just followed to the letter. If you can't get it to work you either did something wrong, or have another operative system than what I wrote this for (in that case you are excused!). I used Windows XP and thus everything written reflects to an XP operative system, people using crap like Vista or 7 need to figure out certain elements of the installation procedure themselves if the XP routine does not work. I keep to XP Performance Editition, the best Windows operative system out there (fastest - loads in 20 sec from pusing ""Power"" button to fully loaded ready to use - extremely low space (takes 300mb of your HD) - uses extremely low resources (usually you have 90% of memory and other resources still free). Get that version instead you will be happy you did. And PS: Make sure to get all your computer and equipment drivers BEFORE - or simply install it as an extra operative system and run both (I run Win XP and Linux).

Good luck to all, and thanks to all whom enjoyed this torrent and help seed and spread it.

-ST Thomas"
,darkbreed,2010-05-20T02:36Z,"PS: I added links to where you can get both the newest patches to upgrade to newest retail version, as well as links to pages with cracks for those versions.

In addition I noobified the installations instructions some so it should be possible for the most computer-illeterate to intsall the game.

Both Windows Vista and 7 instructions have also been added this time for anyone running those shitty operative systems instead of XP which the installation guide was originally made for.

God bless.

,darkbreed,2010-05-20T06:33Z,"I am currently trying to find a way to edit the Awesomemod to remove the time limit / expiration date which it is set with to remove the damn annoying expired messages telling you to download a new version.

If anyone have some tips on how to edit the .package file and find the right settings within it to change that would be appreciated.

Im looking at the file with Sims 3 Package Explorer now, and the Awesomemod.package contains a bunch of files, and one of them got to have the settings for the expiration date. If I find it I should be able to remove - or at least change it to a distant date like year 2020.

As of yet I did not locate the time expiration settings but im searching and looking into it and if I figure it out I will post a new torrent with a new hacked awesomemod (I already fixed the graphics issues many had with the official version) along with the most recent version of both sims 3 + world adventures and new additional stuff.

,Serec,2010-06-18T06:07Z,"Wow, this is amazing.
I'm new to this, so steps 3 and 5(for windows 7) is confusing for me.

Anyway, how do I find out if I have v2.5.12"
,Keikoluna,2010-06-18T22:37Z,"I was wondering if anybody is having the same problem as i am. I downloaded & installed fine, even got it updated... but ever since i installed this Sims3 the first time, some of my fences r glitched. Mostly the ""metal"" bar ones that you are SUPPOSED to see through... they have a dark background. Can anyone help?"
,darkbreed,2010-06-27T02:13Z,"sweetlilgiggles: You can change the region code as mentioned in installation instructions:

Windows XP:
Type in REGEDIT from Start Menu > Run and do this:
1. Go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARESimsThe Sims 3
2. You will see a bunch of information to the right. Look for «SKU» which has a numerical string that ends on 7. Simply doubleclick the «SKU» icon under Value Name, and change 7 to 2 - Close Regedit.
3. OK, refresh, then restart your computer.

Windows Vista / Windows 7:
1. Go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeSimsThe Sims 3
2. Choose Value Name: SKU ,and double click to change the Value Data to: 2.
3. OK, refresh, then restart your computer.


Taurina: Install the game and update to newest version BEFORE applying any cracks and it should work fine. However, you need to find a crack for the newest updated version you get from doing that.

,cutess45,2011-05-31T06:28Z,"For those who can't run the game properly. This is what i did :

I followed everything except the patches--- I downloaded a torrent which contains the first update to v. 19. And when Installing W.A --- i DIDN'T INSTALL EA DOWNLOAD MANAGER. I GOOGLED THE UPDATE for WA. And... Then It Worked----Flawlessly. Just go to Awesome Mod's Official site to download the lastest Awesome Mod for v.19 


:)))) Thnx once again Darkbreed :))"
,poop13,2011-06-30T21:30Z,"took me forEVER to find the sku file in windows registry. for me it wasn't in ea games or whatever, but you had to scroll down the bottom to a directory called ""sims"".

thanks for the awesome torrent, just needed the base game cause my cd is all scratched to shit and can't reinstall after reformatting my computer."
