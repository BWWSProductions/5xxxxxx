To create your own server:
1. Type ~ (ie start console - MAKE SURE TO ENABLE CONSOLE IN THE GAME OPTIONS)

3. Type SV_LAN 1
4. Type NET_START
5. Type MAP XXXXXX (where xxx is the name of the map you want to play - maps with "vs" in the name are where one side plays

his hamachi IP, not his computer's IP and connect to that. note, you can only connect and play together if at least the first 2
octets of the IP's match. The hamachi ip is located at the top of the hamachi application)





I uploaded the game i use to play with my friends on the hamachi network

game has 7GB installed but i compressed it with 7Zip.

all fixes and debugs found until now installed

to change your player name go to rev.ini and edit "player name="



I am not supporting this anymore, because i have a new and better client.
Don't worry, I will upload it here too.
A much better client that works on all the non steam servers in the world using the Seti master server database (about 2000 non steam private servers) :D 


the new better version can be found here:
