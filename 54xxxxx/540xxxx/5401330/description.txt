
Old Fashioned Love Songs is a beautiful vintage collection of popular lovesongs from the 50s & 60s. In a similar vein to Dreamboats and Petticoats - this album throws a nostalgic take on the hits from a decade that are as popular now as they were then. The album includes over 3 hours of the biggest hits from the likes of Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Nat 'King' Cole, Ben E. King and many many more
