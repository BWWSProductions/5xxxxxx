[T],gamerguuy,2010-03-03T14:35Z,no
,hardarson,2010-03-03T14:36Z,Is this the same as Allstars?
,Nightm4r3z,2010-03-03T15:29Z,"thanks for the upload Gamerguuy But...what does ""Nuked"" mean and is this an INSTANT BAN ON LIVE? im not really bothered as id just buy another 360 but, to know about instant ban would be cool :)"
,mallorn,2010-03-03T15:35Z,"Nuked means it has errors and doesn't work properly.
This is not an instant ban on Xbox Live (I think) but you take a big risk as the game isn't in stores yet. So to be certain don't use Xbox Live...
Thanks gamerguuy, u rock!"
,TidusZ,2010-03-03T16:04Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!

This is the NUKED Allstars release.
Just load the torrent and look at file names.

You wasting your time, because in best case DVD1 and 2 wont work, and in worst case youll be banned from Live."
,TidusZ,2010-03-03T16:55Z,"2 evildood 
ITS NOT RF, I downloaded this file from usenet, and this game is only PAL and NTSC/U.

In any case, wait for proper release, this game is nuked."
,yoyoyoy,2010-03-03T16:55Z,"gamer guy - you have given loads of great uploads in the past - thanks for that !

It does seemto be the same filename as the allstars scene release which is no region free. Has this been changed from the scene release? I cannot find and NTSC-J release anywhere "
[V],Morck22,2010-03-03T17:00Z,I'm gonna up the fixed One if you want to wait a little bit
,TidusZ,2010-03-03T17:02Z,"Here is a picture from ABGX360 with all regions.

,mainro,2010-04-09T03:34Z,"Il fonctionne et en franĂ§ais, pas de souci!"
,Xenon999,2010-05-21T14:38Z,"Gamerguuy. Thanks for the upload, but can you answer a few questions, because I need to know before I downloading it.

1. Is this game region free? Can I play it in an Asia Xbox 360, because I live in Malaysia, which is an Asian country.

2. Do I need to use the All Star fix for Disc 1 and Disc 2?

If it is region free, then I will gladly seed all three torrents for Final Fantasy XIII after I finished downloading it.

Please reply ASAP, thanks."
,roquejo,2010-06-06T13:17Z,Can somebody confirm if this works on the Xbox asian version?
[T],gamerguuy,2010-06-18T17:01Z,"@Xenon999 yes you need the allstar fix and about the region,I have never heard about such a region ut for more info ,you should look on the back of your xbox to see what region it says  and requejo same for you.Hope this helps!"
