PLOT
Jess (Gellar), a woman whose life turns surreal after an automobile accident leaves both her husband Ryan and her brother-in-law Roman (Pace) in a coma. Things take an even darker turn when Roman wakes believing that he is Ryan. As Jess tries to deal with these increasingly disturbing events, she also struggles with the possibility that either the spirit of her husband has returned to her or that something very sinister is at work. This movie embodies the possibility that human possession is possible, and it can happen when you least expect it.

The film is based on the 2002 South Korean film Addicted.
