,magic_phil,2010-03-03T21:58Z,Firstly thanks for the upload. Can anyone confirm this working???
,kkshyamala,2010-03-08T15:28Z,Thank you very much! It works well with my XP. I already had the trial version but it had only univariate analysis. Now with your patch and crack I have got multi variate and multiple measures analysis too. Thank you once again. There are so many seeders and leechers. But only one thanks so far!
,firewithin1,2010-03-10T19:18Z,"hey guys im sorry but i cant get it to work.

I followed the how to install:

First off I cant find the name on the file Spss_statistics_17 win.en-2 

so i used spss17 install file in the  spss statitsics folder. Followed instructions and got to nr 5.

5. patching it and failed totally. So if someone can describe it more detailed it would be great.

yes im amatur but I have done these things b4 so have patience with me thanks."
,Hamali87,2010-03-11T09:23Z,I had an error while installing.. Couldn't find a file..
,dexk,2010-03-11T16:13Z,"Haven't tried out other functions, but it seems that installation has no problem for me. I did the following steps:

Before installation, I checked the whole file with avast! (1-year free edition) and it removed to chest a ""dropper"" (no idea about what it is tho).

Then,
1. In SPSS Statistics file: run ""setup.exe""
2. Choose single license installation
3. Put random serial number
4. At the end of installation, choose ""Enable temporary license"" and in the pop-up window, choose ""trial.txt"" (this will enable a 30-day trial version, when you open SPSS and close, it will show how many days left)
5. Go to Patch and Crack file, run ""SPSSStatistics17.0.1Patch.exe"", this will install patch
6. Restart the computer
7. In the Patch and Crack file, run ""spss1701crack.exe""
8. Run SPSS and when you close the 30-day limit is gone."
,cebzki,2010-03-12T09:53Z,"its working fine with me, but everytime i close the program a message ""your trial period will end in 30 days""

does this indicate that the patch and crack is not working?

pls. i need feedback...thanks for posting this program."
,SaddQ,2010-04-09T20:53Z,"When scanning the file 'setup.exe' with the virus scanner G-Data, a virus called 'NSIS:Agent-H[Drp](Engine B)' is spotted. However, the software runs well so far. 

Can anyone else confirm the presence of the virus? Or has my virus scanner signalled a false positive?"
,greeneggs4spam,2010-04-21T07:28Z,"Get a few hits for different virus scanners.  I'm not sure if they're false positives or not, wish this guy had other uploads or something.  I also scanned it with nod32  which doesn't typically give me false positives though, but it found the same thing which scares me a bit.

,mrkokuri,2010-10-23T13:35Z,"Works like a charm =) 

thank you!! 

Those of that cant seem to get it working, do what i did (I use windows 7) 

1 unzip SPSS (say your desktop)
2 then open SPSS17 folder, then go into SPSS statistics folder
3 open SPSS Statistics 17.0 (setup file) 
4. Install 
Some might not get the pop up menu that says ""Enable temporary license"". if you dont, close SPSS Statistics, then goto your start menu. Then find the SPSS Inc folder. Click on SPSS License Authorization. Then choose ""trial.txt"" (this will enable a 30-day trial version, when you open SPSS and close, it will show how many days left). Then reopen the SPSS Statistics program. It should now show how many trail days are left (30 Days)... Then
5 Close SPSS statistics program. 
6 Go into SPSS 17 folder, then go into Patch and Crack Folder, then install ""spss1701crack""
7 After installing spss1701crack, restart your computer. 
8 Open SPSS statistics and the ""30 day trial"" should be gone
hope this helps :)

Thanks again!!

,discman4354,2011-01-10T04:14Z,"It's working perfectly, thanx. Is it possible to re-use the patch and crack included in this dowload for spss18?"
,stoppable408,2011-02-11T10:26Z,"I have a problem, the License Authorization window doesn't pop up, and when i click on the License Authorization application under the start menu, the following paragraph shows up. 

""The item ""law.exe"" that this shortcut refers to has been changed or moved, so this shortcut will no longer work properly."
,DavidRockefeller,2011-09-08T17:13Z,"I have windows7 and followed mrkokuri's instructions and it works, BUT

step 5.5 - install the patch

Without installing the patch it didn't work

Many thanks to uploader!"
,Nialis,2011-09-23T11:48Z,"The Avast found a troyan in it, that have benn deleted. Anyway, it seems like it's going to work withot that part of it, I have no idea why was that for, hoping nothing serious. "
,daleel,2011-10-27T11:02Z,"thank your very much for sharing your efforts, mate."
,joshea,2012-03-20T07:40Z,"guys if u want this to work..u need to temporarily disable ur antivirus, as it may show false positives n the crack file and will also quarantine or delete it. once u;ve installed the software, reactivate ur anti-virus."
