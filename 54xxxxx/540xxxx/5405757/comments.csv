movie is a nice one....thanx tv team"
,imrealgod,2010-03-15T23:13Z,"@bubai009: If you wanna check out how's the A/V w/o downloading the whole movie beforehand, just d/l the sample. If that's too much for you to afford (no disrespect meant, I know some can't afford that due to bandwidth limitations), I can only give you my word... I just downloaded the sample & checked it. Going by the sample, I'd rate A/V as A=V=10/10. I'm now downloading the whole movie. Hope its as good as the sample."
,henry76,2010-05-05T17:16Z,Awesome...Thanks....:)
,clevertroglodyte,2010-06-09T03:22Z,"Great quality.

A little boring... but, if you can get past the first half an hour or so, it does get better.

Thanks for the upload, TvTeam!"
