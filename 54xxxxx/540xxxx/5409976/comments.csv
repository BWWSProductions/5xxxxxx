Just wanted to ask how safe is it to use the software since its pirate? I mean if Intuit ever catch up with this version or license key what will happen?

,b90207023,2010-06-13T11:07Z,"hi everyone,

I tried following the instruction carefully..but..still failed..

Should I install first or ""Go"" first?
I tried installing first but it asked me to enter product key or exit.........do I have any way to circumvent that?

Then I tried crack.exe ""Go"" then it showed ""no library client dll found"" 

I think the rightful way should be installing first under trial conditions...like some 30 days without entering any key...and then crack it......

need help.....thanks!!

,Tplane37,2010-11-06T03:41Z,"I had a similar issue as 'sluggervillan' did with the install, and I experienced shere succuss following the same steps as he did.

One thing I will note: I initially used 7-zip to extract  and was unable to locate a ""usable"" file. I then extracted  using WinRAR. I was then able to locate the  and was able to run the installer without issue. This was probably one of the easiest crack tools I have used to date, and worked flawlessly... per the instructions.

For those of you who cannot manage to get the crack tool to work, unplug your keyboard and back away from the computer. You are not worthy of data acquisition or utilization.

And for those genius downloaders that consistently ask stupid questions about ""failed installs""... 99.9% of the Torrents out there have a file named , , or a file of some sort that you NEED to read FIRST, because they tell you what to do before you publicly make a fool of yourself to the world!"

first of all i really thank you for sharing such a wonderful thing but i am having some issues using QB Premium 2010 like:
its using avg costing in inventory that can ruin my work and secondly it gives less liberty to make amendments and back of the screen data access.

so using this medium i wonder if you can share the SAGE peachtree Quantum software + Keys???

will really appreciate ...

Thanks"

,venomhed,2010-11-18T02:59Z,"Hello,

Quickbooks Pro & Premier R9 (11-17-2010 tested) WORK, however not just with this patch.

I had to use a combo of the Enterprise Patch on the net AND Beasts to get around the annoying Registration screen after 30 days.

Tested this out:

Downloaded QB 2010 Premier & Pro R9 on 11/17/2010

Installed either

Used this key for Pro or Premier (General, Contractor, didn't matter for Premier on first run):
License Number: 1063-0575-1585-222
Product Number: 016-376

Did NOT start QB at end of install.

Made sure no QB processes were running in Task Manager

Applied QB 2010 Enterprise Patch: patch1 (I had this a long time ago 2008, not sure where I got it, file size is 18kb called ""patch.exe"" and was associated with the 2008 Enterprise version of QB.

Chose GENERAL Edition, worked fine.
(I did this again and chose Contractor, ok too! Did not try other like Accountant, POS)

QB Started - Checked Help, About, 420 licenses

Noticed Begin Registration in Help was still active. *Even if the 30 day trial timer expires, you will only get a message about registration and can click Register Later. You have to do this every time when it reaches 0. Or you can use the Patch 2 (Beast) (Optional)

Start Patch2 (Beast), click Go, start Quickbooks, choose Help, Begin Registration, it will go to Activate By Phone, enter 99999930, Register. It will say Product Registered.

Exit QB, Close Beast Patch.

Start QB, Help, About, Still 420 Licenses, No Registration Option on menu.

Choose Update Quickbooks and DISABLE AUTOMATIC UPDATES."

,kiyoshi67,2012-02-09T22:25Z,"To those having problems with the ""setup must restart to continue"" loop: 
Extract the ""QuickBooksPremier2010.exe"" file. Run the Setup.exe file from there.

To anyone having the install program hang right when it starts to install:
My computer would just ding and hang, and most times it wouldn't give me an error. But when an error comes up, it complains about network access to msxmlemu.msi, which doesn't exist. 

Solution:
Go to \QuickBooksPremier2010\QBooks and run the ""msxml.msi"" file, and select the option to remove/uninstall.
Now install from setup.exe again, and install should work fine. (Setup crashed for me on the ""install complete"" screen, but seems to run fine after activation.)

,Voltarus,2012-03-25T18:43Z,"I took a long time to create an account to post this so I hope some one is listening.

Before I run any crack I always run the crack.exe file through an online virus scanner called Jotti that checks the file against about 20 different virus scanners. These are the results:

http://virusscan.jotti.org/en/scanresult/c2a12cf072dd276f8b14b9fb63da7df6f66fb6e7/d7ad7e6c3b7c812f1b5b7361387ed349846c08e1

The crack reg file that you have to run to crack the program has a virus in it. I am aware that cracks are sometimes picked up on virus scanners as ""hacktools, etc"". Usually when that happens the virus scanners says it is a crack tool or whatever. As you are probably going to be using this program to host a multitude of banking information and passwords I encourage you not to download this file as it is simply not worth the risk. I am not going to be using this crack. I hope I save someone a lot of misery. Good day."
