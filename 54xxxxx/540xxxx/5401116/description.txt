Reclaiming the Blade celebrates the culture and craft of swords and the Hollywood legends and academic warriors who wield them. 
The film explores the Medieval and Renaissance blade; a profound and beautiful object handcrafted by master artisans of old. 
Today, much of the history of the sword remains cloaked under a shadow of legend. 
Reclaiming the Blade highlights todayâ€™s cinematic tribute to the beauty and necessity of the sword through films such as 
 Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Chronicles of Narnia and The Pirates of the Caribbean.
