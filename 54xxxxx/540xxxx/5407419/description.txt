Football Manager 2010: Goals from Corners

You should probably remember from the post First Premier League season came to the end that David Prieto (my DC) became the best Leeds scorer with 8 goals. Today I would like to tell how I achieved that amount of goals from corners in Football Manager 2010. It was a result of many experiments during the first two seasons. And I have to confess it was quite complicated to find efficient way to score goals from corners. I tested many cases and found one at last.
