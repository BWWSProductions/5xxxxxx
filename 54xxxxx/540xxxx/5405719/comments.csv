,tommcd,2010-03-18T17:58Z,"Thanks a lot Bubanee!! This is a good album. It has that ""live in the studio"" sound, which to my aging ears sounds much better than the  over-produced overdubbed recordings of today.
I especially like the versions of ""Hear My Train a Comin"", and ""Sunshine of your love"". Highly recommended for any Hendrix fan!"
,tommcd,2010-03-18T18:29Z,"Oh, and I almost forgot about the 12 minute slow ... blues .... version of ""Red House"". Sure, there are many Hendrix recordings of Red House out there; but he never played the same notes twice you know! I am always happy to hear one more Hendrix performance of Red House.
I am happy to still be seeding this also!!!"
