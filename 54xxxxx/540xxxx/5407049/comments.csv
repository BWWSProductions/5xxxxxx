[V],twentyforty,2010-03-03T18:45Z,"@mattbdon: Funny, 'cause I have it maybe a year ago... tried to watch (two eps) but deleted afterward. Yeah, today is almost impossible to download this show, but believe me, nobody cries. Listen... a bunch of people have stayed cryogenicaly frozen from leakage of ten inches long container - in the tunnel, in the train wagon and miraculously woke up after maybe twenty years and whole world has been gone. Than they've managed to get out and wander through the empty towns controlled by zillions of pretty mad dogs.
C'mon, no one's memories can't be so pink about the Grenada UK show from 1999."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-03T19:09Z,"@mattbdon: Oh, I still have that torrent, and just checked - still working, three seeders, 2.04GB all six eps. If you need it, drop me some secondary, public e-mail address or I can put it INSIDE one my torrents (that torrent). Just say a word."
