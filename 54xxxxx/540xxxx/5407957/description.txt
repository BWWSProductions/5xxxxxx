Hidden.&.Dangerous.Deluxe.PC.Game(djDEVASTATEâ„¢)


An updated release comprising of Hidden & Dangerous and it's expansion pack, Devil's Bridge. The update consists of an included editor to modify the missions included, improved graphics, and slightly modified missions (new enemy patrol paths etc).

The update did not affect gameplay. Hidden & Dangerous is still a matter of partially planning the actions of your SAS-team, and playing as one of those brave people to complete the missions as a team. The total of episodes is 9, which hold 32 missions. Your chance of survival are dictated by your ability to use the proper tactics at the right moment, not by being the fastest gun in town. A number of useful tactics are explained in the manual.
