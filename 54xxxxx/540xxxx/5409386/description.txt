Review

A thoughtful, humbling, and full-hearted film that makes it clear the destiny of whale populations must matter to us all. --Jury Citation, Vermont International Film Festival
 
Product Description

Weaving together natural history and biography, A LIFE AMONG WHALES delves deeply into the unique relationship between humans and whales as told by renowned whale biologist Dr. Roger Payne. For four decades Payne has advanced the boundaries of science and activism - beginning with his pioneering work on whale songs in the 1970's to his study of ocean pollution today. With beautiful and haunting imagery, the film forces us to question our stewardship of the Earth and our coexistence with some of its most intriguing creatures.
