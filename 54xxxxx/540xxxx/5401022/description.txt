Keys to Ascension is the video release of a concert by the progressive rock group Yes  recorded live at the Freemont Theater in San Luis Obispo, California in March 1996. It marked the first set of Yes concerts to feature keyboardist Rick Wakeman and guitarist Steve Howe since 1991, and the first to feature this exact five-piece lineup since 1979. The three concerts with the newly reunited lineup were followed by two double albums entitled Keys to Ascension featuring all new material alongside live tracks from the San Luis Obispo shows.
