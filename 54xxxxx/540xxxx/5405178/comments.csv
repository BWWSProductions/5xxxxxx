,Mcwierdo,2010-08-08T21:01Z,"""Install patc 1.55 located in ""Patch and Keygenerator"" in the Iso-image!""

Patch 1.55? The Uplink Website says that the latest patch is version 1.54.

Suspicious... Very suspicious..."

,Morpheus009,2011-01-07T02:24Z,"I press the setup.exe and nothing happens, it's running on my PC, but there's nothing appearing."
,corey6969,2011-02-10T07:09Z,ya it didnt work in my win 7 64 bit either  dam
,jeeboy,2011-02-23T16:22Z,"Here's how to get it to work on 64 bit Windows 7:

Download and install Uniextractor at: http://legroom.net/software/uniextract

Mount or burn the image, open the DVD, go to install folder and right click on data1.cab and click Uniextract files...

Extract the files to the folder you want the game to install into. Go into that folder and run uplink.exe

Presto!

If anyone wonders why this happens it is because the setup uses 16 bit components that cannot be emulated on 64 bit OS. Unlike the installer, the game itself is 32 bit so windows emulates it automatically."
