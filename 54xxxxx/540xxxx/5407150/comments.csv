,solegamer,2010-03-03T18:40Z,how is this different from the 100kb one?
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-03T18:46Z,"No ide. I downloaded this from a ""release page"" tho."
,5468741,2010-03-03T19:55Z,Will this fix still work if you only have disc 1? I followed the directions but the .bat keeps giving me errors. 
,ShinoBoy,2010-03-03T20:52Z,"@ 5468741, yes, you can get it to work for just the first disc by manually editting the .bat file. Open it in Notepad and delete the following line: ApplyPPF3 a all-ff13-disc2.iso all-ff13-disc2-fix.ppf

Then when you run it, it won't try to apply the disc 2 fix to the non-existant disc 2 iso 

And the 100k one is extracted (whereas this one has the ppf and bat files in a rar file)"
,aymanbashir,2010-03-03T22:19Z,plz confirm if it works on ntsc\j consoles....
,john5246,2010-03-05T05:56Z,"I'm a little lost here:

This is to make it so that if you're system is 1.6 iXtreme and can't do wave 4 right? Because when I insert disc 2 is says you're insterted the wrong disc. But you must insert the disc at that moment you can't go to the dashboard insert the ""Activate iso"" disc and continue, it wants you to put the 2nd disc in right when you're at the end scene on the doc with the girl. 

Is that what this fix is for? "
,john5246,2010-03-05T08:49Z,"To anyone with the same problem, just use ""360 waves Patcher"" or ppf-o-matic, I used the former and it was very easy comes with all the files. You can search for it on here, once it's patched to wave 3 just insert DISC 2 and it'll work. "
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-05T12:02Z,all new games far as i know. Is wave 6-7 for now on. Next i guess is wave 8. Until MS gets that wave protections is usless for IX LT (Dont read waves).
