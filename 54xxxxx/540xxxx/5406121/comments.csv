Why? Because she went to Canada for free socialized health care. You know, the kind the evildoers are getting... ? 

It's true! 

I bet she used to be a community organizer too!
They have communities in Alaska in need of organizing, don't they? 

Anyhoo, Leno has already had Rush Limbaugh on a while back. He got some help from the Canadians too you know. 
Now all Jay needs now is to book that sobbing weasel Glenn Beck and his male counterpart; Ann Coulter (you know her from Frasier - she played Maris) to come on his show 
and the circle will be complete - a perfect death panel. 

Better throw in Sean Hannity in there too, to make things fair and balanced. Oops, wrong network. Tee hee. "
