,lozoya2,2010-04-15T07:51Z,one person is seeding. Thank you one person!
,top0dk,2010-06-18T03:45Z,"Any One have seed for this nice collection??
There is over 90+ people stock on 93.xx%...
Please HELP!"
,TPB2007206,2010-06-20T14:37Z,"The problem ist that the seeder (hardliner?) is sending corrupt/broken chunks! utorrent drops the data because of invalid hashes!

@Seeder, please check the integrity of your files! It may be better to recreate the torrent and upload it again. People at 93,6% can recheck their files and continue with the new torrent."
,KapteinFruit,2010-08-02T13:30Z,Seed for fuck sake. If you're going to let someone download something then you better seed. It stopped at 93% It's been at 93% for about 24 hours now! Seed!
,KapteinFruit,2010-08-08T13:30Z,"Can you fucking seed!? It's been six days without anyone seeding faster then 0,1Kb/s. You're the worst uploader I've ever downloaded anything from. GTFO off TPB asshole."
,jony_pera,2012-04-25T17:42Z,How great! Nobody seeding!
