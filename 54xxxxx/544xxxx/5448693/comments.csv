,JPeterson,2010-03-22T03:26Z,Did they add film grain to this movie? The picture looks grainier than Public.Enemies.720p.BluRay.x264-METiS.
,bradcav,2010-03-22T07:07Z,I'm pretty sure Micheal Mann (director) added the grainy look for effect

,boxorats,2011-08-09T06:42Z,This was mostly shot on digital cameras; I think the 'graininess' is more from the low light levels at which much of the film was shot. (Thanks for the movie!)

THANK YOU AOLOFFLINE!!!"
