,Mercyflush64,2010-03-18T18:33Z,What is the file extension for this? I can't get it to open.
,Profitel,2010-03-18T20:31Z,"I have a problem!
When I make 1 file with Total Commander I have an unknow file: rzr-daoa.
What I need to do now? :S"
,Profitel,2010-03-18T20:55Z,"No problem, that's good. =)"
,LynMa,2010-03-19T05:59Z,"If you have a file extension, just rename rzr-daoa to rzr-daoa.7zip and extract.

Donc try with winrar cause it'll ask you rzr-daoa.r00 after 1 or 2 secs.

Was my only issue, did that and now, it works perfectly, thanks a lot for this torrent !"

,snoopdog2,2010-03-20T16:26Z,"There seems to be a corrupt file, it stops after about 2 min. Had same issues with other DA Awakening torrents. Sucks!"
,loranthis,2010-03-21T08:37Z,"Does not work, I did change the extension but the CRC check has failed. Fake."

,jakep1337,2011-01-03T03:08Z,"Thanks a bunch for the download, installed played for a few hours. now i'm back to say thanks. yet another awesome game from you. @ all of the dumb asses that don't know what they're doing... get of the computer and stop begging for help it's pathetic. use google, figure it out on your own. it's not rocket science, only computer science. /)_-"
,jakep1337,2011-01-03T03:10Z,"wrong torrent. go to the other torrent of ""razor1911"" not this joker. imposer."
,altrego99,2011-08-11T21:51Z,"Alright I figured it out. By Andraste's sodding ashes, whoever uploaded this does not know a rat's arse of uploading files. Initially there were 47 different files which were .rars, but before the upload they were joined together into one big piece of mess.

To successfully install this, all you need to do is split into parts of size 500000000 bytes each. You will get 47 parts, and they will unrar using either winrar or 7zip - smoothly _without_ crc failure into the fucking iso. Can install from there and play."
