If this copy is NOT made for release in the US or UK, the spoken & subtitled Language will be in Swedish.  SO??? what about some info like the spoken language for this download.... IMDB shows that there are 25 different countries that this is being released to so there are as many different Languages too. A little feedback would be appreciated."
