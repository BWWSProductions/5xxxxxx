Unusual album. Favourite tracks 'Mothra' and 'Aliens'

The Crash of '47 was the first and only studio album released by the American experimental metal band Atomship. It was released on May 4, 2004 and was produced by Dave Fortman (Evanescence, Superjoint Ritual). The song "Time for People" was released on the Wind-Up soundtrack for the movie The Punisher. The one and only single off of "The Crash of '47", is "Pencil Fight".
Atomship stand out from others in the genre with a unique blend of wistful balladry, complex time signatures, and ferocious hard rock.
