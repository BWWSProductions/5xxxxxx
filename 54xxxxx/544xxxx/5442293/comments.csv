,bapcules,2010-03-18T13:28Z,"Sind die ""Gold"" Inhalte schon im Game integriert ?"
,Provocateur,2010-03-18T13:52Z,Thanks a lot. But please tell me Are there DLCs currently ON disk?
,valper,2010-03-18T15:01Z,"pretty please,or is this the same game as was released in march 2009"

,Provocateur,2010-03-18T15:09Z,"86 of people downloading this game already, but no one knows for sure is there those f**g DLC's!"
,scandle616,2010-03-18T16:29Z,its all on 1 disk according to game.com and iv seen nowhere that you need live so im sure its all on there i downloaded episode 1 from live and its just an extra menu under new game and chapters and all that 
,scandle616,2010-03-18T16:31Z,i dont think you can play versus  without live by the way but evrything else you dont need live for
,-OLDBOY-,2010-03-18T19:52Z,I heard you just get codes for the DLC in Gold and have to download them from Live. Hope that's wrong though. Can someone confirm?
,Eyepatch-Joe,2010-03-18T23:06Z,"I own the Original, its basically just a repress of the disc with the word gold added to the cover, disc and manual. on the back of the manual is an Xbox live redeem code that lets you download all the extra content free in one go, so yeah this version is no more gold than the old version, no code = no extras"
,axelay3,2010-03-19T08:08Z,"Delete the word GOLD, its just the normal version of RE5, except if you own redeem code!!!!!"
,scandle616,2010-03-19T11:16Z,thats gay just found out on ign u need the code and live but on the ps3 its all on disk guess they cauldnt fit it on disk an 2 cheap to chuck disk 2 in wiv it all on i mean fallout did y cant capcom i thought the idea ov this was for people without live to play the extras i might aswell buy it on live for about 10 15 quid
,Bujaaa,2010-03-19T12:12Z,"So if you have RE5 allready don't bother downloading this because it's only the originall game. And codes for downloading DLC have been used already so they don't work. crap,crap,crap."
,-OLDBOY-,2010-03-19T12:24Z,What scandle616 said.
,ant19831983,2010-03-20T02:20Z,Bastard! Just put it in Xbox just to find out it's the same as the original version nothing different. Don't download.
,dragkhar,2010-03-21T03:16Z,"SAME game, NOTHING has been added, If you were to buy this new you would get the codes to download everything. Only on the ps3 does it have the DLC's on the disk... Damn you Xbox"

,geo0160,2010-04-08T10:34Z,Well even if it doesn't have the dlc maybe it has some minor bug fixes...
,ojam1,2010-04-10T12:50Z,this is only resident evil 5. not gold edtion.
,micnor14,2010-07-31T19:23Z,Confirmed. Damn it.

I'm new at the game content thing, so how does this work exactly? I get this torrent, hook it up to my harddrive and magically I get the whole game on my xbox with no questions asked? I heard that content can't be copied kinda like Disney's movies."
