To make the blackgrey screen dissapear and when u get attacked u wont see sh*T!

These are the settings you need change in the ""global"" setting file to make it all work fine! My Documents\Empire interactive\SST\Settings open up global.settings and these settings below:

PostProcessing: { ""0"" }
Distort: { ""0"" }
DisableSM2: { ""0"" }

Shader Quality (in the game options menu, at most) : MEDIUM
everything else in the ""graphigs menu"" can be set to any thing u want as long u change these things in the ""global"" file! =)

Check out other posts in this forum but this one solved all of my problems
Thanks a lot to noob007 for this post!"
