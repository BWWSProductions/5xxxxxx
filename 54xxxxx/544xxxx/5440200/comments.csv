Does anybody know how I can watch this torrent? When I download it I get a bunch of files that neither VLC or WMP can play. And I really want to watch it! Thank you so much in advance for any help with this :) "

flowerfairy, i should unzip one of the files (click right button, chose unzip and all files will be unzipped and u will get avi file)"
,flowerfairy,2010-03-19T22:30Z,"@ne_rasta,

thanks for the tip! I think this is supposed to work, however, when I try to unzip it, it stops at 97% everytime and then I can't watch it. Do you have any idea what I can do about that? Again, thank you!!"

As of now, I can't watch this episode.  :("
