I've been running it ok with a serial from the keygen,
but unfortunately today, after a month 
I get that it has expired 
and this happens with every other serial I generate
and I get a ""You're using a pirated or banned serial""."
,torrentic,2010-05-02T18:29Z,"Update: after uninstalling & reinstalling it ,
it accepts again serial from the keygen with no problem :) "

Thanks for the info, hopefully we can get someone to remove the call home functionality of the exe so it can't compare the serials."

I using your keygen and download latest version from SyncBackPro homepage. Keygen was perfect!"

,xgman,2011-08-12T17:27Z,Anyone know how to add a line to the windows hosts file to block call homes?
,Lenchanteurmerlin,2011-11-24T22:09Z,"meatieSwe, your loophole works perfectly well.  My syncBack kept asking me for a serial and did not accept the old one, so I did what you suggested and evrything is back in fine territory.

Thanks."
