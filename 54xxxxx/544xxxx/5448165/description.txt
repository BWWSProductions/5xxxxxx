STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN LIVE AT MONTREUX
Label: Epic/Legacy  Released: 2001
Format: Mp3@320



Stevie Ray Vaughan's frenetic Montreux performance is captured here on the guitarist's earliest available live album to feature Double Trouble. David Bowie was in attendance at the 1982 show, and asked Vaughan that night to be his guitarist for the Letâ€™s Dance album and tour. Already an established artist on the Southern blues circuit, Vaughan was initially booed at this '82 appearance as part of a bill featuring "acoustic blues artists." He fittingly opens with Freddie King's "Hide Away" and then plays like a man possessed on "Rude Mood" and "Pride And Joy"
