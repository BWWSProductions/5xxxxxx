Hour 1: 

Another Monday, another massive Wall Street Ponzi scheme uncovered. This one directly involves the FED. Maybe now we can audit the books? 

Police guns end up the hands of Pentagon, and Vegas shooters.... Its all just "incompetence." Riiiiight.

Hour 2: 

Filmmaker David Bond joins us to discuss his award winning film (showing at SXSW in Austin) ERASING DAVID. This "docu-thriller" takes on Big Brother like nothing else before it. In the film, Bond disappears, and dares to be found in an ever growing UK surveillance society... The results are surprising. There's no where to run.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
