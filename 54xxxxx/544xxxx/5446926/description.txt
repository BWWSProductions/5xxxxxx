TED HAWKINS  THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS
Label Geffen 
Orig Year 1994
Format:Flac



This release of The Next Hundred Years contains one bonus track, recorded for a film soundtrack, which was not on the original (1994) release of the album.

1994 found Ted Hawkins breaking through to his largest audience yet with  the release of  this album . Hawkins' first album for a major label. Sadly, on New Year's Day 1995 he succumbed to a massive stroke, leaving this record as his final offering. .

Hawkins is supported by subtle and evocative accompaniment-churchly organ here, a steel guitar there-and the players are understated and perfectly suited to the material. The few covers include "There Stands The Glass," a stirring song that often opened Hawkins' concerts, Jesse Winchester's "Biloxi," and John Fogerty's "Long As I Can See the Light." Ted Hawkins was a big man with a big voice, and the spiritual and emotional shadows he cast here will linger for at least the next hundred years.

Personnel: Ted Hawkins (vocals, guitar); Greg Leisz (lap steel guitar, Hawaiian guitar, pedal steel guitar); Michael Penn, Chris Bruce (guitar); Tony Berg (guitar, keyboards); Martin Tillman (cello); Billy Payne, Patrick Warren (keyboards); John Pierce, Guy Pratt, Kevin McCormick (bass); Pat Mastelotto, Jim Keltner, Greg Wells (drums, percussion); Danny Frankel (percussion).
