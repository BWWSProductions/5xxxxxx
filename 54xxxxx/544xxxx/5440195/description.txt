       For those that are struggling with getting a handle       
     on Identity Management in their enterprise, Alex        
     Weinert, Principal Group Program Manager, Identity      
     Management, provided me with an Id Element            
      interview on the subject that may be of great help       
     to you. Alex first provides a background on             
     evolution of the synchronization products on the        
       Microsoft platform and then provides an excellent         
       whiteboard session on how Forefront Identity              
     Manager (FIM) 2010 (formerly known as Microsoft         
     code name ILM 2) builds on these to provide           
     significant new identity management capabilities.       
      Built on the .NET 3.5 technologies, FIMs web            
     services, workflow and portal provide a range of        
     extensibility opportunities from the enterprise/ISV     
       developer to the codeless capabilities offered to         
       the IT Pro in the portal itself. If you want to
