SONNY ROLLINS SONNY ROLLINS  VOLUME 1
Label: Blue Note
Original Released:1956
Format:Flac


Often lost and forgotten in the mix of spectacular albums saxophonist Sonny Rollins made for the Prestige label in 1956 (including "all-time" sets Saxophone Colossus and Tenor Madness) and his second Blue Note effort, Sonny Rollins Vol. 2 (1957), considered by some to be Rollins' greatest album of all, Sonny Rollins Vol. 1 is nevertheless an indelible piece of work. It would stand out in almost any other musician's canon (or even in a different era of Rollins' career).

During the 60s Sonny kept expanding his style with almost every album, showing his capacities. He kept recording over the next decades, even appearing on the Rolling Stones' Tattoo You album in 1981 (Slave and Waiting On A Friend).
