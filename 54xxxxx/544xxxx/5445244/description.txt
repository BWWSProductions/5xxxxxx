Release Notes:

Musically speaking, it almost seems a contradiction that a band capable of
generating the sweeping modern rock of the song "Letting You Go" could
also summon the visceral groove of "Take It All Away". But that
channelling of both the tough and the tender might not be as difficult to
comprehend if you spend time out on the West Texas plains, where most of
the band grew up. Those wide-open spaces tend to create an awareness of
life's extremes - a journey that can either make a person close up
tightly or, as Faktion has, become as grand and glorious as the space
itself.

It's a reupload from a different torrent site. I'm seeding until ratio reaches level 5.

Happy listening!
