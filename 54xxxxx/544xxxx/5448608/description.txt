How can a child be born first, and then his or her mother? Seems not only illogical, but also unnatural. The Gurbani does not indicate to give backing to unnatural birth. Then what is it the Gurbani is talking about here? The majority of us conduct ourselves through broken or conditioned consciousness that is no more Intact ( i.e., consciousness that is no more Total, Original, Holistic or "Saabat"). In the aforementioned Shabad â€” which is impregnated with spiritual suggestions â€” Baabaa Kabeer Sahib talks about many other "strange" things. He draws our attention to them and also challenges us to understand their purport. Following is the full text of this Shabad, first with just word-meaning in English (which is not its real gist), followed by an attempt to understand its purport.
