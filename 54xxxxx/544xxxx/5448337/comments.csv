[V],BOZX,2010-03-20T21:24Z,"@rttlesnke : fool may be you 
its not the indians from india downloading
outside india there exists some crore indians too....
they have also got bandwidth.
and the Indian torrents gets dead fast mostly due to Ignorance.
If every one keeps seeding then i thing we will have more strengthy torrrents."
