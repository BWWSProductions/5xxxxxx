A hard-to-find collection of the French singer that was popular in late 60s - early and mid 70s. Her voice was described as "angelic voice" and "voice of a siren". This compilation does not include, for some reason, her most famous piece "Concert for One Voice". I'm planning to post it later. Enjoy!
