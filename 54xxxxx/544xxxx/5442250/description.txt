 pioneers--Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack who rose from     
 immigrant poverty through personal tragedies            
 persevering to create a major studio with a social      
 conscience.

  This movie is one of those that is a complete amalgam of     
  different sources. The main movie was recorded at 29.97      
  fps, but there are quite a few clips that they use that      
  were recorded at 23.976 fps. As a result, we encoded this    
  as a hybrid to take care of most of that.                    
                                                               
  Also, they decided for whatever reason to make this a        
  widescreen movie but use a metric fuckton of 1.33 clips. It  
  looks retarded, but oh well.
