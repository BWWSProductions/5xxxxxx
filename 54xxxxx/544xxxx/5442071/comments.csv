,tibrusjer,2010-03-18T19:24Z,That's 'cause he copied the whole CD instead of just the files that were in them.
,Sikysakis,2010-03-18T19:28Z,If my memory serves me correct the full disc had CD audio in it.

,mistergroenevingers,2010-05-30T23:21Z,"unfortunately this doesn't run on windows 7 x64
not even in compatibility mode for xp sp2
also the image i burned to disc appears to be useless, but that may simply be due to windows not recognizing it
strange though"

,jvdw87,2011-04-25T17:08Z,"Works like a charm, thanks!

To anyone who does not get it to work on new Windows versions: Use DOSBox.

Install manual:
1. mount image or burn it onto a cd and put into cd drive.
2. Start DOSBox
3. Mount your hard drive as drive X, and the cd or image as drive Y
4. Go to drive Y and type 'setup'
5. Install the game to a folder on your hard drive.
6. Set up sound and music
7. Quit setup, the path will be automatically set to the game path
8. Start the game by typing 's2' and pressing enter
Have fun!

When you quit and want to start again, just start DOSBox, mount your drive as X, navigate to the Settlers 2 map and type 's2' to start."
,ssaamm8,2011-04-29T01:54Z,that DOSbox keeps telling me that any drive BUT Z:\ doesn't exist. pretty anoying!
