[V],Iznogoud9,2010-03-21T11:52Z,"*** IMPORTANT ***

I just found out that the software I used for creating this image didn't make a proper layer break, which is needed for burning on a double layer DVD. The image works flawlessly when I mount it in a virtual drive (Daemon Tools), but I have no way of testing if it would work properly if burned onto a DVD and used on a standalone player.

I suggest that you build a new disc image from the VIDEO_TS folder inside this image using ImgBurn, which creates a layer break. Better safe than sorry.

Sorry for the inconvenience caused to y'all!"

I'm going to rebuild it and also sync the other languages, then burn another one. If someone is interested of the new img-file, make a note on some of my newer UL's or here. This is coming up more and more. I did the same misstake with the first ""Volver"". But this raw-materiel is great, so thanks again. "
