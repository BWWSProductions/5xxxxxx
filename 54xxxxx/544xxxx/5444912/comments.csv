"

,jeton2k9,2010-06-04T22:06Z,plz reupload pics cos the link is dead
,treckostic,2010-06-05T08:49Z,Screens are included in the torrent guyz
,sebunisa,2010-06-16T18:41Z,3.57 gb and no screenshot???what da fuck?? 
,coolash007,2010-07-31T17:18Z,"Don't download his torrents, virsus.

also motherfucker puts his ad links instead of screens."
,haydn70ac,2010-11-02T13:05Z,TPB now gives Out Green (VIP) Skulls to Spammers.  Too many fuck heads running TPB now.  Try http://www.1337x.org/  instead.  Better torrent site without the 'VIP' Spammers 
,haydn70ac,2010-11-02T13:07Z,And thank you 'poison17' for doing what amanrulz should have done.  
,weeer2,2010-11-07T03:55Z,"Guys, whats up with you? Screens are inside of torrent."
,Damien74,2010-11-08T02:23Z,"Why do you write comments when you have no idea what you're talking about. So the link is dead, just download the pictures from the torrent first then! Theres your screens you dumb asses.
Virus? No, its pics and videos. Coolash007 is not a real user BTW."
,Bob__Dole,2010-11-21T20:24Z,"We need a rule on TPB that any torrent without WORKING screens gets deleted 2 days after the links fail (Or immediately if it is posted w/o links at all).

Screens inside a torrent is BAD!  It takes 30 times as long just to figure out if you want the video compared to just clicking a link (4 seconds).

Why is this bad?  Because it makes every individual person do redundant work.  There's an old saying, ""if you're going to do something, do it right"".

... and who are you kidding, if all the torrents without screenshots disappeared it wouldn't matter, porn is being made today at a rate faster than you could ever download and watch it all."
,slvrdragn76,2010-12-19T19:43Z,why is it that anything from brazzers something goes wrong with it when i burn it on to a dvd but plays perfectly on my computer 
,slvrdragn76,2010-12-19T19:45Z,why is it that something goes wrong with stuff from brazzers when i try to burn it but works great when play from my computer
,travishb2,2010-12-25T10:28Z, slvdrgn76 you need to transcode it to dvd format using something like convertxtodvd. Just burning the file to a dvd wont work. 
,downloadmeee123,2010-12-26T20:33Z,screens dont work!!!!!!!!! ;(
,fetpipan,2011-02-10T17:29Z,If this is what turns you on then you are really f'cked up
,ninline,2011-02-16T19:07Z,It's amazing how stupid people can be.  If you can't figure out how to just download the screens without downloading the entire torrent then maybe you should just take your ass to a pay pr0n site.  I wont even try to explain newsgroups to ya.
,rdanlord,2011-04-30T02:26Z,"I personally don't check the screens before downloading. I like the element of surprise. If I don't like the download, I delete it. Simple as that. Screens don't tell you everything anyways. However, I can see that screens matter if you have a download rate of 28.8 bps."
