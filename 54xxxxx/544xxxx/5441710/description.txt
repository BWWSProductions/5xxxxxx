  Release Description:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Based on factories' manufacturing and colleges' teaching experience, 
   Nanjing Swan Software Technology Company developed the following software: 
   FANUC, SIMUMERIK, MITSUBISHI, GSK, HNK, KND, WA,SKY,HAAS,GREAT,RENHE,FAGOR,
   DASEN, and simulation software. Through which, we can attain the aim of 
   enabling students to have the experience of practical manipulation on a 
   largely-reduced cost.
 
   Swan series NC simulation software can be furthere devided in 8 major types, 
   47 systems and 85 controlling panels. Equipped with FANUC, SIMUMERIK, 
   MITSUBISHI, GSK, HNC, KND, WA,SKY,HAAS,GREAT,RENHE,FAGOR,DASEN software, 
   swan NC simulation software can help students to learn operation of NC 
   milling tool, lathe and machining center of each system. Meanwhlie CAM NC 
   program can be programmed or read in by manual. By internet teaching, 
   teachers can have the first-hand information of their students current 
   operation information.
