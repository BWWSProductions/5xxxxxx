However, assuming this is the ep that aired on the 19th (the day before you upped this) this is episode 4. Series premier was a double ep."
,Vid_Pillager,2010-03-20T09:11Z,Thanks for another UL guys! @ schizogeny There are only 3 episodes available on PB and that is including the premier (episodes 1 and 2)
[V],err0001,2010-03-20T10:25Z,"Whether or not this should be labelled as S01E04, here is what is true:

The 700MB S01E01 is 1:29:07 long and was aired on March 5, 2010. Various sites give episode names of ""Red Door/Paint It Black"".

The S01E03 file (that I uploaded) labelled as The.Bridge.S01E03.The.Fat.Lady.Sings.the.Blues.XviD-err0001.avi is 41:26 long and was aired on March 12, 2010.

The S01E03 file from NoTV is 40:42 long and was aired on March 19, 2010. The episode name seems to be ""The Unguarded Moment"".   "
