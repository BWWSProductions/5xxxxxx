"
,kodikos,2010-04-05T19:25Z,it's in spanish?or what?
[T],nlx_78,2010-04-12T18:04Z,"It does work. Even after updating. You really need to unplug your cable, install the kis9.0.0.736en.exe. And yes, the other file would probably be spanish with ES in the name. 

Install as said in the text. But be sure to select a key (i tried 2, number one failed, number two was ok. So don't stop at trying. Just be sure that you select a key from the right folder. KAV9 is probably for the spanish one, you need it from this one: KIS9.

,Scattysit,2010-04-17T22:53Z,Well I picked a key for 3 month trail....
,rmb502,2010-05-03T13:01Z,"Worked perfectly according to the instructions. Great upload, thank you."
,sanchezesterecords,2010-05-03T21:00Z,Good Job!!!!!! Works perfectly
,BoredOuttaMySkull,2010-05-04T03:01Z,any help with the update? it won't download the update for the obsolete database...should I worry about that?
,Jedibezy,2010-05-04T19:59Z,"Scanned with a legit copy of Kasper, 100% clean. Followed the instructions to a T, got everything working. Once you backonline, update. Some of the keys are expiring, but if you managed to make it this far, then I'm sure you'll be able to find more keys when the time comes."
,nukestrike,2010-05-10T00:40Z,It keeps freezing mid install!!!!
,klw5688,2010-05-12T04:23Z,ok guys i got it installed but the entire thing is in spanish... any idea what i did wrong or what i can do to fix it? or do i need to reinstall it in english?
,not.perfect,2010-05-15T01:50Z,"Hi guys, the spanish its not a problem.

i've done everything, but when i get a key that works, the option to proceed still appears as disabled. Someone can tell me what is going on, i get the key activated, like 3 days, 224 days, but then i have to go back or to cancel it."
,Mdawg20,2010-05-17T07:58Z,"At first this appeared to work, then it said the license was not good.  When I tried to add a different license, none of them worked."
,James_Uno,2010-05-21T09:40Z,extracted zipfile and followed instructions but I can't seem to install the software correctly. A error message keeps popping up midway and directs me to restart my computer....any ideas? help?
,sentient1,2010-05-27T18:07Z,"installs fine.. accepts the Serial, gives me 389 day or something, but always fails to update.

FORGET THIS ONE>> DOES NOT UPDATE"
,pixie1966,2010-06-03T16:17Z,"Ignore the troll, this works just fine, installed perfectly, updated perfectly. But a good few keys are starting to get blocked. But then that was inevitable :p"

,spiedey,2010-06-10T11:46Z,"i realy want to know if the updates work...
becuz without the update function it isn't a good antievirus

,Timohept,2010-06-12T15:07Z,"It would really be nice if people would share which keys did not work (were blocked after update), so we all don't have to try each and every one of them. I tried 2 of them and both failed and each install/uninstall takes too much time, especially when there are 20 or so more keys to test. Unfortunately, I don't remember exactly which ones I used. I'll let you guys know if my next one works, and if not, which one you shouldn't waste your time with.

,Timohept,2010-06-12T19:15Z,"Finished trying them all. Either I'm doing something wrong, or they just don't work anymore, not after the updates at least. Wasted all my time so you guys don't have to. =P"
,EUGIIII,2010-06-17T10:33Z,"Guys,in case you didn't know -YOU DON'T NEED  KASPERSKY KEYS , ANY KIND OF ACTIVATION OR ANY TRIAL RESET APPLICATIONS. Whenever you're using a full functioning trial version of antivirus (whether you have 30 days or 1 day left) follow my instructions: in kaspersky settings --settings--disable self-defense--exit kaspersky.Open registry (type regedit in RUN ) --navigate to HKEY LOCAL MACHINE\software\kapserskyLab\protected\avp9\environment\pcid. In pcid click modify and  change last three digits with any digits you want .Start kaspersky and activate AGAIN your 30 day trial. You welcome.

,ThePhantomAce,2010-07-02T16:37Z,"As NOT mentioned: This installation-program is entirely in Spanish, and the uploader is a fucking troll!!!!"
,ThePhantomAce,2010-07-02T16:39Z,"Also, this ""tutorial"" doesn't mention anything about how to install it in the first place, but it's pretty easy. Just run the binaries (The .EXE-files) and then do as the instructions says.

But don't go expecting anything to readable in English once installed... Every-fucking-thing is in Spanish!!!!"

,StylesC2,2010-07-05T00:44Z,All you have to do to change it to English is hit Shift+F12 while the program window is open.

,Mikesnype,2010-07-16T08:09Z,"Yep, Shift+F12 does the trick."
,zZcorruptionZz,2010-07-29T22:43Z,Has it dawned on anyone that ES means Espan?ol or whatever and EN means English.... Great upload mate.
,superhero77,2010-07-30T06:18Z,"OK So I didn't see anyone post about what is happening on my end so here goes... 
Followed the instructions to the letter, 
Activated just fine,
updated just fine, 
Scanned and found a virus and deleted it!  Sweet.
Then the key was blocked!!  Ok Suks
(btw that was the third one in the list for KIS09) 

So now I need to try another key but... I can't get the browse for a validation key option to allow me to choose a new key.

Anybody got any ideas or running into the same problem?"
