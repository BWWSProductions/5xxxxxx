almost every time I try to get on TPB.You know the scam where they offer to scan your computer and find a million things wrong with it,and offer to sell you their product to fix everything.Is it just me or are others being hit on?
Thanks 20/40,I know it's off topic."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-18T07:57Z,"@lilars: I use Internet Explorer 7 because I must have-use full functionality of all shenanigans of TPB to upload torrents.
For plain peeking and plain-user-functionality I use FireFox supported by two extensions: Ad-Block Plus and No-Script. Both effectively block all pop-ups and ads.
Further, you've said that you use Avast and now Comodo FW - so do I, and Avast's service Provider-Web Shield and Provider P2P Shield should block even a contact with malware and infected sites/pages.
You also have PeerBlock, right?

I'm telling you all this 'cause you have been guarded pretty heavily. Best way one can. All this programs if perform well, offer achievable level of protection.
BUT...

No program can protect people from - themselves: clicking on ads, praises, offerings, shiny Free signs and banners, ""Congratulations!"" and so fort...

I, myself, also MUST ""Allow HTTP traffic"" in PeerBlock to even access my ""home"" on TPB. My page is blocked (don't ask me why) and eztv on TPB is not. Well, I never forget to activate, disable that Allow AFTER I leave...

What I'm sayin' is: Be careful and be smart."

I guess it must be on my end since I'm the only one.Those shiny ads don't impress me.I schedled peerblock to come on automatically using administrative tools.Internet explorer is set to not allow popups and comodo and avast say everything is fine.But today as I browsed the Bay I got the popup again.It's just a pain in the ass.I will try firefox with the extensions you suggest and see if that solves my problem.
Again thanks."
