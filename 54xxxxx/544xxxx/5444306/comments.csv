A: 6.5

Video is pretty great for a cam. Really enjoyable throughout. (Please note that the graininess of the darker moments is due to the fact that the night scenes of ""Green Zone"" were shot using digital photography in lowlight condition).

The audio is not as good as the video, but every word is perfectly understandable. 

This torrent it great considering the fact that ""The Green Zone"" has just been released to theaters. 
Thanks to .BONE. and all others involved. "
