I would highly recommend the purchase of this album to anyone who is a fan of hip-hop, conscious hip hop in particular, fans of soul music, or to fans like myself of the prolific Dr. West. The guest artists alone are reason enough to buy this album. You don't know what conscious hip-hop is until you hear the work of these Black Men Who Mean Business.
