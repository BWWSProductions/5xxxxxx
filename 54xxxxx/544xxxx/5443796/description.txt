******************The Sims 3 World Adventures NTSC For PC and MAC******************

Like stated in the name of this torrent this is the NTSC or USA version of The sims 3 World Adventures or the PAL/Europe version. I also noticed
that nobody had released a NTSC/USA version of this expansion pack so I have boughten this and released it for you guys.So all of you
Thate have the NTSC/USA version of The Sims 3 you wont get the region code error that you would get from trying to install the PAL/Europe version.
Because I even looked into how to do the region fix so that you can install it and that wouldnt even work for me cause in the registry it says to 
go to like The Sims 3 folder, EA or somthing and it didnt show it up and I wanted to help you guys out.


HOW TO INSTALL

1. Use Winrar to extract the ISO and README and SERIALS.
2. Use a ISO program to mout the ISO on a virtual drive like Power ISO, Ultra ISO, Magic ISO, Alcohol 120%, Ect.
3. Install the expansion pack and when it asks for a serial use one of the ones that are provided in this torrent release.
4. Thats it.


NOTE: This is only the ISO game. There is no NO CD patch or anything included in this release and I have not tested any of the patches or updates
for the game launcher to see if they work.IIf you want to try then and see if they work post your comments below and let us know if it worked for
you or not. It could be possible that you could just mount the ISO image to a virtual drive and play it that way likr High End Loft Stuff Works
but I dont know.

If you want to play this game and have the lastest updates and have EA Download Manager install so that its like your playing the game with the actual disc use the mini image by downloading the torrent here:
