,DaftPunkX,2011-03-05T16:52Z,"This torrent is a piece of shit i wish people would stop writing fake positive comments I tried running it and it says put in the sims 3 late night so i know this isn't working

My computer is running 
Windows 7
AMD Turion Grafix Card
5.0 GHz processor 
180 Gigs HDD
and so on so I know I can play anything look every torrent I have download from here always gives me some hard to do instructions You are better off just buying the game from GameStop don't be a jew just because you want a free game 40 bucks is worth the price of this game and I'm gonna do just that because its guaranteed to work if i buy a store bought copy"

,tgcleader,2011-10-26T07:55Z,@grimreaper2865 casue Sims 3 Ambitions is a later expansion pack and will only require you to use that latest expansion pack disc you have. You can also find the img file or no cd patch for ambitions of you donw what to use a disc. Youll only get a problem when you use a expansion pack disc thats later then ambition but like I said if you find a image file for the latest expansion pack you have and mount it so you dont need the disc and you can keep updating fine and wont have problems.
,tgcleader,2011-10-26T07:57Z,@DaftPunkX I dont know what your talking about this file works fine you must be doing something wrong. Sorry your having problems.
