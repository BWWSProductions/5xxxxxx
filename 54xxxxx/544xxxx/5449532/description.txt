Continent, the long awaited debut full length from Montrealâ€™s CFCF (aka Mike Silver), takes Silverâ€™s musical and visual influences and turns them to song, leading one through varying landscapes and moods.

The album comes to us after a long string of remixes for HEALTH, The Presets, The Teenagers, and Hearts Revolution.

In the time leading up to Continent, he released the Panesian Nights EP and The Explorers single, which featured label-mate and frequent collaborator Sally Shapiro.
