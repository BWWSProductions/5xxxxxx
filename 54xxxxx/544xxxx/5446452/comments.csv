I used Active ISO to burn the CD or Magic Disk to mount

Read the Read Me file included. Also, if you install Winrar, you can extract all iso data to a folder, but I did not test installation that way. I am thinking of remaking the MW iso to 1 big ISO for convenience for all. "

It should be in the dvd crack folder, but if not or you can not find, you can snag one from here

,robertmndt7,2010-06-15T23:01Z,"Can anybody help me?
This is the first time for me to download an illegal game, and I can't figure out how it works.
The ISO-file I got have I unpacked and I tried to install it. Installing worked but when I tried to play the game complained I didn't load a disk. So I loaded it to a virtual disk station, but then it asked again to load a disk. Then I read here to replace the original .exe-file by the crack-one. I did that and loaded the original ISO-file into the virtual disk drive, I started the crack-""shift.exe"" and now it starts the program, starts loading but when it finishes loading it shuts down and windows said ""Program does not work, close"".
Really thanks to the ones who bothered reading my (bad-english) question, and anweres it. Please help me!"
