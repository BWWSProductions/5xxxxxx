If you have a iPod use other programs to import the music that you cant add in iTunes (Such as SharePod)

you WILL be able to play my music in Windows media player/winAMP"

gotta say i love ur dupstep torrents and thanks for uploading

but regarding the itunes things, can we only put them on ipod or is there anyway to make them show up in my libary"
,HardcoreAndMore,2010-08-19T14:08Z,"@soupenstein

Well, as far as i know there is a sort of bug going on in the Borgore .mp3's
I have no idea about the iTunes things, because:

1) i think iTunes sucks
2) i dont use iTunes

Maybe to add them you need yo change the settings of the song.

Cheers,

in iTunes just select the songs and (right)click ""Create AAC Version"".
That should do the trick.."
