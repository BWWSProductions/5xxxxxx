When you're looking to start a business you need cashflow forecasts, budgets, marketing tools, sample letters and forms etc etc.
That's exactly what you get here.
This kit is based around an Australian web developer company. I can't remember where it came from so I can't give credit to the author, but it is not my work.
The tools, however, are pretty good as a starting point to get you well on your way for your business.
Hope you like.
