,akhellbinder,2010-03-17T18:49Z,"The installer works, yes.

If this fixes your problem in the game, i dont know.

This is just for installing without steam."
,akhellbinder,2010-03-17T18:53Z,"Also, i am currently seeding this file. No idea why it says 0 seeders."
,edoglaz,2010-03-17T19:21Z,can any1 explain what to do with this installer? Cause i dont really get it :S
,Monsenhor,2010-03-18T01:50Z,does anyone knows how to use this installer?!?!?!
,plufi,2010-03-18T03:07Z,"lol i don't think anyone can run it... unless u have a dx11 card
my fucking gtx295... isn't"
,darklordofspawn,2010-03-18T11:34Z,"im sorry, i dont quite understand this method of installation.
how exactly do we get this to work?

i un extracted the rars then a cd image came up and...am i supposed to mount it? i dont know what to do with razors installer.

and yeah, i have the steam version."
,akhellbinder,2010-03-18T14:13Z,"@darklordofspawn

Unrar everything, mount the image with your program of choice, place the Razor Installer and setup.dat among the extracted files, and use the razor installer."
,Talc,2010-03-18T17:38Z,"@akhellbinder I unrar it to an iso, Mounted it with Daemon tools. But I don't under stand what to do after that. Help would be much appreciated."
,akhellbinder,2010-03-18T18:05Z,"Extract the game files, to a folder. Take the 2 files in this pack, and put them among the files.

Mount the image with daemon tools, and start the Razor Installer file you just put in the files.

When it asks for some file during the installation, that file is also among the other files, so just point it to the folder you extracted to."
,Talc,2010-03-18T18:23Z,"Ok, I think I understand. I just had to put the install files into the extracted folder and turn that folder into A winrar so I could mount it. Thanks for Fast Replay."
,steve30x,2010-03-18T18:47Z,@ plufi: Oh is that so. Why is it I have the game running with my GTX280 in DX10 mode?
,Hellknite,2010-03-19T17:54Z,"Guys i need a little help since I must be doing something wrong. I downloaded this and got the installer and setup.dat as well as a .rar file containing the same thing.  When I extract it, i get no image file which other people are getting. I may need someone to explain to me every step of the way."
,Hellknite,2010-03-19T18:04Z,I'm using this torrent if it helps http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5434016/Metro_2033_(_2010___English_Russian_German___Steam___NoCrack_)
,pagudpudxiii,2010-03-22T10:31Z,"wait a minute, i see no mountable file here, i only see razor1911 installer and stup.dat. . 
Wtf is happening here? ive been figuring this metro2033 shit for 4 days and nothing is feckin happening! Fuck the steam! Fuck them!"
,serpentsminion,2010-03-22T19:57Z,"I can't seem to get it either.  I tried what akhellbinder said above and still  didn't work.  A window instantly popped up saying 'game installed'   but  it wasn't.   I've tried  remaking the ISO i had with the razor install files included, and chose to run the razor setup file instead of the steam setup- ...  still nothing.   Whatever  trick I try the install still launches a steam  window  asking for me to log in and then wants a serial to activate."
,nitr0fueled,2010-04-02T15:23Z,"CAN SOMEONE PLEASE ANSWER THIS QUESTION.

Do i have to download anything else but this? I have not downloaded any ""metro 2033-stuff"". Do i need the leaked steam version or is it just to download this and play?"
,[LEGEND],2010-04-08T21:27Z,As soon as I click the install button the setup says its complete WITHOUT even asking for the sid files.
,infernal_midget,2010-05-28T09:03Z,hey this is my 1st post but everyone seems to be having a problem with this installer now the way i did it was i dl a app called  magic iso extract the contents to a new folder then put the setup.dat and Razor1911_Installer.exe into the same folder and when it ask for a .sid file jus use the one in the folder where yopu extracted the iso file content
