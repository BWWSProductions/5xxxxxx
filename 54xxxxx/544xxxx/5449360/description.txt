The Unknown War: The greatest battles of World War II, the most colossal encounters of military force, the most devastating human losses which the modern world has ever seen, occurred on Russian soil during 1941-45, on a battlefield that is unknown to most Americans. The conflict between Nazie's Germany and Soviet Union (Russia) claimed more than 30 million lives. 

On the early morning of June 22, 1941, the Nazi Wehrmacht had amassed 4.2 million crack troops along a front that stretched for 1,800 miles, and Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union began. The Nazi high command was extremely confident, expecting the total collapse of Stalin's Russia within six weeks. In reality, The Unknown War raged on for nearly four years. Before it finished, the Nazis and Soviets fought the single greatest campaign in military history. The Unknown War covers that period of history beginning in June 1941, when Germany launched its surprise attack on Russia, through to the end of the war.
