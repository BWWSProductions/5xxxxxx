Bernard Allison totes the same smokinâ€™ six string shooter that his late father Luther Allison assaulted the blues with. And he is blessed with his fatherâ€™s soulful voice, spiritual devotion, and a musical freedom which experiments with the blues. Born in Chicago on November 26th, 1965, the youngest of nine children Bernard was first introduced to the roots of black music and the art of the electric guitar by his father, the late great Luther Allison.
