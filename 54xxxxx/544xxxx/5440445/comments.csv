,MrElectrifyer,2010-08-07T07:59Z,"Works as expected except I am not sure how to add context menu entries for apps made portable.

For example, if I make any Anti Virus App Portable, they always have context menu entries to scan any file.

Does any one know how I can do this? I would really appreciate an answer."

I'm not too sure you should make AV-programs mobile with this. But I have not really checked this out yet.

If this handles drivers and services which are often required by antivirus tools there are simple registry hacks to enable context, but the problem is the application is inside a virtualized bubble and windows explore is not. MS App-V and Citrix XenApp handle this, but they both use an installed client on the machine.

I'll play around with this for a while and might get back with a better answer. I'm a licensed partner with VMWare but TPB is always easier. I'll have to get v4.6 from VMWare if this looks good."
