Death - For the Whole World to See

Death were a proto-punk band from Detroit in the mid 1970s, featuring brothers Bobby, David and Dannis Hackney. They are not to be confused with the 1980s metal band of the same name.

Their hard rock style was unusual for a black band at the time, and although they recorded one album they failed to gain widespread recognition, in part because they refused to sign a recording contract that would require them to change the band's name.

Music critic Peter Margasak retrospectively wrote of their musical direction, "The youngest of the brothers, guitarist David, pushed the group in a hard-rock direction that presaged punk, and while this certainly didnâ€™t help them find a following in the mid-70s, today it makes them look like visionaries."

In 2009, Drag City records released all seven Death recordings on CD and LP under the title "...For the Whole World to See".
