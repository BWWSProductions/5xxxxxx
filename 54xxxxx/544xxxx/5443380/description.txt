MAKING CONTAKT â€“ THE DOCUMENTARY
by Ali Demirel, Richie Hawtin, Niamh Guckian and Patrick Protz


a documentary featuring DJs and performers from the Minus label on a label ten-year anniversary tour.

Interspersed with a running commentary from the artists, friends and backroom staff who made the event possible, itâ€™s a warts â€˜nâ€™ all appraisal of the highs, lows, triumphs and near catastrophes that accompanied the tour, revealing what it takes to get a performance of this magnitude on the road and keep the electronic movement pushing forward.

The show moves through a host of cities before peaking with a spectacle in Amsterdam and a finale in Tokyo. Each venue poses a new challenge and the close-up camera style and subtle juxtaposition of images get to the heart of the matter as the crew battles with a string of problems.
