,Coolinside,2010-03-20T15:32Z,Thanks Buggyboy1 works fine i will keep seeding
,bremster,2010-03-20T16:24Z,"Thanks, it works"
,odderik94,2010-03-20T19:28Z,I youst get another login screen wen i start the game i need help
,buggyboy1,2010-03-21T01:12Z,"@ Dimmis80 - This is not necessary. The included ""Launcher"" folder contains a file named ""launcher.exe"". You can place this folder everywhere you like and make a shortcut to the launcher executable. Hit ""Play"" in order to make the server emulator and game start automatically. Cheers!"
,buggyboy1,2010-03-21T01:51Z,"@ Rezonato - I highly doubt it dude, it's a fake."
,buggyboy1,2010-03-21T01:51Z,@ Coolinside and bremster - You are very welcome. Thank you both for the seeding and special thanks to Coolinside for the referral. Greatly appreciated!
,GoPostal254,2010-03-21T04:43Z,"I'm lost, it says at first when I do the procedure that I have to be at the main screen-->start procedure-->argument must be of type table."
,kewlblue,2010-03-21T08:37Z,Thanks for the patch!
,fleetkid,2010-03-21T08:51Z,"buggyboy1, I still get the login screen at startup. please help. I followed all the steps. "
,Koraun,2010-03-21T10:48Z,"This patch worked great for me. I use Win7 ultimate x64 and I did have the problem with still needing to log in, but it was easily corrected by following this advice from razielblack13, it works like a charm now.

To windows 7 users, and maybe for other OS's, if you are asked for a username and password after you have done the crack there is a simple workaround. Go to %""wind_dir""\System32\drivers\etc find the ""hosts"" file, go to properties, and UNtick the ""read only"" checkbox. Then reapply the patch.
%""win_dir"" is usually C:\Windows "
,Koraun,2010-03-21T11:56Z,"What the other people was saying was that you don't level until after the third mission, meaning at the end of the fourth you should start to level."
,elitegamernl,2010-03-21T12:16Z,"not working for me :(
i first unchecked read-only from the hostfile
then i did the offlien patch as Admin
then i cahnged the @ to a ""."" in the batch file and acc fodler

then i started using custom laucher
the game starts till after the intro video and then it gets pblack screen with a nice C&C 4 cursor

some help please (
(without the crakc i can see the login screen ;P0)"
,fleetkid,2010-03-21T12:57Z,"Koraun, thanks man. works fine. prob was my user account was not having permission for hosts file. Logged on using admin id. 

But AVG Identity protection claims CNC4SERVER.EXE as malware. Going to ignore that."
,Koraun,2010-03-21T13:12Z,"1. Install the game from another torrent
2. If using vista do the thing from my comment above with the ""hosts"" file, so that once you run the game it won't ask for a login
3. Put the offline patch in the install folder and run it, not sure if it needs to be there but I did it and it worked.
4. Put all of the other files from the launcher folder that came with this download into the install directory.
5. Run the game, everything should work fine now, but remember to save the game after the start of each mission due to the bugs with the game saving itself. And for everyone who asks, I did confirm it by playing, you don't level up until the end of the fourth mission, because at the end of the third mission you choose a side to be on."
,Koraun,2010-03-21T13:16Z,"*Edit* on my last post on step 2 I said if using vista, I meant if using windows 7, not sure if vista needs it or not."
,buggyboy1,2010-03-21T22:20Z,"@ GoPostal254 - Please make sure you have administrator privileges and access to the registry. Please upload the image to TinyPic or BayImg and post a link as a comment, so that I know what to fix on future releases. Thanks for sharing!"
,buggyboy1,2010-03-21T22:24Z,@ fleetkid and Koraun - Thanks for sharing your problem. Future releases will have a built in host file read/write check. And also great thanks to Koraun for identifying the problem.
,buggyboy1,2010-03-21T22:26Z,@ elitegamernl - Why exactly did you change those characters? Change those values back and try again please. Thanks for sharing your problem!
,buggyboy1,2010-03-21T22:29Z,@ Dimmis80 - Play through the fourth mission and see if your experience points start rising after the first mission you play for either NOD or GDI. Thanks for sharing your problem!
,gherry9,2010-03-21T23:30Z,I followed Koraun's instructions but when I click on the custom launcher and click play a little black window comes up and that's it nothing else happens. When I click on the original launcher it asks me for my email and password I put the one you guys suggested but it doesn't work. Some help would be much appreciated.
,Koraun,2010-03-22T00:29Z,"@ghery9 The black window is supposed to pop up, as part of it running it's server. Make sure windows firewall isn't blocking the fake c&c server the program uses, and that all the files are moved in correctly, might try reinstalling the game and starting fresh."
,gopolog,2010-03-22T03:29Z,how do you put this game to a disk wen its a 5g file cds only take 800mb and the game wont go on a dvd i tried please any help ????
,Koraun,2010-03-22T03:58Z,"@gopolog you don't burn it to a disk, you use an emulation program like daemon tools or poweriso to make a virtual cd/dvd drive."
,gopolog,2010-03-22T07:46Z,o like magic disk sorry for being so noobish never downloaded a game before done dvds jst never games so not got a clue 
,Daasetryne,2010-03-22T22:28Z,"It's obvious that some people have gotten this working, but I can tell you as much as that I have not. I've followed whatever instructions I've been capable of finding, although most of the instructions out there are rather painful to find. The crack installs, yes, and I'm running it through the launcher that came with it. The launcher doesn't even launch the game for me now, it just starts the emulator. I tried running the game from the install folder after having started the emulator with the launcher, but that only gives me an error which is so long that I cannot display all of it on my screen.

Right now I'm uninstalling, just so I can try to reinstall again, but it's taking a good 30 minutes to do as EA has some sick fetish with making even their installers hellish to work with.""Validating install""... Why can't it just remove the bloody thing already?!

Sorry, I needed to rant, it's been a bad day.

Could someone kindly post a proper install guide?"
,buggyboy1,2010-03-22T23:04Z,"@ Daasetryne - Try opening the game from the ""/Data"" folder by first opening ""CNC4SERVER.exe"" and then ""RunCNC4.eng.bat"" if you have not already done so. Also, please make sure you run the offline patch with admin privileges. Please keep me posted and thanks for the feedback!"
,buggyboy1,2010-03-22T23:24Z,"@ Dimmis80 - Great to hear it's working out for you! Oh and about the sound problem, it could be your computer set to surround sound and the game to two speakers or something like that. Just check your sound settings. Should not be crack related."
,buggyboy1,2010-03-22T23:27Z,"@ gopolog - Yes, MagicDisc is a great alternative to Daemon Tools. Good luck and enjoy the game!"
,Awoken_one,2010-03-22T23:30Z,"I have a problem,the loader work fine but just when the first animation completes the game says online connection has been lost and want's a login-email and password.Could it be something with fire wall,or NOD32 or Spybot?"
,buggyboy1,2010-03-22T23:58Z,"@ Awoken_one - Yes, could be your firewall blocking connection to your local IP-Address. Please disable your firewall, try again and post the results. Thanks!"
,Koraun,2010-03-23T03:20Z,"@Daasetryne If you have installed the crack properly and moved ALL of the files from both the launcher folder in the crack download AND the offline patch folder it should have a play button that launches both the black windows and the game. If you have not copied all of the files from both directories into the install folder then it won't work, you need the dll's and the resource folder and what not. That was my problem at first was that I missed copying one of the files, after that it worked like a charm."
,Awoken_one,2010-03-23T11:06Z,"Does not work,lowered all firewalls and still the same message: ""Unexpectedly disconnected from online services.Please check your internet connection"". Any ideas? Does the server need a port?"
,Koraun,2010-03-23T11:33Z,"@Awoken_one  I would suggest looking at your router to see if that is the problem maybe, but not sure if it would be. Go to your router and put your comp on DMZ(De-Militarized Zone) to see if your router is the problem. If that works then take yourself off of DMZ and then find out which port needs to be open or what is blocking it."
,buggyboy1,2010-03-23T13:11Z,"@ Koraun - First off, thank you for all the feedback on other users! Important to know is that as long as all the files in the ""Launcher"" and ""Offline Patch"" folder are intact, you can place them anywhere you like. They use the registry to locate the game."
,Awoken_one,2010-03-23T13:18Z,"Ok,I got the game to work.I had to use another crack in addition to this one."
,buggyboy1,2010-03-23T13:30Z,"@ Awoken_one - This should not have been necessary, please tell me what you did in addition to applying my crack?"
,Awoken_one,2010-03-23T14:00Z,Was for me.I applied the crack from SPIRE(It has a changed CNC4SERVER and RunCNC4.eng file)
,buggyboy1,2010-03-23T14:18Z,"@ Awoken_one - Yes that's why I wanted to know what you did exactly. I will be making a second version of this crack and I want it to work on every single copy of this game. In order to fix the problem, I have to know what went wrong. I downloaded the SPIRE release just now and it uses the exact same emulator and .bat file, so that can't be the problem. This ""Command & Conquer 4 Server Emulator ver 0.1a by KoriTama"" kind of says it all. The only difference was, the SPIRE release was a manual fix where mine should be automated. Please contribute to a flawless v2.0 | Thanks!"
,Awoken_one,2010-03-23T14:38Z,The game worked for me because of SPIRE's CNC4SERVER file which did not work for me previously-said something about my windows version(32-64bit) conflicts.But combining the two i got it to work.
,buggyboy1,2010-03-23T17:03Z,@ Awoken_one - Thanks a lot! Future releases will include the files from SPIRE's release just to be sure. Enjoy the game and sorry for the inconveniences.
,Awoken_one,2010-03-23T19:54Z,"Don't be sorry,thank you for the crack-gave us all a chance to try the game out.Hope the game deserves that much attention and effort."

,buggyboy1,2010-03-24T03:42Z,@ Crgwal - Please wait a couple of minutes. I'm uploading a v2.0 of this crack in a bit. Please try it and tell me if it works. Thank you!
