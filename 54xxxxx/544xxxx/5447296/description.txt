Cracking Command and Conquer 4 Made Easy


Explanation:
------------

- Run the offline patch and follow the instructions.
No computer skills of any kind required.

- Start the game using the custom launcher.
Located in downloaded "Launcher" folder.


Known Issues:
-------------

Expect most known issues to be fixed once Version 3
comes out along with a new version of the emulator.

- Progress jumps back to mission two after restart.

The emulator is an 0.1 alpha version, so I bet it's
going to get fixed real soon. I'll release a new
version of this application every time a new emulator
comes out so stay tuned! And saving your game at the
beginning of a new mission before closing the game
should work just fine until then. Happy Seeding!

- I start the game with 1821 GDI Experience Points.

This is caused by a bug in the "persona_text.xml" file
included in this torrent. Browse to the file "Offline
Patch > Resources > Docs", open it using Notepad and
change "<GDIExp>1821</GDIExp>" to "<GDIExp>0</GDIExp>"


Clarifications:
---------------

It's normal that you will NOT gain any experience points 
from the first few missions since they are nothing but a 
short tutorial. This is not a bug!

You can run the Offline Patch and the Custom Launcher
from ANY location you like. They don't have to be in the
Command & Conquer 4 game directory.
