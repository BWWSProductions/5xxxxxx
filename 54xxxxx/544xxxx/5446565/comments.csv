,Zartrauch,2010-05-31T13:20Z,"I watched this on my 32inch HD-TV and the picture was superb. It really looks like a Ghibly-Movie from the 2000s, yet it is from 1988. 
Also the dubs and the subs all work flawlessly.

Great copy overall!"
,tkdb13,2010-06-18T05:46Z,"Excellent torrent!
Incidentally, would anyone happen to know if the English audio in this one is from the older 20th Century Fox dub, or is it from the new Disney dub?"
,loafing_oaf,2010-06-22T22:45Z,"This is the newer English dub, which is not as good. But the resolution is very good."
,ryouka19,2010-08-06T13:32Z,thanks a lot.
,civi88,2010-11-03T17:01Z,please seed its not downloading
,Marazas2,2011-02-17T20:12Z,"Chaps, where I can found older ""20th Century Fox dub""? I want to add this eng version track if it exist anywhere  ;)"
,Genocide645,2011-02-26T05:54Z,16min download
,jambajuicer,2011-03-20T00:31Z,Sorry I'm a newb. I downloaded this and when i play it (with vlc) the audio is in russian. I was wondering how I can watch it with Japanese audio and english subs?? Thanks
,matriarchies,2011-03-21T14:44Z,"BAD COPY: this video was defaced by scenetards.  The video was edited, and this text overlaid onto the title card:

How is it that nowhere else but the anime scene it's acceptable to alter the audiovisual content of a film?  If you want to beat your chest with your adolescent scene affiliations, do it in an NFO file with god-awful CP437."
,bejios,2011-04-07T08:18Z,Good copy...just in Russian or some weird language.
,objectinspace,2011-06-04T20:29Z,"It *does* have the ""KickAssAnime"" edit on the title screen, but it is subtley done (just looks like a translation of the Japanese credit) and doesn't detract from the video in any way. The audio tracks and subtitles all work fine in VLC."
,rollercat,2012-01-29T09:28Z,Awesome torrent. Works great and has a good selection of languages and subtitles.
