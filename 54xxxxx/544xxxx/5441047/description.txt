Hi there..

This is a word by word production of the Acts of The Apostles as told by Lukas.

As such it qualifies to be uploaded.

However some may react to the way Saulus'/Paulus' character is played, but anyway, it's a great movie and like I said; it's word by word from the Acts in the Bible, and that is waaay better than any other movies with all their "artistic" add-ons and stories that pass as "Biblical"  

And I've got an invite to a new tracker/community site for Christian content and stuff, and we're all in there to get back to the Bible, and learn how the disciples handled stuff and tasks and their lives.

The site's address is: 
http://www.blazefire.org

Upon clicking that link, you get to the sign up-page, and it's all explained there.

Main thing and ground rule in there is: It's strictly forbidden to mention any "DenomiNational" flagging and such. We meet as equal members of one body, and all we want to do is encourage and build one another so we can grow by what Jesus does in each and every member and sharing that with each other.

It's a safe-zone for all those who got treated badly by someone, or don't feel like they can adjust to rules by "Elders" and "Pastors" and so on, but would like to live their lives according to the pure Words of Jesus and His Apostles.

You're welcome. Very much so.

Enjoy, enjoy..
