I think I'll wait for the story of Nicky Cruz; ""Run Baby, Run"", or the story of ""David Wilkerson's Extraordinary Relationship with God and What Happens Around Him - Still.""

""Run Baby, Run!"", is the cross and the switchblade like it really happened, or more based on Nicky Cruz' own story.

The Wilkerson movie.. ..Well, somehow I doubt that one will ever be made.. Wonder why..

Could be because he doesn't preach pre-tribulation rapture/left behind bullshit..

Could be because he actually preaches stuff the presidents of USA never really favored for their Sunday morning breakfast..

Hmmmm..
