  overbearingly evil mother. He ends up falling in love with a local woman
  who believes that they're destined together. In a moment of intentional
  sabotage of one of their dates, his mother is bitten by a mysterious 
  creature that ends up zombifying her. It's only a matter of time before
  she rises from the dead a powerful, bloodthirsty zombie. It's only a matter
  of time before she starts infecting residents of the town and Lionel has
  to stop her...and them.
