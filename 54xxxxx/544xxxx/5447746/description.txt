All in all we now have covered 83 albums with Jimmy Smith as the leader or co-leader. 'Best Of...' and other compilation albums are not included, as tracks from compilation albums are already covered by this collection.

Jimmy Smith single-handedly made the Hammond B-3 organ an important voice in jazz music. Smith was a true virtuos and his impact on jazz cannot be overstated.

MP3 format. All songs are tagged by the book.

If you encounter errors during the file sharing, please, place this material as close to the root of the hard disk as possible and restart the file sharing (e.g. as close as possible to C: in Windows). This is in order to make the path (drive, directory and filename) as short as possible. Operating systems have limits regarding how long a path including the filename can be, and if this limit is exceeded there will be errors.
