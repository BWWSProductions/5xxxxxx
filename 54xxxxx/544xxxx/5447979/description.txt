I Can Make A Mess Like No One's Business - The World We Know is the 2nd release from the solo project of Art Enders formerly of The Early November.
I don't take credit for the original rip. I found it up at 4shared and broke it down into tracks because it was just one long file. If you enjoy it, please buy it when it comes out on the 23rd I believe. 
I haven't listened to it all the way through, but cut it in the most obvious parts and I think I got it right. But im not sure how it'll be on retail.
