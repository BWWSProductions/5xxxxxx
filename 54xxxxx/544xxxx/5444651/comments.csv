,ar30550,2010-03-23T07:59Z,"I don't get it. Since all windows 7 versions are on single media and features are activated depending on license, why have u places such a large upload?

What is the actual difference between the uploads? They should be the same, read here http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windows7/archive/2009/02/04/a-closer-look-at-the-windows-7-skus.aspx."
