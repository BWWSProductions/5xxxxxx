Blessed is a tender and stirring portrayal of the same day
through very different perspectives. Seven children wander the
streets in an urban odyssey but not all of them find their way
back. Rewind the clock and experience the same period but from
behind their mother's eyes, where it's apparent that they are
as vulnerable and defenceless as the children they care for.

A truly moving examination of the bond between mothers and
their children filmed in Melbourne. With five intertwined
stories are seen from both the child and mother's perspective.
This provides a fascinating insight into relationships & bonds
of family and the strength that comes when those relationships
are tested.
