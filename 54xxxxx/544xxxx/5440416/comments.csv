@kuttootta, thanks for your comment, I have mentioned the encoder which I am using, for setting take the help of google, for ripping you must have a fast system, I have a Quad core processor which takes 4-6 hrs for a movie and earlier when I had a P4 it use to took me 20-24 hrs with the same settings of MeGUI/StaxRip.."
,inianlion,2010-03-21T13:44Z,Wow...You invested 20-24hours to encode a movie for us. Thanks MKVGuy for taking such a valuable effort. All your uploads are topnotch quality.
