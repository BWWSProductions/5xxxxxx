,OO-VEG,2010-03-19T20:23Z,"I always wanted to try this one, but never bought it because of my bad experiences with Abacus. Thx"
,Mogz,2010-03-20T01:18Z,"Sometimes I really wonder if Abacus products are worth stealing ;) Still not sure which are worse Abacus or Alphasim. ;)

Thanks any way for the up."
,chuckmamuck,2010-03-20T02:29Z,"neither of them are known for high quality are they, alphasim can make some nice looking aircraft now and again but theres always things that let them down and take the shine off and abacus, well its abacus, ive heard they're developing their next big release, its a kite, you see a pair of hands holding the lines and you control the kite 8-/"
,OO-VEG,2010-03-21T14:11Z,"Well, This is a fun thing for a while. It's something different with nice wing flex but furthermore.. well yeah its Abacus you know..."

,chuckmamuck,2010-11-28T02:39Z,"llovedy
only modern warfare 2 and Arma 2 operation arrowhead which both feature the predator.
Arma 2 OA is awesome so just download it anyway, you all owe it to yourselves.
