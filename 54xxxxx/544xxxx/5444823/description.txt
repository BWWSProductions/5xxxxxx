In the iso file are 4 folders. Each of the folders has one of the 4 discs of Family Guy Volume 1.

There were some previews for a family guy special that was going to be after the super bowl that year but you have to choose those if you want to see them and they are kind of like funny skits so I left em. 

The only thing I did to the discs was compress them to fit a dvd5 other then that they are the way I got them from the store. 

disc 1 is season 1 episodes 1-7 (only 7 episodes in season 1)

disc 2 is season 2 episodes 1-7

disc 3 is season 2 episodes 8-14

disc 4 is season 2 episodes 15-21




As soon as there are some seeders I'll put up Volume 2 and so on till all 7 volumes are up. 


Please respond and let me know the quality it should be pretty good. 

Let me know if iso files are not to popular cause I can just make the torrents from the dvd files directly djfred style. 

Thanks for trying out my torrent. 



(Every once and a while over the next few days the torrent may go down due to the fact that I have to take the computer with me for a few hours at a time to do some work at a different location. My mobile isp has a major limit on uploads and downloads unlike my cable isp so sorry for those down-times.)
