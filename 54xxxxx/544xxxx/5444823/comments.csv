Those dual layer discs are expensive and I have yet to find a decent brand that doesn't turn half the package into coasters. I gave no problems using ConvertXtoDVD with dual layers but when I try a straight burn it usually fails. Memorex was the brand I was using, others had said they had issues with them as well but that is all the local Target carries."

[T],Magash,2010-03-19T10:18Z,Yes each of the discs will be dvd5 in size and I myself have burned many discs using memorex discs in fact those are what I currently have so it should be fine for you. 
[T],Magash,2010-03-20T19:40Z,I'm gonna stop seeding this today to start Volume 2 so if somebody else can please seed.
