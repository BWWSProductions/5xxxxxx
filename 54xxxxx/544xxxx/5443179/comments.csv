,elliot110,2011-04-10T14:30Z,"If anyone wants to know how to get 'Diamond In The Rough' working, just re-convert it to .flac in switch file sound converter plus. 
Then just drag it and drop it back into the folder on the desktop or whereever you saved it. 

It will ask you to replace the file, click ok.

Bingo the file will now work and sound just like all the other songs."

,lambo_sv,2011-04-17T17:46Z,"Nice upload,
if u could add ""Ready to Rock"" aswel in FLAC i would be so happy :) (+ 3 bonus tracks to make the discography complete: Red Dressed Woman, Hellfire and Heads are gonna roll)

if u can't play all the songs, maybe u should try foobar2000, a free and good music player.

btw, does any1 know when they will bring out their next album?"
