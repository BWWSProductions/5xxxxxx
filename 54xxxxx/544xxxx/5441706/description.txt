So, here's my last Woolhall upload as promised before (except a fixed version of 26, that will follow later).

There are many more Woolhalls around: all the missing ones I haven't uploaded and the Volumes 42-50 (the jubilee release with that nice firework intro).
I do make an appeal to those fans who own these items to SHARE them with all of us and not to keep it for yourself!!!
The same people who made it impossible for me to upload this serie on Demonoid, are now uploading the vol. 1-20 elsewhere...... . It's a strange world.

Anyway, here is:
