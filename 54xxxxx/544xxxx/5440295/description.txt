The Rundown Rehearsal Tapes
Volumes 1 & 2 (4 CDs)
DylanTree Collection

CDRs received in trade back in the DylanTree days  -->  Extracted w/Full Paranoia via Max 0.91 -->  Flac

Artwork Included.

The following tracklist was lifted from the Bobsboot site because it matches the tracklist on the artwork for the DylanTree setâ•”  Leading me to wonder whether the White Bear release (featured on BobsBoots and commented upon by monicasdude at his site) was actually just a straight knock off of the original DylanTree setâ•”?

At any rate, by request, here you go!
