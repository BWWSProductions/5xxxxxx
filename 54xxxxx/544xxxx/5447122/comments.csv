It is probably the ?worst? BRRip I have ever seen. I have absolutely zero idea what the hell FLAWL3SS was doing with an XviD codec and AVI container. Both of these are super old (although still supported) and that?s why you never see a Blu Ray rip from anyone else in avi. FLAWL3ss needs to get his shit together and learn how to encode to MP4 via the x264 codec. Then these would have been really good. As it is - they just look like a really good dvdrip - but defo not a BDrip. Hope this helps make up your mind - but I wouldn?t bother with this download."
