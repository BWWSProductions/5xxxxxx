>> The idea to create my own musical project came to me in 2003, when I had began to create and record my own musical compositions.
All instrument parts (guitars, bass, piano, drums) are composed by myself.
>> SH music could be described or labelled as many different types of musicâ€¦ heavy rock music, electro-rock music and in some instances 8bit rock.
All in all the best way to describe SH music is to say that it is all straight from the heart.

>> In 2009 I began experimenting with original chiptune machines. Commodore 64 and a couple of modded DMG Nintendo Gameboys created a blend of original 8bit sound from the 80â€™s and Rock music.

>> Overall a dose of some fresh and energy music to the earsâ€¦
