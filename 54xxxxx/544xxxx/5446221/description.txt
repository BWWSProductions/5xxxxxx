And Then There Were None (a.k.a. Ten Little Indians) is a 1974 film  version of the Agatha Christie mystery novel of the same name. Two previous theatrical adaptations were released in 1945  and 1965, and a made-for-television  version was broadcast in 1959. This was the second of three versions of Christie's novel to be adapted to the screen by producer Harry Alan Towers; the aforementioned 1965 version, this one is 1974, and yet another in 1989. It follows the script of the 1965 version, right down to calling the Oliver Reed character "Hugh" (a name change made to accommodate Hugh O'Brian in the earlier version) instead of "Phillip," which was character's name in the novel and play, though this particular adaptation is set in an abandoned hotel in the Iranian desert; the film was shot in the Shah Abbas Hotel in Iran during its pre-revolution days. The film's run time is an hour and thirty-eight minutes and it is the first film version of the novel to be filmed in color.
