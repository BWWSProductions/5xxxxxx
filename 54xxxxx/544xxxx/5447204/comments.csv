,Funkingroller,2010-03-21T10:41Z,Have you downloaded this from thebox.bz and if so do you have an invite to it?
,pixiesmiles,2010-03-21T12:10Z,"funk... I had seen you request this season in one of your comments, so figured you would find this torrent sooner or later. ;o)

I don't have.. nor have I seen any torrents for season 1 and 2, but if I do come across them, I will upload them.  Sorry.. I dont have a membership to thebox.bz.  I found this on demonoid... and unfortunately, it would seem folks over there don't seed for very long.. *frowns*  I'll keep looking though. "
,Funkingroller,2010-03-21T12:52Z,Thanks anyway...
,litaliano,2010-03-22T13:55Z,"Thanks for the upload, great show"
,riosalone,2010-03-27T01:43Z,"I got this off Demonoid some time ago and I have to warn you all who are accustomed to the US and AU version of the show:

The UK version has a much inferior overall quality, it all looks and feels very ""Low Budget"" .... Yep, I mean CHEAP.

Doesn't hold a candle to US or AU versions of TBL"
