For the middle album of his Johnny Winter-produced, late-1970s musical trilogy [Hard Again, I'm Ready and King Bee ] , blues giant Muddy Waters brought a new energy and vision to some familiar material. The evolution in Waters' classic sound began by using members of Waters' touring band: pianist Pine Top Perkins, bassist Bob Margolin, and drummer Willie "Big Eyes" Smith.
Winter would subsequently bring the underrated Chicago blues guitarist (and long-time Waters' accompanist) Jimmy Rogers and extraordinary harp player Big Walter Horton to the sessions, and the resulting recording was pure magic.
