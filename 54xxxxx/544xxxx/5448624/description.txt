This episode is from early in the TV series, but was a remake 
of the radio episode from a couple of years earlier.

It's a funny introduction to this hugely successful TV series, 
if you haven't seen it before.

In real life Jack Benny and Mary Livingstone were married 
for well over 40 years.  But on both radio & TV they were 
just friends who worked together on his comedy show.

Their adopted daughter Joan Benny plays herself in the 
dream sequence of this episode.
