[T],thenoobish,2010-03-20T12:06Z,"comment from a user from another site: ""The reason this verision is bigger is because releases for PAL or EU regions always contain EFIGSD languages.. NTSC or American releases only contain 3 languages. English, spanish and French. while this rip contains English UK, French EU, Italian, German, Spanish, Dutch.

Anyways, thats why this rip is 7gb+ vs 3.5gb for NA build"""
[T],thenoobish,2010-03-20T12:07Z,oh this is also an UK release
,93noob93,2010-03-20T12:11Z,multiplayer work?

[V],Mbb15,2010-03-20T13:16Z,any change for a scene release?
,marcjuuhh,2010-03-20T13:41Z,"@ 93noob93 Multiplayer doesn't ever work with pirated games. Atleast not on the official servers, you can look for cracked servers however. But these servers are usually of less quality. 
I don't really know, does this game allow dedicated servers?"
,svadilfari,2010-03-20T14:14Z,oh please the gameplay sucks anyway...i just care bout the story 
,lolkiller123,2010-03-20T18:37Z,need more seeders everyone on 57% :(
,elitegamernl,2010-03-21T13:09Z,"thanks for uplaod
i wanted the dutch version (im dutch)

hope the crack works with this version

but first i have to downlaod this"
,Koraun,2010-03-21T13:28Z,"Get this crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5447296/Command__amp__Conquer_4_Crack___Automated_Patch , it's much easier, then do this.

1. Install the game from this torrent, and crack it with the torrent I linked by following the rest of the steps.
2. To windows 7 users (maybe with vista too) go to %""wind_dir""\System32\drivers\etc find the ""hosts"" file, go to properties, and UNtick the ""read only"" checkbox. %""win_dir"" is usually C:\Windows (Thanks razielblack13)
3. Put the offline patch in the install folder and run it, not sure if it needs to be there but I did it and it worked.
4. Put all of the other files from the launcher folder that came with this download into the install directory.
5. Run the game, everything should work fine now, but remember to save the game after the start of each mission due to the bugs with the game saving itself (not everyone has these issues). And for everyone who asks, I did confirm it by playing, you don't level up until the end of the fourth mission, because at the end of the third mission you choose a side to be on. "
,Ramirez24,2010-03-23T13:26Z,"Koraun I followed your steps and I could not run the game. When I try to run the game and click ""Play"" button then a window appears concerning CNC4SERVER.exe. It says ""Command & Conquer 4 Server Emulator ver 0.1a by KoriTama"". Do you know where the problem is?"
,Koraun,2010-03-23T13:48Z,"@Ramirez24 That should pop up, but it should start the game too. Try the other patcher that is in the description, I just posted that one because the other one wasn't working for me, and the one I posted was easier. Make sure that all of the files from the launcher folder and the offline patch installer are moved into the play directory with the patch I linked, if you have not done that yet then try that before trying the other patch."
,Ramirez24,2010-03-24T01:15Z,Thanks a lot. It works fine now.
,Warll,2010-03-24T05:52Z,"Well that is disappointing, corny acting(Hard to follow whats even happening) and baseless gameplay.

A C and C game without bases!(Even Renegade had more base!) This game is C&C in name only."
