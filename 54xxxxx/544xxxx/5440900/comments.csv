,pokertrap,2010-03-18T02:03Z,hey brick just wondaring will you be doing m2ts movies still and can i put this on my usb stick then watch it on my ps3
,cleo774,2010-03-18T12:24Z,niice!! 8gb awesome
[T],bricktophd,2010-03-18T12:56Z,you could pull the m2ts file out of the bdmv file and transfer that way yes
,jzaw,2010-03-18T23:55Z,"at last 1080p 's with enough bitrate ... 8GB is really a minimum for a full 1080p

congratulations on this one ... nice !

please keep doing the 8 and 12GB versions for the higher bit rates ... my 50"" pany tv LOVES these

thanks"
[T],bricktophd,2010-03-19T01:39Z,the difference is not the significant i was actually going to upload a 8 and 4 gig version of armored so people can see the difference. 
,shankdizzle,2010-03-19T20:31Z,ahhhh! I'm screwed! Can the PS3 really have 8GB files on the Hard Drive? The ps3's Hard Drive's formatted to FAT32 which means files can only be 4GB and under. I've got a external 1.5TB formatted in FAT32 as well for PS3 compatibility. No more 4GB Files? =( 
[T],bricktophd,2010-03-20T00:26Z,i never said i was done with the 4 gig files just showing something new
,yadam2001,2010-03-20T13:24Z,"how can i watch this file without burn, can i extract it somehow? "
[T],bricktophd,2010-03-20T22:37Z,pull the file out of the BDMV folder and transfer that way
,McGudge,2010-03-22T13:59Z,"if you cant burn it for whatever reason

exract file from BDMV folder and transfer to ps3 over the network (tversity or ps3media server).

Brick whats your opinion of the 4GB v 8GB? any significant improvment?"
,privatco,2010-04-04T13:01Z,"Realy thank you very much it is very good quality picture and audio.
Tack s책 mycket det 채r mycket bra bild och ljud.
Lick till Bricktophod"
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-05-22T10:14Z,"shankdizzle, if you can't get larger chunks than 4GB on your ps3, just use mkvtoolnix (google it) to chop the .mkv into smaller bits. It's really easy, and it won't fuck up audio sync, subs and other stuff that chopping up tradition avi files would do. So if you don't mind having to skip to a new segment halfway through (or put'em on the playlist?) then there's your solution right there :)"
,sudhan,2010-07-04T12:08Z,Please upload in 5.1 DTS
,sudhan,2010-07-04T12:53Z,"Sorry To Complain
