,inianlion,2010-03-24T05:52Z,"Hi Cami, the pink and green skull with bone stands for trusted uploaders.
the mountain view tells that particular torrent got the cover or poster image.
magnet link is the new way of linking torrent files, even if the tracker is down or closed for registration you can still might be able to download the content of the torrent."

,VxxM,2010-03-29T08:28Z,"aXXo        =  700

MKVGuy   =   400

How can be aXXo = MKVGuy

aXXo = Quality

MKVGuy = Quality

Therefore..

aXXo = MKVGuy 

(aXXo was the Robin Hood in the internet...
Now we have another Robin Hood... MKVGuy...
Specially on the Low Bandwidth..... )

We Love You Man........"

,ejpoly,2010-05-07T17:06Z,"Have watched many of your uploads. Very nice! Thank you for the time and work.

I have lots of DVD's, and would like to return the favor.

Please tell us what primary tools you use to RIP and convert to MKV (with subtitles)

I have tried many, and have yet to zero in on a collection that works well together, and produces the end results you seem to be able to achieve.

Thx again for the movies. Great work!  :)"
