,ddlance,2010-03-18T15:02Z,"Run through abgx and burn, but do notice the following:

RELEASE DATE: 26.03.10 (UK/EU)30.03.10 US

Wait a week or so before playing, unless you want your console banned."
,jeewadj,2010-03-19T08:10Z,"hi morck 22 

can you please tel me how to burn it on a disc to play on xbox i got pal chipped ??

jeewadj@hotmail.com"
,slowhand461,2010-03-19T09:28Z,"jeewadj

burn to dual layer dvd+r using image burn (search here). when u unpack the download, load the smallest file (.dvd) onto image burn and press 'write', i never had an image fail, if any problem u need latest firmware or download loader disc and also burn to dual layer dvd.

anyways, hope this game is good 
(prob not), metro 2033 woz crap... "
,LazarusHI,2010-03-19T14:02Z,"Don't be fucking stupid, this game is NOT RELEASED so wait 1 week before playing.

People always cry their console was banned. Guess what, I played backups since 2008 and secdata still clean, not a single ban. How?

I don't play games before they are released. Use your damn brains. You *will* be banned in next wave if you play this before 26th of march."
,40_Thieves,2010-03-19T17:45Z,Only one seeder?
,hombreato,2010-03-19T17:57Z,"thanks friend this works fine 10/10

but if you burn the game dont start it yet 

because microsoft has set release date on it from 1 week

you would have console ban if you play it now"
,40_Thieves,2010-03-19T18:02Z,2 now! lol
,sonibob,2010-03-19T18:28Z,"Well LazarusHI, unfortunaly ms could detect ixtreme  1.x firmware,  So even people that have been carefull and checked all games with abgx . and didn't play before relase date have been banned.

Guess you are one of the lucky few....

Now with the LT out it extremly important to check your iso with abgx first so they have a match in their database before playing....

,40_Thieves,2010-03-19T20:06Z,Thanks Morck22. Seeding now
,HELLFIRE22,2010-03-19T21:48Z,"SHITY AS GAME , good upload but the game fucking sucks  0.1/10"
,jasongriff,2010-03-19T22:22Z,thanks friend this works fine 10/10
,runtimmy,2010-03-20T03:29Z,thanks keep it up 
,ddlance,2010-03-20T12:35Z,"Hey Hellfire22,

Have fun with your ""shitty as"" xbox360 now. It's good as dead unless you only play single player.

Is it so hard to wait until release date so your console doesn't get tagged for the next ban wave?"
,horica,2010-03-21T20:36Z,"Is this game Region Free? 

Can I play it on my NTSC Xbox360? 
I really don't want to waste a DL and still not work. Please reply!"
,Resse815,2010-03-22T03:36Z,"Its region free buddy and will work on a NTSC console. So you're good to go.

As for DDlance, stop worrying about other peoples choices. If your not playing yet good for you, nobody gives a shit."
,Resse815,2010-03-22T03:37Z,"And thanks Morck, another awesome upload."
,geelad1212,2010-03-23T15:58Z,"alrite people i just noticed that just cause 2 isnt out yet, i played it a couple of times, while offline of course will i get banned because i dont think the game comes out for another couple of days.  i wont get the dreaded hammer will i.  obviously im not going to play it now until it comes out but any thoughts."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-26T11:00Z,"@geelad1212

There is so 100% safe way. When you flash your xbox you take a risk getting banned. Some ppl saying that box360 store info and when you get online it sends it to M$ but who knows?.  But as long as you dont go online they cant ban your HD/Console :D. But then again you can unlock it ;)"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-26T11:00Z,*No
,Sale95,2010-03-27T14:17Z,please seed!
