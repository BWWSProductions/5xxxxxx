,mironick3,2010-03-18T09:51Z,Need the rosetta stone latin language.  Does anyone have it?
,crassbar,2010-03-18T19:04Z,"Hey there.  I have RS 3.4.5 and just got these on disc (thanx a lot btw) but it can't seem to read it as a language disc when I try to add the language.  I have ""burned as disc image"" so not sure what to do now."
,xxx-yyy-zzz,2010-03-18T19:25Z,"crassbar

do not burn, just mount :-)"
,crassbar,2010-03-18T19:55Z,"I'm not quite sure I understand. Does ""mount"" only apply to mounting the image to a virtual drive or do you ""mount"" the image on a blank disc? I haven't had a problem with burning the image to disc for the other three levels, so I'm not sure what the problem is here. Please help!"
,crassbar,2010-03-18T20:01Z,"OK, wait.  I have it.  What's strange is that BOTH Level 4 and 5 load from the Level 5 ISO.  The Level 4 ISO just doesn't work at all.  Strange."
,bill_bob,2010-03-19T01:15Z,Can not mount either 4 or 5 using several different programs. Has anyone successfully mounted these .iso files and gotten it to work on RS?
,xxx-yyy-zzz,2010-03-19T03:55Z,"I did. 

But I am Apple not Blue ;-)

Just mounted them and that was that :0"
,bill_bob,2010-03-19T08:50Z,"I downloaded the files again and tried to mount using Magic ISO and ImageBurn. Each time I get a ""Failed to Mount DVD CD/DVD Image"" pop-up. Any ideas?"
,vitel,2010-03-19T10:56Z,Thank you very much!!!
,vitel,2010-03-19T10:58Z,All work good!!! But for it you Need Rosetta 3.4.5!!!
,hummetje,2010-03-20T00:36Z,Thank you
[V],Raider,2010-04-18T23:08Z,"bill_bob 
use it with the application! 3.4.5
Just by mounting it on ISO s/f wont help!"
,Donchino,2010-05-16T15:51Z,"Please help, where can I locate the activation code?"
,amcm03,2010-06-01T12:50Z,These won't load on 3.0.57.
,crassbar,2010-06-21T23:03Z,Hey Vasio! Do you have access to the supplemental disc for Levels 4 & 5 Home School?
,Joe3W,2010-09-14T09:18Z,"could you help me? I can't install level 4 and 5 of German V3, it tells me I must update them.. what should I do? thanks in advance."
,jcastro87,2010-11-20T12:24Z,"I have successfully installed Rosetta Stone V3 Levels 1-3, but when attempting to install Levels 4-5, I experience the same problem that Joe3W has encountered. Any suggestions?"
,jcastro87,2010-12-30T06:06Z,"In case anyone encounters the same error message that prevents you from installing levels 4 and 5 without updating Rosetta Stone, the solution is simple: follow the error message. Download and install Rosetta Stone 3.4.5 or 3.4.7, both of which have been uploaded by VasiaZozulia. Needless to say, these versions will update an older version of the program and allow you to install German L4 and L5 and so forth."
,ivancdp,2011-01-07T01:58Z,I downloaded the complete german set from library source and levels 4 and 5 didnt work. Will these work?
