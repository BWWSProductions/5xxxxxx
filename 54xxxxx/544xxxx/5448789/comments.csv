,soagg1,2010-03-20T18:03Z,"Sorry for the late release of this one. I will continue my uploads from here on. Though please be careful that the on going series are not weekly releases so it could be delayed. Once Bleach starts we might see weekly releases though that depends on the schedule of DVD releases.

Hope you enjoy this one!!"

,IXavier,2010-04-23T12:47Z,"I've just watched all dubbed naruto shippuden and now i'm faced with a problem, do i start watching subbed or w8 for dubbed. I'm worried that the dubbed versions will take to long but i'm also worried that the characters maybe a little different in the subbed versions. Can anyone tell me if there is a huge difference between jap characters and us characters...
P.S. cheers Soagg."

,IXavier,2010-04-26T12:35Z,"Anyone that hasnt looked i found a torrent for episode 31-34 dubbed -
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5460954/Naruto_Shippuden_031-034_English_Dubbed

They're mp4s, personally id rather avi like soaggs ones (I like to keep them the same format :P, I'm weird like that). I just cant be bothered loading them on that site that Bamsen82 suggested (tho I appreciate it, I watched 31 on it then found this torrent). Anyway, thought id mention it, cos soagg hasn't posted in a while and if any of u guys are like me, your having huge withdrawals :P.

Enjoy :)."
