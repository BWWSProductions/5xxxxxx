At a time when scores of christians are being harassed, persecuted, molested and murdered by Hindus, these set of documentaries are an excellent rebuke to the nature of Hinduism. 

As Dr Robert Morey describes in his article titled "Hinduism Exposed", 

"The tourist who travels to India's many temples is often shocked by wall art that depicts sodomy, child sex, orgies and bestiality of the grossest kind. Yet, all this is part of what lies at the core of Hinduism. The same shock is received when tourists see Hindus drinking urine from animals and humans and smearing dung in their hair and on their body. The smell that emanates from the gurus, monks and holy men of Hinduism is enough to warn us that Hinduism is rotten to the core."

Need I say more. See these documentary clips and decide for yourself.
