IMAGiNE NOTES
Source was really nice but had a angle to it and colours were slightly off.....audio was nice clean,clear but low.

Work done, fixed angle then cropped and resize, then tweaked the colouring etc......
Audio was just given a bit of a boost nothing more needed.

Got to pre warn everyone.....this time 99% sure no one walking past and no chair...however the only downside of this is there is some pretty dark scenes and if we brightened it any more it would have looked worse so...Still more than watchable until the r5 or retail comes out.

Oh one more thing, it's the actual film that has the shaky cam.....it's meant to look that way,which i personally believe makes the film look worse.... :(
