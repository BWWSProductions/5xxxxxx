,michaelrwatson,2010-03-20T00:12Z,"Yeah, The Hurt Locker was the same--horrible, deliberate shaky cam.  These must be photographed and edited by crack heads, and since there are so many of those in Hollywood, well, it works for them. But what crap. "
,michaelrwatson,2010-03-20T00:20Z,"Yeah, just download the SAMPLE first and look at that. I almost got a seizure watching that. There's lots of unnecessary ZOOMING in and out too, in addition to the SHAKY CAM."

,mrgarrison,2010-03-20T07:38Z,I don't usually comment on torrents. this was a great movie. and the quality was very good. there are a lot of very dark scenes in the movie I'm not sure if that was meant to be but none the less I was extremely pleased with it.
,Gaze09,2010-03-20T11:55Z,God so many wanks complaining on ere IE shaky camera angles ffs michaelrwatson The Hurt Locker is a class film pal the shaky camera in that is because if u were nxt 2 IEDs that explode would u be in a stable enviroment (fixed camera angles) NO !!!! neways apart frm cunts nt having a clue thnx 4 the up well appreciated !!!
,holman534,2010-03-20T15:17Z,"This movie is OK, the quality is about A5/V6 and it is same quality on movie-slope.info, please remove the - sign "
,Quantum12,2010-03-20T16:55Z,"Video is very good quality for a TS. Audio is not so good, but definitely listenable.

The movie is great. Although the characters are fictional, they operate within a background plot that is deplorably true. What America did to Iraq is precisely what Germany did to Poland in 1939. Their leaders fabricated a straw man to rally support for a spot of good, old fashioned conquering. They then managed to sell it to the American people by telling them invasion is perfectly acceptable as a pre-emptive strike: precisely what Hitler told Germany in 1939.

How can Americans still be so horrifyingly dense that they fail to understand what the Bush Administration was all about? They were fascist, corporatist liars and it is utterly heartbreaking that the people cannot find a united resolution to see them tried for war crimes. Bush was a puppet for a selection of right wing radicalists that managed to cause the biggest economic crisis of the modern era through simple megalomania and greed. After they nearly bankrupted America by failing to properly regulate the banking industry, they simply walked away and left Obama to pick up the pieces.

We should all be ashamed of either:-

A) Our stupidity.
B) Our cowardice.
C) Any combination of the above.

Quantum out.
"
,Auslander808,2010-03-20T17:03Z,"LMAO If you think obama is picking up the pieces vs raping the carcass, you may want to check your density level."
,Quantum12,2010-03-20T17:32Z,"Once you develop the ability to read, you may notice I stated Obama had been left to pick up the pieces. I said nothing about whether or not he was actually doing it.

Judging by your cataclysmic stupidity, I'm making a guess that you're an American Republican. I'm English so I'm neutral. If I was American though, I'd prefer someone as president who wants to give poor people better healthcare, rather than someone who wants to invade countries for the profit of the bourgeois. Especially when that someone is prepared to sacrifice the lives of ordinary Americans to accomplish it.

But then again, unlike yourself I'm not a  pathologically stupid, indoctrinated idiot that orgasms from the bliss of his own ignorance."
,celmario,2010-03-20T18:31Z,Is it just me or does the audio go completely out of sync half way through the movie?
,funksta,2010-03-20T19:46Z,"personally i think people are way to critical of the job that people do with cams.  I give this, and speaking in terms of cams V 8 A 6......very watchable and pretty good quality.  the video is near perfect, again for cams its near perfect.  The audio is just low, and i could barely have mine loud enough with my sound sticks hooked up.  Thanks a lot though, good stuff"
,ihatempaa,2010-03-20T21:15Z,The quality is not bad at all. I would rate 8 out of 10 for a TS. It is comparable to that of a video seen on VHS around 1995 or so. 
,o-josh-o,2010-03-20T21:16Z,3930 seeders and 12 actually seeding....come on guys!
,michaelrwatson,2010-03-21T00:57Z,"Well........ as raymondhome notes above in his comments on this release, almost every scene has shaky-cam. However, it's not as bad as in The Hurt Locker (although it is bad in parts). I watched this last night, and cams/telesyncs don't get any better. 

Other than the shaky-cam, which is the stupid photographer's fault, or the director's. Real dumbfucks. "
,Lucifer007,2010-03-21T05:01Z,Thank You So Much! Cheerio
,Quantum12,2010-03-21T06:51Z,"Get the fuck out of here with your spam Claire. Quality is not crap and I'm sure we'd all appreciate it if you'd stop telling lies to facilitate people visiting your virus-ridden links.

As previously stated, video is very good quality for a TS. Audio is a bit flaky, but perfectly listenable if you crank the volume up a touch.

Nice upload."

I love you, literally! :) "
,Auslander808,2010-03-21T15:51Z,"Actually I am neither, dumbass. Neutral? LMAO you ARE fucking dense. Being English just means you hypocritically spout off, judge and hate everyone."

,parasites,2010-03-22T23:45Z,Just got home from the cinema after watching this film? at no point was I disappointed. Matt Damon was great. The acting was great all-round. The sound and graph?s played a big part in it to? you would need a good quality sound system and tv to enjoy this. And of course a good download. Because of the nature of this film there is a lot of shaky camera work and the later part of the film is dark? but you will understand why. So if (I haven?t downloaded this one) the dl is good put the sound up on your tv.    
,foxelein,2010-03-23T07:41Z,thank you.. :)

but americans are the dumbest fuck, gimp assholes and actually think there are WMD in Iraq - is that the message in this film?

It certainly seems so.

Thick fucking dumb cunt brainwashed American assholes if camoflage gimp suits

dumb fucks getting fucked up the ass by their own side

i hope they got paid lots of stupid worthless american dollars to do that job
perhaps it paid off some of their massive debt to some bank which is the state that most americans live in
MASSIVE FUCKING DEBT
dumb ass fuck shits - bringing their fucked up idea of gimp drowning in debt freedom to the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


pawns for cheney and haliburton and rumsfeld and wolfowitz and that cunt motherfucker dynasty BUSH family fuck up

gimps bending over to be fucked up the ass with a tank

thats what the stupid dumb fuck americans look like in this film

,fruityloop7,2010-03-25T08:38Z,"wasnt that actor in the hit comedy Little Miss Sunshiine?

Brian Cox who was in the Bourne movies

That bad cop who was in LA Confidential???????????
He was rather bad

No other famous actors who can play bad out of the pool of 6 billion people

Im bored with hollywood they keep dredging up the same old tired actors who have been in every film they have ever made

Thanks a heap for the great work RAYMONDHOME.

So, fiction meets non-fiction. Whats scarier? An extremist holding up a severed head? Or a country that spreads democracy with a smart bomb...... for the good of all???????

Anyway while its a good watch, the truth is they plagiarized it from CNN, waited 3-4 years put a couple of name actors in it and hey presto!!! LOL"

2. If your going to moan about the US or even praise it do your research and stop thinking the US saved everyone in WW2
3. No-one gives a flying fuck
4. Just fucking comment on the vid

Hope this helps.  Oh and BTW while I'm here I'll make myself look like a twat and join in the rant.

@npssg there's no such thing as cussing you prick it's cursing so get it right

Also the US (and the British as well) went into Iraq because Saddam was an evil bastard what about Mugabe or that wank stain in Korea?

Oh and another thing, the Americans make nothing good but torches and tools, even then it's overpriced.

,FrozenPenguin,2010-06-03T15:53Z,"OK, here is the real shizzle on the quality. I'm not going into the politics of this one, anyone with half a brain can see what is really going on.

OK, the shots during the day rate a 7. You can watch this till something better is released.

The shots during the night (which is over half the film) just plain suck. Imagine being in the backseat of a Honda, at midnite, filming through a dirty muddy windshield with only 1 headlight working on low beam during an 8.8 earthquake that lasts for 50 minutes. Your entire car is being jostled up and down and back and forth during the earthquake while you are trying to film. Every once in a while an orange fireball explodes and lights up the scene for a few seconds. That's exactly what the last half of this film is like. Some scenes need to be replayed 4 or 5 times to understand just exactly what happened. 

V daytime: 7
V night: 1
A: 7"

,tybomb,2010-06-30T19:24Z,"Why hasn't ""extremezone"" been banned or the torrent removed? He uploaded this movie on 6/9 and all the comments are fake and so is the torrent? Is piratebay working for the bad guys now? I tried to post a comment and it didn't show up.
Check out the torrent I'm talking about and you will see all the fake comments and if you download the video it is a fake."
