Far-east espio-noir. Great scene in a Japanese brothel, depicting extraordinary debauchery.

The pro-government theme and cold-war jingoism here are tedious to me, but are fairly common in classic noirs. If you like the Japanese setting, check out House of Bamboo (Samuel Fuller, 1955). Both noirs were shot on-location.
