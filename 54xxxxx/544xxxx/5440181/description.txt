Smith and singer-songwriter Taio Cruz, among others. It was preceded by the lead single, "Fight for This Love", which became the fastest-selling single of 2009 in the UK. It charted at number one on both the Irish and UK Singles Chart. The album entered at the top spot of the UK Albums Chart. On 6 November 2009 the British Phonographic Industry certified the album Platinum denoting shipments 300,000 units.

Amazon.com - Debut solo album from the Girls Aloud singer, who has risen to even greater popularity following her stint as a judge on The X Factor. As opposed to the electro direction of Girls Aloud's recent work, this album has a distinct RnB influence due largely to the production contributions of will.i.am and Taio Cruz. A host of faces from the worlds of pop and dance were also involved, the striking cover portrait was shot by renowned fashion photographer Nick Knight, and the singles "Fight For This Love" and "3 Words" is included.
