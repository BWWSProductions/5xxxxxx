,FotherMucker,2010-03-30T17:18Z,"I got a ""EXP/ASF.GetCodec.Gen"" alert on the avi from Avira AntiVir Personal.. Not sure wheter it's actually a virus, spyware or a dud alert though. To be on the safe side, I got rid of it.

Judging by the comments being about 50/50 here, I suggest not downloading this potential shit ;-)"
