,Rod321,2010-03-23T00:57Z,"I have struck my first problem with an MKVGuy download (so that is an absolute fantastic result overall).

The file is complete when downloaded & can be watched on the computer but ConvertX to DVD4 only converts & burns 5 chapters. I deleted the download & downloaded a new file but got the same result.

AVS Video Converter 6.3 converts & burns to the same point as ConvertX.

Too hard for my simple mind - any suggestions please??"
,bad_ass_dj,2010-03-23T06:06Z,try useing convert x to dvd 3 
[V],pluto999,2010-03-23T08:35Z,@Noobio: I can do that if you are willing to seed & 700*6=4200mb which is < 4489 mb which fits in a DVD5 so anyways 700mb avi file with Xvid codec can fit in a dvd too..
[V],pluto999,2010-03-23T08:36Z,@pinka123: I'll asap!!
[V],pluto999,2010-03-23T08:38Z,"@ksk235 : I'll upload A Christmas Carol today.. check my page..

[V],MKVGuy,2010-03-25T04:36Z,"inianlion, I think he is looking for a different one, its ""NINE"" not ""9"".. anyways I will try.."
,inianlion,2010-03-25T09:09Z,"Oh, Sorry."
,rammy2cool,2010-03-28T13:55Z,Hated it ! A real bore.
,VxxM,2010-03-29T08:30Z,"aXXo        =  700

MKVGuy   =   400

How can be aXXo = MKVGuy

aXXo = Quality

MKVGuy = Quality

Therefore..

aXXo = MKVGuy 

(aXXo was the Robin Hood in the internet...
Now we have another Robin Hood... MKVGuy...
Specially on the Low Bandwidth..... )

We Love You Man........"
,m.clift,2010-07-17T12:29Z,I agree with Rod321.  ConvertXtoDVD4 stops converting and starts burning at about 1/5th the way through.  Rats!
,m.clift,2010-07-17T13:05Z,UPDATE - it doesn\'t matter if you use ConnectXtoDVD3 either.  I just tried it.  Oh well...
