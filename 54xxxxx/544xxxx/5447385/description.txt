             Since 1989, Efofex has been producing tools that                 
             save mathematics and science teachers time. If you               
             need to draw high quality mathematical diagrams,                 
             produce mathematical, chemical and physical                      
             equations as quickly as possible or provide high                 
             powered, but simple to use tools to mathematics                  
             students - we have a tool for you.                               
                                                                              
             FX Chem makes typing chemical equations almost as                
             easy as typing your name. Certainly, typing chemical             
             equations isn't much fun. Superscripts, subscripts,              
             italics and arrows are all tedious to produce and                
             you could be doing something more enjoyable with                 
             your time. FX Chem lets you do that. With FX Chem,               
             you just type the information and FX Chem does the               
             formatting for you. FX Chem understands enough about             
             chemistry to recognise the various components of a               
             chemical equation and puts them in the right place               
             for you.                                                         
                                                                              
             FX ChemStruct makes drawing chemical structures an               
             easy task. Chemical structures are extremely                     
             difficult to draw using standard drawing tools and               
             even specialised tools can be slow and cumbersome.               
             What teachers need is a quick way of drawing                     
             chemical structures - FX ChemStruct. All sorts of                
             chemical structures and equations are possible. Just             
             type the structure you want, select the display                  
             option you require and a few clicks later you will               
             have publication quality diagrams for your document.             
             No "drawing" is required.                                        
                                                                              
             FX Equation is simply the fastest way to produce                 
             mathematical and scientific equations. It provides               
             an equation creation environment that really is                  
             "Astoundingly Quick". FX Equation 4 adds automatic               
             vertical alignment of equals signs and a high speed              
             toolbar entry system that can speed up entry of more             
             complicated equations. FX Equation also adds short               
             division signs, "fill in the blank" boxes,                       
             combinations, permutations, arcs, highlighted lines              
             and an on-screen keyboard for use with interactive               
             whiteboards. To use FX Equation, you just type the               
             equation. FX Equation looks at what you have typed               
             and puts everything in the right place. You never                
             have to touch the mouse.                                         
                                                                              
             FX Draw 3 can be used as a drawing tool for                      
             teachers. It can be used as a demonstration tool                 
             with a data projector. It can be used with                       
             interactive whiteboards to provide a mathematically              
             aware drawing surface. It can be used directly with              
             students to provide a dynamic learning environment               
             where they can easily and interactively investigate              
             most aspects of mathematics. FX Draw 3 is the most               
             useful piece of software a mathematics teacher or                
             student can have on their computer.                              
                                                                              
             FX Graph makes powerful graphing dead simple. Most               
             graphing packages offer powerful features but they               
             are difficult to learn, difficult to teach and                   
             difficult to use. Many schools spend more time                   
             teaching students how to use the program rather than             
             actually using it. FX Graph is different - it is                 
             dead simple. So simple that secondary students will              
             be using it to solve problems within minutes of                  
             first seeing it.                                                 
                                                                              
             FX Stat 2 helps you interact with your data. FX Stat             
             is a statistics program designed for secondary                   
             school teachers and students. Just what you need,                
             with nothing extra. It is easy to use, powerful and              
             does things the way you want them done. FX Stat                  
             creates a powerful, dynamic statistical environment              
             for the exploration of data in all of its forms.                 
             Students and teachers will love the ability to                   
             produce high-quality statistically correct graphics
