  The Monty Pyton team tells the life, death and resurrection of Brian from
  Nazareth, an unwilling prophet who wants to free his land from the 
  oppression of Rome. When Brian covers a huge wall with the writing 
  "ROMANI ITE DOMUM" (Romans go home), a local revolutionary group begins
  to take him seriously...
