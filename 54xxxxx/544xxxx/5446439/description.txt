FEATURES:

Superior Gameplay Design
Microsoft International Football 2000 re-creates the excitement, speed, pace, atmosphere, tactics and strategy of world-class soccer. Player formations and strategies are designed according to how each position relates to a team's overall playing strategy.
The game's artificial intelligence (AI) was developed with the guidance and assistance of some of England's top football coaches and Glenn Roeder, a former Football Association player. This in-depth AI allows players to perform in the manner their position dictates in any given situation and react convincingly to any play as needed. 

Unique One-Touch Controls
Microsoft International Football 2000 features a unique one-touch control system that acts and reacts to gamers' input. The one-touch control feature is easy to learn, allowing players to quickly discover and enjoy the game's depth. No matter what the situation, the basic idea of the one-touch system is the same: to provide a consistent and predictable response with a single touch.
As gamers improve and master the use of the basic pass and shoot controls, they can learn more sophisticated ball and player controls. By using the one-touch control feature, gamers can low-kick, high-kick, make contact and sprint down the field - making for an ultra-realistic and rewarding gaming experience. 
Smooth and Sophisticated Gameplay
The excitement of a real soccer game is brought to life with over 200 player moves, 9,000 frames of motion-captured animation, and extensive commentary and conversations by Jonathan Pearce and Ron Atkinson, both well-known English coaches. 

World-Class Visuals
International Football 2000 features spectacular animation, with resolutions up to 1024x780, running up to 60 frames per second. International Football 2000 scores a goal with authenticity by the use of real-time lighting and shadows on the players and ball, and the re-creation of eight stunning and realistic stadiums complete with weather and time-of-day options.
