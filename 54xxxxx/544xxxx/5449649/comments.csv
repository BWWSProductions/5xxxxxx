,radioshoes1,2010-03-21T12:23Z,"Shit, I've been looking for this for years - and when it finally appears it's a fake. I will NEVER understand what tossers like Anonymous get out of their weaselly little activities . . ."
,GungaDan,2010-08-02T18:19Z,"This is NOT a fake. If it is flawed, then it is unintentional. I went to a lot of trouble to buy this on VHS, sample it to digital, and post it here, so that I could share it with others who want to see it. The file plays fine for me. "
,Kniffy,2010-08-25T18:28Z,"NOT a fake; 'bychance', you are a tosser!

I should have tried this file sooner, as it is not available anywhere for purchase; another effect of the great information age, jewels are lost too easilly in all the nicely lit and well packaged shiite out there.

The file is a bit big for the end quality, but since it's from a VHS.  Bonus: it's Widescreen...  Thank you to the author who created the file!

I shall SEED this x2 or more - Please do the same to get this film known."

,GungaDan,2010-09-22T10:08Z,"Local Hero is readily available for download, and in addition to being a Forsyth film, it happens to be one of my very favorite movies of all time. Just wonderful. Check it out. :)"
