Hard House Classics mix that I did about 2003ish. I dont have the exact listings but there are some real classic tunes on this mix, including a couple of rare ones.

The mix includes a couple of nudges that knocks the record once or twice but apart from that its quality.

Any comments welcome.

Enjoy
