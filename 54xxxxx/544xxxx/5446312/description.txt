        Comedian Paddy McGuinness dons his tracksuit to host the     
        final of the Sport Relief special of the stalwart 70s sports 
        show, with team coaches Dame Kelly Holmes, Mark Foster and   
        Darren Campbell. In just five action-packed, scintillating   
        games on land and on water, one of three teams will triumph  
        for their schools. But which team will it be?
