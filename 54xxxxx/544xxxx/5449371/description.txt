http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=215429

Just upping for people who don't have a windows PC or can't get the patcher to work.

This allows you to play the JP version with the english story and menu's without freezing.

There will be newer patches made but this is the newest he has released so far.

works fine on our DSTT with older a07 firmware just fine.  Should work almost everything I would think.  Read his thread if you want some reports.  This way you dont have have to own a cyclo ds or acekard to play the game (USA version).

You would need at least a05 firmware for it work with DSTT.

Here is the firmware site for DSTT
