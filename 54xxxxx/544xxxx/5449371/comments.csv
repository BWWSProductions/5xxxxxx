,King_Noobington,2010-03-21T02:13Z,What ever happened to no$gba working for DS games.
,Vossiej,2010-03-21T17:54Z,"Are you going to do Soul Silver too? If so, when can we expect it to come?"
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-21T18:43Z,"I can, but like I said the guy is working on translating the pokedex still and i expect next week he will have that done as well.  Just didn't want to make people keep redownloading.

Your saves work fine from each patch, at least it did for us, we played 1.0 for a few hours then went to 1.5 and used same .sav file.  we have 3 badges and been playing for like 6hrs or so, we had one 1 freeze, but I updated the dstt firmware to the latest and it hasn't happened again.  my advice is save your game after each pokemon capture or you finish a dungeon area or something, just to be safe.

,King_Noobington,2010-03-21T21:44Z,"Do I need a specific type of hardware to place this on my laptop, or do I need to download some software?"
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-21T22:07Z,"DSEmu or no$gba.

You will probably want a clean rom though for those and might need an AR code.  I think this works with no$gba with an AR code, but this prepatched version is meant for play on flashcarts that can't play the US rom due to not having a proper fix yet."
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-21T22:26Z,"original patcher guy was banned from gbatemp.

there is a new thread started at

http://forum.romulation.net/index.php?topic=37226.0

and should have an update 2.0 tomorrow according to the thread with the full pokedex and more routes."
,Equinox117,2010-03-22T09:28Z,"Happens to be the exact version i uploaded, just with different tag, soul silver is already done like this as well, available to download from the translator / patcher's website!"
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-22T16:48Z,"dont seem to be any point in uploading new ones, author is now making links to direct downloads pre-patched.

2.0 patch is there now."
,Bonds007,2010-03-24T20:52Z,Is this working?
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-25T05:06Z,"yea, but its outdated now.  click the link above and get the 2.0full version."
