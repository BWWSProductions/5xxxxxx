Note: These are at various bit rates between 192K and 320K.

I purposely avoided Ringo's first two solo albums, because they 
were off-genre (covers of 1940s songs on one,  country music 
on the other). So when he got back to rock & roll, 
"Ringo" in 1973 is where I started.

There were also some later albums that were unlistenable by my 
standards, such as a Christmas album. Most of what Starr did in 
the 1980s was as the Brits would say "bloody awful". I only saved 
two tracks from that decade, and then in my playlist you'll see 
a jump to 1992.

No live performances or the All-Star Band here either. 
Just the studio albums.

I think you'll agree with many of my picks, and hope you 
enjoy The Executive Collection!
