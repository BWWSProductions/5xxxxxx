,unomyname,2010-03-17T23:29Z,"Mr. Smarty, and how would you define people who search torrents in order to leave an idiotic comment..."
,hrmitcrb,2010-03-18T03:41Z,More knowledgeable than those who post torrents like this.  And the Only reason I clicked on the torrent from the list was to see the name of the uploader who fits the description I left above.
,aftac,2010-03-18T05:33Z,"Everyone has a point of view, but very few possess true knowledge, an endeavor that requires one to rationally look at differing points of view."
,hrmitcrb,2010-03-18T08:54Z,Snake-oil is not a point of view.
,cbair79,2010-03-18T22:49Z,"Hermit Crab, do you think you know me? Or my spending habbits? Really...? (hint: you don't.)

Or is this just another vitriolic vomitous rant from someone who has a differing opinion?

I used to be amused by snipers from the camp of love and understanding and peace and inclusiveness but attack after attack after attack has left me slightly disguised at the constant double-talk. ""Do as I say, not as I do"".

The scariest thing about your type is the lack of knowledge or understanding of history. I don't blame you...you've been fed a white-washed bill of goods by your ilk that came before you. You won't know any better until you do a little research of your own. When either your eyes are opened or the walls come crashing down around you, we'll be here with open arms, keeping no history of wrongs. We'll show you the truth and invite you in to find shelter with those who know history and have prepared for what's to come.

But that's okay. You can just keep your eyes closed and let history repeat itself.

Oh, and you're right about snake-oil; it's not a point of view. It's the un-proven, the mysterious, half-truths, and wild unsubstantiated claims...things like conspiracy theories about ""Secret [Christian] Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power."" (see hrmitcrb's lone contribution to TPB)

I only have one question... Which of us is falling for (and propagating) the snake oil salesmen...?"
,cbair79,2010-03-19T02:36Z,"Can you give an example? Surely such a deceiver would have heaps of examples of leading people astray in his ""snake-oil"" ways..."
,hrmitcrb,2010-03-19T03:22Z,"I have a major in history.  Glen Beck dropped out of Yale after one class.  As I said, snake oil salesman."
,cbair79,2010-03-19T03:37Z,"Congratulations on your major. Did you get a degree too?

P.S. That's still not an example."
,servative,2010-03-19T22:12Z,"What does a major in history get you in America? Apparently the ability to troll websites (i dont believe this is the only one) calling people they disagree with names. Money well spent, I say."
,hrmitcrb,2010-03-21T18:46Z,"A degree in history gives me the ability to spot a fraud who mis-interprets and mis-represents historical and political fact in order to further an agenda, the motive of which is primarily to promote himself.  And yes, it was money well spent."
,McStroker,2010-07-01T00:54Z,"So Hermie,
Big dummy Glenn is able to drop out of school and make a ton of money all on his own with no government assistance. How's that history degree working out for you? Yeah, I know money isn't everything, but no money isn't ANYTHING. Maybe you should go back and get a teaching degree too. Then you'll be set for life."
