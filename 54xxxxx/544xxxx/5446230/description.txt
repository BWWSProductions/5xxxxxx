Publisher: Traplet Publications | 109 pages | May 2005 | ISBN 190037191X | PDF 

Following neatly on from Kurt Schreckling's book on the FD3/64, Thomas Kamps brings the construction and running of gas turbines up to date. The book includes highly detailed and well illustrated building instructions which the advanced model builder can use to make and even design his own jet engine. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.
