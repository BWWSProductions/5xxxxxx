,endwar16,2010-03-18T18:18Z,"Cotta, its morck22 im pretty sure if he says it has no virus it wont, ive downloaded plenty of his stuff and never had any problems with it "
,v6mac,2010-03-18T19:30Z,This edition has some deleted part from the previous editon
,Kasoi,2010-03-18T20:29Z,"v6mac, if it's really not a question I can't say you're right. Additional content in that version is not ""deleted"" it's ""additional""."
,v6mac,2010-03-18T21:11Z,Kasoi  What i meat to say was that This gold edition has more extended part then the previous version of RE5

I don't want try, because i have original game. If you try write ok? "
,ant19831983,2010-03-20T02:13Z,Bastard! Just put it in Xbox just to find out it's the same as the original version nothing different.
,KING_XXX_Rated,2010-03-20T20:39Z,Why the fuck would you put Gold Edition if it isnt? I just played it and no game add on contents are not even on there. This is just the original version of RE5. NOT GOLD!!!!
,powermanic,2010-03-21T10:36Z,THIS IS THE 5 NOT THE GOLD EDITION. :(
