,whisper3k,2010-03-20T20:49Z,Does this work? Cannot extract archive. 
,bubbyboo,2010-03-21T00:24Z,"I had the same problem as whisper3k.  I kept getting a pop-up window saying it couldn't find one of the files, even though it was totally there, and when I located it for the program, it didn't recognize it."
,alexaa11,2010-04-07T07:27Z,"guys first u have 2 unzip the zip files, then unrar the rars, and then u have the .exe file with a crack folder.
hit the .exe file, install the game. use the .exe file from the crak folder to modify the game's original exe at program files/dreamdaywedding etc.
that's it, and now u can play."
,Sukimono,2010-05-10T00:29Z,"Unzipped, then tried to open the rar, got an error msg saying the file is broken."
,RPC_Rebel,2010-06-21T01:30Z,Had same problem.  I had to highlight all the rar files and then hit extract.  Open the rar file in the extracted folder and it should work like a charm.  Copy crack and your done.  Thanks for the upload.

,chifuyu,2012-05-27T06:29Z,"Okay, so I extracted the files, unrar the files, copied the crack to the program files, but when I launched the game, the game only appears for a while (until the I play intro thingy) and then the window closes by itself automatically. D:
There's no error message or what not, but it just closes like that. Why?! T_T"
,chifuyu,2012-05-27T06:37Z,"Can anyone help? I still can't launch the game :< I extracted, unrar, copied the crack and all, but did the game close by itself automatically? What went wrong? D:"
