,janscott,2011-05-23T22:43Z,I saw this when I was 13 years old with my Mom and Dad in England.  It left such an impression on me - and I have never forgotten it.  I was a Newman fan from then on until the day he died.  It's such a lovely movie....I thank you so much for putting this up to share  âĽ
