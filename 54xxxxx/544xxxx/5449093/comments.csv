,TrentDavey,2010-03-23T14:59Z,Some of the files are missing their extension and look like text files of some kind (?).
,bbforlife,2010-03-23T15:19Z,All the docs are in .doc format.  For the record on a mac running 10.6.2 everything works correctly.

,Vaare,2010-08-23T02:31Z,Can other people stay on this torrent? I've seeded this to 54.175 ratio. That's almost 200 GB. I was hoping others would stay on afterwards. Soon I will stop completely and you're on your own.

,NJBob,2011-12-13T06:25Z,"This package is for someone who wants to be a producer. Has all the steps to organize and run a production company to make a movie on film or video. Does not go into the artistic theory. For someone who has a script, can hire lighting man, sound engineer, cameraman, actors, etc. renting equipment, distribution, etc. More of a business course for the film producer from A to Z."
