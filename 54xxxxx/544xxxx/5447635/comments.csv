,narklo,2011-04-04T20:45Z,"Great movie, great quality (subtitles a little wonky but understandable).

My friends and I are big Jackie Chan and martial arts movie fans, and this was a welcome surprise. Jackie doesn't do much fighting himself, and it was surprising to see he's not the best fighter in the film. The movie is funny, has enough action, and has a great plot with an amazing ending.

Great upload!"
