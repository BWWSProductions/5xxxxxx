Peter Tosh & Word, Sound & Power.
Ahoy Hallen, 9-30-1983
Veronica's Rock Night show (re-prise)

Source>BASF T130>Pro Pix 2.1>Hard Drive>MPEG 2.

     This is a video which I copied from a friend in about 1991. I would have guessed that most people
would have it as it was a TV broadcast at some point in Holland. The VHS to MPEG is an amature
transfer at best, but still nice if you have not seen this one. There are moments when frames "go out",
or very short sound changes, but overall good. Equal Rights-Downpresser Man are my favorite tracks.
And since Mama Africa was an album I listened to growing up, it was nice to see Don Kinsey on this, as
his guitar is vastly what sticks in my brain from songs like Not Gonna Give It Up. Note, no editing was
made to this besides transferring, nor splitting into smaller video files. No worries from me if someone
want's to improve this...just keep the text/source.

ok above is orignal note's
with orignal lineage , just so you 
know origin's and how came too be !

this version differ's than the previous
there was audio issue's and just few minor
visual "glitch's" probably from orignal tape
as librarian told me , and must note on bush doctor
track that there is well probably only glitch unfixable
i tryed too fix but i was faceing a loss in data
and that was a thing i & librarian wish too avoid
so i left that, and its just 2.1 milli sec glitch in where tape 
jump's and audio drop's, ok now that is noted,be sure never too
repeat that for "we" know, this version i gave image small
smoothing tweak and audio complete restore and it is amazeing
bass is just right , and orignal lacked huge amound bass
plus went threw many other process's too enhancement and again
is fantstic for vhs sound. also this dvd have title screen
unlike any other dvd created by public and is first for me !
i realy don't need too add much more too this librarian did
super 2nd re encode on visual, as you will read from dvd title screen :)

any who this is final and hope you enjoy as i had much 
fun working on this for librarian and re shareing, dvd will
