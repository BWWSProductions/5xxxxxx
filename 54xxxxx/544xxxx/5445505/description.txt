The only copy of this movie I could find had burned-in foreign language subtitles.

What is odd, is that I found plenty of English language subtitles available for 

download. I wondered what down-loaders of these were doing with them. What I did 

was to display them at the top of the screen while trying to ignore years of 

instinct in looking for them at the bottom. It gave me a headache.


So I searched and found a piece of software designed to delete such burned-in 

subtitles. It worked--sort of. The results are displayed herein. What remains 

evident, is a jagged scar much less distracting than the original. In fact, 

depending on the background scene, it can be invisible. But in too many cases, 

enough debris remains to leave something to be desired.


At any rate, now other people around the world can plug in their local language

and better enjoy this third Bronte sister BBC costume drama. Read the text file.
