* Ray Harryhausen Presents 10th Muse 800 #1-4 (Bluewater Productions) [Could also be numbered as #800-803)
* 10th Muse Crossovers
* 10nth Muse God War Graphic Novel
* 10th Muse Round Two Graphic Novel

And then there's the 10th Muse Cover Gallery and 10th Muse: The Lost Issues series, which I think are coming soon or something (can't find proper release dates for anything Bluewater puts out)."
