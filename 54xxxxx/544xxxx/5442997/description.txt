IMDb's Top 250: #147 (User Rating: 8.2/10   88,679 votes)

Tagline: See the movie that's controversial, sacrilegious, and blasphemous. But if that's not playing, see The Life of Brian.

Directed by Terry Jones

Written by and Starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin

Though the film begins in "Judea, AD 33, Saturday afternoon, about tea time," technically this is not the story of Jesus at all. It follows instead a Judean contemporary, one Brian Cohen, who gets repeatedly mistaken for a messiah by overly zealous folks from the first day of his life right up to the last.

In the hands of the British Python troupe, who in today's pallid world look even more like giants of comedy than they originally did, Brian's story turns into a satire of the religious impulse, political correctness and anything else the Pythons can think of.
