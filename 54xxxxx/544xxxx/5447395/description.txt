             ZTreeWin is a fast and flexible text-mode                        
             file/directory manager for all versions of Windows.              
             It has been developed as the successor to the                    
             legendary DOS file-manager XTreeGold. Anyone who has             
             used that remarkable program would be aware of its               
             superior capabilities as a text-mode,                            
             tree-structured file-manager - but would also likely             
             be aware that its limited memory support, and lack               
             of long filename support are today a major issue.                
                                                                              
             ZTreeWin is a 32-bit Windows program that has been               
             developed to provide all the powerful functionality              
             of the past (and much more!), while avoiding all the             
             limitations of the old DOS-based program. A few                  
             advantages of ZTreeWin:                                          
             * Log millions of files, limited only by free memory             
             * Long file and directory names fully supported                  
             * Integration with most popular third-party                      
               archivers right out of the box                                 
                                                                              
             Here is just a sample of the enhancements in v2.x:               
             * Completely rewritten as a fully Unicode-enabled                
               application                                                    
             * Additional archiver support - FreeArc & UHARC                  
             * Enhanced color configuration                                   
             * Error logging and summary dialog                               
             * Extended statistics report of system and logon                 
               information                                                    
             * History lists support unlimited marked entries                 
             * Log directories using wildcards (Treespec &                    
               Ctrl-ZLog)                                                     
             * One way and two way branch synchronization                     
               (Alt-Mirror / F8 Sync)                                         
             * Pruning support for partially logged branches.                 
                                                                              
             Despite its DOS-like appearance, ZTreeWin is a full              
             32-bit Windows application that works easily and                 
             efficiently with modern operating systems, and fact,             
             does not run in DOS!                                             
                                                                              
             The now-standard "tree-structured" hierarchy of                  
             directories, invented by XTree, is displayed in the              
             top left corner, the files contained in the                      
             highlighted directory listed below left, disk and                
             file statistics on the right side, and                           
             keyboard-command menus at the bottom. And ZTree                  
             retains the fast keyboard-command text-mode response             
             that XTree pioneered and file management                         
             professionals still demand. ZTree also adds many                 
             other sophisticated tools, such as case-specific                 
             renaming functions, copy & paste facilities, and                 
             file type coloring, that are not only possible but               
             essential to modern 32-bit systems.                              
                                                                              
             ZTree is a true 32-bit application that makes use of             
             that environment to bring best-in-class, high

             file-management tasks, as well as unlimited command              
             history, and macro recording and playback. Any task
