,Kardansysoev,2010-03-18T10:56Z," Bumped into this by mere chance, now I wonder does it really help? I've been suffering from panic attacks and anxiety  for 3 years but  nothing really helped yet. If somebody can advice is it really effective as it is stated at the site?      "
,ctrl247,2010-03-18T16:09Z,"It does work but like it says in the book you have to do the diversions on a constant basis. I was an idiot and I half assed it  and I spent months flailing around in anxiety, Do it it works. I went from trapped in my house hugging the walls in anxiety to back at work and back to my normal self.  

A mantra that worked for me was ""Stop, think, Nine pillars, Divert"""
,Kardansysoev,2010-03-19T02:51Z,"Thank you for your comment, I'm already trying to divert, but may be  not too hard. Well we'll see it's about to finish download "
,curlykale,2010-04-03T18:39Z,This works but you must listen carefully. The key point is that panic attacks can't harm you!
,Orbiter,2010-06-07T16:02Z,"I have done this method before, and it worked. Sadly, I thought I was completly cured too soon and backslid. I'm walking up the steps again, knowing there is light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks for this upload."
,sweetlove00,2010-09-22T16:51Z,Thanks for the upload
,alchera,2011-01-23T12:45Z,Thank you very much for all your efforts.
,Nexxion,2011-01-25T02:04Z,"I slid into a bad state of GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), agoraphobia, and panic attacks last year. This program helped me to get out of it. 

Now this year I've backtracked a bit and anxiety hit me again. Thinking about it now, I really only, as ctrl247 said, half-assed it. I'm re-starting the program. If he helped me last year and I only half-assed it, this year when I go full at it, I hope to be done with anxiety for good. 

Thanks for this upload. As soon as I actually have money and am not trapped in my home unable to keep a job, I'd love to send Mr. Linden some money for his help."
,tabzd00d,2011-03-24T22:53Z,"I had my first panic attack a week ago and everyday has been hell so far, It's had to even wake up cause I know what I'm going to have to deal with all day. Went to the ER 3 days ago and they said everything was fine and just sent me away with some Xanax, thing is taking those don't work because I get anxious about becoming dependent on them. I just found out about this today and if it really works I'll forever be in your debt uploader."
,haveaquestion,2011-05-29T21:28Z,I hope this works
,CharlesLinden12345,2011-06-27T19:45Z,"The Linden Method won't work if you download it from here because MOST of the important material and guidance is missing. Also, you are breaking the law! "
,CharlesLinden12345,2011-06-27T19:50Z,"What is wrong with you people. Whilst I sleep, people download my programme (which won't help them in isolation because 3/4 of it is missing) and take money from us whilst I work 17 hour days to TRY to create enough income to help more and more people legitimately.... This stinks folks. You probabbly all think you are very clever but you are stealing from other anxious people that I can't reach because you are sapping the funds that allows me to reach out to them. My team are qualified specialists... would you steal from a hospital or clinic. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. "
,BakusPT,2011-06-28T09:47Z,"@CharlesLinden12345

Ive read tons of comments about this Linden Method... 50% of those comments were about how it doesnt work... With that negative publicity do u really think im paying $177 for this? If this is just 3/4 of the real deal consider it as a demo that will get you more ""clients""... And sadly...by your comments i feel that money is the only thing in your mind... But hey...im going to try this ""illegal"" version...if i find it helpful ill run and buy the real thing so u cant get more $177..."
,Medvetenhet,2011-10-03T15:53Z,"The Linden method will help you if you follow it. If you are helped then please buy his program cause it's worth every penny and Charles Linden deserves to get paid for this program, he have put his heart and soul for helping others. 

To being helped to get rid of inapropriate anxiety, panic attacks, OCD, PTSD and fobias for rest of your lifetime, you have to give something back to that person."
,mong5656,2012-03-11T14:48Z,"I already bought this a couple of years ago and like others have since backtracked a bit, unfortunately for me I no longer have access to the materials and as the year is up I can no longer log into the site, that is something that really pisses me off, I understand only getting one years support for the money paid but you should still be able to access the downloads on the site considering how much money is paid, i'd go one step further as to say if it really worked 100% then surely the anxiety and panic shouldnt come back? No harm Charles but while ur programme does help I do find you to be a money hungry businessman hiding under the guise of someone that cares"
