This Episode of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood aired Sunday Feb 28th, 2010 and was uploaded by [Eclipse] the same day, this episode included a tsunami warning map that was superimposed during the japanese broadcast. It was removed from the tracker on or around Tuesday March 2nd and replaced by an encoding from a different broadcast. 

I am seeding it for laughs.

Peace and Love,
