Wikipedia - Chaka Demus & Pliers were the first Jamaican act to have three consecutive Top 5 hits on the UK Singles Chart; a record unsurpassed until Shaggy scored four consecutive Top 5 hits in 2001. Their first hit, "Tease Me", stayed in the Top 5 of the UK Singles Chart, for three months in 1993, reaching number three in July. After releasing a cover of the Isley Brothers' "Twist and Shout", the song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, in early 1994. The re-release of their debut album Tease Me also charted at number one on the UK Albums Chart,
