I've only installed the 32bit version on three 32bit systems -- XP, Vista, and Windows 7.  All are running fine.  The only thing worth noting is that this crack does not enable Remote Access and Tandem Direct.

As for the 64bit system users, it would be helpful to know whether the 64bit version of JAWS 11 worked out or not."

This is a very unfortunate fact because it prevents users who are also blind or visually impaired from commenting and asking for help directly on the torrent page.  Knowing this, I will post up the transcripts of said emails to better address the problems that users might be experiencing.

Lastly, I have sent the operators of TPB correspondence through the main page requesting accessibility, which, ironically enough, also requires visual verification.

Hi Genious90,

Regarding the Webvisum.  I have heard of that addon for Firefox, but have yet to try it out myself.  For the benefit of myself and other users who are blind, would you tell us more about it -- where to get it, and how to get started.  Any quickstart guides or podcasts would be ideal.

As an update on the JAWS 11 crack, I've been working with 64bit users and we have tried a few plans, which failed to work.  Currently, there are a few more plans I have been researching, one of which involves the Windows driver signing to be disabled.  I will report back on any findings, be it in the positive or negative.

,Glitch01,2010-03-30T02:25Z,"Hi to all,

No fix update as of yet for the Win7 64bit crack; I am waiting on Win7 64bit users to report on their findings.

As for Win7 32bit users having problems applying the crack, turn off User Account Control.  Open control panel and select Action Center. Select ""Change User Account Control settings"" and turn UAC OFF.

An alternative method is to use the search field on the Start Menu.
- Press the Windows key to open the Start Menu
- Then, since the cursor is already in the search field, type the letters U A C.  A dropdown list will appear with possible matches
- Select ""Change User Account Control Settings"" and press enter.
- In the window that appears, tab once to the ""Notification Level Slider"".
- sliding the marker all the way down will turn UAC off.
- Tab once more and activate the OK button.
- Continue with applying the crack.

That is awesome!

I've been researching on the net and found a few more JAWS 11 cracks in preparation for our project, but it is great that you figured it out.  I have to know, how did you do it?

There are a few other people who emailed me with similar problems, and there are additional people wanting assistance with problems pertaining to the 64bit edition, too.

I kind of wish they posted the messages on the torrent page so others could help too.  In hindsight, maybe including my email wasn't such a grand idea.

I know that the registration process on TPB requires visual varification through CAPTCHA.  Not accessible if one is blind.  Ergo, I added my email to the text file.  I sent a few messages to the operators of TPB requesting accessibility, but I have not heard from them yet.  Perhaps a group of pirates who are blind should be formed.

Anyway, I am interested in how you worked out the JAWS 11 problem.

G. on Wed, March 24, 2010 said:

Heya.
What I did was quite easy:
I got some advice to turn off user account control. Ok, done it. Tried to apply the patch, nothing... then replaced the files manually, nothing again.
Then I installed a kind of dongle emulator and after that it works!

After that I tried to get them working separately, the weird thing was, they didn't, so they only worked for me together.

I think the same thing works on 64 bit as well, cause this emulator should be for both, 32 bit and 64 bit.

Although I feel a little bit bad about disabling user account control, I've been a quite long xp user, so I'm sure I can survive without it. :) In addition, I know a bit about what I install on my machine. :P

If you want, I can send you the emulator tomorrow in msn.

I just wish they'd included tandom support by coming up with a serial number that lasted more than a minute like the jaws 10 crack's serial number only
lasts for a minute on tandom.
I'm thinking sense these are authrozed through a software based dongle find someone who has a leagle jaws and give the crack there serial number.
What do you think?

Hi J.,

I had used the Tandem crack for JAWS 10 as well, and it worked for a long time.  It has been a longer time since I used Tandem on JAWS 10, but a reason to consider is that the serial number might have gotten blacklisted by Freedom Scientific.  Now, if the coders were to come up with a serial key generator, that would be something special.

I'll ask around, but in the meantime try disabling the User Account Control before installing JAWS 11 and running the autocrack.
If the autocrack doesn't work, then you will have to manually copy the files in the crack folder and replace the ones in the installation directory.  Note: copy the two folders named ""JAWS"" and ""JAWS Runtime"" and paste it in ""C:, Program Files, Freedom Scientific"".  There should already be directories there of exact names, so when it asks if you want to replace the files, say yes to all.

Thank you for being detailed in your descriptions; it does help a great deal.  As for your problem with the JAWS 11 64bit crack, there is a plan B.

I have researched and obtained another JAWS 11 crack for both 32bit and 64bit that sounds promising.  I will clean it up, and then upload only the 64bit version to a server for you to download and review.  Note that I have not tested this second set myself, and am relying on you to try it out.

,Glitch01,2010-04-14T21:16Z,"The good thing about this second set is that some instructions actually came with it, although it is a little unclear when it comes time to apply the crack.
From my understanding...
First, copy all four crack files and replacing them in
C:\Program Files\Freedom Scientific\JAWS\11.0\
Then, copy just the JFW.exe then replacing it in
C:\Program Files\Freedom Scientific\JAWS Runtime\11.0\

It just occurred to me to compare the size of the four cracks in the ""JAWS"" directory belonging to the first set you already have with the size of the four cracks in the second set that you don't have, and they match up exactly.  This leads me to believe that the first set you have might work, but copy and replace all four cracks to the ""JAWS"" directory, and then copy and replace only the JFW.exe to the ""JAWS Runtime"" directory.

Try this first with the set you already have, and then if it doesn't work, click on the following link to download the second set.

Hi N.,

I am glad that you're not giving up on this because I need someone to work with me on this.  Even though I only use the x86 crack, I have been seriously working on this x64 puzzle, and I am not giving up the ghost on it yet.  Besides, there are a few more options.  It's funny, you know, when I think that all the options are used up, there comes a few more to try.  When the time comes and we've run all the options into the ground, I'll reluctantly raise up a white flag.

Also, I hear you on how important the program is to a blind person.  And props to you for looking out for your friend.

Onwoard...

Can you confirm that the following procedure does not work.

1.  Uninstall all JAWS 11 components and start from scratch.
2.  Turn off U A C.
3.  Restart computer and disable Digital Signature Enforcement through F8 option screen.
4.  After Windows 7 loads, install JAWS 11 then apply the crack.  (Either apply the crack as stated in the first set or the second set.  I am not sure if it makes a difference, but try both options).
5.  Again, restart computer and disable Digital Signature Enforcement through F8 option screen.
6.  Start JAWS 11.

Once we confirm that this does not work, we can move on to the next option, which requires a third set for me to upload and for you to download.

I'll hear from you later,

Hi N.,

When I had requested confirmation, I wasn't asking that you actually run through the steps; I Apologize if it came across that way.  I had  only wanted a confirmation that the listed process didn't work.  All in all, I received the confirmation and I agree with you that we must move on.

As stated in the previous email, there is another set of cracks that I will attach directly to this email since it is small enough.  Needless for me to suggest that you run CCleaner since you are already doing that; thanks for that bit of information.  Note that this next set involves a new set of cracks very different from the other two sets.  Let's hope it will work this time around.

If not, there is a final option, and it is to use ""Time Stopper"", an application that claims to extend a trial version of an application indefinitely.  I will also attach it to this email.  Note that I am not certain that this is for a 32bit or 64bit system or both as the documentation did not state either or.  In my own opinion, the chance of this solution working is rather low.  The reasoning is that the JAWS demo ends after 40 minutes, and Time Stopper sounds like it works for trial applications that end after a specific date.  That said, try it if you think it would help.

If that final option does not work, then I am out of ideas.  White flag.

The remaining thing to do is to wait for the original cracker to figure out a JAWS 11 64bit crack that actually works.  Hmm, I wonder why he or she released something that didn't even work.  I guess I have to just be content with not knowing; I haven't the slightest idea of how to locate that person's email to even send a message.

Hi ulrich1984,

I attempted to do an update from within JAWS to the next release.  What I discovered is that the dazy training files are downloadable from the list of updates, but do not check the JAWS upgrade for download as it will render the crack unusable.  Reapplying the previous crack to the new version will not work and cause JAWS 11 to display an error message.  I surmise that, in this case, the crack is JAWS version specific.  In order to get JAWS 11 to work again, I ran the installation executable and ran the repair feature.  Afterwards, I reapplied the crack.  I've yet to restart my computer as recommended, but will do so after posting this message.  If it doesn't work, then I intend to uninstall JAWS 11 completely and do a reinstall.

I have used it with Jaws v10 on Windows xp with success. Of cource I ran on a 32 bit system! I think this is a interesting thread and I have done a little bit researching myself. Yesterday I upgraded to Vista 64 bit and I ran the same version of Jaws as i described first with the same dongle emu. The strange thing was that it seems that Jaws wouldn't recognize  the emu... 1. Does the dongle emu support Vista 64 bit? I cant test it on a Vista 32 bit myself. I want to eliminate these  possible reasons why it doesn't work: The dongle emu supports 64 bit Vista? 2. Is the problem related to Vista itselfs? Of cource I have disabled UAC and  done the driver signing trick! Someone else which can confirm that the dongle emu works on Vista 32 bit Jaws 10? Maybe I later will come up with a possible solution.   
,christer.26,2010-04-18T21:29Z,...Hi. If someone have an original hardware dongle with is supported of v11 of Jaws I mean that it is possible to make a dump of the dongle key.

Hi TPB, this is Glitch,

Very recently, I received an email from a user claiming that JAWS 11 was successfully installed on a Windows 7 x64 machine.

I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt and post the email here and have any x64 users attempt to reproduce the process to get the same result.  Seeing how I don't have an x64 machine, I cannot varify on my end, so I am relying on others to post their findings.

Let's hope it doesn't sound too good to be true.  :)

Now for the email...

Hay bro. I have good news. I installed jaws 11.0 in my windows7 64bit successfully. First I turned the uac off then installed the jaws and when I first applied the crack, it didn?t work so I tried re-installing the jaws using the option on the installation. I clicked repair jaws and there is an option which will allow you to remove the old settings so I choose that option and continue with the installation. After waiting a few minutes the installation was done and a dialog popped out asking me to restart the system and I clicked ""No"". Then I go to the folder where the crack is located, pressed enter once on the crack and no reaction at all, then pressed enter once more then boom! The startup wizard is on the go! :) Please share it to our blind community... send me email for the updates. Thanks.

Glitch again...

Once more, for those who are interested in trying this out, do so, and post the results.  Thank you.

,christer.26,2010-05-18T18:28Z,As usual the method from the mail didn't work. Glitch01: If you want other people to test out things they have to test it properly! A friend of mine tested it out and it took only 6 minuts to confirm that this method either worked to!! No suprising since none of the methods in these 28 postings here didn't work...Better to wait for a better crack and please fuck up complaining its working. These sort is nearly called spamming. Fuck and shit...No real fakta.

Hi TPB, this is Glitch,

I am trying to take the previous flame mail seriously in order that I might compose an adequate response, but I just can't.  do forgive me?  lol...  :)

I know for a fact that the supplied DLL-file for the 64-bit version was apparently the 32-bit version. Before going off to mock about how bad it is that the thing doesn't work, it may be nice to fix this?"

Hi LadyGem_98,

Legend has it that LadyGem_98 said, ""I know for a fact that the supplied DLL-file for the 64-bit version was apparently the 32-bit version.""

Thank you for bringing that fact to my attention.  Regardless, with this bit of information, there is nothing that I can do to ""fix"" the x64 crack.  I am not the creator.

I am curious, as to whom are you addressing when you say, ""Before going off to mock about how bad it is that the thing doesn't work, it may be nice to fix this?""

If that remark had been addressed to me, I would reply by saying that, as stated in the previous postings and in the torrent description, I am not the creator, but just someone helping to share something that I find to be useful.  Also, AS an extension of that, I had written a guide to the installation and crack where there had been originally none.

,LadyGem_98,2010-05-23T09:30Z,"No, Glitch, I was referring to the numerous sources on the Internet that find it rather uncomfortable to not have their favorite product ""ready for use"" the day that it gets launched. In fact, I appreciate your hard work!
Now, knowing that you must have obtained this JFW package from somebody, who got it from somebody, and so on... may there be a chance of tracing the original awesome person behind this all? This would greatly simplify matters.
I know that it HAD something to do with version numbers. Quite interesting and all. But I say HAD because this was back with good ol' version 10. So far I haven't had any luck with v11. But then, so far I haven't really tried hard. ;-)"
,Ulrich1984,2010-05-28T15:32Z,"Hi everyone!
Since there is JAWS 11.0.1447 out now, it would perhaps be best if there is a possibility to crack the jfw.exe and jhook.dll so that the demo version sticks at the 40 minutes, so the time does not count down. I have already tried TimeStoper but that didn't work. Does anyone know of a program that can stop that 40-minute countdown? So we could create a crack ourselves.
Although this is a very simple way of cracking Jaws and that doesn't enable Remote Access or Tandem, I would appreciate that method of cracking, and FS cannot make security updates to fix this.

Thanks,
Ulrich1984"

Hi LadyGem_98,

Thanks for setting straight my understanding, and I thank you so much for your appreciation.  It is amazing how little of that there is amongst users here in the piracy realm.

As for tracing down the original crackers, they still remain as allusive as the perverbial needle in a haystack.  What we need is an equally perverbial high powered magnet to urge them out.  Alas, I am sure they remain as undiscovered as they are for perfectly good reasons.

Hi Ulrich1984,

I think that your idea of finding a way to stop the 40 minute limit is an excillent solution.  The next step is to find someone with cracking skills who can do something like that.  Any volunteers?

,supanut,2010-05-29T03:08Z,"Any updates to Jaws 11 crack?
I'm waiting for working cracks that works with multiple versions of Jaws, and must also work in future versions of Jaws, like the dongle emulator for Jaws 10, but it didn't work with Jaws 11.
Please, any updates tell me."
,Ulrich1984,2010-06-03T14:28Z,"Hi, does anyone know of a program that can stop time countdowns? Such as TimeStopper? TimeStopper can stop trial versions that expire after a certain date, but is it also possible to stop the clock time of a program? Or is there a program that resets the clocktime every 10 or 20 minutes, so the countdown begins again? This is not only great for Jaws cracking, but also for Magic! And in all those programs whose trial versions work a certain amount of time. I hope you understand it right, I don't mean TimeStopper that freezes a program to a certain date, but it should freeze it at a certain clock time.
I hope you can help me.

Thanks,
Ulrich1984"
,christer.26,2010-06-05T22:33Z,"Unfortunelly a time stopper witch just could freeze the system time in Windows wouldn't work. Jaws have a own time registration module gbuildt in which makes the registration of time undependently of the system clock. Therefor will modification of the system time dont affect the time countdown in Jaws... This is not the right way to go. If someone have a hardware usb dongle for Jaws it would  be possible to maybe come up with a working solution... If someone here have a hardware dongle for Jaws please, please post it so I know..  More info will be given."

I've been looking all over the net and find nothing, I'm desperately want to use this new update!
Also, I want a crack for Magic Screen Magnification 11.0.3046.
Please, produce working crack that works with more than one version of Jaws."
,Ulrich1984,2010-06-07T19:53Z,"Hi,
is it perhaps possible to at least increase the time the demo version of Jaws runs? e.g. from 40 minutes to 32768 or 65536 minutes?"
,supanut,2010-06-08T14:40Z,Maybe could you hack jfw.exe and jhook.dll files with resource hacker and remove the demo limitation?
,supanut,2010-06-12T05:32Z,"Sorry to bump comment;
But I'm fet up of waiting. Why it took so long to even crack one version of Jaws.
Other software's crack are release around 2-3 days after the software was release but Jaws took around months for the cracks to be available.
Come on, I'm very desperate of waiting."

Hello Glitch,

I am Ramaditya, a blind computer user from Indonesia.

I believe you've got many e-mails about JAWS 11 crack for 64-bit version.

Well, I have a 64-bit Windows 7 based laptop and I am currently
running JAWS 11. It's a bit tricky though, but I believe this method
works for me.

First of all, just install Jaws 11 and run JAWS. Let it runs on demo
mode because we will need it to do these steps.

1. First go to a location which is easy to be accessed, for example C:\.

2. Make two empty folders called ""1"" and ""2"" (you may create the
folders using whatever name you like, but this one is easier).

3. Copy the folder ""JAWS v11.0.756 64bit Crack"" and the file ""Apply
crack and start JAWS 11"" into folder ""2"".

4. This step will be a bit difficult. First of all, go to folder ""1""
and copy the folder ""JAWS v11.0.756 64bit Crack"" and the file ""Apply
crack and start JAWS 11"" just exactly what you did on step 3. The
difference is, you must replace all cracked files with the original
one (Go to untouch JAWS installation folder, usually C:\Program
Files\Freedom Scientific, and copy from there). So?

C:\1 - contains JAWS original files
C:\2 - contain JAWS cracked files

5. If you have done those steps above correctly, then you are ready to
go. Note that because of this trick we cannot use automatic startup
function of JAWS (the trick won't work). And, you don't need to do
those 4 steps again, remember that. It is only for first preparation!

So what to do to run JAWS?

Like I told you before, please disable automatic startup function of
JAWS. It means JAWS will not run when you turn the computer on.

When the Windows startup sound can be heard, press WIN+R to bring the
RUN dialog box. In there, type C:\1 and press ENTER. After that, press
A (to go to the apply crack batch file) and press ENTER. Jaws will run
in demo mode (uncracked).

Just play along. Operate your computer for about 3 to 5 minutes. And
then, turn JAWS off and press WIN+R to bring RUN dialog box again.
This time, type C:\2 and press ENTER. Press A then ENTER. If it works,
JAWS will run in crack mode (no time limitation).

But if JAWS does not run (ERROR message appears), go to C:\1 and press
A and ENTER to run the demo again and wait for several minutes, turn
JAWS off and go to C:\2 and press A then ENTER.

----------

I absolutely don't know how this trick works because I just tried many
kinds of experimental actions. But, perhaps by sharing this then it
will give (and hopefully helps) fellow blind users that cannot enjoy
JAWS 11 64-bit.

I guarantee that this trick works for me. I will be more than glad to
make video if need be.

Thanks!
