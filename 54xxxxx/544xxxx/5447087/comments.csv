,peon1,2010-03-22T21:32Z,"Starring: Barry Van Dyke,Greg Evigan and Brian Wimmer. Written By : Geoff Meed and Directed By : Shane Van Dyke. This western movie DVD was really good,Lots of gunplay and characters stayed true to themselves. A great cast with some surprises from new comers ? Carey Van Dyke( redeemed gunslinger) and Erin Marie Hogan( Boss Saloon Girl). Barry Van Dyke finally got a role that befits all he exudes in persona. Sage Mears brings all the female hutzpah (google it) not seen in 'True Grit' or 'High Noon'. Geoff Meed wrote himself a villain in all classical senses ,Almost 'A-Picture' level ! The music was amazing?Need to mention. One last thought: Anya Benton ALMOST stole the movie in a scene that would take a "" Spoiler Alert"" to post"
