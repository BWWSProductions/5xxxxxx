,glasswings21,2010-03-19T17:55Z, Oh yeah may be this one looks promising but certainly don't like the other upload of UAV predator which is useless addon ever made for FSX this one's gotta be cool.
,chuckmamuck,2010-03-19T18:55Z,"@glasswings21.
i agree about the predator, im not too keen on abacus products, i saw someone requested the carrier strike force and i found the predator in the same place on direct download so i put it up. i installed it to test it works and had a play for 10mins but i didnt really get it, im sure some will enjoy them but i didnt keep them installed for long.

ive been wanting this dc-9 for ages, ive found it twice before but both crashed FSX when selecting the dc-9 at first run after install, i heard a fix was called gaugesound.dll but i could never find it. alot of people had the same problem, and with the md-11 also. i found this on a direct download earlier today, i installed it, selected dc-9 and it loaded all the models into fsx with no probs. been flying it for the last few hours and its excellent, its a shame all flight sim aircraft aint of this high quality. maybe we'd pay for them if they were. i dl'd the wilco b777 also but its already on here, thats a great quality product too.
i'll just keep looking and when i find something thats not on the bay i'll ul it, whats crap to most of can be good to others, and abacus products need to be shared for free cus they really aint worth buying."
,glasswings21,2010-03-19T20:42Z,"""chuckmamuck"" yeah 100% agreed on whatever you just mentioned,and i am glad finally you're able to get hands on this decent addon which is actually a working DC-9 and yeah the abacus products are the lamest paywares i've ever seen in my life i am a huge fan of PMDG and then WILCO because these 2 are the ones with the most accurate cockpit environment around to work with in the world of Flight Simulation...and also we do appreciate your work in uploading all the good stuff down here and don't hesitate to share anything at all which is worthy to have for FSX ;).....!"
,glasswings21,2010-03-19T21:58Z,OK and now the bad news is the crash is happening to me now the moment i select the aircraft in FSX boom!!! there where it crashes just like the way you mentioned here i wonder if there would be a FIX or something that you could suggest or else i would end up removing it from my FSX which i would surely regret because i always wanted to fly this bird....

i installed this dc-9 differently this time to what i did the twice last year when it crashed on me.
basically, before install i right clicked on the exe and clicked properties/compatibility then checked the run as administrator box and checked the run in compatibility mode and selected windows xp sp3.
i then clicked the exe, installed and didnt get the crashing, the aircraft loaded as normal when i selected them.
try uninstalling, clean ya registry then install in xp sp3 mode and as administrator. thats what i did differently to last time and it worked."
,chuckmamuck,2010-03-19T23:03Z,"@glasswings21
BTW, im running win7 ultimate 64bit, i remember when trying to install last time i got the box popping up after install saying this program might not have installed correctly and then the crashing of FSX before the plane loads.
after installing this time in xp sp3 mode and as administrator i didnt get that box pop up and it loaded properly.  "
,skierr,2010-03-20T10:29Z,"Pellefin the same for me.
it doesn't work under Win7 64bit
:-("
,glasswings21,2010-03-20T12:49Z,"I am also using the Win7 ultimate 64bit and the crash is happening tried to reinstall like almost 10times now but no success,"
,belltaco,2010-03-20T12:54Z,"all you guys with crash during aircraft load, this thing REQUIRE gaugesound.dll placed in the main FSX folder, here is one: http://www.****upload.com/?d=C4XL117R
(instead ''****'' is ''mega'')
download and copy this thing to the main FSX folder and everything will be ok"
,skierr,2010-03-20T14:05Z,"Hey belltaco, you are right!!!!!!
Now it works.
If i like it i'll buy it.
thanks"
,klyd971,2010-03-20T15:37Z,"hi, 
works wit that gauge.dll, but my flaps R inop and trim is weird too high or too long on landings..."
,chuckmamuck,2010-03-20T17:35Z,"@belltaco.
nice work fella, thankyou. 8)"
,glasswings21,2010-03-20T21:23Z,"Ok cool ""belltaco"" will try it out and see how it works.....thanks for the missing file though...."
,chuckmamuck,2010-03-20T21:38Z,"to get the flaps to work you have to switch the hydraulics on, if you look over to the co-pilots side just above the flaps lever theres 3 switches, switch them on and flaps are working. 
to ease the trim i went into controls and took of the repeat function on the trim button which made it alot better."
,klyd971,2010-03-21T23:10Z,"@belltaco & @chuckmamuck

THX, WORKS FINE..."

,fsxvzla,2010-05-29T02:33Z,Somebody know how apply SP2 to this DC9?
,DVA8452,2011-03-05T04:53Z,"I gotta question. Last time I tried this, I was running Windows Vista x64.  When I ran the repaint manager and it wouldn't work.  Does anyone know if the repaint manager works with Windows 7 x64?"
,IReview,2012-04-26T01:20Z,"BE ADVISE, TORRENT Might make your FSX Crash. I ran the installation correctly and ran it as Administrator. Some people may not get this issue but so far MOST People have had issues. Thanks for the Upload but to anyone thinking of downloading this just no that It may not work. :("
,Taco92,2012-05-28T04:05Z,Thank you very much.
