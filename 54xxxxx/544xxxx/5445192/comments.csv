Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-03-19T14:02Z,"@20-40. I won't download for another 3-4 hours, at least, not before there are at least 4 but preferably 10+ seeds.

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-19T14:56Z,"@Jon: You're too kind. In initial swarm are people who cannot and want not to read and learn. You have 32+ kB/s and there were 600 with ""I gave others a shit"" settings.
They rather ""killed"" everyone else in initial seeding phase then to wait 92 minutes and download in 10. Well, my friend... believe me, you probably would finish before some of them who were banned for misdoings."
,jon4fun,2010-03-19T15:01Z,"@ 20-40, I appreciate the fact that 'I might finish' due to them being banned.
BUT, someone has to start doing the RIGHT thing and actually reading and acting on your statements in torrent.

I know I have a slow upload speed so I would slow things down AND I can wait for a few hours to start downloading.

My world won't end if I have to wait a bit longer to see a show.

Cheers
