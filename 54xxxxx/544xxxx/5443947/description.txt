SimpleKeys 2 is a complete rewrite of the popular f-key shortcut program. Now in addition to programing your function keys, SimpleKeys allows you to:

â€¢ Specify what applications a shortcut is active in.

â€¢ Execute an action with any key combination

â€¢ Now types as fast as the recieving application can accept keystrokes

â€¢ Create Macros by combining multiple actions under a single KeyStroke

â€¢ Import and Export Settings

â€¢ Supports drag and drop of shortcuts to and from the items list. This allows you to email a shortcut to a friend, or save it for later.

â€¢ Execute AppleScripts on the files selected in the finder or using the text on the clipboard.

â€¢ Supports all special accented characters.

â€¢ Type text, including the date, the text on the clipboard, and any KeyCombo (ie. Apple-S to save a file)

â€¢ Paste text, including the date.

â€¢ Pause to wait for events to complete.

â€¢ Launch a file with the default application, or with a specific application.

â€¢ Open a URL in your default web browser.

System Requirements:
