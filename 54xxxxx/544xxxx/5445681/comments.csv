,JJammin1,2010-03-26T19:49Z,"Yeah, s07e10 aired, but nobody has posted it yet."
,Dakota85,2010-03-27T04:39Z,"lol I just don't understand how they can post it exactly that night one week, and then a completely random day the following week. On the plus side, they uploaded Shear Genius as it aired which was awesome lol."
,laptopdog,2010-03-27T05:19Z,It's just weird that nobody on PB seems to have uploaded it (altho it did definitely air). They've been slow to upload it in the past so I guess I'll just wait.. and hope.. and wait.. Am just afraid that I'll accidentally find out who was eliminated before I get to see the show!
,Dakota85,2010-03-27T07:03Z,"lol @ Laptopdog i've got the EXACTLY the same problem. Its hard for me cos i'm in OZ and read alot of my TV news from US sites, so its hard to avoid... its even worse with Idol / Shear Genius / SYTYCD.

Dont' worry though - its worse for Oz shows... i'm grateful they put them up, but consistency would be great - some weeks they don't upload the next ep at all lol."
,laptopdog,2010-03-27T09:52Z,"@Dakota85 - I'm in Australia too, so I know exactly what you mean!"
,Dakota85,2010-03-27T10:57Z,"Woot! I'm glad someone understands!

SYTYCD & GNW have driven me nuts lately - because of that Piratebay crash neither show was uploaded so I had to find them elsewhere which is nowhere near as easy to download lol.

On the plus side, the NZ shows like Sensing Murder & Masterchef are regular and really well uploaded esp since I didn't even know they were on lol."
,JJammin1,2010-03-27T23:44Z,"This episode was released yesterday. Since the torrent never showed up, I ended up searching and finding it on filestube.com."
