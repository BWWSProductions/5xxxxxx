                        "The downside of this rip is that the DVD
                         (PAL version) didn't have english subtitles
                         - the actors are and speak German."

         SChiZO is one of the longest living MPEG-4 release groups
         in the scene. Since our inception in March of 2001 we have
         been catering to the needs of DivX enthusiasts everywhere
         by releasing high-quality DVDRips of the finest films from
         around the world. Our dedication to quality is shown by the
         lack of any technical nukes in our 200+ release history.
         In recent months we have continued to grow as we established
         our TV division, PHRENiC, dedicated to bringing the SChiZO
         philosophy to the TVRips scene.

         SChiZO does not have any public means of contact, nor do we
         plan to add any. Remember, we do this for fun and don't
         respond to unsolicited offers from unknown people.
