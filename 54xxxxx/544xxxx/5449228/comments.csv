,DrChandra,2010-03-21T14:09Z,"very good quality though. excellent sound and actually 1280 pixels wide. no flicker, good geometry, sharp.
needs a bit of level adjustment, has some vignetting, typical cam temporal frame overlap because the fps isn't synced and a bit of green tint. 
but overall very nice quality. 
watchable on HD projector"
