[color=orange]Notes::::::::::::::::::[/color]
thought id do a xvid as only x264 out...things would be alot easier if the
dupe frames and bad ivtc would be fixed on original release but meh, anyway
only added slight video denoise as it took 8hours on 2 pass as it is:(
encoded this twice 1st time i set output at 220mb instead of 2.2gb :lol:
anyway some of you may say this is a pointless release of a 720p ts, but a 480p
on a 42inch tv will look ok, yet a 720p ts on 42inch tv will look much better :P
