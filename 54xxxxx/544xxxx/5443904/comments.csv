,riptyde,2010-03-20T22:54Z,"While your thePirateBay.org guide gives the user a rudimentary understanding of thePiratebay.org, I feel it is lacking and narrowly thought out. 

New users should, first, take precautions before entering thepiratebay.org's main site. New users should consider using popup and javascript script blockers, so as not to get hijacked by advertisers and whatnot. Perhaps, you should suggest they use Firefox with the Noscript add-on. By completely Noscript blocking thepiratebay.org, user can roam thepiratebay.org without those pesky ads, and whatnots, jacking their browsers. But also make sure that the users know that script blocking software will not prevent them from getting a virus from a download.  

Second, new users should feel confident in downloading from skull marked uploaders. However, they need to realize how and why those uploaders were marked with the skull of approval. Also, they must realize that non-skull marked users can be just as trustworthy; skull marked uploaders were once non-skull uploaders at some point. And skull marked uploaders sometimes leave thepiratebay?whatever happened to Heartbug or kentuckykid(?) and the hundreds of other uploaders who used to frequent  thepiratebay.org?

Under this same logic, users should be cautious. There many uploaders on here who distribute viruses and scam spam. For example, there is an uploader called Anonymous who uploads fake videos (I think its a bot). People out the videos a Fake all the time; yet, I've downloaded ebooks from Anonymous that were completely real w/ no viruses. Are they the same uploader? I'm not sure.

Basically, users can usually trust the seeders/leecher count, but ultimately you will get a real virus. It's inevitable!They should be prepared to lose their files, and have to start from scratch. (Backup your important files on another disk.) 

Another thing you missed, the uploaders main concern, seeding. If you download a torrent, you should be willing to seed that torrent. The whole torrent system collapses, if users do not seed. Leave the torrent in the torrent software for a week, a month, until that torrent becomes irrelevant?copy the actual files wherever you need them?keep the original files in your download folder. Other people want to download those files too. 

I probably missed something too.              "
,NiMaKiNiCk,2010-03-21T00:29Z,Thanks for the info. I'll add it to #3. This one will be way much more useful!
,Doogie12,2010-03-21T04:26Z,"Here's a real guide. If you can figure out how to download this in the first place you have the basics down.

2nd - don't download a 74.18 KiB file from a user NiMaKiNiCk that only has 2 files on the pirate bay both of which are way smaller than a regular file size and are consistent with a virus. Also look for green symbol by user name to indicate the person is trusted."
,NiMaKiNiCk,2010-03-21T05:47Z,"First off you moron ass faggot, OF COURSE it's 74.18 KiB of DL because it's a very small PDF YOU DUMB FUCK! Also, I might not have a green skull which means VIP because I'm not a fucking VIP but really you should look out for PINK skulls! Dumb ass, I am only trying to help! BTW you're a retarded ass bitch who talks shit about me of only uploading two files, when your the dumb ass who only uploaded one! so do the world a favor and get your piece of shit excuse for a human and jump off a bridge into a lake with no water! And Ill make your five dollar ass into change bitch!"
