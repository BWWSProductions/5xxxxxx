You. Are. The. Man :)


I wanted to buy the Trilogy edition SO BAD but I just didn't have the money and now the prices are going through the roof for the last ones out there and are mostly sold out so I rather bought God of War Collection (Gow 1&2 disc) for ÂŁ30.49.. = 33.80 euros from Amazon.co.uk and bought God of War 3... Now I can even enjoy the soundtracks!

Thanks so much!"
