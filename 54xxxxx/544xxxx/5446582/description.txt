Wikipedia - 9 is the second studio album by Irish singer, songwriter and producer Damien Rice, released in 2006. The album was released on 3 November in Ireland, 6 November in the United Kingdom, and on 14 November in the US. It was followed by the single "9 Crimes," which was released on 27 November 2006. The record was certified gold in the UK. The record was released to mixed critical and fan reaction. NME gave the record 4/10, branding it with the rather unflattering phrase of "Ikea Rock". On the other hand, a review from Hotpress mentioned that "If Rice really was a nervous wounded-wing, there's no way he'd skirt as close to Nick Drake comparisons as he does on 'The Animals Are Gone'" and, mentioning some of the 'noise' on the first track "9 Crimes", that "there's another noise that can be made out faintly but distinctly-the sound of the Grays, LaMontagnes, Johnsons and the Blunts of this world breaking their pencil tips on their jotters in sheer envy and frustration". Both Mojo and Q gave it 4/5, with the latter branding Rice very much in the positive as "The King Of Pain" and The Sunday Times made the record their 'Album of the Week' and it was People Magazine's Critic Choice in November 2006. 

Amazon.co.uk Review By James Berry - Four years is a dreadfully long time to wait for an album from anyone, let alone a man renowned for his fierce independence, who could no doubt make an acoustic guitar weep merely by stepping into an adjoining room. But finally, the long-awaited follow up to the quietly inventive and universally-acclaimed O arrives. And those who have followed the evolutions in his live act since 2002 may be surprised to hear that there is such a seamless transition between that album and 9. His sophomore record offers affirmation rather than progression, but what a rewarding set it is regardless; gradual and accomplished. It's hard to contrast too intently with past work when each song demands such focused immersion from the listener. Full band pieces such as the perky and most conventional "Rootless Tree", the rattled Jeff Buckley-esque riffing of "Me, My Yoke & I" and the eventual explosive climax of the brilliant Radiohead style ballad "Elephant" are noticeably cohesive, but his real strength remains alone with his broken, weighty voice and soft, tentative steps down his piano keyboard. "9 Crimes" and "Sleep Don't Weep", both enhanced by the angelic fortitude of vocalist Lisa Hannigan, are immediate highlights. And "Accidental Babies" is heartbeat-stealing in its lonely beauty, the kind of private counsel you would happily wait years for.
