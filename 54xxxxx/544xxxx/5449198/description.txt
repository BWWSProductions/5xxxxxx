        It is the last episode of the series, and Harry is sure to   
        have something special up his sleeve. Over the course of the 
        series, the big-collared TV teaser has unearthed some        
        classic moments from Burp favourites including Lark Rise to  
        Candleford, Popstar to Operastar, and Muslim Driving School, 
        and this edition features more hilarious clips. Plus, find   
        out which knitted entry will triumph in the mighty K Factor  
        as Harry reveals the winner of the Not Live Final!
