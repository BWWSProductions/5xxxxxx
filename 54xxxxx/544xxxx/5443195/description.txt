 BinÃ¤rpilot is an electronic music project by Alexander StÃ¸ver, a musician from BodÃ¸. All of his discography is freely available online through various netlabels as well as The Pirate Bay. While many BinÃ¤rpilot tracks are instrumental chiptunes-style tracks, other make use of vocoder vocals and are more dance inspired. BinÃ¤rpilot has also remixed various music by other musicians such as Daft Punk.

Some would say that as well as very danceable, BinÃ¤rpilotâ€™s songs also carry a more poetic side, that some songs also are inspired by classical music.

The music by BinÃ¤rpilot is difficult to define with the use of only one genre, as the music strafes many different genres in its course.
