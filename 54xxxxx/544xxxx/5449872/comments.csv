,bamsen82,2010-04-10T09:07Z,how many Episodes are there of FullMetal Alchemist
,Tarson,2010-04-17T23:45Z,"There are 51 episodes plus one full length movie in the original series.

Brotherhood, a VERY good remake of the original series will have 56 episodes.  Currently they have 52 episodes released with English subtitles, new episodes streaming every Thursday at Funimations website.  The DVD/Blue Ray will begin to be released with English Dub on May 25th.

As far as I know, there is no mention of a full length movie for Brotherhood.

On a personal note:  If you liked the original series, you will absolutely love Brotherhood.  I'm not a fan of anime but I have yet to miss an episode since I began watching around episode 6."

,DocEvil,2010-05-25T08:55Z,For fuck sake..has anybody in this swarm heared of port forwarding? I'm only connecting to 3 out of 10 seeders. Normally a 30% connection would be hot as hell...but I'm barly getting 15kb/s! Your uploading speeds are horrid! STOP BUYING MODEMS AT WALMART AND LEARN HOW TO CORRECTLY SEED!
,DocEvil,2010-05-27T01:01Z,"@bamsen82
There will be 56 episodes, but only 5 of them have been dubbed into english so far. You can find a crap load of the original Jap-language ones and English Subs...but if you want dubs  you'll have to wait.

Also..I'm trying to seed, but hardly anybody is connecting to me. I'm set to pump out over 1mb/s but I'm only sending .2kb/s....seriously, look at my post above. Find out how to port forward and stop being such goddamn nubs."
,ThePalindorme,2010-06-01T23:50Z,errr. last time i heard the episode number crossed 63
,bamsen82,2010-06-10T23:04Z,yo.. if there are 56 or more.. where can we get them.... little help plzzz
,Sarracenia,2011-03-18T16:40Z,"So, apparently there are no seeds, could you get these up again by any chance soagg?"
