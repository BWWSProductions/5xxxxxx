Well produced AOR with hi-tech and funk overtones and a brash drum sound, Distance were a natural successor to the Powerstation who featured legendary producer Bernard Edwards and Tony Thompson and replacing Robert Palmer was Robert Hart. Musically this has some great funk rock numbers such as â€˜Give It Upâ€™, neat AOR rock like â€˜Speech Of Angelsâ€™ but it is the ballads that really make this album special. â€˜As You Turn Awayâ€™ with Robert Hartâ€™s impassioned vocal and Eddie Martinezâ€™s stunning guitar solo â€“ superb stuff! The title track again highlights Hartâ€™s emotive vocals with a sexy funk vibe rumbling under the music.
