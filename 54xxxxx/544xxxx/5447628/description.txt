--------------------------------Hello!--------------------------------------------

I'm Frezzno, a Phantasy Star addict!

Achivments:
Played Phantasy star on SMS.
Completed Phantasy star 2 on SegaMD. Still have the original cluebook by SEGA.
Played Phantasy Star 3 and 4 om SegaMD.
Played PS0 Xbox.
Played PS Portable on PSP hooked with my two kids and theirs PSP.
Played PSU Xbox360. Still have my guardian licence.
Played PS-Zero on DSi.
Started PSO server for PC.

And now...

Closed PSO server in exchange for PSOBB server... For the 2nd time. I got a little
more experienced.


-------------------------------FEATURES-------------------------------------------

Why PSOBB (Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst) when there're alot better versions or
even better mmorpgs? Well...

1. It's free of charge! SEGA abandoned this project long time ago.
2. It's small and not too old game so it will work on everybodys PC or even
   notebooks and various OS. You can even turn on max anti-alias of your gfx card
   for it to be gorgeous and still have alot of fps.
3. Superb grafix that matches many of the newer games of today.
4. Cross platform with GC and DC. Not sure if it works on my server thou.
5. Simple and easy UI and HUD. Easy to learn gameplay. Even a 5y old kid can
   understand it. I shit you not. My 5y old daughter is playing with me.
6. Addictive gameplay because of the various quests and stuff that can be played
   both multiplayer and solo. Different quests solo and multi player.
7. It's a Japan kind of action relationship game. The more and different player
   that plays, the better the loot.
8. Lots of different enviroment to explore.
9. I got lucky enough to get the server workin despite my poor programing skills.
10.Accounts will never be deleted because of idleness.
11.Also... My server is set to give 10x exp gain from kills! You will be able to
   reach ultimate in no time.


-------------------------------FILE INFO------------------------------------------

PSOBB-Frez_v2.rar		-> Client for PSOBB revised with better gfx.
Readme_Frezzno.txt		-> This text documant.
PSOBB-Frez_server_exex.rar	-> You only have to download this if you already
				   have PSOBB client installed.

Server files are from http://www.pioneer2.net . Easy to setup, even a crazy guys
like me managed right, so cudos to them.

Client that you will download are mainly from pioneer2. It has been modyfied with
extra graphics from various sources. I don't know exactly from where. I'm only
rappy I got it workin. Cudos to www.schtserv.com anyways.

Virus and trojan free guaranteed. Don't believe me? Go in to the forums of the
site I just gave cudos to. Seems like some SEGA crew have reported them as virus
and trojans. It will wear off eventually.


------------------------------INSTALLATION----------------------------------------

1. Send a mail to "psobb.frezzno@comhem.se" with your desired account name and
   password. With no symbols, only a-z and 0-9. Optional email you like your
   account to be registered to, otherwise I'll use the mail you sent it from.
   Allow like 5-10 min after I got your mail for your account to be activated.
   Do this as soon as you can so you will be able to play.

   Sorry to say that I work m-f 7.00-16.00 GMT+1. Registraition within that time
   will be activated afterwards.

2. Unpack "PSOBB-Frez.rar" to your desired place in your PC.

3. Run "install.reg" once.

4. Run "online.exe" and set your options. Vista and Win 7, run "vonlin.exe".

5. When done press "Start game".

6. Welcome to my ship.


OPTIONAL OPTIONS

After you have run options with all the patches downloaded and your options are set you can run "psobb.exe" to enter the game without the
loader. Vista and Win7 run "vista.exe".

VISTA and WIN7

Might have typing issues. If so... Go to national, region and language settings
in controlpanel of your OS. In the language tab unselect all "Supplemantal
langage support".

If it still doesn't work!

Try install jap keyboard language. Assign shortcut keys so that you can switch
languages in game. Then it should work.

If it still doesn't work!

visit www.schtserv.com or www.pioneer2.net and look for answers in their forums.


-------------------------------FINAL STUFF----------------------------------------

Some of the ingame graphics and UI have been changed for some better ones,
acording to me anyways. But feel free to change some if you like. All stuff have
been taken from www.schtserv.com forum.

I don't know how to program and stuff so this server is running in pretty much
default settings. Only exp boost was applied. I can imagine that many of the
quests are buggy and many of them cant be executed at all. So...
Please give some server tips and trix so that my server will run better. Also
don't hesite to email about other PSO related stuff. Why not comment something.

email: psobb.frezzno@comhem.se

Also I would like to keep my server clean and deasent. Try not to cheat or stuff
like that. The gameplay isn't that hard, my doughter managed. Plus you get an
extra 10x exp gain per kill. You'll reach higher levels quicker and be able to
pick on harder and more fun difficulties sooner, without insane grinding as it
was ment to be played.

Remember that cheating is only good if it goes unnoticed. Because other don't
tolerate cheats I will probably have to ban the cheating account.

Good luck!

UPDATE

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2010-05-17 Teamspeak3 service added for all the members.

2010-04-30 Palinurus summer
Added hi res graphics to forest. Added ep4 summer feels. New ep1 event quest, only temporary.

2010-04-23 Palinurus Cherry Blossom Weekend!
A celebration to Swedish Cherry Blossom at the Royal Gardens.

2010-04-22 More multiplayer quests tuned with better meseta rewards.
Except for the event quests and EP4. Will continue to fix that later.

2010-04-20 All episodes solo/side quests and TTF boosted meseta rewards!
You level ridiculously fast at this server and your wallet can't keep it up. So to fix that I've increased the meseta rewards for all solo/side quests. That should make them more desirable to do, since you can only do these quests once per difficulty. It's the least I can do for you, that's within my wanabe programmer skills. Also as a bonus, this applys to TTF too since many of you seems to like this quest. More changes to come later on.


2010-04-19

Hello again!

The last weeks competition went quite well. We got a new and better shipname. I got the chance to deliver the reward to the winner, took 2 days but it got delivered. Also another screw up from my part; totally forgot to deliver extra mesetas to some of those who participated. Please give me a chance here, itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t have mesetas (cough) itâ€™s because we are online at different times. So a small message to those who I still owe some mesetas; you will get them.

Now to something differentâ€¦

Iâ€™ve just noticed that the welcome message at the login screen is quite limited. I constantly update or have something important (cough) to announce so the older stuff will quickly disappear at the bottom. (Yes Iâ€™ve tried page and arrow down, hello?) So I need new ways to reach you good people of PSO. So from now on the welcome message will be short and brief.

And while I think of new ways, here are some important updates so far:

â€¢	New bank feature. Type /bank to switch between them.
â€¢	Altered the exe files to show English stuff. Please run online.exe alternately vonlin.exe at least once for it to update to new exe. (Otherwise youâ€™ll loop at the update page.) After that youâ€™re free to run psobb.exe or vista.exe directly.
â€¢	Added some new quests.
â€¢	Some of the quests have been translated or at least partly translated.
â€¢	Messed up with some textures, please take a look at â€œ_Original_u_dragon.txtâ€ in your game folder.
â€¢	Added a small turn off music bat file, please take a look at â€œ_Perfect_silence.txtâ€ in your game folder.
â€¢	Added more stuff to the game folder like keyboard layout picture.

Wellâ€¦ Thatâ€™s all for now phew. Much shorter than the last one huh.

C U online.

(Update from around Easter.)

Hello!

Just wanna give you some new infos about my PSOBB server and some tips and trix.

First letâ€™s give a lot of cudos to Sodaboy (PSOBB server programmer) at pioneer2.net for the latest server update. In this update you now have a common bank which can be reached by all characters in your account.  Just type â€œ/bankâ€ to switch between the banks before you speak to your bank manager. With the common bank youâ€™ll get 200 extra slots to put items in. Might not sound much but think of how easy it is now to trade items to your other characters, or using it properly you can trade items with other players with ease.

Once again, cudos to the mighty Sodaboy at pioneer2.net .

Now some quick update info on my server so far:

â€¢	Increased rare spawns because of low population. Weâ€™re still too few to be able to buy stuff from other lucky players. Why not be lucky yourself.
â€¢	10 times easier to find extra mags in those wild boxes. Sorry to say that the chances are still slim.
â€¢	PLUS 10x exp gain from killing stuff. This Iâ€™ll keep for a long time. Hate to grind, but I see a downside to thisâ€¦ butâ€¦
â€¢	Added  a new quest â€œPhoton exchangeâ€. Itâ€™s a quest for low populated servers. You can trade in items for Photon Drops then PD for greater items. This quest can be found in EP2 shop quest. Read all about it here.

2010-04-08
Darn! Just noticed that I lost all the guild cards I've collected and team informations. Think this applys to all of you. Must be somting with the update. Hope it doesn't mather much.
Also added NEW file "PSOBB-Difficulty_levels.txt" to your game folder. Please check it out. If something's wrong then tell me.

2010-03-31
â€¢	New bank feature, cudos to Sodaboy at pioneer2.net .
â€¢	Files added to data folder, 2 simple batch files. I screwed up with the graphics for ultimate dragon. Execute "_1-Original_ult_dragon.bat" in your data folder to restore the original graphics which contains nice icy environment with beautiful snowy mountains. But if you like the outer space volcanic one I included from the beginning then forget this. More details about this can be read in "_Original_u_dragon.txt" file in your main PSOBB folder.
â€¢	File added to dataogg folder; "_Perfect_silence.bat". It's a mute music batch file made by Erin of schserv/forum. You can read all about it in "_Perfect_silence.txt" in the main game folder, or at this link where it originally came from. Remember to have all sound on in options for this to take full effect.

2010-03-27
I couldn't pull off 100% weapons and armor drop which I promised and in this failed desperation I started the current 100% rare monster spawn. You just need to search for their spawn places.

2010-03-22
â€¢	Raised the chances of finding rare monsters by lots of times.
â€¢	Also changed so that mesetas and tools stuff drops more frequent.

2010-03-21
â€¢	Changed in the exe files to show "E"lvl instead of "J"lvl after the names and "Eng" instead of "Jpn" in your guildcard.
â€¢	Added keyboard layout picture and lobby actions and emotes key shortcuts list. Look in your game folder.
â€¢	Added a tiny file to data folder that adds some nice table lamps in lobby 12.

2010-03-20
Updated and more stable client with better gfx on many of the characters, forest sky, lobby 1-10 outside view, EP1 city high res textures plus more. New UI that's more like PSO with better icons. 

2010-03-19
Total server and client revision and testing.

22010-03-15
Server start up andâ€¦ Failed! Only me and all connected to my local network could play. But I didnâ€™t know that. Thought that PSOBB was dead because nobody else logged in.


Tips and trix

Running the game:
â€¢	You probably already know this but you only need to run psobb.exe or vista.exe once the reg file have been executed, your options are set and after 2010-03-21 update. This will speed up things a little. 
â€¢	Donâ€™t know why but fullscreen have failed since original PSO. The game shuts down when alt-tab out of it. Be sure to set your option to windowed, you can still resize.
â€¢	Advanced effects in graphics advanced setup only looks good for ATI cards. Works poorly and only partly on other cards. So you might as well turn it off if you donâ€™t have ATI.

In game:
â€¢	You can browse the various nametag infos in the lobby by pressing the TAB key.
â€¢	Check whoâ€™s in the group before joining by pressing TAB, press it again to see what quest theyâ€™re on. On the pad press left action palette button.
â€¢	Express your feelings with your symbol chat. Press END then TAB or top action palette button then left palette button.
â€¢	Make a point in the Info Board (Options/Chat). Everyone in the party or same lobby can read it.
â€¢	WTH! Is there only quests in forest? Hehe, playing solo but canâ€™t unlock more than forest quests? You need to do the Principals quests first. This can be done in multiplayers too, but you only unlock quests for each difficulty separately. (Took me a while to figure out, Iâ€™m used to PSO.)
â€¢	Need a quick exit from the game, or change character? Press ALT+BACKSPACE and youâ€™ll come to title screen, press ALT+BACKSPACE again for a quick exit to windows.

OKâ€¦ Wanna be epic and have the best gear? Well you canâ€™t do it alone. Me and Amy (42000017) had a little test and it turns out that drop charts goes after the party leader and not after the one with the killing blow. Be sure to check pso-world (Episode 1,2 & 4) for your section ID drop chart thenâ€¦ Choose the leader wisely, especially this weekend when youâ€™re guaranteed a rare monster drop.

You also have various downloads there like magfeed timer, magfarm and section ID calculator. With magfarm you can simulate a feeding to see how your mag will turn out, so you know exactly how to feed it in the game.
