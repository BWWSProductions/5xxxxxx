The version include in this torrent is 1.07.0 (the actual one April 2011 is v1.10.2).
So I download the installer for v.1.10.2 but the keygens and patchers included for that version doesn't work for my Win7 64bit. SO After installed v.1.10.2 I replace the ""SRSSSC.exe"" include it in this torrent and voila
I have the Control panel v1.7.0 working with the drivers of v.1.10.2.
By the way, it is hard to find what is the correct settings to make works your speaker but I can guarantee that this method work 100%
