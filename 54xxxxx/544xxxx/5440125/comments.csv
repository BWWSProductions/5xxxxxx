,Eskimio,2010-03-18T06:59Z,"I finally and completely set up the torrents on both my laptop and my desktop as well as sending the torrent link to several of my friends for them to seed. I hope this torrent has 100% uptime henceforth. And all you leechers, SEED FOR ONCE! THIS TORRENT IS WORTH IT!"

,bigoody,2010-05-11T09:14Z,"I think some files are corrupted, For example in ""Moar Ghosts N Stuff"" in ""For Lack of a Better Name"" album at 00:47 and 3:49...

I'd downloaded hole torrent 2 times but everything was same!"
,_Chambers_,2010-05-15T16:43Z,"dude, insane torrent!"
,SirSMY,2010-05-16T20:35Z,"Great torrent, thnx! I'll keep seeding.

I've got a question though, maybe someone can help me with this. Every time I download a discography and I put these songs in iTunes, I can't change the properties of the songs (title, artist etc.). How do I do this?"
,Stanniejj,2010-05-18T23:49Z,"@SirSMY - That's weird, you should try opening it in Winamp (www.winamp.com) then rightclick the tracks in winamp and press Alt+3 (3 not on your numpad) and you should be able to edit the tag and also the ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags. Hope it works.

@Eskimio - Great torrent, I really appreciate people seeding and having contact with the leechers!"
,Stanniejj,2010-05-18T23:53Z,"@Eskimio - By the way: I love people who take care of upper and lowercase lettering. I always edit the tags when they aren't with upper and lowercases too... I'd like to have my playlist clean! :) Oh, and I have a question: Are all the tracks of full length?"
,BloodPhoenix,2010-06-02T05:04Z,"Great quality, thanks for the upload! =)"

,weaselgo,2010-10-28T07:38Z,"Moar Ghosts N Stuff has a flaw in it.
Also, the ""high quality"" varies. They seem to be all MP3s, but at different bitrates."

,axero,2011-02-13T14:18Z,"For Lack Of A Better Name is not ripped properly. It's not just moar ghosts, there's skips and artifacts in a few tunes on it.

Other than that, everything else is fine i think."
,Eskimio,2011-03-14T04:22Z,"Hey guys! Thanks for all the positive reviews, I really appreciate it. I'm so happy to see this torrent is still going strong after all this time.

Also, any and all problems with the tracks themselves were unbeknownst to me. I used to listen to all these tracks all the time on my own before I actually compiled them into a torrent, and I never had any issues with them. If you DO have any problems, all the albums I have came straight from thepiratebay in the first place so you can easily download whatever is damaged/missing. My apologies for any issues anyone might have had."
