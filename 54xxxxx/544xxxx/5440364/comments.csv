Give give the image file, I don't know what you think your doing besides wasting our time extracting it and briefly requiring double the hard drive space until you delete the .RAR's

,Pwny,2010-04-12T09:06Z,"2 Things:

Number ONE: Your idiots.
Number TWO: This game fucking rules.

9/10 Stars from me.

Why didnt it do well?

Reviewers will tell you two things, one being that it was released on the SAME day as Final Fantasy XIII. That of course is shit and matters nothing to a good game.

Number two being that the combat has no evolution....
You want evolution? Final Fantasy XIII Has no real evolution either!! Its a fucking stupid thing to say! 

This game is worth it! I LOVE IT!"
,tehbobin,2010-05-07T21:53Z,"Can any one help.

,anson7712,2010-06-15T04:43Z,"can someone please help how you burn this?
It doesn't have an .ISO file which i need help with for burning.You help would be much appreciated!"
,animecrazy,2010-07-19T17:42Z,someone PLEASE SEED........
,animecrazy,2010-07-19T19:29Z,one question..... how do i burn it????
,ZhenLuo,2010-09-16T22:01Z,"First, double-click the .rar file, it takes a while to create the .dvd and the ISO file, so be patient. Next, run with AGBx then burn with Image burn, or any equivalent program. You must make sure that both the Dual Layer disks and the Burner are of high quality, this is an Xbox 360 game so try and splurge on good Verbatims.

Pwny:

Number ONE: I love this game. Leanne is adorbs.
Number TWO: I love your name, your my new best friend."
