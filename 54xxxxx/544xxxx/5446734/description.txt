In 2007 the legendary American duo White Stripes toured Canada. Besides playing the usual venues they challenged themselves and played in buses, cafÃ©s and for Indian tribal elders. Music video director Emmett Malloy followed the band and managed to capture both the special tour, extraordinary concert versions of the bandâ€™s minimalist, raw, blues-inspired rock songs and the special relationship between the extroverted Jack White and the introspective Meg White â€“ a formerly married couple who for a long time claimed to be siblings. The film makes striking use of the bandâ€™s concert colors: red, white and black.
