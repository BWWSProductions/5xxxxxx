,chuckmamuck,2010-03-19T00:09Z,"to fire missles when shooting down migs the deafault keys are ""shift + D"" (the drop object/flour bomb key) it dont state it in the manual. it can be changed to a joystick button in the controls option in FSX."
,Mogz,2010-03-19T01:34Z,"Thanks Chuck. I'm not a huge fan of Abacus add-ons but i'll give this one a try.


BTW is N537JB around still, I heard he was looking for me ;) "
,chuckmamuck,2010-03-19T02:30Z,"no worries mogz. i know what you mean about abacus, im not much of a fan of their planes but extra missions are always good. the aircraft look good from the outside and fly quite nicely but as usual with abacus it looks like they ran out of time on the cockpits. its a fun add-on and a change from the usual comercial flying with FSX.
its worth the dl, ive been having fun crashing into the back of carriers all night

i aint seen N537JB's name around the bay for ages, thats twice you've asked tho, whats he looking for you for? he's probably incognito  ;) 
theres quite a few of the old names not around anymore."

,Mogz,2010-03-20T01:14Z,I was reading a comment in a torrent thats ages old that he was wondering were I was. Actully was gunna tell him he needed to chill out a bit.
,chuckmamuck,2010-03-20T02:52Z,"Ahh i see. yeah theres plenty of aggro and comment rage going on, flight simmers are pretty chilled in comparison to most other torrents on here, apart from the porn community, they're all civilised and big seeders ;]
alot of the old names and big uploaders dont seem to be around much now, theres a lack of new products tho. we need a new flight sim, developed for todays hardware and OS's."
,SKVA1,2010-05-19T22:53Z,"Hi Guys,
I one of a few who likes Abacus Products,
Has anyone got this Torrents but For FS2004?
As that is the Sim i mainly Use,

Thank you in Advance
Alex"
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-20T15:57Z,"SKVA1
i think this is for fs2004 and fsx, if you click on the abacus link it says for both.
you usually select which 1 on install so im sure it is for fs2004 also."
