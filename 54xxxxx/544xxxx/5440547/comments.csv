The old BitComet crap you are using is obsolete."

,cc600,2010-10-27T17:20Z,"I have uTorrent (latest version) and it has ""padding"" files that says if you see this, you need bitcomet.

Only 4/20 songs are actually able to be downloaded."
,SammoSammy,2011-09-06T14:06Z,"20% of the actual songs, and using an outdated client. 

Bravo on your pathetic torrent! "
