,The-Blob,2010-05-03T03:39Z,"Oh man, this is GREAT! Installed flawlessly, serial worked. A quick note for others downloading this: install it first without entering a serial. Run the program and in the options deselect the ""Automatically check for updates"" box, and then enter your serial. GREAT TORRENT, KEEP IT UP DUDE!"

,charles338,2010-09-20T15:18Z,Thank you for the upload!!!
,kiwiboi82,2010-10-02T06:10Z,I wanna download this but the tracker is down :(
,MICR0S0FT,2011-02-22T00:33Z,"Installed and then I got the ""this is an illegal copy and legal action can now be taken against you""...

Ok, I downloaded torrents before had internet connection turned OFF and also had it turned ON...

I had it turned off when I was installing this, but then it said that installation can not complete because it needs access to the internet, so I turned it back on.. finished installing, and then got the message above.

I think more info needs to be in the READ ME file instead of you ""greeting"" everyone. I don't see how people have this program working correctly, unless ""Audials"" recently found a way to track illegal copies and throw out this notice."

I would like to retract my above post.
Sorry about that Murlok
