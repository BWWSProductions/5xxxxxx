,afgaviria,2010-03-22T05:57Z,"@thenoobish, can i ask you where do you get the games? from ""rapid*hare"" sites? or your collection is huge? I ask you this cuz i found the getaway 2 (eng-spa and NTSC) but it is in 16 RAR files and strangely i cant download big files in firefox -some driver issue- so let me know if you can do something with it."
[T],thenoobish,2010-03-22T16:58Z,"aneesh: couldnt find indigo prophecy but Siren is already uploaded by me.

afgaviria: i download the torrent files from other trackers, most of them foreign.. about the getaway and its part files. there is a program called Jdownloader that will download the rars for you. If you find the game and if its working plz upload here ! :D because its so slow to download from for example sites like rapid"
,afgaviria,2010-03-23T00:41Z,"ok, i will try it. first i got to deal with my problem with my LAN driver.
