,bibbisbibbis,2010-04-02T16:16Z,"Fuck you rizzon.
Why do people continue to complain?
This was intended to be a kind of ""New"" Scrubs so why the fuck does everybody insist on comparing it with the old Scrubs?
So many actors wanted to quit and do other things that they had no choise but to cancle the original show.

It's people like rizzon who we eventually killed the new scrubs.
Thank you so much for that you pathetic little ³!!1¶é?$@"
