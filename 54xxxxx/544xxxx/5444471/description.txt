     SUMMARY:
              Dozens of ships and planes have vanished without a
              trace in the area of the Atlantic Ocean known as the
              Bermuda Triangle. But where do they go and what is
              causing them to disappear? We take to the skies and
              seas to test the theories that could explain the
              Triangles sinister reputation. We dive with a husband
              and wife detective team intent on unlocking the
              mystery of the Triangle and find ourselves on the
              trail of what could be an amazing underwater
              discovery.
