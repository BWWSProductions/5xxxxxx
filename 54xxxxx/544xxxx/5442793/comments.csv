,Daffy_Duck,2010-03-19T17:06Z,"Please don't ask. Be content that somebody always posts them here.
I don't think Jeppesen would be overjoyed if we published the method here; they might even change it ..."

,jsnscrape,2010-03-20T19:06Z,"I have a Garmin 396 portable, can I use this to update the jeppesen nava data? Kinda lost of what this is? Is it for Jeppview only?"
,Daffy_Duck,2010-03-20T21:11Z,"@jsnscrape:
Nope. It is for JeppView/Flightdeck only.

You might search the net for a program suite called AviaDBM (costs about 75$ and worth every penny IMHO) that takes your new database file (which you can download in encrypted form at the Garmin website), decrypts it and sends it to your handheld Garmin GPS (and much more). I use it to keep my old GPS90 (for which Garmin doesn't do updates any more because if its small memory) up to date with a shrinked database."
,k2503,2010-03-21T12:32Z,Thanks for the torrent i appreciate it
,Jetpirate,2010-03-22T14:36Z,Thanks very much. I;m using it a lot inflight.
,virkel,2010-03-22T16:33Z,"Cheers Rod, I don't know what I'd do without these updates. Absolutely no way I could afford to pay for a subscription from Jeppesen."
,asxavier,2010-03-23T03:50Z,"Thank you!!!!
I'll seed as long as I can.

Good Job, by the way."
,jsnscrape,2010-03-23T10:26Z,"@Daffy

Thanks a ton for the heads up on the program. Used it the other day and installed all the updates to my handheld. I think I might get the new Aera once the get the AviaDBM working for those. "
,Daffy_Duck,2010-03-23T21:38Z,"@jsnscrape:
Glad to be of service.

AviaDBM is great for the handhelds, but sadly, it doesn't work with my GNS430, so I still have to buy updates for that ...

Anyone any ideas?"
,gesander,2010-03-24T16:34Z,"can anybody help me!

after install it starts the activation wizard and de site key R00D-KCAB doesnt work."
,Daffy_Duck,2010-03-25T16:55Z,"@gesander:
The key doesn't work with newer versions. 
You have to download cycle 0901 or earlier (take this
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4717891/FS2004_FSX_-_Jeppview_3___Airac_0901
for example, install and activate it, and then use the new cycle to upgrade. 
Don't forget to uninstall the new version first!"
,avianouar,2010-03-26T14:02Z,"Thx alot.
Please does somebody here can tell me where I can find the torrent for the Oxford ATPL Airframes & Systems CBT, I'm looking for it for a couple of months !"
,gesander,2010-03-26T21:20Z,"@Daffy_Duck:
Great Thanks - it works wonderful !!!"
,TheTraveller15,2010-04-01T10:13Z,"Is cycle 1007 already available, should it be active from today on?"
,jsnscrape,2011-05-22T21:24Z,"@Daffy_Duck
