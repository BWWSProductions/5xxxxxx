A crooked cop, a mob boss and the young girl they abuse are
the denizens of a city's criminal underworld. It's a world
that ordinary Arthur Poppington doesn't understand and
doesn't belong in, but is committed to fighting when he
changes into a vigilante super-hero of his own making,
Defendor. With no power other than courage Defendor takes to
the streets to protect the city's innocents.
