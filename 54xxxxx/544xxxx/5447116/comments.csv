,iconfig,2010-03-25T04:46Z,"Again people do not understand video codecs and compression... 

this movie will extract to 698 mb, 5mb smaller than the rars.

the reason why ? 
the video is already compressed, hence the team video compression. raring it just adds to the overall filesize because it needs to add rar headers even if the data cant be compressed anymore. "
