,baretoof,2010-03-18T07:44Z,could you upload Two Tower also? thanks.
,Jinola,2010-03-18T09:49Z,"Whey, thanks very much!
Was looking for this yesterday, didn't expect it up so early - USA and UK release = 6th April '10"
,oamyoh,2010-03-18T11:34Z,Are these recently uploaded lotr-movies extended editions or theatrical cuts?
[V],-jonny-,2010-03-18T12:26Z,"If they were extended they would have the ""extended"" label. The extended cuts won't be available for quite some time."
[V],-jonny-,2010-03-18T18:18Z,Very sharp - great quality.
,pipopik,2010-03-18T20:43Z,"Thank you for the upload.
Compared to the known ""1080p"" EE rips that have been around for a few years , these do look better, but not like its a very big difference, though its nice:)
I think for a real boost in quality I will wait downloading part 2 and 3 until the real 1080p bluray rips are around.
So for all of you who -like me- want best possible quality on our nifty HD monitors and tv's, wait for the 1080p. Bet they will be a 20 gb download though:) arghhh
Too bad they chose to release the EE seperately.. and later:( "
,shanikh,2010-03-19T00:56Z,"O I have been waiting for this one from a very long time, but I guess I'll have to wait a little bit more because I really want to download the Extended Edition, sad they haven't released those yet. But Aoloffline thank you for the effort, these do seem like good rips ....."
,pipopik,2010-03-19T01:15Z,"For if you want to compare the older 1080p rip to this 720p rip I made a screenshot  to compare.
Especially in the darker areas (look at the tree) there is more detail. Crispier , and less ghosting overall.

Indeed 2 bad the EE's aren't released.
Good rips tho."
,moshster,2010-03-19T01:35Z,"@pipopik - In the comparison, the 1080 HDTVrip looks better to me."
,moshster,2010-03-19T01:36Z,"It's not because they want to take more money (well, they do I guess) but it's because the EEs will be enhanced further to tie in with the two Hobbit movies."
,pipopik,2010-03-19T02:24Z,"@moshster: Its a matter of taste I guess which one looks better, as I said in an earlier post , it's not a huge difference.
But really this bluray rip is sharper then the hdtv,
only marginal."
,pipopik,2010-03-19T02:37Z,"@aoloffline. Thanks for pointing out the 1080p availability. I am downloading the fellowship 1080p bluray from ab.boneless newsgroup right now :) 3 and a half hour to go....
Ah well I can check it tomorrow.
And yes...its time for another harddisk here aswell lol."
,gustavosd,2010-03-19T22:46Z,@aoloffline how did you get this HD movie so early? '-'
[T],zeromancer,2010-03-22T03:15Z,"Oh Oh.

This is great. Hopefully a 1080p version out soon also.

Thanks for the up."
,NotLimit,2010-03-28T09:07Z,"Great release!

,Beverx3,2010-03-28T17:34Z,Why MKV ?
,biz11,2010-04-05T20:12Z,Are these from the bluray versions being 'officially' released April 6?
,biz11,2010-04-06T21:00Z,"Just finished downloading this, fantastic quality.  Thank you!!!"
,justin131,2010-04-10T06:30Z,Are the forced subtitles from the elf scenes etc hardcoded?
,justin131,2010-04-10T07:45Z,"Ok, I've confirmed it. The forced subs (for the elvish etc scenes) are hardcoded in english.

Just for information sake."
,akka288,2010-04-11T03:48Z,sedddddddddddddd guys.

,retardoface,2010-07-01T19:08Z,is WAF's 1080p version legit?
,retardoface,2010-07-05T00:10Z,"good quality buat why do the titled shake at the begining, is it because its compressed, i cant see why compression is good makes the quality shit"
,finitio,2010-07-21T16:30Z,"Seriously, if you are a fan of the movies and want to watch it again just download this. The quality is astonishing, the same counts for the other LOTR movies in bluray."
,Aciaeiig,2010-09-16T20:41Z,Waiting for the extended version to come out in blu-ray then im gonna collect! :)
