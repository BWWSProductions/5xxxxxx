,eyadoum,2010-03-17T23:57Z,i think this might be fake.i am almost sure it's fake by the way what is russian dubbed means?
,jumpingphil,2010-03-18T01:24Z,"Spoken language(s):Russian

There is a huge clue there folks.
It is not a fake.
It is the real deal, it has just been dubbed into Russian so that Russians can understand it.
If you can't understand Russian then don't download this 'cos there isn't any English on it.
It is quite correctly labelled as ""Black Hole Episode 16"" 'cos that is what Fox label it as on their web site. ANd they should know.
Still 751 seeders and 228 leechers, there are a lot of Russian speakers out there.
Enjoy."

,supersizeme,2010-03-24T21:12Z,"Is anyone else as frustrated as I am with House and the ""is there an episode this week, isn't there?"" scenario.  Its almost as though they are writing it as they go.  Mus'nt grumble though its all free.  perhaps next week for the new episode eh... "
,Mad_Duke,2010-03-29T06:14Z,"FYI

Both labelling of this episode as s06e15 or in this case s06e16 is correct.   The difference is how certain networks treated the first 2 episodes. somewhere they showed them as 1 90 minute episode and somewhere as 2 45 minute ones.  "
,Talonade,2010-03-30T22:11Z,"Yes very annoying not airing every week, how come Russia get it before the States, or anywhere else, bizarre.

Peace"
,jumpingphil,2010-04-07T05:14Z,"@Orik1990   Sorry, I should have said ""There isn't any useful English on there"" because I can't imagine anyone sitting through an entire episode struggling to hear the English soundtrack.

@Talonade   Russia don't get this before anybody else.
This episode is called ""Black Hole"". It is numbered 16 as that is what Fox has numbered it.
Other people on here have this same episode numbered as 15 'cos that is what has been decided by someone else.
They are all the same episode."
