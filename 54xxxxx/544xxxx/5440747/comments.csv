Be careful, apparently HBO is hating...

,Thxango40,2010-03-24T01:35Z,WARNING: My ISP shut me off after downloading this torrent! No kidding.
,rarcatz,2010-03-24T07:33Z,"it's showtime, not hbo.  but apparently doesn't matter, they are hating anyway!

anyone know of a free bt blocker?"
,ghost139,2010-04-09T18:21Z,"Yep, i got warned by my ISP, i think its just that the video had not been aired yet, which is why they are angry, since that means we would not have watched it on ""TV"" (not that i ever do) i suggest that even if there are screeners, you wait untilit airs, that way instead of breaking the law, we are in the ""grey areas"" (canada anyways)"
,rebelBodhi,2010-05-31T06:49Z,"great quality, thanks for the up!  using PeerBlock, and crossing fingers :p"
