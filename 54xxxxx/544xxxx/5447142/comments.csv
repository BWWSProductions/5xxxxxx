I uninstalled it and did like you said' this time Im not asked for key.   it says trial is finished' but  still has trial on top. also everytime you open it' it asked you to reg it.but the main problem I have now is thire is no sound on avi files. it plays music ok. also i cant get wide screen. am going back to v8 for the moment. its a good program. 
[V],Anacondaz,2010-03-21T01:39Z,"THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD IT WORKS WELL ON MY WINDOWS 7 X32 BIT
KEEP UP UR GUD WORK"
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-03-21T04:57Z,parasites . YOU NEED TO CLEAN ANY PREVIOUS  INSTALLATION ON YOUR PC WITH CC CRAP CLEANER . THEN CLEAN YOUR REGISTRY. THEN DO CLEAN INSTALLATION.AFTER THE INSTALLATION PLEASE RESET IT TO YOUR OWN TASTE. EITHER WIDE SCREEN OR NORMAL FULL SCREEN. ONLY YOU COMPLAINING. MY INSTALLATION IS FULL VERSION.
,Ganddi,2010-03-21T06:19Z,"@parasites  There is no reg.finish file like  aprilfool786 said copy and paste CLAud.sim and PowerDVD10.sim on  C:/Program Files/CyberLink
 lastly whether you have 64bit or 32bit you are gonna double click 64.Reg or Reg 32 bit.Reg just one not both of them. THERE IS NO REG.Finish file mate. Cheers."
,msmmpts,2010-03-21T12:37Z,Fantastic torrent.it worked flawlessly.
,autotran,2010-03-21T16:05Z,"I just finish installing and it worked flawlessly with Windows7 64bit.
I copied both CLAud.sim and PowerDVD10.sim into cyberlink folder in E: drive (where I had installed Cyberlink) and then double clicked 64.REG
Seems to be working fine, if I find any problems I will repost."
,parasites,2010-03-21T16:17Z,Thanks BLACKTROY. Did what you said and it worked. But still no sound. convert avi to dvd and sound  OK' But no sound when I play avi. Otherwise a Great Player.
,autotran,2010-03-21T16:18Z,"parasites
When you copy the files CLAud.sim and PowerDVD10.sim into the correct Cyberlink directory it will ask if you want to overwrite the old files, which you do. If it doesn't ask, then you are not copying them into the correct directory. "
,parasites,2010-03-21T20:02Z,Thanks for your help autotran. As you can see everything is OK apart from sound on avi files.
,ravireddy,2010-03-22T10:05Z,"Hey guys... is there any thing to be done after installing the S/W to activate sound... I was able to successfully install the player, but, am not able to get sound for any video play back"
,sgriff59,2010-03-23T03:43Z,"Great program...worked as desribed. ALl you need to do is follow instructions. 
Anyone have the patch to the Ultra for 3D yet?"
,rampage1001,2010-03-25T04:49Z,"It deleted some of my driver!!!
TV tuner don't work any more.
Fucked up my laptop too. Keybord and touch pad are gone."
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-03-25T09:59Z,rampage1001 ve a look at people who install this software without any complain. how come you are the person complaining. i doubt if you downloaded that torrent from here
,rhsjr7,2010-03-25T14:32Z,"I can vouch for this being a fully working, no funny business torrent. I believe that rampage1001's issue is merely coincidental, and that he jumped to a conclusion as to the events that took place. I work on machines for folks, you wouldn't believe the blame they place on all the wrong things, It's always some game or program that told them they needed to disable their anti-virus program to install. Great find 'BlackTroy' :)"
,LinneMeKniven,2010-03-25T17:47Z,"Is this the ultra 3D version?,  or is it deluxe or the regular?;)"
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-03-25T22:05Z,LinneMeKniven -- this is ultra 3d version
,rampage1001,2010-03-26T01:21Z,"As soon as this program installed, the tv tuner stopped working.
Had to do a system restore to fix it.
The drivers were deleted as soon as the REG file was activated.
Same with the laptop keyboard and touch pad"
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-03-26T05:22Z,rampage1001 . mr man.  why don't you uninstall this software and download trlal from cyberlink-web site. to see. who is right and wrong.
,darmax96,2010-03-26T05:49Z,Rock On BLACKTROY :) Working Great. Thanks
,cat1952,2010-03-26T13:21Z,"Thanks, works great.  I think what throws newbies is that the instructions don't specify copying the REG file along with the other two files; and the folder is the PowerDVD10 folder, not Cyberlink."
,PeckerWoodHD,2010-03-26T13:49Z,"PowerDVD 10.0.1515 is the latest version and it's 122.71MB.

So I'm wondering why is this ''Ultra 3D Version'' 7mb less?"
,johnstar,2010-03-27T00:05Z,"thanx blacktroy 10/10

i cant see how ppl are going wrong, 100% perfect."
,xMOXIEx,2010-03-27T21:29Z,"I've in installed this version several times, including the trial version from the oem. Running Win 7 x64 ultra and I keep having the same problem. Runs fine except I don't get any text in any of the menu's just blank on all the configuration tabs, pop up menus, browse menus etc. Any ideas anybody. Also this is a clean legit download. Thanks man! "
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-03-28T08:51Z,"xMOXIEx . looking at your statement. it seem you ve mess up your pc with your previous installation. ok let set the record straight. first uninstalled cyberlink power dv from your pc. then. clean your pc cccleaner from this site.
www.ccleaner.com. make sure you delet any file relating to cyberlink on your c-- drive. and make clean installation. let me know if this work for you."
,Thescot,2010-03-28T11:32Z,I cant get no sound to work
,U_Rebel_Scum,2010-03-29T08:08Z,"Works great.  Nice to finally hear my 500W Klipsch 5.1 PC audio system rock my computer room on movies now!

,Jixie,2010-03-30T16:28Z,I Can't find the x64reg. Where Is it???
,Jixie,2010-03-31T16:35Z,how do you get the serial?
,xMOXIEx,2010-04-01T03:23Z,BLACKTROY.....thanks for the reply only problem is its a fresh install of Windows 7 Ultra x64 and this was the first piece of software I tried to install. Thinking the problem was what you suggested I reformatted and reinstalled only to get the same results. email me at xmoxiex@sbcglobal.net and I'll send you some screenies if your interested in in looking into this further for me. I've also contacted cyberlink with no response yet. I'm sure its not your upload due to the fact the demo version from the oem did the same thing. Thanks again!!!!!
,huffman24,2010-04-12T02:18Z,This torrent works perfect on Windows 7 64 bit. Very easy to install no problems.
,kickassfood,2010-04-15T01:42Z,When I enter the reg keys for both 32 and 64 bit it says the key has been over used or something like that. Do I need to disconnect from my internet to bypass the activation?
,gfw4lyfe,2010-04-25T11:49Z,"Windows 7 Ultimate x64
downloaded in a minute, installed and watching Avatar in less than 5."
,Bozo45,2010-04-28T11:39Z,"Works great, don't forget to click on the reg file after copying it into the program file or you will be asked for a serial. Thanks for the upload. "
,grift24,2010-05-08T08:26Z,"i'm having the same problem as thescot.

i deleted my previous install, ran ccleaner on my whole pc, then reinstalled, copied the files into the powerdvd10 folder, and then used the 64-bit reg file.

the program activates, but when i'm in regular mode, it's in black and white and there are vertical lines running through the whole picture. when i'm in cinema mode, it's beautiful, but there's no audio. 

i'm running on win 7 64-bit with an i3 core with integrated intel graphics. not sure what the problem is... please help. thanks!"
,ExacatableSevens,2010-05-16T01:41Z,"I'm not sure that integrated graphics is something that you want to use for this horse of a dvd player. It heats up a GTX295 like fucking Crysis with a Blu-Ray playing. But hey, then again I really don't know what it does with onboard shit. Good shit though BLACKTROY..."
,cRn1,2010-05-16T02:18Z,"Installed, copied files into cybelink folder, clicked 64 reg and when i start programm its says TRIAL VERSION. wtf? How to fix that"
,ExacatableSevens,2010-05-16T05:05Z,"By the way grift and thescot, you might want to go into the audio tab and change your speaker output from (8) to (2-channel stereo). Pretty sure that'll fix your sound problem. crN1, make sure to cope cLaudio.sim AND PowerDVD10.sim, THEN double-click 64-reg. If you did'nt do that, then do as BLACKTROY says, and use ccleaner and THEN re-install doing exactly what is written there. AND DON'T START THE PROGRAM BEFORE YOU COPY FILES AND ENTER THE REG> SETTINGS> IT WILL WORK!!!!!!"
,soccerref,2010-05-27T21:54Z,"Just as a simple fix for some like me who have WinXP and the reg file does not work.
Go to start--run--regedit--file--import. and point to the folder with the reg32 file in the extracted folder .   that worked when all else failed."
,calpacint,2010-05-30T10:52Z,Thanks
,matthew_rs7,2010-06-04T03:36Z,"My computer came with Power DVD (not sure which Version) but when I upgraded to Windows 7, my copy didn't work and I was forced to buy a new version for it to work.

Then I saw a Blu-Ray drive in a computer store that came with Power DVD, but the guy at the store told me that even if you buy that Optical drive, in order to play most Blu-Rays, you ALSO need to pay for an upgraded version of Power DVD.

Needless to say, Power DVD is Great software but they are being too greedy.

So I got this version. Which by the way, this torrent is great!

Awesome software, small download size and works perfectly on Windows 7 64-bit, just follow the instructions in the ""Activation"" folder and your ready to go.

As a note, when I ran it, it said there was a free patch available, I installed it and it still worked with this torrented copy. Thumbs up for that.

P.S: does that mean that some patches for this program cost money? if so then that is even more greedy of them."
,indamist420,2010-06-06T07:23Z,"Hey, this is my first ever post here. Just wanted to say thanks to blacktroy for this program. It seems to work great except I cannot get sound for some reason. I see others have had the same problem, if any of you have figured out why some of us have no sound could you let me know please? Again, thanks alot for this torrent, It's great."
,indamist420,2010-06-06T07:31Z,"!Sorry for double post!

It is only high def movies that i can't get to play audio, standard avi movies are working perfectly..
