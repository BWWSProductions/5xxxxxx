         Ancient petroglyphs in the Sierra Nevada Mountains depict     
         footprints left by frightening packs of hairy man-like        
         beasts. Now, MonsterQuest heads to the heart of California    
         where witnesses are encountering aggressively territorial     
         packs of Sasquatch. The team will investigate groups of       
         large footprints found here and analyze compelling new        
          video which could be that of the beast.
