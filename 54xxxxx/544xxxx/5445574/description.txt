Instead of just releasing a collection to celebrate their 30th anniversary, Chucho Valdes and a reduced version of the band go back to the studio to remake some of the all classics, while adding a couple of previously unreleased tracks. Any chance to beat the past? Hardly. However, the new version of 'Juana 1600' is a tour de force, and 'Estrella va a estallar' lays the ground for an amazing wind section led by Cesar Lopez, who co-directs this project with Chucho Valdes. The previously unavailable tracks 'Nothing Personal' and 'Chango' justify getting this album. The band still has what it takes but most of the stars have followed their own path and they don't record anymore. All in all an essential album for fans that won't disappoint anyone searching for a taste of afrocuban jazz.
