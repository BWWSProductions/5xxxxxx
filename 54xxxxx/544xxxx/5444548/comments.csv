Pitting two massive intellects like Fry and Hitchens against nincompoops like Anne Widdecombe and John Onaiyekan was like, well, pitting a Catholic priest against a nine-year-old altar boy. So probably it was fair.

Even so, the incisive wit and clear thinking of Fry and Hitchens make it very special. It's so sad that Hitchens is terminally ill: the world needs people like him."

,LazyLynx,2012-02-22T23:12Z,I soooo much appreciate getting anything Hitchens. TPB is where I find Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins etc that I didn't know existed. Thanks very much.
