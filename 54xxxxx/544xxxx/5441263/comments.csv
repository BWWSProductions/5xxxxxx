,Zaepian,2010-05-18T17:22Z,Can someone please SEED this torrent again. This is a MUST HAVE for me. I promise to continue seeding when I'm done DL'ing. (Currently stuck at 75%) 
,Zaepian,2010-05-19T01:08Z,"I just realized that this torrent isn't even 2 months old!! And there's already 0 seeders! Seriously!? SOMEONE PLEASE SEED THIS SO THE 13 PLUS LEECHERS CAN FINISH DL'ING AND CONTINUE TO SEED. I feel better now, thank you. 

I hope chuxDLX comes back soon.... ;( 

...please."

can someone PLEASE SEED for at least 2 days to make sure everyone else who's leeching off of this has a chance to DL. If someone does, I PROMISE I'll seed this torrent for a month!

,NotEnoughTime,2010-08-21T19:01Z,I made an account just for this. I've been stuck at different percents for the past 2 and a half months and now I'm stuck at 80.1. If anyone's got this done...I'm way too close...I'd seed this for years.
,NotEnoughTime,2010-08-21T19:16Z,Cool beans! Someone is actually seeding. Seriously man huge thanks!! I really will keep this going.
,NotEnoughTime,2010-08-28T16:30Z,I got to 80.2 a few days ago and it stopped again.
