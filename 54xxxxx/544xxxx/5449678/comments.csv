,romaniac85,2010-04-28T21:35Z,"@ ALL...

The Rip made here works 100%... I read the Razor1911 post and alot of people are talking about putting quality to LOW! I tried that, cranked up the MSAA 4X plus some other thingy at 16x and I still get fully sick graphics plus no error message or quit to desktop.

Anyway, hope that helps, I'll be seeding for a while.

Enjoy.

Dan  :-D"
