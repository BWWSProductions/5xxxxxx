The enemies that the player will be facing range from human renegades to giant mutated rats. Players will frequently have to defend themselves with makeshift combinations of two weapons put together. Ammunition is scarce and is also used as currency, forcing the player to use their weapons very carefully.

The game is essentially HUD-less, relying on blood spatters to show how much damage was done to the player, and a gas mask must be worn when exploring the surface. There is no on-screen indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail, so players must set a wrist watch, and continue to check it every time they wish to know how long they have. Due to the HUD-less screen players must use a map whenever they need to check their heading, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Dakota Grabowski was also able to sit down with Luis Giglotti who describes the game and how it relates to the book, and also gives descriptions of the "Dark Ones" who are one of the key enemies in the game who attack you psychically. He also talks about the players character being "unique" by being immune to the Dark Ones. The player will also have visions that will give some back story and some of them will be playable.
