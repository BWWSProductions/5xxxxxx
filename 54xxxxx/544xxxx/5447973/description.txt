Not topic today. I just decided to go off on things I saw on sites this week that bothered me or piqued my interest.

Quality's a bit crap cuz I wanna make smaller files so people don't get put off downloading big files.

Richard Dawkins with a decisive slaying of Ron Pauls homeopathy:
Ron Paul has not only sold out 9/11 truthers recently but also over 100 million of his compatriots by trying to condemn them to a life with NO healthcare. All because people don't their wealth distributed. Our economies can't and never have been able to sustain their populations but we are meant to believe immigration is ok and that welfare can be scaled back. BULLSHIT!!!

I defended Alex Jones a few weeks ago and will still defend him on some issues. I just don't understand why he hasn't dissavowed Ron Paul for throwing 9/11 truthers under the bus.

Like I say no real topics this week just a rant so not a lot of links to give ya.
