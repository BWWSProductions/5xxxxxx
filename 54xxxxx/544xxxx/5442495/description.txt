  In early 1970's England, a traditional Pakistani father (Om Puri) finds his
  family spinning in decidedly non-traditional directions. His brood consisting
  of six sons and one daughter all move in independent-minded directions set
  off when the eldest son runs away from home rather than keeping to his fate
  of an arranged marriage. When the next two sons also find out that their
  father has secretly been arranging marriages for them, they rebel and set
  off repercussions that forces the family to totally reconsider their family
  structure.
