I use a Philips Blu-Ray player BDP 7500
Your mkv plays perfectly with my Blu-Ray Player on my TV! I've googled like crazy, but can not find an answer for my problem. I've used FairuseWizard v2.9 for encoding. I must be missing some very important settings! Would you please help me? Thank you very much!"

Unknown format ! Not recognized!"
