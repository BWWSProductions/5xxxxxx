    Maria is in the city, bored with her lover Tammy. An exhibitionist,      
    she answers an ad in the "New York Review of Sex." She's invited to a    
    house in Vermont, owned by an eccentric named Spencer, a man who         
    likes to watch. Maria goes, seeking thrills. She meets women who         
    spend their days rehearsing for shows staged for Spencer. He has a       
    concoction of aphrodisiacs, and the women are happy to take the drugs    
    and play - with each other, for the camera, in front of Spencer, and     
    with Boris, Spencer's assistant who runs the household. Maria throws     
    herself into the games. Which person will prove to be the ultimate       
    degenerate?
