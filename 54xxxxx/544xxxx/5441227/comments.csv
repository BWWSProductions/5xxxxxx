,ozc,2010-03-20T04:31Z,"zz1zz you need to turn encryption on.


EVERYONE NEEDS TO USE ENCRYPTION THESE DAYS. You're ISP wont be able to see what you're transferring however downloaders will see you if you're not behind a proxy. AFAIK it is illegal for the RIAA/MPAA etc to bring a law suit against you by breaking the law themselves. Meaning the only way they could see what you're doing is to join in on the torrent. Normally they would get your ISP records after finding you trading and use that as a record for your case. But if its ""encrypted"" they in theory, cant."
,JimTV,2010-03-20T11:49Z,big thx!
,zotrack,2010-03-20T20:16Z,This first episode was awesome and it will upset a lot of people and associations. Great! Thanks uploader!

,Cayronix,2010-03-21T02:46Z,"Ty, works great"
,russianmafia049,2010-03-22T06:35Z,how can i know if my encryption is on?

,Izrii,2010-04-02T07:47Z,thanks!
,hoscoe,2010-04-03T13:09Z,how do you go about encrypting?
,viperman5686,2010-04-11T06:21Z,"In uTorrent, you can turn on encryption by going to options > preferences (Ctrl+P) > BitTorrent > Outgoing: Enforced, Do not allow legacy connections."
,Tomek84a,2010-06-01T19:50Z,"zz1zz: Encryption defends you only against your ISP watching what you download/upload.
PeerGuardian (with the only working for me list: http___list_iblocklist_com_?list=bt_level1) defends you against antiP2P organizations by blocking connections to their IPs.
Of course nothing is 100% sure. But the above mentioned steps are better than nothing.
In my country only uploading is illegal, so for those only downloading a safe solution is to use forums with links to sites like rap1dshare.
To upload, or use BitTorrent, I think quite a safe solution is to use a proxy, which is encrypted, doesn't keep logs and of course offers good speed. It's not free, though."

,Tomek84a,2010-06-01T19:55Z,"In my country downloading is legal, so if antiP2P organization connects to tracker, configures client not to upload (only download) and will get information abut downloaders - I don't see where it's illegal, although it may violate the rules of tracker. But what if they start their own tracker...
My policy is to use PeerGuardian and wait for the first warning from my ISP, then perhaps it would be time for further steps."
