,BasilBrush,2010-03-22T00:20Z,"I'll release the HDTV 3rd episode at midnight (21st March 2010) and the PDTV probably tomorrow morning (22nd March 2010).

I'm a bit busy at the moment with the FIS and IBU events plus some other stuff."
,BasilBrush,2010-03-22T00:27Z,"If you want to get the torrent ASAP then get the torrent file from MVGroup. I'll only cross post the torrent to Piratebay, Demonoid and eztv once the torrent is well seeded."
