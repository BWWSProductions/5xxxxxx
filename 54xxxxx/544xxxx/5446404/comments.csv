,beckinsale_95,2010-03-20T08:29Z,"Hi. Thanks for the info regarding requests and Percy R5. 

I just wanted to know, though, if you will be doing ""Defendor"" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1303828/ If yes, then I'll have to wait for your release rather than get the one from ""Bulldozer"".

Your releases are small sized but not pixelated. Great work."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-20T10:47Z,"@ar1990: As I said before, from your wish-list none. I cannot and I've explained that few times last week. In short - I hardly manage to keep my schedule.

@beckinsale: I just did Defendor. Expect it after scheduled shows: Caprica, Ricky Gervais and Real Time. Probably around 5 PM CET (17 00 CET)."
