PLOT: At 48 years-old, Manhattan restaurateur Will Keane (Gere) is handsome, successful, single and determined to keep it that way. A consummate playboy who's perfected the art of casual romance, Will adores women, but has never thought seriously about marriage or commitment... until he meets Charlotte Fielding (Ryder). Charming, vivacious and radiantly beautiful, Charlotte is unlike anyone Will's ever known before, and as their relationship blossoms from a heated one-night-stand into something rare and wonderful, they both realize this love will last a lifetime. But, for Charlotte, a lifetime may be much shorter than either of them are prepared to accept.
