,BigDownUnder,2010-03-24T11:26Z,"Rar is stupid, If your gonna upload anything or share anything dont make people have to work for it. Please upload in AVI or other video format. "
,Scorpwanna,2010-03-29T02:42Z,"Raring something then sharing it is actually a good thing. Sure downloading the avi extracted as it is is great too but during a download of a torrent you can get some corrupt data which can cause the blocky smear when playing through and other visual hiccups. Raring something and breaking it into several small files is helpful because if any one of those small files are corrupt the archive cannot be extracted until you redownload a non-corrupt part. If it extracts there should be no problems with playback. And let me ask, just how long does it take to unrar something. Takes me about a few seconds. Not really a big deal."
