,Yaguazo,2010-04-10T04:55Z,Has anyone else really confirmed that this update will mess up a pirated copy of 2.1?
,Beartheshadows,2010-06-04T21:38Z,"I took a leap of faith and gave this a shot.
The result: IT WORKS!
Run the 'Superior Installer' and follow the instructions and then run the 'patch'. Click the ""Patch"" button and locate your VST folder (usually under C:/ > Program Files > VST Plugins). Highlight the folder and click OK. 
Easy as pie. Thanks for the upload. "

,UberGuy94,2010-07-30T12:50Z,"I got a bad trojan after installing this.  As in, I couldn't open up anti-virus and CPU was high in the double digits."
,ilkarus,2010-09-03T16:48Z,"Definately has a trojan in it but the crack works. Just keep your security settings high, install it and remove the virus."
,fl3shwound,2010-10-12T02:21Z,"Thank you!
Works perfectly, didn't screw anything up, no trojans or anything.
Do what ""Beartheshadows"" said and you'll be fine.
Thanks again :D"
,mutekiazy,2011-01-27T13:17Z,"I'm getting an error message when I try to run the installer telling me that It's not compatible with my version of Windows, and that I should check whether I need the x86 or x64 version.

I'm running 64bit Win 7 Ultimate with compatibility for both x86 and x64, so I can't see what the problem is.

Anyone else come across this or know how to solve it?"
,what999,2011-02-19T16:05Z,"ok, everyone, there is  a trojan in it. After click on the superior exe file it will unpack the original superior drummer file and some other files(trojan)in the document and user profile. (winxp). From there you can copy the superior installer file and use it. It works. Tried in in an virtual xp. "
