With more than 4 million active installations, MySQL is the world's most popular open-source database. Known for its speed, high reliability, and ease of use, MySQL is rapidly becoming a low-cost alternative to high-priced, high-maintenance database systems from Oracle, IMB and Microsoft-and it already has more users than any of these more established proprietary databases. The MySQL User's Guide is the only official guide to installing MySQL, to setting up and administering databases, and to storing and retrieving data in these databases. Written by the creators of MySQL, and edited by the highly respected MySQL authors, the MySQL User's Guide is designed for a broad audience. Non-programmers and programmers alike will be able to quickly get up-to-speed with MySQL using the clear instructions, examples, and tips provided in the book.
