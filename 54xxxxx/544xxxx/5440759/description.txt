* About

"Slave to the Wage" is a single by alternative rock band Placebo. Taken from their third album, it reached number 19 in the UK singles chart. The song, inspired by the drudgery of having a "9 to 5" job in the modern world, is about not working oneself into an early grave. Bob Dylan's "Maggie's Farm" is also mentioned in the lyrics. The song samples the intro of "Texas Never Whispers" by Pavement.

The music video is directed by Howard Greenhalgh and was inspired by the movie Gattaca.
