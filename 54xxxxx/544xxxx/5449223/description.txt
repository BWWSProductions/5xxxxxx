**********************************************************************************
this plug-in replace the poor-shit standart winamp's decoder who names in_mp3.dll!
mad plug-in uses advanced algorithm to decode mp3's despite that made in 2001 year :-) since this year it not upgrade for some reason :-
**********************************************************************************
instalation: 1) go to winamp->plugins directiry and remove in_mp3.dll file(or transfer to other directory), then put here in_mad.dll file. 2) Start winamp go to options->preferences->plug-ins->input->mad plug-in->select mad plug-in and click configure, then check up that there was ENABLED checkbox, also you may set 24-bit sound(if soundcard support this). Its all! restart winamp and enjoy high quality decoded sound! 
**********************************************************************************


ATTENTION lacks:

bad works with shoutcast internet radio(non discreet playback and don't show title name of radio and song playing! also poor IDTAGs editions and show!

if this plugin don't satisfy you, then you may always delete in_mad.dll file from winamp->plugins directory and put here original in_mp3.dll! 
 GOOD LUCK!
