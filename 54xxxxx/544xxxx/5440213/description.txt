Wikipedia - Homework is the debut album of French electronic music duo Daft Punk, first released on January 20, 1997. The album is considered a blend of house, techno, acid and funk.[1][2] It is noted for inciting interest in French touch music with several artists following the style.[3] Homework features the hit singles "Around the World" and "Da Funk".

Amazon.co.uk Review By Ed Potton - Solely responsible for the current interest in all things funky and French, the Daft Punk boys, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, can do no wrong. Breaking into the club scene with their own blend of techno-disco in 1995, their debut album is the 80's electro-funk record of your dreams. Influenced by old school Chicago house and Detroit minimalist techno (all name checked on "Teachers"), Homework ranges from the warped electro that has become their trademark on "Around the World" and "Da Funk", to banging acid techno on "Rollin'and Scratchin'" and "Alive". An album so funky it could make James Brown cry, and with so much bite you can feel it at the back of your throat.
