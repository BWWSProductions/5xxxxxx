Original Shatter.exe: 163 786 167 bytes, md5:c08dc6929acd430807d32996445e1032

THIS Shatter.exe: 164 538 880 bytes, md5: f445cd18a17425d07f709b20c53092c2
THIS file has embedded virus. But you still can extract the repacked working release (no viruses there, but still NOT original, repacked), it's located in resources of this Shatter.exe: RCDATA\1003

Please, remove this crap from your hdd asap and get original release. At least it won't have viruses inside."
