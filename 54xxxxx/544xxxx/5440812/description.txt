Youve waited for months! Heres part TWO of the new Counter-Strike 10 developed by VALVe in association with Source Corps and FPSBanana(and all its fine members)

Will be posting the MATERIALS folder and the MODELS folder next!


Forum Post on counterstrikesource.com:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HERE IT IS!(well, part of it) 
These are the CORE files which you need to run the game(scripts,sound,resource,etc) i had to divide em all up because the total package was too big. Next will be the materials, models, and maps. 

Core CS10 files: 

READMEH!!! 

If you dont want to overwrite your existing CSS, rename your cstrike folder "cstrike2" and then rename THIS cstrike folder "cstrike" and just rename the folders whenever you want to play either one.THIS WILL BE AWESUM! 

Features: 
NO CAMPAIGN(in this release) 
HUUUUGE map pack, never download a map again, you got it! 
NEW Physics 
Every single weapon is NEW or REDONE! 
New maps you probably havent played yet. 
Mw2 CT models(Guy on the Game Cover, Ghost, Hunter, and Price) 
Mw2 T models(Sheperd's traitors[that burn roach and ghost at the end of MW2] basically SEAL Team 6 vs US Army Rangers 
new GUI(new background,HUD,Interface) 
minor icon tweaks 
new sounds and game startup music 
Professioanlly done weapons,nades, and knife. 
Customized Buy menu, in-game text and alerts(cstrike_english) 
New Buy menu Images for most. 
many more minor tweaks and fixes(easier to read text) 

Just wait a little bit more, the rest is coming! 

Can yall do without all of the custom maps today and just play with the default CS ones for now, the ultra compressed map pack is 3.4 GB and i need to find somewhere to host it(probably gonna make a torrent) 


ENJOY! COUNTER-STRIKE 10 IS HERE
