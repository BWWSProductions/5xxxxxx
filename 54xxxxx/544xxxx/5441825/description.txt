Please, do not make my work (and life) harder than already is.
By choosing small-file for download, you already saved, right?
There is no need to LIMIT your upload to others, I cannot allow that.
You all have been warned many times, on different ways.
You cannot screw my seeding-system up, maybe temporarily or once, but you would be at lost, at the end.

Do not: use foul language in your comments. Read, however, everything written.
Do not post stupidities.
Do not judge as bad neither me or my work, fact is - you don't know me.
Internet is a Big place, if you're not satisfied with my torrents or my work - silently go away. No harm would be done.
I do not care if you do not show respect. Simple as that.

Remember, I have something, you want that. You can get it, under my terms. No exceptions.
If you don't care; I repeat, I do not care. Go someplace else.
