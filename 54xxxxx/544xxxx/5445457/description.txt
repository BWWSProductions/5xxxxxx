Wanpaku Sumo literally translated to "Naughty Sumo", is a quickly fading tradition in Japan's rich cultural history. The sport of sumo wrestling is steeped in religious ceremony ritual, a far contrast from today's cosmopolitan consumer society that makes up most of the population. In a sparing hope to keep the sumo culture alive, a few hundred Japanese elementary school competitors battle it out once a year to have the honor of the Jr. Yokozuna title. While the audience in attendance was mostly composed of the extended family of the contestants, it was clearly visible that the image sumo wrestling is stricken to an audience of convalescents and daytime public broadcasting channels.
