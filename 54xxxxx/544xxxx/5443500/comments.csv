,d.eichkind,2010-03-19T07:51Z,"If that's Circa Survive then they got rid of Anthony Green, that sounds NOTHING like him. So this torrent is fake, besides the song Get Out."
,taker455,2010-03-19T07:52Z,"you guys are dicks, no wonder it's anonymous..NOT CIRCA SURVIVE..the only song from circa is get out..which is what this torrent should do..get the F out"
,taker455,2010-03-19T08:02Z,by the way..your band sucks the only good song on here is circa's
,good_apollo,2010-03-19T20:13Z,"this is not circa i just saw them on tuesday in SA TX, and A. G. is still there. The other guy almost sounds like him but not really the real song is get out. frozen creek and strange terrain are real songs on the new album but i do not know if thats the way they sound."
,good_apollo,2010-03-19T20:22Z,its not the real thing just checked it out i crossed referenced album cover with music and song titles on harvards myspace page. ASSHOLE!!!
