MurderDeathKill was spawned in the high desert of
Victorville, California in late 2008 when some of the
founding members of the heavyweight hardcore heroes Blood
Stands Still decided to start a new project with the
mission to be heavier, and more controversial than anything
that the world had ever seen.

Hardcore Veteran Pitbull Dan Banura quickly recruited his
brother/former band mate Art Banura to play drums. Now,
with this brutal backbone in place, MDK enlisted their long
time friends Aaron, and Sean Bennet to head up vocals. Once
the lineup was solidified, MDK wrote and recorded a demo
and started jumping on shows with bands such as Suicide
Silence, The Acacia Strain, and Impending Doom. Their
collective goal was to write music that was extremely heavy
and in your face without going too far in the metal
direction. The dueling vocals, pummeling riffs, and precise
rhythms as well as their insane live shows are what set
this band far apart from anything else in the genre. In
just a short time after the bands inception, they already
had dozens of high profile shows under their belts.

The bands busy show schedule combined with their
reputation for delivering one of the heaviest, most intense
live shows around quickly gained them attention, and
respect. In early 2009, MDK signed with hardcore super
label Mediaskare Records, and immediately began working
on their full-length debut entitled Fuck With Us And Find
Out, due out this October.

MurderDeathKill has already completed tours with Life
Ruiner, Betrayal, American Me, Endwell, and Suffokate, and
also has an upcoming US tour slated with Gravemaker and
Donnybrook next month. The band plans to continue touring
nonstop on their forthcoming album, and push the limits as
they deliver their relentless brand of heavyweight
hardcore. If you have yet to experience one of MDKs
infamous live shows, do yourself a favor and check them
out.
