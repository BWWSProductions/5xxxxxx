Couldn't find a good torrent for this so here it is for anyone who loves this outstanding DJ:


John 00 Fleming was back with this third Radio 1 Essential Mix. The first 2 have already created history, so expect something very special from this one, with added fx, synths, samples and much. He's treated it like a 2 hour remix.

This show was broadcast on the 13th February 2010, 3-5am GMT on Radio 1.
