Houssam returns home to Cairo for New Year's Eve after a year's separation from his wife with a group of 
Americans prospecting business with an Egyptian entrepreneur. He has plans for a romantic night alone with
his wife after a full year of treatment from impotence in the U.S.. His plans to conceive a child are
thwarted by several events, some of which are comedic episodes as they travel around Cairo looking for a 
room.The biggest threat is a terrorist plot to bomb the hotel at which he and the group of American in town
for business are staying at.Although the film takes place in one day, Houssam, Awadein, Sarah, Srg. Peter and 
others have flashbacks that link all of them together. The flashbacks include incidents during and after
9/11, depictions of Awadein being tortured in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, and Rachel and Soraya in Gaza and
