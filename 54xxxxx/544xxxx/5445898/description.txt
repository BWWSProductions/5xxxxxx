        The hunt for them who murdered Paul Sorrell continues after  
        Devon Marshall and Jedda Atkins are released due to lack of  
        evidence. Max believes that teenager Jasmine Harris has      
        information she is hiding. Mickey doesn't want her involved  
        but Neil over rules him. Devon makes a deal after his house  
        is burgled and his car set on fire and tells the police who  
        really fired the bullet.
