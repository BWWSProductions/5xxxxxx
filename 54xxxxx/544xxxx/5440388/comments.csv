,Zyphr52,2012-06-17T04:50Z,"What the hell is going on, here?  I am a faithfull seeder, and this sickens me.  At the moment, I am downloading at 1kb, and at my peaks, my biggest uploader only has 12% of the torrent, while there are 5 100%s that I'm connected to, not giving me squat.  Therefore, I have matched your speeds and capped my upload until someone decides to start doing the right thing and seed to us who don't have it.  Be a real pirate, and share your goods."
