,Paedric,2012-01-09T13:27Z,"Release Note:

  While testing the game we encountered a bug on some computers. This bug is 
  present in the final retail product that was shipped to stores. The 
  developers ""fix"" for this problem is not to use the mouse in the menu.


What this means is from the point where it says press ""enter"" until you are actually within the game...do NOT press your mouse button...if you do..the controls won't work...if you don't....you can use all controls...including the mouse INSIDE the game itself
