Nero Burning Rom 6 with a keygen included. I also added a crack, just in case...

Enjoy!


Nero Burning ROM, commonly called just Nero, is an optical disc authoring program for Microsoft Windows by Nero AG (formerly Ahead Software).




This program WILL indeed work on Windows Vista

this program works on Vista....
1) extract the content of the Nero66012.exe with winrar on a temp folder 
2) right click on setup.exe and check compatibility / Run this program in compatibility mode for XP SP2...
3) run the setup disregarding Vista warnings
4) run the register.reg
5) right clink on "C:Program FilesAheadNeronero.exe" and idem 2)
6) run nero disregarding Vista warnings


I have nothing else to say so just leave a comment if you seem to have any problem. Many people prefer the not so old versions, which is why I am uploading this.
