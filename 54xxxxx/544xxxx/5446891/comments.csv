,empty3,2010-07-14T23:44Z,"more people should comment... or else you feel like it could be tainted.  but this is fine - clean and useful, keygen quick and easy.nnthanks!"
,semigod,2010-07-22T09:17Z,"Fast download, fast installation, easy keygen, program works perfectly... What more can you ask for? Thank you eldiego90!"

,HotJonny420,2010-07-30T05:27Z,"works perfectly, and no red flags."
,daltron101,2010-08-01T21:45Z,no bullshit here. i had this from the pirate bay to burning cds in less then 10 minutes. fast DL and easy install...thanks eldiego90 
,LelouchD,2010-08-13T14:02Z,"2,1 Mb/Sec Sweet!! The only downside is that it doesnt work on Windows 7 or Vista regardless of what eldiego90 or anyone else says cuz i followed the instrucktions and it failed hard.

(No virus here)"
,MtKing74,2010-09-06T00:49Z,"Seriously, This works like a charm on WIN7. Just right-click on the program file and click ""run as administrator"" That solves the problem.
Furthermore, when Win7 says ""Compability problem"", you are still able to run the installation fully, and the serial generator is a bargain. 
High value download!!!"
,eefersen,2010-09-25T15:40Z,thanks!!!!!
,Saki33,2010-11-18T22:06Z,"For the person who says keygen doesn't work, try this. Click it to generate new serial # and copy and paste that into the serial box. Click it as many times as you need to get it to accept, but once should do it. And by all means do NOT let the program go online or check for updates. Safest way is to disconnect your router while installing and be sure to uncheck the update box on the product center page. Also a good idea to block the program with your firewall."
,bruteanimal,2011-01-14T20:47Z,"I'm very disappointed with this torrent. I use win XP Pro. It's the 1st time I install something that works 100%, yet it works badly. It does create CDs, the problem is the created CDs take an eternity to load, they run badly, and my PC gets stuck while reading them. The 6.6.0.13.exe + keygen bittorrent had worked like a charm on my PC but I lost it, I will try and download/install it again!"
,bruteanimal,2011-01-15T03:27Z,"I stand corrected (see my comment above). The CDs recorded do work fine on the original PC where recorded, the problems happen when playing them on a different one! And the cracks are fine too! Still I had to install the 66013 version and use the cracks provided on here, NOW my installed Nero does work like a charm, thanks for the upload!"
,gapiswe,2011-01-18T16:54Z,"Works just fine with windows vista! Thanks for the great upload, old versions rock!"
,Nakedmason,2011-03-17T19:34Z,"Worked great for me on my Win Vista box Burned a disk after install, and it worked perfect. Thanks..."
,sfey,2011-03-19T06:38Z,downloaded in 30 secs works great
,puffypuff,2011-04-01T05:25Z,Works great! This is the best DVD burning software I have ever used.
,itsSolo,2011-04-10T22:53Z,Works great in vista x64 and windows 7 x64
,shackman999,2011-05-07T16:52Z,"Using XP Pro + antivirus - no viruses found :), however:
The Keygen does not work, say
 ""Application failes to initialize properly (0xc0000135)""

he Crack program loaded but wasn't effective (didn't crack)
Downloaded this torrent twice to be sure."

,michaelrwatson,2011-11-02T03:43Z,"Well, i can't add much to the comments above, but i too have been using this for several years w/o a hitch. No need for larger bloated versions w/ higher version numbers. Thanks man!"
,michaelrwatson,2011-11-02T03:48Z,"@bruteanimal: the problem is your CD-burner, not this copy of Nero. I've had similar problems w/ well-used CD burners on campus, but on my good (and lightly used) Lite-On CDRW at home, no problems whatsoever, ever, and they play fine in any drive. Sorry. "
,ntinakos91,2011-11-13T13:40Z,"i want help!i have windows 7 and when i play the nero,is close th programm... "
,ntinakos91,2011-11-13T13:40Z,please help me....!!!
,azarghat,2012-03-03T19:38Z,"At number 5), what do you mean by:
