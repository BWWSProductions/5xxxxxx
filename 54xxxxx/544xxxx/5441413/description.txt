"Best of the West"  ABC TV 1981-1982

Loved this show when I was a kid and have searched around for it and ended up buying bootleg DVDs from a dude who had taped it off Australian TV on VHS...I ripped 'em to AVI and am sharing them with the hope some kind soul will do the same with my other favorite childhood show "TAXI"  - the whole TAXI series would be on Bittorrent, you'd think, given it's greatness AND the fact that it IS available on DVD.

That would be a lovely "thank you" for upping this rare and great TV show.

From IMDB:

"Most fans of the cult sit-com series TAXI think that the next smash success connected to the writers, directors, and producers was CHEERS. They are right - for CHEERS was a greater success than TAXI was. But in between, in 1981, the same group tried a historical western sit-com called BEST OF THE WEST. Although very clever and funny the series only lasted one year. Somehow the forces that made TAXI and CHEERS work just were not in the cards for this series...

****REQUEST****  The whole series of TAXI uploaded would be a real treat for fans of the show, Thanks!
