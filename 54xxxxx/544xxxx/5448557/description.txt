Sex expert Tristan Taormino teaches a G-spot workshop for couples where she reviews female sexual anatomy, dispels myths about the G-spot, and offers explicit advice to improve and enhance G-spot stimulation. With fingers and toys, co-hosts Donna and Sarah demonstrate various techniques as Tristan narrates; workshop participants watch and ask questions.

We meet Faith and Alec, who begin slow, sensual foreplay, followed by a spirited illustrating of different positions and stimulation techniques. When Alec brings out a vibrator with a special G-spot attachment, it sends Faith over the edge into ecstasy.

Next we meet Penny and Evan, a passionate couple who love toys. Evan warms up Penny with his mouth and fingers, then tries out a unique curved G-Spot vibe. At the start of intercourse, Penny is already on the edge of climax as Evan explores the best positions for a G-spot orgasm...on stairs, standing, where the perfect angle brings Penny to her knees -literally!

Kylie shares her G-spot experiences, which for her frequently lead to female ejaculation. Her partner Derrick knows just how to get her turned on enough to squirt. As they hit the 'spot' with glass dildo and cock, she squirts until the couch beneath them is soaked!

Delve into the world of G-spot orgasm with sex expert Tristan Taormino, and her sexy, demonstrating couples, as you learn, experience, and enjoy this unique form of pleasure... led by the experts who know it best.
