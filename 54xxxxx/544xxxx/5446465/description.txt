Republic of Doyle S01E09: He Sleeps With the Chips

When a dubious chip truck owner notices his truck is missing - along with his driver/best buddy - he cons Jake into taking the case; Martin really crosses a line with Rose and she takes matters into her own hands; and Jakeâ€™s divorce becomes final and heâ€™s happy to tell Leslie that heâ€™s now a free-agent. But Leslieâ€™s just been bumped up the ladder with a promotion to Sergeant, and her eye is on the job, not Jake Doyle.

The resolution is 608x352 and while the quality is not up to scene standards it is quite watchable in my opinion. I know that the file size is about 10 MB less than normal - I did things as usual and that is what AutoGK generated.
