,sapdaddy,2010-03-18T11:32Z,"Oh and i'm itchy to see number 6 lose just to see his reaction hehehhe, but at the same time i'd rather he didn't leave
I'm rooting for that sexy crazy chick but I'm pretty sure 2's got this one, dude's invincible (shame he cries more than an infant)"
,Sinant,2010-03-18T17:28Z,awesome I been waiting for this
,pixiesmiles,2010-03-20T04:09Z,"sapdaddy... welcome to the group of solitary fans! I suspect more people would love the show if like you, they caught a few minutes by chance... it's kind of addictive that way. ;o) 

You know... I find myself rooting for the crazy chick too.  She's tough!  Gotta love a girl who played high school football!  I played high school water polo which is pretty darn vicious (especially when ya play with the guys), but I suspect football is even tougher. 

I'm sure hoping another network picks this show up... and doesn't let it die after only 4 seasons. 

Hope you're enjoying the show. :o)"

I'm just glad I was able to upload it at all.  Not sure if it was the same for everyone.. but I couldn't get anything at all to upload here for 2 to 3 days. I did create and begin seeding the torrent during that time, and folks who subscribed to my rss feed were able to download it before it even appeared on pirate bay. "
