,thunderbum,2010-03-17T22:27Z,Thank you!
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-18T00:14Z,If Health Care passes...Can we finally say that the President has succeeded...END
,booboo332,2010-03-18T00:30Z,"Sure . . . . he will have succeeded in instituting a major step towards a single payer health system and thus expanding the state's control over people's lives, creating multigenerational debt and creating untold misery through the joys of rationed healthcare.

Have doubts it is a step towards socialized healthcare?  Just ask Barney Frank, who has publicly said he wants a single payer system and that the public option is the best way to work towards it.  Something tells me he knows more about the Democrats goals than you, tricky.

Once tax dollars fund the majority of healthcare, the nanny statists will feel justified in interfering with peoples lives and the current health nazis and their crusade against transfats, salt and sugary drinks will look like nothing. "
,booboo332,2010-03-18T00:30Z,ps Thanks to the uploader
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-18T02:00Z,"I keep hearing about the destruction of the American Health Care system, the Government will control every aspect of my life, and the debt will spiral out of control...For one the bill on the table is not for single payer...Two we spent Billions on Weapons of Mass Destructions which did not exist...So I could care less about the billions you are personally paying for...Third this is not about worrying about whether or not the GREEDY Insurance companies are happy....Its about fixing a BROKEN system...END"
,gordonl,2010-03-18T02:58Z,"Thanks jwhitt.  Tricky, we should be more worried about the present administration's mockery of the Constitution in trying to get their agenda passed. As Obama has said, ""I don't care about the process, as long as health care passes."" "
,booboo332,2010-03-18T03:49Z,Clearly Tricky didn't read my comment.

,Johannes58,2010-03-18T13:28Z,@trickeldick it depends on what you consider success to be... 
,Johannes58,2010-03-18T14:28Z,"A clunker that travels 12,000 miles a year at 15 mpg uses 800 gallons of gas a year.
A vehicle that travels 12,000 miles a year at 25 mpg uses 480 gallons a year.
So, the average Cash for Clunkers transaction will reduce US gasoline consumption by 320 gallons per year.
The Obama administration claims 700,000 vehicles so that's 224 million gallons saved per year.
That equates to a bit over 5 million barrels of oil.
5 million barrels is about 5 hours worth of US consumption.
More importantly, 5 million barrels of oil at $70 per barrel costs about $350 million dollars.
So, the government paid $3 billion of our tax dollars to save $350 million.
We spent $8.57 for every dollar we saved.
I'm pretty sure they will do a great job with our health care, though."

End of Line."

,Johannes58,2010-03-19T13:02Z,perhaps we can re-program it! (trickledickbaby)

,booboo332,2010-03-20T22:39Z,"""I will do me and not worry about you""

Spoken like the pretentious, self absorbed git that you have proven yourself to be in every post."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-23T18:33Z,Let me explain to you and ONLY you that I do what I want to do...I understand why some of you want to be me but you should love who you are...END 
,booboo332,2010-03-23T20:38Z,"And the narcissism continues . . . 

Your pretentiousness is evident in your open declaration of an intent to ""do you"".  Most people just BE themselves.

Let me simplify it even further for you.

You frontin, fool."
