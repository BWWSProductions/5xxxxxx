Seeding without leechers :-("
,tommcd,2010-05-03T18:47Z,"Thanks for allowing everyone to hear the fiercely original and uncompromising music of Roger Trigaux and Present.
If you guys really like this stuff, please purchase one or more of their CDs. These guys are not mega-rich rock stars you know. They are in it solely to push the envelope of organized sound that we call music.
You can find their stuff here:

I have all their albums. I saw them live when they played here in Philly in 2005.
It was a truly AMAZING!!! show."
