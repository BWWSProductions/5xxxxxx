So that's not an erotic game (although Druuna is a porn strip character, the game has just used her to attract lonely single men to buy this crap). "

[T],dramacore,2010-03-26T14:20Z,i don't think buying based on a description is purely impulsive. what about people who read books? 
,frank_pe,2010-03-26T17:29Z,Well books usually don't cost so much and you can loan them at a library free. Nowdays when it's easy to find much info about a game you don't have to waste your money.
,Venin,2010-05-10T05:22Z,"I've read a lot reviews for this game, and all of them were bad. But I very much enjoyed the Druuna comics and I have loved every single game with Microids' name on it. So I figure I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Of course, every good developer and/or publisher has their share of bad games, so this just may be Microids' first. I will never know unless I try it out for myself. Thank you very much for uploading this, frank_pe.

Not very many seeds at the moment, but I'm hoping that improves eventually. I'm counting on you guys!"
