BTW is N537JB around still, I heard he was looking for me ;)"
,Mr888,2010-03-19T10:34Z,"this is marginally better than your Abacus uploads, but still far from what you should consider a quality upload mr mamuck. Overall your uploads are in the crap bucket catagory and are not worth the feedback I'm giving you. Mr Machcumcheecks would simply tell you to dart his ring with your tounge and be done with you, but I'm telling you nicely that your uploads arnt worth shit. I would rather download a FS98 Lego Star Wars model and make zoom zoom noises in rhythm than waste my time with your Excellent Editition."

cheers mate, 888 is trying to be his hero machIIcumshot, he even gave reference to cumshot in 1 of my other torrents, bless him. 
i think 888's just angry, i heard his uncle make him lick his big fat veiny cock so he takes it out on evryone else."
,flypro1,2011-01-08T05:17Z,"keep it up...you rock dont listen to 888 he is just so jealous that he is saying that so that he can resist the urge to fuck u
:) luv u"
,ThatsLife1988,2011-01-09T04:50Z,"Yes Finally Eurofighter, I am so happy. You are a great uploader. Mind if i make a request??

For everyone with no uploads to stop requesting and start uploading :)

Cheers Mate top quality!"
