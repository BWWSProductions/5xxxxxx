After a two-year break, award-winning electro trendsetters Goldfrapp return to their synthpop roots with their brilliant new album, Head First. The perfect showcase for the unique vocal range of lead singer Alison Goldrapp and studio genius Will Gregory, the fifth album from the London duo is arguably their most exciting record to date.
