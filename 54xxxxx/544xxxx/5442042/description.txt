Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures S01E03: Code Check

The present. Jealous and sensing ulterior motives in Fitz's (Shawn Ashmore) return to Toronto, Chen (Byron Mann) confronts him with a stash of love letters he wrote to Ming (Mayko Nguyen). The two come to blows then reflect back on a time during their residency when they helped each other out during a Code Blue. At the ensuing peer assessment review, Fitz takes stock of his mettle as a doctor, his motives as a friend and his true feelings for Ming.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion.
