Only 1800 KB/S avg bitrate for a 720p video? Isn't the quality ruined ?
Not much difference, WATCH THE SAMPLE if snap shots aren't convincing enough.
On a big screen Full HD one might notice some minimal difference in sharpness.
Let me ask you; what difference do you hear between a FLAC and 320 KB/s song?
The good news is x264 can do magic (with the right encoding settings).
Bad news is it can take ages (in my case 8 Hours/episode on a 4 GB RAM pc).
You will never see blocky dark scenes or any other anomalies in my rips.
Why not kept the original DTS?
I agree DTS is cool for a sci-fi, action movie but here is mostly dialog,
horses, sounds from ancient times so AC3 will do, plus we saved many GB-s.
Also many people seem to struggle with DTS.

Intro & Finale Credits removed except S1.Ep1-Intro & S2.Ep10-Finale.
Why are they removed and why are episodes joint together in pairs??
We saved 1.1 GB by removing them, these series are very addictive so
watch 2 episodes (apx 1 Hour 35 minutes) at once
without waiting & skipping through the credits(they are all the same).

The original was deblocked -3 -3 so from time to time the picture seemed unnaturally sharp and pixelated.
Here is a snap shot from the original of the same frame as the second picture:

(Watch her skin!)

In my decoding setting you can see I used deblocking 1 1 to make it a bit smoother and realistic.

Tested with Media Player Classic and on HD Fantec Media Player(media-box).
