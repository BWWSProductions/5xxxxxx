source:

http://e.imagehost.org/0459/Rome_S02E10_1080p_BluRay_DTS_x264-H_M_AC3_mkv_snapshot_00_07_32_2010_03_19_14_58_32.jpg

so it's easier to see the difference.

right click/open in a new tab both and see the difference.

You can see that the skin of the girl is more natural & smoother, not so pixelated as the original. The downside of course is that a few details of man's cloth are washed out.

Don't forget the source is 160 GB and ours is 17 GB and the Russian audio in the original is not proper dub but  a voice talking over the English Audio(if I'd be Russian I'd rather watch it in English with the Russian subtitles).
Any way all my (our) all respect to the ripper and uploader of the source, it was a great effort of him(them) indeed. cheers


Faststone(it's free) is a very good image viewer(to watch full screen etc), you can see the pics better full screen from desktop then from browser."

,Bakonburger,2010-12-23T07:45Z,"Wonderful stuff, and an excellent torrent. Highly recommended.

Watched it using MPCstar, only remark is that once in a couple episodes, for a few seconds, the video runs at about 2x normal speed. "

,bondoMaga,2011-04-10T21:40Z,"Is this the Region 1 or the Region 2 DVD release?

(Region 2 has the original uncut versions of episodes 1, 2, and 3--instead of the cut-down versions originally broadcast on BBC and released on the Region 1 DVD set).

Thanx... "

,.Leto.,2012-03-12T16:38Z,"Picture quality is quite good considering the small size BUT the downloading speed is horribly slow! I'm getting this at 20kb/s at the moment!! I've also downloaded Rome from a russian site ( rutracker*org , best a
Also, why did you group them by 2? Sure, as all good series it's very addictive but what the hell made you think that we would always watch them by 2? Meaning that if we stop watching in the middle of 2 episodes we have to remember where we were and find it again. Really dumb IMO. Removing intros and final credits was a good idea but you should have used individual episodes."
,.Leto.,2012-03-12T19:32Z,"Nevermind, I'm downloading this at full speed now thanks to a crazy canadian who's seeding at 900kb/s! Insane, that uploading speed is totally unimaginable in my country :(
So you just have to be lucky and get the right seeder.
About rutracker*org since it got cut in my previous comment, in case you don't know it's the biggest and best torrent site in the world. All in russian but most of the time movies / tv series are in russian / english so you just have to use MKVtoolnix to remove what's in russian.
Thepiratebay is a total joke compared to that site :D"
