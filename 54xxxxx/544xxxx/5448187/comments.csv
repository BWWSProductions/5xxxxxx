I just found out that the software I used for creating this image didn't make a proper layer break, which is needed for burning on a double layer DVD. The image works flawlessly when I mount it in a virtual drive (Daemon Tools), but I have no way of testing if it would work properly if burned onto a DVD and used on a standalone player.

I suggest that you build a new disc image from the VIDEO_TS folder inside this image using ImgBurn, which creates a layer break. Better safe than sorry.

Sorry for the inconvenience caused to y'all!"
