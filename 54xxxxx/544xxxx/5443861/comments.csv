,dekkarate,2011-08-01T12:05Z,"Thanks a lot Bellboy for uploading this fantastic Brando classic. Fast download.
The Audio & video I rate as excellent..10/10.
Also thanks to all seeders, it is very much appreciated.
Utorrent is free,so the only way i can show my gratitude,is to seed back,which i have.
The name of the game is to ""give & take."" 
 SO DON""T JUST TAKE!!

,KKafka,2012-01-21T23:45Z,"Good quality, A/7, V/7. Small file = fast download. Thanks for all the subtitles, they work fine! Sound and subtitles are in sync.
720x576 (16:9) is wrong aspect ratio for this film. Adjusted it to 4:3 on VLC player to get it right."
,boondoddle,2012-01-31T02:55Z,Thank you!
,enonumus,2012-07-12T07:47Z,"Folks... audio sync and video aspect ratio can be very easily and permanently corrected using MKV Merge or Yamb.  Just drop the movie file into either program, pick the new settings you desire for the audio and/or video, then pick where you want to save the new file, takes 2-3 minutes.  You can determine the exact audio correction amount by watching with VLC and adjusting until you get it right, then just use that same amount when you export the file.  No need to complain about these issues when they're so easily corrected."
