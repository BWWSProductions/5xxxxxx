Can anyone help !.

,NeMoD6989,2010-12-19T19:37Z,"@brownyboo

GUID is a unique hash that was generated from the cd-key. UTAN is a popular server addon that bans known GUIDs that have been caught cheating/hacking/exploiting."

,mrflibble,2011-03-31T23:03Z,"how did gog get this deal from epic?
online play for each copy, yes please! my only drawback is that this does not include the ece mods, only the maps. Once you get all of the CBP and UCBPs, you have well over 200 maps."
,Wolvie501,2011-05-04T15:49Z,Are you serious this doesnt include the private patch etc?
,Wolvie501,2011-05-04T15:51Z,I am going to get the manuel for this one... couse I dun like the GUID ban post allready.
