Mercedes-Benz Truck Racing is a truck racing game based on the BreakNeck engine, with the Mercedes license behind it. Test your skills in racing a million dollar souped-up freightliner in a 1st or 3rd person view.

The game supports a variety of steering devices, though a simple keyboard will do. It features real truck racing teams and drivers, realistic damage, a replay editor, and an optional unlimited speed mode (trucks are normally limited to 160 km/h to minimize the damage these 5 tonners do when they spin out of control).

Compete in single race or full season mode on a number of licensed race tracks from around Europe, or practice all tracks with or without a Ghost truck.
