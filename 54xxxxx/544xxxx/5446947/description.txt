Project Reality Mod installs alongside the existing game installation allowing both the original game and Project Reality to be played separately without causing conflicts.

The Mod developers aims are to rework the original game engine developed by Digital Illusions of Sweden (Dice) within legal and feasible constraints to create a more realistic combat environment for the gaming community. This includes adjusting various gameplay elements including physics, visual effects and overall game play formats. Along with changes to how the game handles, the PR team has introduced the British, Russian, Taliban and Insurgent factions, plus a number of community assisted factions are currently in the works to introduce Canadian, IDF forces and multiple others to the virtual battlefield.

Project Reality has won second place two years running in ModDB.com's annual Mod of the Year competition (2006 & 2007), culminating in first place in 2008. The competition is the definitive event that showcases the best mods and indie games in the world and recognizes the teams behind them."
