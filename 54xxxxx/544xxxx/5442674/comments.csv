,nicermog,2010-03-18T21:52Z,will you be uploading the new episode of married single other?
,beckinsale_95,2010-03-18T22:26Z,Have you done Percy Jackson R5 already? Couldn't seem to find it in your torrent list.
,jjabrams,2010-03-18T22:30Z,"thx 20/40 - no problem if you dont manage to do breaking bad or this, already about 70% of everthing I watch comes from this channel ! "
,mdaddio,2010-03-18T23:58Z,Thanks very much for your hard work.
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-19T09:47Z,"@nicermog: Yes, I did MSO, but in midst of TPB three-day blackout. I could up torrent, but everything is skewed a little. When - I have no idea, same as for Parenthood. 
In fact, both MSO and Parenthood were in the queue last night, but bad, shitty, hard-fisting behavior of the people who drag their asses kicking the brakes toward other peers made both shows and some things fell out.

@beckinsale_95: At first I have declined request for Percy, then I have encoded Telesync for one little girl - but, I told then - no more Percies, and holds on requests... Sorry.

@jjabrams: Same here. Enjoy the ride.

@mdaddio: Thank you."
