Do you need to activate it with a key or something like that?"
,danitaro,2010-03-19T03:30Z,is this cracked or just the application without key? oh and thanks! :-)
,modd1uk,2010-03-19T04:13Z,"Working perfectly so far cheers buddy !.

For those who are having problems.

1. Download torrent.

2. Download http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/rootsh/

3. Copy all necessery files from torrent to your N900 ROOT directory (dont put in folders).

4. Follow this tutorial http://thenokiablog.com/2010/01/28/how-to-install-deb-files-nokia-n900-x-terminal/ to learn how to install .deb files (really easy, took me 5 minutes).

5. Copy and paste .mlm file from keygen folder into the maps folder, overwrite existing .mlm file in there.

6. Open up Sygic, activate manually using keygen.

7. Enjoy and praise this guys work !!!"
,danitaro,2010-03-19T05:58Z,"isn't it possible to just install .deb file by clicking on it? excuse my for my ignorance..
I downloaded this, extracted it, copied everything to the root.. then clicked on 'setupmobilemaps.deb' it installed but know when I try to open sygic maps it automatically closes the program.. "
,danitaro,2010-03-19T06:25Z,"okey never mind.. it worked.. just had to put the files from the folder 'sygic mobile maps...' to the root.. works like a charm!
thx

first you have to delet the res and the drive folders from your phone and over new copy the res and drive folders to your phone.
restart the phone after done.
run sygic if its start normal then oki.
if the craches happens again run sygic and when you get the red policy screen pres quit and run sygic again and it wel stop from craschen."
