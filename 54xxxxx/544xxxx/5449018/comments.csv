in the description where it says ""aired

,htdang00,2010-03-21T11:18Z,Real deal. Thanks!
,erroneus,2010-03-21T17:21Z,"Yeah, oddly real and it seems it will continue like this through the rest of the season.

I would REALLY love to see a 720p version of the UK airing.  It would be quite superior as there is less of that cartoon network branding and other commercial type interruptions on the screen.  Even cooler to get 720p british versions from the beginning!"

,sauvagesauvage,2010-03-24T18:29Z,"for those who are interested. there is a 1080p version of this episode on demonoid, although its 1.46GB."
