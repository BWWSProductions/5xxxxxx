,gaitski,2010-03-22T18:01Z,"I keep getting this error message at 3% of the setup ""Setup interrompido por algum programa ou insuficiente espaco em disco!"" I have like 140 GB free on my disk, can anyone help?"
,smithy125,2010-03-22T18:59Z,"gaitski - make sure you extract the files in to the COD 4 MW folder and not the call of duty 4 mw folder, when done click on the little spanner and install. then enjoy, this game works 100 %"
,bonkers12,2010-03-22T19:55Z,"Whenever I run setup.exe, Norton 36o says it's a security problem and removes it. Even if I undo it, it still prevents me and allocates it "" High risk"". Any help?"
,smithy125,2010-03-22T20:04Z,"bonkers12 -  have you tried disabling norton and installing or disconnect fron internet and disable norton as well , then try install thats all i can say. It may help"
,bonkers12,2010-03-22T20:13Z,"Thanks, it just slightly worries me that it's so adament that it's dangerous, it is usually right."
,smithy125,2010-03-22T20:54Z,"norton can be a bit touchy on exe files, this program works 100 % and there is nothing wrong  with it, my anti virsus didnt even flag it up in a scan"
,bonkers12,2010-03-22T21:35Z,"Sorry, I'm having same prob as gaitski, and I've tried to do what you said but still not working could you clarify please? Hopefully last problem."
,bonkers12,2010-03-22T21:46Z,"What I meant is that it is actually sticking on 1% for  the last 20 minutes, is that normal?"
,smithy125,2010-03-22T21:47Z,"bonkers12 - after un raring the file go to install click on the COTTA-COD4 file ( a hat) and it will start to install given the launage is mexcian, it will then ask you where to install, you need to install it in the COD 4 MW folder it should look like this.

C:\!CALL OF DUTY 4 MW!\!CALL OF DUTY 4 MW!\!CALL OF DUTY 4 MW!\COD 4 MW

(If C is your main hard drive you want game on )

When you open this folder up you will see a little spanner click on this to install game. 

Hope this helps"
,smithy125,2010-03-22T22:01Z,bonkers12 -  it done that to me took over an hour to install
,gaitski,2010-03-22T22:11Z,"Thanks smithy, that did the trick. My problem was that I was creating a new folder Cod 4 mw instead of using the empty folder that the extract created."
,bonkers12,2010-03-22T22:25Z,"Yeh thanks Smithy, I really appreciate all your help, let's hope it installs soon now!"
,bonkers12,2010-03-22T23:18Z,"Sorry, I really do hope this is it, but over the last 2 hours, setup has been stuck on 1%. I have also tried closing it and starting again. Any ideas please?"
,Zarck0,2010-03-22T23:52Z,"bonkers12 is simple. ;)

1- delect you game

2- extract and install again

3- install the setup in the folder COD 4 MW

and run ""setup.bat our install.bat"" and wait +/- 30 minuts.
Let the installation run, it may seem stuck on 1% but not this: P
Do not cancel. If you cancel again do it again."
,aabell77,2010-04-01T06:48Z,"okay so i ran into one more problem, when i ran the setup, it got an error at 3%. i went into the ""readme"" in the Help folder and saw that ""Windows Vista users will need to install the update for DirectX 9.0c that is included on the game disc."" i am on vista so i am assuming that is my problem. but does anyone know what exactly that update is or where i can find it?"
