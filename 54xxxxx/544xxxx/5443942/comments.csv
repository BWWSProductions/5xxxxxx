I'm not saying i don't appreciate these release groups, and obviously it works for some people, but do they even properly test this stuff before releasing it, or is it a matter of getting new stuff out first no matter what?"

,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-03-19T16:57Z,"Thanks for the up but this game sucks

Just a simplistic shooter with no new stuff

Basic shooting
Basic explosives
And very annoying stuff

AND TOTALLY LINEAR (8-9 hours w/o replay value)

No gun upgrading, also"

,barbaneli,2010-03-21T14:22Z,"@ ATI DX9 USERS:

After i have been getting the crash after starting the metro2033.exe i have managed to start the game on Radeon x1950 pro with Catalyst 10.2 and Win XP SP3.
I installed the ""Ati enbseries patch"" intended for the game ""Saboteur"" released by a Russian coder after reading about someone that did it on official Russian metro forum.

Same issue was with the Resident evil 5 which just would not run on that series of older Ati cards.

However the game is UNPLAYABLE even with the patch because of the black artefacts and squares and overlapping textures on large portions of the screen.

The framerate was high on low details and acceptable normal details in 1024x768 and even 1280 x 1024 (over 30ish on average) so card should be able to run the game fine.

So it is a driver issue after all. All we can do is wait for a fix be that from the developers, Ati or even that Russian guy who tweaked the Dx9 driver for RE5 and saboteur.

It's a shame that Ati drivers for ""legacy"" cards are now updated only 4 times a year.

As for the devs, if the game was not tested they should not have released those minimum system requirements. They could have just wrote ""Nvidia DX9 3.0 shader graphics card"" because the game runs fine on Nvidia equivalent older cards.

I hope this helped some people like me who just could not start the game no matter what they did."

,MINZEZ,2010-08-13T01:19Z,"@ lumberjacks
Good Game.txt is a trailer for the game I believe and SKIDROW.exe is probably their advertisement. Neither should be required to play the game. The txt is NOT required.

@ Bludeous_Whallean
I was wondering that too. It seemed fine before the update. Unless I am remembering playing the xbox version.

@ Markoni96
First. Make sure your computer can play the game.
Secondly. You don't copy the phys_x files to the game folder. You only install them to your computer.
Thirdly. Make sure you have installed the latest DirectX, PhysX and vcredist_x86. All of which can be downloaded from mirosoft apart from physx which is available from the nvidia website.

vcredist_x86: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=D5692CE4-ADAD-4000-ABFE-64628A267EF0&displaylang=en
DirectX: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=3b170b25-abab-4bc3-ae91-50ceb6d8fa8d
PhysX: http://www.nvidia.co.uk/object/physx-9.10.0513-driver-uk.html
Hope that helps"
