*************************************

Around the year 1000 AD, a warlike people, the Tchudes, roam in northern Scandinavia. 
As they brutally kill a Sami family in a remote area, including the parents and their little daughter, 
the families teenage son, Aigin, observes the slaughter. 
He manages to flee from these killers and reaches a camp with other Sami people, 
whose inhabitants are worried if he has been able to hide his track. 
Afraid of the murderous people, they decide to flee to the coast. 
The boy stays alone to avenge his families murder. 
Unfortunately, they get him before he can do anything, and force him to lead them to the other Samis. 
He guides them, but has a plan to destroy the barbarous people before reaching the camp...

**** EDIT 1 ****
I think the problem was too many DHT connections to my router, so the firewall kicked in and killed the seed.
Hopefully it's solved now, and last I checked there were 6 seeders.
There are no delay problems when you have 100% of the file.
I will continue to seed periodically, so stick around and wait for 100%  

**** EDIT 2  ****
I recommend you change torrent to:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5483693/Pathfinder.(Ofelas).1987.SWESUB
It has the same content, but more seeders than this one.
