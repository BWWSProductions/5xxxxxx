First movie adaption of Frankenstein.
You should check it out. Its one of if not the first horror movie.
It was made by Thomas Edison studios. Yes its that old.
There is sound but no dialogue of course.
Its an interesting movie, but very short (13 minutes)

Interesting fact:
*when it was released it was banned because of how scary it was
*For many years this was said to be a lost movie, like London after midnight so the fact that we have it on the internet is amazing.
