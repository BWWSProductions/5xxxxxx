,matelian,2010-03-17T17:35Z,does this one improve performance ?
,AZkiller7,2010-03-17T17:54Z,"i don't think it'll actually improve the performance, at least Patch_1 didn't !
btw, you can still gain some fps by disabling HBAO in the graphics setting menu ( HBAO = Horizon Based Ambient Occlusion ) ."

,kohroklantaislandkrabi,2010-03-23T07:33Z,How do i install this? i have unpacked the files now...
,suiggy,2010-04-03T15:48Z,"just downloaded the game, there patch1 and patch2.

can i just use patch 2 or do i need patch 1 first?"
,forb1dden,2010-04-19T06:48Z,"Patch 2 Replaces all the files from patch 1 and adds more. So if you use this one, patch 1 is useless i guess."
,suj999,2010-04-24T00:22Z,"guys now (since 21/04/2010) the game has updated to 529843, I don't think even this patch is working! Well not on my PC any way.

Anyway to stop the game updating itself?"
,suj999,2010-04-24T04:00Z,"ignore.. my comment.

The game works with 1st patch, but not this one.."
,eidisk,2010-09-23T15:06Z,"Hey, can anybody tell me what the hell is that problem when your cursor just goes up in the 1 st mission and can`t move it???"
,vincentdesrd,2010-10-13T07:53Z,"I don't know about the RELOADED version of the game but the Direct Play Rip doesn't work with this patch. 

It starts loading the mission then crashes to desktop."
,vincentdesrd,2010-10-13T07:58Z,"Nevermind my previous post, you just can't continue from a checkpoint from the previous version."
