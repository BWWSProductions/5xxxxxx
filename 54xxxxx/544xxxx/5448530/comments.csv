,rudi_k,2010-03-23T15:18Z,"Audio : 2.0DD (192kbps)
Video : NTSC (29,97fps), contrast/color not very good, seen better !

Aspect ratio : 16/9  (16 lines black top/bottom)
This aspect ratio is rather too wide.
Remember that 720/480 (1,5:1) is anamorph transformed to 16/9 (1,78:1) !!
The bmp might seem correctly on a PC but it will be stretched on your TV and (PC) DVD-Player !!

Please state which source is being used.
It's a shame that not the best source is being used since the colors are on other DVD-R's better !

Video/Audio untouched is of course not really thrue since the source is most likely an avi or a mp4 !!!
Or a custom DVD-R which also has used an avi / mp4 !!

Video 7, Audio 6"
