,NickManch,2011-01-04T08:18Z,"Am I correct in saying these are audio only sketches ... ie radio? I get a graphic up of the ""By the Sea"" programme they did,or whatever it was called but no video (ie TV) in any of the sketches. I've used Windows Media Player *and* VLC Media Player and that usually plays 99% of workable video. So am I right or are you still maintaining there's 'normal' TV/video on all these, rafiki101? ProFromDover, did you find video once you tried MPC? Just curious."
,torgman1,2011-08-19T19:31Z,These aren't video.  The files sizes are too small.
