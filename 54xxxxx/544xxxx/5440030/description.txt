Tapestries nature sounds collection - 3 albums

I've always been searching for sounds of nature without music, just great quality sounds.

So in 2001, I stumbled upon this unique and astonishing collection at the music store. It was exactly what I was searching for: great quality sounds, no music.

It consist of 3 compact disc, sold separately. Each of them have it's own theme:

1. A Day in the Wilderness : It's like being in a forest, sometimes near a river. All the way long sounds change from day to night, so you can enjoy a wild range of ambiances.

2. Songbirds in a Country Garden : The title say it all. It's like an afternoon relaxing outside in the garden, the sounds here mainly focused on birdsongs.

3. Thunder & Rain Storms : It's like being outside near a lake, a storm approaching; you can actually hear it gradually come until you are in the center of a great storm, until it gradually go away. A great experience!

Unfortunately, this collection is long out of print. Even worst, nothing can be found on the internet about them; this being very rare, this collection seems to be a rare gem. So I will share it so other nature sounds lovers can enjoy it as much I as do.

I did the best mp3 I could directly from my original CDs: constant bitrate 320kbps, stereo, high quality encoding (an option from my ripper that rip slower but makes better quality).

I include scans of the covers and back of the CDs (only Songbirds in a Country Garden cover is missing, but picture of it are shown on the covers of the other CDs)

So I hope you will enjoy!

Remember, there is absolutely NO MUSIC in these releases: JUST SOUNDS!
