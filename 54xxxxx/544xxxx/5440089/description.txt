Joseph McCabe vs. Christianity â€“ A Fighter for Freethought:


Joseph Martin McCabe (1867-1955) was an English writer and a former Priest of the Catholic Church. He received almost all of his education from different Catholic religious schools. In 1890 at the age of 23, he was ordained into the priesthood as Father Antony. In 1895, he was promoted to the position of the "Very Reverend" Father Antony.  

But the doubt was growing inside him. Finally, in 1896 at the age of 29, he lost his faith in Christianity completely and left the priesthood post. He turned to atheism, and became a champion of free thought. He spent the next sixty years exposing the errors, faults and corruptions of the Church and the Papal system.

It was reported that in his lifetime, McCabe authored about 250 books and delivered several thousand lectures. His admirers used to describe him as: A Fighter for Freethought.
