Sacramento alt-metal quintet the Deftones will release their sixth 

studio album this May, capping nearly four years of writing and 

recording that included a return to the drawing board after sudden 

tragedy hit the band.

In late 2008, as the group wrapped sessions on what was then slated to 

be their next release, Eros, bassist Chi Cheng was critically injured 

in a car crash, leaving him in a semi-conscious state (he remains in a 

Northern California hospital today). Last June, after more than six 

months in limbo, the Deftones shelved Eros -- which had become a 

constant reminder of Cheng's absence -- and started over.

"With everything we were going through, the Deftones needed to pour 

all of our thoughts, energy, and emotions into something newâ€¦ 

something more optimistic," singer Chino Moreno, 36, tells SPIN.com 

from his home in Los Angeles. "I couldn't tour behind a record with 

all these memories of Chi attached to it. Musically, it's something 

that we haven't done before," he explains. "It's veryâ€¦ sludgy, like a 

chainsaw-type of riff but very slow. I shouldn't say this, but it's 

clunkyâ€¦ in an awesome way."
