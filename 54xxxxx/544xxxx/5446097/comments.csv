THIS IS REAL!!

,borriffick,2010-03-20T11:41Z,"It's awesome to hear this before it comes out officially. Don't worry Deftones, I'll buy it in May, and if you come to my city I'll be there.
Here's an idea though...why not offer it on your website tomorrow? People are going to download it because they want it, they like your music. CDs are a dying part of the industry...who knows? Maybe CDs will drag the record industry out of business. "
,Bebras2,2010-03-21T15:10Z,thanks
,Jiggaa,2010-03-21T15:52Z,"yeah, i am also going to buy this cd to show my support, but i dont mind hearing it 2 months early :D It doesn't look like they are playing my state, so i may make trip out of state or country."
,kisayg,2010-03-22T09:53Z,i dont know what the fuck happened...but my computer was fine and i downloaded this torrent and then everything froze after it finished. now my computer doesn't even boot up or anything. i'm typing this on my friends computer. i'm guessing it gave me a virus. i use a mac so i'm not sure how that's even possible... this fucking destroyed my computer. thanks a fucking bunch. i don't recommend this torrent to anyone.
,rekit,2010-03-23T00:54Z,the real deal.  and holy shit this album is AWESOME.
,uberdoku,2010-03-23T01:25Z,"can't wait to hear this. thanks so much for the cut, mate. huge deftones fan, so despite buying at least one copy come May, hearing it early is a godsend. thanks again."
