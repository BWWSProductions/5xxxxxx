,Cajar_Queen,2010-03-20T16:02Z,Can someone pack these into .dbc (DCCache) files? A lot easier to install and handle that way. 
,Eittin,2010-03-21T04:21Z,How do I get these to work? I dl'd http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5273449/The_Sims__3_%5BComplete_Pack%5D_By__HamHam_  for my game and i cannot get them to load. I put them in the right download folder and do install it all goes well but none are really installed ;/  HELP PLZ!  TY!
,DestroxxBoom,2010-03-21T14:27Z,"I've noted the issue with these installing and will be putting in a FIXED version, apparently these were not decrapified or run through s3rc, and didn't find that out until they failed to install also for myself. So sit tight and I will edit this torrent with the PROPER AND NOT BROKEN files. :)"
,DestroxxBoom,2010-03-21T14:33Z,"Should be fixed now, any problems let me know!"
,Eittin,2010-03-21T15:07Z,re dling now hopefully it will work! thanks!
,GZ80,2010-03-22T00:49Z,"I've downloaded this twice now but when I install them into the game using the sims launcher, it says installation was a success but they still don't appear in the game.

Can somebody put these into DCCache format because that's the only way you'll get these working with the latest patch (3.1.7)"
,DestroxxBoom,2010-03-22T01:28Z,"I'm not sure if they will install for latest, I'm running 2.5.12 and they work just fine for me. These have been Decrapified, run through s3rc, if you want them in DCCache format, you may have to learn how to do it yourself."
,tllc,2010-03-22T02:50Z,"It still isn't working for me and I've got the latest version of the game (1.10.6.004001) that is in existence at this point. When I d/l this torrent the put its contents in the right spot it showed up in the d/l tab in The Sims 3 Game Launcher but when I installed all of it, It said ""Success!"" but it still showed up as not installed in the d/l tab and the stuff doesn't appear in-game."
,angiedoll,2010-03-22T08:25Z,I'm having the same problem as recent posters. They show up in launcher and don't install even though it said they successfully installed. i have latest patch with World Adventures. thanks
,TokenWGuy,2010-03-23T18:43Z,The latest patch blocks pirated store items. Downgrade for them to work.
,Talismn,2010-03-24T01:38Z,"I've had the same problem, but found a solution. Download and run ""3Viewer"", which is typically a Clean Install for the Sims 3 and far better than the Sims 3 Launcher that takes a freaken long time to load: http://forum.jfade.com/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=466

Regardless if you have the latest install, this program will install it. I hope this helps. 
"
,Cyanina,2010-03-24T04:56Z,"I upgraded my version just before adding the packages, and have the same problem as many others. Nothing comes up in the game. Not even the stuff I've bought. 

There is no way to downgrade the game, and I'm on a Mac. Repeat. Mac. So I can't find a patch that will let me upgrade till 1.2.7 if I reinstall the game... I have the retail version, and I've spent a lot of money at the store. But there is a limit. Any ideas? I really want to play this game, but I need atleast one update to be able, and the built-in updater gives you the latest one automaticly. "
,Cyanina,2010-03-24T05:34Z,"And 3Viewer does not work on Mac. There is supposed to be a tutorial on SimsTools, but the site is closed. I would convert these into DCCache, but I don't even know what that is. So I hope someone else takes the challenge. :)"
,Talismn,2010-03-24T07:46Z,"@Cyanina: Did you click on the ""Sims3PackViewer.jar"" file within 3Viewer? Because that's the file you're suppose to click on in order to operate it within the Mac. "
,Cyanina,2010-03-24T07:47Z,"But if anyone has Java 1.6 on their Mac, you should be able to use the 3Viewer, even though some say that the store items don't install. 

Here's the guide:

Download 3Viewer

Game save: Macintosh HD/Users/Your user name/Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/
Game data: Macintosh HD/Applications/The Sims 3.localized

Then 3Viewer creates a Mods folder and a Resource.cfg file in the folder where the Sims 3 application is located.

You then need to manually move these two items to where they need to be. To do this ctrl-click (or right-click) on the actual The Sims 3 app. and you will see in the drop-down menu Show Package Contents. Select this and an new window will open. Proceed to open the windows: Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Program Files/Electronic Arts/The Sims 3/ and drag the Mods folder and the Resource.cfg that 3Browser created file into this burried ""The Sims 3"" folder.

It's supposed to work. But I have only Java 1.5."
,Cyanina,2010-03-24T07:51Z,"I did. But realised that the latest version needs to have java 1.6 installed. And on my old Mac, that is a lot of messing with terminal. If anyone else makes it work, I might try though. "
,Talismn,2010-03-24T08:02Z,"@Cyanina: Yeah 3Viewer does require that you should have the latest Java, because the program itself runs off of it from what it seemed, but clearly worth operating other than the Sims 3 Launcher. It should only be a cakewalk for you and just need to go to the java website and download the latest version. It should apply for even older versions of Mac Computers."
,Cyanina,2010-03-24T08:42Z,"Sadly not. Latest version is 1.5. I think you can get 1.6 if you have snowtiger, and a better computer than me. But I have to manually programme the latest version into my machine, make paths and write code and I'm terrified of programming. I've messed up waaaaay to many times. "
,ll1001,2010-03-24T16:12Z,"i currently using the 3viewer to install the CC, everything work fine except the riverview. Any suggestion how to install this CC?"
,Talismn,2010-03-24T22:54Z,"@Cyanina: I've been doing some research on Java for the Mac, and I do believe 1.6 is out for it, but at the Apple Website instead of the Java Website, so I would look into that and see if that can solve the issue hopefully.

@ll1001: This can work either way whether if you have the legit version of Sims 3 or not. I've had the same problem and I have the legit version, so all you have to do is go to the Sims 3 website and just download it from there and have the Sims 3 Launcher install it, instead of the 3Viewer if it's not installing it. If you don;t have an account, it's free, so you can sign up and download it regardless, you just can get stuff from the Store, but you can get stuff from the Exchange. "
,Imoen7788,2010-03-25T11:01Z,"I was so happy for this GREAT torrent but unfortionately i'm having the same problem as the rest of u. The launcher says the installation was a success but they don't appear in the game.

So i downloaded the 3Viewer by TALISMN, but please Talismn, how does it work?? 
I right click on ""50s full set"" and choose ""open with 3Viewer"". Then i click the ""install"" button. But everytime i get the following message: ""An error occured during installation. Please check the bug logger to find out what went wrong"".

I've got Windows Vista and the original Sims3 game.

Thanks for any help in this matter as i really, really, REALLY want this one to work!"
,Cyanina,2010-03-25T12:49Z,"@Talismn. Yup, there is 1.6 java for Mac, but you need a Intel Core Duo 2 prosessor with 64-bit, mine is Intel Core Duo 32-bit. There is a way to install soylatte 1.6 for my machine, but it has to be programmed through terminal and X11, and I haven't managed it yet. Hopefully I will. There was a new update last night on my Sims 3, I hope this doesn't effect 3Viewer, if I finally get it to work. 

@Imoen7788 I had the same problem, but I have the java problem as well. Check that you have all the requirements. And read or post at this forum: http://forum.jfade.com/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=466 They should be able to help. "
,Talismn,2010-03-25T14:36Z,"@Imoen7788: You don't right click on the Sims 3 Packs at all. Run the program first, it'll ask you some steps as to where your game is, and where your saves. It'll then create the Mods Folder for you, and even a Resource file in case you don't have one. If you aready have a Resource file, you can just skip it, and open the 50's Full Set from there, or any other packs and just click the big blue install button. It should work then. Remember not to right click and chooser open by 3Viewer, you'll have to open 3Viewer itself for the packs to install properly

@Cyanina: I honestly didn't know that x.x;;; I didn't think that Java had so much requirements and thought it was just a software any computer could install. "
,Imoen7788,2010-03-25T16:46Z,"Thanks guys for your replies!!

Ok so i've clicked ""file"" in the 3Viewer and then ""open"" and then ""50s full set"". But i get following error message: 

""An error occured during installation. Please check the bug logger to find out what went wrong"".

And when i do that i get this message:

""The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect"".

What can i do about this? I get the same message for every sim3 pack.

By the way, i've got Java version 6 Update 18."
,Talismn,2010-03-25T21:04Z,"@Imoen7788: Okay I believe that the reason you're getting these errors, is because your file directories are wrong. When you first start 3Viewer after downloading it, it'll ask you where your Game Saves are, which is in your ""Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3"". Then it'll ask you where the game itself is which is most likely be ""Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3"".

Now, delete the entire folder of 3Viewer, since it's not really a Install Process you go through. Re-Download 3Viewer and open it up again and make sure that you set the 2 directories right, which are the examples I gave you. If you installed the Sims 3 on a different drive, then make sure 3Viewer knows that directory, because it will create the Mods Folder and the Recourse File for you. Make sure that you tell it to create a back up file that places the package within the Downloads folder in the ""Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Downloads"".

Once you have that straightened out, every thing should be fine, because what it does is that 3Viewer extracts the Packages into the Package Folder within the Mods Folder and the original file itself within the Downloads folder. 

In addition make sure you have the latest updates for the Sims 3, because it works even with the latest updates and make sure you have Java 1.6 or the latest version. 

Hope this helps out. "
,Imoen7788,2010-03-26T13:37Z,"Thank u Talismn for all your help!! I've done exactly as u said and it seems to work (got msg that it was successful).
BUT for some reason my game won't start anymore! The screen goes black and then back to normal.
I'll have to look into what's wrong. But thanks again for your time!"
,dark_isle,2010-03-26T13:53Z,What is up with these store items that keeps bugging the game and slows it down to a crawl? Why do I even bother. EA can't do anything right. 
,Chinadian,2010-03-30T06:37Z,"I had *SOME* success installing some of the sims3pack files. What I did was this:

1. Install Sim 3 using the torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5022393/The_Sims_3_-_Razor1911_Final_MAXSPEED

2. Copy the files in this torrent to X:\Users\\My Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Downloads

3. Start the Sims 3 Launcher, click ""Downloads"", ""Select All"", then ""Install"".

If I click ""Installed Content"" I can see that most items are installed while others are not even though the launcher said they were.

4. Install World Adventures using the torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5168507/The_Sims_3_World_Adventures-RELOADED

5. Repeat step 3 hoping the items not installed will be installed.

6. Install High-End Loft Stuff using the torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5329998/The.Sims.3.High.End.Loft.Stuff-ViTALiTY

7. Repeat step 3 hoping the items not installed will be installed.

8. Click ""Game Updates"" then patch the game to the most recent version.

9. Repeat step 3 hoping any items still not installed will finally be installed.

I then start the game, but I don't see Riverview even though the Launcher said it was installed. Also, some of the items can not be installed because the Launcher says the game has to be updated even though it is the most recent version (3.2.8).

I will now try to install everything using The 3Viewer."
,Chinadian,2010-03-30T17:30Z,"http://www.modthesims.info/showthread.php?t=392476

1.82 was an attempt to thwart custom content sharing. Unfortunately, the code that accompanies the item conflicts with the game especially if the game is an older version that has been patched. Ex:1.06 to 1.4 to 1.6 to 1.7 etc. The point of including a validation binary was to guarentee that objects would only work that were purchased directly from the EA store. Unfortaunate side effect was that any games that had mods or pirated software, awsomemod, a borrowed or shared texture or anything downloaded from a community site messed up a good previously working game. What galls me is I spoke to a coder and compiler who works a EA I met at a New Years party and he explained to me that it is all a big joke at EA about the Sims game. To respect his privacy, I told him I would not reveal who he was so he did tell me a few other things. They are going to make the game and patching mandatory to run the game, so that any custom content must be bought from EA, smart business profits, dumb for the developing community. Which means, if you run the Sims3 and are conected to the internet, you will get a notice that the game needs to be patched or it will not launch. So here's what I make of this, play the game as made by EA, buy there stuff if you like it, don't mess around with mods and third party stuff as it effects the next patch that will block some other work around to all this. It seems to me that this video game company is more invested in protecting its intellectual property than providing a good stable game. It's in their right to do so, read your EULA, it is also your right not to buy their games or expansion packs or whatevere they produce if you don't like the way they code their software."
,Chinadian,2010-03-30T18:54Z,"Just to be clear, my last comment was quoted from the link. :-)"
,SubGum,2010-03-31T03:51Z,"@Chinadian, did you have any success with 3Viewer?

Also, what's the latest version that DOESN'T screw up all these items for someone running TS3:HELS?"
,SubGum,2010-03-31T05:02Z,"Actually, what I really want to ask is:
How are people installing this successfully?

I played TS3 when it first came out, and installed the 1st ""TS3 Store"" torrent that was released with no problems using the launcher.

Now I've decided to play some more, but now have the 2 expansion packs installed as well, and  installing this torrent's items using the TS3 launcher doesn't seem to be putting them in the game.

So once again:
How are people installing this successfully?"
,Chinadian,2010-03-31T05:10Z,"@SubGum, I played around with it last night but still couldn't get the Riverview to show up.

I did another install today and had NIS 2010 blocked all 3 instances of S3Launcher.exe. Again, I tried to install the store items each and every time after installing the main program, World Adventures, and High-End Loft Stuff. Other than 2 or 3 files, everything installed but when I went to play the game, Riverview was not there again. Note: I did not patch The Sims 3 this time.

According to http://www.modthesims.info/showthread.php?t=392476 says, it would seem that things stop working once HELS is installed.

I have now come to the conclusion that either you play without the items from this torrent, or without the expansions -- or at least without HELS."
,SubGum,2010-03-31T06:54Z,"Oh, so it's specifically HELS that screw it al up, eh?
Well it's good to know exactly what is causing it.  I hear that HELS isn't that great anyways...

Thanks for the reply."
,SubGum,2010-04-02T05:16Z,"Well, I'm stubborn and refused to accept that all this couldn't work with HELS and the latest patches, so I did some digging and got it all working.  

First I installed TS3 and WA, then installed all of the content from this torrent using the launcher.

Then I installed HELS, and updated the game to the most recent version using the EA Installer/Launcher.

Then I followed the ""more detailed instructions"" here:
http://www.modthesims.info/showthread.php?t=382520#Missing

Now everything works just fine.  All the store content, including Riverview, as well as HELS.  And it hasn't slowed down my game like using the .package install method did.

Hopefully this helps some of the rest of you! :D

Cheers."
,DumpyFrog,2010-04-12T21:35Z,"Before I download and attempt to install...just wondering if anyone has successfully gotten this to install?

Thanks in advance!"
,SubGum,2010-04-13T01:24Z,"@DumpyFrog
All it takes is reading a few posts before you post.
Yes, it installs and works perfectly."
,DumpyFrog,2010-04-13T09:25Z,Okay cool! Will try! Thanks!!!
,SubGum,2010-05-02T09:31Z,"@Stormflower, don't use 3viewer.  It'll only slow down your game a ton and isn't a very clean way to install all of this content.

Follow the step-by-step instruction I posted awhile back 4 posts above yours and you'll get it working just fine."
,wallawalla94,2010-05-04T19:34Z,"i really don't get how i must do it? with ""3viewer"" or with something else, plz help! :s"
,Taught,2010-05-05T04:30Z,"Well... I'll write my instructions for installing these store items. (This is mainly for people who can't get it working).

1. Do a clean installation The Sims 3. And for those of you who have downloaded the game instead of purchasing the game, DON'T USE ANY CRACKS FOR THE GAME YET.

Note: Install the Electronic Arts Download Manager if you want (EADM helps you to update and patch the game.)
And also don't run the game after installation.

2. Install World Adventures (if you have it). (Again, download EA Download Manager if you want). Don't apply any cracks yet.

3. For those of you who don't know how to install custom Sims 3 content, follow these instructions:

all the files in this torrent (except for the Read Me file) go to 

Documents>Electronic Arts>The Sims 3>Downloads

and if you don't have those folders, make them.

Now COPY the .package files from this torrent and paste/put them in

Program Files>Electronic Arts>The Sims 3>Mods>Packages

again, if you don't have the Mods & Packages folder, create them.

Now create a new text document (recommend using notepad) and copy and paste this into it:

Priority 500
PackedFile Mods/Packages/*.package
PackedFile Mods/Packages/*/*.package
PackedFile Mods/Packages/*/*/*.package
PackedFile Mods/Packages/*/*/*/*.package
PackedFile Mods/Packages/*/*/*/*/.package

Now save it as Resources.cfg and put it in your main Sims 3 folder (Program Files>Electronic Arts>The Sims 3)

4. Now open up your Sims 3 Launcher and if it asks you if you want to update your game, click on NO. Click on ""Downloads"" on the left side column. Now make sure you're under the ""All"" tab. Wait until all the content are done loading then click ""Select All"" (if you want ALL the content from this torrent) and then click on install on the bottom of the launcher. Now just wait until all the custom content are finished.

5. Now exit the launcher and install High End Loft Stuff if you have it. Again, install EADM if you want it. And wait until it's finished instlaling.

6. Now if you want the latest version for your game, open up your Sims 3 Launcher by clicking on 1 of the Sims 3 shortcuts on your desktop (or wherever your Sims 3 launchers are) and if it asks if you want to update your game, click YES. If it doesn't ask that, click on Game Updates on the left and check the boxes for the updates that are available and click ""Update Now"".

7. Now once the updates and patches are done, APPLY ALL THE CRACKS FOR EACH GAME (The Main Sims 3, WA, and HELS cracks) if you have downloaded them off of torrent sites.

8. Now open/run the game by either using the launcher or the .exe in 1 of The Sims 3, WA, or HELS folder.

Enjoy!

BTW... if you get crashes while playing the game, BLAME EA!!!!!"
,Mar_1838,2010-05-11T18:42Z,"Is it possible to update a torrent file once it has been uploaded? I noticed that the newer sets like Faerie Folk Life and Hacienda Luxury have been left out, probably because EA hadn't released them yet."
,sf2000,2010-05-12T17:46Z,"Try this:

1. Place the store objects into you Documents/sims3/Downloads-Folder.

2. Launch the Launcher.

3. Choose the downloads you want to include in your game and install them.

3. YES, they are not installed, but if you look under document/sims3/DCBackup, you'll notice lots and lots of PACKAGE-files. Those are the ""mod""-version of the Store-objects

4. So take them and include them in your mods-folder. If you don't know how to include mods into sims 3, ask.

5. You have the store-objects in your game. The first time you start the game will take some time, well- you have many, many mods now, so be patient.



DON't do this with Riverview. Or the world will explode. Really! Don't."
