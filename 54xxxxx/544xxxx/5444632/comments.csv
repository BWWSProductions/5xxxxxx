,subline608,2010-03-19T13:15Z,"Do you think you could do this movie Gridlock'd (1997) avi, thanks"
,yoyo1234,2010-07-04T04:32Z,"Don't even bother downloading this is you don't speak Japanese.  These are honestly the worst subs I've ever seen.

It's not even broken English where you can even understand what's going on.  It's like someone just translated one word and then the next, in the order they come in Japanese, and the result is pure gibberish.

There's literally no difference between having these subs and not having them.

How the guy that translated this thought he spoke English well enough to do it I'll never know.  Could have run it through some online translator and probably come out better.

Thanks for wasting my time."
