5kb/sec really?!?!?

Also what are the instructions for burning? Just burn the folder to a DVD and find the game in the game library? Will this still work on consoles banned from live? "
,Strikefear13,2010-03-19T05:42Z,Also? Google it.
,ocelotshi,2010-03-19T10:56Z,It is stopping at 85%!
,john5246,2010-03-19T11:44Z,"Must be some kind of sick joke because it won't unrar

I tried ""2008-2010"" (with a dash) and

""2008 2010"" (with a space inbetween)

It won't work. Thanks for putting a password in it faggot."

,john5246,2010-03-19T12:46Z,"1. Unrar using the password in the txt file
2. Use image burn to write ""files/Folder to disk""
3 Use a blank dvd, burn it
4. Insert into xbox 360
5. It will say ""mixed media disc""
6. Go to ""game library"" icon
7. You'll find it here (unless you're banned from XBL like me and your console functionality is disabled)

FUCK you MS"

,kirre35,2010-03-20T01:16Z,SHORTLY SAID: Burn the Content map to a DVD or DL disc.

,Neuro_Belmont,2010-03-20T03:53Z,"Guys, I can't get this to work. I tried it twice with Toast Titanium, and Disk Utility won't work (Mac). Do I have to use image burn, or can it be any program? Also, which file do I select to burn? "
,Yabab,2010-03-20T04:51Z,"Anyone else having an issue in the Third Echelon cutscene, where the games keeps going on until the control scheme appears on screen and the hud comes on before the cutscene's actually finished?"
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-03-20T05:07Z,"What a waste of time. I wasted 6 DVDs using image burn, and did all of this and it didn't work. 

1. Unrar using the password in the txt file
2. Use image burn to write ""files/Folder to disk""
3 Use a blank dvd, burn it
4. Insert into xbox 360
5. It will say ""mixed media disc""
6. Go to ""game library"" icon
7. You'll find it here (unless you're banned from XBL like me and your console functionality is disabled)

I also tried burning the source file, and I also tried burning it from the content folder. Shows up as mixed media, but under my games tab it doesn't say demos or SC Conviction.

What's wrong?"
,xetrez,2010-03-21T20:38Z,"Neuro_Belmont, you noob. You know you could use a rewritable DVD to burn it, so in essence you don't need to waste even a single DVD.

Burn the ""contents"" folder, not the file itself."
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-03-22T12:17Z,"If you weren't a noob at reading you can see that I tried burning the contents folder in image burn. Several times. And how am I supposed to burn it on a rewritable DVD when I have none? DVDs are a dime a dozen anyway, so I don't really care. I would if they were dual layers though. And when there was a demo for RE5, I had no problems whatsoever with a DVD."
,Cold71,2010-03-27T23:23Z,any way to play this on a banned console?
,shaffu007,2010-03-31T20:47Z,burned n playin nw vry short demo bt its worth

,shaffu007,2010-04-05T08:16Z,demo was short bt awsum.....
,john5246,2010-04-09T07:05Z,"***DASHBOARD UPDATE FROM MS enables your HDD again!



However, I just wasted another disc on this, when you're banned the demo's tab doesn't show up so you're still screwed from playing demos. But in a few days I'll have the entire game. So it looks like I'll be getting the last laugh MS. ha ha ha ha ha!"
