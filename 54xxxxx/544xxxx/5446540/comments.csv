,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-20T08:16Z,I'm surprise Rush would post this evidence on his website...END
,Johannes58,2010-03-20T08:43Z,seems to me the evidence points to the White house... and the kool aid the Dems have been smoking... 
,koniev,2010-03-20T11:05Z,thx muchos
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-20T15:26Z,"""kool aid the Dems have been smoking"" you said...First of all you do not smoke kool aid...You drink it...Second, Dumbo never denies the claims, he just says the other side is doing it too...""I think this is poisonous to have everybody just drill daily upon the irrationality of the extremes."", Roy Romer...""seems to me the evidence points to the White house"" you said...If your only defense is to say that the other side threw dirt too is no defense at all...Johannes58, please stop with your lame arguments...I will bury you and your arguments...END"
,booboo332,2010-03-20T22:50Z,"Tricky - ""Johannes58, please stop with your lame arguments...I will bury you and your arguments""  

Funny how you have failed to refute his first.  Funnier still is how you keep coming back to puff your chest and talk shit.

No one takes you seriously and if I were a liberal, I would want you to shut up.  Since I am not, I encourage you to keep up your delusion and ineffectual ranting."
,triggerpuller,2010-03-22T03:03Z,DITTO'S BOOBOO.  Tricky's short on facts and long on progressive speaking points. Another progressive parrot.
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-22T04:45Z,Health Care PASSES!!! How is that hope he FAILS thing working for you?...END
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-22T05:01Z,"""Funny how you have failed to refute his first."" you said...Rush Limbaugh posted  the comment and refuted it without any evidence...Will Rush Limbaugh get fired for not being able to stop Obama...I would fire his ASS"
,booboo332,2010-03-22T08:30Z,"You nailed it, triggerpuller.  Bwaaak! Tricky wanna cracker.

Tricky, I meant his first comment that you responded with the arrogant ""Oh wow Johannes58 next you will tell that the world is round not flat"" nonsense.  Honest mistake, I suppose.

Tricky - ""Health Care PASSES!!! How is that hope he FAILS thing working for you?"" 

Emotional much?  ""Hope is not a strategy."" - Mistress of the lockbox

tricky - ""Will Rush Limbaugh get fired for not being able to stop Obama...I would fire his ASS""

Again with the drama?  Only if people were to stop listening to him, would he'd be essentially ""fired"".  Considering that even you admit to listening to him regularly, it is a highly unlikely.

You are such a sad case.  Even when you get what you want, you are still bitter and hateful."

HealthCare for Most...bugaboo are you going to says I was pumping my chest again?..Look how I pull bugaboo strings when said ""Health Care PASSES!!! How is that hope he FAILS thing working for you?"" Bugaboo you and your republican friends have LOST...Just admit defeat and we can move along...END"

,BarrySoetoro,2010-03-22T20:01Z,"Trickdaddy uses ""END"" in an attempt to shut down debate... it's as simple as that. He doesn't realize it makes him look like an ignorant fool.

Also, if he defines ""victory"" as the ramming through of massive government takeover against the will of the majority of people... well... what does that say?"
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-23T11:34Z,"""Trickdaddy uses ""END"" in an attempt to shut down debate"" you said...What the hell are you talking about? I use END the same way you use periods to end a sentence...""Also, if he defines ""victory"" as the ramming through of massive government takeover against the will of the majority of people... well... what does that say?"" you said...Over one year ago Rush Limbaugh said he wanted Obama to FAIL...And he declared that HealthCare was the measuring stick...Well HealthCare has passed so this is a Victory whether you want to admit it or not...END"
,booboo332,2010-03-23T20:41Z,Maybe this clown really is smoking something.
