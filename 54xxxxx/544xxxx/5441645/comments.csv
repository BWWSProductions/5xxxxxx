,Izackn,2010-09-11T00:33Z,"Well, this is depressing. Your torrent works fine as far as I can tell, but Vista (home premium, x64) won't allow me to run the game, cracked or otherwise. It tells me that Data Execution Prevention has stopped the program because for whatever reason it thinks it's dangerous. It tells me I can add an exception just for this program, so I try it and IT TELLS ME I CAN'T. FUCK. This is true for all versions of the game, including the original fucking CD which I went and bought because no downloads worked. Thanks a lot, Microsoft.

Sorry for the rant. Again, your torrent is fine; I'm just fed up with Vista's neverending bullshit.
Over and out."

,Hiram_2010,2011-03-01T23:17Z,"Don't try and pass this off as an iso. It's in the CCD format, or it has the img file extension as most people would know."
,d4rknet,2011-03-14T16:13Z,"For Windows 7 65-Bit
1. Download this torrent
2. Install HomeWorld 2
3. Install the included 1.1 update
4. Do NOT use the included crack. Instead, get the German No-CD Executable. Google ""Homeworld 2 german exe"". It is the GameCopyWorld result.
5. Have fun"
