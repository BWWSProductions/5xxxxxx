Installation Notes:


***  

original nocd crack is no longer working, so I included the v1.1 crack I used to get it working, but original crack is still included. Nothing was removed or added to the .ISO. Just a guide, some mods & a better crack & a key was included, as well as my personal seal of tested approval.  

***

Step 1. Burn or mount the CD
Step 2. Install the game(do not register online).
When your asked for a serial key, use 

cd key: ****-****-****-****-****(edited for public view, can't allow the key to get black listed).

Step 3. Update the game with the update patch homeworld 2 update V 1.1

**Patch Install Guide***

DO NOT CRACK THE GAME YET!! Update patch 1st!

right click, open. 
Click run. 

You will see a window that reads

"You are about to update Homeworld2 v1.0 to v1.1. Please ensure that you have Admin privileges before proceeding with the installation". 

Click OK. Now hit Next. Next. Next. Next. 
Homeworld2 V1.1 Patch Installed sucessfully.
Click OK.


Step 4. Locate the folder called crack. 
Step 5. Copy & paste & replace existing file. Copy crack from cd paste to 

C:Program FilesSierraHomeworld2BinRelease

Step 6. Run the game.

If you get an error that reads Cannot find import DDL may be missing, corrupt, or wrong version File "luaconfig.ddl", function">SaveAll@LuaConfig@QAEX_N@Z"(error 6),
which is reported by some users, myself included, simply replace the luaconfig.dll file with the one in the G.W.T.G  folder.

Notes:  I am not the cracker of this game, but I did trouble shoot alot for some friends & located a working crack file to make the game working again.

eviljedi's warlord mod is included, I refer you to the googling of "Homeword 2 warlord mods for help forum, as them guys really got some good help threads up.
