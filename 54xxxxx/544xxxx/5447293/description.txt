Aired 19.03.2010

Reason for propering the repack- 
repeating footage at 17:00 until 18:00 (originally from 15:50)

Now, what XIIMERSE left out of their reason for repacking was
that their original contained 121.5mb of junk data.
The video was only 552mb and the audio 73mb (total 625mb.)

ALL of their releases are fluffed/padded/restricted to achieve 
a specific size regardless of actual encoded video and audio 
size. That is why all their releases of a particular size are 
within 2kb of each other. This circumvents over/under size 
rules. It also allows them to mux/rar/spread their pre as the 
video is uploading. The rar headers have already been set for 
their padded/restricted final size (just like their xvids.) 

We will not be lame and go back and proper all of their recent
releases like some groups might.

Now children, take your shitty coder and head back to school 
until you figure out how to encode.

Enjoy :)
