Wikipedia - Greatest Hits was the first "greatest hits" collection singer Jody Watley. Executive-produced by Watley herself, the album highlighted her MCA years (1987-1994), and contained all of her well-known pop hits, among them "Looking For a New Love", "Real Love" and "Everything"; two of Watley's classics, " "Don't You Want Me" and "Some Kind of Lover", were presented in their more familiar remixed forms. Additionally, Watley (who compiled the collection with Andy McKaie) took care to include lesser-known (but equally iconic) songs like "Still a Thrill" and "Most of All".
