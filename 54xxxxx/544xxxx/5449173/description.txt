     "I get a lot of emails asking me how I produce my media test         
      graphs and where do I find the drives and media information.        
                                                                          
        Well the answer is DVDInfoPro produced by Nic Wilson.             
                                                                          
    This program provides me with all the drive information, media        
     information and also produces all the graphs & charts I need to      
     carry out my reviews. It has been so popular as late that their      
       server had been overloaded and downloads were not possible.        
                                                                          
     This is such an excellent diagnostic program and I have been         
    happy to be involved in its testing during the development stages"

      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      
      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
