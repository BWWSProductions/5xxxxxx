,KentuckyFakeChicken,2010-04-12T02:54Z,"What the hell is wrong with you people? So what it's rar'd?
 You can get a good show for free, it takes seconds to download, and it takes about half a minute to unrar and that's it. And did I even mention the superb file size/quality ratio? Why don't you try doing that?
I don't even know why I get so worked up about people like yourselves."

,ITRUN,2010-05-29T00:13Z,"Fuck you and your RAR shit! Why bother fucking raring when it makes NO difference what-so-ever! 
Fuck you CUNT"
,Colganraz,2010-08-18T14:42Z,RAR compresses files so we can download quicker and easier get winrar n00bs and dont complain about shit thats bootlegged!
,Amirul,2010-08-18T23:11Z,"@ITRUN
