,King_Noobington,2010-03-20T04:42Z,WTF is DS-Xtreme?  Will this work on no$gba & NDS?
,Tehremos,2010-03-20T13:59Z,Do these freeze much like all the other roms of this game?
,Aypolo,2010-03-20T14:57Z,"They are .nds files. (Roms) as downloaded from any other website.
They work with No$Gba, Ds-X, ect...
Ds-Xtreme is a flashcart. Quite nice I might add. 
A tad expensive though.

,judokid3000,2010-03-20T15:09Z,"better not download this one.

,Aypolo,2010-03-20T19:54Z,@Grindpower: What's the exact error?
,Grindpower,2010-03-20T22:55Z,It just won't let me save on pokemon heart gold and soul silver i just told you in my last comment what it said.
,gusiskirby,2010-03-21T00:00Z,"This is the first brand new game I have actually paid for since Twilight Princess. I sure am proud of it. Anyway, that's how good I think this game is. Enjoy it pirates!"
,billy1989,2010-03-21T14:13Z,"These mite work on this DS-Xtreme flashcart, but this does NOT work on the R4 card that i have. it freezes after you talk with Pro. oak. Hope a good copy comes out soon."
,billy1989,2010-03-21T14:35Z,This also does NOT work on NO$GBA. same place black screen.
,billy1989,2010-03-21T15:13Z,"If you are suffering from black screen freezes while playing on no$gba emulator, particularly at the beginning the game after your character shrinks, follow these simple steps to fix:

Please note that I have only done this in Heart Gold version, I do not know if it will or won't work in Soul Silver.

1. Open your game in no$gba emulator normally.

2. Click the ""Utility"" drop-down and select ""Cheats"" from that menu.

3. Select the ""Add New"" button in the bottom left corner on the new window that has popped up.

4. Copy and paste the following code into the text area of the cheat window.

020DE16C E1A00000
020D3FA8 E1A00000

5. Before click okay, be sure that ""Action Replay DS"" is checked at the bottom of the window, and ""RAW"" is checkmarked underneath the okay and cancel buttons. Once you are sure of the proper settings, click okay. The name of the code does not matter.

6. Double click the code title in the cheats window to enable it. To make sure it is enabled, look for a check mark next to it.

As long as this code is activated, you will not have any black screens while starting your game or loading a saved game. You can activate and deactiviate it whenever you want.

Please note that this code ONLY fixes black screens while starting a game or loading saved games. Your game is still vulnerable to freezes, crashes, the works. My only advice is to save often, and close out of the emulator completely after each save. If you save, and then your emulator crashes before you exit the emulator completely, your data will be lost. 

Thanks to swayzterbul"
,Grindpower,2010-03-21T21:03Z,save regularly? I can't!
,pERSIANplayer25,2010-03-22T05:10Z,"so every time i get ina battle the game freezes and ive reset it about 10x

,pERSIANplayer25,2010-03-24T02:46Z,"so i have entered the code and still my game freezes after i beat a wild pokemon no matter how many times i restart it, can someone please give me some advice?"
,morg-fire,2010-04-18T08:30Z,still waiting for a ver. that won't freeze after 5 mins of play

,Exodiaj,2010-10-01T22:58Z,Freezes when you get to the elder at the Sprout tower.
,stan0slash,2010-11-20T22:58Z,"Downloaded this cause I don't have my DS with me anymore.
Currently playing it through a desmume but it freezes whenever I get to the part where Lyra is about to show me how to catch a Pokemon...
PLEASE HELP."
,Vohx,2011-02-16T21:58Z,"just thought i would verify for you, the cheat does work on silver."
,Vohx,2011-02-16T22:08Z,"also, thanks for the download, haha. sorry, a bit spacey today. its a great working one. with silver, it did have a glitch moment when you first walk out of your house and the wind blows, all the people turned into black blocks until i went back into a building."
,ElDigato,2011-03-03T10:13Z,"When playing either of these games you may normally get stuck after typing in your name, but some people have found a way to bypass this.

Once you start up the game on no$GBA, immediately click Utilities>Cheats>Add New and put in this code:
020DD9DC E1A00000
Name it whatever you want but make sure you make it an Action Replay code.

That should fix it so you can get past the black screen after naming yourself but if it still doesn't work, try the same thing with this code:
020DD9E4 E1A00000

If it still doesn't work then I'm very sorry but I have no further way of helping you.

Thanks to NintendoWalkthroughDude for showing me where this code was and for the people who figured this out."
,XxLanexX,2011-03-21T00:22Z,Everything is legit and works correctly after entering the code thus far. Thanks for the upload! 
,XxLanexX,2011-03-21T03:16Z,"OKAY. So now I'm having one minor problem.
It. Does. Not. Save."
,Wahoos88,2011-07-02T02:01Z,stops saving once u get to route 35

,swagie,2011-12-05T16:14Z,try the DESMUME Emulator.
,MovieFreakPiraye,2012-01-24T16:29Z,"Kept Crashing for me, So basically Every 10 minutes Save and close game and Re Open and you should be right, hopefully but the fact it deletes your save folder when it crashes is just Ridiculous >_< and Frustrated me to the point of basically saying, Well if they can crack PC Games and not these Nintendo must be doing something right and ill just buy the fucker for my DS :P
But Thanks Regardless and yeah i did read your Description and new this would probably Happen if only i could find Rudolphs Crash fix made for No$gba and then get a Japanese Rom and Put the English Language Patch Id Have no AP, And No Crashes or bugs "
,11770,2012-02-06T07:27Z,this game still crashes @ the gym leader in azaleaf or whatever it is
