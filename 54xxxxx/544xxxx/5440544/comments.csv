,michan123,2010-03-18T12:12Z,any idea about how many gameplay hours u can get out of this game?
,Bujaaa,2010-03-18T12:31Z,It's RF (region free). And you can play this game untill you get bored of it since it's open world. :)

,Masti6,2010-03-18T20:25Z,So I just burn the .ISO file to any DVD and it works on Xbox without any mods etc?
,Liam_2010,2010-03-18T23:11Z,yes yes yes yes yes
,splatter7,2010-03-19T04:34Z,just finished burning this and it doesn't work...sigh
,superbanned,2010-03-19T17:37Z,"For all wanting to know about X360 burning and flashing, type ixtreme on google and you'll find out. 
To play this game, you need a flashed x360 for pre Sep,2009 consoles, and for post sep2009, you'll need a J-TAGGED console in most cases. 

hope that helps. And remember, you need to burn it using software like ImgBurn by selecting the .dvd file and NOT the iso file on a DOUBLE LAYER DVD+R"
,slitoke,2010-03-19T20:24Z,"Can someone please answer this question?
I have a modded x360 with 1.6 ixtreme and an NOT banned from Live yet. This game is wave 4 and cant play it on my 1.6 firmware. 
Would a burned activate.iso help me play the wave 4, should i patch it to wave 3 then play it or does someone have a better solution to my detour
plz plz i need help"
,luxusmuxus,2010-03-20T00:25Z,DONT play any patched game if you dont wanna get banned.not even offline
,JTAGpope,2010-03-20T03:00Z,IF YOU DONT GO ONLINE LOOK INTO GETTING A JTAG'd XBOX 360. You dont have to burn the games to a disc you can just put it onto a Memory Stick and play it from there. No disc Needed!
,SOTBMP,2010-03-20T11:09Z,"Hi everyone!

If you probably know, there is an addon pack for this game. It's called ""Black Market Chaos Pack"".

Here you have visualization of it:
http://gamerinvestments.com/video-game-stocks/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/just-cause-2-uk-limited-edition-reveal-7.jpg

And now - my question:  do you have code to unlock this bonus pack?"
,BigDet,2010-03-20T19:21Z,Need more seeders it's a slow download
,JTyler1990,2010-03-21T04:07Z,This doesnt pass through abgx360 either!! seems every game soloestreno do do not pass checks!! same as there metro 2033!
,JTAGpope,2010-03-21T20:05Z,I dunno who just started seeding but I Love you! lol
,CDNAussie,2010-03-21T20:07Z,you guys need to seed this shit..285 ppl and i got 3 ppl seeding
,JTAGpope,2010-03-21T23:24Z,@GizmoK if you can confirm Achievements are unlocking then its a Final Release.
,crawman,2010-03-22T04:42Z,"I downloaded and burned it no problem, but when I  boot it up it say I need to run an update or I cant play the game and when I chose YES to update it says unrecognized or my cd is dirty, at xbox menu the name and logo of the game do show up I just cant play it?"
,Scorchyk.,2010-03-22T08:33Z,"3,2 kb/s download? 
seed! ^^"
,ReaL_BadMaN,2010-03-22T15:55Z,This game needs to be verified soon goddamnit ive waited enough.
,JTAGpope,2010-03-22T17:39Z,I can Confirm this works on my JTAG xbox 360. 
,no_mercy252,2010-03-22T18:10Z,When is Just Cause 2 PC out ?
,geelad1212,2010-03-22T23:01Z,"alrite guys, this is a genuine dl because im playing it just now.  it doesnt go through abgx because obviously its not out yet, stay away from xbox live if your goin to play this or just stay away until at least the game has come out, im playing it now and have  been for a couple of days and i must admit its bloody superb. 10/10 guy."
,ReeMels,2010-03-23T02:36Z,Works great =) Thx
,BigDet,2010-03-24T03:15Z,thanks this game works great and the game is good as well
,caarll,2010-03-24T12:01Z,"wow awesome seed! downloading in 1,2mbits thanks guys! will seed for at least 3 ratio"
,christian_sese,2010-03-24T17:43Z,"Downloaded it seeding and so far waiting for verification from abgx360 still not here tho, which will take its time. Now with LT out i think its very risky just having the xbox connected to the internet without a proper stealthpatch even tho you might or might not go on xbox live does not matter. The ban risk is way to high, :)"
,christian_sese,2010-03-24T20:01Z,Verified with abgx360 all the greens light are on to download it now go ahead guys!
,slitoke,2010-03-25T01:03Z,Wow...this game is awesome..played sum hrs and its pretty neat
,bgoody,2010-03-25T01:32Z,what software works best to put this on a disc???
,HELLFIRE22,2010-03-25T05:23Z,"the game works great , the game is a 8.5/10 IMO 


good grafics, long campaign and ALOT of side missions"
,n204life,2010-03-25T06:13Z,Dosent run through abgx nor does it burn.  And no im not a noob and have tried to troubleshoot
,atlantic4,2010-03-25T08:28Z,Does this require a flashed Xbox 360 to play? If so how hard is it to flash an Xbox?
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-25T10:37Z,"@n204life

(abgx) Its because the game is not ""Verified"" get by abgx. Games are released first (always) and then in time Verified.

@atlantic4

1. All pirate xbox 360 games required flashed dvd.

2. You need some stuff (hardware/sofware) to do it and its not very hard but if you get it wrong it get you some major issues. "
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-25T10:48Z,"@n204life


nwm i just remember its ""Verified"",  :D"
,n204life,2010-03-25T17:18Z,"Its not failing verification, its failing its CRC check, and it can not fix it"
,cotten,2010-03-25T20:57Z,I'm having a problem saving the game! I play for a while then when I save it. But when I'm loading the game next time am back from the begining! Even the autosave does this. what is the problem? I'm not connected to live in any way.
,atlantic4,2010-03-26T07:19Z,"@Sunblock

Any idea where I could get some hardware/sofware for my 360?"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-26T10:40Z,"@n204life

No ide, but have u tried other isos/dl's?.



@atlantic4

There is so many stores etc....Selling this stuff but here u can see some. But the best way is to google it so know what to use/get and get a good price.

,mattard.2008,2010-03-27T11:53Z,i have burned this to dvd as usual but the consul keeps asking to open tray and does not recognise game. any ideas what is wrong
,pqp2005,2010-03-27T11:56Z,"NEED SOME HELP HERE !!! - so, I patched the game o wave 3 - like I do to all wave 4 games before and all works - but this one asks for an updade, I do the update and this became a loop - update - boot - update boot - and nothing - any solution for that, tahnks for any help"
,M0thman,2010-03-27T19:06Z,"@ pqp

I had the same problem with Dauntes Inferno and a couple other games, heres the fix. 

You need to make another iso with the original wave 4 and update it with a wave 4 iso, the loop is in the conversion. I was able to put my harddrive on my sons box to update mine now all my games work."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-27T21:53Z,"@pqp2005

Well i have also patch the game to wave 3, But i didnt get any update. Do have the latest dashboard (2.0.8955.0)? ."
,LazarusHI,2010-03-28T16:31Z,"People below like geelad1212 are demented.

If you play ANY game before their release date (which is also tagged in the hash of the rip), it gets stored in your secdata.bin file.

It doesn't matter if you aren't connected to the internet on your 360. The next time you do, you will be banned.

Secdata.bin is compared to live server release date. It calculates how many days ago you played it. If before release date, you get 'This console has been banned from xbox live'.

Stop being an idiot and play games after the release date only (if you want to play online on the console too)"
,pqp2005,2010-03-29T13:27Z,"@Sunblock - I donÂ´t update the dashboard because some people says thay I will lost some HD functions ( I am in a Banned console) - but now I will update and see what happens, thanks"

,LazarusHI,2010-03-31T04:38Z,"Wont boot at all on my 1.6 flashed xbox360.

Works on my other one that I repaired from rrod.. Which has ixtreme LT 1.1 that I just flashed a few days ago.

I suspect this is because it identifies as a wave 6 game by aeth's abgx360 mod."
,faponce,2010-03-31T16:58Z,"LazarusHI :

Do You Have the Activate-iso Disk????
If Not then thats the cause!!!!!"
,tay187,2010-04-01T02:38Z,@LazarusHI If you had something with 1.61 it would work.. 1.6 is strict to wave 3? i think... but we are beyond 3 and onto 4 if not 5... so reflash with something ending in x.x1 and you'll be good to go
,bteljuice,2010-04-01T17:09Z,"Hello guys,

My friend hard modded the xbox360. It plays only NTSC and not PAL.

Is there any program I can use that will make it region free or turn PAL games into NTSC games.

Thank you"
,Jubelskalle,2010-04-01T21:10Z,omg there's so many seeders and leechers but my dl wont go over 5kB/s and its not my internet cus ive downloaded other stuff at pretty high speed

,faux360,2010-04-09T02:04Z,is it at all possible to play this and other games on an un-modded 360 now that you can use flash drives with it?
,UncleMoe9999,2010-04-13T03:47Z,"@faux360: Yes you can play without a mod!  Just patch a Wii into the 360 via USB cable, microwave your backup for 3 minutes in the microwave, then put it into the Wii.

The Wii will boot it and it will play on your 360!"

,aaron271984,2010-04-23T16:21Z,"SEED, SEED, SEED! People please learn to seed torrent properly. Especially with big file torrents like this it's important you learn to seed as much as you can. I'm getting all sorts of speeds, at one point my speeds are up to 256kb/s with an estimation time of about 4-5 hours completion. Then the speeds drop down to 45-50kb/s and even 21kb/s with an estimation time of 19 hours to even a day. 

I have a pretty fast internet connection, but if people could learn to seed correctly then we would all get these downloads in hours rather than days."

,aufc4life,2010-06-19T12:55Z,works a treat!! Brilliant!! Shame the game sucks!!
,Popeben,2010-06-22T19:22Z,"Does anyone know why this game has still got a question mark under 'Stealth for ixtreme' in the abgx database? 

As tangmonk said. the game passes abgx fine, stealth check passed. 

Does the database not get updated anymore?

I'm worried that it isn't safe to play online.
