Some points to note.
1) TPB gets a mention including url 
2) illegal music downloaders actually spend more money on legal purchases, than those who never download illegally."

I do not see how Britney Spears should get a higher annual income than a highly trained doctor researching a cure for cancer.

Britannica Online defines art as ""the use of skill and imagination in the creation of aesthetic objects, environments, or experiences that can be shared with others.""

If a person that has musical ability wishes to share his joyful pursuit with the public then he is free to perform.
It is not a skill that is worth paying money for.

Contrary to the claims in this video the music industry does not help a musician to perform or to improve their musical ability.

They are in business to sell records , it has nothing to do with music or the arts at all.

So their desire to protect the music industry is false , they wish to protect the *industry* that makes money from people that can make music.

Personally I don't think that a musicians should be payed , just like a person that plays hopscotch or that can throw a frisby shouldn't be payed.

On the point that sharing of music files reduces music album sales I must say that in my case it is not true.
I do not have any music on my PC that I would have payed for."
