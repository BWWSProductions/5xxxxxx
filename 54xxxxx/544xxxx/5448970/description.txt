Hello everyone.
Time is running truly fast, isn't it? I remember saying couple of things back in december 2009 regarding this year's playlist happening. 
These days there is beginning to crystallise a side project of me and my friend (daKradha) so stay tuned and be prepared for more music in the near future. 
Can't tell you more right now.
I had been passing through the certain issues that had affected a slight delay of Spring 2010 playlist so I apologize for that. 
This season I've tried to put there little bit of everything including some local bands which are really worth hearing. 
If you find any of the bands in the list appealing, SUPPORT them in any possible way.
I guess it's enough words, let the music say the rest.
