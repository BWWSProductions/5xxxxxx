,Bnita,2010-03-22T12:18Z,Are you working on Sherlock Holmes?
,cleo774,2010-03-22T12:33Z,"hey brick how come this is 2gb more than ur ninja assassin torrent? and this has half the bitrate also...?

But I love you all the same :P"
,McGudge,2010-03-22T13:50Z,"cleo

If you could count its actually 4gb more than ninja assasins.

Brick has put in the 4gb M2TS file along with the 8Gb ISO, as it clearly state in the info"
,halfmonkey,2010-03-22T19:47Z,I know where striving for quality so I thought I'd politely mention that there is a glitch in the encoding (may be on original disc?) at 2 minutes and 8 seconds into the film.
,swiftgate,2010-03-23T02:54Z,"hi Bricktophd
man!!!! good work
I have a request bro, if you could please do....

EYES WIDE SHUT in PS3 format

Please do that if possible in 1080p or even 720 would do.

thanks ever so much"
,alter.mann,2010-03-23T23:38Z,"Hi! I've downloaded some of your torrents and just want to thank you and the PS3 team for the great work.

I was about to suggest you to add subtitles (english, spanish, etc) to your m2ts files (I know the PS3 won't play them, unless you burn the file on dvd with an BD/AVCHD structure), but I'm seeing that you're including an iso file with this torrent, I think that's what I was hoping for. 

Are you going to upload this type iso files from now on? It would be a nice option for people who need or like subtitles and want to burn them on dvd."

,Jer-bear24,2010-05-20T09:12Z,will play on vlc or some other windows player?
,mrpras,2010-07-26T06:03Z,"VLC plays most things, but for x264 MediaPlayerClassic Homecinema is better because it defaults to Hardware decoding (great for any pc that can do it, especially thin&light media PCs).

Without using the hardware (video decoders in the graphics card) the CPU has to do all the work.

MPC HC does this by default, and VLC you need to set up with other codecs to get this working. It also plays all the other standard formats out of the box.

Since you've read this comment till the end, perhaps next time you should read the info for the torrent since it already tells you that it plays on windows, and which players to use.

It's a pity that more people don't know about media player classic Homecinema, it's way better than VLC."
