Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures S01E04: Family Practice

As Fitz (Shawn Ashmore) and Ming (Mayko Nguyen) debate the merits of their insemination plans, the doctors revisit their past entanglements. Fitz finds himself challenged by the demands of a psychotic patient. Chen (Byron Mann) is called away to Brisbane to visit his dying grandfather. And Ming comes to terms with her surprise pregnancy and what it means for her future.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion.
