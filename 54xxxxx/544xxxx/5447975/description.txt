Wikipedia - Ten is the second album by Australian-born singer-songwriter Gabriella Cilmi. Set to be released on 22 March 2010, the album is preceded by the single "On a Mission" and marks Cilmi's foray into more 1980's. According to Cilmi, the album will feature "lots of uptempo funk and disco-inspired numbers designed to make people groove" as well as "some more sexy tracks". One song incorporates a type of yodel into it. While producing the album, Cilmi worked wih Greg Kurstin, The Invisible Men and Dallas Austin, as well as Xenomania on the song Hearts Don't Lie which she likens to a Bee Gees song. The track "Love Me 'Cause You Want To" is the song she's most proud of due to the fact it was produced with her band. The first single off the album, "On a Mission", will be released on 8 March. It is accompanied by a Â£250,000 music video, billed as a homage to Barbarella. Although not officially announced as a single, "Hearts Don't Lie" has started receiving airplay, debuting at #81 on the Australian Airplay Chart.
