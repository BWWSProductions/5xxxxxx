In September 2008 Tank Girl returns to her rightful place in a British monthly comic, specifically the Judge Dredd Megazine, as we unveil a year-long story "Skidmarks" in twelve trouser-tanning instalments. This will then be gathered up into a mini-series (by Titan Books, now with a great distribution Stateside) and finally shovelled into graphic novel form in time for your Christmas prezzie list in 2009.
