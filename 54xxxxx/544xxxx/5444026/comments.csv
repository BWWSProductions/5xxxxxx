       Chew Lips are three kids - Tigs (vocals), James Watkins (bass, synths) and Will Sanderson (guitar, synths) - from London who play infectious lo-fi tech tunes and have been together since about March 2008. They have released two singles, the self-produced ‘Solo’ and its follow-up, ‘Salt Air’, through Kitsune, and their debut album, ‘Unicorn,’ came out in January 2010."
