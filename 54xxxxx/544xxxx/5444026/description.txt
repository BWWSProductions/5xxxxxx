Couldn't find any Chew Lips album "Unicorn" here so uploaded :D
Chew Lips (sometimes written as CHEW LiPS) are a South London based dance-pop trio, formed in spring of 2008[1]. They consist of singer Tigs, and multi-instrumentalists Will Sanderson and James Watkins.[2]

The singer sounds like Karen O.
