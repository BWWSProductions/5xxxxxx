,deridder23,2010-03-26T18:53Z,"Works like a charm. Only need to mount it with daemon tools and install. The game's OK, only a shame that Tancredi has a total different look."

,rEmLoW,2010-03-30T13:59Z,"There is no file to mount.
Its no ISO file just a 3 others NFO-File, SQL Server MDF file and MDS File
Need help"
,Babbleshots,2010-03-30T15:07Z,"To all the people saying the .mdf file is corrupt:
You should mount the .mds file, not the .mdf.
It's weird cause it's only 2kb but that one works."
,rEmLoW,2010-03-30T15:29Z,"When i open Daemon Tools I can only chose MDS File , but when i chose it, it  says Unable to mount image , invalide image file"
,Babbleshots,2010-03-30T16:12Z,"When you can choose which file you want to mount, choose: all files. Not only all images. Then you get all the files in the map displayed, and choose for .mds, not .mdf!"

,bigmaq91,2010-04-04T02:20Z,"It works without any crack! 
Im just have a bit of trouble with a mission where im suposed to follow bellic when im sitting in a lockerroom, he doesenÂ´t leave the room and i cant proceed with the mission. Does anybody have or had the same problem?"
,SJCarline,2010-04-07T17:50Z,"Lmao ok for daemon tools, right click the icon neer your clock go to preferences then integration select all and you will then be able to mount the image using the .mds. Turn off all anti-virus and or security centers. IF there is a virus or anything it will be taken care of when you run the game. IF any of that doesn't work then download the file again. 90% of PC related errors are user errors meaning you either did something or something you installed is doing it. If 9/10 people got it working I'm sure the person who uploaded the file did not single you out."
,pogogogo,2010-04-08T19:31Z,"I was searching for This is war and Willing to die for a long time. Finally i got them so i thought i would share it as i have read that many people are looking for these songs.

,patrioticparadox,2010-04-21T20:38Z,please please please dont download this piece of shit. the show was only good for the first season and then they completely abandoned the plot. Please dont contribute to the downfall of mankind
,nerd1337,2010-04-27T02:18Z,"Haha.  I love how angry the lamers are because they don't understand Alcohol 120's media descriptor image.  You typically will always mount the MDF file associated with the MDS image when you mount it with Alcohol 120%.  If you're using something different, you will just directly mount the MDS image.  If you're still using Daemon Tools, which is a buggy piece of useless shit at best, try using Alcohol 52% or 120% instead to mount images.  It actually works.."
,nerd1337,2010-04-27T02:45Z,"I meant the load the MDS file associated with the MDF image, otherwise mount the MDS directly.  Haha. Whoops."
