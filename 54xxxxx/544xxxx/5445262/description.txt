Sonny Rollins' Volume 2 for Blue Note is one of those timeless discs. It is a milestone in jazz history that gathered together some of the founding fathers of the post-bop era. Joining Rollins are Jazz Messengers Art Blakey (drums) and Horace Silver (piano), Miles Davis' favorite bassist Paul Chambers, the quintessential trombonist J. J. Johnson and even Thelonious Monk himself. This is a swinging tour-de-force that begins with a bang and doesn't let up until the last note has faded away.


Recorded at Van Gelder Studios, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey on April 14, 1957
