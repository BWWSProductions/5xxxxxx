Welcome to Tag Team Tuesday and the first match of the 2010 Tag Team League. This is round 3 of 4 of the February match-up between The Ninjas and Team Ice.

Only 53pts separate the two teams going into the final round of wrestling. Team Ice cut into the Ninja's lead and won round 2, and now enter the 3rd round with great momentum. Ariel X takes it up a notch and punishes Vendetta during their one-on-ones. Mellanie Monroe also steps it up and gives Tara Lynn Fox trouble for the first time all night. 

In the end, time is Team Ice's worst enemy. They fall 15pts short of the victory. Winning rounds 2 and 3 were not enough to dig themselves out of the hole the Ninja's put them in in round 1. If there was only 10 seconds left on the clock....
