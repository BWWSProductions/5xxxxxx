Amazon.com Review By Peter Durward Harris "Pete the music fan" - Buddy Holly's place in popular music history is significant. He was a major influence on the Beatles and Rolling Stones as well as many other singers in a variety of genres. Whole tribute albums have been devoted to him. The Hollies named themselves after him. Yet, all this was achieved despite his limited recorded output. On this album, you get all the classics - Heartbeat, That'll be the day, Peggy Sue, Oh boy, Rave on, True love ways, Raining in my heart, Everyday, It's so easy, Listen to me and It doesn't matter anymore among them. Many of these (and others) have been covered frequently down the years, and new versions continue to appear on a regular basis. The Rolling Stones covered Not fade away and it first appeared on one of their early B-sides. In 2002, British jazz singer Claire Martin recorded a magical version of Raining in my heart, perhaps the best cover of a Buddy Holly song I've ever heard - and I've heard a lot. Besides those classic songs, there are some great covers here, some of which were also hits for Buddy. They include Blue Suede shoes (Carl Perkins), also covered by Elvis, and Brown eyed handsome man (Chuck Berry). With 36 tracks, there is still enough room to include some interesting but seldom-heard songs, such as What to do, Learning the Game, Look at me and Take your time. This is the best single-CD collection of Buddy's music that you are ever likely to find.
