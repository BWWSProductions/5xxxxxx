I am trying to get to know the DC universe since a few months now.

Crisis is a very great part of it I think.

Does anyone have a reading order of this torrent ?"

,L0dg3r,2010-08-01T06:54Z,"On re-downloading the torrent, it works perfectly; my one complaint would be that it is not in sequence; would have been nice. Fairly minor issue, though, I'm going in and manually renaming the folders. A bit of a hassle, but again, not a major one."
