If you get a pop-up telling you that you need a Serial Code when you launch the Game, you forgot to replace the original .exe with the Cracked one. Read the Crack part in the Installation Guide. If you still don't get it, please contact our Support: Games4theworld@hotmail.com"

[T],Games4theworld,2010-05-09T11:43Z,"Hi,


Normally you can't go Online with Cracked Games. For now, you can't go Online with this Game; I'm afraid you'll have to buy it for that, sorry."

Its when I actually play the game that the mouse or cross hair only moves upwards and to the left even if you move your mouse the right or downwards. I have tryed reseting controls, changing them that didn't work. I then updated and copied the Update files from the crack folder into the game folder, still no success. The pointer works fine in main menu. Any help/solutions ? Cheers  "

the mouse always look up and only move forward and to the right side"
,wardex,2010-06-21T05:43Z,"If you're having problems with your mouse while playing the Game or you just want to Update
the Game, Update the Game. This will mostly fix the problems. This is how you Update:

1. Go to C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Battlefield Bad Company 2     and start the
 'BFBC2Updater.exe'. It'll ask if you want to Update Yes / No. Select 'Yes'.
2. Open the '# Crack' folder in this .rar file and open the '# Update fix' folder in there.
3. Copy + Paste áll the files in there to a folder on your Desktop.
4. Mount* the 'BFBC2_mini-image.mds' évery time you want to play or keep it Mounted always.
5. Start the Game and... ENJOY playing!




All done and followed but still problem with mouse and movement

This has nothing to do with the torrent(s), it's the PC's you tested it on. This Game works 100%. Check if the PC's you tested it on can run the Game at all: http://cyri.systemrequirementslab.com/CYRI/intro.aspx
If yes, try to Update the Game, as described in the Installation Guide."

No, you can't go Online with Cracked Games. For that, you'll need to buy the Original Game.


@leachyboy77

Open the .rar file you Downloaded, using WinRar(!), which can be Downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . When you opened the .rar file, select áll files and then drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. Open that folder and start by reading the ""# Installation Guide.txt""."

[T],Games4theworld,2011-01-21T21:04Z,"Hello,

@CoJuarez

Open the .rar file you downloaded using WinRar (!), which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . When opened using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, open the folder on your desktop and then restart the installation.
If you use any other software than WinRar, the files will get messed up.

@aussy1

Please read the ""Update"" -part in the ""# Installation Guide.txt"" carefully. After applying the update, the game should work fine."
[T],Games4theworld,2011-03-17T22:28Z,"Hello,

If you do not update as described in the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"", you'll not be able to play the game, as your mouse won't work."
