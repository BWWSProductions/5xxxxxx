[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-07T01:02Z,"the records i do have are: 
The who - quadrophenia (i also have live at leeds, and who's next) 
pink floyd - the wall (but it's scratched to shit, and i don't want to transfer it)
pink floyd - physical grafitti (also have the delicate sound of thunder (live))
the only sabbath i have is ""black sabbath"" the first one.

i'll be happy to upload them, but in time, i have a few already ready to go, and they'll have to come first :D 

Next: Queen - Greatest Hits"
