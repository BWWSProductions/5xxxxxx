Their second album "The King's New Garment" is much more balanced than the previous, they include some references to ALAN PARSONS PROJECT debut album to the already well known, but the main problem is that the opening track (The King's New Garment) is the only epic and has absolutely no relation with Progressive Rock, again ore in the vein of Neo Classical.
