SuperRam v6.4.5.2010
Full Version with Serial
Windows 7, Vista, XP, - 32 & 64 Bit compatible

SuperRam allows you take control of your computer's memory, 
how physical memory is allocated and help determine the performance of your computer system. 
Windows routinely allocates memory to applications, games and system processes; 
over time the memory becomes completely used handling all of these tasks.
With SuperRam, memory management is tuned to maintain computer stability 
but a greater emphasis is placed on computer performance. 
Once installed SuperRam begins to monitor the total amount of memory 
your computer has installed, it also monitors when your computer reaches a threshold 
of memory to maintain, when that threshold is reached SuperRam immediately will release 
all memory that it determines can be released on the computer system back to Windows.
When SuperRam is installed any new application, program or game that is opened will 
use physical memory installed on the computer and placing applications that you 
opened previously to use virtual memory. This allows software to run with an emphasis 
on performance when performance is needed; such as when playing games, 
editing photos/videos, using processor and memory intensive applications
