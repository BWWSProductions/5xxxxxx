I downloaded a few album from you and sounded good! But why do you rip your cd's with iTunes and not with Exact Audio Copy?

Or do you use LAME in iTunes? Or you rip in AAC and convert to mp3?

Please tell me how you do it!

Thank you"

Can you get Mariah Carey Vision of Love on here please?"
,aaaaaagg2a,2010-04-23T12:42Z,And Mariah Carey Glitter.

I only convert once from my original cd.
