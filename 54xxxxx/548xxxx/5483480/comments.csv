,believenu,2010-04-07T03:57Z,"I have a question. while perusing your torrents it appears you like older classics..doris day, audrey hepburn.. have you ever come across a copy of a cult classic""what's so bad about feeling good"" with mary tyler moore and george peppard ?I have been looking for a year on the ""net"" with no luck. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-07T09:39Z,"@believenu: One guy ripped few years back English version, another guy Spanish Satellite TV version. Both rips/encodes doesn't exist anymore. It's such shame! Classic movie with song/theme which anyone has heard... but, unfortunately, not the only one.

Well, you can buy DVD on Amazon or from guys who sell used DVDs for 8 bucks a piece. Links can be found on Google. Also, on ebay few ""what's so bad about feeling good"" DVDs can be bought, but I am absolutely without any money, so, if you want it badly - maybe you can buy and rip one."
