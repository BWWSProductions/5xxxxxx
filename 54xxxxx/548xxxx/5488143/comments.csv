Worked perfect for me, and thanks for the torrent. Just try use MP3 next time so the songs aren't 20-35Mb."
,mrtetris88,2011-09-12T06:01Z,thanks for the upload and the advice for mp3 conversion 
,SmegMaster,2011-10-19T14:22Z,Great torrent! Quality is superb. And just ingore what TokeUp said. You should definately stick with lossless. Sounds a lot better.
,peterparkerdatsme,2012-07-04T06:40Z,"@TokeUp420 : Dude shut your dumbass up. The fact that you are pushing for mp3 over FLAC is beyond stupid. And the only reason I'm not gonna roast your ass completely is because you had the decency to thank the uploader. 

@yanek231 You know what's up. Great share. I really appreciate the time and effort you put into this. I grew up on this shit and finding a FLAC drop is awesome! Keep doing what you're doing. This is excellent stuff.

@AnyoneWhoCan'tAppreciateFLAC  Kick rocks foo's. Go get some gear that can handle real music....."
