[b]Excerpt from liner notes: '[/b] ...Country blues, like Dixieland jazz, may indeed be headed for this neutral status, but the performances on this disc should demonstrate that this music still has plenty of life, remaining at its roots almost a century after its origins. At the same time, however, these recordings are documents of a type of music that may not survive for many more years in this cultural setting. The youngest artists on this disc are now in theit fifties, and they are the youngest practitioners of this art in the mid-south region who learned their music in the traditional manner. Most such artists are in their sixties, seventies, and eighties. Younger ones are learning the tradition. The artists on this disc represent about one-third of the total number of blues artists who are known to be currently performing in the area of Mississippi, West Tennessee, and East Arkansas in a solo or duo style. They chosen for presentation here because they are among the artist least represented on recordings previously. A single listen, however, will show that they are deserving of greater fame and that they are among the artistic leaders in the country blues of the 1990's. All of these recordings were made in the first week of 1994 in Memphis and northern Mississippi in informal settings and improvised home 'studios'. One-quarter of the selections are spirituals. 
These illustrate the fact that most of these artists are more than simply 'bluesmen' and that the blues and spiritual traditions have much in common in their musical styles...' by Dr. David Evans

*The Diddley Bow is an American string instrument of African origin, probably developed from instruments found on the Ghana coast of west Africa. The Diddley Bow is rarely heard outside the rural south. Other nicknames for this instrument include â€œjitterbugâ€ or â€œone-string,â€ while an ethnomusicologist would formally call it a â€œmonochord zither.â€
