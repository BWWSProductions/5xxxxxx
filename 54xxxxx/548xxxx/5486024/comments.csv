,sdnl1j2,2010-04-08T15:16Z,"it's the same launcher as before, don't know why skidrow done that

,Zoomer88,2010-04-10T11:21Z,Hm. Actually it works. For me at least. Dunno what I've done wrong but it works :)
,danilo86,2010-04-12T16:49Z,"Work fine here, i can play online without problem."
,sdnl1j2,2010-04-14T01:57Z,yeah worked fine here....
,jEase_Us,2010-05-31T12:25Z,"it's the real deal, I especially love the V-Sync option in the game...
If you have problems with this crashing in module xlive.dll then you probably updated GFWL and this trainer requires xlive 3.1.99 so you'll want to find that on ie. demon0id or somewhere else if you can
btw, win 7 64bit

,jEase_Us,2010-05-31T12:27Z,"I forgot to say, that RFG, IE and GFWL , all three are blocked from accessing the internet (since install) and it all works fine, even savegames (because created local profile aka offline one)
Oh yeah and thank you SKiDROW and all you seeders out there :D"
,Krisando,2010-10-16T08:14Z,"I confirm this works with Red Faction 1.0.2 (patch 2). Those people who cannot save should think before posting.

If you cannot save (due to no option of offline profile), than either create a profile, update and play. Or uninstall ""games for windows live"" in control panel, and install an older version with this option.

I use the installer from the Resident Evil 5 disk."
,TriQueSter28,2011-03-30T19:12Z,"WARNING:

this patch gives problem to RED FACTION GUERRILLA..it makes the game fast and gives the ""coat glitch"" (the tail of the coat flaps around,it goes crazy and then it'll stop and the tail will disappear)And some random lagness..

this what i experience:

-Fast gameplay,it's annoying cause it makes driving and shooting hard (fast targets)...

-Coat Glitch

-First mission bug (you will not be able to finish the first mission,means you can't further continue the game) :(

-And sometimes lag..until you restart the game again!!

This is just a WARNING,so download at your own risk..Don't tell me i didn't warn you"
