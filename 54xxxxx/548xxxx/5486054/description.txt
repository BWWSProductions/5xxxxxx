A sweeping story captivates players from the start! An epic story in an
authentic world hand-crafted with an eye for detail and populated by real,
plausible characters. A Mysterious Volcanic Island The heavy tremors on the
island bode ill for its inhabitants. Ancient temples have risen from the
ground recently, bizarre creatures are terrorising the area. Fear and terror
is spreading among the population. The End of All Hope? A group of powerful
men who call themselves The Inquisitors have taken it upon them-selves to
put an end to these events. They send an exhibition to this remote island,
but a storm takes hold of the ship and destroys it at sea. A Hero Will Come
As if by a miracle, the player survives the shipwreck and is stranded on the
volcanic island alone. He finds himself amidst a chaos of rebellion, tyranny
and mystic rituals. He must now decide to which side the pendulum of fate
