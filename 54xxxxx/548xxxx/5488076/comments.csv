,Smorgan,2010-04-11T19:08Z,I take no credit where it is due because I did not come up with this method so if you wish to thank some one that would be tuvi whom came up with the work around...
,Smorgan,2010-04-11T19:09Z,The RTM is expected to be leaked in the next week or 2 so that is very good advise thats the word I got from various users on MDL forum...
,Smorgan,2010-04-12T20:24Z,We were chatting about the need for a uninstaller for the product key.  However turns out I checked to see if the uninstaller even worked but it doesn't sadly enough.  The only way you can really uninstall it is by doing a uninstall or a registry edit to eliminate the product key stored in there... I wanted a uninstall so that you could revert to the red bar on top thats what that was all about...
,Smorgan,2010-04-12T20:29Z,Also with that we were chatting about the virus scans done on this torrent I said they were all false positives which they are he seemed to disagree lol... I can factually say thou that this torrent is 100% virus free...
,Smorgan,2010-04-15T01:30Z,I most def will not forget to link it lol but yea the office 2010 RTM has not hit WZOR yet the last I heard on it was that the version number was 14.0.4764.1000 I believe...When it does hit WZOR a link will go up.....Going on I am 100% sure that this hack works with the office 2010 RTM....
,Smorgan,2010-04-17T06:50Z,Nope I'm not gonna pray cause from what I've seen on the Wzor website it says the office 2010 RTM works with the KMS hack aka this hack and Version 2.10.  A little sneak peak of it is in the image box...
,Smorgan,2010-04-17T18:36Z,"I have a leak now Wzor leaked it earlier today:

http://wzor.net/page/indexx.html

Scroll down to see what version you want...
Official RTM release x64 or x86
Say thank you to WZOR..."
,Smorgan,2010-04-18T20:30Z,lol Your tellin me I only have a download rate of 100KBP so this is going to take a little while...
,Smorgan,2010-04-19T05:31Z,True but I'm not complaining now that I have it done now I just have to get the 32 bit version down...
,Smorgan,2010-04-20T07:53Z,"If your having trouble download and install the following: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8265fdef-b921-4dbf-ba8b-bb1cbe238ce6&displaylang=en

After failing activate it with Tuvi hack etc.bat

Run keygen.exe when the Volume activation management tool 2.00 runs and right click the office 2010 key.  Then hit activate via kms by hovering over activate then hit KMS..."
,Smorgan,2010-04-26T01:57Z,Well I've finally gotten back to this after a very long time lol.  Yea I can confirm the retail edition is out as I have the 64 bit edition at this point.  Also finished working on a Windows hack however thats gonna stay where it is right now in testing...
,Ibis,2010-07-17T08:43Z,"Thanks, Smorgan, for all your work on this. I have a copy of a retailed Office 2010 Professional. This is NOT a VL edition. It requires a product key to be entered at the start of installation. When I try to activate with Tuvi\'s hack or the Re-Activator (version 2.05) it throws errors because a product key is already entered. Please tell me what to do next."
,Ibis,2010-07-17T08:45Z,Its the 32-bit version of Office 2010 Professional.nnThanks for your help
,webguru77,2010-10-10T03:25Z,Why am I getting a virus alert on several of the files in this download?
,webguru77,2010-10-13T19:31Z,"when I try to install this, I get the message that it cannot find the VBscript engine.

What do I do?"
,originalog,2011-08-03T21:18Z,"This worked amazing Smorgan I have been messing with shitty hacks for about a week now this is the real deal

I first ran Office 2010 Hack by Tuvi as Administrator and then The Office 2010 Re-Activator and it worked like a charm.

I owe you one, thank you!"
,window2hell,2012-06-11T23:41Z,i just bought a new laptop and it came preloaded with office 2010 but requires a product key or something.. do i have to download the whole file or just can i use the key gen and use the key.. im pretty new at this so any help would be appreciated
