[V],meech,2010-04-13T02:16Z,"For some reason, no one seems to want to seed this season.  I've already uploaded 100gb and we still only have 3 seeders (1 being me), yet 37 leechers.  To you leechers...you are all potential seeders once you are done downloading...so please seed when you are done downloading!  I have season 6 all ripped and ready to go.  But I like to be able to devote all of my bandwidth to uploading one file at a time so to give a new torrent a good speed.  So as soon as we have enough seeders for me to leave this season alone, season 6 will be posted.  Thanks to the few who have/are seeding!"

Are these the ones without that Wesley Crusher
Cunt ?

I will seed as long as possible 120MB/S "
,Skram0,2011-03-20T06:44Z,"These encodes, all the seasons, seem a bit strange. Seems like low quality regarding the colors, especially the low-end color range. I watch these on a 50"" plasma, or a 28"" LCD, and the dark scenes just don't have the full range of color. There's also a lot of dot-crawl and interlace jaggies, seen especially in the credits.

These are encoded as 23.976fps, and playback seems jerky, like there's frames missing every second and like they shouldn't have been encoded at 24fps. I've seen other encodes at 29.970 that play a lot smoother, i.e. when the enterprise flys by.

Anyway, there's a JCH release of the series that seem to play a bit more stable (for me) and are encoded in a VFR (variable frame rate). They're about the same encode size too. Download one episode as a sample and give it a try.

But anyway, thanks meech for your encodes, I'm up to season 5 so far. :)"
[V],meech,2011-04-10T21:46Z,"@Skram0:
The jerkiness you refer to is a problem you can't avoid when encoding mixed framerate dvds.  Star Trek Next Generation episodes were filmed at two different framerates...29.97 and 23.978. The closing credits and a few other special effect shots were shot at a different framerate than the rest of the show. The only way to encode these with zero jerkiness is to encode at a variable framerate (like the JCH torrent you referred to). However, this causes incompatibility problems with just about every hardware media streamer out there, such as apple-tv, wd-live, ps3mediaserver, popcorn hour, etc. The torrent author even pointed out that his torrents won't even work with the highly acclaimed VLC player.  To me that is unacceptable, since the point of high quality rips (at least for me) is to view them on a large screen t.v. through a media server.

So you are left with two choices...to force 23.97 or 29.97. I experimented with both and realized that 23.97 was the best bet. Only a few of the scenes suffer at this rate. Some of the other torrents out there chose 23.97 as well. And you will see the same effect with the credits. Other encoders (other torrents) chose 29.97...yes the end credits look fine, but many other shots, especially when the camera pans, look very ""studdery""/jerky. So there's still yet a trade-off.  I figured sacrificing a couple scenes such as the closing credits and a small handful of special effects scenes, to benefit the majority of the other scenes was the right way to go. 

This is one of my very best favorite shows.  So I really wanted to get the best quality to watch them for myself through my media server.  I experimented with the various framerates, and 23.97 left me with the most enjoyable experience...and i hope for others as well.  As far as the color range, I'm not sure I noticed that.  Perhaps it takes more of a trained eye.  But there wasn't much more I could do for the quality, as I turned the x264 settings up just about as high as they go to get the best quality out of of the encoder engine.  Perhaps it is just a drawback of the x264 encoder engine that you are seeing."
,syrinx05,2011-04-17T01:35Z,"First off, thank you so much Meech for uploading these! I'm using PS3 Media Server vs 1.21.0 and seasons 1-3 have played flawlessly. However, seasons 4 and 5 are playing dialog only with no video. I haven't the slightest idea what is wrong, as I go back and replay an episode of season 3 and it's fine.

Is there anything I can do to alleviate this problem?

Thanks again!"
,la_cross37,2011-07-08T01:18Z,"I really appreciate your uploads, but I don't like to download the hole thing at ones, so I download one episode at the time and if I got more time I can sometimes download three at the time and I only upload about 100kb/s, so I'm really trying to upload as much as I can on every episode but most of the time I delete the torrent + data and begin downloading the next episode as soon as the episode I was downloading is done, so my uploading ratio is almost always 100%/episode, I wish I could upload more but it's just not going to happen. I don't even have enough room on my laptop to keep more then around five episodes (my desktop is under repair).

But anyway, thanks for the UL!"
,dambix,2012-03-20T22:22Z,I am seeding season 3 and 4 and will seed this one for 1 month
,dokieokie,2012-07-15T23:08Z,"SEED YOU LEECHERS.  I always do a 5:1 ratio! THIS SYSTEM ONLY WORKS IF YOU SEED!

Killer upload, thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
