,PiraatBae,2011-04-22T04:07Z,"Thank you for the upload but this also suffers from the video/audio sync issues.  In this case the slight video jump occurs at around 41:07.  After this the audio is out of sync.  Also tested on various players.  Again, with VLC the sync can be adjusted but interrupts the enjoyment of this classic film.

As an experiment. I watched Cottage to Let in three forms.  Your upload, an upload of the full feature on YouTube (as well as downloading this and watching again to make sure and prevent connection interference) and the Watch Instantly option on Netflix.  The only version to have this jump in video which creates a sync issue is your upload.

Please understand that I am not trying to insult your wonderful attempt to share these classic Alastair Sim films, I'm just hoping to help pinpoint the problem your uploads are suffering from, whether it is a software issue etc."
[T],renman,2011-05-14T02:20Z,"PiraatBae Thank you for your comments. I feel I must point out that I do not attempt to share I simply do share that's the whole point. As far as the Sync issue is concerned, I haven't noticed this issue other than perhaps a millisecond out but then it is an old film and it is identical to the original DVD source"
