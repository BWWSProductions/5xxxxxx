looked for this film for quite some time, found the full DVD that is listed here  was never fully available (lack of seeds) - got a copy at my local library and  thought i would try my hand at some video compression - i think i did a pretty fair job for my first ever DVDrip to .avi, no audio/visual synch problems & looks great ... but you can be the judge of that !!


Sorry, Wrong Number (1948)
Barbara Stanwyck & Burt Lancaster
Director - Anatole Litvak
[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040823/]
English w/NO subtitles, sorry !!
Brief Synopsis:
Leona Stevenson is sick and confined to her bed. One night, whilst waiting for her husband to return home, she picks up the phone and accidentally overhears a conversation between two men planning a murder. She becomes increasingly desperate as she tries to work out who the victim is so the crime can be prevented.

should fit on 1 standard CD-ROM disc, but of course does NOT - might have to make it a bit smaller next time...
comments, questions & uprates always welcomed
remember to seed, seed til your eye dem bleed !

love,
frosty
