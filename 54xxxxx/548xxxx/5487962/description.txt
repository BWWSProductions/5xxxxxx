NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....The bounty Hunter
Right ....running late on this one oops,sorry all .Anyway we used the russian dvdr and mentions audio (thanks,even though we think it's our audio)
Firstly after ripping the dvdr and muxing mentions audio,to us it seems oos slightly by 2 different lengths so we resynced
it,making 2 cuts ...1x -100ms and another 1x -200ms.
The audio has been tweaked aswell,slightly just adding some more bass and a few more changes on the EQ.
The video was nice to start with but like most r5's have problems....main one with this is that they all look orange :lol: The colouring
on the DVDR is way off (well for our liking anyway ).Also it was a touch dark in places ,so we've basically gave it a good clean up and
increased the sharpness aswell.
