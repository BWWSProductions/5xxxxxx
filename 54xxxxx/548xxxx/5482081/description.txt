NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Why Did I Get Married Too ?
Well firstly welcome back to NNC to the torrenting world .....many thanks bro ;-)
Work done,well mainly just rotating the video and ripping source files.....but done a little
tweaking to colours,contrast and what not.
Audio is untouched not filtered in anyway.
Now the source is pretty good for a cam,but does have it problems ...main one being now and again the video
goes all weird when changing from dark to light scene (not a focus issue) but it's hard to explain,goes like slow motion and
grainy for a few seconds and then kicks back in.
Audio....well we have no direct audio yet,so we've opted to use the cam audio,but must say there is alot of laughing on it and also
some noise but still for cam audio it's pretty good.
If we get direct audio before another grp does we'll do a V2,but there's alot of grps now who get audio so ....you never know a grp
might already have.
