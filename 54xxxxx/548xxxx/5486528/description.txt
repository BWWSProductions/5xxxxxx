 A sexy retelling of the Dickens holiday classic A Christmas Carol, this well-crafted adult feature stars Merrie Holiday as the mean and nasty editrix of a skin magazine who is making her poor assistant work late on Christmas Eve redoing layout designs. When she finally goes home, she's visited by the ghost of her former partner, who joins her for a rousing boink session. Then she's off to Christmas Future, where she finds herself as a skanky Times Square prostitute. Then she sees Christmas Present, where her assistant, at last home with his wife, is enjoying a tender and intimate love-making session. A very good porn adaption of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol
