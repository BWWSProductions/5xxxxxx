,JunaidSivany,2010-09-05T02:33Z,will it work in windows 7 ???
,tpb_andrei,2010-09-05T22:54Z,"yes, it works"
,adhd1234,2010-10-17T12:59Z,"How do I install? What do I do when it asks for serial, productkey?
How do I activate the crack, and where is it?"
,Masterjohnny,2010-11-04T18:47Z,Hello. adhd1234 did you resolve your issue? Has anybody tried this on Windows 7 64-bit Professional? Does it work?
,Zeusmariozep,2010-11-10T07:27Z,...don't you know how to read...it'll be like simply reading instructions...
,viniciusvrd,2010-12-01T14:33Z,It works perfectly and it is very easy to crack following the instructions. 
,bubba007,2010-12-19T02:38Z,"Just finished trying to get this to work, per the instructions in the included crack folder, serial number crack no longer works, preventing user from proceeding to activation screen to even attempt included hack.  Think Autodesk Maya got the leg up on you, either that or you need to work on your writing skills, following included instructions leads to failure."
,bubba007,2010-12-19T02:40Z,"Just registered to let you know the hack and instruction set are no longer valid for the instal procedure, posted a previous comment, but it doesn't appear to have gone through, attempt 2."
,bubba007,2010-12-21T07:06Z,"I just wanted to say I owe you an pology sir, I tried again and realized that the instructions DID make sense and DO function, maybe it's not the way I would've described it, but that does not detract from its effectiveness.  Thanks for your time!"
,RicoTylor,2010-12-29T23:35Z,"Bubba007, Could yo explain how you did things? As I can not get it to activate."
,srikaanth,2011-01-01T08:26Z,"Hi...Could anyone help me out..
After choosing the option ""I have an activation code from Autodesk""  and when I click on mempatch, I'm getting an error as ""No Debug"". I dont know what it is..how do I activate it"
,srikaanth,2011-01-01T16:55Z,Got it...........just restart the system after installation. Then follow the instruction in the text file and everything works fine........without restart it wont work
,hbobby,2011-01-04T17:42Z,"SOLUTION:

even if you are running 64 bit for your OS, use 32bit generator. and after installing restart your computer, not the program. "
,AutoDeskMaya,2011-01-17T18:35Z,Does It Really Work?
,wolfy_m,2011-01-18T03:20Z,"Everything works fine until you get to the Product License Activation Options...
I select that I have the activation code, plug the request into X-Force (32 bits, after having done the mem patch). 

It supplies me with a code, yes, but the code is 8 characters short. What am I supposed to do for the missing 8 spaces? Two whole boxes are not being filled out.

Is there another way to get the activation code??"
,wolfy_m,2011-01-18T03:26Z,"Everything works fine until you get to the Product License Activation Options...

When I run x-force (I'd followed all the instructions, including the Mem Patch) and paste the Request Code into it, it does indeed supply me with an activation code, but that code is 8 characters too short. Two boxes aren't even filled, and obviously Maya doesn't let you continue when you don't have a full activation code. 

Is there another place to get an activation code?"
,wolfy_m,2011-01-18T03:26Z,"Ack, sorry for the double post. It showed up once and when I directed myself back to this page it disappeared. Once I posted it showed up again, haha."
,wolfy_m,2011-01-18T04:12Z,"Aha! Apparently you don't need the last two boxes filled. It accepted the activation code on the third try, with the last two boxes still not filled out.

Yep, it works."
,whitetreason81,2011-01-18T04:37Z,"So I installed Maya and everything and restarted my computer but whenever i hit Activate it opens a blank, white screen with two ""selection bullets"" but there are no words in the window only the two buttons.... anybody know how to fix this problem?"
,AutoDeskMaya,2011-01-21T20:52Z,How do you rip things?
,JakePirate,2011-01-29T23:38Z,"I'm having the same problem as whitetreason. After clicking Activate the next screen just go white with only 2 selection bubble and nothing else.

Would love some help. Thank you."
,Avalani,2011-02-02T21:14Z,"can someone please tell me where to find the crack folder. the download seems to contain only three files, an iso image file, an sfv file, and nfo file but no crack. I am a new member and will appreciate any help. thanks"

,hslice,2011-02-05T22:25Z,"Ok, this is a stupid question but the first instruction says Install Autodesk Maya....Where am I supposed to install it from?! I can't find anything."
,hslice,2011-02-05T22:42Z,"comment didnt show up first time...
Anyway stupid question but the first instructions say Install Autodesk Maya....where do we do that from?"

,MikeCirka,2011-02-19T04:08Z,"I've yet to download this specific torrent (About to, since my won't work... but here's the fix for the blank screen with radio buttons:

go to this directory:
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Autodesk Shared\AdLM\R1\en-US\Webdepot

Find the file RTBeginReg.html, open it in notepad, and add the following line directly below  :



That should fix the radio button problem. Another thing to try if that doesn't work (Which it should) is to enter command prompt and type two lines:

regsrv32 jscript.dll
regsrv32 vbscript.dll"
,MikeCirka,2011-02-19T04:10Z,"apparently I can't type html code in the comment boxes... The fix mentioned above goes under the html (located inside < >) and the line is

,Coctail,2011-11-25T14:45Z,"Works really great! Thank you VERY MUCH! I am so happy i got it finally to work!

I had a problem with override licence..so the instalation is fine, but if you have a problem like this:

License was not obtained

Tried Maya 2011 (657C1 2011.0.0.F), error 20



License method:

environment variable MAYA_LICENSE_METHOD='standalone'



Product choice:

environment variable MAYA_LICENSE='unlimited'



License file override:

environment variable MAYA_ALT_EN is not set


Then i did was this:

- I uninstalled everything i installed (every previous version of Maya)
- I deleted registry input in regedit for Autodesk
(used a program called RegSeeker)
- I deleted FLEXLM and FLEXnet
- Installed again Autodesk Maya 2011 previous downloaded from this torrent.

I hope i helped someone! :))"
