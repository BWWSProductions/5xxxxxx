also some of his episodes suck so much that you can't watch them so i have to skip to the next one"
,hopegone,2010-04-09T05:18Z,"please consider cross posting to USENET

better than torrent you need only provide the bandwidth for one copy once... and it stays online over 550 days

the least sucky client is jBinUp with native SSL support.... and optional full RAR/Par2 automation for batch jobs

,Splitter8,2010-04-11T07:28Z,"Hopegone, thanks for the tip on jBinUP, time permitting I'll see if I can get it on Usenet. Usenet & Newsgroups takes some effort to get up and running, not to mention good services are not exactly free.
Feel free to post this file on Usenet"

no worries.  my current environment does not allow posting to usenet :(

astraweb is $11/mo or $96/yr.  that includes SSL and 20 connections.  never patronize giganews: they spammed the web with usenet ads (rules 1&2).. but more importantly are WAY overpriced.

jbinup seems to be the only sensible, current, client with *built-in* ssl.  If there's something better I'd be delighted to find out.  hopefully a time will come when I can post to usenet.

Glenn Beck has repeatedly given permission to distribute his content on the internet AS long as that distribution is not-for-profit.  

At this point my contribution is informing others.

cheers
