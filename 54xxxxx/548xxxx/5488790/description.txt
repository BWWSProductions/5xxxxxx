The whole package is Forex Profit Accelerator, which includes Instant Pips and Forex Nitty Gritty. 

Requirements:
The EXE files will run a presentation. Some are flash (*.swf) files, where you'll need a flash enabled browser or player to view.

The author uses Meta-Trader 4 platform, and will probably require you to install some add-ons (included in this download). Meta-Trader download separately. This is required to get some technical indicators, if you can find substitutes, then good for you.

Final Note:
I would encourage anyone whom profited from this, to sign up for Profit Accelerator, for Bill Poulos' years of research and the construction of this package.

I will seed as long as I have excess monthly ISP bandwidth, so please be patient.
