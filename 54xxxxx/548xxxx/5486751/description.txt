Zemog originally seeded this, but due to the Microsoft Curse (Computer crash) was unable to continue seeding it. Seeing as there are over 115 leechers and no seeds, I managed to snag the missing 7% of files and recompile the torrent. So, I will seed this as much as I can, (Computer is off during the night 22:00-08:00 UCT), but I have a nice pipe to carry on the rest of the time.

Also, yes, the file is like 3MB. It's only After Effects pre-sets so... yeah.
