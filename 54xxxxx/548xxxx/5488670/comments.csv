,cinesimon,2010-04-10T02:11Z,"Cheers man that's very cool of you - there may not be a scene because the U.S screening has apparently been delayed due to golf or some such nonsense - so again, good on ya."

,bongboy,2010-04-10T03:25Z,"Thanks for uploading ths. The effort is appreciated. Even if it's poor quality, it's still better than nothing. I would like to make a correction, though. This cannot be from an HDTV source. This episode will not air on BBC HD until Monday night at 21:00."
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2010-04-10T04:36Z,"@ bongoboy!! your right, i just realized it was just standard bbciplayer bbc1 :( might explain the quality!! sorry!!"
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2010-04-10T04:45Z,"^^^^oops, bongboy!!! :D sorry!!"
