     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Wannabe girl band member Kelly McGlade takes her story to
      the Burnistoun Herald but ends up hitting more than just
      headlines.
      
     
     Notes.........                                                  
                                                       

      Capped this and forgot to pre it. Didn't get those two
      missing epsiodes unfortunately, so unless they show repeats,
      it's iplayer or nothing until the DVD is released.
