Blood Will Tell is the story of a boy betrayed -- a boy given up to demons in 48 parts for the promise of power. This child of fading humanity was abandoned by his father after the pact with darkness went awry. He was later found by a merciful and sympathetic inventor who blessed his broken body with a stunning array of half-magical prosthetics. Now his arms, legs, ears, and 42 other miscellaneous appendages and organs have been replaced with mechanical devices like detachable hands that hide built-in swords and knees that open to reveal devastating cannons. You take command of this reformed champion samurai and venture across many ancient lands to vanquish 48 demons and lesser-demons, all inspired by Japanese mythology. Your quest is to reclaim your humanity and reap the rewards of vengeance.
