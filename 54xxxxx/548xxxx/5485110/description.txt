Opie and Anthony April 7, 2010

The boys went late today and my source didn't get the end.  So, we will all have to catch Mothergoose56's upload later today to catch the end.
Sorry 'bout that folks.

**EDIT** Wow, I'm a tool.  I just actually listened to all of the end, rather than scanning through to find where to edit it.  The Boys kinda went late, but we got all of the show. I just scanned to far and hit a preview of a worst of and thought it was still the show. Like I said, oops, I'm a tool. The whole show is there.
