 When someone says â€œyou had to be thereâ€, never was a truer word spoken than in the case of The Sensational Alex Harvey Band. As good as the studio albums were, they couldnâ€™t possibly compete with seeing the band live. TSAHB had only released one album, Framed, when they went into the BBCâ€™s Paris Theatre to record their first In Concert performance in 1972. This was the start of a series of recordings for the BBC radio and BBC television that captured the band at their very best. Live at the BBC features unreleased versions of tracks from the peak of the bandâ€™s success and includes an unreleased version of the hit single "Delilah" alongside a storming cover of Sly Stoneâ€™s "Dance to the Music".
