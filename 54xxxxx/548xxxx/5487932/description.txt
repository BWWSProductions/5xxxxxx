    Jimmy Doherty goes behind the scenes at the Natural        
    History Museum to discover the lengths people go to to    
    add new and rarely studied species to the collection. A  
    colossal squid turns up at the museum, a team of          
    scientists push through unexplored jungle in Panama and    
    a pioneering project finds a new species at the bottom    
    of the sea off the coast of Sweden.
