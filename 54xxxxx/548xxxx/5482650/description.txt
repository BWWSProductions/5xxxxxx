A Touch of Frost ITV1
Monday 5th April on ITV1 from 9:00pm to 11:00pm If Dogs Run Free (Part 2)

The second in a two-part story which closes the book on this long-running series.

The past is catching up with Frost in more ways than one as a series of copycat 
crimes convinces Superintendent Mullett that his veteran DI's life is in danger.
There are now two killers to bring to justice, but that will not happen until 
tragedy strikes. 

With David Jason, Bruce Alexander, John Lyons, Phyllis Logan, and Adrian Dunbar.
