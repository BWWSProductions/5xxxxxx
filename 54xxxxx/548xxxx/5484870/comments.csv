,amcnm,2010-04-10T00:55Z,2nd half not working ?
,STARATOM,2010-04-10T02:58Z,"THERE IS A MAJOR FLAW IN THIS UPLOAD.

FIRST HALF IS FINE, BUT WHEN YOU GET TO THE SECOND HALF, YOU GET THE FOLLOWING ERROR

CaviStreamSyth: System exception - Access violation at 0x6fb515f3, reading from 0x1197ffda

Note: I HAVE RECEIVED THIS SAME MESSAGE IN THE SECOND HALF WITH: KMPLAYER, VLC PLAYER AND MEDIA PLAYER CLASSIC.

IN THE SECOND HALF YOU GET THE ABOVE NAMED ERROR MESSAGE THE TOP OF YOUR SCREEN, BUT THE AUDIO IS PERFECTLY FINE, EVEN IF YOU JUMP BACK TO THE FIRST HALF IT'S PERFECT, ONLY THE SECOND IS FLAWED.
ALSO I DELETED THE FIRST EXTRACTION, AS I THOUGHT IT COULD BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS, BUT WHEN I UNPACKED THE RAR FILES AGAIN, I WAS MET WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS.

PLEASE COULD YOU UPLOAD THIS AGAIN BUT WITH THE SECOND HALF CORRECTED.
AND I WILL CONTINUE TO UPLOAD TO A PERSONAL RATIO OF 5.000

I AM ALREADY UPLOADING THIS, BUT IS THER ANY POINT IN UPLOADING A FAULTY VIDEO FILE ???????????????"
,footybooty,2010-04-11T06:45Z,2nd half does not work. Thanks anyway.
