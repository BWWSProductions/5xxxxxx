,Malakka,2010-04-05T19:37Z,"I do agree! Download VLC if you have any problems watching movies in WMP or any other program. 
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ 

Also, make sure that you have codecs up-to-date 
Go to: http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_lite_codec_pack.htm and chose ""K-Lite Codec Pack Full""
I have never ever had any problems with those files. I convert them from ""avi"" to ""mpeg"", just to be able to use my DVD-player (the one on the TV). It's an old bastard, but I love it. 
(Nevertheless, the avi-file works fine on my computer). 

@ staffordshirebull
At http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pacific_%28miniseries%29 you can read that part 5 is out on the 11:th of April. So just hang on. ;)

Happy Easter - what's left of it!  "

,Holeraw,2010-04-05T20:38Z,ez rocks... Keep up the great work!!!
,hdhcst95,2010-04-05T21:07Z,New episodes are aired on Sundays on HBO. This is the best episode they've yet released and I hope this means that future episodes will be just as amazing. Brilliant episode! I give a shit about the characters now!
,Malakka,2010-04-05T21:37Z,"I've seeded 2,3 now - and I will return tomorrow if the rate is low. Gotta to game now. 

LOVE!"

Next week, duh. "
,honunet,2010-04-06T04:34Z,"Episode was shit.  But thanks for the up all the same.  Easily the worst of the show so far.  the obsession with Private Lucky so far is astonishing.  If the attempt is to show the war from several points of view, they have succeeded only in showing what prvt Lucky thinks of the war.  And Australia. And his girlfriend. W are near the midpoint and I would really like to get to know some of the other characters before they are dead.  IMO only! Thank you! ::takes bow swirls cape::"
,honunet,2010-04-06T04:36Z,I think HBO Canada mutes curse words.  So if thats where he is getting it then.. might want to think about changing location
,terafirma,2010-04-06T05:15Z,"Hey, what's with the FLVDirect Player download requirement? A normal WMV should play on WMP with no extra software? I get this popup telling me I need third party software to play on WMP or on REALplyr. I've never seen anything like it - it's not a missing codec prompt from the players, it's a third party pop-up. The pop-up comes from free-license.imgpop.com, when I google that I find http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090528065221AAB3EQ6 which says previx found the software is cloaked malware. 

When I play it on VLC I also get 4 seconds of fuzz then zilch, as below.

Please explain why and how this pop-up comes. If a VIP is not trustworthy, the whole TPB rating system is compromised. Thanks."

,friik,2010-04-15T01:46Z,To all you people having problems! Download VLC. Just google it. VLC has its own codecs. I have never in 3-4 years had to download a codec to play anything from piratebay. Just forget about WMP and go with vlc. Your life will be easier.
