,Strikefear13,2010-04-07T20:21Z,Except this IS the actual leaked SP1 beta.  Downloading now.  Thanks for the upload!
,the_rist,2010-04-07T20:57Z,is worth for download? or wait.
,Sven the swede,2010-04-07T21:30Z,"Well, this is just a few updates so it would probably not hurt to give it a go."
,narcarsiss,2010-04-08T13:53Z,"It's Real and my gosh is it fast, the new memory managment and the fix to the pagfile has spead my system up well quite a lot"
,the_rist,2010-04-09T19:17Z,so my w7 broken and i was try that sp1 and one that what sp1 was computer rate'ing etc xD tnx :)
,Sven the swede,2010-04-09T23:57Z,I noticed a few minor bugs but other than that everything seems okay. It seems like the latest Catalyst drivers have some problem with the file. My suggestion is to backup your system if you need to restore it. I haven't really noticed any speed improvement but everything seems fast and good like before I installed it. The real advantage is probably all the updates that came with this.

THANKS!"
,bombertonforty,2010-04-28T12:31Z,"Interesting upload . . Installs OK, with no apparent WGA shit

Although, a small notice has appeared at the bottom right of my desktop .. 

""Evaluation Copy 7601"" this wasn't there before,

Time Bomb perhaps ??"
,veritasaequita,2010-05-02T00:58Z,"To get rid of the new watermark that this adds at bottom right corner of desktop just google for WAT Remover, 1 click run that shit, problem solved."
,daRPiniOn,2010-06-10T11:23Z,"Can anyone let me know some of the features that come with this?  If it isn't really cool then it isn't even worth the trouble of downloading/installing.

thanks in advance!"
,akshayj,2011-02-16T13:08Z,"Well, if you guys have automatic updates On, then this sh!t is not going to have any significant affect on the PC.

Anyways, nice way to save time after format/reinstall.

Fuck goes to MS !"
