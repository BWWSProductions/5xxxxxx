                    In an attempt to build up some confidence, Ian  
                    joins the local boxing club and quickly strikes  
                    up a friendship with the owner, Jock. But when  
                    the club faces closure due to Jock's debt with  
                    Paddy, Ian enlists Maxine, Carl and Chesney to  
                    help raise funds. However, it soon becomes  
                    clear that Ian has stumbled into a hornet's  
                    nest of unfinished business between Paddy and  
                    Jock. Meanwhile, a moment of heroism prompts  
                    Micky to apply for a job with the fire service,  
                    but during the assessment he is weighed down by  
                    a familiar spectre of doubt. Returning a  
                    failure, he feels wounded, but his handling of  
                    a life-threatening emergency proves that he  
                    deserves respect. At the Gallaghers', Libby's  
                    biological clock is in overdrive and to Frank's  
                    utter horror, she makes it clear she wants to  
                    have children of her own before it's too late.  
                    Elsewhere, Liam is targeted by bullies, while  
                    Karen sets up a 'Chatsworth's Got Talent' night  
                    at The Jockey. Ricky Hatton appears as himself.
