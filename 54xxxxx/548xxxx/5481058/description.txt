About this game:
Create a musical masterpiece with up to four players. Anyone can play the huge selection of instruments in Wii Music with simple motionsâ€”like strumming and drumming. It's easy to play improv jams. Musicians in your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heartâ€™s content. Play faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more. No matter what you do, Wii Music automatically transforms your improv stylings into great music. There are no mistakesâ€”just playing for the pure joy of playing. Wii controls immerse you in the music. You can play most of the 60-plus instruments in Wii Music using simple motions with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers. Strum to play guitar, banjo and sitar. Drum to play jazz drums, congas and marching drums. Hammer away to play piano, vibraphone and marimba. Unlike most music games, Wii Music doesnâ€™t make you use complex buttons. You only need to imitate playing the instrument.
