Do I need any special hardware to use this?"
[V],r3dcat,2010-04-05T09:34Z,"@uggenabben: No, no special hardware required other than chipped or soft modded Wii ... You can play the .wbfs file directly from a FAT32 or NTFS partitioned USB drive ... or extract/convert .wbfs file to an .iso file and burn to disc if you prefer ... I recommend using Configurable USB Loader for playing/loading games (http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638)"
,uggenabben,2010-04-05T11:33Z,"Thanks r3dcat for your quick reply! 
I am using USB Loader GX. And have my stuff on a WBFS formated drive (will hence need to convert these to ISO). 
Configurable USB Loader looks great. I will install that later to test. Thanks for the advice."
[V],r3dcat,2010-04-05T12:35Z,@uggenabben: You can use Wii Backup Manager to transfer/copy the .wbfs file to a WBFS formated drive directly without having to convert to .iso ;)
,uggenabben,2010-04-05T17:01Z,"I was not aware of that.... I normally use WBFS Manager... Used Wii Backup Manager to transfer ""Crossbow"" to my wbfs drive and it worked very well. All your games worked well on the Wii. '
Thanks again(for the info and the U/L)! "

,Bootsystem47,2010-07-11T14:21Z,"Oh, I forgot. Do I need a special Disc other than the CD-R. My nero refused to copy but requested for DVD L, DVD R/RW.rnrnNightmare scenario!!rnrnPlse help!!!!"
