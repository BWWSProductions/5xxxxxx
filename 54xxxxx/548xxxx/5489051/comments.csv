,garb77,2010-04-11T16:32Z,can someone upload it with swedish subs
,str1ka1,2010-12-22T01:31Z,"This is a BULLSHIT version of this movie. First it starts overdubbed in ENGLISH then changes to French. It is also NOT the unrated version. The unrated version shows the father being fully decapitated, SHOWS the kid being shot and shows much more of the razor bat killing. Dont advertise uncut when its NOT"

,vivatpb5776,2011-06-18T13:09Z,"Okay, I have the uncut DVD version of this movie (burned from Netflix version). In the version I have, the father's head is shown being decapitated.

More importantly, in the version I have, the resolution is in WIDE SCREEN. I didn't even bother viewing this version since the screen resolution is FULL SCREEN (720*540). Just for shits and giggles, I checked this version and sure enough, the scene where the father's head is decapitated is cut.

Even though I do not appreciate his approach, I agree with str1ka1. Don't advertise something as uncut when it clearly is edited."
