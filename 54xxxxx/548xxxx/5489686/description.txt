This is the "hard to get" beta version of WindowShadeX 5.0 beta (windowshade-x-50b2) for Snow Leopard 10.6.x that's normaly only avaliable if you are autorized BY THEM to follow their Twitter feed :(hummm, by the way they do not allow many people...).

You may also read their blog and user comments here : http://www.unsanity.org/archives/betas/betas_twitter_and_wtf.php 

I use this beta version on several 10.6.3 Macs and it WORKS GREAT !

Unfortunately I can't give a serial but you may use your own "old" one (as I do) or another user may post one that's functionnal in the comments

I've not tried a SerialBox serial but some may work, keep us informed in comments.

Enjoy !

EDIT 1 : just realized that there is unfortunately no serial for WindowShadeX in the SerialBox "package"...

If someone could provide one here, in comments, it would be much appreciated by a lot of people !
