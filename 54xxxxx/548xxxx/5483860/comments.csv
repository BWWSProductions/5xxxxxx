,RoyalG,2010-04-26T08:11Z,How do I write to DVD 9? i have DVD+R DL. what do i need to write the English Voice version? help
,futureicon23,2010-04-30T08:53Z,"Thank you for this thenoobish, but for some reason, after around chapter 5 (or chapter 6?) the screne blacks out when trying to resume the game from the 'eye check' menu. This is the Japanese audio disc I'm using. Can anybody solve this problem please?"
,futureicon23,2010-05-02T10:11Z,"Just to help you guess if you encountered the same problem that I had. Patch the game first with ""Toxic Dual Layer Image Patcher v1.0"" first before burning. :)"
,Hamayumi,2010-05-06T03:42Z,"Yay! Thank you, TheNoobish~ (^-^)

Been looking for this perfect version of Sakura Wars on PS2, and you have it! Really, thanks, I appreciate it!

My Rom supports Dual Layer burning, do I have to use certain applications before burning? I have Magic I.S.O.

Sorry, I'm kinda clueless on this stuff. (>."
,hank266,2010-05-08T13:53Z,can you rip them to ordinary dvd. I cant burn dvd9
,Hamayumi,2010-05-12T04:13Z,"Guys, will this work if I installed this on my PS2 HDD?"
,issicus,2010-05-19T13:58Z,most likely not.  you should be able to find a list of supported games for hdadvanced google.
,RazgrizX,2010-07-28T21:57Z,"Worked Perfectly!
You have my gratitude for this torrent. 
I loved Sakura Taisen Series.

For those who does not know how to make it playable just do the following.

1.Use Toxic Dual Layer Patch to patch your ISO.
2.Burn Patched ISO with your favorite software. (I recommend Alcohol120% or DVD Decrypter.)

WARNING!
This game must burn to DVD9 only. Seperating ISO Image and burn it to 2 Discs of DVD5 will render it unreadable by your PS2.

DVD9 is DVD Dual Layer
DVD5 is DVD Single Layer

I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU USE A ""DVD DASH R Dual Layer"" (DVD-R DL) instead of DVD+R DL because DVD+R DL is not supported by some PS2.

Just cuz your PS2 reads DVD+R doesn't mean it can reads DVD+R DL.

Hav Fun! ^^"
,matux99,2011-04-17T18:14Z,"is it possible to just download .iso with the English audio? will the game work? please someone reply i need to know...
 thanks"
,saifssj6,2011-05-31T18:39Z,the game did work fine and i did patch it with toxic dll patcher 1.0.bUT I GET THE BLAK SCREEN AFTER CHAPTER SIX I THINK....IS THERE A SOLUTION PLZ HELP
,shikibane,2011-06-02T21:40Z,RazgrizX doesn't know what he's saying must be burned to a dvd9 to work that's not true if you use GNIE'S ISO REBUILDER it works just fine from dvd-5 on esr and with swap magic yeah gnies tool is a tiny bit time consuming but it beats buying a dl dvd. Anyways thank you thenoobish works great.
,mikuruz,2012-04-12T22:15Z,"can i ask who use GNIE'S ISO REBUILDER ,
