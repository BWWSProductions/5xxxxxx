Something dark & evil is growing in Halloweentown & Aggie wants help to defeat it. While Aggie & Gwen are arguing, Aggie uses magic which Marnie observes. After Aggie leaves to return to Halloweentown, Marnie, Dylan and, unknown to Marnie and Dylan, Sophie follow her onto the return bus. Soon afterwards, Gwen follows the children to Halloweentown. While there, Aggie & Gwen are attacked by the dark force in a movie theater. Marnie, Dylan & Sophie race to get the ingredients to activate Merlin's Wand to stop the evil. The evil reveals itself to be Halloweentown Mayor Kalabar. Assisted by Kalabar's former henchman, Luke, Marnie installs Merlin's Wand into the town square pumpkin, freeing all those who were under Kalabar's sell in the theater. But Kalabar isn't finished yet. He telekenetically yanks Merlin's Wand out of the pumpkin. Aggie, Gwen, Marnie, Dylan & Sophie combine powers & destroy him. In the end, Aggie decides to stay with Gwen & the kids for the year & Gwen says SHE will train Marnie.
