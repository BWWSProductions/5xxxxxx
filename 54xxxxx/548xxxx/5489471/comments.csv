Very nice work.
cheers"
,Jedor,2010-04-16T22:57Z,"Jesus Christ what a crappy piece of software! It can't even run a simple DVD on an i5, 2GB RAM PC, with a 512MB graphics card, without dropping frames and chopping its way through playback. I've never liked PowerDVD but I had hopes of improvement at this stage. Well, think again...

This is not a knock on ADHDerby who is doing a great job, only on the actual piece of shit software. Thank you again CyberLink...

Amazing that I haven't found a better DVD-player than my old WinDVD 4. Are the software developers retards???"
,KaptinCapo,2010-04-18T05:41Z,So easy to install thanks man.
,esmartuek,2010-04-20T19:27Z,"@Jedor- 
*all* HD content is going to require more than 2GB of ram if you're trying to push it on a 1080p resolution. It's not the software's fault you went cheap on the most critical component of your system. Read up on content requirements before you go bitching about this stuff. Not even NBC Direct will play well on just 2GB of ram. 
There's your issue.

,tisemann,2010-04-23T00:00Z,"Awesome work, ADHDerby!

Does the 1601 patch work on this? Or will you  make a new preactivated version?"
[T],ADHDerby,2010-04-23T09:47Z,"You're welcome! :)

You can safely update all my releases, the only con is that it will ask to register.
Just enter a phony name + email address, and the register reminder won't popup anymore."
,arranculus,2010-05-02T18:22Z,Thank you. Simple and clean installation with useful extra tweaks. 
,kreem,2010-05-02T18:47Z,"@esmartuek - thats bullshit.  I've got a vaio laptop with a built-in bluray drive and up until powerdvd 9, bluray movies played fine.  'upgraded' to ver 9 and got choppy playback - I expect it will be the same with this version as well.  I'm currently using Intervideo Windvd BD to play my bluray movies and it works like a charm, so your theory is bullshit."
,dman1812,2010-05-02T18:48Z,"Thanks for the upload.
Any chance of getting the next release with Skins like you used to?"
,Dilldog,2010-05-03T00:06Z,"LOL!!

The downloading speed is incredible! 1.3 MEGABIT per sec! Took me 30 sec!

Ty man! :D"
,gmdb55,2010-05-03T16:46Z,"Thank you very much ADHDerby.
This is incredible, works beautifully.
Thanks to the seeders, what a down load speed!!!"
,g0dsize,2010-05-04T18:32Z,"Works very well, thanks!

@ Jedor - you need more RAM, period.  It's the cheapest, single best upgrade for any rig."
,alishan123,2010-05-07T06:01Z,"thanxxx aloooot man
