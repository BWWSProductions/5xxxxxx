,drcat125,2010-04-08T23:18Z,Bone is trust worthy but I hope this is not the same missed up one again
,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2010-04-08T23:26Z,Well comment on the quality please. And maybe a screen shot would also be nice.
,belgie,2010-04-09T00:22Z,"Seems to be the same version that's doing the rounds, at different file sizes.

CAM was positioned in the upper left part of the cinema. Not much audience noise, to speak of.

The picture frame is slightly squished to 4:3 but no obvious cropping problems with the larger picture.

Some commenters are mentioning that the film jumps a lot, but I'm using VLC and not noticing this at all.

A/V = 7/7 (Seems about right)"
,bms1a1,2010-04-09T01:40Z,"This one works! Plays all the way through, no skips."
,Jonathan.Bacon,2010-04-09T02:29Z,"Im very used to cam quality torrents but calling this a A7 V7 is just a lie. First of all the video looks like a low quality VHS tape that had been taped over then retaped again. Its just awful, ive seen so many better cams. Shes out of my League was an amazing quality cam. Hell I thought it was a DVD rip until someone stood up and their shadow appeared in front of Jay Baruchel's head. 

Even being very liberal with my rating I say V4 A6"
,indyfreelancer03,2010-04-09T17:12Z,"This audio is way outta sync with the movie (like 10 seconds off). Video/ 6 audio/4, "
,belgie,2010-04-09T18:40Z,"No, I'd stand by the 7/7 rating, with 10 being a DVD Rip. And the audio isn't out of sync either.

I've watched a lot of cam rips, and there have been MANY worse than this. If you gave this a 4/5 then what the hell would you have given the cam version of COP OUT which was going around recently? That was 2/2 on my scale. Surely you'd have to go to negative numbers or something."
,Jonathan.Bacon,2010-04-10T04:56Z,"@ belgie... Thats why they call it an opinion you insignificant douche bag, because everyone's is different. In my opinion its a V4 A7 and I stand by that. Even the Book of Eli cam was better than this garbage and that had some of the most difficult lighting for a cam through out the last year. 

Next time leave your opinion and lay off of everyone elses...asshole"
,RaandJ04,2010-04-10T06:32Z,Tsk Tsk why the hostility?? Thanks for the ratings
,buseyslovechild,2010-04-10T09:22Z,"i'd say A/V 6

it's nowhere near DVD quality, but it's better than nothing. and it's fucking free!

people need to quit bitching so much..."
,pentagraham,2010-04-10T09:56Z,lol at the audience groaning at opening scene. thats all i got so far
,ANGE11,2010-04-11T09:24Z,thanks bone...
