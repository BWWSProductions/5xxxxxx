The first album from the dutch hiphop/remix/mashup trio "The Q4" named "Sound Surroundings", ripped in 320kbps quality.


TheQ4 - the QuadraphoniQuartet.

The Q4 is a collaboration of three young Dutch producers: Arts the Beatdoctor, Sense and STW. Whom all, though they work in rather similar ways, have a unique sound of their own.

The (at the time 4 men) crew was formed in a sleazy, dark bar in Amsterdam during the fourth quarter of 2005; And have since then created an impressive amount of material together, coloured by a wide range of musical influences and artistic collaborations.

As apposed to continually repeating a loop, theQ4 compose their tracks practically note-by-note by making collages of hundreds of dusty little samples and percussion hits taken from vinyl. Sometimes adding material recorded with session musicians giving the whole record a very organic feel to it.

Due to this way of working, the amount of samples used and the time invested into each composition, listening to the record is an experience similar to listening to a movie sound track.
