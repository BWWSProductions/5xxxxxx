""The Parts in the Sum of the Whole"

The milestone 100th episode of BONES takes viewers back in time six 
years as Brennan and Booth recount the first case they worked on 
together. With Sweets finishing his book on their partnership, 
Brennan and Booth take this opportunity to set the record straight. 
A young and rebellious FBI Agent Booth seeks the help of an team of 
anthropological scientists and a street artist to find the evidence 
that will prove his high-profile suspect guilty. Although in 
unfamiliar territory, Dr. Brennan, her grad student Zack (guest 
star Millegan) and Hodgins get right to work, impressing Booth with 
their knack for uncovering new leads and substantiating his theory 
about a well-connected district judge. While the case cements a 
foundation for a successful future partnership, it also reveals the 
convoluted romantic beginnings of the formidable duo whose feelings 
for each other almost destroyed the team but still linger years 
later.

Enjoy :)
