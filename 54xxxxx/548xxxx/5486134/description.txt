Not just for Logo Design !

printing. Logos, banners, buttons, headers and icons for your website with rich colors, gradients, shadows
and reflections. Business graphics such as business cards, letterheads, posters and other business stationery

The choice of objects and templates in this logo maker caters to a variety of businesses in most any industry, such
as Technology, Finances, Healthcare, General Business and Retail, Education and Training, Travel and Tourism,
Organizations, Sports and Fitness, Food and Beverage. Each object is carefully researched and concepted for a
particular business type

Create professional, high resolution images in clicks

Now, anyone, regardless of creative ability, can blend shapes and text into an impressive logo in a few clicks.
Just choose a logo layout you like from the collection of pre-build templates, edit the elements of the logo,
add your business name and slogan. And finally, apply some styling. Thatâ€™s it. Now, you can export the logo project
for printing or for the Web. In addition to pre-build logo templates, you can make logos by yourself from scratch

Get started without having to open a manual

Sit down and bang out a high quality professional-looking logo after a few minutes of learning. The program is
intuitive enough to figure out what it does without the need to read a 1000-page user manual. Just start choosing
logo templates, pushing buttons and toggling sliders. After half an hour you may find yourself with a logo that
makes you look like a logo design star!

Get a lean, slim business graphics design machine

Avoid technological fluff youâ€™ll never need. Modern hi-end graphic editors tend to be so packed with features that
learning how to use the application becomes a subject comparable to learning a programming language. Besides, all
these editors offer you too many never-to-be-used features and tools that add ballast to your life and hundreds of
dollars to the price tag. With this easy to use business graphics / logo creator, you get a lean, slim graphics design
machine for a small fee
