This release is a fully free Ubuntu 9.10 derivative that includes extra software, better multimedia support, more translations and a faster configuration. For this release we used Ext4 for the root filesystem and XFS for the home one, to have a balance between speed and usability. Some important features include a much faster boot process and the ability to encrypt the home directory.

All packages were updated, including:

    * Linux-libre kernel 2.6.31
    * Xorg 7.4
    * GNOME 2.28
    * OpenOffice.org 3.1.1
    * Mozilla based Web Browser 3.5
