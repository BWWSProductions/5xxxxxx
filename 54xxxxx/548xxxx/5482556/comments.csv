,Desolator4u,2010-04-06T05:50Z,Got this somewhere else and it didn't work on my RTM version. Will try this torrent none-the-less.
,Smorgan,2010-04-06T06:02Z,Keep in mind though that I wanted to wait until everything was good to go if you have any trouble please refer to the Troubleshooting guide that is built into the activation document...Give the Re-Activator a shot if your having problems...
,Smorgan,2010-04-06T06:07Z,I really wouldn't be suprised all that much if this worked with the beta's of office 2010...However if you have any further problems please fill me in and I'll give it my best shot as well as the build version... There are lots of builds out there...
,Smorgan,2010-04-07T09:30Z,Feedback wanted...

,el_thompson,2010-04-09T11:01Z,"calm down kids... these cracks haven't worked anyway. Tried em all, re-activated, uninstalled etc etc - no joy.

Any idea where there IS a fully working version?"

,Smorgan,2010-04-09T11:05Z,All the cracks out there and there are 2 main ones use a KMS or a key switch from the beta build...
,Smorgan,2010-04-09T11:08Z,However I can make one surmise and a guess of sort for you  el_thompson which is that your not running the hack as admin... Please comment so I can fix u up thou... 
,el_thompson,2010-04-09T11:09Z,"er... its not activated. That means its not working, surely"
,Smorgan,2010-04-09T11:11Z,"Ok run Command prompt as admin and type this in...
cscript ""%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Office\Office14\ospp.vbs"" /dstatus

this will bring up the activation status for office 2010..."
,el_thompson,2010-04-09T11:12Z,"haha! Of course I'm running it as Admin! Doesn't matter anyway, found a clean fully activated copy elsewhere... good effort tho! Do me a favour and have a crack at Waves v7 for the PC RTAS please ;-)"
,el_thompson,2010-04-09T11:20Z,A Waves plugin bundle hasn't been around since v5... they're now on 7. A Mac version has turned up but not PC... 
,el_thompson,2010-04-09T11:32Z,"Nice one... believe me, if you do, you'll be in a godlike position..."

,Smorgan,2010-04-09T17:45Z,Funny I thought it didn't need a restart ooo damn thats why ugh... I know why it wouldn't work and u needed a restart... I never put the command in to restart the Office protection service...I never thought to put that in...
,Smorgan,2010-04-09T17:51Z,"Apologizes a single line of code was taken out which resulted in your troubles... This code will fix your troubles by opening CMD as admin...
