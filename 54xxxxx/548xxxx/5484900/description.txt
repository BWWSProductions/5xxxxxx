Release Name: Symantec.Norton.Ghost.v15.0.Incl.Keymaker-CORE




Norton Ghost provides advanced backup and recovery for your computer. Protect your documents, financial records, presentations, photos, music, videos, historical documents, or any other kinds of data you keep on your computer by making a backup of your computerâ€™s entire hard disk. Or, limit your backup to include only those files and folders that mean the most to you. You can schedule backups to capture your changes automatically as you work from day to day. Or start a backup manually at any time. You can also easily configure Norton Ghost to run a backup in response to specific events. For example, a backup can be started when a particular application is started, or when a specified amount of new data has been added to the drive.

Here are some key features:

    * Cold Imaging lets you back up files without installing Ghost.
    * Blu-ray Disc allows you to back up large amounts of data to high-capacity Blu-ray Disc â€” up to 25 GB per disc (50 GB dual-layer).
    * Windows 7 support including support for Bitlocker provides enhanced data protection through drive encryption and integrity checking.
    * Symantec ThreatCon integration leverages intelligence from Symantecâ€™s industry-leading security research organization to automatically backup files whenever ThreatCon reaches a specified threat level.
    * Full system (disk image) backup lets you easily backup everything on a hard drive or partition.
    * File and folder backup lets you back up only the files and folders you choose, rather than backing up and entire disk.
    * File backup search finds and backs up only the types of files you choose, such as photos, MP3 files, and documents.
    * Incremental backup copies only files that have changed for fewer, faster backups.
    * Customizable, event-based backup triggers backups based on key events, such as when you install a new program or when there are sudden increases in data storage.
