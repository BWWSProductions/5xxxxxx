Anyway, HUGE PROPS to DORMINE for this server emulator. I can get past the Animus without a problem.

The funniest is, there isn't even a crack. There's no need. You also don't have to create a ubisoft username/password.

Can't ask for a better way around that crap Ubishit has pulled on gamers.

download the emulator there.(you may dload this torrent..but i don't know whether this works or not)
then u will find an attachment find values.db at the same page.
download it..replace the one at your emulator with this one...run server.exe to play(do remember to edit your host file)...
u can play till sequence 12..and don't worry..by the time you complete sequence 12, a newer file will be there..keep on checking this site."

,jan765,2010-04-06T00:02Z,"Hello. I just installed the crack today though I don't have the full game. I don't know which torrent I should download for the full game.

Should I download...

--Assassins.Creed.2.MULTi9.Cracked.EMU-SPiRE

or

Assassins Creed 2 [Multi9] [PCDVD9][WITH CRACK] 
??

The 2nd one i provided apparently has more seeders than the 1st link. Though, the instructions in this torrent seems to be based on the first link.

Does it matter which game copy I download?
Is it ok to download the multi9 pcdvd, and then use this emulator?

I am currently downloading the full game [the 2nd link].

Also, for those people who said they've been playing for 2 hours, or 2 days, does it really work? I mean, how about the saves? Can we save our game?
Does it stop at a certain sequence or is this like the perfect work around for the drm?"

,jan765,2010-04-06T02:41Z,"@skzZ

 Hello and thank you for the reply.
By ""it works perfectly"", can you guarantee that it will work as well as having the real game?
Is this crack fully functional and I will not get stuck in a certain sequence?

**Can I play the game without internet?**
This question is also regarding the legitimate users: Can the players who bought the game use this crack and play their game without internet?"
,raviraj87,2010-04-06T02:52Z,"Definitely you can play this game without the internet as i played it yesterday disconnecting my connection. Carefully follow the instructions. Though I was at Sequence 1 (as i hv waited for the proper crack till now) but the game goes on smoothly without any of the previous problems. So enjoy this excellent game.
Hats Off to the crackers for this AWESOME job. May GOD bless you all.
One thing i tell you i have ubisoftgamelauncher of version 1.0.0.106 but it ain't a problem."

Thanks for the tips =]
I am still downloading the game though.

And this is not a crack right? Just to confirm.

It basically is a program that creates a fake server that runs in my PC?
"
,jan765,2010-04-06T03:00Z,"@raviraj87

And yes, how do you save? Is it *automatically* stored in ""my documents"" like other games?
I mean just like the first AC, it autosaved and there is no ""quick save"" feature.

So the game saves itself"

I had installed the game before and created an official account. So when I launched the game it automatically signed in. Then I played for an hour and quit. When I launched the game again and went to story mode there was no save game.

I know the game auto saves but for many people it is not even creating a savegame.

Please those who are able to save tell how do you do it? Do you require a save game (probably from the beginning)

I am also getting this problem.

1) Uninstall Everything. Use some uninstaller like Revo.

2) Install the game from clone DVD.

3) Apply the original patch v1.01

4) Append the ""hosts"" file as instructed.

5) Extract this DRM server to anywhere. (Its up to you. I extracted in My Documents).

6) Run server.exe as administrator (or better to change its compatibility to run as administrator).

7) Run AssassinsCreed.exe to update.

8) When its complete you will see Launch Game appears in that window.

9) Launch the game and log in to play it.

10) Next time you can use AssassinsCreedGame.exe for running the game.


That's it...... Its so simple!!!

,jan765,2010-04-08T06:39Z,"@bremster.

Uninstall anything related to AC2.
1. Uninstall from control panel.
2. Make sure Ubisoft folder doesnt exist anymore
3. Uninstall Ubisoft Game Launcher
4. Make sure none of it exists. Even folders.

This will let you install a new fresh copy of the game!!

So now, just follow instructions EXACTLY. I will restate what is on the description.

1. Mount and Install the game wherever you got it.    I used: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5412697/Assassins_Creed_2_%5BMulti9%5D_%5BPCDVD9%5D%5BWITH_CRACK%5D

2. When the game is installed and its finished, simply run the game normally.

3. The game will auto update. It will download patch 1.01. It will ask you if you want to install the update. YES install 1.01 you need it.

4. Wait for it to finish, blabla, the game will try to run, but will fail. (for now).

5. Simply close the game if its still running. Basically just make sure game launcher and ac2 are not running.

6. Edit the hosts as stated. Then save it and close.

7. Finished!! *You dont need to do that ipconfig stuff unless you are getting the error. But you wont*

8. Start Server.exe EVERYTIME before you start the game.

9. completely done :) No need for internet to play the game too!!!


**The Values.db in this version seems to be ""defected"". When you reach *Tomb 5* you cannot trigger the tombs! Thus you will get stuck. It happened to me and I found someone post a link of the new values.db
Here it is!!! ***

[I named it as optional because maybe you won't get the problem. But I know everyone did so just do it anyways]. The game functions fine even with original, its just that with this you won't get stuck.

OPTIONAL: Update your Values.db from here:
http://ac2clearing.whotookspaz.org/?do=goodpairs
[This is already the download link. So when you paste the download will start.]
- Back up the original values.db
- Replace it with this.

When you change the graphics settings from low or high, it doesnt matter 0_o. The lag is the same 0.o. Which is weird. I tried different settings. Low and Max.
Low just makes my mouse more unresponsive and less smooth.
Max is the same, but smoother mouse =.=

weird :P

I'm sorry for the late reply.
Values.db is in the DRM folder by default. You can put the DRM folder wherever you want and run the server.exe from there.

Basically, Server.exe is the crack. Values.db is the ""information"" that let's you play the game :)

Happy gaming!"
,jan765,2010-04-08T21:29Z,"To Everyone:

I forgot to add this to my instructions So I will re-post my instructions.

========================

**Make sure this is a fresh [Unpatched/Uncracked] game. Basically Install it and leave it alone**

**Instructions for a clean copy**
If you installed AC2 before and its not working:
Uninstall anything related to AC2.
1. Uninstall from control panel.
2. Make sure Ubisoft folder doesnt exist anymore
3. Uninstall Ubisoft Game Launcher
4. Make sure none of it exists. Even folders.

==So now it doesn't exist anywhere on your computer==

---Installing the game + Emulator Crack---

1. Mount and Install the game wherever you got it. I used: (It doesn't necessarily be this)
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5412697/Assassins_Creed_2_%5BMulti9%5D_%5BPCDVD9%5D%5BWITH_CRACK%5D

2. When the game is installed and its finished, simply run the game **normally**

3. The game will auto update. It will download patch 1.01. It will ask you if you want to install the update. YES install 1.01 [you need it.]

4. Wait for it to finish, blabla, the game will try to run, but will fail. (for now).

5. Simply close the game if its still running. Basically just make sure game launcher and ac2 are not running.

6. Now, unrar the ""drm"" folder you download from this torrent. You can put it anywhere. The DRM folder contains ALL YOU NEED to run the game.--- Edit the hosts as stated. Then save it and close.

7. Keep in mind: You DO NOT need to do the ipconfig crap unless you are getting an error but I'm sure you won't if you do the instructions EXACTLY.

8. Start Server.exe EVERYTIME before you start the game.

9. completely done :) No need for internet to play the game too!!!


**The Values.db in this version seems to be ""defected"". When you reach *Tomb 5* you cannot trigger the tombs! Thus you will get stuck. It happened to me and I found someone post a link of the new values.db
Here it is!!! ***

[I named it as optional because maybe you won't get the problem. But I know everyone did so just do it anyways]. The game functions fine even with original, its just that with this you won't get stuck.

OPTIONAL: Update your Values.db from here:
http://ac2clearing.whotookspaz.org/?do=goodpairs
[This is already the download link. So when you paste the download will start.]
- Back up the original values.db
- Replace it with this.


FULL WORKING GAME I PROMISE or else I like to suck fishsticks in my mouth and lick fishballs and I'm a gay fish ;) "
,jan765,2010-04-08T21:35Z,"This game has NO CD KEYS because the developers feel all mighty with they're little DRM. Don't believe the trolls saying that it asks for a CD KEY.

****With this emulator crack, you can run the game WITHOUT internet*****

Actually, I think you should turn off internet before playing so that if Ubisoft releases a patch 1.02, it won't install, or else it might break the crack.

==This is also USABLE by legit owners of the game!!!== Now Ubisoft cannot limit your purchased product. You may now play anywhere! :)


***THE GAME IS SAVED AUTOMATICALLY****
You don't need to worry!!! You just load your game and its on the last checkpoint.




***OH SHIZZ I forgot to tell you!!!****

When you are on the log-on screen, click the ""remember me"" so that you won't have complications and you dont have to type everytime you start the game :)"

Here is a little quote from original instructions:

*Then run ""ipconfig /flushdns""*

They said that this is used when you get that ""internet connection required"" problem!


To do this simply:
1. Click Start
2. -For XP: Click run and type cmd
- For Vista/7: Click the search box and type cmd
3. Cmd will start. type in the ""ipconfig /flushdns""
[[Without the ""quotes""]]
4. It should say its finished.


===Note: I tried this when I had the error on my first time but It didnt work. So i uninstalled everything and follow the original instructions===

Again, my instructions should work because they are like the original I followed. I only put in more ""details""

What I did was Uninstall AC2 and Ubisoft Game Launcher from control Panel.
Then went to Program files and deleted Ubisoft.

And thats it. I didnt check my documents or anything. but thats all I did.

Then I just follow the original instructions."
,jan765,2010-04-10T01:01Z,"@-SawN-  

You don't need to wait for the crack.
This is a 100% working crack finished game!!!.

I will summarize what this crack is.


This is an emulator. It runs a fake server on your PC to trick the game into thinking its connecting to UBI servers.

So basically you only need:
1. Clean AC2 with patch 1.01
2. Edit Hosts.
3. Latest Values.db (easy to find) (this is what ""unlocks"" what ubi tries to lock from pirates)
4. Launch server.exe everytime before you launch game

thats basically it.
If you know how to do it its like 2 minutes to do all these lol -.-

Only the ""updating"" is what's making it look so hard."
,LucianCanad,2010-04-10T02:16Z,"@Jan765

This is sooo weird.
I installed and uninstalled it over and over again, always deleting the Ubisoft folder (and took out UGL too, of course), ran the update, modified the hosts file, unrared the DRM, flushed the DNS, ran server.exe before the game (All of it over and over again) and I still get the error.

I would assume the CD key it prompts you for before the emulator is set up.

I've uninstalled and reinstalled AC2 twice.  followed those directions to the letter.  I still get the unable to connect to the internet error.  Your solution is not working on my computer.

Is there a problem running this in Xp SP3?"

OK, I had enough.

I am no beggar, I can afford to buy a legit serial key for AC2. Only didn't do so already because of my pride in being a crack-user, and my faith in the cracker teams.

My faith was rewarded. DRM lose. We win. Yay.
But if this blasted thing won't work for me, tough luck. I'm not waiting anymore."
,blirny,2010-04-10T16:09Z,"Heh.  I'll wait.  I've waited since last fall when it was released on xbox   Ill wait now.   It's not THAT big of a deal to me.  I just report back here in hopes that these guys will continue to look into it.    This entire process is beyond me.  I wouldn't even know where to begin to look to do this.   Of course that also limits what kind of quality feedback  I can give.

Either they will crack it or Ubi will lower the price to something I would actually pay for.  Even then I'd have to really think hard on supporting this style of DRM.   I like my single player games to be available when I can't be online."

No shit Sherlock.  Doesn't work.  Can you get that through your thick skull?   I have followed the instructions to the letter.  uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times.   It does NOT work.  

MY theory is it has something to do with XP sp3.    All we get is the little picture of Assasins Creed 2 with the little rotating circle for about 30 seconds before It says we ""aren't connected to the internet""

The server itself just spews out a bunch of stuff about 404 errors.  Now if I revert back the host file it does connect but asks for the CD key.   Oh wait. Sorry.  For the truly challenged among us it is Registration code.  I know that is such a huge leap of understanding for you guys.  Obviously it doesn't work in that mode without a key to put in the box."

Sorry I haven't logged in for a while.

Ok, this is WHY i got the error:

Before I even downloaded the game, I already edited the hosts and flushed the dns.

So when i installed the game, I got that error.


What I did was, UNINSTALL everything relation to AC2 including Ubisoft GAME LAUNCHER.

So now I had a clean pc.

Then, i just installed ac2 first, and followed the original instructions.


1. Install ac2. DO NOT CRACK/PATCH
2. Run the game normally. It will auto update to 1.01. If it asks you if you want to install 1.01, click yes.
3. The game will not run because its not cracked, so simply close it and make sure its not running, and game launcher is not running.
4. Follow the instructions on how to make this crack work. Basically, unrar the ""drm"" folder where-ever you want. Now, edit the hosts and add those ""ip"" listed. Save and quit hosts.
YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO THE ipconfig /flushdns
5. Run server.exe everytime before you launch the game.
so yeah. Run this, then the game.
[1st time = Log-on screen]
You can put WHATEVER you want but make sure its the same log-on everytime because it is the profile where your saves go.

you a are now done! I suggest downloading the LATEST values.db. [Its on a link on my previous instructions. Just browse back some pages]

The values.db in this crack wont let you interact with Tomb 5, thus you will get stuck. So yeah i recommend installing the new values.

Anyways thats it.

It says that ""cannot connect to saves"" or whatever. Even though it says there are no saves, there are saves! So dont worry

The game is AUTO SAVED. IT doesnt connect online.
You can disconnect while playing!! :)"
,jan765,2010-04-16T00:58Z,"@Likeadidas95

I had that too. Its just the values.db in this emulator. Its not updated.

Download the latest and and you can interact with it. Its tomb 5 right? I had that too. I just read in the descirption link's comments to download values.db and replace.

Follow the instructions like 2 pages previous here. theyre my instructions. on the bottom of my instructions are the link of the values"
