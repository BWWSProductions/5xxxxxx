 PanoramaPlus X4 is the powerful, easy-to-use tool that     
           automatically stitches photographs and still video frames    
         together to create stunning panoramic pictures. Import photos  
        or movie clips from sources including your hard drive, camera,  
              or scanner and stitch them together horizontally or       
              vertically. You can even create multiple panoramas        
          simultaneously. Upload your finished panoramas to FacebookÂ®   
         and FlickrÂ®, email them directly to friends and family, save   
        as high-res images, or create personalised print projects, all  
                         from within PanoramaPlus X4.
