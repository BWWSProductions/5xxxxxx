Bootsy Collins - What's Bootsy Doin'? (1988)


mp3@192 kbps cbr 



This was Bootsy's big comeback album after several years of laying low, mostly doing production & session work. The late 80's were the beginning of the funk comeback, with this album and Clinton's The Cinderella Theory being the works that kicked it off. Both albums also saw their artists return to touring, with Bootsy playing with most of the regular Rubber Band members, playing a mix of new and old material.
