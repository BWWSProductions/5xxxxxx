[T],renman,2010-04-07T23:59Z,"Your very welcome. I've got a few more coming in shortly. I'm actually buying these in, have meant to do this for years. Happy to share"
,scottielass,2010-04-08T04:06Z,"Thank you so much -- I'm old enough to remember this movie when it was originally released. BTW, have you seen the new updated St. Trinian's movie that was released a couple of years ago?"
[T],renman,2010-04-08T11:28Z,No I haven't seen it yet but do have it. I doubt it can compare to the originals though. You just don't get the same type of character actors these days. However I do like Colin Firth and believe him to be very capable but still incomparable to the likes of Alastair Sim. Thank you for your comments
[T],renman,2010-04-08T11:33Z,What am I talking about it's Rupert Everett playing Miss Fritton doh! ah well like I said I haven't seen it yet
,scottielass,2010-04-08T14:13Z,"Thanks for your comments on mine. The new St Trinian's is very up-to-date, but still manages to retain some of the original craziness. Rupert Everett is actually rather good as the headmistress. I believe there is a sequel that's just been made, maybe not yet released in the UK. "
,scottielass,2010-04-08T14:15Z,I'm impressed with the quality of this movie. Was it ripped from a DVD?
[T],renman,2010-04-08T18:51Z,Indeed it was. I just got in the post yesterday though I'd seen the movie many times before
,scottielass,2010-04-09T14:18Z,Watched it last night -- it's really very good -- thank you again.
