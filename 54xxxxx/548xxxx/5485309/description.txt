THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF YOUR LIFE Â© 1950

The Happiest Days Of Your Life is a precursor to the hugely successful St. Trinianâ€™s series.
Nutbourn College, the most established and respectable of boysâ€™ schools, is run by unyielding Headmaster Wetherby Pond (Alastair Sim).
When a military mistake billets a girlsâ€™ school to share the collegeâ€™s premises due to wartime restrictions, he is outraged. However, he soon discovers he has met his match when he encounters the headmistress of the girlsâ€™ school in question, the formidable Muriel Whitchurch (Margaret Rutherford). Initially the two are hostile to one another, but with a staff of dazed, eccentric teachers and a student body whose mischief knows no bounds, they are forced to pull together. Then, just when they thought the situation couldnâ€™t get any more complicated, they discover they are faced with two troublesome visits on the same day; one from a group of parents, who must believe the school is only for girls, and one from the Ministry, who must be presented with an all boys establishment!
Unmissable and hilarious, this is classic British comedy at its best.
