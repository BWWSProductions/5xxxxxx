,fejop,2011-11-01T21:11Z,"""This isn't the movie""?
It sure looks like a movie and it's the one he claimed it was. Just because you were looking for the new one doesn't mean you can blame the uploader which did an excellent job, dickhead."
,asputasdaminhavida,2011-11-02T19:40Z,"Before Spillbeer there were other TinTin Movie makers!!
The new cartoons suck and damage the beauty of the character HergĂŠ created! "
,chandlerboy,2011-11-08T05:42Z,"Wow, daddydude is quite the retarded asshole! hahaha."
,deltix1,2011-11-09T17:52Z,"There is nothing to blame the uploader for your own stupidity, stop using a computer if you do not know how to use simple logic, or how to look for the correct items you need.

wankers stop complaining and check your fackts before complaining.

,ProphetZarquon,2011-11-11T01:25Z,"Uploaded in 2010, so it isn't the 2011 movie (duh).

Audio:9 (English)
Video:7 (French) This file could benefit from a reencode with diamond/hexagonal Motion Estimation and Trellis Quantization to reduce some of the very noticeable pixellation.

Great torrent, nice for comparing the new version to a classic.  Thanks uploader!"
