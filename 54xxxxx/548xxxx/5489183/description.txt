Practical Immunology is an introductory text aimed at immunology students and researchers who need a comprehensive overview of the methodology of immunology. Now in its fourth edition, Practical Immunology will appeal to students of immunology; graduate students embarking on bench science; and specialised immunologists who need to use an immunological technique outside their sphere of expertise.
The rapid and startling innovations in immunology over the past two decades have their root in sound experimental practice. Practical Immunology gives straightforward descriptions of the commonest techniques that are often covered, but not always well explained in current literature. It explains how to perform the basic techniques that form the anatomy of experimental immunology, and includes tips for improving the techniques, troubleshooting and other handy advice. Where possible, the techniques are explained in a way that ensures that the purchase of specialist kits is avoidable. For those who are a little rusty on their basic immunology the book also gives background information, making it a highly useful "one stop shop".
This latest edition has been fully revised to include the basic techniques of molecular biology, with a revised section on cytokines, an expanded section on clinical immunology and new techniques in epitope mapping and the study of cell adhersion molecules.
