America is at risk right now [2010-04-06]. At risk for a false-flag terror event. The peaceful efforts of the American people who are working to restore America to its Constitutional foundation pose a threat to the global elite working to form a socalist superstate known as the New World Order. These elitists are firmly entrenched in the federal government, and the supporting globalist think tanks, like the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and the Bilderberg Group.

The Tea Party movement is boiling over, patriot groups are being labeled by pseudo-experts in the Southern Poverty Law Center as ""anti-government,"" the Department of Homeland Security is actually taking cues from the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the FBI is actively infiltrating groups across the country, seeding violent strains of thought, in an attempt to get these groups to act out. Recent court documents have proven that the feds are employing extremist radio hosts like Hal Turner to stir the pot.

Meanwhile, another group referring to themselves as the Guardians of the Free Repubic have initiated the ""Restore America Plan."" The latest phase of their plan included sending letters to the governors of all 50 states, saying if they don't leave office within three days, they will be removed. While the group advocates legal remedies [for] reinstating the lawful Constitutional republic, the mainstream media, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security are labeling them as ""extremists"" that have the potential to lead to violence.

The recent militia raids conducted by the FBI and the new focus on the Guardian Elders, alongside the recent public outcry against the healthcare bill that prompted Democrats to carry out false-flag attacks on their own offices, only to blame Tea Party groups, is another reason the public should be on high alert against any propagated threats against infrastructure by any domestic groups.

A recent posting on Infoshop News encourages anarchists to organize counter-protests against the upcoming April 15th Tea Party demonstrations. Tea Partiers need to be fully aware of infiltrators from radical fringe anarchist groups, the federal government, and even plain-clothes police, inciting violence and raising the temperature at rallies nation wide. The patriot uprising is a threat to the federal government, who is acting beyond the confines of the Constitution of the United States; and the radical fringe, who are funded by the global elite to create the perception that these Constitutionalist, Tea Party groups are violent and must be stopped.

Unfortunately, America has a history of creating perceived threats to its existence, to justify carrying out wars of aggression against foreign nations and creating police-state policies against its own people. Perfect example: the 1898 sinking of the Maine. No reliable evidence was ever produced linking Spain to the event, and it is now widely believed the event was a mechanical failure or false-flag operation.

Operation Northwoods was a plan that originated within the United States Government, drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, signed by Chairman Lyman Lemnitzer, and sent to the Secretary of Defense. The plan called for the Central Intelligence Agency or other operatives to commit genuine acts of terrorism in U.S. cities and elsewhere. Operation Northwoods was never officially accepted by President Kennedy.

However in 1965, just two years after Kennedy's assassination, the Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred, where the American destroyer Maddox was supposedly attacked twice by three North Vietnamese torpedo boats, in 1964. The Gulf of Tonkin ... never ... happened.

In 1991 -- Desert Storm: media hoax. In an efort to further justify the invasion and garner public support, the daughter of [the] Kuwaiti U.S. ambassador played nurse on TV and testified to witnessing Iraqi soldiers pulling babies out of incubators in Kuwait. This never happened.
