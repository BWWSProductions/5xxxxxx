,pro_torr,2010-09-06T17:29Z,"Hi, folks. While I'm still a n00b at this (no offense, Noobish. Love your work, BTW.) I do know that if you want to install any application, really, from a .ISO or similar file, you should have a program called PowerISO (or similar). For those who don't know, PowerISO creates a virtual CD drive that you can mount the image to and run the image like it was burned on a disk. Most people use WinRAR, or something similar, to unpack the installation. This, sadly, is not the way to do it. PowerISO is free for the purposes of what you would use it for. Hope this helps!"
,pro_torr,2010-09-06T17:36Z,"@ricarduks If you don't have video drivers, then you need to get some. If you don't know what video card you have, there is a program called Sandra by SiSoftware that should tell you what card you have."

You can find this file from iso2. Install iso1 by just  clicking next, or whatever it is in russian.
