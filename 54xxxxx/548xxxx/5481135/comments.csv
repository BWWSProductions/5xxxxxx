- You have installed a clean version, with no cracks,
- You have updated the game to version 1.01,
- You have updated launcher to the latest version
- You have administrator rights on this computer
- You have created Ubisoft Account.
If you have it all, you can install crack to the folder with the game.

Also there is some activity in the server console, so the game is connecting to the emulated server. Looking at the console I see 3 worrying messages:
1. 'Warning - unexpected client settings'
2. several Python exceptions : Errno 10054 - an existing connection was forcibly closed by a remote server
3. several code 404 - message file not found

,hyphen79,2010-04-23T14:27Z,"For those of you having problems even getting the game to launch with the offline server software... 

1.) When you copy/paste the lines to your hosts file, DELETE EXTRA SPACES between the ""127.0.0.1"" and the URL address.. there should only be ONE space between the IP and the URL in each line. (AiTB, you might want to correct this in your description of the torrent.)

2.) A lot of folks are having issues with the offline server crack.. as did I. I fixed my issue by instead using:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5496065/Assassin_s_Creed_2_Crack_%28Final_and_complete%29

instead of using the ""raw"" offline server, use the ""AC2 Simple Laucher coded by Approved"". This will auto load the offline server, as well as give you a gui to launch the game.

Works like a charm. Hope that helps!"

Then, follow the instructions starting from ""If you want to use offline server 0.44 (more stable)"", so the first part of the description. Even though you already modified the hosts file by adding the 5 lines, make sure you put only ONE space between the numbers and (127.xxxx) and the localhosts (static3.cdn....).
