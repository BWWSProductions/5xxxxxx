Solitary 4.0 Season Finale....woohoo!

Sorry about taking so long to get this to you, my fellow Solitary
fans. My computer was on the fritz and I had to have my -oh so hunky
Dell repair dude- over to my house a few times to fix it. I'm thinking 
I might need to have him come a few more times though.... You know,
to make SURE it stays fixed and all.. ~winks~

I hope you enjoy the finale. It's unfortunate this is the last season
they plan to produce... but maybe we'll get lucky and another network
will see it for the gem it is and continue on with the tradition.
**crossing fingers** :o)
