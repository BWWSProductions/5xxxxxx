This presentation, which I saw on HBO many years ago, had so much more energy than the film. Richard Thomas proves here that he can handle comedy, and Bess Armstrong is a very fine comedy actress! There's plenty of witty humor accented by some physical slapstick that kept me laughing virtually the whole time. 



This is a VHS rip,quality is not great but it is the only copy I could find anywhere, HBO never released this on DVD or VHS
