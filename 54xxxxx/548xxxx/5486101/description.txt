â€œWith his cheeky, disillusioned, home studio-recorded folksy yet rock-y songs, Brad, a 31-year-old musician from Ottawa, inevitably gets compared to Beck. As much as it can be a compliment, no artist likes to be told they sound like another; but by now Brad has come to terms with it. 

â€œIt used to bother me, I took it as â€˜hey youâ€™re a crappy Beck impersonator with no ideas of your own!â€™ But other musicians told me they get compared to Beck all the time also. So maybe itâ€™s the musical equivalent of â€˜tastes like chickenâ€™. The guyâ€™s done so much in many different styles itâ€™s easy to compare nearly anything to something in his catalog.â€
