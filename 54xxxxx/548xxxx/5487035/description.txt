Karkwa is a Quebec indie rock band.

Formed in 1998, the group consists of vocalist and guitarist Louis-Jean Cormier, keyboardist FranÃ§ois Lafontaine, bass guitarist Martin Lamontagne, percussionist Julien Sagot and drummer StÃ©phane Bergeron.

After reaching the final stages of the Francouvertes contest in 2001, the band released its debut album, Le Pensionnat des Ã©tablis, in 2003. The album's single "Poisson cru" reached the top of Quebec's campus radio charts, and was named the best album of the year by two critics for Montreal's alternative weekly Voir.

The band's second album, Les Tremblements sâ€™immobilisent, won three FÃ©lix Awards in 2006. In 2007, they were featured, along with The Stills, The Besnard Lakes and Mahjor Bidet, on the bill of Quebec Scene, a concert in Ottawa sponsored by CBC Radio 3.

The band's name is a phonetic rendering of carquois, the French term for a quiver of arrows.
