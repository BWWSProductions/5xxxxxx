you have the entire www at your disposal and this is where you dump your incoherent inquiry? the fuck?
@IwannaFan2
appreciate the early up. watchable screener quality. but the movie is straight shit. for those whom it may concern.."
,Onowh,2010-04-11T00:41Z,"What are people talking about? This copy isnt out of sync. When you skim the movie to check for sync issues it goes out for half a second, but it fixes itself almost immediately.

Ive played it on VLC player and i dont see a single sync issue.

It looks good, plays well, and the audio is just fine.
Thank you.
