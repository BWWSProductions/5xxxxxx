Thank you for the fast posting of this episode, but where is the HD version in HQ (1.56 GB)...?

The images are so good so it is worth to get it in HD in high quality! "
,PinkPuspe,2010-04-05T06:28Z,"Agree, I've been watching 720p version on 42inch plasma. "
,the28thfrozenfish,2010-04-05T09:32Z,Stuck at 98.8% at 8:25 GMT; all of you 3 seeders need to let more finish (one at a time) - please do that!
,the28thfrozenfish,2010-04-05T09:33Z,"Or some of you people who are reading this, please stop your download until more seeders become available."
,the28thfrozenfish,2010-04-05T09:43Z,"Stop it, people, please, you don't want to be the cancer of this torrent."
,Vanayr,2010-04-05T10:34Z,"4 seeds now, we're getting there.  2134 people now with 98.8% it seems..."
,the28thfrozenfish,2010-04-05T12:47Z,I was mistaken: You ARE the cancer in here.
,the28thfrozenfish,2010-04-05T13:58Z,"ATTENTION, NEWCOMERS: FUCKING PAY ATTENTION! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT UNLESS THERE ARE AT LEAST 1/3 SEEDERS OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEERS.

This message is written in Caps Lock in the vague hope that you will realize that as long as you keep trying to download this, the harder it gets, as it is impossible for 3 seeders to distribute it across 1000 leechers! This will take a very long time.

IN CONCLUSION: Get it through your thick skull! Your slowing down this torrent if you don't first allow even a small number of people to finish.

""If we all stop, nobody will get it"" - there's no need to worry about it, a lot of people will not visit thepiratebay or read again the comments section. STOP YOUR CLIENTS NOW!

Jesus"

Hi Jesus....
Coincidental, do you have the phone number or the email address of your father? 

Rudi

"
,the28thfrozenfish,2010-04-05T14:49Z,"Hi, Rudi,

No, it's simply Jesus with a capital J; it works for both telephone and email. There are no letters in the telephone number, but you really have to dial Jesus, not the corresponding numbers to the letters - I know, sound pretty tricky at first, doesn't it?

With email it's a lot easier: no need for the ""2"" symbol anyway! That's why most chicks I bang send me an email. Haha, suckers, like I'm gonna reply to that. Obv, they don't know that they're supposed to dial Jesus with letters, so they try using the corresponding numbers, yo.

Jesus"
,the28thfrozenfish,2010-04-05T15:00Z,"Hi again, Rudi,

Sorry I thought you asked if I have the *same* phone number/email as dad. As for his, I can't give them to you: he doesn't really care about humans anyway.

Jesus"
,the28thfrozenfish,2010-04-05T15:28Z,"HELLO AGAIN, FUCKERS.

I see you've decided to fuck my day up even longer. PRESS THE FUCKING STOP BUTTON ON YOUR TORRENT CLIENT.

Why? See above."
,phound,2010-04-05T23:41Z,"to the ignorant fuckwads who keep flaming this comment board.

most people, unlike you, apparently, do not open a torrent and watch it obsessively until it's finished.  most people open a shitload of torrents and then move on to some other more interesting endeavor.

the high leech / seeder ratio indicates a weakness in the bittorrent protocol, not user error.  it needs to be developed to detect this kind of situation from the tracker data, then adjust the seeder settings, accordingly to optimize increasing the number of seeders, before readjusting its settings again.

if you want to bitch and scream like a little pussy so much, why not learn to code and make the bittorent protocol BETTER?

fuckwads."
,ptv83,2010-04-06T10:16Z,holy fuck.. take a fucking chill pill douche bag.
,derekbd,2010-04-07T11:19Z,"Thanks for this.  
frozenfish... get over yourself ... calling other users fuckwits and such is pointless   Have you had your blood pressure checked lately? You could be heading for hospital soon"
,derekbd,2010-04-07T11:20Z,"oh you didnt use the fuckwits term, apologies 
but still.  go outside and get some air"
,the28thfrozenfish,2010-04-07T15:53Z,"To Whom It May Concern:

Telling me to calm down is pointless. Your comments are therefore pointless. Mine may be a bit rough (using words as ""fuckers"" - even though people who fuck around with my internets should be called fuckers -), but at least they teach the noobs how to avoid being insulted by other, more experienced people, thus avoiding massive pwnage.
