Sam Corry and Daniel O'Neil grew up in Craigneuk, Motherwell, where they spent their early years as playground rivals. This rivalry continued throughout the 1980's as their respective bands competed for gigs in the Scottish music scene. A mutual admiration for Bob Dylan and Neil Young, country music and classic guitar bands like Television and Creedence Clearwater Revival eventually brought them together as The River Detectives.
In 1988 the duo moved to Glasgow, ditched their TV and played more than 100 shows from Stirling to Shetland. By the end of the year they became the first Scottish act in more than a decade to sign for American giants Warner Bros. The events leading to their breakthrough began in 1985, when the newly formed duo decided to adopt a year zero approach in their listening habits.
Armed with their first set of songs they were now ready to recruit a band. The first line up consisted of Dan on drums and vocals, Sam on guitar and vocals, with Bernie Doris on bass and Gary Roberts on guitar. On August 18 th 1986 at Jack Daniels Bar in Motherwell The River Detectives took to the stage for the first time.
With no television to distract them, Sam and Dan spent most of their time writing the songs that would comprise their debut album, Saturday Night Sunday Morning.
