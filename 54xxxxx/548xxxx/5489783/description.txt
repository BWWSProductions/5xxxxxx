Review: A young man has given up meeting his dream girl, and understood that it's pointless to continue living without love. But, in the very nick of time when he was ready to close his days there was a miracle. A magician appeared from nowhere told a young man how to create and materialize his love. And, everything could be just all right, if there was no other side of a miracle. The astral gang is preventing a young man from finding what he is searching for. The gang has its own abstruse rules and is living accordingly.

Postscript: This film is based on the "The Astral Body" novel by Vseslav Solo, which was in its turn inspired by a true story. For the first time ever, a true-life technology of one's love creating and materializing is opened. This is a grand gift for a careful viewer.
