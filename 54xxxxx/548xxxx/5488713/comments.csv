[T],renman,2010-04-10T14:06Z,"What you have to remember a lot of these old movies are out of copyright now and a lot can be found online, not necessarily the Alastair Sim series of movies I've upped as I've purchased most of these. There are some other Ealing classics I have but I believe these have already been upped. (Kind hearts and Coronets, The Ladykillers etc) However people are welcome to request and I'll see what I can dig out. Pretty obvious I'm a big Alastair Sim fan though hey."
