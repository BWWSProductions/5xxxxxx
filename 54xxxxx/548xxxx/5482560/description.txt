
Install Fedora 12 From usb(HOW TO FORCE BRUTE BOOT USB from grub boot-loader)

This tutorial was writen just to show you that you can force the usb to boot from your pc, if your pc can't boot form usb.

Fro Linux users only

Requirements:
1GB USB stick
A pc with Linux OS
And The ISO Fedora 12 Image
and that's it


We need first to download the liveusb-creator form this site 
https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/
Once you downloaded the liveusb-creator, and installed it open it and extract the ISO image on your usb 
All done 

Now The tricky part
Open The syslinux folder on the USB you just extracted and open syslinux.cfg and you should see these lines(Not all writen here just the one we need)

append initrd=initrd0.img root=live:UUID=B07A-F99F rootfstype=vfat rw liveimg overlay=UUID=B07A-F99F quiet  rhgb rd_NO_LUKS rd_NO_MD noiswmd 

Now you can see clearly there my USB UUID, wich is UUID=B07A-F99F
now yours should be different, write your UUID like this on paper so you 
have it for later.

All we need is this line..

root=live:UUID=hereyourUSBnumber rootfstype=vfat rw 

Now insert USB on your PC
Now reboot your system and from boot-loader command line
you have to type this at the boot menu

kernel /syslinux/vmlinuz0 root=live:UUID=hereyourUSBnumber rootfstype=vfat rw
initrd /syslinux/initrd0.img root=live:UUID=hereyourUSBnumber rootfstype=vfat rw
boot

You should be able to boot and get Fedora menu, where you can install it to your hard drive...


If you have problems plase comment, and be specific about it
