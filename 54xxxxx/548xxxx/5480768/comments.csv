what's the difference??"
[T],insinuendo,2010-04-04T20:40Z,Much lower compression rate.
[T],insinuendo,2010-04-04T20:46Z,"I'm hoping people will be more satisfied with this release and it not receive +19/-16. Although I didn't rip it, I am sure it will be superior in quality."
,Anakunda,2010-04-04T21:16Z,"Well I checked all the albums from the another collection against accuraterip with excellent score, so there's not much room for improvements, except 24bit resolution, IMO.
Actually I didnot read all the comments but don't know why it has as bad rating.
I'll compare them to see the true difference as I don't believe compression ratio can make the same collection double size."
[T],insinuendo,2010-04-04T22:59Z,"It's good to be vigilant and helpful to your fellow peers Anakunda.

Good for you!"
,Anakunda,2010-04-05T00:31Z,The 2 rips seem exactly the same except this is 24bit. That's it
[T],insinuendo,2010-04-05T00:52Z,"Sorry your're not knocked off your feet...Did I not swoon you with this upload? Shall I remove it to please you?

Pay some respect to Mariodjw for providing you and the rest of the crew here with free music. And sorry for offering people an alternative download.

That's it."
,Anakunda,2010-04-05T16:58Z,"Calm down, it's nice from ya to offer this nice stuff, just for next time think about providing something better description for your uploads. coz noone owns crystal ball to foretell that this is a 24bit rip. Btw ya got /-1 ;D
And no, it wasnot me "
,jcarr73729,2010-04-05T23:26Z,"Maybe it would have helped if you'd pointed out that these were 24-bit recordings off the vinyl albums.

Lineage does help those who care."
,Anakunda,2010-04-06T00:32Z,"i dont think this is a vinyl rip. but content of the flac bonus flash drive, guessing"
,jcarr73729,2010-04-06T14:27Z,"I have the Apple USB 24-bit FLAC files, and a comparison suggests this torrent does include the official files off the memory stick.

Still would have been nice if that had been mentioned.

Insinuendo said they were ripped, and rips are off CD/DVD discs or vinyl platters. The Beatles remasters could only be ripped off 16-bit CDs and vinyl, so that is what made me think a 24-bit needle-drop recording.

Of course, the 24-bit FLAC files off the USB memory stick are a 'copy', not a 'rip'.

I'll go and crawl under that rock again!"
[T],insinuendo,2010-04-08T11:35Z,"Finally got info from provider:

http://www.amazon.com/Beatles-USB/dp/B002VH7P4O"
,larsv,2010-04-08T17:44Z,"Info for Sonos owners. As this is 24-bit flac please note that your Sonos gear will not be able to play this!
  ;-)"
,gtr1022,2010-04-13T23:23Z,"Unless I'm missing something, this is the ""Holy Grail"" of Beatles collections.  

I believe this is the only way to get ""true"" 24 bit versions of the recently remastered collection. (Sir Paul couldn't get better versions!)

Thanks so much insinuendo!!!"
[T],insinuendo,2010-04-14T01:45Z,"You're welcome!

The credits however go to Mariodjw."
,four-oh-four,2010-07-25T05:38Z,"Holy Grail, indeed.....
Thanks, insinuendo! "

[T],insinuendo,2010-11-26T23:39Z,The files are fine :)

,ssj5chrism,2010-12-06T15:23Z,"Thanks insinuendo for the upload. All the songs sound fantastic, except there seems to be a problem with one of them. The song ""Dear Prudence"" cuts out for about a second at around the 2:20 mark. Should I try re-downloading that particular song or is the rip at fault?"
,ssj5chrism,2010-12-11T20:33Z,"I tried redownloading, but the problem is still there. Help please!!"
,xMariodjwx,2010-12-22T07:35Z,I'm glad so many people liked this.
,ssj5chrism,2010-12-23T23:55Z,"NVM, VLC player was the problem."
,enzen0,2011-01-20T02:51Z,"Thanks for the upload. These sound absolutely amazing in my car sound system. Don't let the bitchy people complaining about the quality get to you. Just tell 'em ""If you want something done better, do it yourself!"". :)"
,lilmouk,2011-03-10T12:35Z,a million thx insinuendo and Mariodjw 
,MrWhite2,2011-06-11T10:30Z,"This is the Stereo re-master of The Beatles studio albums. The quality is perfect, you can hear sounds in the songs that you never knew where there. The fuzz, pops, clicks etc are gone and only pristine music is left.

There are very big differences between the Stereo and Mono releases of The Beatles albums. My recommendation is to learn what the difference is about maybe by reading about it on Wikipedia, then downloading both the Stereo and Mono torrents and deciding for yourself."
,stervendehoerenkachel,2011-07-31T19:41Z,"Thanks
Anybody know why Rubber Soul has no tags?

,pezed,2012-01-30T23:21Z,"When I saw USB and 24 bit I was pretty sure what this was. It's stated in the title exactly (almost) what this is. Delete [Boxset] and add [flash drive].No big deal no one is perfect. gtr1022 is correct, many people consider this the ""Holy Grail"" of The Beatles. More information is at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles_Stereo_Box_Set#Limited_edition_USB_flash_drive. I can't believe anyone would actually complain about this upload. 
Thank You insinuendo. You and TPB Rock"
,IsacDaavi,2012-02-06T02:39Z,"Thanks so much.

I see some of you are misunderstanding the size of this torrent. This USB version is not bigger because the other one is more compressed (both are flac ), but because of bit-depth."
