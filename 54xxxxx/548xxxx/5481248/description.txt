    Farmer Brown wants to sell his daughter, June, to the dastardly Cyrus    
    P. Barksnapper in order to save his farm. But, Jim Huckleberry would     
    like to to do some plowing with June himself. To help, he applies for    
    financial aid, but the government screws up thinking he requested        
    foreign aid.
