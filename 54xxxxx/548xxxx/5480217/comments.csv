There is a software called DEVFUS at http://www.devcad.com/eng/default.htm that when you put a 2D design of an airplane fuselage it comes out a 3D design and you can also extract various sections of it.
It a nice software and I think there are many airplane modelers out there who does not have the money to buy such a software. If it is easy for you to try to crack it it would be nice.
Thank you."
