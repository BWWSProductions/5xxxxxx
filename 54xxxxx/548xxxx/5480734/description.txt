    Fifteen years after this stunning reinterpretation of Dracula was        
    released (1992), we go behind the scenes and watch master director       
    Francis Coppola reinvent a classic with screenwriter James V. Hart,      
    and cast members Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, Keanu       
    Reeves, Richard E. Grant, tom Waits and Sadie Frost. "Bram Stoker's      
    Dracula was filmed entirely on the sound-stages of MGM (then recently    
    acquired by Sony and Columbia pictures) and the visual style included    
    vintage special effects and screen magic at a scale not seen in          
    decades.
