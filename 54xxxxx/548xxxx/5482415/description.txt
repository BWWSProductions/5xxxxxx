                  Magnifying Glass Pro v1.8 (Multilanguage) + Key



The Magnifying Glass Pro utility is a virtual magnifier (virtual lens, screen-
zoomer) that enables you to enlarge (magnify) text and graphics as they are 
displayed on your computer monitor or attached television screen, or projected 
onto a larger media during a presentation (e.g., using an application such as 
PowerPoint). As you pass your mouse cursor over a section of the viewing area, 
the display is magnified making it instantly more readable and accessible.
In addition, you can apply a variety of visual effects and enhancements to that 
display.



What can "Magnifying Glass Pro" do for you?

- Aid with compromised vision.
- Lessen eyestrain for those with normal vision.
- Enhance onscreen and projected detail.
- Allow modification of the magnified area in real time (e.g., invert or rotate 
  the image, change the contrast).
- Take advantage of multi-monitor systems. For example, one monitor (or TV screen)
  could be dedicated to a full-screen Glass -- a magnified, easy-to-view display of 
  the image on the primary working display.
- Provide you with more control over your business presentations.



Unique Features

Magnifying Glass Pro differs from similar utilities with the inclusion of a unique 
set of features, including: 

- Modification of an onscreen image in real time (e.g., adjust contrast, add 
  special effects, smoothing, and so on). 
- Adjust the screen position of the magnifying Glass (e.g., a fixed position, 
  under the cursor, angular, and so on). 
- Save multiple set of viewing preferences as individual Profiles, then switch 
  between those Profiles instantly (e.g., you can have one Profile for viewing 
  text and another for working with graphic images). 
- Show/hide the Magnifying Glass simply by shaking the mouse cursor from side to 
  side. This is much easier than using the keyboard shortcut when your hand is 
  already on the mouse. 
- Command Mode, which enables you to quickly change/apply Magnifying Glass options 
  (e.g., Glass size and position, transparency, contrast, effects, and so on). 
- The Auto-switcher, which enables you to associate individual applications, 
  windows, and screen elements with specific user-defined Profiles (group of Glass 
  settings). As the "target" changes (e.g., you switch applications) the Auto-
  switcher applies the appropriate Glass settings automatically, based on the 
  defined Profile association, with no interruption to your productivity. 
 -No restrictions on how you can use Magnifying Glass Pro. You control the size 
  and position of the Glass -- it can occupy the entire screen, or a smaller, 
  user-defined area. It can even extend beyond the edges of your screen to move 
  to a second monitor. You can quickly and easily apply a myriad of effects to 
  enhance your viewing experience and solve the sophisticated needs of any text- 
  or graphics-based project.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security 
2- Avira AntiVir Premium 
3- avast! Pro Antivirus
4- Kaspersky Antivirus 

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
