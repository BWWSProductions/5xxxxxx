Nobody's life has been romanticised more than Chopin's, yet at heart he was a classicist and adored Bach and Mozart above all other composers. The sense of line. pulse, fluidity, and counterpoint that are trademarks of those composers are all present in these works by Chopin. The Nocturnes span Chopin's entire creative life, giving us a marvellous opportunity to see not only how his early works were already totally inspired and original, but also how his style and emotional maturity developed through the years.


Sleeve notes:


'One of the most elegant pianists around, the Canadian virtuoso Angela Hewitt interrupts her epic Bach and Couperin cycles for Hyperion to explore some of Chopin's most refined music, the complete Nocturnes and Impromptus. Hewitt's innate sophistication and delicacy of touch are perfectly suited to these exquisite pieces, 25 of them over two discs, by a master of the genre at the height of his fragile powers. Spanning almost his entire creative life, the Nocturnes amount to a remarkable graph of Chopin's emotional maturity, touchingly reflected in the affectionate care Hewitt brings to what sounds like a labour of love'  (The Observer)


'In a catalogue boasting many distinguished Chopin Nocturne cycles, Angela Hewitt's commands attention'  BBC Music Magazine)



Hewittâ€™s performances are every bit as fresh as one would expect from the pianist hailed as â€˜one of the reliably mesmerising musicians of the dayâ€™, with â€˜the ability to convey a spiritual seriousness that nonetheless does not exclude an utter charmâ€™ (The Sunday Times)
