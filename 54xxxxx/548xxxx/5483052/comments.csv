,sathanas6,2010-04-07T03:11Z,"SATA and RAID drivers are also included with this release, but since it is OEM and not VLK, you don't have to worry about the key getting blacklisted after several hundred people start using it illegally."
,demongithara23,2010-04-23T15:27Z,"Hello Santhanas6:
After having frequent crashes on the XP Black Edition, I found yours to be easy to use and it seems to be a very stable release for Toshiba OEM laptops. Took about an hour to install. I was able to get all the WGA updates immediately without a single hitch. Activation worked fine without having to use the extra 'just in case' crack, and was a legit Vista Home Premium when I bought this machine new. WGA verification persist after a day of using and several reboots. Booting up and down is very fast, even on the first times I had to restart for installs. The drivers that came with your bundle worked great so far. Bit Defender detects no trace of critters.

Issues I have is that I must boot the HD in compatibility mode or else I get a BSOD, and for some reason the logon screen never appears, even though I have it configured for password protection under the admin account. 

After a serious trojan attack on the vista os that came with this laptop, which did not come with a recover disk or software for making them, I am happy to have a very stable XP back, at least.

Thanks for the time and effort in releasing a decent XP for OEMs. Wouldn't mind a working x64 version , but this will do just fine. Peace"

,sathanas6,2010-06-04T09:00Z,"vbox, no."
,sathanas6,2010-06-04T09:03Z,"marflo, Nero is in a folder on the C drive that is named the Portuguese version of program files. If you make a shortcut of the start smart app and place it in all users start menu, programs, then you will have easy access."
,sathanas6,2010-06-04T09:04Z,"Work has begun on version 6, which will include expanded OEM support."
,marflo,2010-06-04T19:41Z,"Thank you, but meanwhile I figured out.
I need to reinstall and now is ok.
I am happy that I got it because the vista basic that came with my laptop cannot make to work in my network, as soon I try to connect to my home network of xp pc's i am loosing internet and I need to restart my router;  with your xp all is ok.Thanks again."
,demongithara23,2010-06-14T02:03Z,"It's ""XPAwesome"" that your working on version 6, but I ran into some problems. I got a trojan, (not as a result of this distro. IT ISN'T INFECTED PEOPLE - TRY IT), and tried to reinstall, but it would always crash after loading windows for install. It seems this happens with all of my x32 versions of XP, so I had to resort to Windows 7 x64. XP x64 would install, but didn't come with those great drivers that work out of the box that your distro came with. I'm not sure what the problem is, but it's a good distro and people should give it a chance. Again, my problems with the trojan was a result of lax system security on my part, and I scanned these files with BitDefender Pro. Also I have tried to set my bios HD settings to AHCI mod and also to Compatibility mod with no luck. I even did a low level disk wipe, that took over 12 hours to complete, and still it wouldn't install."
,Rottweiler-fan,2011-01-07T02:27Z,"Thank you sathanas6. this works Great on my Acer Ferrari 3400 Laptop and only needed approx 200Mb of updates on Windows Update (installed on 02/01/2011) and it passed WGA with no problems ;o) I`ve also installed it on an ASUS with no problems as well. 
It takes a while to install but it`s well worth the wait.
Thanks for all your hard work... "
