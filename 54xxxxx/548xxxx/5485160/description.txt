Greaseball Nick suspects his wife of cheating on him. Nick goes out and buys a meat cleaver but, instead of hacking up Cassidy, he goes over to his girlfriend Eva's home and puts the meat cleaver through the neck of Jerry, Eva's â€œqueer son-of-a-bitchâ€ husband (played by director WALT DAVIS) who's right in the middle of having sex with Marshall, Eva's bi-sexual brother. Whack! And yes, kiddies, there's nothing quite like opening a heterosexual porn film with gurgling blood and a gay sex scene to totally wake up and disorient its audience. But, wait, it gets worse...
Turned on by the killing, horny Eva pomptly gets it on with both Nick and... well, Jerry's corpse.(â€œWidows need love... attention... fucking!â€) After dumping Jerry in a big black coffin, Eva then has sex with her brother right on top of it. But before they can get the coffin out of the house, The Amazing Colossal Crank, John Holmes himself, shows up with girlfriend Lisa and happily displays his mutant member: â€œLook we're all 21 and responsible citizens, right? So let's just take off our clothes and get in on right here!â€
But when Nicky's wife also shows up, she and Nick retreat to the bedroom for some Nicky-ball as Eva sneaks up on then with Nicky's meat cleaver. Oops. This causes Nicky's wife to scream, chomp down on Nicky's frisky fella, bite it off, and choke to death on the morbid mouthful. Nicky cups his bloody stump and howls, Eva freaks, and we start making a mental list of all the unsuspecting friends and relatives we'd like to show this to...
Sick, sick, and â€“ did we mention - sick. One wonders just what the hell audience this was made for. No surprise that it was never theatrically released except for a single disastrous preview in the early '70s that, understandably, sent stunned patron racing for the exits.
Though there's non title card on the print, this was reportedly shot under the title Widow Blue. However, the bands on the film reels red The Demon in Miss Jones so that's the title we're using as well. Under any title, it is, of course, the perfect gift for the person you love.
