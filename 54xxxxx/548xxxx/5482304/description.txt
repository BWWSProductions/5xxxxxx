          Descriptionmusic, this 2000 release stands as the final word on the Ozark Mountain   
          Daredevils' career. Cherry-picking 21 tunes from their five studio album stint circa 
          1974-1978 -- with the lion's share coming from their first three albums and only     
          three selections from the final two -- this is pretty much all you'll need from the  
          under-recognized band that worked in the '70s country-rock shadows of Poco and       
          Firefall, but weren't as dependable or pop savvy as either. In fact, their biggest   
          hit, the Hall & Oates, blue-eyed soul-styled "Jackie Blue," was so atypical of the   
          band's characteristically down-home approach that it ultimately may have been more   
          damaging to their career than if they had clicked with a song more representative of 
          their crisp, rural country pop/rock. As enjoyable and pleasantly organic as they     
          were, the group lacked a distinctive vocalist, direction, and most importantly great 
          songs. This collection focuses on their less commercially rocking, more rootsy side, 
          and as such it's a consistently listenable, predominantly chronological compilation  
          that is all any but the most die-hard fan will ever need. An extensive essay         
          (including quotes from bandmembers) and rare photos in the disc's 16-page booklet    
          sweeten the pot and make this as definitive an overview from a talented also-ran     
          outfit as necessary. Like its closing title track, the Ozark Mountain Daredevils     
          lived in a stylistic time warp, comfortable within its own limitations and unwilling 
          -- but not unable -- to break free of them. ~ Hal Horowitz

                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         
                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
