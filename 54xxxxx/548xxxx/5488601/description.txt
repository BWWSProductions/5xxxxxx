A slightly different take on the Kate Bush discography. Just like the original vinyl box set "The Single File", released back in 1984, this is a collection bringing together all of her UK singles to date, coupled with their respective B-sides, non-album tracks and remixes. Completed with a few essential non-UK A- and B-sides like "Them Heavy People" (studio version, Japan 1978), "Symphony in Blue" (Japan & Canada, 1978), "Suspended in Gaffa" (Continental Europe & Scandinavia, 1983), "Ne t'enfuis pas"/"Un baiser d'enfant" (France & Canada, 1983) and "Night of the Swallow"/"Houdini" (Ireland, 1983). 

Ninety moments of sheer pleasure and since the vast majority of these recordings are long out of print and otherwise unobtainable  - take note EMI and Novercia/Noble & Brite Ltd. - in my humble opinion also a box set begging to be released...
