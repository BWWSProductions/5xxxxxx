,sharpsponge,2010-04-12T03:31Z,"omg I have to actually scroll my mouse across the IMDB address and hit copy and hit paste .... I'm exhaused now 


lol"
,Damascus25,2010-04-12T10:19Z,Who really cares whether people leave the damn IMDB link anyhow?  How friggin hard is it to just go to IMDB in another tab and look up the movie.  Stop bitching!  You took more time in typing your comment than you would have used simply looking the movie up on your own.
