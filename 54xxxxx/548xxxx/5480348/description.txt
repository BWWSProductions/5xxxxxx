Kowalski is excited about the completion of his time machine, which he calls "Chronotron". While looking for the chemical needed to finish the time machine, Kowalski's future self comes to Private and tells him to stop his present self from completing his Chronotron. After Private finally convinced Kowalski to destroy the Chronotron, another Kowalski from the future came to Skipper to tell the present Kowalski to save the Chronotron. After fighting over the chemical, the two Kowalski's appeared. The present Kowalski accidentally spotted them, so a dark vortex appeared and started swallowing everything. A future Kowalski activated the Chronotron and went back in time to talk to Private. The other future Kowalski went back in time to talk to Skipper. Rico just threw the Chronotron in the vortex, disabling it. Skipper insists Kowalski invents something that won't destroy the world. Private insists a snowcone machine so Kowalski builds it only covering the world in snowcone. Skipper is in front of the flooded Statue of Liberty calling Kowalski a maniac. The others appeared and Kowalski told Skipper, "Yup, but you gotta admit, these are good snowcones!" then Skipper responded "Oh, yeah, sure, totally worth it!"
