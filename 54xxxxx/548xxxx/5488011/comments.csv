,OneHitGamer,2010-04-17T05:09Z,Download the latest update and burn it or put on flash drive. this will allow you to update while being banned. then your videos will work etc.

I tried using the latest update with this program but it doesent work."
,popertuo,2010-04-17T18:43Z,"Do note that system updates do not contain the video codec stuff - for that you will need to go online once on Xbox Live, and the downloaded codec is xbox and/or HD dependent."

Yes i have the media update. But do you mean that i need to have an harddisk to play the videos streaming to my console?"

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5483810/Xbox_360_NXE_Dashboard_[06.04.2010]_[2.0.9199]_UNLOCK_HARD_DISC

it will unban your unit also let you back online hence your update"
