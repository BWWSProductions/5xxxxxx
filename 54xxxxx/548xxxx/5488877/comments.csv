,troll33,2011-10-01T12:48Z,Have to say sorry to everyone out there! I normally seed the hell out of everything I download but cuz of hardware issues I can't. Sorry people but I will have it sorted in a couple of weeks and I will re-seed everything I have downloaded recently. I pride myself on a good ratio cuz all uploaders are the best and it means I can get stuff I wouldn't normally have. Sorry again and keep up the fantastic work!!!
