,drake_nightfire,2010-07-25T01:06Z,for some reason the resource downloader wonty recognise my serial number and i cant render any textures.
,ManticMan,2010-09-01T17:29Z,"""For some reason..."" Yeah, obviously the Spiral Graphics server isn't cracked. Heh.

Resource downloads seemed to work here at first when running in demo mode, but now I'm not able to connect to their server at all. Could just be me... it seemed awfully sluggish even when it worked.

In any case, has anyone been kind enough to share a completely downloaded ""Resource Library"" directory?

If not, that would be very helpful ;)

Cheers again for sharing this!"

this one is good, though it wont open newest texture packs :/

If you want the texture resources just download the free genetica viewer and use that to download all the goods ;) then point genetica to them.. ;)
enjoy"
