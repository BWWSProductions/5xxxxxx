"THE BIG "O""  

Kristina's (Monica Potter) constant worrying affects her and 
Adam's (Peter Krause) sex life, and the worrying only gets 
worse when Max (Max Burkholder) starts working with Gaby 
(guest star Minka Kelly), a young behavioral aide. Sarah 
(Lauren Graham) debates whether she should go out on a date 
with Amber's (Mae Whitman) teacher Mr. Cyr (guest star Jason 
Ritter). Meanwhile, Crosby (Dax Shepard) tries to muster up 
the courage to tell his parents about Jabbar (Tyree Brown) 
and Julia (Erika Christensen) gets jealous of a mom in Joel's 
(Sam Jaeger) playgroup.

Enjoy :)
