,seanee,2010-04-28T18:00Z,its missing stuff i just wasted a dvd on this keeps asking for disk 1
,omega59,2010-05-01T18:03Z,"This is like the 2010 release it wont install if mounted or burned. You have to decompress the files to a folder on hdd, then run setup and it's fine. Nothing is missing from the max app your a moron! thx."
,redbaron1946,2010-05-16T19:45Z,THIS WORKS COMPLETELY YOU WILL HAVE TO DECOMPRESS THE MAX  FILE TO YOUR COMPUTER TO USE AND THEKEYGEN ACTIVATION WILL BE 8 NUMBERS SHORT AND IT WORKS I THOUGHT IT WASNT GOING TO WORK BUT IT WORKED THANKS FOR THIS
,osirisgothra,2010-05-20T11:01Z,"it asks for disk 1 if you use poweriso or other virtual drive emulators that do not _fully_ emulate drive behavior, use uTorrent lite works fine. Also, don't burn with substandard software- this will defeat the purpose of burning it. And one more thing---this torrent and many others assume that the user isn't a complete moron when it comes to using their PC... there i said it. (remember the days when the only people who had computers were people that knew how to use one?)"
,cspinbrew,2010-10-29T01:57Z,"DVD1 segment 66 throws an error during decompression.  I'm downloading only that segment again but I'm not holding my breath.  That'll be 3 days of download time (yeah yeah, swizzle stick for a data pipe) I'll never get back."
