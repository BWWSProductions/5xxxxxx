Don Francisco (born February 28, 1946) is an indie American singer/songwriter whose most notable work was released during the 1970's and 1980's, the "Jesus movement" of early contemporary Christian music. His music is primarily acoustic, lacking a highly "produced" sound. Many of his songs, including the hit "He's Alive", feature a ballad style or speaking through music that interprets or retells Biblical events. Some of his songs, such as "I Don't Care Where You've Been Sleepin'" and "Gotta Tell Somebody", have been considered controversial in conservative Christian circles.

The artist has given general permission to copy and distribute all his works freely by any not-for-profit means, as long as his URL is included:  http://www.donfrancisco.com

NOTE that the Collections Volumes I-III are re-recordings of selected songs from his early (1976-1994) works. They are the original arrangements and by the original artist, and in my opinion they are very good; but they are not what you heard in the 70's.  If anyone has any of his albums from 1976-1994, please contact me. I would like a copy for myself, and I will add them to a new torrent.
