,janhab65,2010-04-09T16:07Z,Is the serial insde this file? thx for the uppload Bakjoo.
,kpbradley,2010-04-09T21:08Z,Is this a clean copy? And yea are is the serial included
,Sven the swede,2010-04-09T23:55Z,"OEM means that the copy is clean (i.e. no activator is included). However, I think that something is weird with this torrent as it was uploaded 10:02 and now 23:47 there are still no other seeders than the uploader. I think the uploader probably did something wrong when he started seeding the torrent. "
,Sven the swede,2010-04-09T23:59Z,Hmm. When I updated the seeds it actually seems like a couple of people finished the download. I guess the uploaders connection is stuck in 1996 then. 
,kpbradley,2010-04-10T00:24Z,So is it worth downloading?
,tigersager,2010-04-11T05:38Z,i need more seeds! seed me pleas!
[T],bakjoo,2010-04-11T18:15Z,This is a OEM version and you don't have to have a serialnumber it make it by it self
[T],bakjoo,2010-04-11T18:17Z,I have uploded 7Gb of this torrent
,Elvir666,2010-04-12T01:24Z,Why noone is seeding ?!?!?!?! Are you nuts you fucking selfish idiots...fuck i cant belive this !
,dead_pirate_st3v3,2010-04-12T06:29Z,Is anybody past 84.9% bakjoo if you up a torrent don't you think it's pointless if you don't make sure there are enough seeders before you kill it?? Maybe you could seed it for half a day??? maybe tomorrow... It would be. you know NORMAL....And you'd be getting thanks instead of ppl adding you to a list you don't want to be on..
,Leshalles,2010-04-19T06:26Z,"Is this activated? Does it use a loader, or some kind of volume license key?

thanks."
,Cardone28,2010-04-21T22:04Z,anyone else having issues with this? I cant get past setup. Getting an error that says the Driver Can not Be Found... any suggestions?

,SuperLeech4000,2010-04-25T23:39Z,Great Torrent!
,sushi_wasabi,2010-04-26T23:19Z,"ei! awesome download! by the way i just have a question.. i installed the os today worked perfectly fine! and i just noticed that on the system properties it says ""30 days to activate."" i'm just worried if i need to have a product key in order for me to activate the os or where i can find the product key since you said that ""This is a OEM version and you don't have to have a serialnumber it make it by it self."" please help.. thanks a lot!"
,robbingzombies,2010-05-10T11:54Z,worked! Thank you. when it prompts you for the key click next. it will insert the key for you.
,Lonepup,2010-05-11T06:49Z,"This install worked so well, I'm helping to seed it a 2nd time... and more.  (to ""reset"" I remove this torrent, move files back to the incomplete folder then start again). I don't think there will be a time limit on the install because it's an OEM version.

Awesome share! Windows 7 is so great (compared to VISTA) if everything stays ok, I will actually go and buy my own copy of this. It's great to try it out first before I buy it.

For once Microsoft did something right for Windows. 

Note to new down-loaders: Windows 7 does NOT come with an email client. You go to the Microsoft website and download the Windows Live package which includes several goodies including the new Live Email. fyi....

What I loved most about the Windows 7 install, was it was very quick, and it automatically installed the latest drivers for my computer. I was impressed.

Boot-up times is very quick compared to VISTA. And moving large files from one hard drive to another occurs in seconds instead of hours compared to VISTA.

Great share & thank you!

,Hoggy93,2010-05-12T19:44Z,Thanks Man..... :D   Works Great with My Custom Built Gaming Rig.....   I Love Eagle and Uploader... Thanks A Bunch you Guy's 100/100
,altrego99,2010-06-12T23:29Z,"I downloaded http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5129465/Windows_7_Ultimate_AIO_Activated (currently most popular).

It had many corrupt files, I downloaded this one to cure the inconsistencies in my installation. Wish I downloaded this from the beginning, since I had to use an additional loader (DAZ loader) anyway with the 'activated' torrent.

Also I can boot from this into the repair command line prompt, but I cannot with the one I downloaded.

Great job, quality added. Thanks."
,buttheadgsxr1000,2010-06-18T04:13Z,"Thanks for this one, hope it works."
,Mono99099,2010-06-21T05:38Z,Testing this on VMWare before booting it up.
,Mono99099,2010-06-21T06:22Z,"took a while, but this is genuine, and windows thinks it is too!"
,johny1313,2010-07-02T02:07Z,Excellent! Thanks!!
,eldaras,2010-07-11T18:23Z,"Damn, I installed this a few hours ago and I got the message saying that it\'s not a genuine version :(.nnI haven\'t disabled auto updates, so I got the KBxxxxx update that kills the other versions of windows (like the ultimate AIO)."
,MsRed,2010-07-14T21:42Z,"Okay, so I\'ve downloaded it (thanx 4 sharing), but it\'ll be my first time with Win 7 and I don\'t want to mess up. I have not found an \""instruction sheet\"" so I\'m kind of lost.rnAfter I install it, is there anything I need to do so the OS is activated and ready to use wihtout any... \""issues\"" with M$?rnThank you!"
,MsRed,2010-07-16T18:28Z,"Since I got no responses I did it all myself. Intall fine, W7 manage to install the dreaded \""update\"" KB**1033, even though I made sure I unchecked the box. But W7 Loader 1.8.7 worked its magic and I have an activated, genuine Windows 7."
,12642,2010-08-08T00:45Z,"Thank You so much for this! I could barley afford to build a new pc much less spend $100 on a OS. Work perfectly, and auto imputed the serial automatically. Good Karma for you!


I'm also wondering if I should turn off automatic updates?"
,zacksully,2010-08-15T14:38Z,guys can we do updates? i just download the torrent and im only wondering about that?

,LeoBell,2010-12-17T21:28Z,"Does this still work? Also when you say I do not need to put in a key, does that mean I can update or not? just to put my mind at rest thanks"
,liamf91,2011-02-26T03:48Z,"iv tried other ""OEMs"" but it doesnt activate.

will the loader run automatically after install? or will i need to put the loader on the system seperately?"
,liamf91,2011-02-27T23:56Z,well this OEM doesnt work. brings up an error message that files are not available
,MrPhillip,2011-03-05T17:23Z,WORTHLESS!!!!!!!! tested on win7 home premium-64bit. Files missing. WASTE OF TIME!!!
,F1NGERAPE,2011-08-13T03:17Z,"Not sure what everybody is complaining about, downloaded this using VMware on my MacBook Pro 15' Early 2011 for PC Games. However, I felt that VMware was slowing down my computer's performance, so I booted it up using Boot Camp, still worked excellent! Thanks!"
