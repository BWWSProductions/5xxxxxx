Cambridge university press | ISBN: 0521011841 | English | 2002 | DJVU | 419 pages | 13 Mb

This book provides a clear and elegant account of the development of Spanish over the last 2000 years. Although principally oriented towards 'internal' history, 'external' history is considered in outline in the Introduction and is referred to throughout. 

This is a thoroughly revised, updated and expanded edition of Ralph Penny's authoritative textbook, first published in 1991. As well as adding insights from recent scholarship throughout the text, Professor Penny has added a new chapter which discusses the nature of linguistic history, the concept of World Spanish, processes of convergence and divergence in Spanish, and the English/Spanish interface. 

This edition also contains a glossary of technical terms, guidance on further reading, and suggested topics for discussion. Written as a textbook, the comprehensive coverage of the major varieties of Spanish given here will be welcomed by scholars and students alike.

This is a .djvu file and requires a .djvu viewer. I have included WinDjView (an Open Source viewer from sourceforge.net) in a .zip file.
