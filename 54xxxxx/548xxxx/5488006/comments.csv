There's only some kind of WINZIP programme in the file!"
,TheGreatBunghole,2011-06-06T10:58Z,"It is in .djvu file format... it is a book, and Idk why ""janvincentbeeckman"" couldn't just look that up before complaining...  The other thing that is in a ZIP file is an installer for a program that lets you view .djvu file-formatted books on your computer. I haven't downloaded this yet, but I looked at the files included in the torrent, and it does have the book... plus ""artpepper"" DID state very clearly in the first line that is was a DJVU file..."
