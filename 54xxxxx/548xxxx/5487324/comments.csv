[V],r3dcat,2010-04-09T10:33Z,"@morgan1212: Google translated your comment as ""why can you not put iso file?"" ... 

To answer your question, the wbfs format is MUCH better for several reasons 

1. Smaller file size makes it better for distribution as well as archiving.

2. It does not require any modification for distribution (does not need to be rar'ed and unrar'ed)

3. Does not require any modification to play from hard drive. You can literally drop the file into your wbfs folder on a FAT32/NTFS drive and play.

4. Makes archiving/backup and restore much easier.

5. Makes seeding easier as you can keep a backup of your drive on your PC and directly seed from it ""as is"" without having to repack/compress files for distribution.

6. WBFS formatted drives are prone to corruption and there are limited utilities to use for recovery. FAT32/NTFS formatted drives hosting .wbfs files are a more secure and versatile option.

There may well be other reasons that I have overlooked but these are the main ones for me :)"
[V],r3dcat,2010-04-09T11:06Z,I also should have added ... Converting/extracting an .iso file from a .wbfs file is really no different to extracting an iso from a rar file/archive! ... Usually most if not all iso releases are rar'ed for distribution ... So even for users requiring iso's there is no real difference in the process :)
