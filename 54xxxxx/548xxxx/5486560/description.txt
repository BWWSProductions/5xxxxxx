       2/8 - Total Wipeout is back for another series of bumps, crunches, 
       smashes and splashes. Once again 20 foolhardy Brits throw their 
       caution and dignity to the wind on the purpose-built obstacle 
       course in Argentina, hoping that their bodies hold out long enough 
       to capture a 10,000 pound first prize.
       
       Richard Hammond is the master of ceremonies, commentating and 
       commenting on the unfolding carnage, while Amanda Byram is his 
       mistress of mirth, stifling a few giggles at the side of the 
       course.
       
       The 2010 Total Wipeout course has new games and challenges, 
       including the evil Motivator, a gargantuan mallet to help unwary 
       contestants across the Big Red Balls; Crash Mountain, the evil 
       offspring of the Sweeper; and a terrifying new Wipeout Zone.
