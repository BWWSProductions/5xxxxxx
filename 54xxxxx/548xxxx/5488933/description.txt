NONE OF MY HDTV MOVIE RIPS HAVE LOGOS!


From the director of the "Naked Gun" and starring the creators of "South Park"

BASEketball is a 1998 American David Zucker comedy starring South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with Dian Bachar, Robert Vaughn, Ernest Borgnine, Yasmine Bleeth, and Jenny McCarthy. 

The movie follows the history of the sport of the same name, from its invention by the lead characters as a game they could win against more athletic types, to its development as a nationwide league sport and a target of corporate sponsorship. This is the only one of Parker's and Stone's works that was not written, directed, and/or produced by them.
