"Sepulveda" 

David's (Shaun Sipos) new role as a restaurant owner is put to 
the test after he loses some of his wait staff on the day an 
important food critic has come to review Coal. In an effort to 
get David to forgive her, Lauren (Stephanie Jacobsen) pitches 
in as a waitress and hostess and helps him out of his jam. 
Ella (Katie Cassidy) wants to hack into the WPK files to erase 
the fake evidence against her for embezzlement, but Jonah 
(Michael Rady) strongly disagrees with her tactics, so she 
looks to David for help. With Drew's (Nick Zano) help, Riley 
(Jessica Lucas) throws a fundraiser for her education 
foundation but when Drew tries to increase the donations by 
auctioning off a date with Riley, things go awry after Drew 
and Jonah get into a bidding war.

Enjoy :)
