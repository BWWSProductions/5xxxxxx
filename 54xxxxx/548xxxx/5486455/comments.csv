Re your quark posts - I have Skjult, the Colbert Report (from the Talk Show Pack), and s14e04 of South Park.  I use the VLC player and pipe the shows to my 32"" analog TV.  They all look very good there.  You have done an excellent job with your quark compression, and I look forward to future quark encodes.

BTW, I downloaded a 175MB version of the same South Park episode.  I played them side by side in in two instances of VLC, and synced them up.  The only differences I could see, aside from size, were (1) that the colours (Canadian spelling) were ever-so-slightly darker in the quark version, mainly only noticeable in walls and carpets, and (2) smaller circuit traces on the Tron suits blurred a little.  Entirely acceptable.  And at less than 1/7th the other file size... !!!

Great work.
