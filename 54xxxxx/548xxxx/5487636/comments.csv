,STARATOM,2010-04-16T14:38Z,"ALL THIS IS, IS THE IN STUDIO COMMENTARY AND SHOWING NONE OF THE ACTUAL FOOTBALL MATCH.
THE STUDIO COMMENTARY IS INTERESTING BUT I AM AFTER THE ACTUAL MATCH, WHICH THIS IS CLEARLY NOT.

TvTeam SHOULD TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD THIS WHICH THEY DON'T......SHAME ON THEM."
