,buzz_uk,2010-04-09T08:29Z,@tordajav. dvd and bluray rips are consistently available several weeks before the retail release date. the retail release date is just there for marketing purposes and doesn't mean gold masters/final batches of the dvd's and blurays haven't already been produced and therefore leaked.
,leviathan_II,2010-04-09T08:58Z,"I don't know what everyone above is on about. This is Awful!

Nowhere near DVD copy, full of compression squares, blurry lines and really really poor colour.

Honestly, most of us would have acquired a pretty good version by now, something that will get us through the long wait for the real DVD release and BluRay. I don't see why people still keep on uploading these worthless versions???"

,roryt,2010-04-12T09:05Z,Yeah Im surprised w/ the quality FXG is usually always on point. I just compared this file with the TS release by MAX something i think way back on 12-20-09 and the TS has slightly better video quality. I'm really waiting for the bluray copy tho anyway!

,hofrank,2011-02-27T21:30Z,"Not very good quality, but it's free!"

The copy clear and easy to watch.  The sound is good being at a volume where I don't have to screw the voume to max to hear it.  Picture to sound sync is 'spot on'
""Day1302 and hofrank "" are wankers, take a note of the whingers so you can ignore their mindless drivel on other torrents.  You will see the same whinging people all the time.  If they had a bar of gold they'd complain that is was not shiney!
If the Movie Police email you GET AN IP BLOCKER!
AND IF YOU WANT TO DOWN-LOAD, SEED TO SAY THANK YOU AND HELP OTHERS.  There is only one thing better than seeding and that is to seed for longer."
,velcroman0001,2011-07-24T07:34Z,The movie quality is great sound is in sync with the movie.  Day1303 and Jcateau are wankers.  That a note of these idiots so you can ignore their drivel on other torrents.  If some one gave them a bar of gold they'd whinge that is wasn't shiney enough!  SEED SEED SEED.

Vid is great but ofc dun expect 3D like vid okay?
and fast download too"
,poot,2012-05-26T03:54Z,"This is a nice file size with decent quality for an 18inch or under compared to the rest but if this is your first time seeing the movie do not download it. It is missing 70% of the subtitles, so even if you add a subtitles track in vlc it will get screwed up by the 30% they included. No idea what fxg was thinking with this one."
,senssuiy,2012-06-18T11:50Z,great man thanks...
