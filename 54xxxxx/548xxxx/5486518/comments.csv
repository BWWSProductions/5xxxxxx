,nastybrother24,2010-04-08T21:17Z,is this a disc that i just but in my 360 like the dragon age add on
,sunbleached,2010-04-08T22:38Z,"You will need to have Borderlands to play this, as well as a modded xbox360.  It doesn't matter if your borderlands disc is store-bought or a backup, but you will need it [this add on disc doesn't contain the game files needed to play anything without the original game]

If your xbox360 isnt modded, you'll want to google ""mod xbox 360 New York [or your city]"" and find someplace like this  : http://toronto.nowtoronto.com/ElectronicsForSale/30-premium-xbox-360-mod-and-services-all-drives-quick-and-professional/2359151 to mod it for you. Then you can download games from piratebay, burn them to dual layer discs using imgburn and start your collection. [make sure to find a tutorial on how to burn backup xbox 360 games properly - dont worry, it's very easy]"

,Fan1,2010-04-09T08:57Z,"Hi! I have a couple of questions:
1. Is this fake or real?
2. Is this in Italy language only or does it have english as well?
3. PAL or NTSC?"
,Fan1,2010-04-09T08:59Z,Forgot to ask is this 'The secret armory of General Knoxx' or the previous addons?
