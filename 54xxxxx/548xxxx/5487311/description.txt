The Usual Suspects is a 1995 American neo-noir  film written by Christopher McQuarrie and directed by Bryan Singer. The film follows the interrogation of Roger "Verbal" Kint (Kevin Spacey), a small-time con man who is one of the only survivors of a massacre and massive fire that have just taken place on a ship docked at the Port of Los Angeles. He tells his interrogator, U.S. Customs Agent David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), a convoluted story about events that lead him and four other high-profile criminals to the boat, and of a mysterious mob-boss known as "Keyser Soze" who commissioned their work. Using flashback and narration, Kint's story becomes increasingly complex as he tries to explain why he and his partners-in-crime were on the boat.


The film, shot on a $6 million budget, originally began as a title taken from a column in Spy magazine called "The Usual Suspects," after one of Claude Rains's most memorable lines in Casablanca. Singer thought that it would be a good title for a film, the poster for which he and McQuarrie had developed as the first visual idea.


The Usual Suspects was shown out of competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival,[1] and then initially released in few theaters. It received favorable reviews, and was eventually given a wider release. McQuarrie won an Academy Award for the screenplay and Spacey won the Best Supporting Actor award for his performance.
