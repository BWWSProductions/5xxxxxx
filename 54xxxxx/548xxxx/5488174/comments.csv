,zerosk8a,2010-09-14T05:09Z,NTSC or PAL?
,zerosk8a,2010-09-15T02:32Z,"Saimor, i thank you for the upload. 

I must say however, that out of the whole 2lions team, you are the only idiot that doesnt know how to put a region code or specify whether it is NTSC or PAL. If you didnt realize it, here in the USA we cant play PAL on most dvd players, and that is why it is so crucial that we know. SO PLEASE IN THE FUTURE PUT NTSC OR PAL"
