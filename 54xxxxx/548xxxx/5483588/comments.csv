[V],sailo,2010-04-12T09:46Z,"get a new computer or dvd player, bitrate too high for your shitty old machine"
,Antimaden,2010-04-14T11:33Z,Mmmm...German Audio only...
,russell1nash,2010-04-15T22:57Z,"well, i do have problems as well playing this on a core2duo @2.53 GHz, 4 Gb RAM and a 9400 GT with 1 Gb...  On VLC, PowerDVD, KMPlayer and ZoomPlayer...
Also having troubles on 2 standalones, LG and a no brand. 

Never had any troubles playing any of Silo's dvds up to this point. I luv your work, esp for the subs. But this one is not working for me. "
,LunD86,2010-04-26T12:25Z,"Its kinda weird. 

Almost every movie i download from piratebay, works only on my DVD player, but when i play them om my Blyray player, there are sound delays, and movie laggs. 

This one i opposite, works great on my bluray, but not on my DVD."
,jc128842,2010-05-03T04:55Z,"I ran this DVD on 2 DVD players, a desktop, and a laptop with audio sync, and video stuttering on all. Reburned the DVD and the problems continued."
,eugene51,2010-05-08T00:14Z,"No menus, no subtitles. A waste of time."
,martin1841,2010-06-20T12:37Z,"Ok i watched the movie and is quite good. 
There is standard menu and lots of subs. There are also some problems, few minutes after the start the movie runs very slow(stutter) for few minutes. Then runs normally for more than hour after that again starts running slow for few minutes then again runs normally. So in the end movie is watchable in 90% of the time or maybe 95%. These bad 5% you can also watch(but this is pain in the ass) or just skip."
,fredfan,2011-08-01T18:37Z,"Please keep seeding.  This seems to go in and out for seeders.  I'll comment when done on how the quality (reported stuttering) is after I'm done.  Thanks, all."
,fredfan,2011-08-08T14:15Z,"Well, a bit into the first few minutes there are some SLIGHT framerate issues, but still very watchable.  Near the end, however, the disc stopped and went back to the main menu.  I went into the chapters and fast forwarded past the trouble spot and thought I missed a couple minutes, could continue watching.  Otherwise GREAT video and awesome directional sound.  The movie itself is good, but all the space/sci-fi themes have already been done.  Maybe this copy should be replaced to keep up sailo's rep...

Thanks for your efforts as always."
