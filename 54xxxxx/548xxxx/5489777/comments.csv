,mikexxxryan,2010-04-11T21:43Z,"I'm a longtime user of Disk Warrior.  I backup to an external drive once a month then boot to that BU and run DW on my main boot drive.  Every time I do this I am no longer able to boot to the main boot drive.  DW does something to it and I'm forced to use the restart-optionkey which lists my bootable options.  The main boot drive is not identified by its name but does show as EFI.  If I chose it I can boot into my main boot drive.

So something is NOT kosher with DW v4.2

I don't know about this 4.1 r42 release."
[T],nobody2007,2010-04-13T12:27Z,"DiskWarrior 4.2 is published on 2009-08-28. Why do you seed something that is already older than 1.5 years? Why this file is 2 times bigger than the others here on PB?

[T],nobody2007,2010-04-13T12:29Z,"sorry, I mean DiskWarrior 4.11, NOT 4.2"
,MikeXRyan,2011-03-07T02:13Z,"This IS the latest release, there is no 4.11 release (Duh...)

I found how to fix the reboot from main drive I note above.  Simply go to Utilities and run Disk Utitlity - Disk Repair.  It resets the boot sector and when you restart the system comes up quickly."
