Billy Holiday-Songs for DistinguÃ© Lovers (1957) re-mastered 1997




Mp3 320 kbps 44 kHz

Comprising the last five studio dates Holiday did for Verve, SONGS FOR DISTINGUE LOVERS finds Lady Day operating within her ideal environment; that of a small jazz combo. Accompanied by a legendary line-up including Sweets Edison, Ben Webster and Barney Kessel, Holiday sang with the clear enunciation and easy swing that had become her trademark. 

Wrapping her phrasing around standards by Rodgers & Hart, The Gershwins and Cole Porter, Billie Holiday demonstrated how years of singing with various jazz bands sharpened her ability to turn a song on its head through slight fluctuations in pitch and tone color.

All tracks have been digitally remastered.
