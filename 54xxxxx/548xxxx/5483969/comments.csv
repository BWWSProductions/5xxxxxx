,Welverin,2010-04-07T01:00Z,"Thanks for the torrent!
Sometimes, one forgets where we all began!
Any chance of hitting some of the ol' originals, like Dracula and Frankenstein?"
,tordajav,2010-04-07T02:12Z,"I went to you-tube to see a trailer and saw one funny comment:
""ILuvGaara1011"" wrote: my mom watched this movie when she was in elementary school. she said it was terrifying and i laughed. :p"
,Focus88,2010-04-10T18:08Z,Thanks
,ThanatosDarque,2010-04-20T08:22Z,Great movie yet again FXG I am glad to see that the old classics have not been forgotten :)

,Koshiki,2010-11-30T08:13Z,"This is sci-fi. Sy/fy is a sellout organization who took a niche-oriented channel and are trying to distance themselves from the geeks their channel was originally directed toward, including the name change.

Doubtful Syfy would run Them! at this point... it looks too good compared to their movie of the week schlock like 'Sharktopus!'."
,AnotherStranger,2011-01-15T03:16Z,Thanks but this looks suspiciously stretched out - a look at IMDb also tells the original aspect ratio is 1.37:1 and voila! - simply use VLC to force 4:3 and the movie suddenly looks just as it should. :)
,BTSOW,2011-03-24T22:22Z,"I was surprised to see you had this and I just had to download it! Thanks, man!"
