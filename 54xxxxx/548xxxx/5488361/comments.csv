Both resulting iso files load well but in the first few seconds of the movie (the panning scene of the greek coast right after the introduction texts) the movie halts: the DVD Shrink ISO just causes VLC to stop, the CloneDVD ISO causes VLC to freeze up on image. When trying to deepscan and recreate the ISO CloneDVD mentions the DVD structure is corrupted. Now I want to stress here that I appreciate all the work, and I fully realise it's free shit so no bitching or moaning, but I just wanted people trying to download to know in advance what may happen. I am currently trying to use a few more tricks to get the VIDEO_TS directory up to scratch, will try and hit it with some image repair software, so I'll let you know if I'm able to find a fix. If I can't, then any suggestions you guys can give me are more than welcome. As always: live long and download :-D"
