,SpandauBaby,2010-04-08T20:10Z,Thankyou Sir!
,annatar777,2010-04-09T13:14Z,Can you tell me the bitrate please ? Looking for v0 rips only. _ Thanks. 
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-04-09T22:57Z,"Various bitrates, all different but as good as possible for all these.  You will find that on most of them they are the same bitrate throughout the whole album apart from a few that are slightly mixed but it's the best you can get, these are the best versions there are anywhere."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-04-18T13:48Z,"@Housezz: Say what pal?  This is the best Now collection in the whole torrent world.  I have the number one version haha, go crawl under a rock somewhere.  People download this from me because they know they are getting a quality torrent unlike some of yours which are probably junk torrents."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-04-18T13:53Z,"Also saying that, from looking at ALL those torrents you've made there non of them really make me wanna download from you.  Are you actually sharing anything that's good amongst all that?  It doesn't look like it to me, if you were such a high flyer on here then you wouldn't come to my torrent and try and rubbish it.  I obviously put far more effort into making mine.

Go and cry somewhere else please, I have better things to do with my time."
,quutar,2010-05-13T00:05Z,"One thing I ran into with this entire series of torrents is that they are the UK VERSIONS! A lot of the early ones were full of music I'd never heard of while missing things I knew should be there, that's why."
,skullpup,2010-05-14T20:44Z,This is the worst load of crap ever

,RaveParadise,2010-08-07T18:02Z,"For the attention of people that are seeding this torrent.  This is SpandauBaby, I am sorry to say that I have been forced to use another account because the bastards at Pirate Bay have screwed my account up and I cannot use it anymore.  I have lost all my access to my SpandauBaby one.  I have had to leave Pirate Bay because of this fact and have now moved over to demonoid instead.  I have also decided to leave because somebody has started reuploading this torrent again and is trying to make out that it's their work.  I was the one responsible for putting this Now collection together.  It took me ages and lots of hard work to manage to tag all the files like this, I spent hours on end working on it so I could deliver this torrent in the quality that it is.

I regret to say that somebody called Stun has copied my torrent and also somehow managed to upload all 5 torrents of this collection as 1 single torrent and I don't know how they could have done that because I tried ages ago and Pirate Bay tracker won't allow you to do such a thing with so many loose files.

I have just recently been bullied now by a moderator on here who is denying the fact that somebody is reuploading my work again claiming it to be theirs and threatening to take action.  I personally think this sucks and this is exactly what you get from using this site.  I am happy to move over to demonoid now instead, I have simply had enough of this place.  I originally made this Now torrent and received a pink skull for my efforts for my SpandauBaby account but this is now useless because Pirate Bay have blocked me from my own acccount and didn't even offer to help.

My advice to people seeding this is to seed this and not the other version uploaded by Stun as this is the correct version and hasn't been tampered with.  I cannot guarantee you would receive the same quality version of this from that other version.

Thanks for listening, SpandauBaby"
