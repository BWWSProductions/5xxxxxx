,stumpstarr,2010-07-05T16:45Z,"A grand US tradition, the format of a 'roast', is a simple one: a group of people called 'roastmasters' gather together in front of a live audience to make fun of a subject and celebrate all that is good about the 'roastee'. While the tone may seem cutting, sarcastic or salacious, at its heart, the 'roast' is in fact a genuine and affectionate celebration of the talent.

Channel 4's A Comedy Roast honours three bastions of British entertainment: Bruce Forsyth, Sharon Osbourne and Chris Tarrant. Each hour long show features some of the country's finest comedic talents, as well as a selection of showbiz pals and acquaintances of the guest of honour, who each in turn deliver a humorous, irreverent, possibly rude, but always affectionate comedy tribute to the living legend.

Hosted by Jimmy Carr, A Comedy Roast features comedic talents and showbiz friends including Sean Lock, Jack Dee, Jonathan Ross, Jason Manford, Jon Culshaw, Alan Carr and more - all of whom 'roast' different aspects of the subject's life, providing hilarious, mischievous and affectionate tributes.

Set in a glamorous ballroom, A Comedy Roast takes inspiration from the New York Friars' Club of the 1920s where the Roasts originated. Just like then, 'victims' are subjected to a mix of insults, tall tales and tributes from their friends - all taken in the best of spirits."
