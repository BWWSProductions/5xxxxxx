J. S. Bach - The Organ Works - The Complete Collection - Peter Hurford

All of J. S. Bach's known works for organ played by Peter Hurford on a variety of organs located in different parts of the world.

A truly masterful, structurally clear and rythmically precise interpretation by Peter Hurford which allows Bach's genius for creating this kind of music to really shine. This is why I personally prefer this particular recording.

The recorded sound is also superb, as on most Decca recordings from this period.

Ripped from CD with EAC and converted into mp3 using the LAME converter which results in excellent sound and comparatively small files.

The collection consists of 6 volumes:
Vol 1 Toccatas, Fantasias, Preludes, Fugues (CD 1-3)
Vol 2 Clavier-Ã¼bung III, Chorale preludes, Sonatas (CD 4-6)
Vol 3 Chorale Variations, SchÃ¼bler chorale preludes, Concertos (CD 7-9)
Vol 4 Neumeister chorales, Chorale preludes (CD 10-12)
Vol 5 Preludes & Fugues (CD 13-15)
Vol 6 OrgelbÃ¼chlein, Chorale preludes (CD 16-17)

Tracklist for each CD included in its folder.

Interview with Peter Hurford and a cover sample from the first CD is also included.

Please enjoy and share!
