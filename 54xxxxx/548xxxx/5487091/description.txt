JUNKBUCKET

The most terrifying tale of slasher horror has been unleashed, and heâ€™s coming for your JUNK. A parody of slasher films of the 1980's (and the Friday the 13th series in particular), Junkbucket is a loving satire guaranteed to offend you with your own laughter. Also, there's a lot of dick jokes. 





JUNKBUCKET is the story of a cabin, the woods, drunk and horny teenagers, and a masked mongoloid killer who cuts off peopleâ€™s junk to make up for the fact that his were severed by his mother when he was just a baby.   Six friends head to a remote cabin on Lake Pakajanomo to get drunk, high, naked and fuck.  Their fun is interrupted however when a local legend known for terrorizing teens begins to separate them from their fun parts.  The kids fight for their lives as one by one they meet grisly, untimely ends.



JUNKBUCKET is a production of The Beta Society, a Seattle WA based film collective.  The film went from conception to first screening in just over two months, on a budget of $1600.  If you enjoyed the film please visit http://www.thebetasociety.com to check out our other videos.  



Heâ€™s not a garbage man, but heâ€™s come for your JUNK.
