I downloaded A2A WOPII some time ago, and RECENTLY ACCUSIM B-17 and installed....I must have done something wrong, because the installation has been KATHUMPED!!! along with my fsx program by A2A I'm assumming? 
my question is how can I recover from here?
I don't want to re-install the whole FSX thing, and if I do, isn't there a finger print left behind? CAN I RE INSTALL!"
