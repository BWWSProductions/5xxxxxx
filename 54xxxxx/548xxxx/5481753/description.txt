Get ready for the wildest sexpionage caper ever! You can bet your Aston-Martin that crack secret agent James Bomb will sniff out many a "foreign affair" as payment-in-full FOR SERVICES RENDERED. It all starts when evilly delicious Nocturna ...    Full DescriptionVigil and her hot hit girl Tasti Delite steal some sexually incriminating microfilm from the Soviet Embassy. Called to the London office, James must retrieve the microfilm in "Operation Thunderpussy". Traveling across Europe, Mr. Bomb and his horny assistant Carstairs stay hot on the tail...ah, trail until Carstair corners Nocturna and pumps her for more than information. The action gets wilder and wilder until James recovers the microfilm and delivers the goods in London where he learns more than he bargained for about Tasti.
