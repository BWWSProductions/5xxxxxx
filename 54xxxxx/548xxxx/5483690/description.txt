Eiznek as a band released 2 albums. Based in Texas & Toronto,this industrial influenced,goth melancholy,and electronic band was recently ended shortly after releasing the self-titled debut album. Feeling i had abandoned the once alter-ego of myself and the project,i felt i needed to give Eiznek a proper end...an epilogue of instrumentals programmed by m.a.j.(myself) with some assistance by ArtV(a.k.a. guitarist/bassist)

 Eiznek II:Epilogue is a personal and grotesque struggle with depression,suicide,and addictions. Before and during these recordings Eiznek became mentally and physically isolated,very dangerous to himself and others,and began using morphine/stimulants on a regular basis and soon dropped off the radar...for these reasons and many others,the Eiznek project was brought to an end. The music created for this album contains little to no lyrics,but each track digs deeper and deeper with more meanings than any words could have. Also,it features the Halloween theme song,remixed by Eiznek.

FOR THE CURIOUS: The alter-ego "Eiznek" was Mike a. Jones who started creating industrial/goth/electro/etc. in high school with a close friend jOSH R. First,Cidehom was born in 2007-08 with a very positive local feedback,and after the album Chem- was released by Cidehom in 08,the two of us discontinued work due to personal circumstances for the time being. During Cidehom's hiatus,Eiznek began work on a solo record (that is currently finalized and for sale). I recruited canadian guitarist and bassist ArtV to help to bring classical/trip=hop/industrial/and experimental/etc. all into one drug-induced album. Eiznek II:Epilogue,however,has more electronic programming and very little ArtV due to the fact we are currently back at work with a new project...DaLvaL. So please help spread the word and spread the music. 

Thank you.
