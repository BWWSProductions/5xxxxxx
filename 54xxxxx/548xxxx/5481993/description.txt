#Glitch64 SVN r110#

Glitch64 SVN r110 is released.GlideHQ is a realtime texture enhancer library with hi-resolution texture pack support for Glide64.Glitch64 is the recommended Glide3x wrapper for Glide64, the Glide video plugin for N64 emulators. It currently supports S3TC texture compression, anisotropic filtering, widescreen resolutions and simulates almost all the Glide3x hardware capabilities used by the plugin, included texture buffer capability (needed for render to texture). It is coded using the OpenGL API and uses GLSL shaders.

Traditional and non-traditional techniques have been used to achieve speed and high image quality even on a 9 year old 3Dfx Voodoo2. Although the 3Dfx Glide3x texture format naming conventions are used, the library can be expanded for generic use. The library supports 6 enhancers and 6 image filters. FXT1 and S3TC texture compression are supported.

#Glide3x (09.03.24)#

Glide3x (09.03.24) is released.glide3x.dll is a process belonging to the Glide for Voodoo Banshee program . glide3x.dll is module which supports 3DFX (Voodoo) graphics devices with the Glide 3D drivers.

Glide3x (09.03.24) changelog:
* Modified all LFB reading code to use PBOs. Needs a video card which supports OpenGL 2.1-3.0
* Modified the LFB writing code to use dirty rects for texture writing. (only writes the portions of the texture that have changed, a usual optimization technique when writing to 2D surfaces) Depth buffer code still uses glDrawPixels normally.
Tested with Beetle Adventure Racing, got consistent 60FPS with REFB on. Still, dunno if its placebo or not, due to I having a PCIE card.
