,thadream101,2010-04-10T06:25Z,"http://www.kinopoisk.ru/
its a russian site and it is not 100% accurate as to when it will be released because R5 can be released in other places besides Russia also so really there are tons of sites I keep my eyes on
as for this torrent i'd say V:8 A:7 there was a few minutes of dark/blurry video and the audio was a little hollow in some parts but i watched the whole movie and didn't notice any sync problems...overall good release"

,phorqued,2010-04-20T16:28Z,"""Runtime | 01:45:21
Source | BLU-Ray""

I dont mean to get picky, but why would anyone lie about the source material for this movie? I'm sorry, but if this ""quality"" was ripped from Blu-Ray as it states, then why all of the crappy reviews? Oh thats right... it was an R5 release dubbed with a separate english audio track."
,major9211,2010-04-22T13:45Z,"just finished watching the movie, 
it a nice movie, and quality is good, its dvd rip quality and the sound is good too,

,oni4ever,2010-06-05T02:09Z,nice work man... thnx... v/a perfect (nobody should expect it as HD)
,libertaswv,2010-06-05T06:45Z,"First off - Thx for the up....sincerely appreciated.

2nd....If you're desperate to see the movie, this is a great copy to get until a straight rip comes along. If you are looking for an archive copy (hey, some people are completists), this definitely isn't it. 

Regardless of what many comments have said, this is not a single source release. It is not b-r.

The first half (ish....not going to go back and check) seems to come from something official.....Seems basically perfect. After a very brief glitchy bit, the source definitely changes.....My honest guess is cam. The switch is definitely noticeable, and the quality of the second source is sub-par. Additionally, in the beginning few minutes, though the V is perfect, there are syncing issues - they are resolved quickly though. 

Sound is a bit tinny, but okay. 

A/V (1st half) - 7 or 8/9
A/V (2nd half) - 7 or 8/5 or 6

(not counting the sync issue in the first few mins)

Thx again for the upload and to seeders everywhere"
