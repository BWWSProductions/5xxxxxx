,logtran001,2010-10-17T10:40Z,"THANKS, Mandarin is the language of the future.  German will always rule in Europe though."
,Superdub2,2010-10-20T23:24Z,Hi guys. i apologise in advance for being such an idiot but i have now downloaded this. But how do i know install the software and use it? From reading the additional info and comments i am guessing that i have to download seperate software? if so where is this? secondly then what is this i have downloaded? thanks in advance! a friendly but stupid irishman!
,cactusmanne,2010-12-17T22:07Z,I downloaded this and the app but i cant figure out what to mount in damen tools. Can someone please help me?
,katiemack,2010-12-24T04:25Z,"Hey, great torrent, uploader but... has anyone found the key to this?  Or a key?  Or something?  I'm doing the first unit here and I just realised it only gives you one lesson and bits of the rest, so... yeah?"
,poo4532,2011-01-03T00:56Z,"Definitely a high quality upload.  Unfortunately, its a horrible program to learn Chinese.  If you're serious about learning, sign up with Chinesepod and look into Pimsleur's and free FSL content."
,missdgaf,2011-01-18T10:04Z,"Ok im having alot of trouble..i dont understand what im doing wrong..i tried mounting files..but they are NOT iso files..they are rsd..i downloaded alot of this users languages. I also downloaded the 3.4.7 rosetta stone download before..now how am i supposed to get all these languages on it? People keep calling other people morons for not knowing and how we're supposed to mount to iso files using DAEMON Tools Lite..Well im confused where are these so called ""iso files""? Everytime i click to add a language it tells me to put in a CD..i also overwrite the application file with the cracked on and did not load the original like the steps said..I also opened the User manual to Rosetta Stone..and i talked about language ID or a serial number..So how do i get past this so called insert disk? No one ever said we had to burn anything..so can someone please give me step by step instructions so i can see what i did wrong? my email is miiss.dgaf@gmail.com Ive already spent 2 hours going back and forth uninstalling and reinstalling..i have daemon tools downloaded along with the rsd reader. Thanks"
,dclok1,2011-05-05T14:26Z,anyone know the serial / crack for this? 11111 and xxxxx don't work. Thanks.
,kohlfrog,2011-06-02T23:32Z,"@missdgaf (and anyone else with .iso or deamon tools problems.)

a .iso file is a virtual copy of a cd. What deamon tools does is create a virtual cd drive to read that disc.

Any time you have an .iso file that you want to use you will need to virtually mount it (Deamon tools or whatever you download should have some basic instructions) or you will need to burn it to disc which you would also need a program for. With .iso's of these sizes though you either need large discs or you would have better luck just doing it virutally with a deamon tools like program. I hope that helps you guys. Oh and after you mount it...it will run and act just as if you had stuck a disc in the cd drive(aside from the whirring and flashing light :P)"
,Biology13,2011-06-04T03:35Z,"Thanks a lot man, it works great!!! :D"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-06-10T21:59Z,"In the download you will found (if you look) 3 ISO files, 1 for each level. The other 249 files (minus 1 jpg) are mp3 audio companion files."
,ArabMcTogaGuy,2011-06-22T00:08Z,"I'm getting the same problem as danman, I don't know where I'm going after I've downloaded the items to a disc, can anyone help us? I'd really appreciate it! ;D"
,mb517,2011-07-08T02:36Z,"This is HIGHLY frustrating... The levels cannot be added to the Rosetta Stone App. The ISO files seem to be corrupted. They will not load using DAEMON Tools as a virtual CD drive, nor will they load when burned to a CD. You can't even read the CD after it's burned, even though the burn was verified successful. THESE NEED TO BE RE-DONE OR UPDATED. "
,k8sk8,2011-07-14T09:56Z,It worked properly but I couldn't go past lesson 2. It was asking for the activation code. What are the codes for the three levels?? Please! This is a great torrent but it sucks because the codes are not given
,Knives62895,2011-08-20T18:36Z,"******HOW TO INSTALL*************

1. download this Rosetta Stone Application
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3852202/The_Rosetta_Stone_Application_%28Version_3%29

2. download the 3.4.5 update
http://resources.rosettastone.com/rs3/updates/application/rosettastone/3.x_to_3.4.7/windows/update.exe

3. Download this torrent and mount or burn image files to cd and install language pack"
,xXSTR8FSXx,2011-08-21T21:50Z,"Works great! Installed the RS installer+crack from another torrent then mounted this with A120% and installed the language levels. I just have one problem: there is no audio companion that I can find in this torrent, not even in the ISO files."
,qoehze,2011-08-28T18:24Z,Can someone please tell me if this works with version 3.3.5 ???
,shadowpain,2011-09-07T21:53Z,"I've tried 2 different chinese language packs now. They both seems to stop working at: Unit 1 > Lesson 1 > Writing, part 6. I just get a blank screen, it won't allow me to progress any further from there.
Anyone had the same problem as I do? And do you know how to fix this, or get through this part without doing that lesson"
,oldgreg13,2011-10-12T19:46Z,"Works perfectly! Thanks a ton.  

For everyone else: You have to first download torrents for the Rosetta Stone program and an update for it.  Also, you can find a patch to bypass the CD key on TPB"
,jrmann91,2011-12-19T11:56Z,"i need chinese levels 4-5, i see that theyre available on the rosetta stone site but i havent been able to find them in a torrent at all"
,huracan13,2012-01-29T05:12Z,"I GOT THE TORRENT;
THANKS A LOT!"
,coolguy69,2012-02-11T14:48Z,Thanks for the audio companions i fucking need that cause i m go to china and they in china dont no english properly -.- !!
,bullsfan3,2012-03-26T10:59Z,"Great Upload! Works Perfectly! 

If You Have Rosetta Stone Version 3 (3.4.5) Installed Already, You Just Mount The Lesson You Want Using An ISO Program ( I Use  PowerIso) And Then Install. 

Once Again. Great Upload"
,Mattnoob,2012-03-30T12:29Z,"someone please help! 

I downloaded daemon tools and went to mount the file or wateva it is and then it opened up another window with 4 files , data, languages,documents and speech. and in those files are .rsd files ?? so im very lost anyone please help. iv looked up youtube vids and i still cant do it .... thanks "
,DarkSwirl,2012-03-30T16:56Z,"@Mattnoob

1) Make sure you have the Rosetta Stone program downloaded and installed; here's a good torrent http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5210152/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.5___Crack(VasiaZozulia)

2) Download this torrent

3) Mount which Mandarin .iso you'd like.

4) Start your Rosetta Stone program from the cracked file

5) Select ""Add language""(make sure the .iso is mounted)

6) It will say something about having the dvd/cd-rom in. Just hit next. It should recognize the .iso you have mounted and should then install the language pack. Just repeat for any other language packs.

Hope this helps bud."
,codyz17,2012-04-15T03:21Z,"I downloaded this torrent and i have it all connected with my rosetta stone. I can not seem to figure out how to get past the serial number screen. Can someone please help. 
Thanks

,sauerkraut21,2012-04-18T08:33Z,"Yeah, I need to still figure out how to get an activation ID. I keep seeing a reference to a key generator, but so far I haven't seen one. 

Any ideas? Otherwise, no sense having this thing."
,Darkobra,2012-04-20T06:10Z,anyone have levels 4 and 5 for Chinese?
