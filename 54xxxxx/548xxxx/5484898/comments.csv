After so long did you up a movie of my choice (I was a bit too agitated by several of your previous latest uploads). Are you gonna up ""The Road"" (2009) anytime soon? Or should I get it from elsewhere??"

Several good uploaders have ""The Road"" . "

,tordajav,2010-04-09T02:08Z,"FXG, can I ask you something about DAR (Display Aspect Ratio): why is it on some DVDRips so BIG? I mean, when played on full-screen mode, the picture has very large BLACK space above and below the movie...
What makes your decision to Display Aspect Ratio be so large?"
,tordajav,2010-04-10T03:22Z,"Its a stupid question, your DVDRips are at the same DAR as the original DVD.
THANKS FOR YOUR WORK"
,salencec,2010-04-24T23:04Z,"Actually, it's not a stupid question: the DAR of ""Crazy Heart"" DVD is 2.35 (40:17) - and, at any rate, these never exceed 2.40 - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29. (Please correct me if I'm wrong - and substantiate your claim.)
FXG's DARs are sometimes reasonably bigger, I'm guessing, because watermarks are cropped."

,slats649,2010-04-26T14:55Z,"Hello,
Where do you leave request for a movie on this website? You seem proactive you may know. I NEED ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" for a couple of kids and I cannot find it. I've looked on other websites and none of the movies I download there play. I'm trying to burn the movie to a DVD so they can play it on thier DVD player. I seem to have the best results off TPB. 
Thank you."

,chriseggroll,2010-05-21T00:54Z,Why are there so many movie torrents in weird screen resolutions like this instead of 16:9 or 4:3?!
,LMaruko,2010-06-03T01:41Z,"Be forewarned if you are ON Verizon IPs you will be contacted by the Copyrighted Owner of this movie.
