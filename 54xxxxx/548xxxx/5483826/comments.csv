,vick.gamb,2010-04-06T22:23Z,screens are included in the torrent itself
,dougaldog2002,2010-04-08T20:06Z,"Rajiv, you only ever seem to comment when you think you've got something to complain about. It's simple to figure out where the screens are and how to d/l only those.

Even if there weren't screens available your whining is falling on deaf ears and will remain that way until you actually start upping some of your own torrents.

Thanks for the up, Vick!

,tre.work,2010-04-09T22:36Z,"DD2002, I'm with you on the analysis of the complainer, but something everyone ignores is that torrents need to be seeded, so even though I've not uploaded anything, I think people who seed like I do are as important (almost) as uppers. Few people using TPB seed and posters like FFF's usefulness last about a week until the people who dled the original seed stop seeding and the torrent is useless. Upping, in other words, is not the defining factor of a person's contribution to TPB."
