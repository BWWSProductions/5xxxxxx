[T],brodahisou,2010-07-06T18:16Z,To open this file I would recommend CDisplay.  There are other comic book viewers out there but this is the one I use.  Its freeware and easy and straight forward.  Simply Google CDisplay and download and install the file.  You'll then be able to open any .cbr/.cbz file and read the contents.
