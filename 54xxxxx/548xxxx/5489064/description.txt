From Hell is a comic book series by writer Alan Moore and artist Eddie Campbell speculating upon the identity and motives of Jack the Ripper. The title is taken from the first words of the "From Hell" letter, which some authorities believe was an authentic message sent from the killer in 1888. The work is dense, multilayered and immensely detailed.

The comic series was a top vote getter for the Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Award for Favorite Limited Series for 1997, and the collected edition won their Award for Favorite Reprint Graphic Album in 2000.
It also won the "prix de la critique" at the AngoulÃªme International Comics Festival (France) in 2001.
From Hell has won several Eisner Awards, including Best Serialized Story (1993), Best Writer (1995, 1996, 1997), and Best Graphic Album -- Reprint (2000).

In 2001 From Hell was adapted by the Hughes brothers into a film starring Johnny Depp, Heather Graham and Ian Holm. However, the film and the novel have very little in common apart from character names and a few basic plot elements.
