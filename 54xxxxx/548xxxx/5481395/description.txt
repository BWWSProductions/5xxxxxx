
It's Uptown remains a germinal jazz guitar album. 
Benson's guitar playing is drenched in bebop, but also strongly influenced by R&B and soul music, as is his quartet's sound overall. And the three vocal cuts -- "Summertime," "A Foggy Day," "Stormy Weather" -- foretell Benson's well-deserved success as an R&B and pop singer. 
Lonnie Smith's organ and Ronnie Cuber's baritone sax provide the group with an unmistakable signature sound, perhaps dated at first blush, but timeless in actuality. (AMG)
