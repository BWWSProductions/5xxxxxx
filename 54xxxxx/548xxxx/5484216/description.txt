"Sweaty Palms and Weak Knees"

Annie (Shenae Grimes) deals with the outcome of Jasper's 
(Zach Sherman) decision to jump from the Hollywood sign 
and begins to find some peace with her situation. Silver 
(Jessica Stroup) and Teddy (Trevor Donovan) decide to 
double date with Liam (Matt Lanter) and Naomi (AnnaLynne 
McCord), which makes Dixon (Tristan Wilds) and Ivy 
(Gillian Zinser) feel left out, so the two decide to 
fake date. Adrianna (Jessica Lowndes) and her band 
perform for the first time at the Beach Club and, with 
her newfound confidence, Adrianna decides to make her 
relationship with Gia (Rumer Willis) official in a very 
public way. Liam encourages Naomi to come forward with 
her sexual harassment case, which causes her to 
continue her lie.

Enjoy :)
