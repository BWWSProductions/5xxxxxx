Daily Show quark
Video 8+
Audio 9+

TRICK and I do NOT know if this works with anything other than a PS3.

Load .mp4 and play as usual but [Pause] immediately.
Open OSD and choose [Slow Forward].

This syncs the audio and stops the 'chipmunk' effect.
Worked fine for me with The Daily Show quark, haven't tested with others.

22MB file - 2040 you are a legend!!!!!
