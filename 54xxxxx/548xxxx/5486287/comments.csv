,ninethepirate,2010-04-08T19:28Z,"Hey you can call under 200 kbps ""full hq high bitrate"" all you want, but unless you're listening to this on an ipod, it won't sound that great. Thanks for the release anyway, it's a good preview for now."
[T],djsforfun,2010-04-08T20:25Z,"its ripped in vbr, so it shows the real quality of the sound. a rock cd would have a higher bitrate than a folk cd for example and this ways it goes..."
