,frekken60,2010-04-08T21:06Z,Thanks: This works perfect
,Sven the swede,2010-04-09T14:10Z,Real! This is no program but simply a stream of the channels. I would not put hopes too high as this stream could probably go down at any time because it must take quite a bit of bandwidth to host something like this and it is also illegal. 
,jeshansson,2010-04-11T21:20Z,Thanks works 100%
,Dilldog,2010-04-13T21:31Z,"Doesn't work for me. I used mediaplayer and vlc, nether one of them worked. This was what the vlc player said: 

""VLC is unable to open the MRL 'mms://media.tv.consoll.no/tv2sport'. Check the log for details."" (No details in the log)

I don't doubt it could work, but it didn't worked for me. I tried some of the chanels with no result.

Could someone tell me if i'm doing something worng or is it just because the streamer host is down?

Great upload! (if it would just work.. ''/) :D"
