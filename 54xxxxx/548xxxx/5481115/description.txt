Mary Tyler Moore had a bit part on THRILLER in a 
first season episode.

She finally became a star a year later from 
The Dick Van Dyke Show, which is probably why 
in this episode she's one of the main characters.

The "Man of Mystery" is played by John Van Dreelen.  

The other noteable guest stars are William Windom and Walter Burke.
