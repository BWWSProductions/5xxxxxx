War is crazy and most of the characters are, too, in "Cow," an often brilliantly imagined black comedy-cum-magical-realist yarn about a dumb Shandong peasant Niu Er who has the unlucky task of protecting the village's only Dutch dairy cow, which supplies milk for the wounded Chinese Soldiers during WWII. Loyal Niu Er is commited to protecting the cow at all cost despite the village being invaded by Japanese troops. Motored by a tour-de-force perf from bozo-faced thespian Huang Bo ("Crazy Stone," "Crazy Racer", this powerful allegory about the stubborn resourcefulness of the Chinese common man amid mass inhumanity.
