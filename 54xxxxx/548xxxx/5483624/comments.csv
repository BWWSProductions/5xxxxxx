Would wager that Sweden is not far behind. Europe's most dangerous country for women politicians've successfully make our long country and why stop there.

Ive been to Sweden lots of times, my Brother lives there in Göteborg, i dont recall men  systematically raping women just because they can."

Considering that the force that is ""driving"" this problem is minerals for cell phones, according to this film, Sweden as a large contributor to the number of phones out there is a culprit, though. So there's enough guilt and glory to go around in that un-populous country, albeit for both men and women."
