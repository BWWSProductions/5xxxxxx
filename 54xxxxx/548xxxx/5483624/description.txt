Twenty-three-year-old Judith Wanga grew up in London but was born thousands of miles away in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Sent away by her parents to live in Britain as a small child, sheâ€™s now returning to Congo â€“ two decades later â€“ to meet them for the first time. She wants to understand the childhood she missed and the country she was forced to leave. After reuniting with her parents in the capital, Kinshasa, Jude heads east to an area of the country thatâ€™s been devastated by war. It is the most dangerous place in the world to be a woman, where rape has become a weapon of war. Jude meets survivors â€“ women and children â€“ as well as perpetrators, and finds out whatâ€™s driving this brutality â€“ the precious minerals that make our mobile phones and laptops work.
