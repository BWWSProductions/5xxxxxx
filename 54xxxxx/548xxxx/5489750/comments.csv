,christer.26,2010-04-23T15:13Z,Thank you for a great upload of That's What I Call Music v43! I don't trust Audiochecker 100% but I can confirm that this is the real uncompressed flac and no converting from other formats... Sounds impressive on my hi-fi system. Keep up the good work. These albums are really popular and if you managed to continiue download it in flac format it would be great! Maybe these albums will come up in a supertorrent release? Keep up your good work!
