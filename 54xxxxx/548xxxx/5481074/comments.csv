,hawkan2580,2010-04-06T01:59Z,"Thank You for this.. I'm a mastering engineer with 20+ years in the business and I have to say, to my ears, this is The Version that sounds the best of the ones I've heard... which includes, MFSL ud1 release, Capitol Harvest, Sacd, 92 - remastered (be aware, remastered doesn't mean better.. it just means someone else have done the job again.. It will sound different, but not necessarily better... these days, majority of Re-master jobs we get is just to make them so loud on the record that they in fact sound worse with little dynamic left.. but hey, they pay the bill, they get what they want..)

But if you are a Fan, this IS the version to listen to..."
,hawkan2580,2010-04-06T02:28Z,"Just some facts to show exactly what is going on with the db peak levels between the different versions, track by track... what to compare is the loudest parts (peak) vs the softest peak in a soft sounding track...  in this, the soft intro's peak is 39.9db and the loudest peak is 3rd track with 70.1db
This version:
39.9 / 43.3 / 70.1 / 55.2 / 72.3 / 44.5 / 53.9 / 54.6 / 61.2

-86 Capitol Version
In this they;ve raised the volume overal but also, they have reduced the dynamic so the softer bits are louder in comparison to the loudest (ie, less dynamic which means that the intended louder bits have less impact in comparison to the softer bits)
87.8 / 94.7 / 100 / 97.2 / 100 / 99.1 / 100 / 96.1 / 100

92 Remaster:
93.3/ 98.4 /100/99.2/100/100/98.8/100/100  
And again, this is even less dynamic.. almost flat (less than 7db between the quietest tracks peak vs the loudest tracks peak...)
