,Bujaaa,2010-04-09T21:50Z,Do i need a JTAG for this too or do i just burn it to DL DVD like any other XBOX360 game and install it to console hdd?
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-09T21:53Z,"Far as i know its just a  ""add on dvd"" so burn it  like you do with other games. But you must have Borderlands first dvd as well. I have not test it get because imk not home. But im going to burn it/test it when i do."

,chrillan68,2010-04-15T11:14Z,"Hi Sunblock.

I may be stupid, but I have tried to burn as a image, file with ImgBur but nothing happens. Wonder if you would be so kind to explain more precise how to burn, use it..

Thanks for the good job.."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-15T13:11Z,"@chrillan68

I dont know if you have burned xbox 360 game before?. But just burn the game as it was a any other game. I use imgburn (http://www.imgburn.com/) and i have never failed with this program. This just a addon but when you put in the xbox 360 you should get a install request.

I just click on the .dvd file and the imgburn comes up and i press burn and nothing els."
,chrillan68,2010-04-15T13:26Z,"Hi Sunblock!

I have burned plenty of games. 

It´s the  updateSPY 2.0.9199.0+Avatar I´m having problems with. I burned the $SystemUpdate_9199 Folder in several ways and all I get is a ""mixed disc"" when I put in my 360. 

I have to use a Activate ISO on Wave4 games. Should that make any difference?

I have also followed your ""miniguide"" but.. No luck..

Thanks for the quick respons mate, I would be forever in depth to you if I somehow got this update to work

Kind Regards. Chris"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-15T13:41Z,"Well im not sure. I only did as i sade in the ""mini guide"". Its should say ""mixed disc"". Its when you have the disk still in the box and turn it off and on again. It should check by it self if there is a update on the disk/usb.

I have 3 xboxes and one of them is still a IX 1.6 and thats one of many i have updated same way. (4+ console with IX1.6)."
,chrillan68,2010-04-15T17:05Z,"Tack för hjälpen men min 360 vägrar läsa skivan. Jag ha bränt 3 dvd & 6 cd ;( 
Inget fungerar..

Nåväl, jag söker vidare, men tack ska du ha..."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-15T17:08Z,Have you checked what dashboard you have atm?
,chrillan68,2010-04-15T17:10Z,"Sorry... Thats Swedish.. Getting tired now..;)

Anyway, thanks for your help Sunblock But my 360 refuses to read the update. I have waisted several dvd`s an CD`s. Nada..

I`ll keep on searching...

Cheer`s"
,chrillan68,2010-04-15T17:52Z,"Checked the dashboard also..

What program are you using to burn update?"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-15T18:58Z,Its ok. I use nero. What is you verstion of dashboard atm?. U can also update via USB stick if you have.
,chrillan68,2010-04-15T21:48Z,"I have 2.0.8955.0 

I have tried usb both in back and in front off the 360 but nothing happens..."
,scandle616,2010-04-16T01:38Z,@chrillan68 the update on flash card \mem stick has to be formatted  in fat32 type then u should be good
