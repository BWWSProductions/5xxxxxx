,cdrw1955,2010-04-08T19:40Z,"Splitter8, Thank You very much for your uploads and motivation.  Keep it comming.  Why it is that people take the time to complains of what anybody upload or not.  Just don't download it and stay way.  That is what LIBERTY is all about.  Thanks again"
,unomyname,2010-04-08T22:55Z,"cdrw - there is a very simple answer to your why. 
These people do not care for freedoms. 
Actually more than that, they don't want people to have freedoms. 
What they want is a grey mass of people thinking the same way. 
Their ""anti-discriminatory"" policies only being non-discriminatory towards someone THEY pick, not towards those who do not want to embrace them.
Very simple."
