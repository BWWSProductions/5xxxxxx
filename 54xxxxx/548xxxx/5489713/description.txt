Ringo Starr, ex-Beatle drummer with a most personal voice. Here's an compilation from 2007. Ringo once sang "With a little help from my friends" and he has many friends who has contributed to his solo career, not least his former Beatle friends.
Hard as it is to believe but there has not been a proper Ringo Starr hits collection since the first, 1975's Blast from Your Past â€” that's not counting 1989's Starr Struck: Best of Ringo Starr, Vol. 2, which was designed as a companion to that earlier set â€” until 2007's Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr.
