Osho Fluctuation Meditations contain the best quality Osho audio discrourses
accompanied with a background music by Osho musicians and the best of
ethnic music.

Usually, when you just listen to the discourse by itself,
your mind tends to wonder away on all sorts of mind trips
and you are not even aware when it does it. All you recognize is when
it came back to the source and can be aware of the discourse.

With Fluctuation meditation, the background music is specifically
selected to be beautiful and conductive to you remaining with it.
The chance of you staying with discourses is much higher.
Your mind becomes occupied with the beauty of music if it wonders
away from the discourse, and so it becomes much easier to become
aware of how your mind wonders away from the present moment.

You can create these meditations by yourself by playing the discourse
using one media player, such as VLC player (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
or some other player and playing a song list with beautiful music.
Osho musicians produced an outstanding collection of meditative music.
So, this would be a very good choice. But you can also play the ethnic
music that you like. It works fine. But do not play any aggressive
or complicated music such as rock or jazz. That won't work.

The music level should be set much quieter than the discourse
and it should be overshadowed when voice gets loud. The only purpose
of music is to provide you an additional hook to this very moment,
so when mind wonders away on its trips, the first choice it is going
to have is that beautiful music.
