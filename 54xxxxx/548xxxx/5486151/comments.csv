@ashraf555: My answer surely can't be of any help: my own. I encoded first clip in 1997. and writing software and compiling is my hobby since 1983. However, out there are more than few one-click programs and few more advanced. I recommend HandBrake and MeGUI as solution.

@Kaovar: Hi my friend. It's really small. Check one movie I posted and maybe one of the talk shoes from daily packs. That would give you more ""insight"" in  internals and limits of such tiny tawny encoding."
,ashraf555,2010-04-08T15:46Z,Could u send me  the settings in HandBrake to get a really good compression and good quality (like this file) !!!
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-08T16:02Z,"@ashraf555: Probably I would say something wrong, namely, last time I have look into Handbrake was two years back (roughly) and it was just briefly, to help a friend...
I would point you to click on my screen-name then on ""Skjul"" torrent. There, in torrent description you can find ALL settings and extrapolate these in HandBrake or MeGUI."
,poet123,2010-04-09T07:03Z,wow!!!! This is revolutionary dude! The picture quality for that size is just too good. If possible you should upload everything in this format. Great Work!!
,kennykillerkoala,2010-04-09T09:46Z,"Nice work 2040, just as clear as a SP 175mb d/l watching with Dziobas player HDMI out onto a 32"" TV.
The 1st episodes of SP used to be around 40 MB in AVI any chance of getting back to that standard would be HDD & media player space friendly.

Thanks."
