,acfreema,2010-05-17T09:36Z,"You really shouldn't use such absolutes as ""best"" and ""ever"".
One White Zombie song?  One Iced Earth song?  Two Van Halen songs?  No Yngwie Malmsteen, Helmet, Bruce Dickinson, Six Feet Under, or Steve Vai?
No Testament or Type O Negative?!  Go educate yourself about some of the best stuff ever to be recorded in the ""metal"" genre.  This torrent is shameful."
