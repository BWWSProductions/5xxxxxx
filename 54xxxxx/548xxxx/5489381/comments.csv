First - setting the game to run on a single core doesn't solve speed-ups. You need to also enable V-Sync for the game to run fine.

Second - you're wrong. even if you set the game to run on a single core and enable V-Sync, audio and video still don't match. If they match on your configuration, you are lucky. On most they still don't.


If it was easy, I wouldnt create a patch for it. 

One thing I forgot to mention is - launch the game through Start -> Programs. I forgot to replace Desktop shortcut, I think."
