This patch (based on someone's script that I found in some forum long ago) will fix the issues with audio-video de-synchronization in the game. On modern machines either audio plays faster than video, or video goes faster than audio, which makes the game nearly unplayable.

Just install the patch and start the game using the shortcut, as usual.
If you want to start the game without using the shortcut for whatever reason, start it using "FullProcessing.exe" file. It should be somewhere in game folder.


Please keep in mind that nearly all (or all) my torrents are UNIQUE. Which means that if seeds will drop and torrent will die, people may never get this stuff again.
And in this particular case it means that people will not be able to normally replay this amazing game on modern machines.

So please, keep seeding.
