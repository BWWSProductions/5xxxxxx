Aan American Young Earth creationist and conspiracy theorist famous for his creation science seminars that aim to convince listeners to reject modern theories of evolution, geophysics, and cosmology  in favor of the Genesis creation myth as found in the Bible. Hovind's views are contradicted by scientific evidence and research. His ideas also have been criticized by Young Earth creationist organizations like Answers in Genesis.

Since November 2006 Hovind has been serving a ten-year prison sentence in the Federal Correctional Institution, Edgefield in Edgefield, South Carolina, after being convicted of 58 federal counts, including twelve tax offenses, one count of obstructing federal agents and forty-five counts of structuring cash transactions.

This just proves yet another theory that all evangelists are criminals and truly believe they are above the law because they do ""god's work"""

You argue like you have no sense at all. So, everyone in prison is guilty? Really? Could it be that he has done so much damage to evolution religion that the powers that be just want him out of the way? Think, man. Or do you need your brain to evolve some more for you to do so?"
