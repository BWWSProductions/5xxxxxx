From ALL MOVIE Guide:
The Austrian-born director Fritz Lang is perhaps best known as the maker of the 1926 science fiction masterpiece 

Metropolis. The silent-era film featured eerie and visionary cityscapes that seem modern even today. This documentary 

traces Lang's film career, from the 1910s to 1960, as well as his personal life. The story exemplifies the dark, 

disturbing, and often paranoid touch that characterized the master's films. Archival clips from his works are 

presented, along with interviews with those who knew Lang best.
