,hannibal0,2010-04-21T15:26Z,when tryin to boot from disc its says cannot boot from cd???
,hannibal0,2010-04-21T23:12Z,"DeGun=

I always do a clean install anyway.

pc is set to boot from DVD

burned the ISO using imgburn at the lowest speed.

find it strange as i keep getting error code 5?? then tried another win7 install DVD worked fine and tried this one again but still same problem :-/

just to confirm, in the WIN8EXTREME files i was to select, the BOOT file which is the MS-DOS file app in the BOOT folder 4KB's in size for the bootable image?
