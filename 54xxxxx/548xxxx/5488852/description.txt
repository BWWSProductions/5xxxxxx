PrisM Notes::::::::::::
well.....few people are going to think this is just another one being released and it's a pointless release...well, filtered the colors properly, and taking time on it. We got the skin color to look as natural as possible reducing the red and yellow quite alot, increased the brightness also as in some scenes it was quite dark...added a sharpness filter and slight video denoise. Originally was going to use imagines audio, then imagine released a r5, tried to mix their audio was in sync some time and out in some other so we just got their audio from their ts and synced, anyway Enjoy it spent some time on it :)
