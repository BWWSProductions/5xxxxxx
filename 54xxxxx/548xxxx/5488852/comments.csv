,FSmonster,2010-04-14T11:00Z,"I notice that Raymondhome never actually credits the makers of the movie..... all his little buddies get a right proper felching, but not the people who actually contributed.

I wonder if Buddha is comfortable with you thieving from others to proseletyse for him ?

Hey dont get me wrong, were all thieves here... just some of us are sanctimonius, delusional wankers like your man raymond here."

,jahem1980,2010-04-22T23:52Z,I am new to all this and would appreciate any and all advice on how to know what to look for to see if it is quality or not BEFORE I download. Also what is the best Bitorrent? Right now I'm using Miro and it has worked pretty good bue Sopranos all 6 seasons has taken 3 dats already and T.I. Discography as well. I liked all the comments about this gut and about sharing and seemed like a great forum to get advice so please help!!!!!!!
,hjsimp5,2010-04-27T00:08Z,"Good quality, but just be careful.  I got a letter from my ISP about sonys copyright infringements on this download.  I'm not sure if I forgot to put peer guardian on or not...."
