PLEASE NOTE: THIS TORRENT CONTAINS ONLY SUBTITLES

This is an additional upload to the following torrent: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4235467/Out_of_Africa_(1985)
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089755/

with the following subtitles in separate idx/sub files (Work in Windows Media Player etc., see enclosed Note): 
Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian.
Dutch
English for the hearing impaired
Hebrew
Hungarian
(Swedish was included with the original upload)

I made this rip in June 2008, when I had just found the secret of how to make decent-quality 700 Mb rips of films up to 2.5 hours' length. However, I had not yet found the secret of how to rip all available subtitles from a DVD edition, so I could only included one (the Swedish).

Since then, this original torrent has gathered a rising number of faithful seeders, so I now give you the rest of the subtitles from the same original DVD. I soon managed to combine both techniques in the same upload.

These subtitles may also fit other one-file rips of the same cut (total duration: 2h 34mn) with 25.000 frames per second.
