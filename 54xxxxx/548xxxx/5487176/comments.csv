,Imperator42,2010-04-10T05:02Z,Sorry; I thought it was set up just fine for seeding.
,Imperator42,2010-04-20T05:07Z,"FWIW, seems to be working fine by now."
,Saberhagen19243,2010-06-26T16:51Z,"Sorry to bother you, but Amazon lists this album as having 7 songs? Is that a fluke? Here is what Amazong says should be on the track:

1. Something Crazy	 	
2. Wish You Were Here		
3. No Floods	 	
4. Words	
5. Let Love Down	 	
6. Red And Blue	 	
7. Second Time Around

This torrent is apparently missing 'Let Love Down' and 'Second Time Around'. Your assistance in this matter would be appreciated =]"

,Imperator42,2010-11-30T06:00Z,"I don't think Amazon's right about that, but at any rate, the other two songs can be found amongst this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5949534"
