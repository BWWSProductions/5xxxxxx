CBC - Global Warming Doomsday Called Off

A very good unbiased documentary about the real cause of global warming. In 2004, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation produced this 45-minute-long film. It discusses many topics that are not covered in other documentaries, such as the hockey stick graph, from the viewpoint of Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas.
