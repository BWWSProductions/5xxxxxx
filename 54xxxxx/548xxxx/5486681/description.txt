I have tried syncronising subtitles downloaded from opensubtitles, for some reason they were all out of sync. 

The Spanish ones are almost perfect now and the English ones are getting there. Enjoy and seed!

I will initially seed about 200% of the movie and then it's up to the first few new seeders to let others enjoy it too.
