,deeko78,2010-04-11T03:08Z,"Got it working. Uninstalled, then reinstalled audio drivers. Fixed the problem somehow. Wasnt worth the wait though. Game sucks."
,arfett,2010-04-11T10:32Z,"I can confirm that uninstalling your sound card drivers, rebooting, reinstalling sound card drivers and rebooting again will fix the problem with the game crashing when you start it."
,degusto,2010-04-11T15:42Z,Damn! I'm having the startup sound but the game crashes and with no video whatsoevwer. Reinstaled my creative drivers but with no effect. First UT3 engine game that has any problems! gonna try some things and come back later...
,degusto,2010-04-11T18:01Z,"UPDATE! Confirm that a full audio drivers reinstall will help, although i don't have sound in game. Oh well, will work on it."
,moldaviax,2010-04-15T23:36Z,For those who crash after starting the game but hearing some music for the opening credits I found a solution that worked for me.  I changed my playback quality down to 16 bit 44khz and started the game and it worked perfectly fine.  I changed it to the lowest 24bit 44khz and it still works fine.  Apparently the problem is an audio device compatibility problem.
,n16h7m4r3,2010-05-21T14:27Z,"same for me...
16bit 44khz and it worked on windows 7 ulti 64bit with a audigy 4"
