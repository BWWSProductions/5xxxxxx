,renson143,2010-04-08T16:55Z,anyone tell is this fully working ........without animus bug
,mfczero,2010-04-08T17:00Z,"this game is completable. meaning you can play from beginning to end. server version is newest 0.4
the 2 dlc missions are still unplayable at the moment, as are a few side quests. as newer server emulators are released there will be updates for this rip. as well as any further DLC. 
the bugs you speak of have been fixed. no white screens anymore. 
any further questions, i will answer."
[V],Shroo,2010-04-08T17:50Z,"mfczero did replied on my behalf and everything he told is a true thing, so download with no worries."
,iwilleatu,2010-04-08T18:06Z,"low on memory :( how many gb's is this gonna extract? very curious, thanks shroo"

,svadilfari,2010-04-08T18:51Z,pls keep seeding to at least 1:1 bitches
,X1lyc,2010-04-08T19:48Z,It's TPTB that does good work

,nitr0fueled,2010-04-08T21:22Z,Over 200 Kb/s now :)
,Ezlin,2010-04-08T21:23Z,"It's great to finally have this game up and running. Too bad the game hasn't been cracked and has to run with a server emulator, either way thanks a lot for the rip and thanks to the people that made the server emulator."
,SonofUgly,2010-04-09T03:26Z,There's only 1 seeder and it seems he's only got 12.9%...
,Cyrez60659,2010-04-09T04:05Z,^^If he only has 12.9% then he is not a seeder.
,renson143,2010-04-09T05:05Z,"thank  u ..............mfczero 

so its completely ...working....................is it "
,renson143,2010-04-09T05:13Z,"now this game needs   crack, or server emulater and animus bug fix ................?

please tell me....................."
,mfczero,2010-04-09T05:24Z,"game is completable. that means you can play the game from start to finish, there is now animus bug anymore that was fixed a while ago. new updates for the server will continue to be released till dlc content is functional as well. with newer emulator versions will also mean newer addons from tptb for this.  "
,jomari148,2010-04-09T08:28Z,stuck at 12.9% 
,massp,2010-04-09T09:13Z,Patched to 1.01 version?
[T],nystrand,2010-04-09T09:35Z,please please seed!!!
,urza4315,2010-04-09T09:52Z,"It's Tptb, their games work. And if they don't work, they'll fix it. THANKS SO MUCH!!!"
,jomari148,2010-04-09T10:02Z,"i doubt no one has ever finished it yet, i check the peers and they are all stuck at 12.9%"
,svadilfari,2010-04-09T11:24Z,"well i´ve already got 12% lol...than again im not really hot for the game, just downloading it for the compact size...i like that :)"
,hitec1691,2010-04-09T11:57Z,plzz tell me how much disk space is required to decompress it if anyone has completed downloading !!
,jomari148,2010-04-09T12:03Z,is it just me or all of us are stuck in 12.9%
,mfczero,2010-04-09T12:18Z,"if people must know, yes this is patched to current, game data and launcher data. 
and to explain why people are stuck is because of the amount of leechers here and our own site. with so many peers and only 1 seeder it makes it very difficult to seed effectively. so we are seeding at the moment to only a few friends with very good upload speed. 
in a few hours it will open back up and you will be able to finish your download at much faster speed. without doing it like this it would take almost 4 times as long just to get 1 more seeder. 
hope you understand, we believe in quality, speed and support.

also forgot to mention earlier, included in the #soft# folder for this game is a trainer. i can verify that it does work, what makes it special is that it has a setting to lower in game textures, this works very well for people using laptops or are on systems that would not be able to get very good fps on lowest settings. i myself am on a laptop, i went from 21fps on lowest settings to 62fps."
,alltorrentfan,2010-04-09T13:21Z,"I like all the torrents from TPTB!!! they work all the time...it takes a while to complete but its cool i can wait...ill seed till i can...after complete downloading. =] 

Thx again"
,mfczero,2010-04-09T15:13Z,"please read comments, i already commented about your question. animus bug is fixed, there is no actual ""crack or fix or whatever you want to call it"" it is all server emulation. the game is updated to current, and as far as any bugs or anything, i have come across none, that does not mean there might be any, i am saying i myself have not come across any. as long as you install to C:\Games (thats where you extract the contents of the .rar files you downloaded to) there will be a 1 click shortcut on the desktop that launches the server and the game at the same time. nothing fancy. the game can be installed to other locations but you will then need to make a new shortcut of the server.exe and the games main .exe
and as far as any server emulator updates go all you should need to do is copy the new files over into the DRM folder. "
,svadilfari,2010-04-09T17:49Z,"nice weather today, its supposed to worsen all next week, sad"
,lime195,2010-04-09T18:04Z,im the one that's have 12.9 % and i seed...
,kumarh3,2010-04-09T18:36Z,"what the hell, stuck at 12.9%?? any updates"
,iwilleatu,2010-04-09T18:38Z,"did you stop seeding? why? yeah i'm stuck too 12.9% i've uled almost 7gb's so i removed and deleted the torrent, i'll try again another time, thanks"
,hitec1691,2010-04-09T19:24Z,i will wait till seeding begins !!!
,nkm10gt,2010-04-09T19:34Z,"Shroo!

Why you aren't seeding it man? Its stuck at 12.9
Other people also have this problem. Do something man.! My torrent is still activated but it is still on 12.9
Common we need seeds!!!"
,mfczero,2010-04-09T19:37Z,"there is several people using there seedbox to seed here, i can verify that they are seeding at well over 2mb. there is at the moment 608 leechers, how many do you think have there uploads capped to 1kb. "
,syed_azeem,2010-04-09T20:15Z,seeeeeeeeed guy's..!!!
,hitec1691,2010-04-09T20:24Z,i can see people stuck at 13.7% and one guy at 15.9% we have waited so long for this game we can wait for few more dayz 
,hitec1691,2010-04-09T20:24Z,i meant few more hours ;)
,nitr0fueled,2010-04-09T21:35Z,"Around 100 Kb/s now! Please keep on seeding, I will seed this games for days once ive downloaded it."
,overallb,2010-04-09T23:58Z,why would you have to download this? a working crack has been out for like a week
,mfczero,2010-04-10T06:08Z,"people that get any errors it is due to the DRM folder located in the game directory, just move it to a separate location, like you desktop or wherever, make a shortcut of server.exe located in the drm folder, and make a shortcut of AssassinsCreedIIGame.exe on your desktop, start the server first, then the game exe. once loaded you will be given a logon screen, make any username and password you want, check ""remember me"" and play. i will make a proper fix, and upload it here, and have shroo leave a link in the description."

Does this Ac2, also uses the 'server emulator' thing?"
,hitec1691,2010-04-10T20:19Z,@kenji86 ya it also uses emulator i haven't downloaded this yet 
,nitr0fueled,2010-04-10T20:22Z,"100 % working on my windows 7 computer.
I did this:

When you unrar the files, chosse ""unrar to"" and type in C:/Games. Once they are unrared you go to C:/Games and locate the setup.bat file. Run it. I had some problems here, the installation wouldnt start. I just canceld the music and the installation began. After this, you do exactly as mfczero said:

""people that get any errors it is due to the DRM folder located in the game directory, just move it to a separate location, like you desktop or wherever, make a shortcut of server.exe located in the drm folder, and make a shortcut of AssassinsCreedIIGame.exe on your desktop, start the server first, then the game exe. once loaded you will be given a logon screen, make any username and password you want, check ""remember me"" and play. i will make a proper fix, and upload it here, and have shroo leave a link in the description.

,hitec1691,2010-04-10T21:34Z,@kenji86  well i think emulators are workin well i dowloaded multi 9 clone dvd earlier but then there was no crack for long time so i uninstalled the game and deleted iso but now game is working so i m downloading this again ;)

,Ezlin,2010-04-11T05:08Z,"@coolroy
The speed is slow because it is new and the seeders are busy giving out the file to a bunch of other people, it will become faster with time. As for installing it, I have no clue."
,Vipe0713,2010-04-11T06:40Z,for those who got the game working... is ipconfig /flushdns a must? or can i just wait for 24hrs?
,hitec1691,2010-04-11T07:31Z,i will start downloading it tonight and will complete the download tonight only.but i will install this game on tuesday coz i hav exams i m pretty sure u guyz will find a solution to make it work.
,mfczero,2010-04-11T08:24Z,"ok so here is what i can come up with. but first off let me say this, if people want to spam over and over and over again, please do it elsewhere. this may be a public site where most people just hit n run, but there is still others that would like to be able to look through the comments and be able to find something useful instead of 30 pages of nothing.  now with that said, i have been working with many people over the past 24 hours with trying to find out why some can play the game with no issues at all, and some do have issues. here is what i have come up with so far

1. UAC is not disabled
2. any anti anything is not disabled when installed.
3. people let msn, aim, skype, utorrent, mirc, anything that uses a net connection to be online when the game is installing, and when launching the game for the first time. best to just unplug your internet cord or turn off your wifi untill you have been able to load the game for the first time
4. host file was not edited by installer because host file is set to read only. so you may need to set it so you can edit it and add the entries yourself.
5. people try to start the game and it updates to .118 which adds new server lists to the game making the server emulator worthless and always says net not found.
6. people tried a crack from another site.
7. people did not run the setup.bat as administrator
8. people are on vista x64....just get rid of it, its a worthless os, your better off with a jack sparrow win7 x64

now with all that said people should get a bit of a better understanding of whats going on
MFCzero - TPTB"
,iRockSBs,2010-04-11T09:17Z,negative. i dont have programs like skype and crap like that. unplugged my internet. and disabled AVG. still get the same unable to find launcher error.
,Vipe0713,2010-04-11T10:21Z,"Works great, awesome job guys and thanks

#5 was my problem"
,PaulAl,2010-04-11T12:13Z,"for people with program errors, and such. If properly installed, you should have about 4.79 GB diskspace in use (around 755+ files and 106 folders)"
,Cyrez60659,2010-04-11T14:05Z,Thanks TPTB! Everything works! +++++++!
,cmoe,2010-04-11T14:14Z,"I first had Problem 0x0002 and 0x0003, which i somehow got rid of - maybe it was because first time i ran setup not as admin (although i am admin user without UAC).

But now I also have the

""unable to find the Ubisoft Game Launcher, please re-install Assassin's Creed II. Ubisoft Game Launcher: Error Code 1""

-Error. This one is the same as when you do NOT start the server.exe before starting Assassinscreediigame.exe, same error. The Ubisoft Launcher is in a couple of folders, like \DRM\orbit\patches_launcher\0117\, or \ubisoft\ubisoft game launcher\ ...

,cmoe,2010-04-11T14:21Z,"btw. people with the launcher error in steam forums just deleted their ubisoft game launcher folder, went to the redist in steam and re-installed the ubisoft game launcher (or just verify integrity of game cache, which should do the same).

Maybe theres a wrong path to the launcher in some file that is due to having the launcher installed to maybe program files(x32) or something like that?"
,cmoe,2010-04-11T14:37Z,"Just tried deleting the ubisoft\ubisoft game launcher folder - same error.

,mfczero,2010-04-12T13:59Z,"people please read comments instead of just jumping in and going off saying that it doesnt work. if you actually look through the folders in the rip you will see that the ubisoft game launcher is in the ""ubisoft"" folder. all registry entries are installed during the game install and are edited to use the games install path. we recommend that you install to ""C:\games""
so for a quick refressher with people having issues.
1. disable UAC
2. disable any sort of anti anything. (antivirus, anti malware....)
3. check your host file ""c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\host"" and make sure that the needed addresses are there, this file can be opened with notepad. if they are not there then right click on the host file, click properties, and uncheck ""read only"" add the entries manually save the file, close it and set it back as read only.
4. open command prompt and type in (without the """") ipconfig /flushdns
5. before even starting the game for the first time disconnect from the internet then start the game (do it manually with server.exe and assassinscreedII.exe)
6. upon first run make sure nothing that requires a net connection is running...skype, utorrent, msn, aim, internet browser, mirc.....
7. if issues still occur the run server.exe as administrator and open command prompt and type in ""ipconfig /flushdns""
8. DO NOT let the game update, it is already updated to 117. the emulator does not support the new update and WILL give you a message saying unable to connect to ubisoft master server. the new update also adds more addresses for the game to connect to making the ones added to your host file worthless. 

to save games offline or at least not get an annoying message saying unable to synchronize with server for save game then check the little sprocket on the top right of the launcher to have the save games store on your local hdd. 

now as a reminder to people, assassins creed 1 rip had issues as well due to the ubisoft launcher. over the past 48 hours i have been working with people to help them play this over protected game and every person i have helped is no able to play this game. all issues were related to the user them self, not the rip. "
,cmoe,2010-04-12T14:21Z,"@mfczero: did you notice that the people with real problems here are not on your already-figured-out-list? some posts ago someone seems to have tested what i thought was the problem - that you had to install the ubisoft game launcher MANUALLY AFTER installing the RIP. i dunno why we had to do this, since your rip includes registry and launcher itself (i checked plenty of times in the registry myself) - so maybe YOU guys could try and find out why some people have to install the regular launcher additionally, since this all is pretty awkward...
going to register at the forums now so i can download the launcher as well...
regarding the registry entry provided by twonline, it seems that this entry is already covered by the RIP, and additionally is ONLY for installing it to ...program files\ubisoft\...

If it works, thanks ahead - might be an idea to upload the launcher as a torrent as well so people dont have to register to get it to work :P"
,cmoe,2010-04-12T14:30Z,"CONFIRMED:

to all with ubisoft game launcher not found -error : install the ubisoft game launcher from the forum link some posts above. I installed it and BANG here we go registering an account at ubi and the server up and running fine.

Thanks to especially pothead808 for finding out my assumption was correct ;)"
,cmoe,2010-04-12T14:57Z,"Additional Info: Now i understand where the problem REALLY originated. Its because it seems windows x64 does not store those keys in the right place. so this rip actually HAS the launcher and HAS additional registry entries for it, but windows doesnt acknowledge them. Thus, you have to install the ubisoft game launcher for it to create the rightful registry entries, BUT then you have to use the ""ubisoft/ubisoft game launcher"" - content from the RIP-folder and overwrite the stuff the original launcher at ""program files(x86)\ubisoft\ubisoft game launcher"" - thus, you dont have to create an account since it uses mfczeros. I am ingame now and happy ^^"
,mfczero,2010-04-12T17:16Z,"@cmoe you are correct about the ubisoft launcher. we had suspicions about this with x64 machines. mostly with vista x64. very few cases with win7 x64. and we did look over any differences between registry entries on both x86 and x64 and there was no actual difference. the only thing that is different is due to the c:\program files(x86) which changes specific values under appdata causing the game to not locate game launcher because it was not installed originally to find an (x86) in the data location. 
the fix i have been working on i will include the original ubisoftgamelauncherinstaller.exe found on original game disk. as well as the new 0.44 emulator and most current values.db

sorry about the wait on a fix, but we want to make sure that the fix is actually effective and not a load of crap. i believe in quality, not junk. please be assured that this rip was tested on multiple fresh installed machines running win7 x86 pro before uploaded. so with the fix we have many people helping us test to make sure it works on win xp, vista and win7 x86 & x64. once uploaded we will put a link to it in this torrent description. so anyone who is having issues and all previous tips did not work please be patient the fix should be up later today if all results come back positive.
thank you for your patience.

People with product key problem, listen up:
download this crack:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5490537/Assassins_Creed_2_The_Final_Offline_Server_Crack_100
This is what i did:

(1) If you want to use offline server 0.44:

Edit your  ""hosts"" file in ""C:windowssystem32driversetc"" by opening it with notepad and adding the folowing lines, then save:

127.0.0.1       static3.cdn.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       ubisoft-orbit.s3.amazonaws.com
127.0.0.1       onlineconfigservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       orbitservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       ubisoft-orbit-savegames.s3.amazonaws.com

Then run ""ipconfig /flushdns""


Finally, run server.exe and start your game.

(Enter an id and password (what you wanted). Do not register)
Keep the same ID and password for next time, in order to resume play where you left off.

!VERY IMPORTANT: a) Make sure you overwrite the Ubisoft Game Launcher in the ""C:Program FilesUbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher"" folder with the one in the torrent if you have the latest Ubisoft Game Launcher version! The crack doesn't work with the latest version of Ubisoft Game Launcher !!!!!!!!!
		b)  Make sure you have all internet processes close, like Skype, Dropbox,uTorrent etc!!!!"

Re-installing the game may fix this problem. 

Steps for people who know how to use regedit; if you dont - sell your PC buy a chipped XBOX :p

Export the branch 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ubisoft
edit the saved ???.reg file and replace all instances of 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ubisoft
with 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Ubisoft
Save file and re-import it into regedit.

3. if they are not there add them, save the file then open up dos command
you can do so by bringing up the run command or by clicking start > accessories > command prompt
then type in   ipconfig /flushdns  and press enter and exit command prompt.

this step (step 3) is only needed if the addresses in step 2 had to be added manually.

,jocsta,2010-04-25T12:50Z,"Ok, Win764bit instructions again - 
No-it wasnt written badly, it just expected a small degree of windows know how.

Anyhow - here's the Bangalore helpdesk step by step instruction version....

click start
type regedit
click the regedit.exe option that appears at the top under programs(1)
if you get an options box appear with a yes/no option - click yes.
The registry editor should now open.....
In the folder structure on the left:- 
look for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and double click it to expand it
under that look for SOFTWARE and double click it to expand it
under that look for Ubisoft , right click it and choose export.
In the save dialog, click desktop on the left, and type something in the filename box.
Close all windows
Find the file you just saved to your desktop, right click on it and choose edit.
This should open the text file in notepad.

Carefully go through the file, and everywhere you find 
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ubisoft
change it to say 
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Ubisoft
In mine, there were 6 places to change - I expect this will be the same.
Save the modified file and close notepad.
Double click the file on your desktop and say yes to everything that follows.

If you get this right - you should now be able to run the game."

Thanks Shroo... you rock... hell tpb rocks, tptb ROCK.

*If you have any ac2 registry data, or ubisoft folders in Program Files DELETE THEM*


Step 1: Extract to the path C:\Games (Experienced users may extract elsewhere but you will have to make new shortcuts out of server.exe and game.exe)


Step 2:Run the only batch there (best to run without UAC enabled), follow instructions and click yes to every windows popup.

*64 bit only* Type in regedit in the start menu. Run it and find the path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ubisoft.
Right click the Ubisoft folder and click export.
Save it anywhere you can find it.
Find the newly saved file and right click and edit. It should look like this

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ubisoft]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ubisoft\Assassin's Creed II]

After every SOFTWARE put \Wow6432Node.

Now save it to the desktop. Double click it to add it to the registry.

Step 3:Cut of everything using the internet and cut off your connection.

Step 4: Double clickthe AC2 shortcut made by the batch file on your desktop.

Step 5: The launcher should popup and log you in. Log out and enter a new account(do not click register!) and click remember me. Before it plays click the gear icon and disable internet saving.

read just up...

""1...: Unrar with latest 7Zip or equivalent to C:games
If located anywhere else the 1 click desktop launcher will not work and you will need to make your
own shortcuts for assassincreedII.exe and server.exe (server.exe is located in DRM folder)""

If you dont have a Game folder in C:, then create it and extract everything in there.

Works for me! =D

Thanks for the up! =D"

,iwashere1,2011-01-17T16:24Z,"IT WORKS!

disable/uninstall your anti-virus

extract files to C:/games

run setup (after this, DO NOT run the game first)

go to DRM folder then click server.exe then

run the game"
