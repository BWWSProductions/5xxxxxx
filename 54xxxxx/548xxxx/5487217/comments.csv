[V],twentyforty,2010-04-09T09:38Z,"@BoonesFerry: So, I have right, all these past few weeks - my encodings of episodes were differently and PROPERly numbered.
I warned people about the grudge between POW and 2HD (and few other groups).
It was pure insanity all around and I am happy for them. Coming back is the nice thing."
