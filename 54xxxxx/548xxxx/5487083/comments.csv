,charlton2142,2010-04-09T14:35Z,..there is no episode 15 yet...
,ickiosk,2010-04-09T14:56Z,"what has happend to no 14, or has this been numbered wrong"
,CyberGRIM,2010-04-09T15:07Z,Episode number has been corrected. THanks! :)
,diskmeedel,2010-04-09T16:09Z,"Yes, this is ep 15. The double episode was named 11 and 12 but was in fact 12 and 13. Ep 11 was a recap of the first 10 episodes."
,xaliate,2010-04-09T16:59Z,thanks you
,SEoF,2010-04-09T19:40Z,"@charlton2142: wrong.
@diskmedeedal: wrong.

Numbering was right with the double (episodes 11 and 12) however, subsequent episodes were numbered incorrectly as episodes 12 and 13.  These two episodes were in-fact episodes 13 and 14 (respectively).  This episode is actual episode 15 (or at least, is said to be actual episode 15, but I am yet to check).

A few comments about this have been made on the episode 13 and 14 downloads (incorrectly labelled 12 and 13 respectively) and is mentioned by ""BoonesFerry"" but not in so many words."
