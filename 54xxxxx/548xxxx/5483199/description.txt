Jr. Gone Wild - Less Art More Pop! [1986]

Jr. Gone Wild were a country/punk band from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, founded in 1984.The band's original members were Mike McDonald, David Lawson, Graham Brown and Kim Upright. In 1986 the band recorded the album "Less Art More Pop" on the B.Y.O label. The band broke up in 1995.

This LP is an absolute blinder and I'll never understand why the band never got more recognition. A single track like 'Cosmos' is worth every recording that tax-dodging, pompous blow-hards like U2 ever recorded.
