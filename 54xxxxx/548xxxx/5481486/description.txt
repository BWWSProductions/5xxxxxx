One of the most individual of all altoists (and one of the few in the 1950s who did not sound like a cousin of Charlie Parker), the cool-toned Lee Konitz has always had a strong musical curiosity that has led him to consistently take chances and stretch himself, usually quite successfully. Early on he studied clarinet, switched to alto.
He has recorded on soprano and tenor but has mostly stuck to his distinctive alto

His recordings have ranged from cool bop to thoughtful free improvisations,
