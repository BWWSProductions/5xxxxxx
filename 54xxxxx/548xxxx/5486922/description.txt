Iâ€™m really happy to be one of the first to bring you this big news! The new mini EP from Chiddy bang is out! Itâ€™s called Air Swell and you can download it here. It sounds amazing, you can just hear these guys know what theyâ€™re doing, I hope that they carry on making great music like this, iâ€™ll be following them. I also want to compliment them on offering it for free, bravo.
