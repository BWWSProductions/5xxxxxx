Plot:
Paul meets Marcy at a coffee shop after work, and gets her phone number. He calls her, she asks him to come over, and things take a turn for the bizarre. Paul spends the rest of the night trying to get home, dealing with angry cabbies, dead women (and their bartender husbands), clumsy catburglars, quirky sculptresses, unstable waitresses, condescending bouncers, and irate mobs led by ice cream truck drivers along the way.
