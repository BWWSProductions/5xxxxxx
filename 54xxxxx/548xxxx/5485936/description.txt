Wonderland (Michael Winterbottom, 1999)

Description: 
Michael Winterbottom's WONDERLAND is a grittily realistic drama that follows the members of one South London family over the course of a four day period. The parents, Eileen (Kika Markham) and Bill (Jack Shepherd), are defeated, weary rivals whose relationship has all but disintegrated. Their children are not much better off: Debbie (Shirley Henderson) is a foul-mouthed hairdresser with an eleven-year-old son, Jack (Peter Marfleet); Molly (Molly Parker) is about to have a baby with Eddie (John Simm), who has just become unemployed; and Nadia (Gina McKee) is a lonely waitress who has stooped to meeting prospective mates through the personals. As the weekend unfolds, the sisters walk through the sad streets of London, waiting for happiness to return to their lives. Winterbottom's choice to film WONDERLAND on location in the pubs and streets of London in super-16mm, with a hand-held camera and natural lighting, gives the film a realism that is at once tragic and honest. Added to this is the entire cast, who embody their characters so completely that one might forget they're even acting. Michael Nyman's despondently blissful score appears under the sped up and slowed down images of a dreary London, boldly expressing the characters' inner melancholy, making WONDERLAND a film that retains a glimmer of hope even at its bleakest moments.
