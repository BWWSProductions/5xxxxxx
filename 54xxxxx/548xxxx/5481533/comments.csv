,Szili0,2010-04-05T12:32Z,"I'm downloading, will post if it works or not."
,mibrons,2010-04-05T13:25Z,"Any ripped content from the 6gig version?
Any ugly compressed videos? Missing audio, video or anything?"
,cousland,2010-04-05T13:44Z,I'm afraid I require a full list of what's ripped in this release and exactly how to get it to work...
,h3ll4b0y,2010-04-05T21:01Z,soo... does this work?
,neeru,2010-04-05T21:03Z,"srsly...ass aside,does it work?"
,cousland,2010-04-05T22:25Z,come on guys...so many have downloaded this already....does it work? and how do we get it to work?
,Szili0,2010-04-05T23:02Z,"IT'S... ALIVE!! MUHAHAHA

(yeah, srsly this works. :) You have to close Skype and MSN though)"
,cousland,2010-04-05T23:16Z,"close skype and msn? what do you mean? they mustn't run in background when I'm playing the game?
how did you get it to work?are there instructions in the torrent?

sorry for being so paranoid lol but I've been waiting for this for a lot of time and I wanna make sure :)"
,Szili0,2010-04-06T00:55Z,"When you start the game through the launcher it asks you to close msn and skype.

By the way in Sequence 2 when you have to go to Leonardo's to repair your hidden blade, you cannot continue the story. You equip it, and nothing happens. It's similar like the previous verions of the AC2 ""crack"" with the white Anymus screen. :"
,av2006,2010-04-06T08:21Z,plz reply if it is working
,ThomasDollar,2010-04-06T11:03Z,"amazing! this really WORKS! i'm in chapter 3 now... if you ever have problems with missing NPCs , just restart the game (only happened to me once so far, but that was my own fault)

so, yeah it works just fine... the setup is in russian but you know what you have to click (in the login window just click the left field and it will start)"
,cousland,2010-04-06T11:12Z,"well I guess this is it then...it works...gonna download now...

thomas,did you just install it and play it?nothing more we need to do in order to get it to work?and what do you mean about missing npc and restarting?suppose someone is missing from chapter 6,do we have to restart the whole game or just the chapter?"
,Szili0,2010-04-06T11:29Z,"Ok, now it's working. You have to press Q, select the hidden blade, then press 1 or 2 :)"
,ThomasDollar,2010-04-06T11:44Z,"yeah just install and play, nothing else to do... (game is available in english and italian) 

well i didnt activate a trigger because i was running too far away so i lost the ""connection"" (sync), thats why the NPC wasnt there... i just quit to Windows and then continued the story mode and it worked, no need to restart the entire game again :)"
,rocco_sifredi,2010-04-06T14:08Z,"Could someone be SPECIFIC to explain me , please, how is this installing ? What exactly contain the kit? What is that blabing about upadting that ""db"" file etc etc etc ? But in...English please ! Thx in advance"
,ThomasDollar,2010-04-06T14:38Z,"rocco, theres nothing to it... its an ordinary repack, you just click the setup.exe and install (the setup is russian, but we all know what we have to click)

after the setup, you click the ac2.exe and a window appears where you click the left button (obv its login) and then the game starts (the game itself is in english)"
,rocco_sifredi,2010-04-06T17:09Z,"Thomas Dollar

Thx man.One more question.Is this the ""final""...""db"" stuff? Can one play the whle game without ...ugly...and unwanted surprises or...?"
,Franklin van Teeseling,2010-04-06T17:31Z,"please why don't you ask eachothers msn ? Then you can call eachother names all day ! WTF ?

and download the latest value db i completed the story so i can guarantee its working."
,Sorrow12324,2010-04-06T22:17Z,and remove * from link
,rocco_sifredi,2010-04-07T00:28Z,"I can confirm.The game works.I played until late this night.(I killed pazzo's son in his city and returned to monterregio).No crashes , no bugs til now.Everything works well. 
When the game launches , it launches those server addresses (a DOS windows which stays open when you play the game) and I guess it fools the ""game"" that it is online.
I hope it will work for the whole game
Does anyone know...how about those...bonus levels included? Does they work , too? If so, how do you...enter them ?"

,shawn46,2011-04-27T18:23Z,"thanks for the upload.........it worked for me(on which i was counting)pretty good........i had a lot trouble getting to start the game (which was basically because of my antivirus MCafee) but went through the comments for help and it did help.......downloaded the AC2 crack and followed the instructions and the game started.......also i had to remove MCafee coz it blocked the file play.exe as a torjan and also wouldn't let start the game.......removed it and everything else is perfect.....
i have only started playing so don't know if those mid-game problems arises...lets hope not....
And i m seeding this torrent coz this is a wonderful upload....again thnx"
