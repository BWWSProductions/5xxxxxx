With William Shatner, Elizabeth Allen, Russell Johnson, 
and Donna Douglas as the young woman in the mirror.

Joanna Heyes was a small-time actress in 1950s and 1960s 
television. She was somehow related to this episode's 
director Douglas Heyes, who also worked with her in the 
earlier THRILLER episode "The Purple Room". 
Joanna plays Shatner's wife in this first season story.

That same season Douglas Heyes also directed 
The Twilight Zone episode "Eye of the Beholder", in which
Joanna played one of the pig-faced nurses, while as with 
this THRILLER episode, beautiful Donna Douglas again
didn't get to speak a single word!!
