Jimmy Page & Robert Plant ~ Walking into Clarksdale (1998)



Eighteen years after the death of John Bonham broke up Led Zeppelin, Robert Plant, the man who launched a thousand David Coverdales, and guitar wizard Jimmy Page have reunited for WALKING INTO CLARKSDALE, their first studio album together since 1979's IN THROUGH THE OUTDOOR.

Beginning with "Shining In The Light," Page's familiar acoustic guitar takes us back to Led Zeppelin circa PRESENCE. Page's trademark axe work and loud-soft-loud dynamics are all over this CD. 

But even though all the old Zeppelin elements are there, the duo aren't just reliving old glories. Bassist Charlie Jones and drummer Michael Lee as well as alternative rock uber-producer Steve Albini help keep these old gents current. 

And where Plant may not be able to wail like a castrated muezzin anymore, his singular voice still sounds as fresh as ever on the rockin' "Sons Of Freedom," the bluesy "Walking Into Clarksdale" and atmospheric "Heart In Your Hand."



Released by Atlantic Records on 21 April 1998. The follow-up album to No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded, Walking into Clarksdale  took 35 days to record. The album was recorded and mixed by Steve Albini. The single "Most High" was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1999.

Clarksdale is a town in the Mississippi Delta, historical home of Delta blues music.

Plant re-recorded the song "Please Read the Letter" with Alison Krauss for their 2007 collaboration album Raising Sand.
