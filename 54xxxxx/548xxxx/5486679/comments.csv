[V],twentyforty,2010-04-08T21:26Z,"@sanyam: I have seen your first plea, on other thread. I have loaded torrent immediately and have them active since then. There is only one peer all the time, somebody from ""schedom-europe"" with Azureus, a snail with malfunctioning program or on slowest, oldest dial-up.
So, it seems you have been either choked or banned. First, restart your PC and power off and on your router/modem. If that doesn't help, you have my e-mail and drop me your current IP address and I would find out and let you through."

@ All - My setup is: PS3 HDMI 32"" LCD
Daily Show quark
Video 8+
Audio 9+

TRICK and I do NOT know if this works with anything other than a PS3.

Load .mp4 and play as usual but [Pause] immediately.
Open OSD and choose [Slow Forward].

This syncs the audio and stops the 'chipmunk' effect.
Worked fine for me with The Daily Show quark, haven't tested with others.

22MB file - 2040 you are a legend!!!!!
