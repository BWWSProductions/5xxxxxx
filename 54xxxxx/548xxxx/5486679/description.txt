EXPERIMENTAL, just to demonstrate now small file-size could be.
DO NOT download if you watch on high resolution TV or monitors.
NOT for handhelds or phones, just computers. 
Playable in VLC, WMP and MPC with CoreCodec and DivX 7 AAC DShow filter, 
mplayer, KMplayer and of course, in QuckTime Player.
However, picture is better than 90% of CAMs and definitely watchable.

Quarks are point particles (no size) unlike protons and neutrons. 
Protons and neutrons are made of quarks. Quarks come in different types. There are six different types: up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom. For example, a proton is comprised of two up quarks and one down quark. Quarks have electric charge, color charge, spin and mass. But they have no internal structure, they behave like mathematical points.

Electrons are members of the lepton family. Like the quarks, leptons are also point particles.
