,edigee,2010-04-06T07:04Z,"@Leitzge
only the IMMERSE releases aparently have some encoding problems that cause difficult playback with some players in DXVA mode. Other releases(DIMMENSION, PROPER) are working fine."

,fallout11,2010-04-06T23:26Z,"I had a similar problem with the x264 release of Episode one. Go into VLC, preferences, input codecs, FFmpeg, and check the ""hurry up"" box, okay and exit. See if that helps. It did for me."
