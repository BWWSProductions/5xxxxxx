Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli - Djangology (Rome - 1949)


Born in Belgium in 1910 in a gypsy family, Django Reinhardt is said to be one of the most unique and influential guitar players of all times. In 1934, after his exuberant techniques became notorious in Belgium and France, he and legendary violonist Stephane Grappelly formed the Quintet of the Hot Club of France. The group stayed together until 1939. Django then moved to London and toured the US in the 1940s with the Duke Ellington Orchestra, playing electric guitar. This turned out to be a highly influential tour, and it is usually said that no other European artist has had such an enormous impact in the New World.

The material in this LP was recorded in 1949 in Rome, just four years before his death. The recordings remained unpublished till they were rediscovered in the late 50s by a RCA Victor executive. Reuniting Django and Grappelly, the selections are a characteristically varied assortment. The standards are well-chosen: Charles Trenet's "Beyond the Sea"; Fats Waller's exuberant "Honeysuckle Rose", and the perennials "After you've Gone", "Lover Man", and "I Saw Stars". Several of the originals were written by Django and Grappely. 

"Minor Swing" was devised a few minutes before a 1937 recording session, later becoming a staple at the French Hot Club. "Bricktop" was also written in 1937; "Heavy Artillery", composed in 1944, was one of Dajngo's favorite tunes; "Djangology", composed in 1935, was his first composition. Compelling versions of Trenet's "Menilmontant" and "OÃ¹ es-tu, mon Amour" ("Where are you, my Love?) are bonus track in this set, a striking and provocative survey of the playing of a mature, moving musician.
