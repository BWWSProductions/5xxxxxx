Bill Burr Why do I do this. 

Bill Is a up and coming stand up comic who is gaining popularity fast. The disc had previews to remove so the only thing done was to compress it to fit a dvd5.

The files are ready to burn.

(NTSC)

If you enjoy Bill Burr please leave a comic. I also have lots of other stand up stuff so if anybody has somebody they like I'll be more then happy to put it up if I have it. 

I always leave in the comments when I'm done seeding which is usually when I have a  3 to 4 ratio. I had computer work done and lost everything that is why the last Bill Burr post I put up didn't finish but this one will. 

If the post goes down and I haven't posted that I'm done seeding I've gone to work and the post will only be down 4 to 8 hours. 

Once again leave a comment if you enjoy the show or if there are any problems

Thank you
