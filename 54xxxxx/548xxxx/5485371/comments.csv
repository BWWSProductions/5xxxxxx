,WarrenZ,2010-04-08T00:56Z,10 reasons on why global warming is real? Oh how I as well envy your position Quazza. There is nothing I would like more then to tear a strip out of one of those progressive socialists that are trying to poison the minds of our children.
,unomyname,2010-04-08T07:01Z,"Quazza, 
may I please ask you a huge favor, basically one extra step when you upload this?
Can you please add mp3 tags to the 4th hour, so they are the same as the tags for the first 3 hours?
My mp3 player does not search by folder, so I end up having the 3 first hours in a dedicated folder for the artist and the day, while the 4th hour gets thrown in a residual folder with everything else, and it is really hard to spot it...

PLEASE!"
,TedKennedy,2010-04-08T15:50Z,mp3 tags would be nice but i am just happy you are uploading the fourth hour. i put the tags on the 4th hour myself.
