â€œThe least that we owe the people of Gaza is an accurate record of the suffering they endured. No one can bring back the dead or restore the shattered lives of those who survived, but we can still respect the memory of their sacrifice by preserving it intactâ€

- Norman G. Finkelstein, Pg. 14 â€“ â€˜This Time We Went Too Farâ€˜
