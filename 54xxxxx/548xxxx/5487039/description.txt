Neal is a good looking, smooth talking, killer deal closer,
who can sell anything to anyone at any time. For Neal, sales
is just a numbers game; you can't sell to everyone, but you
make enough calls in one day and you will make money. For
Catherine, sales is nothing but stress and hard work. As the
manager of a failing sales team Catherine's job is on the
line, and her boss has called in Neal to turn things around.
Will Neal's methods help Catherine's sales team, or will his
smooth talking get them both into trouble?
