,ExhamPriory,2010-04-09T16:15Z,"You know. I realize that I have yet to comment on ANY Naruto files I have ever Downloaded. So THANK you for the great UL's.  [Narutoverse] has been a great replacement since back when Team Dattebayo shut down. Of all the other sources available, I can say that the Video is superior, and [Narutoverse] has the closest translations since Dattebayo. (Although no disrespect, Dattebayo's translations were unmatched)
TY very much I am very happy to keep up with this series thanks to uploaders like you! :)"
