been waiting too."
,allrockedout,2010-04-10T06:20Z,can i ask what you do with this version?
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-10T06:48Z,"Thanks guys. I've decided not to wait for BluRay, movie is too frikkin long and screen-size/ratio is 16/9 - and cannot be 360p anyhow.

@allrockedout: Honestly, nothing, I mean nothing unusual..."
,jon4fun,2010-04-10T08:57Z,"Hi 20-40,
I figured you were doing the DV rip (if the title didn't give it away :-) ).
Not an issue on my end as I KNOW the quality will be excellent.

If I want to see the BluRay then I can splurge and and hire it but I sy this now:

@ALL: be picky but in the grand scheme of things you won't be be able to tell the difference.

Moer Quarks, my friend. YOU are now settig the latest trend in H264!

Stay Shiny
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-04-10T08:59Z,"Hi 20-40,
I know I've asked for this before but the copies avulable were rubbish at the time.
Any chance of 'The Book of Eli'? PLease?

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-04-10T11:12Z,"@20-40
Probably my imagination but did you upload 2 different (file sizes) versions of Avatar?

Is the .srt affected?

If so what is the difference?

If I'm imagining things, it's just too much drink, and my aploogies.

Cheers
Jon
P.S. Won't be checking back unti this evening."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-10T13:15Z,"@Jon: I did 'The Book of Eli' Telesync while ago. Torrent is probably dead by now. I would encode DVDrip when DVD or BluRay comes out.

Regarding Avatar: Yes, two versions - one [quark] 200MB and normal 530MB 272p version."
,lilars26,2010-04-10T18:01Z,"Watching on t.v. now 20-40.
Excellent copy.
No need for Blue Ray.
Out."
,Kencoldman,2010-04-10T18:07Z,Love your work. Thank You so much. I alwayÂ´s try to upload at least to 100%. If possible SGU started back up E10 and E11 if you were thinking of uploading this siries that would be awesome thankÂ´s.
,jon4fun,2010-04-11T03:19Z,"@20-40 re: Book of Eli
I do remember that telesync version and how bad it was.

My question should have been clearer.
When 'Book of Eli' comes out on DVD/BR will you be doing an encode/upload?

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-04-11T03:27Z,"Hi 20-40,
I apologise as you answered my question and I asked it again becuase I'm an idiot or tired or a tired idiot.

I don?t know why but I didn?t see past ?telesync? to where you said you WOULD be encoding/uploading [Book of Eli] when it comes out on DVD/BR.
I must have read the post about 5 times and just didn?t SEE it!

Sorry.
