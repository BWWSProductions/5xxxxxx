Luis BuÂçòuel, a contemporary of artists like Hemingway, Picaso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, wrote and directed this movie in 1961 (approximately), and has since been heralded as ""the 16th best film of the Mexican cinema and one of the best 1000 films by the New York Times"".
I have always wanted to see it.
Thanks parkyns for sharing it."
