_________________

...I changed the category from horror to mainstream.

Although, having listened to this book since posting it, I am now conflicted about the change of category; 
the writing could be described as horrific.
granted, it's written by someone with virtually no literary...
let's just say it is a very interesting story, written (and possibly read) horrifically.

makes you just want to run out and seed this torrent, eh?

let's let someone else attempt to express myself:
Quote:
""Like most autobiographies, it can get a little repetitive and self-serving. Wall is constantly speaking of her feelings, which are the same over and over again: fear, mainly, but also confusion, anxiety, and just a touch of anger. Wall is constantly speaking of her feelings, which are the same over and over again: fear, mainly, but also confusion, anxiety, and just a touch of anger. A person can only read about the fear and anxiety she faces when speaking to a church elder so many times before it becomes grating [insert sound: loading one in the chamber of a 1911]. --blogcritics.org

now yall âkeep sweetâ, and seed any 2 of my other torrents forever, or I'll go Ayla on your asses.

I might as well copy one sentence I wrote from that description (Clan of the Cave Bear) on Demonoid:
Quote:
[voice of RenĂŠe Raudman or Saundra Burr:] Like when you want to make a point, or explain a connection someone has made, and really make sure everyone gets what you're talking about, you'd repeat yourself, with slight variations, until you were sure that everyone knew exactly what you meant, then you could continue, sure in the knowledge that you'd have made yourself perfectly clear, expressing yourself as lucidly as you could, so that everyone could understand you, and relate the simple connection that something in the present reminded you of something in the past, going into detail of past and present events, so that even those with learning disabilities [or those loading weapons] could appreciate the otherwise obvious association."
