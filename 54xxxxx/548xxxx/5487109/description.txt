Seven explorers are home from Peru; among their trophies is the mummy of Rascar Capac, looted from an Inca tomb. One by one the explorers are struck by a mysterious illness, and beside each lie the fragments of a crystal ball. Tintin and Captain Haddock are soon involved. They learn of the ancient curse upon those who violate the Inca's tomb. Then one night the mummy vanishes; later, Professor Calculus is kidnapped. Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock take up the chase in the first part of a remarkable South American adventure.
