Why we get a RAR a video file is questionable.

Pic quality is original PAL.

And for mikexxxryan, you need to extract this RAR file with either WinRAR or MagicISO. Once you extract it, you'll have an ISO containing your AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS that you can burn into your DVD-R and play with your InterVideo WinDVD5 or other DVD players.

Still disappointed though, it say with English Subs but in reality it doesn't."
