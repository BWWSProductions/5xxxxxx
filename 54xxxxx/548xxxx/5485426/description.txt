Alex welcomes back to the show [hour 2, into early part of hour 3] economist and a nationally syndicated columnist Paul Craig Roberts, who recently announced his journalistic retirement in an article entitled "Truth Has Fallen and Taken Liberty With It." He served as an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan Administration. 

Dr. Roberts is the author of several books, including 
The Tyranny of Good Intentions: How Prosecutors and Bureaucrats Are Trampling the Constitution in the Name of Justice 
and 
How the Economy Was Lost: The War of the Worlds.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
