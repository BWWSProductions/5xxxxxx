Southpark + Facebook = AWESOME!"
,Markstern,2010-04-08T05:26Z,"I cant believe that the lame cunt trying to trick people by adding [eztv] before the oh-so-easily spotted ""Anonymous"" actually appears to have higher rate of traffic than the real deal. 

COME ON PEOPLE, IGNORE THE STUPID PREFIX AND LOOK FOR THE ACTUAL USERNAME BEHIND THE UPLOAD!!!

Not to mention that you stupid/ignorant/complacent excuses for lifeforms even have the freaking skulls to look for as well. 

Pathetic, well thanks a million times to the person behind this bot, at least you are one of the good guys. Keep it up! :)"
,cptlongshanksrrrrrrrrrrrr,2010-04-08T05:35Z,"Seriously, that guy was a dick. Spammers are annoying, but you should also be a smart pirate! Check the username (as MarkStern pointed out). Always trust eztv, aXXo (I don't know if he still posts), TvTeam, ESPALPSP, and xsaimex. Also, if you click on the number of files above, you can see the filetype and filename. If it's a TV show, only download .avi or .wmv. If it's a ZIP or RAR file, good luck removing the trojans. "
,cptlongshanksrrrrrrrrrrrr,2010-04-08T05:38Z,"@clevelandsteemer: There is another South Park file in the Top 100 where he put [eztv] in the filename, but it was actually fake and posted by ""Anonymous"". We're not accusing eztv, we're pissed we almost (or did) download a fake about an hour ago. LONG LIVE EZTV!"
,jordanidk,2010-04-08T06:37Z,"Thanks heaps.

Great episode, one of the best so far and the KFC episode was hard to beat."
,avatar2012,2010-04-08T06:42Z,Hmm KFC one made me hungry.  Stupid brain! ~ Ez
,fuckincrazyness,2010-04-08T07:27Z,ate pork chop for dinner and had nice applesauce too!
,bulldho,2010-04-08T08:52Z,tt hh xx

,KwizatsHaderach,2010-04-08T09:29Z,All hail eztv! Immense thanks!
,jahberry,2010-04-08T12:15Z,"on a bit of a tangent... is anyone suffering from poor dwnld speeds with windows 7? even tho I'm the Administrator, I have to open utorrent via 'Run as Administrator' to get speeds higher than 12kb/s.
w'Heird!! 
anyways, eztv rocks!"
,hart37,2010-04-08T12:48Z,"@ Jahberry have you installed the new version of uTorrent because apparently there have been speed problems with it. If it's not that then I am not sure.

Cheers as always eztv still the only place to get tv shows from"
,jahberry,2010-04-08T13:13Z,"@ hart37 - i'm using version 2.0(build 18620). cheers for the hedsup tho ;) are you refering to the 2.1 beta, or the 'utorrent10' thing? LOLs i just wanna know so's I can avoid it.

tbh i'm more perturbed by the fact i'm not getting full administrator rights.. :S I know people who have the same problem but with spybot and the like. think i might go back to xp!!"
,DaNtsu,2010-04-08T17:42Z,those fakes dont have real traffic.. Its just faked seeds/peers............. So dont preach when you dont really know what you are talking about.
,Triple_Beam,2010-04-08T17:57Z,Is there any way u could upload Adventure Time with Finn and Jake?  It's a new show on Cartoon Network
,pipopik,2010-04-08T19:15Z,"@jahberry , I dont know whats wrong there, but I run win7 on 2 pc's and a laptop here, and I can dl just fine on all systems, wireless and also on utp, I think quite certain it got nothing to do with win7. As to switching to Xp, well , thats a bit foolish imo. I do run all my win7's with UAC disabled so I dont have the administrator issues."
,KBear_MBD,2010-04-08T22:35Z,Thanks as always!
,Nuovo_Cinema_Pirata,2010-04-09T03:57Z,thanks very much buddy! thanks to you i can follow the last season always in time.. always HD.. always great fun (well the latter is more thanks to Randy Marsh and all of them).. you are better than Comedy Central!

chatroulette"
,DaNtsu,2010-04-09T16:10Z,to those wondering: this is NOT THE GINGER-EPISODE
,Dfewer,2010-04-10T11:18Z,"I've restarted this sentence about eight times because I'm finding words difficult, but this South Park is the best satire depicting the plainest truths I have encountered in a great while.  I have spent more time on the internet than I mortal man should, and for many and varied reasons I could never fully explain to my real life friends and family, I have refused utterly to make a Facebook account.  I have never felt so connected to a animated character as I was with Stan when his friends and family increasingly hounded him about facebook."
