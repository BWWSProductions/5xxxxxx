the edit the HOST file ubicated in C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc

put this lines on the bottom of the file...

127.0.0.1       static3.cdn.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       ubisoft-orbit.s3.amazonaws.com
127.0.0.1       onlineconfigservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       orbitservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       ubisoft-orbit-savegames.s3.amazonaws.com

go to Star - Run type ""ipconfig /flushdns"" 
whitout "" press enter.

the run server.exe inside this file let it open and then run game.exe.

Si funciona primero instalar este parche  [url]
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5418171/Assassins_Creed_2_Patch_v1.01_US[/url]

luego siguen esta ruta  C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc

,didah,2010-04-11T14:56Z,"i copied everything into the host file, ran the ipconfig thing, started the server but still cant play - i get the message u need to be connected to the internet... also in server.txt i get ""2010-04-11 14:44:36,312 - root - ERROR - Couldn't bind to port 80, do you already have a web server running at that port?"" well, i dont....."
,MartanElite,2010-04-11T20:01Z,"@didah You need to close Skype, MSN and other things that can disturb the server"
,didah,2010-04-12T10:31Z,"tnx martan, got a step further ;) now it asks me for a serial.... sry for being noobish, but i tried to follow instrucions as good as possible ;)

so i copy the content to my host file, run ipconfig / flushdns, close skype and stuff, start server.exe and run the game? thats it?"
,MartanElite,2010-04-12T15:11Z,@didah I think that you can use any Serial and any Account name. As long as you don't change the account name. Then your save will disappear. I used a crack and registred before. But you won't need a crack anymore.
