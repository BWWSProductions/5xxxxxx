This will fix the Animus bug and you won't need saved games any more and you can play ofline! You don't even need a crack.
I have just played a bit at the beginning. I don't know if it will work later in the game but it fixes the Animus bug. Basicly what this thing dose is that it acts like a Ubisoft server on your computer.

This got the 0.3.1 update of the server with the latest version of the values.db
Updates will be posted at the link below

I uploaded this before but I removed it becuase I found out that you don't need a crack and that I forgot to add the latest values.db
But here it is!
