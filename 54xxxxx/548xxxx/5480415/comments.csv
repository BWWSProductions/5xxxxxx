But unfortunatelly, I only have 80GBs of hardrive and limited space for my downloads, I'm really sorry. Can I have a request, can you upload a manual or instruction on how I can copy or save a games in my PSP Console? Or maybe post a link for that? Tnx a gazillion to your uploads and more power to TPB uploaders especially to you... "
