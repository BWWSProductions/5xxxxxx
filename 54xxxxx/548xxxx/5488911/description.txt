                     Psx Game Enhancer/Mod-Chip (Allows playing of backups) 
                     or Psx Emulator. (You only need one of these methods).

 
Compressed with 7Zip, Both Games were tested and work.



Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.



Important: No Ps1 Backup/Game or copy will work unless you have a modded Ps1/Ps2, 
           or if you use a bootdisc like Breaker Pro, you can also use a Game 
           Enhancer/Built-in Mod-Chip which does the same as Breaker Pro for the
           Ps1. (If using Breaker Pro or Game Enhancer for multi-disc games you'll 
           have to use the swap trick, A method of lifting the spring putting in 
           any original ps1 game releasing spring and waiting till the disc starts 
           spinning faster then quickly swap in your next game disc. This takes 
           timing and practice to get it right and only works for older   
           Playstation's).



You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console. If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description Galerians Ash (PS2):

Galerians Ash continues directly the story told in the first "Galerians". 500 years into the future, an ultra-intelligent mother computer named Dorothy was given the responsibility of managing humans' lives. However, the computer's mind told her the humans must be destroyed as weak, imperfect beings, and a race of super-humans, the Galerians, must be created. But Rion, the hero of the first game, destroyed Dorothy in a dramatic battle. Now Rion is brought back to life and learns that Dorothy was able to execute a destructive program before her death. Once again, Rion must face and defeat Dorothy's creations, the Galerians.

Galerians Ash is an action-adventure along the lines of Resident Evil and other survival horror titles. Rion can fight enemies using various psychic techniques. The more he uses a technique, and the more damage he sustains, the more "addicted" he becomes, and when the addiction meter reaches the limit, his hit points get gradually depleted, and he cannot walk normally anymore. Like in other survival horror games, you rely heavily on healing and restoring items. Enemies also drop items that would raise Rion's maximum hit points or make his weapons stronger, in a RPG-like fashion.


Features:

* Incredible graphics, heart-thumping gameplay and intense cinematic effects 
  immerse gamers in a frightening, action-packed world.

* An epic struggle between man and machine, with heavy concepts derived from a
  future world where mind and matter meld.

* Unique arsenal of psychic powers and psychokinetic weaponry, with new and 
  improved weapons, pharmaceutical items and abilities.

* Captivating cast of organic and artifically rendered good and evil, with new and 
  returning characters.

* The next exciting Galerians chapter, full of twists on an already "twisted" 
  story.


Game Description Galerians (PS1):

500 years in the future, a boy wakes up in a hospital with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. Gradually, with the use of psychic powers, you find clues to unlock your past. 

Primarily an adventure game, gameplay is very similar to the Resident Evil series, although the puzzles tend to be a bit more realistic. Galerians is also a fairly cinematic game, using many atmospheric cutscenes to unfold the story.
