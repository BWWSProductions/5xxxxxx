,toadflax,2010-04-09T07:00Z,Tried the first episode - it's a pity it's in mono and only medium bit rate. I'll stick with the cassette transcription I did some years ago.
[T],artpepper,2010-04-09T09:11Z,I listened to it on headphones and it sounded fine. It's a trade-off. A 320 kbps bit rate would mean a ten-fold increase in file size. Would you rather DL  a 168 MB file or a 1.68 GB file? Sorry you're disappointed but some people have bandwidth constraints.

quality is more important than size
