Duration: 13 hours 15 minutes



This radio dramatisation is remarkable. The music is excellent (though I'm not crazy about the songs, but that's just me), the story adaptation is great, and the casting is superb.


Peter Woodthorpe in particular is excellent as the snarling, stammering, schizoid Gollum.


Ian Holm who plays Bilbo in Peter Jackson's films is Frodo in this production and John Le Mesurier plays Bilbo.



I actually prefer this to the films. The wonder of the books, for me as a 10 year old boy, was the places it took my imagination to. This re-creates that effort, rather than having Peter Jackson do it for me. Just close your eyes and step through the door of your imagination into Middle Earth, my precioussssss.
