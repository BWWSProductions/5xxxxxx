Rhythmic multi effect for synths, guitars and drums Audio Unit/VST Plugin

Prepare to be entranced! CamelSpace can take any sound you throw at it â€“ be it a pad, a synth line or a drum loop â€“ and generate a dizzying array of dynamically-evolving, gated rhythmic textures.

An enormously powerful 128-step 'trance gate' sequencer controls panning, filter cut-off and volume, while independent LFOs provide still more mind-boggling modulation options.

Camel Audio CamelSpace is a multi effect with trance-gate, enhancer, filter, delay and reverb. Camel Phat is one of many vst plugins created by Camel Audio.
A tempo-synced stereo delay and powerful auto-panner ensure that your sounds are always on the move, while an enhancer (with 'Xcita' and soft saturation), a flanger and a high-quality reverb all add 'sparkle'.

A stunning graphical user interface puts all the controls at your fingertips, while the X/Y pad allows easy real-time manipulation of the most important parameters.

With the intelligent 'Randomize' button, new sounds and inspiration are just a click away. 128 attention-grabbing presets, organised by category, are also included. Find out more in the easy-to-read manual.
