,JASON29,2010-04-10T05:57Z,v/10? a/10?
,bychance,2010-04-10T06:07Z,If you can ignore the chinese subs you'll find an enjoyable movie. If you can read the subs you'll enjoy it more.

,FSmonster,2010-04-14T11:01Z,"I notice that Raymondhome never actually credits the makers of the movie..... all his little buddies get a right proper felching, but not the people who actually contributed.

I wonder if Buddha is comfortable with you thieving from others to proseletyse for him ?

Hey dont get me wrong, were all thieves here... just some of us are sanctimonius, delusional wankers like your man raymond here."
,uberglotten,2010-04-23T09:15Z,Can someone post a good copy of this in the DVDR section in English with no subs. You would be a legend. Thx Mates.
