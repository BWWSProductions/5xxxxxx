it's pointless..."
,Fflow,2010-04-08T12:35Z,"I dont know if its the truf but ive heard that you split it in many rar files, so its harder to track what you have downloadet, but i dont know if its the truf"
,qpr10,2010-04-08T12:35Z,"He doesnt split the file, its like it when he gets it."

,ikoni,2010-04-08T14:19Z,well this one is real anyway :D
,krapnek,2010-04-08T16:05Z,"One reason the files are split is because in the pre-broadband era bandwidth was very limited and you only had to replace one part of the release if that one was damaged, instead of download the whole thing again.

It also made it possible to download different parts over several days."
,Upquark2,2010-04-08T18:11Z,"True, but like you said, that was 'back in the days'. Why the release groups still stick with this stupid habit beats me..."

,bobs87423,2010-04-09T00:02Z,This contains an MKV file - might be easier to get the avi
,Upquark2,2010-04-09T00:37Z,"Why?

AVI is an obsolete container. MKV is the standard today."
