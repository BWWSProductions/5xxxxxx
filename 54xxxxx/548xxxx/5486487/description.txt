Wanting to be a responsible hunter and "use all which is provided" from my kill, I decided I had to learn how to tan the hides.  Searching the web high and low for info, I finally stumbled upon a page from a gal in O' Canada who detailed her process of tanning a hide.  She had used this book to learn from and documented her process following it's steps.  Having consumed all the info on her site, I decided I too wanted to read the book.  It was EXACTLY what I needed and instilled confidence in me to set forth on my journey to learn how to create buckskins.

I've since endeavored to not only tan all of the hides from MY kills, but while also teaching others the art of deer hunting, I make sure that they too respect the animal killed, and use all which their kills provide.  I've since taught four others how to shoot, field dress, feed the field dressings to local wildlife, skin the kill, break down the animal to "just meat" in the cooler, freeze the bones for my dogs, and finally... tan the hide.  Nothing goes to waste and ALL of the deer is used, they way it should be done!

This book is hands down the best resource I ever found on how to learn the tanning process, and while it can be a bit laborious and physically exhausting at times, it's VERY much worth it!  If you hunt, you need to learn to make buckskin, and this book will show you everything you need to know on how to do it!  Respect your kill, not just with a clean shot, but by using everything you can from your kill!

Sorry, no photos of the second wring out, stretching, drying, or somoking process...  but that's the basic routine.

YOU CAN DO THIS TOO!  :)
