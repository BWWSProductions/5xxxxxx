This is an upload of all "Current" Subs from Eclipse Speed Subs, and the OVAs Released in August 2009.
(As of April 4th, 2010 [01-51])
(OVAs: The Blind Alchemist
       Simple People      ) 

I take no credit for the files in this torrent I'm just trying to make it easier for those who want to watch FMA:Brotherhood before they air on [Adult Swim].
(Episode 46 has the Tsunami warning, I'm sorry for this but its really out of my control)

I'll seed this for a while, I hope others will to.
When Eclipse makes their next subs, I'll upload them too.
