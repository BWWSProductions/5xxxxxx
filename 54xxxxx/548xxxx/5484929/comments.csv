,bowhan333,2010-06-08T03:01Z,"how is this different from ""FMA"" without the brohood?"
,Kokumotsu,2010-06-14T02:13Z,out of 98 seeds im only geting 10... WHAT THE FUCK
,dark_link343,2010-07-25T05:33Z,"The difference between FMA and Brotherhood is that FMA is both an anime and a manga. FMA (anime) differed from the manga in many ways. For example, the manga is still being written. It's not finished yet. The FMA anime has an end to the whole series. They remade the anime to more closely go along with the manga with the original anime. Hope that helped!"
,alveolate,2010-07-26T12:17Z,"FMAB also features higher quality animation than FMA. FMAB follows the FMA(manga) storyline much more faithfully than FMA, which some would claim makes for a better series. however, imho both series have their merits."

Actually the manga has just reached an ending in june this year. There were 108 chapters."

,Isiod,2010-09-23T04:41Z,Everyone seems happy with this torrent but the picture quality is rubbish for me. It keeps freezing or the whole screen goes pixilated for a second or two. Any suggestions on how to fix this. I have used several different players.
,kappeite,2011-01-21T21:24Z,22 seeders and 50kt/s would appreciate if you would seed harder :)
