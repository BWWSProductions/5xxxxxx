,honunet,2010-07-09T05:13Z,then again sepheroth may work for paramount.  Can anyone confirm this please? Ray?
,albany6201,2010-07-11T03:47Z,Sephiroth878 is a troll...or a child molestor...take your pick.
,letyouandmeknow,2010-07-27T14:29Z,I can confirm the WARNING ! Don't load this one. I received a note from our sysadmin that he got a complaint from the film industry.  
,letyouandmeknow,2010-07-27T14:32Z,This is really tracked !!! Got a notice too. Be careful ! 
,moontheloon32,2010-08-13T01:06Z,sephiroth is right..my carrier sent a notice about a warning from Paramount..would not bother with this
,braaah,2010-08-20T22:49Z,"Audio has rhythmic ticks in it from beginning to the end, tested it on two computers. So that makes this torrent totally useless. Don't seed."
,deb66,2010-11-19T11:40Z,Cheers M8.
,EllipsisGH,2011-05-16T09:51Z,"Tried with WMP and VLC, both were giving me annoying ticks in the audio. Not worth seeding this thing."
,end0fdayz,2011-06-27T07:22Z,"I won't d/l this particular torrent due to users' warnings...

But there are other, safer means -- so BayTSP & Paramount can go FUCK THEMSELVES!

You can stop a few, but you can't stop us all, you greedy fuckers!! :D

Feel free to stick that bit o' knowledge directly up your arses."
,Notor1ous,2011-08-15T14:49Z,"Ok ok so this torrent is being watched, but how`s the A and V?"
