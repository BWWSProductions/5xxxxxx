,kitkat_ind,2010-04-06T12:27Z,"ok, thats a good explanation, thanks...

Where can I find Subtitles, tvsubtitles.net not having  english subs..."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-06T12:45Z,"@kitkat_ind: 
Nope, I have not. There is no need to explain a thing. To nobody. I can encode episode or movie week ahead for instance, US TV. As I did yesterday for instance.

Regarding subs; 
Since last week addicted.com is down due to database problems. There have subtitles within few hours after the release. On other subtitle sites - not so often subs are posted on evening or day after - or even a week (visit opensubtitles.org)."
