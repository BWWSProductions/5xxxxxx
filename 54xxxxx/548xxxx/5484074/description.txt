Robert Webb exposes the cinematic blunders and gaffes that the film studios hoped they had got away with. From sweaty cameramen getting caught in shot to wobbling scenery, and from props that look like they have been made by the Blue Peter team to childlike spelling mistakes, this show has Hollywood bang to rights.
