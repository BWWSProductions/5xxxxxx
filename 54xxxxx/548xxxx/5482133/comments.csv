,scottsasse,2011-11-22T08:15Z,"Praise Satan, I finally found the most Hippocratic torrent on the web. And it has all 666 CD's!! This is truly the work of the most evil cult ever to be inspired by the devil. The Bible warns to beware of FALSE profits and the so called anti-christian ministry that produced this series for they are wolves in sheep clothing!! These dumb assholes follow Satan in trying to take away your God given free agency. They are therefore going against Gods plan and as thus they are antichrist!! They want you to believe that Rock and Heavy Metal are evil when it is nothing more than artistic music. Even bands that use Satanic themes don't really worship the devil. It is all an act, plain and simple, it is show business. No different than a Friday The 13th movie, it is meant to scare those who don't understand it. But let me tell you what, it is these fearful little people that try to kill what they don't understand. For instance look at how many women have literally been burned at the stake by these superstitious religious fanatics. Countless women accused of witchcraft and such burned alive in the name of God in front of a bloodthirsty crowd. Bloodlusting wars, etc......................... All done by those claiming to be acting in the name of Jesus!! This sickens me!! For it is the 6 o'clock news that keeps me awake at night not listening to Iron Maiden or Slayer. I have been listening to bands like AC/DC since I was 5 years old and I have a close, personal relationship with God!! I pay a full tithe, go to church every Sunday, pray and read my scriptures daily. I am at peace with myself in spite of having had cancer and chronic pain since 1998. If I were to die tomorrow I feel certain God will look at the happiness and entertainment Heavy Metal has brought to my life thanks to the musical talents he has given to bands like Helloween. For God wants us to be happy and not to judge others based on what kind of music they like. I would not be serving others and serving God if my choice in music caused me to be possessed by Satan like this fraudulent ministry wants you to believe.     "
