It only searches in the titles and since you added the word ""PS2CD"" it wont find any hits if you search for this for an example ""rumble racing ps2"" but if you write in the title just ps2 it will let people find this torrent a bit easier. 

Hope you get it, I just wanted to help.

Great upload!"
,amivoytec,2010-04-08T21:03Z,"Thanks friend for good intentions. I think tags should works, but if even not, the phrase ""rumble racing"" is more popular than ""rumble racing ps2"". Anyway, I'll think about your suggest ;]. BTW - you have probably noticed that some of yours torrents have more peers (mainly from .pl) than other yours torrents. It's because I'm uploading your great stuff to other, big semi-private site. I guess you aren't angry, because torrents will be long-living ;]. Cheers."
[T],thenoobish,2010-04-09T10:30Z,"Yeah maybe this example of a game is easy to find because there isn't any movie or artist with the same name 

But with bloodrayne its different theres plenty of movies too! 

haha no im not angry, yeah its true, the torrents will live longer!"

I recommend ImgBurn for burning. I'll see about your requestes. ;]"

Yeah, PS2 reads CDs too."
,snorozoro,2011-08-11T22:19Z,ty man love this game
,mervynsow,2011-09-06T03:00Z,Put it in a virtual drive. ripped it as an iso. renamed it PBPX_952.01.Rumble Racing.iso Then copied it to a folder called CD. Put that folder on my USB drive. Loads and plays o.k. with open PS2 loader but you have to select mode 7.
