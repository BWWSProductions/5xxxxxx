TFT- Joint Breaking Series...AVI Format. Good Quality .
I will seed for 1 Month then its up to Y'all.

The TFT Video series instructional dvd's are for use when you have no other option but to defend yourself, use caution in performing some of the moves directed, If you can not run or talk your way out of an encounter, then defend yourself.
These moves are not for sport. YUP!

I will seed during the day SMT U.S.A.

BE PATIENT, IF YOU DO NOT GET THE FULL DOWNLOAD ON YOUR FIRST DAY, I WILL RE-START DOWNLOADING THE NEXT DAY, I TURN OFF MY COMPUTER AT NIGHT, AND PLEASE SEED,SEED,SEED WHEN YOU FINISH.
 
I will seed through April 2010. This is a hard torrent to find on the net. YUP!
