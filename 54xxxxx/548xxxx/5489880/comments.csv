,cndkp,2010-04-10T20:39Z,Fake ??
,TehDoktor,2010-04-10T20:41Z,Notice the skull next to his name
,Green_Banana,2010-04-10T20:43Z,"The new series was revived in 2005.  It's erroneous and possibly pointless for them to mention that in the torrent name, but it's just in case it could get confused with the old serials series.  This way you know it's the fifth season of the series since its 2005 revival.  

As for fake, whatever the torrent is, it's hidden in an archive file.  That should be enough to warn smart people away.  "

[T],keka_umans,2010-04-10T20:50Z,Yea definately not a fan of the rars i think it slows the torrent....but thanks tv i been waitin all week
[T],keka_umans,2010-04-10T20:50Z,any  one saying fake is a retard...
,Green_Banana,2010-04-10T20:59Z,"Wow, that's mature.  Seeing as how all anyone can see are a bunch of rar files and not whether there's actually a movie file in this torrent, there's no logical basis to believe this isn't just a virus.  That would make YOU the retard.  "
,plukey74,2010-04-10T21:06Z,"""no logical reason"" other than the hundreds of genuine torrents that TvTeam has uploaded."
,rrmerlin51D,2010-04-10T21:07Z,People!  All this retard talk is keeping me awake.  I'm a retard and never see you guys at the meetings.  
[T],keka_umans,2010-04-10T21:25Z,it is however going extremely slow...
,FMarshy,2010-04-10T21:37Z,Seed please.
,PI22,2010-04-10T23:10Z,"The slowness is gone now, mine was done in 7 minutes, unrarred in 7 seconds, so even the impatient ones can be happy."
[V],TvTeam,2010-04-10T23:19Z,"Guys, stop acting like a dumbass, it's a scene release. Enjoy !"
