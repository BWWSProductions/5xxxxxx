This suspenseful story from 1962 was the last 
episode of THRILLER that host Boris Karloff acted 
in, and he gave an effective performance as 
Doctor Konrad Markeson.  Or maybe I should say "Doktor" 
because that's how he incorrectly spells the word!

My only complaint is that it takes place in a dusty old 
mansion, as too many episodes did. But somehow that 
doesn't take away from a well-done script.

The guest stars are Dick York (before Bewitched) and 
Carolyn Kearney.

Coincidentally, Elizabeth Montgomery had done a 
THRILLER that same season with Tom Poston, the amusing 
vampire story "Masquerade".
