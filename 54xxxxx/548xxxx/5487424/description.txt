Sonny Rollins - Sonny Rollins Quartet (1951) Prestige 137 



Rollins leads a quartet that also includes the formidable support of Kenny Drew (piano), the MJQ's Percy Heath (bass) and main Jazz Messenger, Art Blakey (drums). "Scoops" is an original that highlights both Blakey's aggressive interjections as well as Rollins' highly infectious melodic sense. While on the subject of catchy tunes, all ears should be directed to the biblically-derived title "Shadrack," which had been a signature piece for Louis Armstrong. 

This early incarnation of the Sonny Rollins Quartet have rarely sounded as cohesive as they collectively percolate with their definitive execution. Of particular note is the inclusion of Miles Davis' "I Know" -- an extension of Charlie Parker's "Confirmation" -- which features Davis on piano accompanying Rollins with solid chord progressions that allow the burgeoning player to lead his first-ever quartet with Heath and Roy Haynes (drums).
