Plot:

How The Grinch Stole Christmas!
Bitter and hateful, the Grinch is irritated at the thought of the nearby village having a happy time celebrating Christmas. So disguised as Santa Claus, with his dog made to look like a reindeer, he raids the village to steal all the Christmas things. The village is sure to have a sad Christmas this year.

Horton Hears A Who!
In this story, Horton discovers there is a microscopic community of intelligent beings called the Who's living on a plant that only he can hear. Recognising the dangers they face, he resolves to keep them safe. However, the other animals around him think Horton has gone crazy thinking that there are such beings. They resolve to take action for his own good and Horton and The Who must struggle against these impossible odds to prevent a tragedy. Written by Kenneth Chisholm
