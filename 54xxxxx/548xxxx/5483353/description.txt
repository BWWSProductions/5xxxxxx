The original music compilations for the frenzied mood introduces listeners to new, non-standard, intrepritations of familiar music. You will hear how the violin will change, if you put it in the hands of Menton J. Matthews (Saltillo), how saxophone will sound with Jan Garbarek's tallent, what can Japanese culture do with classical music, what is melodic d'n'b, and much more. Music, which makes you cry and dance at the same time. A modern, strong but melodic. Music, what it should be. (c) VocalMixes.net
