When they arrive back at the trailer park, they find it's not the same old Sunnyvale and it's not the same old Jim Lahey, trailer park supervisor. Lahey's a new man, hasn't had a drink for two years. And he has plans for Sunnyvale. But unfortunately for Lahey, Julian stands in his way. With his big plans for Sunnyvale going down the toilet, his relationship with Randy broken down, and having the Boys back in the park is all way too much pressure for him to bear. For Jim Lahey, the countdown to liquor day begins.
