And if any of you like this movie, he's also made Dead Ringers (his best movie), Videodrome (his second best), Crash, A History of Violence, Eastern Promises, and The Dead Zone.

Check him out. Best horror/sci-fi director of all time."

,sinvis,2010-05-03T18:37Z,"hey members of PS3 team ......
i am curious as to why ur releases have white dots(pixels) on screen.....infact lot of highres encoders have them ....but secret-myth releases are pristine even though their releases are less than half ur size.....
u will have to see it for urself to appreciate their work....
i wish if u could do the same .......

please take this as a positive criticism....
i m not complaining.....i have downloaded atleast 20 of ur releases(i love ur work)....and yes i dont have ps3 ....
