Several known artists contributed to this release including Lost Buddha, Subra (Mike A), and Har-El Prussky, one of the original leaders of the Israeli Goa trance movement!

Golden Vibes 2 is the second homemade compilation from the Old is Gold (OiG) crew, a group of Goa trance fans keen on preserving the spirit and energy of classic Goa trance. The scope of this release is impressive, collecting nearly three hours of music spread across two virtual discs. The Wonderboy has compiled material in a variety of old school styles from a respectable list of promising new artists as well as established veterans. Filteria, Jikooha, The Muses Rapt, Ka-Sol, and SynSUN already have many commercial releases on the market, while Subra, Vox, Goasia, and AFGIN have been gaining ground with listeners online. This is a sure bet for any old school fans out there; Golden Vibes 2 promises to be one of the biggest free releases yet!

OiG take pride in their amateur approach; none of these tracks have been properly mastered, and they seem to prefer it that way. This is not likely to concern most old school listeners, many of whom value creative content far more than production value. Golden Vibes 2 is available in VBR MP3; there is no lossless version available. Subra (Michael Anenburg) has made his track available in lossless FLAC format on his website at least.

Old Is Gold returns with Golden Vibes 3, the latest in their series of â€œhomemadeâ€ new school Goa trance compilations from The Wonderboy. Designed to rekindle the true spirit of mid-nineties Goa trance, this release features a mix of veteran producers and newcomers including K.O.B. (Filteria), Subra (Felis), AFGIN, Jikooha, and Har-El Prussky, all of whom should be known to fans of the style. Since this release features no mastering or post-production, sound quality varies from track to track. Unlike previous releases in the Golden Vibes series, this one is available in WAV format in addition to the usual MP3 package. If you enjoy the cosmic melodies and authentic spirit of Goa trance this is not a compilation to miss!
