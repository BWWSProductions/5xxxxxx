I'm following along with your tutorials but there are options in your Particular that are not available in my Particular. these tabs are in light grey color and i cannot click them (eg:Emitter size x,y and z, preview {this tab is not even there}, options menu {when i click it only shows options for ""light emitter"" and ""shadow let"". 

what can i do? do i have the full copy? i though Pandemon was giving out the full copy?

HELP! I spend more time tweaking all the bugs with these installs and searching for answers on the net then i do editing!!"

,d_Raven,2011-04-26T02:19Z,"Thanks for the tutorials, unfortunately, the manufacturer has totally rebumped the ""Option"" interface that it currently contains only the ""Light Emitter"" and ""Shadowlet"" Naming convention and even when I tried re-installing my 1.5 version of the add-in, I still can't get the ""Option"" panel featured in the tutorials.

So much heartache... ;)

But Hey! Thank you, the tutorial is WORKING."
