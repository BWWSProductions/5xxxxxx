[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-07T17:13Z,Sorry everyone but I'm having a problem with the internet in my building. Someone screwed up the main router in my condo and I'm without internet till Friday. Possibly even till Saturday. I will be back up and seeding like a mad man asap.
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-08T00:40Z,Running on a wireless USB network adapter picking up a fat wireless signal:) Download away:)
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-09T17:57Z,Thank you for the comment AgentBay:) I'm glad you enjoy the torrent. I might have my internet back up and working properly today and if so I got a couple more torrents on their way up here.

[T],mikemelo1369,2010-05-05T04:51Z,Re seed is on the way:D
,The-Blob,2010-05-08T20:15Z,"Thank you mikemelo for the reseed. Movie is GREAT, good quality, sound is excellent! I knew this was the best torrent, and I'm glad I waited so long for it to download. Keep up the good work! =D"
,The-Blob,2010-05-19T06:20Z,"Oh by the way, could you upload the sequel to this one? If I'm not mistaken there is a Cheaper by the Dozen 2... Thanks. You rock :)"
