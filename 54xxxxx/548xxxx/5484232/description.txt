This material is VERY RARE!!!

MadCap is a punk band that was formed in Venice, FL, during the mid 90s.
They released two albums; Monopoly, and America's Greatest Zeros. Included in this bundle, is a demo that they recorded in 1998. The demo was scheduled to be released as an album, after the band's breakup, under the title PRESCRIPTION FOR LUNACY. It was never officially released, but a few copies were leaked.

In 1999, lead guitarist Bryce Bernius left the band to join THE UNDEAD (with former members of the original Misfits), and was replaced by Josh Starry. The band failed to produce anymore albums, since they no longer had Bernius (a key songwriter in the band).
They disbanded in 2000. 

No more albums were released by them, although sometime toward the end of their run, a California based band appeared, who began using the same name. The two bands do not appear to be related in any way, other than the fact that they are both punk bands from the US. 

The FL based MadCap would later do a short reunion tour, with the following lineup:

Shawn Murphy:  vocals
Bryce Bernius: lead guitar
Jordan Young:  drums
Pat Parnel:    bass
Josh Starry:   guitar
