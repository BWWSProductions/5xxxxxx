Premiered: November 29th, 2009

Joseph Mengele, the escaped Nazi war criminal and
SS physician, known as the Angel of Death,
spent years doing bizarre medical experiments on
twins at Auschwitz working to determine if
twins held the key to building a blond-haired,
blue-eyed master race for Adolf Hitler.
Now a historian says he has evidence that
Mengele's attempts may not have ended at Auschwitz,
and that his obsession to engineer an Aryan master race continued,
and that succeeded while he was on the run in South America.
Deep in the Brazilian outback in a tiny town among the
80 households in a one-square-mile area are
reportedly some 38 pairs of twins. Blond, blue-eyed twins.
Bizarre and inexplicable, could they be the product of
Mengele's machinations? Now, with exclusive access,
EXPLORER goes inside the investigation; From the
secret agents who trailed him, to the scientists now
uncovering the facts behind the fantastical phenomenon,
no stone is left unturned.
