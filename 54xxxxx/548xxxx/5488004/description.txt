MIGHTY MO RODGERS  DISPATCHES FROM THE MOON
Label: Dixie Frog
Release Date: 2009
Format:Mp3@320


The father of nu bluez confirms his standing as a genius and a precursor with this new release, the fourth chapter of an unprecedented odyssey through the poetic meanderings of the blue note. Mo has taken refuge on the moon this time; in his own iconoclastic way, he's sending us musical dispatches dealing with the often sad, sometimes happy, state of our world. The blues Ã©quivalent of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, no less!
