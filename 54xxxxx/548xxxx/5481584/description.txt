"Wrong Baby Wrong Baby Wrong", or its shortened name when released as a single, "Wrong Baby Wrong", is the title of a song recorded by American country  artist Martina McBride. It was written by Brad and Brett Warren (who comprise The Warren Brothers), along with Robert Ellis Orrall and Love and Theft member Stephen Barker Liles. The song was released in February 2010 as the third single from her tenth studio album, Shine.

The music video, which was directed by Theresa Wingert, premiered on CMT on March 18, 2010. In the video, McBride is shown driving her car to pick up her friends, who appear to be upset after their boyfriends' walked out on them, to take them out for a good time. The first woman she picks up is drinking coffee alone in a diner, the second is at a laundromat doing her laundry, and the third woman is shown staring out her apartment window. Atfer picking up her friends, McBride takes them to a bar so that the women can enjoy themselves, while she performs the song on stage.

The 9513 reviewer Blake Boldt gave the song a thumbs-up, stating that while the song "stumbles in telling its story," it "offers the listener a blast of sass thatâ€™s sorely missing from country radio." He also favorably described the song's production as having a "bluesier edge," with a "groovy energy [that] breathes life into a slight little ditty."

"Wrong Baby Wrong Baby Wrong" debuted at #51 on the U.S. Billboard  Hot Country Songs chart for the week of February 6, 2010. It also debuted at #46 on the Canadian Radio & Records Country Singles chart for the week of February 8, 2010. It also debuted at #95 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of April 15, 2010.
