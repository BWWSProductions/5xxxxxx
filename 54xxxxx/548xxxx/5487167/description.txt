Family Guy Volume 3 Disc 1. 

Didn't have to compress this disc it came from the store at 4.37GB. I did remove the previews that came on it and that was it, it's ready to burn.

On the disc are episodes 1 - 4

(NTSC)


Like I've said before I'll always leave in the comments when I finish seeding which is usually when the ratio gets to 3 or 4 then on to the next disc, so if the torrent stops for a bit it's because I went to work and the torrent will be down for 4 to 8 hours.
