The album that put this Kansas City, MO, band on the map as everyone's favorite emo-pop rockers, with catchy lyrics, fairly unique and powerful pop/rock composition, and an overall sense of energy. Their lyrical content is centered around remembering painful relationships, regret of past mistakes, and longing for that special someone. Favorite tracks on this one would be "Coming Clean," "Stay Gold, Ponyboy," and "Fall Semester." If you don't have this and you enjoy poppy, catchy emo, you'd love it.
