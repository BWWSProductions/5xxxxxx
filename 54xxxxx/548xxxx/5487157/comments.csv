,mikexxxryan,2010-04-09T05:31Z,WHY is this rar'd?  NO REASON other then to request a fee password to rar a video file.  If this is real then stop RARing your file.

,Jankavkee,2010-04-09T13:18Z,"Yes, why the RARs?? I 've had good RARs off of PB but a few that needed passwords. With a downloading rate of 35 kbps (seriously) I like to make sure it's good. Sorry to doubt you TvTeam...any way you can do AVIs? Your efforts, of course, are greatly appreciated."
,Max Wilder,2010-04-10T02:35Z,"The videos come in RAR format because that is how they are released on message boards like usenet. Each file can be verified independently so if there is an upload error, only the damaged file needs to be resubmitted.

People who submit torrents full of RARs are simply passing along the raw data they received from the message board. 

Personally, I think it is lazy, since the format serves no purpose in torrent distribution mode. But people keep doing it, after years of torrenting. So they must think it serves some purpose."

,GasMaskAssassin,2010-04-18T18:27Z,But they never used to be on TV Shares. All they need to do is unpack it b4 they pass it on!
