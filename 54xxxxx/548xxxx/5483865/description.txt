plot:
Five friends fill their idle hours with petty crime. One day,
a professional gang leader and his charming girlfriend convince
them to participate in a major bank heist. When the authorities
appear on the scene, the youngsters--who are in over their heads--are 
caught. The youths are surprised when, instead of being punished with 
the usual imprisonment in a detention centre, they are sentenced to serve
 a year and a half at Glen Mills, an experimental reform school.
