,DemonicArc,2010-04-18T11:37Z,Mind explaining why installation instructions are in Japanese?
,Tynach,2010-04-21T00:24Z,"64-bit version, please?"
,smash.com,2010-05-06T08:18Z,its probably a beta only that's why it's jap and no 64-bit. I don't think the retail is even out yet.
,vilsusa,2010-05-11T18:28Z,But does it install correctly?
,elan96,2010-05-13T17:58Z,"I downloaded, the crack works and I am currently enjoying it! If you need the english crack instructions its exactly the same method as in the 2010 version"
,HaxLi,2010-05-18T14:23Z,"yes, 64-bit version, please :]"
,king3d,2010-05-23T11:12Z,you can download at 32/64 bit version at Cgpersia
,__int64,2010-06-21T16:03Z,folk wants the 64-bit version.

I definitely see why the noobs are crying though...nnjust poke around, maybe you can figure it out.nIt does seem to be the 36-bit version, which is fine for me. Anyways, thank you a ton for the upload! :)"
,Savvy24,2010-07-26T16:38Z,"getting the 'insert disk1' error, anyone know a fix?"
,jerryjames91,2010-08-02T05:58Z,"""Please Insert Disc labelled DISC_1 1"" What the hell is this?"
,carebearrr,2010-08-06T23:39Z,"Neither installers work. setup.exe eventually says ""Insert Disc labeled Disk 1 Cd 1"" and x86/max/3dsMax2011_32bit.msi says there's something wrong with the satellite tcp port. Help ?"
,oris1024,2010-08-14T07:39Z,"alright, like someone has already said here, use instructions from 2010 torrent. if you get insert disk_1 message - cancel that installation, copy all files from the iso onto a folder on you hdd and run setup.exe from there"
,W0LL3R,2010-09-18T03:21Z,TEST
,W0LL3R,2010-09-18T03:22Z,I will upload the x64 bits version within short :)
,Exevium,2010-10-06T19:10Z,Anyone got an idea where to find the authentification code?
,Fujirich,2010-10-07T19:49Z,"None of the serial numbers included in this download work.
Product key apears to work fine so far..."
,Rapier69,2010-10-12T21:50Z,"Works well, hint is to disconnect the internet before starting the registration process, and make sure you click the mem fix on the cracker or it will give bad returns."
,TeamDCPX,2010-10-28T07:29Z,"Worked Fine For me. And Yes it is the 32-bit version. Btw, A Full installer of x64 is already out for those with the need to run 64 bit.
Im Running Windows 7 x64 with no problems.

p.s. According to a post above, Apparently they now offer 36 Bit versions of this software. Go figure. ;) haha "

,All4h,2011-01-19T03:43Z,"Great torrent. Gotta' say. You're pretty stupid if you can't figure out how to get it working, regardless of the Japanese instructions. You don't even need the crack. Just the serial/product key. 

Thanks a lot for this one."
,Leechless,2011-01-28T10:18Z,"Fucking idiots. Simple as that.
No hating, it does not help.
Thank the upload for successfully completing his job, UPLOADING CORRECTLY. The instructions are online, and I'm sure the uploader didn't make the crack/keygen so don't go flaming because your relying on them for instruction. The only thing you need is a Product/Serial ID or a Crack, so QUIT WASTING YOUR FUCKING TIME AND LET ALONE OURS. If you don't know how to work with the crack provided, LOOK IT UP. If you absolutely think the crack provided will not work for you (WHICH MOST LIKELY IT DOES), THEN LOOK UP ANOTHER ONE.
Remember folks, STAY LEECHLESS."
,Leechless,2011-01-28T10:59Z,"Just to keep my credentials up, I am going to provide some help for you noobs.
I myself, not knowing any Japanese whatsoever, successfully activated this product, and can confirm it is in working order.
Basically setup the product until the activation A.K.A. license page, if you have installed a trial version do not worry this will still work, and I can confirm this also.

After you are on the activation/license setup page, input the given ""Autodesk 2011 max product Key"" with a given ""Serial number"" both of which are residing in the Japanese README (å®‰è£…ä¸Žç ´è§£æ–¹æ³•.txt) alongside those exact words, hence the quotes. Next, you will be on a page asking you to activate the product through the internet, DO NOT DO THIS. Choose the option suggesting you have your own key, copy the given Authentication Code on the next activation page which should be 8 sets of 4 letters/numbers. Open the Not-So-Useless keygen (xf-a2011-32bits.exe) and paste your authentication code in the Request text box, MAKE SURE TO REMOVE THE ""PASTE YOUR AUTHENTICATION HERE"", and click Generate. This will provide a Not-So-Abnormally long Activation code which you should paste into the 16-box verification on the activation page. IT MOST LIKELY WILL NOT FILL ALL BOXES, THIS IS NORMAL.

If you need more steps, you ARE a noob.
If this help was necessary, you ARE a noob.
If this help was successful, you ARE a LITTLE less of a noob.

Thanks for your time, STAY LEECHLESS."
,ioanar,2011-02-05T00:54Z,"Hello.
I was wondering if you could help me. I installed my product and got to the Activate page, opened the crack file and pasted the request code and generated the activation one. Pasted that on the activation page in the first box and it pasted all in the first 14 boxes, but than I got this error:
Registration-Activation Error (0015.111) 
 There is a problem with the activation code that you entered. Click one of the following links. 

And I kept trying generating several codes, even pasted it 4 by 4 in each box, and got the same error. And I did check to see if I pasted everything wright.
Thank you very much."
,_msp_,2011-02-17T23:07Z,"Well here is what happened to me: I tried mounting the image -> Disc error, I extracted the ISO to hard drive and tried to install, no problem with any of the serials or anything... 

At the end of the installation some whining about failure to install, it started the installation process again and installed the failed component. Gr8 but then comes the fun part about this all.... ---> Somehow my admin account in windows  did not have the user privileges to the software... Yeehaa! I manually edited the privileges settings on every file and folder of the installation. 

Administrator privileges did not do anything, no way to start the software and no way to uninstall it. Absolutely f-ing fantastic. "
,godsmack41,2011-03-09T10:47Z,"This works perfect but i get an error something like ""application failed to initialize properly 0x000007b"".I know that this is not software's fault but does anyone knows how to solve it.Please"
,AutoDeskMaya,2011-03-09T15:23Z,Serial and this key works perfect . No problem at all! No virus! SeeD! Thank you!
,IA4,2011-03-27T06:42Z,It's clean and works perfectly on windows7 32 bits. just make sure you copy files to HD and beging installation from there. serials are in the crack folder. Thanks to the uploader.

Thank you a lot for the link, I didn't found it 'cuz I was searching for ""3ds max"" in stead of ""3dsmax"" :D"
,Jack_Sparrow2011,2011-05-20T00:40Z,"If you're having a problem with the ISO file, its because you gotta move the folder to your desktop and start the installation from there, and mount the ISO file. If you run the setup from the ISO file, then itll confuse the computer, hence the ""insert disk 1_1"" Run the setup from the desktop, and the message wont pop up anymore."
,joekneebone,2011-05-24T14:19Z,"You can just go in the autodesk website and get the software for free. Not a 30-day trial, not a shitty version, but the full version. You just got to sign up to the education program thing. And then you get all their software for free."
,jordanboyd5,2011-08-13T19:18Z,"ive gotten everything to the activation step and its down to using this keygen, i run it as an admin, mem patch as im supposed to but the activation code is eight characters short, leaving box 15 and 16 empty? anyone know a solution??"

It doesn't meter... they use to be empty... but there may be bug if you failed with activation... i had same problem... first code thats given didnt pass... but I repeated process... paste request code again and generate for new code... second code will pass :)"
,johnydecali,2011-09-07T08:33Z,"anyone ever try downloading the ""free trail"" from Autodesk and then tried using a keyggen for the registration code?"
,totoylooks,2012-02-14T09:53Z,This torrent will require you to answer a survey after downloading the file. You will never receive a confirmation. I suggest that you just try something else.
,Sanity222,2012-05-07T22:10Z,How come there's no keygen in the download?
