Here is the Race of the Formula 1 2010 Round 3 @ Sepang International Circuit - Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

A piece of lap 33 is missing. I had to stop recording because the BBC switched the coverage from BBC One to BBC Two. Can't do anything about it. Blame the BBC. See this as a commercial break i had to cut out.
