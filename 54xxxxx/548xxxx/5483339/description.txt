This Charming Life is possibly her most electric album in her nearly 40-year career, a rocker stocked with screaming guitars, weighty rhythms, and unabashedly powered-up vocal performances. With almost every song written in the first person, itâ€™s also some of Armatradingâ€™s most intimate music.

In the bashing â€œHeading Back to New York City,â€ the singer vows to return to the Big Apple â€œto do the things I never didâ€ (among them, for whatever reason, to â€œsee Staten Islandâ€). And the naive, if appropriately charming, opening title track finds her demanding, â€œEvery government must pass a law that says the sun has to always shine.â€ Itâ€™s an uplifting set of joyous proclamations (â€œIâ€™ll ride the seven seas for you,â€ â€œI want you to always be by my sideâ€) balanced by the occasional declaration of pain (â€œCry,â€ â€œTwo Tearsâ€) â€” Joan Armatrading back in the game.
