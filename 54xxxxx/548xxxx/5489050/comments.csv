,mjeith,2010-04-10T11:21Z,It's just clevelandsteemer that's a moron. Anyone with some brains use an anonyminizer when uploading.
,t06afre,2010-04-10T12:37Z,The comment from clevelandsteemer reminds of a proven wanker with nick bander49. I would not be suprised if clevelandsteemer and bander49 is the same person. They have the same style then writing complete useless comments

,russell1nash,2010-04-11T00:08Z,"can some1 please post some bitrate info?
i mean a 162 mins flick, 2 x 5.1 audio tracks and an untouched video? I am a little skeptic: I have always enjoyed iNJECT's work, but i don't know what kind of compression r we taking about from the original... 
thanx!"
,Nidas,2010-04-11T09:26Z,"The sample is certainly NOT DVD-quality, but then 162 minutes untouched on a regular 4,7Gb DVD didn't make sense to begin with.

I wouldn't watch it, unless you think analog TV with bad reception is a quality pic, or you plan to watch in on your i-phone..."
