Greatest Hits II is a compilation album by country music artist Kenny Chesney. It was released on May 19, 2009, and it is his second greatest hits album since Greatest Hits in 2000. The album includes twelve singles from 2002 to 2009, as well as two non-singles from previous albums ("Be as You Are" from Be as You Are (Songs from an Old Blue Chair) and "I'm Alive" from Lucky Old Sun). Also included is the new song "Out Last Night", which was issued as a single in March 2009, followed by "I'm Alive" in August 2009.

The album will be re-released in 2010 to include two new tracks, "This Is Our Moment" and "Ain't Back Yet". The former was used by the television network ESPN as a college football theme and peaked at #46 based on unsolicited airplay, while the latter was released to radio in February 2010.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine, reviewing the album for Allmusic, gave it four stars out of five. He said that the album was stronger than his last two studio albums because it did not contain as many laid-back songs. Erlewine also called "Out Last Night" an "amiable day-after shuffle."

Kenneth Arnold "Kenny" Chesney (born March 26, 1968) is an American country music artist. Since 1993, Chesney has recorded 13 albums, 11 of which have been certified gold or higher by the RIAA. He has also produced more than 30 Top Ten singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, 17 of which reached Number One. In addition, Chesney has received six ACM (including four consecutive Entertainer of the Year Awards), as well as six CMA awards. Chesney is also one of the most popular touring acts in country music, regularly selling out the venues at which he performs; his 2007 Flip-Flop Summer Tour was the highest-grossing country road trip of 2007. He was awarded his 4th consecutive ACM Entertainer of the Year award on May 18, 2008.
