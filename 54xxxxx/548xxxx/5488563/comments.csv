,Sheboink,2010-06-13T13:02Z,"Brilliant transfer; I'd give it 10 for both audio and video (9 for each when taking into account the quality of the original).

But... I've been sitting here at 99.9% for several weeks now; isn't there ANYONE willing to seed? I'll be seeding it for at least six months once I've finished the transfer, but at the moment I see 46 leechers and zero seeds :-(

*** PLEASE SEED!!! ***"
,Barebonexxx,2010-06-14T16:47Z,I hear you Sheboink! I'll started the seeding again.
,Sheboink,2010-06-19T03:46Z,"Barebone, if you're the guy on Canal Digital Kabel (at 212.251.x.x), it looks like there's a problem with corruption - my BT client keeps banning your IP because of repeated bad blocks (actually, the same bad block received multiple times).

And I see I'm not the only one, because all of the other leechers are still sitting at 99.9% the same as me, with the same blocks missing.

Has anything happened to the file(s) since you originally uploaded the torrent? Can you play Highlander III without problems on your system?"
,Barebonexxx,2010-06-19T12:58Z,"I can play all the movies without problems.
I got a ""Red arrow"", stopped the seeding and started it again, now it looks ok.

Bu I do see that all are stuck at 98.8%. I really don't know why..."
,WTFOMGBBQH4X,2010-07-05T13:01Z,Are there any seeds out there that aren't corrupt or do we have to assume that the upload was corrupt from the start?
,WTFOMGBBQH4X,2010-07-14T12:46Z,Can you please upload this.nnCan\'t even watch the 3rd movie - this torrent is FAIL!
,jannps,2010-09-16T21:39Z,"what's the deal guys? Any seeders out there or do we just all sit at 99.9% the rest of the month???
SEED, please, somebody!"
,bogdanciobea,2010-10-19T19:51Z,"It was ok until i'm now at 99.9% . And STOPED , since 4 days !!! I think it is not normal !!!! "
