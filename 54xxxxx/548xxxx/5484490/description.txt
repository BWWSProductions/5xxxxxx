The Powerpuff Girls Movie (known within the film simply as The Powerpuff Girls) is an animated feature-length film based on the Cartoon Network animated television series of the same name. Produced by Cartoon Network for Warner Bros., the film debuted in the US  on July 3, 2002. It was more or less a prequel of the series, telling the origin story of how the Powerpuff Girls were created and how they came to be the defenders of Townsville. Despite making very little profit at the box office, the film was a critical success.


This movie is surprisingly hard to find, but I secured a copy of it and now I'm uploaded for the masses. FYI, this version DOESN'T have shitty Swedish hardsubs. Just the regular ol' movie in English. 

Seed and enjoy.
