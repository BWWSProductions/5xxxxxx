    In the year 2012, the 3rd great war comes to an end. The war claims      
    no victors, but both sides succeed in executing their chemical           
    warfare campaigns. The result is over 3 billion deaths. Over             
    ninety-eight percent of the male survivors are rendered sterile.         
    Human reproduction is realized by means of cloning. The first strand     
    of clones are harvested in December of 2012 and received with            
    overwhelming success. It was not until nineteen years later that the     
    first problems arose.
