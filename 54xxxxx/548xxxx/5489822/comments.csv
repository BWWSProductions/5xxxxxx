,{Arx},2010-04-12T20:23Z,"No comment, just a question. What the hell you want to reach. Where is the point you are going to? Why? Is this really funny? From my side it isn't. Calm down. I didn't write anything annoying  to you. But yo are so offensive. Do you need such circumstances? "

Translation:  Hi.  I'm an abrasive internet asshole.

Next time, try to render a direct answer to a direct question and consider that your opinion on anyone's intelligence level was never requested.

Might save you some annoyance."

Frankly speaking I don't know what your mind created itself. 
Translation: Does your comment make any sense?

Might save you some annoyance."
