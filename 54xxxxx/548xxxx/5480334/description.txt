A high-speed hack n' slash co-developed by Red Entertainment and Taito to celebrate the latter's 50th anniversary, Bujingai: The Forsaken City follows its hero Lau to the 23rd century and the destruction of 70% of the world's population. To get things rolling, Lau returns to earth after an intergalactic sabbatical to fight off a horde of invading demons that have begun to overtake the landscape. He'll have to use his arsenal of spin, slash, and spell commands in order to fend them off too, and even has the possibility of landing combos of up to 1000 hits at a time.
