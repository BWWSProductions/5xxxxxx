,Rockhound,2010-04-15T16:08Z,"rgl_config.txt for xp. Is actually rlg_log and is located in the mount and blade map. If you are looking for the secure connetion thing it might not be there and it might be. I think it is set on 0 as default. So if you find it or not its probably set to 0 allready.. And if its not there, try to start the game or something and it might show up"
