,schizogeny,2010-04-05T12:45Z,"Thanks for the torrent but the file doesn't seem to be seeded, despite what TPB says."
,schizogeny,2010-04-05T13:00Z,"Nevermind, it just started...

Thanks again! :)"
,DeReX2,2010-04-05T19:42Z,omg 99.99% please seed...
,h4xrk1m,2010-04-05T20:13Z,"I suspect this is a troll. The torrent only loads to 99.9%, and the only missing piece is the fucking header of the first rar file. This, of course, renders the whole damn archive useless >."
,Flokker,2010-04-05T20:28Z,"tvteam is generally great.

not sure what the prob is here though, been stuck at 99% for ages."
,samueljackson,2010-04-05T20:31Z,"Everyone is stuck at 99.9%

Noooooooo"
,srsTBob,2010-04-05T20:32Z,"Stuck at 99.96%, but if I force it to unrar it anyways it works well, about 5 seconds worth of errors near the beginning."
,pt.caesar,2010-04-05T21:49Z,Please upload the incompleted .rar.
,struggling,2010-04-05T22:49Z,really? no seed? wtf
,Scazza,2010-04-05T22:55Z,"Anyone understand what's going on that we're all stuck at 99.9%? It's just the .sfv file I'm missing (I cancelled the .txt files & sample) and the RAR won't complete without it.  Any clues at all?  If this is a scam, what is the point?"
,Ungkaren,2010-04-05T23:26Z,Have uploaded the missing files to this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5482395
,Scazza,2010-04-05T23:51Z,Anyone who wants to email me the .sfv file (orenji-x264-breaking.bad.303.sfv) can to aanon44 @ gmail. Thanks!
,Scazza,2010-04-06T00:50Z,Rock on! It worked! Thanks!

,nutmeg7,2010-04-06T19:55Z,"TVTeam is not a troll.  They are probably the most reliable source of 720p on public sites.  This sort of thing happens on a lot of TVTeam torrents lately, but if you wait a bit, they normally complete eventually.  I'm not sure why that happens exactly, but I'm gonna go out on a limb & say if you seed their torrents a bit more and say thanks on all the ones you download, the problem will likely go away.  Just a thought...

I got the last piece from another torrent.  I'll seed it for you all now."
,Phorat,2010-04-08T00:49Z,"Better still, just download mAgic12's 720p torrent for this episode (also on TPB).  It's complete, and it's good (just checked it)."

,VonEviL,2010-04-09T22:06Z,"They sure are wonderful tho, them RARs are rather annoying, in my opinion."
