Cadillac Tramps - Live!  (2000)

BYO Records


Live! features the Cadillac Tramps performing a selection of the best material from all 3 of their out-of-print albums. Live does an excellent job of summing up the first part of the band's career. Fast, hard, tight rock 'n' roll like Mother used to make. Your parole officer probably won't like it.

Recorded at The Galaxy Theater, Santa Ana, California.


The Cadillac Tramps are: 

Mike "Gabby" Gaborno (vocals); Brian Coakley, Mike "Maddog" Combs (guitar); Warren Renfro (bass); Steven "Spanky" Barrios (drums).
