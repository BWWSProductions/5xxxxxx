R.H. and seeders."
,SerSpec-V,2010-04-19T20:05Z,I found it to be too dim and dark. Needs the brightness turned up so I'd get another copy. 
,MikeQuest333,2010-12-02T16:54Z,"Thanks for uploading and to those seeding.
good movie, okay print, the video is pretty dark at times and the volume is low. but considering its a 2 hr movie in 700 mb rip, its pretty good.
