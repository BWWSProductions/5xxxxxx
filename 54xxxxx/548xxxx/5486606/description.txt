It's early 21st century and the majority of the world's countries have created the ICP (International Corps for Peace), an organization dedicated to bringing about world peace. However, not all countries are keen to be involved and these persist in generating conflicts through the organisation GHOST. A secret organisation, which warrants only the economic interests of its members without any attachment to morals, GHOST, does not hesitate to create crisis situations with the goal of destabilising the worldwide equilibrium and endanger any chance of peace...


There are 2 playable campaigns in Conflict Zone: the GHOST campaign, and the ICP campaign. Missions take place in locations like the Ukraine and Indonesia. Most missions require the player to build a base in order to successfully complete the mission. The civilians are taken to your base to earn money from propagandistic popularity, so instead of destroying supply depots like most games you have to kill the civilians that linger in the enemy's base. There are several buildings which can be built, including refugee/enlistment camps (refugee camps for the ICP, enlistment camps for the GHOST), barracks, vehicle factories, and logistics buildings (which speed up unit and structure construction/training times).
