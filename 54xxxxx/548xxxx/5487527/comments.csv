,LLite,2010-04-10T14:03Z,It works very pure. There is trojans in it.
[T],gamerguuy,2010-04-10T15:24Z,LLITE please don't scamThis is 100% tested and one more thing:cracking software are always detected like that because they do not have any digital signatures and its the way they are made so there are no trojans in it :)
,LLite,2010-04-10T17:58Z,Im sorry gamerguuy you right.
[T],gamerguuy,2010-04-10T22:54Z,Its okay.i feel happy to share my knowledge with you.Cheers!!
,syberdark,2010-04-11T18:15Z,Can we do it infinitly? like after each 30 days ?
,FinalFreedomEclipse,2010-04-15T01:50Z,sure you can syberdark. until they update it again & remove the 'trial' part of the software like they did with 2010. So i say enjoy it while it lasts because sooner or later your gonna be searching for keys just like the rest of us
,drleo125,2010-04-18T21:11Z,thanks buddy... keep it up..u r the saviour.
[T],gamerguuy,2010-04-19T11:54Z,@FinalFreedomEclipse who said that they removed the trial part of the software?I was just using it recently.The trial is there and it always will be.
[T],gamerguuy,2010-04-19T11:59Z,"Yes you can do it infinity.It works like this:when you install kis trial version,the kis store info in a registery that you have activated the trial on this computer  so even if you uninstall the kis,the registery is still there.But this app delets that registery and the kis searches for the registery but does not finds it and so it lets you have a trial again ^^"

,sandysen,2010-04-30T12:49Z,hats off to u gamerguuy for the work u hv done... jst one question. can we use the same process ( the one u hv mentioned in the notepad) to reset trial for Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 as well or does it work only for Kaspersky Pure?.. Thanks in advance...
[T],gamerguuy,2010-04-30T22:18Z,yeah it works with that one too.
,Vonyx,2010-05-01T12:18Z,thanx mate
,jelly_bubbles,2010-05-03T01:02Z,"Hi, I am just being really stupid but its still telling me that my license is due to expire in 0 days."
,High_Voltage_Rock_N_Roll,2010-05-14T00:44Z,"Thanks gamerguy, worked great."
[T],gamerguuy,2010-05-20T19:52Z,@jelly_bubbles maybe you did not reset the licence correctly.Try it again.
,champofchampions,2010-05-21T11:30Z,"@gamerguuy : any chance of getting a key file for pure? cuz the blacklist crack works (check my torrents) and i included keys for KIS and KAV, but dont have a key for pure..."
,WeLoveSiham,2010-05-22T16:24Z,"Hey I think this thing must be good,everyone gives good reviews,but I'm just wondering,isn't there a real key file,something like Chatchitto's key file for KIS?His one works for KIS,it gives you 257 days of license..

But this is just 30 days,and you have to redo it after 30 days,would be a great thing if you can upload something like this:http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5571349/Kaspersky_Internet_Security_2010_Keys_By_%5BChattChitto_RG%5D

Thanks! :)"
,Jacobred,2010-05-23T09:05Z,"@Above, they have not cracked the pure license system yet, therefore keys can't be made."
,Vonyx,2010-06-05T14:01Z,"Just a quick one gamerguuy, do i have to wait for my days to run out before renewing, because i tried with 4 days left, seems to work ok, but the days wont renew, btw, good looking out with the great uploads.Thanks."
,Atlantis888,2010-06-13T19:01Z,"Hey!
i downloaded your trial reset, followed the instructions but somehow it doesnt work for me.
I tried several times....
I use win7 64 bit Op syst. maybe it doesnt support that?"
,strawhot_25,2010-06-18T06:43Z,tnx gamerguuy!!
,WeLoveSiham,2010-06-18T11:16Z,"@llibanim

Oh i see,well sorry for my ignorance haha I'm new to all these key things..but anyway your right my KIS 2010 just got blocked..but anyway I will try this out..so I just need to download the trial and use this?And then when the 30 days is over i just need to reset the trial using this and make it back to 30 days?"

,venky716,2010-07-23T22:18Z,dude u r the best ....kaspersky pure is one of the best total protectors out there and u have cracked it ....thanks a lot.....
,sandysen,2010-08-25T10:45Z,Hi gamerguuy. Is it possible to get a trial reset for Kaspersky Internet Security 2011(11.0.1.400) ? I am a BIG fan of your torrents. Thanks in advance.
,rainthai,2010-09-03T22:59Z,Works...!!! ur the best......!!
,hanokp,2010-09-10T21:28Z,"@@gamerguuy Hi, i am using this Trial Reset for 32-bit WINXPSP3 for the past 3 months.  Thanq very much and its works flawless.  But the same Trial Reset does not work for my laptop which runs on a 64-bit WIN7... Plz can u make a Trial reset for 64-bit WIN7 also, any help would be highly appreciable.  "
,hanokp,2010-09-10T21:30Z,"Moreover i feel the cause of the failure in WIN7 is because, 32-bit programs going into a separate folder by name Program Files (x86) but not into Program Files as it happens in WINXP.  I believe the crack option path set to the above folder will rectify the problem....wat say...

Thanks"
,Hagas132,2010-09-26T12:05Z,Thank you

,joannax3,2011-03-03T14:48Z,"I don't think this is working right for me. My friend installed Kaspersky Pure for me originally and my cracked trial JUST ran out. I did everything this torrent said & this is something along the lines of what I got...
""File Anti Virus: Unable to start task. Can not find license."" 
Help? "
,Clemenator,2011-05-06T05:39Z,Gamerguuy u r a legend works perfect :) everyone using 64bit just run it as admin & it will work fine
,Guuuiii,2012-05-01T20:29Z,"Hello Buddie!
