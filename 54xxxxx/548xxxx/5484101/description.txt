Experience (subtitled "Original Soundtrack from
the Feature Length Motion Picture 'Experience'") is material culled from the Jimi Hendrix
appearances at Royal Albert Hall in London during February 1969. As with the sequel to this
outing, 1972's More Experience, the liner notes -- quoting both Hendrix and his
contemporary, Eric Clapton -- claim the material is from the February 18, 1969, concert,
though it is more likely that this is the second show that happened on February 24 of that
year. It is mere fragments of the program and should have been combined with the follow-up
or other selections from the performance. Steven Roby's excellent book -Black Gold: The
Lost Archives of Jimi Hendrix refers to this album as having "horrid sound quality on highly
edited official recordings from this show." If one doesn't have the bootleg to compare, the
album is quite listenable, though much too brief. "We'd like to blast your eardrums one more
time," Jimi says during a lengthy tune-up prior to a title the producers call "Smashing of the
Amps" -- which is actually the intro to "Purple Haze" mutating into a very brief "Star Spangled
Banner." The cut takes up one half of one side of this recording but delivers very little.
"Sunshine of Your Love" is fun and "Room Full of Mirrors" is also a delight, at least
performance-wise, Hendrix acknowledging the presence of Chris Wood and Dave Mason of
Traffic on the "Smashing of the Amps" segment -- though they aren't credited anywhere on
the album jacket. With the Experience Hendrix company releasing so much other high-quality
material, this one is definitely for the completists/fanatics.
