[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-08T00:54Z,"@wolfik1958:  Hi there, sorry that you're having problems.  As I cannot see what is going on with your computer then I cannot help you unless you can explain exactly what the problem is that is causing you to not be able to download this particular torrent.  As far as I know it should download just fine, everybody else seems to be ok and I'm sure that if I decided that I wanted to download it again then I could just do that myself without any problems.  It's very unlikely that I have done something wrong in making this torrent because I have made lots of them in the past and I have been doing this for years now.

Maybe you should try and get a good understanding of what you're doing really in using bittorrent, all I can do is suggest that you read a lot about how it all works.  I really do not know why you can download all the others apart from this, it doesn't really make sense.  They are all pretty much the same torrent apart from the fact that each one has different Now albums contained within."

,RaveParadise,2010-08-07T18:01Z,"For the attention of people that are seeding this torrent.  This is SpandauBaby, I am sorry to say that I have been forced to use another account because the bastards at Pirate Bay have screwed my account up and I cannot use it anymore.  I have lost all my access to my SpandauBaby one.  I have had to leave Pirate Bay because of this fact and have now moved over to demonoid instead.  I have also decided to leave because somebody has started reuploading this torrent again and is trying to make out that it's their work.  I was the one responsible for putting this Now collection together.  It took me ages and lots of hard work to manage to tag all the files like this, I spent hours on end working on it so I could deliver this torrent in the quality that it is.

I regret to say that somebody called Stun has copied my torrent and also somehow managed to upload all 5 torrents of this collection as 1 single torrent and I don't know how they could have done that because I tried ages ago and Pirate Bay tracker won't allow you to do such a thing with so many loose files.

I have just recently been bullied now by a moderator on here who is denying the fact that somebody is reuploading my work again claiming it to be theirs and threatening to take action.  I personally think this sucks and this is exactly what you get from using this site.  I am happy to move over to demonoid now instead, I have simply had enough of this place.  I originally made this Now torrent and received a pink skull for my efforts for my SpandauBaby account but this is now useless because Pirate Bay have blocked me from my own acccount and didn't even offer to help.

My advice to people seeding this is to seed this and not the other version uploaded by Stun as this is the correct version and hasn't been tampered with.  I cannot guarantee you would receive the same quality version of this from that other version.

Thanks for listening, SpandauBaby"
