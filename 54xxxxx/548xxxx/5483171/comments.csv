,ffhhkk,2010-04-07T13:22Z,the aspect ratio of  this movie isn't correct. U haf to play it with 2.21:1 in VLC to get the correct ratio. Can some1 at FXG fix this?

How about uploading ""The Elite Squad""? I can only find a polish/mp.4 version on TPB. Also, a regular ""District 9"" in avi would be nice!"
