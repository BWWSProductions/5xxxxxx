Plot

Ernest Tilley and Bill "BB" Babowsky are "tin men" â€” door-to-door aluminum siding salesmen in Baltimore in 1963. Working for different companies, they are prepared to do almost anything â€” legal or illegal â€” to close a sale. BB buys a shiny Cadillac to maintain his image of success and almost immediately crashes into another Cadillac driven by Tilley (all "tin men" drive a Cadillac). It is not clear who is at fault for the accident (BB is entering the public way from the dealer, in reverse but very slowly; Tilley has the right of way, however, he was clearly distracted). This generates a spate of road rage and the two rivals vow to do anything to get back at the other.
