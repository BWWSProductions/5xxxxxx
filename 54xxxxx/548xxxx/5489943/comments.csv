,Green_Banana,2010-04-10T22:48Z,"Well, it wasn't THAT quick, but this is the CORRECT torrent and we can see what the file is, so this torrent is precisely what a torrent should be.  Minus the spamming text file, but those are easily ignored.  "

,SnoGryphn,2010-04-12T09:39Z,Fantastic!  Great quality.  Thanks so much!
,SnoGryphn,2010-04-18T11:00Z,"Audio Comment: Background music was a little too overwhelming - couldn't hear the voices many times.  VTV's audio is much better. You might want to work on tweaking that.

Thanks for our weekly Who fix!"
