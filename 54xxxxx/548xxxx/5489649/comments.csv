[T],ctang,2010-04-10T19:35Z,Next upload will be Stepfather (2009)
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-10T23:31Z,look at this guy!!  he says he will upload something and does not waste any time doing so.  this guy is great.  there is nothing negative to say about it.  and Stepfather is next!? you are amazing.  thank you for your work man.  it is much appreciated.
[T],ctang,2010-04-12T03:04Z,@zombifuzz: thanks!!! probably uploading Stepfather in the morning or really late tonight...almost have this completely uploaded...should be a bunch of seeders really soon!!!
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-12T04:21Z,im up all night so that would be awesome.  im looking right now and you have about 15 people at 97% of higher including myself and a ton about 80%.  this will be seeded for a while from me too.
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-12T05:22Z,once you upload more dvd-rs and people start taking to you i am going to recommend you for trusted status to get you a skull beside your name.  i dont want to do it too early because i dont want to ruin your chances of getting one.   just letting you know i think youll be very popular very soon in the torrent world if you keep this up.
[T],ctang,2010-04-12T06:02Z,hey thanks...that would be awesome...would love a skull...i know the pink ones are the trusted people but how do people get the VIP (green) skulls...just a goal of mine...lol
[T],ctang,2010-04-12T06:06Z,zombifuzz: have you looked at the ClondDVD2 instructions i have put in the last couple torrents and if so have you tried it out
,nightsongz2,2010-04-12T07:18Z,"Thanks, ctang...burned easily, works and looked great. Appreciate it!! :-)"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-12T11:17Z,"i have never tried clonedvd2 or whatever it is.  i use an old version of Nero (Nero 7) and dont upgrade because i personally think the new Nero's suck ass.  i have never used anything other than Nero to burn my movies.  when i make custom dvds using ConvertXToDVD i dont even use that program for the burning process, i throw it into nero after conversion.  i might give it a go some day but when i find a program i really like i stick with it.  and i very rarely update my software because sometimes an updated program sucks terribly."
[T],ctang,2010-04-12T18:15Z,"zombifuzz: i know exactly how you feel, thats actually why i suggested this program...i really dont use it for burning dvd's though...for me, its primarily used for getting rid of all the extra crap on dvd's...and you get to keep the main menu...usually when i burn a disc, all i want is the main feature and the main menu and thats what clonedvd2 allows me to achieve

nightsongz2: your welcome, glad to here all is good"
