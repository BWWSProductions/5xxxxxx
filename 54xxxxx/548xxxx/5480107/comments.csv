,Mr.manga,2010-04-05T11:59Z,"I think i have Blood Rayne for ps2 (PAL) in my shelf somewhere, but i have no idea how to get it to the pc and make a torrent of it."
,Skrypto,2010-06-13T06:06Z,"wow, only a few seeds, but incredible download speeds... going at almost 1mb a sec for me :D"
,mildenze,2010-06-25T11:48Z,This is a 2 disc game?? or is the other one not necessary ??
,tiagocristiani,2010-10-04T19:01Z,"the zipped files seem to be empty even though it has more than 4Gb each. does someone know why?? please help, is that right?"
,tiagocristiani,2010-10-05T22:07Z,"damn it, I re-download it, and it is yet empty, can someone say me why??"
,tiagocristiani,2010-10-05T22:17Z,"well, it is corrupted, DO NOT download"
,tiagocristiani,2010-10-26T12:31Z,"actually, IT WORKS. So forget all I said above (there is no way to delete comments), the problem was in the burning time, and in the end of 1st Cd the game seems to crash, in fact you must put the 2nd Cd, :), took me too long to understand that!."
,ilidian9,2010-11-13T04:02Z,"@mildenze ""This is a 2 disc game?? or is the other one not necessary ??""

Dude, I laughed so hard..."
,cihangir,2010-12-13T13:45Z,"@thenoobish how did we burn this game? please tell us dude, i searched everywhere, but couldn't find a way.

Is it a blu-ray disc? or going to burn two different DVD's?

Waiting for your urgent reply."
,Dissevered,2010-12-31T23:56Z,"May I ask how you got this ripped and how we should burn it (dvd9 or 2 dvd5)?  I tried to make a copy of this game myself and it was always corrupt.  I did a lot of searching online, and people were saying that this was the hardest game on PS2 to rip.  "
,That_Hmong_Dude,2011-01-02T22:34Z,half screen is black
,qwack4,2011-01-12T23:47Z,"Kay so, I downloaded it, but when are you supposed to do with this? do you have to mount it on like daemon tools or something? please help!"
,traypalazax,2011-01-28T02:41Z,"when are you going to upload Champion's of Norrath 2 ?  Don't tell me you did'nt know anout it..lol  YOU litterly get to run through CON 1 ( Champions of  Norrath one ), Than use that exact charecter in CON 2. Blows my mind.. NEED THE GAME....

????????????????????????????????????????????"
,gusSharer86,2011-01-29T16:10Z,"DOESNT WORK AFTER CHAPTER II
screen goes black just before the loading screen to chapter II, so you cant play chapter III and none of the remaining chapters  "
,gusSharer86,2011-01-29T16:11Z,i burned it with nero in the lowest speed (4x) and the same issue persists even on the 3rd burned disc
,rodrigoann1,2011-03-03T22:39Z,"Maybe This Can Help:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

2 DVD5

-=Switch point Info=-

Upon killing Lord Vanarhost, there should be a save point in the area. After saving there, turn off the game and boot with Disc 2. It continues right where you left off and at this point, you're required to rescue a NPC named Babik. After safely taking him back to town, follow the road to the ship where a couple of cut scenes will play and you'll be in Act III. The rest of the game will be played using Disc 2. (Don't worry, it'll make sense when you get there :P)

,cifla,2011-04-08T16:36Z,"i have ps2 pal, can i play this upload,if not, do anyone know where i can find pal version of champions of norrath 
thx"
,amuletofra,2011-05-01T07:32Z,You need a NTSC to PAL converter to flip the frequency. OR find a PAL version....
,Kevin_Bacon268,2011-05-16T00:31Z,im using PCSX2 emu and im getting a half frozen screen.... anybody have ideas???
,Rabid_Possumsex,2011-05-29T19:27Z,2 mb/s DL speed and it works with swap magic (as long as you hit X a couple of times when the framerate goes crazy in the beginnng)
,ventper,2011-06-24T08:13Z,"both files are already iso, NICE!
had some trouble burning disc2, but kept at,
/shrug who knows why?
now both discs function, many thx for this awesome game! co-op rpg FTW.."
,aeuinz,2011-07-08T23:06Z,"Thenoobish, hi, thx for your uploads... Tell me, about this one, i already have it in two dvd5 like that, so i don't really know if it's the same upload or not... i only need to know, is there this ""kalisto""  pal to ntsc selector at the beginning? Cause any game with their damn pal ntsc selector incorporated at the beginning, will not play on my PS2 with swap magic. Don't worry any other game will work, no problem about that. So, if there's not this kalisto stuff, maybe it would work... is there or is there not? thx"
,aeuinz,2011-07-09T14:45Z,"Great, it's another upload , it works, this time it does not freeze on the presentation screen, thank you. I really wonder why these pal ntsc selectors they make and incorporate into the game often makes  the game not work... But this one has the famous ""russian or original version"", and it works . Now, i hope that the whole game is playable and does not freeze somewhere in the story!"
,ventper,2011-07-17T06:00Z,"noobish, many thx for this!
do you have NTSC, champions: return to arms?
there are no seeds for the other torrent currently.
i'd be happy to seed RTA once i have it, i need NTSC so that the 'import' players function will work.."
,aeuinz,2011-07-17T14:59Z,"Okay i just finished the game yesterday, so it is an excellent dvd5 version. People, you can trust it. Just follow what says rodrigoann1 to know when to switch to dvd 2. Thank you .
Now, as i see you sympathicly propose us to ask you for games, i have one, in dvd 5 version, which does not exist on the net. Well, actually, there is one version, but the game can not be continued after chapter 6. You must see what i'm talking about: Sakura Wars, So Long My Love. Unfortunately, i played this bad dvd 5 version , entered the story, liked the game, to be stopped and not being able to know the end :(   So, i know, there's this  2 dvd 9 versions, but i don't use those. Like many people, i prefer 2 dvd 5, like this one here :p  So the mission i give to anybody who knwos how to do these conversions, is to make a dvd 5 Working version of Sakura Wars, So Long My Love, can you? Like that i would know what happens next...   Thank you."
,ventper,2011-07-18T19:07Z,"alright! someone was kind enough to seed; Champions Return To Arms[NTSC], now i'll keep it goin for a while. cheers whomever u are!!"
,themndanny,2011-07-26T05:21Z,"A very well seeded torrent. I'm seeing speeds up to almost 4MB per second. Definite thumbs up, game quality TBA."
,themndanny,2011-07-26T05:22Z,You should definitely try to get Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance 2.
,xXRazorBladeXx,2011-09-20T04:05Z,Half my screen is messed and the other half is shakin' like mad. Second version of this game that's done this. What do I do?

,medllem,2012-03-14T16:38Z,I do not usually have problems to start PSx games i use epsxe 1.7.0 but how do i start this game? i have tried almost everything or is it a game that have to be burned to play?
