                WinRAR - What's new in the latest version


   Version 3.93

   1. Bugs fixed:

      a) in WinRAR 3.92 -xd:pathfolder switch could also exclude folders,
         which path does not match the path specified in the switch
         and only the folder name is the same as specified;
      
      b) switches -y -or did not work correctly together. Switch -or was
         ignored in presence of -y.
