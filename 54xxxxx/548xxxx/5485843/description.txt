Ken Smith is unquestionably one of the most interesting voices in landscape architecture; his works reflect the intensity and energy of their surroundings and challenge the distinction between landscape and art form. Ken Smith Landscape Architects/Urban Projects focuses on three prominent works in New York City: his East River Project; his work for P.S. 19; and his MoMA rooftop garden. Through Smith's colorful, playful drawings and photographs, the book reveals how each project explores new expressions of landscape design in the city.

Ken Smith Landscape Architects/Urban Projects is part of the Source Books in Landscape Architecture series sponsored by Ohio State University. These books present sketches, drawings, models, renderings, working drawings, and photographs.
