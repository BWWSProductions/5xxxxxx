This is Jim Gaffigan stand up comic. This is his first DVD but this performance has been on Comedy Central a few times. 

The only thing removed was a fbi warning and nothing else. No previews to remove I just compressed it to fit a dvd5 which didn't take much cause it was only 5.5gb to begin with. Files are ready to burn.
