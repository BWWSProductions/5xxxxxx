PLOT
In a small townâ€™s parish school run by priests, the school year starts off in an ordinary way. This autumn, however, the pupils are overcome by a strangely overwhelming rowdiness, leading them to come up with increasingly more outrageous pranks. The school welcomes a new teacher, Father Weigl. The new, young teacher is aghast at his colleaguesâ€™ liberal approach to the excessively bad behavior of the teenage pupils. Father ZoltÃ¡n, the form master of the 7th year students, pays less and less attention to the events taking place right around him. His younger brother was aboard the Titanic, which collided with an iceberg, and the official report on the injured and casualties is yet to be released.
