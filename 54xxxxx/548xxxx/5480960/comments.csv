,lolwut11234,2010-04-05T00:45Z,this had updated crack?
,data_err0r,2010-04-05T10:07Z,"Nice find my friend. Yes, crack and the such included. Keep up the good work."
,data_err0r,2010-04-05T10:23Z,"It seems I spoke too soon. I dont know if its the crack or the patch but it makes it so on the after battle screen you cant see the names of what units were killed or wounded, it just says killed(#) etc.

Also, you cant patch back after words because your save will be incompatible.

Use at own risk..."
,pi62429,2010-04-05T11:06Z,Same for me.How can I go to the preview update??
,StratubasGR,2010-04-05T12:37Z,Same for me now -.- seems we'll have to wait for 1.105 or something

,StratubasGR,2010-04-05T12:42Z,"That bug has already been reported at taleworlds' forum
