This album of T.V. advertised hits was originally planned in 1981, but it was delayed by the difficulties of getting permission to use the Double Fantasy tracks. But, when it finally did emerge, it had massive sales. 300,000 copies were sold in the U.K. in just the first week, and by the third it had topped one million, therefore averaging over 55,000 sales per day!
