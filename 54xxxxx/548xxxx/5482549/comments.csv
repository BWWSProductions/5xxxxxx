,Rod321,2011-09-08T01:38Z,"Hi raymondhome,
Thank you for this movie.
The first copy that I downloaded would not play on the computer using Windows Media or VLC & it downloaded as an M4V, I think that is what it was. I left a comment but can't find it now.

 I downloaded it again using the same torrent & it came in as an AVI & plays on the computer & subs are working.
A - 9/10
V - 9/10
Sync - 10/10
A good quality upload"
