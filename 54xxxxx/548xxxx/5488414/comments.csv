i'm just glad you all got your crysis working"

,Evilman2323,2010-05-16T23:18Z,I love you OP!!! :D
,vgvgvg7412,2010-05-21T10:20Z,"would this work on Razor1911`s copy of crysis? 
thanks :)"
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T15:31Z,"vgvgvg7412
it should work on all versions. what you find is the crysis installer is the same, its just the cracks that are different to whatever team has cracked them.
the razor version will have a crack that you use but its only for 32bit, this crack goes in your bin64 folder not the bin32 folder in your crysis directory so you still keep your razor crack.
this crack is a cracked crysis application .exe, the thing you click on to play crysis, you just put it in the bin64 file of your main crysis directory and click on it and you're playing crysis 64bit style."
,syrkax,2010-05-21T21:29Z,Will it work with any patch version? ( Asking before I patch and attempt to crack )
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T22:02Z,"syrkax
yeah it should do, i dont know what the latest patch version is but i patched it a while back for 32bit before i discovered this 64bit crack and it works  fine. you dont have to delete or copy over anything in the bin64 folder of crysis, the original application .exe is called crysis and this cracked one is called crysis64 so if you just drag it into the bin64 folder and click on it it will work, you dont need to delete the original application .exe.
i'm sure it will work with any patch version you upgrade to as its not connected to the system files, it just bypasses the no-cd nonsense the same way the 32bit cracks do."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-21T22:13Z,"syrkax
sorry dude, i got them the wrong way round, this crack is just called crysis and the original .exe is called crysis64. anyway, you just drag this cracked crysis .exe into the bin64 folder and click on it to play, the most simple easy crack ever and works perfectly. 
i wish i knew who made it so i could give them the credit they deserve."
,syrkax,2010-05-21T22:27Z,"Thank you, it seems like it works.  Will now play and hopefully it continues working :)

Thanks a lot."
,vgvgvg7412,2010-05-21T23:21Z,"Hey chuckmamuck 

Appreciate ur effort man. 
Good Job. God Bless You. 
Hope All ur desires come true. 

Thanks Again :)"
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-22T01:25Z,"syrkax.
no worries man, if its started your crysis and you're playing then you'll have no problems at all, i've not had any crashes with this crack yet, it seems solid as a rock so big respect to the creator who built an awesome crack.
just wish i knew who it was."
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-22T01:42Z,"vgvgvg7412.
and i appreciate your kind words man, thankyou.

i cant really take much credit myself, i found it on a little unknown site hidden away, i cant believe it wasnt more available. i just used it and made it more accessible cus i knew how important it is for us many 64bit users of one of the greatest games ever made. i'm not even sharing it anymore, i stopped seeding months ago, its you awesome generous guys out there that are keeping it alive and sharing it with the world. we're all doing our part so thankyou to all of you guys that are keeping it available for everyone who needs it."

,Nicedinosaur,2010-06-09T00:35Z,"I am still getting Crysis has stopped working. What's the deal? I have done this before, so I know what I am doing, but all I seem to get is that error. T_T"
,chuckmamuck,2010-06-09T20:47Z,"nicedinosaur
i dont know mate, as long as you put the cracked application .exe in the bin64 folder of your main crysis directory it should work fine when you click it. it has to be in the bin64 folder tho and not the bin32. 
have you done the, right click on it, select properties, check the run as administrator box? and then tried the compatability modes also if you need to? 
you should only need to drag it into your bin64 folder and run it as administrator tho and it should work fine."
,bampan,2010-06-11T12:00Z,"Works perfectly with razor's version. Just follow the uploader's instructions: in Windows 7 x64, set compatibility to Vista SP2, run as administrator, and copy to bin64 folder."
,DeafeningSilence,2010-07-03T02:08Z,"Hey chuckmamuck, I'll tell you EXACTLY what im doing and hopefully you'll be able to help me:

-Download from skullptura
-Extracted rar and ran the setup, it installed after 15 min.
-Tried running bin64 .exe, does not work
-Replaced launcher in Bin64 with yours, still does not work
-Tried setting up DirectX (Im using 9)
-Still does not work, I either crash right when the EA logo should appear or my mouse is just floating around a black screen.

^ That is absolutely ALL i did, nothing more, am i doing something wrong, or am i missing something? Im not a pro at this, im quite new, it may be obvious, it may not be, hopefully its a quick fix.

PS: It installs in my program files (x86), Im using Windows 7 Ultimate, and my computer is certainly capable of dealing with Crysis graphics and demands.

Thanks"
,DeafeningSilence,2010-07-03T03:07Z,"I retract my previous comment, I realized from reading bampan's comment that I needed to change your application to ""Compatible with vista pack 2"". Finally works, thanks for the crack."
,DeafeningSilence,2010-07-03T05:31Z,"I do however have one more question, when I start up Crysis by using your launcher/app, at the top of the screen and to the left it says its running using DX10, so then I try running Crysis using the launcher which says ""Crysis_play_direct9"" and it works. Last time it did not, so im not sure if thats what im suppose to do, but please confirm."
,chuckmamuck,2010-07-03T15:10Z,"hey deafeningsilence
it should automatically run in dx10 when you click the launcher, thats if your card is dx10 compatible which im sure it is so just run the launcher and you'll be fine.
also i've not tested the crack with the skullptura release but ive used the skullptura before, its the one with skullptura own installation that cracks the game automatically on install. many download it cus its only 3.5gb instead of the usual 6gb.
i'm glad you got it working, i would download an original 6gb release tho and then use the crack with it, i use the razor1911 version cus i know its original and complete as the purchased game.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3883491/Crysis-Razor1911

thats a well seeded razor version. theres many keygens on here to get the serial, i use the EA games keygen cus it has serials for all EA games, then just add the 64bit crack to the bin64 folder and you're away, it even works with updating crysis to the latest patch version.
hope this helps bro, the skullptura version is good but i prefer the original dvd version as it would be if you purchased it, i know its complete then and it can be patched and used as the original game."
,DeafeningSilence,2010-07-04T00:51Z,"It took me a bit to get it working because I needed to uninstall Crysis so I can install the patch firstly,  then run the installer for CCC (The Crysis graphics config/mod), then put in your 64-bit crack and set the compatibility to Vista pack 2, and finally it worked. I was just curious considering that it said DX10 at the top left part of the screen on start up and I thought I had DX9, which I still believe I do :S, regardless, the game works, FPS is high, graphics are incredible, and thanks again for the crack, worked great as opposed to the other ones I had tried."
,chuckmamuck,2010-07-05T00:43Z,"DeafeningSilence
nice work dude, glad you got it all sorted and working."
,chuckmamuck,2010-07-29T07:54Z,"zukazumaami

thanks alot for the info dude, its appreciated."
,siqueirah,2010-09-07T19:00Z,"I need some help, guys.
I installed crysis on my pc, I downloaded this crack and replaced in the bin64 folder. Then, I ran it in compatibility mode for vista sp2 and checked the administrator box. I get a black screen for about 3 seconds and then the message : Crysis has stopped working. 
Any ideas?
thanks"
,Nekzar,2010-09-16T18:17Z,"No idea if this will work, but my crysis goes to a blackscreen when i start it, then i just ""stop working"",l i got win7 64bit so hopefully this will make it possible to run :) will try it in a sec.

,Nekzar,2010-09-16T18:19Z,"nah, still dont get it to run..... thanks anyways."
,stationmiek,2010-10-28T02:29Z,"Can't get any cracks to work. All I get is black screens, 'can't load game dll', 'can't run game', and 'Crysis has stopped working'. The Razor version works fine on my laptop with the same version of Windows 7, but not on this PC. I've been told it has something to do with NVidia graphics drivers, but updating doesn't work."
,stationmiek,2010-10-28T02:36Z,"Using compatibility thing doesn't work either - it brings up the mouse busy thing for three seconds and does nothing (Crysis isn't in process/task manager).
The game isn't that great anyway!"
,chuckmamuck,2010-10-29T08:37Z,"you have to put the crack in your crysis bin64 folder and click on the cracked .exe not the crysis64 .exe cus that one just gives the black screen and crysis has stopped working.
i use windows 7 ultimate 64bit and nvidia gtx480 and it works fine, just right click on shortcut, properties, check the administrator box and vista service pack 2 compatability and it will work.
i've just reaplied crack to test and it works fine, i dont understand why it wont work for you."

Can you help?"
,Flux-Assasin,2010-11-18T21:17Z,"@tayyab.6 Right click the crack that you downloaded and placed in crysis 64 bit anf click properties then compatibility tab and then tick the box... windows vista sp2 and click apply.

But I am stuck it keeps saying could not launch main application!"
,tayyab.6,2010-11-19T17:37Z,"@F Assassin.
Dude I am using 7 64 bit!
I copy pasted the crack but I get a Crysis has stopped working again and again!"
,chuckmamuck,2010-11-25T14:01Z,"teyaab
place the crack in your crysis bin64 folder, then right click on the cracked .exe, the 9180kb one not the original crysis64 .exe. a pop-up box will open, click properties at the bottom of the list and another pop-up will open, select compatability and then check the run as administrator box at the bottom, then check the run in compatability mode box at the top and select vista service pack 2 from the drop down menu.
make a shortcut from the cracked .exe (the 9180kb one) to the desktop and run crysis from it and it should work.
if it doesnt work then the only other thing to try is disabling user account control, perform all the steps above and then disable UAC and hopefullly it will work then."
,chuckmamuck,2010-11-25T14:06Z,"my appologies, i meant tayyab.6.
sorry dude."
,chuckmamuck,2010-11-25T14:17Z,"if after performing the compatability steps your crysis still wont run then try disabling user account control cus running as administrator doesnt always get past it, especially when UAC is set at a high level.
just go to control panel and select user account control, then disable it and restart your pc, then try running crysis again.
i have to do this with a few cracked apps even tho i run them as administrator, after you've run the game for the first time with UAC disabled and it works ok you can then usually reapply UAC and it will still work ok.
you can also check your firewall to make sure its not blocking it from running."
,FMUP,2010-12-11T12:50Z,"made it  work in 64 bit mode finally , just  replaced with a cracjed exe and modifying the shortcut with comp mode with vista sp2 and runnin as admin

seen not much diffrence bw 32 and 64 ,its highly low fps but no cracking sound as it was in 32 bit mode "
,amfefe925,2010-12-13T12:17Z,this work on 32? cause no one seeding on the other one.. might wanna try this one

,prmayner,2010-12-29T18:28Z,"I cant believe it, i cannot friggin believe it, IT WORKS!!!!! FINALLY, FINALLY. After trying to get Crysis to work for about a month on and off cause i just gave up a few times and uninstalled it several times. So to FINALLY get this working after trying every thing i could find on the net about a black screen crash on loading game  ""I EVEN HAD THIS ONE INSTALLED BEFORE TOO"" so i dont know what happened with it this time. It's quite an agony reliever to say the least. Especially since Warhead works no problem. I've been wanting to play this game for quite some time. I ended up just deleting everything i had downloaded for Crysis including several other cracks and patches Oh and by the way i didn't install any patches. just the iso and this. so far i haven't needed the 1.2 patch then Use Razor1911 iso and this crack and then vista sp2 compatibility and administrator mode.

,chuckmamuck,2011-02-14T19:20Z,"you fucking muppet, where does it say i claim this crack as my own?
if you read the description it says ""after alot of digging around i FOUND this""
and if you look on the first page of comments you will see on one of my comments i wrote ""i wish i knew who made it so i could give them the credit they deserve"" and my following comment ""respect to the creator who built an awesome crack. i just wish i knew who it was""
i wrote those comments cus people were giving me praise like it was my work, i dont deserve that praise, i just found it and shared it to help people out.
it aint RAZOR1911's or any of the big teams, i tried every crack, even the few that were supposed to be 64bit and none of them worked, when i googled the problem i found i was one of many with the 64bit crack problem.
i found the crack on the warez sites on direct download, there was nobody's name on it, just the .exe in a folder, if i knew the creator i would of given respect to them in the description.
i didnt up this for any kind of glory, i shared what i found to help others out with the same problem, thats what file sharing is and always has been about. you should try sharing something sometime instead of just leeching and attempting to put down the people who are.
also, update your Crysis to the latest version and apply the crack, you should find it works.
