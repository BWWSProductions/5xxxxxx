this is a working crack for crysis on 64bit windows7 or vista systems.

i had loads of trouble trying to get crysis to run smooth on a 64bit 

system and couldnt find a crack or any fix anywhere and from trying to

find a fix i realised many people had the same problems with the game 

constantly crashing and crackling distorted sound. after alot of digging 

around i found this and it works perfectly.

    install
    -------

just drag or copy the .exe to your crysis bin64 folder.

its just named crysis so i left the original crysis64.exe in the folder also 

and it works fine. i ran the cracked .exe in compatability mode for 

vista sp2 and checked the run as administarator box and all is good, no 

more crashing and crackling noises, game runs smooth and alot better fps 

than with the 32bit crack.

works perfect in -DEVMODE also.

files scanned with ESET NOD32, AVG Internet Security 9.0 and Malwarebytes.
                    -----------------------------------

if anybody's wanting a 64bit crack for crysis warhead, all you do is download 

the version 1.1 hotfix for warhead (just google crysis warhead v1.1 hotfix) or
 
download it from sofpedia. its a 37mb fix that adds the bin64 folder to your 

crysis directory cus the game came without 64bit support. then just download 

any warhead crack from on here, it doesn't have to be a v1.1 or a 64bit 

crack, i just used the TDM crack, then take only the paul.dll file and add it to 

your bin64 folder replacing the original paul.dll and run the crysis64.exe and you 

got 64bit cracked warhead.
