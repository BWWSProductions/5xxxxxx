WinRAR - What's new in the latest version:
===========================================

Version 3.93

   1. WinRAR version for Windows x64 is available. If you use
      Windows x64, it is strongly recommended to install 64 bit
      WinRAR version. It provides a higher performance and better 
      shell integration than 32 bit version.

   2. RAR compression speed is improved for multi-core
      and multi-CPU systems. This improvement is most noticeable
      in Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems.

   3. "Remove duplicate folders from extraction path" option
      in "Settings/Compression" dialog is replaced by more universal
      "Remove redundant folders from extraction path" option.
      This option will eliminate redundant archive name based folders
      from extraction path if you unpack an archive with
      "Extract to DestName" context menu command and if archive
      root folder contains only one folder and no files.

   4. Changes in "Extraction path and options" dialog:

      a) "New folder" button creates a new subfolder in currently
          selected folder;

      b) F2 key renames a selected folder in the folders tree;

      c) F5 key updated the tree pane contents;

      d) Del key removes a selected folder in the folders tree.

   5. You can enable "Show seconds" option in "Settings/File list"
      dialog if you wish to see seconds in file dates in file list
      in WinRAR shell.

   6. "Where to check for SFX archives" options group
      in "Settings/Integration/Context menus items" dialog lets
      you to control processing of SFX archives in context menus.
      For example, if you frequently right click ".exe" files
      on slow network disks, you can turn off "Network disks" options
      to minimize the delay before displaying the context menu.

   7. If you sort files by name in the file list in WinRAR shell,
      WinRAR will use the new logical file name sorting,
      same as in Windows Explorer, considering digits in file names
      by their numerical value. So files will be sorted as
      1.txt, 2.txt, 10.txt instead of previous 1.txt, 10.txt, 2.txt.
      This new sort behavior is available in Windows XP Service Pack 2
      and newer.
   
   8. Ctrl+W key combination can be used to close the main WinRAR window
      also as WinRAR viewer windows. "View as Windows text" shortcut
      in WinRAR viewer changed from Ctrl+W to Ctrl+I.
   
   9. New command line switch -r- disables recursion completely.
      So 'rar a -r- arc dirname' command will add only the empty
      dirname folder and ignore its contents. By default, if dirname
      does not include wildcards, RAR adds its contents even if
      -r switch is not specified.

  10. If used when extracting, the new command line switch -ai forces
      RAR to ignore file attributes. When using this switch,
      extracted files will always have attributes assigned by
      operating system to a newly created file by default.

  11. If output file name is not specified in "cw" command, console RAR
      will send comment data to stdout.

  12. When compressing stdin data with -si[name] switch, RAR sets 
      modification time of archived entry to current system time.
      Previous RAR versions did not fill this field, resulting in
      meaningless modification time for stdin.

  13. Message displayed when you place the mouse cursor on WinRAR
      tray icon includes the archive name now. Previously only
      time left and total percent were displayed for archiving operations.
  
  14. New 'Shutdown' variable in 'SoftwareWinRARPolicy' registry key
      allows to disable "Turn PC off when done" option for security reasons.
      Read "Configuration settings/Registry variables" for more details.

  15. Better shell extension performance. Now WinRAR context menu will be
      more responsive when working with thousands of selected files.

  16. Improved compatibility with high DPI Windows display mode.

  17. Bugs fixed:

      a) WinRAR could fail to open tar or tar.gz archive if such archive
         contained a file larger than 8 GB;
      
      b) WinRAR context menu did not work properly in Windows 7 beta
         if icons in context menus were enabled and user clicked
         a file inside of Windows 7 Library folder;
  
      c) previous WinRAR versions failed to rename files having 5 or more
         continuous spaces in the name. WinRAR shell does not display
         such spaces for safety reasons, because they can hide an actual
         file extension. But this security measure prevented the rename
         command to work properly.
