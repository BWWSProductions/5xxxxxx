It is a False positive "
,Death-Dude-72,2010-04-14T02:55Z,So how are we supposed to open a zipped program (this) if what we're downloading is something to do just that? X.x

You can use windows compression to unzip this folder, See I think of everything lol"
,iray8t,2010-05-03T09:44Z,Avast dosn't like this torrent either. Reports it as a trojan. Could be a false positive (as some keygens are) but I would prefer if anyone could confirm if this is a good torrent or not.
,klyppi123,2010-05-06T14:23Z,"The KeyGen is not a virus. I have tested it, and I didn't get any. It's the best keygenerator I have ever used. May someone tell me what the website to Fighing For Fun is?

I LOVE THEIR KEYGENS!"
