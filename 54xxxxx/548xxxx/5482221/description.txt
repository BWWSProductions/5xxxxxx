Ving Rhames stars in director Richard Dutcher's updating of the Lillith myth. According to Hebrew Mythology, Adam's first wife Lillith was banished from the Garden of Eden by God after her husband decried her lack of submission. In the wake of her open definace, Lillith was said to have become the mother of all succubi and the paramour of Satan.
