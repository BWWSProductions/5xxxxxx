Ditto on that.

What an utterly atrocious thing to wish upon a woman, the misogynist frackwit.

The laws of karma, maybe Lillith herself, will seek to teach that nobody a lesson.

Peace.

,hatebreeder80,2010-04-06T19:56Z,"I agree with scatattack.

How can you defend people who but bullshit comments calling a real movie fake?

Not only should GAZZA2008s mom die of cervical cancer, but on his way to see his family after that i hope he gets in a car accident and lives in agonizing pain for the rest of his bitch ass life.

Same goes for all you spammers too. I fucking hate every one of you."

,tenbob7,2010-04-09T18:59Z,"some ppl really need to chill out with the offensive comments! whats the point? its the download / movie / quality that counts after all is it not?  thats what its all about - not insulting ppl, fucking dumb and embarresing...
good people put a lot of effort into making this shit available, even if its shit. 
keep up the good work people"

,iray8t,2010-04-13T22:53Z,"Dunno if you ever noticed, but when aXXo was 'alive' her uploaded all kinds of stuff. They were'nt always 'good' movies bt they were always the *real thing*.
Now, aXXo is no longer. Praise be to raymondhome. For the simple reason that *all* of his stuf is also the *real thing*!
You like it or you don't. That's not the point. This man has a green skull and crossbones and it is most deserved. He walks in the best tradition of aXXo (who knows? maybe he *is* aXXo.)
The piont is that when *he* upload something, is is what he says it is. No bullshit.
In a world absolutely full of bullshit, we should be grateful to a person of truth... in this pirate world."
,iray8t,2010-04-13T22:56Z,And sorry for the typos. you get my point!

I recommend always that extra care is taken in spelling correctly the word 'intelligence'.  Such a mistake and one's argument is rendered most assuredly moot."
,GAZZA2008,2010-04-20T01:36Z,"I searched for evil angel and downloaded shutter island like i said stated above, and i usually download from raymond, which is usually 100% real films, i still dont know if this is real evil angel or shutter island, but i downloaded shutter island from some one, i just dont get all this hate comments to me all of a sudden?
and b.t.w. evil angel is a good film 10/10 cant wait for follow up.
p.s. keep up the good work raymond :o)"
