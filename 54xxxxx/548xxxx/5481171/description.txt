A great middle match up, ranked 11th vs ranked 14th. Holly heart is strong, very strong and is ranked 11th. She has Tag Team experience and is looking for her first win over a lesser ranked opponent. 

Mellanie had her first win against a new rookie, and now faces a higher ranked opponent. With a win she can jump up 3 ranks. This match up is a battle of rookies, who has learned more, who wants this win? 

Great non-scripted action as both these welterweights battle to see who gets to fuck who! With the loser getting humiliated and fucked!
