[T],g-roid,2010-04-15T04:06Z,And this works how? Double-clicking does nothing.
[T],chuckie6,2010-04-15T20:14Z,"g-roid have you changed permissions? 
This keygen will not work unless you do so by changing them in Terminal. If you are not happy using Terminal then BatchMod will be an easier option.
If you have done this I cannot help further, perhaps another PB user can assist."

What do I change permissions to? I have batchMod.

Thanks!"
