MC Lars' 2000 album Insectivorous, from when he was still known as Lars Horris.
I liked most of the tracks on the album; as such I have all but 10 and 11.

The 'Remedial Electronic Subversion' track (#15) was originally that song, about 7min30sec of silence, and then a live performance of the Insectivorous title track. Otherwise not editing the files, I removed the silent section and split the two.
