,cinesimon,2010-04-05T07:59Z,"Guys for those of you at 96.2% and no sign of the final bit coming through: the rar file is viewable unrar'd using Dziobas Player - a couple of bitsy bits, but all in all OK for those, like me, who don't want to wait! Cheers, hopefully see you you-know-where some time soonish!"
,cinesimon,2010-04-05T08:18Z,Sorry I mean NOT unrar'd.
