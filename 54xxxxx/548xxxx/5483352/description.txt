Synopsis :
By day, the Hongs are the perfect next-door family. Moo Hyuk (Lee Bum Soo) is a high school music teacher and his younger brother Chan Hyuk (Jang Ki Beom) is a happy-go-lucky student, both lovingly raised by model parents (Park In Hwan and Kim Ja Ok). By night, however, their true calling is revealed â€“ stealing. As the 18th generation descendant of Hong Gil Dong, Moo Hyuk is equipped with a full arsenal of combat and lock-picking skills to infiltrate the cash coffers of corrupt tycoons like flashy nemesis Lee Jung Min (Kim Su Ro). The Hong family business is in danger of being exposed when Moo Hyuk decides to propose to his girlfriend Yeon Hwa (Lee Si Young, Five Senses of Eros), whose brother (Sung Dong Il) is a prosecutor.
