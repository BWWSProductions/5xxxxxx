The members of a small opera troupe are forced to cope in the "real" world when their funds dry up in "One Foot off the Ground," a warmly observed ensembler that casts a quizzical eye on provincial life in contempo China. Tightly written, highly accessible sophomore outing by writer-director Chen Daming is given real flavor by its largely nonpro cast, and has none of the alienating artiness and anomie often seen in Mainland fest fare. On a level playing-field, this deserves Western distribution, with TV sales a bonus in Europe.

Pic has the same generosity toward its characters as the early films of Ang Lee ("Eat Drink Man Woman") and Taiwan pics of Sylvia Chang ("Tonight Nobody Goes Home,"). At the very least, on a technical and writing level, it shows Chen's first movie, caper-drama-romancer "Manhole" (2002), wasn't a one-off.

Pic was largely shot in (and is a gentle love letter to) Kaifeng, the helmer's own birthplace in Henan province, central China. It's based on real stories played out by the real people (with roles switched), though reworked into a commercial feature with no hint of documentary. Helmer -- who cameos as a film director in the opening sequence -- also trained in an opera school, and his familiarity with theatrical types and the greasepaint life infuses the script in an informal way.
