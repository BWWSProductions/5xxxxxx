THE BASICS
Jazz: The Basics gives a brief introduction to the history and
repertoire of jazz. It is ideal for students and interested listeners
who want to learn more about this important musical style.
The heart of the book traces jazzâ€™s growth from its folk origins
through early recordings and New Orleans stars, the big-band
and swing era, bebop, cool jazz and third stream, avant-garde,
jazz-rock, the neo-conservative movement of the 1980s, and the
polystylism of the 1990s.
Key fi gures from each era including: Louis Armstrong, Benny
Goodman, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Wynton Marsalis
are highlighted along with classic works. A list of recommended
recordings highlights essential listening for anyone who wants
to learn more about jazz.
Jazz: The Basics is an excellent introduction to the players, the
music, and the styles that make jazz an enduring and well-loved
musical style.
