GEORDIE
Another effective collaboration between Sim and director Frank Launder, Geordie (also known as Wee Geordie) is a heart-warming Highland drama adapted from the novel by David Walker.
A slight of frame and puny gamekeeper's son named Geordie (Paul Young) grows sick and tired of being picked on and decides to answer a Charles Atlas-style bodybuilding ad. Flash forward several years and Geordie is now a strapping, muscle-bound, Olympic champ (now portrayed by Bill Travers). Evidently his muscles have spread to his head, for Geordie sees no need for emotional fulfilment, and alienates his girlfriend (Norah Gorsen) on the road to becoming the top-ranked hammer thrower at the Highland Games and the UK representative at the Melbourne Olympics. When Geordie finally falls in love again, it is with towering shot-putter Helga (Doris Goddard) - the first woman ever able to best him on the athletic field.
Sim, unsurprisingly manages to quietly steal the film as the Laird for whom Geordie's father works as a gamekeeper.
