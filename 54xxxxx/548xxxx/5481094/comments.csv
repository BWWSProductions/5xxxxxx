[T],renman,2010-04-08T11:29Z,Your very welcome
,PiraatBae,2011-04-22T03:59Z,"Thanks for the upload, but like your other Sim movies I've downloaded the audio goes out of sync.  At around the 26:40 mark in this upload, there is a slight jump in the video and after that point the audio is off.  Tested on various players.  At least with VLC one can adjust the audio/video synchronization, but this is bothersome.

The other uploads (that I've downloaded) suffer the same at various points, the video has a jump but the audio doesn't which puts them out of sync for the rest of the film."
,eXpressio,2011-08-04T22:54Z,"Thanks for these release. My dad watch this movie when he was a kid, and now he would be really happy rewatch this again. 
It will be very good, if it had english subtitles. If someone knows where to find one - please tell me.

p.s. I seed it 15x in order to express my gratitude. "
