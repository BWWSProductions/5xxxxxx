    Simon Reeve continues his epic journey around the world    
    following the Tropic of Cancer, the northern border of    
    the tropics region.                                      
                                                              
    In India, Simon's journey takes him from the coast of      
    Gujarat in the west to Kolkata in the east. Along the     
    way he spots the shy and beautiful Indian wild ass,      
    learns of the violence between Hindus and Muslims in      
    Gandhi's home city of Ahmedebad and visits the site of     
    one of the world's worst industrial accidents in Bhopal   
    where people still claim to be suffering from chemical   
    spills.                                                   
                                                               
    In the setting for Kipling's Jungle Book, Simon bathes    
    an elephant and in Kolkata he ponders a new car that is  
    so affordable that it could add to the city's already     
    unbelievable congestion.
