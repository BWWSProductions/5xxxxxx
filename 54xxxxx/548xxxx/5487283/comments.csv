I have tried in VLC, WMP, MPC and mplayer (PC) and such tiny-tawny encoding even profits from over-excessive post-processing of VLC playback engine. Maybe you should hook up graphic card and TV (if GCard has TVout).

@sherynoshka: Thanks. Lately you become like regular visitor. Look forward to see you more often."
