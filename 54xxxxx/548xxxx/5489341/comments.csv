,illiria,2010-04-15T12:41Z,"I alone have uploaded 7 gigabytes, no comments say it's not working, so I assume it works for everyone. Good, I haven't had the change to do a thorough testing."
,bruterune,2010-04-24T18:09Z,"Works like a charm!
It also works with the skidrow version of dragon age, as thats the one i'm using.
Thanks for uploading this, i'll be seeding"

You do not ""open"" the files. In order to install the DLC, go to your ""game folder -> Bin"". Once there, launch ""daupdater.exe"" file, and click ""Select DAZIPs"". Then navigate to my files, add them to the list, and click ""Install"".

Thats how it works with all the DLCs.

I'm glad it works, enjoy."
,xf0rg0tt3nx,2010-05-07T07:05Z,"I see where you gave instructions on how to get the file to work, however I can't find where the daupdater.exe file is even located. I don't know where this ""game folder - Bin"" is either. Little help? Any advice would be appreciated."
,illiria,2010-05-07T11:56Z,"@ xf0rg0tt3nx


Sorry, messed up a bit. Not ""bin"", but ""binship"". You could have just used search for an EXE file.

The path should be:

C:\Program Files\Dragon Age\binship\daupdater.exe"
,xf0rg0tt3nx,2010-05-08T03:05Z,"I can't seem to find a binship folder, and I searched for the daupdater.exe file and had no result. Is there something I'm doing wrong? >_O"

If you do not have this file, then either your game installation is corrupted/incomplete, or you have downloaded a bad game rip from somewhere. I advise you to get a normal copy of the game and make a clean install of it. Bin or Binship folder has to be there, just as file daupdater.exe.
Frankly, I think you must be doing some wrong search, becaue if Bin/Binship folder didn't exit, the game would not launch at all.

Just go to where the game EXEcutable is (daorigins.exe) - daupdater will be there too. Check where game shortcut point to, and go there."

,Anhamirak,2012-01-03T12:23Z,Torrent works perfectly. Don't listen to the idiots who can't read installation instructions and don't realize the bug with loading Return to Ostagar content is random and not related to the quality of the torrent.
