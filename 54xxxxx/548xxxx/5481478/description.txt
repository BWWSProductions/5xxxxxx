Lighthouse Inn / John Stone Tavern

The team investigates The Lighthouse Inn in New London, Conn., which is reported to be haunted by the ghost of a bride who fell down a flight of stairs on her wedding day in 1930. Drops in temperature are recorded, and Steve feels someone touch him on his back when no one else is nearby. They then travel to Ashland, Mass. to a pub called Stone's Public House, formerly The Railroad House. Here, a little girl died after being hit by a train. Glasses have been known to fly off the shelves, lights turn themselves on, and a number of other occurrences have been documented.
