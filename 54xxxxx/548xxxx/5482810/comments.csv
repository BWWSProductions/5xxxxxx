[V],twentyforty,2010-04-06T08:58Z,"@tyrone69 : 24 is a pinnacle of action TV series, even if at least 3 seasons were ""not on the level"". However, I fully understand the depletion of the writers and producers - number of villains is VERY limited indeed. In James Bond movies in '60ies and '70ies villains have strong German accent, later Russian. In 24 we can choose between Russian mobs, Arab terrorists and Chinese noodles... somehow - predictable. Limited. Maybe Aliens would be villains next season and - we would get a crossbreed of Vee and 24... Sometimes is the best to stop and went legend..."
