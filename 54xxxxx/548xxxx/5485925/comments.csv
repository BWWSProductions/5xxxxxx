,pt.caesar,2010-04-08T19:12Z,Is this a THEATRICAL CUT or DIRECTOR'S CUT or EXTENDED EDITION?
,pt.caesar,2010-04-09T10:19Z,"Thanks for your answer, angel!"
,sp-laa,2010-04-09T23:43Z,"Stupid 1920*794 resolution! Who of you has 21:9 TV screen? I guess nobody. So why they make BluRay films in such. It's made for cinemas only not homes. Although I've got fullhd TV I hate watching movies with black strips or zooming and cutting sides. I'll wait for 16:9, for normal people."
,psychoacer,2010-04-11T08:41Z,The movie was never created in a 16:9 aspect ratio so your going to be waiting forever. This movie will always have black bars. The 1.85.1 aspect ratio this movie has is pretty standard for epic movies like this. The reason you see an odd resolution is because the Blu Ray doesn't encode the black bars. The Tv can easily identify the aspect ratio and will keep everything correct. So if you want it at 1920x1080 you can get a program that can probably add the black bars cause that's all your missing from the image.

[V],poppedtart,2010-04-14T19:21Z,there will never be a 16:9 version unless someone crops the original and zooms it.  or you could press the zoom button on your remote.
