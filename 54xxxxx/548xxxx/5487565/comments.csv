,4rror,2010-04-11T17:18Z,"I'm not certain that Windows 98 was ever available from floppies; reading mixed reports around the web, but I'm hunting around for you and will post back with my results.

If at all possible, consider swapping out the harddisk to another machine to load the installation files onto it, and use a regular Windows 98 bootdisk to start the installation."
,4rror,2010-04-11T18:28Z,"I does seem to have existed, but I've been unable to find it. If you do manage, please post back here.
I'd love to add it to my collection!
Cheers and good luck."
