[T],ctang,2010-04-06T07:10Z,which Fantasia is better 1999 or 1940...i havent seen either of them and was just curious
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-06T14:13Z,Hey Bro. I love Fantasia 2000 but Fantasia the original is also a timeless classic with Mickey and the magic broom. They are both 2 very different movies with amazing pieces. 2000 obviously has more updated animation so its a bit more appealing. 
[T],ctang,2010-04-06T18:10Z,gotta love the classics tho
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-06T19:11Z,"No Doubt. I'm putting up some more classic movies tonight such as Gladiator, ET, Platoon and possibly a couple others if I have the time:)"
