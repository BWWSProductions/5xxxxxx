Release Notes:
--------
More varied than Peace Machine, and overall more sophisticated and more polished
in terms of songwriting, sonics and performance, INNEREVOLUTION is a stylish,
engaging and thrilling album that should bring Philip Sayce to the attention of
a bigger and wider audience.

Thereâ€™s the driving, exhilarating opener Changes, with its guitar-motif nods to
Jimi and The Beatles; the broken-heart questioning of Are You Ready, and the
thrown-it-all-away regret of the pulsing Bitter Monday. The funked-up, get-down
Little Miss America, on which Sayce pushes his voice to the edge, and at the
other end of the intensity scale is a diamond among other gems on the album:
Daydream Tonight, a mid-tempo, slow-burning ballad delivered with passion and
giving off a hint of the piquancy of some of a young Lenny Kravitzâ€™s finest,
most soulful moments. The album also includes a cover of the Automatic Man song
My Pearl. â€œI just love the song,â€ Sayce enthuses. â€œIt's an amazing love song,
but it's really tuff. It makes me smile â€“ and my lady too. I wanted to bring my
love of funk and soul to this track, and it's so much fun to play. It's
strangely obscure, but hopefully not for long if we have anything to do with
it!â€

With Peace Machine and now INNEREVOLUTION, Philip Sayce continues to write his
own chapter in the long and continuing history of popular music. And itâ€™s clear
that this gifted young musician has many more pages yet to write.
