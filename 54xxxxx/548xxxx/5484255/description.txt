    Raymond uses two staple ingredients with infinite uses     
    - eggs and cheese. He kicks off with a classic omelette   
    made perfectly thanks to a secret technique.             
                                                              
    The perfect sabayon is key to any cooks repertoire and     
    this version makes a frozen parfait before Raymond        
    returns home for a Maman Blanc classic, Floating         
    Islands, clouds of meringue sitting atop a vanilla        
    cream and covered with a chewy caramel sauce.              
                                                              
    Raymond's next recipe requires the best of cheeses and   
    he is brought a selection by award winning cheesemonger   
    Patricia Michelson. A fine Comte from his home region      
    in eastern France goes to making a family style souffle   
    guaranteed to rise to the occasion.                      
                                                              
    For his finale a greengage casoulette is made from         
    praline and topped with meringue and sabayon. Along the   
    way, Raymond visits his old friend Eric Charriaux at     
    his London fromagerie where they each choose their        
    perfect cheese boards to enjoy at the end of a meal.
