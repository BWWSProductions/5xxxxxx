[V],neon,2010-04-08T21:04Z,its not seeding....go to your utorrent.....highlight this upload....right click.....up comes a list....press force start on that list...should work now...good luck bud :o)
[V],mirrormaster82,2010-04-08T21:22Z,"The same thing was happening when I tried to upload x-force 25,I had same problems,and the next day when I opened piratebay I saw there were 90 people who were seeding it...and I have done all what you said to me catsout,but I can`t see any progress..."
[V],mirrormaster82,2010-04-08T21:24Z,Catsout:Any words of advice besides this?
[V],neon,2010-04-08T21:50Z,seeding now mate
,precroy1,2010-04-09T00:22Z,"No, it's not.  Does your computer run on magic or something?"
[V],mirrormaster82,2010-04-09T00:43Z,"Something like that,and my upload connection is kinda shitty these days,so take it or leave it..."
,precroy1,2010-04-09T04:32Z,"No, no, I was talking to the guy that said it was seeding.  This stuff's hit or miss, no worries, what'd it cost me?"
,doandroidsdreamofelectric,2010-04-09T05:03Z,"actually  a seeder did show up earlier but its now gone,stick with it mirrormaster"
[V],neon,2010-04-09T10:56Z,"there was a seeder before i went to work,maybe adding more trackers would help
