,Th3_Raging_Bull,2010-10-28T06:21Z,LIMEWIRE IS NO MORE!
,77bigmac77,2010-10-28T16:48Z,isn't limewire getting shut down? time to lol at all the people who actually paid for PRO.
,distortedlife55,2010-10-30T18:38Z,will be useless now!
,mikegator,2010-11-01T03:31Z,"it's too bad LimeWire got shut down..anyone know of any other options? I tried iMesh, but the folder structure when it saves shit drives me nuts, plus it doesn't have the vast selection LimeWire had."
,martian_neighbour,2010-11-03T06:22Z,bye2x limerwire!! Uncle Sam finally got your ass... fuck
,Cody472,2010-11-06T07:44Z,Limewire got shut down.
,ReBeLi0uS1,2010-11-08T17:44Z,"Versions of LimeWire prior to 5.5.11 can still connect to the Gnutella network and users of these versions are still able to download files, even though a message is displayed concerning the injunction during the startup process of the software. LimeWire versions 5.5.11 and newer feature an auto-update feature that allowed Lime Wire LLC to disable newer versions of the LimeWire software. Older versions of LimeWire prior to version 5.5.11 however do not include the auto-update feature and are still fully functional."
,makkaspliff,2010-11-18T00:21Z,"limewire shutdown huh........maybe thats why I can't get this torrent or any other limewire torrent to actually connect when I've installed them. ChittChatto, I know your torrents are good, EXCELLENT in fact, First, I got the limewire one you put up here a few days ago and when that no-go I tried some others of yours and other uploaders, same shit...no connect. Now I know why, I guess."
,Mavese,2010-12-29T08:32Z,Try Frostwire people! its basicly a clone of limewire and it's free just like limewire was.
,thebigmbg,2010-12-31T23:46Z,"LimeWire 5.5.11 and newer have been disabled using a backdoor installed by the company. However, version 5.5.10 and all prior versions of LimeWire remain fully functional and cannot be disabled unless a user upgrades to one of the newer versions. So this one is 5.5.8 it should work"
,pimpmobile,2011-04-23T02:47Z,thebigmbg you are full of CRAP the earlier versions are not working either asshole!
[V],RR-NE,2011-04-28T11:07Z,"i cant believe people are still seeding this, its DEAD"
,liblead,2011-09-10T03:56Z,"Well, its finally dead here too. bout time."
