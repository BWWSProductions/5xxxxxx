
This has some of the "prettiest" songs they have ever done (second only to Heyday). American critics often compare sound to early R.E.M., but these guys were way ahead in the guitar artistry department. There are gorgeous, dreamy tunes here, notably "No Explanation," "A Month of Sundays," and "Shadow Cabinet." Also present is easily the Church's worst song ever, "Maybe These Boys." What was Steve Kilbey thinking? And first song "Constant in Opal" seems like it was created solely to give life to that dull pun. "Violet Town" is somewhat attractive, but marred by that harsh snare shot beat that compromised some of the tracks on the previous album, Seance. 

The closing instrumental title track is depressing, but hints at future direction of the band. Oh, and Marty Willson-Piper gets a pair of somewhat awkward but refreshing efforts in with "Volumes" and "10,000 Miles."

This album was basically strung together from two previous e.p. releases (Persia and Remote Luxury), which isn't surprising given the lack of cohesion of the record. Highly uneven, but instrumental in getting the Church more airplay on American college radio, paving the way for their Starfish breakthrough. And it is their first album to really approach excellence in a sublime way - in spots.
