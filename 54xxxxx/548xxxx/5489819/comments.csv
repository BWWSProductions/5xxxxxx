I downloaded the movie then I opened it through quick player, it was black screen and running for 5 second then it stopped itself automatically... May be or may be not, it wasn't uploaded properly by you or sometimes yours or mine internet had a problem... I downloaded your movie through my macbook and I usually download movies and dramas through my macbook... It works well... I hope you will do upload again... Is this video formated on DIVX codec or you are using PAL or NTSF color format... Kindly check your video's property for me, please!!!"
