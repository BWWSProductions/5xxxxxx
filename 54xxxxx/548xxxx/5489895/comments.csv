This game is good, is like mass effect and lost planet on the same time."

,moldaviax,2010-04-15T23:38Z,shaffu007:  there is no need to call people names and type like a 5 year old.  Go learn how to type some English and be more polite if you expect someone to answer you.  Maybe you should go Google the game and see when it was released.  Also check the seeders and Quality levels before asking stupid questions.

,gusiskirby,2010-04-20T09:57Z,"@shaffu007 There's really no need to be such a douche. Nobody was being rude to you. It's not hard to figure out when a game was released.

Just like alexandre666, I'm having problems with mine too. It's goes to some menu after the first battle and the only thing you can do is restart. Is anyone else having this problem?"
,iamarobot,2010-04-27T03:56Z,"torrent works great. thanks for the upload.

the game is terrible though, very low-budget, very buggy, and generally terrible. normally, I would seed for a week or two, but this game is so terrible I have to protest it's very existence."
,maxdesolate,2010-05-14T22:01Z,"hey guys,  just started dling it. anyone know if it works well without any audio problems on servicepack 3? gonna seed for long if it does."
