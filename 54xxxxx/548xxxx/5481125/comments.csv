[V],globeplus,2010-04-07T23:07Z,"THE USERS WITH DIFFICULTIES MUSR READ CAREFUL THE INSTRUCTIONS.TXT AND GOOD LUCK .

I am writing this comment to reccomend to the users of this file the 0.4.1 server with new values.dbf that is available now on new game in this site , you donÂ´t need the new version independtly if you want to use it but substitute the current values.dbf with 6 kb in the file (it is a safe one to start the first missions) for the one available in the 0.4.1 server with 172 kb , backup the inicial one if you want but basically just substitute for this new one , happy gaming everyone and go playing with this new one far as possible then search for new values.dbf that can possibilitate still progressing inside the game . thank you ."

,Redundantos,2010-04-17T02:33Z,"I have a solution for those who have error
""unable to find ubisoft game launcher"".
You just have to rename registry entry
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\UBISOFT\Ubisoft Game Launcher
to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\UBISOFT\Launcher
and the game becomes fully playable.
I spent hours to figure out that. What a stupid fuck this globe@ to rename a default path?"
,Redundantos,2010-04-17T02:39Z,"The videos are highly and noticeably downgraded (the video folder is 153 mb, though I don't know the original size), but there are nothing really special in them."

Try to download new crack
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5490537/Assassins_Creed_2_The_Final_Offline_Server_Crack_100_
and follow the instructions carfully."
,khalids19,2010-04-18T11:33Z,Listen i have used the new crack and used server0.44 by dormine but when i use that the Launcher updates it self and if i cancel the update it wont run and if i disconnect my internet for it not to get updated it says that i need an internet connection for it to connect to ubisofts master servers and if it gets updated it asks for a product key or it says incorrect username and pasword can u help me?
,Redundantos,2010-04-18T14:42Z,"khalids19
I guess you just didn't followed the instructions carefully. Use autocrack, replace game launcher vith cracked one, enter any product key if asked.
Launch game from ""Play Assassin's Creed II"" shortcut from desktop. I guess that's all. Worked for me."
,khalids19,2010-04-18T18:18Z,i really followed everypiece of instruction and if i use the auto crack i swear it still doesnt work at all! it says that i need an internet connection to connect to ubisoft master servers!
