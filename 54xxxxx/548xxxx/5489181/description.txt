Verve is continually resorting and repackaging their artists' tracks and albums and Charlie Parker is no exception. Here we find various quintets led by the alto sax giant in the early '50s. 

This same work is available on other compilations and one might do well to check out other Verve compilations to compare track listings, cover, liner notes, and more. 

That said, at over 20 tracks, this is a fine place to hear a nice cross section of Parker's bop stylings.
