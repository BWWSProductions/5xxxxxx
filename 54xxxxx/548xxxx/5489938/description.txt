Dj Screw Presents Chapter 223: SU4C - Soldiers United For Cash


Houston-based Dirty South DJ, best known for his eponymous "Chopped and Screwed" mixtapes, where he would slow down records to half their normal speed in order to complement the effect of being really high on lean -- codeine cough syrup mixed with soda. In the late 1990s, DJ Screw made hundreds of mixtapes using this technique, selling them out of the trunk of his car until demand grew so large that he opened a shop. He gained a loyal following in his hometown and abroad, only to die of a heart attack (reportedly his fifth) after overdosing on his muse at his studio.
