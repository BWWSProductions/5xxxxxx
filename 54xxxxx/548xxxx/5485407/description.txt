You are responsible for the streets and roads in your
city. With so many people in a city, there is always the
need for new living space, which has to be opened up
with roads. In addition, the residents ask here and
there for wider and faster roads. Under certain
circumstances you get contracts for plaster work, the
creation of pedestrian and bike paths, or the
replacement of gas, water and power lines in existing
roads.

For a realistic representation, a 3D graphics engine is
used, which represents the events at any time clearly
and realistically. Step by step the player gains
experience and thus more extensive special orders. A
level is considered to be solved, if within the
specified time, the given tasks have been fulfilled. But
be careful, unpredictable events always affect the
current happenings, such as:

* Preferable emergency orders, such as
conduction breaks
* Weather conditions such as wind, ice and rain
* Unpredictable obstacles  Technical defects
* Detailed scenery in 3D graphics
* Intriguing, ongoing story
* Weather effects, day / night shift
* Various tasks
* Long lasting fun factor
* Free choice of the level, once you have
accomplished all tasks
* Extensive background information
* Intuitive control via keyboard and mouse
