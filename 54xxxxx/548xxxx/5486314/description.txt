Jimmy Page and Friends â€“ Wailing Sounds (2006)


Includes Lord Sutch & Heavy Friends (1970) + six tracks from the 1968 sessions for Keith De Groot's debut album.




Jimmy Page needs little introduction - England's #1 session player in the '60s, major component of The Yardbirds, driving force of the world's heaviest and, some would say, best band - Led Zeppelin. 



In 1970, Page recorded Lord Sutch & Heavy Friends, replicated in its entirety here and featuring a who's-who of Rock royalty - fellow Led Zeps John Paul Jones and John Bonham, guitar genius Jeff Beck, Noel Redding on bass and Nicky Hopkins on piano: a gloriously insane jam session that has achieved legendary status. 


Also included are six tracks from the 1968 sessions for Keith De Groot's debut album, with Page and John Paul Jones among the backing musicians. A fascinating precursor to Zeppelin and highly collectable material.

Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends  was named in a 1998 BBC poll as the worst album of all time, a status it also held in Colin Larkin's book The Top 1000 Albums of All Time, despite the fact that Jimmy Page, John Bonham, Jeff Beck, Noel Redding and Nicky Hopkins performed on it and helped write it.
