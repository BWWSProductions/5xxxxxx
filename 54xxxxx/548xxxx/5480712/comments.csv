One question, why do most of the songs on this custom not have star power? I mean, I know they're harder without SP, but damn I need em to get through the hard parts! lol. Thanks a lot man for standing up to freedom of speech. Thanks so much for the torrents."

Great game dude! Great job. I didn't know if it was worth downloading cause I wasn't sure about gameplay, but it was great! Real pro job. Congrats!
