Welcome to DC++

DC++ announces the freedom to share!
DC++ is an open source client for Windows for the Direct Connect network.
Direct Connect allows you to share files over the Internet without restrictions or limits. The client is completely free of advertisements and has a nice, easy to use interface. Firewall and router support is integrated and it is easy and convenient to use functionality like multi-hub connections, auto-connections and resuming of downloads.


First time user?

DC++ is a highly ranked piece of software among the projects hosted at Sourceforge. With more than fifty million downloads, new users continue to find benefits from the software every day.


Overview

DC++ is a client for the Direct Connect file sharing network.
The Direct Connect network is a decentralized network, made up of individual servers (hubs) that users join to share files with other members on that hub.
Each hub is individually run by a fellow user of the Direct Connect network, and may have certain themes to the content on the hub.
Hub owners set up rules to regulate their hub as they see fit.
