,mrhozer,2010-04-21T01:21Z,"Thanks! good upload. Wow this show really went downhill i'm glad they decided to not do it anymore. All the shows this season were about the family drama and Paul Sr talking about himself and it really shows how greedy and selfish he is. Paul Jr. trying to promote his ""design"" business (which so far has been nothing but one stupid crown logo, wow he is really a ""designer"") Mikey failing at everything he's ever done in his life, the 5 or so employees left at the multi million dollar bike garage just screwing around all day, and 5 minutes of attempting to build a pre-manufactured bike. Boring! It's always been just a big advertisement for the theme company, they could care less about the actual bike."
