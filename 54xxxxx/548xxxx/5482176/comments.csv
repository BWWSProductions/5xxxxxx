,the_shroud,2010-04-06T08:17Z,"Thanks 20-40 for directing me to Jon's msgs. 
Been so tied up with tenders....ok i admit, with my new gadgets too. Long story...
On Sat I bought 400gb hdd for ?40, casing for ?9 and ?30 for a HDMI Media Player. Was so pleased with myself, thought I had a good deal.
Went home, hooked it up and it played all the vid files except for the ones from our beloved 2040 in mp4. I can't have that...
Sunday, I went back there to return it and tested the players from all other brands. None of them could play mp4 files except the more expensive one. Phantom. So I had to top up another ?56! This player can house the HDD too but it has to be reformated. So I had to go home and back up all the files i just transfered the day before and install into the Phantom. Found out player did not supply HDMI cable...!
Monday, had to go back there to return the HDD casing and buy HDMI cable. Only last night I finally got to enjoy it with the new Doctor Who :D"
,the_shroud,2010-04-06T08:19Z,It seems the Euro sign doesn't come out. It only shows as ?
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-06T10:13Z,"@the_shroud: Glad you done it. Listen, if you got HornetTek Phantom ('cause many Phantoms are out there) you have bought one of the best players around. For 95 bucks only two years back one can get nothing like that, only dream about. 
I just hope that he will last long enough and provide to your family and to you multi-95bucks worth of pleasure and enjoyment."
,the_shroud,2010-04-06T12:02Z,"Thx, just checked the manual. It says HornetTek Phantom alright. Hope it lasts long too. 
Btw, your DWho encode i watched last night on Samsung 37"" LD was so damn clear. Maybe I've never experienced Full HD but this is bloody good enough 4 me."
,FlicksTube,2010-04-06T16:25Z,"Amazing...Amazing...Amazing!!!!!!!

I had no idea the film would be 1 hr 28 mins long. And the quality, even on my 19"" LCD (from my regular viewing distance) is greatt! Way more than can be EVER expected from this size!

You're awesome, Dude!!! Just awesome!!!

Just to let u know.. appreciate the talk show pack as well!! 88 mins for three whole shows!!!!! WOW!!! 

You Rock!!!"
,FlicksTube,2010-04-06T16:25Z,"that would be 88 mb*

My bad,..

thanks again!!!!!!!!!!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-06T17:45Z,"@the_shroud: Mainly because of your nice words about, Dr. Who is back. See you on Sunday morning."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-06T18:38Z,"@FlicksTube: It's loose continuation of [PMC] encodings back in 2000-2002. Back then was no XviD encodings in today's volume, and PoorMenChoice was mpg in VCD format, with a goal ""one-movie-on-one-CD"". Then XviD has taken over.
Nowadays, I am so pissed about misuse of whole H264 idea by spoiled brats who (mis)use avc/x264 as modern replacement of XviD, and nothing more.
No one who knows anything about x264 and XviD internals cannot compare these two in general and certainly cannot compare two completely decoding engines, one of modern pixel manipulations/resize of H264 and DECADE old, not-touched-since-then XviD's.
That's why I do not like morons who came here to scream ""IT'S ONLY 480x272 - IT BELONGS TO HANDHELDS!"".
Nope, it does not. Simple as that.
But...
Did you ever downloaded unwatchable CAM? I did. Now - read the number of seeders of such crappy torrents/encodings... thusends... or hundredths. Zillions of terabytes burned, wasted and bandwidth (paid by someone) has been blown away.
I struggle two years with H264 encodings with maybe few dozen seeders, hundredths of accolades about quality and only few critiques.
Also - frankly - maybe few movies and shows does deserve good picture and big file-size. 98% are come-and-goers, something people delete anyway after few days or forget about it after week or month or  two."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-06T18:46Z,"Err:
completely decoding engines = completely different decoding engines

thusends = thousands

Sorry."
,htctouch,2010-04-06T19:13Z,"ITS AWSM MANNN ..

U CAN REALY USE THIS PROFILE/FORMAT FOR DRAMA MOVIES

BECAUSE THOSE MOVIES DOESNT NEED HIGH RESOLUTION OR CRYSTALIZED SOUND

THIS IS REALY REALY GOOD FOR DRAMA MOVIES. AWSM WORK . AWSM EXPERIMENT.

JUST WOW"
,lilars26,2010-04-06T20:54Z,"Well,I watched the whole movie and really enjoyed the quality.It does show that size isn't everything.Works fine with Convertx>dvd.Thanks for the education."
,the_shroud,2010-04-07T01:44Z,"X-D Thank you, X-D Thank you, X-D Thank you. 
C U on Sunday morning. Will of course seed as much as n as long as I can. Still seeding 1st ep. And b4 sunrise/sunset too (feel kinda responsible for it since I requested it)"
,FlicksTube,2010-04-07T06:24Z,"@2040:
Well, I started using/tweaking h264 for small size movie as well. But ya, like u said, the lack of seeders to even movies that weren't readily available on net were very disappointing, the reason why I stopped uploading at all!@ 

It certainly pissed me off when I see as barely watchable/unwatchable cams getting seeders of upto thousands while we struggle to keep our quality AND small sized torrents alive. 

Of course few movies deserve as decent size, maybe like as Watchmen, which u uploaded ion 700 mb, I guess.. but for regular TV stuff that we probably will delete after as couple of days anyways, it's such a waste of time and space!"
