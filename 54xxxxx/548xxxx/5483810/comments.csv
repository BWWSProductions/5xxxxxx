,ninjanutta,2010-04-06T21:51Z,this is the new system update that allows usb pendrive hdd upto 32gb to be used on a retail 360.also re-enables hdd installs on a banned 360.all good.dosent uncorrupt saves though but thats easily fixed anyway
,Strikefear13,2010-04-06T22:06Z,"Can anyone confirm this will legitimately reenable hdd installs?  I don't want to fuck anything up.  I can't imagine this is a feature of the update as is, so this is clearly a custom update."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-06T22:13Z,I have updated and it works. HD is unlocked again.
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-06T22:13Z,I tested on 2 xbox 360 and both HD was unlocked.
,ant19831983,2010-04-06T23:03Z,"My HD is unlocked, but my avatar has vanished."
,jaydon19,2010-04-06T23:12Z,"Yeah same here, My Hd is unlocked finally, but my avatar vanished 2, if i click on change avatar it asks for a live update, but my hd got unblocked so Yay!"
,scotty35,2010-04-06T23:14Z,"Yeah i've been waiting for somthing like this, i'm banned from live so who needs an avatar?
Is this an official update or is it a hack? who cares really it works great"
,epidemico616,2010-04-07T00:01Z,"so do i have to burn this to disk, or what? tnx"
,runtimmy,2010-04-07T00:13Z,Thanks dude it Works great KEEP it up
,ShinoBoy,2010-04-07T01:56Z,"Anyone know if DLC/Arcade games work if copied to a usb with this update?  Specifically, if we get 'em off TPB (like with a JTagged system)?  Probably a longshot...."
,ninjanutta,2010-04-07T03:53Z,"dlc and arcade games is a no.this is the official update,no hack.M.S allowed the hdd function to re enable,my guess is a law suit was looking bad for them so they acted quick.all updates have their own avatar update so i guess once this is on the official xbox.com for download then the full avatar extras will be avaliable too.probably tommorow or next day."
,Herz_F,2010-04-07T03:57Z,"I downloaded dash from official xbox site, and my avatars vanished too.
So, its normal,i guess."
,avvelito,2010-04-07T04:24Z,wtf is a pen drive ?
,ninjanutta,2010-04-07T07:33Z,how you manage to get from official site when its not up on there yet?
,ademirado,2010-04-07T09:41Z,Pen drive = usb memory stick.
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-07T11:28Z,"There is 2 ways to update it:

1. Burn it on a cd or dvd
2. Usb stick"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-07T11:40Z,"JUST A WARNING:

Do not apply this update on a JTAG console as it will blow the efuses and remove your homebrew "
,boystreet,2010-04-07T12:23Z,I should put the *.rar or the files in the *.rar to the pendrive?
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-07T12:25Z,unpack it and put the $Systemupdate$ folder in root of the stick/cd/dvd
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-07T12:28Z,"small guide

1. unpack it
2. Put the $Systemupdate$ folder in root of the stick/cd/dvd
3. insert stick/cd/dvd with the update
4. turn off xbox 360
5. turn on the xbox 360 again, and you will get a request asking if you want to update.

,boystreet,2010-04-07T13:05Z,thanks a lot Sunblock.
,scotty35,2010-04-07T14:56Z,"I don't think this has anything to do with lawsuits, it is for usb support so you can have up to 2x16gb usb pen drives inserted and use them to install games and use for save games, i don't think it's intended for banned consoles as you'd download it via live, this has obiously been leaked, but is official"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-07T15:09Z,"Dashboards can be dl from Xbox.com as well after sometime. Why do you think there is a option to update via cd/dvd/stick. If it was not intended for banned console then this makes no sense?. :D

They even have there own guide:

,Herz_F,2010-04-07T16:56Z,"ninjanutta - sorry, my mistake.
It was not official site."
,Vader--,2010-04-07T17:09Z,scotty35 pull your head out of your butt!
,scotty35,2010-04-07T17:16Z,"If you don't believe me google it, all information about it mentions nothing about reactivating hdd, and vader you only want me to get my head out of my butt cos you want to stick ur dick in"
,scotty35,2010-04-07T17:18Z,and i've followed the link and this update aint even available yet

,Strikefear13,2010-04-07T19:05Z,"When turning on your xbox, it applies the update.  Someone could have used a j-tagged 360 to grab the update then post it on here.  Isn't unreasonable even if it's not on the official site.  All I know is that it works, and I'm fine with that :D"
,Vader--,2010-04-07T19:16Z,"scotty35  YOUR LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACES , probably cause your head is still stuck."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-04-07T20:33Z,"what do it matter? Its comes from M$ and some one got it out from there HD or something. It works and thats the hole point?. M$ dont share there dash right away it will be shared later, But why wait?."
,pottlec,2010-04-08T00:06Z,"i have burn it cd and dvd it will not update 
it comes as mixed media disc"
,pottlec,2010-04-08T00:06Z,how do you put it on cd
,dncj,2010-04-08T02:52Z,"this uncriples the hdd on banned consoles,now its possible to install games on the hd or pen but  to play divx files you still have to connect to xbox live so to the banned consoloes its not possible to play files from your pen or hdd."
,CivicScootin,2010-04-08T08:45Z,"Confirmed working to unblock HDD support with both Game Saves & HDD Game Installs (DLC also confirmed working as long as the DLC was downloaded from live via the banned box before becoming banned - May work if re-signed as well however I have yet to re-sign any DLC as of yet to test)..

Aviator is working fine on my end - So I really do not see what others are having issues with..
(Note: I used a 20GB HDD that I swap with a non banned console - The updated profile may have something to do with the Aviator working on the banned console)

I sure am happy M$ fixed this issue as i was not looking forward to JTagin my system..
So thanks Microsoft for the fix!..

Also thank you Mr. Anonymous uploader for informing everyone that this update fixes the HDD issues!..

Later,
Civic/Scootin"
