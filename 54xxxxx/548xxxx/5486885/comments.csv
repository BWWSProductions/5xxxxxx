When I did, I realized it was about the tags. 

Huge THANK you for uploading this (and reading the comments) :)"
,BarrySoetoro,2010-04-08T23:27Z,"Also, if you could provide an alternative non-Fraunhofer IIS format, and rename the files so the hour number comes before the text (less scrolling on smaller mp3 player screens) that would be appreciated.








No, I'm not serious. :P"

@clevelandSteamingPile...
Not all freedom loving conservatives who listen to Rush live in the U.S., and not all are hillbillies, though I do admit to liking blue grass music. Now show us some more of your intelligent debating ability and spew some more  crap from your putrid hole."
