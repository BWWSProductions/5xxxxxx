I have tried a few of times to rip an iso, but never successfully. Do you know of a somewhat simple tutorial for an absolute newbie at this?

I should mention that I took out any subtitles here for optimizing space."
,mikexxxryan,2010-04-10T19:33Z,"Cadinot you don't say what OS you are using but if you want a nice AVI then use Handbrake v0.9.2 (not the latest release).  

You can then drag any AVI into Toast and it will burn to DVD as a DVD w/opening screen."
,mikexxxryan,2010-04-10T19:34Z,"Sorry, I should have said you can do the above on a Mac.

Also - thank YOU so much for this video.  Hitchcock is the best at what he does."
,mikexxxryan,2010-04-10T19:36Z,And let me say that on a Mac you can download any ISO and double click on it.  It opens and reveals the Video.TS file.  You can drag that Video.TS file directly into Toast and it will burn a DVD with opening title and subchapters.
