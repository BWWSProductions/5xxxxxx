utterly useless posting, but i think you knew this, renman, otherwise you could have mentioned that it's a massively cropped version."

While the theatrical release was 2.35:1, all DVD releases apart from the Region 2 Prism Leisure version are offered at 1.33:1 and all torrents here on Pirate Bay are from these 1.33:1 sources - as you know since you also commented there.  I would say that until someone does a rip from the Region 2 release (which is non-anamorphic and, reportedly, very poor quality), calling these uploads ""utterly useless"" is equally as useless.  While I always prefer OAR, being able to see the film, albeit in a cropped form, is better than not seeing it at all."
