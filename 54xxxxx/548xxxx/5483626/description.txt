    Story - it has one? Well, it s supposed to be an erotic comedy           
    smorgasbord of blackout gags inspired by goings on by the wacky          
    tenants of an apartment hotel. The overall production makes Ed Wood      
    seem like Stanley Kubrick. But remember there is at least one good       
    thing -- a tripod is used to steady the camera...most of the time. A     
    violation of the movie lemon law, or a cult classic? You be the          
    judge.
