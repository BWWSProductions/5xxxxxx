This is a complete discography, to the present, of the solo project of Robe. member Kyle Willey's Black Cinema from Columbus, Indiana. This is the second and final revision of this torrent. Sorry to any users who have tried to grab previous versions, computer problems corrupted several files. Enjoy! All MP3s are encoded to a high 320 KBS and are all copied from the original Master files. Even though some of these releases were on cassette, none of them are rips, they are all digital quality.
