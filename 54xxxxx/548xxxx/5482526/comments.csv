I'm actually going online and ordering this thing, for the first time in years.....after downloading it... they deserve it. 

I have almost a thousand albums that I bought through the last 20 years standing in my shelves, but in the last 3-4 years I've only downloaded. This will be my first CD bought in that time. 

Well worth the money to support this band!!!
