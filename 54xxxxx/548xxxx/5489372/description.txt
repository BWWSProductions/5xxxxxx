Richard Matheson's classic, thrilling story of a huge truck which plays deadly games with an innocent motorist

David Mann is a middle-aged businessman driving to an appointment in his Plymouth Valiant. On a two-lane highway in the California desert, he encounters a faded and grimy tanker truck, a Peterbilt 281, traveling slower than the speed limit and expelling thick plumes of diesel exhaust. Mann passes the unsightly truck which promptly roars past him and slows down. Mann passes the truck a second time and is startled when it issues a long air horn blast.

Mann soon finds himself in a bizarre cat-and-mouse game with the truck
