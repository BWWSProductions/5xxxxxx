Acclaimed singer-songwriter Tim Buckley incorporated jazz and psychedelia into his folk-styled songs, showing a far more experimental tendency than many of his contemporaries. However, this willingness to try new things alienated him from mainstream music listeners, and it wasn't until after his death that his musical legacy was fully appreciated. This is his debut LP, a '60s gem, and how it all started back in 1966. have fun!

Review by Richie Unterberger

Buckley's 1966 debut was the most straightforward and folk-rock-oriented of his albums. The material has a lyrical and melodic sophistication that was astounding for a 19-year-old.

The pretty, almost precious songs are complemented by appropriately baroque, psychedelic-tinged production. If there was a record that exemplified the '60s Elektra folk-rock sound, this may have been it, featuring production by Elektra owner Jac Holzman and Doors producer Paul Rothchild, Love and Doors engineer Bruce Botnick, and string arrangements by Jack Nitzsche. 

That's not to diminish the contributions of the band, which included his longtime lead guitarist Lee Underwood and Van Dyke Parks on keyboards.

Buckley was still firmly in the singer-songwriter camp on this album, showing only brief flashes of the experimental vocal flights, angst-ridden lyrics, and soul influences that would characterize much of his later work. It's not his most adventurous outing, but it's one of his most accessible, and retains a fragile beauty.
