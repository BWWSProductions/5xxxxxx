Works perfectly."

,zheka.,2010-04-26T05:17Z,"Hi dear,
First of all a lot of thanks for seeding Ford nav DVDs. Much appreciations.

I managed to download your 7P disk the one you claimed as 7D. A bit later 8P was downloaded as well. I need to update my friend's Lincoln Aviator 2004 and none of these disks worked. There's never ending message on the screen ""Reading DVD"" and no luck.
Any magic behind your disks to make them working ?"
,uploader55,2010-05-11T02:55Z,I have a 2003 lincoln navigator which is cd-rom based.  Is there any update I can get for that?  Anyway to burn just my area on a cd-rom?  Let me know. 
,bRitch022,2010-06-03T19:44Z,does anyone know where to find a navteq dvd for chrysler jeep dodge vehicles? maybe this one would be compatible with any luck?

Help Please"
,dyson77,2010-08-11T04:16Z,will this work with Chrysler
,theanarchist,2010-09-09T03:24Z,This works great! Much better map/road data. But I did notice that there are a lot less POI's. Tonnes of stores are missing that were in 7P. Very odd.
,txtp22925h,2010-10-16T16:36Z,"Thanks, works great."
,theanarchist,2010-11-22T08:52Z,Anyone got a hookup for 9P?
,kevind587,2011-01-05T01:41Z,Same issue for me - after I insert the disc I receive a never-ending message that says 'reading disc' but there is no activity in the dvd unit.  When I reinstall the original disc it almost immediately fires up the map.  Any ideas??
,tompic823,2011-03-13T20:27Z,Works great in my 2008 Lincoln MKX. Thanks!
,bullitt08,2011-11-29T23:11Z,"Please someone seed the .mds file for 7D, posted as 7P,
the disk won't work unless its burned using that key file.

On the issue of the never ending message ""reading Disk"" its because chances are it was burned without the .mds file."
,jdavis15,2011-12-01T05:48Z,Please seed .mds file for 7D.  Thank you
