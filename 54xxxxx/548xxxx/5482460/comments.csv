,lupo1954,2010-04-07T17:57Z,cannot extract all files - why did You zip it?
,thuerrsch,2010-04-07T22:44Z,"Thanks for this stunningly beautiful album! Do you happen to know why the enclosed track listing is somewhat different from that at discogs (http://www.discogs.com/Paul-Oakenfold-The-Goa-Mix/release/201325)?

For the future, *please* heed lupo1954's advice and don't zip and split your releases. TPB is not Rapidsh***, thank god. That said, 7z extracted everything just fine for me in Linux.
