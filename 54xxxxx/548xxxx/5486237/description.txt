This original short for 9 is a wordless little post-apocalyptic breath-taker that rightfully earned itself an Academy Award nomination in 2005. It was expanded through the support of a recognizable voice cast and producers like Tim Burton, his vision was well on its way to the big screen, and all things considered, it's a small wonder that this small wonder made it through the Hollywood machine with most (though not all) of its mystique intact...
