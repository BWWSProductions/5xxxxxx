,slats649,2010-04-09T19:17Z,"I'm new at this, the download has 3 exe files and a txt file with serial. Do I just run the exe files? In which order? After installation can you update the software?
Thank you."
,KaiScar,2010-04-20T07:46Z,"I keep getting ""No permissions to run application"" everytime I try to run an app. Any ideas?"
,KaiScar,2010-04-20T09:49Z,"nvm, this was a complete waste of time =["
,elises1turbo,2010-04-20T16:03Z,this one dont work
,RAMaikoe,2010-04-25T20:24Z,"Thanks for this upload.
Tested on XP & Win7 works great without any problems!"
,Tyler_Durden503,2010-05-01T07:33Z,"everything works for me, thanks....but the serial for soundsoap doesnt work. in search of one"
,dandubya,2010-05-05T04:18Z,"folks, you got to write more than ""it don't work""  others are reporting success, if you are looking for help, give some details :)"
,Jedibezy,2010-05-12T09:21Z,"It works just fine. The user who said they had no run permission, thats an error you get when running it out of sandbox. "
,Triple_Beam,2010-05-16T20:46Z,"i agree ""it don't work"" for me either.  i installed each exe.  1st content then pro then pro disc 2.  roxio creator 2010 home pro loads but no other apps load.  no other way to describe it.  i got windows 7"
,DMNKLR,2010-06-11T17:57Z,"It is a complete waste of time to bother with this.  To those who are also getting the ""No Permissions To Launch Application"" error message, if you do a Google search, nearly everyone is having the same issue.  Sonic doesn't have a viable working solution for it either.  I think this is the first time I'm considering switching to Nero, as even my Roxio 2009 won't run on Win7 x64."
,DMNKLR,2010-06-11T17:58Z,"Also, it is NOT an error for running an app ""out of sandbox"", what kind of retarded bogus-ness is that?"
,LH-TAIMI,2010-06-29T21:59Z,"so huge O,O damn!"
,LH-TAIMI,2010-06-30T12:18Z,"dont work, erros setup fails,!"
,crossfire6,2010-07-04T01:30Z,"NERO is much better anyway.  But don't bother with the Nero 10 torrents.  None have worked for me.  None.  And I haven't heard of one person yet who has actually said they have installed AND successfully used Nero 10 from these torrents.
Roxio is too bloated anyway...."
,farvamx31,2010-07-18T19:13Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!!! I HAD TO FORMAT MY ENTIRE DRIVE BECAUSE AFTER INSTALLING DISC 2, I ENDED UP WITH A VIRUS THAT WAS A PROGRAM CALLED SECURITY MANAGER AV!! SO THIS IS A BIG WASTE OF TIME! AND THE PEOPLE WHO SAY IT WORKS FINE ARE LIARS!! I CHALLENGE SOMEONE TO COME OVER TO MY HOUSE AND INSTALL THIS PROGRAM THE RIGHT WAY WHERE EVERYTHING WORKS!! IT CANNOT BE DONE!!!"
,Alphamalemindreaper,2010-10-26T10:53Z,HEY DONT SAY IT DNT WORK WE DONT NO IF UR FROM THE SITE WERE ROBBING WE WONT BELEVE U ASSHOLE!!!!!
