Don't forget to apply the patch people.
You should use the latest version."
,bayshafe,2012-06-08T05:17Z,I got it to work on Windows 7 until the end of the first movie (chased by dogs) then the application thing came up. I downloaded the patch  and it didn't work at all. I took a chance with W7 and just wanted to inform you what would happen.
