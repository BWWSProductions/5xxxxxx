"Representing Landscape Architecture" offers a broad investigation of how the designed landscape is and has been represented: for design study, for criticism and even for its realization. It has been said that we can only realize what we can imagine. But in order to realize we must convey ideas to others as well as to ourselves. Representation is by no means neutral and the process of communication, the process by which the imagination takes its first form, itself necessarily limits the range of our design possibilities.
Representation is by no means neutral and the process of communication, the process by which the imagination takes its first form, itself necessarily limits the range of our design possibilities. Computers further remove from cognitive processes and raise new questions about methods and limits. Written by a team of renowned practitioners and academics, this book is the best available reference to date on the many dimensions of landscape representation.
