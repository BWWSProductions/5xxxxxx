This patch changes the game's language (subtitles, menu and interface - all the things you can't normally change) to english.

This is not the full game, or crack, it's for those people who bought the game, but their local distributor sucks and doesn't let them choose any other language that local.

How to install:
1. Copy the DataPC.forge file into your game install directory.
2. Launch the game as usual.
