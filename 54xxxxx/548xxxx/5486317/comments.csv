,saeen,2010-04-08T15:36Z,No actually it did worked for me and i m playing AS2
,cuteselene,2010-04-08T18:16Z,"@saeen
why it is 47.25mb..what are the things you included with the crack..if you included xampp then that's not needed with 0.41 version of the emu and python and pycrypto ain't that size!!"
,saeen,2010-04-08T19:33Z,"This include 
assassins_creed_2_1_01_us.exe 19.48Mb
dotNetFx35setup.exe - 2.8Mb
Ptthon.-2.6.5.msi - 15.10Mb
and 
OfflineServer2.1.exe - 16.24Mb"
,Redundantos,2010-04-08T20:38Z,"Shit. You should have told about this before.
I have all of this installed and still getting: 
Unable to find ubisoft game launcher Error code 1."
,saeen,2010-04-08T21:11Z,"Install this where u installed the game.

Ubisoft/Assassin's Creed II"
,saeen,2010-04-08T21:16Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5486773/Assassin_s_Creed_2_Offline_Server_2.1_(Single_file)

Those who need only offline server file."
,Redundantos,2010-04-08T21:44Z,"Nothing changed.
Unable to find ubisoft game launcher Error code 1. 
And I can't apply patch to my game (globo release) - Could not retrieve installation folder! Installation will be aborted."
,saeen,2010-04-08T21:52Z,"I havn't patached anything. I just installed the game (AC2.FR.Up.By.Ermax83.iso) and ran OfflineServer2.1.exe, gave the installation folder address. It worked great really.

,Redundantos,2010-04-08T22:52Z,"So, congratulations, you've downloaded a proper game release and not some crappy lousy rip from globe@ as I do."
,jimmy55l,2010-04-08T23:00Z,"Probably a dumb question... 
Is it needed to be online while playing this now?
 Cus I get that message that I can't connect to ubisoft main server...and...don't know if I haven't cracked properly or what..."
,saeen,2010-04-09T10:14Z,"Someone commented:
it works like a private server. It's like, world of warcraft gives you the client, but you have to connect to their server to play. if you use a private server, it connects to your computer instead. Same basic concept."
,dannbeau,2010-04-09T13:35Z,"bullshit, this doesn't work. I've installed the proper game, not globo shit.

Telling me I can't connect to the ubisoft server. Thanks for wasting my time."
,saeen,2010-04-09T14:04Z,"You can the video on utube, this cracked worked for me, thought to share with you. Sorry for wasting your time."
,rugburn11,2010-04-10T16:56Z,"Utube Video is here...
go to Utube and type in...

Assassin Creed 2 Offline Server 2.1 

then follow step by step video and you will have it all...enjoy

,XONE65,2010-04-25T05:08Z,NEED HELP PLZ !!! am playing the game but i have a problem : in the meeting Templar i have no meeting to listen to !!! when i open the door nothing happens !!! PLZ am dieing here !!! PS : i tried every thing reload replay ..... 
,anon47,2010-04-26T09:15Z,"This actually seems to work, at least I'm not stuck at the white screen. So, i sort of recommend this.

Just install one file, kaspersky didn't match any viruses or anything and go C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Assassin's Creed II\Serwer and launch start.bat and start the game and works :S"
,anon47,2010-04-26T09:19Z,But it tells that it will only play the first few minutes of the game. Is that true and also how are the savings and loadings?
,fuuzz,2011-06-24T11:03Z,"YEAH!!!!

thx dor seed(s)!!!
i wil try the game!!!
thx!"
