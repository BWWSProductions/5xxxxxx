From the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team (F.A.R.T.) 
comes this excellent quality video 
with the original soundtrack restored! 

As you probably know, DVD's of season two of The Fugitive were released with a completely new, synthesized music score 
which destroyed much of the show's drama. 

Now, thanks to the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team, 
you can enjoy the show in top quality 
as it was originally intended to be experienced.
