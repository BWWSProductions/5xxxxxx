,bbees88,2010-05-17T09:23Z,"Anyone else having audio synch issues with this?  Have tried vlc, mpc, ms media player and all lose audio synch after awhile.

Is there another player I should try?"
,davidkayla,2010-06-20T15:50Z,"Yes I am having synch issues when watching it in the DIVX player on xp. It starts about halfway through. I absolutely hate synch issues.

I am just about to burn it to a standalone player to see if that makes any difference. Would it improve the situation if I changed the file to DVD format? "
,bbees88,2010-06-23T17:09Z,I would think that the audio will still be out of synch after converting to dvd.   Such a shame as it's a great movie.
[T],renman,2010-08-10T01:54Z,Hey folks try VLC player it always works fine in this. Look I rip these Sim movies directly from DVD and haven't had a problem with any of them yet
,fredkite,2010-11-03T17:58Z,Thanks for the rip Renman but sadly it drifts out of sync from about halfway. Any chance of a re-rip please?
,simplybindas3,2011-01-09T16:04Z,"No doubt audio is out of sync but changing track synchronization option in VLC media player to -1.300 seconds (minus 1.300) (-ve value for advance of audio over video option) will play it just right... To find ""track synchronization"", click tools in the VLC menu and then click ""track synchronization"""
,PiraatBae,2011-04-22T04:34Z,"Audio sync issues as well.  I think you may be running into a problem with the software you are using, if I had to guess.  As you say, VLC works fine but only after adjusting the audio/video sync at the point the audio starts lagging, which can be annoying in the middle of a film.

See my comments under your Cottage to Let upload for more info."
,Sicknero,2011-10-15T12:43Z,"Thanks so much for this. As an Englishman abroad, these are a sweet taste of home for me : )

Re; sync issues... I've been using Daum Pot Player for a while now, it's free and allows incremental audio shifting. Don't how it will work with this one, I'll try it when it's DL'd."
,acenoise,2012-01-12T19:21Z,"Audio goes out of sync quite badly by the end,but still a great upload and much appreciated. Thanks
