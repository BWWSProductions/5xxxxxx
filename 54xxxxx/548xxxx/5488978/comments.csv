But in all this BS we need to realize that all these systems sound good in theory but in PRACTICE they never work out that way. So most of this stuff in nonsense because we will never get to one side or the other (left or right). 

I had to laugh when the judge was asked what things should  be taxed and he said nothing! Stossel asked what about the army how would we fund that and he said ""maybe we don't need an army or navy"" LMAO! Yeah in his libertarian world of lollipops and rainbows it might work but in the real world we do need a military. "
