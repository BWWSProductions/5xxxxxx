,ZenRhino,2010-04-08T21:42Z,"Thanks... but was wondering if you could make available the unaired prelims from UFC Fight Night Live 21 (Florian Vs. Gomi)??

They are available for viewing at UFC's website, but I can't rip them cuz it's using Silverlight!!!

Any help would be appreciated cuz I'm really wanting the Brenneman-High fight (plus the other prelims too, but mostly this one) cuz he's a local guy!

Thanks for any help you can do on this subject!!"
