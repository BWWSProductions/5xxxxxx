Republic of Doyle S01E12: The Fall of the Republic

When Jake receives a mysterious late night call from Christian, heâ€™s not prepared for the scary crime scene he finds at the other end of the line; Mal is suddenly and seriously sidelined and Jake takes the reins to save his tormented brother from the police, including Leslie; Nikki makes a significant step in moving on from Jake; and everyoneâ€™s trying to keep it together as their Republic falls apart.


The resolution is 608x352 and while the quality is a bit blurry and flickery, it is quite watchable in my opinion. According to someone who knows these things, the scene missed capturing this episode, so this may well be the only version. I know that the file size is about 330MB instead of 350MB - I did things as usual and that is what AutoGK generated.

This episode aired on CBC on April 7, 2010. It was the last episode in Season 1. The show has apparently been renewed for a second season, scheduled to air beginning January 2011.
