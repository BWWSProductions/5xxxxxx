THE GREEN MAN
An irreverent black comedy adapted by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat from their play
'Meet a Body', the film marked the directorial debut of Robert Day. The more experienced Basil Dearden offered expert, if unaccredited, advice.
A scintillating Alastair Sim plays Hawkins, a timid watchmaker with a part time job - he is also a professional assassin who bumps off all the people we love to hate. But when pompous MP Sir Gregory Upshot (Raymond Huntley) is the intended target, bungling vacuum-cleaner salesman William Bloke (George Cole) always gets in the way. As the time of the assassination draws nearer, Hawkins tracks his victim to a dilapidated seaside hotel called The Green Man, and the laughs and tension steadily rise to a brilliant climax.
