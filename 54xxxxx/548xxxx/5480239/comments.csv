,scottielass,2010-04-09T16:12Z,"Going to have to monitor my upload/downloads otherwise I'm going to be paying extra if I download all these wonderful Alastair Sim movies! Ah well, what's money for eh!

Many thanks again. Will seed."
[T],renman,2010-04-09T20:50Z,"I wouldn't worry too much about that as this should always be here and if no-one is seeding just write a comment on any of my Sim uploads requesting a seed and I'll do so, as I check comments daily so I can respond accordingly."
,scottielass,2010-04-16T14:42Z,Thanks for your suggestion - so I can take my time downloading and not break the bank!
[V],neon,2010-04-18T19:42Z,"im also still seeding several of these sim classics,i said a week but they are worth seeding for a while longer"
