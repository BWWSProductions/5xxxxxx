audio files are divided at half-hour breaks

NOTE :: The podcast files from which I prepared today's torrent 
were initially recorded with the volume set significantly too
high.  I have adjusted the gain to the best of my ability, but
sound quality will probably still not be up to typical standard.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
