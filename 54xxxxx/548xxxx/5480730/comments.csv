This band is hot. Very, very hot.

And those aren't just empty words. After all, the Blues Company from Osnabr端ck, Germany is neither a hodgepodge of rank 

beginners nor ? to borrow business lingo ? a group of new business starters. Rather, they are a team of artists who have made 

their mark, musicians with experience and know-how aplenty. The musicians at work here have long since ensured that the name 

of their ?company? is a recognised ?seal of approval?. In a nutshell, ?Blues Company? stands for German's longest-running and 

most successful blues band. And with each new recording, with each concert, these pros underscore that their passionate love 

affair with the blues is burning brightly as ever.

Has their playing become routine? Not a chance. Quite the contrary, as can be seen in the fruitful interplay between the 

performers and their enraptured public. This in turn energises the band, whose fans feast on a free-spirited performance of 

the music Blues Company lives and breathes.

Since the '60s, the blues have inspired practically every generation of enthusiastic young, white musicians. Blues Company 

itself hasn't been around quite that long. The band started up its blues crusade on 20th May 1976. That was the day they 

first climbed on stage to fire up the audience into a twelve-bar frenzy. After countless other live missions, they proudly 

celebrated their first 30 years in the spring of 2006.

Initially, Blues Company concerts were not just a mix of fun and hard work. They were pioneering events. Because until Blues 

Company came to be, blues in Germany ? performed by professional bands ? quite simply didn't exist. What did exist were tours 

by American blues greats, who often enjoyed higher esteem in Europe than in their homeland. The Blues Company musicians 

backed up many of these bluesmen at their concerts in Germany. Thus they not only got to know the old masters, they garnered 

the admiration of countless blues freaks. Since then, many a basement musician who's strapped on a guitar or settled down on 

a drum stool to indulge in the twelve-bar sound can thank the Blues Company for leading the way (far off over the German 

border, a young, very talented Blues guitarist from Hungary admitted that he was significantly influenced by this band, after 

hearing one of their concerts).

The Company itself has demonstrated tremendous staying power - and Todor ?Toscho? Todorovic, the band's co-founder as well as 

singer, guitarist, composer and sound freak makes sure of this. The bluesman was born in 1951 in Lingen, in the Emsland 

region of northern Germany. His parents, who were born in Yugoslavia and who had fled to West Germany after the Second World 

War, gave their son a variety of opportunities to expand his musical horizons. And what Toscho learned from them and from 

grand old men of the blues including B.B. King and Muddy Waters would one day become the lifeblood of ?his? Blues Company.

Toscho not only plays the blues, he lives and breathes them. Blues without compassion would be unthinkable. Thus for years 

the band's leader has organised benefit events both large and small in his adopted country. For his commitment to social 

concerns, the city of Osnabr端ck awarded him the Public Service Medal in 1993.

Because the blues are performed live, Toscho has worked unceasingly on his image as an entertainer. It is pure delight to 

watch his facial reactions to a catchy refrain, to see how he electrifies the crowd with a breakneck guitar solo or entrances 

his listeners with a lush melodic figure, how he wakes emotions with his distinctive, dark voice. And with experienced band 

members at his side. The current line-up ? in effect the core band ? includes second guitarist Mike Titre (member of the band 

since 1980), Arnold Ogrodnik on bass and organ and Florian Schaube on drums.

The band has chalked up an impressive number of performances throughout Europe over the past 25-plus years: 3,000 to date. 

And even in the US clubs, the band is now viewed as an insi"

It was the first time that Hollywood has ever imported a blues song from Germany. Lately this makes particular sense as the 

Blues Company is an international player with an internationally successful product."
