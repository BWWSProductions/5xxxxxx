If you are a member of the WDM Network you can get them from our private WDM Tracker as the usual backup.

Thanks"

Michael, The Naomi Campbell Stalker 11/27/96 6:55am [Monday October 13 2003 - Best Of Stern 10/13/03] 

Ralph's Lie Detector Test 11/27/96 7:40am
[Tuesday September 18 2001 - Best Of Stern 9/18/01]

[Monday August 4, 1997] 8/4/1997 Robin's Big Revelation/Gary's Bigger Revelation! 8/4/97. 8:35am http://www.marksfriggin.com/news96_97/aug-97.htm

If anyone has any of these, or all, please upload. I haven't heard any of the three since their original airing. Especially the Gary revelation. It was bigger than his apology tape. And Ralph's lie detector test was awesome too."
