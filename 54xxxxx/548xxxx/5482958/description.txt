Seven might seem like theyâ€™re representing the early 80s. Strongly influenced by bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, Seven mixes sophisticated and powerful female vocals with new-wave, post punk rock. Their live shows burn out the stage! Seven has now released their fifth album â€“ darker and more dramatic than the previous four.
