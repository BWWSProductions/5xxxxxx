you would be our gaming god :D"
,Exalted.One,2010-04-09T05:40Z,"Yeah. After some tweaking I can finally play multi with my friend. (I got a retail copy, he got pirated version)
We can only play if he hosts a server though - if I host and he tries to join he gets the Autherization Error or something the like."

,FireSign,2010-04-11T21:01Z,"M&B is a great game, been playing since ~v0.5..

I cant wait to play this game, i was gonna wait till i built my new PC, but might aswell try it now. Defo gonna buy when i can.

BTW About Multilayer, i thnk theres a lan patch in circulation, so pirated copies can join servers aswell only private/cracked/pirate servers ofcourse..

BUT About Hamachi.. Dont use that crap. Everyone should start using Tunngle! Its a lot better than Hamachi!"
