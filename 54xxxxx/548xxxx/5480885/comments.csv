Sad to hear these children are victims of social engineering.  Lost lives that will most likely never have family security in their adult lives."

It is true people experiment sexually but people are hard wired the way they are...Diet and deprogramming won't help. Just like it won't help with your own sexuality.  You are who you are, and how you were born."
