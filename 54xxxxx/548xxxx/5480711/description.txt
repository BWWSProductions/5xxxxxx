My own choice of the eight best Alice Cooper's albums. I've looked here at Pirate Bay and seen no good torrent of more than one of his records, so I've decided to do this.

Hope you all like it.

Oh yes, it contains:

Along Came A Spider
Billion Dollar Babies
Hey Stoopid
Love It To Death
Muscle of Love
Pretties For You
School's Out
Trash
