Survival horror spreads across the Internet in Capcom's new Resident Evil Outbreak for PlayStation 2. Play either in the single-player mode, or join others online against the terrifying setting of a zombie infested Raccoon City. Choose your own path in Outbreak, as the game's story adjusts to the player's decisions. Escape the city quickly as a clock ticks down the seconds to the moment a government missile eradicates the infected citizens of the doomed town. Be brave and play alone, or join up to four other survivors in a horrific battle to uncover the dark secrets of Umbrella, the biological company responsible for the chaos.
