,LordSydan,2010-06-07T22:08Z,"Why dont you bring out the right program, the one that actually works...
These files are damaged.
Besides, i havent seen anyone upload this program with a right crack before. Believe me, i'd know.

Download version 15 untill the real 16 gets out!!!"
,FalconnerF16,2010-06-12T21:26Z,"Hi there!

          You should've also telled that when it asks for MPEG4 or MPEG2 codec activation, for example, you need to use the offline activation mode, otherwise it'll tell that the code isn't good, so you can't even write it down...!

          So more likely for noobs..., the codecs must be activated using the offline mode when asked, thus being able to write the code from the serial.txt file and activate it manually!

It works fine!

Good job once again!;)"
,FalconnerF16,2010-06-12T21:29Z,"OOOPPS!!!! Sorry for the bad spelling, it was ""told"" not ""telled""-> this word doesn't even exist!;))

Good job with the upload!"

,Deljor,2010-07-08T03:00Z,HELP' I cant get the serial to work??I followed the instr.but IT keeps saying I need to reg. online..
,cosmic#,2010-07-12T18:47Z,"Had to DL a patch from Magix to keep from crashing although the serial and crack worked fine BUT can\'t get the Mpeg4 serial to be accepted.  Apparently it is assigning a unique # to my computer that is similar to the mpeg4 serial.  Anyhow, without the mp4 it is no use since all my vids are HD.  Not sure if anyone elase having this issue??"

,UkuleleGuss95,2011-12-31T17:51Z,"Hi there. I have followed everything so far but up until I run the program (I have copied the exe. and disconnected my internet). It comes up with a ""Welcome"" box giving me 3 options:Put in the serial number, buy the program or continue with the trial.
So I put the serial key in and a green tick appears and then it asks me to put my email in below. I do that then click ""Register and activate online"", but then it comes up with a message saying that the code is invalid."
