Warren Zevon - I'll Sleep When I'm Dead | MP3 | 320 KBPS |1996 | 352 MB




One of the great singer/songwriters (like Tom Waits, Loudon Wainwright, Steve Earle, Delbert McClinton and Richard Thompson) that put most so-called 'musical artists' in their proper place, i.e. nowhere and lucky to be there.

If the late Warren Zevon hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him. At a time when his L.A. singer-songwriter peers were bleeding all over their puffy shirtsleeves with mawkish, sensitive balladry, Zevon turned the 1970s troubadour approach on its ear with a twisted lyrical sensibility that embraced danger, ribaldry, and general mayhem. The two-disc collection I'll Sleep When I'm Dead is an excellent introduction to Zevon's iconoclastic work.

The early years are well represented by the oddly poignant junkie's lament "Carmelita", the horror-of-war ghost story "Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner", and of course, such misanthropic staples as "Excitable Boy" and "Werewolves of London". I'll Sleep When I'm Dead stands to show, however, that the '70s weren't the end of Zevon's story. 

Zevon is backed by R.E.M. on the trenchant boxing tale "Boom Boom Mancini" and admirably covers Prince's "Raspberry Beret". He humorously sums up his life as a rogue on "Mr. Bad Example". "Accidentally Like A Martyr" is an austerely beautiful song and "Splendid Isolation" is a hymn to misanthropy. 

I'll Sleep When I'm Dead serves Zevon's legacy well. Songs like the incendiary "Play It All Night Long" and one of Zevon's finest meditations on life in L.A., "Desperados Under the Eaves" ensure that he won't be forgotten.
