,OrpheusDude,2010-10-17T05:41Z,"Thanks to slasherman for the download.

NOTE TO ALL PROSPECTIVE DOWNLOADERS:  I would say that at least 85% of the dialogue and voice-over in the film is in French.  There is very little in English, and by far the most important parts are in French.  In addition, there are large Norwegian subtitles throughout the entire film which sometimes obscure important images (it was recorded from Norwegian television, and it keeps going for about eight minutes after the film ends).

It's probably a better film than I could discern.  Unless you are fluent in French (and/or Norwegian), I suggest you wait until another source is available with English subtitles."
