Guide for using Elby's CloneDVD2
Purpose:  Create custom DVD's and delete extras and unwanted things on a dvd that take up precious space, which causes lower quality DVD's because video must be compressed in order to fit onto a Single Layer DVD (DVD-5).
Step 1: If you dont have CloneDVD2, you can download it here, install and go to step 2.
Step 2: Open up CloneDVD2 and click on "Clone DVD"
Step 3: Browse  your computer for the VIDEO_TS folder where your dvd files are located by clicking on the orange circle looking button in the top right corner of the CloneDVD2 window.
Step 4: Once you have the VIDEO_TS folder located click on it and click "OK"
Step 5: You will notice that you have a bunch of titles.  Uncheck all that you want to eliminate.  The one with the longest time should be the main feature with all of the other titles being the movie trailers, special features, FBI warnings, and .ect.  You will want to keep this one checked.
Step 6: If you would like to still have the menu from the movie then make sure that "Preserve menus" is checked.
Step 7: If your planning on using a Single Layer DVD-R then make sure DVD-5 is selected in the dropdown in the middle of the CloneDVD2 window.  DVD+/-R DL then select DVD+/-R DL from the same dropdown.
Step 8: Click next.
Step 9: Select all the Audio languages and subtitle languages you want to preserve.
Step 10: Click next.
Step 11: If you want to burn the output now, then make sure you have "DVD writer" selected in the top right (if you dont want to burn then go to step 12).  Once selected, enter a name for your dvd, select delete temp and then select "Go!"
Step 12:  If your new to this then you may want to make sure your output is playable and you have all the options you want (including main feature, correct audio, correct subtitles) included in your output.  To do this click on "DVD files" in Output method and choose where you want your output to be saved to.  Check "Add VIDEO_TS directory to path." and click "Go!"
Step 13:  Open up VLC player and test your output!!
Step 14:  Open up your favorite burning progam and burn your output to disc and pop it into your favorite DVD player and enjoy your custom DVD.

I will be putting these instructions in all my future releases.  If you find a mistake or have any trouble with my instructions let me know and I will update them or help you through the process!!
