[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-10T06:27Z,"i just read a comment on djfreds torrent that says this doesnt have a menu or special features.  i just want to make sure before i download this because i like exact dvd-rs.  let me know man.  cuz if it does i will seed forever.  you already know this man.  i wanna help you out.


thank you in advance man!  keep up the good work."
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-10T06:33Z,"ctang

disregard that comment. i just noticed you answered it in the brothers torrent.  sorry for wasting your comment space with shit youve already answered. i just clicked this torrent first."
[T],ctang,2010-04-10T16:27Z,@zombifuzz: ya im not sure whats up with this rental and not having special features...its exactly how it was when i rented it tho...i didnt modify it or anything...i may start going somewhere else to get my rentals if movie gallery is going to have their own special release without special features and extras
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-11T00:30Z,im still going to download this one regardless.  i heard this movie is really good.  i've been curious about it for a while now.  so thank you.
[T],ctang,2010-04-12T03:42Z,zombifuzz: should still be worth the download even though Movie Gallery screwed me on this one
