|  The Radio Dept. were one of the more successful shoegaze-influenced       |
|  indie rock bands to come out of Sweden in the early 2000s, making waves   |
|  among indie aficionados on the strength of their critically acclaimed     |
|  first release, Lesser Matters. Elin Almered and Johan Duncanson formed a  |
|  prototypical version of the group in Lund, Sweden, in 1995 while they     |
|  were in high school, naming the group after a gas station called          |
|  Radioavdelningen. Almered and Duncanson disbanded almost as soon as       |
|  they'd found a name, but Duncanson revived the group three years later,   |
|  teaming up with Martin Larsson. Bassist Lisa Carlberg, drummer Per        |
|  Blomgren, and keyboardist Daniel Tjader rounded out the lineup in 2001,   |
|  and things took off for the group at that point. They sent a demo to      |
|  Sonic magazine, which went on to feature the band on a CD sampler.        |
|  Swedish indie giant Labrador caught wind of the demo via the sampler and  |
|  snapped the band up; the group's debut full-length, Lesser Matters,       |
|  arrived two years later, during which time Blomgren amicably split with   |
|  the group. That album and the band's second release on Labrador, 2005's   |
|  Pulling Our Weight EP, received widespread attention with the release of  |
|  Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, which featured "Keen on Boys,"          |
|  "Pulling Our Weight," and "I Don't Like It Like This."                    |
|                                                                            |
|  Carlberg left the group soon after Pulling Our Weight was released, and   |
|  the group refrained from hiring another bassist, opting instead for the   |
|  use of a drum machine on its next album. That release, 2006's Pet Grief,  |
|  found Duncanson and Larsson turning away from the guitar-driven aspects   |
|  of their first full-length and delving into synth pop in the spirit of    |
|  the Pet Shop Boys. Due to various factors, including the fact that the    |
|  band didn't tour heavily in support of the album, Pet Grief failed to     |
|  sell as well as its predecessor and received little attention from the    |
|  mainstream music press. The Radio Dept. took their time recording         |
|  material for their next album, and it wasn't until summer of 2008 that a  |
|  new single, Freddie and the Trojan Horse, was released. More delays led   |
|  to nothing further surfacing (and the album that was supposed to be out   |
|  in late 2008, Clinging to a Scheme, being shelved) until the next         |
|  summer, when the single David was released.                               |
|                                                                            |
