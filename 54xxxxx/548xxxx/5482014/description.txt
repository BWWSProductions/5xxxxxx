    Cut-rate If this vans rockin, dont bother knockin classic for       
    teensploitation schlockophiles. Its all here: jocks, boogie             
    boardin, a candy ass doofus, and plenty of shag van vs. four            
    wheelin gangs with elevated hormones. The acting makes Police        
    Academy seem like Becket in comparison, and everything else is        
    bottom of the barrel, too. With lines like Im Rachel, fly me, you     
    cant miss. So what if Ms. Magazine wont give it any awards?
