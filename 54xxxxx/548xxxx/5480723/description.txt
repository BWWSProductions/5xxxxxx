Read Dead Revolver is a third-person gun slinging action game, powered with arcade-style gameplay that takes place in the Wild West era. In a nod to westerns like Once Upon a Time in the West, the game's story sees the family of young protagonist, Red, brutally massacred by Mexican General Diego. With his father's gun in hand, Red later sets out on a deadly mission of pure blood vengeance. As the game progresses, Red learns how to ride, mount and dismount a horse, and wield an arsenal of weapons from pistols and shotguns to rifles and dynamite. There are 30 different weapons altogether. Originally commissioned by Japanese publisher Capcom, the game was picked up by Rockstar (who bought the game's developer Angel Studios) after being in limbo for more than a year.
