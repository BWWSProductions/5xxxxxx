,Mamba4ever,2010-04-09T18:52Z,Personally would download the STRANGE release as its Scene Release and should pass Stealth and be ABGX verified
,Strikefear13,2010-04-09T20:54Z,"Oh it's real alright.  Downloading from Demonoid at a nice snappy 300kb/sec.  Started a couple hours ago, already 25% done.  Should have it in about 6 hours :D"
,ojam1,2010-04-10T12:52Z,this is working? 
,Denzil,2010-04-10T20:50Z,"Didn't download this from here, grabbed it from megaups instead.

If this is actually the HHH release (and I see no reason why it shouldn't be) then this is the AGBX report:

In case it wasn't immediately apparent, this game has SSv1 and does not have a verified ini in the abgx database. If you burn and play this right now, without that information and about week before official release (in some areas), then you're playing with fire. If you don't care, go ahead and knock yourself out."
