[T],Games4theworld,2010-05-22T19:13Z,"Hi,


@gioxan96

Open the '# Crack' folder in the .rar file you've Downloaded and copy the .vdf' file in there to: C:\Program Files\Counter Strike Source\platform\config   ; you'll get a pop-up telling you the file already exists. Just choose 'Replace'. The Game should run fine now.



@leahcimyrrah & @LilStalin89

No, this version of the Game runs without Steam.


@jozechi

What if you play on Steam servers? Will it work then? If yes, you can probably only run the Game on Steam servers.


@jamesdyler

Yes, it works fine on Windows 7.



@GameG0D

Try to turn of any Anti-Virus & spyware software running on your PC and then launch the wizard.

@the_butters_can_fly_lol

Yes, the Game works on Windows Vista for 100%.



@Triggerman73

I'm not sure about that, since we didn't test it, but some other comments say that it'll probably work, but I can't guarantee that, because CSS won't integrate in Steam. But I also think it'll work.

just one query: whats that notice about VAC server being secured all about?"
[T],Games4theworld,2010-06-13T13:20Z,"Hi,


@marviejj

It does work on Windows 7, actually. That your Hard Disk isn't working any more is probably caused by something else.


@celerity21

VAC -servers are ""Anti-cheat"", they say they have an automated system that detects cheaters, but most of the time it isn't really helping. They could better ban manually or add the function for players to report other players."

Browse to your install directory. IE: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Counter Strike Source""

Locate the hl2.exe and make a shortcut of it, and place it wherever you want (it will be used to launch the game)

Right click the new shortcut and hit properties. In the ""shortcut"" tab you'll see the ""Target"" which shows you: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Counter Strike Source\hl2.exe""

Type at the very end of this "" -game cstrike -console "" without the """"s. Then it should look something like this: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Counter Strike Source\hl2.exe"" -game cstrike -console  (You can also use parameters like ""-dxlevel 81"" ect, but no point unless you know what you're doing lol.) 

Hit appy/ok and launch the exe, now you have a console, but its recommended that you bind a key to console. Such as when you hit F12, the console appears or disappears. Insert ""bind F12 toggleconsole"" into console, hit enter and you're all set!

,Lopesmaio,2010-12-29T22:06Z,"Good torrent. 

Now, for who just can't play online, search for ""setti"" on google, enter the site css.setti.info, download their masterserver and replace the old one, on this folder : counter strike source>platform>config. copy & paste, when it asks if you want to replace the files, say yes, replace the file (masterservers.vdf)

Enjoy! 

PS: plz, after that, come here to say if it's working. i willl pay attention to all comments. if you did not understand what i've said, i will try to explain better."
