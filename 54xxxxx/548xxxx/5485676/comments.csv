SEED please,"
[T],vladtepes3176,2010-04-16T02:10Z,"11.5GB has been downloaded from just me and now only four seeds including me. CAN I GET SOME SEEDERS! The point of sharing is to SHARE! Not RAPE/Leach the downloads. If you can't keep 700 MB on your fucking hard drive and seed till there are more then enough seeders, then DON'T DOWNLOAD you LEACHING BASTARDS! 
This is a very rare documentary, and the best one featuring people, that doesn't involve some adventure that has ever been made! SO SEED! Please
If you have a comment make it, say it sucks, but it doesn't that's why it's being downloaded. But SEED IT! Thanks"
