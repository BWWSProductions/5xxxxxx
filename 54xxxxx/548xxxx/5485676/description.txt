This is a great DVD rip to XVID at 700MB (I use a the (PAKG)Guide to rip like Axxo) This is a classic sit down between legends William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. They talk about everything you could think of in their lives including Star Trek and SO MUCH MORE! A fantastic documentary that is very hard to find on the net. It took me about than a month to get an ISO of this DVD downloaded because it was so lowly seeded. So I ripped it and converted to a NICE QUALITY 700MB DVD XVID rip.

PLEASE SEED THIS, and help get this now easier to handle download going. 
Thanks,

PLOT:Tailored to the most hard-core Star Trek fans, Mind Meld gets you up close and personal with the stars of the original television series. Its premise? Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner sitting together and having a quiet, earthy chat about old times. There isn't much new information about the show--though old cast resentments are addressed--but viewers learn a great deal about the personal lives of everyone's favorite spacemen. The two discuss the pressures of filming a weekly show and the difficulties of maintaining one's dignity as an actor while wearing pointy ears. The personalities of both men shine through and it becomes obvious why they were cast as they were; Nimoy really is more thoughtful and reserved, while Shatner is extroverted and showy. The best part of Mind Meld is witnessing the genuine fondness the two men share for each other. It's clear that they really were (and are) best friends, even when the cameras stopped rolling. --Ali Davis
