thanks, no need pissing off the ppl that i like. It has in sync audio, video stays mostly focused,, only 2x do you see a head pop in & 1 hand & 1 short 3second:hide the cam, usher alert., lol but if you dont wanna waste the money...."

GWpirateGW, T.P.B. would be a very boring site.

LMAO, unless we think of that movie with Brad Pitt. The ZTrojan with the soldiers inside? but no, there ARE giant Scorpions & 1 BIG Cracken:D

all in all, the movie was more hipe, that story line, i rate it a b-"
,LAMBORGHINI38,2010-04-06T19:33Z,prefer to wait for the 1080p with audio russian and english and subs greek.
,catamaranman,2010-04-07T01:24Z,"Very poor audio and video!!! Even if you're part of the ""must see now"" crowd, wait for something better!  In all but the closest of closeups actors faces seem like amorphous round blobs and the audio ""clips"" through the whole movie.  My cellphone would have shot a better movie...seriously."
,catamaranman,2010-04-07T01:27Z,Thanks for trying tho! I STILL cant wait to actually SEE the movie! ;-)

you are very welcome.  Personally, the movie was too hyped up. It is nothing to orgasm over. I grade it overall as a b-. once I see the 3d cut, I may think differently, but still a must see for the fans "
,kraziaznvtboi,2010-04-08T09:51Z,"Yarr!

Not the best quality, but indeed watchable for those who can't waiting (or spending money!)

Thanks for the speedy upload GWpirateGW!"
