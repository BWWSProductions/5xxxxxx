Partition a SD card with a boot partition 50 megabyte and a second partition with the rest. Use 
partimage to restore the boot partition and fsarchiver to restore to the root file system partition. 

Boot the beagle board and connect your camera to one port (I use a Canon EOS 350D on the OTG port), 
and your WLAN dongle to the normal USB port (I use a D-Link DWL-G122, with the case removed).


The beagleboard creates a WLAN that you can connect to:

wireless-essid Beagle
wireless-key 1234567890
address 192.168.1.2
netmask 255.255.255.0



You should give your iphone/pc/whatever an address of for instance 192.168.1.3

Open your web browser and point it to 192.168.1.2



You can connect to the board using either ssh or serial cable, username root, no password (just press enter).

This image corresponds to commit 95218711d7afe1ae8ea1b6cb77a97beb6a610ec8 in the above github repository. To update kapture, you may connect the beagleboard to the internet (check out the file /etc/network/interfaces) and run:

cd  ~/kapture
git pull
