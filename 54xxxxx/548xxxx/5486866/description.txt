Doyle Bramhall has long been a legend on the Texas blues circuit and not much more than a rumor outside it. Bramhall is a solid drummer, but his reputation rests on his singing, a throaty combination of Doug Sahm and Bobby "Blue" Bland and the next best thing to Delbert McClinton himself. The songs here come from many different sessions with many different musicians, but Bramhall's gravely vocals hold it together whether he's singing in front of the Memphis Horns on Muddy Waters' "Bird Nest on the Ground" or in front of Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble on Bramhall's own "Too Sorry." Bramhall's songwriting is best showcased on "Other Side of Love," the kind of R&B ballad Bland himself could have sunk his teeth into, while his instrumental chops are spotlighted on "Take Your Time, Son" (where Jimmie Vaughan and Bramhall's son trade guitar licks over dad's steady groove). --Geoffrey Himes
