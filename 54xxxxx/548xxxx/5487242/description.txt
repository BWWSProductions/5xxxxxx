About Salix

SalixLive 13.0 faithfully replicates Salix 13.0.2 from which it adopts its full  choice of application (Xfce, Firefox, the full Openoffice suite, Gimp,  Exaile, etc.). Salix Live offers you a complete working desktop which  can be used in a completely nomadic but customizable environment. The  "Persistence Wizard" will enable you to easily preserve any of your work  and modifications. Alternatively Salix Live can be used as a full  fledged demo of Salix OS that can easily be installed with the help of  our brand new graphical installer.

A multi-lingual "Startup Guide" will assist newcomers in discovering  Salix OS. It shows which application can be used to accomplish a given  task and how to use Salix' multi-lingual system utilities including, of  course, how to use the "Persistence Wizard" or the "Salix Live  Installer". The Startup guide also contains information geared to more  experienced users seeking to fully customize Salix Live or to transfer  it to a USB device.
