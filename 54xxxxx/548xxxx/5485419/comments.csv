Thank you very much!"
,mondo,2010-04-10T22:25Z,"Thanks alot... A must-buy as soon as it comes out on DVD, but I -have- to see it now. 
Will seed this with 100mb until the light takes me... ;)"
,aocid,2010-04-10T23:41Z,"@mondo you mean, until the MPAA takes you?"
,mondo,2010-04-11T01:18Z,"@aocid
Well, let them come... Hehe.
Would be kind of fun if they bust my doors for sharing -this- when my vomputer shares other stuff 24/.. Hehe.
But Sweden has become overrun with ""pirate-catchers"" as well, so you´ll never know..
Isn´t MPAA US only. 

Well, don´t know, don´t care..

I´m happy that I had the opportunity to experience the early Scandinavian BM-scene in the early nineties though.. 
AND it is great that it has come a ""new wave"" (hate that expression, but anyway) of ""BM"" bands like Bone Awl, Akitsa an so forth.... Raw as hell..

Äääsch. Yrar bara... 

Great documentary though."
,pacocrowley,2010-04-14T19:54Z,"Very good documentary, recommended.

Also, the audio and video quality are good, 9/9

what the *beep* with the beeps on the tracklist?? :D"
,pacocrowley,2010-04-14T19:56Z,"Btw I'm done with the download, I'm gonna seed until 1.5 ratio, or until the light shit on me."
,soulknot2,2010-05-09T00:56Z,"I'm really loving the speed of this one, thanks a lot!"
,mondo,2010-05-13T17:45Z,"soulknot2 >>
""I'm really loving the speed of this one, thanks a lot!""

I have seeded this one with 100MB almost every day since it came up. 

798GB upload with a ratio of 345.696..
Hehe :P"
,nemo3,2010-05-23T18:45Z,"Hei, this was by far one of the fastest torrent I ever downloaded. How can you get this boost ?

V:9
A:8 

p.s.
There should be subtitles even when they speak english..."
,aocid,2010-05-24T05:51Z,"@ nemo3: The official DVD is already out. I don't think it is worth buying though it has an extra DVD.

The audio is a bit shitty because of the DVR, could not control the levels right :(.

Just glad this leak was appreciated while it lasted."
