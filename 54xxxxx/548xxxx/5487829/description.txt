PROPER NOTES:
Most important reason of our proper is because "Mention Stolen audio from p2p group named Imagine"
released 10 days about ago on p2p only
Mention stolen audio from Imagine TS release that contain a watermark. a REPEATED frames/audio 
(with voice) from 00:05:58.404 to 00:05:59.875. Exactly same repeated frames is here on Mention release 
Mention release is infact out of sync for the first 6 minutes and after that point too for many minutes, 
yes because there is one sencod and half more that usual (the repeated frame), so oos is normal in that case.

SECOND PROPER REASON BUT NOT LEAST:
Mention release is all out of sync for +100/150 mls but especially:
00.23.05.000 to 00.24.29.000  delay of +350 mls
00.26.36.000 to 00.41.12.000  delay of +370 mls
(compare voice with lip)

JPGS (of Proof folder):
proof.1.jpg = repeated frames from 00:05:58.404 to 00:05:59.875 (mention and imagine audio)

proof.2.jpg = other stolen proof, a little point of silence (mention and imagine audio) 
              normally setted during syncronization. (find at 01.21.39.094)... other silence poins
              are on the TWO audios.
