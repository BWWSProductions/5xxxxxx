Collection of comic books based on the American hard rock and heavy metal band, KISS.

KISS' first comic book appearance was in the #12 of Marvel's Howard the Duck in the May of 1977.  Marvel later they appeared in Marvel Super Special #1, which presented the band as superheroes.  As a publicity stunt blood from each band member was drawn by a registered nurse, witnessed by a notary public, and poured into the vats of red ink used for printing the comic at Marvel's Borden Ink plant in Depew, New York. The bands next comic appearance was in Marvel Super Special #5 in 1979. 

In 1997, Image comics began KISS: Psycho Circus, a much darker and mystical series than the previous Kiss comics. The series was written by Brian Holguin and illustrated by various artists, including Angel Medina and Kevin Conrad.  It portrays the members of KISS as supernatural beings known as the Four-Who-Are-One or The Elder: the Demon (Gene Simmons), the Starbearer (Paul Stanley), the King of Beasts or Beastking (Peter Criss) and the Celestial (Ace Frehley). The series ran for 31 issues.

In 2002, Dark Horse comics published a Kiss comic book authored by X-Men writer Joe Casey, later Mike Baron, and illustrated by Mel Rubi.  The series, which lasted 13 issues, continued with the Four-Who-Are-One theme but picked up after the band have split and must join forces again to fight a new threat.

In 2007 the KISS Comics Group, a joint venture between Platinum Studios and the band, launched a new comic KISS 4K.  The series was originally written Ricky Sprague and artist Kevin Crossley and lasted six issues before becoming a webcomic produced by Adam Black.  The series rebooted the KISS mythos by having a mysterious and beautiful figure reveal to each KISS member that they carry the warrior spirits of the 4K, which they must use to protect the world.  The webcomic ended halfway through #10 as it was not financially viable for Black to continue.
