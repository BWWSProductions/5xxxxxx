This is one of the last parts Alistair played as a priest in this adapted for TV drama in 1975 a year before his death. As always Mr Sim manages to steal the limelight with his unique style of characterization.

This drama was placed on The Cottage To Let DVD special edition and is a rare collectors bonus. It isn't gripping TV but anything with Alastair Sim in is highly watchable if only for his performance.


From IMDB

Alastair Sim was 75 when he starred in The Prodigal Daughter, sharing top billing with Jeremy Brett. It's the story of three Catholic priests and what happens when a young housekeeper is hired for them. Sim is the older parish priest, a man who is wise in the ways of the world and cooks terribly. Brett is a younger priest who undergoes a crises of his calling. While Brett wrestles with his nature and his conscience, Sim provides the foundation for Brett's decision, and does so without prejudging. There's not a great deal that can be explored in less than an hour, but both men are such accomplished actors they make the hour an interesting one. It's a solid teleplay for what it sets out to do. Once more Sim is the man you wind up watching despite a fine performance by Brett.
