Mari Hamada (born July 18, 1962 in Tokyo, Japan) is a Japanese female rock singer , songwriter and producer.

Mari Hamada started her professional singing career in 1983, as a heavy metal idol, produced by Munetaka Higuchi, drummer of Japanese metal band Loudness. Her records were successful in the Japanese rock market. Later, she changed her musical style to AOR (adult oriented rock), with mainstream commercial and even international success. In 1989, she hit No. 1 on the oricon music charts for the first time, and performed at the Budokan hall two days successfully in the same year. Two of her songs where used by the NHK to promote the 1988 Seoul olympics games TV diffusions in Japan.
