Continuing the dramatic story of an epidemic caused by a secret biological weapon infecting the people of Raccoon City, Resident Evil Outbreak File #2 brings longtime survival horror fans back into the world of online terror. Citizens are turning into flesh-eating zombies and swarming the streets, while only a few desperate survivors remain. Totaling eight characters in all, each survivor has different and unique abilities that they must use to escape the city before the government annihilates it with a deadly hydrogen bomb. Brand new scenarios, improved computer AI, additional character powers, and faster load times are but a few of the game's new additions since the previous version. Developed exclusively for the PlayStation 2.
