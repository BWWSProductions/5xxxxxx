PLOT: Assistant D.A. David Corelli is trapped between friendship and the law when 
the brutal murder of an important San Francisco millionaire points toward his former lover and college friend, Trina Gavin, a beautiful woman with a mysterious alter ego. As details of the murder victimâ€™s sexual escapades emerge, Corelli uncovers evidence that the victim was blackmailing a powerful politician with incriminating photographs. But as the crucial witnesses are systematically murdered and attempts on Corelliâ€™s life are made, the case assumes a paranoid veneer in which nothing is certain and no one can be trusted.
