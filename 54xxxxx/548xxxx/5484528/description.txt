Believe it or not, bees are one of the oldest species of domesticated animals. Archeologists have found evidence of beekeeping, or apiculture, in the Middle East dating back more than five thousand years. If youâ€™ve ever tasted good clover honey, itâ€™s not hard to understand why. 

But itâ€™s not just for the honey that more than 125,000 people (and growing) in the United States, alone, keep hives. Anyone interested in nature canâ€™t help but be fascinated by those buzzing yellow bundles of energy and the exotic world they inhabit, with all its weird rituals and incredible efficiency. Also, dedicated gardeners appreciate the extra bounty that pollinating bees bring to their fruits, flowers, and vegetable gardens.
