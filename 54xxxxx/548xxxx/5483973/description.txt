 In early afternoon, four armed men hijack a subway train in Manhattan. They  
 stop on a slight incline, decoupling the first car to let the rest of the    
 train coast back. Their leader is Ryder; he connects by phone with Walter    
 Garber, the dispatcher watching that line. Garber is a supervisor            
 temporarily demoted while being investigated for bribery. Ryder demands $10  
 million within an hour, or he'll start shooting hostages. He'll deal only    
 with Garber. The mayor okays the payoff, the news of the hostage situation   
 sends the stock market tumbling, and it's unclear what Ryder really wants    
 or if Garber is part of the deal. Will hostages, kidnappers, and             
 negotiators live through this?
