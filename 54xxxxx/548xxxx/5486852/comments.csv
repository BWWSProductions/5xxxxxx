,gordonl,2010-04-09T04:01Z,Thanks JW.
,ItBitTorrent,2010-04-09T04:09Z,"Clevelandsteemer is a perfect example of the Liberal mindset. In his comments notice the superiority complex; crude demeanor; and general malcontent. Carry on Cleveland, you do your ilk proud. "
,booboo332,2010-04-09T04:51Z,"clevelandsteemer - ""Fucking propaganda racist bullshit!"" 

Nope.  For racist propaganda you have no further to look than Obama's pastor for 20 years, Rev Wright, the hateful Louie Farrakan and the race pimps Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.  

cs - "" don't blame complex issues on those you don't agree with or understand.""

Ha!  Your very comments undo themselves with their own self-defeating assertions, Oh logic impaired one.  You fit in well with the democrats who blame and bitch about the Republicans for their difficulties in getting things done despite having the White House and a majority in the house and the senate.

cs - ""This fuck gets rich (which is at the heart of your sick greedy Yank society)""

Oh you poor little hate addict.  Wealth envy gotcha down?

:D

All your venom and insults can't hide the fact that your posts are nothing but petulant whining.  It is amusing how you make unfounded claims of racism when you yourself are a hateful little bigot.

Keep representin', fool."

,BarrySoetoro,2010-04-09T20:46Z,Clevelandsteemer... I think I love you.
[T],jwhitt62,2010-04-09T22:01Z,"The anger and vitriol of the left is absolutely incredible. These people are so full of hate, and they say WE are the hate-mongers. These self-righteous, self-loathing elitists are truly sick. And now we have one of them as President of the United States. God help us all, especially these left-wing wackos like our friend here."
[T],jwhitt62,2010-04-09T22:03Z,...and this guy was probably spitting in rage as he wrote this tripe.
,booboo332,2010-04-10T01:42Z,"I may be a godless libertarian, but there is no better reason for me to throw in with conservatives than the mentality that drives these leftists bent on tyranny.  There are many other libertarians who appreciate Rush, Neal Boortz being one, and while we may disagree at times with conservatives, many of us believe there is no greater threat to our liberty than these hellbent statists.

The very notions of a persons right to personal property, freedom of association and the right to live a life without incessant government interference is anathema to them and their groupthink is palpable.  Just look at the way they turned on the founder of Whole Foods when he dared suggest something different from their Government Healthcare gospel.

The writhing, frothing ones like cleavlandsteemer are the least of our worries.  It is the ones like Obama, well steeped in the teachings of Alinsky, who operate with calculating, publicly pleasant and insidious incrementalism that we must never stop challenging.

This is how the free world ends.  Not with a bang, but a calm smile and a pretense of compassion.  Thank goodness we have people like Rush to goad them into showing their true faces."
