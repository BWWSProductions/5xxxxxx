Adaptation of Mary Norton's children's classic about the tiny Clock family that live under the floorboards of a large house.

The Borrowers is a children's fantasy novel by Mary Norton about tiny people who "borrow" things from humans and keep their existence unknown. The central characters are the Clock family: Pod, Homily and their spirited teenage daughter, Arrietty. First published in 1952, it won the Carnegie Medal for that year, and was selected in 2007 by judges of the CILIP Carnegie Medal for children's literature as one of the ten most important children's novels of the past 70 years.
