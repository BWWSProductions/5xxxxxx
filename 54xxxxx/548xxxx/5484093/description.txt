Without doubt this is Alastair at his superb best. Based on J.B. Priestley's famous stage play and set in the year 1912, an upper crust English family dinner is interrupted by a police inspector who brings news that a girl, known to everyone present, has died in suspicious circumstances. It seems that any or all of them could have had a hand in her death. But who is the mysterious Inspector and what can he want of them ? Rather like Dickens in "A Christmas Carol", Priestley's primary concern in this play is that of "universal care" and we can see from Alastair's mesmerizing performance that this is something with which he wholeheartedly concurred.
