,Lsnake,2010-04-09T04:14Z,Ahhh...back at a time when these albums were actually good. Thanks. 
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-08T01:00Z,"I have to agree with you, the earlier Now albums were very good and they just don't make em like what they did back then.  All that cool eighties music that they used to put on each one.  You just don't get that kind of music now, to be honest a lot of this R & B stuff doesn't really do it for me.  I don't mind listening to it a couple of times but it doesn't compare to the stuff that was released on these ones.  

The music back then had a much better quality to it.  A lot of modern music nowadays can be quite irritating in lots of ways but still though some is still good, now and again I do like certain songs but not as much as the early days in Now music."

[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-13T22:05Z,"@quutar:  Of course it's the UK version, which other version did you think it was exactly with there being 72 different albums?  The UK is the main one, like it says on wikipedia if you read my link properly in the description..."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-13T22:05Z,"I mean 75 different albums not 72, typo mistake.."

I assume you complied the early albums from other sources as i don't believe they are available in CD format. There are some album versions as opposed to the shorter 45 versions on some of the songs.

I've also found some errors. Such as..

Now 5 Disc 2 Track 6 Conway Brothers is a repeat of Gary Moore & Phil Lynott - Out In The Fields track 12

Now 6 disc 2 track 13 should be Mai Tai - Body & Soul but is in fact Sisters of Mercy's song Body and Soul.

Now 7 Disc 1 track 3 Sly Fox sounds like a remix version and ends abruptly.

Now 7 Disc 1 track 15 Furniture - Brilliant Mind is a 12"" version by the sound of it.

Now 9 Disc 2 Track 8 Aha - Manhattan Skyline is David Shire's Manhattan Skyline from the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack."
