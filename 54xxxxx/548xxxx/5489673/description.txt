[Spraff]

Russell Tovey, Lenora Crichlow and Aidan Turner 
return as George, Annie and Mitchell in the 
critically-acclaimed drama Being Human, in which 
three housemates try to live normal lives despite 
being a werewolf, a ghost and a vampire.

After the death of vampire leader Herrick at the end 
of series one, the supernatural friends are hoping that 
they can now get on with their lives, but an even greater 
danger is lurking, within the very human world in which 
they are desperate to be a part of.

Werewolf George is coming to terms with the fact that he 
has Herrick's blood on his hands, and a girlfriend who 
knows his horrific secret. Meanwhile, turning down the 
door of death has implications for ghost Annie, but her 
confidence is at a peak and she is determined to stand 
up and be counted in the real world...

And, with Herrick gone, Mitchell must appease the 
vampire world; but can he find a way to lead by 
example?

With unwelcome intruders into their world, rumblings 
about an impending revolution from the vampire 
underworld and constant threats of exposure - on 
top of the usual issues faced by young people 
surrounding love, work and mates - the only thing 
they may be able to rely on in their heightened world, 
is each other.
