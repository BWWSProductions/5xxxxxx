USB Storage Xplorer - Xtaf v0.011:

Slasherking823 released a new version of his multiplatform FATx driver:

Works on USB storage formatted by the 360.
Port of my old multiplatform fatx driver
Messy as hell. Works.

BETA ALERT: Expect bugs

NOTICE: I developed this on mono under linux, haven't tried on windows, theoretically it should work.
And on that note, linux/osx users need mono to run this
