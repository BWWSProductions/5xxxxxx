If you haven't seen the new update on the 360, your now able to use your usb's for saving your games on them.

And this software makes it able to view the usb later on the pc."

,Charbis,2010-04-08T00:22Z,Sunblock. Top man.
,Bujaaa,2010-04-08T13:00Z,So can you install XBOX 360 games on your USB or just save them?
,Strikefear13,2010-04-08T20:46Z,Only game saves.
,Bujaaa,2010-04-09T18:42Z,"@ strikefear13
Actually....NO! You're wrong. When you install the usb storage device support and format your usb with XBOX360 console it will be identical to original XBOX360 hdd. And it will have the same abilities as the original. Including installing games."
,ReaL_BadMaN,2010-04-09T22:24Z,So cant i put DLC in the usb and play it? From the computer like i downloaded Trails HD.
,Yabab,2010-04-22T02:29Z,Theoretically you could.
