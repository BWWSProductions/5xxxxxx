I'm not too sure on scaling 1-10 on audio and video, and my assessment is probably not good enough seeing as how I just use my laptop speakers or headphones for audio, but I'd say both the Audio and Video are 7-8. I've noticed on most Blu-Ray rips, the black areas always have weird splotches. It must be a result of the compression or something.

The Video is definitely better than uncompressed DVD quality.

One thing I love about your uploads is that you don't waste hundreds of MB on separate audio tracks that chances are, no one uses."
