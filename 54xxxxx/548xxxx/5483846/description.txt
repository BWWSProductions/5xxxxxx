Sonny Rollins -  Brass And Trio (1958)

Verve Records

In 1958 Sonny Rollins split an LP between two very different settings. On four selections he is backed by a big band arranged by Ernie Wilkins (Rollins's appearances with big bands have been quite rare through the years) including Gershwin's "Who Cares?" 

The flip side showcases the great tenor in a trio with bassist Henry Grimes and drummer Charles Wright including "Manhattan," one of the very few jazz versions of "If You Were the Only Girl in the World" and a brilliant unaccompanied performance of a song often associated with his idol Coleman Hawkins, "Body and Soul." Rollins excels in both of these settings, making this an easily recommended set
