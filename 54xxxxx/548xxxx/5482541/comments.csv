,psystereo,2010-04-06T12:15Z,"are you sure any cracked version of Live 8 for Mac is stable? try it out for a couple of days, I was not lucky, btw this 7 version is 100% working and makes the job very well! You don't need the latest version to make nice sounds! This is not the suite7. I hope you all like this , my first torrent, I posted some Camel Audio AU as well on piratebay!"
,dinodrums,2010-04-06T14:33Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5285212/Ableton_Suite_8.1_MAC___ArCADE_Crack_(diMi)

Works perfectly on Snow Leopard plus Macbook Pro 2.53 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo...

Hasn't ever crashed for me!"
,kastlebay,2010-04-06T17:47Z,"confirm. all those 8.x versions to be found here on the bay do not work for longer than a few days, then they either quit for no reason - even if do nothing at all with your mac - after they started up or they don't even show up with a a start screen.

thanks very much fpr this older, but better version. much appreciated. coming in with 460 k, i'll seed this for a while, too."
,dinodrums,2010-04-07T20:46Z,"Hey Kastlebay, I can confirm that my version of 8 (as per prev. link) is stable and it's never crashed.  I use it extensively with plugins and Virtual instruments, sometimes even slaved to Logic 9.1.  I did wait for ages and tried & discarded every other hack 'attempt'.  I'm genuinely sorry it doesn't work for you guyz."
,psystereo,2010-04-07T23:23Z,"thanks for that information dinodrums!
It's nice to hear!"
,suheru,2010-04-28T12:49Z,"Still crashes..

,suheru,2010-05-02T19:21Z,"I found a guide to completely uninstall the ableton and then I reinstalled it, working great for now, thanks for this release, I owe you Psystereo"
,zzzune,2010-06-16T01:16Z,"after five min. the program keeps telling me it found a copyright violation, opens ableton homepage and shut down. Anyone jnows what i'm doing wrong?"

,nuab,2011-02-16T21:31Z,"@ suheru, where did you find the guide to uninstal the DYNAMiCS one?"

i upgraded but couldnt find a serial. its to use hardware and 7.0.14 doesnt support it. anyway thanks for torrent."
,Born82,2011-04-12T12:58Z,"hey i download it and works fine, except that i can´t find the library in the package. It doesn´t come with the file to download... is it anywhere here i can download the library, it does not even have a library path... what´s wrong"
,ckt6277v,2011-08-13T02:30Z,i have the same issue as Born82
,G4ME_B0Y,2011-10-29T15:40Z,"@dinodrums,  You're obviously retarded.  This is Ableton LIVE, you're link is for Ableton SUITE, two completely different programs.  Live is more of a user-friendly program, while Suite is more of a professional program"
,tn38,2012-03-07T20:04Z,"Hi, I've installed on to my mac but can't seem to find the icon to start the program. Any help please?"
