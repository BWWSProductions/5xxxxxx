'Let the Carnival Begin!' is the fourth release from the Swedish indie electronic band Wukimon. Wukimon takes the listener on a subway ride to the carnival where no party-poopers are welcome. 

Most of Wukimon's songs are rather mellow electronica songs with influences from indiepop and triphop as well as folk. The music is likely to appeal to fans of artists such as Bjork, The Knife, Mum, Depeche Mode, Tunng, Psapp, Portishead and Massive Attack.
