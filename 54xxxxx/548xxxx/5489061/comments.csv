,illiria,2010-04-10T09:33Z,So far shows 0 seeders. Not sure what am I doing wrong.
,illiria,2010-04-10T09:42Z,"OK, done everything right, IT WORKS! Yay!"
,illiria,2010-04-10T09:45Z,"Oh, and as soon as by now this is the best automated patch for DLC authorization, keep seeding please! It's small, won't take much space.

P.S. Two retarded Anti-Viruses (Comodo and ClamAV) on VirusTotal detect installer as a possible virus. It is because my patch ties to game EXE and runs without your permission. Well, it's mw\eant to be automated. Don't sweat, it's not a virus. I've created it for myself in a first place."
,recorded,2010-04-10T18:27Z,"I still get unable to authorizate the DLCs. =/
running W7 x64.."
,illiria,2010-04-10T18:41Z,"@ recorded

No idea what can be wrong. I've tested it on Vista x64 - works.  Try to disconnect from Internet while running the game, if you havent tried yet."
,recorded,2010-04-10T21:13Z,disconnect from Internet worked! Thanks illiria! =D
,illiria,2010-04-10T21:42Z,"@ recorded

Yeah... Problem is - it should work without disconnecting from Internet. And it does for others. Maybe it depends on the internet connection you have."
,illiria,2010-04-10T21:46Z,"By the way, you may block the game in your Firewall - that way you might not need to disconnect."
,recorded,2010-04-10T22:21Z,"well i took some test, DLCs won't work If im connected to Internet OR i have blocked the game with firewall. Which is pretty interesting...
At least i got the DLCs work in someway, thanks to you (="
,Rockadile,2010-04-10T23:13Z,"Will this fix ""Failed to authentic the disc""? I'm getting it after installing Kasumi dlc."
,illiria,2010-04-11T00:48Z,"@ Rockadile

You are getting this error because Kasumi DLC installs Patch 1.01 along. You need to download a no-cd crack 1.01 for the game. Not hard to find."
,Rockadile,2010-04-11T04:50Z,"Getting the 1.01 crack made it work, thanks. "
,Poms,2010-04-12T16:12Z,"Very cool how you're actively helping everyone here. That's awesome, mate! Kudos!"
,Lokee116420,2010-04-27T07:13Z,"Hi illiria, I have some questions.. I fell in love with ME2 and want to get all of the DLC. I have the ""Mass_Effect_2-Razor1911"" version of ME2.

How exactly does this work? do I just install your patch then I'll be able to download, install, and play the DLC from the official site (in game). or do I need to download the DLC from a torrent, and install? (e.g. Mass Effect 2 DLC Pack [Updated 06 April 2010] )

Just wondering because I'd rather just use your patch to get all of the DLC and future DLC. Rather than trying to torrent all of the DLC and get it to work."
,illiria,2010-04-27T15:40Z,"@ Lokee116420

Sorry for not replying before, but since I've had no chancew to, why not just try yourself? Yes, you can get DLCs from official site, and the patch will work. Of course it will, that's what it's been made for. Just keep in mind that Kasumi/Firewalker, and probably a few other DLCs will require crack 1.01, because they install patch 1.01."
,illiria,2010-04-27T15:41Z,"P.S. Ah, I see you've asked only today according to the date. Then I'm glad I was around. Cheers."
,d0mars,2010-05-06T09:20Z,"You will have to forgive my ignorance, I have never messed with DLCs before because I really hate the idea of the system, but I want to get the DLC for this game, I installed the exe clicked finish and the game still runs fine, I see in your previous comments that you say you can get the DLC straight from the site. So trying to get the dlc through the game it still tries to make me buy it, am I supposed to go through the Cerberus network, will it effect things if I log in with my EA account? not sure how to proceed about getting the content.

Any help would be appreciated and sorry for the ignorance"
,illiria,2010-05-07T11:59Z,"@ d0mars

Oh, don't worry about your ignorance, it's fine. :) You shouldn't try to get DLCs right from within the game, no. Download a torrent with them. like this one:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5496270/Mass_Effect_2_DLC_Pack_[Updated_06_April_2010]

This pack includes all the game DLCs. Just download the pack, and install them one by one."
[T],dramacore,2010-05-07T22:19Z,"this patch doesnt work for me either.
xp pro sp3, 1.01 patch, recracked it after the dlc installs and your patch. firewall blocking me2 also.

every patch i use makes it so that nothing happens when i click load save game.  
and i can't make a new character either."
,Illiok,2010-05-08T02:48Z,"I downloaded this torrent along with the torrents at:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5534648/Mass_Effect_2_DLC_-_Equalizer_Pack

and

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5356233/Mass.Effect.2.Cerberus.Weapon.and.Armor.DLC.XBOX360-FYK.rar

I installed them and played Mass Effect 2 for a couple of hours with no problems whatsoever. The next day, I boot up my computer and none of my games work at all (ME 1, ME2, Heroes of Newerth, Medieval II: Total War). 

All my games are retail versions (except Heroes of Newerth which is beta). They are spread over two different hard drives. I get a black screen when launching and they either hang or Windows 7 tells me there is a problem.

I tried reinstalling Mass Effect 2 with no luck. I tried system restore with the auto component of AVG disabled, but it didn't restore fully.

Does anyone know why NONE of my games will work now when the only changes I have made to my system before today were to install this torrent and the other two mentioned above?"
,Illiok,2010-05-08T11:44Z,"Oops, I didn't download the Cerberus torrent, I actually downloaded the following:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5484229/Mass_Effect_2_DLC_-_Kasumi_Stolen_Memory

Can anyone help?"
,d0mars,2010-05-09T04:06Z,"Ok, this conversation confused me then

This conversation made me think you could some how get the DLC striaght from the source when new ones came out as that is what it seemed like Lokee was asking

""do I just install your patch then I'll be able to download, install, and play the DLC from the official site (in game)""

then your response seemed to verify this

""Yes, you can get DLCs from official site, and the patch will work""

But I see you were probably meaning legitimate ways maybe, the conversation still confuses.

Though I do understand that this makes it were you don't have to rerun the dlc crack for future downloads and other features like that, which is great, after figuring this out shortly after I posted, I found a torrent for the DLC and everything is working great

Thanks for the work"
,illiria,2010-05-09T06:24Z,"First of all, as I've described above, this isn't exactly ""my patch"", it's just a shell for Loghain's patch. What it does  is simply makes the execution of Loghain's patch automated and silent before each start of the game. The, lets say, problem with original patcher was that whenever you connected to/disconnected from Internet, the game reverted the change back, and you needed to run the patch again.
Many uers simply did not understand thi procedure, thinking that the game works only if they are offline, while all they needed to do i run the patcher again.

Me? I find it very annoying to run the patcher at every game start and confirm file rewrite. Doing that every time annoy me. so I have tied the Loghain's patcher to the game launcher, made it run in silent mode, and pointed hortcut to it. So whenever you click ""Launch Mas Effect 2"", alone with the game launcher Loghain' patch quickly patche the file in ilent mode.

Also, as the patcher patches the game at each start (you will not notice any difference in launch time or anything) you can intall new DLC without ever hacving to run the patch again, let alone each start.

Basically? Basically I just made it automatical and silent, that's all, so  you don't have to screw yourelves over by patching and confirming file rewrite every start or every time you connect/disconnect to/from web. 

Now, if some of you would like to read me a lecture about ""using someone else's work"". If I can improve something - I will. I don't see any harm in improvements. As you can see, in the very first line of my torrent's description it says that it's all based on Loghain's patcher. Besides, I originally made it for myself only, but eventually thought I can share it, in case someone else gets annoyed with constant manual re-patching. The reason to call it ""New"" was to attract people, nothing more.

Back to the reason you say it doesn't work for some of you. I do not know the exact principle of its work, but from what I gather whether it works or not depends on the specifics of your internet connection. Playing the game offline should work for you. Less likely, it may depend on your system settings, but I don't know which precisely. I have a standard LAN connection, and it works fine on both of my computerss - XP32/Vista64.

Now you have to pardon me - the ""S"" button on my laptop barely works, its hard to keep typing like this. I answered what I could at the moment, with my screwed up keyboard, if you have more questions, keep posting them."
,kalabandor,2010-05-24T14:31Z,"I have done everything according to what has been said:
I turned on the game, went to options nd turned online options off. Then I installed the DLCs (everything except for Kasumi). I installed the 1.01 patch and the no-cd crack. Then I copied the DLC Crack (I tried that First) to the installation folder nd ran it. It crashed. After that dwnloaded ur patch nd installed that. The patch installed, but the DLCs r not autorized. The game works fine, though. Where did I make a mistake?
(btw, i have a firewall blocking ME2, AND turned off internet. I also have Microsoft .NET Framework 4 installed, Win 7 Ultimate x86)"
,rebeli83,2010-05-27T16:19Z,"Hmm, how do I see if the dlc is active after installation ?"
,Xegamr,2010-06-08T08:14Z,"Shit's not workin' mate. Installed, cracked, patched, etc in various orders. Turned off my web, ran as admin etc."
,mexicano1,2010-06-15T14:16Z,"When I run the game, I still see Loghain's patch crash before the game starts up.  Any solutions to this yet?

,Syteri,2010-06-17T21:54Z,"One question,

I bought an authentic Mass Effect 2 when it first came out. However, I don't like the idea of purchasing DLC. Will this autheticator work with an Authentic ME2? Also will it work with the new Overlord and Kasumi DLC on my ME2?"
,Syteri,2010-06-17T22:09Z,"Another question/s,

Once this authenticator is installed, do I need to crack/re-crack my ME2? Can I still log onto the Cerberus network? Do I still need to run those ""Crack.exe"" or ""givemeentitlements.exe"" files on in the DLC Torrents?"
,kevlar26,2010-06-21T05:27Z,Is there any way to install them individually? Because I have every DLC but the ones released after 2/9/10. If not do I just install it normally?
,kevlar26,2010-06-21T05:27Z,"Wow, completely wrote that comment on the wrong torrent, sorry guys."
,newmouse,2010-06-27T05:50Z,It should be made clearer that this is for Mass Effect 2 NOT Mass Effect 1st one @@@
,newmouse,2010-06-27T06:07Z,"If this changes the  Games EXE I would have thought that it is now unlikely to work with the 
latest 1.2 Patch version @@@"
,metal5115,2010-06-29T12:29Z,"Works Perfectly. Didnt have to Disconnect from internet or anything. Thanks a lot :)

,metal5115,2010-06-29T12:31Z,"@newmouse

I'm on patch 1.2 and it works great :)"
,gaart04,2010-07-02T18:06Z,Please Seed!!
,namxad,2010-07-09T02:40Z,"While the game worked perfectly it also contained a nasty \""Win32.TDSS.d\"" virus that took me half a day to get rid of. So while I got to play all the DLC packs I also had to uninstall my favorite game. Thanks asshole."
,namxad,2010-07-09T02:42Z,"The packs worked well, but I got the Win32.TDSS.d after running this file so watch out. Us Kaspersky to get rid of it. It changes you TCPIP.SYS file and redirects searches."
,grin321,2010-09-20T00:02Z,"Herro, I'm on 1.2 with a legit version of ME2. I got really pissed off at the fact that since I uninstalled my game I'd need to re-buy the little bonus pack you get with the game in the first place. 

So I DL'd your DLC package and then used the authorization and my game is at 1.2 and I got the failed to authorize error. So I found a no-cd crack for 1.2 and I still get the failed to authorize error, halp plox?"
,marl10796,2011-01-02T01:35Z,"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!
thanks for this i can use the DLC's!!"
,tackfurlo,2011-01-24T03:50Z,"FYI this is the ONLY patch that works on XP x64.  The other patches appear to use absolute paths, so if you have the game installed in a different folder from the default (such as ""Program Files (x86)"") then this is the only patch that works."
