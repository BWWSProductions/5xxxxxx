MLB 2K10 focuses on the match-up that matters most: pitcher vs. batter. The franchise raises the battle of bat vs. ball to new heights as Total Control Pitching meets Total Control Hitting. In the box, swing for the fences, put the ball in play, or spoil the pitch and foul it off. On the mound, paint the corners with power and precision, until your pitch count maxes out. Compete against the game's greatest sluggers in Home Run Derby. Turn your favorite team into an unstoppable dynasty by playing through multiple seasons in Franchise Mode. Or  get more instant gratification and dominate your friends in Tournament Mode.
