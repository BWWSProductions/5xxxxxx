Tyrant is an independent comic book produced by Steve Bissette, which set out to tell as accurately as possible the life story of one tyrannosaurus rex, from birth to death.  Unfortunately after the fourth issue, changes in the comic distribution model made the book commercially unfeasible, which helped lead to Bissetteâ€™s ultimate retirement from the comic industry in 1999. 

Bissette has completed 40 pages of artwork, which would make up #5 and #6 and hopes to eventually publish a collection of all published and unpublished Tyrant material.
