         NOVA examines how a simple instrument, the telescope, has     
         fundamentally changed our understanding of our place in       
         the universe. This tale of human ingenuity involves some of   
         the most colorful figures of the scientific world Galileo,    
         Kepler, Newton, William Herschel, George Hale and Edwin       
         Hubble--leading up to today's colossal telescopes. Now, at    
         the center of an international space race, a new generation   
         of ever-larger telescopes is poised to reveal answers to      
         longstanding questions about our universe--and, in turn,      
          to raise new questions.
