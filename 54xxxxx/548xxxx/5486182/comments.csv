,mestuart77,2010-04-08T16:44Z,"I should've written this in the first comment as well- what I have done: tried it in 3 different players- Windows, Media Player Classic, and VLC. I have manually opened the sub file and also placed it in the folder for the VLC. I tried copying it and renaming it as an SRT file just to see if that helped, but so far nothing. Thanks again."
