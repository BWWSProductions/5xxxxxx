Ufomammut is a power trio formed in 1999 in Italy by Poia, Urlo and Vita.
Ufomammut is worldwide recognized as the creator of a unique brand of psychedelic sludge.
With long songs, droning vocals and massive effects the band combines a monumental riffing attitude with the psychedelia of the more visionary Pink Floyd.
Since the beginning, Ufomammut has always been in search of its own sonic way: developing from a primordial acid album like â€œGodlike Snakeâ€, the band focused on a more mature and evil sound with the second album â€œSnailkingâ€.

The third album â€œLucifer songsâ€, opened new and unexpected doors, being the result of a mature and tight-knit band willing to experiment whilst maintaining its dna.
The flaming spatial voyage which made â€œSnailkingâ€ one of the records of the year in 2004 in many specialist magazines and webzines, remained as their core sound, evolving alongside new soundscapes made up of sinister atmospheres and gloomy sounds of vintage electronics.
With monolithic and repetitive riffs submerged by a psychedelic and magmatic sound, the last album â€œIdolumâ€ brought the band to its highest level.

In ten years the band has played several times around Europe reaching the US West Coast in 2009.
Ufomammut has performed at international music festivals like Roadburn, Hellfest, Assymetry and has shared the stage with bands such as DOWN, BARONESS, LENTO, MOTORPSYCHO, ORANGE GOBLIN and many more.
Ufomammutâ€™s live show is supported by the internationally acclaimed video and graphic art of Malleus, a rock artistsâ€™ collective who conjure the entirety of Ufomammutâ€™s visual impact.
