,seml4,2010-04-27T14:04Z,"How do I install the mod? The readme said that I follow the instructions and the mod got intalled in ""C:\Documents and Settings\user\Ìîè äîêóìåíòû\18 WoS Pedal to the Metal"" and I don't notice any change in the game.
PS: The readme said that reinstalling 18 WOS Pedal to the Metal would be desirable but I didn't do that and if so where do I install it? I've mentioned details below so that someone can tell me where to intall the mod or the game.

GAME LOCATION: D:\Games\18 WOS
MOD LOCATION: C:\Documents and Settings\user\Ìîè äîêóìåíòû\18 WoS Pedal to the Metal"
