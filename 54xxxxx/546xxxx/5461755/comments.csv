,korzac,2010-03-25T15:25Z,"@brunalandfrikki maybe you should move to the US if the timezone ""this shows"" are aired at, is inconvenient for you. Can't expect americans to air shows at night so us europeans can download them at the minute of release..

Anyways, fast download. Great quality delivered as usual from the eztv-network."

He was probably making a statement, obviously in good humor, as suggested by his ""lol"" and :_D

But way to be a snide, sarcastic asshole.

Audio, Video good."
