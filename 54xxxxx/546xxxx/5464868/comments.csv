These films are indeed surprisingly hard to find on the net (congrats ESPN & co.!), and unfortunately, only sold INDIVIDUALLY on DVD at one retailer. *shakes head*

I'm very surprised scene groups (or ANYONE with the tools) hasn't caught on and encoded/uploaded more of these great series of films. Except you, Ursus02, and a couple of others (low quality), so thanks again."
