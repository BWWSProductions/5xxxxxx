,xxxcha,2010-03-27T12:35Z,"yes this is episode 13, 11-12 was a double aired march 18th"
,jaylo101,2010-03-27T17:43Z,"You are getting the episodes mixed up, the first new episode, which was a double, is simply episode 11.
This episode, which is correctly named, is the one aired on March 25th.
Episode 13 is the next one on April 1st. "
,johnniebrasco,2010-03-30T19:24Z,"I don't agree, all the epsode guides states that the double episode as 11-12, so this should be 13. the next should be 14. i have been looking for episode 13 for days and didnt know that the name was wrong."
,johnniebrasco,2010-03-30T19:25Z,and the packed rar files are called 113
,jaylo101,2010-04-01T20:01Z,"After looking at the ABC official website episode listing for Flasforward, there apparently is no episode 12."
