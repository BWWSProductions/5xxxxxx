Close the Transcribe application.
If needed, make sure that you have administrator rights to your computer.
Click the 'Trial_Reset.reg' file and your Registry will be updated, and you will have another trial period of 31 days.

Some applications (e.g. firewalls and anti-virus) might have plug-ins or functions that won't let you change your own Registry. If that's the case for you, exit those applications while updating the Registry with the 'Trial_Reset.reg' file."
