,hunter123456789,2010-03-25T12:11Z,"This is a legit plane and an excellent one that i may add,like Anonymous said the exterior model is superb but the VC needs a bit of work on the clickable buttons, but you cant really argue because its only a BETA. Cant wait for the real thing, its ment to be released in March this year but who knows. http://www.forum.aerosoft.com/index.php?showtopic=33282"
,OO-VEG,2010-03-25T19:18Z,Just wanted you guys to know that Mathijs (a member from Aerosoft) knows about this problem in their security. 
,wazz62,2010-03-25T19:28Z,This is a better model than Wilco Airbus A320
,JasonVoorhees95,2010-03-25T22:24Z,"YES its great!!!i agree with ''hunter123456789'',there are some problems with the buttons but the vc and the exteior are really amazing.Can't w8 for the full version

THX!!!!!"
,maverick622011,2010-03-25T23:05Z,Looking for concorde x anyone got it yet :)
,fsland,2010-03-26T00:13Z,"i agree with hunter123456789, since this is only beta...the final version will be worth buy! i just love the way the buttons react ...and how they light up!!

Req:Airsimmer A320!! anyone?"
,JasonVoorhees95,2010-03-26T07:53Z,"maverick622011:We must be patient,because the concorde-x is brandly new and expensive enough.Anyway here's a link have a look:http://www.flightsimlabs.com/aircraft/concorde-x/ 

the vc is excellent!!!!"
,mckayi,2010-03-26T20:27Z,Looks great but VC not clickable yet so cant fly
,zlin142,2010-03-26T23:00Z,"@ fsland:

Airsimmer A320 is uncrackable. :P"
,Cruzu,2010-03-30T16:01Z,Wonderfull add-on. Cant wait for the full version. 
,gurpalsc,2010-04-03T12:25Z,"i found nothing great in this addon...wilco is still better...
there was no 2d panel .....
fmgs is also very crapy..."
,terbucn,2010-04-04T23:19Z,gurpalsc do you understand what mean beta?! When will be finished will be much beter than wilco!
,dicodor4u,2010-06-30T08:47Z,I made a mistake during the install and did not type in the info mentioned in the read me...and the panel works! just copy the folders....when the plane loads up slam the throttle full forward back to idle and walla! the buttons work in the VC. my two cents
,GregC8902,2010-07-09T21:15Z,Does this come with the liveries??
,Capt_Minus,2010-07-16T22:14Z,@terbucn: will see when this beta goanna full version..............it will take them years and years...
