,MichiganMan,2010-04-26T23:27Z,"Can anyone give me a hand?  I've downloaded it and everything seems to work, but my burned DVDs won't play in my DVD player.  The menu comes up but it won't go to the film.  The player does read DVDRs, and the DVDs play in my computer fine.  Any suggestions?"
,Earthtones,2010-05-04T05:16Z,"Code didn't work for me either :(

I had a previous version installed that lost its registration after a while - I did a full uninstall, but suspect leftover registry entries stopping this version from registering..."
