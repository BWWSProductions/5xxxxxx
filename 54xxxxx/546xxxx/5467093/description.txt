Release Notes
This release is CLASSIFIED. Video thanx to Elektri4ka, Audio thanx to PrisM. Video isnt the greatest but did what I could with it. Added some color, took some away and touched up the black. Has a flicker throughout also dark in some scenes but couldnt be brightened without washing it all out. Audio is from prism's cam and was left untouched. Enjoy.
