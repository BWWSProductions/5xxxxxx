Blue Wild Angel: Live at the Isle of Wight is a posthumous live album by Jimi Hendrix
released on November 12, 2002. The album documents Hendrix's performance at the
Isle of Wight Festival on August 31, 1970, barely three weeks before his death. Some
songs on the album were available on the 1971 release Isle of Wight.

The set list for the concert contained songs from the original Experience albums, as
well as new songs written around the time of the performance. Tagged into the set
was an adaptation of "God Save the Queen" and a cover of The Beatles' "Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", played just before launching into "Spanish Castle
Magic". The 22-minute version of "Machine Gun" includes walkie-talkie interference
from security personnel feeding through the sound equipment. The CD set is more
thorough than the DVD release as it contains "Midnight Lightning", "Hey Baby (New
Rising Sun)", and "Hey Joe", three songs omitted from the DVD. There was also a
"highlights" album released as a single disc, which contained 11 songs; 9 from disc 1,
and 2 from disc 2.
