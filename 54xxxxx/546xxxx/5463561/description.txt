Unscrupulous Californians will do anything to get their hands on a million bucks in this twisted tale, which intertwines three story lines. Bobby Ray (Craig Sheffer) abducts a meth-lab chemist (Lucy Liu) and sets off to find his druggie girlfriend (Sadie Frost), who's in the custody of her real estate magnate dad (Robert Loggia) -- a man in danger of being kidnapped. Meanwhile, jealous Laura ( Illeana Douglas) must deal with a philandering fiance.
