New Group.  Neon Trees with their first album released on March 16th, 2010 called Habits.  Mix of blues and rock.  These guys opened for The Killers before their album was released.
I don't usually upload, but i wanted to put this on since i haven't been able to find many copy's. online.
I'm not positive that its up to "thepiratebay" par, but i hope i did my best, and if not someone else can copy it and put it back up.

Also supposedly you can get the album with a bonus track "Farther Down" which i was unable to find.  Enjoy :)
