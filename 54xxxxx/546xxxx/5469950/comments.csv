,mannaroth,2010-04-05T17:01Z,Hey does this work on XP ?
,Poppcorn22,2010-04-06T03:40Z,"It works like a dream :)
If you get that error code just disable resident shield if you use AVG, it's prbly the same in other anti-virus prog. too :)

Thanks COTTA, and keep up the good work ;)"
,_COTTA_.,2010-04-06T19:58Z,"Thanks friend

Always looking for excellence"
,Yraelity,2010-04-11T21:11Z,"I'm having trouble. After I run the setup.bat (with no problems), the JustCause2 application crashes just after starting it. I don't have any anti-virus program that I'm aware of."
,_COTTA_.,2010-04-12T19:42Z,"Good morning Yraelity,

You Have the minimum requirements for the game?
You must have the requirements, otherwise the game will not open
respects"
,Yraelity,2010-04-13T02:51Z,"I believe that may be the problem. A friend can run the download just fine, and his laptop is a bit better than mine. I will try it out on my desktop and get back with the results later. Thanks for the help."
,BoomUploader,2010-04-13T18:11Z,Very nice! I recommend this if you don't like to mount or burn to get a game working. Keep it up! :)
,huntermckiller,2010-04-27T12:28Z,"Doesn't work. I've added the folder to exceptions in my anti-virus, got an error regarding a dll, got the dll, now still getting errors."

,MakahNation,2010-05-08T07:03Z,"Very good rip but i have a problem. the game works perfectly other than the mouse response is very slow, the mouse and keys react too late. my system exceeds the minimum requirement but like i said, the mouse and keys are lagging like a slower system would. is there something wrong with my installation or is this how the game is ?"
,coffeebot,2010-05-13T10:12Z,err sorry i ran setup.bat and i said overwrite or something. i pressed yes then after it finished theres this justcause2.exe [steam start] or something...WTF! then i dunno know what next
,visje123,2010-05-13T20:31Z,Could not find steam_appi.dll .. Anybody knows how to solve this? Thnx
,tacster,2010-06-06T18:04Z,"i have the same problem, Steam_api.dll seems to be missing...   COTTA  do you have a solution?"
,007EO,2010-06-09T16:43Z,I can't start it missing fmodex.dll it stands!?!? Anyone know what to do?!?!
,3skr,2010-06-11T09:42Z,"Ive dowmloaded, run setup.bat, unziped files to get steam_dll thing, i hav minimum requirements but it says that it has encountered an error when i start it. also dont have antivirus programs"
,icki_15,2010-06-12T00:28Z,"The game unpacked fine, although it took a while. When I ran the game it stuttered although this maybe down to my laptop. Also, the sound doesn't work? Is there a minimum required sound card or something (I'm not great with computers, although my laptop is fairly modern)?"
,icki_15,2010-06-12T17:31Z,"Well I started it up again, the sound came back although the video is still painfully slow and not up to speed. The speech in the heli happens at the start, and then it takes a minute or two for the guy to actually say it. I don't think my laptops up to scratch tbh, and the desktop is even worse so I may just get on PS3 and be done with it."
,adamanto75,2010-06-13T16:25Z,"it says XINPUT1_3.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem... What is wrong??

thanks"
