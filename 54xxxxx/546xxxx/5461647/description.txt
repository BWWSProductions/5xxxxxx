My first upload. Seeing as how no-one has this up yet, I thought I'd do it as a small gesture of thanks for all the great stuff I've downloaded from TPB over the last few years. The reason I never bothered before was because I never had anything to upload that wasn't already up. I thought this might be a fake when I found it at rlslog.net (posted at the end of the Southland Se2 Ep 4 thread) but I've checked it and it's kosher. I'll seed as long as I can but I'm using a piggy-backed wi-fi connection, so...

If anyone prefers to download it direct the link is here:
