,onewaymule,2010-03-25T03:08Z,thanks soooo much...I've been trying to find this episode all day =) 
[T],artpepper,2010-03-25T03:10Z,"You're welcome. Please seed for as long as you can coz my connection is a bit dodgy, if you know what I mean. It's shaping up to be a great series, though. Olyphant was great as Bullock in 'Deadwood'..."
,Gemneye,2010-03-25T03:28Z,"is this real cause I've tried to down load others twice and they've disappointed, don't know if I can take the heart break again."
,ZenRhino,2010-03-25T03:51Z,"could be legit... the 1st episode was about 51 minutes and just about 550Mb - typical ""1 hour"" shows that end up having about 42 minutes airtime are close to 350Mb... I'll wait for TVTeam eztv, or someone with a skull to post a file cause I know/trust them completely.

sorry to artpepper, but I have learned to trust almost exclusively only someone with a skull on here."
[T],artpepper,2010-03-25T03:54Z,"Don't blame you in the least, ZenRhino. I'm always deeply suspicious of 1st time uploaders who post something no-one else has upped, but this is legit. I just felt it was time I payed back a little instead of just being a leech.

Will the first person to get the full DL please confirm this is real? Thanks."
,onewaymule,2010-03-25T04:13Z,"this is real everyone..just watched it
ZenRhino the first episode was a pilot pilots are always longer 

artpepper thanks again =) I'll be seeding for as long as I can  "
,darkfish21,2010-03-25T04:13Z,this series is starting to become very interesting ...
,ZenRhino,2010-03-25T04:39Z,"@onewaymule:

I wasn't saying anything about the first episode, I knew it was longer since it was the pilot - I was giving it's time/size as a reference to this file's info.

This is a bit small for what should be closer to 350Mb, but that doesn't automatically make it fake in my book... but it is a reason to wait before DL this file.

There are now 4 seeders by the info TPB is providing - yet nobody is commenting on it being legit or not... makes me wonder.

Again, no disrespect to the user who UPped this, and if it proves legit you can expect an apology from me & lots of thanks (and a +1) for your effort!"
[T],artpepper,2010-03-25T04:45Z,"According to VLC player, it's 41 minutes long (including opening titles and closing credits). I watched it on a 17inch laptop and the quality was excellent, both audio and video..."
,ZenRhino,2010-03-25T04:55Z,"@onewaymule:

sorry, didn't see your total comment saying you are seeding & that this is supposed to be legit... but since you have no torrents to your name I also question if you aren't just the user under another name... sorry, but I've seen too many tricks like that get used by people putting fake torrents on here.

if there was another torrent of this episode on ANY website I might not be so skeptical - but this seems to be the ONLY one ANYWHERE, but I might give it a try just to clear things up for myself.

The episode is titled ""Riverbrook"" like the torrent file says - according to IMDB. If I check this out I'll let you know what I think of this file."
[T],artpepper,2010-03-25T05:15Z,"I'll be waiting for your apology,ZenRhino. Alternatively, you could just download the thing directly from the link to rlslog.net that I provided. Either way, shit or get off the pot but fer christ sake, stop droning on. Enough with the paranoia, already..."
,ZenRhino,2010-03-25T06:25Z,"Didn't want to DL this one, but I decided to do it just to see what's what... it's legit. Runtime says 42:44 in WMP - good quality too.

Ok, I apologize... and gave a +1 to boot!! Will seed for the night & then remove when I wake up in the morning."
,spindig,2010-03-25T06:45Z,Thank you for putting this up for us dude. I can't figure out why eztv tvteamor ezRSS didn't post this on tues day... but at least its up for me to watch.  
,herminshs,2010-03-25T08:32Z,"It's 100% Legit, I don't know why some people just like to put their .2 in it, it's free........thanks artpepper, Shit's legit.."
[T],artpepper,2010-03-25T09:16Z,"Happy to do it, guys. I don't really blame anyone for being a bit suspicious. I hate all those asshole faker myself...Thanks for the apology, ZenRhino. You're a gentleman."
,Desolator4u,2010-03-25T09:53Z," Wow, why did  this take so long to reach torrents? Thanks artpepper, can't wait to watch this!"
,ZenRhino,2010-03-25T14:13Z,"@herminshs:

If you don't know why people need to put in their .2 (I'm assuming that means 2 cents) them why did you have to add yours?

I was skeptical for the reasons mentioned... if you can't understand them, then posting your comment is counterproductive & seems quite dumb.

Nobody had this available anywhere, so when someone comes along with their first torrent it makes me wonder... especially when people like eztv & TVTeam didn't have it - but it proved to be legit & I apologized as promised.

But it's so nice of you to add your "".2"" even though I tried making up for doubting artpepper & their torrent."
,duxs,2010-03-25T19:15Z,"Thank you, I've been waiting for this episode and you have it and the transfer rates have been awesome. Thank you again. "
,suecanada,2012-05-18T16:24Z,"Thank you very much, I was having a really hard time to find episode 2. "
