"The Greatest Story Ever Doh'd"

When Homer is playing noisily in the yard, it disrupts Flanders' 
bible-study group. Coaxed by the reverend, a frustrated 
Flanders takes it upon himself to redeem Homer by inviting the 
Simpson family on his church retreat to Jerusalem. 
Unappreciative of the history and culture, Homer would rather 
hang out at the hotel's breakfast buffet rather than tour the 
city. But when an eccentric tour guide (guest voice Cohen) 
takes the group to famous monuments, including the Dome of the 
Rock and the Wailing Wall, Homer finally proves he is not 
beyond salvation.

Enjoy :)
