The sold out various artists collection release from Electric Tremor - Lieder Der Berge. This underground sampler will appeal to anyone with a taste for industrial, minimalist electronics, general EBM, and especially to fans of DAF and Nitzer Ebb, and electro punk.

Despite it being militarist, this music or any of the bands featured are non-political with some anti-fascist exceptions.
