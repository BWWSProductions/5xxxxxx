Internal error has occurred, code 0x00000003. Please contact
technical support by e-mail at address help@xericdesign.com.
EarthDesk will now quit."

The same happened to me. I simply restarted program and the update worked. Simply find Earthdesk in the taskbar, right click, and hit Force Cloud Update. Worked for me."

,roadside1,2010-04-30T15:16Z,It asks for a serial #. Otherwise it runs with a watermark. Suggestions?

copy the EarthDesk.exe from the download folder to your installation directory...

which is probably
C:\Program Files (x86)\XericDesign\EarthDesk"

Has anyone found a way to tweek out this crashing, although you still have a very good looking desktop after the crash it is a bit of a bugger. Have tried on XP, Vista and 7 all crash the same. Tweeked anyone?"
