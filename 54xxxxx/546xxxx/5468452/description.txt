An excellent publication on the puppets and manipulations of the british empire, very important also is the expose of Karl Marx. You know something stinks about him. Leftists always whine about what a good analysis marx made, but even this is crap. Research his writings on his boss, Palmerston, who he thought was a russian agent.
