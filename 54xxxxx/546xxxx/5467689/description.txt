This is a set for memories of good ol' times. Old World Charm was the debut of Sophie Moone at MPL, but not her debut as a model of course. This set was originally released in 2003, but rereleased in 2004 in the amazing high resolution of 1200 pixels.

Sophie retired last year and is currently the owner of a lingerie shop in Budapest, so if you want something sexy for your girlfriend you now know who to turn to.
