,hybrid_0069,2011-01-03T06:21Z,"actually rbtOne, there were 2 internet seasons before they got on tv, so i would assume this is those internet eps..."

,Mark_Apelt,2011-08-04T10:46Z,"Why is nobody seeding, this seems like a really awesome torrent and it would be bad if it all went to waste, because some people aren't seeding, I really wanna see this, it's only common courtesy."
,r00kie87,2011-12-05T01:45Z,"Downloading this on a seedbox, will host it for a week or so."
