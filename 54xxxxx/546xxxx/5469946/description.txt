"Sell the House"

Eddie and Joy want to downgrade to a smaller house, but 
Doug and Ally aren't ready to move out on their own. 
Meanwhile, when Duffy dumps Whitey (guest star Martin 
Mull), he moves in with Eddie and Joy as a way of 
coping, but he quickly overstays his welcome and Joy 
wants him out.

Enjoy :)
