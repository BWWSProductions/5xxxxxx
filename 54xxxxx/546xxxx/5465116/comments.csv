11/42.

Quite alot of false positives as RELOADED uses a launcher for this. But I tried myself and it works perfectly."

,inflikkt,2010-06-30T12:21Z,"ive ran into an irritating windows 7 permissions issue trying to copy this crack.  for whatever reason it will not let me copy the file.. to anywhere without providing permissions, but it also will not allow me to take control of the file... im on admin account.  god i hate what they did to windows 7 it so.. disgusting"

,Vegasbob,2010-07-13T09:47Z,I can\'t get this or the other RELOADED crack only to work. Everytime I try to use this it starts the game and then gives me some EA Bullshit about unexpectedly looseing the connection to some server and it asks me to login to a username and password.
,dnst3,2011-01-13T02:04Z,i am getting the same error as vegas. anyone know what we can do? ;/
,keithasdf,2011-01-19T12:38Z,"what is the different of the crack with this torrent which has the game and the crack:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5464114/Command.And.Conquer.4.Tiberian.Twilight-RELOADED-%5Btracker.BTAREN

is this a better crack or something??"
,keithasdf,2011-01-19T12:50Z,"@ Vegasbob
ok, though i have problems with the actual game, but i did successfully made it work, don't know why its so hard for you guys...anyway i will try:
after installation, double click on the exe, the game would ask you your e mail and password from the command and conquer.com forum in order for you to update your game and trust me you better to (ignore this if you do not want to update.)
ok, now the real thing here: copy the files from the crack folder and paste in your game directory, in my case c:/programs files/Electronic Arts/TiberianTwilight then just paste them in this folder, if you got ask by the windows, just choose copy and replaced.
click the new exe again, i am using NOD32 for security, so in my case, after i clicked the new exe, it would ask me twice about the permission setting of your firewall, if the message contains  127.0.0.1, then click yes to allow for the connection(loopback), and click no to the others.
hope that help"
,LordTburt,2011-01-19T19:22Z,It is infected with a trojan virus.  I clicked ignore it on  my virus scanner.  CNC4 runs but my computer was infected.  I had to go clean it up.  
,Frequentdler328,2011-09-17T10:44Z,From what I have seen the other torrent is a Trojan i would not use it always take the safe road if it is available I always say.
,jolui,2012-03-09T19:46Z,"This crack works 100% but its not necessary to open or instal the file FHA

Just replace the two files where the game is instaled."
