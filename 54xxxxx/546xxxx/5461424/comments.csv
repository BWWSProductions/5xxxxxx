You can wreak havoc on your mac with this app.  Be super careful when or if you use it."
,GregTheWang,2010-03-26T22:49Z,Works perfectly. Thank you so much
,Piratbayianer,2010-04-01T18:29Z,"I like that!!!
Just cleaned up 6,4 gigs of cache!!!
thank you dimi13beast"
,freeisgreat,2010-04-02T09:22Z,"Thank you so much DiMi. You made it very simple and easy.
Spent ages chasing this. 
Appreciate !!"
,pulanami,2010-04-09T23:56Z,"To echo what was said before, Be super careful with this. I used the keygen which told me to double click the serial it generated. Very odd. It accepted it, ran fine, and cleaned out 5.6 gigs of junk. However, now time machine freezes on back up to my capsule, and I spent 2 hours on the phone today to try and fix it. I sent profile to Apple, and the tech immediately saw this and told me to trash it. He wasn't even familiar with it, even though it is available on apple.com. I am attempting another backup now after trashing it and crossing my fingers. Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, eh?"
,dimi13beast,2010-04-22T02:03Z,"one thing to be careful about this is its cleaning of ""universal binaries"" this sometimes cleans out stuff that was actually needed by your apps esp. on intel so i would uncheck that box b4 cleaning"
,macpirate2008,2010-04-26T05:19Z,Dude.
,Mairedanaan,2010-05-09T00:12Z,"!@#$% the effer keeps on telling me that i have the wrong activation code, and to try again...

clearly there are... lots :) of serial codes,
but maybe its the name that doesn't work...

any advice guys?"
,jt567,2010-05-16T07:50Z,thanks dude! it works.

,Oinkoinks,2010-11-13T03:00Z,It works fine. thanks!
,anon197,2011-01-04T03:33Z,"To those who are having trouble with their keycode, I originally struggled, but if you put the name as your Username on your mac and then press enter about twenty times in quick succession, it seems to work. Worked for me anyway. Maybe the keygen thing needs to be on the desktop, or maybe CleanMyMac needs to be open. Je ne sais pas...

Thanks dimi13beast - great app"
,anon197,2011-01-05T03:08Z,Turns out it has deleted all my system fonts. Use with caution :D
,maini4ka,2011-02-06T23:14Z,"Keygen worked as a charm on version 1.9.4.  Detected user name automatically, only one click was necessary"
,drumrobot,2011-02-15T00:25Z,"Works perfectly...
Is it worth pointing out that you could just put the keygen on here and download the trial app from the official website? I'd have to think that the download would be much faster from there...
My ISP seems to block uploading, and I don't have a reliable internet connection in any case, so I'll just put the keygen on filedude. Feel free to seed it once you've got it.
