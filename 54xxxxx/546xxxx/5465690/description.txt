Les MisÃ©rables (pronounced /leÉª ËˆmÉªzÉ™ËŒrÉ‘Ëb/ or /leÉª ËŒmÉªzÉ™ËˆrÉ‘Ëb/; French pronunciation: [le mizeËˆÊaËblÉ™]), colloquially known as Les Mis or Les Miz, is a musical that was composed in 1980 by the French composer Claude-Michel SchÃ¶nberg with a libretto by Alain Boublil, and lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer. Sung through, it is one of the most well-known and performed musicals worldwide. On October 8 2006, the show celebrated its 21st anniversary on London's West End and became the longest-running West End musical in history, reaching 9,500 performances. The production continues to this day at London's Queen's Theatre. The show is now in its 25th year.

Based on Victor Hugo's 1862 novel of the same name, it is set in early 19th-century France and follows the intertwining stories of a cast of characters as they struggle for redemption and revolution. The main characters are joined by an ensemble that includes prostitutes, student revolutionaries, factory workers, and others.

The Tony Award-winning score features the song I Dreamed a Dream, sung as a solo by the character Fantine during the first act. Numerous Professional artists have recorded cover versions of this song since the musical's premiere in October 1985, including Neil Diamond, Aretha Franklin, David Essex, and Michael Crawford. The song had a resurgence in popularity in 2009 when Scottish amateur singer Susan Boyle performed it live as her audition for the third series of the British reality television program, Britain's Got Talent.[1][2] The song On My Own by the character Ã‰ponine was among the major hit songs featured in the musical.

Original London Cast Recording

The Original London Cast recording was the first English language album of the musical. Recorded in 1985, when the show premiered, it is closest to the original French concept album. For example, "Stars" appears before "Look Down" and shortly after, the original version of "Little People" plays, which was later incorporated into the revealing of Javert. It also features a song entitled "I Saw Him Once", sung by Cosette, which was later incorporated into the first part of "In My Life".

The cast includes Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Roger Allam as Javert, Patti LuPone as Fantine, Alun Armstrong as ThÃ©nardier, Susan Jane Tanner as Mme. ThÃ©nardier, Frances Ruffelle as Ã‰ponine, Ian Tucker as Gavroche, Michael Ball as Marius, David Burt as Enjolras, and Rebecca Caine as Cosette.
