This was a brilliant game when i came out it put you through a campagin where u would attend a number of different situations from fires to riots to police chases to roof to rescues traffic jams and air ambulance calls always being able to call in any emegency vechile to back u up! As you completed these things u would earn money which could be spent upgrading repairing or even buying new and improved choppers. you could also jump out of the hellicopter and run about on foot.

Anyone that had sim city 2000 could also build a city in that game and then fly their city in sim copter and also do missions through out. As for graphics these left alot to be desired but were decent for the day but over all a cracking game loads of fun to be had!"
