The only files that work for me at all are the short ending and opening clips."

cheers"

If you run into a problem with seeking on these files, note that VLC, for me, did not have the proper codec to correctly play the file.  The problem would involve such symptoms as the movie being interrupted to restart at set times and random seeking failure with am offset of time specific to each video.

I fixed this by using Media Player Classic (1.4.2999.0x64) instead, which is not my favorite, but I believe the .mkv container reader is more accurate in the case of these videos, specifically.

In short, if you have problems with VLC, MPC will run it with no hitch.

VLC is terrible. You should use MPC-HC or CCCP which is a codec pack with MPC-HC as your primary media player."
