Please upload as soon as you get it . I will seed for a month or so."

,cheater71,2010-03-29T22:30Z,"I actually don't know when the next ones come out, i get the episodes from www.animeplam.com
i put up the torrents whenever the episodes come out. the admin of the site says the next episodes should be out in maybe 2 weeks"
,sasouri_on_deathbed,2010-03-30T04:11Z,still im not gonna complain. u done a good job with HQ vids!
,below90hz,2010-04-04T05:06Z,wow what kind of crappy hardware are you people working with? if anything these files are too small. prefer to see 250mb MINIMUM for good quality. thanks tho cheater - ignore the whiny babies.
,surfaddict,2010-04-12T14:52Z,i vote for quality too... thanks cheater :)
,surfaddict,2010-04-12T18:37Z,i couldn't play 33... did it work for you guys?

,IXavier,2010-04-27T06:43Z,actually 33 and 34 dont work :'(
,drjacko,2010-04-28T21:39Z,"Yo below90hz! Everyone does not have great internet speed like you. There are some people who have a speed of 15 kbps. No kidding. Even with 50 MB videos, the quality is still great. I know because I have downloaded some.

I am hoping that there will be some people who do the same with the Bleach episodes. Right now, all the bleach torrents have 175 - 200 MB sized episodes. Waiting for someone to bring the size down."
,below90hz,2010-04-30T04:54Z,"@ drjacko: point taken. guess i've been spoiled with my 20mbps connection. forgot not everyone has that option.

if you wasn't a complete interwebs stranger, i'd offer free naruto watching and snacks at my pad then! ^_^"
,prionkor,2010-05-06T10:01Z,@DavidGP: lol! yah! I am also dying to see hinata :)) You dl the episoids! but i use low speed connections so will need lots of time to dL :(
