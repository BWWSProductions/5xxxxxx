BTW After I burn this to a DVD,copies will be going to every Food City Store for use in the Video Department for public display especially the one I work at.A lot of my co=worker have asked for copies when they found out that I have it.I'm going to be busy.
Thanks again,mak621 for the upload.You ought to get a skull for this."
