"State lotteries, itâ€™s sometimes said, are a tax on people who donâ€™t understand mathematics. But there is no cause for anyone to feel smug. The brain, no matter how well schooled, is just plain bad at dealing with randomness and probability. Confronted with situations that require an intuitive grasp of the odds, even the best mathematicians and scientists can find themselves floundering.


Suppose you want to calculate the likelihood of tossing two coins and coming up with one head. The great 18th-century mathematician Jean Le Rond dâ€™Alembert thought the answer was obvious: there are three possibilities, zero, one or two heads. So the odds for any one of those happening must be one in three.


But as Leonard Mlodinow explains in â€œThe Drunkardâ€™s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives,â€ there are, in fact, four possible outcomes: heads-heads, heads-tails, tails-heads and tails-tails. So there is a 25 percent chance of throwing zero or two heads and a 50 percent chance of throwing just one. In the long run, anyone offering dâ€™Alembertâ€™s odds in a coin-flipping contest would lose his shirt.


The key to puzzles like this, Mlodinow writes, is Cardanoâ€™s method, named for Gerolamo Cardano, author of the 16th-century â€œBook on Games of Chance.â€ To lay the odds for even the simplest-seeming event, one constructs a table, or â€œsample space,â€ of all the ways Fortunaâ€™s dice might fall. Trust your instincts instead and youâ€™re bound to go wrong."

I decided to post this excellent audio-book as a companion piece to Barbara Ehrenriech's Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America. Both books are a stand-outs in an ocean of half-witted 'self-improvement' horse-shit.
