In the iso file is Family Guy Volume 1 Disc 1. The previews on this disc have to be picked in the special features and they are pretty much small family guy skits that are fairly funny so I left them. The only thing done to the disc is it has been compressed to fit a dvd5

Family Guy Volume 1 Disc 1-Season 1 Episodes 1-7

NTSC

I'll seed this till the ratio gets to 2 or 3 then I'll start the next disc if there are some seeders for this. 

I'll always put in the comments when I stop seeding and if it should stop before that it's cause I had to take the computer to work for a few hours (usually 4 to 8 hours at a time) but it will be back. Like I said I'll always post in the comments when I stop seeding.
