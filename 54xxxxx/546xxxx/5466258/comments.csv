[T],Magash,2010-03-27T05:07Z,Just going to work for a bit I'll be seeding it again in about 4 to 5 hours. 
,Mercyflush64,2010-03-27T07:43Z,Nobody has ever got to 100% on your other 3 family guy postings. I am close but not there yet and I can seed them for a while.
[T],Magash,2010-03-27T19:14Z,"I wish that was the case but I know 4 people that were able to get the entire seasons from the torrents I put up but not one of them seeded it. 

I've had this disc up and have a ratio of 4.2 with it and only one other seeder. I think I'm pretty much wasting my time putting up the Family Guy stuff cause everybody pretty much has it already plus there is a million torrents here with it already.

I was going to put up all of the volumes of Family Guy then American Dad but I really think it would be a waste of time."
[T],Magash,2010-03-29T04:36Z,I've stopped seeding this
,Mercyflush64,2010-03-30T08:28Z,"One thing you might think of is that not all of us get the same connection speed. So I am sitting here also wasting my time with three large downloads at 75% that I now have to delete. I started downloading all three of these within 30 minutes of them being posted and within a couple days of each you stopped seeding. You would have had MUCH better luck if you would not have posted so much at once and the speeds would have been better. Family guy has a large following if you look at the dozens of pages that can be downloaded. Too bad, I was looking forward to the full dvd's instead of poor quality rips of single episodes. Best of luck to you in the future."
,Mercyflush64,2010-03-30T11:24Z,"If there wasn't any interest in Family Guy why only 12hrs after you put the three up there were close to 1300 people trying to d/l and several days after you stopped seeding there are still 150 on each trying to get this. As I said before, too bad you weren't patient enough to let this fine collection grow enough to seed itself because it would have for a long time."
[T],Magash,2010-03-31T11:34Z,"I wish that was the case but plenty of people were able to get full copies from all the downloads I put up people just don't want to seed. Most likely cause there are so many copies of this here at the  pirate bay. This was seeded to a ratio of 6 and had 4 seeders when I left it. Now none. 
I don't know why you would have to get episodes when there are plenty of torrents here that have lots of seeders that have the full dvds even the uncompressed versions. I was just now going to start to seed the rest of the dvds for volume 1 but can find it here in tons of torrents so like I said this is more a waste of my bandwith and time to put up again.  "
