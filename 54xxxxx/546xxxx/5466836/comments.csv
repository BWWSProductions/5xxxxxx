(Well, that small minority who stay up till 3:00 am hoping for an early seed rather than the smart ones who set their RSS torrent feeds and have a good nights sleep...but what if you wake up and there has been a glitch and no Caprica...shudders)."

Well said my fello UK-er... EZTV team/group are surely a dedicated lot and we Fu*&ing LOVE you guys for all the effort.
As well as sending our deepest thanks for providing the best TV service of all, we will continue do our best to seed with you."

I agree with you both, and I'm from the  U. S. A., not that I'm extremely proud of that these days mind you. But I will definitely add my thanks to yours, as well as my seeding efforts.  

TYEZTVUPP""ERS+SEEDERS! LOVE TO YAS!"
