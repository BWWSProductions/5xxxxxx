Excellent stuff by a young classically trained German musician and his band. If you appreciate Thom Yorke, Radiohead, or the Muse, this is definitely for you! Very intelligent music. Beautifully rendered and recorded. Great piano sub-rhythms. Roman is an artist we can expect a lot of interesting pieces from. As of today, 24 March 2010, he is touring in Germany and will soon record his second main album, this time in Sweden.

I hope he won't mind the upload. I've tried to buy this album on the internet, and to my surprise have not been able to do that. Our brilliant friends in the recording industry must have decided that Roman's music shall only be purchased in Germany. And then they wonder why folks resort to use the PirateBay.
