One of the very best video game soundtracks ever.

Kirill Pokrovsky, the author, offers this free on his website, so I'm just saving him some bandwidth here. Thanks Kirill!

This is only 128kbps but sounds good, there doesn't seem to be another option out there.

I will keep this torrent alive, but my upload speed is utterly slow, so please help your fellow downloaders by seeding as long as you can. Thanks!
