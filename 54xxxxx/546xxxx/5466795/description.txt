Animal Man (Bernhard "Buddy" Baker) is a fictional character, a superhero  in the DC Comics Universe. As a result of being in proximity to an exploding extraterrestrial  spaceship, Buddy Baker acquires the ability to temporarily â€œborrowâ€ the abilities of animals (such as a bird's flight or the proportionate strength of an ant). Using these powers, Baker fights crime as the costumed superhero Animal Man.[1]

Created by writer Dave Wood and artist Carmine Infantino, Buddy Baker first appeared in Strange Adventures #180 (September 1965) and adopted the name Animal Man in issue #190. Animal Man was a minor character for his first twenty years, never gaining the popularity of other DC heroes such as Batman or Superman. However, he became one of several DC properties, such as Shade, the Changing Man and Sandman, to be revived and revamped in the late 1980s for a more mature comics audience. As seen in the comic below, he was billed as a "full time hero", an aspect that would be the most changed by the revamp.
