,dcutter,2010-03-25T13:59Z,Thank you VERY much for this upload. I am a huge Sarah fan and due to Comedy Central moving her show (how lame) no one had released this episode previously.
,bepaald,2010-03-25T15:19Z,"Thanks man! I've been waiting for this.

I even wanted to buy it myself, but iTunes doesn't work on Linux, and the amazon store doesn't sell outside the US... their loss..."
,zeffoman,2010-03-25T18:21Z,Thanks
,fernirl,2010-03-26T00:29Z,"dont itunes shows have DRM added ? + the torrent is stuck @ 32% .. 

seems a bit weird to me, hope it works anyway or EZTV releases it "
,EdgarS777,2010-03-26T15:09Z,"@valium: Still only one seed (you?), and me and other 316 peers stuck at 32.4%.  My (and their?) download has been idle over 4 hours. PLEASE CHECK YOUR PC AND TORRENT CLIENT!

Suggestion: If you have multiple seeds, stop all except this one, temporarily."
,fernirl,2010-03-26T16:44Z,I'm going to say the torrent is a scam ..
,steinhole,2010-03-26T17:53Z,"Yeah, I hate to sound like a dick, but I'm not trying to download this even though I'm dying to see the episode because something seems fishy about it.

I'm just gonna wait and hope that the regular capper catches a replay and the EZTV releases it."
,Manipulateral,2010-03-26T17:55Z,The file size is wonky.
,JackOfficer,2010-03-26T19:31Z,i think its fairly obvious what happened here. the uploader is a noob and at about 32% he realized nobody could watch this file but him cause of the drm protection in itunes. it would have to be converted with something like tunebite or sound taxi
,fernirl,2010-03-26T20:22Z,"i think this might be a trap .. at 32% all the peers are saved and the file is probably DRM anyway.

episode 7 is around now via another torrent but im still hoping someone can release ep 6"
,steinhole,2010-03-26T22:22Z,"I don't think it's a trap, just a poor job of upping a torrent. Everyone's got to start somewhere. The expert was once a novice. Remember that, people. Don't hate so easily."
,fernirl,2010-03-27T00:31Z,"yeah you have a point, still though itunes dont offer shows without DRM afaik. 

anyway ill just wait for someone else to up ep6"
,samursus,2010-03-27T05:29Z,Why the hell is this episode so freaking hard to find??? Its fucking nuts!
,zeffoman,2010-03-27T14:59Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5467312/The_Sarah_Silverman_Program_S03_E06_XviD_MK187.avi

this one is seeded/working properly"
,fernirl,2010-03-27T15:59Z,thank you !
