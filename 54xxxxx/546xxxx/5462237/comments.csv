Enjoy!!!!"
,Lemberg,2010-03-25T18:39Z,"Tim & Eric Awesome Show is broadcast in widescreen this season. It sucks that someone cut it to 4:3 as sides are missing (faces missing on people, there are half bodies and text missing...)"
,Lemberg,2010-03-25T18:49Z,"Or maybe it isn't being shown in widescreen, because the widescreen files as well as the 4:3 files all looked warped, wry and manipulated. What's going on with the aspect ratio this season...?"

Any change those can get uploaded?
Thank you!"
