,est1307,2010-03-25T18:37Z,This is fake. Dont download.
,est1307,2010-03-25T18:41Z,"I think its the same one as Ghost Hunters S06E04 HDTV XviD-2HD[eztv] thats running around since 9 this morning. If Im wrong, Im sorry, if Im not, well you know where to put this torrent"
,TheAngelMike,2010-03-25T18:48Z,i have not seen any ghosthunters from eztv .... 
,ToastyxDxD,2010-03-25T18:51Z,"Just checked it, its about a lighthouse! So I assume its correcnt.

I've seen all the GH epps, and this one looked new to me."
,est1307,2010-03-25T18:51Z,"me niether, until today. I found it on most searchs. I took 5 copies from different sources and all were the same, need to buy some pass code for media player to view. Trashed. this one will be done soon if the speed would stop dropping, then Ill know if this is it too. "
,est1307,2010-03-25T18:53Z,"the desc. is right for this weeks episode, but all the others said the same thing too. We will see, soon. If not Ill hunt it and up it myself."
,est1307,2010-03-25T18:56Z,"ToastyxDxD, did you view it? its not a rainbow screen? If you viewed it, and I trust you are honest, then its a good copy. Ill know soon enough. I will apoligize for the ""fake"" part. "
,ToastyxDxD,2010-03-25T18:57Z,"The first line is:

On this eppisode of Ghost Hunters. Taps rolls the dice in Atlantic City where a tower of terror awaits them at the Absecon Lighthouse."
,est1307,2010-03-25T19:10Z,"would be great if its good. heres another one thats not good running around on seedpeer. 

Ghost Hunters S06E04 HDTV XviD.wmv

this one is fake also. "
,est1307,2010-03-25T19:54Z,"I got it to 64% and I played what there was, and it is the right one. I do apoligize ToastyDxD for calling it a fake. It was too close in description to the others that were posted today and I already took 6 of those copies thru out the day that were fake. I hope you see my concern and nothing personal friend. All good peeps, just wait and watch it."
,ToastyxDxD,2010-03-25T20:34Z,If your sound is buggy (Only hearing the right side) turn it to mono -.- (using VLC media)
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2010-03-25T20:45Z,This is NOT a fake. I repeat not a fake. I will be seeding this for 24-48 hours. Enjoy and thanks ToastyxDxD for the UL.
,SykoWIzard,2010-03-26T02:08Z,Thanks for the UL
,lakiejo,2010-03-26T03:21Z,Real Real Real....why would you people say its fake?
,est1307,2010-03-26T12:26Z,"Because there was copies up'd yesterday morning on many public searchs that were fake, using the same title and description as this one. Thats why. I take my Ghost Hunters seriously and dont want someone to get a bad copy. This is a GREAT copy, Great Vid, audio is fine in mono. "
,FreakyBrit,2010-03-26T15:49Z,I don't know why but only the first maybe 5 seconds of audio work on this for me???
[T],Knaster,2010-03-28T18:19Z,"est1307 I hate ppl like you being an ass. If you havent checked the damn thing DONT SCREAM FAKE. 

JĂ¤vla idioter"
,est1307,2010-04-01T10:44Z,"hey  Knaster, why not suck my CÂ§$K. from what I see your the idiot here. Back up, sit down and act like you need to be, baby boy.."
