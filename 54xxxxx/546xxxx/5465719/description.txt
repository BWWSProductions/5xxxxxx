This is the story of the last few years of the notorious bank robber John

him happier. Living openly in 1930s Chicago, he had the run of the city with

Frechette with whom he falls deeply in love. In parallel we meet Melvin Purvis, 
the FBI agent who would eventually track Dillinger down. The FBI was is in its 
early days and Director J. Edgar Hoover was keen to promote the clean cut image 
that so dominated the organization through his lifetime. Purvis realizes that 
if he is going to get Dillinger, he will have to use street tactics and imports 
appropriate men with police training. Dillinger is eventually betrayed by an 
acquaintance who tells the authorities just where to find him on a given nighT
