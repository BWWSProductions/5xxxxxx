,Vossiej,2010-03-31T22:42Z,Also the screen turns green sometimes
[T],renman,2010-04-03T17:39Z,perhaps you have some codec issues or something else on your PC interfering with video as I've checked through this video properly and not experienced the issues your pointing out
,bloodfall,2011-04-01T08:01Z,"@Vossiej The quality of sound and video were perfect. It must be a problem with your codecs

@renman Nice work dude. Really amazing for people with low bandwidth. Wish you could have uploaded the earlier episodes as well :P"
