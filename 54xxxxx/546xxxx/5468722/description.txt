Making the Pacific

A behind-the-scenes look at the miniseries "The Pacific" which follows the trials and tribulations of three marines during World War II. 

Executive Producers Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Gary Goetzman and actors including Joe Mazello (Eugene Sledge), James Badge Dale (Robert Leckie) and Jon Seda (John Basilone) are featured.

Footage from the sets of the Guadalcanal, Peleliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa battles is shown.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion.
