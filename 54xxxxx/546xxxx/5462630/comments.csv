,stevemilw,2010-05-04T12:26Z,"v10 a10, no stuttering, amazing quality. This is how its meant to be! i dont know what artifacts people have been saying there are! maybe they should just get a better player, use media player classic. No stuttering or jerkyness at all."
,SnapperNZ,2010-05-19T23:57Z,2 days downloading and 11 seeds have given just 100MB. Rubbish seeding!
,karun0109,2010-05-22T00:41Z,4days and 11 hours downloading and still 10 gigs left. SEED PEOPLE!!!!!!!! SEED!!!!!!!!
,Rezrock,2010-06-04T04:18Z,"hey, can someone tell me why the movie would shutter??? I'm playing in VLC and still shutters, would it be because i m on my laptop? Thanks all"
,8rut4l,2010-06-20T12:06Z,"i  have 70+ clients and only 10 seeds,this will take a long time to download.."
,zophras,2010-08-18T20:54Z,"Why is the aspect ratio 16:9? It's supposed to be 1.85:1, not 16:9."
,OneTwoWilliams,2010-08-23T01:47Z,"Maybe the film is stuttering because your PC and/or monitor is shit and cant handle the quality of hi-res, hi-def 1080p?"
,OneTwoWilliams,2010-08-23T01:49Z,"and why is this film supposed to be in 1.85:1?, no it isn't, 16:9 is best for 1080p 1920 X 1040"
,Selbstmord,2010-08-24T20:34Z,"5 days, averaging about 5-10 seeds and 14.5GB? Shame on you for not seeding this top notch release!"
,nark0z,2010-10-22T10:29Z,We require additional seeds!
,OneTwoWilliams,2010-11-15T17:43Z,*SPOILER* He saved Ryans privates!!!
,white-hot,2010-12-30T03:33Z,"Wow, the retards are out in force!

""Could my stuttering problem be cause I'm using my laptop??"" Yeah, maybe, since you are trying to decode a rather huge bitstream with a laptop! A laptop?!?

Super clear and awesome, thanks for the up!"
,fragger5,2011-03-06T15:51Z,"@white-hot
many laptops run it perfectly"
,ronnieonetime1,2011-06-12T13:33Z,regarding download speed: Are you seeding 1 torrent or 20? Have you adjusted your upload bandwidth? There are NUMEROUS factors that affect your download speed. I had to cancel all but 1 upload in order to get a decent download speed for this. My speed jumped from 10kB/s to 440kB/s after managing my torrent client. LIVE. LEARN. EXPERIMENT with your torrent client. SEED properly!
,Bassotin,2011-06-13T09:37Z,"6core & 6950, still stutters. Somethin wrong with this file."
