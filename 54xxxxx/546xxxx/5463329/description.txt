A man uncovers some long-held secrets when he investigates a decades-old crime in this drama from filmmaker Juan JosÃ© Campanella. Ricardo DarÃ­n stars as BenjamÃ­n, a former criminal court employee who wants to write a novel about an Argentine case from the 1970s where a woman was raped and murdered. He confides his intentions to a judge with whom he's been secretly smitten for years, Irene (Soledad Villamil), but she expresses reservations about the idea, for reasons that soon become apparent. Meanwhile, flashbacks set up a parallel story, unfolding in 1970s Argentina. In that narrative, Argentina has fallen under the control of a military junta and a fair trial has become an increasingly uncommon event in that nation's courts. A woman is found raped and murdered while her husband was at work, and two immigrant workers are essentially forced into confessing to the crime. Back in the present day, BenjamÃ­n teams up with his colleague and friend, the lush Sandoval (Guillermo Francella), and the two go about identifying and tagging the perpetrator of the original crime. Subtle detail in a photograph alerts Benjamin to the possibility that a man named GÃ³mez (Javier Godino) may have been the real culprit, but finding GÃ³mez and obtaining conclusive evidence against him is no simple task. Moreover, as BenjamÃ­n and GÃ³mez struggle to have the case reopened, they also find that bureaucracy and power in Argentine government have made this close to impossible. (Mark Deming)
