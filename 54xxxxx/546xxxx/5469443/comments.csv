,PyroUki,2011-01-28T00:18Z,"I downloaded this torrent and couldn't get discs 1-4 to work on my modded ps2. 

( I use HD Loader by the way and burn with alcohol 120% )

I did get G.U. Vol. 1 to play but now G.U Vol. 2 wont play.. :( I've read that the 1st 4 disks of dot hack have issues playing when copied. 
I've also read that the G.U copied volumes shouldn't have a problem playing. 

My Question is.. has anyone gotten GU vol. 2 to play? if yes.. could you explain how you did this. I appreciate and am thankful for any ones time :)"
,dothackjhe,2011-05-20T05:50Z,"Keep seeding please. . =3

Will be commenting on how the dot.hack//G.U. series go. I'm already halfway the download process. 

I read somewhere that ImgBurn (freeware) is a good burning software for PS2 games especially when burning speed is set to 4x. "
,ChronicAddict,2011-06-17T08:25Z,I hope the creator realizes that many people including myself won't bother to seed this.  You RARtards need to get out of the 90's.  After I extract it the rar files will be GONE!
,rafominas,2011-06-23T23:37Z,"fuck this torrent
super slow
and they were all currupted"
,n00b_king,2011-06-25T09:17Z,"I don't normally ask this but.
please seed or please link me to a better torrent"
,IronyBolt,2011-07-23T20:18Z,"Thanks a lot for this, thenoobish.
G.U. games are all working fine. The only problem is with G.U. 2. After you play it for 5-6 times it will start freezing in the opening scene. But if you burn the game again in another DVD it will work again (for 5-6 times)."
,PDreamweaver,2011-08-11T21:09Z,Does any one else have the problem with there being a password on the files?  I cant' seem to get rid of the password to access them so my PS2 emulator will read the files I can't even extract them with out there being a faital error.  Is there a password or do I have to junk the folder and find different torrents?
,syuvial,2011-08-17T04:18Z,"I will download this. And if i can get them all to work, i will but reupping WITHOUT the stupid split rars."
,xenosaga01,2011-08-20T03:35Z,Anyone happen to have the Original Anime Dvd that came with Dot Hack Infection? I lost my copy and really want to watch it again...........
