Haru Basho 2010
Day 15, FINAL!!!

from the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium
 in Namba, Osaka, Japan

Original â€“ MPG From S-Cable source

A very exciting finish to what was supposed to be a boring tournament... lopsided without the â€œBad Boyâ€ â€“ Asashoryu.  But NO!  This finish might prove to be a rebirth in Sumo that hasnâ€™t happened since the days of Akebono and the Hawaiians!
See you in May (May 9th or 10th, 2010) for the Summer (Natsu) Basho.  Seek the next tournament out from me Bumfluff @;
