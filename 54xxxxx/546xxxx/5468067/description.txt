NOTE: As some of you have noticed, no one was able to capture HDTV stream of Real Time second week in the row. Last week's show was released maybe two days ago and today I have decided to encode only one available: plain, cable capture... as farewell to this show. Nevertheless, even if such shows always have been kicked-out of my schedule 'cause of their unreliability or/and unavailability, I would, in the future, re-encode RTwBM every time when decent HDTV become available.
