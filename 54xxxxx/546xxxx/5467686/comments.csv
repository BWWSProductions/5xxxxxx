""lazy uploader""????????

man are you barking up the wrong torrent. Of ALL uploaders you could insult with that ridiculous crap (fingers too tired to type? never mastered teh google?), you pick one of the most prolific, dependable teams working today. Guess they were too busy uploading fresh stuff....too busy INCLUDING subtitles for nearly ALL their releases....to bother putting in a link that would have taken you 2 or 3 seconds to post yourself. Those lazy bastards! Geezus, lol :P

 Anyway - thx FXG, much appreciated (and thx to fleetkid & all seeders too)!"
