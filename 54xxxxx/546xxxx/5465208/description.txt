Irish Driver Theory Test 4th Edition Revised May 2009


Was looking for this for a while so here you are 

Tested and Working


This cd detects the use of virtual SCSI cd drives. NOT working with PowerISO, Magic ISO and Daemon Tools (standard). Will NOT work burnt to disk


It does however work perfectly with a virtual IDE drive. (see instructions)


1) Download  a working copy of Daemon tools PRO (needs to be pro) 
   is currently working perfectly just follow the instructions

2)Extract this torrent using winrar 

3)Open your copy of daemon tools PRO 

4)In the panel marked virtual CD/DVD Devices right click and select "add IDE Virtual Drive"

5)Double click the new drive and select TODTT_2009.iso in the dialog box

6)Right click the drive choose file explorer

7) Navigate to Install and run setup.exe

8) Accept the prompts 

9)launch from start menu should be working perfectly!! :)
