Australia Race
Jake Humphrey presents coverage of the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne, the second race of the 2010 Formula 1 season. The previous two races at Albert Park have been won by a Briton, with Jenson Button first across the line last year and Lewis Hamilton victorious in 2008. However, this year the British pair will also have to contend with returning legend Michael Schumacher, back in F1 after a three-year hiatus. With commentary from Jonathan Legard and Martin Brundle.
