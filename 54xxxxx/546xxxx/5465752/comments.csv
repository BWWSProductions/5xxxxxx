,rholland81,2010-04-18T17:26Z,"hey when i try to load this i get the blue screen #002 error.  not sure if i have the right ios's installed for this 1.  just wondering which ios's i should have and if there are any other things i should try.  is it possible to get this error just from not having the wii motion plus plugged in?  im on softmod 4.2u, using neogamma r8 or softchip and they both do the same thing"
,rholland81,2010-04-18T18:02Z,"ok nevermind, i had to use the alt.dol and play the wii motion plus video and now it works perfectly.  sweet game, thanks markuf"

,anon1978,2011-09-15T21:50Z,"I'm having the same problem as heltonbillyw, and luisynayan.

The game starts to load, then goes back to the Wii main menu.

(Using USB Loader GX.  Also tried with uLoader.  Wii 4.3u CIOS 249)

Any advice is much appreciated."
,Zoltic101,2011-09-23T23:10Z,:D awesome
,deamonicus,2011-12-20T16:50Z,"to all of those having trouble launching this game via a loader, go into your loader settings, ill use usb loader as an example, in settings make sure block ios reload is set to ""on"", direct your loader to use ios 249. use ""prompt at launch"" boot dol type and select ""alternate.dol"". the wii motion plus vids will ensue, after that itll boot you back to the wii menu, just use your loader to launch the game, this time it will work. "
