@Jaysolee

Re-read the 'Crack' -part in the Installation Guide of HELS. You forgot to replace the original .exe with the Cracked one.

You should extract the files using WinRar, which can be downloaded here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5338920
Otherwise you'll get that error. So extract using WinRar and then redo the installation.


@Geek307

First of all, our Live Support has moved to www.games4theworld.org
You forgot to apply the Crack. Copy the Crack (.exe) to: C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 High End Loft Stuff

For Mac related problems, please refer to our Forum at: www.games4theworld.bestgoo.com 

@Breaksley

 Please open the .rar file you downloaded using only WinRar, which can be downloaded from www.games4theworld.org . (If you use any other software than WinRar, like WinZip or 7-zip, the files will get messed up!)
When you've opened the file using WinRar, select Ã¡ll the files in it and drag & drop them to a folder on your Desktop. When the extraction is done, close the .rar file and open the folder on your Desktop. 
Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!

,aeristilheartly,2012-05-22T21:47Z,"ALRIGHT listen up here people who are having problems, this is what you do!!!!

Make sure you have DAEMON TOOLS!
This is what you mount to, you can download Daemon Tools Lite for FREE at the download website.


Unrar/unzip everything and mount into your daemon tools when instructed.
Some DO NOT NEED DAEMON TOOLS!  In this case, just open the SETUP application and run it.


Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

THIS IS KEY! 

If you crack ANYTHING during your installs you will make it so NONE of them work and you might even have problems REMOVING them as they won't even UNINSTALL correctly


UPDATE WHEN ASKED
it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!

,raerae94,2012-06-09T10:32Z,Epic torrent. 100% legit. I love getting your torrents.
,dolfijn96,2012-06-18T17:13Z,"Please help me!
I first installed Sims 3 (of Games4theworld), that worked fine.
Then I wanted to install World Adventures (also from Games4theworld), I couldn't start the game anymore, because the launcher froze when I started it.
In the comments user 'Games4theworld' said, if you had this problem, download High End Loft Stuff, of Games4theworld, so you would have the latest version of Sims 3.
Problem: I can't update, ever since I downloaded World Adventures, so I did that manual. My game is at the moment 3.6.6.008001 and it still isn't compatible. I'm really desperate, because I'm trying for the last couple of days!
Please, help."

,makedonka11,2012-06-26T08:48Z,"so, let's get this straight. i install all of the expansions of sims 3, in the order they were made, meaning katy perrys sweet treats the last. and i dont aplly any of the crack, just instal them all. and when i instal the last, i aplly the crack from that last expansion, right? and it should work? i'm asking cause i havent downloaded them all, but i'm in the process i just wanna know is this the right way to do it. :D "
,iEirikra,2012-07-02T07:12Z,this doesn't work on Mac! It won't install.
,nexita,2012-07-05T04:02Z,I tryed to follow the installation guide but when it starts the instalation it says that there is some files missing and to search then to continue the download...
,obicera_trifectis,2012-07-11T19:59Z,"Hey, Mac users! If you're getting the ""can't verify the integrity of the installer"" message, there's an easy fix!

I'm still in the process of following aeristilheartly's guide, so I haven't verified that this works fully, but I did manage to run the installer.

Most of the expansions are running from disk images (.iso, .dmg, etc.), but this one is just files when you decompress the .rar.

I realized that the installer was probably looking for a disk image, so I fired up Disk Utility (comes with Mac OS, should be in /Applications/Utilities, otherwise search for it) and made a disk image from the folder (File > New > Disk Image from Folder) that was generated from the .rar.

Once I ran the installer from the disk image, it seemed to install normally. Here's me crossing my fingers that it'll work once I've got all the expansion packs in."
