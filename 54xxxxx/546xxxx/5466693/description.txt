I was board and so I remember I really liked the graphics of final fantasy 13 when it came out so I did some extensive searching and I came across some awesome pictures that I wanted to share with you guys. 

I spent at least 3 hours of searching guys please be respectful and if you found a picture please comment below and Ill be glad to post more because in the title it says "1.00" so ill do some revisions with the torrent

please keep on seeding and have a great day with your new final fantasy XIII pictures and wallpapers.

Please Comment!
