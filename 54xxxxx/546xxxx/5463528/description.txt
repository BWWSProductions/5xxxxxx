Hereâ€™s a dvdrip of a new movie that premiered at the Sundance festival that looks relatively interesting. Apparently a â€œpresent-day film noirâ€ film, so that caught my attention. Quality looks great so enjoy.



Synopsis: Private detective John Rosow is hired to tail a man on a train from Chicago to Los Angeles. Rosow gradually uncovers the manâ€™s identity as a missing person; one of the thousands presumed dead after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Persuaded by a large reward, Rosow is charged with bringing the missing person back to his wife in New York City
