,dj-crypto,2010-08-31T22:17Z,"Just tested this out on my 2005 W211 E-class, which just had an NTG1 and trunk drive installed today, upgraded from an Audio 50 APS.

Works like a charm!

Burnt with Mac OS X 10.6.4 Disk Utility"
,dj-crypto,2010-08-31T22:19Z,"@havatt

Probably won't, as far as I know the ML has Tele Atlas maps, while the W211 has Navteq, but I'm not sure.

Also, judging by the date of your car, you should have an NTG 2.5 Comand installed.
You definately have that, if you have the verison with built-in 30GB harddrive, and the SD-card slot above your DVD slot."
,robnew,2010-09-17T19:18Z,"hi, my car is a 2003 W211 class E, and my questions is, do i need to upgrade from an audio 50 APS first  or can i put the Mercedes Benz Nav-DVD Comand APS Europa v. 10.0 NTG1 without upgrade my system?"
,Kivenpaskoja,2011-07-10T20:06Z,"Wont work in my CLS, the installation isnt even loaded 1/4 and then the thing just shuts off, and when i start it again it works but it still got the old maps. WHAT SHUT I DO?"

You have to remove the old DVD from the navigation DVD drive in the boot (trunk) of the car and replace the DVD. If you use the DVD in the DVD player in the car, it will not work.
I hope this will help you.

Someone have the v11 NTG1?"
