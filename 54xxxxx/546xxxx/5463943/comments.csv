,Tainan,2010-03-25T23:53Z,"Thanks JW.

My money says maria has 5 cats."
[T],jwhitt62,2010-03-26T00:16Z,"..at least 5...

Is anyone else having problems with TPB. My anti-virus software has found viruses just by going into the site, not ever downloading anything. And you I can't upload anything."
,thunderbum,2010-03-26T02:08Z,"I've not had the virus problems you describe, but have had a few other problems. Mostly I've had a problem with pop-ups, but had a devil of a time 2 weeks back when an exploit in an older version of Acrobat was utilized to tunnel through and drop a f'n piece of of hostageware and execute it.

It disabled my A/V and kept taking me to their home site so that I'd 'have to' buy a key to unlock their f'n software and give me back control of my computer.

I Googled the name of the hostageware 'anti-virus' and lo and behold I was able to clean out the problem myself. Filled the APPDATA folder with literally hundreds of .exes that were self-replicating... which in turn screwed up several Windows folders and messed the registry. Took my about 45 minutes to clean everything up. I feel sorry about those who automatically paid for the key.

I still get a shitload of portscans from the same 6 IPs. Oddly enough my A/V reports everything's clean, anti-trojan reports everything's clean, no rootkits, nothing showing but every once in a while when I go into the APPDATA folder the firewall lights up.

What virii is your A/V showing?"
[T],Quazza,2010-03-26T02:08Z,"the site is buggy lately

i havent seen any viruses though, but they could be lurking about"
[T],Quazza,2010-03-26T02:11Z,"thunderbum

that virus is called ""vundo"" and it's one of the really annoying ones

vundofix should do the trick if you encounter it next time"

,ItBitTorrent,2010-03-26T03:52Z,"AVG antivirus lists The Pirate Bay as ""Risky: This page contains the potential for active threat delivery"". But that doesn't stop me.... never did, never will. 

Carry on JW you are a modern day patriot. "
[S],velvet.,2010-03-26T03:55Z,AVG is a shitty anti-virus used by noobs only.
,fizdude,2010-03-26T05:21Z,"You rock J, thanks a lot!!"
,ItBitTorrent,2010-03-26T05:23Z,"Velvet, in your infinite wisdom, perhaps you could share your AV insight. I only recently started using AVG after experience with Norton, Mcafee, Panda, Kaspersky to name a few. IMO they're pretty much all the same, just packaged differently.

,Moodscapes,2010-03-26T06:47Z,"Thanks again JW. 18+ states are now filing suit against the Obamanation health care bill, as well as numerous citizens. You gotta love the power of democracy! It also goes to show how short-sighted these libs are. They make decisions based on emotion rather than carefully planned logic. Most of them have layed their political careers on the line for this bill and for Obama. I can't wait for mid-term election time in November. Go Rush!!!"
,currysteph,2010-03-26T08:01Z,thanks man
,Johannes58,2010-03-26T17:51Z,"Thanks jwhitt, 
Moodscapes.. I hope you know we don't have a ""Democracy"".. That is a term Democrats love to say so often that many have come to accept it.
We are suppose to have a ""Republic""... but it looks like we really have neither.  Seems what we have is an ""Oligarchy""... Reference passage of H. R. 3200... Time to educate the Patriots!"
,saturn.uc,2010-03-26T19:54Z,"That is correct.  The USA is supposed to be a Representative Republic, as defined by the Constitution."
,darkencypher,2010-03-26T20:15Z,"Yes, I NEVER go on the piratebay without Adblock Plus running on Firefox.  Never come here on internet explorer.  This place is LOADED with garbage that will infect your computer.  Thanks for the up, jwhitt."
,booboo332,2010-03-27T07:59Z,"Does anyone besides those who seem incapable of learning how installing software even use IE anymore?  I think most of us have at least one relative like this.  You know the type.  They always seem to be calling for help with their computer but seem incapable of following the advice given.  :p

Thanks to the uploader for the show."
