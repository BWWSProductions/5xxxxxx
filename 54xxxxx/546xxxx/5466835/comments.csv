Thanks."
,kirill539,2010-03-27T20:41Z,"If you would like, I can. I have an excellent audio converter.

But that's going to be a huge size! Probably about 15-18 GBs, so if I were to upload it, then I'd need a lot of help from you or whoever else could at least leech it. My maximum upload speed is only 120 kbps. I'll deal with this torrent, and in 2-3 weeks, I promise you I;ll upload FLAC. :)"
,gHighway,2010-03-27T23:48Z,"Kirill539, thanks for the quick response. I would very much appreciate a FLAC upload. I will give you as much help as I can (my upload is around 80 kbps - but I can upload 24/7, so not a problem - anyone else out there want to help out?).

With respect to the size, again I am used to downloads that size and happy to download over a period of time.

Thanks again.."
