I'll be setting up a second seed location later to increase upload speeds."

,bungiefan,2011-12-31T21:45Z,"Nope, as listed in the comments for that, I had a hard drive crash. I had to redownload myself from the torrent and I only have 99% of it. I can rerip the discs, but that means I'd have to remake the torrent. That will be a matter of when I have time."
