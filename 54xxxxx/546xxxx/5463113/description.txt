This is a file dump of the contents of the HDD partition after FFXI is installed. A few files are non-copyable, and thus not included. The version of uLaunchELF that can read/write the HDD partitions is included, and you can use it with uLaunchELF.

The purpose of this torrent is to make the DAT files available for people to examine and modify, as can already be done with the PC version. The files appear to be different though, as install of the PC files for FFXIStyle and FFXICartography break the game.

This is NOT a means to install the game on a PS2 without an install disc, as vital files won't copy.It is purely to make the files available to those who have the ability and knowledge to analyze and modify them, in the interest of giving PS2 players the same customization abilities PC players have.

These are the files from the March 22nd 2010 version of the game.

Contact me on some of the major IM programs under the same username as here if you figure out how any of these files work and can be modified.
