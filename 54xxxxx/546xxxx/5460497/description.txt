I just bought it and want to share it with all you fans!
I recently found this band by listening to a cover of Another Girl Another Planet by Blink182. The original from The Only Ones is so much better and now I love them! So I went on and bought this CD which I couldn't find anywhere!

This album was released in 9 March 1979 but the last 2 extra songs that were added in this version(released in 2009) are composed in 2009!!!!

So if you have more from The Only Ones and can upload some more stuff(like a discography) drop me a message!

It's ripped in 320kbps OGG Vorbis.
