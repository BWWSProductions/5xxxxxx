I have worked out where all you have to do

is double click this and it will bring up

a 'WGA Fixer' and then install the other DLL


NOW HEAR THIS!!

Since this harmless BUT ANTI-Viruses know

that this shouldn't happen they WILL flag it

as a 'PUP' or 'Generic-Like virus' 

But nonetheless it is in an executable that

will elevate the hassle on what to do, so

now even a noob that just installed an OS

without a legit key would know what to do.


It has been created with WinRAR Corporate

so if you do not trust me then extract it 

and run the individual components themselves
