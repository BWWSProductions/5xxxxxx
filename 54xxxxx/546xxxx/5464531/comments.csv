Try downloading Microsoft Security Essentials, and it will validate OK.

Thanks"

Glad I finally found one that works."
,fende3,2010-03-30T03:03Z,Looks like I take back my previous comment. After a day Windows is back to being unactivated. Reapplying the patch does nothing.

ive had that happen to me
also. i own a computer
shop and i use this all the
time to reduce the cost 
for customers. if it doesn't
work the first time, start
in safe mode and run it,
it should work even if it
has been detected as
non-genuine already!"
