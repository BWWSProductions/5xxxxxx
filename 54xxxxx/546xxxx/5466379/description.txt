10 years ago an epic new feeling was sweeping dance floors across the globe. Hands in the air, eyes closed and pure elation; Trance music had arrived. One brand came forward that perfectly captured the experience, taking the cream of the genre and allowing people to take it home with them for the first time. Euphoria was born, changing the lives of thousands forever.

10 years on and Trance music has amassed a phenomenal repertoire of seminal tunes, tracks that make hairs stand and send shivers down the spine. Euphoria returns to mark this anniversary with the definitive collection- if you were to only own one Trance album this would be it.

3 CDs featuring the masterpieces from Faithless, Chicane, Paul Van Dyk, TiÃ«sto, Rui Da Silva, Fragma, Ian Van Dahl, Darude, Underworld, ATB, Agnelli & Nelson, Robert Miles and so many more. The names by themselves however cannot do it justice, as only a Euphoria album mixes them in such a way to produce a seamless, Euphoric listening experience. Euphoria. For the mind, body, and soul.
