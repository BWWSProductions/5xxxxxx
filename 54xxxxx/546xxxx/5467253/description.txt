FFl's first, and best release. The soundtrack of 1984 at Jemmett rd college in Ashford, Kent. The second track has a horrendous scratch at the start, but I left it in so the e.p is complete. Converted with 'spin it again' software. Uploaded from Egypt on a v.slow connection so be patient and seed! OBie.
