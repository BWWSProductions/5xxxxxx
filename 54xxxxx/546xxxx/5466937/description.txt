Video Source: IMAGiNE (THANKS FRIENDS & KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!)
Audio Source: OUR OWN LiNE.

Well, we usually don't do V2's, but IMAGiNE'S video was far better than ours & we had some nice LiNE. Not much work done to the video, as it didn't need it. We also made our audio sound better than our 1st release. Hope you all enjoy!=]
