,afghanballer,2010-04-11T20:46Z,Hi. XRG there is a slight problem with the subtitles in this movie. The last 15-25 minutes maybe the subtitles are shown way to early before they even say the dialogue. I don't speak hindi and therefore the ending kind of ruined it for me. But do you have another .srt file that works perfectly with this movie?
,afghanballer,2010-04-11T20:47Z,"Video=10
Audio=10
Subtitles=7 Last 20-30 minutes subtitles are way ahead of the dialogue."
,karnabk,2010-12-02T03:18Z,"I have enjoys all your BDRips but halfway through, the sound stops for this rip. I used ASUS O Play Media Player. I don't know if VLC would do the same if played in computer. "
