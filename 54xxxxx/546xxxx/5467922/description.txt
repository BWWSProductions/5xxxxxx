Wikipedia - The Irrestible Cathy Dennis is a compilation album by British singer Cathy Dennis. It was released on a budget label. It was noticeable for the fact that many tracks are missing, including some of Cathy's biggest sellers: "C'mon and Get My Love" (with D Mob). - "That's the Way of the World" (with D Mob) - "Why" (with D Mob) 
Album songs where included to make up for the lack of songs, mainly from Cathy's last album. The album also contained album version of tracks as opposed to the single remixes. Because of the lack of a complete singles collection, and the fact that album contained no unreleased tracks from her unreleased album "Inspiration" or any of the rare Japanese tracks, many fans saw the album as cash in. The album appeared online to download in 2007.
