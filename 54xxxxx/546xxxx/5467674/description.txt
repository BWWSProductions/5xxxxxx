HARDWARE DRIVER 

one file


This driver is for the Siig AP-10 SCSI Pro PCI card. I had great difficulty finding this driver, because this device is discontinued.  This is the official driver and it didn't freeze or crash my PC. It is not digitally signed, so windows will alert you. Don't let the .exe scare you, It is a self-extracting archive.


I can't seed forever, so please help me out.
