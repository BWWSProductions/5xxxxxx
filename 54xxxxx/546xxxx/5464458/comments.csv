,pelmeen,2010-04-05T15:38Z,"Technically it is episode 13, so dont miss it. Download this before ep. 13, if you dont want to miss one episode."
,Julosz,2010-07-06T16:20Z,"This is episode 13! Because the uploader put 11 and 12 together in one episode, he made a mistake by naming this 12. But it definately is episode 13!"
