Four short movies from the brazilian director RogÃ©rio Sganzerla, very known for your association with brazilian Cinema Marginal ideas. 
From the early shots to the last experiments.

DocumentÃ¡rio, 1966

In Sganzerla's first short, we are already able to glimpse his genius. Altough it is called "Documentary", it isnt really a documentary, but it may suddently become one. It is about two friends roaming around the streets of SÃ£o Paulo, discussing their lack of money, their
bored days and most of all their will to see a movie. After many refferences to Saraceni, Fuller, Lester, Welles, Reed and many others, which shows both the characters' and Sganzerla's love for cinema, they end up not seeing anything and they start to discuss (without audio/video synch) the movie we are watching, and the difficulty they had in making it. This is a movie on the borderline between fiction and documentary, and deeply metalinguistic: a film about movies and about making movies (including itself).by amoeba

Brasil, 1981

A musical journey trough Brazil, centering on JoÃ£o Gilberto and the recordings of his 1981 homonymous album. But as it is expected from Sganzerla, this is not a typical documentary. The director seems to gather images sugested by JoÃ£o Gilberto's music, which makes him travel through Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, the recording studio, Joe Carioca's movies (link) and Orson Welles images on Brazil (one of Sganzerla's obsessions). No audio/video synch, no dialogue, only images poetic and three songs: "Aquarela do Brasil" (by Ary Barroso), "Bahia com H" (by Denis Brean) and "No Tabuleiro da Baiana" (by Ary Barroso), sung by JoÃ£o Gilberto, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Maria BetÃ¢nia. by amoeba

Perigo Negro, 1993

Filmed at the Flamengo soccer club in Rio de Janeiro, a fan narrates the trajectory of a soccer player. Perigo Negro was a great athlete with a highly unusual and personal soccer style. Yet, despite his sports genius on the field, he never attained financial success or the idolatry of the crowd. Based on a fragment of Oswald de Andrade's projected (and unfinished) five-volume "mural novel" Marco Zero. duke.edu
