,S3nd41,2010-06-10T21:31Z,Is this HDTV?
,S3nd41,2010-06-10T23:14Z,"Miserable rip: 624x352, don't download it!"
,whraglyn,2010-06-28T19:33Z,"@S3nd41,
Sorry mate; The wife and I find this UL to be, in the words of the immortal Sheriff Andy Taylor, Juuust Fiiine.
On my 24"" monitor the video is crystal clear, which is obviously the intention of the ULer.
I see no claims about HD, DVDRip, Blu-Ray, 720p, 1080p, or any other sort, by the ULer.
You may note it is listed, quite correctly, in TV Shows, not in DVDrip, nor in Hi-Res, which means we have no right to expect whatever standard of perfection you desire, then rag on it cuz it does not meet same.
Lighten up, my friend.
V=10
A=10
Thx again, mcdirty20! Plz keep em coming!
Cheers, all!

OHMYGOD!  My GF didn't wake me up this morning with a BJ!  I should dump her right now!!!

Get a clue you fucking moron.  Thanks for the upload mcdirty."
,fallout11,2010-12-12T22:47Z,"Solid rip, raunchy yet witty show. Love it! Thanks mcdirty20."
,fallout11,2010-12-12T22:48Z,"Solid rip, thanks mcdirty20."
,M15f17,2011-01-06T20:20Z,"Great rip, just wondering why 2 of the 10 eps are around 500 MBs each and the rest are 175?"
,{me},2011-01-09T10:20Z,"Yeah you should dump her, Frank. Bitch should know better by now."
,jcrboy,2011-01-12T22:27Z,"@M15f17

Was wondering the same thing... For the sake of consistency I may just nab the other torrent that has a consistent file size. All props to the ULer, though. It is choice that truly makes this site a wonderful place."
,ivaldirr,2011-03-03T20:02Z,thx ;)
,cpnquirk,2011-03-04T05:30Z,"@M15f17 and jcrboy 

How 'bout we do a bit of right-click detective work and check the resolution in those two files. What's that- 720x1280 frame size!!??? Why we's gotst ourselves HD vidya boyz! I wonder if higher resolution could have absolutely anything to do with larger file size. Nah, probably not.

And @S3nd41- You're a tool. That's SD and cartoons don't need high resolution. Moron."
,Ghostwork,2011-03-12T18:44Z,"very solid upload, but i couldn't convert episode 7.  i don't know if anyone else had the problem.

everything else is top though."
,chandlerboy,2011-05-02T08:41Z,Episode 7 had no sound for me.
,S3nd41,2011-05-18T11:41Z,@cpnquirk: It doesn't need to be in HD if you're going to watch it on a crappy laptop screen. Try watching something lower than 720p on a 55 inch screen before you come troll. That applies to the rest of you.
,S3nd41,2011-05-18T11:57Z,Finally a decent rip of both seasons @ http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6349322/Archer_Seasons_1_amp_2___720p_mkv_compression_%5BmkvGOD%5D go download it and watch the difference trolls. And the file sizes are even smaller than this. Definitely the ripper is someone that knew what he was doing.
,m2brier,2011-09-24T00:55Z,comments on this torrent are some of the best i've ever read.  big ups lads
,cruiseon,2011-11-12T12:23Z,"U dont need HD for cartoons thats 16 colours bro
LOL"
,mirex0_0,2012-04-06T19:55Z,"V/A 10/10 - it's a cartoon

Thanks"
