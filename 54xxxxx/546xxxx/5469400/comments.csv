,jorrell0733,2010-03-29T17:57Z,"RE: majinhurricane. If you read the torrent properly, you would have noticed that i said i WILL be uploading the qualifying & Race next weekend, just that it will be delayed until Sunday evening. Fuck darmeth! He isnt here anymore, so either be grateful of my torrent, or keep your comments to yourself dude!"
