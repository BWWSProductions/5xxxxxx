,cirkin50,2010-05-24T02:18Z,seed pls
,mrvain32,2010-05-25T12:49Z,Till last week there were 100 seeds then suddenly it dropped to 11. Don't know why!!! I'm surprised too. Sorry.
,WushuTricks,2010-05-29T02:45Z,"Are these original or the crappy 1998 remasters?

Also why didn't you encode these in V0 VBR? Every player supports it now and it's much better than CBR in terms of space and quality."
,mrvain32,2010-05-29T14:35Z,"@ WushuTricks : Please read the torrent description. This is the most comprehensive data of Iron Maiden available on TPB. Download if you like,ignore if you dont. If you want higher quality pls buy the original cd's and support the artist."
,commijew,2010-06-23T06:26Z,"My good sir, it is people like you who restore my faith in humanity. Thank you. "
,mrvain32,2010-06-23T08:08Z,@ commijew  : Woah ! Thanks dude.
,bentrom,2010-07-15T06:45Z,"As odd as it may sound, i am downloading this specifically for the album art, as i prefer to support the artist by purchasing the albums, but great upload and thanks for the high quality art!"
,mrvain32,2010-07-17T08:12Z,@ bentrom : Nice to know that you liked the covers. If you need more artwork then please let me know. I\'ve atleast 100 more of it.
,BrainStew40,2010-08-18T17:13Z,AWESOME UP!!! I dig the quality. I will crank it  till my ears bleed.

,vivalasamx,2010-09-26T06:23Z,"a couple hours for four and a half gigs. great download speed, beautiful torrent. thanks dude! greatly appreciated."
,erdbeer,2010-11-08T21:50Z,i can only listen to this after low-pass-filtering the music.. there's some noise at about 14khz in most of the songs...... drives me mad!
,TheMetis,2010-12-21T18:25Z,What's up with the Soundhouse Tapes? The original has only 3 tracks. Can you provide more information on this?
,Aryires,2010-12-25T10:52Z,"I, for one, would be  e x t r e m e l y  interested for the artwork collection you mention! If you could provide me with more information for downloading I'd be forever grateful!"
,mrvain32,2010-12-26T15:10Z,"@ vivalasamx

Thanks for your comments."
,mrvain32,2010-12-26T15:12Z,"@ erdbeer

Well I heard almost every song in this I didn't find any major prob with the sound files. Anyways I don't have technical knowledge as you so just do this : Don't download!!"
,mrvain32,2010-12-26T15:15Z,"@ TheMetis

Well If you go inside the ""bonus"" folder you'll find full version of the soundhouse album. I don't know why you got only 3 songs. Download properly."
,mrvain32,2010-12-26T15:18Z,"@ Aryires

I'd love to give u those artworks. Should I make a torrent for it? Lemme know I'll do as u like."
,Aryires,2010-12-27T00:03Z,"@ mrvain32:

Yes, a torrent would probably be the way to go. Plus, it will give others the opportunity to download it. Really, thank you very much!"
,mrvain32,2010-12-27T16:47Z,"@ Aryires

Just give me a couple of days to do it. But I wont keep the torrent alive for long coz such things should go to the deserving person only. Anyways I'll inform you when it's up."
,Aryires,2010-12-28T16:46Z,"@ mrvain32:

OK!"
,mrvain32,2011-01-25T19:25Z,I'll up it by tomorrow. 26th to be precise.

,O0oo0,2011-06-11T08:17Z,"This (how mrvain32 has done it here) is the way to list a discography!

Full information, studio albums separated from compilations separated from live separated from bonus material. Perfect!

If the files are tagged as well as the download info is compiled I'll go from greatly impressed to massively impressed.

Thanks mrvain32. Well done."
