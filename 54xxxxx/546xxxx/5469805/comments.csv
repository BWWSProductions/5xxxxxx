When I saw how many people connected to you in initial seeding I thought this one might die.So thanks for sticking with it.I'll seed extra if seeds are still low when I'm done."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-29T06:59Z,"@Nadyenka: You are too kind. It is more like A2/V3. Guys from MPAA just compared my encoding to future BluRay and gave A1/V1.2... and these are true experts and send me a mail few minutes ago. And you have beaten them!
So, thank you!
Es?especially when I know for sure that 2032 MB big IMAGINE TS (what was my input) in that case get A0.1/V0.1 from expert like you surely are.
Kudos!"

,lilars26,2010-03-29T15:45Z,@20-40 You can't expect the MPAA to give you a fair judgement.This is a very good TS and to compare it to a Blue ray that does not yet exist is a little bit unfair.

[V],twentyforty,2010-03-29T19:18Z,"@lilars: Most of my sarcasm cannot be seen on the first run. But, glad you make it...  not on the sexual way, of course."
,lilars26,2010-03-29T20:43Z,"HaHa very funny.But you're right.It took me a few readings to catch the obvious sarcasm.Still love ya,not that there's anything wrong with that."
