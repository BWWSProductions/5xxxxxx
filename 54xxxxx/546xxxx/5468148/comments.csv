[V],polisdavid,2010-03-27T21:54Z,THANK YOU SEEDERS!!  ;-)
,lopiko69,2010-03-27T22:05Z,does not work'...  
,albinoz,2010-03-27T22:37Z,"Thanks the share,
Works for me"
[V],polisdavid,2010-03-27T23:01Z,"lopiko69,

be sure to copy the lib file to /usr/local/lib.  I used file buddy, but you can also use the terminal to copy it.

Alternatively, install MTR 3.0r14m http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4028007/MacTheRipper_3.0r14m.dmg, and the try again.

[T],frankie-boy,2010-03-27T23:28Z,"The included instructions worked for me. I had v3 already installed.

Thanks for the upload."
,invintive,2010-03-28T07:09Z,"Hey, Thanks a bunch! Worked great! Nice simple instructions.

But I wanted to add that noobs can use onyx to show hidden folders for one of those last steps where you replace a file in /usr/local/lib.

Also, can you no longer do a title only extraction? Where you only extract the movie or specific episode. 

Again thanks!"
,xushi,2010-03-28T13:03Z,The libdvdCSS.mpkg package that we need to install only has the libraries for 10.4 and 10.5... What about us on 10.6? I didn't install it and was wondering :/
,invintive,2010-03-28T21:03Z,"Just install them both, that's what I did. Works like a charm on my OS 10.6.2!"
,wveeser1,2010-03-29T05:15Z,Help a Noobie..  I used onyx to show hidden folders.  Still can't find usr Folder.  Where is it supposed to be after i unhide it?  What are the instructions for using the terminal to place the file in usr/local/lib folder.  Thanks in advance
,invintive,2010-03-29T07:32Z,"Go to you finder, press shift+command+g then type /usr/ and hit ""go"". Should take you there. Then navigate to /local/lib/"
,invintive,2010-03-29T07:32Z,*your finder
,invintive,2010-03-29T07:34Z,"Actually, you don't even need onyx if you use the above technique :^)"
,negativethree,2010-04-05T01:49Z,Thanks!
,Dogbiker,2010-04-30T12:31Z,"Works well. 

I installed it on 10.6.3 without having a previous version.

Great job - thanks!"
,leighjo2,2010-08-03T05:59Z,I don't understand how to replace the MTR4 with the kracked? 
,coyote298,2010-09-02T02:49Z,Thanks!!! :D

Thank You.

Whats going on and how to I fix this?"
,nrowe46,2010-11-19T22:18Z,When attempting to upgrade to MTR 4.2 it reverted to the email mentioned previously or the message about not a registered copy. How do you upgrade?
,amandapants,2010-12-12T21:45Z,I believe that I followed the instructions perfectly but I got the same email message as PirateAus. What do I do now?
,fatwire,2010-12-12T23:18Z,It worked perfectly...follow the instruction!!!
,charlik,2011-01-16T16:38Z,"for everyone talking about terminal etc, you don't have to use any of that. you can use the finder 'go to folder' just fine. took me 3 seconds. "
,krakkajax,2011-02-06T16:47Z,dont use this piece of shit software. There is no /usr/local/lib on 10.5!! Use Fairmount. This software is for fuckin lamers. Suck my meatwad fuckin fuckers. waste of fuckin time.

Thank You.

I did not send this email because it was not in the instructions to do..lol. 

@krakkajax
/usr/local/lib folder does exists on OS X10.5 it is a hidden to find it simply press shift+command+g "
,shen_long75,2011-04-05T08:25Z,"When copying ""mtr.lic"" (Step number 4) put the file into ""Users/yourusername/library/preferences/""

DO NOT put the ""mtr.lic"" file into ""yourHDD/library/preferences/""

A little tricky yes but this will ensure successful operation.

this is why outlook or other email program opens up & says all that crap.

Don't stress i learnt the hard way :))"
,mukkbo,2011-04-18T05:33Z,"did everything as told.. but this is what i get when i try to run the app.

um.. anyone else getting this?"
,srgroot,2011-04-27T23:44Z,"First much thx to shen_long75 with his hint!

and cause of the installer with the10.4 version hints... ignore them. Also works on macOSX 10.6

:)"
,Arklon,2011-08-23T09:11Z,"Honestly, Thank you.  I'm sick of these guys charging for software that uses files written for mass distribution and public use.

I doubt they will change their attitudes, they have a pretty good business going being the only decent Mac dvd ripper and all."
,aaronj69,2011-09-08T13:00Z,This MacTheRipper will not burn VIDEO_TS to DVD??? Please help!
,nemosrings,2011-10-09T21:44Z,"No need for a show invisibles kind of utility. Simply use the GO menu -> Go to Folder ... then type in /usr/local/lib
and bingo you're there. Oops invintive already gave that clue. lol

Certainly looks different to version 3. I was surprised it would not let me install onto a different drive where I keep lots of apps. Old fashioned early OSX demands for apps being on system drive.

@aaronj69, MTR is a DVD ripper, not a burner. Read the MTR manual. Personally I use Toast.

Anybody know how MTR compares with 1Mac DVDRipper Pro? I have not tried it yet."
,nemosrings,2011-10-09T21:57Z,Is it worth updating MTR 4? Or does that undo the crak & leave you with unregistered copy?
,nemosrings,2011-10-10T02:33Z,"BTW ~/Library/Preferences/ is your home directory user preferences, not the system preferences. The ~/ is unix for home directory. ;)
I've been using macs since OS 7 & only learnt that some months ago. lol duh"
,nemosrings,2011-10-10T03:18Z,"""all updates after version 4.0.31 will require a new license"" and each update must be paid for. pfft lol What a bunch of greedies. :D

I guess only answer is don't update. :P"
,DrDazle,2011-12-11T05:37Z,"Instructions:
1. Install using the DMG
2. Install LibdvdCSS.mpkg (The Separate Package)
3. Replace MTR 4.0.app with the kracked one (probably a good idea to replace the one in your applications folder).
4. Move the included mtr.lic to the folder -->[YOUR NAME]/Library/Preferences/ to find this folder go to ""Finder, Go menu item--> Go To Folder... then enter /Library/Preferences/. This will open the Finder to the folder. Drag and drop the mtr.lic into there"".
5. Move the included libMTR.dylib to /usr/local/lib/libMTR.dylib ""Finder, Go menu item--> Go To Folder... and type /usr/local/lib/. Drag and drop the libMTR.dylib into there"".
6. Launch MTR 4.0 and it should work.

Side note You can still use MTR 3.0r14l [k'ed] also and it appears to still work well too. ;)

Upload this file to another server and share the wealth. ;-)
