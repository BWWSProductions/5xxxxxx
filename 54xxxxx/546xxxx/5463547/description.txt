PrisM Notes::::::::::::
real great colors on source, hardly needed changing only some slight things here and there needed...anyway increased the brightness just and slight decrease in contrast, used a video denoise to remove the noise as their was quite alot of noise in the dark scenes, added only slight sharpness...some other bits got changed but anyway looks mint :), may not be as "sharp" as the other releases but their less noise on the dark scenes etc and no blocking that i saw also ours has no uniongang.tv watermark unlike the rest out their :)
