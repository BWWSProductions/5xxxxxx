,shasham,2010-04-14T22:33Z,Thank you very much! I love Jimmy Stewart and haven't seen this! I'll help seed. Cheers!
,arcname,2010-05-05T17:52Z,"Thank you John. Is there any chance that you could find and upload the movie 'The Big Sleep' (1978) in which James Stewart played a side role, and Robert Mitchum was the lead actor.."
,arcname,2010-05-05T17:54Z,"Currently, the only torrent available for the movie 'The Big Sleep' (1978- is in some other language and not in English, though it claims to be in English!"
[T],HallanD6,2010-05-07T19:58Z,"@jamydoug, I think the reason is, that this one is 25fps (PAL) and the subs are all made for 23,976fps (NTSC). I am dl this one (thanx by the way to the uploader). It should be possible sync subs to this version, I'll post a link then."
[T],HallanD6,2010-05-07T20:04Z,"(111 x 60 x 23,976) / (25 x 60) =
106 minutes runtime at 25fps"
