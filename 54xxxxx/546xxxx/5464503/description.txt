"HAPPY HOUR"

Michael (Golden Globe winner Steve Carell) gets kicked 
out of the bar when he whips out all the stops to 
impress a friend of Jim (John Krasinski) and Pams 
(Jenna Fischer). Meanwhile, Andy (Ed Helms) and Erin 
(Ellie Kemper) do their best to keep their 
relationships under wraps. Dwight rethinks his pre-
natal contract with Angela.

Enjoy :)
