,DunX6922,2010-06-15T12:50Z,are they >.CDI files ?
,zzk2001,2010-09-28T13:50Z,"Yes They are in CD-I  format 

But still have had some problems with some games.

With sonic adventure 2 i had to set DiscJugguler settings as followed 
(Mode 1 and TOC to CD-Rom/DVD + Overburn) with all other settings unchecked

With the game Crazy Taxi i have still not gotten it to load/run (comes up as a Audio CD in Dreamcast)"
,zzk2001,2010-09-28T15:15Z,"OK, found out Not all games are auto boot, I used a Boot loader on Crazy taxi and it worked =P"
,zzk2001,2010-09-29T00:17Z,"After some testing this is what i have come up with.

1. not all games work (emulator Or Dreamcast)

2.Many games are in JAP But most the games in Jap have English Audio.. 

3. I would think all are in 60hz (some games ask if you want to have 50hz or 60hz) 

4. Some of the better games don't work =( like Crazy taxi 2 or Dead or Alive 2 and Street Fighter Alpha 3.

5. with Crazy taxi 1 i got it to work with a Boot CD on Dreamcast (not working on Emu)"
,heli3,2011-06-30T16:32Z,Great! I hope i can burn and play to my DC favourite game (toy commander!)
