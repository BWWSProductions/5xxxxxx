,OneThirdLife,2010-08-22T02:41Z,"Doesn't even have a crack, and the game won't launch with the CD mounted. Don't waste your time downloading this or anything else from this amateur ""djdevastate"""
,PwrTorch,2010-09-13T23:45Z,"Files are corrupt, this is just plain bullshit. Don't bother."
,Ears14U,2011-02-13T04:46Z,"OneThirdLife, I've gotta agree with you...totally...This newbie can't crack shit! Everything's fine until you try and mount the ISO game CD to start the damn game...Don't waste your time with this amateur...YOU WILL REGRET IT.
Sorry piece of crap!"
,Deltaforce2665,2011-02-14T03:36Z,"Actually this torrent does work its just that you need to get a crack (I went to http://m0004.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_swat3.shtml and got a working one) but other wise this torrent is great and easy to install... except on windows 7 which was a bitch but I eventually got it to work.

All you had to do was change olepro32.dll so you have full control in privileges. thanks again djDEVASTATE2009 :D"
[T],ServiusTheBear,2011-05-02T13:48Z,Downloaded fast. But Locks up installation. Cant do nothing with it.
,tixan,2011-06-28T14:04Z,"Here is a serial:
BAC2 BAB2 BAB2 BAB2 2352 "
,Virage001,2011-07-23T05:43Z,"IT ALWAYS CRASHES WITH AN ERROR SAYING ""DIRECTX error DDERR_GENERIC"""
,GIjoe346,2012-05-19T23:05Z,error opening strings.dat when game loads up. how to fix plz???
,vlarg,2012-06-24T09:54Z,"Thank god there's still one active torrent for this game on here. For anyone who's not sure what they are getting themselves into. Let me tell you this, it's a lot better than 4 overall.

There are somethings that 4 did right mostly AI wise and graphics, but other than that, 3 dominates the gameplay aspect. Ohh also you can easily command both AI squads and it has bots in CoOp (In 4 you can't command bots in CoOp)"
,Skorpion_1992_PL,2012-06-25T16:06Z,"How to run SWAT 3 on Win7 x86:
1. Install three updates from this site http://sierrahelp.com/Patches-Updates/Patches-Updates-Games/SWATUpdates.html from SWAT 3: Elite Edition section. 
2. Download this crack http://m0004.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_swat3.shtml#SWAT 3: TGOTY v2.1 [US] No-CD/Fixed EXE 
3. Right click on c:sierraswat.exe, click properties and set compatibility mode to Win XP SP3. If direct error still pops out set the ""run in 640 x 480 screen resolution"" option. 

PS. The serial key is BAC2 BAB2 BAB2 BAB2 2352.

Thanks to @Deltaforce2665 and @tixan comments. Sorry for copying yours comments, I just want to put all info together in one peace."
