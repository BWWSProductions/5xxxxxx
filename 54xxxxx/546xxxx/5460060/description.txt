I finally located a better copy of this movie.

It took some doing, but this one is clean----no burned-in subtitles.

Although there were slight differences in some places, such as editing out explicit 

sexual scenes, etc., it is far easier to watch.

Sorry I wasn't able to do this in the first place.
