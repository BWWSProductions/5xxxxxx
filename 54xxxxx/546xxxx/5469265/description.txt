Astro Boy (2004) tells the story of a youthful robot boy, Astro, who is modeled after the deceased son of a research scientist, Dr. Tenma. Originally intended to be kept a secret, the atomic-powered robot becomes a reluctant superhero who fights for justice and peace for humans and robots alike. Created in Metro City he lives among a "retro-futuristic" society populated by humans and robots. The secret to his victories is not his superpowers; the quality that makes him superior to other robots is his artificial brain, which allows Astro to experience all of the same emotions as humans. Mankind's only hope of surviving the onslaught of rebellious robots is a robot himself... the fearless, selfless, incorruptible champion known as Astro.
