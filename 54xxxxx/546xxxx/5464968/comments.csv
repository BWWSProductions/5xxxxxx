,kcbay,2010-11-22T03:27Z,"some tips:
yeah, there are bunch of .rsd files inside, but never mind them, you don't need to directly deal with them anyway. just click add a language, the app (cracked or original) will auto detect the mounted disc (I use daemon tool) and use a few mins to install
you will need to enter the activation code in original app after the language installation, the cracked app will let you right in.

,Love_Scenario,2010-12-08T02:47Z,"Is no one reading what Kcbay just said? He said: ""you will need to enter the activation code in original app after the language installation, the cracked app will let you right in.""

That means, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO NEED AN ACTIVATION CODE. You're supposed to have the cracked version of Rosetta Stone and if you need an activation code that means you're not using the crack but are on the original. Here's what I did:
Download the crack and app here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5852393/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.7___Crack%28VasiaZozulia%29

Read and follow the instructions on where to replace the crack file here:

I registered just for you guys to write this comment. So to answer rudeflex so many people are downloading this torrent because this torrent is perfect, it works and there's nothing wrong with it if you install and crack it properly. Library Source I thank you!"
,66RockOn,2010-12-09T00:44Z,"Okay, look, in order for any of this to work, you must first download the actual rosetta stone program + crack.  Here :

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5210152/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.5___Crack(VasiaZozulia)

It has at least 400 seeds so shouldn't take that long.  Then all you have to do is mount each .iso file of each language level on a virtual drive, (I used PowerISO: http://download.cnet.com/3001-2646_4-10439118.html ) 
Go to rosetta stone, up in the top right corner click the middle button, then on ""add/remove language level"" It will detect the virtual drive automaticly, and all you have to do is press install.

Just remember: NEVER UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!2!!!11"
,iknouluvmi,2011-01-01T03:45Z,"Thanks! They all work perfectly! For all the people asking for the activation code: you need to download rosetta stone + the crack first! Then as long as you're in the cracked app, it won't ask for it."

,DocEvil,2011-01-13T00:16Z,"Ok people are really not explaining this well so here goes:

1. These are the language levels for the Rosetta Stone program. They do not run on their own, there is no executable for them, they are simply data images.

2. You need two things to make these work: A)Rosetta Stone v3, B) An image mounting program like Daemon Tools or MagicISO

3. Once you've got your version of Rosetta Stone up and installed, open it and it will ask if you want to install any new languages. At this point mount the image of whichever language you want (In this case German Level 1, or another level you want) in your virtual drive (Daemon Tools/MagicISO). Then go back to Rosetta stone and click the ""Install Language"" promt. It will search your disc drives and find the virtual mount of your language. It will then guide you into installing it.

4. ???

5. Profit"
,DocEvil,2011-01-13T00:35Z,"EDIT from my first post:

It seems, as has been mentioned before, that MagicISO has problems mounting Discs 4 and 5. Daemon Tools Lite works perfectly for them, however. I am installing Level 4 as I type this."

,cabot97,2011-09-30T23:03Z,Word of advice to all who read these comments. DO NOT UPDATE !! Install the application as per instructions in the torrent. Mount each image using a Disk Imaging Program like UltraISO or DAEMON Tools and add a new language as per requests by the application. NEVER update or you will destroy the crack. IIRC the new version of Rosetta Stone is web based and requires an online account. If you update you will have to uninstall the V3 app and remove the registry items and start fresh. MAJOR RULE: NEVER UPDATE A CRACKED APPLICATION !!
