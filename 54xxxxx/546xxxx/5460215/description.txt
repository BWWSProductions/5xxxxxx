I looked all over the torrent world and had a lot of trouble finding this, so I decided to collect them and make this myself. Torrent has all albums (except the In Silence and Virtuosity Demos, if someone can get a hand on them, please do us all a favor and upload it) and every album has the front cover + lyrics (taken from metal archives). Please seed and more importantly, support the band by buying their albums and merchandise, and attending their concert.

All rips are high quality.
