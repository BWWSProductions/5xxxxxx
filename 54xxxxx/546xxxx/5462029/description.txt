Please, do not make my work (and life) harder than already is.
By choosing small-file for download, you already saved, right?
There is no need to LIMIT your upload to others, I cannot allow that.
You all have been warned many times, on different ways.
You cannot screw my seeding-system up, maybe temporarily or once, but you would be at lost, at the end.

Do not: use foul language in your comments. Read, however, everything written.
Do not post stupidities.
Do not judge as bad neither me or my work, fact is - you don't know me.
Internet is a Big place, if you're not satisfied with my torrents or my work - silently go away. No harm would be done.
I do not care if you do not show respect. Simple as that.

Remember, I have something, you want that. You can get it, under my terms. No exceptions.
If you don't care; I repeat, I do not care. Go someplace else.

REQUESTS ARE "ON HOLD" TILL FURTHER NOTICE.

NEWSFLASH: From February 20. I entered Mode Three in initial-seeding phase. In short, it means initial seeding "by the numbers" (as written in almost forgotten Rules): the swarm will get exactly as it should be: total exchange between peers divided by the number of peers (seeding=exchange/peers). 
It counts How much you share (give) to other peers and how fast is your upload to others (don't worry, these are the bytes you got from me and others, not "yours").
So, my dear fellows, step on the breaks even harder - you'll get nowhere.
