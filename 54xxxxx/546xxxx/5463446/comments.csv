1. Take ""optical flares (mac)"" folder whit the files:
- Optical flares presets (folder)
- Optical flares Textures (folder)
- Optical flares.plugin
- OpticalFlaresLicense.lic
-OpticalflaresPref.dat
(writing this because i did not have all the files :/)

2. Put the folder into programs/adobe after effects CS5/Plug-ins - and place it here. Remove the ""Mac"" piece from the foldername.
3. go to:

""http://www.videocopilot.net/support/updates/""

and download your version. 

4. Take the new plugin you downloaded and replace it with the one in the ""optical flares"" folder.

First of all sorry for my poor English but I'm from Portugal.

If someone still don't know where to put the ""Optical Flares"" file in Win7 (for CS 5.5), just paste it in the common file of Adobe x32 and x64 >>>>> right here:

Programs/Adobe/Common/Plug-ins/CS5.5/MediaCore
