Just like its predecessor in season 3, the remaining 4 crews incorporated an eye-popping illusion or a mind-blowing magic act into their performance set. The final 4 crews kicked off the show with a group performance to "Take It Off" by Kesha with judge Lil Mama performing in the routine. Magician Franz Harary returned as the magic instructor for the crews.
