(This, and Lars' other CDs, are available at http://www.merchdirect.com/MCLars)
I ripped this into FLAC from an original CD with MediaMonkey.

iGeneration and Signing Emo were on the Graduate, but were reissues of tracks from Lars' 2004 "The Laptop EP". I include them in my Laptop EP torrent and not here.

This torrent does include the interview from the "Ahab" CD single. (The first two tracks on the single were simply the album versions of "Ahab" and "The Dialogue".)
