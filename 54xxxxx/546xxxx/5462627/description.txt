Eco-Home Adventures

Like many small towns across Canada, Craik Sask. was facing a slow extinction and the future looked bleak. Then they decided to try something really out there. They subdivided an area outside of town and sold the lots for $1 each. There was a catch. You have to build and live there, off the grid. Only green, sustainable housing is allowed, and no power. The first fourteen lots disappeared fast. People showed up to build.

Eco-Home Adventures follows the lives of these re-pioneers for over a year as they strive to build something unique, a model community to show that a sustainable village off the grid is possible. The obstacles were many. Weather, a steep learning curve, and the clash of a new community trying to fit into a small town knit together over a hundred years of farming. They rolled the dice, and the results are not what anyone expected.
