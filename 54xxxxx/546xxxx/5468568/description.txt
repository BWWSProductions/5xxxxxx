Developed by Tex Avery, Bob Clampett and Frank Tashlin, the true legends of the Golden Age of Animation, Porky Pig made his screen debut in 1935 and quickly evolved into the character that is known and loved today. In 1937 a cartoon called Porky's Duck Hunt introduced the character of Daffy, a totally kwazy quack who over time developed into a much different character, a devious duck whose schemes always go awry.
