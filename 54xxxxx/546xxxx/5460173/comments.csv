,romaniac85,2010-03-25T22:54Z,"Hey everyone, just want to confirm that this torrent works very well. Installation is in Russian but its nothing anyone cant handle. Everything else is in english if u want it to be. Furthermore, I dunno anything about this crashing every 10 seconds, i get none of that sort. I have quad core, win7 x86 and 8800gt/4gb ram. 

Thank you thenoobish.

Ur repacks rule."
,Dragon1233,2010-03-26T03:52Z,"Hey, I found a Win32/Heur virus in the .exe is that just me? Is it a false positive? I'm gonna have to pass on this torrent."
,romaniac85,2010-03-26T08:31Z,"Its people like Dragon1233 that make people deter from beautiful crafted torrent such as these. There are no viruses bro. If u see a pink or green skull it means people like this have a great reputation and wudn't blow it on stupid viruses. My God people have lost their minds.

Wat eva, the shit works and it still beats me to see a million seeds on reloaded @ 4 gb when this torrent is only 1.3gb and works very well.

Agen... keep up the mad work thenoobish. Cheers  :D"
,neotanay,2010-03-26T13:14Z,friens plz seed.......... speed is quite slow i want to try this super repack of 4 gb into 1.2 gb
,benjohn,2010-03-26T17:48Z,"is anything ripped???
 thnx btw"
,nabed4t,2010-03-27T05:13Z,"Stupidly I downloaded the Reloaded one, usually they are pretty good but I can't install it, something about being corrupt, although other people have had luck with it. Anyway, will try this one and see what happens.
@ Dragon1233, dont stress about that result, jst a false positive. Cracks usually do that, and like romaniac85 said, see the skull you know its pretty safe. Even though I still scan everything I download."

,skooterdogg,2010-04-07T05:30Z,"why is my game lagging so much?? i installed everything perfectly, but as it loads it starts skipping, any ideas why?? im running win 7 64bit with amdx2 dual core with 3 gb ram "
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-04-08T05:32Z,"@ skooterdogg

Damn, this copy is lagging too? I d/l'd the 'Reloaded' version and was getting major lag and sync issues. I was going to try this one to see if it was any better.

But if you already tried it and it's still laggy then i guess i'm screwed."
,thunder91,2010-04-09T20:13Z,"works perfect on a good computer
great job"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-04-11T23:05Z,"@ Thunder91

I have a bad computer?...

- 6gb RAM
- Intel Core 2 Quad Q6700
- 2.66GHz processor speed
- NVIDIA GeForce 9500GS graphics card.


It might not be the best, but i can play ANY game with zero lag. Dragon Age: Origins, Mass Effect 2, Fallout 3, Bioshock 2, Battlefield Bad Company 2, all on high settings and nothing, while this game almost cripples my computer(well not literally). How can that even be?"
,thunder91,2010-04-12T00:44Z,"@EvilCorporateWhore

well i dont know about that but most of the movies are sync with the voice with one or two exceptions, this is a pirate game you dont always get perfect cracks.
but why worry so much about that? the story and speech are just simple almost childish, the gameplay and visuals are the most fun in the game and that works for sure perfectly "
,shaunmann5,2010-04-12T13:58Z,the isnt any audio at the cutscenes just the background music and i cant seem to control using the keyboard. any1 else having the same problems?
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-04-12T18:25Z,"@ Thunder91

Understood, but if you had read my comment before, i said that i am getting both lag AND sync issues. Sure, the cut scenes or whatever are not dire to the game, but my gameplay is lagging quite badly too. I suppose i could reduce settings to minimal, but that is something i have never had to do before... which is why i am asking if perhaps it's just my install(as you say, cracked games are not always perfect).

So if it doesn't lag for someone with a lower quality computer, it leaves me to wonder why it lags on mine. Perfectly logical query, isn't it?

Anyway, i did play this game for a few hours, although the cut scenes were out of sync and had weird audio issues, the gameplay itself, although quite laggy at times, was still playable. The fact is i didn't really find it all that interesting of a game. I would like to give it another chance, but i wanted to see if i could figure out my issues first.

I'm in the middle of playing Dragon Age anyway, now THAT game is epic. It will probably keep me busy for a while."
,utkarsh09,2010-04-17T22:15Z,thanks....100% working!!!

,mcadzow,2011-06-25T10:27Z,"Hi there
I downloaded this torrent on a mac and managed to open the .exe file using PC emulation freeware called Wine. When I run the file, the installer opens just fine (mind you in an unfamiliar language) and presents a dialog box as shown in this link:

('winebottler' is the default name provided by Wine)
However, when I click what vaguely resembles an OK button (the bottom-left button) I am hit with an error as shown in this link:

Could anybody who has overcome this problem please advise me on how to do so too?
Thanks"
,mcadzow,2011-06-25T13:21Z,*'winebottler' is the name of the folder created by Wine to store the game once installed
