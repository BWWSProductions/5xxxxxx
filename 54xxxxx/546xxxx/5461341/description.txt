The story continues from Destination Moon. Professor Calculus is taking Tintin, Tintin's dog Snowy, Captain Haddock and Calculus' assistant Frank Wolff to the Moon in his rocket. However, the detectives Thomson and Thompson come up from the hold, having mistaken the time of the launch (1:34 a.m. on Tuesday, 3 June 1952). Calculus is concerned at the effect this will have on their air supplies. Haddock is furious, and severely lambasts the detectives for being too stupid to understand the difference between 1:34 a.m. and 1:34 p.m.  Of course, that's not the only drama...
