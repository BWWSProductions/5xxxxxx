,Teknokrat,2010-05-15T14:50Z,"What source did you use to make the flac files? I was assuming you had these discs, but judging from Audiochecker, you have just converted the previously shared mp3s into flac? That's a no no and a total waste of time (converting/sharing/downloading/burning) since you can't make files with proper flac quality  from a source that has been compressed to start with, regardless of what converter and/or settings you use. The only way to produce lossless flac files is from wav, or converting them from another LOSSLESS format, like APE or WAVPACK. MP3 is not a lossless format = not a valid source.

Here's a log from Audiochecker. Percentage is probability, and the conclusion it gives is the chances the source is CD-DA = 5%

001 -=- 01 - Anthem.flac -=- MPEG (95%)
002 -=- 02 - After Fire.flac -=- MPEG (95%)

You cannot rip a CD into MP3 (a lossy format) and than convert it to FLAC (a lossless format) expecting it to have the same quality as the original production.

Totally Worthless."
