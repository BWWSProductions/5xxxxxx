Some wouldn't open with MPC (error..cannot render file), some opened and despite being 700+ mb, were only 12-16 seconds long, and other opened with MPC, and the time read out as would be expected for a movie but would not play. Anyone have explanation?"

Also, for some of them the sound is low."

10 kb dl speed, i wonder if ppl knows HOW to
seed properly :o)

nice pack though, hop to have it down before
X-mas :o)"
