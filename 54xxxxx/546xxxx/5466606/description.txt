This package includes 14 themes that I made. In my eyes they are pretty cool, and I thought I'd share them with you guys.

You may want to change the screen saver, as I now think about it, I have forgotten to change it from my default.

Other than that, these are some pretty awesome themes for windows 7.

The pictures are taken off the web, but they are all wicked cool I think.

Enjoy and remember to seed!
