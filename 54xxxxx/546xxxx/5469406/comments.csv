Thanks for the encode/upload.

@ stev666 & lilars & 2040 - 666 is no longer the number of the beast. Hasn't been for a while now. Apparently, 'they' have worked out that the number is 999. I am not joking.
Imagine the years of study, manhours, discussion, theological debate, papers for peer review & rejected, papers published etc. etc. etc. To come up with the STUNNING conclusion that the someone/somewhere are sometime mis-copied (most likely reason) from a manuscript a 'number'.
Boggles the mind, the waste of effort and we're still stuck on the 3rd rock form the sun!!
Seriously!"

Sorry, I keep standing on my 'soap-box' and pontificating.

There is only 1 thing that I absolutely know for sure. I am not (& no-one is) infallible!"
,lilars26,2010-03-28T22:01Z,"@ jon
Maybe the devil changed carriers or maybe the original interpetors were standing on their heads.
You are right though,what a waste of brain power.I don't mind you pontificating.It makes life a little more interesting."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-28T22:45Z,"LOL Jon... it goes few weeks back. As a matter of fact - in pretty same company on some torrent I've mentioned that 'faux pas' date from long ago because Hebrew language has not signs for numbers, but same signs as for letters have been used to ""depict"" certain numbers.
For number 666 in Hebrew letters/writing signs approximately are similar (resemble to) - guess what? WWW - no kidding.
Joke aside - people are perfectly able to use symbols - and that is the case from dawn of time... and same people invent, choose and empower such symbols any way that suits them...
I am afraid that this is the case with these - but - ""history"" rest more in religions and other ""civilizational"" achievements than in the truth. People's perception of the world always goes through the glasses whose dioptry is made and established by surrounding society.
Well... we (the people) have empowered ""666"" long ago, and anyone who knows magic would confirm that. Besides, ""www"" comes from the ancient Hebrew manuscripts, long before all sorts of transcript errors on Greek and Latin (like Codex Alexandrinus) where one smudge (yes, a smudge) have changed a word (abbreviation) from OS to QS (from plain ""who"" in  ""God"", Tim 3:16) which has, among many other things, changed complete saying, a foundation and not just linguistic meaning/sense, as they try to sell.

Also, word ""hell"" simply doesn't exist, in Old and New Testament. It's blatant lie, not an error, because used words sheol Heb. grave, Gehanna (garbage-dumping site near Jerusalem), Hades (""invisible"" world) and Tartarus (mythical prison for fallen Greek gods/Titans) allways has been translated as today's hell.

We have invented hell (as concept) just to displace, as usually, the truth all around - this planet is a Hell, maybe galactic dump-yard and for sure one nasty asylum and prison-colony for nasty two-legged creatures who have ruined everything their ever touched. 

Ahem, IMO - what we perceive is, or, become the truth, and we are creatures still guided by our built-in intrinsics. Symbols are omnipresent lever of any human-made sociological structure and mechanism."
