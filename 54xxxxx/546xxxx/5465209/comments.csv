,tripmix,2010-04-30T06:21Z,"I'd rather watch this again than any of the crap that's on TV these days, just finished my second viewing of voyager so I need something else. Guess I'll be watching Enterprise again after this... I so wish they could make a new StarTrek series, but they would probably just put Jar Jar Abrams in charge so I might as well just give up on TV... Just look at what those idiots did to Stargate, go die TV people. Thanks for the up BTW. "
,tripmix,2010-05-06T23:20Z,"I just noticed that one of the Klingons in episode 2x04 is Tuvak from Voyager. I also recently noticed that Mr. Prophet from Andromeda is Q or rather Q is Mr. Prophet. Andromeda also has a few episodes that have Daniel from Stargate and Stargate has a few episodes with Andromeda as the new doctor. I found out later that Daniel is married to Andromeda in real life, lucky bastard. Whatever happened to the real doctor on SG btw, I know she died in SG but where did she go and why did she quit? I always loved her, strange that all doctors in sci-fi are likable but I hate them in real life :D"
,Glitch01,2010-12-07T20:28Z,"hey, thanks for the DS9 series.  My girlfriend and I just finished watching the entire series; it took us a long while to finish it, just over half a year or thereabouts.  As for the technical details, the quality of the files were all good.  We plugged her laptop to a 42"" LCD TV using VGA and watched most of the series that way.  The image quality was good.  As for the story... well... there were some really great ones, and there were some not so great ones.  Overall, we both enjoyed the series a whole lot!  During the series finale, my girl, bless her little heart, quietly cried during some of the parts.  Once again, thanks for the series!  :)"
,kyleb001,2011-02-12T04:12Z,"Hi was just wondering about the audio-to-video ratio, if there any delay, the top seeding tracker for the series ATM seems to be having audio delay issues, just wondering if anyone could clear that up for me :)"

Thank you for the wonderful torrent. I have only watched the first episode and it is awesome. I admit, I prefer doing single season torrents, it makes life much easier. Might you be able to do a torrent of the extras for the entire series?

Downloaders:
My first few downloads, I was concerned about exceeding my data allocations or slowing the downloads by using uploading for the available bandwidth. I set the uploads to 1kb/sec max.

I found out that my provider wasn't going to slow down or stop my internet access and that it did not affect my downloading speeds. So, I opened the uploads up fully. 

The other side of this is that I have noticed a huge percentage of leechers. I am seeding everything that I have downloaded, until I reach at least 2/1 ratio. Please give back to the community! Give as much as you can, because it makes you a better person!

My uploads are set to unlimited, most of the time, on torrents I have completed.

The ones I am still downloading, I am throttling the upload back, if my download speed is less than my upload speed. So, if you are downloading this torrent, set the upload limits to 0 (zero) so they are unlimited! I will respond in kind!"
,bareDLs,2011-12-01T17:35Z,"so im half way through the DL 10 days, ETA 7 weeks, i would like to suggest that the original up-loader come back for a while so the DL can continue at a faster pace thanks"
,bramsie,2012-04-18T13:15Z,Seeding with 100 Mbit again.. nice to see that a torrent can last so long ;-)
