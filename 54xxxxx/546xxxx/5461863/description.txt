Cheryl Cole - BBC Live Lounge 2010 (2 songs)

Cheryl Cole was in the Live Lounge this morning and sang Parachute and a cover of Fireflies by Owl City.

She performed without her shoes on, as said she was feeling nervous and wobbly on the high heels (you can see her wiggling her toes in the video).

She talked about the success of her solo career and going on tour with Black Eyed Peas, though also talked about Girls Aloud releasing more material. In fact, she was out with the Girls the night before and blamed Nicola Roberts for her slight hangover.
