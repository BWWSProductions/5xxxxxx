Bought this off the counter of my local record store in Ashford, Kent around 1986, it's a home made mini-album on C60 cassette with a hand drawn cover (The cover art attached ia a random picture I found on the internet with the same title) I never heard of this bunch before or after, searched the internet and find no evidence of their existance. I think the band showed promise (in a very Goth kind of way!) I wonder if anybody will want this or if anyone knows who the hell they were! OBie.
