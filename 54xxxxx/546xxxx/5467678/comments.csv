[V],err0001,2010-03-27T21:22Z,"Thanks for all the positive feedback.

I'll try to add RT to my schedule (I do like that there are no commercials to edit out), though I generally prefer to cap shows that are either Canadian or unpopular.

I generally avoid uploading shows that I know the scene will eventually upload but I figured after the delay with this show last week ... "

[V],catflap,2010-03-28T06:47Z,"@err0001:

this is a very good size for a chat show, even
though it's almost an hour long. it doesn't need
to be over 500MB like the scene caps.

it looks very good on the monitor, a CRT tv, and
my 52-inch HiDef LCD tv.

good work."
