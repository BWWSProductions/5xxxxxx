Does anybody have the whole torrent, or has the vide that is NOT RAR FORMAT?

(For those who do not know: if the full download is not completed, if the file is a ""avi"" or other native format, the user can start watching it before it is completely downloaded. With RAR format, ALL segments must download before the video can be watched.)

Isn't it time to leave RAR behind...? "
