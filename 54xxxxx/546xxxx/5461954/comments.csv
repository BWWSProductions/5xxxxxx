Thanks and happy New Year :-)"

If you could reload it without the rest of the files or allow split file downloads, I'd be really grateful.

Please email me on sdguy@jerseymail.co.uk

Thanks again"

Thanks anyway.

Will just have to buy it next time we're in Panthip or MBK.

Shame though, as it looks quite a fun series.

Chok dee krap."
