In this free-jazz gangster film, reformed killer â€œPhoenixâ€ Tetsu drifts around Japan, awaiting his own execution, until heâ€™s called back to Tokyo to help battle a rival gang. Seijun Suzukiâ€™s â€œbarrage of aestheticised violence, visual gags, [and] mind-warping color effectsâ€ got him in more trouble with Nikkatsu studio heads, who had ordered him to â€œplay it straight this time.â€ Instead he gave them equal parts Russ Meyer, Samuel Fuller, and Nagisa Oshima. Criterion presents the DVD premiere of Tokyo Drifter in a lush color transfer from the original, glorious Nikkatsu-scope master.
