Please be more precisely. There is volumes 01-... in different categories (PS, SP, Classical, Film score series,...). Give me some names."
,hansiop,2010-04-27T15:02Z,any idea how to manual install the Smartsound files as Sonicfire don't accept the ISO CDs?
,DarkMan70,2010-04-28T01:08Z,"@ hansiop

If You don't want to burn ISO to CD disk, mount ISO disk image with any virtual disk drive software (eg. Daemon Tools) will Sonicfire is started. Sonicfire will recognize and offer to install Smartsound libraries from that ISO."
,hansiop,2010-04-28T12:54Z,I have tried both an a Mac and a Win 7 to burn a CD . they appear to be okay when I put them in but Sonicfire stop and ask for CD on my Mac ( which i'm using the sonicfire) it appear as a HD when I mount it. I'm trying to use some ISOs you shared in 24/5/09 
,DarkMan70,2010-04-28T18:49Z,"@ hansiop

Unfortunately I don't have any experience on Mac with that so I can't help you. I can only give you guarantee that it will works under Win XP and Vista 32 and 64 bit."
