PlayStation-Ready HD Movie Trailers
March 25, 2010


This is a collection of movie trailers for next week premieres
and latest interesting trailers in HD 1080p. For the first time,
no premieres needed downloading old trailers. Good thing, since
I had to omit three most dull trailers to fit into 2 GB.
