,jeffro30,2010-03-28T22:33Z,"Thanks dude, keep the HD coming it looks great, and works perfect"
,mx_phreek,2010-03-28T23:12Z,"Thanks, i think you have these down to a tee, great quality. On my old pc i found vlc player was by far the best at playing heavy video's. It just wouldn't play HD content smoothly in wmp and would just grind to a halt trying to play .mov files. But with vlc media player it worked fine. so i would recommend that if your pc is having a hard time watching these."

,projekttm,2010-03-28T23:21Z,Keep the best HD and thanks for sharing.
,ps10nic,2010-03-29T01:44Z,"Thanks for your effort. I really appreciate being able to watch your vid's. For HD try an encode with x264 and an mkv container, it is far superior."
,ashleymx,2010-03-29T03:10Z,"Thanks heaps Slicknick.  They work awesome for me.  I initially had a problem playing your HD ones direct through the USB on my TV but I expected that.  Now I have a HDMI cable running to the TV from the PC and still use WMP.  It looks better than what my Pay TV provider sends through the satellite lol. I have a 54"" HD Plasma Samsung TV."
