september 1971.
the De Lane Lea Studios, London


Queen's first demo tape from 1971!

IN THE BEGINNING
Recorded in late 1971 at the De Lane Lea Studios in London.
These are actual demos, not the usual "faked"demos that have poppedup
over the last few years. Sound quality is very good as it came from the original tapes.
This CD is a must have for any collector. (Total Disc Time 27:10)

Around September 1971, Brian May met up with an old friend, Terry Yeadon,
who was involved in the setting up of a new recording studio in Wembley called De Lane Lea The studios needed musicians to try out the new equipment they had installed - and preferably a band who could play loud ! The deal was that the musicians would record using the equipment, and potential studio users would be on hand to hear and watch them.
In return for their services the band could record their demos for free. It was an opportunity not to be missed and, of course Queen jumped at it. Not only would they be able to make the all important demo tapes, but they would have ample occasion to meet producers and engineers, people who could be vital to their future. The rest is history.............
