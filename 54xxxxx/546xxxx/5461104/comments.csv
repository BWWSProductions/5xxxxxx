,Bujaaa,2010-03-24T23:23Z,This game is so cool. I downloaded it from a private tracker. I simply can't believe how much freedom you have in this game. In fact this game is what Mercenaries 2 should have been. Ok i gotta go and continue playing now. :)
,zogulusnig,2010-03-26T19:37Z,I agree with Bujaaa - this game is RAD.  Boatloads of fun and tons of over the top action in a HUGE and free environment.
