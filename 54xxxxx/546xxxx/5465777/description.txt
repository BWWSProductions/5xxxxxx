MC Lars' 2010 version of his b-sides compilation "21 Concepts (But A Hit Ain't One)".
Some are reprised from the 2007 version. Lars says the returning songs were remastered. Some were removed and some others were added. (Several of the added songs had recently been released individually by Lars as free MP3s)
I have a separate torrent up for songs from the 2007 version that were not on the 2010 version
At any rate, this is the first time that most of these have appeared in CD form.
