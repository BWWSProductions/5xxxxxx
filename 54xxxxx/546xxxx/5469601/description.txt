Some very interesting music by the Swedish band "Gul 3".

This type of music is quite difficult to describe, but some keywords would be "calm, ambient, acoustic, experimental, soul".

I ripped the CD myself. As you can see in the logfile, EAC reports two suspicious positions. It doesn't matter which drive I am using, the error persists and the problem lies in the disc itself. The errors are inaudible, and since this CD is so rare I still wanted to share it here.
