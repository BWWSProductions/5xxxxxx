JIVE TALKIN
___________
 
We had already thought up the title for this song, but it wasnt until Barry, Maurice
and I drove from Biscayne Bay to Miami that we realised what the tune was going to 
be.We had the idea as we passed over a bridge.
Some tar noises made a rhythmic sound on the wheels of our car, which created the 
feel to the type of song we wanted to write, we finished the song at the Criteria 
studios that day.
It is an R & B track that got to number one in the US and also did very well in the 
black charts there, we were one of the first white groups to explore that territory.

WORDS
_____

This was actually written for Cliff Richard, but he never got round to recording it 
as he wasnt making an album at the time, we were â€“ and dont like wasting songs â€“ so
we sung it instead, Elvis Presley had a number one with a cover version of it, as
did Boyzone,we never met Elvis but Boyzoneâ€™s lead singer Ronan Keating is a friend 
of ours.

IVE GOTTA GET A MESSAGE TO YOU
______________________________

This is about a prisoner on Death Row who only has a few hours to live. 
He wants the prison chaplain to pass on a final message to his wife, theres a certain
urgency about it,myself and Barry wrote it. Its a bit like writing a script. 
Sometimes you can sit there for three hours with your guitar and nothing will happen. 
Then in the last ten minutes something will spark. 

TO LOVE SOMEBODY
________________

We originally wrote this song for Otis Redding while we were staying at the St Regis
hotel in New York. Then, of course, he died in a plane crash. We were huge admirers 
of his, so we decided to record it ourselves. It is one of our most covered songs. 
I like our version the best, but then Iâ€™m biased. I think Nina Simoneâ€™s cover is 
fantastic too.

I STARTED A JOKE
________________

This is a very spiritual song, the listeners have to interpret it themselves â€“ 
trying to explain it would detract from the song. 
It got to number five in the US, but it wasnâ€™t released in the UK as a single. 
Faith no More covered it as their final single as a band.
 
NIGHTS ON BROADWAY
__________________

This was produced by Arif Mardin, it was a huge hit for us in the States and has been
covered a heck of a lot since then, it was the first song Barry introduced his famous 
falsetto vocals on, which became an important part of our sound for many years.
Like a lot of artists, such as McCartney and Prince, we were experimenting. It was 
important to us as songwriters as well, we didnâ€™t want to stick to a certain formula.

HOW CAN YOU MEND A BROKEN HEART
_______________________________
 
This was our second number one in the States after a two year split, the first number
one was Lonely Days, and we wrote both singles in the same afternoon in our basement
flat in Addison Road in Kensington, it was a happy time â€“ any time we reunite is happy.
Barry and I dont really speak about the split, we focus on being back together because 
thats what were all about.

RUN TO ME
_________

We wrote this is at our manager Robert Stigwoods house in Beverly Hills, he was a great 
visionary and championed our beliefs and chemistry as brothers, if he hadnt got in touch 
with us when we arrived back in the UK from Australia our career could have gone a 
different way entirely, we are always in and out of Los Angeles.

NEW YORK MINING DISASTER 1941
_____________________________

We recorded this at Londons IBC studio because it was dark and emulated a mining shaft. 

The result was a very lonely sound, it was our first UK and US single after meeting 
Robert Stigwood and our first hit on both sides of the Atlantic, We had been making 
records in Australia but this was a notch up, it was a great buzz.

MASSACHUSETTS
_____________
 
This was a bittersweet victory, the day it went to number one it was Bonfire Night and I 
was in the Hithergreen Rail Crash in Lewisham, Forty-nine people died and it was one of 
Britains worst rail disasters, luckily I didnt get injured. I remember sitting at the side 
of the carriage, watching the rain pour down, fireworks go off and blue lights of the 
ambulances whirring, it was like something out of a Spielberg film.
I thought, at least there is one consolation, we have our first UK number one.

CLOSER THAN CLOSE
_________________

This is very special to us, as Maurice sings the main vocals, it is taken from the One 
Night Only album and was never released as a single, we performed it at the Brit Awards 
in 1997, when we won a Lifetime Achievement Award. 
This is a dedication to him. Although we lost Maurice in 2003 his legacy lives on in 
our music. Turn on the radio, you hear the song and hes there.

HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE
_____________________

This was the first of six consecutive number ones in the States. Nobody had ever done 
that before and very few people have done it since, at one stage there were around seven 
of our songs â€“ which we had either sung or written for other people â€“ in the US Billboard 
top ten. It doesnâ€™t get much better than that. If you accomplish half of what we have 
youre happy.
