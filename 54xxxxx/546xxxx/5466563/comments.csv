,principlemajor,2010-09-28T04:31Z,Who is the Author of this CBTNugget Video?
,heethcliff,2011-03-11T13:13Z,"I cannot seem to get these to play - Quicktime with Flip installed would't work, and even VLC is giving me errors. Ideas anyone?"
,Lassik,2011-03-16T11:48Z,"For anyone interested this is actually
640-822 & 640-816

I think 640-802 is a typo.

As for the question of who the Author is, it's Jeremy Cioara. This is the same exact file as previously uploaded from back in 2007 minus the .iso files. It's just the ripped videos.

If you have the original ISOs then there is no point in downloading this one because it's the same exact stuff. This is not an updated version."
,Persica,2011-04-30T08:18Z,tnx for mentioning this ain't 640-802..was abt to dl this ;)
,alathea,2011-06-06T03:34Z,"640-802 is the entire ICND1 and 2 test. OR you can take it in two pieces, the -822, and -816. Its the same stuff, people. "

,end77,2011-09-19T22:31Z,"MAC USERS: IMPORTANT NOTE so you won't waste 10 hours of your life like I did today.
The videos in this package are WMV MSS2, thus there's no way to play them on Mac, if you have a Mac like I do. I installed many apps, tried and researched, it cannot be done on Mac.

Instead, get the converted version from this torrent:
