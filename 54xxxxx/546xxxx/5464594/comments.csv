PT, your the best!"
,Cespur,2010-03-27T03:12Z,"Oh, one comment though; the censor is kinda annoying. Any chance your uploading the following episodes uncensored?"
,hutness,2010-03-27T22:12Z,"Hey PT, just wondering, can you upload Summer wars with hard-coded English subtitles? Thanks. Keep up the good work. :)"
,Cespur,2010-04-07T00:24Z,Hey! No episode 3? Hahahaha
