,quakerray,2010-03-28T12:34Z,"it was on sky sports for an hour here in uk at 5am for an hour. so miss out the ads itll be about 40 mins,think its just the last 2 inductees.does anyone know if the whole lot was aired or are they waiting to put it on the mania dvd"
[T],Coolguy33,2010-03-28T18:05Z,"This was great to wacth, especially The Million Doller Man at the end but where was Stu Hart and the rest....too short man!"
[T],Coolguy33,2010-03-28T18:24Z,"@pat.bateman , yeh i know they showed short clips but that was it. The whole thing was too short. Maybe it's USA Network."
[T],Coolguy33,2010-03-28T18:54Z,"@bateman , guess they goto do what they goto do i suppose. Still enjoyed it all the same but it will be soon time for Mania."
,quakerray,2010-03-28T19:21Z,"one thing tho,do not read comments when mania comes up. i think we all know what happenned when the rumble was uploaded, some dicks spoilt it for everyone.i avoid looking at the comments on payperviews now."
[T],Coolguy33,2010-03-28T20:02Z,@ quakerray & bateman. Well all i can say on mania is that i hope this year is better than last year and that Taker keeps the streak. Will be nice to see vince get his ass wooped by bret. Finaly!
[T],Coolguy33,2010-03-28T20:10Z,You guys watch TNA?
,KOATV,2010-03-28T20:16Z,Is there a torrent with the entire complete ceremony uploaded yet?
