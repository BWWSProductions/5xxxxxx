,n3llo,2010-03-28T13:52Z,"thanx TvTeam at least we can trust you!!
over 2500 blood sucking dirty leechers, don't you cunts worry about the rest of us just remember how yous got the torrent in the first place ""because someone seeded for yous to get it""!!
peace TvTeam"
,SpaCeCrafted,2010-03-29T04:32Z,look at all these worthless bitches leeching and not seeding.  there's 8100 leechers and only 1000 seeders. that means 1 out of every 8 people is uploading.  That's a huge number of useless douch bags.  I think a torrent that only allows u to download if you upload would be a great idea.
,rj28,2010-04-01T04:59Z,Thank you very much TvTeam
