JOHN LEE HOOKER ALONE
Recorded live at New York's Hunter College in 1976,
Released: 1989
Label: Tomato
Format: Mp3@; 320 
Time: 39:07[Disc1] 43:40 [Disc 2]




Each of the two discs of this Tomato package are separate sets from a  solo concert at New York City's Hunter College. The format is just Hooker and his guitar, and in this intimate setting, the blues veteran has plenty of room to stretch out, improvise and say what needs to be said. Not just the boogie, but some serious blues too. This recording caught Hooker up close, giving both voice and guitar a lot of force.
A candidate for best John Lee Hooker live album.
