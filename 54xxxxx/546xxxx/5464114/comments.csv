       03/2010 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: EA DRM
             1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Strategy



 Behold disciples of Nod, for the end is soon upon us. Electronic Arts'
 award-winning and best-selling Tiberium saga is coming to a powerful
 conclusion with Command & Conquer 4, which will introduce a multitude of
 innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command & Conquer gameplay, while
 retaining the core compulsions that fans have come to love over the series'
 history.

 It is the year 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction. Tiberium, the
 mysterious, alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades
 and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the
 Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, is close to
 rendering the planet uninhabitable. Mankind is on the verge of extinction
 when Kane, Nod's prophetic leader, emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the
 message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and
 harness its power. But he cannot build this ""Tiberium Control Network""
 without GDI's cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions - GDI and Nod
 - inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop
 Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.

 After 15 years, the network is nearly complete, Tiberium is under strict
 control and our revitalized, newly terraformed planet is on the cusp of a new
 age of prosperity and progress. It is then that the world's citizens begin to
 seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what will he want in return.
 These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the Tiberium saga.

 With a multitude of innovative new features to the fast and fluid C&C
 gameplay, Command & Conquer 4 offers players an entirely new way to play C&C.
 An all-in-one mobile base, persistent player progression across all game
 modes that is constantly updated in a real-time online profile, a 3-class
 system for each of the two factions, co-operative play, and a 5v5
 objective-based multiplayer mode that promotes teamwork and social
 interaction, make Command & Conquer 4 unlike any other C&C experience.


 * When you're blocking C&C 4 from firewall, make sure you allow connection
   to 127.0.0.1 (loopback to your PC), or else the game won't work.

   so back it up.
 * The BONUS PRE-ORDER mission is available.

,swedoc,2010-03-26T00:34Z,how come you can't honor the scene and keeps unraring rells so no one can sfv check what you up ?
[V],Mbb15,2010-03-26T00:42Z,"1. Happy to see that the scene can crack games like this.
2. The p2p version still works better for me so I dont need this."
,evuleyez,2010-03-26T00:44Z,"why honor the scene? they hate p2p anyways! Besides, the first working crack for this game was not made by the scene... so probably RELOADED just studied that crack and took the idea. :P"
,degusto,2010-03-26T01:01Z,Could you possibly add an separate fixed exe or whatever is the fix? would be great full
,evuleyez,2010-03-26T01:03Z,any news on the assassin's creed 2 crack? or they're just waiting for a working p2p crack that they can steal?
,degusto,2010-03-26T01:25Z,maybe the crackers got a deal from ubi and skid was playing everyone :] conspiracy everywhere! stop whining and wait like the others

95% of the time you don't even save 1mb. Especially true for videos. The people doing it should be shot in the balls.

I for one am glad aitb uploads stuff without rars."

AiTB you Rocks"
,krezeb,2010-03-28T01:28Z,"Magnet Links don't download .torrent files onto your computer.

I can see the positive side of compressing things into multiple .rar files. If the files become corrupted during download, what would you rather do? Delete 1 or 2 rar files and redownload them, or delete the entire 7.5 gig uncompressed file and redownload it instead?
.raring files makes it easier *incase* something goes wrong. Fine, it takes a little more time to unpack and requires a good bit of HD space, but I'd still prefer it over having to redownload a large file overnight."

Thank you AiTB for this upload."
,Quazo,2010-03-28T09:00Z,"I wish they would have continued making their C&C games like Generals, that was IMO the best C&C they ever made, and it's expansion....the single player was fun, the online multi-player was wonderful , considering how bad the others were online."
,Quazo,2010-03-28T09:04Z,"Hey peeps, if you all don't mind.....once you've finished your download, please stay seeding for a day or two at least, so many stop seeding immediately once they've completed downloading the file....and that's just SO rude IMO....but heck, how will we ever know who seeds & whom does not, oh well....just wanted to mention that hehe....Thanks!

>> and krezeb
if one file is corrupt you just force a re-check and utorrent (for instance) fixes it, no need to delete anything..... it's not because of that some uploaders like multi rars"

What an epic shame for EA messing up one of the most famous titles in RTS history. And they fucked up the last game in that title which should have been the most important.

Seriously people, DONT buy this..."

,phingon,2010-04-01T04:47Z,"ok so....

first of all thanks for the uploads great game and had no problems installing it.

now... i do have a problema nd it was kinda strange and weird so wondered if it had happend to anyone else.

so i got up to ""to kill a prophet"" mission in GDI, once i did the final thing and took down the sonic shield i.e complete the mission, it goes to load the cut scene and then when it comes back up im back to the mission called ""lockdown"" which is like the mission before the prophet one.

anyone know why after completing the mission it has looped back to the start of the previos mission?"

,beastb,2010-04-21T18:33Z,"wow, i saw all the bad reviews saying the game is horrible ea sucks, but i just figured that was the normal people bashing ea and being super critical about the game however...  no this game has been completely ruined...  

you dont build things like power plants or war factories anymore, everyone has this one super building that does everything - super watered down the gameplay - units have super amount of health its more rpgish than it is an rts

NO HARVESTING RESOURCES isnt that the fun of c&c harvesting all that pretty crystal, well not anymore thats out of the game

theres no money theres only control points which are like population - however everything is free until you fill up your pop cap - very stupid, very bland, as others have stated epic fail

oh and for those who do like the game -  XP doesnt kick in for campaign missions until after your NOD/GDI choice"

the isnt too bad, its just diffrent, its more strategic now, and requires a bit more forethought and planning to acomplish missions. it was designed for multiplay though, so its best online. so DLing it is only gonna give you the offline portions and thats a poor taste. "
[T],Knaster,2010-05-02T15:28Z,Extremely booooring game.
,tackfurlo,2010-05-05T03:44Z,"Well...the honest truth is this game is one of 2 things.

A) The best Real Time Tactics game I've ever played.
or
B) The worst Real Time Strategy game I've ever played.

That said, you can't blame the C&C fan base for feeling a bit betrayed.  There's change, and then there's a total series reboot.  This is like a reboot without rebooting the story along with it.  Reboots can be good, it keeps things fresh, but you don't do a reboot when the game is the last game in the entire storyline.  It's just pointless.

That said, on second thought, World in Conflict is a better Real Time Tactics game too.  Well, and EndWar.  And Universe At War.  And Ground Control.  And pretty much any other Real Time Tactics game released since 2001.  But other than those, C&C4 isn't bad.

That said, I played it for roughly 20 hours over the span of a week and have now uninstalled it.  It's not bad, but it's not worth 5GB+ on my 64GB SSD either.

Time to redownload WiC I suppose.  *sigh*"

,pirat8l79,2010-05-25T02:23Z,"OMG I couldnt believe what shit of a ""game"" this is - the effects, the graphics, the gameplay - absolutely terrible - games from 1998 were 1000x better than this crap which they sell us as C&C4. It has nothing to do with Command&Conquer anymore as we know it.

With regards to graphics, when I discovered that the graphics settings were set on low by default and I changed it to high - incredible difference - things improved slightly, but it didnt change the fact that the game is hideously slow paced (changing game speed not possible), laggy, boring, repetitive, badly designed, just SHIT! Though I didn't expect much of a 3D C&C since 3D simply doesn't work effectively on RTS games - it only sets limits, without improving anything.  ""Emperor: battle for dune"" from 2001 was also in 3D, of course I didn't like it one bit, yet it is still 100x better than this cheap shit, there is absolutely no comparison.

I deleted the game from my hard disc right after wasting my time with (playing) a few missions. Not worth the bandwidth and time."

second the game its really not a good one compared to previous versions. now we dont have the internet option so we cant say its a disaster like some has said. the missions really suck. also we have to get used to year 2060 or something.

well botton line i love to say fuck u all ea bitches motherfuckers licksockers.

your game sucks from the inside to the left. i dont know what that is. but its a huge suck."
,BC007UK,2010-06-26T04:12Z,"I dont no what the people are talking about when they cant get this to work, i followed the instruction as advised & it works fine & im using a intel MacMini using WindowsXP via Parallels.

below is what i did...

I Burned the image to a (DL-DVD) Dual-Layer DVD Disc Using Toast (as i am using Mac OS X Snow Leopard)

Then...Using Windows XP via Parallels i inserted the disc as you would normally insert a dvd then automatically a dialog box shows up asking you to install C&C4. (Very Good Stuff)

..it did take awhile to install, but once it did i then had to copy over the cracked content before playing or stating the game, so i went into explore the dvd-disc that i inserted & there sure enough i found a folder called ""crack"" so i opened it up dragged whatever was inside and copied it over to the main folder that has been saved by C&C4 installer which you will find in the programmes folder & once that was done everything is ready.

So all you have to do now is open the Game & Play, o yes, once you start the game wait awhile for it to load & once it does a dialog box will show up with two option buttons, one with ""server"" & the other with play game, click on the server option first then you will notice the other button allowing you now to press it, so go ahead & press the Play game button & it will start up.

The Game Works wonderfully, you cant play server multiplayer games, but playing the computer is just fine by me & if you have a power-full games computer you can use the Full Graphics Settings & see how nice it is.

This torrent Works fine & the game is awesome, but you will need some common sense when trying to install this.

Congrats to the Uploader & Everyone Make-Sure you Seed as Sharing is Caring & the Cyber World will be a better place for it, even though sometimes reality is boring."

the game itself might have a big bug though, after the GDI Lockdown mission, the game failed to ""remember"" all the missions after that mission. so i am pretty stucked, did tried updating it, changed different username;nothing...

,uberlockpwnsu,2011-11-10T22:25Z,"Ok so I need some help.  I dled it, and have the Rar file... but no bloody image file.  Can anyone tell me where it is?  I've extracted all the files in the original rar to a folder, but all I get are a bunch of other rar files of the game files, and some folders, and then the autorun file to start up the install.  I can install without the iso, but I can not get the crack to work.  So help!"
,joking88,2011-12-05T09:03Z,"^^ have you set your winzip to be associated with .iso if so that's the problem, if you have the Deamon Tools desktop gadget just click and drag it on to that and it will create a virtual drive with it"
,joking88,2011-12-05T09:25Z,Sometimes the winzip file contains the .iso
,TheBeatzProducer,2011-12-15T23:27Z,Return Westwood. The guys who actually (could) make a proper C&C.

,biggi098,2012-06-10T17:22Z,"lol wow this is bullshit... i've spent the last 2 hours looking for a crack, i found 4 different types of cracks, 3 of them had the stupid virus and 1 which was the 2.0 version, well, the uploaders FAILED to post straight forward instructions of how to patch and crack the game. There is more to it than install the patch.. apparently we have to modify/add something in the so called ""hosts"" file in the system32 folder or w/e."
