I've been trying to find a way to send you a message but I cant make out how to, so I'm gonna ask for help here and hope you will read this. Could you please upload 'The Moment It Clicks' by Joe Mcnally ? 

I've been searching for it for a long time now, cant seem to find it anywhere at all. Would be a great help. Thnx again mate."
