Looking at life through the rearview mirror was the inspiration for John Hiatt's brand new album, The Open Road. The legendary songwriter's 19th studio album is classic Hiatt, picking up the tempo and returning to rock following his previous critically acclaimed Same Old Man. 
Backed by his touring band, (Kenny Blevins on drums, Patrick O'Hearn on bass and Doug Lancio on guitars), the songs are inspired by life on the road, without looking back. "All the other years, my songs are about coming home," Hiatt says. But within these 11 new songs, home is never the destination.

Hiatt will take the new songs on the road beginning with a run of international dates with Lyle Lovett (see below). Upon returning to the states, he will appear on the 3rd annual Cayamo cruise, on which he's played since the first voyage. Tour dates in North America will follow in March with shows including NYC on March 10th followed by Pittsburgh, DC and Annapolis, which is already sold out.

Hiatt has written songs covered by a multitude of artists in a wide variety of genres including Bob Dylan, Rosanne Cash, Willie Nelson, Jewel and Bonnie Raitt, who most famously recorded "Thing Called Love." On The Open Road he showcases both his lyrical and musical talent with his blues driven, rock songs including the title track and "Haulin'." Hiatt produced The Open Road himself after recording with his band in his garage-turned-studio.
