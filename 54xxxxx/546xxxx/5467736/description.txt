A kung fu thriller set during the Ming Dynasty and centered on a secret service agent (Donnie Yen) in the emperor's court who is betrayed and then hunted by his colleagues.

Donnie Yen is the lethal weapon in 14 Blades, the stylish wuxia film from acclaimed action movie master Daniel Lee (Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon) about Jinyiwei, the feared secret agents of the imperial court in ancient China who were famously clad in brocade costumes. There's probably no better choice than Yen for the headlining role of a hunted Jinyiwei commander, as the film offers plenty of opportunities for the martial arts superstar to flex his muscles. Further boosting the film's appeal are his attractive co-stars including Mainland actress Vicki Zhao (Red Cliff), Taiwan pop idol Wu Chun of Fahrenheit (Butterfly Lovers), Hong Kong Film Awards Best New Performer Kate Tsui (Eye in the Sky), and Singaporean actor Qi Yuwu (Painted Skin). Kung fu legend Sammo Hung, Shaw Brothers star Chen Kuan Tai, and veteran Hong Kong actors Wu Ma, Law Ka Ying, and Damian Lau round out the star-studded cast. Nominated for Best Action Choreography and Best Sound Design at the 29th Hong Kong Film Awards, 14 Blades was the top-grossing Chinese blockbuster during the 2010 Chinese New Year holidays. It is a remake of the 1984 Hong Kong film Police Pool of Blood.[citation needed] The theme song, which shares the same Chinese title as the film, is performed by Sa Dingding.
