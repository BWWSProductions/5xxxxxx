,dnstest,2010-04-06T03:01Z,"Stream the show at:

I was able to catch up with all the missed shows at the above link by downloading them directly with Firefox 3.6. Clicking on the desired show gave a prompt to download or play in Winamp. It took less then 10 minutes to get the 3-26 to 4-7 episodes. "
,marius10,2010-04-11T15:31Z,where are the Savage shows? Thanks
,TedKennedy,2010-04-14T19:29Z,"@KurentEweser

Thanks this worked for me too!"
,pageian,2010-04-19T05:08Z,"TedKennedy.... would you let us know how you downloaded the files from that address?  All I can do is play the file within a browser, I haven't seen a way to actually download the files like you said you were able to.  Any insight is appreciated.

Thanks"
,pageian,2010-04-19T05:11Z,"^^  Nevermind.... I used a third party Firefox add-on to get them, thanks anyway.  

Keep up the good work Dr. Savage!"
