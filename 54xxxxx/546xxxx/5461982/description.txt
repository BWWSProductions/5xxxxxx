This is J. River's Media Center, LATEST version to date: 14.0.158.

And it seems to be working... Which I find unusual, after having tried the last couple of hours to find a working recent version of this kick ass app. 

I'm not saying that just because I'm afraid I might get censored if I don't. No, I really mean it. I use it to play lossless audio files and have tried all other players, and find this one is best. 

Scanned it, and it seems clean. Original .rar archive included a trojan, which is of course not included here. Installation did not bring about any complications on my system either. 

Just install and run and apply the patch, and your Media Center will be registered. Don't worry that the patch is for .153, it works perfectly (at least for me).

Finally, please leave some offensive, insulting and/or obscene comments!
