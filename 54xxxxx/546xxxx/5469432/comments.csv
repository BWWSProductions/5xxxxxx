,Slaughtlander,2010-03-28T20:07Z,Yet again another GREAT torrent! Thanks!
,abhikrit,2010-03-29T05:01Z,"specialities of MKVGuy....than others(who rips in small size) & the reasons i go for his torrents:
1. He does not deletes or removes the credits etc to shorten the duration & i love to have FULL & TOTAL movie.
2. Provides the same quality reducing the size to around 40%"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-03-29T06:14Z,thanks mate..
,VxxM,2010-03-29T08:30Z,"aXXo        =  700

MKVGuy   =   400

How can be aXXo = MKVGuy

aXXo = Quality

MKVGuy = Quality

Therefore..

aXXo = MKVGuy 

(aXXo was the Robin Hood in the internet...
Now we have another Robin Hood... MKVGuy...
Specially on the Low Bandwidth..... )

We Love You Man........"
,abhikrit,2010-03-29T10:43Z,you are welcome buddy... so what's next? 
,abhikrit,2010-03-29T10:47Z,"by the way... what's the source for this one as you have mentioned brrip? screens looks nice...have not downloaded yet.....each of your downloads takes just around 1 hour for my connection to download :) 
"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-03-30T04:31Z,"thanks VxxM for the complement..

@abhikrit I used 3.25 gig source The.Blind.Side.BRRIP.MP4.x264.720p-PT

and most of my releases have source of at-least 1.5 gig and max to 4 gig cuz I am on 512kbps line, m planning to get a 1mbps line soon so may be I would start using heavy sources or may be the quantity of releases will increase.."
,VxxM,2010-03-30T09:42Z,"

It's a pleasure buddy...


I'm surprised about your 512 kbps line...
how could u manage your line for uploading files..
my Bandwidth is 512 down & 128 up....
I also want to upload movies.. but i can't manage.. because of my low Bandwidth... but I always seeding for your torrents....


***  If u get a 1mbps line soon.. please don't Upload Larger files than 400 MB

"
,abhikrit,2010-03-30T11:13Z,"@ vxxm
he did not say that he will increase size of his rips..he will increase the size of his source..

@ mkvguy..
well...that was a good source...that's a good copy... i too have the same connection...512kbps... & yeah... i think you dont have to increase the source file....just increase your uploads...& you CAN (upto you) increase your rips to 500 mb...! its just my suggestion... :)"
[V],MKVGuy,2010-03-30T19:42Z,"@abhikrit, I am planning to continue releasing 300-400mb version becuz that's my main motto with 
a) 600mb 480p with 2.1 & 5.1 audio,
and occasionally if ppl like it b) 1Gig 720p with 2.1 & 5.1 audio..
all this when I get my 1mbps line.."
