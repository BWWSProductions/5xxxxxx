,kidio007,2010-03-28T17:35Z,"Works great on my R4i with latest firmware. Is this 100% English? I have played for 2 hours and seems English. I also tried walking in and out of doors for 10 mins, no freezing or black screens."
,Chaalad,2010-03-28T17:38Z,"sorry for asking questions im a noob when it comes to patching, is the file already patched? or do i have to run the xdelta gui.exe and patch it. If so when doing that which patch do i select the version 2.0 caps.patch or the version 2.0 non-caps.patch"
,jonskiblendoodle,2010-03-28T17:50Z,this file is already patched. i just uploaded the others incase anyone needs them in the future.

D_S"
,jonskiblendoodle,2010-03-30T14:23Z,use your downloading program e.g. utorrent and choose the option to create torrent.
,bond697,2010-03-31T05:06Z,"it looks like this patch just converts the rom over to the japanese version and sloppily inserts the english text.  is that all this is doing? so, this isn't actually a fix for the english version?"
,jonskiblendoodle,2010-04-01T07:06Z,"no, i have uploaded the official fix. this is just a work around. and yes it is originally the japanese version. heres a link to the official (U) fix

,jackyc123,2010-04-02T22:35Z,"Hey guys, this didn't work for me on the R4ultra, do you have to patch first, simply copy it to flashcart by itself, or do you have to use it in conjunction with the 1st version of the rom?"
,jonskiblendoodle,2010-04-03T02:45Z,"use the official (U) patch instead. it is 100% english and works on all flashcards. heres a link to my upload.

,jonskiblendoodle,2010-04-03T18:24Z,so rename your save file to the same name as this rom. then you wont have to start again.
,bond697,2010-04-04T18:14Z,"i've been using the one jon has now uploaded here for the last 5 or so days, and it works perfectly and DOESN'T change the rom to a japanese copy.  everyone should really be grabbing his.  glad to see it finally showing up on here."
