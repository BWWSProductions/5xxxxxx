""We tagged this as BDRip, because source is from an Russian Bluray. Audio is from iMAGINE and synced by PRiSM, both THNX. Its still a LiNE audio, dont think its retail.""

So sounds (and looks) like the video is from a Russian BDRip and the audio from a DVDscr (synced correct). So event though the video quality is very good - the audio is still crap."
