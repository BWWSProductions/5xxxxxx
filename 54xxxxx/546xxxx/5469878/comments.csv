,bitslap,2010-09-20T10:46Z,"this works for me on Win 7, but if you have 1.5 gigs to throw away I'd suggest opening with winrar and extracting it to your data drive so you don't have to wait 15 minutes to extract next time.

thanks a lot.  it was harder to find this late in the year"
,voyager1972,2010-12-18T10:38Z,"the keygen does not work
so this is a camplete waste of time"
,Dr_Nain,2011-02-09T23:53Z,"Work perfectly on win7 x64.

IMPORTANT : When you copy/paste the request code from AutoCAD to keygen, remove spaces btw each 4 digits!

Hope this help. Thx to rubengarciajr."

Here is the 64bit keygen only! 

run as admin, paste the request code, generate, paste the new key. the last two boxes SHOULD be blank!! Use the very first code you get back with your internet off and, cha ching!"
,jsttrrn,2011-02-17T00:52Z,"well lets hope this works! this isn't the keygen for all legal and intensive purposes.

it will however assist you in obtaining a full activation ;-)

,hdvtgsd,2011-03-20T11:52Z,"""Mem Patch"" wont work for me. :-(

I follow all instructions very carefully, but every time I click on ""Mem Patch"" I get the following error:
""You can only apply patch when Licence screen appears"".

And of course I click on ""xf-A201-64bits.exe"" when AutoCAD Licence Screen Appears.

Here's what I do:
- Totaly disconnect Internet, firewall, antivirus and antimallware.
- Install AutoCAD, and restart the PC after installation completes.
- Start AutoCAD, and right click on ""xf-A201-64bits.exe"", and Run As Administrator.
- When Licence Screen Appears, I click on ""Mem Patch"", and here comes the error: ""You can only apply patch when Licence screen appears"". :-(


So I ask you:
- What do I do wrong???
- Or is there another way to Apply patch???"
