Graphic adaptation of Richard Matheson's 1954 holocaust survivor novel. 

A devastating epidemic breaks out all over the world. The infected transform into vampire like creatures that must sleep during the day and roam the earth at night. One lone human survivor, Robert Neville, must live a life of stark loneliness during the day, and absolute peril at night.

Adapted by Steve Niles and Elman Brown and originally published in 1991 by Eclipse Comics, it was later collected into a trade paperback by IDW Publishing.
