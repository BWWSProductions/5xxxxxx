Slide guitar king Roy Rogers (not to be confused with the old cowboy star of the same name) has played with everyone from John Lee Hooker to Bonnie Raitt to John Gorka, and that musical range is the key to what makes Slit Decision tick. Stylistically speaking, Rogers mixes things up more than ever before on this album, moving from stomping Chicago blues to expressive, Ry Cooder-like moments to blues-rock and even singer/songwriter territory. Rogers' raw vocal style may be an acquired taste but his fleet-fingered slide skills are the connecting thread throughout Split Decision's many musical detours.
