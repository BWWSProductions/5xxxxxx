Seriously, both of you grow up and stop bickering like a pair of children.

TPB isn't a place for you two to follow each other around to different Torrents and argue.

You're both demonstrating how immature a person can get, each topping the other with ever reply.

So please, stop arguing on TPB at least, if you're going to argue please give each other your E-Mails and do it there.

Also both of you, just because a Torrent doesn't work for you, doesn't mean it's broken, I've seen both of you claim that certain working Torrents aren't working, I know they work because the ones you tried, I tried and eventually got to work, maybe if you argued less you would both have time to, let's see, fix the obvious?"
,dekoko,2010-03-30T17:52Z,"to save game just run the game as a administrator...and save works fine

and for those who cant run the game just use reloaded crack...works fine here"
,Harrier125,2010-03-30T20:28Z,"@ Scorpion1311

TPB isn't for you and your little partner in crime to run around screaming at each other, get over your self, seriously, learn to ignore another person and grow up, it's called being mature, something you should be by now, in fact I think you are, you just enjoy doing what you do.

You never said a torrent didn't work, but you said a file is broken, which wasn't, because mine and many others worked fine.

Anyhow I'm not going to get into an argument with you, I know I'm mature and you aren't so I'll keep it at that.

Oh and I believe your whole argument started with you jumping into Dogs argument.

Nice contradiction there kid, lolol.

Also telling two idiots to stop bickering and being racist isn't being an ""internet cop"" as you put it, it's called being aware, something you aren't, because you would of stfu with that racist idiot by now.

I G N O R E D .

Anyhow this Torrent works well, the game isn't amazing, but it's very fun, using the grappling hook is some of the most fun I've had in a game before.

Also this game does not need Steam running or on your PC in anyway to Run, I'm not sure my self why those files are there but they can be ignored if you wish.

I'd give this game a 8.1 / 10."
,Harrier125,2010-03-30T20:47Z,"Installation Guide:

,Nabarun,2010-04-05T01:34Z,"raclim1,
Install something like ultraISO or Virtual CD or Daemon Tools, and use that software to ""mount"" the sr-jc2p.iso file into a virtual drive. Inside that virtual drive you will find cool stuff to play with and ask more questions about. But before you bother again, I suggest you learn a thing or two about computers, and more importantly, learn to help yourself by using google and wikipedia etc. All the best."
,raclim1,2010-04-05T14:48Z,"@Nabarun

I already opened the RAR file with deamon tools and with PowerIso and there is no JustCause2_Launcher.exe inside it...:-O  and in the crack/missing file torrent there isn't a JustCause2_Launcher.exe either. Oh and believe me yesterday i searched for 2 hours on google."

You are right, I am a stupid moron.
However,There is NO rar file. Only 1 iso file and 1 nfo file. The JustCause2_Launcher.exe file is not part of THIS torrent. That is included in the updated DLC pack release. You can get it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5471169/Just_Cause_2_Limited_Edition_Content_DLC-SKIDROW

Now my rant begins...

THIS PIECE OF SHIT DOESN'T FUCKING WORKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!! 

In xp I am told that (even after installing that DLC shit) the application requires a hihjer version of windows. I go to 7even and double-click it, and it runs smoothly... at least the main menu. Then when I want to start a new game, it starts to load and then the sounds start but the screen is stuck at the loading screen. I have a fairly powerful PC and even the benchmarks run great at high settings. I thought there must be something wrong with the installation, so I uninstalled everything and cleaned up the registry and all and reinstalled in 7even, but still stuck at loading screen.

,Darth_Adversor,2010-08-29T01:55Z,"So, I started with the RELOADED release of the game, no luck.  Get all the way to launching the game, get a white screen, but then an error message a couple seconds later.  

So I figured I would try this one.  Same problem.  Some people are saying it's the x64 version of Windows 7 that's the problem, others are saying it works for them.  I've been downloading games and other programs for years and have always been able to get them to work.  This is the first one to ever give me so much trouble.  

Anyone have any ideas?  "
,Darth_Adversor,2010-08-30T23:48Z,"DirectX drivers!  If you're installing the game correctly, but unable to launch it, make sure you have all the latest DirectX updates.  

I was having the worst time trying to figure out how to make this damned game work, but the answer was right in front of my dumb ass the whole time.  "

,anus9,2010-10-02T01:46Z,"!!!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME !!!!!

!!!!! NICHT RUNTERLADEN !!!!!

trust me!! i downloaded this, got sued and have to pay now 650€!! (especially if youre downloading from germany, you can be SURE that this will also happen to you, otherwise do it at your own risk, i recommend you not to do it)
since this is the second time i got sued (~1000€) i deleted utorrent and will never use it again. you should also do it. the time of p2p and torrents is over. find another way to download!
TRUST ME!"
,SkeletalBat,2010-10-06T13:04Z,"Just like anus9 I have been sued for downloading (Sweden). I am to pay a fine of €700 (6500 kronor) for downloading this.

I have talked with some lawyers and it seems like a pain in the ass to actually fight this so I will be paying the fine and uninstalling utorrent as well as formatting my HDD to get rid of all my downloads. :(

Do not make the same mistake as I did!"
,jszipsp,2010-10-06T22:56Z,SkeletalBat & anus9 - idiots thats why there's peer block or whatever its called ... what this does is prevents your isp from invading your privacy..... there breaking the law if they know what ur downloading lol. i don't have that trouble ... yet besides u don't get sued straight off u get warnings first if that happens then u gota take sum action 
,jszipsp,2010-10-06T22:58Z,oh and ps i think those 2 are copyright agents or whatever there called trying to keep good pirates down YAAARRRGH!!
,donaschan,2010-10-10T00:13Z,@jszipsp I agree with you. Those guys posted on the other Just Cause 2 Torrent as well. Its all scare tactics.
,robin123654,2010-10-13T05:10Z,"Its pathetic.its more like the time of buying games is over :P

,flizza,2010-10-16T15:55Z,"darth_adversor's comment solved my problem, done everything in the instructions still nothing, but updating directx and video card drivers solved my problem of not being able to launch the game

this just cause 2 skidrow release works!!!"
,damnlogin,2010-11-02T14:52Z,Get a better ISP if you gotta pay that fine and Don't lie There is not a chance in hell this happened to you in sweden
,.7z,2010-11-12T14:52Z,"great torrent, took a few days to download but well worth it. Mounted the iso with PowerISO, opened the drive to get the SKIDROW folder and copied the cracks over. the game installed perfectly and is running without any problems. 

if this torrent doesn't work for you then its likely its something to do with your computer rather than the game.

seeding!
