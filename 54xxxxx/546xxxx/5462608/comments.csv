,lilars26,2010-03-25T14:27Z,"So you do sleep.I love you 20/40.For all the things that you have shared with me and for 
all the advice you have given me I thank you.I wish I could seed more than my share but I can`t afford a better I.P. connection.It is from you that I learned to be a responsible seeder.I don`t blame you for dropping shows that are high in hit and runs.Do what you have to and know that this has been a positive experience for many.Enjoy your days as best you can and take care of yourself.

,grayscales,2010-03-25T16:06Z,"Hi 2040.

Lilars26 said it above better than I could.  I second all she said, except maybe changing ""love"" to ""like""  : ).

Like her, I have limited bandwidth.  I seed all torrents I download to at least a 1.0 share ratio.  My torrent client is set to unlimited up- and -download speed.  TV shows and most movies I download I get from you.  While I don't often say so, I do thank you very much for your efforts in making all those files available.  Their quality and size is greatly appreciated.    

Is there anything I can change in my downloading process that would help you out?  Like download less (ugh!) but seed to 1.5?

Take care,
Gray"

Amazing quality? Hmmm... well, on a 44"" Bravia the quality is exactly what one would expect from 140Mb... shite.
Must look great on an iPod, for those tards who would even think of watching videos on a micro screen.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world waits for a decent xvid (PC, Mac, PS3, Xbox etc.).""
------------------------------------------------------
This week till today:

1. Upped 24 torrents.
2. Number of finished downloads: 12460
   Number of seeders 924 (but over 65%   of ""seeders"" seed practically nothing)

3. Number of ANY TYPE OF COMMENT:
    46
   Number of ""Thanks"": 28
   Number of garbage as above one: 2

In short, no one can help - people who visit and leave either Thanks or show any kind of appreciation is - NEGLIGIBLE.

Unfortunately, you are - insignificant. Rare. 
But - lukewarm. Maybe evolution has different path."
,mdaddio,2010-03-25T18:13Z,Thank you  very much! You are appreciated by me.
,lilars26,2010-03-25T18:30Z,"@20/40 Do not let the ninapuss's of the world get you down.They are insignificant.
@the rest of you   It only takes a minute to say thank you.If you don't know how to comment go to the bottom of this page and click on login.Then follow the instructions."
,jon4fun,2010-03-25T18:46Z,"@ ALL - If your a 'real' fan of 20-40 and don't like foul language then do NOT read this comment. 
You have been warned!

@20-40. Sorry but I have to react to this 'ninapuss' bitch.
What torrent did that comment originate in?

I would like to respond to the comment as she strikes me as the type of person who will come back just to see what sort of shitstorm she has created.

I want to shove that 42"" TV up her ass which would shut her up as that is what she is talking out of.

@ All & 20-40, Sorry! This rant is aimed at not only this ninapuss bitch but others like her and H&R fucks also.
I've had it with being nice. Let TPB ban me. I don't care. Enough is fucking enough.

20-40 is the nicest guy in the world and look what has happened!

It begs the question, is there a point in TRYING to do your best - to be nice etc. - when dealing with greedy, ignorant fools?

Sorry 20-40. I know the above breaks a few of your rules. 
However, I'm only apologising for breaking 'your rules' NOT for what I said.

Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-25T20:07Z,"(RELUCTANTLY, I WOULD POST THIS E-MAIL MESSAGE - because yahoo mail has gone fishing and bounced-back this, send to your e-mail before this has happened). It fits in here, and others can read that one too, even if some ""bad"" words have been used.
--------------------------------------------------------
Dear Jon,

life taught you and me hardest way possible about true, well hidden nature of the human kind.
We are bombarded with Oprah type shit and new age pseudo religions/beliefs and old religious stuff how deep inside humans are good, kind and emphatic specie. Bullocks. Total, self-indulgent lie. That NEVER ever was true, and we have experienced and suffered every aspect of that mirage, and others have too, but they have been blind AND blinded by own POWs (remember my mentioning of private universes and god(s) last week) and bubbles they inhabits and revolve around.
Even today, lilars and grayscales and (sorry) you have offered to increase your uploading amount. Increase what for? To 12000 fuckers does that sacrifice make any difference at all?
Be realistic, I have 24 regulars. Twentyfour. About plus/minus 42 people who stay as seeders longer than two days.

Now - putting that in context - against/confronted to/as opposite to - TWELVE thousand! 

Have you watched a movie ""300"" about things that never have happened? Another fat lie from Greeks?
Have you watched movie named ""42""? You did, I was there. It is about the same shit, but this movie was more like documentary, about things that really happened.

Point is, and I told you the same thing months ago - FEW people can bust their asses, seed to ratio 100 - but, truth to be told - it CANNOT make any difference. Even theoretically, it cannot change a thing.

True ratio - ONE about amount of good versus bad people with totally or partially corrupted or skewed hard-wiring, intrinsics and POW in general is THE SAME as the number of seeders. Percentage is the same. Minority versus majority. Been doomed from the start.

Oh my friend, I need fresh air, and I cannot get one. Breeze from Sherwood has stopped and scent of rotten sea-grass, smell of rotten fish and thrown away empty shells has taken over one bay where pirates lived long ago, but now is filled with zombies, mad sheep and lunatics. 

Your friend, 20-40"
,the_shroud,2010-03-26T01:01Z,"Thanks for all your effort.
Looking on the bright side, your torrents do seem to be quite tenacious. Just when you think that it would be still born or suffer a cot death under these harsh climate.... it picks itself up..... one step at a time and refuses to go extinct :D
There's enough of us to keep it alive even though 99% of the bytes we upload when seeding are wasted on vultures ..... we'll keep giving and inevitably someone worthy comes along to pick up the baton and continue the run."
,madtown4,2010-03-26T01:12Z,"today they moved the price of a movie ticket to $17.00 dollars , I dont know about you but for me and my family to go see one movie . it would cost over $100 bucks . now twenty forty did something for all of us and witch he did for free,( mind you) all he asked is for us to give back. there is times where i cant seed as much as i want to , but if i had better ways of doing so i would . well i cant afford to go to the movies and alot of familys cant afford it to. so twentyforty has helped us all out by giving us GREAT QUALITY UPLOADS. That i cant afford other wise. THANK YOU twentyforty you are the best . to all the h&R's you just dont know what you did to the best person on the net. i know people wont change, but for  me you let me know how it's important to and how to share . thank you for all the work you have done. and please stay healthy . this world needs more 20/40's in it. "
,lilars26,2010-03-26T02:25Z,"17 bucks....OUCH.I haven't been to the show
for years and at those prices it will have to
be a special occasion.Maybe I could get the
seniors discount although I'm not technically
a senior. "
,madtown4,2010-03-26T02:31Z,"@lilars yes $17.00 bucks . it hurts the pocket .you know thanks to 20/40 the quality and the size he brings , helps so much . some people just dont get it and they never will . "
,lilars26,2010-03-26T17:53Z,"@ grayscales ""Like her""? Just to set the record straight,I'm a heterosexual male.When I used the word love I didn't mean it in a sexual way."
,grayscales,2010-03-27T15:24Z,"@ lilars26.
I apologize for my assumption - it was stupid on my part and I meant no harm.  Please forgive me.
I liked what you said to 2040 in your first post above.  Again, sorry.
Gray"
,lilars26,2010-03-27T23:27Z,@grayscales I know you didn't.Funny thing is when I started downloading from twentyforty I thought he was a woman.I called him mam and was quickly straightened out.
,grayscales,2010-03-28T16:51Z,"@ lilars26.  Ah well, this wasn't the first time I've guessed wrong.  For those times, a picture would have helped... and a DNA test in one case  : )"
,lilars26,2010-03-28T21:18Z,"@ grayscales
Ha,I hear ya."
