,Jack_Raiden,2010-04-08T19:53Z,"Quality looks better than the other HQ (320 Kbps) release on TPB.
(via Audacity Plot Sectrum) Still sounds bad-ish to me, though. *sigh*"
,download_dude112,2010-04-08T23:08Z,"Thank you!
I dont know what ""Jack_Raiden""
Is talking about
I think the quality is pretty good.
I think its just because MGMT has so many effects on their voices, ect.

Its a perfect file size for me.
Not too big, not too small.

Whether this is a legit CD Rip or not, It still sounds pretty good"
,Shp00N,2010-04-28T10:38Z,"i agree, it sounds good"
,hughisGOD,2010-05-04T22:26Z,"Terrible album, don't waste your time downloading it. MGMT really shit the bed with this one."
,Lunar52,2010-05-10T04:26Z,MGMT is amazing. Thanks lunuz89 :)
,29-4-life,2010-06-14T21:50Z,The quality of the rip is absolutely fine but the album as a whole is..well a hole. Waste your time if you dare
,boamama,2010-08-22T13:33Z,"@ hughisGOD 

Well, that's a very subjective statement. I prefer this album to ""Oracular Spectacular""."

Thank you linuz89!
Works fine :)"
