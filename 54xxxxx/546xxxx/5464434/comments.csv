,rrmerlin51D,2010-03-26T02:28Z,Thanks.  But should be epi. 13.
,stales89,2010-03-26T02:50Z,"Yeah it says EPisode 13 - Blowback on the UK TV guide anyways, not sure what the ABC site says as I'm from UK but thanks anyway, whether it's Episode 12 or 13, it's the next in the series so it's all good for me!

,rrmerlin51D,2010-03-26T03:25Z,Right.  Epi. is still great.  Just noticed IMDB.  No problem.  Many thanks.
,nyxin,2010-03-26T05:36Z,"it SHOULD be episode 12. season premiere was a 2 part episode and SHOULD be labled EP11A and EP11B (if you want to distinguish the 2 hour airdate)

....now when dvd's come out, then we can argue further =P"

,IrmaIsfot,2010-03-26T12:05Z,"Well...  On the ABC website http://abc.go.com/shows/flash-forward/episode-guide the dropdown list of episodes labels this one, aired 20100325, as Ep 13 ""Blowback"".  In that list, there is no Ep. 12.  I'd say this list should be considered the 'Official' one!"
,koka3,2010-03-26T18:03Z,Thanks
,Persekarva,2010-03-30T22:54Z,Strange because on www.tv.com this one is listed as Episode 13 - Blowback. I cant find Episode 12 - Revelation Zero anywhere on tpb...
