"It's hard to find words to describe this album because much of what is communicated is in the sonorities of the synthesizers, which are crisp and clear, rich and subtle, very musical and intelligent - a far cry from the tinsel and plastic kinds of sounds that are, unfortunately, so common in electronically generated music. Keyboardist Tim Story is not just a pianist transplanted onto a synthesizer, but is a true artist in the electronic medium." -- Victory Review, USA

"This album testifies to the composer's development and mastery - music which is utterly accessible, yet timeless and profound." -- Bridgeport Sunday Post, USA

If someone wants this in FLAC, leave a comment, I'd be glad to.

I will keep this torrent alive, but my upload speed is utterly slow, so please help your fellow downloaders by seeding as long as you can. Thanks!
