(i now see bricktop actually did lower the audio bitrate alittle, he obviously knows what hes doing)"
[T],bricktophd,2010-03-25T05:17Z,thats the lowest 5.1 audio u can go and i will be releasing 8 gig versions next week

,brentm84,2010-03-25T06:30Z,Contrary to what everyone thinks the PS3 CAN hold files larger than 4 gigs. The only problem is you would have to copy it over a network onto the PS3 since it only recognizes FAT32 drives. Ive done it several times using PS3mediaserver.
,teabag87,2010-03-25T07:15Z,"the ps3 hdd's are in FAT32 format.... look it up, you cannot actually write a file onto that drive larger then 4gb.  Has nothing to do with the ps3 or the network, just the hdd's format.  just like an ipod.

You can stream a movie to the ps3 via a network, but thats terrible with so much lag (nobody refute that, i have almost 4 TB of movies hooked up to my ps3, to load them all via streaming, believe me, it lags)"
[T],bricktophd,2010-03-25T16:40Z,u can put a file on the ps3 bigger than 4 gigs but not on a external hard drive and have the ps3 read it. i have put 25 gig files on my ps3.
,Gigantoad,2010-03-25T19:28Z,"teabag87, I refute that very much indeed. There's something wrong with your network. I've been doing this 1.5 years now. All my movies are on a Synology NAS and stream directly to the PS3, 720p and 1080p alike. Not a single issue.

Perhaps you use a wireless network? I imagine that could be problematic."
,CBest,2010-03-27T05:18Z,"Why not cut the movie in 2 parts of 4gb e/a?
That's what I've done for FAT partitions."
,laserX,2010-03-28T19:55Z,Looking forward to the 8gb version. Love your uploads. 
,InstantStarFan7,2010-03-30T05:52Z,Thanks a bunch for these LOTR blu ray rips! They look awesome! :)

,NailZ,2010-05-28T03:48Z,"Damn another ""jitter ps3 encode"" 

Nothing more annoying than the title screen coming up and its jittering all around.

plz brick release the 8 gig u said u would and never did ;)
"
,MrBigglesw0rth,2010-06-10T13:57Z,"@NailZ

An extra 4GB isnt going to magically make jitter go away. If their is an issue say it, dont pretend to know how to fix it with something that stupid."
