[V],Kitlope,2010-03-27T07:07Z,Awesome! Thanks for this
,gHighway,2010-03-27T11:03Z,"Well done, a fantastic piece of work, can fill in the holes in my FLA collection until I get round to buying them - Cheers.

Just one additional comment: One band you missed in your list of pioneers are the band which arguably started the Industrial movement along with Throbbing Gristle in the late 70's is Cabaret Voltaire.

I do love FLA, Front 242 and Skinny Puppy. I just wish someone would upload a complete discography of Skinny as I only have a couple of albums on CD.

Thanks NINgod"
[V],Kitlope,2010-03-27T15:03Z,"gHighway, there's a ton of SP over at Demonoid available and actually a torrent thats a discography. I just grabbed a bunch myself over the last few days"
,gHighway,2010-03-28T00:13Z,"Thanks Kitlope - I have never been to Demonoid, but will wander over. Heads up appreciated."
,spacy,2010-05-04T00:58Z,Really nice. Thanks for the work put into this. Skinny Puppy next? ;-)

It's too bad TPB let this die. I would help out but i can't now. Sorry! Go to demonoid, they still have it up."
,The_Adept,2011-03-12T03:33Z,"Just a nitpick but ""Nerve War"" is all mp3 so this is not 100% lossless.  Still excellent."
,The_Adept,2011-03-12T03:37Z,Reading comprehension is my friend.  I see the note about Nerve War in the comments. =)
