the next series, which begins at easter this year,
is officially labeled as Series 5. i didn't know that
when i posted this.

this video is from the box set called "The Complete
Specials", which runs from Christmas 2008 until
tennant's finale in January 2010.

i called it S5 because to me it was the full 5th
series, even though it was only specials.

i don't know what the scene groups are going to call
the next series with matt smith.

this is my own dvd rip and encode.
