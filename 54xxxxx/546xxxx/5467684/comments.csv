will let us know if things have improved.We can only hope."
,the_shroud,2010-03-27T18:30Z,"Brilliant m8 :D u just seem to know the movies I've missed out on and been meaning to watch. 

Just finished watching 'sunrise; excellent movie. Was really slow to download but now seeding at decent speed."
,the_shroud,2010-03-27T18:58Z,"I checked the imdb site below n it says runtime only 97min but the size as almost as big as both 'sunrise n 'sunset put together?
Not complaining, just curious for knowledge; learned a lot from you on this site "

,nemesis160,2010-03-27T19:59Z,hey 20-40 could u please upload the movie JFK (1992) .........please.......all the other torrents are either too big or bad in quality .........thanks 
,nemesis160,2010-03-27T20:02Z,hey sorry its jfk year 1991 instead of 1992
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-27T20:32Z,"@nemesis160: I have seen your first request few days back. Look - this is 3h09 long movie, available rips are big with good reason and I must step on the brakes regarding requests.

Both facts prevent me from any consideration, especially after recent experience with ""Bobby"" and few other requests including historical and politically ""colored"" movies. It is good movie, no doubt about. Stone's masterpiece.
Regarding MY COSTS to get DVD and time to encode and up the torrent my answer is honest and firm - no. Sorry."

Now, spot the line Bit rate, OK? That is what determines final size of my encodings. I have NOT size as target (as Scene groups does, for example 350 or 700 MB). I find very stupid to waste the same amount of the space (and bandwidth - because encodes have purpose ONLY by spreading between people) for movie 1h34 long and 1h46 one...
Another, very important factor is frame-size, this one is 640x360 (hence 360p) and BeforeSes are 480x272 (272p). Bigger frame-sizes needs higher bit-rates what gives - bigger file-size.

Hope I explained something."
,the_shroud,2010-03-28T00:49Z,"Yes, thank you very much. Must feel like teaching 2+2 to 3 year old kids. Very much appreciated.
Have enjoyed all your downloads either way you encode them. Excellent quality, and I only watch them on 37"" LCD "
,nemesis160,2010-03-29T19:17Z,ok cool man no more requests from my side
