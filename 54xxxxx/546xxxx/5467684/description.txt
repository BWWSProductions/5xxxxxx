PLOT: Bianca Stratford is pretty and popular, but her strict family wonâ€™t allow her to date until her older sister does: the problem is that sister Kat is an outsider who tries to alienate any guy who might be interested in her. So Biancaâ€™s would-be boyfriend bribes fellow outsider Patrick to ask out Kat, thinking that this sullen young man with a mysterious past might tempt Kat to rise to the challenge.
