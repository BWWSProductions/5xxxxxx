and sharing it with the rest. "
,touchmyspecialplace,2010-03-30T21:39Z,If I get this in 24 hours I'll seed it at 20Mbit/s  to a ratio of 15:1
,calvorin,2010-03-30T22:33Z,I too will be seeding if this finally comes through... just one or two more seeders and it'll open the floodgates.  But it keeps dropping back to 0 seeds.  Just hope this collection is worth the hastle.
,marcusanton,2010-03-31T01:35Z,Also waiting at 90 %. Ill try again tommorow
,marcusanton,2010-04-01T01:24Z,seeding at 500kb/sec collection is worth the wait imho.
,zeobo,2010-04-01T08:55Z,looks as though there are plenty of seeders.... I have reopened the torrent to my max bandwidth yet again......
