Smart Scroll makes scrolling smoother, faster and more comfortable:

* Super Scroll offers smooth and easy iPhone-like scrolling. It improves even Magic Mouse, and it lets you reverse scrolling on the Mac to match your iPhone. Try it!

* Hover Scroll makes scrolling as easy as pointing to the top or bottom edge of a window.

* Grab Scroll gives you a  tool to easily move (with momentum) any window's contents.

* Universal Scroll Keys gives you use the same set of keys for scrolling in all applications. This gives you consistent, dependable scrolling everywhere, without having to remember which app uses which keys and without always having to reach for the mouse.

Scroll Keys use a kind of keyboard shortcut which doesn't involve hitting letter keys, thus avoiding conflicts with existing key combinations. You hold one of these keys and tap one of the others.
