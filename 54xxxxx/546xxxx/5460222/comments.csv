,Mastercool,2010-05-11T00:28Z,"Man Ive been trying to get this to work on W7 for ages

When starting it after mounting it with Daemon tools light, it says Cd cannot be located.
Also Havent found a working crack yet, only virus crap and things ending in crashes"
,amigaOS,2010-12-07T22:21Z,"Game does not work on Vista Enterprise 32bit. Tried with all combinations in compatibility options and ""run as administrator"" without any luck. Game boots,, plays the small intro but when entering the menus, slows down and stops responding to input (keyboard), although Process Explorer shows it up running. Moreover, it has a cpu leak, consuming 100% of my one core (dual core system). Need to perform more tests and get back to you all..."

[T],lonesomecowboy,2011-06-30T00:29Z,"Important for newer PCs with multi-core CPU:

[drive letter]:\Expendable\go.exe -nocputest

Otherwise you might get problems running the game at all."
