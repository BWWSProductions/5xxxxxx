       DMT release is oversized (738,562,048 bytes).                
                                                                    
       Nuke:       
       It was also nuked for bad ivtc and was suggested it's a      
       reencode from a clean ntsc screener, but we doubt that.      
       Seems like a typical nasty conversion from NTSC source to    
       PAL, those can never be perfect when the original isn't      
       shot on film/progressive. The end result is many times       
       as it is with DMT's release, missing frames, dupe frames,    
       excessive blending and so on.                                
                                                                    
       This movie as with many docus is a mixure of all sorts       
       of footage/source material, 30fps, 24fps, ametuer homemade,  
       wiggly shoulder cams, shit quality archive material etc.     
       We prefer to keep it at 30fps to avoid decimating valid      
       frames and creating jerkiness on the 30fps parts.            
                                                                    
       Expect scenes with dupe frames, ghosting, field shifting     
       and general crapiness.
