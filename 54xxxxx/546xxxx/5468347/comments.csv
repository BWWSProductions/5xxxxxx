PS ( B4 the Ozzie GP - Can't see anyone beating the RB's - Seb is simply superb ... but I'd like Mark to win his home GP + methinks he's doing enough to win  - just got to get to that first corner first ....  ( which wont be easy ) Prediction ...... Seems like a lot of worn nerves out there - so what the bet on a big shunt at turn 1. PS Can Ya beat 250 and 1.90.
