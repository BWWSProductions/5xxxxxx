,Fuqthegovt,2011-09-26T18:51Z," Just from the fact that a 90 min show is only 225MB should tell the fact that the quality is shittier than an dynamited outhouse without even needing to dl/watch it. Too bad there's no better quality version anywhere so stuck with taking tylenol so I don't get a migraine from watching it. 
 It's like 720x404/640x480 1200mbit divx/xvid is the plague or something. Come on, it's not the 90's anymore, decent tuner/capture cards are cheap and if you're on dial-up you shouldn't be torrenting. "

Fuck you, uploader.  Fuck you until your asshole is purple donkey asshole.

Cunt."
