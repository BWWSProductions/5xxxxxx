Tonight however, faced with this otherwise challenging german translation, its come up empty."
,Starbeer,2011-08-15T05:10Z,"There are subs available on the web: google by the film's name + ""subs"".

BTW, a message to BTARENA.org, GO STICK YOUR LABEL ON YOUR ARSE, NOT ON THE FILM!!

BTARENA.org==SHITE!!!"
