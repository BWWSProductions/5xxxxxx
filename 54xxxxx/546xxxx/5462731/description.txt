              Genre...........: Comedy

       5/6 - Comedy news quiz hosted by David Mitchell which plays on 
       the fact that some news stories are so hard to believe you'd 
       think they'd been made up. In this show some of them have been.
       
       Three celebrity contestants - a mixture of comedians, smart 
       celebrities and wildcard bookings - are locked away in a media-
       free zone - 'the bubble' - for four days. No phones, no 
       television, no internet access. When they're brought out into the 
       studio, they're shown a series of news reports, headlines and 
       images from TV, newspapers and celebrity gossip magazines. They 
       have to identify the true stories from the fakes, but because 
       they've been away and out of touch - just like when you come back 
       from a holiday - they'll believe almost anything. Truth is so 
       often stranger than anything they could possibly imagine.
       
       Guests in this edition are Katy Brand, Josie Long and Tim Key.
