http://www.filemaker.com/products/demos/

Difference between Advanced and ""beginner"":
Advanced is designed for professionals who design their databases.  It has features like script debugging, variable monitoring, database analysis tools, etc.  

Designing a database can be as powerful as designing a program in a language, but learning is easier, especially with the tools.  But it can also involve the same debugging issues.

Regular Filemaker Pro can design files but without the tools.  It is usually purchased for users who use databases designed by professionals.  Cheaper."

,Jbruces,2011-07-12T01:46Z,"Verrrry cool...works perfectly!
thanks!"
,deeturtle,2011-08-11T06:09Z,busted.  i registered the software with the serial and got an email that said it was on the counterfeit software list!! 
,666Gott,2011-11-25T16:35Z,"deeturtle, you ignorant piece of shit.

You actually think that you can download pirated software and then go ahead to try to register it, just like if you had actually bought the software?

Scumbags like you are the reason serial numbers get blacklisted and pirated software stops working.

Suggestion:

Get a gun, shoot your worthless self, in the fucking head, to put yourself out of TPB's misery."
