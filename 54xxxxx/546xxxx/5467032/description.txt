PS: Tagged with permission from djfred. This is not a djfred release, however I have tagged him so that more people see this and it gets more seeders.  The quality is as good or very close to as good as djfred's releases and like his releases, they will always be NTSC R1 with English audio.  Subs will always very from dvd to dvd.
