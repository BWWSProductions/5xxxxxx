[T],zombifuzz,2010-03-29T00:44Z,are you part of the djfred crew? i've had a hard time figuring out who is because there seems to be new people all the time then they disappear.  if so let me know so i can download from you and help you seed man.
[T],ctang,2010-03-29T02:44Z,"@zombifuzz: i am in the process of getting on his team...i would love nothing more than to be a part of his team but to answer your question, as of right now ""no"""
[T],zombifuzz,2010-03-29T03:01Z,"Djfred is absolutely amazing.  are you upping movies you personally own? i would like to see more from you if you have alot of movies because i am a movie addict and its hard to find dvd r torrents with menus and all extras included.  i would definately help you seed your torrents for as long as possible if you continued putting retail dvd rs up.

and thank you for actually responding to me."
[T],ctang,2010-03-29T08:32Z,"hey no problem...it makes me so mad when i ask something on here and no one has the common courtesy to respond back

ya i own these movies...i own close to 600+/-movies and 95% of them have menus and extras (about the only ones that dont have all the extras are the ones i have downloaded from djfred)...if you have any requests i am always willing to upload them...they will always be dvd-r's and thanks a lot for actually seeding...if you download this (well any of what i have uploaded), it would be nice if you (or anyone) would mention quality and whether or not its worth downloading...thanks, ctang"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-03-29T22:05Z,"not a problem man.  anything brand new is a sure bet for download, but i am a HUGE horror fan.  so if you have any crazy horror movies im down for seeding them forever!  have a good day man."
[T],ctang,2010-03-29T23:23Z,"unfortunately i am not a huge horror fan, but i love classic comedies like this one and Major Leage 1&2 and Animal House...i do have a few tho like (new) Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Saw's and Last House On The Left and probably a few more"
