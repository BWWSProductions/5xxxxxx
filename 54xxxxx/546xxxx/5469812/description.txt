With the breakthrough success and worldwide respect that Queensryche gained from their conceptual masterpiece OPERATION: 
MINDCRIME, how could the band possibly outdo or at the least match themselves? Just two years after the release of MINDCRIME ... 
Full DescriptionQueensryche reinvented themselves (though certainly not for the last time). While many fans were clamoring for a 
conceptual sequel, the band returned to a song-oriented approach that was more art rock and less metal-edged. 

Now quite far removed from the fantasy and techno-paranoia lyrical themes of their earlier works, the band tackled overcoming 
social and physical handicaps ("Best I Can"), poverty, and regret ("Della Brown"). Focused much less on the darker side of love 
that was always so prevalent in their sound, the band was now brave enough to be romantic ("Another Rainy Night" and "Hand On Heart"). 
While Queensryche lost some diehard metal fans with EMPIRE, the mature sound and tight production of Peter Collins (Rush) saw the 
band break into the mainstream (and top off at #9 on the Billboard singles chart) with the Pink Floyd-inspired "Silent Lucidity."
