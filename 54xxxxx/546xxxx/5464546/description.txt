Aired 25.03.2010

"FLOYD"

Liz reevaluates her feelings for an old flame, Floyd 
(Guest Star Jason Sudeikis), when he returns with 
big news, and Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) teaches 
Danny Baker (Guest Star Cheyenne Jackson) the finer 
points of pranks after the TGS writers play a trick 
on him. Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy 
Jordan (Tracy Morgan) see Kenneth Parcell (Jack 
McBrayer) in a disturbing new light after they spend 
a very long day listening to him tell stories about 
his childhood.

Enjoy :)
