I DO NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS PATCH!!!

Some guy online has found a way around the anti piracy on the english versions of Pokemon Heart Gold/Soul Silver. He has copied all the text from the english versions to the japenese version which has already been patched for anti piracy.

These are the Japanese version of Pokemon Heart Gold/Soul Silver with all English text copied from the english rom. It is the best way around the anti piracy on the english roms so far. There are a few things still in japanese such as the pokedex and uneeded conversations. This rom works perfect on just about all flashcards eg R4 although with no$gba there has been some reports of freezing when saving. There has also been some reports of the ysmenu freezing although it seems to work for me perfectly. Enjoy  :)
