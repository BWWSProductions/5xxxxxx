,jonskiblendoodle,2010-03-26T06:30Z,please let me know if this works for you. thanks
,beadleboy1234,2010-03-26T10:15Z,i cannot get this to work on my r4 it is not an nds file how do i get it to work?
,jonskiblendoodle,2010-03-26T10:17Z,its a .rar file. you need to extract it using an unzipping tool such as winrar. just type winrar into google and get it that way. both pokemon nds files are in there.
,beadleboy1234,2010-03-26T10:45Z,CHEERS THE GAME WORKS PERFECTLY 
,jonskiblendoodle,2010-03-27T07:20Z,"if you read the description. you would see that these ""stupid"" roms as you put it, ARE IN JAPANESE. whos the dumb one now?"
,jonskiblendoodle,2010-03-27T19:52Z,honestly you're making an argument out of a tiny little mistake. you're just lazy if you cant be bothered to read the descriptions. and stop complaining. its not like you have to pay for them. grow up and go complain to someone who actually gives a damn.

,jackyc123,2010-04-02T22:17Z,I would use that patch but i cant use my save for this rom with the (U) version and i'm too far through the game to be bothered to start from scratch. If you know any way i can use my (J) .sav on the (U) patch please let me know
,jonskiblendoodle,2010-04-03T03:50Z,"just rename your save file to the name of this rom file. should work perfect (Y) besides. dont bother using this patch. i have uploaded the official (U) patch. it works on all flashcards with no blackscreen and it is 100% english. heres a link.

,jackyc123,2010-04-03T14:51Z,Renaming the save file doesnt work but thanks anyway
,jonskiblendoodle,2010-04-03T18:26Z,it works fine for me. must depend on what flashcard you have. i use R4 1st edition with ysmenu.
