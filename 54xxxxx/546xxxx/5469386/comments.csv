,JaySharp90,2010-10-30T07:16Z,"Some of the episodes in season 6 are EXTREMELY bad quality, with vlc saying they are unreadable. they constantly freeze and need to be restarted and skipped past the freeze point to continue watching, however the freeze continues happening"
,fillinthisspace,2010-12-14T02:38Z,"@JaySharp90,
Did you try them using another player before assuming the video files are the problem and not your ""media player""?
VLC can be odd at times."
