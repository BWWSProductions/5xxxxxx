Lights, camera, axel! The eight-part Sundance Channel original documentary series, BE GOOD JOHNNY WEIR explores the life of one of America's most outspoken and colorful sports figures, three-time U.S. National Figure Skating Champion and World Medalist Johnny Weir. (Rumor has it there will be a ninth part focusing on the Olympics, so keep watching! If my sources post it, I'll upload it here!)
