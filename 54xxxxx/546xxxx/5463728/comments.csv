,Deznaj,2010-03-26T01:57Z,of = or
,DePo316,2010-03-26T21:54Z,"@deznaj no idea. I am not picky, as long as I can read it I'm good. The first 20 volumes are from some other torrent the rest are from http://www.thespectrum.net"
,Deznaj,2010-03-26T22:38Z,"The difference should be easy to spot. Scanlations are always a bit 'messy' and at some point all credit the scanner and translator.

But nevermind, I'll just download one chapter and see for myself. I am picky..."
,DePo316,2010-03-28T07:54Z,"feel free to be as picky as you want, I could read everything just fine and if someone else out there wants to put together a cleaner torrent, they are welcome to. And of course all credit to original scanners and translators. "
