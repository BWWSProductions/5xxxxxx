JOHN CEPHAS & PHIL WIGGINS FLIP FLOP AND FLY
Recorded/Released 1992
Label: Flying Fish
Format: mp3 @320
Time: 39:36



Almost immediately after guitarist/vocalist John Cephas joined forces with harmonicist/vocalist Phil Wiggins in 1978, the blues community took them to heart. Critics and fans proclaimed them as the new champions of the East Coast Piedmont style of blues, a style of music first popularized by artists like Blind Boy Fuller, Rev. Gary Davis, Blind Willie McTell and Blind Blake.

This album showcased the emotional depth capable in Cephas' voice, and the original composition 'The Backbiter' is modern acoustic blues at its best.
