Product Description

Supernatural Science uses a panoply of tools of modern science to illuminate the boundaries of human experience and belief. Dramatic reconstruction is combined with expert interviews and personal testimony to explore phenomena which defy rational explanation.

The power of suggestion can be used to assist medical treatment, or to indoctrinate cult victims. This program examines the consequences of using and abusing this little-understood power.
