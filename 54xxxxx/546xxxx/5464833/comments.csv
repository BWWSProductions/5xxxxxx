,UnmemHam,2011-02-16T09:30Z,"Not sure if this is happening for anyone else, but every few seconds the fps goes to shit and it gets choppy. I used KMPlayer, VLC and windows media player and they all did the same thing."
,mandeepx81,2011-05-22T11:51Z,"The movie goes choppy after every few seconds for the first 10 mins, but after that rest of the movie is fine."
