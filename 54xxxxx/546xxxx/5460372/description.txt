The story, set in 1999, is told in flashback form: in June 1974 a federal justice agent, BenjamÃ­n EspÃ³sito, becomes spellbound by and subsequently entangled in the investigation of the crime of a young woman, brutally raped and murdered inside her house in a Buenos Aires neighbourhood. Her widowed husband, bank employee Ricardo Morales, is shocked by the news; EspÃ³sito vows to find the killer and bring him to justice. In his ordeal he is aided by his alcoholic assistent Pablo Sandoval and a newcomer, the upper class lawyer Irene MenÃ©ndez-Hastings, who takes over as department chief. EspÃ³sito's rivaling partner Romano pins the murder on two immigrant workers so as to get rid of the matter - an issue that enrages EspÃ³sito, who attacks Romano in a fury.
