,booboo332,2010-03-25T03:36Z,"littletrick is getting more and more pathetic by the post.  Even when he thinks he is getting his way he cannot hide the animosity in his heart.

His is the kind of small, hateful mind tyrannies are built upon."
,Moodscapes,2010-03-25T06:57Z,Thanks much! Rush Limbaugh is a dose of sanity in a mostly insane world. God bless.

However with Trickydicky, Sissy Lala and miscellaneous sock puppets spewing their socialist nonsense it reminds me of something Limbaugh said on today's show: that he's been reading blogs and comments (something he usually never does) and he noticed that the people who vote Dem are filled with hate, and they're gloating. Conservative-minded people are in mourning for America because of their love for America.

Liberalism really is a mental illness proven time and again by the unbalanced and unhinged, the liars and deceitful workers, the corrupt and the ignorant.

No matter what country you're in, the liberals and other left-socialist/marxist/communists are all of one mindset: steal from those they imagine are 'wealthy' and give it to those lazy lard arses who are more interested in welfare than work...sort of like Robin Hood (a robbing hood!) writ large.

We grieve along with you...and pray things turn around for you..."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-27T06:21Z,"""We grieve along with you...and pray things turn around for you"" Do not pray for me thunderbitch your bitch ass can only quote Rush because you have a brain but dont know how to use it...When Scott Brown won in Massachusetts Rush, Jho, and all kinds for extreme right ringers gloated...Therefore your weak argument carries no weight...Also based on your previous dumb comments I'm confident that you do not have a job where you have to think...The most intellectual conversation you might have is, ""Do you want fries with that burger sir?""...END 54-2(54KO's) TKO
