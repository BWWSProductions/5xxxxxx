,seqscan,2010-03-25T19:04Z,Hope it's just mislabeled. Anyone who got it already care to comment?
,chronno,2010-03-25T19:43Z,"I'm still downloading it, but the file inside the .rar says MB.S08E01, and Paranatural's most recent episode aired 03/01/10 (acording to TheTvDb.com) so I would guess that this was mislabeled.  It also just got posted to EZTV."
,JO-,2010-03-25T20:03Z,"Just finished downloading, and it's legit."
,seqscan,2010-03-25T20:22Z,"Yep, it's the real deal. Thanks a ton!"
,diyadokeon,2010-03-25T20:38Z,"So, does anyone know if a 720p version might become available in the future?"
,albert745,2010-03-26T00:28Z,"Looking at Wikipedia, this is the second episode of the 2010 season:
