And the personal attacks aren't lost on anyone. We know the facts are on our side. We know you don't have any valid arguments. We know you need to resort to name calling and childish attacks instead of debating the facts. But we're okay with it. We don't take it personally and we'll be here to accept you with open arms when your eyes are opened.

Wishing you an educational and blessed day,

better than torrent you need only provide the bandwidth for one copy once... and it stays online over 550 days

the least sucky client is jBinUp with native SSL support.... and optional full RAR/Par2 automation for batch jobs
