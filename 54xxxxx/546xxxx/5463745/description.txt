Jimi Plays Berkeley
Berkeley Community Theatre
Saturday May 30, 1970

Jimi Plays Berkeley showcases some of Jimiâ€™s finest ever performances filmed over two concerts at the Berkeley Community Theatre on May 30, 1970. The film documented the political unrest and student uprisings in Berkeley juxtaposed against such legendary Hendrix live performances as â€œJohnny B. Goode,â€ â€œHear My Train A Cominâ€™,â€ â€œI Donâ€™t Live Today,â€ â€œMachine Gun,â€ â€œPurple Haze,â€ â€œStar Spangled Banner,â€ and â€œVoodoo Child (Slight Return)â€. 

This special DVD edition also features a new digital picture transfer of the original documentary film and, for the first time, a soundtrack remixed in both stereo and 5.1 audio surround sound by Eddie Kramer, Jimi Hendrixâ€™s original engineer.

Bonus feature: an audio only, never released presentation of Jimiâ€™s complete Berkeley second set performance mixed in 5.1 surround sound. 

This second set includes:
-Pass It On (Straight Ahead)
-Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)
-Lover Man
-Stone Free
-Hey Joe
-I Donâ€™t Live Today

-Foxey Lady
