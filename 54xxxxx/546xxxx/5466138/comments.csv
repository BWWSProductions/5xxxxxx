,mEntOr_,2010-09-16T20:54Z,"here is another socalled blueray film, but why does it say blue-ray when the files are mkv?"
,arkdog,2010-09-19T13:52Z,"Because it's ripped from blueray - the x264-HD is the signifier.

Thanks for this torrent - Im having trouble with the episodes they crash VLC and other media players during playback at specific points - some episodes have several of these 'points'...any ideas?"
,Brunzwick,2010-09-22T13:30Z,"GoodFilms, can you (or anyone for that matter) tell me why this torrent is 33GB for 13 episodes and your release of SoA season 2, also for 13 episodes, is 16.5GB? Is there a major quality difference? "
,arkdog,2010-10-13T12:19Z,Please ignore my above comment - nothing wrong with this AWESOME torrent - i justed needed to rehash the completed torrent as obviously i missed a few chunks
,Ralphski,2011-05-02T21:29Z,"Awesome quality, thank you so much :)
A10/V10
Now, since I'm stuck down under & nothing ever gets here... Any chance on Season 2 & 3 on BR?"
,dougster50,2011-06-13T05:44Z,"Why are the subtitles hardcoded on episodes 7,11,12, & 13? A warning would have been nice. The other episodes are awesome, thanks!"
,FallenKab,2011-07-03T12:44Z,"Larger files than i wanted but it downloads faster than the others, and i can re-encode them. Looks like i will have to get episodes 7,11,12,&13 somewhere else. Don't like hardcoded subs, unless its translating alien speech. Thanks for upload"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-07-24T16:01Z,subs are not hardcoded.
,hottorsk,2011-08-03T16:00Z,"Hi, can someone instruct me how to add subtitles? I use VLC 1.1.9 and choose subtitle track and then the correct file to the correct episode. In the menu of VLC it says track 1 is chosen, but no subtitle is visible. Is it something I have to do before I start the movie?

I found it quite difficult to follow the dialog without subtitles in this serie.. Great quality btw."
,PauloFran,2012-01-30T18:08Z,"Awesome video quality.
Thank you!"
,Malyr,2012-04-07T10:58Z,"A few more highspeed-seeders wouldnt be all bad, lingering around 230kbit... But the UL-speed is pounding away at over 2mbit.. -.- Thanks for the UL GoodFilms!"
