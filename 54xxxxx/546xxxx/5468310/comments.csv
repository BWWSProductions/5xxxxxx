Its a request:- Please provide 2 channel audio as an extra (like secretmyth does). I believe people would not like to waste bandwidth for 2-channel audio.
For those who need 2-channel audio for their xbox can add it with some utility in video file.

Perhaps you can increase video bitrate or 6 channel audio bitrate by eliminating 2 channel audio or providing it as an extra."
