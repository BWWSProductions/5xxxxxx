Someone has to come up with a work-around for Ubisoft's new system. Currently you need to have an Ubisoft account and register the game's key to your account, and have an active internet connection to play because it constantly checks for legitimacy. When someone finds a work around for this, I'm sure people will upload the game."

Like I said in the info, this is how I received the soundtrack through steam, so that's how I gave it to you guys. Any changes you want made to it, such as wav to mp3, or adding in information for the composers etc. is up to you to do if that's what you really want."
