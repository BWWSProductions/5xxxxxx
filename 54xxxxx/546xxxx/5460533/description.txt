The Buddha comes to Sussex (1979)
A report made about Ajahn Chah's visit in England at the end of the 70s when Ajahn Sumedho and the other monks have just moved into Chithurst to set up a forest monastery there.

A small village in west Sussex is faced with the strange prospect of saffron-robed Buddhist monks in its midst. they have just set up their first western sanctuary for training along strict traditional lines.part of their tradition is to rely for their food on the local villagers: but how would Sussex villagers react when a column of monks file past with their alms bowls. this everyman report attempts to explain what they do and why and the reaction of the village to their new neighbours.
