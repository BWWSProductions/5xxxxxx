,kvacka,2010-03-26T00:19Z,Could anyone put torrent for Me and Orson Welles with Zac Efron it doesn't matter if is a cam
,stmmchn,2010-03-26T04:15Z,"Thanks FXG! Perfect quality as always.

As for the movie, I think it's an incredible movie. I didn't really get it the first time I watched it, but after seeing it again, I realized just how amazing it is in terms of visuals, imagination, story, characters, sound, and acting. It might be just me, but I think one must watch this movie several times to understand and appreciate it fully."

I don't know how Lion's Gate convinced Johnny Depp and Jude Law to be in this movie, but I would have rather passed a kidney stone that watch this movie. "

,GoddessBound,2010-04-04T23:03Z,"This movie is AMAZING. Read about it on IMDB before you watch it, have an open mind. It's genius and life changing if you have a brain that can comprehend it!"
,zasta23,2010-04-05T23:48Z,When are people going to stop reviewing the movie on here? It clutters up the boards and is annoying to sift through comments looking for the ones actually talking about the quality of the torrent. If you wanna talk about how boring the movie is and how Terry Gilliam sucks then go on imdb or rottentomatoes!
,rj28,2010-04-05T23:50Z,"Thanks FXG, love your movies"
,Noobiedoo,2010-04-06T00:54Z,"Sucky movie if u ask me, the movie made no sense. : )"

...for a rip this size.

The movie is sort of a memorial to Heath Ledger.

And contrary to popular believe, you dont ""need a brain to comprehend"" it. Seriously people, what the fuck are you even talking about?"
,askatgras,2010-04-09T22:39Z,"FXG thank you so much, good quality, lovely movie. I will seed!!!"

,CarlisleLuver,2010-04-27T00:56Z,i am new to this site and to downloading movies and stuff. can anyone tell me what it means by seeding>? thanks 
,CarlisleLuver,2010-04-28T06:15Z,could someone tell me what seeding is? how am i suppose to be doing it if i have no clue what it is?
,scrubnuggies,2010-04-30T00:49Z,seeding is when your done downloading and you leave the program open. by leaving it open others can leech off of you. hope this helps.
,deep_enjoy,2010-04-30T21:29Z,Very bad and damn boring movie. Thanks to the uploader though

,kody27,2010-07-24T22:27Z,"You know what really clutters up the boards? Irrelevant dumbasses like you who complain about relevant movie reviews. Go fuck yourself. 

This is Heath Ledger's last movie ever and it's one of his best, I love Terry Gilliam's work (Fear and Loathing, 12 Monkeys, Brazil) and this is one of his best films yet.  Oh yeah, and this torrent is great quality. "

Great Movie!"
,djOATS,2011-09-07T10:26Z,"I'm a fan of Gilliam, so I can expect the unexpected here, even though he is imo miss more than hit, but that makes for a revisit to his movies often to have another go to see if it's ME that missed it and not HIM. It's a yin-yang dance of creativity. Thanks for this..it's coming down the pipe hella fast..512kb/s. half an hour to download..wow. peace from pnw canada"
,jhill87,2012-01-24T03:44Z,"why cant i play this in my computer what program do i need to download to make it into a different file.  I also cant add it to my itunes, which i have not had any problems doing that before"
