Over 2 hours of video that provides the viewers an intimate look at a typical week in Branch Warrenâ€™s life. You will see all his workouts by day, and a glimpse of Branchâ€™s life outside of the gym.  The viewers will see first hand the intense training program that Branch goes through in preparing himself for the 2009 Olympia â€“ the event where he recently finished second in the world to Jay Cutler. The workouts takes place in Arlington, Texas at the world famous Metroflex Gym which has been ranked the number one hardcore gym in America, and the home of 8 times Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman. Brian Dobson, the owner of Metroflex Gym, is the trainer for Branch Warren. 

After not competing in the Olympia in 2007 and 2008, Warren returned to shock the bodybuilding world by placing a brilliant second at the 2009 Olympia, one spot ahead of 2008 Olympia winner Dexter Jackson. It was no disrespect to Jay that many of Branchâ€™s fans felt that he could well have been the 2009 Mr. Olympia winner.

This DVD is a â€œmust haveâ€ for all true HARDCORE bodybuilding fans. Branch is awesome, brutal, uncompromising in this no holds barred onslaught on the â€˜09 Mr O title, narrowly claimed by Jay over the 3-time Arnold Classic Most Muscular winner. The workout section was shot in B&W, similar to "Blood & Guts". All else is in color.
