So What

This source very rare to find in loseless! Its the same source
that can be download freely from the metallica vault in mp3.
This one actually has So What which was missing from the vault!

I was very doubtful that this is a loseless source but
after looking at the Freq Analysis it turns out to be 
loseless and 2 people have confirmed this to be a true
loseless source. A very rare source indeed. I'm pretty sure this
is loseless, that or the Freq Analysis is acting fishy

Tracks marked with a * are taken from another source!! 
I think Disposable Heroes is SBD but im not sure so I added
a * to it, maybe someone can confirm this.

Another Audience source of this show. You may think that
this is the 1st source, well its not! It sounds a lot like
Pile Of Shit but I took a very very close listen and observed it, 
this is a brand new source. I checked atleast 6 times and confirmed thrice.
There are crowd noises that you hear on this source which cannot be heard
on the 1st source, therefore proving that it was a different taper
standing at a different location because people's accent and speech
sound different on the other source at the same time. You can yourself
zoom in audacity and compare the two sources, zoom in to the max and find
some spots and hear the audience noise when the band is not playing, you will
observe they are different sources. Most likely both tapers used the same
equipment or someone has a done a kick ass mastering job. Eitehr way enjoy this
brand new source! If you still insist that this is the 1st source, I will show you
evidence. Rock Am Ring 2006 LiveMet and Original Audio both sound very similar,
however they are 2 different sources when you closely observe, same story with this
one, just think of it like RAR 2006.

Outro

MTX created by me (FeX-)

This was my second ever MTX created, Buffalo 94 being my first.
I think this one turned out much better since I had 3 sources
to work with and all 3 sounded great, including a clean SBD!
There are small parts where it kinda echoes but you wont notice
it because its mostly during James' speech before a song for a few
seconds, its not a big deal but its clear throughout the songs. Any
artwork created will be much appreciated. I know for a fact that there
is one more source out there of this show on FLAC, I hope someone releases it,
I know it exists!

-------------------------------

Requests:

- DO NOT SELL
- DO NOT CONVERT TO LOSSY FORMATS
- Please create artwork for source 2, 3 and 4.


Enjoy!
