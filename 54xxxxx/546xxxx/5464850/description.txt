Synopsis

Muskurake Dekh Zara is a story of a young â€˜boy manâ€™ named Vivek. Itâ€™s a story of simple emotions & disappointments of love and life. Vivek (Gashmeer Mahajani) has an â€˜uprightâ€™ attitude, and ability to put people in their place and add lightness into moody and mundane situations not only when he interacts with his lifeâ€™s love Preeti (Twinkle Patel) but also when he encounters and jests with the simple, funny and harmless folks â€“ like the eccentric live in DLT (Duniya Lal Tripati), the â€˜badnaseebâ€™ hotel manager Khaatkar , the curious curio shop owner Elton, the heroineâ€™s eternally inebriated Chaacha who feels that oneâ€™s â€™spiritâ€™ can be derived only from downing spirits. The filmâ€™s lighter moments beautifully intersperse with the heroâ€™s portrayal of a character of depth.

An incident of embarrassment drives Vivek from his hometown to Mumbai where he falls in love with Preeti. His leadership qualities & unusual understanding of situations makes his friends look up to him. It is his wonderful ability to reason that wins him the love of Preeti & finally put the villain Prakash Raj at bay.

In MDZ, itâ€™s not just love & disappointment but the fresh way they are handled that makes the film unique. With presence & not prejudice of the mind, Vivek deals with lifeâ€™s various & varied situations as they happen to him. This Love & Laughter story is propped up by excellent comedy tracks & songs.
