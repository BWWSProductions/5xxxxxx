,amitarora78,2010-03-27T03:43Z,"Its a request:- Please provide 2 channel audio as an extra like secretmyth does. I believe people would not like to waste bandwidth for 2-channel audio.
For those who need 2-channel audio for their xbox can add it with some utility in video file.

Perhaps you can increase video bitrate or 6 channel audio bitrate by eliminating 2 channel audio or providing it as an extra."

,M0e09,2010-03-29T00:58Z,"I'd go along with that as well, audio and video quality are great IMHO but no need for the stereo track :-)
If it doesn't make too much extra work for you, providing the stereo track as an extra file would be kindly appreciated!"
