Derek Thompson is 'The Tooth Fairy,' a hard-charging minor league hockey player 

whose nickname comes from his habit of separating opposing players from their 

bicuspids. When Derek discourages a youngster's hopes, he's sentenced to one week's 

hard labor as a real tooth fairy, complete with the requisite tutu, wings and magic 

wand. At first, Derek "can't handle the tooth" â€“ bumbling and stumbling as he tries 

to furtively wing his way through strangers' homesâ€¦doing what tooth fairies do. But 

as Derek slowly adapts to his new position, he begins to rediscover his own 

forgotten dreams                          Written by 20th Century Fox
