Night of the Living Bread is a 1990  American independent short film comedic  parody  of Night of the Living Dead, directed by Kevin S. O'Brien.

A plot familiar to viewers of zombie movies and those casually acquainted with the genre is, the dead come to life, spread their condition throughout the United States, and prey on the living. However, in this 8 minute film it is not the dead that become re-animated, but bread, with the bread credited as "playing itself".
