is it patched or is there any keygen and stuff?"
,neuroxtal,2010-06-25T13:21Z,"WOW WOW WOW

I just did what it said:

first edited host file just in case;
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
add and save:

#Firewall
127.0.0.1	icewarp.com
127.0.0.1	licenseprocessor.icewarp.com

Installed on a win 7x64 and generated the license with the carck:
(in cmd)
ukaip64.exe winroute.exe -l license.key

patched the fie:
ukaip86.exe winroute.exe

patche AV:
ukaip64.exe avirplugins\avir_mcafee.dll

and then copied the licence.key file into license folder

VOILA!
FANTASTIC!"

the instructions are a little vague, the cracking program asks for input and the instuctions say youll get the info to enter when you need it but you dont and it never even mentions it again.

apart from that everything works great, and its awesome software."
