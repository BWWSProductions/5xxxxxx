If the weak link here is the iPhone, it can handle H.264 at 640X480 at 1.5Mbps. So perhaps you can try a higher bitrate to see if the motion artifacts and blurriness is noticeably improved in the fast action sequences? Thanks for taking the time to cap and post these races!"
,tdmk1,2010-03-27T18:14Z,"@vassav1 - Actually, the weakest link is probably my (Original) XBox - but with these bitrates the file size it kept low enough for me to be able to seed it out in a reasonable amount of time too..."
,vassav1,2010-03-27T23:12Z,"Sounds good. I only use 1080p screens to watch it myself, but now that I've watched the whole video from you it looks like motion-related issues are a 'non-issue' here. Looks good on my kit. I wonder when we will get full HD from F1 (including on-board cams)? Thanks again for all of your effort. "
,tdmk1,2010-03-28T11:06Z,"@vassav1 - Glad the output for you looks OK too, I have checked it on as many systems as I could but the common denominator was always me - nice to hear that other people fnid it watchable... :)

I have all the equipment to cap in HD, but Mr. Ecclestone's FOM don't supply an HD feed to anyone, so the BBC don't see a point in doing the pre/post race stuff in HD either..."

Thanks in advance!

Btw, TDMK1, great seeds, the quality is indeed very good."
