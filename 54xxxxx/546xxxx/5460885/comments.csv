i've always wondered and never asked.  thanks for any response in advance."
,deejay2k7,2010-04-12T23:56Z,You can add trackers to the torrent but only prob is if it is on there site like say sumo and if they dont have it it wont work but if you find it on there site you can add it in to this one i only use this tracker
