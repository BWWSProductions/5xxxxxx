"OF COURSE I'M NOT"

Veronica (Taylor Schilling) begins the difficult process of 
confronting her PTSD with her therapist (Mary Stuart 
Masterson). Although Sands (James Tupper) is eager to move 
forward with their relationship, Veronica finds herself 
siding with Briggs (James Van Der Beek) against him in a 
dispute over a patients treatment. Chloe (Michelle 
Trachtenberg) and Harris (James LeGros) team up to help a 
cute college football player with a potential brain injury 
and Angel (Guillermo Diaz) butts heads with an eccentric 
ER patient. Meanwhile, Sonia (Jaime Lee Kirchner) cares for 
two hipsters after their hair-brained attempt to win a 
girls heart lands them in the hospital, but their romantic 
gesture inspires her to make her own.

Enjoy :)
