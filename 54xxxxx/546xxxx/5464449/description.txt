This is an MSDN image of Home AND Pro All in One

It's Service Pack 2 BUT it's a great start and

don't have to worry about having to disc as this

fits on on Blank CD.

No i didn't add my key as that would be stupid

on my part. But if you request for a crack i have

one that is VERY easy to use and works either in

Safe Mode or Normal mode (Safe Mode helps bypass

the already 30-Day grace period, where you cannot

log in due to being forced to activate)
