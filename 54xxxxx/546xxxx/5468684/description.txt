What Love Is This? Calvinism's Misrepresentation of God

Multitudes of sincere, Bible-believing Christians seem to have accepted Calvinism by default, thinking that their only choice is between a doctrine of eternal security and a doctrine of falling away. How aware are they of what John Calvin and his early followers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries actually believed and practiced? Bestselling author and scholar Dave Hunt warns readers about the distorted beliefs of Calvinism, giving them a clearer view of the God whose sovereignty does not diminish His mercy and love.
