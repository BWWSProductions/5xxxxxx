Jason Priestley hit paydirt with the teen soap Beverly Hills, 
90210 a series he not only starred in but also served as 
director for a number of episodes.

Directing clearly appeals to Mr. Priestley as he's also 
directed a documentary on the rock group Barenaked Ladies 
and Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye, a contemporary film noir for Fox. 
Recent TV roles include regular stints on "Tru Calling" and 
"Love Monkey" as well as a number of roles in mini-series.

Off screen, he continues to pursue the addiction to fast 
cars that nearly ended his life in 2002 when he hit a wall 
at nearly 180 mph during a practice run at the Kentucky 
Speedway.
