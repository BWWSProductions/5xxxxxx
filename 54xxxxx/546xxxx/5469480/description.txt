Notes
Ruby release was nuked for bad.ivtc_residual.combing_blending_incorrect.frames.decimated

Notes for nukers:

A.Christmas.Carol.PROPER.R5.XviD-xR5 UNNUKED, reason field.shifted.25fps.source.restored.to.original.FILM.framerate

a little point. Next time before unnuke site down and think what to do
R5 format can BE ONLY (and we repeat ONLY) "PAL" with 25.000Fps
If xR5 was forced to restore from 25.000 to 23.976 NTFS it means that his "source" was NOT PAL
but NTSC ripped doing IVTC or was wrongly converted to PAL from someone else at least.....so
NOT AN R5 in any case
xR5 is bad tag, is MISLABELED, we dont know what is it (should be asian street silver)
xR5 proper is INVALID, it's another kind of SOURCE/TAG like for example PDVD or TC but NOT R5
