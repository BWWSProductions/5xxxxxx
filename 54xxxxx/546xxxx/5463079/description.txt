French filmmaker EugÃ¨ne Green offers a playful but insightful variation on the mythos of a fairy tale in this comedy drama, in which a tale of brave knights and evil ogres is played in modern dress, with the actors speaking in contemporary slang. The Lion Knight (Alexis Loret) is a young nobleman who searches the countryside with his faithful lion companion (who happens to resemble a pet dog). The Lion Knight encounters youthful Nicolas (Adrien Michaux) while the lad takes a walk in the woods, and together they set off to find the Ogre (Arnold Pasquier), who holds young women against their will and lives by eating the flesh of young children. While the Lion Knight is hot on the Ogre's trail, Nicolas is visited by an apparition of the Maiden of the Chapel (LaurÃ¨ne Cheilan), who has been captured by the beast. The Maiden gives Nicolas an enchanted sword and orders him to use it to kill the Ogre; meanwhile, the Lion Knight has found the Ogre's lair, but soon falls in love with PÃ©nÃ©lope, the monster's unexpectedly pretty and compassionate wife. Along the way, the characters also find the time to discuss the French legal system and the writings of philosopher Jacques Lacan.
