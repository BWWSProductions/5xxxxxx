,nashimo,2010-09-15T13:01Z,"Amazing torrent great speed, you are the man Leon. I have one request though, do you have any game saves you could upload?? Cause I have played like 25 hours in FFXII (standard) and I just dont want to start all over again : (... it would be very nice : ) I have PCSX2 and my level is 16 in the game (I have just kidnapped princess Ashe)."
,nashimo,2010-09-16T13:27Z,"If you ever upload any saved games in PCSX2 format, please give a link in this page : )   If you cannot, then don't worry and thanks for everything!"

I don't have saves, because i played on PS2. But 25 hours not much for game like FF12. Good luck"
,nashimo,2010-09-17T06:41Z,"No problem, you are right, that is not much for a FF game :) Cheers."

,SirAnthrax,2011-04-02T00:49Z,"I found this ""english project"" whilst replaying FFXII. I am SO PUMPED!. I noticed this is v0.19. I also found 0.20 on another site from the guy who does the patchwork. How do I add the patch to it? Just replace the files? How to do that in an ISO? I wanna burn it and play on my modded PS2!"
,bernachio,2011-05-15T23:05Z,Can you upload one torrent with the patch 0.20?
,retro90,2011-05-23T11:47Z,"ive burned 5 coasters trying to get this to work.

black screen after the ps2 logo on a hard modded ps2 slim v7

i tried the same disc on pscsx2 and it had the same problem but running the iso directly it works fine.

i noticed something though,onthe pcsx2 logs it reads the disc as a dual layer.....do we  need to patch this with toxic's dual layer patch or that esr patch?"
,chupameucu,2011-06-06T14:47Z,"hi Im trying to run this iso on pscsx2 (version 0.9.8 r4600) but when i do, it says that the file cant be found, then i burn into a cd (2.4x) and i got the same problem!
