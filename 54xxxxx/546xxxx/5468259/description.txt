This is my DVD copy of the recorded interviews Douglas Pierce did, with Larry Hell, in the winter and later in spring of 2005 in New York.Deep within the bowels of a skyscraper with the winter raging outside,Douglas goes into his childhood experiences,his family life, his interest in wartime Germany(NAZI! OH! OH!)his days with fellow Death In June member, Tony Wakeford,in the Marxist punk band Crisis, and the band's tour of the U.S. in 1977 and he relates some funny experiences during that tour,and, the subsequent formation of Death In June,and, he explains why the shift, from Marxist leanings, with Crisis, to the band we all know, and love, today and his future plans in the making for Death In June. Not a typical interview,with the back and forth conversation. You don't hear the interviewer much at all really,so it feels more like an intimate, one to one,  with Douglas.I believe, this one is out of print, so, I thought I'd share it for those fans who missed out.It's straight from the DVD untouched.
