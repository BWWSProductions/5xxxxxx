,NitLions,2010-04-02T23:44Z,"I get I don't think the quality of the subs is the problem and mangoshake u repeating sonofa bitch I said on a mac. Why does saying u don't have problems on lame ass windows help when everyone already knows that?? Kill yourself. Anyways, anyone know how to get quicktime to be able to use the subs?? I use an xvid plugin to play the videos on there. ANy help would be great, this movie looks dope"
,NitLions,2010-04-02T23:50Z,"I stand corrected, it was the subs with the download that were the problem. Shynobi you are the man!! Thank you sir!! Mangoshake you should still ever talk again on TPB cuz repeating what other people said so u can get a hard on by trying to prove that you have a super cool computer is the lamest thing ever in the history of the universe. U r an outrageously large nerd AND you use windows which means you are old and boring"
,Shynobi,2010-04-06T00:19Z,"NitLions-you are most welcome bud. I was having the exact same problem.

kloudykat- I did extract the file and it still wouldn't work for me using VLC. Tried it over and over again to no prevail. I imagine Lions was having a similar issue. 

Haydn70- It is true that typically Apple computers are easier to use, but in no way does that mean that Apple owners ""don't know how to use computers"". Perhaps it means that Apple just created a superior and more user-friendly machine? YOU DON'T NEED TO HATE JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD ONE.

Thank you DaSoChaShan, great quality and what an incredible movie! You Rock Dude!
