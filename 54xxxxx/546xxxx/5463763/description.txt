Sung Hyun-ah (Time, Woman is the Future of Man, The Scarlet Letter, Cello) continues to explore her sexuality on-screen in Kim Tae Eun's The Intimate, the tale of one woman's awakening from a life of no-risk routine. Sung plays a woman who has never taken a risk in her life. She has been dating the same man for seven years and is planning to get married next month. Then one day she meets a handsome stranger, played by Cho Dong Hyuk, who persuades her to spend one day with him. Maybe it was a mistake to accept his proposal, but over the next twenty-four hours she will experience a level of excitement and intimacy, as well as confusion, that she has never experienced before, and could change her life forever.
