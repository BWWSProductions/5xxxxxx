I will let user know after download what i me thinks... :) "
,strat123,2011-10-31T01:00Z,"Still no comments? Have downloaded, all gud. The uploader needs to put down what he/she compressed the files with, as the owners said on their web site the hemi-sync frequencies were altered with the compression ratio.
Anyway, I'm through the first month..."

http://support.brainev.com/frequently-asked-questions/brain-evolution-system-torrent---free-download 

I'm just afraid that this will have negative consequences. Did you download these files from the website or did you rip them from a cd? "
,pdiddy741,2012-02-10T15:56Z,"what that site says is just to stop people from using free downloads and instead buy his stuff.....even if ripping will downscale the benefits, as long as its music it can, in no way, HARM you...."
