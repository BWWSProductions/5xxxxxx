,wilrijden,2010-03-28T10:06Z,Can sombody upload Bumptop v2.1 Pro without any virus included ???
,Thomasmoffat,2010-03-28T14:33Z,thanks for this works OK
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-03-28T21:10Z,anything pre-activated. mmmmm. majority is alway laced with stealth keylogger . please make sure you scan before you install. i don't know about this particular software. just speaking generally
[T],ADHDerby,2010-03-29T02:44Z,"You're welcome! :)

@ mazigh & BLACKTROY: It's a false positive, lots of programs and games use dinput type keyloggers (hotkey and command detection).
You can add it to the exclusion list,.. if you don't trust it, download and install the trial version and you'll get the same warning. ;)"
,kanp,2010-03-29T17:34Z,"Dear ADHerby...

This a lot.....

Excellent upload...

***** Rating from my side.

My suggestion for TPB users...

Please don't download this torrent ""http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5457387/CyberLink_PowerDVD_Ultra_3D_10.0.1516.51_%5B_Activaton%5D"" 
which also uploaded by trusted uploader but have "" Hoax.Win32.BadJoke.Formatter.do"" virus in ""pdvd.exe"" included in crack. "
,sgriff59,2010-03-30T01:26Z,"This is not the 3D version, only the Ultra. 3d version will say 3d... This dispays a pic to buy the 3d version upgrade..."
[T],ADHDerby,2010-03-30T03:21Z,"@ sgriff59: This is the Ultra 3D version (it says Ultra Version), there is no regular Ultra version.
There are 3 license versions available: Standard, Deluxe and Ultra 3D.
Versions Comparison: http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdvd/compare-retail_en_US.html

@ UnitedPirates: I can't post a hacking tutorial here, but here's a link to a topic from which I learned alot:
http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/121728-powerdvd-8-9-silent-install/"
[T],ADHDerby,2010-03-30T08:31Z,"You're welcome! :)
Here's another tip: Extract Setup.exe with 7-zip or Winrar and check Custom.ini

@ sgriff59: About the pic: It says ""Upgrades all Your Media Experience to HD & 3D"".
Make sure to check the 3D and the Upgrade button (blue with white arrow)."

[T],ADHDerby,2010-04-10T14:29Z,"You're welcome! :)
