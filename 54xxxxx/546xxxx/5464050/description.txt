Delphic - BBC Live Lounge 2010 (2 songs)

Delphic 15 Mar 2010

Delphic came into the Live Lounge and wowed Fearne with their array of buttons and gadgets, not to mention a Cheryl Cole cover and their single Halcyon.

We also foungd out that Rich always wears his marigolds when washing up, they currently all still share a flat together and they all wore light blue shirts! (this, they were embarrassed of)
