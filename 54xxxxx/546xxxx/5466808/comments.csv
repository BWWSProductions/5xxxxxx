,pspanda,2010-03-27T06:36Z,"according to what i've read, WWE aired the taped smackdown in US and not in any other country. Instead, they made a compilation to promote & hype Sunday's wrestlemania. I'm still wondering if I will download it... what are the matches inside this video?"
,RKOxPunk,2010-03-27T07:29Z,"Ive watched this its a XWT Rip BEWARE there is ABSOLUTELY NO SMACKDOWN FOOTAGE ITS ALL BORING PROMOS, THERE IS NO 10 MAN OR ANYTHING."
