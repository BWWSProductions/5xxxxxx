Amazon.com Review By  D. Mok - Cathy Dennis' debut, Move to This, is one of those head-scratching anomalies in pop-music history. Ever since the market became albums-driven, four Top 10 singles from one album would usually get the album at least a platinum record. Instead, the singles from Move to This were all over the airwaves in 1990 and 1991, but the record itself barely dented the charts. The album climbed as high as the 50s on Billboard's Albums chart, I think, and a search of the RIAA's database yields no records of gold or platinum awards. To this day, people remember songs like "Touch Me (All Night Long)", "Just Another Dream" and "Too Many Walls", but the album languishes in the out-of-print wasteland. Perhaps it was Dennis' slightly kitschy Louise Brooks haircut, or the cheesy colour scheme of the album cover. 

It's a shame, because Move to This was just an excellent dance/pop record. D-Mob's "C'mon and Get My Love" (rightly included here), with lead vocals by Dennis, already heralded a dance vocalist of remarkable confidence, and "Just Another Dream" was one of those singles that grabbed your ear with a few notes. And "Too Many Walls" remains a radio staple today, with its spritely beat, memorable melodies, and Dennis' knowingly innocent lead vocal making for a perfect pop ballad. The moody Europop of "Tell Me" and the pulsating club beat of the title track are also highlights. On a musical front, the only drawback is that the uptempo dance songs sound a little similar arrangement-wise, with the heavy club beats and '80s-pop keyboards permeating all the tracks. However, they are certainly no more repetitive than any other club-style dance record, and Dennis' singing is just superlative. So now, almost 15 years after this record was released, I remain baffled as to why it's more a cult hit than the evergreen hits trove it really is.
