JW Playerâ„¢ Overview

The JW Playerâ„¢ is the Internet's most popular and flexible media player. It supports playback of any format the Adobe Flash Player can handle (FLV, H.264, MP4, MP3, AAC, JPG, PNG and GIF). It also supports various streaming and playlist formats (including RMTP, HTTP, live streaming and more), a wide range of flashvar settings and an extensive JavaScript API.

The XML-based skinning functionality allows you to completely customize its look and its plugin architecture allows you to easily extend the player with features such as sharing, recommendations, searching, analytics and ad serving.

This torrent contains all commercially available versions of the JW players with licences (No logo/watermark). There is no way for JW to detect the license from the player so you can go ahead and use these on your site
