The Final Sign of Evil is an album by German thrash metal band Sodom, the first to include the original Sodom line-up since 1985. The album features re-recorded versions of the tracks from In the Sign of Evil as well as seven songs that were originally written for In the Sign of Evil but never recorded for the album due to the label's inability to pay for studio time, so In the Sign of Evil was released as an EP rather than a full-length LP.
