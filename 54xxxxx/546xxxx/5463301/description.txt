This is a powerful, haunting, and totally unique movie by the great vincent ward.

Griffin is nine years old. Heâ€™s haunted by fragments of a dream.
He envisages a journey.  A celestial city, a great cathedral, and a figure roped to a steeple, about to fallâ€¦.
It is Cumbria 1348, the year of the Black Death. A medieval mining village lives in fear of the advancing plague. Griffinâ€™s older brother Connor returns from the outside world in a state of despair, until Griffin tells of his dream and reveals their only source of survival:
Make tribute to God. Place a spire on a distant cathedral. Do so before dawn or the village will be lost.
Griffin embarks on an extraordinary journey with Connor, Searle the pragmatist, Searleâ€™s naive brother Ulf, Martin the philosopher and Arno the one-handed ferryman. In his vision together they tunnel through the paper thin earth to a new world, a fabled land of hellish extremes, unfamiliar as the distant future of the antipodes, 1988.
But Griffin has a chilling new premonitionâ€¦ for one of them, the journey will end.

Good, but not outstanding, quality.
