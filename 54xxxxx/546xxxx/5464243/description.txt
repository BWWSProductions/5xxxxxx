a must see for all the children of capitalism.

"I watched the documentary of the book with Alain De Botton this week and itâ€™s ironic to be blogging about it, because blogging is probably very tied to the status anxiety he talks about. We want success; we want people to think weâ€™re good (or witty or insightful or intelligent or brilliant); we want to be noticed; we want to be remembered; we want attention.

So some of us keep blogs.

If I get over status anxiety it will probably mean not ever, ever, checking my blog stats. And thatâ€™s just for a start.

Iâ€™m going to read the book, because Iâ€™m really impressed. He gets to the malaise of society and of me with insightful and clear analysis, while also being interesting."
