Back somewhere in the 90s,
two groups of hiphopers formed in the swedish town of VÃ¤sterÃ¥s.
If you know anything about hiphop -
you know its sometimes competition and sometimes working together.

This album, I was told by one of the artists, is only left in my copy.
So I decided to rip this shit and make my very first torrent out of it! :)
The album contains songs in swedish and english,
and is from the former group Boobytrap.
In one of the songs, the wellknown rapper Promoe is featuring
(hence, my writing about working together).
The producer and rapper works as an house-dj today.

I used to run around these guys when I was a little girl,
some of them I still meet around VÃ¤sterÃ¥s corners.

Stated on the backside of the cd (it was my only burnt cd back then,
I only had tapes before) is this:
Produced by: Equal
Co produced by: Mphone 
in the studio Unknown Landz... 
Scratch by Alfons Ã…berg

Enjoy this first (and only?) production of the studio, old school shit! ;)
