XePatcher v1.1 by TheFallen93 & c0z

This app will compile a .s patch file and apply it to an xex. It will also 
encrypt or compress the modified xex. This app should help a shit load with
hacking xex files. The format for patches is the same as FreeBoot/XBR. Just
use the addresses you find in IDA as the patch address. I would recommend
loading the xex as a binary file and using an idc, I seem to have better
luck that way then loading than as an xex.

NOTE: Everyone who uses this will have to put XexTool.exe in the same folder as
XePatcher.exe. Don't blame me blame the poon (dstruktiv).

Ussage:
   -p <Patches.s File> 
   -x <Xex Image>

Post Patch Commands:
   -c <Compress Xex Image>
   -e <Encrypt Xex Image>
