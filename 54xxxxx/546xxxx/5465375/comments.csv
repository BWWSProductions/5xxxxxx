,gHighway,2010-03-27T11:48Z,"@ anakunda, if you read through some of sgrigua's other torrents, seeding can be curtained at times, be patient. All sgrigua's other torrents I have downloaded have been fine."
,Strabonator,2011-04-17T10:48Z,"I just downloaded this torrent, it appears to be the wrong file. Sounds like its the ZOOTV live from Sidney Australia rather than the files listed in the discription above. Anyone else noticed this?"
