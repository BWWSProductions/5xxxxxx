This is the last u2.com subscriber's "gift", a compilation of remixes of some of the last decade hits, that you wont find in shops.
It's a unique flac file, with cuesheet and log of EAC extraction
Enjoy! :-)





PS: about comments down here..

"no seed for days"??!? I've published this YESTERDAY!
Be patient, as gHighway said (thank you!) I sometimes have problems with internet connection, PLUS I'm in Italy where PirateBay is banned, and it's not simple to access through proxy servers (in fact I can't eighter write comments trough http proxy servers...)
Anyway, I can see now this torrent is well seeded...
