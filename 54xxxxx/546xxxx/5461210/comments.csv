,true_Menace,2010-03-31T21:21Z,"I just tested it on the N97, works perfectly!!!"
,6r33n,2010-04-02T12:18Z,Thank you so very mucho!
,6r33n,2010-04-05T16:16Z,"I've had some unfortunate problems with this one: 
1) Couldn't extract all the files with winrar because ""some file names were to long"" according to Win7 - fixed by using 7-zip instead. 
2) Couldn't run any of the extracted .exe's due to some Win7 Internet security crap - fixed by moving the whole extracted folder to another disk and running them from there. 
3) I couldn't finish step 6 because after installing the voices Garmin wouldn't launch on the phone (Nokia N95-1 with firmware 31.0.017) because of some security crap - fixed by removing Garmin, re-doing steps 1-5 and skipping step 6 and 7 (I would never use the voices anyway). 
4) After finishing the rest of the steps I end up getting the same f-ing security error message as during step 6..."
,true_Menace,2010-04-05T20:32Z,"Hey 6r33n

First off, be sure that you started with: ""GarminMobileXT_S60_3rd_Edition_v5.00.00.exe"" and NOT: ""GarminMobileXT_S60_3rd_Edition_v5.00.50.exe""

Second, if your phone gives you crap about some security, mayby you phone needs to be hacked. I don't really know if that is necessary cos I never tested it on a unhacked phone.

If you need a hack, go here: http://www.symbian-freak.com/
"
,6r33n,2010-04-05T22:59Z,@true_Menace: Thanks for the quick response! I've done som more 'research' and it seems that you'll have to hack the phone for the latest releases of Garmin Mobile XT to work. Could be a good thing to add to the description :) Otherwise great torrent!
,6r33n,2010-04-06T22:22Z,"After trying just about everything I can think of (including hacking the phone, formatting the memory card, reinstalling almost 10 times and restarting the phone countless times) I have simply given up on installing voices and updating to now 5.00.50.
Version 5.00.00 works fine with the maps, thank you once again.
Note: There are many places on the net from where you can download POI's (points of interest), suck as speed cameras. Simply download Garmin POI Loader for free and google ""garmin poi"" to find POI's for your area."
,true_Menace,2010-04-07T20:54Z,"Nice!!! thanks for the info...

Sorry to here that you have had issues..."
,securiboy,2010-04-13T17:28Z,THX i needed it for my N97
,w3s_26,2010-04-16T01:38Z,does this work with n85?
,true_Menace,2010-04-16T15:16Z,"I don't know. But if the N85 is a 3rd edition Symbian phone, then it should work..."
,kccode1,2010-04-20T03:59Z,"Great program.  Put it on my HD2.  Works like a charm.  If you live in US skip steps 10-12 and just send a different map set from mapsource.  

Thanks for great program.   

This should work on any windows mobile smart phone. "
,kccode1,2010-04-20T04:20Z,"Even better I just downloaded the update 5.00.20 from Garmin's website.  It works great.  don't even bother with the 5.00.50 update.  That doesn't even show on garmins site.  Must be junk.   

The 5.00.20 update is completely new interface.  "
,true_Menace,2010-04-20T21:58Z,"kccode1

Mayby you should check the site a little better before you make crazy statements...

v5.00.20 is only for windows mobile.

v5.00.50 is for 3rd edition symbian mobiles.

I'm glad that you could make it work for your phone. But this package is mainly for symbian phones where it works perfectly..."
,10willow,2010-05-15T22:59Z,"Anybody know if this works on Sonyerisson mobiles.
dont think Garmin is exclusive to Nokia. Please comment"
,hotpott,2010-06-03T17:10Z,"works fine with nokia 6120,and my phone wasnt needed to hack,Thank you very much, does anyone know is it working with N79 ???"
,MaYFly,2010-06-03T19:22Z,"I can't get the last step of the instructions to work on my Nokia N95. I can install the 5.00.50 version and I can start Garmin and all the maps are working and so on. But when I plan a route and starts to navigate the purple line doesn't follow the roads, it doesn't calculate the route at all, the purple line just goes straight in the air the shortest way from point A to point B as if it thinks I'm driving a airplain, a straight line and no voices can be heard. In short words the turn by turn navigation doesn't work. When I install the 5.00.00 version everything works again. Any idea why it is like this? Can it be a firmware issue? Because I have not updated the firmware in my Nokia N95 phone for about 1Â˝ year or so.
What am I missing when having the 5.00.00 version instead of the 5.00.50 ?"

After step 2, when I go into the program, I have to accept something, and then select the language..
Well, I can select the language,n but I can't hit ""next""..
The ''button'' just doesn't work for me..
the next/pre'vous language buttons/arrows however do..
What am I doing wrong?
ps: I used the 5.00 and not .50.., so that can't be it..

,FedeHippo,2010-07-23T23:36Z,"2 things:

version 5.00.00 wont work on nokia 5800 express music, because there are no hardware buttons, so you cant press accept on the start up screen.

i installed version 5.00.50 instead which allows me to press accept via the touchscreen


i cant get my ""device id"", when i start the app, i have these options: ""Purchase & Go!"", ""Begin Free Trial"", ""Enter Product key"". If i choose one of the 2 first options it goes online but says: ""server could not process request"". Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
,FedeHippo,2010-07-24T01:00Z,"I solved it!
