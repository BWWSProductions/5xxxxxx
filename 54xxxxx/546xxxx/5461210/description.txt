This is my first torrent ever :D


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Garmin Mobile XT version 5.00.50 3rd edition Symbian complete with 2010 European maps plus world map.

Tested on Nokia N96, N95 and 6210 Navigator, but it should work on any 3rd edition Symbian phone with buildin GPS-receiver.

It might also work on other 3rd edition Symbian phones without buildin GPS-receiver in combination with a Bluetooth GPS-receiver, but this is untested!

This torrent has a COMPLETE step-by-step guide so that even the most hopeless of computer users, should be able to install the software.

I hope that some will find it usefull...

Edit: It seems that your phone needs to be hacked for this software to work properly. So I suggest you head on over to:
