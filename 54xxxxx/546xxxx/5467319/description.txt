Although 'Bless The Weather' set his 70s template and 'Solid Air' was his first masterpiece, 'One World' is arguably John Martyn's most important album. Released in November 1977 at the height of punk, it was his first new material for nearly three years.

This new remastered Deluxe Edition is augmented by a disc of bonus material, including five numbers recorded live in Regent's Park plus a host of alternate versions and demos.
