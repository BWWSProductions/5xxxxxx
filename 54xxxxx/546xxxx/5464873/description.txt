The presence of twins in pop music â€“ bless their shared DNA â€“ has a somewhat chequered history. The intimacy between them can often trigger warmth and playfulness, but there are oceans of difference between Kim and Kelley Dealâ€™s brilliant Breeders or Jez and Andy Williamsâ€™ Doves and the saccharine pop of Bros and The Cheeky Girls. Leigh and Chandra Watson, identical 35-year-olds born and raised in Kentucky, but now living in California, aim to be in the former camp, making alt-folk and country of a rather classy order. But instead of being an engaging, lovely exercise in family values, Talking to You, Talking to Me is an icy cold listen.

Itâ€™s also been four years since the Twins came to prominence as backing singers on Jenny Lewisâ€™ 2006 debut, Rabbit Fur Coat, and as any fans of that album would expect, their voices are strong enough to carry a whole record. Sadly, the songs here are slight and flimsy. Most of them sound like blink-and-youâ€™ll-miss-it backing tracks for under-performing American drama series, pleasant and wholesome as a high-street sandwich, but instantly forgettable. Given that many of them start promisingly, itâ€™s a shame. Modern Manâ€™s driving drum beat loses its power when itâ€™s faced with a butter-smooth melody about an â€œold-fashioned girlâ€ calling her eponymous lover. The Brave Oneâ€™s quickly-strummed country licks are quickly anaesthetised when the twins start to sing, without a whiff of interest or emotion, about the â€œconfusion all around meâ€. Harpeth River even starts like an off cut from Portisheadâ€™s Dummy, before its refined wah-wah guitars show how much more committed it is to dull elegance than the Bristol bandâ€™s ragged, intense honesty.

Old-fashioned songs without recourse to fancy modern textures work best for The Watson Twins, like the simple finger-clicking balladry of Tell Me Why â€“ a song full of simple lines about hearts sinking and being alone â€“ and Give Me a Chance, in which they sound heartfelt for once, begging a man to not â€œtake me, love me and leave me for deadâ€. When they sound this alive, itâ€™s hard to ignore them, but as this happens so rarely, pulses will flatline long before they flicker into life.
