[T],skJGZV6z,2010-03-28T22:28Z,"I checked out I.O.U.S.A. Great film! The economics presented re: The Fed are not Austrian School...but I can overlook that dead tree and embrace the rest of the lush forest!

If you check out the film, think abt. this: whenever the Fed increases the money supply, that _is_ inflation. That's why Volker's measures broke us out of the 70s stagflation. When the Fed raises rates and contracts the money supply, that's deflation, which is labeled a bugaboo, but is NECESSARY when there's been a credit expansion. 

It just so happens that Volker's rates were close to what a free market interest rate (absent any central bank) would've been. So, that allowed the malinvestments created by the previous 60s-70s-era credit expansion to be finally recognized and capital to start flowing toward activities that were actually productive. Result: price inflation leveled, business activity rebuilt (that is, following the rapid death of the unproductive bits now exposed by the high interest rate).

The downer is that shortly after the inflation problem was broken, the Fed started printing money anew.

Recently, the Fed was the largest buyer of US Gov't debt securities. I've learned over the past year, that usually when the Treasury reports good debt auction results, it's because a privileged cadre of bond broker-dealers have tacit agreements with the Fed to purchase from them, the debt securities they'd bought at auction. In this way, the Fed hides the true size of its presence in the market for US Gov't debt, and the Treasury gets to report numbers that look better, because they seem to show a smaller Fed involvement.

Food for thought."
