The lyrics are so superficial and bland, I really hoped that it was all some sort of sarcasm but the video (Playboy mansion is however still cool) just proved that this was not sarcasm. But beyond the lyrics alone, the music is a total rip off of Joan Jetts, ""I Love Rock and Roll."" Im not one of those complaining dorks who just bitch all day but I was looking for hurley and caught this and just decided I would finally tell someone what I feel about this song. But its not you the torrent is great (I bet). ANd Weezer (typically) KILLS! I hope they go through with the blue album/Pinkerton only tour. It would be amazing! Thank you for anyone listening to my rambles."
