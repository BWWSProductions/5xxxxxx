It would be very helpful if the folk posting seeds here under the TvTeam username would inform TD members what's going on - pretty please?"

[T],The_Day_Walker,2010-03-25T23:09Z,"TD is back up! This the message that is on the site.
Unfortunately due to high number of sign ups, our database HDD damaged and we lost 9 days data.
We have restored TD Database with a 9 days old backup and installed daily Database backup, so this never happen again!
IÂ´m sorry for the inconvenience this might cause you.
Bonus Points/Downloaded/Uploaded amounts can not be restored, it's not possible. Sorry.
P.S: If you have donated and your star is gone, please Send Me full donation transaction information, i will fix it!

Man I lost about 70GBs of upload credit. But atleast it is back! ^_^"
