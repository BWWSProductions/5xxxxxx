slowwww download but decent rip had a problem copying to ps3 from server but i just stream it from my pc and it works great..any word on the EE i know -peas- has all three but the ratio seeder/leachers is worse than this and each movie is 8 GB which will take a month to download all of them..let me know"
,andrew5500,2010-04-11T21:18Z,blu-ray? 4gb seems too small to be a 1080p blue-ray 3 hour movie... I'm downloading it now... slowly... wouldn't a blu-ray movie be like at least like... 10gb? blu-ray discs aren't 25 gb big for no reason... well I'm gonna convert this with badaboom to play on xbox 360 and I'll see if this goes well with an hdtv...

Please dont talk about shit you dont understand. You let everyone know how stupid you are.

All those worthless (to 98% of people) 10/25GB 2 hour long movie rips are fucking retarded. If you REALLY want that last 5% of PnR go buy the fucking movie."

Take it easy dude, some people don't have all that knowledge as you (seem to) have. And some PB users are just kids!!"
