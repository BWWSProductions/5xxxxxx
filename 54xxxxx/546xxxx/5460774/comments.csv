doesn't work. After running setup.bat  I double click on the exe to start the gamer and nothing happens"
,Lucretious,2010-03-28T18:12Z,"Oh, and a virus is detected as well"
,neodubbz,2010-03-28T18:53Z,JUST FUCKIN SEED ASSES
,mfczero,2010-03-28T22:15Z,"for people having crash issues, this is an issue with the game its self, read on the just cause 2 forums, same with people having issues with using xbox 360 controllers, 
another thing to try is since this is a windows live game, try installing windows live and make an offline account, google for directions on how to do so. 
and there is no virus. people saying that are the ones who are new to this stuff and dont know that the cracked game content is picked up as such. if there is a virus then post actual details instead of saying ""virus"". 
over on our site teamtptb there is over 200 people saying that this worked for them. 

no this will not work on winxp even with the modded directx10 fro xp it still will not work.

make sure when installing to let the directx10 updater run and the vcredist run as well. for people on x64 machines you may need to download the newest vcredistx64. "
,Mark_X,2010-03-29T13:11Z,"this game you cant paly on XP..just win.7 and vista

,Sconterboy,2010-03-29T19:38Z,im a member over at TPTB and I must say there DLs are always brilliant...regard to the problems ppl are having with the game its another case of game makers catering towards console gamers and just making PC gamers an after thought as usual nowadays.....SHROO gr8 upload again m8!!
,retro90,2010-03-30T08:55Z,"This torrent is great!Just follow the instructions!

Oh and i dont think this game is optimised much....:(

i get decent fps only when everything is low or off....lol

C2D 2.6ghz
2gb ddr2
GF9600M gs



Thanks shroo!"
,mcfly666,2010-03-30T17:06Z,This torrent works perfectly hi res textures and all.
,Likeadidas95,2010-03-30T20:34Z,"@ retro 90 : 

i agree with u .. to much optimized !"
,AKwakawaka,2010-03-31T03:24Z,when i start start the game I get dx error code 2 and it tells me to run in failsafe mode. im running vista.. any suggestions
,pantallica,2010-04-01T23:22Z,"You need windows 7 to play a game?
That is Bullshit :("
,subzeroscorpion,2010-04-02T18:50Z,i agree with pantallica.......nuthin else is there to supprt xp???
,mfczero,2010-04-04T14:30Z,"for those with directx errors make sure that your system is capable of handling directx 10. this game does not support directx 9. 
and i agree with retro90 this game is very poorly optimized. just another port from a console. pc gamers are getting screwed over by the major companies like EA who think that pc gaming is a thing of the past. "
,pagudpudxiii,2010-04-05T10:58Z,"Wait can I ask something?
Does this sh!t operates on windows xp or just the sh!tty windows 7 only?
please reply asap. . 
tnx"

,Vuystjen,2010-04-08T22:01Z,"Im having the same problem as Akwakawaka, running vista here..."
,The_Breadfan,2010-04-20T22:07Z,"The game stops at the same point every time. In the intro it just freezes, so I have to close it down through task manager... irritating. I use Vista, have a dx10 card, the whole shabang! Just to be clear, the game runs very well in the bench, it just freezes in the intro."
,The_Breadfan,2010-04-25T00:05Z,"Ahh, for some reason it taken until now for AVG to detect a trojan in the Justcause2.exe. Downloader Agent2.VUT detected on open.

So perhaps this isn't to be trusted after all."

,SachBro,2011-07-24T12:45Z,"The game doesn't work, its shocking coz thus far every tptb rip has worked for me flawlessly. Please dont preach about following the instructions coz I aint no noob. I have done this a zillion times. I have good config too, installed all direct x updates and C++ Libraries. Guess I am not the only on having these issues, I am running it on a Win 7 32 bit os. Sad, I cant enjoy those gravity defying stunts. :-("
