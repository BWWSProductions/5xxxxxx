This is the latest from great Persian singer Tara.

You can get the original CD from Century Records.

Sorry for not including photos, CD's booklet scannings etc.



I love to hear comments from you. 


I'm very interested in locating and getting more music and movies from Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Armenia (Hajastan), Georgia, Azarbaijan, Tadjikistan. Both from artists residing on their country or from expatriate ones.


If you want to contact me I'm difficult to find me and I'm also difficult to speak with me and to treat with me anyways. But if there is real interest I'm not impossible.


Dedicated to my mother RIP.
