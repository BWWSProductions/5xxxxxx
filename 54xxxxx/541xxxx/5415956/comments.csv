I'm going to repack this with the corrected audio and upload it on demonoid."
,MRFUNNYHAHA,2011-09-05T15:55Z,The audio in this is completely fucked. Don`t bother downloading it.
,kalle0815,2012-01-29T17:24Z,"the english audio is screwed up in this release
you need mkvmerge to fix it
English audio is screwed but easy to fix!!!

uncheck the italian sound track and subtitle
at ""format specific options"" you select at FPS: 24000/1001 for the video track ONLY
to resynch it to 23.976 fps and voila your audio plays well.
don't do anything to the audio!
you'll find working subtitles for this @ opensubtitles and podnapisi"
