Deep down the abyss of Russian North there lies the horrible citadel of Evil and by hypocrites it used to be called Arkhangelsk. Thats the place the story has begun.

In February 2006 The Holy Union against forces of Evil was finally organized and named "VANDEYA". They used The Ultimate Power of Heavy Metal & Alcohol to destroy thousands of demons in their way. But as you know Evil never sleeps so time for the final stand has come now in 2010.

But now The Holy Union got a new weapon borned to aim the devil hearts - The Sacred Demolition Hammer Demo! It was built in secret fires of White Box Studio and fulfilled with Holy Light of Heavy Metal. So enjoy and join The War Of Truth! 

Paladines:
Nickolay Lopatkin - Holy Guitar Sword
Maxim Kuptzov - Holy Gutar Chinese Sabre
Victor Leontjev - Holy Bass Spear
Alexey Stepanov - Holy Vocals Horn
Dmitriy Rezviy - Holy Drums Hammer

Enter our Holy Union!
