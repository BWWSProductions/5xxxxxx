I am using a Seed Box that will allow super fast torrent downloads for some peers, but it does not hook up to all peers. Only a portion of the swarm gets the fast download
. Those peers that get the fast downloads need to keep seeding or the seed box is not very effective. I have not perfected the settings with this new torrent seeder yet so bare with me please. Some people do not seem to hook up well, while others hook right and go. Please continue to seed long. I have lots more info to upload.
