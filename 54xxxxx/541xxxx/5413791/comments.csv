,office10,2011-01-09T05:16Z,"Ha, thought I'd mention ur games are kick-ass. But kind of confused, with this game. OK, there are two ISO files, I attracted them both, into there own folders. How do you mount them? I mounted them on there own Virtual-drive. The first drive was disk-1 where it blanked my screen, and installed the first disk. (But now as it says, insert second-disk, how is this done? if you can't see your desktop, I even burned the second-disk, won't work computer will not pick it up.

I've mounted lots of your games, now slightly stuck on this one, cause there are two disks. Do they both need to be mounted> ? And or how is this done??

   Thanks for your time.

Always, trust ur games.   "

,tig3rbait,2011-02-15T04:38Z,"use daemon tools . im new to this virtual drive torrent games , mounting disks crap but if i can get it i know you can.i got 1 or 2 ""cant install msgs"" but i just closed them and it works great....thx devastate i love this game"
,tig3rbait,2011-02-15T04:41Z,"use daemon tools an dit wokrs .
if my dumb ass can do it then u can"
,Danisl,2011-03-10T22:32Z,my first FPS ever and still one of the best and goriest. thanks!
,prowler707,2011-03-28T20:37Z,"ok works great. youll need daemon tools or similar *.mds image program to run
while installing whenever it asks u to insert 2nd disc simply push that annoying windows key that brings up the start menu (its right next to the ctrl and alt keys) this allows you to see the deamon tools icon on next to your clock there. right click on that icon and mount the other disk and viola your goin places. hope this helps."
,jesusismyairbag,2011-04-12T15:48Z,"this just doesnt work for me, I tried reinstalling, all my drivers etc are up to date.
when I load the game, the console comes up really quickly then closes immediately and nothing else happens. I can't even read what the console's actually saying. Thanks for the upload anyway... 

btw im using windows xp pro 32-bit
amd phenom II x2 3.6 Ghz
ATI Radeon 5770hd and have 4gb ram."
,dwarf194,2011-04-16T01:26Z,"1 thing guys. remember that Devastate here might have the same problems as a few of you. so it might be hard to answer questions about errors that have not occured for him! no offence Devastate, but it might not be so easy to answer questions about problems you have not met?"
,psprapper,2011-04-16T05:39Z,"it works great, but online, I get banned by some servers(when joining the game, immediatly banned)."
,beerman44,2011-04-23T18:28Z,thanks i love this game 
,aeitz,2011-06-09T08:05Z,"Ok, I must be a complete dolt, but I'm having trouble with the ""insert disc two"" phase too... mounting the second disc with PowerISO does nothing. Burning it does nothing. Is DaemonTools the only thing that works with this?"
,folk053,2011-07-13T09:07Z,thanks.... :D
,wowbuster,2011-08-13T08:42Z,magic disc  wouldnt read the mdf files so i downloaded magic iso compressed the mdf files to uif and mounted those with magic disc. Im going to get my own cd key instead of asking for a hand out since you were nice enough to supply the game. still was able to start the single player works great...
,iEpicFuzion,2011-09-15T20:19Z,"If your stuck at the insert disc 2 phase READ THIS...
I was having the exact same problem, yes you do need daemon tool for this ( FREE ).

Follow these step AFTER you have extracted the disc 1 and 2 into separate new folders (eg. SoF Disc1, SoF Disc2)

1. Double click the file ""Sofii_1"" if you haven't used Daemon Tools before then you will need to select open with and find Daemon Tool.  This will mount Disc 1 using DT to your default/H drive (First available drive) dont mount disc 2.

2. Keep following on-screen setup and then wait untill it pops up asking you to insert disc 2 but dont press OK because its not mounted...

(if you have already tried mounting disc 2 and Daemon Tools is on your start menu skip step 3 and read step 5)

3. Open DT and unmount Disc1 from your Drive (default/mine -:H)

4. Now quit DT and double click ""Sofii_2"" file, this will mount Disc2 to your default/H drive (First available drive) - If you've done this step then cross your fingers and click OK on the pop up asking for disc2

5.Press the start button on your task bar and hover over Daemon Tools, click ""Sofii_2""
