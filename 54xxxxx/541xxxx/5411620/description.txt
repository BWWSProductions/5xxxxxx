Release Notes:
--------
British blues-rockers Back Door Slam boast a tough, streetwise sound that
recalls veteran U.K. blues players such as Eric Clapton, Peter Green, and John
Mayall, though these young guitar slingers represent a new generation. Still,
there are moments on `Roll Away` that will firmly recall the sounds of classic
Creem and Blind Faith - not a bad thing and not an easy thing to pull off. "4
stars. Who would have thought the guy who sang "money for nothing and your
chicks for free" could inspire a kid to grow up and become one of the most
promising bluesmen of his generation -- at the tender age of 20? The listener
doesn`t need to know the back story of this slamming, high-intensity Isle of
Man-based blues-rock trio led by multi-talented singer, songwriter, and
guitarist Davy Knowles to be inspired by the band`s blistering excitement. But
like all tales of great blues makers, origins are important, so here goes: at
age 11, Knowles was in the car with his father and heard Dire Straits` "Sultans
of Swing," which changed his life and put him on a mission to explore Dad`s vast
record collection. This included John Mayall`s Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton,
Peter Green, and Rory Gallagher. Then Knowles started listening to their
influences, soaking up Blind Willie Johnson and Robert Johnson. Back Door Slam`s
in-your-face debut rumbles out of the gate with the rollicking rocker "Come
Home," a perfect intro to Knowles` crisply sizzling licks and gruff, wise, and
pained-beyond-his-years vocals."
