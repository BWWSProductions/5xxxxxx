A man named Dingo who's after only one thing: a box. And he'll stop at nothing to obtain it, no matter how many bad men get in his way. But the real question is, what's in the box? And why is Dingo willing to kill to get it back? And why has a gigantic, feral dog started following him?  

A rough-and-tumble thriller with a hint of the unearthly and a pinch of something nasty, written by Michael Alan Nelson and illustrated by Francesco Biagini.
