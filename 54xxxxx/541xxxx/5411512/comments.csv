,t-w-m,2010-03-06T11:16Z,Audio seems to be out of sync.
,t-w-m,2010-03-06T11:34Z,"Okay this really weird, when i change the extension from m4v to mp4 the sync problem goes away.
Anyone care to explain?"
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-06T13:05Z,your pc or standalone device is screwy.  The file is fine.

Thanks"
