Forget preconceptions of boorish Manc laddishness Ã» MorrisseyÃ†s
championing of this fast-rising band is beginning to make sense. Two
years on from their top five debut St. Jude, Liam Fray and his
Middleton homeboys present an album to seal their role as the
Stereoasisphonics-lookalikes that itÃ†s okay to like. These are strong,
conventional songs full of clever flicks and feints, deliciously
produced by Ed (Suede, Pulp, White Lies) Buller. That FrayÃ†s savvy,
gritty-funny lyrics will be compared to Alex TurnerÃ†s just emphasises
that arch couplets are so rare in pop today that we only have one
reference point outside Moz himself.

Most tracks bounce at a comfortable mid-pace, ensuring maximum
sing-along factor, and perhaps Falcon flags before its end. Yet Buller
ensures that even the most throwaway boast cunning builds and kinks,
and FrayÃ†s narratives compel you to hear the rest of the story. By now
youÃ†ll know radio favourite You Overdid It Doll, its mildly cautionary
tale of Ã´a space cadet dressed in fibre glassÃ¶ driven by a catchy
rhythmic motif thatÃ†s curiously reminiscent of Rod StewartÃ†s critically
unassailable classic DÃ†ya Think IÃ†m Sexy? If that wasnÃ†t enough for
white-trash-disco fans, BlondieÃ†s Heart of Glass is later name-checked
by the boys.

DonÃ†t be misled, though: this remains Ã¦indie-rockÃ†, albeit tanned and
tarted-up like one of the girls on a night out in FrayÃ†s songs. Yes,
Arctic Monkeys would be the closest thing Ã» somewhere between Favourite
Worst Nightmare and Humbug Ã» but there are enough musical flourishes
and pining ballads to earn the band the Elbow comparisons they
blatantly desire. (To show theyÃ†ve got, you know, soul.) ItÃ†s hard to
resent their straining when they do it with this muscular elegance.

Maybe these songs lose their everyman anthem cred when Fray lurches
into second album clichÃ©s of the
poor-me-the-rock-god-missing-my-bird-cos-IÃ†m-on-the-road-beating-off-gr
oupies-with-a-stick variety. And the would-be showstopper Last of the
Ladies, is plain soppy. But at its best Ã» Cross My Heart & Hope to Fly,
Scratch Your Name Upon My Lips, the reflective The Rest of the World
Has Gone Home, the heated Sycophant  Ã» this is distinctive and
impressive. Falcon will set The Courteeners soaring.

Deluxe edition including a bonus cd of 5 extra tracks. Enjoy!
