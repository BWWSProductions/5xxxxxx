,b0ogermaster,2010-03-11T15:10Z,Worked for me on my Clevo M570 Lappy. Very bare bones install disk though. Seems good as a dry run to see if your setup is Hackint0sh compatible. 
,hauptoon,2010-03-11T20:36Z,"Thanks for the quick reply

I'm sure that my PC components are compatible with Hackie. But somehow I do not get it to run ISO.

Danke f端r die schnelle Antwort
Ich bin mir ganz sicher dass meine PC komponenten mit Hackie kompatibel sind. Aber irgendwie kriege ich diese ISO nicht zum laufen.
Diese Fehlermeldung sehe ich zum ersten mal.

but as i explain in the description you need to use *7zip or similar

* 7zip is a archiving program, its free, just google 7zip

@ptmose it does work, as you can see others have had success, if you are having a problem please describe what the problem is and we'll see what we can do to help.

oh and 

@oswald63 have you tried booting wit the -v command, it will give you a text boot which may help if finding your problem

 Thanks"
