,forestfan84,2010-03-25T10:59Z,"this torrent does work people it is missing the .exe file and .dll file, all you have to do is go to game copy world and get them. http://dl.gamecopyworld.com/?d=2010&f=rld-alic!7z 
thats all i had to do, i copied them to the uncompressed files and the game works fine for me. :-) hope this helps"

,WASRAL,2010-05-18T17:41Z,Hey Globe excellent uplod man bringing the sive down from 6GB to only 1.66GB keep up the efforts. One small problem though - Trying to access the options screen in the main menu to get to the video options and make it 1080p and max it out and the add subtitles the whole options screen just freezes up although I can access the options in game it has no handy options. just wondering if you can release a crack fix for options to work? or if you could help me locate (If Any) the config.ini file to manually change the video/subtitle setting with notepad.... THANKS!
