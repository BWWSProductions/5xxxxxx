A tale of two movies, 6 May 2003
Author: jc1305us from United States

""Game of Death"", a frankenstein concoction of bits and peices of Bruce Lee's final performance in a movie originally shot in 1972-73, and a later film shot in 1978 after Lee's death, is really two movies in one.

The first, a crime/revenge caper helmed by Robert Clouse is not as bad as you may have heard. The scenes are intercut badly and Lee's many doubles do look bad, but as a movie on its own merit it isn't that bad.

The film concerns a young movie star, Billy Lo (played by several uncredited doubles) and a crime syndicate headed by evil Dr. Land (Dean Jagger, who is good). His henchmen (Hugh O'Brian, Mel Novak, and Bob Wall) won't let our hero rest until he signs an exclusive contract with them, which will put Billy under their control. Colleen Camp and Gig Young Co-star. Camp is benign as Billy's voluptuous girlfriend, and Young looks like he wants to be anywhere else. The score is excellent, courtesy of John Barry's music, which sets a mood for the picture. The second part of the movie is the final fight scenes in a pagoda, which include Bruce Lee himself in some magnificent fight scenes with several worthy adversaries including Kareem Abdul Jabbar(!) and Danny Inosanto. The last 15-20 minutes are the only [part] to feature the real Bruce Lee, but watch the locker room fight -- it is very good on its own merit. In summary, a cheesy 70's Kung Fu movie that wraps around some spectacular footage of Bruce Lee in his ""final performance"", but which also has some charm of its own."
