Yul Brynner wasnt Just and Actor, ...He Was A Singer Too. This is a great album i got from a Russian forum. I wanted to buy the vinyl from a few people who were selling it online, but its a bit pricey because its rare...but the person who mastered it off vinyl did a great job and i salute him. Ever since i saw a clip on the You Tube site with Yul Brynner singing the second track on this album...i knew i had to have it.
