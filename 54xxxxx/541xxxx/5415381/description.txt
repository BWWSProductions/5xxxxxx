This is a wonderful application for Android that shows the City and State that a phone number was registered in for incoming calls (United States only).

It also allows you to look up the city and state if by typing in the number.

This application is no longer supported though and sadly was pulled from the Android Market due to patent issues (There is a link to the developers blog in the application if you want more information).

I made a backup of the last version of the application and wanted to share it because it is such a great app. Download the apk and install with Astro File Manager which you can download from the Android Market.
