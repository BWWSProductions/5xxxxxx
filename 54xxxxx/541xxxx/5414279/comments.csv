Please help me with this, I just found it here after looking for it in ages, it was my fave movie for almost 15 yrs ago lol and here in sweden I canÂ´t seem to find it :/ please, any suggestions? or did I do something wrong? thank you so much for sharing this movie, I so love it.. want to be able to watch it too, tho ;)) x"

I can't really help you since I don't know what software you used to extract it, but maybe you could seek help on the community for your rar software.

Thanks, TvTeam!"
