DVD5 NTSC ISO of Les Miserable - 10th Anniversary concert - Live from Albert Hall. All extras included. If you never got to see the dream cast (Wilkinson, Salonga) perform this live, than this is as close as you will ever get. If the Human voice is capable of more power or emotion than this, I have never experienced it.

Les MisÃ©rables: The Dream Cast in Concert a.k.a. Les MisÃ©rables in Concert is a concert version of the musical Les MisÃ©rables, produced to celebrate its 10th anniversary. It was filmed in October 1995 at the Royal Albert Hall and released on DVD and VHS in 1998 and re-released on DVD in North America in 2008. It stars Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean, Philip Quast as Inspector Javert, Michael Ball as Marius Pontmercy, Lea Salonga as Ã‰ponine, Judy Kuhn as Cosette, Ruthie Henshall as Fantine, and several others, and was directed by John Caird. The performers were chosen from London, Broadway and Australian productions of the show.

Production

This presentation uses a "modernised" and more orchestrated Alain Boublilâ€“Claude-Michel SchÃ¶nberg score than that of the musical. The format is closer to that of a dramatic cantata rather than being fully staged; the singers stand at their microphones with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and chorus behind them, but they do wear costumes and participate in some movement. During the action scenes, the video switches to action from the stage production. A few scenes from the musical are not included in the concert, including the street brawl broken up by Javert, "The Death ofGavroche" and the confrontation between Marius and ThÃ©nardier at the wedding feast.

The second encore

The programme ends with an encore in which seventeen actors who portray Jean Valjean in seventeen different nations join Wilkinson on stage to each sing a few bars of "Do You Hear the People Sing?" in their native languages. They are then joined by the entire cast and choir to sing the last verse of "One Day More!", receiving applause and a standing ovation. Balloons and confetti fall from the ceiling and sparklers erupt on stage as the show finishes.
