Thank you..."
,erikphnx,2010-03-07T14:34Z,"Oh no --- 70s ? I have only listened to maybe 20 percent of what I downloaded from you now and now I have to worry about another decade ? I will have to quit my job now just to catch up.
All jokes aside thanks :)"
,z-nith,2010-03-07T21:23Z,Hey 80z! I just got through downloading Rare Hits 46...another gem! I have Strange Man Changed Man on vinyl...would have upped it to save you the trouble...feel like I should 'give back' a bit...any requests?
,antipode221,2010-03-13T10:19Z,"Thank you 80z for all your uploads. I discovered some very good albums. I am also wondering if you have The Reels' ""Quasimodo's Dream"" and ""Beautiful"" and, if so, could you please upload them? I would be very grateful."
