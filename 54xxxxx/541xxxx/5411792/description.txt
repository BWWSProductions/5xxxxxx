Strange Man, Changed Man, released in 1979, is filled to the brim with highly enjoyable, balls-to-the-wall power pop.

The album kicks off with the 1-2-3 punch of the title track, Lonely Dancer and Robber, all of which are hook-heavy and incredibly high-energy. Then there's the melodic top 40 single, Girl of My Dreams, with it's clever (and slightly creepy, come to think of it) lyrics about pining after a girl in a magazine. Sarah Smiles, a 60s-infused tune with a really catchy chorus, is another highlight. Turn on the Light provides a proper rave-up ending.
