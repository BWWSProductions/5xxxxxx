  A rap version of "Saturday Night Fever." B-Rabbit, a wannabe rapper from
  the wrong side of Detroit's 8 Mile, has problems: he dumps his girlfriend 
  when she tells him she's pregnant; to save money to make a demo tape, he 
  moves into his alcoholic mom's trailer; his job's a dead end, and he's just
  choked at the local head-to-head rap contest. Things improve when he meets
  Alex - an aspiring model headed for New York - and a fast-talking pal 
  promises to set up the demo. Then new setbacks: Alex isn't faithful, mom
  rejects him, rifts surface with his friends, and he's mugged by rivals. 
  Everything hinges on the next rap showdown at the club. Can B-Rabbit pull
  truth out of his cap?
