,Phish,2010-03-06T21:15Z,"works! confirmed.
Nothing to be done, install and play."
,neocero,2010-03-06T21:36Z,"you sure you can play through the whole campaign completing the missions? if so, can you pls provide screenies or something
thanks"
,Novawire,2010-03-06T22:37Z,"There is no way Phish could have downloaded this that fast. So, his comment is useless. The best speed I ever achieved with this file was 8kb. At that speed, it will take more than a week to get this release. Stop lying."
,monteri,2010-03-07T00:56Z,"can anyone else confirm it???

Phish-
-works! confirmed.
Nothing to be done, install and play.

,fufubar,2010-03-07T01:16Z,"Does not work. Same problem as with skid row release: Play the tutorial and you dont get first mission, skip tutorial and you can not finish first mission."
,NeoOhm,2010-03-07T10:39Z,"To get the game missons work:
Start game DIRECT from crack, not from shortcut.
Then use the DEFAULT name already typed by game

(i also skiped tutorial on my try, i had already done it and i started a new campaign. Dont know if u MUST do this) "
,songkran44,2010-03-07T21:05Z,"When you say ""Start game DIRECT from crack, not from shortcut."" do you mean from sh5.exe or from skidrow.exe?"
,fufubar,2010-03-07T21:51Z,"he means sh5.exe you canÂ´t start from skidrow.exe. but this doesnt change the fact, that you cant finish any mission..."
,Fantasm,2010-03-07T23:21Z,I've played a few missions and I'm in the campaign. so far so good. Only errors I have had are the same ones people are complaining about on the SubSim forums and they're glitches in the the purchased game. 
,rigman101,2010-03-08T07:12Z,I am playing it. not bad
[T],Ametz,2010-03-08T15:46Z,"Your other release of this game was 4 GiB and this is only 2.5GiB, something must be missing ? What is removed ?"
,monteri,2010-03-08T23:48Z,"
Win 7 64bits
I instaled 
-skidrow release
-patch 1.1
-copy/paste crack from(UPDATE-folder)
-send the crack .exe to destop 
-start game 
-dont change Capt. Name
-skip tutorial
works, apears 2 missions. one, he have to sink
50.000tons and the other 100.000tons  
in the first i sink 8 ships more 51.000tons,many refits,them i have travel to kiel base,there apears the opccion -end mission-,speak with with the oficer in base acept a new mission and..i can`t start mission same problems....
--my conclusion--

we Have to wait for a real 100%work release

but if you think well, we can sink plenty of ships because we can refit as we want so theoricly speaking,the game is unlimited."

,plastrader,2010-03-09T17:20Z,"Missions doesn't work, going to try to reload as mentioned.
However this game suck donkey balls compared to SH3, the torpedo targeting system is a joke, the command UI is a joke. Sure, alot of eye-candy but does it matter in the long run? UBI needs to patch the game before it is getting interesting, perhaps its too late to change this game back to a ""sub sim""..."
,plastrader,2010-03-09T17:21Z,"and I forgot to mention, Vista 64-bit, crashing when installing the C++ redist."
,plastrader,2010-03-10T12:07Z,"CourtingPsycho: I guess you did not play the other games, so I'm just curious to know who should ""shut up"". For the rest of you who aren't complete retards as CourtingPsycho should steer clear of this game until it's patched.
And this release doesn't work, using the default profile doesn't let you play missions as stated above, just saying..."
,fufubar,2010-03-10T17:05Z,"Give it up guys! the game is not working properly. If you play the tutorial, you dont get any missions. If you skip the tutorial you can start the fist two missions but you can never finish them. Except by changing the corresponding parameters manually in your savegame cfg (and that sucks)."
,fufubar,2010-03-10T17:30Z,"So you actually FINISHED the mission ""sinking 50000 tons"" or ""sinking 100000 tons""?

Please note that on the navigation map, when you click on one of the iron crosses, you see a progressbar, which does not fill up no matter what you do (I am pretty sure about it). But proof me wrong: post a screenshot.

There are reports that when you play long enough you get the ""carrier hunt"" mission, without finising any other mission, but you wont be able to finish that either."
,monteri,2010-03-11T02:42Z,"when completed the 2 mission, I unlock the 3rd, so I went, the new base (bremen). and end the mission, I gained 17 points, I Upgade torpedo damage and rage. spent all.
Then I saved the game.
the next day, I load the last save, and found that he had lost (the guy from torpedo) all the upgrades, because the progress bar was empty again.
I think this is the problem that I need to resolve, but I can not solve it.
I read that changing something in-cfg-saves in the folder, solves??
it is true???
in others topics, some say it solves.
how do I know which file to change and which parameters to modify.
and it is temporary? (in all missions same thing) or definitive??
the problem is definitely in the-- Saves."
,bwmcmaste,2010-03-18T10:39Z,"I didn't much care for the game itself, but it worked perfectly: Just mount, install, and play. 

I'm glad I downloaded it before I tried buying it: They didn't make a playable demo of SH5 and I thought it would be interesting, but I didn't want to pay the full price. 

Thanks to PirateBay and thenoobish for saving my hard earned dollars from being wasted once again!"
,KilenJTG,2010-04-16T19:53Z,i hope this game doesn't rape my PC
,johnvon28,2010-05-02T14:31Z,"Works fine & much  thanks mate. Someone else we can all trust to bring us a virus Free game.   

Cheers "
,Glasd009,2010-07-12T17:28Z,Can you Play online with This Torrent?
,Glasd009,2010-07-12T21:11Z,and it installs fine 1 st mission fine until just after you sink your first ship then crashes  every time
,Glasd009,2010-07-12T21:12Z,What 1 sec i will try with deamon tools like it said instead of achol 120%
