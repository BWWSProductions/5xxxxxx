* About

Filter is an industrial rock group formed in 1993 by Richard Patrick (former live guitarist for Nine Inch Nails) and Brian Liesegang. Filterâ€™s most distinguishing feature is Richard Patrickâ€™s voice, which can soar to quite a high scream - on just about all songs.

2002 saw the release of The Amalgamut, the most notable single being â€œWhere Do We Go From Hereâ€.
