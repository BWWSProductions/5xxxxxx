  This movie really deserves a high-def transfer.

Container............: Matroska

 Re-ripped with new hardware, better math. Much cleaner picture (S-VHS cable),
compared to the previous rips I'd done. Excellent, clean sound, phenomenal LFEs
(optical cable). Still no factory 3.1 (yes, 3.1) surround sound , yet...
 Final Approach (1991) starring James B.Sikking and Hector Elizondo.
 Ripped from a widescreen laserdisc release. Although this was one of the first
LDs with a digital surround soundtrack, I lack the equipment to feed or cap LDs
in surround, so it's interleaved with a real-time hardware-transcoded 2.0
soundtrack.
 The video bitrate is probably excessive; I prefer to rip my feature films so
they fit in a 2G flash drive. Should recode to NTSC-compliant DVD quite nicely,
if you are so inclined.
  Included a flash trailer I found and converted to x264-AC3 (15 fps).
