PLOT
Jimmy, a young man of 17, is bereft and alone after the brutal murder of his father. Burdened by grief, he goes to live with his Uncle Leonard, an ex SAS officer, who runs a below-ground storage facility in the city. While exploring the maze of corridors Jimmy comes across a deeply disturbed man, Francis, who seems to be hiding evidence of a crime in his storage unit inside a red metal drum barrel. Jimmy breaks into this man's room and discovers clear evidence of a murder. He shows his uncle and the two men, not trusting the police, decide to break into the man's house and confront him. Jimmy soon discovers that once you start down a dark road, it's impossible to turn back.
