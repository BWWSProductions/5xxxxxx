Director Miwa Nishikawa hit the ground running with her wicked 2003 debut, Wild Berries (Hebi Ichigo). Small, tightly wound tales dealing with duplicity, plot twisting revelations and keen eye for lifeâ€™s absurdities put her in a similar league as Argentinaâ€™s Lucrecia Martel (La Cienega). Dear Doctor is a bit more feel-good than her previous oeuvre, yet it fits in well with her ideas and obsessions and moves her observations outside the realm of family politics into the theater of community. Rakugo stalwart, Tsurube Shofukutei, stars, doing a wonderful character turn as the well-loved doctor at a small country town community clinic. The ball is set in motion for the uncovering of his well-kept secret when a young intern (Eita) shows up on his doorstep. Veteran character actress, Kaora Yachigusa, plays the widow Kazuko, who adds to the revelations with a touchingly heartfelt portrayal of an aging obasan. Tokyo Sonataâ€™s leads, Teruyuki Kagawa and Haruka Igawa, show up, along with Kimiko Yo (Departures) to fill out a wonderful ensemble cast.

A young medical intern student named Keisuke Soma (Eita) is assigned to work in a remote countryside village. Keisuke at first takes the attitude that this assignment is below his creditentials. His thoughts soon change.

Keisuke Soma then meets the small townâ€™s resident doctor named Dr. Ino (Tsurube Shofukutei), who is universally beloved by the town. The town doctor works diligently around the clock, while knowing virtually everything about the residentsâ€™ illnesses and their family history. Keisuke follows Dr. Soma around and starts to learn things he never learned in medical school.

A secret then emerges about Dr. Ino and the town must come to grips with this new knowledge of the man they so admired.
