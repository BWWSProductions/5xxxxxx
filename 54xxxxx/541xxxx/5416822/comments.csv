,Isadorabelle,2010-05-10T00:26Z,"Folks, I am seeding, despite what it says. I seed when I am not using the Internet, so usually during part of the day and nights.

Everybody though, PLEASE SEED!"
,hart37,2010-08-07T13:48Z,I believe ya Isadorabelle same thing happened to me a month ago when I upped The Big Bang Theory. Piratebay is being weird like that lately. Cheers for the upload though :D
,bondoMaga,2011-04-10T21:34Z,"Is this the Region 1 or the Region 2 DVD release?

(Region 2 has the original uncut versions of episodes 1, 2, and 3--instead of the cut-down versions broadcast on BBC and released on the Region 1 DVD set).

Thanx... "
