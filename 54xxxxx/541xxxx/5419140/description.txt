Trailer: http://www.you tube.com/watch?v=4jVPiROnJ-0

This is the final part of the AVOTT collection: Vegas
Filmed entirely by fans and co-ordinated by Alex Gamble, this release saw the community fly in from around the world, donate technology, skill, and even airfare (fans raised money to send chaonatic, a valued taper, to the concert) to document the final performance of Nine Inch Nails' stunning 2008 tour. Over 200GB of footage was collected, which was meticulously edited together by a team comprising of people from all over the world. 

This disc is available in a variety of formats including DVD, iPod, andand over the coming weeks people from across the community will create several more formats for their peers. 

Do whatever you want with this release, as long as it is FREE. The Nine Inch Nails community have a long history of free and open filesharing, but touts, scalpers, and profiteers are NEVER tolerated. 

This one is on us. Our time. Our effort. Our Gift to all NIN fans.
