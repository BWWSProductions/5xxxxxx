This torrent contains a collection of demos, B-sides, extras, live recordings, 

soundtrack cuts, and promo tracks performed by the Proclaimers over the last 

20-some years.  For those whose only exposure to Craig and Charlie Reid is "I'm 

Gonna Be (500 Miles)," this collection will surely demonstrate that the boys are 

NOT the one-hit-wonders the uninitiated believe them to be.


The bulk of this collection is contained on four CDs, which until now were 

available only to fan club members: "Another Side of the Story" (2 discs) and "The 

Other Sides of the Story" (2 discs).  Also included is a concert performance 

recorded in March 2008 at the Hotel Cafe in Hollywood, CA, and assorted odd bits 

I've collected over time.


Enjoy!
