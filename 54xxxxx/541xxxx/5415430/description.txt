This interview was digitised from an old dicta-phone, so is quite crackly, but still audible. The interview was conducted by Rob Holden (Toast, Billy Rubin, Dead Wrong, Baby Harpseal, Month of Birthdays) prior to a gig at The Cricketers in Wigan, UK just before Green Day signed to Warner Bros. in 1993
