If there is a trophy for the person who has upped the most Irish Celtic music to TPB, I must be the current champion By way of a commercial let me just quickly say that if you search my torrents, you will find collections that dwarf the competition. This music is my passion, and St. Patâ€™s is my Holy Day â€“ and by THAT, I mean Guinness, authentic music, and no fucking green lager.

Still, a specific torrent is missing, and itâ€™s an album that cannot be made by a single band or any company. Only a pirate with a vast collection and knowledge of the day could knock this out, so here it is: The St. Patrickâ€™s Day Training Album. If you want to be ready to go on the 17th of March, this is your baby.

What This Torrent IS: 

As complete a collection as I could assemble of all the songs (and lyrics!) TYPICALLY played at most American Irish pubs. I have deliberately chosen the most commonly played songs, and the clearest covers of them that I have to better facilitate the learning of choruses and lyrics, so that ANYBODY can walk into your local Shaebeen, announce â€œG-D Bless All Here!â€ and proudly sing along.

What This Torrent is NOT:

Any kind of attempt at cultural authenticity, or beauty. The ONLY requirements to make it in this torrent were (1) is this song one you may expect to hear on St. Patâ€™s? and (2) does it have clear lyrics and / or audience participation instructions from the singer? There are some absolutely gorgeous arrangements of some of these songs that I did not include because a different cover had a version easier to understand and learn. Some of these accents can get pretty thick. For that reason, none of the excellent and popular punk Irish music (Flogging Molly, Shane McGowan, Pogues, etc) made the cut. Those are all well seeded elsewhere, and are bloody hard to understand if you donâ€™t already know the words. This torrent is meant to teach people the words.

Specifics:

â€¢	Lyrics (some with required participation instructions) are included. Please keep in mind that some of the language is either hundreds of years old, or in Gaelic. Iâ€™ve annotated it where I felt it to be necessary. The rule of thumb is that itâ€™s really only important to know the choruses.

â€¢	A lot of these songs are not actually Irish. Many were written in Tin Pan Alley back around the turn of the 19th Century, some are more modern, some are Scottish, Australian, Canadian, or just plain fun crap that has somehow become popular. If it gets frequent play at the pub, itâ€™s probably here. If your favorite didnâ€™t make the cut, it probably is not a commonly popular drinking song. This is top 40, not true folk.

â€¢	There are 3 main categories â€“ Fun and funny, the tear-jerkers (a lot of dead mothers here) and traditional stuff, and the most popular songs of rebellion. Keep in mind a lot of these categories tend to overlap.

â€¢	Please note that lyrics to these tunes change a lot, and so the version you learn here and the ones at your bar may be different â€“ they will either add or delete words and stanzas, or even change the speed of the tune. Drink more and adapt.

â€¢	Even though many famous and quality musicians on dozens of albums and labels contributed the tracks that make up this torrent, Iâ€™ve edited the tags here to reflect the fictional album I wanted to create. Iâ€™ve left the real artist and album names intact (when known), but changed other markers and track numbers as if this was a commercial album. Please note that some of these tracks have been in my collection since Napster, and so the bit rate and overall quality is not always as good as I would like it to be. Many of the albums here that I actually own and burned myself were burned WAAAAYYYY back when hard rives over 30 gig were expensive, so I opted for 96 and 128 a lot. Some of this stuff is just the way I found it on P2P, and I have never been able to find better copies. If anyone reading this happens to own the commercial album of anything here and would to torrent it at higher rates, please do, and link back so *I* can download YOUR stuff. By the way, everything here is mp3. You cannot play FLAC on an mp3 player, and it takes up too much room, therefore, FLAC sucks. Donâ€™t leave me comments asking why it isnâ€™t in FLAC.

â€¢	If your idea of St. Patâ€™s is to head downtown to the local meat shop or dance club, listen to modern music and drink green Budweiser, fuck off. This torrent isnâ€™t for you. Good luck hooking up with some skank, and enjoy the hip-hop.

â€¢	If you are searching for the more authentic, punk, or operatic arrangements â€“ or perhaps actual Gaelic or rarer stuff â€“ thereâ€™s a good chance Iâ€™ve got it, but not in this torrent. May I suggest you try:
