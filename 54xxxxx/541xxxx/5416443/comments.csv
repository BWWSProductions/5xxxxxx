,somstar,2010-03-09T11:04Z,"Muchas Gracias vicerock. I am a fan of your uploads and check them out regularly.
This movie's Audio = 9/10, Video = 9.5/10. Overall, very good quality considering the other crappy uploads and if good then huge size. 
Vicerock packs very good quality in small size and that's what makes all the difference.
Keep up the good work and once again thanx a lot."
