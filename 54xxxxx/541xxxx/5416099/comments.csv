I live in Ghana, West Africa, and so have very slow internet connection. It really makes a big difference in download time when the files are as compressed as yours. 
I was wondering if by any chance you were considering putting up the Academy Awards telecast tomorrow?? I would be even more grateful than I already am if you did!!
Keep up the good work!!"
