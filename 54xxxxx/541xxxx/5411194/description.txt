This is the complete series from Deke McClelland in GUI form (PC and Mac) including all exercise files.
The files compressed into RaRs (for size) are ISO. They are meant to be burned to DVD but can be just as easily mounted or extracted and played from your hard drive.

Awesome course series...Deke McClelland is an excellent teacher. Easy to understand and an expert on all topics. I've seen a number of other course teachers that were either just plain boring or their voices were too damn irritating to listen to but Deke keeps you awake and interested in the topic at hand.

Burn to DVD/Mount/or Extract to your hard drive and happy learning!
