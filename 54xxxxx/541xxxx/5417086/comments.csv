,bteljuice,2010-03-23T19:25Z,Do I have to download Any player to watch this movie? Or I can watch it on VLC
,lawman33473,2010-03-27T22:43Z,"Thanks for UL Ray. You're putting out lots of quality UL's. 
@btlejuice- It's an xvid codec VLC is fine or if you want to burn it for DVD get ConvertxDVD, NERO or any budget suite that converts. You won't regret conversion software for the playback options.
Cheers"
