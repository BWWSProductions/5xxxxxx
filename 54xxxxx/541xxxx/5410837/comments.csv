And, indeed, in case you are not aware of this: you seem to be the only one who posted L4&5 (it seems, quite a while ago). But the torrent for those do not work [no seeders], nor are L4&5 to be found anywhere. So, if you don't mind..."

,telvet,2011-05-04T12:14Z,I have not been able to open those iso files however (unlike other iso's which can be easily mounted). It may require some work to do that. Indicate if you accomplish that please...
,telvet,2011-05-12T18:32Z,"bad news... it seems they turned out to be fake.
