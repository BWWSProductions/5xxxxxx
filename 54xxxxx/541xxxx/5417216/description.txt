This Russian film consists of a ballet presentation of Shakespeare's immortal romantic tragedy. Bypassing the oft-presented Tschiakovsky version, the filmmakers opt for the meatier Prokokiev adaptation. Jdanov and Oulanova appear in the title roles (we don't know their first names; we're going by their official billing). Also appearing are Koren as Mercutio, Lutchline as Lorenzo, Erminislaev as Tybalt and Lapouri as Paris. This Romeo and Juliet was released around the same time as the British adaptation starring Laurence Harvey and Susan Shentall (who don't dance).
