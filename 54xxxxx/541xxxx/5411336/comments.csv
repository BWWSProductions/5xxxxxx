,Wereblood,2010-03-11T16:24Z,"Pretty good quality, especially for the smaller sizes of the videos. Sounds syncs great and sounds good. Good download :D"
,V0dKa99,2010-07-27T13:34Z,"These Files Do NOT, I Repeat, Do NOT Work Streaming To The PS3, they all say Corrupted Data when completed...bloody waste of 4GB of dling. thanks a lot for nothing."
,drkstar,2010-08-19T01:02Z,"@V0dKa99

That corrupted data can mean a lot of things. Your transcode settings on the media server could be off because they work fine on mine. You should have no problem streaming .avi to begin with since it's a natively understood format for the PS3.

How many people do you think even use a PS3 to view when almost every TV now has the capability to act as a computer monitor? Do you think everyone should cater to you? Most people just watch on their PC.

You just come off sounding like a rude moron, I repeat, a rude moron."

,dethchikkin,2011-01-24T17:09Z,"@V0dKa99

just because they dont work streaming to your ps3 doesnt mean its a waste... i mean who really cares if you can watch em on that over priced pile of shit anyways? did you try burning em to dvd? putting em on a hard drive/ flash drive? or try runnin em on a 360? and whats wrong with your pc?"

,vvydra,2011-05-29T16:09Z,"I don't think the quality justifies the sizes, it could be understandable if the files were like 150 mb, and not 450!"
,useitright,2011-07-01T12:54Z,why would you want to take the time to put it on your ps3 when you obviously downloaded it on a computer that would probably play it just fine.  Just another case of you should have thought before you opened that big mouth of yours huh?
,n0_pAnCaKeS,2011-08-08T13:36Z,"Great torrent
