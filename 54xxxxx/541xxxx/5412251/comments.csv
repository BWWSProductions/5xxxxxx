:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-05T16:22Z,"Yeah... thanks guys... BUT:
I should have this torrent deleted immediately after initial-seeding.
Out of 16 peers in initial swarm SEVEN performed classical Hit&Run.
Are this people so selfish, crazy, mad on something, somebody, anybody, anyone?

No matter how many times I said, begged, plead - same shit happens, now that becomes a rule, grab and run, hit somebody with the car and say ""What? He practically asked for it!"" ""Who is the man!"" ""Fuck others!"" ""Who cares!""

Well, you have the world that suits you."
,lilars26,2010-03-05T17:12Z,Very sad indeed.
,lilars26,2010-03-05T18:55Z,"Thanks for your hard work.I know
my daughter-in-law wanted to see
this."

[V],pluto999,2010-03-05T19:31Z,After downloading I'm gonna seed :) you rock bro !!
,valu59er,2010-03-05T20:15Z,"Thank you mister 20-40 :-)
You have made a couple of teenagers that live around me very happy....Will chug along with my seeding of course... didn't load this till 5am here so not interupt initial swarm with my little engine that could...
I do love the fact that at least while it is dling it is also sharing at high rates.... then after you got it....every thing slows...I wish I knew how to keep it that fast..It makes me realise.. even hit and runners get forced to share at a good speed even if for a redicuously short time...any way thanks again."
,stev666,2010-03-05T21:06Z,"Hey my friend thank you for the upload, my gf sends you hugs and kisses. ;-) she is a twilight fanatic, me not so much I hide my head under a pillow once the vampires start glittering and sparkly.

Guys please stay seeding I'm on 10% but I'm going away to visit my parents for the weekend, and I won't be able to leave my PC going all weekend as the weather isn't playing nice, thunder rumbeling and huge bolts of lightning, I'm afraid ill come home to a pile of ash on sunday night.

Remember sharing is caring.


Thanks
Stev"
[V],pluto999,2010-03-06T07:29Z,"Seeding @ unlimited speed :)

Nice copy mate..!! I'll seed as I have said earlier.."
[V],pluto999,2010-03-06T07:29Z,there is more subtitle than just eng & danish though
,nrage88,2010-03-06T11:00Z,HEY EVERYBODY...i THINK ALL OF THESE COMMENTS SEEM A LITTLE TOO FRIENDLY..2040..ITS PATHETIC TO CREATE OTHER ACCOUNTS AND THEN USE THOSE ACCOUNTS TO COMMENT ON YOUR OWN UPLOADS...GROW UP PUSSY..!!
,stev666,2010-03-06T19:15Z,"@ nrage or what ever, GO AWAY, you are not welcome here, 20-40 is a gr8 uploader and we are here to support our friend he has no need to make up accounts to make himself look good, see unlike you 20-40 is not here to impress anyone or make himself out to be some hero, he is here to share with us in my opinion almost like a modern day robin hood and I respect him for that!! Now if you would be so nice to go crawl back into the dumbass u came from and don't bother us again.

AND just to clarify 20-40 ROCKS and is the best uploader ever"
