"We are here to remind you that pain and fear are not the only methods of growth; that you can more elegantly grow through joy and love. . . that you create your own reality . . . that there is a God/Goddess/All That Is who loves you, who knows your name. . . and that you love good enough"   â€”  Lazaris

It begins with the â€œhigh groundâ€ and then a return to our personal â€œbattlefield.â€ We return not to battle again, but to collect energy -- gifts and treasures -- that were lost there.
