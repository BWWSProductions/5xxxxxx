You, Laura Bow, are cordially invited to your friend's family reunion at her wealthy uncle's estate. Upon arrival, you can clearly see that there is no shortage of dirty little secrets among the family members and the staff... but you never expected MURDER! Unable to get anyone to help, you alone must find out as much about the suspects as possible and hopefully be able to discover the killer... before the killer gets you first!
