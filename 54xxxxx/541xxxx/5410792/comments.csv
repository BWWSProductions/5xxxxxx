,Frice,2010-03-05T02:36Z,"yep, nice to see yet another pirate bay'r keepin up with teh darkblizz boards ;)"
,Frice,2010-03-05T02:57Z,"I see alot of leechers but im not uploading at all, what gives?"
,Frice,2010-03-05T02:58Z,"Ah there we go, it just randomly decided to start working."
,MrEekers,2010-03-05T09:27Z,"I discovered that this ""Cheating AI"" is spasmodic and I spurn it. It's exigent that I die and it's cardinal that I do... cant wait to try v6.0. I don't want to be having to become exorbitant. I surmise it'll be gratifying. I hope I don't reproach it. When I obtain a hard AI ill be scintillating and give the up loader laudation and if I don't ill be probably get a debilitating fever."
,machine_dream,2010-03-05T11:26Z,"MrEekers

I'd prefer to kick your ass with a bunch of zealots instead of waiting another ai."
,Frice,2010-03-05T15:12Z,"Try adding this add-on:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5411414/Starcraft_2_Beta_-_AI_v5.5_Cheat.AI_Addon_amp_5p_Map.%5BDarkBlizz%5D

I tried it last night and I lost the first two games I made (first time it has happened, losing I mean)

I highly recommend it."
,MrEekers,2010-03-05T22:38Z,"Frice,

Thank you for the reply, I appreciate it."
,Frice,2010-03-06T00:57Z,"No problemo Mreekers, let me know what you think of the custom v5.5 cheater AI addon."
,MrEekers,2010-03-06T05:48Z,Once i get Starcraft working again ill let you know. :)
,MrEekers,2010-03-06T10:52Z,The ai killed me. Thank you for uploading this i like a challenge.
,Frice,2010-03-06T16:21Z,"The long awaited AI V.6.0 is out!

,Frice,2010-03-06T21:09Z,"Good to hear it mreekers ;D

try v.6, it pwns.

it actually counters things like mass mutalisks with templar aoe's etc.

pretty pro."
,MrEekers,2010-03-07T01:47Z,Yes v6 is much better than 5.5. It killed me the first time but after that I killed it every time. It is still pretty hard I like it a lot yet I am using the standard one right now. I will try the cheating AI once I come up with perfect strategy.
,Frice,2010-03-07T05:14Z,"Glad to hear it mreekers ;D
It's always nice to hear when someone is happy and I was able to make them so.

Cheers bro."
,MrEekers,2010-03-07T06:31Z,"Hey Frice I found the perfect strategy and I killed the cheating AI v6 Terran, Zerg, and Protoss 4 times in a row with Protoss."
,Frice,2010-03-07T17:01Z,"Nice to hear it bro, you try the 5 player map w/ that strat yet? Lemme know if you do."
,MrEekers,2010-03-08T00:34Z,"Yes I did and I died on the 5 player map. My ""perfect strategy"" doesn't work with multiple enemies. Only with one enemy."
,Frice,2010-03-09T04:50Z,": / thats to bad mreekers, you should try more of a turtle as it is FFA and they will kill each other off eventually if you do not become a threat to them that is... 

;D"
,suprapro1,2010-03-11T02:53Z,"This is Lame, i cant wait till sc2 comes out.., i've tried this ai(v5.5) and v6 but how can u people lose?, they cant break ur defense and they just linger in front your base until they get finished off, while killing each other! is there no melee? so i can be attacked from all directions?"
,ElTaTa,2010-03-12T19:10Z,"i must be really bad, i cant beat these (cheating) AI's! where the cheat codes at??"
,Empyron,2010-03-13T12:05Z,"Thank you, Frice. I look forward to competing against this AI! I have won every single match against AI so far - even ""Hard Non-Cheating"" AI.... they had a bad script though. Thanks for your hard work!"
