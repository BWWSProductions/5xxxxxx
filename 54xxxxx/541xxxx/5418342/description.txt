DÃ©anta is an Irish traditional music band from Northern Ireland who played together until 1997 and regrouped in 2008. DÃ©anta is the Irish word for done  or made. The band were noted members of the traditional music scene in Ireland. They signed to Green Linnet and released three albums which blended traditional tunes and songs with arrangements sometimes veering towards a contemporary setting.

The former members played at the 8th Gig 'n The Bann Festival in September 2007. Their first performance after regrouping took place in October 2008 for BBC Two Northern Ireland's Blas Ceoil series.
