[V],C3NTURiO,2010-03-06T11:34Z,"hi meanmachine.

this is for single-player only.
also you need lazylaunch v2 and the latest version of SC2.

this is compatible with SC2 v0.5.0.14219 and v0.6.0.14259.

to check your current SC2 version, go to \StarCraft II Beta\Versions\ folder and see if there are Base14219 Base14259 folders. if yo don't have these folders, run StarCraft II.exe and let it update the game."

[V],C3NTURiO,2010-03-07T11:49Z,"hi,

you can still use this. it works with the latest build. (v0.6.0.14259)"
,jlsoul,2010-03-13T04:19Z,I've tried everything that you said but it still does not work for my starcraft.  I am positive it is up-to-date and everything.  Please help.
