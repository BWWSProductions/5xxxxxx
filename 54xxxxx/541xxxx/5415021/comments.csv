,Captain,2010-09-22T22:38Z,"Hey, what about this Xtreme CS

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4766746/Counter_Strike_1.6_Extreme

and also master server fixed."
,Captain,2010-09-23T18:25Z,"Thanks, but I've got some problem.

1.  This Counter Strike 1.6 is not the final   release, I checked myself.
      :  Graphics Not Improved  :

2.  Whenever I try to use F1 buy, I get
[ Night Hawk ] pistol and the Primary Gun.
      : Important if your money is less :

3.   Master Server Not fixed.

4.   When I try to equip knife-----
first press 3, then knife appears, after that click the left mouse button, Equipped. 
    :  These steps were in old CS  :


I appreciate your hard-work,  and I don't want to degrade you seriously."
