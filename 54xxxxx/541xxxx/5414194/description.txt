this is the hard to find Lexar USB Format utility

for your lexar flash drives to convert them to a

HDD looking device instead of a removable disk (SSD)

you can actually install Windows on the flash drive

without having to modify any files with this tool

I have looked at several other different torrent

sites just for this tool and came up nothing short

but this tool alone.
