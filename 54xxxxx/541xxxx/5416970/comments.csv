Full title:

Berserk: Millennium Falcon Hen Seima Senki no Sh? / Beruseruku Mireniamu Farukon Hen Seima Senki no Sh?

The only copies I've ever managed to find either crash before the title screen or refuse to load saved games. Thanks for all your hard work so far thenoobish, I hope you can work your magic once again for me. :)"
[T],thenoobish,2010-03-07T15:08Z,guyverZX81: Thanks for your comment. this may sound like a dumb question but is the game Berserk only in JAP language? Or am I missing something? :-P
