,Bugthunder,2010-03-14T17:22Z,"Registration process does not recognize activation code. Can you help?
I'm running Vista OS. Everything operates per your instructions up to the final activation step."
,.tpb-dude.,2010-03-15T21:30Z,"Thanks, clean and WORKING !"
,bukopie,2010-03-16T08:02Z,"Thank you very much for uploading this, i am completely new to this kind of thing. your instructions were excellent and I followed them to the letter and now have a working program. Other people please take note, we are not all familiar with doing this, and so more than a single line of help is appreciated. there are no transitions with this program any ideas??? Thanks"
,TheVisor47,2010-03-16T16:54Z,"Followed the instructions to the letter, but the activation code is still being rejected. Can anyone help?"
,TheVisor47,2010-03-16T17:48Z,Okay. I got it working now. I wasn't clicking the patch button in the keygen.exe. I didn't know you had to do that.
,bukopie,2010-03-16T23:01Z,"The program is great and working, but where are the transitions, I have enabled the plug in manager in the program but I get message saying no plug - ins are installed. Please reinstall the program to fix the problem,  has anyone else got this problem. I don't actually know if these transitions etc come as a separate thing from the program itself or not. Advice please on how to fix. thanks."

,EclecticGamer,2010-04-06T17:40Z,"I followed all the instructions but it said authentication code is not correct :(
What should I do?"
,TastyTeo,2010-04-14T21:51Z,"Why is it always working on me? anyway, i got an idea. if the code dont work, then use the old generator 
Torrent -> http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5151827
(Mine)
Generate serials and chane 1FW to 1HF
Select Sony Vegas Pro 8.0 Series

I Hope i solved most of your problems....."
,mrmusc,2010-04-20T10:27Z,"I downed it very fast, 2.2 Mb, and followed Teo's instructions. It works perfect half an hour later.
o.s. windows 7. I tried two others but there i was unable to register. 
So from my point of view, TastyTeo, you rock dude!
Thanks for the effort you put into it so i can have my video fun again!

MrM"
,TastyTeo,2010-04-22T15:45Z,"Guys im not sure if this will work, and sorry for late response, 
1. Download my other Torrent with Vegas Keygen here
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5151827/
2. Open the keygen (It looks the same, but it is the before one year, and it probably works better)
3. Choose Sony Vegas Pro 8.0 Series
it will generate serials starting from 1FW, just change it to 1HF and you are ready, the authentication code remains same "
,suulik2,2010-04-28T06:08Z,"One thing that is very important that I didn't see mentioned in the directions (unless I'm a dork) is that you have to press the ""Patch"" button on the KEYGEN before you generate the numbers or else the serial/activation numbers won't work.

Also, Windows 7 and probably Vista users MUST run both the crack and the keygen as administrators or they won't work.  Ignore me if this is obvious but it hung me up at first.  Thanks TastyTeo!"
,Aft3rMiDn1Ght,2010-04-29T22:51Z,"I finally figured it out... took a little bit.. but here's the exact directions you should follow.

1. Open up setup, and install the 32 bit or 64 bit.

2. Open the Patcher and Keygen folder...

3. Open the Patcher folder...

4. Open the file Patcher (Right click run as Administrator if using Visa/Windows 7)

5. Click the Left Button directing too C://program files/Sony/Vegas Pro 9.0 Click Ok

6. Then click the + sign in the middle, then at the right click the red button ""CRACK ME"" once that is done, hit the X button on the top right.

7. Now open up the folder Keygen and open the file Keygen...(again right click as Administrator if running Vista/Windows 7)

8. Product name.. scroll down too Vegas Pro 9.0 (32 bit and 64 bit) series. Hit the Patch button...again go to C://Program Files/Sony/Vegas Pro 9.0

9. Open up Vegas Pro 9.0 and copy the serial number in the keygen.... click next, register on a different computer, fill out that information with whatever you want doesn't matter... then copy the ACTIVATION/AUTHENTICATION CODE from the keygen..

10. That's it, it's done and registered!

No need too use the old Keygen TastyTeo :) the one you gave first is fine and perfect, GREAT JOB!"

,altar22,2010-07-25T20:00Z,"the keygen patch doesn't work

,Dillsky,2010-08-18T08:04Z,"@Aft3rMiDn1Ght Oh my God, thank you so much! I've been working on this nonstop all day long, and I was following your instructions and when I got to the keygen, I recognized the icon and I was like ""FUCK that thing doesn't work!"" Then, randomly, fuckin magically, the patch worked this time! And I was so nervous pasting the codes, and then, AND THEN IT MOTHER GRABBING WORKED!!!!!!! AFT3RMIDN1GHT OH MY GOD I LOVE YOU!!!

,darkmata,2011-04-17T07:27Z,"i've never had so much trouble b4, this is the 4th vegas i've downloaded, i follow the instructions carefully and always the activation code says incorectly entered...i've wasted so much downloading and time!!!"
,tawoooos,2011-04-29T13:32Z,followed Aft3rMiDn1Ght 's instructions and worked perfectly.  thanks for a great torrent. :)
,iCLUTCHiEZz,2011-07-02T02:48Z,"The Keygen is a Malicious.gen and im not so sure that iÂ´ll allow it to bypass my avg antivirus, iÂ´ve heard that some antivirus programs is more sensetive than others.
for example when i ran a same type of keygen on Antivivira it didnt come up as malicious.
If its just a malicious fake where talking about then wy is it ""malicious"" if it isnt?
Thanks!"
,-WOODOO-,2011-10-20T20:27Z,TastyTeo your instructions are awesome. the keygen from this one pro9 doesn't exist anymore the file keygen is empty so i have just folow your instr. taking keygen from older version pro8 & works fine. thanks you're the man
