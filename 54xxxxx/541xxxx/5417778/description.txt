1. BACK UP YOUR SYSTEM!
-----------------------
Remember to back up your hard drives before using PartitionMagic.
While PartitionMagic has been thoroughly tested, power failures, 
operating system bugs, and hardware design bugs can put your data 
at risk. BEFORE USING ANY UTILITY THAT MAKES SUCH EXTENSIVE 
CHANGES TO YOUR HARD DISK, YOU SHOULD BACK UP YOUR DATA.

To back up your system, we recommend using Symantec Drive 
Image(R). Drive Image is a disk imaging tool that lets you create
an image of your entire system that can easily be restored. 
Having a backup lets you run PartitionMagic with the security 
of knowing that you can get your system back up and running 
if you run into problems.


2. ACTIVATING PARTITIONMAGIC
-----------------------------------
When you install PartitionMagic, the software is in demo mode until 
you activate it. In demo mode, you can make changes that appear in 
the PartitionMagic interface, but you cannot apply those changes. The 
first time you run PartitionMagic, you are prompted to activate the 
software. You can click Yes to activate the software immediately, or 
you can use the software in demo mode and activate it later. To 
activate the software later, click General > Activate Product from 
the PartitionMagic menu bar. Then follow the directions in the 
activation dialog.


3. GENERAL USAGE NOTES
----------------------
- Using PartitionMagic Tools with Norton GoBack
  If GoBack is enabled on your system and you use any of the tools
  that are installed with PartitionMagic (for example, BootMagic,
  PQBoot, PQBoot for Windows, PTEdit) you may experience conflict
  errors.

  For example, you should avoid using BootMagic (or any other
  PartitionMagic tool) if GoBack is enabled. If you have
  already used BootMagic to boot the active partition on your system
  while GoBack in enable, you will get an error stating that
  BootMagic cannot write to the Master Boot Record (MBR) and,
  therefore, the operating system cannot be started.

  To start the operating system in such cases, you must reboot the
  computer. When the GoBack screen is displayed, disable (turn
  off) GoBack.

  While disabling GoBack allows BootMagic and all other PartitionMagic
  tools to work properly, you will lose all GoBack history. If you
  decide to re-enable GoBack, you should avoid using BootMagic or any
  other PartitionMagic tools.

- Be aware that there is no undo (after clicking Apply) if you 
  merge two FAT or FAT32 partitions. You must be particularly 
  careful not to merge two primary partitions that include 
  operating systems, as your computer will not be bootable if 
  you do.

- Progress bars are an estimation only and may pause for several 
  minutes, even though PartitionMagic is still working correctly.
  If you think your computer has locked up, please be patient and 
  allow PartitionMagic to finish the operation.

- You should set up removable media drives so that they are the 
  last drives on your system. Drives are assigned priorities as 
  follows: primary master, primary slave, secondary master, 
  secondary slave. You should not have a fixed hard drive 
  set up as the secondary master if you have a removable media 
  drive set up as the primary slave. If you have two IDE
  controllers, you should connect removable media drives to 
  the second controller, after any hard drives. If you have a
  RAID configuration, disconnect any removable media (such as 
  a Zip drive) before using PartitionMagic. If you do not 
  configure removable media drives as the last drives, you 
  will see disk numbering inconsistencies in the PartitionMagic 
  interface, and the wizards will not work on your system.

- Bad Sector Checking is OFF by default. PartitionMagic ships 
  with bad sector checking turned OFF by default. Modern hard 
  disks are designed to avoid bad sectors automatically.  
  However, if you feel that bad sectors may be a problem on your 
  system, turn on bad sector checking (by unchecking the 
  appropriate boxes in the "Skip bad sector checks" list box in 
  Preferences). Turning on bad sector checking ensures that data 
  is not moved or copied to bad disk sectors; however, this 
  causes the create, move, and resize operations to slow down 
  considerably. Another way to verify that there are no bad 
  sectors on your disk is to run the operating system check 
  utility (CheckDisk or ScanDisk) and do a surface scan before 
  launching PartitionMagic.

- A non-Asian language version of PartitionMagic should never 
  be used on an Asian language version of Windows NT/2000/XP, 
  as this may cause corruption of filenames and partition/
  volume set labels.

- You cannot use PQBoot for Windows (a utility included with 
  PartitionMagic) unless there is at least one primary 
  partition on the first hard disk.



4. KNOWN ISSUES - WINDOWS NT/2000/XP ONLY
-----------------------------------------

- PartitionMagic does not support volume sets, stripe sets, stripe 
  sets with parity, or partitions located on disk mirror/duplex 
  sets configured using Windows NT Disk Administrator. Under 
  Windows 2000/XP, PartitionMagic supports standard partitions 
  located on basic disk sets only.

- In a configuration with mixed IDE and SCSI hard drives, Windows 
  NT does not always see the boot drive as the first physical hard 
  disk. PartitionMagic displays drives in the order Windows NT 
  reports them. As a result, you may see your boot device as Drive 
  1, 2, and so forth. This does not cause problems for 
  PartitionMagic except when setting a new active partition. Also, 
  PartitionMagic may incorrectly report that there is no active 
  partition on your system. To change your active partition, be 
  sure that you identify which drive is the boot drive. 

- You should not change the drive letter originally assigned to 
  the Windows NT/2000/XP boot partition (the partition where Windows 
  is installed). Changing the drive letter to anything but its 
  original designation will cause severe boot problems and may 
  cause your computer to be unbootable.

- Under Windows 2000 or Windows XP, if you perform operations 
  on partitions that include mount points, you must restore the 
  mount points after the operations are complete.

- Error 183: Init Failed. If you attempt to run PartitionMagic on 
  a Windows 2000/XP Professional machine where the boot partition
  (the partition where Windows 2000/XP Professional is installed) 
  is on a dynamic disk, you will receive the following error message: 
  "Init failed: Error 183. Unable to identify the Windows partition." 
  To solve this problem, Windows 2000/XP must be installed on a 
  basic disk.

- Error 184: If you encounter error 184 when initializing 
  PartitionMagic, run Disk Administrator (Windows NT) or Disk 
  Management (Windows 2000/XP), then start PartitionMagic again.

- If the System Restore feature of Windows XP is monitoring a drive, 
  PartitionMagic cannot perform operations on that drive in Windows. 
  Instead it must drop down to boot mode to perform the operations. 
  The operation will still be successful. 

- To uninstall PartitionMagic under Windows XP, you must be logged 
  in as the user who originally installed the product.  If the user 
  account has been deleted, you must remove PartitionMagic 
  manually by cleaning out the PartitionMagic install directory and 
  registry.



5. KNOWN ISSUES - WINDOWS 9x ONLY
---------------------------------

- On a computer with a dual boot, if you have more than 20 
  partitions, you may not be able to launch PartitionMagic from  
  Windows 9x.

- If you create an NTFS partition under Windows 9x, it will be 
  created with NTFS version 3.0, which is not compatible with 
  Windows NT 4.0.  To create an NTFS version 1.2 partition that will 
  work with Windows NT 4.0, run PartitionMagic under Windows NT 4.0 
  or from the rescue disks and create the partition.

- Under Windows 9x, PartitionMagic and the operating system may assign 
  different drive letters to USB, USB2, and FireWire drives. This 
  problem is a result of the inconsistent way the operating system 
  assigns drive letters for removable devices. If the drive 
  letters appear differently in PartitionMagic than they do in "My 
  Computer," PartitionMagic can still work on the removable drive.


6. UNINSTALLING WINDOWS ME
--------------------------
If you use PartitionMagic (or FDISK or any other partitioning
software), you should be aware of the following Microsoft warning.

IMPORTANT: You should not attempt to uninstall Windows Me if the 
partition information for your hard disk or disks has changed 
since you last installed Windows Me successfully.  Windows Me 
creates a backup copy of your partition information in the 
Suhdlog.dat file at the end of a successful installation, and 
Uninstal.exe restores the partition information listed in the 
Suhdlog.dat file to your hard disk during the uninstall.  If the 
partition information on your hard disk or disks has changed 
since you last installed successfully (specifically, since the 
Suhdlog.dat file was created), then you might experience partial 
or complete data loss as a result of attempting to uninstall 
Windows Me.
