,akns,2010-03-25T04:30Z,"i got the dec.dll and the .cab file (for windows mobile) from the 17.1 torrent I downloaded a while ago. Both let met use UpToDate, but there is no content when I click on any of the topics. So i think this torrent is junk."

,Alkari,2010-05-15T05:25Z,"Unfortunately, this torrent is broken. The dec.dll file from version 17.1 does not work, content is not shown properly. IÂ´ve searched a lot, and there isnÂ´t any registration crack, either. I guess weÂ´ll have to wait for the next release."
