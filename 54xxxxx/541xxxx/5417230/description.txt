From Wiki:


Our Lady Peace (known also by its initialism OLP[1][2]) is an alternative rock band that formed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1992.[3] The band is headed by lead singer Raine Maida; with Jeremy Taggart on percussion, Duncan Coutts on bass, and Steve Mazur as lead guitarist. The band has sold over five million albums worldwide, [4] won four Juno Awards, and won ten MuchMusic Video Awards â€” the most MMVAs ever awarded to any artist or group.[5]

OLP has released seven studio albums, one live album, and two compilation albums, with their 1997 album Clumsy often being considered their signature and most widely recognized work to date.[6] They have enjoyed many hit singles, ranging from "Starseed" in 1994, to "Somewhere Out There" in 2002.

While the band's first four albums were often praised for their unique sound and style, their fifth album, Gravity, is sometimes noted to have been a "radical departure"[7] from their distinctive style of music and has been criticized as being "too mainstream".[8] The 2001 departures of both founding member Mike Turner and longtime-producer Arnold Lanni, in combination with influence from then-new producer Bob Rock, are sometimes credited as main factors in the style change.[9]

After nearly breaking up during the recording of their sixth studio album Healthy in Paranoid Times in 2005,[4] the band took a prolonged hiatus before releasing their most recent album, Burn Burn, in June 2009.[10][11] In addition to a December 2009 announcement about a 2010 tour that will feature their Clumsy and Spiritual Machines albums in their entireties,[12] the band has confirmed that they will begin recording their eighth album in January 2010. 







A Decade 2006


A Decade is Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace's first compilation album, released on November 21, 2006 in Canada, and November 28, 2006 in the United States. Included on the album are top tracks "Where Are You", "Clumsy", "In Repair", "Somewhere Out There", "Innocent", "Thief", "Naveed", "Starseed" and "4 A.M.". Also included are the two unreleased songs "Kiss on the Mouth" and "Better Than Here".

The Canadian release of the album includes a bonus DVD containing live footage of the songs "Picture", "Thief", "Innocent", "Where Are You", "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face", and "Clumsy" shot on November 6, 2005 at Massey Hall in Toronto. It also includes interviews with the current band members, behind the scenes footage, a photo gallery, and discography with lyrics.

"4 A.M." has been remixed and is a different version than the one originally heard from OLP's Clumsy album.

"In Repair" and "Life" appear with narration from Ray Kurzweil's book The Age of Spiritual Machines, which inspired the album Spiritual Machines, on which the two song were featured. The narration on "Life" was not issued on Spiritual Machines.

The first single from the album was "Kiss on the Mouth", released in Canada in September 2006.

The band has stated that this will be the last album featuring Saul Fox on the cover.[citation needed] Previously, Fox was seen on the covers of Our Lady Peace's first four albums.
