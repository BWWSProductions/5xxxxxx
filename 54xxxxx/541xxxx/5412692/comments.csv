Which I still have btw. havent put it up since The Gathering (HUUUGE lan in Norway once a year) back in '99 or something. We had a ""Retro stand"" with ataris, c64's, first gen Amiga etc. Was fun.

,zda3,2010-04-07T05:18Z,"sounds like tyrian.  aafter completing arcade mode you can type in cheats at the title screen to get new game modes and ships? like 'unknown' etc.

you can even do 2 player coop with on piloting the small fast craft and the other the heavy support ship, then they can dock and get combi weapons, etc."

,jowjowjow,2010-06-04T10:17Z,"Old memories arise... Started with an ZX-81 with less then 1KB memory and no keyboard! Only some pressure sensitive plate. then came sinclair Spectrum, VC20, VC64, ATARI 512STM, AMIGA 500 and then, where we are landed in the end, a PC.

I see the games and it makes me feel warm. Bubble Bobble on C64 ruled at that time big, hooo!!

GOOD UPLOAD! VERY APPRECIATED! THANKSSS!!"
,bergeot,2010-06-18T12:18Z,"NES roms and emulators

alerte trojan : FCEU.EXE"
,chazzo125,2010-08-01T00:53Z,"Reminds me of when games were simple, but an awful lot of FUN!!!!

These are Nintendo NES ROMs with a PC NES emulator, mostly use arrow cursor keys and 'alt' key as controls, sometimes 'enter' key. Try spacebar too for some games. 

ENJOY!!!  &  HAVE FUN!!!!"
