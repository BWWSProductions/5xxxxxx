Danish film has an audio language other than Danish, the original for this film. Are people getting weak in the head, or what."
,mabritta,2011-10-15T13:06Z,"Nationalist Gorgang, I've searched for ""Babettes gaestebud"" here in PB but I've got no hits. Why don't you upload and seed it for us? I'm sure that all no english speakers really would like so much to hear the original audio."
,mabritta,2011-10-15T16:11Z,"Warning: this movie is not english spoken, with ENG, FR and BR subtitles. Maybe danish original audio, but deffinitely not english. Thanks huzmo!"

,blugoo,2012-04-15T06:58Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092603/
...confirms characters speak Danish, Swedish and French.
Did I understand correctly that this rip is from a Brazilian DVD? Is it censored? The British apparently edited this movie to make it more family-friendly. Any fan here?
Otherwise, could someone please post the video info (GSpot log or similar) for this file?
Many thanks."
,canapple,2012-07-18T01:42Z,@huzmo: thank you for the upload. but why would you say the movie is english? it is not and surely you should know.
