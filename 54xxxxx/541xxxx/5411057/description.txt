Dennis Wilson was the drummer in the Beach Boys. And he was the real Beach Boy. 
In a band of geeks who sang about surfing, cars and girls, Dennis was the only 
one who surfed, the one who drove hot rod cars in competition and the one who 
got all the girls.  He was married five times, shared a house with Charles 
Manson (with whom he wrote songs, including one recorded by the Beach Boys) but 
died, ironically by drowning, at the age of 39. He was also the first Beach Boy 
to release a solo album, the stunning Pacific Ocean Blue, which after years of 
being out of print and fetching hundreds on Ebay, was re-released in 2008 to 
widespread acclaim, being voted No 1 Reissue of the Year by Mojo and Uncut 
magazines.   This documentary tells the story of Dennis's life and music, with 
unseen archive footage and original interviews with Beach Boys Al Jardine and 
David Marks, his sons Michael and Carl and many friends and fellow musicians. 
These include Taylor Hawkins, drummer with the Foo Fighters who provided a vocal 
for the lost track on Pacific Ocean Blue, Holy Man, for which Dennis never laid 
down a vocal when he recorded the song in 1977.
