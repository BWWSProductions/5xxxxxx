@Goatmaster:
Ever tried updating any of your software? If your winrar - or whatever you use - is from like 2007 don't wonder if you get CRC errors!"
,cldrain,2010-03-09T04:27Z,"The Video is watchable but why bother.  Wait for the real release and you can 100% enjoyment out of this show.  

Good things come to those who wait.  :)
