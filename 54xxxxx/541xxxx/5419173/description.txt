twentyforty I just want to thank you for the fantastic stand up job you've been doing so far. I am totally grateful for your services. I live in Ghana, West Africa, and so have very slow internet connection. It really makes a big difference in download time when the files are as compressed as yours. 
I was wondering if by any chance you were considering putting up the Academy Awards telecast tomorrow?? I would be even more grateful than I already am if you did!!
Keep up the good work!!

@closetmaniac: Yes, because every year ceremony was released as 1.34 GB XviD (it automatically "fits" in by "really big in size"). Just be here around Monday noon.

NOTE: Main event hasn't been released yet by anyone. As soon as I get one, I would re-encode it and up the torrent.
