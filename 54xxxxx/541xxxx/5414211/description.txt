[color=yellow]NOTES:[/color]

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
Here we go with another homemade,this time The Crazies.....
Firstly we thank cascade for the audio......thanks.
Right work done.....need to straighten video and tweak it a little...but we've got to say colours are slightly
off ,but we tried every,soon as you've got some parts looking sweet other parts look wrong so we've done
the best we could.
Also there is a chair in the bottom right hand corner,we opted to leave in so we didn't lost any picture ...We have 
added a screen comparsion shot below so you can see the difference.
Audio.....now this was pain to sync.Runtime was different on cascades release compared to ours yet more or less
started the same place and end the same place.....so we opted to stretch the audio to fit but still left us having to do 
alot of cuts....
Another thing is we found cascades audi owa sok but had alot of noises in it and overpowering.....filtered it the best we
could but still there but not as bad.

Anyway enjoy another homemade one....and heads up,keep an eye out for cop out,alice and brooklyns :P
