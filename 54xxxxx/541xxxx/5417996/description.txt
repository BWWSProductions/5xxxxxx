WhereIsIt v2010.218 *Portable*

size 02x5mb
date 03/07/10

The primary goal for WhereIsIt is to provide access 
to the contents of cataloged disks, even when they 
are not available on the system, or even they are 
not your own. You can browse their contents, search 
for files or folders you need, use imported descriptions 
and thumbnails, organize data using categories and flags. 

Registration : put lic file in install dir
Note : As usual, better block app with fw when registering!

DEAD ON ARRIVAL : we sure acknowledge that what
we do may be questionnable, but considering a lot
of people seem to like our releases (no matter if
they expire or not), we shall keep on releasing
cause it seems our stuff is way more appreciated
than what is usually done scenewide. Now instead
of logging onto your coolest ftpd and grab last
update of some soft nobody gives a shit about, maybe
show your talent in removing the i-net checks of
our apps and/or keygening them. That will be really
useful for everybody!
Today, some apps can't be cracked/keygened the old
way, that's why we're here.
