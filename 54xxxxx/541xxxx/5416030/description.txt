â€œ	David Byrne composes the soundtrack to the film Young Adam, featuring members of Mogwai and Belle & Sebastian.
David Byrne returned to his birthplace, Scotland, to compose the score Lead Us Not Into Temptation â€” the soundtrack for Young Adam â€” a film directed by David MacKenzie. Byrne had been approached to score the soundtrack for Young Adam by his friends Hercules and Jeremy at the Recorded Picture Company, also producers of Bernardo Bertolucci's film The Last Emperor. Byrne co-wrote the score for The Last Emperor with Ryuichi Sakamoto and Cong Su, and ultimately won the Academy Award, the Golden Globe, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association Award (1987) for Best Original Score. Young Adam is an adaptation of the 1954 novel by the Scottish beat writer Alexander Trocchi, starring Ewan McGregor, Peter Mullan and Tilda Swinton. The film, an entirely Scottish production, is set against a very grim and repressed post-war Scotland.
In order to capture that mood, both MacKenzie and Byrne agreed that working with a group of Glaswegian musicians would be ideal. Byrne put together an ensemble of contemporary musicians from critically acclaimed Scottish bands that include Mogwai, Belle & Sebastian, The Delgados and Appendix Out. The musicians recorded Byrne's compositions at a studio in Glasgow.	â€
