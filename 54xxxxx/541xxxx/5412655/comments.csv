,alcutter,2010-03-06T22:40Z,"Despite Leto's in-depth analysis, Salo is considered to be a classic retelling of Sade's book, in the context of Italian fascism during WWII.

It is never boring, unless you're a 14-year-old who tries to watch the movie between games of CoD. "
[T],insinuendo,2010-03-06T23:59Z,"Undoubtedly this release will provoke debate as it did in the 1970s.

""Rated the 65th scariest movie of all times by the Chicago Film Critics Association in 2006.""

Though I agree with Leto on it being far from coming close to re-enacting presicely De Sade's work, which was written about 230 years ago, it still remains a shoking analyses and an undeniable attempt at expressing the depravity human nature is capable of reaching and the results of the excess of power of some individuals over others. 

Shocked, bored, disgusted, revolted, whatever you might think of this movie, or of the book which incited the creation of this piece of art, it remains an undeniable effort at expressing what many have tried to deny. "
