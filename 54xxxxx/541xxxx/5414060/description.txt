Revenge is coming

Two years have passed since Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBouef), Optimus Prime (voiced by Transformers: The Series' Peter Cullen) and the Autobots saved the planet from Megatron (voiced by The Matrix Trilogy's Hugo Weaving) and the Decepticons. Despite Sam's extreme heroics, the battle of Mission City has become an urban legend believed only by conspiracy theorists. Now he's preparing for the biggest challenge in his life: Leaving home for college. What will happen to his girlfriend, Mikaela (Megan Fox) and his robot protector, Bumblebee? Meanwhile, the Autobots work with the US military, Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and USAF Master Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) to track down the remaining Decepticon forces on Earth, although Nantional Security Advisor Theodore Galloway (John Benjamin Hickey) has other ideas when it comes to the safety of the human race. When Sam's college experience sours amidst nerdy roommates (Ramon Rodriguez), sexy stalkers (Isabel Lucas) and strange, unexplainable visions, he seeks to understand what the Decepticons know only too well. A normal life will have to wait, because an ancient enemy is on its way to destroy Earth! Can Sam, Optimus and co. save the day in the ultimate battle of good vs. evil?
