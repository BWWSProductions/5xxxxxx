Will seed until i cant no more. "
,GundamGPO3,2010-03-11T07:42Z,"Excellent torrent, I've been watching straight through, but it seems episode 6 is corrupt. I've checked the download, redownloaded 3 times, and it still glitches out at 23:05. I'd recommend taking this down for a while until you know for sure that all the episodes work :)"
,vvfking,2010-03-11T09:10Z,Episode 6 of the 3th season?
,vvfking,2010-03-12T07:30Z,"I checked episode 6 season 3, and it works. I use VLC though, but it should work.."
,Baulie,2010-03-18T16:56Z,"Common guys , SEED! - dont be lame with 4 kb/s"
,thunderbum,2010-03-23T06:19Z,Thanks - looking forward to having it all down :)
,fucknwo,2010-05-05T01:41Z,"Please seed, I've been downloading for, pretty much, 48 hours now and and i'm only at around 15%.
It won't kill you to seed..."
,watchafantasy27,2010-06-12T10:52Z,"Im not unstanding whats seed mean? and does that slow down bit torrent when ur downloading if alot of files are left over? i always delete n remove once i dl?

Thanks for the help, i hope to hear soon from someone"
,vvfking,2010-06-13T23:43Z,"well, a seed is a ""host"". It's another computer somewhere else in the world which shares files with you.

And if you delete right after downloading, you are not really contributing for ""torrents"", as they will die out if no one seeds. I would prefer that the people who download could at least seed for 3-4 days. As this is 3 seasons of a very good tvshow, that you get free ;) "
,vvfking,2010-06-26T16:49Z,"I am planning on uploading seasons 1-4 in 720p HD,
with each episode at 1,09 GB, and im planning on uploading a version with 320p so people with slow internet can download it."
,Baneful1,2010-07-06T20:52Z,@vvfking: Which episodes from this version will you be using for your 1-4 720p torrent? That way I can get a head start and then help seed once I pick up the rest.
,vvfking,2010-07-07T14:25Z,From this torrent I will only use the ones who are in 720p.
,StringSci,2010-07-07T23:08Z,"Great torrent, finished off my season 3 collection from this.

Looking forward to the complete 720p torrent!"
,vvfking,2010-07-10T00:41Z,"I will be uploading the 720p version when the last part of season 4 has come out, but It might take longer. Since i had to rewrite all the subtitles season 1-2."
,cfsnipa,2010-08-10T09:42Z,this will be the only one i will seed ever =] but i really cant wait for a burn notice season 4 torrent!!! and does anyone know how i can burn a full episode to a dual layered disk i have? or what disk i need
,tvrocks,2010-08-29T18:16Z,"Quick question, you say it has English subtitles why would it need them if it's in English?  Also can you watch it without the subtitles rolling along the bottom of the screen?"
,tvrocks,2010-08-29T18:22Z,"Quick question, why do you have english subtitles when the program is in english and can you watch it without the subtitles?"
,vvfking,2010-09-04T23:01Z,"Well, if you don't want the subtitles you can simply just delete the text files that come with the video.

Subtitles can be useful if you are foreign, I am not English, but my English is pretty good.
However I use subtitles on films in my own language as well, this is because sometimes its hard to hear what they say, and sometimes they speak very fast, and that's why I think subtitles are very useful."
,cjenvy,2010-09-17T19:41Z,@vvfking when can i expect the season 1-4 torrent to be up 
,Ashan_i,2010-09-20T07:54Z,About 6 episodes in Season 3 are in .MKV format for anyone interested.  All the rest are in .AVI.  Just a heads up.  Thanks for the awesome U/L.  Greatly appreciated.
