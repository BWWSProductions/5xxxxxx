New Young Pony Club
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

New Young Pony Club are a five piece rock band from London, England, containing members from London, Hereford, Cambridge and Bromley. Taking influences from post-punk and New Wave.
New Young Pony Club are influenced by many different bands and acts, and try not to risk becoming too close to the sound of any one other band. Their own take on their music is "We marry the dance ethic with the pop ethic, and make something that you can dance to and sing along to".
