Angle this week: Denial among those that won't see the way things are heading.

Denial of facts at face value:

                  An excerpt from the wiki entry
states:Denial is a defense mechanism postulated by Sigmund Freud, in which a person is faced with 
a fact that is too uncomfortable to accept and rejects it instead, insisting that it is not true 
despite what may be overwhelming evidence. [1] The subject may use:

    * simple denial - deny the reality of the unpleasant fact altogether
    * minimisation - admit the fact but deny its seriousness, or
    * projection - admit both the fact and seriousness but deny responsibility.

The theory of denial 
was first researched seriously by Anna Freud. She classified denial as a mechanism of the 
immature mind, because it conflicts with the ability to learn from and cope with reality.
Now, just like when a parent is told their child is a bully often the first reaction will be
"MY CHILD, they wouldn't hurt a fly". It's the immature mind which is first indoctrinated into
systmes, such as religious, military, nationaistic and political.

I didn't think I'd end up doing a show where I'd stick up for Alex Jones. This, however, in the
case of his interviewer was an excellent example of minimalism denial.

I then go on to make my case for the obviousness of the big brother society we live in. Just like
watching a movie with foreign subtitles. You can see how the words are constructed and how the
sentences flow but not make sense of them. Seeing the reality around us is the same in priciple.
There is a narritive around us everyday that can be decoded with some simple research.
