Michael Wong originally came to England at the age of ten as a refugee from Vietnam. He first took up Martial Arts as a result of being bullied at school. Starting his training with a Chinese Master in the UK Sifu Wong progressed quickly in skill and after 5 years traveled to Hong Kong and Mainland China to study with a variety of Chinese masters in his early twenties. Training in a wide variety of Martial Arts has given Sifu Wong a foundation and skill level rarely seen in the Martial Arts world. It also allows him to provide a highly comprehensive teaching program for a great many students with differing requirements. Having opened the Ho Wan Academy in 1992 in the back of his takeaway shop Sifu Wong discovered there was a great demand for Martial Arts in the area and was never short of students. This eventually led to the opening of the Master Wong Academy at Charles Street in Ipswich, becoming one of only a handful of full time training centers in the region.
