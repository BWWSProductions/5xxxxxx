And btw to anyone reading this, I was the first person to upload the MTV Hard Rock Live In Orlando album so if any of y'all want to thank me rather than taking the credit for yourselves I'd greatly appreciate it. I looked so fucking long for that album and finally got it from a friend who was at the concert, but yeah, great torrent."
