Product Description:
RemoteSight is an application for video and audio transmission over a network. It captures video from any attached video input device (for example the built-in iSight camera included in many Macintosh computers), which can then be viewed on another computer over a network or the internet.

The primary use of RemoteSight is as part of a Mac-based video surveillance system, sending video and audio feeds over a network to a central recording computer. To this end it integrates seamlessly with SecuritySpy, our flagship video surveillance software product.

RemoteSight can also be used as a standalone application for remotely monitoring anything happening on or around a particular computer, effectively turning the computer's camera into a network camera that can be viewed in a web browser such as Safari.

--> Streams video and audio via the built-in web server
--> Supports most Macintosh-compatible cameras and audio input devices
--> Screen capture
