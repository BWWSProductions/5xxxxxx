================================================================================
It's been a good 2 YEARS + since Blizzard made the news about SC2. It's like heaven.

Then they decided to not let the Mormons and Jehovah's Witness into Heaven!

Ya it's cool, no one uses lan play for games anymore right? Get FUCKED Blizzard!

I can understand wanting people to use Bnet but this is the Internet were talking about!

Let the best server willing to make Sim Ant stye maps for conquerable territory win. Bnet server or whatever emulated one comes along.

If they are shut down like torrent servers are, well, we'll have more then enough servers. :D


Anyways after getting this to work I thought I'd share what I got /w the rest of you looking for that "one click download for Starcraft 2"

================================================================================

So we got some maps in here, the Lazy Loader 2.0 will open the installed Starcraft 2 in program files.

The original Starcraft 2.exe in program files won't do anything. Alt + F4 to close it.

There is also a Starcrack loader that can change races. For now just restart the game to get a different random race. :)

There is a GUI to change the difficulty or you can use a mod version for harder comps. Seems it's only 4 players, 1 human, 3 comps all ffa for this beta.


================================================================================


AVG Antivirus is alright to detect trojans. Didn't run into any problems. Only 1 lazy launcher had a trojan in it. Did not add that to the torrent file. :P

Comodo free firewall is nice for yes/no on yer net/programs

Peer Block is good to block bad ip addresses while downloading. (formally Peer Guardian 2)

Hope I find one of your torrents FULL of maps and mods for more awesome gameplay someday. :D

Thanks Blizzard, great game except the lack of lan play. Least we know others will just add that in.

Perhaps the pirate version WILL be better, not need a key, have conquerable territory and not just skirmishes.

Thanks to Lazy Launcher and all those who helped make this possible. I'm just trying to help make it easy by gathering all I've got for my swarm on here.

Live for the swarm!
