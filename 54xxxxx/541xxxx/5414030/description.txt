Notes: Bowie included Simpsons and Oom Pa Pa signals. The second set was preceded by birthday wishes for a fan named Amy and a remark that Buried Alive was inspired by Jimmy Herring. Possum included a Random Note and two Aw Fuck! signals (including one from Mike). Harpua was set in the â€œteeming jungles of Brazilâ€ and included a special guest appearance by Marley as â€œa vicious, flesh eating animal.â€ There was a brief full-band Fire tease, high-pitched â€œBrazilâ€ squawks from Fishman, and a preview of the Clifford Ball motto (four years early) as Trey introduced Page as â€œa beacon of light in the world of flight.â€  The Aquarium Rescue Unit was the opening act.
