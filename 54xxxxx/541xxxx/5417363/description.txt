DerniÃ¨re VolontÃ© (Last Will, in English) is the name under which French musician Geoffroy D writes martial music, neoclassical music, dark ambient and military pop. Throughout his early period, Geoffroy tended to write a fusion of martial music and dark ambient. Choosing to focus on atmosphere, rhythm, and historical samples, he left little emphasis to be placed on vocals and melody. However, with the release of his 2003 effort, Les Blessures De L'Ombre, Geoffroy took a new direction, applying his martial style to verse-chorus song structures and pop melodies.

Geoffroy is featured as a guest artist on the Der Blutharsch album Time is thee enemy!.
