OnlineEye Pro is a small, easy-to-use TCP/IP protocol monitor that lets you see your exact throughput on both incoming and outgoing data, whether you're using a modem, a cable modem, DSL, or even a local network. OnlineEye Pro also lets you see how quickly your data goes from your computer to another computer on the Internet, and it will tell you how many other computers your data must go through to get there.

A zoomable and printable graph shows time and speed history, allowing you to see what Internet activity took place when you were away from the computer.
