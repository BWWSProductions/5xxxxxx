,arnolddk,2010-03-05T21:35Z,"downloading, and after that, seeding!!!!i really apreciate all what you upload, and I just whant to say a big thanx!!! and also for the poeple that do not write comments, i say thanx for them as wel!

btw its hard to make an account on tpb, because of the activation link, they do not send it, only if you get lucky, so lot of poeple download, but don't have accounts --> no comments :s"
