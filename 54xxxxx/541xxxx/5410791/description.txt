Like his fellow Yellow Magic Orchestra alumnus Ryuichi Sakamoto, keyboardist and programmer Haruomi Hosono has a taste for exotic experimentation. But the similarities pretty much end there. Sakamotoâ€™s solo work runs to a sort of light contemporary classical music, and his collaborations have tended to be with pop musicians. On N.D.E., Hosono teams up with a host of sidemen both famous (bassist Bill Laswell) and obscure (saxophonist Yasuaki Shimizu, violinist Arun Bagal) to create a beautiful, funky, and yet strangely creepy collage of electronic beats, modal melodies, and exotic samples. Not surprisingly, Laswellâ€™s is the strongest presence here â€” on â€œNavigationsâ€ he pretty much takes over with his trademark punchy basslines and samples of North African ululations, while the textures and drones of â€œEdge of the Endâ€ recall his own Hear No Evil album of a few years earlier. Another strong voice here is that of Bagal, whose keening modal violin make â€œStrange Attractorâ€ and â€œAeroâ€ two of the most compelling items on this album. Highly recommended.
