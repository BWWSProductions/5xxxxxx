,nicoloff49,2010-08-25T05:46Z,"whats the password for deep freeze, I completed the install and as it said in the install the computer would restart, I restarted and then deep freeze was just there but no password or anything"
,nicoloff49,2010-08-25T06:13Z,"figured out the problem, when the computer restarts immediately pull up the system tray icon of Deep Freeze (you can also restart if you fail to do this right) and hold SHIFT and Double-click it. A message should appear and (for me) it disappeared after 5 seconds, it basically just asks a password has not been set would you like to go to the login screen. Just click yes and you can set the password there. I've got Windows 7 ultimate so it could be different for you depending on OS "
