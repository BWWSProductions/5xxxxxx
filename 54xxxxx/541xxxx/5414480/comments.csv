They weren't even released in our theaters here, grrr!  I'll take any quality!! You're vids are the best, keep up the good work!!!!"
,sweetspirit1,2010-03-07T01:23Z,I JUST STARTED DL WILL COMMENT WHEN DONE BUT I THANK YOU
,michaelrwatson,2010-03-07T02:35Z,"Video is excellent (for a cam/telesync). Audio isn't that bad--it's got background noise, hiss or echos? and stuff, but nothing fatal like humming, or babies crying. 

V9 A5

Still, i just may go see this one in the theatre!! "
,bychance,2010-03-07T06:27Z,"The sample is watchable, 7/10. Not too bad for a cam. Still, I'll wait for your next attempt.
Thanks for your hard work RH."
