IMAGiNE NOTES
IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....
Here we go with another homemade,this time The Crazies.....

Firstly we thank cascade for the audio......thanks.

Right work done.....need to straighten video and tweak it a little...but we've got to say colors are slightly off, but we tried every, soon as you've got some parts looking sweet other parts look wrong so we've done the best we could.

Also there is a chair in the bottom right hand corner, we opted to leave in so we didn't lost any picture ...We have added a screen comparison shot below so you can see the difference.

Audio.....now this was pain to sync. Run time was different on cascades release compared to ours yet more or less started the same place and end the same place.....so we opted to stretch the audio to fit but still left us having to do a lot of cuts....

Another thing is we found cascades audio was ok but had a lot of noises in it and overpowering.....filtered it the best we could but still there but not as bad.

credit IMAGiNE & BADASS BIG BIG BIG TIME & to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone
