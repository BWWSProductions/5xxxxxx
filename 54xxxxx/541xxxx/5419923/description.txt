Define The Great Line

  A Moment Suspended In Time
  Casting Such A Thin Shadow
  Everyone Looks So Good From Here
  In Regards To Myself
  Moving For The Sake Of Motion
  Returning Empty Handed
  Salmarnir
  There Could Be Nothing After This
  To Whom It May Concern
  Writing On The Walls
  You're Ever So Inviting


Lost In The Sound Of Separation

  A Fault Line, A Fault Of Mine
  Anyone Can Dig A Hole But It Takes A Real Man To Call It Home
  Breathing In A New MEntality
  Coming Down Is Calming Down
  Desolate Earth The End Is Here
  Desperate Times, Desperate Measures
  Emergency Broadcast The End Is Near
  The Created Void
  The Only Survivor Was Miraculously Unharmed
  Too Bright To See, Too Loud To Hear
  We Are The Involuntary

  A Moment Suspended In Time
  Casting Such A Thin Shadow
  Everyone Looks So Good From Here
  In Regards To Myself
  It's Dangerous Business Walking Out Your Front Door
  Moving for the Sake of Motion
  Returning Empty Handed
  To Whom It May Concern
  Writing On The Walls
  Young and Aspiring
  You're Ever So Inviting

  Letting Go Of Tonight
  Never Meant To Break Your Heart
  Short Of Daybreak
  When The Sun Sleeps


They're Only Chasing Safety

  A Boy Brushed Red... Living In Black and White
  Down, Set, Go
  I Don't Feel Very Receptive Today
  I'm Content With Losing
  It's Dangerous Business Walking Out Your Front Door
  Reinventing Your Exit
  Some Will Seek Forgiveness, Others Escape
  The Blue Note
  The Impact Of Reason
