,BasilBrush,2010-03-09T11:03Z,I didn't see any junior races on Eurosport.

I see you once uploaded two junior races:

* IBU Biathlon Youth World Championships Pursuit Canmore

* IBU Biathlon Youth World Championships Sprint Junior Men Canmore

I really need some footage of junior racing. Is it possible for you to re-seed those? Thank you very kindly."
,BasilBrush,2010-03-11T11:25Z,"Yes, I'll dig the junior races out - just add the torrent files to your BT client and it should start downloading automatically."
,BasilBrush,2010-03-11T11:38Z,The Canmore races were from last year (Jan/Feb 2009). I no longer have those files.
,BasilBrush,2010-03-11T20:49Z,Maybe one of the other viewers might have the files.
,BasilBrush,2010-03-11T21:07Z,"There an FIS Junior Team Gundersen event from Hinterzarten dated 31st Jan 2010 plus two IBU Junior events from Torsby around the same date. These are all the junior events for this year (2010).
I'm seeding these at the moment."
,PixelPaul,2010-03-12T18:41Z,"Thank you for checking :)
If anyone else has the Canmore Youth biathlon races noted above, could you please seed them? It would be most appreciated!"
