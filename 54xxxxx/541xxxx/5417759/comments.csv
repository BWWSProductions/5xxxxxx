,proglenn500,2010-03-09T02:43Z,"Aww, it's not working for me. :( 

It says on my WinRar that, 

""C:\Users\Glenn\Documents\Downloads\E__Newgame_Major.League.Baseball.2K10-RELOADED\rld-ml10.r00: CRC failed in rld-ml10.iso. The file is corrupt
!   C:\Users\Glenn\Documents\Downloads\E__Newgame_Major.League.Baseball.2K10-RELOADED\rld-ml10.r10: The file ""???"" header is corrupt
!   C:\Users\Glenn\Documents\Downloads\E__Newgame_Major.League.Baseball.2K10-RELOADED\rld-ml10.r11: The archive is either in unknown format or damaged""

What do I do?"
,proglenn500,2010-03-09T06:23Z,"Nvm, I'm sorry about that, I just misplaced one of the rar files. x) Epic fail, haha."

,henderson80,2011-05-31T16:33Z,"Ok,I've downloaded the torrent,then I extracted,then I mounted,then I installed.Guess what?The game plays but there is no video.In other words in the game screen it is pitch black.I can only see the lineups.Has anyone else had this problem?How do I fix this?"
,razzy7002,2011-07-14T19:24Z,So do I have to unrar all the files? Even though they are all the same file size? And what do I do after that?
,feagaijohnson,2012-03-01T10:38Z,"hey guys! 
I probably sound like an idiot to all you guys but what exactly do you ""mount""? Sorry im new to all this torrent and cracks and what not. I have no idea how to it all. So if somebody could give me a hand with that, it'd be really appreciated. I love baseball and i really wanna get this game working on my laptop! Thanks guys."
