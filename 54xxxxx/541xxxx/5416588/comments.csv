,g00p993,2010-03-07T17:43Z,any comments on quality? I know that there had been an upload of the 720p that was really a DVD rip... please comment
[T],youssef0eddoumali,2010-03-13T00:04Z,"thx
i like them HD movies @ as small as possible size without altering the quality the ripper must be a professional one"
,shadowmilo2,2010-03-14T03:45Z,"For the size of it, it would seem a good x264 1080p bluray movie.

But the DL speed atm is sitting under 1kb/s......


SEED PEOPLE SEED, THERE ARE OTHER WHO WANT THIS MOVIE TOO, SO HELP US BY AT LLLEEEASSSTTT UPLOADING AT 50-150KB/S!!!

Cmon people, its called PEER TO PEER for a reason.

Once i have it i shall be back to post about its quality."

,rutjeknor,2010-03-23T19:58Z,what if i want 2 watch it on my TV!!!
,cclloyd,2010-04-02T03:37Z,"DAMN THOSE WHO UPLOAD DTS

Just upload in the format most people do, so that it plays on Xbox, PS3, and TV"
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-05-22T10:15Z,"To hell with xbox, ps3 and tv. DTS kills AC3! If you can't play that on your crappy hardware, then do your small part and fucking re-encode the audio yourself, it's not that fucking hard. Stop whining and enjoy some proper quality! ;("
,sudhan,2010-07-04T11:48Z,"DTS Rocks man....
Keep up the good work!!!"
,sudhan,2010-07-04T12:02Z,"Audio is stunning,
But next time keep up the 1080 mark!"
,ennileah,2010-07-04T14:03Z,"A/10
