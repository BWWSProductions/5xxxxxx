,galaxyworldwide877,2010-05-02T20:58Z,"@giorgoss12345 A dvdrip means the video file contained in this torrent was ripped (extracted)  from a commercial dvd using an application such as Magic DVD Ripper, and stored as another smaller type of file, usually .avi or mpeg format. The smaller file is then faster to upload and download and takes up less hard drive space. You must then use another application such as Convert X to DVD to change the file back to a format that can be read by a standalone DVD player. NTSC or PAL format depending on where you live and the type of player you have. For future reference, do not ask technical questions on TPB, Google anything you are not sure of, as most uploaders and users will not take time to answer tech questions. These comment spaces are reserved for asking questions about audio and video quality and so forth, and to thank the uploaders, like in this case prithwi_86, for the torrent."
