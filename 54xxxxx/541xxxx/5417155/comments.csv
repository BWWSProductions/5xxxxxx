,DavalPrestor,2010-05-15T04:16Z,I have always been looking for Alien Crossfire for ever and now that I have found it it wont load. I keep getting a message whn I open the file that contains the download its keeps saying that it does not have enough memory to process or some shit like that. Help?
,retheldirood,2010-08-10T09:19Z,"Dunno what's causing the problem... Running XP, have the needed computer stats, but SMAC gets a critical failure on launch and SMAX says I need the right CD inserted.  Went and got the XP patch and the update for SMAX to the latest version, same results.  Am I doing something wrong?"
