Charming cartoon about a woman who ponders over the strange chain of events that made her forefathers and -mothers meet and create the premises for her becoming the person that she is.

Norway had not won an Oscar since 1951, when Thor Heyerdahl got the prize for his documentary 'Kon.Tiki'. 

Narration by Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann in both language tracks.

This was one of my first rips and uploads back in May 2007, when I wanted to start with something small to gain experience. I made one English and one Norwegian version, both 136 Mb. Today, I can combine both language tracks in one smaller file with much better quality.

English is track 1 and will play as default in Windows Meda Player. To choose the Norwegian track, use any other player than WMP, right-click and choose audio track 2. For example the free VLC player:
