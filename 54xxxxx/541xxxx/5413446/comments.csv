,Psijic,2010-03-24T20:10Z,"Hey gentlemen why can't I recover Windows I recently installed from it's native dvd? I mean this torrent iso version, of course. I just have a hidden recovery partition on my notebook (asus), and boot goes from it. But I can't recover my win7 to make it's own boot.ini (or whatever else the 7 has), because disc says it's another win version (please insert dvd I installed my windows from, this bastard says)! That's bullshit.
Yours truly, Pasha."
