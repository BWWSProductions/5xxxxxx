              They say that the clothes make the man, but in this case,
              they make the difference between life and death! From
              medieval armour to modern-day chainmail and liquid polymer
              shark suits and high-tech fireproof gear, Stock gets
              dressed for success. In face-offs against battle axes,
              135kg shark bites and a flame-thrower, Ryan entrusts his
              life to various super suits.
