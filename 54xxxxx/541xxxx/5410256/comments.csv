,dnordic,2010-03-21T17:06Z,"The serial works but each time I turn it on, I have to enter the serial number. It seems to remember that I had a prior trial version which expired. I removed the trial version all together -add and remove, the program still remembers that I had a trial version.

Any fix for this?"
,qwop123,2010-05-19T02:26Z,"I wrote an AHK script to put the serial into the clipboard when the program asks for it.

Start:
SetTitleMatchMode 3
WinWait Beyond TV Trial - Trial Over
clipboard = a2cc6592-f034-4ee7-8e1d-0ede187a7859-a1d2bdc8
Goto, Start"

Exactly where do I paste in this script? 

Thanks!"
