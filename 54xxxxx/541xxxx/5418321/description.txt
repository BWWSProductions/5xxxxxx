Srila Prabhupada's complete teachings in a search-able database : Bhaktivedanta VedaBase 2003.01

This is the complete ISO. If you don't know, an ISO is an image of the CD. All you need to do is download it and then download a free program like ImgBurn from here:
 
http://download.cnet.com/ImgBurn/3000-2646_4-10847481.html 

After installing ImgBurn on your computer, get a blank CD or DVD and burn the database to the CD or DVD. Then you put the disk into your computer and do a complete install. Happy studying!

Then please do these two things:

1)Keep seeding this torrent. It is the most important torrent in the world. Distributing Prabhupada's teachings is the most valuable service. I only have intermittent web access so am depending on you to help with the distribution.

2)Please make a donation the The Bhaktivedanta Archives to assist them in their work of bringing us more of Srila Prabhupada's unreleased nectar.
