This is a light-hearted, funny and sweet comedy, finely balanced between farce and warm-hearted sentiments, entertaining though never silly or cheap. Do not expect a masterpiece, but a funny portrayal of the difficulties that the new doctor finds on arriving in a small town whose inhabitants, deeply rooted in tradition, are more easily reassured by potions and magical words than by medicine. As anyone can expect, watching Vittorio De Sica (in a well-rounded character who mixes cunning, charm and selfishness) and Mastroianni's opposing characters is a pleasure in itself. If you've enjoyed Ieri, Oggi e Domani or Peccato che sia una canaglia ("Too bad she's bad") you'll probably like Il medico e lo stregone.
