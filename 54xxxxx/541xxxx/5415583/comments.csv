,dabop,2010-03-08T00:38Z,"isn't the tracklisting supposed to be:

1.  home and somewhere else
2.  the loop
3.  burning stars
4.  new doomsdays
5.  subsonic words
6.  pixels
7.  remnants and pictures
8.  them
9.  cabin fever
10. 10 percent
11. under and in rocks"
,jwide,2010-03-17T08:57Z,dabop is right this is not the tracklisting or the finals from the album it seems. Does anyone have the album or have found it anywhere I have had zero luck
