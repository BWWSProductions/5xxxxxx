Low and behold the Baldur's Gate 1 Ultimate compilation.

--------------------------------------------------------

So I took BG1 and converted it into TUTU installation. What it does is, makes BG1 use the engine from BG2, which is more advanced and gives more gameplay options.

After that I've researched all the fixes and worthwhile mods that work 100% with TUTU version and compiled them in. I've kept it clean, as in, no hardcore mods or stuff that just plainly doesn't fit the world. The game holds true to the original, just being expanded and tweaked for the better.

I've included the G3 widescreen mod so you can enjoy BG1 greatness in your native screen resolution. Tested up to 1080pworking, no crashes.

The game is in English.

I followed the guide at Gibberlings3 to ensure I have 100% compatibility with all the mods.

How to use the release.

First unpack the game to your desired folder.

Browse to the game folder and edit "baldur.ini" file. 

Scroll to the following section and change the paths accordingly.


HD0:=e:bgtutu		#This is main installation folder


Now run the BGConfig.exe and configure the game according to your system specs.
Computers dating from year 1999 and on should handle the game on highest settings.
The config tool will ask you to test video settings. Agree on that and depending 
on your settings you should see an RGB pattern. If the screen flickers during the test
then the game has issues with 3D acceleration. Ignore that for the moment and disable the acceleration.
Run the test again and now the flickering should be gone.

Now find "setup-widescreen.exe" file and run it. Using this we will setup the game engine to display in your native resolution.
Not doing so, unless you own a crt monitor, will result in "muddy" graphics.

Let's get thru the widescreen config. You'll be presented with several options to choose from, as follows.

--------------------------------------------------------

Voila, now just open up "baldur.ini" file and find the following value

3D Acceleration=

Turn it on by adding 1 on the end. Save the file and you are ready to enjoy the game now.

Run it and see if the menus flicker. If they do there are several methods of dealing with it.
First is to disable 3D acceleration. This will take out some eye candy and make some stuff look ugly.
Second thing you might try is to turn on antialiasing. This have helped some people.
Third you might want to try different driver versions for your graphics card.
