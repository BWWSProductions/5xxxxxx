I'll keep the torrent seeded for a long time. Though, I'd appreciate if anyone capable would seed it it as well.

Don't let this awesome game die! :D "
,veldi,2010-03-08T17:30Z,"C'mon noone seeding ?

This is pathetic. I'll stop soon if noone else seeds this."
,zooka,2010-03-29T12:06Z,"Nice release but I can't get it to work.
It says ""Place expansion disk in disc in G:"" when i start Baldur.exe."
,barria,2010-04-06T23:21Z,"To solve the no CD problem, download just the throne of ball CD from this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3927084/Baldurs_Gate_2___Expansion__amp__Patches

Mount, then adjust your baldurs.ini entry for CD 5 to be: :\CD5

Should work then."

,Haawkings,2010-05-31T01:58Z,"Well its a nice dl and all apart from not telling you need BG2 to play it, and duno if it's just me but I'm getting ""There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive \device\Harddisk1\DR1"" when running the widescreen setup. Otherwise this is me revealing my expertise.

( ? ) wut do I do"
,PracticeMakesPerfect,2010-06-06T15:14Z,"You actually need BG2 to play this, right?"
,coyotyl,2010-07-09T08:29Z,Oh...need BG2 huh? Is that why I get ; An Assertion failed in ChDimm.cpp at line number 834 ? Well I`ll try that next. Thnx for the effort uploader. I`ll seed weather I get it going or not. I`ll be a geek someday! Right now I`m just a wannabe.
,coyotyl,2010-07-09T09:08Z,Nope. Same error.

,deckra,2010-12-24T18:21Z,I'll seed it for a few weeks.
,deckra,2010-12-24T18:31Z,"even though i'm seeding it, i get a -1 error message whenever i try to run the application, and then a ""An Assertion failed in ChDimm.cpp at line number 834"" error message after i press okay on the -1."
,Valamyr82,2011-01-19T17:38Z,"rafaelpicc:

Its all in there, the mods I mean. The WEIDU installers are all there too so the player can mix and match the components if he doesnt like something. The author of the torrent hasnt installed all components from every mod, but I went through the installers and the default components installed makes sense."
,Alsn,2011-01-21T19:19Z,"Awesome torrent, although I already own bg1 and bg2 this torrent saved me several hours of sifting through mods and getting everything to work. 

Recommended download!"
,Valamyr82,2011-01-22T00:52Z,"I echo Alsn's opinion. I was hesitant at first at playing such an heavily modded game without choosing and knowing the mods, but I just reached chapter 4 and everythings been going great! Lots of little surprises in the forms of unexpected new quests/encounters/etc and yet nothing really unbalanced. Only thing thats a bit hard are some of SCS components (namely, pre-buffed mages at low levels when you dont have Breach or See Invis, as well as super-webbing Spiders... Those have been a bitch). 

Definitely recommend this anyhow. And if you feel particular SCS components are a problem, you can still just run the SCS installer and disable them, so its not a huge deal. "
,kellyeddy,2011-03-21T20:17Z,"I'd like to help seed this, but I'm confused !!!!  The comments seem to imply I need to install BG2 also, right?  Please clarify!"
,kellyeddy,2011-03-23T16:28Z,"It works!  I didn't need bg2, but just the bg2 expansion CD.  On vista, using xp3 compatibility mode.  Ran the setup-widescreen exe, it updated some stuff then crashed.  However the game started after a few attempts.  I changed to 640-480, way faster.  It occasionally ran slow, but somehow fixed itself, and now runs perfectly.

It said zero seeders this morning, but Utorrent saw 5.  Give it a shot!"
,barria,2011-04-08T02:42Z,"Thanks veldi, works great.
I own all of the BG games, but this is so much easier then installing from the CDs

Thanks for your work!"
,afro34,2011-04-11T22:53Z,"Okay, so I downloaded this and installed everything.  For the most part, it runs pretty good.  However, when I try and go to Nashkel, it slows to a crawl and occasionally stalls out.  Does anybody else have this problem?  Anybody know a solution for it?  I'm gonna be honest, I'm pretty new to this so I'm gonna need the stupid explanation.  ;)"
,veldi,2011-06-07T16:53Z,"Afro, what are your computer specs?"
,elessarGObonzo,2011-06-20T08:32Z,so why havent you included the BG2 expansion to make/let it work? or at least state you're gonna need it to even fucking run.
,Melissia,2011-06-29T17:21Z,"Getting the same bug as the others.  

First popup says ""-1"", second says ""An Assertion failed in ChDimm.cpp at line number 834""."
,Gazzabaw,2011-07-02T04:33Z,If someone could seed this it would be greatly appreciated!
,oakward,2011-08-05T17:44Z,"This works PERFECTLY, if you follow some basic steps:
1) in baldurs.ini, set the correct path to your cd-rom (with the bg2 expansion cd,) & game.

Mine's like this:
HD0:=c:\bgtutu\
HD1:=c:\bgtutu\
CD1:=h:\bg2\CD1\
CD2:=h:\bg2\CD2\
CD3:=h:\bg2\CD3\
CD4:=h:\bg2\CD4\
CD5:=h:\CD5\  

2) Open BGConfig.exe, go to sounds, & turn OFF ""all ambient sounds.""  Some zones, especially Naskel, slow down/freeze with this on.

That's all!  Enjoy.  I'm using windows 7 & it works awesome."
,oakward,2011-08-05T17:48Z,"To be more specific, in BGConfig.exe > audio, check ""Disable all ambient sounds.""  I did this, & the game went from slow to FULL SPEED.  My system is 3ghz, huge graphics card, etc."
,per_automatik,2011-10-14T12:58Z,"this worked perfect for me! running a pentium 2.0 ghz xp; by following installation instructions and mounted a copy of throne of baal. though i wonder, would i need to disable the widscreen mod to make the game run in window mode?"
,necrotelecomnicon,2011-10-23T11:28Z,"For some reason, I don't get to place proficiency/skill-points when creating a new character. Is this because of one of the mods, or is something wrong with the game?"

A tip, don scale beond 800x600, its nice to view it at that resolution. You wont see much action and details in higher res...

,Acaste,2012-01-30T20:45Z,"I've never seen more perfect BG torrent. Thank you!

Sorry to sound like a complete noob, but I am close to idiot, when it comes to creating paths, so for those who would struggle:
It worked flawflessly, when 
1. G: (or any virtual disk you choose) - BG2 CD (BG2_CD1) with ""full"" installation,
---with ""recommended"" BG1 tended to crash on me

2. C: (E: in my case) - unzipped bgtutu into a folder (I created folder BG1 for it)

3. before you create the paths, make sure you know how many discs your BG2 has

4. the paths in .ini did not work for me when I kept their form, so, I changed it to:
HD0:=e:\data\BG1\bgtutu\
HD1:=e:\data\BG1\bgtutu\
CD1:=g:\BG2_CD1\
CD2:=g:\BG2_CD1\CD2\
CD3:=g:\BG2_CD1\CD3\
CD4:=g:\BG2_CD1\CD4\
(CDs 2-4 are on the Disc 1, so it is essential to include it) 

5. I initially thought I could use the folder where the second game is installed, thus CD2 would look like this: CD2:=e:\Data\BG2\CD2\
but I always got error message. 
My only solution was to use the drive."
,Acaste,2012-01-30T20:47Z,"As for the 0 slots problem mentioned when creating new character, it's not bug at all (I believe it is Learn by Use mod?) - you gain proficiency as you use your weapon."

5. After this, install widwscreen mod if needed."
,theonlycowboy2020,2012-01-31T14:07Z,"The guide 
Requirements

You must already have performed a FULL installation of the English language version of Baldur's Gate (and optionally, its expansion, Tales of the Sword Coast).  If you are using Baldur's Gate: The Original Saga, the expansion is already included without having to be installed separately.  Please note that for a truly complete installation (which is required), you will have to opt for a ""custom"" setup in order to select every possible optional component.
You must already have installed the English language version of Baldur's Gate 2.  A full install is recommended.
There are two different versions of EasyTutu: one for those who have installed the Baldur's Gate 2 expansion, Throne of Bhaal, and one for those who have not.  Please make sure you download the correct one (the non-expansion version should have ""SoA"" at the end of its name, and the Throne of Bhaal version should have ""ToB"" at the end of its name).
Your Baldur's Gate 2 installation must already have the latest patch installed. For those without Throne of Bhaal, that is Shadows of Amn patch 23037. For those with Throne of Bhaal, it is ToB patch 26498.
You will need roughly 3 GB of available disk space to install EasyTutu, or roughly 1.1 GB of disk space if you opt for the ""space saver"" option which consumes your Baldur's Gate installation.  If you opt for the normal installation in which your Baldur's Gate installation is untouched, please note that you can later reclaim much of your 3 GB disk space investment by uninstalling Baldur's Gate.
Notes

If you remember to customize your Baldur's Gate 2 options prior to installing EasyTutu (by running the ""BGConfig"" program and by setting the in-game options the way you like them), your Tutu installation will inherit these preferences automatically, without your having to set them all again.
If you are interested in some of the tweaks available in Tutufix, make sure to use Tutufix v17 or better. Beginning with that release, Tutufix has been programmed to recognize EasyTutu and to offer compatible choices only.
You are free to uninstall Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2 after the EasyTutu setup completes successfully. This distribution of Tutu does NOT depend upon either game being present on your hard drive after setup is complete.
If you opt for a normal installation, the EasyTutu setup program makes absolutely no changes to your Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2 installations.  They will continue to function exactly as they did prior to installing EasyTutu.  If you opt for a ""space saver"" installation, your Baldur's Gate installation will be consumed by the EasyTutu installer during the setup process.
If you opt for a ""space saver"" installation but wish to suppress the uninstallation of the remnants of your Baldur's Gate installation, simply rename the Uninst.isu file in your Baldur's Gate folder prior to running the EasyTutu setup program.
EasyTutu does not copy over custom portraits from your Baldur's Gate 2 installation.  If you wish to have your BG2 custom portraits available in EasyTutu, you must copy them from BG2's ""portraits"" subfolder to EasyTutu's ""portraits"" subfolder."
