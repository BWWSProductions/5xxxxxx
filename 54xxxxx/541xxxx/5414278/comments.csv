Unfortunately there are no seeds for ISO/Level 1 at the moment, much like all of the others. I will update my comments if, and when, the seeds are there. I will of course seed as well."
,BeautifulSeas,2010-03-08T07:12Z,"I finally managed to get the remaining seed. It works like a dream. Finally a full working Greek Rosetta Stone. Thanks, so much."

,Kyle_Rector,2010-03-08T17:30Z,"I don't think the guy plagiarizes anything.  If anything, he provides a great package of language software.  Where is your greek package?  There are many of use who have been asking for V3 Greek for a long time and he is the first to come through.  Thank you for your great work.

Some people just haven't learned to say 'thank you'.  "

ANY QUESTIONS???"
,quilleran,2010-03-25T01:28Z,"This is GREAT!  I've been looking all around for version 3 Greek and finally someone puts all of the pieces together into one package.  Thank you.

I've been finding bits of this scattered around the net by about four different posters and found some of it missing.  Now I see some fool is commenting claiming original rights to what others have done, or fixed.  This guy VasiaZozulia seems strung a bit tight.

I'm also looking for the complete Polish package if someone can help.

Keep up the good work."

"
,Twinkies,2010-07-04T20:29Z,I have to agree with the other comments. I have downloaded other torrents who claimed to be Greek for RS V3 and their were either incomplete or were actually V2. Am hoping this one will work! Will leave feedback later!
,Twinkies,2010-07-05T03:01Z,AWESOME! It works perfectly!!!!!!! Thx!!!
,chile123,2010-12-18T01:12Z,"can anyone help with activation?  i have the language packages installed, but it is asking for activation key"
,djh101,2011-05-19T09:47Z,I'm getting a 9114 error. Any suggestions?
,ratnikBG,2011-06-21T17:33Z,"hi. i downloaded torrent but i have nothing, just folder with 4 other folders and i cant see pics, videos or sound. What Should i do???"
,matthek1,2012-01-07T12:23Z,hi
,matthek1,2012-01-07T12:25Z,"Ok, you can download another torrent for this but I don't think PirateBay will let me include the link. Let's try this again:

If you are looking for a crack for the language pack activation, I found one on PickTorrent called Rosetta Stone v3.4.5 Crack Only -- if you put those terms into Google it should work.

THIS IS ONLY THE CRACK, you need to download and install Rosetta Stone v3.4.5 first from a separate torrent.

The Readme is fairly vague (for Mac especially), so here's what to do. I only have a Mac so I can't help you Windows folk, but it's probably the file in like Program Files > Rosetta Stone folder. Don't worry, it worked for me after I had updated Rosetta and ran it once to discover the 'language locked' problem.

IF YOU HAVE OSX Lion:
Open the folder called Mac in the torrent, control+click (or right click) and select ""Copy mdm.dat""
Open Finder, click on Applications Folder
Scroll to Rosetta Stone V3
Control+Click (or right click) and go to Show Package Contents
Click the Contents folder
Resources Folder
control+click on a blank spot in that folder, click ""paste item""

When it asks to replace or keep both, say replace.

Open Rosetta Stone and it should not be asking for any language activation. Voila! Enjoy. :)"
,threefour,2012-02-10T03:48Z,"I have downloaded this as well as the crack and I have followed matthek1's instructions but when I get to step 4 (Control+Click (or right click) and go to Show Package Contents) when I control click only the levels 1, 2 and 3 folders come up.  Any advice?  

Also, I just dragged the RS V3 Greek folder to the applications.  Was there something else I was supposed to do?"
,Juggler3,2012-06-04T14:36Z,"Hi guys - 

Advance warning - I'm a fairly computer illiterate girl! 

I have downloaded this and also a Crack (Rosetta Stone 3.4.7) onto my MAC (important?) but nothing is working at all - the ISO Disk Image folders are there but they don't open, they don't even seem to open in windows (but I can try again if you insist) and the only part that works is the audio which plays in iTunes but only 1-2 minutes clips with random greek words etc. I realise that the audio is supposed to be used in conjunction with software. 

Can someone please tell me what I could be doing wrong? Step by step and clear answers please? :( 

Thanks so much x"
,SergioFCPorto,2012-06-19T20:27Z,thanks
,GreekJay,2012-06-29T07:03Z,I'm having a problem installing greek. I'm getting error 9114 There was an error installing the language files. Please try again or contact Customer Support. I have installed Spanish and Portuguese with no problem. I am using Poweriso. Anybody have any ideas how I can fix this?
