The Magician's Journey to "New Magic"


It begins with the â€œhigh groundâ€ and then a return to our personal â€œbattlefield.â€ We return not to battle again, but to collect energy -- gifts and treasures -- that were lost there. We can move onward to the gateways of healing, finding, and facing. We can go further to the Cauldron of Magic. Lazaris briefly reviews the components of the New Magic. This excerpt is a wonderful reminder and a fun way to remember.

Unlocking the Power and Beauty of Greater Understanding: 

During the discussion, Lazaris laid the foundation of rapport, with its resistance â€¦ relationship, with listening to the voices of understanding â€¦ and alliance, with its sense of revelation. When we create an alliance with understanding we can take that next step: we can unlock the power and beauty of even greater understanding. And beyond understanding? Freedom. Celebration. In illuminating understanding, Lazaris lays out a precise map: We own our resistance and open to forgiveness. We awaken compassion and enter the Magic of Compassion. Then we wake uncertainty: knowing with certainty and knowing without certainty. As the journey continues, we open to hearing, beyond listening, the voices of understanding. And finally, we own our new Mantle of Understanding. This powerful recording concludes with a powerful and beautiful meditation.
