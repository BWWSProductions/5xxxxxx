,himabhima,2010-03-15T19:47Z,"how do I use HAMACHI plz, when i get into Total war online i find only one locked battle,

,himabhima,2010-03-15T19:49Z,my friends don't play this so????
,tibrusjer,2010-03-18T19:22Z,Getting kicked by VAC authentication all the time.
,Stumpertje,2010-04-04T16:21Z,"how does it work? I did everythind but now it says:
""Game currently not avaible, try again later"""
,Rohan151,2010-04-05T19:28Z,"It's not working for me. The game launches, gets to the first loading screen, the cursor changes to the Napoleon cursor, and then I'm back at the desktop with a crash."
,Mojito_619,2010-04-21T17:09Z,"Uh, when I try to play with my brother over hamachi, we get Game Version Differs From Host. Any1 got a workaround?"
,jalilz29,2011-01-13T22:04Z,"@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
VERY IMPORTANT:
i did everything according to these instructions but when i enter the game from steam a crash happens and the game is exit, but i fixed it by going to C->program files->steam->steamapps->common->empire total war and renaming the file on the top from Empire to data


note: to know how to use hamachi go to this link (youtube) watch?feature=iv&v=wKRtOSWuFgo&annotation_id=annotation_351563"

,Fusha,2011-03-30T20:02Z,"Couldn't get this to work. Steam just starts updating the game, ruining the crack and making it crash on startup."
