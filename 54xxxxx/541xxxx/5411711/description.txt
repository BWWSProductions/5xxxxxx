I recorded this music in 1978 on an old tape recorder while I played a rented piano. I was in an old barn in the middle of a lemon orchard, at the foot of San Marcos Pass in Santa Barbara. The orchard has long since been sold to a developer and turned into mini estates.

This was the first long session I ever recorded, and maybe it will be my last. It was challenging and fun. I'm not a professional musician: I'm an accountant and a family man. But this is a part of me and I made this package to share this part with my friends and family.
