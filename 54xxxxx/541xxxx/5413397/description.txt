Release Notes:

London-based trio We Have Band's debut album 'WHB' will be released
through French label Na?ve (Marianne Faithful, Carla Bruni, Seu Jorge).

The record will come out on 5th April, preceded by single 'Divisive' on
22nd March, and was recorded throughout 2009 with producer Gareth
Jones.

"The singles are poppy, danceable and catchy but there's another side
to us," comments Thomas (Vocals/Guitar/Bass/Programming).

"We like a lot of darker music. Joy Division, early OMD, and Talking
Heads are some of the things that inspire us," adds Darren
(Vocals/Drums/Percussion/Sampler). "The three of us have lots of
different influences and they've all come out on 'WHB'."
