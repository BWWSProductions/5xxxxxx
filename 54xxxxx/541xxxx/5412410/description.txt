 

Two and a half decades is a hell of a long time for a band to remain together, and Third World is one of the few to reach that quarter-century landmark intact. To celebrate, they re-recorded some of their best tunes, wrote a new one, and released the results on the plainly titled 25th Anniversary. Fans who know these songs, "96 Degrees in the Shade," the Stevie Wonder-penned "Try Jah Love," their hit cover of "Now That We Found Love," and "Sense of Purpose," will find the new recordings interesting, but will pine to hear the originals. "Jamaica," the new track written for this release, is a solid if light tribute to the band's homeland. They also recorded a new cover song, Neil Diamond's "Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon," and, as part of the special-edition package, included three remixes as well. ~ Wade Kergan
