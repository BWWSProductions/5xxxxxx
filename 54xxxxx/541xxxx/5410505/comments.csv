""My passion and calling is in public health. I?ve worked for 20 years in public health practice and research at the ?street? level, in mid- and upper-level management positions at the county, regional and state levels. My research and interests include communicable disease epidemiology; infection control; the social, political and environmental determinants of health; and public policymaking.

,Tainan,2010-03-05T00:59Z,"JWhitt62 - Thank You for your work each day.

Looks like exposing the nut-cases keeps them away.
Something I find troubling, looking at that address - ""US Veterans Hospital Road"" - is that she might have contact with US Veterans in a hospital/medical care surrounding. I shudder to think of what she might be led to do given her proclivity to sick liberal politics.

In a word:

""Shut Up Maria!"""
,fizdude,2010-03-05T02:05Z,"Love your work jwhitt62, thank you!!"
,protongeek,2010-03-05T04:48Z,Thanks Jwhitt! Yes Maria is one fucked up bitch.
,protongeek,2010-03-05T04:59Z,She must hate the fact shes an assistant professor.
,BarrySoetoro,2010-03-05T10:34Z,"I have a 20 year old baseball glove that looks just like her.

She's just your typical self-righteous control freak leftist; technically intelligent, yet socially retarded and easily influenced by the machine. She needs to read some basic history and perhaps ask herself ""How much does freedom mean to me?""

I'm from the UK... you don't want to go down this road, trust me. There's nothing but a big stinking pile of sistromoo at the end of it.

Thanks, Jwhitt!"

,TedKennedy,2010-03-05T15:15Z,"?Technically intelligent?? I doubt it I am a dental student (insert joke about how I didn?t get into med school here, but honestly I chose dentistry) and I will tell you that many people who are stupid skate along and get the grades and the glory because they identify with the professors and the liberal university view of the world (which is the most perverted and illogical interpretation of the facts I have ever experienced). This woman has succeeded most likely because she is limousine liberal, and because the liberals who have taken over the education in this country love to see their kind succeed."
,thunderbum,2010-03-05T20:49Z,"""Perviously...""...in a cage with a putbull"""" ?

Here is the dictionary definition of 'pervious':

?adjective
1.
admitting of passage or entrance; permeable: pervious soil.
2.
open or accessible to reason, feeling, argument, etc.
Now neither of these definitions fit the sentence or what twatdaddy is trying to say. Logic obviously isn't his forte - or syntax. 

Poor delusional soul. There are meds that can help you with your mental illness. But then again if you were to take your meds on time, then you wouldn't be typing such tripe here and we wouldn't been able to get our daily laugh from you. And that's the best part! The more you try to make sense, the less you make. And the more you insist on how clever you are, we see right through that insecurity. 

Liberalism really is a form of mental illness. We see that with the TOTUS. Carry on..."

,booboo332,2010-03-06T02:49Z,"Considering how sloppy and illegible Little Trick's posts are, his critique of someone else's grammar is laughable.

I guess that happens when someone spends too much time reading Alinsky instead of Strunk and White."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-06T03:47Z,Its easy to make statements but to actually write something with substance is hard...This is why I call this guy bugaboo because he just made a statement without any supporting facts...At least Dumbo Limbaugh pulls some facts out of his ass to make a point but this bimbo didnt even try...END
,booboo332,2010-03-06T04:07Z,"The quality (or lack thereof) of your posts speak for themselves, Tricky.

If you didn't get the joke of my comment, you have only your own uptight bitterness to blame.  I will give you one thing, however.  You don't have to read ""Rules For Radicals"" to be a pawn of those who do.

Thanks for the laughs."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-06T04:57Z,You're making jokes and I'm stating facts...Just validates my point...You've said nothing...END 
,booboo332,2010-03-06T05:31Z,"It would seem that you have trouble distinguishing between fact and self indulgent opinions.

My main point that you make barely readable and ungrammatical posts while criticizing others is blatantly apparent.

Are you so full of yourself that you can't see what an ass you make of yourself?  You don't engage in serious debate but come of as an immature ass with your ""points"" and insults.

Even Kanye would be embarrassed for you."
,BarrySoetoro,2010-03-06T06:29Z,"Lol, by ""intelligent"" I mean not an illiterate bum. I'm talking about average intelligence, here...

Believe me, I know it doesn't take a genius to get brainwashed by angry professors and regurgitate hate onto paper for a grade. That's why I said ""technically"" intelligent.

Anyone who knows HTML, CSS, Java, C++ had to go through 10 times the mental rigor than a damn RN."
,booboo332,2010-03-06T06:50Z,Truly.  I had a roommate who has an IQ of around 170 and a PhD in computer science and he is one of the most foolish and deluded people I have ever met.
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-06T14:16Z,"Ok let me start over because I know it takes some people longer to get stuff than others...I get that...When every you make a statement or opinion...The opinion does not change until you back up those statement with empirical evidence...At that moment than it becomes a factual statement because you have provided proof for your argument...For example suppose I said that Limbaugh was trying to keep America dumb...Then I would point out that Rush disliked school and hated college...And constantly beat it into your brain that college professors are a bunch of dumb liberals who had an agenda and would never tell you the truth...Then a 17 year old fresh out of high school may says,""the hell with college""...""I will follow my dreams and make it like Rush did""...But sadly without some of the insights or critical thinking skills you develop in college those dreams of making it big never materialize...Then you wake one morning around noon and hear that illegal aliens are taking away jobs, taxes are too high, and that Obama has stolen money your grandkids...Then you end up in some town hall meeting for Health Care Reform and get up screaming,""I WANT MY COUNTRY BACK!!!""...END

,booboo332,2010-03-06T19:46Z,"In all the time I have listened to Rush's show, many young people have called in to talk about their intent to go or their experiences in higher education and I have never once heard him encourage them to not to go or drop out.  In fact, it was while listening to Rush and Neal Boortz (more specifically Neal because he strongly advocates getting a good education) that I decided to go back to college myself.

Sure Rush cautions them about the strong philosophical convictions of many professors and students they will encounter in college but never once have I heard him actually dissuade someone from pursuing a degree.  In fact, he actively promotes a liberal arts college (Hillsdale) on his show.  The school, the professors and student body undoubtably has a strong tendency towards a particular set of philosophies as well, but would not be a surprise to anyone who went.  The school also receives no government funding.

I agree that getting a degree or training in a trade is extremely important but it can be nearly impossible to avoid highly political professors depending on your program.  I will concede however that when public schools employed religious indoctrination, many conservatives were no better on this count.

Though oversimplified, I cannot dismiss everything you have asserted.  Unfortunately you still did it in such a condescending manner that you might of as well have said nothing."
,thunderbum,2010-03-07T09:27Z,"@booboo: you're trying to be logical with someone who doesn't have two firing synapses. Trickydick's idea of conversation is to indulge in belittlement and having a foul mouth. Then he awards himself some kind of brownie points based on some ephemeral criteria that exists only in his fevered brain.

Ya can't reason with the unreasonable. In fact I'd go as far as to state that my dog's shit is more intelligent than that dolt could ever hope to be.

He does provide my daily giggle though; and to me he typifies the quintessential Obama voter."
,trickdaddy0024,2010-03-07T16:37Z,""" In fact, it was while listening to Rush and Neal Boortz (more specifically Neal because he strongly advocates getting a good education) that I decided to go back to college myself."" -babyboo Its funny how you mentioned Neal Boortz while he never entered in my discussion...Anyway, the reason you mentioned Neal is because Rush never advocates actually going to college and Neal did but this is water under a bridge...My argument is that Rush is committed in the dumbing  down of Americans...I listen to Rush almost everyday and I understand what he is trying to do but he is so wrong on many things but right on others...Why constantly bash professors? Everyone has freedom of thought and can make up their own minds despite what any professor might say...Could Rush diss professors and then advocate going to college...No this doesn't make any sense...Rush never tells his audience not to goto college but he does explain how he hated it and his parent thought he would be a failure...Then in the next breath he goes into a commercials...Asking you to try carbonite to backup you computer but if you learn how to backup your own computer for free than who needs carbonite?...Rush Limbaugh is only looking out for himself and his contributors (Big Business)...The middle class could disappear and he could careless...Now, If you downloaded Friday's show you would have heard from Rush say that Obama is managing the destruction of America...How many people without a college degree understood that to be false?...How many people calls his show everyday scared of what Obama will do next because of what Limbaugh says...On another note...How many Red Light cameras are in your neighborhood looking to profit on the backs of Americans in this Depression?...I just throw that one out there...But why cant Americans get decent Health Care when the country is in so much financial trouble?...END"
,booboo332,2010-03-07T18:38Z,"littletrick, you respond in the precisely the narrow minded, barely coherent way I expected you to.  Apparently, your reading comprehension is as poor as your written expression.

You are living proof that people see what they project onto the world rather than what is there."

,booboo332,2010-03-08T05:47Z,"BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Oh little trick you are so predictable.  You ignore logic and the proof you huffily demand when it is given and declare yourself victorious when someone refuses to play your silly little games the way you want them to.

You talk about holding your head high out of pride but it is only so you can look down on others.  And that makes you small indeed.

You go ahead and claim your little points of narcissistic delusion, little man, my victories are in highlighting your hilarious absurdity and goading you into showing what a hateful and ignorant twit you are.

Never the....END"
