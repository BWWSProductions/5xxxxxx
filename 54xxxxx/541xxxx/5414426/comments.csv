Where do you leave request for a movie on this website? You seem proactive you may know. I NEED ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" for a couple of kids and I cannot find it. I've looked on other websites and none of the movies I download there play. I'm trying to burn the movie to a DVD so they can play it on thier DVD player. I seem to have the best results off TPB. 
Thank you."
