* About

Cue is a four-piece progressive instrumental/chamber noise rock band from Austin, TX. The Houston Press has described the music as â€a melodic and dramatic violin/piano/guitar/bass/drum sound that often crests into mountains of orchestrated assault.â€

Cue began as a two-piece between guitarist/bassist/keyboardist Clarke Dominick and drummer Jason Brister. In 2000, 
guitarist Colin Swietek, part of the San Marcos indie scene and occasional member of electro-rock group The Octopus Project (Peekaboo), moved to Austin, slept under the ping-pong table in Clarke and Jasonâ€™s garage, and started playing music with them. 
The trio released â€œKeep Busyâ€, their first full-length album, in 2001. Later that year violinist Stacy Meshbane, formerly of The Tunahelpers (Mimicry) joined the band. 
In April 2005, the band released â€œBring Back My Loveâ€, their debut album as a four-piece. Cueâ€™s album and live performances have received positive reviews by the likes of Delusions of Adequacy, Tiny Mixtapes, The Village Voice, Pop Culture Press, The Austin Chronicle, The Dallas Observer, The Austin American Statesman, The Metro Pulse (Knoxville, TN), The Charlotte Observer, and more.
