,ninline,2010-03-20T03:22Z,Not to be mean but if you need help with this then you really aren't the type person that needs to be using it.
,doggywuff,2010-03-27T16:01Z,"OK noobs here it is a super simpl guide
1. download torrent
2. download active iso burner, nero, other cd burning software
3. burn iso image onto cd
4. reboot computer from cd
5. follow instructions the webchella has given you

also it would be nice if he listed a list of all the wireless cards and/or laptops this is compatible with"

,some-young-guy,2011-02-07T11:01Z,"type commview in your browser for a list of compatible wifi cards.  Mine isn't on the list so I had to pick up an Alfa http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=alfa+wifi&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&cid=4220336969504803872&ei=bsJPTZTzNtC_gQfQlKwc&sa=X&oi=product_catalog_result&ct=image&resnum=4&ved=0CD0Q8gIwAw# and it worked like a charm.  I did the Backtrack 4 and successfully cracked a few, but then was no longer able to.  I will try this as an option to see if I get any more luck."
