Let's Play The Legend of Kyrandia 2 : Hand of Fate

Total length: 3h 51m 38s

Made at the same time as Westwood made Lands of Lore, Hand of Fate is a wonderful little point and click adventure game, the second in a series, that I feel shares much of the magic that Lands of Lore did. Can Zanthia save the lands from fate...
