,jon4fun,2010-03-07T03:18Z,"@ALL downloaders of this torrent:

Manners people. 'Please' and 'thank you' cost nothing and mean a lot.

Of all the shows to download and not say thanks. Sometimes the human condition baffles me.

Next week this MIGHT not be here and then what... you'll come begging and pleading and wondering. And if you had only said 'Thanks 20-40'?????

You know who you are!"
