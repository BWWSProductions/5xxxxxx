
MAJESTY formed in early 2009 with a group of friends who had been playing seperate instruments since their youth. They released their debut EP titled Shadows, a three track demo which is available to download for free to the public. The EP was tracked in Guelph, Ontario with Jordan Valeriote at Sundown Studio. After small breaks and interruptions with the bands line up, MAJESTY is now writing their full length album, a year after the formation of the band. Based out of a small area in Georgetown, Ontario, MAJESTY has just begun to play shows in cities such as Toronto along with local shows.
