,squiikii,2010-03-08T11:35Z,"This whole thing with the free arc was a pain. Windows 7 users, or anyone else probably. Upon download, install the free arc. Then using winrar or whatever you had to open it in the first place, extract the arc file onto desktop. Then, right click and hit ""open with"", and browse for FreeArc in progam files. The app is located in the ""bin"" folder of the freearc folder. Then at the top of the window that opens from free arc- just hit extract (looks like the ""play"" button), dont go into it any further. Too bad when I go to play it I get an error. Oh well."
,squiikii,2010-03-08T11:39Z,"@ Lanido, many virus scanners cause false positives, since the crack usually injects a code. I scanned with a different virus scanner, it's a clean file. I've never gotten a virus from anything here."
,nighthel,2010-03-11T16:37Z,the torrent works .no need to extract on desktop.the game runs on win 7 x32
,Geekin,2010-03-12T03:25Z,"Good news, The game supplied works,but its very very buggy. Bad news there is an infection, perhaps malware or spyware hidden somewhere within this torrent that NOD32 or Superantispyware couldn't find. Perhaps in the ARC software? After installing about an hour into the game I got a pop up, like a windows error, saying something close to ""Press cancel to open your browser blah blah"" definably a phishing type window. My PC was clean before installing this and take my word that it wasn't a previous infection. I wouldn't suggest downloading this. 
  I was hoping this torrent would fix the graphics problems I was having thinking it was just a bad upload. Turns out the previous torrents I used were good I just had to turn on Aestheticizing to fix the problem. I turned it on through my cards control panel and in game options and it worked. Hope this helps.
