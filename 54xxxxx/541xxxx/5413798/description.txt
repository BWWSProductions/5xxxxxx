    MONyog MySQL Monitor and Advisor is a "MySQL DBA in a box" that       
    helps MySQL DBAs manage more MySQL servers, tune their current        
    MySQL servers and find and fix problems with their MySQL database     
    applications before they can become serious problems or costly        
    outages.                                                              
                                                                          
    MONyog pro-actively monitors enterprise database environments and     
    provides expert advice on how even those new to MySQL can tighten     
    security, optimize performance and reduce downtime of their MySQL     
    powered systems.                                                      
                                                                          
    As a MONyog user you will know in advance if server resources will    
    soon be running short. You can plan a hardware replacement or         
    upgrade in comfortable time and not when it is almost too late (or    
    just plain too late!). And the metrics about the server that          
    MONyog gives you will help to decide what to upgrade: Faster CPU,     
    More RAM, Faster disc systems - or maybe only remove another          
    program from the computer where the MySQL server is running.          
                                                                          
    MONyog provides a log analysis module, a "query sniffer" and a        
    "processlist watcher" that makes it easy to identify the              
    statements and applications that run slow on the server. This         
    includes various filtering and EXPLAIN options for an efficient       
    workflow when you want to optimize your applications.                 
                                                                          
    To use the MONyog mail alert functionality to mail you alerts         
    about a MySQL server you will first need to select that feature       
    when registering a server. You can choose to receive mails, not       
    only when there are problems but also to notify that the system is    
    running smoothly at regular intervals. Further, you can set the       
    minimum time interval between mails sent by MONyog to suit your       
    needs and to avoid cluttering your mailbox. For every MySQL server    
    choose a setting depending on how important the performance of        
    this particular server is.
