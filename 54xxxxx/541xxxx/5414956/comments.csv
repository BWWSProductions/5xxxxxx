- Greatly improved emergency VAC protection (kills the game if VAC detected while game is running)
[With warning message upon detection]
- Enforced 4096-bit encryption to further prevent detection
- Significantly reduced anti-virus false-positives 

Since many had problems getting the previous version to work, I've added avideo of a demonstration on how to get this work:"
