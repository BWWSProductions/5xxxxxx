ENVY follows the lives of 2 cousins trying to survive on the crime ridden, drug infested streets of Detroit. Alvin Clawson, 'AJ' (Ray J), grows up idolizing the lifestyle of his older cousin Charles Clawson, 'Caesar' (AZ), lives. AJ has always been lured to the streets despite his positive upbringing. As AJ gets older, he quickly finds himself playing a major role in Caesar's drug conglomerate. Caesar recognizes things are changing. Federal indictments, murders, snitches, and turncoats are rampant in this world. When Caesar's position is challenged a message has to be sent.
