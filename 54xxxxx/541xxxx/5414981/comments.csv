,Kalvinex,2010-03-09T14:09Z,"Hi Everyone,

This is my first comment ever posted on here so here goes : I thought that the movie was a little too dark , the person who filmed it obviously did not stabilize the camera properly, the sound quality was ok guess, besides all of that I can say that this file would have been better if the person who filmed it zoomed in more without loosing some of the image/picture and used a tripod at the very least. I give this file/movie a 6 out of 10 for the reasons I explained at the start of this message. I will be posting some files whenever i get a better plan with my ISP, however long that takes, just be really patient.

Thank You"
