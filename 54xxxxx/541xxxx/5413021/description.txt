This is something i got from the old Napster. (thanks to whoever put it up) It is a 40 minute show from the 1988 tour of Japan to promote the Jealousy EP. The quality of this is not perfect! It has been transfered from VHS at some point and is a little shakey occasionally. I would rate it a solid B for sound and picture. However i think this is quite rare. Some of the songs played don't get played too often so its worth the download fro that alone.
The files are .vob and should be burned to a DVD. I use Nero 8. Enjoy!
