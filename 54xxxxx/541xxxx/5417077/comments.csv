Crack for it"
,danny717,2010-03-18T02:07Z,Can't get to work!! Mount with magicISO but says unable to load image.  Win 7 if that matters.
,defiancy,2010-03-20T18:59Z,To get this torrent to work you need to use Daemon Tools so it can read the .mds file.
,kobe003,2010-03-21T00:55Z,"cant get this game to work, the wizard is saying cabinet file  nba2k10_2.cab is corrupted. can u upload the file but except that this torrnet is legit.Thx"
,Wolf362,2010-03-22T12:11Z,I downloaded the torrent when I click on setup.exe I get told not compatible with my version of windows I am running windows vista x64 any ideas?
,quwieo,2010-03-24T22:57Z,"note that the mds file does not mount properly w/ magiciso, but daemon tools works."
,quwieo,2010-03-25T01:18Z,"well, shit. daemon got me about halfway through the install, but now i'm stuck trying to get the second image to mount.  i get the message to insert the data disk, but nothing included in the torrent is recognized. suggestions?

i also noticed that i could open the *.i00 file in winrar, but trying to open the *.i01 file gave me an error saying the file format is not recognized or file is corrupted.  anyone else get this/know what to do??"
,seanmcintier,2010-04-11T18:38Z,"-1 for using odd file formats. 
You can either burn this to a DVD using your favorite program or convert it to an .ISO
"
,seanmcintier,2010-04-11T18:46Z,"You can mount the .mds with Alcohal120%

Neither IMGBurn nor PowerISO were able to.
Then just install from there, or rip an .ISO with whatever."
,ILoveSky,2010-04-28T23:57Z,"I want this game, but I'm not even going to bother trying this, based on the comments and it's quality rating."
,DaSteelerz,2010-05-02T22:21Z,Game works great... thanks.. this game loses huge value without the CD Key for using Living Rosters.. does anyone know of a CD Key or Username and pass that could be used? The old rosters without prospects and all is killing me...
,fredj333,2010-05-13T02:47Z,"I installed the game and everything but when I try to open it this message pops up

Conflict with Emulation Software detected.
Please have a look at http://www.securom.com/message.asp?m=emu&c=2500 for further, more detailed information.

Does anyone know what I can do to fix this?"
,zunaiedmufc,2010-05-14T08:28Z,"Guys just follow these steps.
After downloading the torrent,
1) Download and install ""daemon tools""
(you can delete it after the game is installed)
2) Mount the .mds file inside the downloaded torrent.
3) Install
3) Download the crack from

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5418727/Major_League_Baseball_2K10-RELOADED_Crack_Only

4) Copy paste the crack files into the main directory of the installed game. (in local disk>program files>2k Sports)

5) start game

Works PERFECTLY.
So shut up and follow the steps properly

and if anyones reading this, do u know where u can get a cd key for it?.
cuz without the key u cant acces mlb today.

OTHER THAN THAT, IT WORKS"
,Deputy276,2010-05-16T22:55Z,Another -1 from me for the same reason. Idiotic file method. Why not post an ISO so the rest of the world can burn it easily? Are you working for this weirdo file company or what? Do everyone a favor and rip it as an ISO and repost the torrent. This is crap. 
,Maddux91,2010-05-19T12:59Z,"Can someone please do me a favour and upload tutorial.iff, loc.iff and english.iff from the MLB2K10 folder, to somewhere..

Accidently overwrote them with the MLB2K9 crack, before I realised I had the wrong one."
,telesien,2010-05-27T14:16Z,What kind of control device do you use guys? Both my keyboard and gamepad Genius Blaze 3 don't work...
,yadayadaya,2010-06-05T20:54Z,"@people saying it does work with Windows 7 x64 and this is the x86 version, lol @ game manufactures making separate versions.  It works fine on Windows 7 x64 for me, so user error.  Follow the instructions EXACTLY ie use daemon tools and you will have no issue."
,yadayadaya,2010-06-05T20:55Z,"@telesien
I use an Xbox 360 wired controller.  Since it's made by Microsoft, the drivers are native in Windows, and 2K games recognize them as such and set them up the same as they are for their games on the 360."
,yadayadaya,2010-06-05T20:58Z,@seanmcintier and Deputy276 mds is not an odd file format.  And it isn't a new file format.  It's well known that Alcohol (application it is native to) and Daemon Tools can handle these files.  You are both idiots.  Where are your game uploads?  Ex-fucking-actly.
,lilazndood1,2010-06-09T01:58Z,Someone will need to patch MLB 2K10 for the torrent now that the patch has been released.
,yadayadaya,2010-06-22T03:49Z,"If you have a demonoid account, the crack and patch are on there.  If not, gamecopyworld has the exe crack and you can download the patch from 2k's website."
,hierox,2010-06-29T04:55Z,does anyone know why after a couple minutes in the game me left joy stick stops being used and gets assigned to POV D-Pad which i use a modded xbox controller. it ONLY DOES IT WITH THIS GAME. FIFA 10 works fine every other game i have the modded controller works perfectly fine.
,gdom77,2010-07-21T19:05Z,"CAN ANYBODY TYPE IN THE CRACK FOR ME IS NOT OPENING FROM THE LINK THAT WAS PROVIDED HERE SEND IT TO MY E-MAIL! I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK-YOU!

,UpInSmok,2010-12-17T08:18Z,"First off this IS a bad torrent. It installs fine it makes you think ""omg this is perfect!"" Than reality hits you play 2 to 3 innings and the game ends.. Im not saying the game shuts down the game that you were playing ends...I hit 1 homerun the 1st inning and it says that I won the game...I tried it on 3 different computers all running xp SP3. So obviously its a bad rip. I suggest not downloading, but the road isn't easy unless you pave it so good luck;) PEACCE"
,Demon_33,2010-12-24T22:33Z,run in win xp ??
,erikwidi,2011-01-31T19:13Z,"I HIGHLY suggest AGAINST downloading this torrent. I just received a cease-and-desist email from EA and Rogers, telling me to uninstall my illegally downloaded copy of MLB 2k10. IT'S BUGGED. DON'T DOWNLOAD."
,djc5581,2011-03-31T21:13Z,"-1 for it being tracked by EA as I too got a copyright infringement notice 2 days after downloading. Game works though, just be weary as your IP will be reported for downloading this.

You would think they would go after the cracks not the untouched game..."
,vishall,2011-06-09T04:34Z,BAD
,TyMod,2011-08-15T22:14Z,"First off, use peer block,  ALL TORRENTS ARE TRACKED.  Most people just don't get snagged. :)  Plus if you are using Comcast or AT&T ISP then you WILL get caught.  I got a friend who is with Comcast and he gets emails and letters all the time.  They won't do anything.  If you can get Time Warner Cable.  :)"
,TyMod,2011-08-15T22:15Z,"And this isn't a bad copy. It is a clone DVD for gods sake. Nothings been touched.  Its just your setting.  Why don't you look things up on goolg before posting bad comments.

Thanks thenoobish,

just gunna throw this out there, but its MLB 2K10, made by 2K sports, not EA. why your getting a cease and desist email from EA makes 0 sense. from your ISP yes but not from EA considering 2K and Sony are the only companys that make a baseball game. "
,CanDariaN,2011-09-10T06:18Z,Ya the EA comment made me laugh.
