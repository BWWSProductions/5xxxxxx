Alex welcomes back to the show Gerald Celente [hour 4], trend forecaster, publisher of The Trends Journal, business consultant and author who makes predictions about the global financial markets and other events of historical importance. In 2009, Celente predicted turmoil which he described as "Obamageddon" and believes the Tea Party movement and tax protests are harbingers of revolution.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
