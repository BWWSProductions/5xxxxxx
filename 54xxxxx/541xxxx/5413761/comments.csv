A(audio)=10
V(video)=10
M(movie)=2.5 (and that's being *nice*)

Honestly, I fell asleep twice trying to watch this, YES it was that boring! If you like zombie movies, regardless of how crumby the plot and acting is-- then give this stinker a chance, but I think I'll just mourn the hour and a half of my life that I wasted on this travesty."
