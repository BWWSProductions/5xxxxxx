write for example: 
bind p toggleconsole

set cheats on at main menu, go to single player and and press your bound key to open console"

,bioskooppi,2010-04-16T17:10Z,"oh, ok

do the bindinds and set cheats etc.. when you get to the console when the game starts (main menu)

don't start single player from the menu, but use the console to start playing your map of choice (console command: map +mapname)

Now when the game starts, you should be able to use the bound key to open the console 
(it also opens the in-game menu, but drag the console window to the side, so it won't block the menu). Just use Esc to go back to the game."

Ive heard alot about people getting on TPB making numerous account names and commenting on their own posts to make them look better than they are and im starting to believe it after this download. 

In no way shape or form do i believe that all the ppl in the comments are real and actually got this SHIT to work correctly.

,wisperin,2010-06-27T02:14Z,"So after screwing with this wonky install for hours i finally managed to copy around some files from one folder buried within the main install folder. 

If you have any trouble getting anything to work after the overly long absurd installer check the Rev folders in you main install location for the game. copy and replace as needed. 

As for Garena; has to be the biggest EPIC fail ive ever seen. id never recommend the service to anyone."

Now there is only one problem. I got these sound bursts. I read the ""readme"" file and it says that I have to open the console etc etc. Problem is, that I dont know how to open the console. It's not the right key that it says.

Can someone please help me with this?:) Would be great, thanks."

UAC stands for User Account Control.

In that window, there's a bar you can drag down to disable it, or up to enable it.  Make sure you re-enable it though lol"

,BADDD,2011-02-21T06:09Z,Works fine. If anyone is having the missing DLL problem go to C:\ and create a new folder named Games. When you extract Left 4 Dead 2 with 7ZIP extract it to that folder. The game will now correctly install itself and you will have the DLL as well as all other content. Have not played the game yet except for doing a test to see if it'll go and it went fine.
