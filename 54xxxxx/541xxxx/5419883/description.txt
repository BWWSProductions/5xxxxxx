Two days after the events of the first film Sarah is washed away to safety with no memory of the events of the last time she was in the cave. She is taken to a hospital where it is revealed some of the blood on her matches that of Juno Kaplan. Sheriff Vaines demands that along with his deputy Elen Rios, Sarah and three specialists -Dan, Greg and Cath- must go back into the cave to find the missing girls. A new entrance is found with the help of a sniffer dog. The girls are sent down via an old elevator operated by the old, mysterious Ed Oswald.

Whilst crawling through a narrow tunnel in the caves, Sarah has a flashback of what happened in the caves, and in a nervous panic, attacks Vaines, Greg and Elen and runs off deeper into the caves. Vaines pursues Sarah but eventually runs into a crawler and fires a shot at one. This causes part of the cave to collapse, separating Cath from the rest of the group. Elen, Dan and Greg arrive in a room full of bones where they find the video camera used by the girls in the first film. They watch the playback, which reveals the girls were attacked by the crawlers. The three are attacked by a group of crawlers and separate.
