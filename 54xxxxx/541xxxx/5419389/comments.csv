I've been away for a few days and have just caught up on my reading.Sorry to see all the
ones who have given you a hard time...but
I guess that's nothing new.Some people
think they know it all when they really know
nothing.I have some downloading to do so
thanks for all the stuff you posted over the
weekend and have a good day."
