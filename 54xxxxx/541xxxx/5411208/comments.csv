,Ox1de,2010-03-07T22:15Z,you first have to use winRar to extract the video file from the packs if you haven't done that yet.  Then you can really use any player to play them.  I use media player classic.  Thanks for the file though it's too bad mtv.com doesn't have the new episodes on their site anymore.. Oh well
