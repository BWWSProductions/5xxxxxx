,erzsike66,2010-03-07T18:54Z,"here is message from Razor buddies:
This is the first day that we have been working on Assassin's Creed 2 and in this time we have achieved alot. We have bypassed the Ubisoft Launcher and you won't have to keep entering the cd key again and again. Even if you disconnect from the internet, the game will continue. And about the savegames; The Ubisoft server has only started working on March 5th. Only then we have been able to find out where the trigger files go to, their format and other vital information needed to make a working crack. A crack should be released the 5th, 6th or in the worst case scenario, the 7th of March."

,lydiqbe,2010-03-07T19:08Z,FAKE ... when u start with this save game u are broken and u have 146florins or so ... fkin fake
,Dakki93,2010-03-07T19:15Z,that was my post originaly. i found it on our screenfun forum (gaming magazine) ...
,MorteEterno,2010-03-07T19:19Z,"i can confirm that this save game works. it's about 9 hours in, about 20% completion. you don't have much money, but who cares? just pickpocket and find treasure. i haven't tried any missions yet, but i've been running around, killing guards, finding treasure, and climbing view points and it works great. can't wait until i can actually play through the game with a working crack, but until then i'm thankful to be able to just dick around with this save game. thanks melis!"
,Dakki93,2010-03-07T19:20Z,you can do it with other save games..
,MorteEterno,2010-03-07T19:23Z,"eh this is the first save game i tried and it works, so... i'll just use this one."
,Dakki93,2010-03-07T19:26Z,"never mind, anyway when proper crack come we will play it from start x)))"
,Neuro109,2010-03-07T19:29Z,"Yeah you can't start your own save game, animus screne wont load still. And missions wont load, so you can pretty much just run around as Ezio with what he has done."
,AbilSala,2010-03-07T22:22Z,"Can't do Missions, but you can see the City."
,Dakki93,2010-03-07T23:31Z,and cut some flesh x)
,Furko99,2010-03-08T02:49Z,"only thing that bothers me at this save game is that when you go on viewpoint and press sychronize map does't uptade in fact it doesn't really update that you used viewpoint and only thing that's updated on your map are treasure locations wich kindah sux tbh....but still at least I can kill some guards and climb somwhere else then Acre, Jerusalem and Damascus"
,Seta00,2010-03-08T04:10Z,"Nice to see how the game looks like, but I'm really waiting for the proper crack, so I can go through all the game. Great upload man!"
,hiddepolen,2010-03-08T11:48Z,"THANKS MAN!!!
I am so grateful :)

Finally playing some AC II...

Thnx :D"
,Ericsson.88,2010-03-08T12:55Z,"Dosnt not work for me. I delete my profile ingame and then replace the save files in ubi game launcher , but when i start the game i cant see any profle, only start a new one. Anyone? "
,snigglesxxx,2010-03-08T14:04Z,"Hi - just worked out how to get these save files working.

If you monitor your save folder while you are loading the game you will see that the game is downloading new saves off it's server and using them to start you at the beginning.

I just disconnected my internet just after i clic load my saves and hey presto you will have access to the saves provided in this torrent and be able to get past the animus."
,snigglesxxx,2010-03-08T14:15Z,"Make sure you delete everything in the ' 4 ' folder first and then place his four save files in there.

I also wasn't sure if the ' Assassin2.ini ' is storing any game progress - so i deleted that as well before i load the game just to be sure.

This file is located at 

My Computer / C Drive (main hard drive) / Documents and Settings / Your Name? / Application Data / Ubisoft / Assassin's Creed 2

All worked for me and at least you can get a good idea of the gameplay.  Doesn't seem to be any way to save your progress though and so a lttle experimentation may be needed (maybe reconnect the internet while in game and see if you can make a new online save?)

God - there making this game so ruddy complicated to play - LOL."
,snigglesxxx,2010-03-08T14:36Z,"Last comment - i promise.

Just tried it again and it definetely works - you will have to clear out your save folder and plonk in the 4 saves from this torrent every time you start a new game but at least we can play it for now untill a proper crack comes along.

Don't forget - you only disconnect your internet connection when it starts saying ' sychronizing saved games' - it will then say failed to load or something but you can still clic play and load the saves in your save folder.

HAVE FUN!"
,Seta00,2010-03-08T16:42Z,"You don't have to place the saves every time you want to play.
You can just click the gear icon at the left of the minimize icon in the Ubisoft Loader, so it stops synchronizing your save with the server. If you do this, you can even save your progress using this savegame, but you can't go into missions. Remember: if you accept a mission, the screen goes white, and you can only see the HUD."
,Furko99,2010-03-08T16:44Z,well there is another way to make saves work and does not require to unplug your cable....in top right corner near minimize button there's a hexagram star click it and it will ask you if you want to disable online saving bla bla bla click yes and restart launcher it should work after that w'o problems 
,Furko99,2010-03-08T16:47Z,oh and I think Ubi has problems with their servers still...I was able to connect this morning but now I'm trying to reconnect for like 40min and well I got passed logging in and am stuck and serial key so if you can't log in just try it all over and over again you might get in =P
,Ericsson.88,2010-03-08T17:50Z,"Thanks fruko, works now:) Dam its so much cooler than the first one :D"
,erzsike66,2010-03-08T19:23Z,I hope it will work :I :O
,Furko99,2010-03-08T20:56Z,LoL I really hope that hotfile crack works cuz I'm tired of putting guards on benches and wheat stacks rofl tho and rofl it's 110MBs big ... but out of security reasons I'm gonna scan rar 1st
,MorteEterno,2010-03-08T21:07Z,downloaded the hotfile crack but i can't test it now because ubi's servers are under attack again. a proper crack would bypass the internet check with ubisoft.
,Furko99,2010-03-08T21:19Z,yeah same here I guess some ppl are trying to teach Ubi that DRM wasn't such a good idea the hard way...it just sux 
,Furko99,2010-03-08T21:35Z,I managed to get in but crack doesn't work for me still animus bug
,WayOne,2010-03-08T21:37Z,Well i believe the file on hotfile by hiroshiro is another fake but if anyone happens to try it please report... i'm bored right now... =)
,WayOne,2010-03-08T21:45Z,"Oh sorry i haven't seen your comment, anyway just what i was expecting.
 I really hope to see a scene release tomorrow i can't wait to play it!"
,Furko99,2010-03-08T22:11Z,Yeah I wish scene release comes tomorrow or at least ASAP since I'm getting borred and and seeing white bathroom floor tiles on the map is irritating tho I dunno what will I do when proper crack comes since I already renovated almost whole Monterrigioni all I need is lvl3 blacksmith rofl...tho I was trying to look for feathers and glyphs but w'o working viewpoints it's almost Impossible 
,dont_ask,2010-03-09T09:09Z,i dnt if the scene can do it 2bh :( i hope they do though
,dont_ask,2010-03-09T09:10Z,i dnt know*

,erzsike66,2010-03-10T20:03Z,"2db gyors hír egy chat oldalról.Úgy gondoltam érdemes bemásolnom.

hétvégére már tökéletes RaZoR1911 Cracket fognak kihozni a srácok.
Kiváncsi leszek az Ubisoft Védelmére :/
2:Biztos forrásból tudom. már feltörték .

,thrayel,2010-03-10T20:23Z,"Az orosz oldalt énis ovlastam google translate-el, de ott sincs sok bizonyíték.

Kis részük pedig vagy nagyon okosnak hiszi magát, vagy csak át akar verni élvezetb?l másokat. Ezek aztán mondanak mindent, csak senki nem képes egyetlen müködö linkkel alátámasztani amit állít :D Ha eddig nem is, mostmár megtanultam hogy az ember ilyenkor szépen leül a seggére, és nem csinál semmit, amíg nem jön egy valódi krekk valamelyik neves hacker csapat nevével fémjelezve...
