[V],HMVinyl,2010-03-04T23:26Z,"when your listening to it on a 5.1 dts system, flac really matters, the biggest difference is in the percussion, the hi-hats and cymbals sound alot more clear, and the bass has a more of a hum than a wobble. personnaly i prefer listening to music on vinyl, but if i have to go digital i only go with flac"
,TechProd,2010-03-06T00:17Z,I appreciate this a lo! Thatk you so much HMVinyl. Best CD ripper on TPB.
,Archibald_NME,2010-03-06T02:10Z,"@ex15, Nobody is doubting MP3 is here to stay...but just like there will always be cheap McDonald's burgers, fat girls, and camera-in-the-theater videos, there will always be those of us that prefer a nice filet mignon, hot skinny girls, and Blu-Ray.

Ces't la vie..."

[V],HMVinyl,2010-03-10T08:01Z,im glad everyones happy :) love this album too!
,rarely.reply,2010-03-10T19:34Z,"Just curious,.. If track 17 is an iTunes' bonus track, how can it be available in lossless format? Is it converted from m4a file? Is this album originally has 16 tracks and you added track 17 you got from iTunes yourself?"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-03-10T22:44Z,"we got it in Apple Lossless Audio, and we just converted it to flac."
,Raccio14,2010-03-12T06:25Z,"Ummm, how did you get it in Apple lossless?  the Itunes store only sells 256kbps stuff right?

and if you have the deluxe edition stuff from the Itunes store, what about the 18th song?"
,glamisrnr,2010-03-12T11:10Z,"I am new to listening to FLAC, all I have to say is AMAZING sounds unbelievable in my trucks sound system. Thank you for the FLAC version."
,dark_globe,2010-03-14T07:08Z,Pirates Progress is also available on the Japan release.

,ppahv,2010-03-27T22:07Z,Thx man.
[V],HMVinyl,2010-03-30T18:26Z,who went nuts on the - button?
,Arg_the_pirate,2010-04-12T19:29Z,"If you download this and convert it to 320 kbps CBR using Foobar2000, I swear you won't be able to tell the difference.

Thank you for providing the source for this. Such crisp sound..."
,mdhttr420,2010-04-16T01:00Z,"sounds amazing thank you!
one note though, what burning software do yall recommend that supports mode2? i changed it to mode1 because i love imgburn, obviously a bit dated though."
,Death-Dude-72,2010-07-07T03:13Z,Does this one have the videos on it as well? It's a pretty large file.

,kala22,2010-09-15T16:08Z,"Thanks man, I got a 1tera hard drive so I can afford to have all my music in FLAC :D"
,StvnWilsn,2011-04-14T19:49Z,mp3 days are over. lets boycott mp3s and move on to FLAC. VIVA FLAC REVOLUTION. xD
