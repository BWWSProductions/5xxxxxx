,deathb4detox,2010-03-08T05:07Z,Is this the real OEM version or it's a hack version? I'm guessing it's a hack version as this activate non slic 2.1 machines and it's missing PC Doctor and HP update software. If I'm wrong some one correct me

"
,mda20ro,2010-03-12T09:11Z,"This looks pretty genuine to me. installed it on a HP HDX 18t (64 bit version), the activated windows logo shows, can do updates, microsoft security essentials and others. now for the best part: i've installed the Windows6.1-KB971033-x64.MSU update which kills over 70 cracks for activating a counterfeit version of windows and after 10 restarts it is still genuine. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
,buckysone,2010-03-13T23:58Z,"Just installed this on a Dell Inspiron 1501 laptop.
It is activated, can be updated and microsoft security essentials is installed after this copy of Windiws 7 has been validated by Microsoft. "
,samorbaloch,2010-03-14T08:31Z,please seed it.....
,samorbaloch,2010-03-14T13:27Z,"you peoples got it and installed, after forgot to seed......?

but please friends, seed it. its about 15% i have been downloaded."
,St4tty,2010-05-03T01:35Z,"although Compaq is a company owned by HP, on the last screenshot (http://bayimg.com/iaLOdAAca) it states the manufacturer of the computer is Hewlett Packard, just to confirm all new compaq computers say Compaq, not Hewlett Packard under the computer manufacturer, although this is no problem, could be annoying :/ just thought id point it out :D"
,wally2164,2010-06-09T05:24Z,"Works great!  Installed on two HP/Compaq laptops.  Didn't have to do anything special, just ran the boot program and installed great!  Been working for over a month now!"
,borrowedwifi,2010-06-11T03:07Z,"Have this up and running (x86) on an old HP dv1010us with a modded BIOS, and it's rock solid and has passed all activation checks with not so much as a hiccup, including the dreaded KB971033 Windows Update. Have had some fun with driver installs, but that's all sorted out too, finally, and the machine runs like a champ. Kindest thanks go to DAC2010 for putting this one together, and further thanks to all seeders who keep the flame burning."
,BVJ,2010-06-15T10:40Z,Now im downloading this.I have compaq 610 laptop and it does not have SLIC 2.1.Will this activated automatically or i hve to use a loader?
,nickfuryfan13,2010-06-20T08:27Z,will this work on a hp mini? 
,ekeuus,2010-06-21T18:48Z,Will download and test as soon as i get home. Will we get this boot screen?
,BVJ,2010-06-29T06:58Z,"Works well on my compaq 610,and it is activated too.bt when im installing drivers ,compaq logon screen is gone and normal windows 7 logon screen is appeared.any idea to fix it?"
,ftv3000,2010-06-29T21:54Z,"Installed in hp mini 2140 (is only 32bit) from usb & works like a charm!!!

After updates will see...

By the way no OEM installation disk Acer Dell HP etc.. will have any drivers or company programs, it's just the OS, if you're looking for drivers please take the time to go to the manufacturer's site. ;)"
,ftv3000,2010-06-30T05:51Z,"This is 2L2Q not a single error after updates!!!

Please check if your bios supports SLIC 2.1 otherwise this will not work with your computer... 2nd or 3rd quarter 2009 bios... I can't tell you more.

Do it yourself. That's the best way!!! Enjoy!!! ;)"
,ftv3000,2010-06-30T05:54Z,"@ DAC2010

,hprodigy,2010-08-03T12:35Z,"Works perfect, on my hp dx2400, installation complet in 20min..
After installation, updates (20-30 windows updates complete no errors..)
Activated permanently...
1 Q: 1update left .. scared to update.. may i update windows update KB2286198 (answer if someone udated)..."
,venutia,2010-08-10T16:02Z,"Will this pass a WGA test?

I have an hp laptop with bios from 2008, so it's probably not SLIC 2.1.  It runs fine, but I haven't attempted to update it yet.

Are there unique identifiers anywhere than can uniquely identify the machine, such that W7 could be deactivated at a later date?   Such as hardware serials or TPM ids/keys."
,venutia,2010-08-10T16:34Z,"PS.  Apparently microsoft allows pirated Win7 installs to get updates, so getting updates is no guarantee that MS thinks you're legit.   They are doing this to cut down the spread of windows-based malware.

Microsoft: Pirated Windows 7 Will Still Get Updates

,erpanmail,2010-09-03T20:27Z,"Venutia didnt you read description? with or without slic. 

If you slipstream a dvd it becomes like the original hp disc then you dont need activation , works on 6930p like a charm.  for venutia even after windows update it works, unlike loaders that will stop working after latest update. "
,awaisahussain786,2010-09-17T18:44Z,"do i have to copy onto a cd before use
plz answer, Thx"
,MarcusN0,2010-11-01T13:00Z,"I have a formatted Compaq Mini 700, will this install properly on that? I have tryed normal Windows 7 cracked, but as far as i know, Compaq have their own little ""Secret Files"" to install.."
,cyfa89,2010-11-18T03:35Z,"hi

,Johnson87887,2011-02-13T13:26Z,"I recently installed this windows 7 on my dell inspiron n1020 laptop upon windows 7 lite without dvd/cd

"
,Blk_Icer,2011-02-25T02:13Z,"Works Great! , Thx DAC it also works on non-HP/Compaq's. No problems with Updates even the WAT update no Problem..
Note: Use RW-Everything and verify your motherboard is SLIC 2.1 capable before downloading... :-)"
,MaricSavo,2011-02-25T04:50Z,"Hi ppl!
Can anybody tell me does this version of Win contains the HP software also or is it just a normal OS with a few images added?
Thank you!!"
,Landyman97,2011-03-02T11:47Z,this isnt a FULL oem it has compaq backrounds and a compaq logo on the system properties but it doesent come with all the HP software or a Recovery Partition? its just a Basic OEM
,ReaperX7,2011-03-09T09:20Z,"Wow... a HP/Compaq Windows 7 Ultimate Master Disk!!! Cool!!! These Master Disks are rare finds from any PC OEM, but a gold mine for techs in need of system disks. They're preloaded with just about every OEM key to that manufacturer as well as some small OEM stuff like screens, desktops, etc.

These disks are extremely rare and almost never are allowed out to the public because they are clean copies of Windows without OEM specific software. Nice find DAC2010!!!"
,cyfa89,2011-03-10T12:27Z,"just a bit more feedback
been running this since november.
just updated with service pack 1 also
absolutely fine, no problems what so ever.
people read the description - with or without slic
(what ever that is! :D)

i dont think it comes with the recovery partition
it doesnt come with the linux quick boot thing either :(
BUT! you can now download splashtop from their website for quick (linux) boot
splashtop works fine on mine (hp envy 13)"
,suresh3b2,2011-03-28T10:57Z,Great... Working fine with my compaq laptop previous having Vista
,cyfa89,2011-03-31T21:35Z,"SP1 is out
caused a problem with chkdsk and update after chkdsk on mine so beware
although i dont think this is a problem specific to this copy
seems quite widespread, so be wary"
,phenomenalphalanx,2011-04-13T00:09Z,would this work on my desktop?
,cemery1024,2011-04-18T13:44Z,"i have a question, my younger bro fried his Compaq with some weird hard drive problem and needs a new OS, would this work as a full computer reboot"
,naruto000,2011-04-21T00:46Z,Love this idea
,tylerwatt,2011-05-15T03:53Z,If anyone needs help modding their BIOS to Slic 2.1. i can give you a Bios ROM/WPH. just email me with your model number or WPH file. tylerwatt12@gmail.com
,chamoli63,2011-07-23T10:50Z,Hay guys this windows is superb and works very good today i am surprise to see that that genuine windows advantage tool does not detect that it is a pirated window
,1TWISTED,2011-07-28T19:45Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"
,kacper0327,2011-08-06T10:43Z,is this windows only English?
,45sigsauer,2011-11-26T22:13Z,"Thanks worked GREAT! I have a laptop that came pre-installed with Vista basic, it crashed, tried using F11 factory restore, told me Vista wasn't compatible with this computer, WTF? it came installed with it! borrowed a Vista disk from friend, same deal, downloaded this, installed no problem, computer works better than it ever has!
