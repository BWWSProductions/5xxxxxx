How to use:
 - Launch Steam and login to your account with Modern Warfare 2 on it
 - Open VAC_Chaos.exe as administrator
 - Change the configurations however you would like
 - Click Load Game when you're ready to play
 - Make sure it says "VAC status: Not Loaded", or else do not load any hacks/cheats
   (if it says "VAC status: Loaded" and you ran the game with "Load Game" button, post on forum immediately)
 - Now load up your favorite hacks/cheats and enjoy consequenceless gaming! ;) *

* Note: by using this program, you agree that I, the programmer, shall not be in any way responsible for
    anything that happens to your account! You use this and any other program you download from the
    internet at your own risk. With that said, if you exercise caution (e.g. make sure VAC is not loaded),
    you should be completely protected. Watch out for viruses when you look for third party hacks/cheats.

    Do not exit VAC Chaos during a game... just don't, unless you want expensive paperweight.

    If you are paranoid about a ban, rename your third party hacks/cheats before using. This program will
    rename itself, so that won't be an issue.

    With that said, good luck, and have fun guys ;) Please donate if you love this program!
