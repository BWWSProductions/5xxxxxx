The reason why it's being detected as a virus is because it's a hacking tool. It's all false positives and are nothing to worry about, I can asure you that. Please keep giving feedback about the status so I can quickly update as soon as it get detected by Valve."

Running Vista 32-bit.....

Confused?!?"
,Chazla,2010-07-04T23:47Z,"Extracting File Failed. It's most likely caused by low memory (low disk space for swapping file) or Corrupted cabinet file.

Any idea how to fix this?

And what do you mean with Launch Steam?
