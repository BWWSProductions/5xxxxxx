,ph4ilure,2010-03-05T13:59Z,Well... that sucks.
,Frice,2010-03-05T15:13Z,"Naw im seeding it now.

FYI I tried this last night and I lost twice, alot harder than what we have seen before.

I highly recommend this if you think the previous versions were to easy (which I did)."
,RuneWW,2010-03-05T19:16Z,"The last versions were so easy I could pick them off in my sleep, I hope this is hard. Thanx for the work!"
,Frice,2010-03-06T01:42Z,"This ver is alot different RuneWW, just got pwned although I was trying a experimental barracks only build.

The comp just raped me with about 20 bc's and a few valks for support. 

Lemme know whatcha think Runeww..."
