http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5415202/Starcraft_2_Beta_-_AI_V.6.0.(Easy__Medium__Hard).%5BDarkBlizz%5D

===================================================================================

Version 6.0
Features:
- Custom state manager
- New resource managing functions (total saturation per town)
- Expansion managing functions (defences, etc)
- New custom AI attack functions (resource harrasing, constant pressure on the player)
- 3 new opens, mid and late games for every race. (Which means 27 different variations per race and 81 overall)
- All the crappy old build orders are gone.
- Standard, cheating and easy versions (you might need these this time!).

Version 6.0 is an almost complete re-write of the blizzard state system as well as the mid and late game for StarCrack AI. This means, we're able to easily write multiple build orders for the various races and control the progression with "triggers" rather than time. On top of this, AI resource code has got a huge overhaul. He now hits the saturation point on all of his towns for both mineral and gas. He can handle is own supplies and defences for all towns. This means we've dropped all the blizzard code for handling this stuff, which is awesome because it sucked. I think I've dropped 100 - 200 lines of blizzard code in this version, all replaced with our custom stuff.

What's stopping us releasing now, is we want to have 3 opens, 3 mid games and 3 late games. All which are randomly chosen, it's just taking a while to work them in and test them. We also want to have more modular attack states. Eg, divert and defence waves (the former will harass resource collectors).

Bottom line. This AI will be hard.
ETA: Soon (no, not tonight)

Just a fyi above for all you sc2beta AI fiends out there.

-This is not ver 6.0 btw, its just a chinese guy's addition to the v5.5 cheater-AI crack.
 
-His folder is called "AI" and you just extract the contents into the sc2beta folder, you will know its working because of his info at the beginning of each map.

-5 player map
[no 5 player maps easily available, go ahead and look. They aren't out there on nibbits as far as I know.]


Enjoy and happy gaming. (T.Y. Darkblizz & Starcrack!)
