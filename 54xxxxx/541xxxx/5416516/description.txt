Never On Sunday, the foreign-film hit of 1960-61, had two main things going for it. The first was Melina Mercouri, playing a happy prostitute who works (you guessed it) six days a week; she won the best actress award at Cannes, was nominated for an Oscar, and became an international star. The second was the score by Manos Hadjidakis, filled with lively bouzouki music and including the title tune, which became a Top 40 hit in both an instrumental recording by Don Costa and a vocal version by the Chordettes and won the Academy Award for best song. This soundtrack album, on which Mercouri  sings the song in Greek, was an even bigger hit, just missing #1 and staying in the charts over a year. The music has an enduring folkish appeal that continued to come across 38 years later, when the album was reissued on CD by Rykodisc. The new version was an enhanced disc featuring the film's coy original trailer.
