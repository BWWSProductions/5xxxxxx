,DelphiUniverse,2010-04-01T15:14Z,"According to the file sizes of the different files it is not fake. I have downloaded the patches individually outside of this torrent, and its the same size as the patch in this torrent. Seems to be identical and not fake."
,nitr0fueled,2010-04-06T19:54Z,How do you think toni32 earned his trusted mark? By uploading fake torrents? Of course it works. The game contains a lot of bugs though. But most of it got fixed in the 1.1 Patch wich is included in this download.
