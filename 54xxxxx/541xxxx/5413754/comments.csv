,FuyuKitsune,2010-06-18T03:40Z,"(all the tests I'm doing are on a separate test-machine, don't try this at home kids)
I would not trust this. The file ""wmedia.exe"" is a malware dropper, it drops an executable (and some other stuff) and downloads a list of spam links (spam list: tuff-kid.com/tubeapp/tubelist.dat) and an updater file. Both ""setup.exe"" try to execute that file.
The cracks, however, seemed surprisingly clean. I ran them and found nothing, no drops, no reg entries, not a spec, nothing.  I also unpacked it and checked the resources, clean. Antivirus didn't like them but I'm not troubled by that, it would be a common response to this type of crack. I'm pretty sure that the crack mods the Hosts file to stop online updates and prevent updates from killing the crack.
The serials do, in fact, work, but the crack is necessary to prevent updates from recognizing the shared serial.
There are also a lot of useless (and some suspicious) files. The entire ""third party"" folder is unneeded, as is the ""support"" folder (which I do not trust). ""supportsoft"" is unneeded and not trusted, and Google Desktop is unneeded. Both the windowsinstaller MSI and msxml.msi are safe (they're the exact versions from Microsoft) but they're old and completely unneeded.

my outcome: find a different torrent. This isn't very trustworthy, even after removing the stuff that I could find."
