Muradyan (aka vahrammuradyan) is electronic multi-instrumental experimental artist. He was born in 1983 in Armenia. After graduating from secondary piano school by Yerevan State Conservatory started making goa-trance music on four-track trackers. After a couple of airs on local radio station and in clubs he has quit and continued improvising on piano waiting for better software to come.

In 2004-2007 Muradyan went on recording and mixing beats and acoustic sounds on low-fi recorder and eventually collected them in Heart Cocktail album to conclude that period.

Songs About The Sona San appeared shortly after in 2008.

Muradyanâ€™s latest album Cutcult (Raw Cut)(2009) reveals his old interest to hip-hop: â€œcollages mixed of different samples from different times and genres exhaling crunchy rhythmic hip hop soundâ€, as written on his website. The album was released in a form of 50 hand-made signed copies.

Otherwise Muradyan is a visual artist and bubuk.

Muradyanâ€™s style is very versatile but always warm, strange and calm.
