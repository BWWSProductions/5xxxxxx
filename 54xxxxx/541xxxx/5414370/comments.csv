,KeeperUsiel,2010-03-07T04:45Z,Thanks for the up but this torrent needs a much faster seed.
,imnotreallyhere,2010-03-12T06:31Z,"such a fantastic game.  please keep seeding, i'll help keep it alive as long as possible once i get it.  

i lost a few years of my life to this game when it first came out.  there are a number of fan patches for this game.  if you like it, you should search around for them, they fix and perfect this already wonderful strategy game.  "

But there's no ""setup"" file and merging the included .reg file doesn't work either."
