Legacy

The record spent only one week on the British charts, at #45, whereas all the band's previous studio albums had reached the Top 30. In the United States, it reached #66 on the Billboard 200.
However, it remained a popular album with fans and critics. In 2001 Q magazine named Red as one of the "50 Heaviest Albums of All Time,"[3] and Kurt Cobain has cited the album as a major influence. [4][5] Musicologists Eric Tamm and Edward Macan both consider Red, and particularly the track "Starless", to be the highlight of King Crimson's recorded output. Users of Rate Your Music.com have rated it the Number 1 album of 1974, and 49th greatest album of all time.[6]
