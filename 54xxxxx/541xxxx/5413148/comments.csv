,SDWILLIA,2010-04-26T17:14Z,"Can't get ""bat"" to run.  It pops up and goes away just as fast.

What am I doing wrong?"
,rotisman,2010-05-12T20:31Z,codes not accepted
,JadedGurl,2010-05-15T17:41Z,"For those have problems with the keymaker:
After installing the game, cut and paste the files KeyMaker and runme.bat to the folder where the game has installed (should be C:\Program Files\Mystery P.I. - The London Caper). After that, its pretty straightforward.
Works great, thank you!"
,rotisman,2010-06-02T20:10Z,After putting both files into games folder it then worked a treat. Nice one
,underthechickenwire,2010-06-16T11:43Z,"Works great! Moved Keygen and .bat file into game folder. Used generated name and code for registration, worked like a charm!

Thanks!"
,mrmanizh,2010-06-19T06:32Z,"first unzip all the files alltogether install  the mystery p.i. application, go to the C:\program mystery p.i. the london caper folder and copy the ""runme"" batch file there 
then double click the runme batch file the one you copied in the folder and then double click the keymaker and enter the name and the key you DONOT have to copy the keymaker in the program folder unless you want it in there..i did not see the point of putting it in there if it DONT NEED TO BE THERE!!"
