google maps for windows mobile phones.

worked great on my t-mobile htc wing.

there is a single cab file you can copy to a memory card to install it.

I also put in a text file with some cool registry tweaks for the t-mobile wing.
i have had a hard time finding stuff for the wing so i just wanted to pass on the tweaks.
