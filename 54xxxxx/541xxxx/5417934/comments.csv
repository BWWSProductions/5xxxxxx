,schroed4,2010-04-05T09:56Z,"Awesome torrent! I love the installer, and the fact that its the higher resolution version.
But in case people want it, I suggest adding a link to the Clannad walkthrough... It can be easy to get stuck trying to figure out how to get to After Story.
Here is a link to the walkthrough; http://www.hongfire.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=142085&d=1259554020"
,Roxxas,2010-04-14T07:49Z,"hey, has anyone played this copy yet? how is the quality? how are the english texts? any noticeable grammatical errors? anything too obvious? "
,schroed4,2010-04-22T09:59Z,"This has the same English translations as the other version of the Clannad VN on this site. Its rather good. Their are some times when the japanese characters are used for names, or other things that bare little importance. Nothing is there that should get in the way of enjoying it.
The major differences between this version and the other one, is that:
This one has higher resolution.
This one has English menus.
This one has English still images (the game sometimes has still images at the ends of arcs. This torrent has them translated)
Unlike the other version, the 'previous question' feature doesn't work in this version for some reason.  Its not that bad if your fine with saving more.
Overall, a very nice torrent, which I have a ratio over 90 on."

,D34THW41K3R,2011-04-18T23:55Z,"hey, this works great, but i hve one question. how come i need admin priveleges when saving? i can save it just fine, but whenever i try to load the save, it just plain doesnt show up O_o"
,D34THW41K3R,2011-04-18T23:59Z,also does this work in Windows 7?
,eagleman252,2011-10-12T17:25Z,"Downloaded but problem with ""Reallive.exe""

Got any tips?
Thanks"
,Karsac,2011-11-30T15:21Z,"I have installed this and while the game works fine, I can't seem to change the Voice to English. Anyone have any ideas?"
,pyroneutral,2012-02-07T02:14Z,"i'm having the same trouble with ""Reallive.exe""
 it just doesn't want too load"
,zamaste,2012-02-22T04:58Z,"for those having the problem with the reallive.exe, i got around it by running the program as an administrator."
,mrbean343,2012-03-29T04:38Z,"I'm almost done with Fuuko's path, but the BGM suddenly stopped. The voices keep going, but no music ever plays. Also every time Nagisa refers to Okazaki as Tomoya his name is ""No valid string, make a ticket about it"" in the text. Half the time Nagisa's name is omitted from text as well just leaving a blank space where her name should be. Mostly bothered by the music but any help would be appreciated. "

Does anyone have 
Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life ?
Please and thank you!

^seconded. It would be greatly appreciated. "
,greg1007,2012-04-11T04:47Z,"I would also greatly appreciate Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life. The adult version is preferable, because i would like to experience the full story as it was originally written. Not for pleasure. "
,ITACHIUCHIHA005,2012-04-19T07:04Z,"Great torrent and visual novel! Quick question though. Is the voice supposed to be English dubbed? Also, what are the setup-1.bin and setup-2.bin? Thanks!"
,D34THW41K3R,2012-05-02T06:56Z,"first on the list: no, this is not English dubbed. second (For mrbean): that was fixed in an update to the patch files. ill try and find them for you if you'd like, it'll be my first torrent anyway lol and a warning about upgrading the patches, it corrupts your save files, so finish your ongoing story lines and then update. it does not however corrupt your cg and finished path progresses, so not too big of a deal"
,D34THW41K3R,2012-05-02T06:57Z,the go to previous question option was fixed as well if you were wondering
,D34THW41K3R,2012-05-02T07:00Z," hate triple posting, but to itachi's question, treat the bin files as the cds, Self has made a custom installer for this game i believe and those are the data cd's"
,omersang,2012-05-23T16:01Z,@D34THW41K3R Sir can you give me some ideas of how to play this game? I only watch the anime of this and i'm kinda interested in the game. :) How to play it?
,Wishkers,2012-06-02T16:09Z,Is this the 18+ or the later released SFW version?
,WNxstrikeman,2012-06-16T22:51Z,"@Wishkers
There is no 18+ version of this game. It is completely clean. It is posible you may be thinking of a different KEY game."
,MaiBonu,2012-06-29T03:32Z,I watched the series for about half a year ago and when I started playing this and the dungle music started playing with nigisa looking towards me in the beginning... I seriously started crying. Thank you for this torrent i'm looking forward to play the rest of the game. ^.^
,merf75,2012-07-04T22:38Z,"I NEED HELP!

I already have this game loaded onto a different computer, so now that I have another computer, I want to load it onto my new computer. 

When I clicked the GET THIS TORRENT link with the magnet, nothing happened. It didn't start downloading or anything! I know it says ""problems with magnet links are fixed by upgrading your torrent client"" but I'm afraid it could screw with my computer or give me viruses! Is there anything else  I can do? Or is that my only option?"
,merf75,2012-07-04T23:47Z,"IGNORE MY LAST COMMENT!! I think I got it working, now. :-)"
