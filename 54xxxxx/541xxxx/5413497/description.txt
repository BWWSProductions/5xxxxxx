The early 90s had not been kind to Aswad, their popularity seemed to be 
slipping, but all that was to change with "Shine." The single was featured
twice on their new album, Rise and Shine, once in its original form and a 
second time as a sizzling remix courtesy of the Beatmasters.


More than a decade before he was gettin jiggy with it, Will Smith was the 
Fresh Prince, with help on production from his Philly friend DJ Jazzy Jeff, 
the duo hit the Top Ten in 1991 with the platinum single "Summertime," a 
laid-back trip through everyone's favorite season with help from a spacy 
sample originally found on Kool & the Gang's "Summer Madness."
 

"Good Vibrations," the Beach Boys 1966 entry into the best-single-of-all-
time sweepstakes, announced the coming era of pop experimentation with a 
rush of riff changes, echo-chamber effects, and intricate harmonies, plus 
the very first theremin ever heard on a pop record.

Unquestionably the most definitive example of Mexican-based rock & roll,
"La Bamba" is actually based on a traditional Spanish folk song, which
is where Richie Valens first heard it. To be sure, his 1958 hit version 
is probably the most definitive, but this version by Los Lobos (arguably 
heirs to Valens' throne) is equallyeffective.
 
Categorically 10ccs last undisputed classic, and, deservedly, their third 
British chart-topper (it reached number 44 in the U.S.). Taken from 1978's 
Bloody Tourists album, a delightfully sunny mock reggae backing accompanies 
the cautionary tale of a white man lost in the Jamaican backwaters â€” a true 
story, it is said, which they heard firsthand from the Moody Blues'
Justin Hayward. 

In more politically correct times, one could get quite offended by the 
pseudo-patois voices which utter dire imprecations, or the trouble-soothing 
chorus of "I don't like cricket...I love it!," as though even the toughest 
ghetto gangster can be distracted by the clunk of ball on willow. Fortunately, 
listeners in 1978 had more important things to worry about than imagined 
insults or latent British colonialism â€” for them, "Dreadlock Holiday" stood as
one of the most single-mindedly joyous stabs at white reggae ever conceived. 
And one of the most successful as well. We should enjoy it for exactly the same 
reasons.
