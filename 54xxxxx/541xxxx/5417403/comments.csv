,ThibWay,2010-03-21T02:12Z,"Hi zhmuplik nice release thanks for sharing ! I've just bought ""Sun God"" ^^.
I did also have a look on the torrent of slagsmalsklubben's discography, I guess you posess all the CDs :) .

Then could you do me a favor please ? I'd like to have ""His Morning Promenade"" in WAV (lossless quality) the one in ""Sagan om Konungens"", it would be reaallly nice if you could just extract the album and upload it, I'll keep your torrent alive after I've finish downloaded ;).
You can use this program it's sooo easy : http://www.qweas.com/download/audio_mp3/cd_rippers/cdripper.htm
 I'm pretty sure other people would like to have it too.

Thank you very much, continue your great job ;)."
