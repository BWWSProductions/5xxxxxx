Project Pitchfork was formed by Peter Spilles and Dirk Scheuber. Having agreed to work together, they then picked the project's name by picking a word at random from the dictionary. The demo 'K.N.K.A.' was recorded. Hypnobeat released their debut album 'Dhyani' in 1991.

Their second album 'Lam-'Bras' appeared in February 1992. This album yielded the first vocal appearance of Patricia Nigiani. The third Pitchfork album 'Entities' appeared a mere six months later, from which the track 'Souls' was later reworked into an 'extended version' on 1993's 'Souls/Island EP'. The band then switched to the Off-Beat label for 1994's 'IO', yielding the singles 'Renascence' and 'Carrion'.

In 1995, Project Pitchfork established their own label, "Candyland Entertainment", through which they release the majority of their own material as well as the material of other bands.

The next Pitchfork release, the 'Corps d'Amour' EP was more sexually-influenced than previous works, though the band denied any link between the lyrics and Peter's personal life. In 1995 the album 'Alpha Omega' was released. In the same year, Project Pitchfork's tour was supported by the band Rammstein. The next Project Pitchfork's studio album 'Chakra:Red!' arrived in 1997, the first album since 'Dhyani' to be written as a group effort rather than by Spilles alone.

Eon:Eon appeared in 1998, their first on a major label (the Warner Music Group label EastWest). The album yielded three singles in 'Steelrose', 'Carnival' and 'I Live Your Dream'. In the same year, the band was nominated for an Echo Award in the category 'Best video national'. The next Project Pitchfork album 'Daimonion' would not appear until 2001, with the song 'Timekiller' becoming one of their biggest club hits to date.

In 2002 Project Pitchfork were again nominated for an Echo Award, this time in the category 'Best Alternative Act national'.

2003 saw the release of the 'Nun' trilogy, with the 'Inferno' album and the EPs 'Trialog' and 'View From A Throne' released in quick succession.

It would be a further three years before Pitchfork returned again with the album 'Kaskade' in 2005. In 2006, the band released their first download-only releases in the form of 'Wonderland' and 'One Million Faces', though these were later released on CD in May 2007.

On the 23rd of January 2009, the band released the new MCD "Feel!" via Prussia Records. Then on the 27th of February, the band released the new album Dream, Tiresias!, also via Prussia Records. The album received high appraisal from electronic music magazine, ReGen
