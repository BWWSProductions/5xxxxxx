Here are the first 21 issues of the UK published Official Sega Saturn Magazine in fully search able PDF format.
I compiled them into PDF files for more convenient reading.
Sadly only 21 of the 37 issues were available and I'm not about to hack my issues up.
Anyway enjoy and please seed this don't just leech people thank you
