    Deep in the rainforest of Central Africa lies an           
    elephant oasis - a remarkable place that holds the key    
    to the future for forest elephants. Over the last 20     
    years, Andrea Turkalo has been studying these enigmatic   
    giants, getting to know over 4,000 intimately. She has     
    begun to unravel the secrets of their complex social      
    lives and the meanings of their unique vocalisations.    
    New acoustic research is shedding light on the many       
    mysteries that still surround forest elephant society.     
    Will these endangered elephants finally speak out and     
    tell Andrea what it is they need to survive?
