Tutorial for noobs:

2. Name the disc ""Just Cause 2"" (NOT necessary)
3. Burn the Disc
4. Power ON the 360 and eject the disc tray
5. Insert the Disc into your 360
6. Close the disc tray ;)
7. You WILL see Mixed Media Disc (dont worry)
8. Go to ""Game Library""

Just copy the ""Content"" floder to a cd disc.
I recomended a DVD-RW disc because you can remove it anytime and add more demos."
