Anyway, I'll check it out. I'm very into supernatural horror games. Thank you, blaze-69."

It's Actually Compressed./...

The Output Game Folder After Decompression Is 1 Point Something Gigs... "
,Venin,2010-03-13T17:31Z,"Right. It still seems smaller than I thought it would be. Mostly because I thought it was going to be something that combines Resident Evil and Silent Hill.

Anyway, the game is working pretty nicely. I think the controls are awkward, the voice acting could use some more work, and the same paintings on the mansion's wall are repeated many times, even in the same room, which I thought was pretty stupid. But if you can get past those problems, the game's music, ambiance, and atmosphere are all very creepy. The game is a lot scarier than it would have you believe after hearing the bad voice-acting.

To anyone who decides to try this game, please let yourself get through the opening cinematic before you judge it. At least to the point where you start off in the first room, and it let's you walk out and explore the mansion. You won't be disappointed."

,dsnyder24,2010-04-18T02:26Z,where do u disable UAC?
,Creep82,2010-05-08T01:03Z,"Works great. Had a sound issue but I just switched sound options in the sconfig exe and it worked fine.

It's an all right game... not going to be a classic or game of the year, but does a good job of entertaining."
