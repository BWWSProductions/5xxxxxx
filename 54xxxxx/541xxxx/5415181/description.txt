There's another torrent for this film but ppl were calling it fake so i decided to rip the dvd & upload it. hopefully this all goes good because this is my 1st rip/upload. The dvd says the run time is 75 minutes but the rip was on 59 minutes i think.. so let me know if anything's wrong with the file & i'll re-rip it if i have to.

Donner and his roomates are out of money and about to get evicted from their home. So as a diversion from their situation, he invites them to his father's cabin in the Canadian wilderness. They all go along, but soon learn that there's no cabin - he's really trying to find Sasquatch.

I will seed this torrent permanently, even if others decide not to.. but please seed at least as much as you download to make it faster for everyone. I also seed other torrents that aren't mine but i will pause everything for a few days to seed my own upload(s) at the fastest possible speed
