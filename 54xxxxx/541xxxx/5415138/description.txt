Long before the phrase, "Seattle scene" spoke of an impact that a new generation 
of musicians was having on rock music, Alice in Chains was struggling to be recognized 
in the shadow of bands that were more focused on image than craft. On FACELIFT, ... 
Full Descriptionthe band's major label debut, Alice in Chains proved that its fusion 
of blues, hard rock, and gritty imagery was a force to be reckoned with. While college 
radio stations ate up fare like "It Ain't Like That" and "We Die Young," the song 
"Man in a Box" became a banner track that pushed the band into the forefront of heavy 
rotation on MTV and the playlists of mainstream rock radio stations. 

Vocalist Layne Staley's moody, dynamic vocals on "Love, Hate, Love" tell a chilling tale 
of a homicidal psychotic lamenting and musing over what he's done to his lover. On tracks 
such as "Sea of Sorrow" and "I Can't Remember," guitarist Jerry Cantrell shows equally 
impressive skill in Sabbath-styled riffing, blues licks, and Hendrix-influenced solos. 
Alice in Chains made a brash musical and lyrical statement that gave the stale era of 
thrash and hair metal a much-needed facelift. 

Recorded at London Bridge Studios, Seattle, Washington and Capitol Recording Studios, Hollywood, California.
