,frnnkpb,2010-03-14T02:23Z,pleeaase jesus keep cricsus! he's what makes this show watchable. seeing spartacus get his ass kicked relentlessly is very harry potteresque. we like heroes. 
,bongowolf,2010-03-14T12:14Z,"After extracting this from RAR - What mediaplayer should I view this on?  It had soooo many dropouts & noise I found it unwatchable on a normal 19"" monitor screen (is this supposed to only be seen on a mini-screen like a cellphone???)

Please help - would like your advice! I really love the show & would love to see Show 09!"
,bongowolf,2010-03-15T11:28Z,"Downloaded a 2nd time - still cannot be shown on a normal mediaplayer like Realplayer, KM player, SMplayer, etc.  It's a tiny file that has tons of dropouts & noise! Please tell us what player to use to view?  Otherwise, I'd advise everyone to save their time - download is pretty much unwatchable.  

Please put up new NORMAL files. This one is b-a-d. Sorry....."
