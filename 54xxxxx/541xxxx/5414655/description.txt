      Luke, is a grifter who owes a significant debt to the Mexican mob.
      Set in the gritty underbelly of Gardena, CA Luke has to come up with
      one final scheme to pay back his debt or his life is at risk.
      Supported by his two only friends, Courtney and Josh, they come
      together to devise a plan that with a little blind luck just
      might get Luke out of the hole.
