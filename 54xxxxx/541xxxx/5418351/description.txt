When AC/DC came crashing through the gates of Castle Donington in August of
1991, they were headlining their third "Monsters of Rock" festival at the fabled venue.
They proceeded to assault the massive audience with a two hour set chock-full of
their greatest hits, and an over-the-top visual spectacle that included firing
cannons, the hells bells and a giant inflatable Rosie. Filmed in 35mm Panavision
with 26 cameras (including a helicopter), AC/DC Live at Donington is one of the
greatest live concert documents of all time.
