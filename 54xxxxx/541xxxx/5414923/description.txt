Waking The Demon, made by the amazing Bullet For My Valentine! (Bfmv)

Bullet For My Valeninte play Screamo (Emocore) music, with a little Death Metal Twist. 

This is their thrid single from the album "Scream Aim Fire".

All of their songs are amazing, but some are unbelievable. This one is one of them.

I hope You enjoy this amazing piece of music.
