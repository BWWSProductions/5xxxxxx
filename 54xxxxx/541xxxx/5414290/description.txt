Classic WoW:

Wrath of the Lichking
It has been five years since the heir apparent to the throne of Lordaeron disappeared into the frozen wastes of Northrend; five years since Arthasâ€™ unholy union with Nerâ€™zhul gave rise to one of the most powerful, twisted, and evil beings who ever walked the face of the world; five years of uneasy, foreboding silence. Still, the sweeping darkness many feared would spread outward from Northrendâ€™s shores never came... until now. The Lich King has risen, and his forces are on the move. As the prospects for peace darken and the clouds of the coming storm fill the skies, the heroes of Azeroth rally beneath their battle-worn banners to face the Scourge once again. Soon the world will learn what it means to incur the wrath of its one true king....You have braved the fires of Blackrock Mountain, ventured deep into the nightmarish hives of the qiraji and returned victorious, faced down the demons of the Burning Legion, and brought the Betrayer himself to justice. Yet your greatest adventure has only just begun. World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King adds a host of epic content to the existing game world. You will achieve soaring levels of power, explore a vast new continent, battle other high-level heroes to determine the fate of Azeroth, and much, much more.
