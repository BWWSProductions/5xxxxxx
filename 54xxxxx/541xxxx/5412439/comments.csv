My Vuze software shows 0 leechers, but TPB shows 8.  This is weird...."

[V],TheExecutive,2010-03-05T17:15Z,"Strange.....because I haven't uploaded Night Gallery yet (but I'm about to) and that's the episode I'll be offering.  

Well, this Midnight Special I just discovered is already on TPB uploaded in 2008:

[V],TheExecutive,2010-03-05T17:37Z,"I changed this to Night Gallery because that's what it is after all.  I had 2 torrents created, and I uploaded the wrong one.....oh well.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

If anyone here still wants that Andy Kaufman Midnight Special the above link didn't copy correctly. If you do a search here, you'll find the 2008 upload still seeded...although it's a VHS copy."
