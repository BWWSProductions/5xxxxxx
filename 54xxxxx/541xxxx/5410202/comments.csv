,havoc1979,2010-03-06T12:39Z,It's a crap copy. The subtitles take up half the screen
,GearType2,2010-03-06T20:25Z,"havoc is right, this isn't any better than the other smaller cams and it has subtitles that can not be disabled(at least when I tried to in VLC). "
,sweetspirit1,2010-03-07T18:12Z,WELL I DL JUST GETTING BACK THE QUALITY WAS LIKE YOU PAY FOR A BOOTLEG MOVIE BUT THIS COPY AND EVERY OTHER COPY THAT I DOWNLOADED WANT LET ME PLAY IT ON MY PS3 DO ANYBODY KNOW WHY I GOT PACIFIC PEOPLE THAT i DL FROM CAUSE THERE GOOD AND IT JUST WANT PLAY ON THE PS3 DO ANYBODY KNOWS WHY
,zoggnoff,2010-03-16T11:34Z,"If it won't play on your PS3 then it's probably encoded for a TV System that your device doesn't support. In the USA the TV System used is NTSC, abroad it's PAL. load the VIDEO_TS folder into ImgBurn and let us know which type it is by looking at the ""TV System:"" descriptor on ImgBurn Log, you have to click the calculator button first. I am curious which it is because I can't play the PAL type. you can convert it with IfoEdit, DVDsanta and VobBlanker but it's a painfully slow process and takes up another 10gb of hard disk space durring conversion."
,zoggnoff,2010-03-16T11:42Z,"you can strip the subtitle out with IfoEdit. open up VTS_01_0.IFO, click Vob Extras, browse to a temp destination folder, click ok then a window will pop up with audio and subtitle track(s), uncheck the subtitle then click Strip It. This will create all new ifo, bup and vob files. takes approx. 30 minutes, rename the temp directory to VIDEO_TS then burn with ImgBurn's Build Mode."
