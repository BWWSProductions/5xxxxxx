,godswallops,2010-03-05T15:04Z,"This looks like a great story, but there is no English audio.

Anyone know of Eng subtitles?"
[V],GoodFilms,2010-03-05T18:30Z,"Did you not see the link in the description?
And of course there is not English audio - it's a German movie."
[V],GoodFilms,2010-03-06T00:16Z,"Suck my dick, mosmooth. I, being a true cinephile, know a hell of a lot more about what I upload than some kid who thinks that I'm a thief (and even creates multiple accounts to try and hit his moronic message home - haha). Little biatch."
,godswallops,2010-03-06T05:56Z,I think I'll pass on this one.
[V],GoodFilms,2010-03-06T14:12Z,"mosmooth. absolutely EVERYTHING you say is complete nonsense.

Firstly, this BDRip is much better than that DVDSCR (LOL), and the DVDSCR has a blurry watermark that wrecks the picture.

Secondly, the other torrent you mention is simply this torrent upload at another site (after I uploaded it here - LOL). Yet more proof that you know nothing about anything.

Thirdly, you know nothing about anything, and nobody cares to read your nonsense.

Get a fucking brain."
[V],GoodFilms,2010-03-06T15:26Z,Can someone please remove this MPAA troll from the site?
[V],GoodFilms,2010-03-06T15:40Z,"@mosmooth. You are wrong, as always. It is a BDRip. Fucking moron. Also, read your post. You were talking about the ""DVDRIP"" first, which is the same torrent as this BDRIP, just mislabeled. The DVDSCR was uploaded months ago, but as mentioned, the quality is truly inferior.

And I don't know what CHTV is, but I suppose it's yet another figment of your imagination.

Here's a challenge for you: If this is a ""stolen"" torrent (lol), where was it uploaded first? Also, do you think that -LCHD, -AaF, -XPRESS, -CiNEFiLE, -BestHD, -hV, -LOATHING, -METiS, -REVEiLLE, -CULTHD, -Japhson, -DIMENSION, -AMIABLE, -SiNNERS, -THUGLiNE, -aBD, -D3Si, -EOS, -CROSSBOW, -MAGiCViBE, -ROLLERGiRL, -SEPTiC etc upload torrents? Do you think that they uploaded their torrents and I reuploaded them as my own work? Do you think that, mosmy? Do you have a brain, mosmy? Do you know how to you use google, mosmy? Do you know how the find out about the warez scene?

You are wrong about everything, always have been, and always will be ;)"
,M0e09,2010-03-06T17:04Z,"@israelis_r_filth: there are many german movies that are not about the holocaust... stereotypes suck ^^

@mosmooth: don't you have anything better to do? stop whining and stfu... everything in the filesharing world that is protected under copyrights is stolen and as long as GoodFilms doesn't say that he encoded the movies himself it's not a big deal... -.-
If you don't like it, don't download it, as usual..."
[V],GoodFilms,2010-03-08T06:34Z,"Not a word you speak is true. Your words are intriguing and truly confusing. I am astounded that someone so pretentious knows so little. I can only assume you smoke something weally bonkers.

Lost for words... "
[V],GoodFilms,2010-03-08T21:33Z,"No, mosmooth. No no no."
[V],GoodFilms,2010-03-09T02:29Z,Powerful
,M0e09,2010-03-09T17:15Z,it's gotten so quiet in here... who or what could have caused this to happen... xD
,goffyoflegend,2010-03-18T02:34Z,"mosmooth still on the warpath then?
i'll bet that..........
1) he has no friends
2) spends at least 3 hours a day having a go at goodfilms
3)sucks massive amounts of cock
4)has some serious mental issues
5)needs to get a grip
6)is unaware of how short life is and that we dont have enough time to waste on stupid bitterness.
7)has not realised that not a single person on TPB gives a shit about his retarded opinion and is therefore wasting his time!
YOU SUCK. YOU CHILDISH ARSEHOLE!
keep up the good work goodfilms!"

,dj-test,2010-07-16T12:27Z,"This one seems to be the only one in correct aspect ratio (1:85). Don\'t know if others are squeezed/stretched or just cut, but I recommend this one."
,true_evil,2010-09-09T21:46Z,"Very pixelated picture, looks awful. You should have made a bigger file. 

I'll try the CMCT Bluray."
,luisoi,2011-01-04T03:35Z,"Hi I'm from Brazil so I'm sorry for my bad english.
here in Brazil we have web sites dedicated to create subtitles for foreign language films, I do not believe that there exists in America is not anything like that.
So great movie, great torrent, thank you GoodFilms.
Ps I'm by using the google translator.
