Hitman: Contracts

Hitman: Contracts takes you back, deeper into the mind of Agent 47.
Enter his world of crime, sin and greed. Encounter his greatest adversaries, completing the work that made him so ruthlessly efficient and deadly precise, the ones that shaped him as an assassin.
Travel anywhere the work requires, to assignments in Paris, Hong Kong, Siberia, England and many more.
Understand, nothing counts except the target, anyone can make the perfect hit.
