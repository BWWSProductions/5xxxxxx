                      Notes:

                      Major mainstyle alert! The Beat
                      Controller is a young, but already
                      well-experienced Dutch DJ and party
                      organizer (Confusion Events). Besides
                      his dj skills, he already made himself
                      a name with the track "Handz on my
                      ballz" in cooperation with Angerfist.
                      The track was released on the last
                      Angerfist album "Mutilate"
                      Now it's time for his first solo EP.
                      Both original tracks are rather hard &
                      kickin', but yet still melodic and
                      absolutely dancefloor-orientated.
                      Distorted Revelation, known for their
                      successful releases on KNOR, deliver a
                      stunning remix in their unique own
                      style which will also do well on the
                      floor.
