,shasham,2010-09-20T13:35Z,Thanks to the uploader for this! I too own the CD and I've just discovered that I somehow neglected to copy it when I moved to France. WTF??? :) So thanks a lot. (Too bad about the first track if this is still messed up. Any way to fix? :) Cheers!

just like the other guys, i also bought the original, but somehow it magically dissapeared. usually is against my principles to approach music torrents, since i buy all my music, infact i have the original cds for all my 300gb of mp3 library. i convert all my originals, but i don't know how it happened that i forgot to do it with this album, and then it just dissapeared. so i bought it again, and it got stolen. then, when buying it again, the dog chew on it, then the cat scratched the next one, then i forgot it in the microwave owen, then the plane i was flying crashed and, though i survived, the cd was lost. then i bought another one in DC, but i visited the president and he likes gallo so i i gave the cd to him as a present. then i couldn't find the cd anymore, so i got here and, afters a few hours of prayers for forgiveness and looking at the download link like it was the gate to hell, i clicked  on it with a shaking hand and a heart full of self-hatred. but i'll make it up to vincent, i swear! i'll buy 10 copies of the disc next time i enter the music shop."
