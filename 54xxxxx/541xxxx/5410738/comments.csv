,Angri1,2010-03-05T14:53Z,"Thanks go to HMVinyl . . 

Mush appreciated!"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-03-05T21:27Z,"@nick1216 coverart is included in the folder, but not tagged to the songs.."
[V],HMVinyl,2010-03-07T02:19Z,whats the difference between that and this? i think Pirate's Progress is the only extra track...
[V],HMVinyl,2010-03-07T07:23Z,"too be honest i got pirates progress from a friend, and just threw it in there. i dont have an itunes account, or at leased on with cash on it, so i think you'll have to wait for someone else to pop one out..."
,Silver-Mask,2010-03-07T13:45Z,"what is the best way to tag the cover art to the mp3 file, without the ""folder"" or ""album art"" hidden files..."
[V],HMVinyl,2010-03-07T16:19Z,"install dbpoweramp, it has a shell extention that allows you to right click on an audio file and edit it's id3tags, in there you'll find an option for album art."
,escos,2010-03-07T20:04Z,or you could use mp3tag aswell!thanks for upload...great stuff
