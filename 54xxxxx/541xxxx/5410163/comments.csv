install with the @username and activation key given in the 'Readme first!!' Juicer3, then after mounting the three disks of Digital Juice Fonts on desktop, launch Juicer3 and choose in menu File 'Install Product'. The path to the mounted disks of fonts will be found, and when asked to register, just rewrite down the @username and activation key for Juicer3 given with the previous download.
