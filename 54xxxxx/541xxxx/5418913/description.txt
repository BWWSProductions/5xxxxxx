Step this way if youâ€™re a fan of the heavy duty action / mystical thrillers such as the excellent Nightwatch and Daywatch from Russia (made by the same team behind this) or maybe The Matrix â€“ which has inspired so many films to up their â€˜OMG actionâ€™ moments.

The Interceptor is another spectacular fusion of a fantasy parallel world where a mystic brotherhood balance the forces of good and evil and the real world where Russian Special Forces operative Matvey (Igor Petrenko) is double crossed and left for dead by his weapon dealing â€˜partnerâ€™.
