Ripped from much music VHF archive. If you have the glasses it really works.

In 1990 I created a group of three 3-D music videos for the Rolling Stones during their Steel Wheels tour. I used tour performances of three of their classic songs: 2,000 Light Years from Home, Paint it black and Only Rock and Roll. 2,000 Light Years was a revival of a track from the very psychedelic 1960's Satanic Magesties Request album, which originally came with a 3-D cover photo. This song was my opportunity to create wildly spinning space effects. Here you see Mick Jagger holding a spinning tornado on his hand. (tornado generated for me by computer video guru Tom DeWitt). Of course this anaglyph only gives the most basic feeling of the video. The videos were broadcast in June 1990 on the Fox Network as part of a Rolling Stones special.
