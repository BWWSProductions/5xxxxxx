        Simon Cowell. In an interview with Simon Cowell, Piers talks 
        to his fellow Britain's Got Talent judge about becoming one  
        of the most influential figures in the TV industry on both   
        sides of the Atlantic. After starting out as a postboy with  
        EMI, Cowell has gone on to launch acts such as Westlife and  
        become a global name through his work as a judge on reality  
        shows such as The X Factor and American Idol.
