,Bujaaa,2010-03-07T08:56Z,Activate iso.
,Bujaaa,2010-03-07T08:57Z,Boot all waves. Not just wave 4.

Wrong and wrong again.

1. Bootdisk have no waves. It flag your IX 1.6 to skip reading waves.

2. Upgrade to 1.61 is not the only alternative. One alternative is paching but only for banned console.

3. Bootdisk Do not alter Stealth in any way.

4. But we dont know if the disk in some way can be detected by MS. So use it carefull.

,pickled_egg,2010-03-07T14:00Z,"Yes it will boot all waves but unless you have a really old flash you only get problems with wave4. (my old system with iXtreme 1.51 is still loading all new wave4 games but my new system on 1.6 wan't read without this disc.

As for the stealth. This disc skips the video/update part of the loading process (the bit we identify the wave version with) & thus will always flag you on XBoxLive

Patching games works for some but some of the drives won't boot patched disc's. (mine included)

If you have one of the drives like mine & don't have iXtrme 1.61 or LT & you get the 'Play DVD' message on wave4 games then you will need to upgrade your flash or use this disc to load any wave4 game"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-07T15:54Z,"The only version that boots with out actv.iso(all waves) is Xtreme 1.51 (Hitachi) this version have already the so called ""wave skip"". 

iXtreme 1.51 (BenQ/LiteOn/Samsung dont have it.

I have 3 consoles and one is with IX 1.6 and i have never hade any probs back then/now play backups that i pached to wave 3 from wave 4,6 etc..Same for 5 of my friends(all have IX 1.6). I have pached lots of games for them and never heard they complain they cant play em. I also test the games on my IX 1.6 before i gice them out. And IX 1.6 Only support up to wave 3.

Stealth:

The cd still do not alter Stealth in any way. Its in general same function that IX LT have now. But what is very importen in all this. Is that every copy of game must be ""Verified"" by abgx360. If you get a bad copy of the game you still can play it and make it easy for MS to flag your console. Thats why i always saying that patching is also a 100% way to get banned. 
But patching is a good way for ppl on banned console and are lazy/cant/lack of knowledge to flash."
,pickled_egg,2010-03-11T23:20Z,"Stealth is the term we use when the flash on the 360 tells LIVE that the video partition is correct.
Wave 4 games have an update in this partition instead of video.
This boot disc uses the Partition from a wave3 game thus it reports incorrectly when used with a wave4 game.

Anyone who knows how things work will know PLAY ONLINE & YOU WILL GET BANNED.
If you're lucky it will take a while from time you are flagged to being banned but it can be within seconds.

DO NOT LISTEN TO IDIOTS WHO SAY IT'S SAFE

If you use this to boot a Wave1, Wave2 or Wave4 game you WILL be banned.
If you Convert the wave of any game it will get you banned.

This disc & the Alternative Wave Converters are for playing off line only

IF ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO ARGUE,  GO DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE"
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-12T13:34Z,"This is a quote from (abgx360):

[quote]
IF you are on iXtreme 1.6, you can ALSO play Wave 4 and above games, however you need to use a special activation disk to do so. This was added to the firmware specifically for this eventuality - the disk activates ""one-shot-boot"" mode, essentially it allows iX1.6 to boot any game you insert into the drive, even if its not properly stealthed. You simply insert the disk into the drive, let it spin up (it will say ""play DVD""), then swap in your Wave4 game. You will need to do this each time you want to play a Wave 4 (or above) game. Don't worry, if the game has all the necessary stealth data, then iX1.6 will still use it, so if you boot a VERIFIED Wave4 game using this method, you should be just as safe as you were booting a verified wave 3 game.[/quote]

There is absolute none proof that ppl got banned last ban wave for useing the actv.iso.

The ""firmware specifically IX 1.6"" was that it have ""wavex boot""= flag your fw to skip read waves. 

And one more thing read what im typing before going of. I NEVER sade that its safe in any form. Use any moding in any form can get you banned, MS are not stupid!, and they have show it clear last ban wave by 1mill banned consoles. And still going strong."

No HATERS"
,ColbyCannon,2011-04-24T03:23Z,"muz - to play back-ups you must flash your dvd drive, there are a lot of tutorials online and on youtube, but it is best to take it to a pro and should run about $40.  Firmware is flashed on to your dvd drive replacing the original firmware.  The name of the firmware is ixtreme and there are several versions - I believe the latest is LT.  However if you don't have the latest version you need this boot disk (like me).  
Pickled_egg - thanks for the upload - I will seed until we get the next xbox!"
,ColbyCannon,2011-04-24T05:08Z,"Just tried it - works great with all games tried so far... motion sports, need 4 speed hot pursuit, body and brain, dance central... Thanks a lot!!"
