The director must of made porn before this flick. 

When there is blood and guts pouring out in a fight scene the girls open there mouth up to get as much of it in there mouth, just like the end of any stick movie.

Thanks AiTB"

,martialis,2010-03-08T17:21Z,"Space marines - I mean, search and rescue go down into the caves to rescue the women and then bad things happen.  It's ok.  It's not great, it's just ok."
,mapget,2010-03-09T08:22Z,thank you men!!!
,toastfighter,2010-03-09T11:12Z,"Great copy, but I think I would have been better off just watching the first one twice in a row. "
,Eglar,2010-03-10T09:51Z,You dont have to be a critic to see whats wrong with this movie. If you chase someone in a cave system your reason would not lead you to belive that the person who is a couple of seconds ahead of you would go through a passage with a sandy floor that has no marks on it and the roof is ready to cave causing you to crawl and take your time through it. Why not keep moving forward? duh. Obviously they/he/she dident go that way!
,Eglar,2010-03-10T10:29Z,"lol no wait, its now obvious that ""she"" has nothing to do with it... shes inncoent yet lets handcuff myself to her and cross a unstable rock formation that can only support one person. Good thing to or the person who obviously dident kill anyone would get away."
,jlsmetalhead,2010-03-10T20:36Z,"Thanks. 


*seelcitysy*  You Are A Moron, Your Comment Made No Sence Whatsoever. U Got It From Another Site And Was Going To Upload It For Us, But U Downloaded It Here Anyway.  What The Fuck? If You Were Gonna Upload It Here Then Why Did You Download It From Here.

Fucking Dumbass!!!!  A Waste Of Comment Space!"
,allenb28,2010-03-11T07:17Z,"good movie for a sequal

,martialis,2010-03-12T00:49Z,"jlsmetalhead,

,gregum123,2010-03-13T03:35Z,@ martialis .... lol.
,coleix,2010-03-17T02:23Z,Thanks man. How good is this movie anyway?
,bmxjuh,2010-03-18T10:11Z,"good audio/video quality.

good movie with a good 10-min twist about juuno.

but then i guess you just can't expect a ""good"" ending for this kind of movies.

overall, not a complete waste of time.
thanks for sharing."
,billz999,2010-03-19T19:21Z,"Video and Audio are not 9 or 10 out of 10... More like a 6 or 7.  Audio is VERY low (I had to crank my speakers & Windows volumes to full) and the video is heavily compressed and artifact-laden.  For a film that happens mostly in the dark and dust, those artifacts get pretty distracting.  I grabbed this because the 720P was taking forever.  I sort of wish I'd waited."
,tsafa,2010-03-20T11:05Z,thanks!!

,devasko,2010-03-21T22:44Z,"The movie title is wrong. This isnÂ´t a decent movie at all. The most undecent scene is when the cop and the psycho are standing in a pool of shit and get shit on by one of the canadians. Realy Sick stuff, not decent at all."
