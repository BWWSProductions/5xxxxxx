1) do not spam comments with your bullshit. We don't care if you run a site full of trojans and malware with the promise of ~streaming the video online~ your site is not better and is full of adware and viruses. gtfo and quit commenting every goddamn top 100 torrent with your advertisements. 

2) Stop spamming with the OMFG DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS THE PARTYVAN IS WATCHIN U bullshit. Columbia/Paramount/Tristar/FBI does not give a shit. You won't get fucking V& for downloading a torrent. The worst that will happen is you'll get a cease and desist notice or they'll block you at your IP and you can just switch providers. STFU and GTFO. Why are you even here, you noobs.

3) Don't expect to get any A/V quality better than a TS or a CAM if the film's still in theaters. Jesus, are you people retarded? either wait for it to come out on video for a better rip or stfu until you can contribute something better.

4) the main purpose of comments on these sites is to warn other users whether a torrent is legit. If it's spam, if the sound or video quality is so bad it's unwatchable, or if it's got malware. This is not he site for your shitty, pseudo-intellectual review tripe. Save that shit for your emo livejournal. Any other comments are useless here.

The video is pretty close to dvd quality, and the audio is good enough to watch this without too much trouble. 
If you are wanting to see this movie badly, this will do. 
As always, special thanks to the uploader, and to the haters out there, get a fuckin life you losers. This shit is free and you have no standing to sit here and bitch and moan about something that you literally did nothing to contribute to. "

,belgie,2010-05-02T14:03Z,"Apparently, not everyone is using the terms R5 and DVD Rip in the same way.

Some people think DVD-Rip in the title means that it's too big to burn to a CD, instead of being sourced from an official DVD. 

Some people think R5 means CAM, instead of DVD Region 5.

The worst part is, the people who put these torrents together aren't interested in accurate labelling. They are only interested in getting the most number of seeders/leachers like it's some competition. So they will never correctly label something like this, as ""Lightning Thief - Cam version - shitty audio"""

lots of static and clicks through out the movie and it doesn't sink-up in 2 or 3 spots for awhile.  save your time and skip this one PLUS it doesn't even show the credits and there is a teaser in them......
