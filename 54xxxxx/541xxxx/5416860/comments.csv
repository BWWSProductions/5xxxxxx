Thanks man!"

,charlestoast,2010-03-07T18:33Z,"I'm loving the SpeedTV live coverage, which means we get to see every lap of every heat, including the LCQ, as well as the main event. HD makes such a difference too, and slicknick, you're doing a great job, especially getting the torrents up so soon after the races! You must have a storming fast pc! If your encoder allows you to use x264, you ought to try it - it's even better than h264! Just do a short sample and compare it for yourself."
,mxseb,2010-03-07T18:51Z,Thanks a lot Slicknick !
,dmitri614,2010-03-07T19:26Z,SUPER!!!!
,slicknick610,2010-03-07T20:01Z,"@ charlestoast

Actually it is in x264. I forgot to change it. I put this up at 4am my time. They did not show the LCQs this week. Always know that I cut no racing out of the videos. I show what they show."

,charlestoast,2010-03-08T14:13Z,"hey slicknick, I wrote my comment before I'd finished downloading the file!

You are doing a fantastic job, especially getting the torrents up so quickly!

Shame they didn't show the LCQ's,  but that's hardly your fault! (but SpeedTV, really!)

in 2009, when I put up most of the season in x264, though only SD, I cut out all the fluff and did only the racing - but this year with all the rookies, it's worth seeing the Pit Pass.

To all those who cried out for seeds - patience is all you need, seeds were soon up to 500 and more. "

any chance for the last tgo?"
,mx_phreek,2010-03-09T14:36Z,"Thx slick, but for some reason the audio goes out of sync when i fast forward or rewind. They look good thou. Im playing these with my media player, wd tv connected to tv. Had no sync problem with your 8 other rounds just this one."
,slicknick610,2010-03-10T00:59Z,"@ moups

no i don't have the new tgo.

@mxphreek

I either use ffdshow with wmp or vlc and they work fine for me"
,motomikeuk,2010-03-10T22:24Z,"Thanks a ton SlickNick, you're the best!"
,mx_phreek,2010-03-11T22:41Z,"Never mind, after a quick look around google i found the problem, its not ur new encoding, i updated my media player to latest firmware and its a bug in it, the audio runs out of sync on mp4 files.. wasn't a problem till i updated last week. the bitch is you cant roll it back to a early'r version which piss's me off, wish i never updated now as it was running perfect before. Grr!!"
,moups,2010-03-12T10:56Z,"ok slicknick610, keep the good work on the next round and hope you will continue for the outdoors series."
