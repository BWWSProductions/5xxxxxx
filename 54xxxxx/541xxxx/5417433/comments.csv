and why was there a unist.exe file inside it ?"
,n3o91,2010-03-10T13:53Z,I think it is because the real zygor guide is an instal (exe) file. I saw an screenshot where they showed install menu somewhere. So I guess this is one who just copied the addon folders after the install.

""""is this real ??

yes this is real and the real zygor guide includes a install.exe and a uninstall.exe.. i dident know that that uninstall.exe was there.. dident check inside the folders that much but its real for sure 
and a exe is just for uninstall but you dont have to run it... and if your worried that its a virus or something just remove it without executing it :) and it cant harm you"
,svetlania09,2010-03-19T02:56Z,"Indeed, the real installer comes as an executable but no offense I would be a little worried.  It is much easier to just extract the installer from Zygor and repack and post the actual addon files just so people don't get turned away."
,svetlania09,2010-03-19T02:59Z,"And now that I actually downloaded it to investigate it, it is definitely legit.  I'd just remove the .exe file before posting it so you don't scare people off.  :)"
