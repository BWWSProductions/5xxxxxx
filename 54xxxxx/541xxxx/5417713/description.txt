Michael Palin goes in search of the crew of the wooden dhow Al Shama, featured in his hit documentary series Around the World in 80 Days. He begins his search in Dubai, which has been transformed since he was last there in 1988, before moving on to Mumbai, where he learns of the dhow's fate. Booking himself onto the Kutch Express, he travels far north, hoping to be reunited with the men with whom he forged a special bond, and on whom his life depended twenty years ago.
