Ernest Hemingway Reads

The Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech
In Harry's Bar in Venice and Other of his Writings


"A writer must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day," says Ernest Hemingway in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech. Eternity Hemingway certainly has secured for himself with his internationally renowned body of work. In this collection, however, he reads some of his lesser-known pieces, including the Nobel speech, a poem, and even a work in progress, most of which were recorded in Cuba. Although his readings of his own work seem timidly rigid at times, this tape represents a rare opportunity for Hemingway fans and nonfans alike, as it is one of the only known recordings of the writer's voice. 


"A writer should write what he has to say and not speak it," noted Ernest Hemingway, toward the end of his Nobel prize acceptance speech. Especially, he might have added, when it is recorded badly on obsolete equipment and the writer sounds like he may have had a few drinks. Nor are these selections taken from his best work. "Second Poem to Mary," "Harry's Bar in Venice," a short excerpt from The Fifth Column, something called "Work in Progress" (Islands in the Stream), and "Saturday Night at the Whorehouse in Billings, Montana" comprise the other selections.
