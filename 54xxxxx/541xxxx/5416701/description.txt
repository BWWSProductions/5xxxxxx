NightFire takes inspiration from several of the best 007 moments across the years. In the completely original storyline, the super-spy finds himself on the trail of a corrupt businessman who's hatched a plan to use a secret weapon to destroy the world. Bond's quest to stop the terrorist before he can do any harm takes him across the world through a variety of first-person shooter and driving levels, deep into the ocean, and soaring into space. Much of the game (including the four-player multiplayer mode) is played in the first-person perspective, but there are also racing action stages that utilize the Need for Speed game engine.
