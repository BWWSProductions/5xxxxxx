___________________________________

Queen â€“ one of the greatest-ever supergroups. 
Queen have never before allowed their music to be used in a 
collaboration with a newspaper, but founder members Brian May 
and Roger Taylor have worked with The Mail on Sunday to produce 
this very special album. 

The CD features ten full Queen tracks, including Killer Queen, 
Donâ€™t Stop Me Now and the fantastic anthem We Will Rock You, 
all sung by Freddie Mercury, the iconic superstar who tragically 
died in 1991.
