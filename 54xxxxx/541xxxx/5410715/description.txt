"Already a serious contender for album of the year, this sophomore effort by Montrealâ€™s Malajube is the best francophone indie-rock release in recent memory. Catchy, heavy, light, playful and exhilarating - it rocks non-stop, and in a multitude of ways. The underlying theme of sickness runs through the disc like death did the Arcade Fireâ€™s Funeral. But itâ€™s filtered through textured, sweeping and frequently beautiful songwriting. Guests include rappers Loco Locass, singer Pierre Lapointe and Dears members Martin Pelland and Valerie Jodoin-Keaton. This is a big record, a great record, by what could very well be your new favourite Montreal band." 4.5/5 (Tâ€™Cha Dunlevy, The Gazette)
