I made this back in 2003 using Sony sound forge, Sony acid and Reason w/ the platform for the music control being done in Sony acid. I just found it and had to share. I meant to make it an hour but, the files are all long gone and all I'm left w/ is this 20min (ish) live performance. Man, I give mad props to those who pump out track after track...takes some real patience.
SEED SEED SEED!!!!   (please)   ;)
