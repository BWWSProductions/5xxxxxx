A Night at the Family Dog (1970) Santana, Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane

Released in 2005, this video captures three of the most influential bands of the day, during a time when they were doing some of their best live performances. Filmed at San Francisco's legendary Family Dog Ballroom in September 1970, A NIGHT AT THE FAMILY DOG is one incredible night of performances from Santana, the Grateful Dead, and Jefferson Airplane and one of the few Dead performances captured featuring original member Ron "Pig Pen" McKernan. 

Noted jazz columnist and Rolling Stone co-founder Ralph J. Gleason took note of the exploding rock music scene and produced several television specials and documentaries spotlighting the music emerging from San Francisco. A Night At The Family Dog is part of a series (the others are Go Ride The Music & West Pole) that aired on The National Educational Television Network in the early 1970â€™s. 

This is not a documentary. There are no voiceovers, no backstage interviews, and not much in the way of audience interaction. It's just an hour's worth of the kind of music that reminds us why we felt compelled to even consider putting flowers in our hair. The sound quality (upgraded from its original mono to 5.1 Surround) is excellent.
