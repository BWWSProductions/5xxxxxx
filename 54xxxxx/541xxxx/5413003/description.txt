From back cover:

Murders in a Moscow park are Chirf Inspectors Arkady Renko's beat, and at first, the case of the bodies in a Moscow park looked straightforward enough: a â€œtroika,â€ probably, three on a bottle, drunk together then frozen together in the brutal Russian night. Arkady Renko hits a sharp and complicated turn with the arrival of the KGBâ€™s Pribluda. Suddenly, his access to a routine investigation is blocked. Why? And by whom?

Gorky Park is a 1981 crime novel written by Martin Cruz Smith set in the Soviet Union. It follows Arkady Renko, a chief investigator for the Militsiya, who is assigned to a case involving three corpses found in Gorky Park, an amusement park in Moscow, who have had their faces and fingertips cut off by the murderer to prevent identification.
A popular film based on the novel was made in 1983.
