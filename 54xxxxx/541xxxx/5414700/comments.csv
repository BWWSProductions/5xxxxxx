[V],HMVinyl,2010-03-06T14:23Z,"at that size you really shoud just encode the files in xvid, x264 files are usually used on large file sizes, and high resolutions. try testing your rips on a 40-50 inch screen and you'll see why."
[V],RiddlerA,2010-03-06T16:04Z,"@ HNVinyl

I Agree, but my uploads are not meant for 40 -50 inch Screens
My uploads are best for up to 22"" screens only
The basic aim of my uploads is to provide good quality stuff for really small sizes
I cater to audience having slow net speed, but who still want goood quality stuff"
