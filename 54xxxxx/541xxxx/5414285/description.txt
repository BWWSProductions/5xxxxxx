In the 1990s Ecstasy seemed to come out of nowhere to join marijuana, cocaine and heroin as one of the four most widely used illegal drugs in the country. No other drug has ever spread so fast. "Peter Jennings Reporting - Ecstasy Rising" tells the definitive story of how an obscure compound, discovered in 1912 and all but forgotten for over 60 years, became the drug of choice for a generation. "Ecstasy Rising" includes significant original reporting and first-time interviews with all the major players: the chemist who first reported the effects of Ecstasy; the California psychotherapists who treated patients with Ecstasy when it was still legal; the Dallas businessman who gave Ecstasy its name and turned it into a recreational drug; the drug enforcement officer who led the fight to make Ecstasy illegal; and the DJ who spread Rave and Ecstasy across America.
