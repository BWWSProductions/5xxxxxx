,Bliep,2010-04-14T06:30Z,Great quality! And this is an uncut version! There are scenes here which I don't have on my official DVD! Thanks! And this Hatter (Andrew-Lee Potts) ROCKS!
,TymonTheThief,2012-03-05T05:43Z,"I was actually going to buy the DVD version of this...but I did some research... They chopped off almost 5 minutes worth of scenes to save on production costs. You do this crap which, honestly, would screw over your customers, and you wonder why people pirate your stuff instead of pay money for it. Screw you, entertainment industry. "
