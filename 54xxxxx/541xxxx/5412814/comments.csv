yeah, just mount it. 

@lokland
the installer is in russian but if you know the usual button layout than it's easy. there is a option to pick russian or english after like picking where to install the files in. "

But here is my problem, the cutscenes seem to all play in slow-motion. I have the requirements in my computer, and I have the lowest settings. Is this just me? If so, what's the solution? It's kinda annoying, the game is just fine though."

Any ideas?

Cheers! :)"
,TTopCamaro,2010-05-13T16:43Z,"I don't understand why, but every time I try to install this after mounting it, it keeps erroring out when installing audio files. It gets about 1/3 of the way done, (on the green bar) and then starts giving errors.. I started just ignoring them, figuring the audio's not really all THAT important to me. I just wanted to play the game.. But now it's frozen completely, and it won't go any further. Any ideas?"
