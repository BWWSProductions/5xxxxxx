,claws1986,2010-03-06T21:47Z,can i play online with that or just lan
,bobalazs,2010-03-07T13:51Z,I think LAN ONLY most likely
,bobalazs,2010-03-11T10:19Z,"def. a false positive avira thinks its fine.
Prevx pops it up as a virus, don't worry about it.
These things are coded, that way most keygens pop up as virus anyway."
,potatoz,2010-04-14T23:04Z,"Legit.
 Thanks."
,Budge4,2010-04-16T17:20Z,"Thanks for keygen, 1.05 up and running."
,patrioticparadox,2010-04-19T05:06Z,I would feel free to say thanks. Except you asked me too. So
,patrioticparadox,2010-05-01T04:41Z,"And then I came crawling back to your up in desperate need. Just shows you not to be a douche on the internet for no reason. Good up bobalazs.
Thanks and sorry
Can confirm virus free. If you will notice in the above post they are almost all heuristic or generic these are false positives caused by the way the program is coded. run this in Sandboxie and you will see it doesn't attempt to affect anything it shouldn't.
If you don't know what Sandboxie is, its worth looking into."

Dont Download -_- Trojan inside"
,seekers999,2010-06-08T09:34Z,"Every (well almost) Key Gen I've ever seen showed up as a virus, trojan, or other when checked. IMHO it's something in the programming that flags the virus checkers. You can only check for the obvious and go by the comments of users."
,themabus,2010-06-30T11:24Z,"not a good keygen
- language is coded in serial and sometimes generated code will lock game to some foreign language
- it will pass installation and game will run but it won't pass FADE
you can check at firing range - try to hit 15 targets with rifle 
and, if you can do that, try to hit anything at all with pistol

when FADE is not triggered, it's easy to hit more than 20 targets with rifle
and pistol misses only occasionally

use those serials instead:
61GJ-K7RGA-FLCYE-8M86T-SMPLH
(86 0f 39 40 26 aa 1d e6 51 ea 8d 2f 5c e8 c8)
this serial work up to version 1.04, and likely following betas until 1.05

J784-0JHR8-EDKPP-AJ61X-6C6BB
(c4 64 02 20 f2 92 af 79 b5 c8 5a cc c3 74 26)
this serial work up to version 1.05 and following betas until 1.07
(verified with 71749; 1.07 is 71750 so likely blacklist is all they updated)
but this one will be locked to Polish language (written text, most speech still in English)

for versions up to 1.04 you'll also need cracked exe to bypass SecuROM
starting from 1.05 don't need cracked exe any more, just valid serial

you can get beta patches at www.arma2.com/beta-patch.php
you can get cracks at www.gamecopyworld.com"
,themabus,2010-06-30T11:31Z,"game is very glitchy, i had freezes and script errors still in 1.05
and saves change sometimes, e.g. saves from 1.05 won't work on 1.07
so i'd suggest everyone to patch to 71749 
and use Polish serial for now"
,themabus,2010-06-30T17:09Z,"to get 1.07 going with English, FADE-free:
- use Polish serial to patch to version 1.07
- change registry entry 'KEY', located at
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bohemia Interactive Studio\ArmA 2
to:
00 7b 32 30 86 0a 3b d5 45 d1 24 92 c6 29 a8"

,eeepc700x,2010-08-18T13:21Z,such a cool locking keygen
,stephan692,2010-09-07T05:13Z,someone email me one please stephan692@yahoo.com it don't work on 64 bit computers
,anderst5,2011-05-19T16:01Z,thaaaanks!!!!
,seres69,2011-05-23T16:19Z,thx worked
