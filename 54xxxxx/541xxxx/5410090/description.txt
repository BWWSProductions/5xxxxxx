To compliment the The (Almost) Complete Marvel Red Sonja torrent (available here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5407400/The_%28Almost%29_Complete_Marvel_Red_Sonja) uploaded by jollyship33 here is The Official Handbook of the Conan Universe as a .cbr.

Now I know that it is already included in the above torrent but I hate .pdf files.  I have discussed this with the original uploader, OedipussyRex, at ComicPirates and they requested I upload The Official Handbook of the Conan Universe as a .cbr.

The Official Handbook of the Conan Universe was a single issue published by Marvel Comics and released in 1986 covering the world of Conan. 



Released on http://ComicPirates.info
