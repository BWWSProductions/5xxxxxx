    [ Release Notes ]

      Episode 1: Description

      We live on a planet that is almost all ocean - a water planet that is
      unique among the cosmos.

      The ocean is what transformed the Earth into the livable, blue planet
      it is today. However, in the earths earliest history there was no ocean
       it was a red-hot planet of molten magma flashing through space.

      Where did all this water come from and how has the ocean shaped this
      planet over the last 4 billion years? The first episode in the One
      Ocean series, The Birth of an Ocean, reveals the transformative power
      of the ocean on this planet  and how the ocean drives everything on
      the Earth - from our temperate climate, to the air we breath to the
      land we walk on. No living creature could be here today if this
      dramatic event had never taken place.

      The ocean changed our atmosphere by slowly filling it with life-giving
      oxygen. Peter Ward, a paleontologist with the University of Washington,
      takes us to Shark Bay in Western Australia to discover stromatolites 
      an incredible bacterial formation which helped fill the ocean and later
      the atmosphere with oxygen.

      Oxygen would change everything by allowing multi-cellular life to evolve
      and then flourish in the watery depths. The Birth of an Ocean explores
      how a deadly chain of events was put into motion that caused oxygen to
      all but disappear from the ocean and atmosphere, launching a mass
      greenhouse extinction. As it turns out, most of the mass extinctions
      that have occurred were not caused by a massive asteroid, but by a tiny
      bacterium!

      The story of the ocean is the story of the beginning of life on the
      planet, mass extinctions and astonishing survival in one of the most
      beautiful and mysterious parts of the planet. One of the most astonishing
      stories of endurance is that of the nautulis - a 500 million year old
      living fossil - an incredible species that managed to survive all of the
      mass extinctions. Its an incredible story of survival but what are the
      adaptations and selective advantages that have allowed the nautilus to
      survive for so very long?

      The Birth of an Ocean joins paleontologist Ted Daeschler as he reveals
      the secrets of the fossil Tiktaalik, the critical transitional species
      that first crawled out of the ocean and onto land. We see just how much
      of our own anatomy we share with this amazing creature.

      Ted Daeschler Were looking at Tiktaalik, we're looking at an animal
      that's really at the base of the branch of the tree of life that leads
      to all limbed animals, and we're a limbed animal.

      Ultimately The Birth of an Ocean reveals that the history of the ocean
      is our own history and that today we are just beginning to understand
      its complexity and the immense influence it has on the planet and our
      own survival.

      The series One Ocean is produced by CBCs the nature of things and
      Merit Motion Pictures, in association with National Geographic Channels
      International. The Birth of an Ocean is directed and written by Mike
      Downie and produced by Tina Verma. The Series Producer is Caroline
      Underwood and the Executive Producer is Michael Allder.
