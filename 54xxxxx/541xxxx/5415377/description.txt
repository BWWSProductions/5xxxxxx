This is not my rip. I couldn't find a torrent for this but i found a r*pidshare file with this film so I just up'd it here to save you all the trouble of searching like I did. I really enjoyed this one. Kinda reminded me of a Russ Meyer carsploitation flick.
I will seed this permanently but my utorrent doesn't run 24 hours a day every day. Some days it does though. I won't ever let my uploads die. More to come soon!
