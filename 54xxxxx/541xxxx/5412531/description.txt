1 LP and 1 EP on 1 CD: DARE! (1982)/LOVE AND DANCING EP.

It isnt overstating the case to call the Human Leagues third album 
synthpops SGT. PEPPER, not only did DARE! establish synthesizers as 
a viable musical tool on the US charts, it redefined what people 
thought of electronic pop. 

No longer did synth bands have to sound like Kraftwerk or Throbbing 
Gristle. There are no guitars on DARE! but its emphatically a pop 
record. 

Phil Oakeys gruff vocals blend surprisingly well with the untrained,
girlish voices of new backing vocalists Susanne Sulley and 
Joanne Catherall, and the electronic melodies are expertly rendered 
by producer Martin Rushent into three-dimensional pop extravaganzas. 

Musically witty and unfailingly exciting, tracks like "Love Action," 
"Open your Heart," "Sound of the Crowd" and of course "Don't You Want
 Me" are as catchy as pop got in 1981, and darker tracks like "Seconds" 
and "Do Or Die" add depth. DARE! is a brilliant album even today.

Ranked #69 in Q's 100 Greatest British Albums - This glorious daft 
creation is as Northern as FA Cup Giant killing....they conquer the 
world with a slightly wonky brand of techno that was more 
Norman Wisdom than Giorgio Moroder...
