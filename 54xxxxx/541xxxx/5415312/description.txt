Despite all technological advances, final mastery of any battlefield depends upon the tight-knit group of footsoldiers trained to maneuver, shoot and dig in. This first of a two-part study examines the methods by which the Western infantry of World War II - the German, British and US armies - actually brought their firepower to bear. Drawing upon period training manuals for the evolving theory, and on personal memoirs for the individual practice, this first book covers the organization and tactics of the squad of ten or a dozen men, and the platoon of three or four squads. The text is illustrated with contemporary photographs and diagrams, and with color plates bringing to life the movement of soldiers on the battlefield.
