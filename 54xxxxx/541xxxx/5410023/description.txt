Throughout his career, Bobby Timmons was typecast as a soulful and blues-oriented pianist due to his hits ("Moanin '," "This Here" and "Dis Dat").  But as he shows on this 1963 trio date (with either Sam Jones or Ron Carter on bass and drummer Connie Kay), Timmons was actually a well-rounded player when inspired.  The repertoire on his CD ranges from bop to spirituals, from three diverse originals to "Born to Be Blue."  This is excellent music but unfortunately Timmons would not grow much musically after this period.   His CD is worth picking up. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG

Bobby Timmons seems to be one of those jazz pianists that people seem to miss checking out.  I have heard listened to him for years, but have only recently bought any of his recordings as a leader.  "Born To Be Blue" is yet another release that has flown under the radar, but not checked out by jazz fans for whatever reason.  Timmons is joined either by Ron Carter or Sam Jones on bass and Connie Kay on drums. This is cookin' little album worth owning.  I think this album cover is one of the coolest I've ever seen too!  How could you not love Bobby Timmons?  Great jazz piano trio.  Highly recommended. ~ J. Rich
