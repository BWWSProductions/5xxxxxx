,pixiesmiles,2010-03-09T01:29Z,"hypothetical,  You're welcome!  *sending you your very own solitary branded butt whacker* to thank you for commenting.. ;o)"
,Tucluc_Licada,2010-03-09T03:01Z,Why is the last part scrambled? I mean the elimination speech.
,pixiesmiles,2010-03-09T06:43Z,"Tucluc_Licada, Wow, thank you for the heads up! Since I hadn't watched the show, I wasn't aware there was an issue. The glitch is present on the original file, so I assume it is a network issue, and was broadcast just the way you see it.  Sorry about that!  Fortunately its only messed up at the very end.  Would have been a major bummer if it happened before they revealed the contestant leaving the show. "
,aracnadei,2010-03-09T18:35Z,Thanks a bunch for upping these. One of the best shows on tv by far. 
,Tucluc_Licada,2010-03-09T23:50Z,I don't think it was. I found another file with lesser quality that didn't have this problem. If anyone is interested they might want to check that one out for the ending.
,pixiesmiles,2010-03-10T15:35Z,"Tucluc, You're correct, and I would suggest the same to others who really want to hear that contestants final words.  Again.. thanks for the heads up and sorry about the less than perfect torrent. "
,Sinant,2010-03-17T03:45Z,hope episode 7 comes out soon!
,that_guy_you_are,2010-09-07T09:58Z,"Hey could someone please re-seed for a bit? I'm on 91% for this one and it's the last one I need for the season!

Thanks so much for torrenting this one, pixiesmiles. Season three just started recently in Australia and I'm addicted!"
