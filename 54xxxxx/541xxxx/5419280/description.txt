Hello my fellow Solitarians!  Val is back!  I would love to give you a little teaser regarding this week's episode, however I have not yet watched it myself. I'm as much in the dark as you all are! :o)

So, who wants to join me for a night long Solitary marathon? I'll bring the Whips, Paddles and Bananas.. You all bring whatever STRIKES your fancy.  I have a hunch it's going to be an interesting evening.. *twinkling smiles* 

Enjoy the episode!

-a little reminder note to those who need it- My upload speed is slightly slower than snail paced. If you can't handle that, I both welcome AND highly encourage you supply these files to others yourself. Or... simply wait until there is a decent number of seeds available to better cater to your needs. ;o)
