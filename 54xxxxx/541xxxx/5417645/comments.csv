,unidogma,2010-03-31T23:57Z,"slasherman - if you read this can you stop asking me on my torrents where i got the movie from>? why does this matter to you? Please only comment on the quality of the torrents so others users can get some use from comments!!

Thank you!"
,SolaceG,2010-04-21T23:46Z,UNIDOGMA - asking you what the source of the torrent is not asking alot. That information should be freely given. And because of that im giving this a negative. I dont know if this is a cam source or a telesync or an r5/screener. 
,unidogma,2010-05-20T21:02Z,SolaceG What a silly childish person you are - You go ahead and give this a negative simply based upon your own EGO and not the quality of this torrent - how helpful that will be to downloaders I do not know!!!  Silly boy!!!
,unidogma,2010-05-20T21:04Z,SolaceG what a childish thing to do -  You go ahead and give this torrent a negative simply based upon your ego and not the actual quality which is good I may add - How that will help the downloaders of this torrent I dont know!! You silly little boy!!
