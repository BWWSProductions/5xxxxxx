-----

A classic introductory text for self-taught learners of the Persian (Farsi) language.  Very good introduction to the Persian alphabet and well-thought pacing and exercises.

This book gets excellent reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  It has become extremely hard to find since it was last printed in its original form in 1993.  The newer editions of the book, written by Narguess Farzad, are not nearly as well-regarded.
