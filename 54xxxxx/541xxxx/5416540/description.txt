Living in the Moment: Glorious Adventures and the Miracles That Can Unfold


During 2005 Lazaris explored four distinctively powerful avenues, four uniquely powerful ways, to develop rapport with illumination and thus to develop an alliance with the mystery and magic of illumination. Of those means, Living in the Moment is the most illusive and elusive; it is also potentially the most powerful. Gently, Lazaris guides us through a mystical terrain from conscious illumination, to establishing domain, infusing that domain with mystery, and then to expansion. 

Being a â€œgiantâ€ we create union and then enter the arcane mysticism of surrender - surrender without submission. It is an art. And then in a moment that is beyond description and full comprehension . . . Presence. We take the steps in a process that has no steps. It is amazing. And yet there are the practical expressions: spontaneity, beauty, hope, and working with our duality are combined with conscious/unconscious presence, illumination, and enlightenment. And when we are 
all done, we, as Lazaris points out, â€œwe chop wood.â€ This astounding evening ends with a powerful meditation in which Lazaris guides us through the steps of the stepless process. Yes. Living in the moment is a paradox. And in that truth lies amazing power and magic.

Being Understanding: Keys to Living the Exceptional Life (Evening Only)



And so began a sensational culminating weekend for the Year of Understanding. With Lazaris as our loving guide and companion, we journeyed into the dark depths and the even deeper light depths of mystery. As we visited our Battlefield and the ruins of our Dark Matrix, we gathered treasures and gifts we needed to create an amazing Tapestry of Magic. We went further into the dark of mystery and into our Dark Wood. Gathering additional ingredients, we fought our way out of that darkness into the light . . . to a Pinnacle of Celebration and Triumph. And then in ways that words cannot describe and in ways that we cannot fully comprehend, we were lifted upon that newly formed tapestry. Entering our personal Ring-Pass-Not we reached beyond to touch the grace . . . the grace of being understanding. "With the grace of understanding, we can soar; from the grace of understanding, we can become more." (Lazaris)

This recording, the Friday evening portion of this amazing weekend of magic, contains a detailed exploration of "the map." Lazaris outlines and annotates each step of the journey. This evening concludes with an enchanting meditation: Receiving & Renewing the Essence of Magic.
