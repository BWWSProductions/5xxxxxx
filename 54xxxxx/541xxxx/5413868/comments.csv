,ithurts,2010-03-06T11:20Z,"Instead of complaining, try to make the crack, or at least upload the game.

This game might be not cracked in the near future : all save are stored on ubisoft servers.
Rewriting the whole saving system will take time and might be impossible.

And if it is (impossible) we will have to wait one year or two for the ubisoft to close his servers and use offline save :).

But for now, All QQ'ers should die in extreme pain."

It will continue with no cdkey if done like this.

The crack does'nt work, it only helps to start the game but you can't play any mission.

2: For those of us who are die hard PC gamers I sat that we are sick and tired of being huddled into the corner, marginalized and overlooked for DAM consoles. Four months difference in release date is not just a slap in the face...its an insult of the highest level. Game companies do this and then they wonder why loyal PC gamers turn on them and download pirate copies, its cause we are shown no respect. 

I very much support the game industry, eg pre-ordered Mass Effect 2 collectors edition and would have done the same for this title, if they had not been assholes about it... reminds me of Force Unleashed. A big thumbs down for Ubisoft"

They did this internet shitty thing couze  they don't want that you can play this game on an illegal way.
I agree with you that this is fucked up.. Sometimes internet does'nt work or something and you can't play a damn singleplayer game.

It's weird but if they think they can stop the pirating of games on this way (wich won't work, couze everyone will try to crack these games) just let em go till they can see that it won't work! XD"
,FeAriou,2010-03-09T13:00Z,"@Baodrin, same attitude comes from 2k sports, 2knba, I even bought that game, but the game doesn't work properly and they still haven't made a single patch for PC, they have promised us a patch for 5 freakin' months. Consoles have got 2 patches already at same time. "

I bought the game 0305, and everything worked just fine ? for some time. You did well, Ubi, I thought. Those people in the net worry too much, I thought. 

Then things got worse. I was playing and then suddenly! that annoying message popped up ? wtf?! I thought. OK, I'm Russian, troubles with net connection is common here, my provider fucked up again, I thought. But no, web browser worked just fine, torrent-client worked just fine, everything worked just fine ? everything but that damned ubi protection system. 

Over and over again it disconnects, notify me my login/password are wrong, and if I'm lucky enough to see main menu, it doesn't mean I can load my game. And when it starts to work already, it's not funny to play expecting another crush.

So why did I bought AC2, if I have to seek for the crack in the net?

And don't diss Razor1911. that team has done some of the best repacking I've ever seen. They repacked L4D down to a hair over 900 megs. Who else has done that? Didn't think so... And nearly every release of theirs has been the best working release of all in the pirate bay. I've played Reloaded releases as well and they are fine but I simply find more from Razor1911. Might be a bigger team... Reloaded might be just one lil old lady doin it all herself and been in the scene for 30 years... ugh... nasty visual... but if that was the case I'd say props to the wrinkly vagina!

1. Firefox adds a ""/"" after the url when the site loads 
2. In the url bar, you can see an arow (->)

Arrow means jump to the entered site. When a site really loads, there is a star(bookmark) there.
So: someone only creates a simple html page, save it on his computer, load it in firefox, and replaced the ulr (like: file:///C:/fakeubi.html) with http://www.ubi.com

Just because the icon is the default favicon doesnt mean it is a fake. If anything it adds more probablity because that means the url http://ubi.com/favicon.ico no longer has the icon (because it was now a ""This site is hacked""page) and the browser uses a default icon, which happens to be a white paper.
