dx 10 systems only"
,n-t0wn,2010-03-05T15:37Z,"so this game doesnt work with windows xp. but thats bullshit ain't it?

just cause 2 is also on the ps3 and xbox360 and these consoles arent capable of rendering dx10.

i remember back in the day when halo 2 was released, they said it was only for vista... but some guy wrote a crack which made it work under windows xp. 

im askin if the same might be possible for this demo"

,RMJ13,2010-03-05T19:08Z,Seems very Stupid to limit your sales market!  there is very little difference in dx9 and dx10!

Here is the thing, from Steam, I dl at about 70KB but here I DL about 260-300KB. See the difference. That is why a lot of people download off the Pirate Bay to get fast speeds/"
,iwilleatu,2010-03-10T01:44Z,"i feel ya on the speed, i have a great speed! 500kb-1mb! ;) hehehe but i figured everyone has had to have bought a game that uses steam so why not get it there. thx "

,fhffan,2010-03-16T04:15Z,"""so this game doesnt work with windows xp. but thats bullshit ain't it?""

Not really. It's a 9-year-old operating system that has been replaced by two more. Next-gen games aren't going to be written with XP in mind. That would be like getting mad that no one makes Playstation 2 games anymore.

""just cause 2 is also on the ps3 and xbox360 and these consoles arent capable of rendering dx10.""

That's because they don't use DX10...or any DirectX version. DirectX is a Windows based engine, used only for personal computers running a Windows operating system."
