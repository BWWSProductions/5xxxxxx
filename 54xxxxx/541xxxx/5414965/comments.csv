,Bujaaa,2010-03-09T16:31Z,How often does Microsoft ban consoles anyway? How long is the time period betwen bans? I mean if you go on live with non stealth games will you be able to play them untill Ms bans your ass? And if they ban my Hdd where can i learn how to unlock it? Know any good site for everything about modding X360?
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-12T16:05Z,"1.There is no ""time"" they ban alla over and random. But some times its the ""wave of banning"". I hear ppl geting banned still. The moment you flash your console you are at risk geting console banned. None know what MS doing. :D

2. Unlock HD is abit hard to say like this. But i have unlocked my HD and all works fine (my banned console).

3. The best way is to google it, There tons of info on ""how to hack your console/unlock/""etc....
