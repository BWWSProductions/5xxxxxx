,glasswings21,2010-03-07T14:03Z,Not something new but i would definitely wait for the Captain Sim 767 because the new liveries Mcphat studios and others are doing for that one are great and yet again the model and the cockpit is amazing as well on the captain sim 767.
,aarque,2010-03-07T19:36Z,Not likely to see CS767 here as the protection is similar to that of the LVLD767 and we all know how long that plane has been around...

,irlan85,2010-06-13T10:22Z,"well all you get different from overland boeing collection is ust simply the B737-300 plus two liveries. Aeromexico works fine but ANA needs some mods in the aircraft.cfg as it is not well coded... plus the engines for some reason doesn't show up for me.

thanks anyway! other than that the flying panda looks funny :)"
,irlan85,2010-06-13T10:30Z,"ok shorted out never mind...
for those looking for a solution change the original names of b763engine_t.bmp and b763engine_l.bmp to b763eng_pw_t.bmp and b763eng_pw_l.bmp (i did a copy of all originals first just in case)

and for the aircraft.cfg i got this:



[fltsim.4]
