Ok, for everyone desperately trying to get the CaptainSim B767 or the Level-D 767, I have found an alternative. This author of this plane is reported to have developed the Boeing 767 for both Overland and Level-D. I checked it out and the texture files, at least most of them, have the same names, albeit the Level-D version has a lot more files in each texture folder. Anyways, I did some experimenting and got the LVLD Aeromexico livery to work on this plane. I have included it in the torrent, just replace the original aircraft.cfg with the one in the texture.amx folder, then put that folder inside the SMS_767-300ER_W folder. Voila. The same technique should work with any of the Level-D 767-300 liveries.
