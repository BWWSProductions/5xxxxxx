Rating:        M (Mature)
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 


Compressed with 7Zip, Game was tested and works.


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description:

Samanosuke is whisked away to present day Paris when he attempts a siege on Nobunaga's fortress. Here he teams up with Jacques, a French commando modeled after actor Jean Reno to take on Nobunaga for the final time. The game also takes place in medieval Japan just like the previous 2 in the series. The game features a new control scheme and a totally 3-D Graphic Engine has opposed to the 2-D pre-rendered graphics of the first 2. The music is a combination of European-style orchestral and Japanese-style instruments. The game itself is fast, visually impressive and has many twists.

Onimusha 3 Demon Siege features expansive settings to explore, a dual hero fighting system, enhanced gameplay and motion picture quality cinematics that the series is known to deliver. Onimusha 3 Demon Siege intertwines two different stories that transcend four centuries from ancient feudal Japan to modern day France. Takeshi Kaneshiro reprises his role as Samanosuke Akechi from the original title in the series. Joining him is Jean Reno the world-renowned movie star who is best known for his roles in â€˜The Professionalâ€™, â€˜Big Blueâ€™ and â€˜La Femme Nikita,â€™ starring as French military officer Jacques Braun.
