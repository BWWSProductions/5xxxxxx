[V],pluto999,2010-03-05T19:37Z,"Could please upload the 2nd part & ""The descent 2""
""The blind side""? & would it be possible for you to seed for case 39? I'll seed after downloading.."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-05T19:44Z,"Thanks lilars, it is nice piece and your nice gesture too, however, from the experience I have; knowing from where attack comes and how is performed in reality means nothing.
Knowing all details and do what? Respond? Attack back? Well, I do not to waste my time on that. Beside, cat&mouse play is the part of this game.  If I see (like the guy in ""Matrix""... you know - the one who watch the screen full of endless streams of numbers and letters not understandable to any other) attack or suspicious behavior I simply block. I can block one IP, I can block a range, block intrenet providers, block whole network back-bones, whole countries and even whole frikkin continent. I did so in the past.

I even can block ANYBODY - by turning damn computer off or at least - a router.

If I want to... but I don't."
,lilars26,2010-03-05T19:55Z,"I knew that I couldn't use it,too big a learning curve for me,maybe someone else can.Have a good evening."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-05T19:59Z,"pluto: It is DVDSCR, but as I remember, a good one:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5212322/The.Blind.Side.2009.DVDSCR.H264

Case39... I loaded right now.

Rec2 would come... IF things change. As for any other movie which is: 1)recent, 2)available and 3)decently sized I recommend another source.

I would stop doing movies altogether, and it's not about you or ""I'll seed"" but about creeps who will rather have anything fucked up then to follow any rules and to show anything resemblant to human kind."

,madtown4,2010-03-06T07:27Z,"hi 2040 just wondering if you got Percy.Jackson.and.the.Olympians.The.Lightning.Theif..R5.
i know you did the cam version that was great, just hoping you would do this one .i think it would be a great share, thanks for what you do."
[V],pluto999,2010-03-06T07:33Z,DVDrip for blind side is out.. I was hoping if you could upload that
[V],pluto999,2010-03-06T07:36Z,Thank you I'll keep seeding case 39 & new moon & your other torrents :)
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-06T08:11Z,"@madtown: After I read the comments about this Percy's R5 I moved on. I think that I would not release any new release of specific movie.

@pluto: You can be sure that I know that probably a day earlier than any of you. And said: ""Nah."" Screener was very good (as the movie itself)."
