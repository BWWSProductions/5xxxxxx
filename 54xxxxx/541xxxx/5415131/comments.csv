Karma & Effect's all there, but Finding Beauty is missing No Jesus Christ, You have the 11 from Disclaimer, minus 69 Tea, & songs 13-20 of Disclaimer 2. Fragile's missing over half of the songs, & there's only 1 song from One Cold Night, & that's the Pearl Jam cover, Immortality.

Maybe all the duplicates got deleted? Most of the missing songs are remastered on separate albums, or on the Live 'One Cold Night' CD."

,Faabjuh,2010-05-16T17:38Z,"I'm sorry, I probably deleted the duplicates, but really, I've got No Jesus Christ, 69 Tea and Immortality, so I don't know why you don't have 'em...

And as lestatvvvvvv said, it's free ^_^
And why would you need the duplicates?"
,DrkPrncss,2010-06-03T02:25Z,Awesome upload. Thank you!! :)
,skydiver8,2011-04-10T08:25Z,"downloading now, just wanted to say thanks in advance!"
,Fretmaster,2012-04-27T21:04Z,Actually we can complain cause you dumb enough to call it a discography and it's really not if you don't have all the music. You should rename this as ONLY SOME OF SEETHERS SONGS. Thanks for the feedback on this not being complete I was about to waste my time downloading something that would have only pissed me off. I only download in discographys and this isn't one.
,b76aa1,2012-06-03T01:07Z,"Why in the world did you put every last song you have of this band - and the others are right, this is nowhere near a complete discography - in a single folder?  There's no way to distinguish which album a song was on, and most of the files are named with poor naming choices.  For example, ""02 - Remedy.mp3"" isn't going to evoke a lot of notice if the standard convention is to either sort music by placing a folder per artist, then subfolder per album, or to put the name of the artist in the song filename.

After all, how many artists have made a song named Remedy?

You should stop uploading until you can figure out how to do it properly."
