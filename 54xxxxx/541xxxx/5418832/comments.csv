,ThePiratePoster,2011-06-08T16:43Z,Works Great! but the Crack didn't work for me but I restarted my computer and worked like a charm ;)
,chelsea93,2011-06-10T14:14Z,"i'm having trouble with this torrent.
is there a specific program i should be using to download it? i'm using utorrent for my current downlaods.

for this, it downloaded an .iso file.
but i have no program on here that can read or deal with this type of file. what can i do now? can anyone recommend a program to use, and the steps i should take to make this download work?"
,LieutenantDan,2011-06-13T01:47Z,My internet connection must be limited to 700kb/s because thats the fastest I've seen a torrent go for me. You guys are getting 1mb/s? Fast torrent none the less.
,Dark012,2011-06-21T09:29Z,Thank you!!! Over 2.0Mb/s Dl-Rate!
,awza,2011-07-20T13:18Z,"Awesome torrent, downloading at 3 mb/s! Thanks!"
,dezignah,2011-08-03T09:26Z,Works great thanks and good speed too. Just needed the no-cd patch and it's all good :)
,perhaps_a_king,2011-08-10T07:45Z,"Thanks!

For those having trouble:
*Extract files from .zip to their own new folder in your saved downloads (i.e. Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Platinum)
*Run Setup.exe from the unzipped folder and let it finish
*Copy ""RCT3Plus"" from the Crack folder in your unzipped folder and paste it into Program Files\Atari\RollerCoaster Tycoon Platinum 3 (or wherever you let the Setup put all of the game's program files)
*Yes to overwrite the old RCT3Plus in the Program Files
*Enjoy!
:)"

,TheSH3RIFF,2011-08-19T15:02Z,"I am totally new to this '.iso. file system. Can someone please help?
I burned the file to the CD through Nero, then installed the software once I put back the CD in drive. Although after the Installation, it asks for a CD even though it's already there.

PS: Is there any way to open up the 'iso' file? Mine goes automatically to VLC player for some reason. How can I extract?"
,TheSH3RIFF,2011-08-19T15:17Z,"HOW DO I EXTRACT???????

HOW DO I EXTRACT THE ISO FILE?!?!

IS THERE A PROGRAM OR WHAT?!"
,Redt0rrent,2011-09-01T18:19Z,"Use Daemon tools to mount it, and it Autoruns. If you want to play without crack, use Daemon tools to mount it."
,Redt0rrent,2011-09-01T18:24Z,"Also, this download maxes out your download limit, so you get the highest download speed you can get in bitTorrent. Mine is 2.0MB/s"
,Linkman95,2011-09-14T00:48Z,"Great dl speed! Over 1.5 MB/s. Torrents that download this fast, isn't fakes like several, & work perfectly is a great torrent like this 1."
,SilentKiller411,2011-09-19T18:09Z,yea. still having trouble. when i try to copy the rct3plus.exe to the program files/atari/rollercoastertycoon3platnium it will paste but it wont say to overwrite anything or when i click on it nothing will happen
