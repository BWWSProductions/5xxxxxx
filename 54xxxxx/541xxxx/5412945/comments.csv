1. Did you have to pay any money to access this download? So quit moaning and move on to the next torrent
2. Can you read? It tells you to download a djvu reader - so probably a clue they are djvu files
3. If you cannot be bothered to read the torrent instructions and cannot show a little courtesy (if not a little love) to someone who has taken the time to share his property with you (just like most of the other people on planet earth would and do), please stay off PirateBay!"
