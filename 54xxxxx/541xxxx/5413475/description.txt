From BOT:

In a small New England town in that hectic era when the sixties turned into the seventies, there lived three witches. Alexandra Spoffard, a sculptress, could create thunderstorms. Jane Smart, a cellist, could fly. The local gossip columnist, Sukie Rougemont, could turn milk into cream. Divorced but hardly celibate, the wonderful witches one day found themselves quite under the spell of the new man in town, Darryl Van Horne, whose strobe-lit hot tub room became the scene of satanic pleasures.

To tell you any more, dear reader, would be to spoil the joy of reading this hexy, sexy novel by the incomparable John Updike.

From AudioFile

Alexandra, Sukie, and Jane are real witches who cast spells, cause thunderstorms, transform objects, and are the twentieth-century embodiment of their seventeenth-century New England sisters. When the devilishly charismatic Darryl van Horne moves into Eastwick, the magical mischief and sexual high jinks move into high gear. Kate Reading's narration creates another era, allowing Updike's lush prose and keen sense of satire to sketch the background, which includes the Women's Movement, the Vietnam War, and the suburban hypocrisies of provincial Eastwick. In addition to solidly delivering their preternatural philosophizing, Reading's intelligent narration revels in the women's wicked antics yet manages to take the sting from their more diabolical practices. Listening to Updike's careful craftsmanship is pure pleasure for this listener, but if his writing and Eastwick's witches don't seduce you, Kate Reading's performance will.
