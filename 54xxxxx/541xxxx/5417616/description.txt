A Scent of Heather's story line traces the sexual awakening of Heather (Veronica Heart), a tasty young virgin who leaves her convent to join in an arranged marriage with Frederick (Paul Thomas), a gardener's son. Much of this awakening is induced by Heather's lecherous Aunt Phyllis (played by Lisa Bee, and extremely voluptuous new-comer), who tell Heather about some, if not all, of the mysteries of lust. however the newlyweds are soon told that they are in fact brother and sister and therefore cannot consummate their union, which leads to all sorts of bizarre perversions and debauchery with a host of horny supporting characters.
