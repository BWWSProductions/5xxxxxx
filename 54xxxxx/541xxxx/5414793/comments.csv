[T],ctang,2010-04-07T23:38Z,so are these dvd ntsc or pal?
[T],ctang,2010-04-18T00:29Z,"ya its Pal...i am just curious how someone that is considered a VIP on TPB doesnt put whether his upload is PAL or NTSC...nothing personal towards you NLUPPER, bc as formula_agents said i should of realized it since it had Dutch subs but i just get tired of seeing so many DVDRs uploaded that dont say whether they are NTSC or PAL

as for a constructive comment...i got these downloaded for the girlfriend and she just uses them on her computer since we only have an NTSC ps3 to play our dvd's on...the quality is ok (not bad but its for not 100% quality) and is worth the download...thanks NLUPPER"
,lemonxtree,2010-05-11T13:27Z,How do you play it without Dutch subtitles? I want to hear English
,lemonxtree,2010-05-12T12:04Z,Ok much easier than I expected. In VLC you go Audio > Audio Track 2. Lol >.>
,jxsilicon9,2010-05-14T10:00Z,"Here are the instructions if you want to convert the dvds from pal to ntsc.Go to the link and follow the instructions of post #5.Worked perfectly

,murrambingi,2010-08-21T20:30Z,"thx for the upload NLUPPER, it works great on both dvd player and vlc media player :) but i have a slight problem which i need fixed fast, i accidently deleted the empty zumba sculpt folder because there were 2 of them, how can i get the torrent to continue seeding, i have already seeded 2.5GB but now i cant seed anymore because 1 stinking empty file is missing, its not in the recycle bin and i even did a search with a restore program and cant find it is there any suggestions as i dont want to download everything all over again because of 1 empty file plz help.."
,murrambingi,2010-08-21T20:46Z,"use this for burning http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5551181/ConvertXtoDVD_4_v4.0.10.324_Final_(incl_crack) it works great, remember to select all the files in one dvd at a time, 1 dvd=basics, 2 dvd=cardio, 3 dvd=sculpt etc.. meaning when using ConvertXtoDvd you must select all of the video and vts files that are in 1 dvd and then burn, if you only choose the video file you will end up with some sort of config problem like no sound etc.. hope that helps..

PS: Nero is shit, lol :)"
,iceb33r,2010-08-31T12:01Z,@MURRAMBINGI..thx for reply.. i used IMGBURN and it worked fine.. just have to chnage the language when playing it on dvd player...
,murrambingi,2010-09-01T17:28Z,"@iceb33r,
np m8, but i just found out after finishing seeding alot that the ends of all dvd's are missing a little towards the end of all dvds 1,2,and 3 it's a shame but still they are good quality, although i am lookin for the complete package."

,bbakal,2011-01-29T23:06Z,"Hi y'all! I figured out a way to burn these files easily to DVD. The files are already prepared for the DVD but you just need to create a file directory similar to that of a DVD so that any normal DVD burning program can recognize it. 

So to do this, you need to the following:
1) create a VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS folder in the Zumba Basics folder
2) Afterwards, move all the files in the Zumba Basics folder (excluding the AUDIO_TS folder, of course) into the the VIDEO_TS folder. 
3) So in the Zumba basics folder there will only be a VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS folder (Note that the AUDIO_TS folder will be empty)
4) Do the same steps 1 to 3 for the remaining Zumba cardio and Zumba sculpt folders.
4) You are now ready to burn so plug in a blank DVD and open any DVD burning software. (I used Power2Go by Cyberlink. This was standard software that came with the laptop)
5) Ideally the DVD burning software that you choose should have an option ""Burn from Existing DVD Folder"". Select this option and choose the ""Zumba Basics"" folder first.
6) Once you are done, burn individual DVDs for the ""Zumba cardio"" and ""Zumba sculpt"" folders.

There we go! I hope it works for you! Good luck!"
,nickie1801,2011-02-01T06:07Z,"can someone confirm there is really a *dutch* subtitle included? Whatever i tried, didn't find them. Only English and German language, but no subs at all. Or do i something wrong?  please, help...."
,dolphinsmarlins1,2011-02-01T16:30Z,Video and audio is of good quality.  Thanks for sharing! Wish there was an easier way to play the English audio upon opening the file on VLC... than manually changing to audio option 2 every time file is opened.
[V],bubanee,2011-02-11T17:33Z,If these were ripped from DVDs to the computer and all files are intact.. i would just use dirty old DVDSHRINK! to burn them to a DVD!

,rudidas,2011-04-30T01:49Z,"How can I burn these files onto a DVD that will work on DVD players? (Using a Mac.)

On a Mac, this DID NOT WORK:

I created a VIDEO_TS folder, moved the files from a DVD into that, and created a disk image of it using Disk Utility, I then burnt it to a DVD which plays in my computer (and is recognized as a DVD), but in DVD players it just says error, and/or ejects it.

How do I make it work? What did I do wrong?"

You must not have a REAL Mac........
All my Mac owning friends all tell me I am a moron because I run Windows/Linux.  They all say MAC JUST WORKS.  ALL OF THEM SAY THIS.

Fact is, there probably is a way of running this on a Mac. I just dont know how because these discs worked fine on my Windows PC.  And actually they worked fine on my Ubuntu PC also. but realize this........90% of the world runs on Windows.  And in the Pirate Bay world its probably 95%+.  If you run a Mac, you arent trying to save money.  And odds are you arent a techie.  You have the money.  Go out and BUY the DVD.  The Bay is generally for people who are technically saavy and dont freak out when the software doesnt work right out of the box.  No offense........ and not being a hater. just keeping it real."
