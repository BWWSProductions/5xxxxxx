Your output is amazing, thanks so much for all the hard work.

One issue: what's with all the foreign videos being renamed?  The names don't bother me, they're usually topical to the video... but with 3TB of pr0n, I rely on search tools to see if a particular video is already part of the collection.

If the name is removed, I cannot search for it.

I assume you are not personally doing this, but could you explain how it's happening?  Just curious.

Thanks again!!"
