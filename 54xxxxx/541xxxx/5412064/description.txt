The song is a ballad, in which the narrator urges to push through tough times:

    You find your faith has been lost and shaken
    You take back what's been taken
    Get on your knees and dig down deep
    You can do what you think is impossible
    Keep on believing, don't give in
    It'll come and make you whole again
    It always will, it always does
    Love is unstoppable
