Heartland S03E15: Second Chances

In this episode, Amy faces a tough moral dilemma when she and Ty discover abandoned horses that escaped from the Hanley farm. And Lou - gearing up for her wedding with Peter - has to make some tough decisions concerning the upcoming event. And at the top of the list is who will be her maid of honour. Jack finds that you are never too old to have trouble with the women in your life, and of course what about Caleb? When we last saw him he was lying unconscious on the rodeo grounds... 

All will be answered, and some new startling questions will be asked in this week's episode.


The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Mar 7, 2010. 

The next new episode will apparently be next Sunday, March 14th.
