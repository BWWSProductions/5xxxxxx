I was just wondering if you would be posting the christmas movie when its out?"
[V],err0001,2010-03-08T14:14Z,"Now that I've heard of it, I'll be on the lookout for it.

Any idea when it is supposed to air?

If it is coming to the theaters, then I won't be able to upload that. I don't have any ability or desire to get into the cam side of things."

But I have uploaded it to monova and extratorrent.

You can find it there by searching Google with:

Heartland S03E16 err0001

I'll upload it here when upload functionality returns."
