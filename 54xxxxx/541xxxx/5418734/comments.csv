,[VIIAV],2010-03-08T18:38Z,"At present I'm the only seed. I will keep seeding it till it gains at least 5.0 availability. As its a completely new torrent, as opposed to a compilation of existing episodes it may take time for other people to be able to start seeding it."
,martian6,2010-03-08T18:50Z,"VIIAV, thank you for seeding this, much appreciated. The total speeds that I'm seeing are quite slow for some reason, which is why I asked."
,martian6,2010-03-10T22:29Z,"VIIAV, please educate me. Why does this report show no seeders if you are seeding? And what is your upload speed? This will help me understand how seeding works and how it's reported."
,[VIIAV],2010-03-11T20:34Z,"The only reason I can think of is that I haven't uploaded the full torrent yet and as such may not be considered a seed despite having the whole thing.

My upload speed holds between 25 and 35 kB/s however the download speed that any give peer receives  is also influenced by the upload speeds of all the other peers in the swarm who are also sharing the pieces that they have."
,martian6,2010-03-12T03:44Z,"A 30 kbs upload speed should complete the seed in about 60 hours. I also think that by definition you are seeding if you're properly connected. 

If I disconnect and then reconnect, I download at 400 kbs, which means that the problem is not bandwidth between the peers but some bottleneck in your upload. The peers in my subgroup, which is 15 peers, are all at about 24% max. I'd expect us  all to be at 75% or so at this time into the seed with the rate you mentioned.

I wonder if this is a problem with DHT or something else about the seeding process. I've looked around on the forums but I don't see anything."
