,Doodi10,2010-03-08T13:46Z,"I can't get this to work. The only files I see inside are file_id.diz, outlaws.nfo, and 13 zipped files from o-flt17a to o-flt17m. I can't find ""FlotillaSetup_v13.exe"" or ""FlotillaPatch_v1_7.exe"" that are found in the instructions.

What's wrong?"
,IAmBrand0n,2010-03-09T04:39Z,"You're supposed to extract the zip files all into the same directory, and then extract the rar files in that directory. It's scene packed."
,Triped,2010-06-24T18:11Z,"This doesn't work. It prompts for o-flt17.r00 on the second extraction, which is not present."
,Triped,2010-06-24T18:14Z,"Sorry, this works. You have to select ALL zip files before extraction. This is dumb though, you could have compressed this in a more user-friendly way. A lot of people won't understand what you did there."
,blackwolf23,2010-07-01T16:13Z,works great THX broo
,blisterchicken,2011-02-12T20:06Z,"I got it to work. Thanks so much. Unzip, (or rar), the original files. Then unzip what just got unzipped. I know! Do all this in the same directory. Install...enjoy. The latest updates install perfectly from the developer's site. Pretty cool!"
,breon,2011-03-30T20:29Z,Why bother to upload torrents when you DON'T FUCKING SEED THEM?
,Zanfib32,2011-05-02T11:55Z,Install file is corrupt.
