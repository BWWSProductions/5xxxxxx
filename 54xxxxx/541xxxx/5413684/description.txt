Features:
~~~~~~

# No adventure is the same. Whenever you begin an adventure, the universe is randomly populated with characters and encounters.

# There is no "up" in space. Explore the tactical richness of full 3D movement. Watch your angles and flank the enemy from all directions.

# Configure your fleet. Find crazy loot throughout your adventures, and install upgrades and artifacts to your flotilla of ships.

# Play with a friend. Grab a buddy and play through the adventure cooperatively in splitscreen.

# Or, blow up your friend. In the Skirmish Mode, set up custom fleets and battle human or computer-controlled enemies.
