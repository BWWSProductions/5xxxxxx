PCDJ DEX description
Mix your favorite tracks like a pro DJ and record the output audio

PCDJ DEX is a computer mixing program for both beginning and professional DJ's.

Mix your mp3, ogg, wma, flac, wav files or audio cd's easily on any configuration. PCDJ DEX is all you need to get started and become a DJ!

Each deck has a pitch slider with a selectable range from +-8% up to +-100% You can pre-listen to the song using headphones through the rear-out of your 3d-soundcard, with a second sound card, by splitting left and right channels or by using ASIO drivers.

PCDJ DEX has a very advanced BPM detection that will help you synchronize your tracks. It's very easy to set a cue-point and start your song exactly wher you want. PCDJ DEX makes beat-matching two tracks easier by using the virtual record in order to speed a song up or down.

For all of the PCDJ, old school customers, you'll love the Classic Red 5.2 Mode! Complete with the original Red 5.2 skin. You can even import your old Red 5.2 recordcase!
