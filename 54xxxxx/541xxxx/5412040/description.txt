Hour 1:

We are joined by Richard Gage, founding member of Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth  
http://www.AE911Truth.org 
This organization is the direct answer to all those who criticized the "Truth" movement for not having experts to counter the NIST, and Popular Mechanics debunking teams. 
This organization has just surpassed over 1000 experts casting serious doubt on the "official" version of events on Sept 11th 2001. 
Share THIS!




Hour 2:

Doyel Shamley joins us from Hour of the Time 
http://www.hourofthetime.com 
(the radio show bequeathed to Doyel by Bill Cooper) 
We will discuss the man, the myth, and the legend that is Bill Cooper. We will also reveal some startling info about the "freedom movement" and a recent conf. document that seems to honor the Illuminati. 
Doyel has done extensive research on AGENDA 21, and we will run that down as well. 

Plus, breaking news du jour....

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume support or endorsement on my
 part of all contents. 

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
