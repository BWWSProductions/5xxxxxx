Not tested by me since I dont have the game...

For those of you who donâ€™t have the patience to wait for a scene release, hereâ€™s a crack for Assasinâ€™s Creed 2. You DO need to read carefully all the information in the NFO. This also has an Russian to English patch for those who have the Russian p2p version(that came out some time ago). Enjoy!

Description: Delve deeper into the secret society of assassins with the sequel to the blockbuster action-adventure game. Assassinâ€™s Creed 2 is an epic story of family, vengeance and conspiracy set in the pristine, yet brutal, backdrop of a Renaissance Italy. Ezio befriends Leonardo da Vinci, takes on Florenceâ€™s most powerful families and ventures throughout the canals of Venice where he learns to become a master assassin. This game retains the core gameplay experience that made the first opus a resounding success and features new experiences that will surprise and challenge players.
