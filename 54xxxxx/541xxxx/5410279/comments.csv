[V],Mbb15,2010-03-04T20:52Z,if it doesnt work tell me so I can delete this torrent.
,Bixel2,2010-03-04T20:54Z,when i click ok it requires a CDkey.... i patched it and did everything like was said
,nasos95,2010-03-04T21:01Z,don't bother...it stucks in the animus....it's no use!
,Bixel2,2010-03-04T21:03Z,where do i put save files?
,Cuda71666,2010-03-04T21:06Z,Well I got it working to where u choose your game options and stuff but when I go to actually launch the game it just says loading at stays that way its been 5 min now and same screen
,r3laxxx,2010-03-04T21:11Z,"Exactly the same crack, as Russians got, doesn't work fully. And, yes, it can be used to change language."
,r3laxxx,2010-03-04T21:12Z,"So, You can leave it, just rename to something like - Assassins Creed II Engl. Language pack"
,Bixel2,2010-03-04T21:44Z,mbb15... when i copy the save files in the directory and start the game they got deleted and new ones come on their place ... i cant make them stay (the ones you give in the rar)
,dphunterr,2010-03-04T22:40Z,"yeah, i got everything working except the saves can you explain more specifically please"
,Kertisok,2010-03-04T22:58Z,aghrrr!!! its not working! its tha same  crack that russians have!!!
,Kertisok,2010-03-04T22:59Z,"dphunter, where you get your copy of assassins creed2 give me link please."
,dphunterr,2010-03-04T23:05Z,"well, its the regular russian version, just write this in search: 

Assassins Creed II (2) [PC] [RUSSIAN] [CLONEDVD]

and if anyone got the save working dont be fucking lazy to explain, everybody wants to play the game."
,Kertisok,2010-03-04T23:09Z,oh..i use some another russian versio. thanks i will try to test it maybe tomorrow. but i think it will not workin..............
,Kertisok,2010-03-04T23:12Z,stop! its is version that i use!!! hat are yo say dphunterr?! it is not working!!!!!!
,virusboss,2010-03-04T23:40Z,"its working if u put the saves, but its not from the begining of the game so useless for me, its easy to put saves, just delete files inside the ramdom number exaple ""\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\storage\dmlydXNib3Nz\4"" and copy the contect of the save files ""1.save, 1.save.metadata, and other 2"" and then just load the first game."
,dphunterr,2010-03-04T23:51Z,"i know, but its just that it replaces them as soon as i press the launcher, and i guess they keep the saves online, but when i disconnect from the internet it wont let me play. "
,r3laxxx,2010-03-05T00:00Z,"dphunterr, first, why the hell you launch 'launcher'? Run the 'AssassinsCreedIIGame.exe'. Second, as this is old crack, u won't be able to start any mission, as you will get white screen. With this crack, only thing You can do, is running around the town..."
,dphunterr,2010-03-05T01:08Z,"yeah i got that by now, i managed to run it and now i realize why ppl r waiting for the REAL crack."
,job_hunterx,2010-03-05T05:44Z,i dont get how 2 use the saves they wont show up
,hush00000,2010-03-05T08:34Z,"to. Mbb15 it doesnt work in MULTI5 CLONE...

,weezy69,2010-03-05T11:08Z,"It's not the fucking crack guys, it's that all the missions aren't on the cd, its on the Ubisoft servers."
,weezy69,2010-03-05T16:35Z,shit needs to be decrypted probally

/annoying you guys"
,insanoyeah,2010-03-08T12:31Z,How about you go pick up your paycheck from Ubisoft Mazena. Why the fuck would I support a company that fucks with its customers as much as Ubisoft.

,d3nikk,2010-03-10T17:24Z,"This is the first crack that works a LITTLE bit for me...
BUT after i start the game,after the ubisoft logo and the sentence about FICTION and MULTICULTURAL beliefs ETC the game just freezes
it shows a grey screen and that's it

please help !
i'm seeding"
,angus2,2010-03-11T00:53Z,This crack doesn't work
,CMM777,2010-03-11T02:50Z,"DRM sucks, just lik every other anti copy attempts. Only SONY with the PS3 was able to avoid the piracy, who knows if they could do that much more time.
Anti piracy bothers much more the buyers than the pirates, because the scene crews fix quickly the issues than the companies itselfs"
,luck702,2010-03-11T03:56Z,"man, seems like the newer games just keep getting more and more difficult to crack and pirate. JUST LEAVE US ALONE!@#!"
,Alexei10,2010-03-11T12:17Z,"When i press 'Story' it wants to connect with internet, but it can't."
,Furko99,2010-03-11T17:39Z,well this waiting for crack is getting me nervous and bored...and I tried with Undead Launcher for steam to dl it from there but I can't :S so there's no go too =(
,turilas,2010-03-12T00:13Z,ubi is thinking that those games are MMOs ? sounds like it to me lol
,turilas,2010-03-12T00:15Z,i mean that game is MMO *shame* typing problems...
,luck702,2010-03-13T07:05Z,"does anyone have an idea when razor will release the legitimate crack. have it installed and just waiting for the crack. this is torture, lol"
,handsomeguy,2010-03-13T10:57Z,can t get pass the incorect cd key
,bapcules,2010-03-13T13:36Z,"@handsomeidiot,  if you can't read, buy the Game !!"
,Alexei10,2010-03-13T23:23Z,"I cant connect to Internet when i press story, can anyone help me?"
,krimiX.,2010-03-15T21:06Z,"http://www.neoseeker.com/news/13357-ubi-com-hacked-free-goods-coming-for-previous-downtime/

thahahahhaah ubi pwned! "
,keosworld,2010-03-17T11:58Z,"krimiX, that never happened, it was a fake, now stop being retarded."
,doradhorror,2010-03-17T19:29Z,"@keosworld

Yeah it did happen. You are retarded.

Even Ubi admitted their drm servers were down due to a DDOS attack."
,drifterkings,2010-03-17T19:35Z,It says after some launches that launcher needs to be updated. It is pretty annoying though And how do I fix it? I mean I get it to work after couple of retries but its like all about luck
,Philonetic,2010-03-26T23:11Z,"@bapcules
Don't act like you've got it working douche fag.

If Ubi is holding all missions and save games on their servers, then all they've accomplished is having less people play their game.

But hey, if we've got Starcraft 2 running there's no reason this won't have a perfect release too.
Can't wait >:)"
