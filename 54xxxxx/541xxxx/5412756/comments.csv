,champofchampions,2010-03-07T19:20Z,"@virpazar : I laugh at your ignorance, its a keygen u dumb idiot ofcourse ur antivirus will detect it as a virus, go google what a false positive is.."

,MaxThebeast,2010-03-08T18:16Z,"Kids should not go on the pirate bay, there's so much useless whining in here."
,johnnyl11,2010-03-09T04:36Z,almost all keygens show false positive. having said that a keygen is the perfect place to put a virus because people will assume its a false positive therefore i always run keygens in vmware just to be safe.
,DonAndino,2010-03-09T04:38Z,"Does anyone have instructions on how to install with keygen? It generates a serial but when I paste it to the installer it says it's invalid. I even tried clicking ""add to whitelist"" but it still doesn't work. Maybe I'm just retarded but if anyone could post up step by step instructions I would greatly appreciate it."
,shawn338,2010-03-09T06:09Z,"DonAndino:  make sure you right click on Keygen and Run As Administrator. You don't need to paste serial. If you are running the Keygen as an Administrator, adding to whitelist should work. "
,shawn338,2010-03-09T06:14Z,"Better yet, check out the detailed instructions here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5281999/Nero_9_Reloaded_9.4.26.0___keygen_[GR420]"
,chucklesmcgee,2010-03-09T23:23Z,ok well i got it all and it works great! but its a trial version so wtf i get two weeks
,shawn338,2010-03-10T06:18Z,@chucklesmcgee: Run the Keygen and it will be the Full Version. Follow the instructions on the torrent referenced above and your problems will be gone.
,soldier5577,2010-03-13T11:00Z,"For all those out there that complain that the keygen/serial  contains a Trojan Virus. (Do your homework first before moaning)

It does not this is a safe setting established by 99% of all virus protection software, because it is a generated serila it will show as a virus as it does not come from a valid source.  Just click ignore and proceed. This goes for any keygen on any programme.

The programme installs and works fine.

Good upload thx."

,tbe90,2010-04-05T17:10Z, Thank you so much
,rico98,2010-04-14T15:56Z,what a dumbass kid ofcours your virus scan say its a troyan or the likings of a troyan thats because a keygen is a virus trigger but false
,dopusy,2010-04-14T17:23Z,"degene, vole!!!"
,Meudhros,2010-04-16T12:43Z,Keygen works fine. You just have to scroll down to Nero 9 activation. It keeps telling me though that it can't find a certain file.
,thoughtc,2010-04-17T17:06Z,It worked fine for me with no virus. Plus he is a trusted source. So shut the fuck up and quit your whining.
,.EzDL,2010-05-05T01:00Z,"Thank's for the Brill upload, Had to Generate a couple of key's before i got a working One. Thanks noobish!"
,wunderwummun,2010-05-20T10:08Z,hey all you noobs out there! Make sure you are not connected to the internet while you are installing and putting in serials! bet this is the #1 prob you guys are having issue with!
,uhansolo@gmail.com,2010-05-25T18:13Z,"keygens just because how they are put together often return a false positive. 

The best way to deal with that is run the keygen in sandboxie. 

If you are having trouble opening a keygen your AV maybe grabbing the files, you can disable or carve out an exception for the keygen file until you have a chance to run it."
,sof00,2010-08-14T12:23Z,HEY DEY SEED PLEASE!!!!!!!!
