0 SEEDERS WHEN I AM SEEDING THIS!?!?!??!

fuck im getting fed up with tpb. so many of my torrent dont do shit the first day, any for what fucking reason?"
,Frice,2010-03-06T18:29Z,Yay it finnnaly updated w/ a seeder. xD
,PopolVuh2,2010-03-06T18:45Z,So u just extract to sc2.exe folder?
,Frice,2010-03-06T18:58Z,"@PopolVuh2
Yes you just extract it to the sc2beta folder.

Beware though if you have the v5.5 AI add-on (its the expert edition made by the chinese guy) then you need to hunt down all those ""triggerlib"" (aka .galaxy) files and delete them.

You will know its working by the friendly ""Starcrack AI v.6"" message upon entering a game or just by getting raped in the ass by 25 carriers at a undisclosed time in the game."
,foote1,2010-03-09T19:39Z,Why torrent this when you can download it at 600kbps from http://www.blizzardbeta.com
,Frice,2010-03-10T01:10Z,"Fuck off foote1. That website just links to a TPB torrent that has less seeders than this torrent (atleast in the case of this File is concerned).

600kbps? Really? 8 seeders = 600k? Alrightey then, awesome."

@foote1

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Coming Soon:

Version 7.0 
Preview:

    * Reactive AI. AI will understand different strategies and how to counter them.

    * Attack code overhaul. AI will understand which units are good for what and will use them accordingly. For example, if he masses marines and marauders as well as a few reapers, he'll use the reapers to attack your workers while attacking you at the front with MMs.

    * Unit logic overhaul. Individual units are now less stupid. SCVs repair damaged buildings and stanks (in the heat of battle  ;) ). Queen uses creep tumors, terran buildings lift off when taking damage from ground units. The list goes on.

    * Customizable difficulty. You will now be able to modify the difficulty easily. This won't only be APM changes and mineral bonuses. Setting the AI to easy mode will mean he'll be slower to counter, he might forget to counter, he won't reach saturation as fast, he won't mass as many units. All of these options will be open to the end user.

    * Many, many more additions and modifications.

I will upload this new AI once it is available, their is a 6.1 out atm. but it isn't THAT big of a upgrade from 6.0 so I haven't uploaded it.

Cheers, cant wait for the official release.
