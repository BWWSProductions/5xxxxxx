,i.dow,2010-05-03T13:50Z,Thank you for taking the time to put this up. But Episode 4 and 7 are in itunes audio format. Could you please try to put them in vid as well? thanks.
,solari1,2010-06-15T07:01Z,"They're all in video format.  Use VLC media player.  It's free and plays almost anything you throw at it.  

They're in the screwed up, various formats they were in when I downloaded the series from the website.  I didn't want to re-encode anything... I wanted to preserve the trainwreck in all its glory."
