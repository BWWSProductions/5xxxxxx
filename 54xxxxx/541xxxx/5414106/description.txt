             Match! is an easy-to-use software for phase                      
             identification from powder diffraction data, which               
             has become a daily task in material scientists work.             
             Match! compares the powder diffraction pattern of                
             your sample to a database containing reference                   
             patterns in order to identify the phases which are               
             present. Single as well as multiple phases can be                
             identified based on both peak data and raw (profile)             
             data.                                                            
                                                                              
             As reference database, you can apply the included                
             free-of-charge IUCr/COD/AMCSD database and/or                    
             ICSD/Retrieve (if you have a valid licence), use any             
             ICDD PDF product, and/or create a user database                  
             based on your own diffraction patterns. The user                 
             database patterns can be edited manually, imported               
             from peak files, calculated from crystal structure               
             data (e.g. CIF files), or imported from your

             1. Unpack and install.                                           
             2. Copy the license and cracked files into the                   
                installed folder, overwriting the originals.                  
             3. Replace Onlineupdate.exe with the included one,               
                or block it from accessing the network.                       
                                                                              
             That's all. Have fun using it! ;-)

      Always remember to block applications (or go off line) from calling     
      home 'during install'. Once installed, disable 'check for automatic     
      updates' option if available, so that you don't get it blacklisted.
