Thanks for the encode/upload.

Is this series becoming more popular and are the DL's seeding back at a good level?

Cheers
Jon"

Just when it was starting to get interesting again.

I'll say one thing for the producers/network, they REALLY managed to drag this out. S3 started June 4th 09.

Bring on  S4, probably in June and not get to the end until this time 2011."
