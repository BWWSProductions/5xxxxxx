             Endeavour is a powerful software for crystal                     
             structure solution, both from powder as well as                  
             single crystal diffraction data. Based on more than              
             ten years of experience, the software is capable of              
             solving many small to medium sized structures more               
             or less on its own. The innovative concept combined              
             with the elaborate user interface makes solution of              
             crystal structures an almost routine process,                    
             especially for inorganic but also for many organic               
             compounds.                                                       
                                                                              
             Even unexperienced users can prepare and perform the             
             structure solution calculation in a few steps:                   
             Simply follow the integrated "wizard" to enter the               
             required data (unit cell parameters, chemical                    
             composition, diffraction data), and let Endeavour do             
             the rest. The structure solution is performed using              
             a special variant of the "direct-space" approach,                
             namely a combined global optimization of the                     
             difference between calculated and observed                       
             diffraction data and of the potential energy of the              
             system. Due to the additional usage of the potential             
             energy, the method is much less sensitive to                     
             low-quality diffraction data than e.g. direct                    
             methods.

             1. Unpack and install.                                           
             2. Copy the cracked files into the installed folder.             
             3. Replace Onlineupdate.exe with the included one,               
                or block it from accessing the network.                       
                                                                              
             Note: If you have previously used Endeavour in demo              
                   mode we recommend you to completely uninstall              
                   Endeavour, delete Endeavour.ini (in windir),               
                   remove all Endeavour related registry keys,                
                   and then reboot your computer.                             
                                                                              
             That's all. Have fun using it! ;-)

      Always remember to block applications (or go off line) from calling     
      home 'during install'. Once installed, disable 'check for automatic     
      updates' option if available, so that you don't get it blacklisted.
