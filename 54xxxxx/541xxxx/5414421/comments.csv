,matttyger,2010-03-06T14:11Z,"geomau, li'il dipsh*t, read the name of the torrent, see the [micro] at the end?, that means it's MICRO.
don't need a lot of brain cells to figure that out...

fnx twentyforty, for the upload, unfortunately no 500Mb upload, but better than the 1.46 Gb =p
My netbook can't handle that =("
,blackdwagon,2010-03-06T15:16Z,"Just finished downloading and its good quality, small file compared to normal, but deffinetly worth downloading!!

Especially seeming the only other copies are 1.4GB, not sure why there is no smaller version besides this, but go for it guys. 

Looks to be an awesome ep! "

[V],twentyforty,2010-03-07T07:30Z,"Thanks back to all people who have decency NOT to bite feeding hand...

I DID the same AS ANY Saturday so far, regarding Spartacus and absence (till late afternoon) of XviD from scene groups.

EVERY FRIKKIN SATURDAY my small-sized Spartacus was there, often BEFORE my scheduled things, by my choice, in order to help fans and save their nerves, money (bandwidth-wise) and time.

How many people have said Thanks? In seven weeks? Maybe dozen. And each episode was downloaded many thousand times.

But - whenever I have from pure altruism jumped-in to help, as for Leverage, Big Love, Friday Nights (all often released a day after) I got bitching and stupidities all over.

It can't fly... and Spartacus is on the same way as mentioned shows - be forgotten, for good. "
,tainted_c0bra,2010-03-07T08:37Z,"A thousand and one thanks.  As my bandwith is stolen wifi from a couple different neighbours it's a chore to download big rips.  Thanks for thinking of the bandwith loosers such as myself who have to steal internet from unsuspecting people.

Once again thanks, I wish I could punch them radio reception nose kikes in the face for you who don't give credit where it's due.
