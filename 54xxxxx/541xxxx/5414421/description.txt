Double-episodes, requests or Pilot ep. will be issued only as MP4 or 360p.
MP4 is ISO 14496-1(H264 video & AAC LC sound) and playable on PCs, Macs and hopefully (read Comment before download; I check every file for iTunes compliance) on iPod-like portable-mobile devices.Due to small frame-size recommended resolution for computers is 1024x768.
360p is fully compatible with newer iPod, iTouch and Nokia U97. 
Requests should be posted in Comments section of newest torrents.
"Out of schedule" shows or pilot-episodes may get uploaded randomly, if situation arise (free slots).

SUBTITLES: external, English, English for hearing impaired.

NOTE: This is not my usual mp4 encoding, because people asked for XviD (in order to watch in their DVD players). This episode never will be released as MP4, size gain is this time too small (approx. 54MB) and making a duplicate would make no sense.
