,ScreamingDeath,2010-03-09T06:04Z,What is the real main difference between Toast 10 Titanium and Toast 10 Titanium PRO?
,Glasgow76,2010-03-11T01:23Z,thanks pal
,drumbrent,2010-03-13T00:26Z,The serial for titanium doesn't work for me. Is there something special that needs to go in the name area?
,habydlg,2010-03-17T01:18Z,"@ScreamingDeath, not at all... just the space it takes and a few extra things in it but stay with this one... the other one is heavier and complicated"
,bigmeat,2010-05-12T18:45Z,"took me about 5 minutes to download, installed it serials work perfectly. Thanks!"
,NYCRocker,2010-06-03T16:37Z,"God I get so tired of these torrents not working. The serial just sits there and the ""next"" button is greyed out. I think ""big meat"" is pulling a leg or too."

,rhino2323,2010-06-27T01:38Z,where's the serial number?
,Dermbet,2010-08-16T11:22Z,"Thanks works perfect! Great upload.

The SERIAL is included in this upload as a .txt file. just open it and it works!

 Only problem with this version is that toast doesn't appear to have all the audio codecs that VLC etc has and therefore doesn't play sound on a lot of avi's. 

As an alternative u can use ffmpegx to convert to a .mov file and burn that in Toast instead.

There is a update here, not sure if it works, will try and let u know on that torrent.

,Royaltee,2010-10-24T05:30Z,I used the included serial and everything works great. Thanks.
,memphist,2010-11-01T23:55Z,"When adding the serial number, if the 'Continue Button dosen't become active, try this.

After you draged the TT10 folder into the Apps Directory, and you try to enter the Serial but can't continue, shut down TT10.

Go to the desktop
Open the TT10 folder on the desktop
(not the one you've draged into Application)( you will need to find the original downloaded DMG file and reopen it to the desk top)
CLick on Toast Titanium (TT10) ( You will get a warning it's not the optimal way to run TT10)
Go through the process of installing, when you come to the serial number just add it as before, you now should be able to continue this time.  
Complete the install.

Now shut down TT10 that is open 

Go to your Application folder
open TT10 Folder 
Start TT10
Check under the menue bar TT10 About TT10
It should be registered to you.

Done
