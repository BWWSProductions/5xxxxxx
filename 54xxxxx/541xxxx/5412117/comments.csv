Oh well."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-05T17:35Z,"Not non-believers lilars, but non... literate, non(t/n)-English speaking and no(n)-brain and no(n)-understandable to anybody. Why any of this braniacs never come later to apologize? Well, after they take a dump in my living-room, on my Sherwood-originated carpet, they do not want to step into own shit (they somehow believe that all other people left shit all around).

@toversnol

I don't inderstand the logic behing reading evrything in the info and then saying the torrent is fake. Another thing as this is TPB and 20-40 has a pink skull that means that he is a trusted uploader ant they don't waist their time with fake torrents, the way I see it is 20-40 is a ledgend and my friend. He wil never upload fakes. On to the next subject in my country you sir are what we call a ""DOOS""  and a ""POEPHOL"" now go download the eztv episodes and don't bother my friend

Good night"
