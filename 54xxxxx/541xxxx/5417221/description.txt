And 101 Other Crap Questions and Answers.



Have moles always lived in holes?. Why are blondes so stupid?.How much 
radiation can a pickled onion withstaned?. 
The world is full of really important questions.
You will find none of them in this audiobook.

What you will find in plenty of nonsense. lots of lies, and just enough
truth to make you double check the "facts" with a reliable source.

Following the huge success of the New Scientist books "Does Anything Eat Wasps",
and Why Don't Penguins' Feet Freeze", this is an alternative take on human
curiosity. With detailed answers to ridiculous questions, if you've 
learnt absolutely nothing by the time you've finished this book,
at least you'll be laughing.
