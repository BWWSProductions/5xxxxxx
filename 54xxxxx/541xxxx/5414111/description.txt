Where were you on 9/11?

All This Time turned out to be the unintentional chronicle of where and what the performer Sting was doing before and during the fateful day of September 11, 2001. This turned out to be a documentary of how a group of musicians was affected by this infamous date in time.
======================================================================

Background

As Sting wanted to put together a concert in his home, he enlisted a group of musicians to practice and perform this concert with him. The events leading up to the night of the performance were filmed and within these events on the day of the performance, the New York terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 occurred and the group was made aware of this. Due to the tragedy, Sting offered the musicians an opportunity to step down from the concert. None did, and they all performed the concert as originally intended although Sting indicates on the DVD documentary that the tone of the evening was different from how it was originally intended.

As a result of the tragic circumstances, the concert was dedicated to those who lost their lives that day.
