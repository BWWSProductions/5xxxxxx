,CraZyXHeaDX,2010-03-08T05:50Z,why even comment on the samples? you know they rip samples from the best 'looking' parts of the film.
,al64ne1,2010-03-08T16:54Z,"Well, CraZy, since you asked... I do it to make your life that little bit more difficult; I know it's not much but if everyone helps, I'm sure your head will explode sooner or later :)"

thanks."
,evapilot,2010-03-12T01:57Z,"JG4390, i think you must've unclicked a file or something, because one of the 4 files listed here is a 1.3gb avi file, ie the movie."

,blues1875,2010-03-15T20:10Z,"great picture/sound when i test on computer, burnt to a disk via convertxtodvd and the sound fails. If you are planning to burn to disk dont bother with it! But if you are going to watch on computer then its a thumbs up 9/10 "

,ckblood05,2010-03-15T22:55Z,"RazFoSho- i figured it out yesterday. go into your settings on convertxtodvd, go to the audio tab and check the do not fix audio discontinuities box at the bottom. it worked for me."
,ckblood05,2010-03-15T22:57Z,blues1875- try the same thing i told razfosho.

[T],HenryGT,2010-03-19T20:00Z,i was searching this for weeks.but i think i should wait for the dvdrip .
,d-schmidt,2010-03-19T23:59Z,"@Orangzeb

M stands for Movie, their opinion on how good the movie is"
,mutineer,2010-03-20T07:28Z,"v7/a6 (remember that it's a cam)
Actually, even though it's fairly predictable, for it's type, it's a pretty good flick. I'd say m7, worth grabbing the 720p version for your collection when it comes out later this year.
Cheers.
(sorry for irrelevant post but had to correct that m4 stuff.)"
,tsafa,2010-03-20T11:34Z,thanks m friend
,Shadow_Jedi,2010-03-22T08:49Z,@raymondome - Great upload! 9/9 for a cam and the movie...8. I love horror/thrillers like this that 'could' actually occur IRL. Makes watching them that much more horrific. 
,Giskard80,2010-03-22T10:22Z,"Video Quality absolutely blows wtb real dvd ripper, how long until you guys figure out HORROR MOVIES SUCK IN BLACK AND BLACK. Go Torrent anydvd clownz.   FAIL   A9    V2
"
,DocEvil,2010-03-24T20:41Z,"Quit bitching about quality. This is one of the best damn cams I have ever seen. Not a single person in the audience made a noise, no fidgeting camera-man making that odd squeek noise and annoying shake. Just pure, still camming of an allright movie.

The people who complain about the quality have obviously never seen a VHS movie. This was the same quality(video/sound) as the original Halloween, Children of the Corn, or any other VHS Tape classic. The picture isn't 1080p, so get the fuck over it.

V:6
A:6
M:7ish

All in all; its worth the download, but I would have felt a little ripped off if I had paid $9 to see it in theaters."
,DocEvil,2010-03-24T20:48Z,"@Giskard80
So you want him to DVDRip a movie thats still in theaters? Thats hot.
On that note, why havn't we seen the Director's Edition BluRay of Ironman2? Huh? WTF ASSHOLES! GET IT TOGETHER!!111!!!!11!!!

(This is sarcastic for those of you who didn't get it)"

Well done!!!!!"
,shingabo,2010-03-26T04:33Z,"Great quality.BUT SAME PROBLEM

when I try to convert this using ConvertXtoDVD or DivX converter the audio is completely wrong, I think it may even be the sound from another movie altogether...any suggestions/help for me ? "
,shingabo,2010-03-26T06:44Z," THANKS ! -ckblood05 
like you said. go into your settings on convertxtodvd, go to the audio tab and check the do not fix audio discontinuities box at the bottom. and it worked fine."
,watbol,2010-03-30T21:53Z,"Very Good, Nice 16:9 WideScreen movie

,Bugsy_B,2010-04-04T20:46Z,"Very good work for a cam...no walkers or movement in front of picture. There is the top of a chair on the right and side of the screen but it's not too noticeable at all.
A:6 (some audio filters could clean it right up)
V:8 (obviously graded on CAM work...a completely unobstructed screen would boost that.)
M:7 (had some subtle twists and a believable plot line...wasn't the greatest movie but it certainly didn't suck.)"
,MrBugMan,2010-04-05T01:46Z,Will I go crazy watching this?
,icefire1,2010-04-07T17:58Z,"@MrBugMan 
Hehe ^^

Considering this is a TS it is VERY good quality I'd say, almost looks like a DVDrip to me. Thank you very much for sharing."
,rahulpear,2010-04-08T23:11Z,"thanx for uploading. the best print out there

A-7 ; V-7 

@ Icefire - Dude this does not even come close to a quality DVDRip. "
,Rappoz,2010-04-11T23:25Z,"just watched it.
nice movie, and one of the best quality cams i've seen. steady picture, even in the dark scenes there arent the usual artifacts.
audio is very acceptable aswell.
lets say a/v = 8/8 (for a cam)
could not find the subs in dutch, but the sound was good enoug to follow anyway"
,levic152,2010-04-14T21:59Z,"a/9 v/9 good audio and visual. the movie itself was ok, id give it a 7"
,CarlosResidentEvil,2010-04-15T23:52Z,its good movie/ good quality... i'll give a 10/10 for quality... and 9.5/10 for story plot...xD  i suggest it for ppl who didn't watch it...xD
,AGnostICXv,2010-05-12T00:16Z,audio /7 video 8  movie /8
,fightoffyour_demons,2010-06-04T10:42Z,"I'm still a fan of your work, but this one wasn't your best. 
V: 4. I was rather upset with the obstruction at the bottom right hand corner. It distracted me a lot.
A:10. Great, great sound. 
M:5(ish) I wouldn't pay to watch it.

Overall, it was a solid UL."
,Wolfareon,2011-06-05T11:58Z,quality's shit.
