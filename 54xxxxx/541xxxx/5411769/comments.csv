,rockaway99,2010-03-20T19:24Z,"You are so right, this is indeed a classic. I remember winning this record from a radio station when it first came out and I just loved it. 

Would you happen to have his album ""Reverse Logic""? If you do, could you please upload it?

I'm also desperately looking for Diesel - Watts In a Tank. Do you have this one as well? 

Thanx again for the wonderful music."
