If you don't know the reason, I suggest you shut the f**k up and keep your uneducated opinion's to yourself."

,nkm10gt,2010-03-05T18:56Z,"nice work tptb.
Can you people make a rip of Assassins Creed 2?"
,darkmind35,2010-03-08T14:44Z,"installer stops when extracting Freeman files. when it gets to ""Freeman_2.tptb"" 89.7%, it stops installing, tells me the extraction time and says ""All OK"". has been there for about an hour. pressing enter does nothing.

Help would be appreciated

Thx in advance"
,Creosto,2010-03-08T22:37Z,"Same thing with me.

I run Windows 7 64bit. It goes past the 89.7% and completes the freeman_2.tptb but then it just sits still at ALL DONE. Nothing is happening. I retried it with ""run as administrator"" but same result.

My guess is that the script is broken or incompatible with win7 64bit. "
,Creosto,2010-03-08T23:02Z,"sorry for the double post but i have found the solution. The script seems to pause for some reason. 

Press CTRL+C inside the freeman window, it will then ask you if u want to terminate the batch job, press N for no. Wait 3 minutes and the extracting will continue :-) 

Im playing the game now and WOW !!"
,darkmind35,2010-03-09T19:37Z,"Creosto's advice helped but...

after it has installed/extracted the next files the installer just disappears. no messages or anything else whatsoever"
,gempakb,2010-03-10T06:55Z,"yeah, doesnt work for me either, had to dl the setup.bat fix. on the other hand, i got another prob, when i start the 4th mission,  i clicked when it says ""click anywhere"" the game straight crashes, i tried many times n it still crashes, mission1,2,3 is ok. Anyone had dis prob?"
,fleetkid,2010-03-11T03:09Z,First time a TPTB rip is not working. Installer is just messed up.
