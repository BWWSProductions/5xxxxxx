,Bujaaa,2010-03-05T16:22Z,Eeee God damn it! Previous versions didn't work for me. I hope this one will. Thank you.
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-05T16:57Z,Well i have patched 20+ games with this one.  And never hade any probs. ;)
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-05T16:59Z,Today ia pached FFXIII for a friend and hes satisfied :D.
,pickled_egg,2010-03-07T02:24Z,"I have ixtreme 1.6.. all the latest games I got from here just say PLAY VIDEO when inserted.
I tried this patching to wave's 4 then 3 then 2 but only got 1 game to register (new Sonic racing) but even then it just boots to a black screen & then freezes. I have to use button on front to turn off.

Anyone got any ideas on how I can get my 360 to play latest games please"
,pickled_egg,2010-03-07T02:29Z,"Why does everyone say you gotta upgrade your flash to 1.6/1.61 or LT or you need to patch the games
My last 360 was banned so sold it to a mate. It has 1.51 yet he is still booting all games including the wave4 ones I can't with my 1.6."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-07T11:20Z,"Im not sure what you doing wronmg. But if you have IX 1.6 you need to pach to wave3.

IF you are on iXtreme 1.51 (Hitachi), then ANY wave will boot fine, including Wave4."
[T],Sunblock.,2010-03-07T11:40Z,"Did you test my share?:

Sonic And Sega All Stars Racing (wave 3 Version)"

,Tiberiusqueerius,2010-10-19T18:58Z,"I've patched Halo Reach and FFXIII for ixtreme 1.5 and it works great!
The only problem I've had is that the dashboard updates that are on the disk can't install, but you can solve that by jumping on Xbox live to update."
