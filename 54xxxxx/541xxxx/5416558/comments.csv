http://www.munkyourself.com/us/ 
official movie release website for that.  >.< why can't people just admit when they have a cam of a new release?"
,da_maze,2010-03-07T18:24Z,"blueminx87, stop being an ignorant assbag. Do you really think the ONLY dvd source for these movies is shrinkwrapped on the shelf at walmart on release day?

Why do you think this site is called the ""PIRATE"" bay?

Now stop spamming uploader threads with your moronic rants about release dates and time machines."
