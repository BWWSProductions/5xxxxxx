Elton John - Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy [1995 Japan Vinyl Replica]


In 2006, Elton John looked back on Captain Fantastic and the
Brown Dirt Cowboy released in 1975:

"I've always thought that Captain Fantastic was probably my finest album
because it wasn't commercial in any way. We did have songs like "Someone 
Saved My Life Tonight," which is one of the best songs that Bernie and I 
have ever written together. But whether a song like that could be a single
these days, since it's practically six minutes long, is questionable. 
Captain Fantastic was written from start to finish in running order, 
as a kind of story about coming to terms with failure--or trying 
desperately not to be one. lived that story....That whole 
album, Captain Fantastic, sounds so damn good when I hear it now. 
Gus Dudgeon was a great producer, and we as a band were at our
peak. Momentum is everything in music, and we were really getting
our own--our adrenaline was flowing. At the time, I thought it
was a completely commercial-free album. It didn't have any 
deliberate pop songs on it like "Crocodile Rock." It wasn't 
about that anyway--it was about our experience, so it was like
a mini-operetta in a way."
