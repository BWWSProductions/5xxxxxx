Definitely one of the most original and overlooked albums of the neo-prog era, "Fact and Fiction" can be seen as the missing link between progressive rock and new wave. It's epic, ambitious and imaginific as Gabriel-era Genesis, with an exquisite sake for beautiful, mellow melodies, but it is also as eerie, moody and decadent as The Cure. The songs are incredibly sad, not properly desperate but resigned, yet at some point they "open" into major-key sections which deliver some hope, just the amount you need to miss it and feel melancholic afterwards. The vocals are excellent, they are dramatic and expressionist but never exaggerated or artificious: singer Geoff Mann doesn't have to fear comparisons with Peter Gabriel or Peter Hammil, placing somewhere between the two but with a unique and very personal style. The overall sound is focused on creating decadent atmospheres, with prominent six-string bass work and early-80s synths depicting eerie textures instead of taking the scene with solos.
