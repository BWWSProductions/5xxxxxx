                                â€“ Sue Townsend -

First broadcast 12.01.2007

Adrian Mole, as a â€˜representative voice from Middle Englandâ€™, is commissioned to present a feature on Tony Blairâ€™s 10 years as Prime Minister. Adrian, not surprisingly, has a somewhat idiosyncratic view on the Blair legacy.
