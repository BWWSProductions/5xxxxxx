i was wondering if you could tell me how to make a PS3 Team style movie. i know how to convert to m2ts, but i dont know how to make them 4gb
do i have to rip them in order to get a 4gb file? or is there some sort of program i can use?
i have some mkv format movies id like to put on here but i want to make them ps3 team before i do.

,galan1971,2010-04-06T14:59Z,"MrAssassn - I use Ripbot264 to compress HD content.  It creates an MKV so I use tsMuxerGUI to quickly repackage it into m2ts.
By the way, you can use options in tsMuxer to create multiple files of 4BG - I compress down to 10-12 GB (in RipBot264) then split that into 4GB files for the PS3 to play.  the PS3 has an option called 'Sequential Playback' that makes this work seamlessly."

Thanks brick"
[T],Pharos2001,2010-09-21T19:53Z,Will change it into mkv file w/ mkvmerge. Posting m2ts? Somewhat odd but I'll manage.
