,saskdavid,2010-03-15T12:16Z,"Great rip, thanks! Can someone tell me though how to burn a movie on all in one program such as avs video converter 6 if it is over 2 hrs? Even jsut the slightest bit it rejects it. My old programs that don't work anymore did it automatically, but this I have no idea. Thnks"

,NaNaMoose,2011-01-12T19:55Z,"@saskdavid 
Try Pepsky all in one. Works great, simple to use and you can fit more than one movie on a 4.7 disc if you don't need chapters."
,NaNaMoose,2011-01-12T19:56Z,Thanks Ray. Your rips are always the best!
