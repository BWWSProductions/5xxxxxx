NeDiVx NOTES
We chose to compress this on 1 CD because this movie compressed extremely well, and thus quality would NOT be any better on 2 CD's. A technical proof is included and shows the average quantizer of the encoding, which is as low as 3.xx. This proofs also that bitrate is meaingless. Quantizers are a much better quality factor.
