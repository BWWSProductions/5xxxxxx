,valrez,2010-03-07T08:43Z,"Whoever wrote that summary about it not being a canadian show is a idiot. the show is set in canada, filmed in canada, written by canadians, based on canadians and starring canadians. cbs splitting the production costs doesnt make it an american show and the same applies to flashpoint. And yes shows like fringe are american because they are just brought there to be filmed. These are quality shows and i do appreciate the up. thx tvteam"
