,kap530,2010-07-25T20:13Z,"Am I the only one who finds the audio to be horrible in this???  The audio quality is great but the dynamic leveling of the voices is just absolutely fucked.  I've tried 3 sets of speakers now including a 7.1 surround system and I can NOT get it to be listenable.  The music is at like 100db while the voices are at like 20db... it SUCKS :(

Even tried messing with the EQ in VLC to no avail.  Any suggestions anyone?"
