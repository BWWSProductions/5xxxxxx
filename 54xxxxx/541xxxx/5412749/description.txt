Formed in Hobart, Tasmania in 1999 Psycroptic wrote intensively for the months following their formation, crafting the material for the debut album 'The Isle of Disenchantment'. This album was self released in January 2001 to overwhelming response from the metal underground which helped spread the Psycroptic name all around the world.

'Scepter of the Ancients' saw the light of day in 2003 through Unique Leader Records and with it Psycroptic further define their sound. After several years of playing Australian stages, 2004 saw Psycroptic leave their home shores for the first time, touring with death metal legends Dismember throughout Europe.

Much of 2005 was spent touring Australia, and preparing material for 'Symbols of Failure'. Released in early 2006, the album was followed by extensive touring â€“ 3 full European tours and several Australian tours â€“ sharing the stage with such acts as Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Nile, Behemoth, Kataklsym, Black Dahlia Murder amoung others.

The Tasmanian Devils made their long overdue North American live debut on the 2008 Summer Slaughter tour, which has been their most successful tour to date. The forth album 'Ob(servant) will be released Worldwide on October 14th on Nuclear Blast (and on Stomp in Australia and New Zealand).
