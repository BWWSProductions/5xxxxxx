If you ever decide to convert it to something that works outside Linux, I'll be happy to seed that. Sorry, just a bit too lazy to boot into Xubuntu for just one movie. If you have recommendations then bring'em on."

We got a person (nunchuck) who downloaded a hacker/ing related video and claims that uses a Linux distro, and he can't even download the vlc player to view it in any OS.

idk, it's just hilarious to me..."
