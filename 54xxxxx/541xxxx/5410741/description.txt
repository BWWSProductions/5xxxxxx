Though the latest issue of the disc is broken down into six untitled tracks, Cymatic Scan might as well be considered one piece of music. Indeed, on the original release the music was clumped together as one composition titled â€œMonochrome Existence.â€ The music is deeply abstract and almost purely ambient. A beautiful and ghostly drone whispers throughout, topped occasionally with low-frequency rumbles (presumably from Laswell) and gently repeating synth figures (presumably from Inoue). With the exception of a few bursts of (mild) controlled feedback (which seem a bit out of place), the music is a warm, chalky tapestry. Like much ambient music, it appears to be almost unvarying throughout, though a deep listen â€” preferably on headphones â€” reveals a deeply lush sonic picture. Melodies and rhythms rise and flutter byâ€¦or are they just stray cancellations from the last wave of sound? Either way, in the proper listening environment, Cymatic Scan is a rich record with many wonderful aural rewards.
