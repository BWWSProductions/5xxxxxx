,hkoraddi,2010-03-07T08:37Z,every one it doing hit n run in fewer pitch my ratio is around 7.348 fell like hell if ppl do dis way...its good i completed up in initial seeding... any way seeker is not going to come today so would try to seed for another day or so...
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-07T08:45Z,"In FP I have 14.742... and for the same reason I would probably stop to seed. It is ridiculous, and for sure I feel stupid. All that trouble in getting the input, hours of downloading and re-encoding - for few good people and like gazillion bastards.
You see how  I feel about."

,jjabrams,2010-03-07T14:19Z,have you thought about moving to private tracker? its really the only solution to hitnrun
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-07T15:05Z,"@jjabrams: I am unacceptably slow for any torrent ""club"". But... It will defy the purpose of my work - small files as a help to less fortunate people. Be available to decent human beings who can give back what they get - without a fear or restrictions of many ""private-tracker"" sites. You know, my main concern is that WorldHealthOrganization has right in their annual report estimating 54% of the population as ""people with mental health ""issues"". 
There is no place to run from that.
Fuck the zombies from the movies JJ, creeps are all around.
I would definitely fall, but not without fight. A big one, best I can. They would inherit ruins afterward, and I think that they cannot comprehend what they are doing.

By the way, have you picked-up request you've placed two weeks ago?"
,jjabrams,2010-03-07T15:14Z,"yes I have 20/40 - thx- but havent had time to watch it yet because you upload too many movies! still trying to watch stuff I DL last month!

Luckily some of the movies you upload are not to my taste (like this one)
I always seed to +1 though :)   
a couple of times to 7.xx too... so I know what you mean"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-07T16:17Z,"Thanks guys.

@jjabrams: LOL, this one was for the wife of madtown - he asked for help - and we know what could happen if wifes ain't happy..."
