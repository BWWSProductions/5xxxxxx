The next evolution in gaming is upon us. From the mind of Will Wright, the
creator of The Sims, comes SPORE, an epic journey that takes you from the
origin and evolution of life through the development of civilisation and
technology and eventually all the way into the deepest reaches of outer
space.

Begin your odyssey at the dawn of life as a simple microbe just trying to
survive, then use the fun, intuitive Editors to evolve the creature from
its microscopic origins into an intelligent, tool-using race. Guide your
species as it builds (and the player designs) villages, buildings, cities,
and vehicles. Along the way to becoming a global civilisation you can
choose whether to hunt or forage, attack or trade, be nice or play rough!

All the action takes place in a huge, lush world populated with creatures
evolved by other players and shared over SPOREs central servers. When its
ready, your one-time pond scum launches into space in its UFO on a grand
voyage of discovery, planet forming, or destruct-ion! As you explore and
play in this limitless universe of unique worlds, your personal Sporepedia
tracks all the creatures youve met and places youve visited.
