,Basiclife,2010-03-21T18:44Z,paopman: Mounting means putting the CD image in an virtual CD drive - Google Daemon tools or Gizmo Drive
,meburnfire,2010-03-22T23:41Z,Is it possible to download Sporepedia creatures into this?
,spiketank,2010-03-24T18:36Z,"""mount the image"" means exactly that. Put on some Barry White then make some sweet sweet love to the image. if it liked you, the game will play. if not, try try again."
,Kirbyroth,2010-03-24T22:41Z,mount using a disc imager like magic disc

,net.dem0n,2010-03-28T04:29Z,"Can you download creatures, patches, and updates or do you need the download manager for that?"
,schokoxx,2010-04-02T19:07Z,"works great, no problems at all

played it 7 hours today.. awesome game!"
,cornrun,2010-04-05T14:46Z,putting in proper instructions as a readme in the download is not too hard >.>
,l3lunt,2010-04-24T00:40Z,"what do you mean by ""dont start without copying over crack first""? "
,dogsgomeow,2010-04-25T13:02Z,umm how do i install could you make a guide plz
,myryad,2010-04-29T19:15Z,"This game had a DRM system called SecuROM which caused a lot of annoyance to people (suckers heh heh) who purchased it legally on DVD.  That's why you need a reg key and not to log on to any game server, and meticulously follow the instructions.

I saw this game on the National Geographic Earth Investigated series and thought I'd check it out.  I've never had reason to use Steam before, maybe a legal purchase of this game if I like it will be a good one."
,scarczar,2010-05-19T02:54Z,Fun game and the torrent works fine ty for the upload.
,Newbing,2010-05-20T16:16Z,Must I play the game with the crack or play the game with the original thing?
,inoksvere,2010-05-22T10:58Z,"Not sure if this has happened with anyone else, but about 5.2% into downloading this torrent via uTorrent, i encountered a trojan.

When it popped up, my anti-virus software said it was in the folder that this information was being stored, and the torrent was also stopped with the status saying,""error: denied"""
,inoksvere,2010-05-22T11:02Z,"I'm not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but i encountered a trojan virus while this was in the process of being downloaded via uTorrent.

It encountered at 5.2%, stopping the torrent from finishing and giving it the status saying, ""error: denied""

My anti-virus is doing a complete scan at the moment, so far no further complications after the  first clean. 

No offense is intended thenoobish :)"
,fingers91,2010-05-22T20:12Z,"installed this fine but when i moved the crack it didnt work and is asking to enter registration code.
any help "
,cuffofizz,2010-05-27T03:03Z,"@inoksvere: Every game I've downloaded makes the antivirus pop up claiming trojans. I havent had any real problems though, it should be cool."
,james4115,2010-05-27T04:33Z,"turn off firewalls before downloading a torrent of any game with a crack,AVG considers EVERY crack a ""ongz trowjun."""
,StePHen_0,2010-06-02T08:08Z,next time can you add if it is in ENGLISH or NOT
,fife22,2010-06-04T04:18Z,"@StePHen_0
uh all of the info is written completely in English including the instructions on installing, yeah I think it's going to be in English."
,Hyrrokkin,2010-06-17T21:38Z,"spiketank...lolz! Love your explanation of how to mount the image xD

People...to mount go download Daemon tools lite-it's free-and it will TELL you how to mount the image and install if you still can't figure it out from the ""Mount N' Drive Manager"" ;)"
,TheNightFox,2010-06-19T07:52Z,"Sheesh. I reckon, if you can't work out how to mount an image, you shouldn't be allowed to torrent."
,Wolf_Man,2010-06-20T20:07Z,"Doesn't work for me. I mounted and installed the game, copied the crack. But whenever I double click the sporeapp.exe, a blank dos screen flashes and thats it. Can someone help???"
,coolhandz69,2010-06-23T07:55Z,@Wolf_Man---Make sure you have directX installed.  
,ItsDrastik,2010-07-02T23:51Z,"I'm downloading now at 800kb/s.
Thanks for the upload Thenoobish."
,DYKTMM,2010-07-03T15:14Z,"Just thought I should warn y'all, I was emailed my Comcast (my service provider) telling me that they'd been contacted by a copyright owner concerning this torrent, threatening to suspend/terminate my service account. Don't really know the severity of the issue, but I suggest being aware of this. 

Game worked great though..."
,nikumus,2010-07-06T17:15Z,"(for noobs) if you don't know how to install this game, don't try to install pirate versions of ANY games!"
,xaviervega,2010-07-07T05:05Z,i cannot find the txt file with the serials.....someone help
,brdrhppr,2010-07-11T09:29Z,"okay to alllll of you who need directions, i will write them because in the beginning i had some trouble figuring out myself.nn1.) you receive three items in the initial download: a Crack folder, a big file called rld-spor and this text file with serial keys.nn2.) Extract the \""rld-spor\"" with a program like AlZip into a SEPARATE folder in another location (i do it on My Desktop, but it doesn\'t really matter).  if you don\'t know how to do that, go search online or something to get a similar programnn3.) Now you have a whole bunch of crap in your NEW folder.  Somewhere near the bottom there should be a Spore SetUp Wizard icon or something.  Use that to install the game and use one of the serial keys given in the text file (from the initial download).nn4.) Now dealing with the Crack: Right-click and copy the \""SporeApp\"" inside the Crack folder.  Then, in your NEW folder with all of the extracted files, you should see another folder simply labeled \""Spore.\""  Inside there are two more folders, \""Data\"" and \""Sporebin.\""  Inside \""Sporebin\"" is a \""SporeApp\"" icon that looks identical to the Crack \""SporeApp\"" icon, but is less in size (20-something Mb while the Crack one is 30-something).  As you have your Crack already copied, simply click anywhere within the space of the \""Sporebin\"" folder and paste the Crack.  A pop-up will ask if you wish to replace the original 20-something Mb file with the Crack\'s 30-something Mb file.  Click \""Replace\"" or \""yes\"" or whatever.  Your crack is now in the Sporebin.  DOUBLE CLICK DAT SHIT TO PLAYY!!!"
,Hman242,2010-07-14T15:46Z,"I have been playing this game fine for a month, but I had to reinstall it and I\'m having some trouble. After reinstalling and adding the Crack, when I try to play it says Spore Has Stopped Working. What\'s the deal?"

,coolix,2010-08-03T18:46Z,"@Sparrow81 thats why i pay for btguard. 

@army008 you copy the crack from inside the ""crack"" folder to the install directory, which you can get there by right clicking on the shortcut and clicking ""open file location""."
