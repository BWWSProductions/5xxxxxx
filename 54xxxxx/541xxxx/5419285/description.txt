  Harold and Kumar, two stoner roommates who like to get high, end up having
  the munchies for White Castle burgers after seeing a TV commercial. However
  getting to White Castle proves much harder than these two ever imagined. On
  their way, many things seemed to interrupt their journey, including a raccoon 
  that bites Harold, Neil Patrick Harris, and Kumar getting in jail because of
  a racist police officer.
