Touted by The New York Times as "one of the best television shows of the year" and praised as "The Best Show of the Year" by Entertainment Weekly, "The Colbert Report" has garnered ratings and critical success as one of the top shows on television.

"The Colbert Report" launched on October 17, 2005. Since its inception, the series has garnered a prestigious Peabody Award for Excellence in Broadcasting in 2008 and 15 Primetime Emmy nominations.
