In the iso file is a folder that says Star Wars Episodes in that folder is two more folders each one being one of the family Guy Star Wars Episodes.

The first one is called Blue Harvest. This one had no previews to remove so I left everything as is. Has all the menus and special features. The only thing I did was to compress it to fit a dvd5. The movie was only 5.2GB from the store to begin with. 


The second folder has the "Something Something Something Darkside" which had a shitload of previews that I removed and some of the logos. The disk was also compressed to fit a dvd5.
