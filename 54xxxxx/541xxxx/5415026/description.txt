Fritz Lang - Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956)

Plot
--
Dana Andrews is a former journalist who's so anxious to match the success of his first book that he allows himself to confuse hubris with good intentions.  After setting off on a ridiculously convoluted scheme to generate material for his new book (by undermining the state's capital punishment policy), he soon comes to realize that fate, she is fickle, and justice, she is blind.

Review (All Movie Guide)
--
Compared to Fritz Lang's German films, and most of his American ones as well, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is surprisingly dull visually. Constricted by a tight budget, Lang was forced to sacrifice his penchant for richly detailed visual designs and satisfy himself with making a competent suspense picture hampered only by some wooden acting, particularly on the part of lead Dana Andrews. Despite its lack of dazzle, the film is still filled with signature Langian moments. The plot hinges on one of his most vicious twists of fate, and although a final plot twist requires a suspension of disbelief of near-heroic proportions, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt remains compelling right up to the end. -- Tom Vick
