    Professor Brian Cox visits some of the most stunning       
    locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature     
    have carved natural wonders across the solar system.     
                                                              
    In this first episode Brian explores the powerhouse of     
    them all, the sun. In India he witnesses a total solar    
    eclipse - when the link to the light and heat that       
    sustains us is cut off for a few precious minutes.        
                                                               
    But heat and light are not the only power of the sun      
    over the solar system. In Norway, Brian watches the      
    battle between the sun's wind and earth, as the night     
    sky glows with the northern lights.                        
                                                              
    Beyond earth, the solar wind continues, creating         
    dazzling aurora on other planets. Brian makes contact     
    with Voyager, a probe that has been travelling since       
    its launch 30 years ago. Now 14 billion kilometres away   
    Voyager has just detected the solar wind is beginning    
    to peter out. But even here we haven't reached the end    
    of the sun's rule.                                         
                                                              
    Brian explains how its greatest power, gravity, reaches  
    out for hundreds of billions of kilometres, where the     
    lightest gravitational touch encircles our solar system    
    in a mysterious cloud of comets.
