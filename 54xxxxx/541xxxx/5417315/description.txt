METAL Hard ROCK Covers 301 - 350

Quality:
192kbit/s+ (latest files are high-quality VBR, many are 192kbit CBR)

Changelog:
- tried to fix all spelling mistakes (please comment if there are any left!)
- renamed all files according to this schematic: [Tracknumber] [Artist] - [Title] ([Original Artist]).mp3
- replaced dumb-witted comments in all mp3 tags with original artist info
- fixed all track number tags
- removed several useless tags
- had to .rar the collection and split it up because the Bay can't handle that many files in a single .torrent
- added .torrent files for easy access to the complete MHRC collection
