                    JJ has a part-time job with Thomas in a  
                    confectionery wholesalers where he has fallen  
                    in love with beautiful fellow cashier Lara. He  
                    sets about planning to get a date with her, but  
                    catching her eye is not easy. What's worse is  
                    that some of his friends don't think he's up to  
                    it, and to his horror, his mum and his doctor  
                    agree with them. Cookhowever comes to the  
                    rescue - full of advice on how to handle the  
                    opposite sex. JJ sets forth only to discover  
                    that there are many more hurdles than he could  
                    ever have imagined. Is he really up to the  
                    challenge?
