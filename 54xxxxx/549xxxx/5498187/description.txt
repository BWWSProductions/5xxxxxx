"Under Control"

While Stefan (Paul Wesley) struggles to control his 
new situation, Elena (Nina Dobrev) and Jeremy 
(Steven R. McQueen) are surprised by a visit from 
their uncle, John Gilbert (guest star Anders). 
Alaric (Matt Davis) has an awkward talk with Elena 
about Isobel. At a Founder's Day event, Stefan 
displays a rare party attitude and Damon's (Ian 
Somerhalder) attempt to find out why Uncle John has 
returned to town takes an ugly turn. An incident at 
the party causes trouble between Matt (Zach Roerig) 
and Tyler (Michael Trevino), and the relationship 
between Matt and his mother, Kelly (guest star 
Melinda Clarke), reaches a new low. Meanwhile, 
Elena's effort to comfort Jeremy falls short and he 
decides to take matters into his own hands.

Enjoy :)
