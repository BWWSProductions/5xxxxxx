Radio sitcom set in a retail shopping park, written by Paul Barnhill and Neil Warhurst

Sitcom following the staff of Edge Falls (an out-of-town retail park) as they try to maintain their sanity and provide a real shopping experience for the customers.

Each week politically incorrect manager Sonya dreams up a scheme to extricate large amounts of cash from shoppers, such as Pink Thursday, where in order to attract the gay community to the retail park she gives a 20 per cent discount if customers come out at the till.

And each week Mick, the chief of security, inadvertently mucks up Sonya's plans - usually because he is busy trying to woo back his ex-wife, Valerie, who manages the shop Fortywinks.
