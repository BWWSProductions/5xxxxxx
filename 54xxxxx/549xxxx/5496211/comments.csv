,policema,2010-04-15T00:15Z,"This crack is a modified version of the old Razor1911 crack for GTA IV (1.0.4.0). It still mostly works for EFLC.

Note that, if not having installed EFLC with the 'official' installer (you don't, if using this version), 
you will need to add the registry key
 HKLM\Software\Rockstar Games\EFLC with a string value InstallFolder
pointing to the installed folder. Without this registry setting, EFLC will crash after the Rockstar North logo.

THIS IS WRITTEN IN THE NFO FILE does this mean we need a registry key???"
,SubGum,2010-04-15T00:27Z,Sounds sketchy to me.

,gianis777,2010-04-15T02:50Z,"It WORKS perfect! I had No registry errors on win xp.
I played the game for about 2 hours with no problems. 
Plus Im getting higher FPS than gta iv :)

I downloaded the game here:

It took me 21 hours."

,DBNSystem,2010-04-17T10:25Z,mqdn: EFC20 is caused by using a wrong crack
,flamemc1,2010-04-18T04:16Z,"Right i finally got this to work, follow @sharky4687 discription of what to do and i got it to work, its nothing to do with gfwl or if you have gta4 already on ure system, its all to do with the regedit setting, start with a fresh extraction, delete anything youve done already including the .reg files youve added, and extract the files to this exact locastion

C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City

You dont need to change the .reg file in the crack then, and then just follow these exact instructions, also make sure the contents of EFLC is in the location above and not in the EFLC folder.


Alright I got this working perfectly on W7 x64

This is how you do:

1.Download this torrent (ofc.)
2. Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5497507/GTA_IV__Episodes_From_Liberty_City_Crack___.Reg (If it shows that it's a virus I recommend that you should uninstall your AV because it sucks)
3. extract The game into C:\program files\rockstar games\
4. extract the crack into the EFLC folder. double click the EFLCINSTALL.reg file and apply.
5. open up regedit and locate HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

AND (If you're using x64 I think)

HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now you should make new strings in the wow6432 folder. Give them the same name and value as the ones in HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now to InstallFolder key you should type in the location of the game.. e.g. ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City\EFLC""
5. Install games for windows - live program
6. Start the game with LaunchEFLC "
