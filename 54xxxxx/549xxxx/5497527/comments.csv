get http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5506040/Katyn.2007.720p.BluRay.x264-CHD"
,bxb,2010-05-26T08:03Z,"@jonny: this is 1280x720p, yours is 1280x536p (via info box)"
[V],-jonny-,2010-05-31T19:00Z,"So the aspect ratio on this is messed up, while mine is correct."
,bxb,2010-06-06T19:07Z,@jonny: kindly explain 'incorrect' a/r in my torrent and what made you to come to this conclusion? 
,bxb,2010-06-06T19:50Z,"@jonny: I take my questions back - just noticed the a/r of the original bluray is 2.38:1, while my torrent stands at 1.78:1, thus portions of the source were cropped out. Still, it is full 720p and looks much sharper=detailed=better IMO. "
[V],-jonny-,2010-06-20T22:13Z,"no it doesn't, bxb, and no one wants hardcoded polish subs. mine looks much better and the aspect ratio is correct."
