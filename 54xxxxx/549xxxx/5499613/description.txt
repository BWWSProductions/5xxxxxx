Ectoplasm was a BBC Radio 4 comedy series written by and starring Dan Freedman and Nick Romero. 
Unlike the other radio work of Freedman and Romero, this series features single, coherent stories in each episode; 
it may even be possible to describe the four episodes as part of a continuous story, linked by Theremin's murder attempts.

The stories follow the adventures of Lord Zimbabwe, a "walker in the ether", or occult investigator; 
his friend and collaborator Doctor Lilac, a German scientist who has invented various machines, 
including a time machine and a teleporter, and who breaks into megalomaniacal ravings at inopportune moments; 
Theremin, Zimbabwe's butler, an abusive, murderous, incompetent servant who refuses to carry out any of Zimbabwe's instructions; 
and SchrÃ¶dinger, a semi-corporeal cat that exists in a superposition of quantum states of life and death (cf SchrÃ¶dinger's Cat), 
and who is sexually attracted to women. Each adventure is initiated by a request by a different woman for Lord Zimbabwe to help her.
