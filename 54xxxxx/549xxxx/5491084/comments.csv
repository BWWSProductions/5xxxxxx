,KickassWashingMachine,2010-06-09T16:27Z,"Pretty crappy quality, I'm sorry to say. The dynamic range of the video has been reduced, so you have a fucked up black and white level, giving weaker contrast and lost darks. Also, there are lots of compression artifacts. I'm going for one of the 720p releases.

A/10
V/5"
,sinvis,2010-08-21T10:19Z,i have not downloaded ....but i think i will skip this torrent(courtsy @kickasswashingmachine)...though LTT is my trusted encoder...
,TwoPac,2010-09-20T03:17Z,"The picture is fine. The video is way better than a 5 out of 10 as stated in an earlier post. Didn't notice any artifacts neither, but maybe i don't know what to look for."
,rhett_hdx,2012-01-30T17:11Z,I'll seed for a ratio of 10. Haven't finished the DL yet but looking forward to 1080p. Thanks for the upload.
