Simon Patterson the DJ.... is one of the hottest properties in dance music right now. His creative offerings as a producer have captured audiences, bringing them willing with him along his musical adventure. From techy moods to edgey riffs, spin tingling melodies to driving basslines, Simonâ€™s studio offspringâ€™s of the past 12 months have 
raised his profile to see him become a much in-demand dj, producer and remixer. 

Signed exclusively to the hugely respected Spinninâ€™ Records, Simonâ€™s music has earned him massive support from industry leaders such as Paul van Dyk, Tiesto, Armin van Burren, Ferry Corsten, Judge Jules and Above & Beyond. With tracks such as F:16 (Nov 2006), Panic Attack / Strip Search (Apr 2007), Bulldozer / Weâ€™ll See (Sept 2007), attaining almost cult statues, coupled with widespread acclaim from the dance media. 

However, itâ€™s when heâ€™s behind the decks that the sound of Simon comes alive. With a style described as cutting edge, dark, driving, pulsating, Simonâ€™s technical ability is a finely tuned art that fuses trance with elements of techno and electronica. If youâ€™re stood on a dance floor when Pattersonâ€™s behind the CDJâ€™s you know whoâ€™s in control, and the only thing youâ€™re likely to do is to dance and dance hard. 

Moving from Belfast to London some 10 years ago his career has been punctuated with a wealth of experience in dance music. From working alongside Dave Lambert at top Universal dance label AM:PM, which led to him being approached by head A&R man Nick Halkes to work with him on his new Ministry Of Sound label â€“ Incentive Records, he then
went on to being the driving force in the engine rooms of two of the biggest shows on Radio 1, he utilised his finely tuned ear working as the tastemaker behind Seb Fontaine and Judge Julesâ€™ peak-time Saturday nighters. 

Labelled by Mixmag in 2004 as â€˜One to Watch for the futureâ€™, Simon has since drawn on this knowledge, and with an unparallel passion for music, he has now thrust himself firmly at the forefront of the trance elite, and is firmly forging his own career as a prolific artist within his field. 

In the past five years Simon has really clocked up the air miles, rocking some of the biggest parties on offer. His highlights are vast, and too lengthy to list, but here are a few. In Rotterdam, crowds of up to 500,000 witnessed the might of Simon Patterson, revellers that flock to the sun drenched dance Mecca that is Ibiza have experience his sound year in, year out, a huge tour of the far-east and an indoor festival in Russia where he gave 20,000 Muscovites a musical masterclass. Behind the CDJâ€™s Simon has graced the world stage at many prolific festivals such as Dance Valley, Sunrise, Gatecrasher Summer Sound System, HI-FI, Sunrise, Planet Love, Monday Bar Cruise, Full on Ferry, Mexico Stadium, all the while delivering his sound to new audiences with frequent appearances throughout Asia, Australasia, Europe, North and South America. Whilst his club repertoire stands equally tall ranging from the likes of Godskitchen, Gatecrasher, Inside Out, Turnmills, Slinky, Judgement Sunday, Passion, Escape, Koolwaters and Wildchild, where he has left the foundations of each of these clubs shaken to their very core. 

Aside from his solo projects Simon was also one half of the massive Dogzilla with Richard Kayvan, which with just one tune shook up the trance scene in the 00â€™s. Picked by former world 1 DJ Paul van Dyk as his track of year, â€˜Without Youâ€™ sent shockwaves throughout clubland finding phenomenal support along the way. With their genre-defying productions, Dogzilla tracks became part of every top DJ's set list and still remains in doing so, from the early days of their eponymously titled debut, which featured in the cult Brit flick 'The Football Factory', right up to the massive 'Your Eyesâ€™ and â€˜Frozenâ€™, Dogzillaâ€™s music achieved an impressive foray on the modern day club scene. However, 2008 saw Patterson depart from Dogzilla and go at it solo style. 

Although Dogzilla had been his passion for several years, he felt it was time to branch out and expand his own djing and production work. 

Regarded by M8 Magazine as â€˜one of the highlights of 2007â€™, there is no doubt that Simon Patterson has â€˜big hitterâ€™ in his blood. With his foot firmly to the pedal as a producer, boasting a diary that reeks of big things, coupled with a desire that is second to none, worldâ€¦..you better look out!
