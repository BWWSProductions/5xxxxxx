Sit back and enjoy 60 minutes of the best action from the biggest football tournament of all - The FIFA World Cup.
This DVD,officially sanctioned by FIFA, brings together the greates moments from the history of the tournament in 10 scintillating sections.

The DVD opens with a selection of the greatest goals over the years before narrowing them down to the top 10 of all time including the memorable Arie Haan pile-drivers from '78.
Also included are the most talented players ever to have graced the stage from goalkeepers through to attackers,with sublime saves from the likes of Gordon Banks and Oliver Kahn to classic strikes from Pele, Josimar, Maradonna, Paulo Rossi and co.

However it is not simply a programme about heroes, as the villains of the piece are also exposed with the spitting antics of Frank Rijkaard and the shocking Schumacher challenge on Patrick Battiston in 1982 topping the bill.
Interspersed with some incredible misses and hilarious howlers, this programme DVD has it all."
