,namajnin,2010-04-19T11:15Z,So no comments from anybody?
,j4yyy,2010-05-07T00:23Z,Thanks for the torrent. I'm getting as much as 400kbs on it. Cheers!
,vayakrolika,2010-06-23T21:26Z,Thanks so much for uploading this!  I was so sad when Manga Fox took down the scans I was reading. :) I'll be seeding as well!
,namajnin,2010-06-26T10:36Z,"Awesome, although it seems like not many people are wanting this any more, so, if you guys have any friends that want this, be sure to tell them about it, I plan on keeping it up for quite a while."
,namajnin,2010-08-11T09:31Z,How is everyone doing?
,JB2448,2010-08-18T06:00Z,"I'm doing quite well.  Thanks for the torrent of this manga, by the way.  It's not too easy to find if you're not in the know."
,RGBY,2010-08-19T16:09Z,"You're a lifesaver, man."
,ABCGina,2010-08-25T05:45Z,"I'm downloading right now. You are a saint. :3

I was wondering, are you planning to upload the HGSS chapters as well? I can't seem to find those anywhere either."
,namajnin,2010-08-25T08:50Z,"If I can find the HG/SS I will, it took me about a week and a half to find all of this, and it's even harder to find all the newer stuff with all of the manga sites going down, if I do find it though, yes, I'll update."
