Alex talks [hour 2] with Leslie Dutton of the Full Disclosure Network about the imprisonment of political prisoner Richard I. Fine. Mr. Fine, who holds a PhD in international law and served as an anti-trust prosecutor at the Department of Justice in Washington D.C., has been held in solitary â€œcoercive confinementâ€ in the Los Angeles jail for more than a year as punishment for exposing the corrupt practices of Judges, the Sheriff and L.A. County.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
