,mixymillxx9,2010-05-07T09:19Z,"This version of the guide was purged off the private site it first appeared on for being a ""fake"" over a month ago. It's just a re-upload of older and already available guides with the version number updated. The original uploader used the ""Zygor Downloader"" to update the version number of the Guide Viewer without having an account so it didn't actually update the guides and added in the ""Trial"" guides in the process which can screw up the Guide Viewer. 

Compare the older Guides and Dailies .lua files to the ones in this using Notepad++ and you'll see for yourself. "
