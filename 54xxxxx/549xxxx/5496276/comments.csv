It is the great ""Deutsche Grammophon"" box set.

If you add that key word to the title I guarantee you'll get more hits (:

Thanks Rambam!"

How about just a fine collection of good music?"
[V],rambam1776,2010-12-08T12:09Z,"Did you even read the info? The first thing written there is VBR mp3 format. This has no password, it just opens right up."
,GrosLapin,2011-01-21T22:30Z,"87 cds, WOW!!!

Thanks!"
,sammyboblammy,2011-01-28T06:05Z,I would really like this file but because I am on a FAT32 system I am unable to download a file greater than 4GB.  Would you take into consideration making it 3 separate rars?\
,WarRobe,2011-06-09T10:33Z,"This should be classified as porn, cause I had many eargasms"
,wtphreak,2011-06-15T13:40Z,"Thank you rambam1776, I have been really wanting this set. I wonder how this is a piece of white cultural history like SWEfriggeMS92 said, cuz wasn't Beethoven f'd over by everyone he knew. I don't get what makes it white, SWE u wanna explain that one?"
,skollatus2,2011-07-10T07:06Z,"Unfortunate quality for a comprehensive collection.
If background hiss drives you insane, this is not the torrent for you.
Plus it's a .rar so I had to DL the whole bloody thing to find that out. =c"
,julzianaz,2011-07-18T04:53Z,fuck yeah! thanx!
,Muad23,2011-08-05T18:39Z,"It'd be nicer if this was split, in-torrent, into smaller pieces. I guess I'll have to download all 8 GB then. 

Thanks."
,McCoco,2011-11-29T22:32Z,This sucks~ I can't open .rar format
,_Yvy_,2011-12-07T18:17Z,"Ram Bam Thank You Man !

@McCoco: there's freeware like 7z you can use (has problems with big .rar files, though). For this perhaps ZipGenius will do, it's freeware, too. "
,Herculine,2012-03-26T15:19Z,Thank you. I will seed whenever possible.
,exbaronecv,2012-04-09T16:45Z,"Whhen I hear the 9th Symphony Of Beethoven, I Shed Tears."
