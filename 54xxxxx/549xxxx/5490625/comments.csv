[T],artpepper,2010-04-11T16:23Z,"My pleasure, @peater. I've seen him perform a few times over the last 25 years and the man's a cultural treasure. It's a disgrace that he's not better known."

,knotoftoads,2011-02-27T12:23Z,"thanks artpepper...I too have seen him over many years, and yes, like many others, he is an unrecognized treasure......covered since long ago by everyone from the yardbirds, to the who, to the clash...and I'm sure many more I'm unaware of.....but like he says ""when I get my top 40 big beat rock and roll record everything is gonna be just fine......"" ""limosines and swimmin' pools I did not get my share, I'm not downhearted, but I'm gettin' there...."" Thanks again for this, I'm glad I thought to do a quick TPB search...."
