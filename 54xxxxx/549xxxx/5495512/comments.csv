First of all a lot of thanks for seeding Ford nav DVDs. Much appreciations.

I managed to download your 7P disk the one you claimed as 7D. A bit later 8P was downloaded as well. I need to update my friend's Lincoln Aviator 2004 and none of these disks worked. There's never ending message on the screen ""Reading DVD"" and no luck.
Any magic behind your disks to make them working ?"
