 Dallas is an American prime-time television soap opera that originally ran
 from 1978 to 1991. It revolved around the Ewings, a wealthy Texas family in
 the oil and cattle-ranching industries. The show debuted in April 1978 as a
 five-part miniseries on the CBS network, and then was broadcast for thirteen
 seasons from 1978 through 1991. In 2007, Dallas was listed as one of Time
 magazine's "100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME."
