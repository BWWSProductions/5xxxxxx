,Danman42,2010-04-16T23:11Z,"There another request but not for me for a friend. The Dead Weather- Sea of Cowards release Date is 11th of may.  
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Cowards )

Also one I really want but is quite old a discography of ""Red Rat"" a reggae artist. There is at the moment only the one album ""Oh no its Red rat"" and ""Monsters Of Dancehall"" there is another I cant find anywhere.

Thanks ( If you cant get them I don't really mind )  

PS. I really like that Kate Nash. Kiss that grrl and Do-Wah-Doo."
[T],djsforfun,2010-04-17T01:54Z,"hmm, they have both in piratebay... just search as ""red hat""

:)"
[T],djsforfun,2010-04-17T01:57Z,"i meant ""red rat"" hehe"
,Danman42,2010-04-17T11:53Z,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rat

 according to this he has a album called ""I?m a Big Kid Now"" ;) . (Also  I think 
 ""Monsters Of Dancehall"" is not a real album cause most of the tracks are in the old album and I think some of the tracks are from the new one.)

What I mean is if you can get both albums and upload it in 1 torrent. Will be cool. 

Thanks -Dan"
[T],NoggintheNomad,2010-04-18T13:06Z,This album is very much good enough to buy. I shall be popping to HMV tomorrow!
,stimsnaps,2010-08-12T20:41Z,Says this is an invalid torrent file....hmm...
