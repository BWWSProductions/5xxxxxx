BBC Wonders of the Solar System 1of5 1920x1080i HDTV h264 AC3

Professor Brian Cox visits some of the most stunning locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature have carved natural wonders across the solar system.

Part 1: Empire of the Sun
In this first episode Brian explores the powerhouse of them all, the sun. In India he witnesses a total solar eclipse - when the link to the light and heat that sustains us is cut off for a few precious minutes. But heat and light are not the only power of the sun over the solar system. In Norway, Brian watches the battle between the sun's wind and earth, as the night sky glows with the northern lights. Beyond earth, the solar wind continues, creating dazzling aurora on other planets. Brian makes contact with Voyager, a probe that has been travelling since its launch 30 years ago. Now 14 billion kilometres away, Voyager has just detected the solar wind is beginning to peter out. But even here we haven't reached the end of the sun's rule. Brian explains how its greatest power, gravity, reaches out for hundreds of billions of kilometres, where the lightest gravitational touch encircles our solar system in a mysterious cloud of comets.

This is the original 1080 PAFF TS file wrapped inside a MKV container.
You'll also find the PDTV Xvid and 720p HDTV versions at MVGroup.
These 1080i files have been tested with VLC v1.0.5 and MPC-HC 1.3.1301.0 and FFDShow and Haali.
If you use FFDShow make sure you use the ffmpeg-mt h264 codec, not the default libavcodec codec.
If you use FFDShow libavcodec codec then one processor thread runs at 100%, the other runs at 0% causing jerky video.
The ffmpeg-mt h264 codec balances out the CPU thread usage.
You'll need a fast modern dual core processor to play these files.

CPU Usage(E8200 2.6GHz): Thread1 Thread2 Average
VLC v1.0.5.............:   25%     35%     30%
MPC-HC v1.3.1301.0.....:   30%     60%     45%
