After reading such specifics in your description I am wondering how my new TV, Samsung LE40C650 will fayre at playing this back!
It manages all mkv I have thrown its way so far...hopefully this won't cause a problem as I wanna grab the whole series!
I'll come back and report...then if anyone else has a samsung TV that plays mkv's, they will know if its worth the download :)
Thanks again!"

Sorry, I don't understand the question.
You just need a satellite dish with LNB plugged into a DVB-S capture card and the software to capture the stream."
