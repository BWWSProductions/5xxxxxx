Cheers!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-12T14:11Z,"LOL  DearMrIce, it is 6.14 TIMES smaller than XviD and 19.4 TIMES smaller than input.
Could your A/V numbers be multiplied?

BTW, there is nothing to compare with. IMHO (and I have stated that regarding [quark]s) - goal is to achieve something like A5.0001/V5.0001, watch-ability level - and I am sure that [quark] goes well beyond that.

@sanyam: Thanks sanyam."
