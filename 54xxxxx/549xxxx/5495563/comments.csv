Another pathetic chick flick which I have spent the entirety picking the bacteria out of my Belly, Toes and arse leaving me with no will to live. Im suing the producer for 22 english pence. (the cost of a blank dvd -R )"
[V],.BONE.,2010-04-21T01:44Z,"any chance of uploading the big i am 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1225302/
its out on dvd but no release groups has ripped it yet :)"
,bancapitalism,2010-04-21T06:31Z,"good quality and sound but man o man , this movie fucking sucks ass.
Enough movies with soldiers going to Iraq or some other middle eastern country story, fucking boring chick-flick shit. "
,DEAalsmeer,2010-04-21T17:41Z,wow you've uploaded a lot of films! I hope you keep doing this! thank you so much!
,jrgray6,2010-04-26T19:01Z,"ughh why are all these rips so skinny?  640 x 256
is not a good res.  640 x 360 should be the bare-minimum... any less height and I have 8 inches of black bar top and bottom.  I appreciate the up, but these skinny res rips are almost useless"
,Rod321,2010-05-02T01:42Z,Thanks a lot FXG
[T],Pongydog,2010-05-04T18:00Z,"640x360 gives an aspect ratio of 16:9,
This movie is 'scope so is in a 2.35 aspect ratio.
So the resolution FXG has used is correct.

The convert this into exactly 16:9 you'd have to pan and scan the image (ie crop the sides of the image)"
,aika4u,2010-05-06T02:08Z,FXG definetly the best in quality...thankx
