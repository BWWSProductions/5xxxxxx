"Lurks in the shadows. Hides in the dark.

Simon. Simon. Simon Dark.

If you're good he'll stay away.

If you're bad he'll make you pay.

Lurks in the shadows. Hides in the dark.

Simon. Simon. Simon Dark."


Simon Dark is a mysterious vigilante who acts as a protector of a neighborhood called "the Village" in Gotham City.  He seems to have been created from a number of dead bodies and, as such, has no memory of his past. 

Written by Steve Niles (30 Days of Night) and illustrated by Scott Hampton (Batman: Gotham County line).
