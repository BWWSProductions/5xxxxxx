Have a safe, and great weekend, all!"
,tavery80,2010-04-16T22:43Z,"Many thanks for these.  But the titling is throwing my MP3 player for a loop!  Anyone know how I can modify these files so the player doesn't play all first hours from multiple days, then all second hours, etc.?  Change filenames, alter MP3 tags, what?"
,BarrySoetoro,2010-04-17T00:02Z,"Another week gone... wow.

Thanks, jwhitt!"
,tavery80,2010-04-17T01:41Z,"An FYI...For anyone having the same issue I inquired about, altering the MP3 tags of each days podcast to specify the Album field carry the date of the podcast will break them down into both individual days as well as sequential hours for each day."

,Johannes58,2010-04-17T08:48Z,tavery80... try VLC media player
,thunderbum,2010-04-17T09:48Z,"@tavery80: yeah, I've had this problem for a long time so I've had to listen to one day's worth at a time. PITA.

@Johannes58: I'll give that a try, but will that enable tavery and I to re-tag? I've tried a number of softwares to try to re-tag and no joy :(

Thanks for the suggestion :)
