[V],neon,2010-04-16T09:20Z,"This is a scene release ok... Its not a race watermelon,how many copys of this album do you think are going to be on this site today...are you putting that comment on them all...dont think so."
,BaronVonWatermelon,2010-04-16T10:33Z,"I'm not trying to be an arse, I'm simply saying that I don't see any point in uploading a torrent that not only already exists but is also well seeded and (judging by the file size) is the exact same file..."
[V],neon,2010-04-16T10:54Z,"So your saying because you uploaded it first there is no need for anyone else to upload it....sorry bud i wasn't clear on the rules...and im not trying to be smart either but heres an example of how this album will probably end up..

do you think we need all these gorillaz albums"
,hearyouful,2010-04-16T11:30Z,Many Thanks and PEACE you are all Great :)
,BaronVonWatermelon,2010-04-16T11:37Z,"Personally I don't feel that we need any Gorillaz albums, but I suppose that is besides the point.

This isn't about who uploaded it first, it's about taking the effort to upload something that's already available. You could have spent that time uploading something that isn't already posted.

But all that nonsense aside, you've got to admit that this is a great album."
[V],neon,2010-04-16T11:43Z,"Yeah its a great album alright....heres the link to Watermelons upload if you want to use it...cant say fairer than that :o)
