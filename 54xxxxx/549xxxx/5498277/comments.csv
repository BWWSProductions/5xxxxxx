,who-m-i,2010-04-17T12:06Z,"WhatÂ´s happening?
99.8%  since yesterday...   DoesnÂ´t anyone got the complete movie!"
[T],agentpiratebay,2010-04-17T14:06Z,99.8 is complete. The avi is perfectly viewable.
,KNIGHTWATCH903,2010-04-17T20:16Z,What's the big deal behind this upload? And why this could not be completed 100%?
,WvBrsci,2010-04-17T20:39Z,"This is silly!

May I guess that the 99.8% thing is to ensure that people don't dl and go offline? I'll make a deal: You give us 100%, and I'll seed til there's a s:p ratio of at least 0.5, and keep it on queue for a month or more. I always do, anyway, on torrents that _complete_ (and aren't fake). As 1 of 8 torrents seeding at all times, it'll get an average of 200 kbps, more if it's a ""greedy"" torrent. If it doesn't complete, I'll delete it as soon as I've watched it (it IS watchable, folks). I have a better than 1 share ratio on it, and will consider my conscience quite clear."
[T],agentpiratebay,2010-04-18T00:09Z,"It's some kind of glitch I don't know why, google it and you'll find more cases like this. This torrent completes at 98.8 and it won't affect your share ratio as long as you keep it uploading.

But if you insist a 100 for some reason, I've upload a Part I for that matter. Here's what you should do: Remove the current task and change the cd1 file name to this:

Ben.Hur.2010.Part1.HDTV.XviD-DaPoO

Download the new seed here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5501308

Open the new seed and save it to your folder that holds the 98% Part 1 avi, then it'll start the harh automatically and if you're not complete it will get you there. Otherwise voila."
,WvBrsci,2010-04-18T03:40Z,"Thanks for the explanation! I tend to get a bit overly annoyed with such stubborn details, especially when I don't know the cause. I feel MUCH better, now! :-)

Thanks for the up, as well. I forgot that in my first post, didn't I... *feeling the shame of ingratitude*"
