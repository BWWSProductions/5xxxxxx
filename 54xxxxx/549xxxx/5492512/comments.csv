[T],susiccu,2010-04-16T05:28Z,"I will in 2 h, usually 12 h per day. What a sad, may I underline about 30 Leechers who do not seed?

Seed is also a return on what you received first, isn't it?"
,D0gmeat,2010-04-16T23:49Z,It is sad but I don't think anyone's gotten it 100% yet. :( I am stuck at 98.7% and getting to 3.0 in ratio.
[T],susiccu,2010-04-19T06:15Z,"I see. I leave open 12 h per day, maybe you're in US and our time is different.
I'm so sorry for this incovenient, try taking you laptop earlier or later than your normal schedule.

[T],susiccu,2010-04-19T18:51Z,"I think 14 seeders are a good answer.

Thank you for sharing and keep seeding"
