,noddybrian,2010-05-16T23:50Z,Thanks so much for uploading this program- your work is appreciated by so many that can't get it on TV especially in the UK ( wold be nice if others that Dloaded this posted some encouragement ) keep up the good work TvTeam.
,noddybrian,2010-05-17T00:00Z,Strangely the tone of this great series seems to have changed- maybe it's knowing that Captain Phil Harris won't finish this season- having watched several series of Deadliest Catch you feel close to some of the characters even though you've never met. Thanks as always goes to the uploader.
