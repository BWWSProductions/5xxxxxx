i don't know if you got a chance to check it out but i replied to your question on my torrent where you left the comment.  i probably should have put it over here on yours but i didn't want people to think i was trying to complain about your uploads or pass comment on you in the negative sense.  obviously i wouldn't do that.  let me know how it works out.  i hope it helps you."
[T],ctang,2010-04-16T18:43Z,"zombifuzz: i posted on your torrent...thanks for the helpful instructions if you read here first

EVERONE: next torrent will be ""Animal House (1978)""...gotta love the classics"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-16T18:46Z,i heard Animal House was hilarious.  i am going to check it out.  any chance you'll be getting Ninja Assassin?  if you haven't seen if you NEED to.
[T],ctang,2010-04-16T18:50Z,"zombifuzz: i dont know if you noticed but 5 mins ago your skull was pink, now its green...congrats...i cant wait to have my very own pink skull :)

your going to love Animal House...its such a hilarious classic...i will have to pick up Ninja Assassin...i have had requests for it but i dont actually have it"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-16T19:11Z,"i know.  i just noticed my skull turned green. i was like wtf!?  haha.  i am very happy about this.  i guess i am doing my job right and will continue to do so.  i've only been a TPB member since i think november of 2009 and i have already uploaded like 185 torrents and counting.  not bad i guess.  

thanks for the congrats and i hope you get one too because if you continue these awesome dvd-r's i think you deserve one!"
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-16T19:50Z,"ok im kinda confused.  a movie from the late 70's is dated but a movie from 1944 isn't?  44 sounds kind of ancient to me and the movie HAS TO BE COMPLETE CRAP if its from 1944.  and i dont care if the movie was upped 1000 times on TPB with 10,000 on every single one. i refuse to download from anyone other than DJFred & Ctang when it comes to dvd-rs.  

sorry man but you haven't gotten me to even think about downloading from anyone else.  try to have a good day, you sound so serious haha.  you sound like a professional critic of movies.  do you get paid for comments like that?  "
[T],zombifuzz,2010-04-16T19:54Z,"oh yea i forgot the fact that there are only TWO, yes TWO dvd-rs of Animal House and 1 has 0 seeds and there other only 1.  so if 2 uploads with only 1 seed between the both is ""uploaded here several times in fact"" then i must be a complete retard and not know a single thing about anything.  there is a BIG difference between a DVDRip of a movie and a DVD-R movie.  extras, menus and everything else that matters.  plain and simple.   end of story."
[T],ctang,2010-04-17T01:07Z,"i just thought i should point out that i check here first before uploading so i knew that there was only a few copies of Animal House out there that were dvd-r's...im saying that towards Tseug not you zombifuzz, which in fact am about to say thanks to for backing me...THANKS!! lol...as for Tseug saying that Animal House isnt a good movie and hasnt aged well, then seriously whatever because its one of the best comedies still out there...could have been made 100 years ago and i would still think that...furthermore, if we didnt have Animal House then we wouldnt have other movies like Grandma's Boy (which i will also be uploading but isnt as good as Animal House), Caddyshack, Major League, Airplane, Plane Trains & Automobiles and so many other movies that use slapstick comedy to make people laugh...i dont know how someone that says that a movie was one of their favorites back in the day and says that it hasnt aged well if so many DVDRips are on here and basically everyone i know (including parents, relatives, and friends) love Animal House...its a classic end of story...not often i go on a rant about something...lol

@Agentbay: ya i have this completely uploaded in less than 16 hrs whereas before with the block size set to the default 4mb it was taking nearly 35-40 hours...much better :)"
