When Do you Need to convert Fonts?
---------------------------
#1: Between Windows & Mac
If you want to convert fonts' formats  between Microsoft Windows & Mac.

#2: Convert Fonts between .OTF &. TTF

Because Adobe & other softwares sometimes don't support .OTF (Open type format)  fonts so you need to convert them to .TTF type fonts (True Type format.).

TransType can convert fonts between Mac  and Windows, and between all major font formats: PostScript, TrueType and OpenType. TransType supports batch conversion so users can convert hundreds of fonts at a time, even directly from Stuffit (.sit) archives. With TransType Pro, you can convert your fonts into the new universal OpenType format with Unicode  encoding to make them compatible with the newest versions of Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office and Apple iWork. TransType Pro even automatically adds some OpenType typographic features such as ligatures or fractions!

TransType addresses common font problems. Font conversion may help repair corrupt fonts that are rejected by the system or cause problems in printing. Owners of Multiple Master fonts can use TransType to convert them into normal OpenType, Type 1 or TrueType fonts and use them in any application. Font designers who use TypeTool, ScanFont or other font editors can use TransType Pro to create professional-quality OpenType fonts. The Pro edition includes Python scripting support.
