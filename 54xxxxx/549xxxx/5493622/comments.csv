,Blacker.Death.Metal,2011-02-11T12:31Z,"This is the move incomplete Discography i have ever seen.
No cave
No b-sides
No Hyper Music
Not even Hullabaloo
How you not have hullabaloo?????"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2011-02-11T12:32Z,"Only 60 songs?
I know they have at least 94 completely unique tracks, not to mention heavy remixes and remakes."
,ust2,2011-03-13T05:28Z," It's a good starter compilation, but I wouldn't use the term ""Full"" in describing it ;)

 Still i'm thankful, my backup discs are all corrupt now and this beats the hell out of finding things individually."
,kingofmiami6,2011-03-24T09:59Z,Muse for life!
,netkai,2011-04-11T14:48Z,d/l'd at 1.5-1.9 MBps XD

,rthynlly11,2011-11-06T09:39Z,"downloaded quick thx, but in resistance you're missing I belong to you its in the list but not in the torrent ????
i agree there are albums missing too, but it does say in the description studio albums! perhaps take the ""full"" out of the title
otherwise a good d/l fast and all works fine"
,TPB_Buddy,2011-12-18T22:07Z,What is the bitrate?
