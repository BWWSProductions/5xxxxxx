[V],twentyforty,2010-04-14T08:03Z,"@lilars: It is type of show which develops some kind of relationship and addiction (you know what I mean, right?). It is very different ball-game than once-per-week shows, you watch these shows (Late shows) every night, day by day, you see how man gets old, you watch how he entertains coming from mother's funeral, you have unique opportunity to see in person usually faceless book authors, politicians in awkward conversations, jokes, and not just - as in many, many Late shows - a celebrities, actors and starlets, persons who have five-minutes-of-glory winning the competition in fast-eating.
It is comedy show, of course, but it has something that other Late shows do not - an extremely smart man who can both entertain the people and show them that something other than hedonism do exist and does have a purpose. "
