why is this version so impossible to get on dvd?! myself like many others hold this movie in such high regard as an 80's classic, and also like many others the extended yet awfully remixed dvd version dashed my childhood memories forever! but fear not as this is the original version you most likely saw when you were knee high to a grasshopper. the quality isn't great, but a treat nevertheless, enjoy.
