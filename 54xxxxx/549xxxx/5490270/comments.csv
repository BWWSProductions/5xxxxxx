Thanks very much for this. This movie means SO MUCH to me."

I hardly ever leave a comment unless there is a problem, with this copy it is very poor quality even for a VHS copy, also at 76:10mins at the most important part of the movie where he begins to beat Van Damme it freezes and then skips straight to the end of the movie, so in other words you watch the whole movie just to miss out on the end part which is the most enjoyable, thanks but no thanks uploader (Complete waste of fucking time)"

that is actually how the original cut is. i can't take the credit for the horrible editing. if you've seen the other version of the final fight there are intercut scenes with bruce lee. they have removed them in this version, but obviously have done it very badly."
