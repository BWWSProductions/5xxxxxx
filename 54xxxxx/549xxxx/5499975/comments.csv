,Aizou,2010-04-17T05:47Z,"Oh dear, I am new to Utorrent. How can I change my setting on utorrent because utorrent downloading speed is slow... I am using macbook... Can anyone explain and help me?"
,Otherman101,2010-04-17T06:32Z,"@Aizou  Here is what you need to do:
Step 1)  Get a PC
Step 2)  That's it.

I joke, I joke, seriously.... you should take a look at the connection settings/ setup guide in the new version and make sure your port is properly forwarded on your router.  If it seems fine then the torrent probably doesn't have many seeders or they just don't have good upload rates.  Be patient, it will get faster as more people start downloading."

1. First of all dont listen to Otherman101 about getting a windows machine.

2. Wait a bit it might start out slow. I also recomend getting the bit torrent client Transmission. "
