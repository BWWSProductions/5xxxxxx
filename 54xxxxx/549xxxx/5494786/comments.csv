,bunter39,2012-01-03T04:16Z,"Tried many times over the years to rip, I made a good rip  when I bought the game on the 90's using a CD player that let me also to rip Dreamcasts with the 3rd empty open track for cracking and then burning on anouther 1x burner, yep 1x buring with a caddy for the CD, couldn't copy a copy though!. ( and couldn't find a CD or DVD player to rip the 3rd track of a dreamcast game ever again). The CD player  from memory, it broke and since, bummer!! , back on topic, I need a solution as to my copy of sinistar CAN be installed from the original but I CANT rip a copy using latest ripping software and my PC, I am guessing there is a copy protection no one has cracked for ripping this game, old software I used in the 90's to rip wont work now on my computer today ( no driver updates for my system), commercialism is fun,  help needed to rip a copy and seed."
