aka:
Blow-up (1966)
Blow up (1966)

A successful mod photographer in London frolics in fashion, pop music, marijuana and easy sex, but feels his life is boring and despairing. Then he accidentally captures on film the commission of a murder. 

This was Antonioni's first film in English. It was considered one of the major films of the 60's through 80's, when several where themed around similar plots about photography, surveillance and conspiracy. Some of these were

Blow Out (1981) with John Travolta,

and
The Conversation (1974) with Gene Hackman

This is not my rip, I found it on the net and thought this classic should be found here. Quality is surprisingly good for such an old film.

Color Widescreen DVDrip XviD 560x320, original mono sound.
