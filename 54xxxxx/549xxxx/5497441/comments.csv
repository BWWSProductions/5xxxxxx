,jonnychadootz,2010-04-15T22:51Z,"TY Shuz :)

               Once again.....There are well over 100+ people who dloaded this file, yet there are only 4 people that can say thanks. Is it really that difficult to say TY for something you most likely wouldn't get otherwise? (for free no less) I understand that the file is posted on others sites. So that means there should be something like a minimum of 25 people saying thanks everyday. Tired of people that just expect shit...."
[T],shuazien,2010-04-15T23:31Z,Yup.

,Metal_Is_4_Eva,2010-04-17T00:37Z,Thanx Shu. You are indeed better than all the rest. I hope someday they will erect a statue of you in the middle of times square. Naturally I hope baby vultures peck out the eye balls and nuts out of the stupid statue. Much love bro.
,jonnychadootz,2010-04-17T02:18Z,I was actually yelling at my computer because of that Ashley Dupree Twat. I was sitting there hoping that Opie was going to blow up and toss that cunt out the door. Op's going soft :( That shit wouldn't have flown even a year ago.
