,bokehjoe,2010-05-26T09:05Z,ekarth22--- It sounds like you got lucky and came aroung after the old command lines and switches versions...  A lot of zip apps still offer versions that are still C.L. driven. That was even after the days of 3k+ COBOL punch card programs that I had to submit 1x/day for a run to see how many times I left 1 too many spaces- or inadvertantly added a decimal somewhere. Ok- I digress. Talk about the old days just brings about anxiety attacks. :)
