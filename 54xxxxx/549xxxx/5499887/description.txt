BAD INFLUENCE
Label Hightone 
Orig Year 1983

Bad Influence is one of Robert Cray's best albums ever, and the one that etched him into the consciousness of blues aficionados prior to his mainstream explosion. Produced beautifully by Bruce Bromberg and Dennis Walker, the set sports some gorgeous originals ("Phone Booth," "Bad Influence," "So Many Women, So Little Time") and two well-chosen covers, Johnny "Guitar" Watson's "Don't Touch Me" and Eddie Floyd's Stax-era "Got to Make a Comeback." Few albums portend greatness the way this one did. [This edition included two bonus tracks.] 

Personnel: Robert Cray (vocals, guitar); Albert Clemens (vocals); Warren Rand (saxophone, alto saxophone); Mike Vannice (saxophone, tenor saxophone, keyboards); Dave Olson (drums); David Li (percussion); Night Train Clemons, Tony Matthews, Phillip Walker, Tony Mathews (background vocals).[/color]
