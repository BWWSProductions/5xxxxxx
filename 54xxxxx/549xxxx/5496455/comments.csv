,didakos,2010-05-07T15:17Z,"there are 3 disks in this torrent, if you are only interested only to play the game you can download only disk 1. if you want the whole collection with the extras minigames-cut scenes etc you DL all 3 disks enjoy :D"

,konamijp,2010-08-05T20:14Z,"Nagyszerű torrent feltöltés. Más oldalon nem is találkoztam a PAL verziós kiadással. Köszönöm a lehetőséget, hogy letölthettem."
,zekeisaszekedoes,2010-09-19T03:42Z,"Holy hell, this is impressive.

I'm not one to download counterfeit titles usually, but this version of MGS3 is super-rare and it seems like the only way to get it without paying silly money on eBay.

Including the Network Access Disk was a nice touch, too.  Many thanks to the unknown original uploader."
,PD73,2011-01-12T17:54Z,hmm I burnt only the disc 1 to a dvd but it cannot be played! it just circulates the intro!
,Kaiser-Axis,2011-02-03T06:41Z,"Yeah, I'm having the same problem as PD73.
Loads up, reads memory card, Konami screen, Kojima screen then just has a disc with a question mark flashing on it in the top left-hand corner..."

,xmitchell27,2011-04-01T23:45Z,seed.......... shit
,zekeisaszekedoes,2011-05-03T01:08Z,"Well, I can finally confirm this game works!  I'm using Free McBoot and I installed the game to the harddrive and ran it using Open PS2 Loader 0.8, not a hitch.  In Game Reset works most times, too!  Sadly virtual memory cards don't work so you need space on a real one, but that's a minor hitch.

Ran disc 1 through to completion earlier on, unlocked the stealth camo, infinity facepaint etc that makes for fun hijinx when you play it again.  Great stuff!  The adjustable camera system makes all the difference on some of the trickier sequences, like the escort mission part towards the end."
