Successfully defying the sonic connotations implied by its hometown, the Lashes seek to reinvent Seattle as the new home to wry, punkified pop. Peep Stupid Stupid, the group's blissed-out four-song EP and you'll find yourself in the presence of irresistible, garage-bred rockers like "Death by Mixtape" and "Pop Song." The former is an edgy, confectionary rocker and the closest thing to an anthem, but the latter is equally a winner with a strong melody and frontman Ben Lashes' energetic look at the power pop genre." All it's gonna take is just another pop song/to make everything okay," Lashes soundly proclaims. And the Lashes -- complete with a wicked roll of guitars and keyboards -- are true believers, be it the sturdy, lovelorn "Ex-Mas (Young in Love)" or the scenester-chick homage "It's Your Party." Fun as hell, and superbly crafted, Stupid Stupid easily leaves listeners clamoring for more -- making word that there's a full-length in the band's future superb news for those in need of additional manic pop thrills.
