stopped short about 10 seconds, so that's
all that's missing at the end.

The story and dialog are intact, but a bit
of music isn't when Steve and his boss
Judge Garth leave town together.

I got home just before the end credits started
so I stopped the timer and began a new
video track with part of the end credits.

This episode was just too good not to upload.

Sorry for the inconvenience, but you are 
getting this for free!"
