This episode was probably the final appearance of 
ex-regular Gary Clarke as Shiloh ranch hand Steve Hill.

I don't know why Gary quit this show, but in the 
3rd Season the Steve character was brought back in 
three episodes and this is the last one. Although 
his role in this story is major, in typical 1960s 
custom no explanation was given for his character leaving.
