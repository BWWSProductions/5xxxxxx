The film focuses on philosopher Jacques Derrida who considers ghosts to be the memory of something which has never been present, a theory explored in the film.

Through the experiences of two women in Paris and London, Ghost Dance offers a stunning analysis of the complexity of our conceptions of ghosts, memory and the past. It is an adventure film strongly influenced by the work of Jacques Rivette and Jean-Luc Godard but with a unique and artistic discourse of its own.
