Interpretation
********************************

"Indestructible" is "an anthem for soldiers. It's meant to be something that would make them feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong." According to Draiman, the song also signifies Disturbed's lingering presence and success in the music industry. Draiman comments that the song "kind of symbolizes the fact that we're still fucking here, that we haven't been destroyed, that we withstood the test of time." Guitarist Dan Donegan furthers this point, stating "We feel that we've become indestructible to be able to survive this long in the business, and continuing a success with it." Draiman concludes, "We have been through a lot. No matter what gets thrown at us, as a band, no matter what happens in the musical environment, we're still here, we're still viable, and still standing."

Music video
********************************

A music video went into production in June 2008 with Noble Jones as the director, and was unveiled on August 20, 2008. It features high-concept battle scenes, reminiscent of the films 300 and 10,000 BC, intercut with footage of the band performing the song. The video shows the progression of war throughout history; from basic fighting with spears, and arrows, to using modern weaponry such as firearms.
