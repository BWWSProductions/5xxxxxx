Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



Collectibles reissued Tommy Tutone's first two albums, Tommy Tutone and Tommy Tutone 2, on this 1997 CD. It essentially acts as a greatest-hits collection, since it contains all of their big hits, but it also contains the majority of their best album tracks, thereby making it a definitive career overview. (Quote from Allmusic)

Even if you were NOT a teenager in the 80's like I was, if you like basic rock 'n' roll, I think you'll enjoy BOTH of the albums. Everyone knows the 867-5309/Jenny song, but I feel the 'Angel Say No' song is MUCH better, and the other songs on the albums are also GREAT! I've also added a GREAT sound-track song the band made for the movie 'The Last American Virgin' - "Teen Angel Eyes". Please enjoy, and please seed/share. ;D
