I am registered blind/visually impaired. While this content is of little use to you, not everyone who uses bittorrent can say the same. For me, the audio description track is vital, and increases my enjoyment and understanding of the film.

It would appear that some teams, eg BOW and 2LIONS, actively strip this vital content along with the apparent ""junk"". They seem to think that if you don't speak English or have good vision that DVDs are useless.

In some ways this feels like a personal attack. It is certainly discriminatory. Many visually impaired people use bittorrent.

In future, please leave the audio description track intact. If you have any current releases can be reseeded with the audio description track I for one would appreciate it.

Thank you."
