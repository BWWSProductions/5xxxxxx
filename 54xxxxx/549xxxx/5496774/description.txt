An exceptional singer/songwriter Yoav is a much talked about artist. His unique musical influences have resulted in a sound that fuses the singer-songwriter tradition with Eastern scales and rhythms, all rooted in a dance-club groove.

All of the sounds on Charmed and Strange and, for the most part, on A Foolproof Escape Plan were created on the acoustic guitar, all drums, bass, keyboard and piano sounds were beaten and dragged out of his trusty Lowden acoustic. The live performance follows the same route, with the help of several loop stations and Yoavâ€™s unusually hand-like feet.

True to his reputation as global citizen, Yoav spent 2009 writing songs in London, South Africa, and Venice Beach, California, collaborating with a mÃ©lange of musicians and artists from around the world to add to the richness of his sound. Joey Waronker â€” the outstanding American music producer and drummer who has worked with Thom Yorke, Beck, Smashing Pumpkins, and R.E.M. - took the producerâ€™s chair.
