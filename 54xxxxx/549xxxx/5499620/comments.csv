At first it was the first Moma mission, where u fight 3 guys, whenever I completed the mission a loading screen would come up and nothing would happen.

I started a new game and did that mission first and then it worked without that problem. So i reloaded my old savegame where I had completed other missions, and it worked all of a sudden.

NOW, i'm having the same problem where you go with the two brothers to pick up some cars that are on the back of a truck. When I get to the alley, it goes into a Loading Screen and just gets stuck there. 

Frustrating as I'm pretty far into the game and don't understand why it happens randomly like that

4.Instead of mounting the images, extract them into the folders.
5.Take the images in GTA2(NOT the folder, the IMAGES, there should be 2, data-f and data-g) and copy them to the GTA 1 folder(where all the other data files and setup and all that is.)

,kuklor,2010-05-23T15:33Z,"Can someone please confirm that this torrent is working?
Is the downrip quality 60% just the graphics of the cut scenes or is the entire gameplay affected?

Also are there any instructions?

Thanks thenoobish for sharing."
,shareddocs,2010-05-23T20:11Z,Without the basic game is going?
,Gangxsta,2010-05-24T13:22Z,"@kuklor
I didnt notice the 60% down-rip, only when I watched the TV which I barely touch.
Other than that it works better than my original gta IV"

Thanks for reply.

I'm at 99% now."

Followed Zomane instructions on page 6.

How do you save your game progress?"
,lepond,2010-05-25T06:53Z,"Downloaded for almost 3 days. Took 2 hours to install, but it's ok.
However, when I try to play The Ballad of Gay Tony, or the game freezes after 10 sec of game, or it freezes when I pause the game inside the car (right in the first mission ""I LUV LC"")

Tried to play The Lost and Damned without luck. The game freezes on the loading screen.


Certainlly I am missing something, because, as far as I saw, none had this problem before.

Any hints?"
,lepond,2010-05-25T06:55Z,"Oh, before someone say that my PC probably smells like shit, here's the setup:

Intel Core 2 Duo @2,53Hz each
4GB RAM
nVidia 9500 512mb

I got GTA IV too, and I'm able to play without any problems."
,Gangxsta,2010-05-25T08:25Z,"@kuklor  
Coz my GTA IV was legit I use my GFWL account and that works perfect, Maybe u gotta make an offline account"
,lepond,2010-05-25T17:24Z,"Gangxta is right. You can make an offline account in GFWL. They use the name of ""Local Account"" to represent an offline account.
It's pretty simple. (:"
,kuklor,2010-05-25T18:10Z,"Good torrent! Thanks very much thenoobish.Please post instructions next time.

This is how I got it to work
I used Zomane?s instructions for installation:
1.Get 7Zip / or WinRAR
2.Install it(doh)
3.Make 2 folders, GTA1 and GTA2
4.Instead of mounting the images, extract them into the folders.
5.Take the images in GTA2(NOT the folder, the IMAGES, there should be 2, data-f and data-g) and copy them to the GTA 1 folder(where all the other data files and setup and all that is.)
6.Run setup. (Note: it does take over 1 hour)
It won?t even ask for you to insert disk 2 so you can start it and leave it as it is.


To be able to save your game progress:
1In the game, after doing the opening mission or something it will ask you to create a Windows Live account, press yes
2When the Windows Live menu comes up, press create a new account
3Scroll down the long text and click on the blue hyperlink that says something like create local profile or offline
4Enter a name and you are done :)"
,lepond,2010-05-25T18:39Z,"Anyone know's what's the problem with my game? Check the 5th post above.

Please, help me :~"
,Gangxsta,2010-05-27T15:07Z,"update drivers?

Iv got no idea, are u playing from your local hard drive? Or a second hard drive?"
,lepond,2010-05-27T19:15Z,"Local hard drive.
Drivers are updated already, no virus.

,lepond,2010-06-01T04:02Z,"Ok. So now I got another problem.

I managed to install the game already. However, when I try to play any of the games, it keeps looping on the loading screen.
I already let it work for half an hour, without success.

Well, my hope are nearly zero. So, could someone, please, tell me what's wrong with my game? :~"
,Gangxsta,2010-06-01T15:35Z,lol bro could be a corrupt download

,lepond,2010-06-01T17:28Z,"Both.
The Lost and Damned keeps looping in that loading screen, which shows a bunch of images, etc.

Ballad of Gay Tony keeps looping in the ""I LUV LC"" screen.

Yeah, I'm affraid that you're right about the corrupt download. ):"
,lepond,2010-06-01T17:31Z,"I'll try to do a Manual Hash Verification on the torrent, and see what happens."
,lepond,2010-06-01T17:41Z,"Strange. It keeps 100% after the Hash Verification.
Looks like I'll have to re-download it. However, for the sake of mental health, I won't download it again, and still have the risk to don't work.

,Unit431,2010-10-17T21:53Z,"Zeromant, a repack is a game that has had certain files compressed to reduce overall file size. If the game uses a lot of large video files, the person repacking will usually downgrade the video quality by a certain percentage, which can vastly reduce the overall size of the game by many gigs. Some repacks and rips also convert audio files to mp3's which are, after extraction, converted back to their original formats and placed in, if applicable, whatever base container file they were originally in.

Rips, on the other hand, are traditionally games which have certain files removed altogether. Music might be completely removed, or voice over files, videos, so on and so forth. Most rips these days (usually when it says ""FULL Rip"") are basically just repacks though, with all gameplay aspects intact after extraction and decompression, so you have to read the description carefully before downloading. You want to generally avoid any altered game that is actually missing gameplay elements like video and sound."
,elcapizzo,2010-10-18T15:05Z,"fffffffffuuuuuuuuuuu....

Where are the patches? Do you mean to download them separately from a host site like Gamespot? A lot of the comments on the patches say they stuff the game up and cause issues, I think I might just try it without any patches."

Maybe it's because I'm trying to install it to a different drive other than C: (I have a SSD so no free space).

The only solutions I see seem to be either a dodgy sounding registry 'fixer' (which I'm guessing is just spyware) or getting some Microsoft Script Engine (which isn't available for download from MS right now and is supposed to be for Windows 2003, I'm on 7)

,xiyd_zack,2011-04-20T09:19Z,Damn it took me 5 hours and still the extracting file is still like that its like nothing happened ....it took me 5 days to download this and i cant even install it what the hell is this thenoobish ???what will i do?
,xiyd_zack,2011-04-21T04:31Z,"Fuck you motherfucking BITCH!!! ...I just figure it out my self!!IT WORKS  FINE MAN!!!I didnt follow any of the otherrs instruction i just mounted it it works PERFECTLY FINE!!! tnx the NOOBISH!!!..
THIS IS WHAT I have done:
Mount the disk 1 first then run autoplay or(setup) then you should install it to an internal drive like Hardrive(C) or hardriveI(D).because if you installed it into an external disk it wont extract.
then when it ask for disk 2 you shoul eject first the disk 1 or (it wont recognized it) then mount the disk 2 ^^(piece of cake)then wait for the installation to finish then (tada) finish then click the icon on your dektop (the GTA ICON) then you could play ^^when you click the desktop icon the text (RAZOR) will come out..if this came oput then youyr game is working wait for it then you should play (beware the installation might take 2-5 hours."

Installed on 1,5 hours, no glitches. Worked like a charm, thanks for the up :)"
,Checksum32,2011-08-16T05:07Z,"I've played the game through completely, and it works fine. However, as mentioned before, the files have to be extracted before it works.

Extract both .iso's to their folder, copy the contents of the second image to the first one. Namely, data-f.bin and data-g.bin to where all the setup.exe and other files are.

Run setup.exe from there.

I did experience some freezing, about 2-3 times throughout the whole game. Not sure if it is the game or just my system. Regardless, this torrent worked for me using the steps above. Thanks OP."
