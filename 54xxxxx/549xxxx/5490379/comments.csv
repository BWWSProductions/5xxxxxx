I wonder if Buddha is comfortable with you thieving from others to proseletyse for him ?

Hey dont get me wrong, were all thieves here... just some of us are sanctimonius, delusional wankers like your man raymond here."
,yuna27,2010-04-20T21:38Z,"N/o, but why does all these bluray rips get shrinked to 480p?
Isn't the idea of bluray to have at least a 720p in HEIGHT? Or even better, full HD 1080p for our HD lcd tv's... Just wondering."
,yuna27,2010-04-22T14:31Z,Very nice touching movie by the way. I loved every bit of it and will buy the DVD as soon as it is out here!
