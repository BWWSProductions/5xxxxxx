,kenasona,2010-05-03T08:21Z,"Hey Lifechanger,

I noticed that the Avatar torrent was up sometime yesterday.. But now it's gone.
Please don't let a few bad eggs ruin it for you and the rest of us who love your releases.
You're still one of the best uploaders & I'm looking forward to more good stuff from you. Keep it cool.."
,idkwiw,2010-05-03T09:21Z,"kenasona, i believe he is right going away. he gave people a warning on avatar torrent, and still it didnt work. people are idiots. look, this torrent as well, one guy saying thanks and other two just making requests, come on, uploader will upload what he wants.
lifechanger, thanks for everything."
,beckinsale_95,2010-05-03T13:36Z,"What's with your kingdomkvcd site??? Users need to post an introduction before they could browse the site??? Users need to follow introduction rules, like ""should be 3 sentences blah blah blah"" ""tell us something interesting about yourself"" ""where you're from"" ""be creative"" ...etc what's with that?! jeeez... 

It's hard to believe SM is part of this group..."
