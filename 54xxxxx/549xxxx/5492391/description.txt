This is a real working copy of VFR Real Scenery Vol1. Other torrents on TPB, and other trackers, require a separate download, are huge downloads and do not work. This is working and no crack needed. Simply mount and install. If you download this, please comment. I am taking the time to upload over 9GB of content, so if you find it useful please seed and comment.

Just Flight's VFR Real Scenery uses the very latest digital aerial images of the UK to transform Flight Simulator X into the real landscape you can see from the air. With brilliant resolution, night lighting and water effects, this scenery really is as real as it gets!

VFR stands for Visual Flight Rules - this is the way that pilots navigate when they arenâ€™t using complex instruments they look at a map and then pinpoint landmarks on the ground to work out their course and position. Itâ€™s the most common form of recreational flying undertaken in the UK, but to do this in a flight simulator requires scenery thatâ€™s exactly the same as the real landscape. VFR Real Scenery is an amazing piece of software that does just that...

Fly over England and Wales in Flight Simulator X using VFR Real Scenery and you can sample the view you'd get from a real aircraft. You can see the real countryside from the air and pinpoint every key landmark. They're all featured - streets, buildings, rivers, lakes, reservoirs - and all at extremely high resolution and detail! 

As well as accurate scenery the VFR Real Scenery series includes custom water features, night lighting effects and superb 9.6m mesh which hugely improves the accuracy of the relief - the ups and downs have never been so precise!

VFR Real Scenery uses 25cm aerial photographic data of England and Wales to create a high resolution scenery optimised for 1m display in Flight Simulator X.

The software includes 9.6m digital terrain data to vastly improve the accuracy of the relief in Flight Simulator X.

Main water features are individually rendered with Flight Simulator water effects. You can land a seaplane on the lakes and rivers in VFR Real Scenery!

Night lighting effects are customised for extra realism.

VFR RS includes the options to load the scenery in sections or at lower resolutions for more modestly specified PCs.
