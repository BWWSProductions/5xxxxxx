,ToTheGrind,2010-04-16T14:34Z,"Seems like the reason for slow downloads on the movie itself compared to the high amount of seeders is that people seem to be downloading the sample, which took me well under a minute to download whereas the movie is taking agggeeess."

,dardar6t9,2010-04-17T02:57Z,I meant to say that the animated characters in Disneys Hercules were more human and gave better performances than the wooden acting in this pile of shit covered in special effects to hide how bad it is

,O_-me-_R,2010-04-21T02:13Z,"this movie had alot of potential but it feels as mentioned earlier rushed, disoriented and I will go so far and say its illogical in the fantasy enviroment it's outplayed in. I watched this in the theathre in 3d and i can tell you that it was a big waste there was no 3d effect what so ever. So whatever point i could have taken for the effects was thrown right there."

People who go out of their way to continue internet arguments are the dumbest fucks on the internet, anyone who comments here who isnt an idiot wouldnt return to see if someone has replied to their post.
