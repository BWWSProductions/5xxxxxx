NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Clash of the Titans 2010
Right firstly thanks to a special friend for the video ....audio is our own.
Well at one stage we wasn't going to release this as it was a right pain in the ass.....mainly due to the cammer
having the shakes :lol:
Well to get this anywhere near good we've had to cut the source up into alot of small pieces and rotate,crop and filter
each one differently and then resize them to the same res and join together......took days.
So on some parts the AR might look a bit off and other parts it looks fine,we tried to find a nice balance inbetween so.
Audio was nice and sycning wise,it wasn't too bad.....10cuts or so in total.

Anyway we have decided to release this now,but i will warn you there is still some parts you can tell when the cammer moves
because you might see some black borders here and there...but after viewing and checking we think it's worth the release.
