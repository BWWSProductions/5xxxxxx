[V],TvTeam,2010-04-13T03:02Z,"Blanne, we start seeding right after we upload a torrent.

It takes 30 minute for TPB to show up seeder/leecher numbers."
,VitalogyPJ,2010-04-13T03:50Z,"Its possible to configure utorrent with tvteam feeds so it download what i want in automatic?

If so, can you please tell me why?

Thanks guys."
