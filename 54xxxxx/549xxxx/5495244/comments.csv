,sexyjvs,2010-04-14T12:50Z,"Yeah but, Why rip the spanish language???"
,Hellstalker,2010-04-14T15:00Z,Finally... Thanks man
,lord_killa,2010-04-14T15:34Z,"sexyjvs, the reason is to get the best possible bitrate from the video compression."
,lydonit13,2010-04-15T16:02Z,"I'm surprised there's no bluray copy yet.  I check TPB regularly, hoping to see it available.  Security must be tight at the disc pressing factory.  I guess I'll have to wait for the official release next week."

,wabbitman,2010-04-17T15:38Z,"I'm getting a little jerkyness in the video with this file as well, what am I doing wrong..! ;(  Could it be that I'm using too high burnrate? Used 4x this time, program was ImgBurn. :/"
