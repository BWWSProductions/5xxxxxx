[T],artpepper,2010-04-14T23:56Z,"That wasn't what I meant and you know it. Anyway, aren't you meant to be off somewhere killing puppies or drowning kittens or something...?"
[T],artpepper,2010-04-15T06:05Z,"PS: Lest anyone think I'm being needlessly rude to @MachIICumshot , I'm not...it's a joke carried over from another upload of mine that @MC commented on...."

Works great for the pesky keygens. I don't have to worry about viruses when I test them with this too. I tested it with 10.6 ad 10.5

,iPeck,2010-04-19T14:39Z,parralel desktops or bootcamp are the only sh*t. Final dot.
,keekz,2011-10-27T21:07Z,"I found that merely having X11 installed didn't enable this program to work. I had to open the X11 application (Applications>Utilities>X11) after opening Macindows. Then it worked flawlessly. Great for Keygens. Thanks for the upload!!!

Running 10.6.8 Snow Leopard"
