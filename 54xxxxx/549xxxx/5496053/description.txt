Macindows 0.8 

Mac OS X 








"Macindows lets you run many Microsoft Windows applications for Windows on your Macintosh without Windows. Macindows combines Wine and X11 in a way that Ã­s easy to use and affordable.



When you think about it, what really stops you running Windows programs on Apple hardware? The modern Apple computer uses an Intel processor. From a hardware point of view, there is very little difference between Macintosh and PC. Only one thing stands in the way: software. Macs run OS X, PCs run Windows.



But suppose there was a piece of software running on Macs that converted Windows operating system requests into Mac OS X requests. Enter Macindows."






What's New in Version 0.8:




Support for shared 32/64-bit setups.
Dwarf debug info support for better backtraces.
More standard actions supported in MSI.
Support for TIFF image format in WinCodecs.
A number of Direct3D improvements.
Shell fixes for better Internet Explorer support.
Various bug fixes.






@artpepper says: Please accept my apologies but I don't know if this is cracked or if it's just the 30-Day Free Trial version. I'm almost sure it's cracked (considering the source) but I could be wrong. I'm not a Mac-user but I thought this looked like a useful app for people who are, so I've uploaded it. Please let me know if it works properly.
