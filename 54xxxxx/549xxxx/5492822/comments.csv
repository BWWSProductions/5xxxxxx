i hate wasting bandwidth, and i'm sure you guys do too.

[T],Abrasax,2010-04-12T21:10Z,I had some torrents that did that to. I think I did some mistakes like change something in the archive or retagged some files after I made the torrent. Could be that. So I don't do that any more :).
[T],Abrasax,2010-04-12T21:11Z,By the way Thanks for a whole lot of good uoloads.
[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-12T21:14Z,"see thats the thing, i'm really good about not ""touching"" the folders after their ready, i have them all organized in their own folder, the only other thing i can think of is that i was listening to one of the tracks while i made the torrent, and after i closed winamp, some value changed somewhere or something and yeah FAIL. oh well i guess i can just hope it dosent happen again.

and you quite welcome, any requests?"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-12T23:07Z,"just realized a mistake i made with the same file, just remove the .!ut from the extention and it'll play"

Do you still take requests? Jethro Tull's ""Aqualung"" would be great!
The 25th Anniversary CD edition is unusually well mastered and I would love to compare... :P"
