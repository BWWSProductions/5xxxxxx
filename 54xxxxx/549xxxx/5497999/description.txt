Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



To clarify the "language" of this concert, there really is no speaking in it, and the singing in it is in Armenian, but that language choice was not available in the drop-down list, so I selected Russian as Russian is the defacto second language of Armenia.

The Shoghaken Ensemble, Armeniaâ€™s preeminent folk ensemble, is captured for the first time, live in concert on DVD. Shoghaken has appeared throughout the world, presenting authentic Armenian music and dance in the most prestigious halls of Europe and the USA, including sold-out concerts at New Yorkâ€™s Carnegie Hall, Theatre de la Ville in Paris, Kennedy Center, Kimmel Center, Skirball Center, Cleveland Museum and the Rudoslstadt Festival in Germany, White Nights Festival in St. Petersberg, Russia and the Smithsonian Folk Festival in Washington D.C.
