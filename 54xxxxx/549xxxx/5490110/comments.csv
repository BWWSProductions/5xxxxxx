,ZenRhino,2010-04-10T23:19Z,"Thanks for the quick UP!!!

FYI people: this event was held in Abu Dhabi - so it already happened... meaning this is legit!!

(no spoilers please for those who haven't seen it yet, ok?)"
,Takuma4,2010-04-10T23:23Z,Thanks alot! IF it is legit that is... I'm not getting my hopes up just yet.
,van_cleeff,2010-04-10T23:44Z,Oooooooh yes! Thanks from Holland!!
,freakaccident,2010-04-10T23:46Z,WELL IS IT FUCKING GOOD QUALITY ANYBODY? PS3 FRIENDLY? Come on people lets hear your ratings before we all buy the event and waste our $. Thanks again natureboy1987 if it's legit. 
,catamaranman,2010-04-10T23:53Z,ZenRhino is right it did happen early this morning US time so it probably is legit.....I will post again with details after I watch a bit of it.....also will try on PS3.... 
,Night-Wind,2010-04-11T00:16Z,Quality?
,Raulll87,2010-04-11T00:19Z,Is this HD quality? 
,ffonzones,2010-04-11T00:21Z,it's 100% legit good quality.....OTRT honestly is to me the best place for mma torrents. they don't have every event from the beginning of time but they're usually first or second to have the upload going and it's normally fast as hell!!!! thanks as always NATUREBOY!!! 
,malbolgia1999,2010-04-11T00:44Z,When I Preview This with Bitcomet it is the super mario movie from 92
,bloodred125,2010-04-11T01:21Z,can someone whos downloaded it and is watching it please COMMENT!!!!!!!!!!!
,JoePeanut,2010-04-11T01:21Z,"Yeah, something seems fishy with this one.  Right off the bat there were 20 seeds, yet thousands of peers all with less than 1%.  Where could those 20 seeds have finished so quickly, yet none of them available?"
,Raulll87,2010-04-11T01:40Z,"Is it really fake or are you guys just assuming??? I'm at 44.9% done, and it won't let me preview it, may be fake."
,RMOC,2010-04-11T02:03Z,"It's not fake, it's been compromised by fake seeds, those 20 seeds were uploading fake stuff. 
That's why people are seeing porn and Mario. 
If it was the same thing then you can tell it's fake but since there are two different things you know there are fake seeds.
OTRT is a trusted tracker that puts out quality stuff."
,Raulll87,2010-04-11T02:18Z,"Well it should be done with in one hour or so, I will post if it is fake or not soon for those who are still confused."
,zxambo,2010-04-11T03:01Z,"thanks very much natureboy, and for the tip about otrt.com,  took me 3hrs to get to 62% on here but now ive switched over to otrt im downing at over 400kbs with an eta of 12 mins :D

,zxambo,2010-04-11T03:21Z,"ok i have it and it is perfect,  have switched back to here to upload for you guys for a while, though i would recommend going to otrt.com to get it faster

Thanks yet again natureboy!!  am off to watch some ufc now :D"
,Raulll87,2010-04-11T03:35Z,"I just got a preview because I'm 77% finished, and it looks like the real deal!! I suggest you start downloading if you want to watch it. Once its done ill let ya'll know if its all in good quality!"
,NewfieJason,2010-04-11T03:39Z,7 seeders....lmao you selfish basterds!!!

,chrome44,2010-04-12T02:23Z,"Damn lol, 14 seeding out of almost 4000"
,superbanned,2010-04-12T02:30Z,Now THAT's WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT!!!! Thanks a bunch
,catamaranman,2010-04-12T21:16Z,"Hey, guess what?  Since this event was spoiled for me by some dickheads on TPB I discovered bestmmatorrents.com has a spoiler-free timezone for 72 hours after a main event.  Also OMG they have complete fighters career torrents and OLD UFC with decent quality.....im never coming to TPB again for UFC events.....Fuck you Jonathan Bacon and Jonmbot"
,crazymcdazy,2010-04-13T03:31Z,"A-10
V-6

this is not high quality

good on low rez, very poor on my 42"""
,tempid123,2010-04-13T19:02Z,"I am a big UFC fan... but 112 is disappointing. 
The most boring fights ever... 
Do not waste you time and bandwidth downloading it..."
,Lassik,2010-04-15T18:25Z,"Great copy, shitty fights."
,rayvkt,2010-04-25T13:02Z,"Thanks for upload great quality
A:7
V:7
Disapointing match, I fast fwd most of the fights they just run around, the fighters are scared of getting hurt. Especially Anderson Silva is very anoying fighter should never let him fight anymore."
,afgaviria,2010-05-14T05:56Z,thanks mate.
