i just saw this on Azureus search, comments on Kickass torrents were saying the same.
Seeeeed, please seeeed, stuck at %99.9. so i left a comment telling the guys the same.

As Leto says, files play at nearly complete, it seems the NFO is what's stopping completion but even if it was the XviD .avi, it would still play at %80 just with a little dropout.

Remember that one guys, i realised that back in 2004.

Pass it on when you see this happen again, films, TV shows whatever, so long as most completes, VLC will play it.

i've even recoded files i really wanted to watch but at %60-70 complete before seeder abandoned swarms, the.avi shells were incomplete and wouldn't play, recoding fixes it with dropout but that dropout shrinks with the recode so it jumps frames instantly, annoying but on rarer films or TV shows whatever, worth doing if you want to watch what you can from what you were able to complete.

Peace. : )
