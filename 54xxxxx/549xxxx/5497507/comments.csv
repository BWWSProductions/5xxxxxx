I mean that need to change line in Instal Fodler: and type your dir, where is the game on your disk
Another thing, when i had GianAntiSpyware, when I run .reg file, it always asking to allow or block..and when I click allow, still .reg file was blocking...after uninstaling Gians spyware, it wet well 
So unpack the game, download GTA 4 EFLC nodvd from here: http://ulozto.cz/4570607/gtaiv.eflc.nodvd.exe 
Run nodvd, instal it using your path to game dir, than copy crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5497507/GTA_IV__Episodes_From_Liberty_City_Crack___.Reg and than write to your .reg file what I wrote at the biginning, than run .reg, it asked U to copy to your registration, click on yes and it should work :)

,flamemc1,2010-04-18T04:13Z,"Right i finally got this to work, follow @sharky4687 discription of what to do and i got it to work, its nothing to do with gfwl or if you have gta4 already on ure system, its all to do with the regedit setting, start with a fresh extraction, delete anything youve done already including the .reg files youve added, and extract the files to this exact locastion 

C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City

You dont need to change the .reg file in the crack then, and then just follow these exact instructions, also make sure the contents of EFLC is in the location above and not in the EFLC folder.


Alright I got this working perfectly on W7 x64

This is how you do:

1.Download this torrent (ofc.)
2. Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5497507/GTA_IV__Episodes_From_Liberty_City_Crack___.Reg (If it shows that it's a virus I recommend that you should uninstall your AV because it sucks)
3. extract The game into C:\program files\rockstar games\
4. extract the crack into the EFLC folder. double click the EFLCINSTALL.reg file and apply.
5. open up regedit and locate HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

AND (If you're using x64 I think)

HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now you should make new strings in the wow6432 folder. Give them the same name and value as the ones in HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now to InstallFolder key you should type in the location of the game.. e.g. ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City\EFLC""
5. Install games for windows - live program
6. Start the game with LaunchEFLC "

,s_phrozen,2010-04-25T23:37Z,"""Load Failed. Start A New Game."" Crash Problem:

Follow this instruction after installing the registry using EFLC install.reg from EFLC-mbb.rar

If you are using Windows 7. Run regedit. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Rockstar Games/EFLC

Then check the ""InstallFolder"" registry and check if its exactly the same as where you have put your copy of the installed game files.

In my case its a simple mistake of the registry stating install folder is ""C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City"" 

while i put my installation in ""C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episode From Liberty City""

after i launch ""LaunchEFLC.exe"" the razor logo comes up, then it says ""SecuLauncher: failed to launch application [2000]""

You need to take the files out of the ""EFLC-mbb"" folder and put them in the EFLC folder then launch."
,sib0,2011-03-17T01:12Z,when i start......the menu screen appears fine but when i click play.....then nothing happens....ANY HELP ?

,PirateCab,2011-04-18T03:07Z,"Did anybody have the same problem like my in followings?
1.: I've installed the game.
2.: Installed the update 1.1.1.0.
3.: Copied the EFLC install.reg with perfectly correct code.
4.: Installed the GTA IV EFLC Crack Razor-1911.
5.: The game starts. (Rockstar Games logo, Rockstar North logo, et cetera...)
6.: I can choose between TLAD or TBOGT.
7.: I choose one of.
8.: Shows the menu to the game.
9.: I click the start...
Then nothing happens. I mean the screen turns black - like everytime (for a second) when i start a game -, but after that nothing happens, but no error messages too... What can I do? Anybody...? Thanks for the answer!"
,Wilsson002,2011-04-25T17:23Z,Nope...still cant get it working. It is a shitty dl. I've done all the reg shit correctly but still the game crashes every f..... time.
,Wilsson002,2011-04-25T23:35Z,OMG! I did it! I beat the MF! I got it working. This has been my toughest challenge in the history of getting pirategames to work. I dont even know what I did but it is working now. Strangely for some reason I couldnt unpack the rars to my C drive but game started working when I mounted them to outer hard disk drive and made the changes to reg files. Anyways looks even better than the original game. 
,stupidhunt47,2011-06-03T19:03Z,doesn't work for me

,jason5826,2011-07-17T14:06Z,Well can somone tell me if the game works?
,streetbum149,2011-09-19T21:42Z,"ok so after a WHOLE FUCKIN LOT of screwing around in the reg-edit ive finally been able to play. like everyone else said, just look for any type of error in the install-folder string in reg edit. my foul was missing the little (86) after program files for 64-bit systems, so if you have a 64-bit os and have yet to be able to play you may wanna try that. good game so far, but there is this annoying little film grain effect id like to turn off. why do games always ruin themselves with that crap? im not watching a fuckin movie and im not in a theater, i DO NOT want film grain! well, happy gaming guys! if you can play that is. like they say. if at first you don't succeed, throw your pc out the window!"

,lost4815162342,2012-07-13T19:49Z,"PLease help!

I tried hundreds of different ways to get this to work. But whatever i do, when i try starting the game, it always tells me that i am unable to save because i am not logged in to windowslive.

How do i fix this?"
,lost4815162342,2012-07-13T19:52Z,"HOW HOW HOW

do i manage to get this to work that i dont have to sign in to windows live and i can save my game?

Any advice?"
