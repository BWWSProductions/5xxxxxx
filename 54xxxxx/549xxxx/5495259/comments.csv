,DareDevils_Rocks,2010-04-14T09:17Z,i want this fucking game soon not only crack
,krystalvortex,2010-04-14T10:15Z,Where did you get the eflc files from DBNSystem? also when i downloaded this AVG reported a virus.
,DBNSystem,2010-04-14T10:56Z,"Where I got the files from? Some private FTP site which had the Steam version, it got taken down after everyone who needed it got it... but I guess they'll be here sometime soon, just not from me with my sucky upload speed."
,DBNSystem,2010-04-14T10:57Z,"Also, it can not be a virus, nor a fake, I have it working on my system and running that copy of EFLC. If an antivirus detects it as being a virus, it is likely a mistake by the antivirus."
,DBNSystem,2010-04-14T10:59Z,"For some proof, see http://www.imagebam.com/image/83e8f976382624"
,simer007,2010-04-14T11:50Z,"this is fake the game released yesterday razor 1911 not released the crack yet  they r working on it
so guys wait just a bit more it will be there"
,simer007,2010-04-14T11:56Z,wait a min the same thing is written on the other torrent sites too that i dont have speed to upload wa wa i bet that this is fake
,DBNSystem,2010-04-14T12:03Z,"What 'other torrent sites'? They likely just stole my description. Well, since you don't believe me, I'll upload the full game anyway. The 'initial distribution' will take a week, but hey, you asked for it. ;)"
,DBNSystem,2010-04-14T12:26Z,"April 11th? Obvious fake, I haven't even seen it on Usenet yet. I've tried uploading my torrent of the full game to TPB, but it appears to only give '500 Internal Server Error' when posting."
,Switch86,2010-04-14T12:27Z,As far as i know this link from Hyper-Speed is fake..is another game in int. Try the first rar
,Switch86,2010-04-14T12:30Z,it is..in it.. sorry. I just woke up :-/
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-04-14T12:35Z,"I just know I WON'T be downloading nor uploading 16GB AGAIN, How the fuck is that thing so big?
inb4thatswhatshesaid"
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-04-14T12:37Z,"The download had to be 2GB not fucking 16, what the hell is up with that?"
,thecakeisnolie,2010-04-14T12:40Z,"The point is this is everything, we don't know which files are duplicate from IV. And I can tell ya it's working, you need all files, a .bin file that probably will be uploaded soon, and the registry fix.

So, whoever says it's fake, is fake. The crack, however, is not.

Enjoy playing!"
,thecakeisnolie,2010-04-14T14:01Z,"Some stupid 500-files-limit and white pages stopped the entire game from being uploaded to TPB, but here you go. http://www.kickasstorrents.com//grand-theft-auto-episodes-from-liberty-city-full-steamrip-crack-t3966213.html"
,ivan0519,2010-04-14T15:45Z,anyone know where can i download the DLC only?
,thecakeisnolie,2010-04-14T15:46Z,"The DLC only, without crack? Why would you need that?

Anyhow, the torrent I posted in the message above yours provides the entire EFLC with crack, but you can remove the cracked files if you want. The backup file is still there."
,ivan0519,2010-04-14T16:01Z,"@thecakeisnolie

i already have the game(GTA4) and the two DLCs are about 3.5GB each. its a waste if i dl the whole 16GB standalone"
,DBNSystem,2010-04-14T16:04Z,"@ivan0519: I don't think the separate DLCs would be usable without having them authorized by Live. Live's hard to crack, youknow? :p"
,UltimateGTR,2010-04-14T16:49Z,I hope it works.
,EXiR0N,2010-04-14T16:58Z,"FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE

DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! 
DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!

FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE

How the fuck can a crack come before the game? omg so fake... you need to understand that people... omg"
,RanY2jith,2010-04-14T17:08Z,"Just upload the EFLC 7GB iso someone 

@ THE4X

and 16 gb ? Dumbass its only 7gb with the two episodes

i think even GTA IV's only 14.5 gb when installed 

16 gb is really something too much for just  stand alone disc means it has to be over sized you dumbass ?

,Zonzzu,2010-04-15T16:53Z,The game crashes for me too after the R* North logo... I did the regedit fix. 
,DBNSystem,2010-04-15T17:53Z,"If it crashes after the R*N logo, either the InstallFolder is incorrect, or you're using 64-bit Windows and should put it in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Rockstar Games\EFLC."
,bob_geldof,2010-04-16T10:54Z,NOT a single crack first off whole bunch of files...and when copied over does bugger all game still needs activating. 
,Genewitch,2010-04-20T03:53Z,Works fine with clonedvd.
,Wondex,2010-05-08T20:05Z,"Works like a charm, this crack does not need online or offline activation, the reloaded release needs te activation before you can play it...

OS : Win 7 x64 ultimate > Result : Working Fine"

,TheXGuys,2010-07-04T14:38Z,wtf? it's not so got damn it hard !
,Archadeus,2010-08-21T21:15Z,"Omg you fucking retards never read the god damn read me... Here dumbasses This crack is a modified version of the old Razor1911 crack for GTA IV (1.0.4.0). It still mostly works for EFLC.

Note that, if not having installed EFLC with the 'official' installer, you will need to add the registry key
HKLM\Software\Rockstar Games\EFLC with a string value InstallFolder pointing to the installed folder.
Without this registry setting, EFLC will crash after the Rockstar North logo.

,sillytoad,2012-05-03T01:17Z,did not work for me it just crashes after the RAZOR logo
