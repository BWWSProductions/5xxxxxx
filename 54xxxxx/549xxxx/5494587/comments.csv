""Just out of curiosity, @Tamarind777, why did this omniscient 'God' of yours gime me (a man) nipples? Is He just weird or what?"" 

I have spoken with literally hundreds of atheists and I know exactly where you're going with your argument. You're saying that since YOU don't know the purpose for your nipples, and it seem that they don't have any use to you (or anyone else, I hope!), therefore on the basis that a Perfect God would not make a ""mistake"" He does not exist. What logic. On that same level of argument, we have no clue at all why the pyramids in Egypt were built or what purpose they serve, if any. According to your logic, the pyramids don't exist either (since those who built it cannot exist, to go along with your faulty logic).

If you read the Bible, it says that the woman was taken from man, thus, it only makes sense that they must share a great deal in common, which would include many anatomical features.. In fact, all a penis is is an extended clitoris if you think about it. Pretty much the same structure, with some modification. Maybe we don't know what nipples on a man does, but that doesn't man they don't serve some function. It's simply that we don't have all knowledge all at once. Knowledge is progressive, live and learn. Also, there are some things we just never will understand right now, and I know it, but I don't fuss about it. I have seen too many evidences in life to strengthen my faith in God.

Now, what about your religion? You have absolutely NO evidence whatsoever about your religion, evolution, but your believe it simply by faith. It is a religion, because it has nothing to do with science. It doesn't even fit into the definition of what science is. Check out the definition and see. You completely believe it on faith the same way I take the evidence I have and apply it to God. I do have plenty of evidence, but ultimately, it rests on faith. I am honest to admit that, but you never will."
,Tamarind777,2010-04-21T06:34Z,"I don't know who is a bigger joke, Hitchens or DUH-kins. They are perhaps two of the biggest imbeciles on this planet. They have absolutely zero logical reasoning skills, and the most hubris of anyone out there. But, that's what a life without God will inevitably lead to. I am willing to bet anything that they both question evolution and perhaps even think it's just silliness that simply is illogical and senseless, but they would never admit to it. You see, they've both built their soon-to-crumble empires on atheism, so they have to keep going with that nonsense in order to get the next check. Who's the bigger fools? Those who get their religion from them. They don't believe and refuse to do so because they get paid to be atheists, but you follow along simply by being obedient students of theirs. If they eventually come to their senses and admit that there is a God, would you also do the same? They could be saved, but you, his followers are in even greater danger. They're safeguarding their coffers, but you're just foolish."

Theres so much ignorance and stupidity in your posts that I dont really know where to begin.

1st of all, atheism is not a religion. Is bold a haircolour?

2nd You claim evolition is a religion, do you know the definition of religion? Let me help you: ""Religion is the belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship"" Evolition has no God, period.

People that claim theres no proof of evolution, sorry your just dumb. What about fossils? What about DNA? They both back evolution as a theory. All the major scientists in the world back up evolution as the main theory of how we all came into existence, even the religious ones (95% of scientists are atheists/agnostics btw)

You claim you have many evidence of the existence of ""God"". I'd really like to see them, as it would mean you have made a breakthrough in humankind.

3rd I just lol'ed at your comments about Dawkins and Hitchens. Calling them imbeciles when they both are one of the brightest persons on they're field in this generation. Why are the imbeciles? Because they dont agree with your narrow point of view? Everyone who disagrees with you are paid off? Is that really what you think?

Your an atheist yourself, you dont belive in Buddha, Mohammad, Thor, Zeuvs. Atheists just take it one ""God"" further.

Yeah right. This is the religious mindset:
""If the bible had said that Jonah swallowed the whale, I would believe it.""
-William Jennings Bryan
It's in an old book, so it must be true. Second, when it comes to hubris... how can ANYONE EVER have a chance against anyone who believe they are a) made in gods image b) god has a special plan for you c) heaven watches you 24/7?     This deity cannot even convince most of the people in the world that he exists, and what one believes in usually depends on the parents and society. What kind of incompetent distribution of of correct faith is this?

You do know we have a good understanding of how the Pyramids and why they were built, correct? Now, everyone else called you out about your other ignorant statements, I figured I would correct you on this one. The pyramids were assumed to be built using a system combining massive amounts of slave man power as well as levies, rollers, and ropes to move the blocks. The pyramids were used to provide the nobility of ancient Egypt an eternal resting place as well as provide a stairway to the heavens. We know this because of the technology available at the time, archaeological records, ancient Egyptian written records and paintings, and for the fact that we have found the fucking bodies of the buried. Of course, as it seems, nothing logical and real is enough to convince you seeing the standpoint you have against evolution; so, it is a waste of time talking to you. Though, if I may point out, you're perfectly happy pursuing the idea of a god that is literally baseless in fact supporting his existence. Don't worry: atheism is the fastest growing belief in the world, and sooner or later your kind will be weeded out of our society. So, have fun sucking Jesus dick for the next however long you live, because when you die you'll be FUCKING DEAD."
