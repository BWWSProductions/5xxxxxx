From the author hailed as â€œone of the most brilliant journalists of our timeâ€



comes a book that redefines the debate about religion in public life. With his unique brand of erudition and wit, Christopher Hitchens addresses the most urgent issue of our time: the malignant force of religion in the world.



In this eloquent argument with the faithful, Hitchens makes the ultimate case against religion (and for a more secular approach to life) through a close and learned reading of the major religious texts, citing numerous historical instances in which sexual repression and outrageous acts of violence have been committed in the name of God.



Hitchens tells the personal story of his own dangerous encounters with religion and describes his intellectual journey toward a secular view of life based on science and reason, in which the heavens are replaced by the Hubble telescopeâ€™s awesome view of the universe, and Moses and the burning bush give way to the beauty and symmetry of the double helix. â€œGod did not make us,â€ he writes. â€œWe made God.â€ Religion, he explains, is a distortion of our origins, our nature, and the cosmos. We damage our children â€“ and endanger our world â€“ by indoctrinating them.



Whether lifelong believer, devout atheist, or someone who remains uncertain about the role of religion in our lives, you will want to consider and engage in the arguments within this audiobook, and you will not soon forget Hitchensâ€™s foreboding refrain: Religion Poisons Everything.
