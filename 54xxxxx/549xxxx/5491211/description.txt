Whilst students at Blackpool Art College in 1981, Dave, Craig & myself (Mick), quickly discovered our shared interest in music and old English pubs. Our second visit to the Sunset Sound Studio in 1983 produced The Cabinet. We each have a fascination for â€˜The Cabinet of Doctor Caligariâ€™ with its twisted tale of madness and unforgettable imagery and this was the theme we borrowed for our demo. We pressed 500 vinyl singles, touted The Cabinet to club & radio DJs and sent copies to largely unreceptive A&R departments, yet found a friend in BBC Radio 1â€™s Janice Long who aired it on several occasions. Over the intervening years, its popularity has mysteriously migrated around Europe in a way that none of us could have suspected. 

A primitive self-produced college video of The Cabinet can be found HERE. 

[ A chap calling himself MattMorbid has edited together scenes from the movie to produce an alternative video for The Cabinet - Nicely done, Mr. Morbid. This can be found HERE ]. 

On leaving college, we continued our sporadic recording sessions at Cavalier Studios, near Manchester, until a completed album emerged in 1986. This did not see a release until 2008 when some of the songs appeared as the Spy Thriller album on Minimal Wave records. 

Gradually, we felt our music drifting away from the Das Kabinette identity, becoming DANGEROUS GROUND from 1987 to 1991. 

Mick and Dave each have solo projects [UTRONIC & THE TEST CHAMBER] and continue to record together as MUTANT SUITS as well as writing new DAS KABINETTE material for a project with original member, Craig.
