Kaiji Ito moves to Japan after graduating from high school. Unable to find a
job and frustrated with society at large, Kaiji spends his days gambling,
vandalizing cars, and drinking booze.
Two years later and his life no better, a debt collector named Endo arrives
to collect money. The debt collector then offers two choices to Kaiji: spend
10 year paying off your loan or board a gambling boat for one night to repay
your debt & possibly make a whole lot more. Meanwhile, the unscrupulous Endo
is actually conning Kaiji, believing he won't come back from voyage. Kaiji
is then up for the night of his life.
