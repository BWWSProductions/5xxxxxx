A fairy tale character who is about to flunk out of fairy Ãž
Ã tale school, Jack must perform a heroic deed by Monday or Ãž
Ã fail miserably, just like his father before him. Anxious Ãž
Ã to make good, Jack sells his C.O.W. (Computer of Wonder) Ãž
Ã for a handful of magic beans and a mysterious book that Ãž
Ã records his adventures as he's having them. Accompanied Ãž
Ã by his sidekick Grayson -- a goose who ate a bean and Ãž
Ã underwent an amazing transformation -- Jack climbs the Ãž
Ã magic beanstalk to recover the fabled Harp of Destiny Ãž
Ã from the evil Giant who lives in the sky. Helping Jack on Ãž
Ã his perilous quest is the spunky Jillian, a fearless Ãž
Ã young girl whom Jack meets on his journey -- and who just Ãž
Ã may have a hidden agenda...
