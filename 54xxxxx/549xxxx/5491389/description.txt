American Radical : The Trials Of Norman Finkelstein - AVI - GCJM

==============================================================

Synopsis:

"American Radical" is the probing, definitive documentary about American academic Norman Finkelstein. A devoted son of holocaust survivors, ardent critic of Israel and US Mid-East policy, and author of five provocative books including, "The Holocaust Industry", Finkelstein has been steadfast at the centre of many intractible controversies, including his recent denial of tenure at DePaul University. Called a lunatic and self-hating Jew by some, and an inspirational street-fighting revolutionary by others, Finkelstein is a deeply polrizing figure whose struggles arise from core questions about freedom, identity and nationhood.

From Beirut to Kyoto, the filmmakers follow Finkelstein around the world as he attempts to negotiate a voice among both supporters and critics, providing an intimate portrait of the man behind the controversy while giving equal time to both his critics and supporters.
