It's just amazing that you can make the file sizes so small! (An extra added bonus is that they're also easier to store..) Thanks so much for everything you do to make it easier on those of us with low bandwidth and slow connections.. I, and many others, really appreciate it.

And it doesn't hurt that you have great taste in television ;-)"
