[S],velvet.,2010-04-13T03:02Z,"Why did you create this torrent using 1109 - 4 MB blocks?
The data would replicate much better if you instead had used 8872 - 512 KB blocks.
That would have made it easier for you to seed, and for me to download.

The smaller the block size, the more effectively the data in a torrent swarm will replicate."
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-13T03:40Z,That is how DVD Decrypter gave it to me. I'm very new to uploading is there a way I can change how they come out like that?
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-13T04:06Z,To be perfectly honest I have no idea what you mean by these blocks.
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-14T22:38Z,Thanks for clearing that up Agentbay:) Also I really appreciate the kind words. I hope you enjoy this movie:)
[T],ctang,2010-04-15T05:27Z,"on my latest torrent ""For Richer Or Poorer"", i decided to change the default piece size to 512kb instead of the usual 4mb and like ""velvet"" said, it is uploading much more efficiently...usually i have to upload 1.5x before the files are 100% uploaded so i am glad that i have changed that setting...thanks velvet and also agentbay!!"
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-15T06:05Z,Hey Ctang how do you change the sizes. I would also like to do this to make my torrents easier for download but am unsure of how to do this.
[T],ctang,2010-04-16T18:47Z,@Agentbay: Im currently uploading my second torrent with piece sizes of 512kb and have uploaded nearly 75% of a torrent in 12hrs...this was taking me around 30-40hrs before with 4mb piece sizes so i am a firm believer now
[T],mikemelo1369,2010-04-16T22:24Z,Yup Yo Velvet thank you for the AMAZING suggestion:) And Agent thank you for explaining how to do this. I uploaded my new torrent Rookie of The Year in 6 hours fully uploaded. I am going to be putting up For The Love Of The Game with 512KB Blocks.
