,vanleeuwenhoek,2010-04-14T19:38Z,"I'm reminded of the scene from ""Good Will Hunting"" where Matt Damon's character shows up the Harvard student and argues that you can get the same education and only incur a few bucks in late fees at the public library. That scene is an unrealistic view of both intelligence and the wealth of learning that can be gained, unguided, for free."
