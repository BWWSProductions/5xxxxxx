---------------------------------------------

Argila (Clay) (1940), a romantic drama set in the countryside that stars Carmen Santos as a sophisticated woman whose interest in the art of ceramics grows into a passion for the artist. A conventional story but one around which Humberto Mauro (the strongest personality of the Brazilian cinema from 1920-40) creates his own special style: a refined visual sense of atmosphere and the countryside.


Summary from IMDB:

In Rio de Janeiro, Gilberto (Celso GuimarÃ£es) is a talented artisan engaged of Marina (LÃ­dia Mattos), working in a pottery factory. He is hired by the millionaire widow Luciana (Carmem Santos) to perform a restoration in her castle in Correas, a district of PetrÃ³polis. He suffers an accident and Luciana lodges and treats him for a long period, and they fall in love for each other. The moral values of the Brazilian society of the 40's make this love impossible for them. "Argila" is a beautiful and sensitive romance. The direction of Humberto Mauro is excellent, but the story is very dated for the present days. It is very interesting to see the behavior of the society sixty-five years ago, and very worthwhile watching this very rare movie, which is difficult to be found in Brazil. My vote is seven.
