,.DaZa.,2010-07-02T14:05Z,"Currently downloading this file... Hadn't realized my boys finished the patch... hopefully this is worth the wait, and worth the man hours put into creating it.

All I have to say is Front Mission is one of my favorite series of games and this laptop better be capable of running PS2 games, even if it's only this one or FM4.

After all is downloaded and tested, I will begin uploading my rare PSX RGP's [over 30] along with a small but good compilation of PS2 games.

Cheers, and thanks! -DaZa"
,gamesearcher,2010-07-03T19:15Z,hey there ......Big_dude i appreciate all your efforts to bring us all these amazing uploads of yours...but for this one i think you disrespected the desire of the guys responsible of this decent translation project of NOT seeing it circulating through torrents...which reminds me that they took notice of that by posting an important note on their web site.........and apart from that keep up the good work buddy
,gerent,2011-05-07T12:29Z,Fantastic! You're awesome for providing this.
,bilot,2011-07-28T10:48Z,"thanks for this one, Big_dude! Works great on OPLv0.9"
,Kamianbu,2011-09-25T10:35Z,"Can't wait to try this out...

I hope it's better than Front Mission Evolved, that sort of made me depressed compared to previous FM games.
But this 'was' made before Evolved so it should be better."
