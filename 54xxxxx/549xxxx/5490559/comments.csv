,rugburn11,2010-04-11T17:06Z,"After 2 weeks of not being able to play AC2 ....this one works 100% ...I'm playing...I'm playing

WOW thank you, thank you"
,IdiotStorm3,2010-04-11T20:07Z,"Still getting ""an internet connection is required"" message"
,rugburn11,2010-04-12T03:38Z,"Completely works 100%...THANK YOU

After unsuccessful attempts for the last 2 weeks this one works...WOW

This is how i did it...completely uninstall the last Assassin's Creed 2
Start/Control Panel/add or remove Programs/find Assassin's Creed II and remove.

Go to... start/my computer/local Disk (C:)/ Windows/System32/Drivers/etc/hosts (right click and open it with Notepad) make sure that you do not have any of these files here ...

127.0.0.1       static3.cdn.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       ubisoft-orbit.s3.amazonaws.com
127.0.0.1       onlineconfigservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       orbitservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1       ubisoft-orbit savegames.s3.amazonaws.com

if you do, delete them and then close notepad. When it ask, do you want to save notepad click yes...

now restart your computer and then install Assassin's Creed II....this is called a clean install.

now go to assassin's Creed 2 rar and unpack....inside you will find a readme now just follow the Step by Step instructions and you will be playing in no time...enjoy

ps: make certain you use the Ubisoft Game Launcher  in this file...this is the Key to getting to play the Game"

,vdao1972,2010-04-12T07:46Z,"I can't seem to get this to work. I am getting a 
""Missing command line parameter -prodid, see integration guide for details"" error.

I thought I had followed the instructions correctly so if anyone has any ideas why it isn't working, it would be appreciated. 

BTW, I am running Windows 7 64X.

Thanks!"
,dkozma,2010-04-12T12:17Z,"I'm geeting the same message ""Missing command line parameter -prodid, see integration guide for details"" error.
i'm using windows XP
Anyone, what is the problem???"
,Axnor,2010-04-12T21:53Z,same problem with -prodid
,jmv84,2010-04-14T08:26Z,"With the -prodid error, make sure that you copy the .117 Ubisoft Launcher files over as directed.

The one-click installer here sort of works, but will also infect your computer with Malware.Trace. This malware isn't easy to detect or to remove (you may see processes like Wvojeb or Wdq in your task manager, or have uUu.uUu or xXx.xXx files that you can't seem to delete).

It's much safer to just download the server software from the cs.rin.ru forum, and set it up yourself."
,Backdra11,2010-04-14T20:44Z,"@ jmv84

I did that, deleted the old ""Ubisoft Game Launcher"" folder and put the one from this file into it, still gave me -prodid error.

The only thing I can think of is that I installed the game and Ubisoft Game Launcher on seperate HD."
,dont_ask,2010-04-14T20:51Z,Does this actually have malware?
,jmv84,2010-04-15T12:10Z,"Backdra: Once again, I recommend just downloading the server from the original developer's forum post... I had the same problem as you after copying over the files from this download, but when I copied the ones that were included in the authentic file, it worked fine."
,jmv84,2010-04-16T03:00Z,"If you're having trouble with the save games ""not synchronizing,"" just click on the gear icon in the launcher and select ""yes."" Then it won't bother with trying to synchronize the saves to the server anymore."
,llvv,2010-04-19T03:28Z,"It works, but I ran into a glitch or something where I can't do anymore quests or sub quests. I would go to the quest marker and talk to the person then it shows that it saves, and then the screen will go back to me standing by the person and nothing happens. I tried quitting out and going back in and I also tried quitting the quest but nothing works. Anyone know why this happens?"
,llvv,2010-04-20T02:46Z,"Nevermind my last post, I found out how to fix it."
,feeva_1,2010-04-24T05:51Z,"Works fine for me, with the exception that it doesnt save, it doesnt even create the storage folder i need. any suggestions?"
,jmv84,2010-04-24T23:31Z,"@rick_walker: play the first mission and then quit the game, and overwrite the smallest savefiles with the DLC savefiles. Then you'll have the DLC."
,XONE65,2010-04-25T05:01Z,NEED HELP PLZ !!! am playing the game but i have a problem : in the meeting Templar i have no meeting to listen to !!! when i open the door nothing happens !!! PLZ am dieing  here !!!   PS :  i tried  every thing reload replay .....  
,llvv,2010-04-26T21:01Z,"@XONE65 
That was the same problem I had, I don't really know what the problem is but all I did was restart the computer and closed down everything that uses the internet like utorrent and it seems to work fine. After playing for awhile though it happens again so I just do the same thing. "
