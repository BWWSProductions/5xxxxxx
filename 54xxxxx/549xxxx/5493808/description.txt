Goth's first and only supergroup? or do you need at least 3 people from different bands to call it that? Fucked if I know. Anne-Marie from Skeletal Family and Gary Marx from The Sisters of Mercy, plus a guy called Etch (I original thought that might have been Andrew Eldritch, but no) and a drum machine called Pandora. Not a complete collection. Converted with 'Spin it again' software. OBie
