Cypress Hill's new album "Rise Up" in FLAC.  To get this to play on your ipod or whatever, you can convert it to wav with very little loss through winamp, and then open with itunes (which can convert to a number of different formats if you want).  Anyway, albums is hella dope, so yeah, have fun. Uploaded from demonoid.
