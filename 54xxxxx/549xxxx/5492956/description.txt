This is the only place where I will give support for this from now.


This is a VMware image of Mac OS X 10.6.2 (The version you need for the latest iPhone SDK beta)

You can use this image with either with VMware Workstation or with the free VMware Player. The whole package has been compressed using 7zip (otherwise you would have to download >20gigs), 7zip portable is included in this torrent.

To boot, you can either point the virtual CD drive at bootloader.iso, or you can load a saved snapshot of the booted machine (useful for users having booting issues)

It will only work on machines with Intel processors with hardware virtualization:

Intended for xSellize only, but as soon as I uploaded the torrent (had not even published it on xSellize) there were ~20 leechers. So here is the password: "xsellize". When logged into Mac OS X, username and password are both "hobbypunk".
