'Atlantic Bridge', the first solo album from Davy Spillane took on a totally
 new musical direction with Davy being accompanied by not only the cream of 
Irish musicians, (i.e. fellow members of Moving Hearts) but also by the 
legendary guitar player 
Albert Lee, bluegrass and country music stars 
Jerry Douglas on Dobro, and 
Bela Fleck on Banjo 

'Atlantic Bridge' fulfilled Davy's dreams of combining the best of Irish and 
American traditions, enriching and complementing both without compromising either.
This is compelling music, 
and as producer P.J. Curtis says in his notes "Listen and enjoy".
