English comedienne, was a pop star for a brief spell in the early 80â€™s before resuming her focus on acting. She had six singles in the British Top 100 in a 19 month span from March 1983 -October 1984. Melody Maker once described her retro 60â€™s style sound as somewhere between â€œMinnie Mouse and the Supremesâ€.

In 1982 while starring on the BBC tv program â€œThree of A Kindâ€, Ullman was persuaded to record an album â€œYou Broke My Heart in 17 Placesâ€ for Stiff Records, which quickly became a #14 pop chart album hit in the U.K, featuring three top ten singles.

In 1984, a follow up album, entitled â€œYou Caught Me Outâ€ was released. Other than a Kirsty MacColl co-produced cut, it was produced by Peter Colins, as was her debut. 

Despite her success in the music biz, Ullman, a talented actress, singer, dancer, screenwriter, and author, is most famous for being the host of her eponymous variety television shows. Ullman has an extraordinary ability to mimic accents, with her numerous characters rarely sounding anything like her normal accent.

Her professional entertainment career began at age 17 as a ballet dancer in Germany, and eventually she appeared in London stage productions of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Grease etc. By 1980 she won the London Theater Critics Award and gained a foothold in television.
