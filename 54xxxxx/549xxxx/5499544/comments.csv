,tanaas,2010-04-16T22:44Z,Haven't ever tried a monster hunter game before but Shigeru Miyamoto said he wanted new Zelda to look as good as this game so am curious now
,mjsk,2010-04-16T22:51Z,Sexy. I have been waiting. Thanks wii sauce.

,elma1337,2010-04-17T01:14Z,"tnx for the fast up Markuf!

Tested on 4.1u
~ from disk waninkoko cIOS57 rev19 and darkcorp 1.0
~ from usb hermes cIOS222 v4 WiiFlow

*DOES NOT LOAD FROM USB WITH cIOS249*

Just a little info from another site for peepz to get it working ;)"
,Slider2k,2010-04-17T04:03Z,The big question is: Can you play this copy online on a modded Wii?
,Stlouiscowboys,2010-04-17T04:11Z,"I have never had a burned wii game that has worked offline and didn't work online.  If this works, it should be playable online 100%.  "
,tanaas,2010-04-17T04:53Z,I have 4.2u softmod with cios rev 19 and newest neogamma cannot get this to run it makes it to menu when i start it freezez with high pitch sound
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-04-17T05:40Z,USB loader (external HDD) won't work? What about with the actual legit retail version?
,fluggy2003,2010-04-17T11:56Z,Very dubious. Why is it not called Monster Hunter Tri . . .the western title? Why is it here before any other torrent site? Maybe it aint working coz its a fake??? 
,Stlouiscowboys,2010-04-17T12:17Z,"@fluggy  STFU if you don't know what you are talking about.  Markuf is a good uploader and this torrent is legit.  

A lot of people are having problems getting the game going however.  When you get into the game, as soon as you press start game, the game freezes with a high pitched sound.  A fix was found for USB loaders, where you just need to use hermies v4 ios 223 with 37 merged with 38.  (If you don't know what that means look it up, as I am not great with it either)  

For DVD users, what I had to do is download darkcorp 1.0.  This is a complete hack tool that lets you use your disc channel to play games.  After you install that, you need to install startpatch, and install the patch from that that removes all online updates.  Then you just run the game and no more freeze!.  Hope this helps as the majority of people were having this problem.

Thanks for the quality upload Markuf!"
,fluggy2003,2010-04-17T13:39Z,I stand corrected. I apologise to Markuf for my earlier comment. 
,elma1337,2010-04-17T16:39Z,"@ slider2k: yes you can play online, but servers are not up until April 19 ..."
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-04-18T01:17Z,"""A fix was found for USB loaders, where you just need to use hermies v4 ios 223 with 37 merged with 38.""

,fluggy2003,2010-04-18T03:36Z,Works fine with uloader. On uloader select Monster Hunter n opt to load game with ios223. Loads fine without high pitch noise n crashing! . .  .which i did experience too b4 choosing ios223. Thanx for tip guys. Hope it works for you lot too. 
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-04-18T04:35Z,"Thanks Stlouiscowboys and Elma. I actually wasn't using 233, when I thought I had it installed, but didn't know I needed to actually select it. Game works now with USB loader."
,Neuro_Belmont,2010-04-18T04:38Z,"Sorry, I meant 223 with 38 and 37."
,bobde2e,2010-04-18T16:06Z,Does anyone know if this game works online in Europe? Cuz this is the american NTSC version.. Or is there no difference :p
,Slider2k,2010-04-18T17:31Z,"@bobde2e
I think it would connect only to US servers."
,SpitvenoM,2010-04-19T02:56Z,I'm pretty sure i have downloaded a different region wii game and played online before it was a while ago though so i may be wrong.
,Reece71079,2010-04-19T10:19Z,Worked perfect on mine and through disc channel. Wiikey 1 4.2e no patches needed. Not impressed with game though to much talking and running around doing nothink.
,hiddendragon,2010-04-20T00:01Z,"worked fine for me too,no patching or extra cios,loaded through disc channel.
Cheers!"
,rhys_dvduk2001,2010-04-20T07:16Z,"top upload many thatnks to the people who did this.

,rhys_dvduk2001,2010-04-20T07:22Z,this should not have any problems playing online its games like guitat hero and rockband that dont play properly on line if use on a diffrent region systen like nstc game on pal wii as they use the wii shop. if this game does not use the wii shop you are ok to play it online
