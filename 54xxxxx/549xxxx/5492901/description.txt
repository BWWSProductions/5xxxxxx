Osho - Fluctuation Meditation - Come, Come, Yet Again Come

Osho Fluctuation Meditations contain the best available audio quality
Osho discourses accompanied with a background music by Osho
musicians and the best of ethnic music played by the most
outstanding musicians.

Usually, when you just listen to the discourse by itself,
your mind tends to wonder away on all sorts of mind trips
and you are not even aware when it does it. All you recognize is when
it came back to the source and become aware of the discourse again.

With Fluctuation meditation, the background music is specifically
selected to be beautiful and conductive to meditative state.
You will be taken through different spaces, world traditions,
and musical styles from ancient to modern. The best of the best.

The chance of you staying with the discourse is much higher.
If your mind wonders away from the discourse,
if becomes occupied with the beauty of music,
and so it becomes much easier to become aware
of how your mind wonders away from the present moment.

Just lay back, close your eyes and enjoy this space of silence.
There is nothing to do.
Everything is in a perfect shape, as perfect as it gets.
