At the ending 60s Nucleus emerged from the British jazz scene and shortly afterwards were considered as the main representatives of British Jazz Rock/Fusion.
As Nucleus turned from jazz to jazz rock, Soft Machine went v.v.: from progressive rock to jazz rock. That was no sheer coincidence, because actually not less than about 10 musicians, involved in the playground of Nucleus, joined the later Soft Machine. The only constant member (the nucleus, ha ha!) in the band's history was founder Ian Carr who played trumpet and flugelhorn.


These are the first three and most important albums of Nucleus, with a constant line-up lasting until "Solarplexus" in 1971.

Much to our regret Ian Carr, as a leading figure in the British jazz world died on February 25, 2009 at the age of 75.
