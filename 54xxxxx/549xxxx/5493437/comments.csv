,lailabagge,2010-04-13T09:03Z,"Do you realize how stupid you seem as to prefer a rar-packed torrent?!
Why people persist on slicing their files up in a thousand is a mystery to me, it doesn't do anything."

,Ezel,2010-04-18T13:33Z,"@FK-Ramone: lailabagge is right. There is hardly any need for RAR:ed content when doing torrents. Torrents has inbuilt error-correction so the need to ""just download 1 faulty RAR"" isn't there anymore. The only reason would be if one are to send it further down the line via FTP or something like that. But it's not like you can get a torrent from TPB and then upload it to a scene-site anyway since it will be way to late unless it's a really really lame FTP. "
