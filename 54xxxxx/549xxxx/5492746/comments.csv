Don't get me wrong the quality is fine but its not 320 as the title says."
[V],godcanjudgeme,2011-11-08T14:01Z,"@66677 - you just blew my mind O.o

You are absolutely correct.

I sincerely apologise for the mistaken labelling.
I don't know why that happened but I can assure you it was not intentional.

Please do enjoy the tunes."
