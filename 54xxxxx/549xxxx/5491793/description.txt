Naturally Good Magazine is a revolutionary new magazine which covers health-related topics, ranging from pharmaceutical-induced school shootings to the treatments for strep throat.  We cover the articles that other health magazines are afraid to.  We do not use anonymous sources, and we stake our names and reputations to our words, and never hesitate to sign our names.  We offer old-fashioned investigative journalism that was lost amid a new trend of misinformation, pandering to corporate agendas, and deceit.  All of our pages include well-researched material, because our credibility, and your trust are important to us.

We teach our readers about good nutrition, maintaining their own health, preventing and curing disease, detoxing, and cooking naturally; all with God's medicines.  Most retailers refuse to carry Naturally Good Magazine, because it is not merely an advertisement delivery system, but it covers real content that can save lives, and it threatens an entire industry which keeps people sick for profit.
