plot:
Juana is married off by her pious parents, the Catholic kings Ferndinand
of Aragon and Isabella of Castille, to ally Spain, united by their marriage,
to the Burgundian and other Habsburg heritage of archduke Maximilian's son 
Philip. When they meet, it's love at first sight, for her all-consuming, for
him one of many happy bed partnerships as she later discovers. Deaths in her
family soon make Juana Isabella's heir, but Ferdinand suggests she inherited
her grandmother's madness and supports Philip's ambition to rule instead, which
becomes the stakes of political maneuvering in the Cortes (nobility-dominated
parliament). Combined with Philip's incurable infidelity, which includes a
Moorish whore-princess, multiple drama is inevitable, and worse follows.
