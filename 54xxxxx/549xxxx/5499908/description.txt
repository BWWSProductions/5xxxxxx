With Howard Zinn and others is going a generation that saw the days of fascism and the rise of corporatism. I hope our generation take from this raw individuals as much wisdom as they can. I cant find words to explain the lost of Howard for the world but I think he also left us soo much, that we can look with hope in the future, as howard did it always and would have expected from us.
