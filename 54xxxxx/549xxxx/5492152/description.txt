Dj Screw and the Screwed Up Click Presents: June 27 Limited Edition


Houston-based Dirty South DJ, best known for his eponymous "Chopped and Screwed" mixtapes, where he would slow down records to half their normal speed in order to complement the effect of being really high on lean -- codeine cough syrup mixed with soda. In the late 1990s, DJ Screw made hundreds of mixtapes using this technique, selling them out of the trunk of his car until demand grew so large that he opened a shop. He gained a loyal following in his hometown and abroad, only to die of a heart attack (reportedly his fifth) after overdosing on his muse at his studio.



Description:
If you only own one DJ Screw CD, this should be the one, a classic of the chopped & screwed remix. Track two on disc one, "We Got The Hook Up," is one of the best examples of chopping, Disc two and three feature freestyles over excellent original rhythm tracks and last for most of each disc. This is a must-buy for the curious, as well as the longtime DJ Screw fan.
