Peter was first known as co-founder of KCRW / AAA radio darlings and commercially successful duo Eastmountainsouth, signed by Robbie Robertson to Dreamworks Records. Now with Sarathan Records, Peter has garnered critical acclaim as a solo artist: â€œEverything about this recording, from Adamsâ€™s hushed croon to the atmospheric weave of acoustic and electric instrumentsâ€¦ sustain the intimate and sometimes haunting mood that allows this CD to quietly stand outâ€ (Washington Post).
