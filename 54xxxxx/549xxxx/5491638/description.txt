PLOT
An elderly writer visits the small coastal village where he was born and raised. He reminisces of his childhood and a beautiful, mysterious woman he has been unable to forget. As he walks through his old village he catches a glimpse of the same woman he fell in love with in his youth. However, she has not aged since the day he saw her. He follows her but is not ready for what he finds.
