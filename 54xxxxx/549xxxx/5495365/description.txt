By day, he is mild-mannered pizza delivery boy, Eddie Edison.  By night, he is also mild-mannered Eddie Edison... who just happens to be the alter ego of the Hyper-Human's teenaged sidekick, Hyper-Lad.  But the pay sucks. So Eddie settles upon an unlikely solution: he becomes a paid sidekick to three other superheroes, but soon finds out how hard it is to juggle the schedules of four super-powered morons.
