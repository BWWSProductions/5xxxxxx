After unsuccessful attempts for the last 2 weeks this one works...WOW

This is how i did it...completely uninstall the last Assassin's Creed 2
Start/Control Panel/add or remove Programs/find Assassin's Creed II and remove.

Go to... start/my computer/local Disk (C:)/ Windows/System32/Drivers/etc/hosts (right click and open it with Notepad) make sure that you do not have any of these files here ...

127.0.0.1 static3.cdn.ubi.com
127.0.0.1 ubisoft-orbit.s3.amazonaws.com
127.0.0.1 onlineconfigservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1 orbitservice.ubi.com
127.0.0.1 ubisoft-orbit savegames.s3.amazonaws.com

if you do, delete them and then close notepad. When it ask, do you want to save notepad click yes...

now restart your computer and then install Assassin's Creed II....this is called a clean install.

now go to assassin's Creed 2 rar and unpack....inside you will find a readme now just follow the Step by Step instructions and you will be playing in no time...enjoy

ps: make certain you use the Ubisoft Game Launcher in this file...this is the Key to getting to play the Game "

I have installed the game in this order:

1) installed game (Assassins_Creed_2_[Multi9]_[PCDVD9][WITH_CRACK]) with no internet connection.

2) installed the patch (assassins_creed_2_1.01_us)

3) installed the crack (AC2ServEmu0.44-One-Click-Install.v1.0.1.0)

4) installed the new values (1900_values (final) by 3xistence)

5)Edited the hosts then flushed the DNS.

6) replaced the files in the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder with the cracked version.

,bjede,2011-01-20T23:28Z,"Hi
I downloaded AC2 a few just days ago...
and I have one question: what is this values.db file for? If I understand correctly it unlocks primary and secondary missions in game?
I found latest version (1910). What would happen if I apply it after installation? Will it open all game content immediately or it will be opened progressively, as I get on through the game?

Thanks! "

,arutha64,2011-04-13T08:18Z,"This doesn't work for me... I have followed the instructions properly, get the shortcut on the desktop, shut down skype etc., start via the shortcut and it brings up the server window. In server log it says 'Server is running"" ""Game is not running"" at the bottom, the log itself just lists all the ports as active. When I go to start game, nothing happens it just takes me back to the log window.

Any ideas?"
,elturbo9077,2011-04-14T20:29Z,"@arutha64

i bet u did not edit host files "
,arutha64,2011-04-24T08:48Z,"I did edit host files and the autocrack adds the lines itself anyway, then some people in this thread reported that those lines should be removed, I have tried both with and without them.

I think now it might be because I have AC:B installed so ubisoft gamelauncher is a much newer version and won't work with this. Yes I replaced the GameLauncher files as well with those in this torrent as suggested, but it still might be too new. Oh well."
,shawn46,2011-04-27T18:36Z,"this worked for me.....nice upload and again kudos to you guys who break every almost every rule.........
initially it didn't work for me even though i did everything as said......but then i had MCafee antivirus which i assume was the cause.........removed it and the alas the game started, so guys if your game is not starting even after following  the instructions then maybe its your antivirus or firewall thats blocking the game.......i can't guarantee what i said will work but it did work for me........so maybe try it out as last resort...."
,shawn46,2011-04-27T20:21Z,"the game won't start now.......the emulator kind of fails to create the server ....i have no other program running and still it gives error ""An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions"".........it worked for me earlier so i have no idea why its not working now...please help.."
,shawn46,2011-04-28T10:49Z,"Alright, got the server working again.....this is how i did it......i found it from a forum......
if it says something about no internet connection even after doing exactly as its said then follow this step

1)go to start then run write service.msc and search for ""world wide publishing service and disable it everything should be fine (if not)
2)if you don't find service.msc then go to task manager the under services tab check for ""world wide publishing server"" under the description tab.Right click and select sstop service.Thats it,the server should work now, if not then follow next step

2)try this go to command prompt and type ""netstat -ano"". You must see if there is a programm using port 80. Look for the number 0.0.0.0:80 or 127.0.0.1:80. If you find them look at the far right of the screen and write down the corresponding PID number.

Now go to Task Manager > View > Select columns and than mark the PID box. Now click on the ""Processes"" tab and find the program with the PID you wrote down. You must close this programm, or the server emulator won't work. (Credits go to brenoseifert)

this will most probably kill the process that's blocking the server from establishing and the server emulator will start.......now i fell like how naive i was before.....enjoy......!!!!!!!"

,Saoghal,2012-03-22T22:04Z,"Hi, thx for this up, I have a question though. Is it supposed to give acces to achievments IG and UPlay rewards? Coz I don't see any message while I'm playing.

Plus I can't acces to ""ubisoft server"" in extra option. So I was wondering, is it just a ""simple"" crack, or does it give full option access? 

Thx ^^."
