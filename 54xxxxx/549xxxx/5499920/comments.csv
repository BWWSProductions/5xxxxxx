The original (1957 starring Henry Fonda)is still better, but for those that can't stand to watch B&W because of some prejudice, this one is pretty good.  Other than that, took me 23 1/2 hours to get but I'll be seeding for a while for anyone that wants to grab it.

Thanks for quality upload caviwipes"
