I have tried to find this Remake on any torrent site for a long time.  I finally bought a copy from Amazon (It exist in VHS ONLY) and ripped it for anyone in the same situation as me


Plot:
Made for cable television remake of the 1957 classic about eleven jurors quick to condemn a Latino youth on trial for murdering his father before reviewing the evidence. Juror #8 holds out with a verdict of not guilty, thus setting the stage for arguments and reasons why or why not the boy may be guilty.
