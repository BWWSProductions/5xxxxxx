""This book demonstrates that the stories and themes of the Bible were part of the great mythic systems of the ancient world by u sing comparative mythology""
I think it demonstrates the same heap of lies and misconceptions of over 3000 years. 

One example: the story of the ark of Noah. The only boat built from the discriptions of ancient stories that is stable and seaworthy is the one discribed in Genesis (Bereshit). 
The one from the book of Hammurabi (which they say is older, but is not) state a cubic ark. Very appealing mathematically, but not nautically; that would be the most unstable form and everyone would have drowned.

So go on, read it. But be skeptical and check the facts and don't trust hearsay."

As for your 'fundamental difference between God and Allah...'; you've got to be kidding. To us sceptics and agnostics (you know, people who don't need invisible 'friends'?), these supernatural beings are all pretty much the same. 

Coke or Pepsi? A matter of taste....and gullibility."

By the way:Sawe Your intellectual energy - don't carry on a controversy against fanatic idiots!"
,]eep,2010-04-14T00:04Z,"""you do understand the difference between myth and fact, right?""
Yes i do. Do You? I think not. 
As Napoleon said:""History is a myth agreed upon"".  ;)

""To us sceptics and agnostics (you know, people who don't need invisible 'friends'?), these supernatural beings are all pretty much the same.""
So all imaginary friends are the same... Hmm. That makes pretty much all characters in every book written the same. Interesting. That would explain your animosity towards me..."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-14T01:19Z,"Not animosity, @Jeep...although the God-botherers always try to make out that they a persecuted 'minority'...

I just have an over-whelming sense of fatigue whenever I encounter another 'pie-in-the-sky' merchant'. Man created God. Not the other way around.

'So all imaginary friends are the same'...yes, they are, insofar as they imaginary, i.e. they don't exist. Tarzan, Sherlock Holmes and the Archangel Gabriel are all equally fictitious. Now go away."
