Outside the Government, beyond the police, fighting for the future on behalf of the human race. The 21st century is when everything changes and Torchwood is ready.

Led by the mysterious and enigmatic Captain Jack Harkness, Torchwood delves into the unknown and fights the impossible...

Across Cardiff, ordinary people are behaving in odd ways: saying hello to complete strangers, and going out of their way to greet one another. Torchwood discovers that an alien communications field is gaining strength in the area. The team must find the device responsible and shut it off -- before civil unrest engulfs the whole city.

      Read by Burn Gorman, this story takes place during the second series of Torchwood.

      Time-Placement: Owen survives an injury with no lasting ill-effects, placing this at some point before Reset.
