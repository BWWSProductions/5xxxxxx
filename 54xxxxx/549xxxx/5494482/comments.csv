,SURLEWEB,2010-04-27T00:40Z,"Works great ! Very easy to install ( no need to change or rename files, etc )...I use the converter a lot, which has been able to convert videos that Any Video Converter Professional and Total Video Converter wouldn't do...even though it's pretty slow.
Thanks a lot."
,Royalwitcheeez,2010-05-03T01:11Z,"Installs fine but this v. of DIVX has a bug where it stays on ""preparing"" and never converts.
It's a known issue and can be looked up...

Thx for the up."

,skulldragon,2011-11-11T09:41Z,"Hmm, yes, thanks for serial!

And I needed all this just to get one lousy DivX codecs? Oh, why couldn't Vegas just have all popular codecs by default.. >.<

Ok, who was that damn smartass, who hacked my TPB account? Luckily, I'm too smart to keep anything at TBP.. >.>

,Wiskyeye,2012-07-01T18:47Z,Weird issue on win7 with v8.? wont play .mkv for some reason it loads file because I can skip ahead and fast forward frames and see still images but will not play nor play audio. Checked Divx website and seen posts from others with same issue but no response from support or fix listed. All UL of v8.? have same issue even a direct DL from DIVX site. Tried codecs with same result..... Uninstalled......
