,bradass,2010-04-17T13:34Z,you can buy a dvd player that plays .avi files for like $30.  i only make data dvd's.  fits like 5 movies.
,perryl,2010-04-17T15:49Z,"@ jordan, your using cdr instead of dvdr, try using the right format disk if you want to burn a dvd. what your saying your unable to do is NOT burn a VCD not a dvd. a dvd could easily fit this movie on it. nero came with a help section, i suggest you read it over. "

The movie itself exceeded my low expectations."

[V],phatwarez,2010-04-21T13:55Z,"This is a great movie, one you should save for your and your girl to watch together. It's heartwarming but not sappy like a chick flick. You don't feel like you need to tuck your balls away just to watch it. "

Thanks for this, I had a terrible day.
I was making love to my husband - he was on his back and holding his knees up high so his anus was nicely accessible - our chihuahua Jesus was watching (which is a real turn on), and when I was about to ejaculate I pulled out, so as to squirt my beloved with semen. However, a ""cork"" of poo had lodged itself in the eye of my penis. When I came, it not only sounded like a pop-gun, but I shot my dear in the eye with a poo bullet. I had to take him to emergency.
He will enjoy watching The Cazies as he convalesces.


Hope he feels better soon."
