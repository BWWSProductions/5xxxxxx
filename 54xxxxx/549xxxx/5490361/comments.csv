I wonder if Buddha is comfortable with you thieving from others to proseletyse for him ?

Hey dont get me wrong, were all thieves here... just some of us are sanctimonius, delusional wankers like your man raymond here."

Anyway, previous uploads of this movie had sync issues. This version seems to correct that; however, it seems like the video is stretched into full screen. It is not significantly noticeable but those of us who collect movies can tell the difference. The video quality is a true DVDRip. The audio quality appears to be 5.1 audio.

Overall:
Audio - 9/10
Video - 8/10

Thank you uploader."

First, just as many of us have found out, a lot of the Angels & Demons rips do not come with hardcoded subs...this is no exception. However, the audio echos. At first I thought it was just the scene but then I noticed it throughout other scenes as well. I've since deleted this version and currently downloaded:

This version notes that it has hardcoded subs. I will update that torrent when it is down."
