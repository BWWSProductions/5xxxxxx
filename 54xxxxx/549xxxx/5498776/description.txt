This book presents information on how to analyze risks to your networks and the steps needed to select and deploy the appropriate countermeasures to reduce your exposure to physical and network threats.


It also imparts the skills and knowledge needed to identify and counter some fundamental security risks and requirements, inlcuding Internet security threats and measures (audit trails IP sniffing/spoofing etc.) and how to implement security policies and procedures.


In addition, this book also covers security and network design with respect to particular vulnerabilities and threats. It also covers risk assessment and mitigation and auditing and testing of security systems.


From this book, the reader will also learn about applying the standards and technologies required to build secure VPNs, configure client software and server operating systems, IPsec-enabled routers, firewalls and SSL clients.


Chapter coverage includes identifying vulnerabilities and implementing appropriate countermeasures to prevent and mitigate threats to mission-critical processes. Techniques are explored for creating a business continuity plan (BCP) and the methodology for building an infrastructure that supports its effective implementation.


A public key infrastructure (PKI) is an increasingly critical component for ensuring confidentiality, integrity and authentication in an enterprise. This comprehensive book will provide essential knowledge and skills needed to select, design and deploy a PKI to secure existing and future applications.


This book will include discussion of vulnerability scanners to detect security weaknesses and prevention techniques, as well as allowing access to key services while maintaining systems security.
