Part of Nintendo's New Play Control! series of titles of classic Nintendo games remade for the unique control systems of the Wii, this game brings back the unique platformer Donkey Kong Jungle Beat with controls designed around the Wii Remote. The big ape is drumming up a new beat for platformers with this unique action game. Using crazy motions with the Wii Remote, you guide Donkey Kong through wild jungle environments brimming with ravenous enemies and challenging obstacles. As you "drum" your way through diverse stages ranging from lush jungles to floating jelly in the sky, you will battle enormous beasts, collect bananas, get in boxing matches with rivals and even ride animals and vehicles in a jungle gone wild!
