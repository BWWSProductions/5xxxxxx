Nee Nah, Nee Nah, Nee Nah... Fireman Sam is the hero next door!

Naughty Norman Price is up to more of his tricks. Not only does he falsely report a fire but sneaks into the fire station to cause havoc... replacing Jupiter's wax with boot polish, putting grease on the fire pole and even setting off the station alarm!
