Advanced Registry Doctor Pro 9.2.2.18 made Portable.

No need to install it!
Or, if you want to, Setup and Crack are included. This is just the GiveAwayOfTheDay.com program for today. Get it while it lasts. And after it use the Reg.reg file...


The registry is one of the most essential components of Windows OS, critical to proper functioning of any PC computer. Unfortunately, as more and more programs gets installed and then removed, the registry becomes more like a digital dump, full of incorrect shortcuts, invalid extensions, and missing entries, which dramatically hinders computer performance.

Advanced Registry Doctor Pro is capable of scanning for, diagnosing and curing multiple registry problems, which averts possible malfunctions and crashes, and significantly improves the speed of computer loading and performance. In addition, the program comes with a set of advanced options, like registry defragmenting, built-in scheduler, backup and restore feature, history log and many other perks - a registry toolkit, for example.

This version of software looks through the following data for possible â€œregistry spoilersâ€: application paths, uninstall information, COM/ActiveX objects, help files, file extensions, font files, most recently used files list, shared DLLs and folders, startup applications, Windows/MS-DOS Shortcuts. The automatic cure options means that any person, regardless of his or her PC literacy level can solve registry problems by simply pressing a button. Advanced users can opt to make registry changes manually.

ARD can bring some of the dead links back to life. For example, that is if youâ€™ve accidentally moved your files (font files, help files, shared folders, shared DLLs, etc) to some other place. The main point of using ARD is that it will do the entire job for you; you just have to select which problems to search (categories) and HDD list, which will be used by the program for finding solutions. Usually you'll have to use ARD when new program is installed/removed.

The Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.


This has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.



SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal

http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
