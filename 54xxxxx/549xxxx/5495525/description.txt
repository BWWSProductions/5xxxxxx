The True Christmas Story (Christian Documentary)


The True Christmas Story by Ray Vander Laan. This is a wonderful DVD to show friends and family and older children at Christmas time. It gives awesome comparisons between Jesus the King and Herod the King, and how God's plan is fulfilled in the birth of our Savior. A great tool for teaching the true meaning of Christmas with historical locations and people.

I would ask every Christian to do 2 things.

1. If possible please buy this movie. Do you know that there are 2.2 billion Christians on earth today. But only a privileged few, around 12% have the means and the accessibility to buy Christian films. Many Christians are too poor to buy movies or live in places where Christian films are not available. 
That's not all. Out of the 12% who have the means and accessibility to buy Christian media, only around 0.5% ever buys a Christian movie. In other words only 1 out of 200 Christians ever buys a Christian movie. Pathetic ins't it?

2. Please seed the movies. If possible make copies and distribute to your poor neighbors. And please do pray for the movie makers and their families.

Remember the Kingdom of Heaven is in you and so is the choice of Heaven/Hell.
