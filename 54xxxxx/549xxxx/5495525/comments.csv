When I click on the upload button after entering the the text to be typed in the box for security reasons, system displays a blank page after 1-2 mins. Anyone facing this issue?"
[T],verifire,2010-11-10T11:03Z,"No, but experiencing ""error"" when trying to edit upload description, and when commenting torrents, like now, I'm met with a number in upper left corner on white screen, telling me I'm [in this case] commentator number two..

Plus I get ""Error in filename"" when trying to upload a new torrent now. Last time I tried uploading a newly edited movie [no way someone has uploaded it before, cause I re-comped it recently..], I get ""This torrent may exist in our database"".

Yeah..

[Anyone wonder what's happened/happening to TPB? I know I do.. ]"
[T],verifire,2010-11-24T07:28Z,"Aah.. I've finally got around to watching this movie, and it's every bit like you say it is in your description. Great piece of documentary perspective based on archeology and history.

Recommended. Thanks, I.C.!

[PS: I borrow the upload, crop off the commercial in the beginning, and upload it at Blazefire.org. Due credit to you, Indian, of course.. ;-)
