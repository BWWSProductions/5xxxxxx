plot:
Julien and his mum care for each other very much. But Julien has
committed a deadly sin: he is growing into a teenager! Worse, he has
found himself a girlfriend of his age. "Mummy" is not going to tolerate
such an ignominy. Julien is HER baby and will remain HERS for ever, 
encouraged in her "crusade" by her bovine husband and barely thwarted
by the more courageous interventions of Suzanne, Julien's sympathetic
big sister
