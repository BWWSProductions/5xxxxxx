@keeybee: With a pink skull, I'm sure you can handle a bit of critic.

The .cue sheet includes the path to the folder with wave files. When the .cue file is in the same folder: just the filenames without path.

The file names are too long to be loaded via Flac Frontend's ""Add Files"". - Drag and drop works.

The .SFV is not a sfv file. I'm not sure what Mp3tag v2.46 is doing ... it's not a NFO file.

When working around these minor quirks, I was able to create an exact replica of the disc, confirmed by the AccurateRip database, so your basic settings are good.

Best regards."
