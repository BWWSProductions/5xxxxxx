This film is set sometime in 1968 when a strange viral
outbreak is contained within the walls of a military
hospital in Pennsylvania: all those exposed are
destroyed and burned to the ground. A wall of silence
befalls the incidence, and soon enough only a vague
myth remains. The hospital becomes a civilian mental
treatment center. But old secrets can't be kept secret
forever.
