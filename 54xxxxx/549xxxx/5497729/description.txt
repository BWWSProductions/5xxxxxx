BBC Around the World by Zeppelin 576p PDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

In 1929, a Graf Zeppelin circumnavigated the globe. Beneath the airship hung a gondola to accommodate passengers and crew for the 21-day voyage, among them Lady Grace Drummond-Hay, reporting for the Hearst media empire. Based upon her letters and diaries and told exclusively through archival and newsreel film from the time, this film relives the incredible voyage, giving both a fascinating glimpse of day-to-day life in a zeppelin gondola and a look at the world of the roaring twenties.
