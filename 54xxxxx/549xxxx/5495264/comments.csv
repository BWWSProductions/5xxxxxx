Did anyone else get this issue? 

If it's a coding problem, please upload broken files again, this anime masterpiece doesn't deserve this kind of !@#$%#$"
,zlic_yo,2010-06-21T18:59Z,"And please do not try to open/play unfinished episodes, you will corrupt the file and continue to upload broken pieces! "

,zlic_yo,2010-07-28T00:31Z,"It works, thanks for the tip :)"
