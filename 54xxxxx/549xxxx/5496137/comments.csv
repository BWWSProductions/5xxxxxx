[T],TeamPS,2010-04-15T00:26Z,"It is, can't confirm on the 3Gs, but the IPSW files are included, I found the method after days of searching and jailbroke my iPhone 3G. Also cannot confirm if it works on models that have a serial that starts with MC. I would know if my brother let me jailbreak his too but ah well."
[T],TeamPS,2010-04-16T22:03Z,"Can we have confirmation on whether this works on:

1) iPhone 3Gs
2) Any iPod Touch
3) MC Model iDevices?"

NOT working for 3Gs new bootrom (MC Models)- iTunes does not allow you to downgrade to 3.1.2.

Should still work for 3Gs old bootrom."
