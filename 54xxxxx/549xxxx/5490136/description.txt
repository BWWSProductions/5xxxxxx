Guys this is the IRIS BAE 146 SOUND PACK, it comes with a bonus aircraft teaser, NOTE:- it has NO COCKPIT AND NO WINGVIEW, 

but has a default panal with it, i like flying high spec aircraft like PMDG, but there is no BAE 146 out there for fsx users, iv pannel merged and its does the job, its not a bad model and the sound pack is about a 7/10

Enjoy
