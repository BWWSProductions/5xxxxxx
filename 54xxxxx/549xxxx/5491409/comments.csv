,_Ghost_,2010-05-10T22:49Z,"Thanks for this awesome upload, all I needed was the companion audio files to practise some.
I love Arabic and this method made me almost fluent with very little work, and quite some time spent on it!"
,pappoo_samma,2010-05-28T08:33Z,Thank you for an amazing upload.
,Ishmo,2010-06-11T00:05Z,What do I do about the serial number?
,KeygenDJF,2010-06-18T23:55Z,"i tried to install these on rosetta stone v 3.4.5 after mounting it with magic iso. it didn't work so got ultra iso and tried that too. none of them worked but then i read a comment about somebody using daemon tools lite. i got that, mounted it, and added it to rosetta stone and it worked perfectly!"
,riverasq,2010-08-15T10:39Z,"Greetings, I am new, I downloaded a bit torrent, then extracted the files, I feel like I am missing some type of application software, can someone give me guidance into transform clips into the actual rosetta stone, I am lost right now, and really wish to start learning arabic for personal reasons fast."
,blink3377,2010-08-21T05:16Z,Does this contain trojans? I downloaded it and it says it has trojans. Are they false trojans?
,gregersamsa,2010-08-23T18:31Z,"Thanks a bunch for this! I'm going to learn Arabic if it's the last thing I do :-)
Everyone speaks Arabic now on the subway and everywhere, I want to know what they're talking about."
,mevrickgood,2010-08-31T20:25Z,seed please
,agent412,2010-09-06T03:08Z,Do i need to download anything else to use this?
,HistoryDude,2010-09-06T22:21Z,"Download went great.  Disk imaging and install went great.  Then it asked me for the deal-breaking ""activation code.""  Does anybody have any insights into how to work around this?  Thank you in advance.  "
,Albien214,2010-09-27T06:18Z,So. Where's are the serial codes.
,Prayera,2010-10-09T23:18Z,"Hey, pls help! I can see all the Audio Companion files, but when I'm trying to mount the CDs, all I get is a folder with 4 other folders (""data"", ""documentation"", ""languages"" and ""speech""). What can I do?? 
ps: I'm using MagicISO"
,Prayera,2010-10-10T00:58Z,"IT WORKS!! And I finally got it. For all of you who say they just see 4 folders when they mount - here is the solution!
You need the basic Rosetta Stone program in order to run the Arabic one. So what you have to do FIRST is download Rosetta Stone (I found it here, and it works just fine: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3852202/The_Rosetta_Stone_Application_(Version_3) )
After that, when you open Rosetta Stone, it asks you to chose a language, and that's when the mounted CDs will work by themselves.
Hope it helps! :) "

,U-SeF,2011-02-17T06:05Z,"THANKS FOR THIS TORRENT YOUR AMAZING!

BUT WHAT IS UP WITH THE SERIAL NUMBERS!? CAN ANYONE HELP ME WITH THAT???"
,Abdulmumit,2011-04-05T11:20Z,"Works great with Rosetta Stone version 3.4.5 on Windows 7 64 bit. No serial needed, just mount the desired ISO and launch your Rosetta Stone, so that it installs the new language course.

Thank you!"
,ramro2002,2011-04-16T22:10Z,"Downloaded, (very fast), ISO'd to some 700 mb disks, downloaded the original rosetta stone program to run the arabic pack. It worked for a while... serials please, and i get an error now :There was an error in the application, LIST INPUT DEVICE SPEECH MASSAGE"

,Mousey511,2011-08-21T18:44Z,Thank you so much for the download!!! But how do I get around the activation codes???  Any help is appreciated!
,agungsp2000,2011-11-24T15:27Z,"arrggghh...

so crazy finding the activation code, found out, itsn't needed, the solution is so simple, just restart the computer after adding level 1 and it will run without asking, i havent tested level 2-3, whether they need activation or not"
,_kemania_,2011-11-27T14:21Z,"Hey thanks for the upload!

I'm still having problems activating more than L1 units 1&2 - I tried restarting and nothing changed; i'm still locked out.

I'd already got a legitimate copy of RS3 with Portuguese L1-2 on it. Could it be an interference there?

Any thoughts?"
,FatAdZ,2011-12-18T07:13Z,"For anyone having trouble, restart your computer and try again; works every time. Before restarting it asks for an activation code, and after restarting it works without a hitch."
,aarjcas,2012-04-10T03:07Z,"I'm Irish and i hope to learn some of the most spoken languages in the world including Arabic, than you uploader."
