"Another Another Chance"

Naomi's (AnnaLynne McCord) little white lie has become the 
talk of the school, and when she is forced to testify in 
front of the school board, she drops a bomb that no one 
saw coming. Annie (Shenae Grimes) is finally able to put 
her relationship with Jasper (Zach Sherman, who does not 
appear in the episode) behind her, but when she and Silver 
(Jessica Stroup) inadvertently drive past the scene of her 
hit-and-run, the guilt comes rushing back to haunt her. 
Dixon (Tristan Wilds) and Ivy's (Gillian Zinser) fake-
dating situation continues and the two make a decision that 
neither one anticipated. Adrianna (Jessica Lowndes) and 
Navid (Michael Steger) share a friendly conversation which 
doesn't go over well with their significant others, Gia 
(guest star Rumer Willis) and Lila (guest star Amber 
Wallace). An argument between Gia and Adrianna results in 
Adrianna walking in on Gia and her ex-girlfriend. Liam 
receives a surprise visit from his father, Finn (guest star 
Scott Patterson, "Gilmore Girls"), just released from 
prison. Though Ivy has warned Ryan (Ryan Eggold) that her 
mother is trouble, he continues to date Laurel.

Enjoy :)
