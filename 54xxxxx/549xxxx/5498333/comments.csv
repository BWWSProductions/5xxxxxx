If the file was moved into a different folder after the torrent was downloaded - it won't seed after.
How do I relocate the file to seed it?"

download without a doubt"
,drunken_prozac,2010-04-26T20:07Z,"File is good but picture quality is compromised due to the small file size for a 5.1 audio version.
The length of the movie means more compression and the video is ?blocky? around the edges.

Very good if you want to watch on your pc monitor but I would get a 720p version for home tv viewing. (Am currently downloading a 8gig version)

for this file as a DVD rip (1-poor 10-perfect dvd rip);
A=9

,ayjeezy465,2010-04-27T07:34Z,"Ok so they won't let me post the link for the real dvdrip so i am going to tell u how to get there. Go to torrentz dot com and search for ""avatar bharrebs"" go to vertor to download!"
,orey_pd,2010-04-28T22:42Z,"but i prefer 1280x720 pixel (BUT SIZE IS  1.2 GB) torrent :)

,Averex8,2010-04-29T00:28Z,"This movie was incredible. It has the best special effects I've seen since the matrix. I can only imagine how it must have been to see it in theaters especially in 3D. 

This was my first time downloading a movie this size. I decided to do so after reading the comments here where everyone was saying how great this movie is and that it should be seen in theaters and that they only wanted to download the blu-ray version in 1080p, so that's why I decided to download a high quality version and not settle for the usual 700mb one. I've also read that this movie is the highest grossing movie of all time and is critically acclaimed. Plus I've been wanting to see this movie ever since I first saw the trailer in theaters so yeah. 

The quality of this rip isn't the best but its good enough. Although it's not blocky you can still see the compression but it's small enough that you'll forget about it and won't notice it anymore after the first 20 minutes which is when jake uses his avatar for the first time. The audio is good but on loud noises such as ship engines, animals roaring, and people yelling you can hear the quality but it's not that bad. The subtitles is the only thing that was perfect. 

A: 8/10
V: 8/10"

,ShineDog69,2010-05-01T05:36Z,"Cheers Retail. Much appreciated. Not going to be anywhere near as good as seeing it in 3D on the big screen but still a great movie even though it's a little bit of a ""Fern Gully"" rip off."
,Veovis,2010-05-03T00:18Z,"I just don't understand it...  w h y  does this happen?  It'd been downloading fine for a while, it's now 91.3% done, and there are clearly plenty of seeders, but it just won't download any more except in fits and bursts for a few seconds at .01kb/s.  WHY?  So frustrating to have it close to done, but now 99% of the time, I get only an infinity symbol for the estimated time left 'till download completion.  (I'm using uTorrent).  I have it set for unlimited bandwidth, I have the file set on high priority, I even stopped the couple other concurrent downloads I had going - but nothing.  Even with all these seeders, it just doesn't want to dl now.  Frustrating as all hell.  I'm not blaming this on the torrent at all (which is great, thanks), I just want to understand wtf is going on.  "

,sunstrike11,2010-08-22T09:11Z,hi raymondhome i have a question where you got the subtitles?? caz they are cool.
,QuentinH94,2010-09-06T11:00Z,"This one is very high quality, and downloaded in about an hour. the top seeded one downloaded, much faster, but, is lesser quality, I suggest this one."
,rostbif,2010-11-13T10:52Z,"@raymondhome: thanks a million :)

@powerfool - Quit bitching and go and buy the Bluray; if you can afford a 50"" TV it suggests you also have the means to buy the original disc which will deliver the kind of quality you're expecting."
