,nightsongz2,2010-04-14T04:26Z,Damn...still waiting for someone to upload a NTSC retail dvdr.
,theone_nr,2010-04-14T09:55Z,"SEED !!! I'm not able to understand one thing , if u don't seed how do you want to down with more speed ??? Throtle ur upload isn't a good way to increase ur down speed !!! SEED !!!"
,cinesimon,2010-04-14T10:58Z,"Thank you so much goblindown: this is a perfect copy. May good karma seek you out. 

To those not patient and/or or unaware: in some countries the upload limit is not great - in the UK for example, most people are limited to a 30k upload speed. So quite your whining, and understand we cannot all have super fast speeds. Nor is everyone as perfect as you."
,goblindown,2010-04-14T12:23Z,"Thank you for your good karma wish, I hope it finds me in that overcrowded world, seems a little difficult :P

And downloaders with high upload speed, please do not throttle your speed. Also  I will seed it as much as I can."
,cinesimon,2010-04-14T12:32Z,"Advice to punters: don't burn the ISO as you get it.
I think the copy protection may not have been removed, as the disc I burned straight from ISO was rejected by my  DVD player which rejects 'copied discs'(that haven't had RCE removed, obviously). 
I put it through DVD shrink(which removes rce) and the burned film now plays fine.
FYI, so you don't waste a disc."
,Spuddle1,2010-04-14T18:27Z,thanks for the info cinesimon...saved everyone a dl disc ;-)
