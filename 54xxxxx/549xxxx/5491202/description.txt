I am frustratingly hard-pressed to find a sufficient amount of information about today's artist, Christof Glowalla, a minimal synth/NDW outfit from Germany. I'm even having difficulty pinning down a proper image of the act, aside from various sketches in this vein. Though seemingly a one man outfit, the 'official' myspace page clues in on a few other collaborators, though their roles are undisclosed. Certain other records indicate one lone release, a 1980 7'' single limited to 1000 copies, but I've unearthed and uploaded a one disc collection of completed works, which include a handful of other tracks recorded throughout the 1980s, which most likely appeared on other under-the-radar 7'' singles. 

That all said, if anyone has any further information on Christof, past OR present, please send it my way. Otherwise, without any further delay, the details:
