,awaji1,2010-04-16T07:49Z,Thank you. So this is the first book of the trilogy...
[T],g-roid,2010-04-16T11:22Z,"Yes, this is the first book of the original trilogy. There are subsequent prequels and sequels as well.

There are some other torrents for the rest of the series, unfortunately most are of poor sound quality. 

Scott Brick is an excellent reader, and this is fresh from the CDs.

Enjoy!"

,marius2859,2010-06-06T11:33Z,I suggest reading them in the order they were published.  The two prequels will be much more interesting that way.  I look forward to hearing Scott Brick's version.  I remember the old versions had poor sound and were even missing parts.
