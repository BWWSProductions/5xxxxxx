,Daker9,2010-04-14T16:52Z,many have downloaded this file I took the time to create and  shared and no one is seeding. Seed you selfish buggers! Gosh!
,hifibanan,2010-04-15T17:38Z,"I started to DL this 30 minutes after your upload, and have only reached 51%, are you sure anyone have gotten it completely yet??"
,Daker9,2010-04-16T22:29Z,"Yes with a ratio of 4.026 that means I have uploaded more than 4 X the file size.
If I download a file and see there are LOTS of seeders I don't mind killing the torrent but if it's a new torrent and there are few seeders I seed it for at least a week.
It's only the nice thing to do!"
,bonfire22,2010-11-29T17:34Z,"Been seeding it for a week now, it says 0 seeds and more than a hundred peers. Please seed. My dowload stopped at 69%."
