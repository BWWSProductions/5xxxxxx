"Benched"

When Luke and Manny's hot-tempered basketball coach quits 
in the middle of a game, Jay and Phil both jockey to fill 
the position. Claire and Gloria each struggle with the 
realization that they might not be number one in their 
children's lives anymore, and Mitchell takes Cameron 
along to meet a prospective employer, but Cameron's big 
personality doesn't necessarily help to make a good 
impression.

Enjoy :)
