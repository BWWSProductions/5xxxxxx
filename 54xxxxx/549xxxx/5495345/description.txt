"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!"

We hear this question a lot. Nonetheless, I'm glad you asked that!

This is an album brought to you by Uncyclopedia (www.uncyclopedia.org), the content-free humor wiki that anyone can edit.

It is a compilation of 25 poorly-written "songs" selected from UnTunes, the project/dumpsite for "music" created by Uncyclopedia editors.

All music is released under the site's Creative Commons license and is released direct-to-torrent, so it is free to distribute, recreate, and abuse for your own sick pleasures.

We are sincerely apologetic for creating this.

                                        Sorry again,
                                        UNCYCLOPEDIA
