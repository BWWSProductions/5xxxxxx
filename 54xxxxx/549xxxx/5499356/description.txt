Release Notes:

'A-Z Vol. 1' marks the halfway point in AshÐ¢s groundbreaking 26 single
campaign the A-Z Series. Wrapping up singles A to M alongside a host of
bonus material, the compilation illustrates Ash rejuvenated creative
zeal.

Currently back in their Manhattan HQ recording tracks which will
complete the second half of the series, Ash have been spurred on by the
unique challenge of a singles only future. The scrutiny of each track
being drip-fed to fans, juxtaposed by freedom from the traditional
2-year album cycle, has fostered a new Ash era of diverse, imaginative
pop.

While the rock electro hybrids True Love 1980 and Space Shot have
broken through to the airwaves, the consistent quality of the series is
backed up by the varied and original song writing on the tracks in
between. The 3-minute gem Ichiban, the expansive dynamic rock of Joy
Kicks Darkness, the classic Wheeler love song Tracers and the
atmospheric tale of humanity lost Pripyat are amongst the bands
responses to the creative everest that is a 26 single campaign.

Retail version including 5 extra tracks. Enjoy!
