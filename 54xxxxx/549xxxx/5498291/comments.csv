,PL44,2010-04-16T13:56Z,Horrible quality on this as well. A clear case of format change...a shame.
,Shar1973,2010-04-16T17:29Z,"Hi PL44, I wonder how you compare a song of 1968 with your standard. My aime is to share a videoclip which is watchable. Can you give me a torrent of which you claims that no format change has taken place with a better quality than this one? 
Hope to hear from you soon.
