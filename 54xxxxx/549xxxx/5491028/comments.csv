[V],twentyforty,2010-04-11T17:20Z,"@hkoraddi: So far I've seen CAM and TS. When something good comes out, I'll do it, for sure. It's animated movie and usual magic does not work if prints are ugly looking."
,hamada_7ossam,2010-04-11T18:12Z,"can u upload ""the bounty hunter"" plzz?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-11T19:41Z,"@hamada_7ossam: I have encoded CAM or TS week or two ago, in last week several R5 video/Line audio versions came out. IMAGINE, VISION and MENTION are severely out of sync and ILG REPACK is in sync but have terrible, ""canned"" sound. That last one I can encode as [quark] because anything better would be pure waste of bandwidth."
