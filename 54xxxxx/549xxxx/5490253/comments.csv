[V],mothergoose56,2010-04-12T23:47Z,"Holy Shit, bevy of problems today. LAME kept crashing on the remote box so I'm encoding O&A now. Also did the R&F ""Quick and Dirty Guide"" special from the weekend but I haven't been able to up due to my upping machining having major network issues. Nothing is working, I'm going to just use an image from a week or so ago rather than F with it. Stuff should be coming down the pipeline soon, probably the R&F first then O&A later. I did finally solve the Lame issues I think, for some reason the system is getting fragmented quickly - I've scheduled evening defrags which should solve that problem.
