Hi 20-40, this is a direct reponse to your posting on LOTS E15.

The quark has changed my life and I do NOT want it to go away...

...Is there a rule you want us to follow, e.g. Pacific - once seeding has reached 3:1 then limit upload speed to 5KBs?...

...Trying to be fair to everyone but will loose everything else if it means keeping [quark] alive!

@Jon & Stev: I completely understand and you are not alone. [quark] made lot of noise. Even without real mass.
But.
Everything I have said on LOTS e15 is frightening and devastating fact - however behavior of the people haven't surprised myself and for sure not the Jon or any other man who know few things (and have learned or gathered on a hard way thing or two about nature of the humans).
Have any of you downloaded a 43 minutes long episode for 16 seconds? I repeat - SIXTEEN SECONDS. 
Well, about 60 guys, mainly from Sweden, have such experience. And about 400 got full episode under 6 minutes. I spoke about Vampire Diaries from Friday...

Take a look at any of the [quark] torrents. How many seeders is active?
LATEST talk show pack (greatest saving of all) has TWO frikkin seeder whole Sunday... one sucker plus myself.
ALL this super-trooper-light-speed-fast guys have seeded - ALMOST NOTHING.

Do you know who have been left to drag as snails? THE PEOPLE WHO THIS THINGS ARE FOR - people who still have needed few hours to download. Read my damn ""quark Manifesto"", in entirety, few times, and if something wasn't clear enough, I am sure that your brain could fill eventual blanks up. My English is not very good, but I know how to make myself clear.

As I have said thousands of times:
""I do not expect a thing, from any of you"". I do not ""prescribe"" ratios, time - nothing.

These people do. 

I cannot but to repeat myself:
Be decent human beings, be better than any other men. 

Jon, Stev, do you know how much of people like you is here? I will tell you: twenty-two. And I know all of you not just by your screen-names but I know your IP numbers, how much this and that, pretty much I have a decent picture how any of these twenty two behave - but I see literary hundredths of thousands who haven't read any of these words, never will and never ever would understand. 

None of the things. "

Says 21/1 here, but utorrent shows 18/108? Anyways I'm gettin' good speed (got 100% bandwidth used, which is ~110kb/s)"
,Alecssei,2010-04-19T22:53Z,"Hi there 20/40,

I would like to thank you for the amount of time yo invest in others  - and perhaps in some great pictures, :p

Question: Will you make another torrent with all the episodes of a TV Show (e.g. Family Guy) once the season is over?? Please let it be yes.

Thanks so very much for everything, even if the answer is NO.

Kind regards,

Alexey"
