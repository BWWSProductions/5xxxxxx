,junh1024,2010-04-16T01:58Z,Didnt Cameron say the BD was gonna be 16.9 AR?
,theshape31,2010-04-16T03:53Z,"This was not ripped from the Blu-ray.  If it was, this would be the only rip in existence.  So no way."
,stormgardh,2010-04-16T05:47Z,i dont think its a BR Rip either.. i mean the guy who supposedly ripped it should have made a better copy lol.. like 1080p :P
,somedude.1001,2010-04-16T05:49Z,"Not fake but this is not a High-res BDRip.

Waste of time."
,moshster,2010-04-16T07:34Z,"The 3D Blu-Ray will be 1.78, but the 2D will be in cinemascope, 2.35.  "
,moshster,2010-04-16T07:38Z,This is obviously an upscaled DVDrip.  Why do some people think upscaling is HD?!!  Upscaling does not magically add definition that never existed on a DVD.
[V],GoodFilms,2010-04-16T10:44Z,FAKE
,Bnita,2010-04-16T10:52Z,"This is no BD Rip.
ItÂ´s the DVDScreener.
Ashole! Why this shit?"

,Christian777,2010-04-16T13:48Z,"So its not a bd rip but a good copy so I want it anyway, please seed..."
,leviathan_II,2010-04-16T15:26Z,"Why would anyone want a >1gb Blu Ray Rip?

Surely if you had proper Blu Ray copy you'd have a good 8gb+ upload in at least 720p"
,pinnochio,2010-04-16T19:04Z,Bluray rip @ ONE GB?? Waste of time...
,intobearzz,2010-04-16T19:34Z,THIS SHIT IS WASTE OF TIME! IT ONLY 927.64MB! BULLSHIT BR THO. NOT SURE WHO GONNA HAVE THE REAL BR OUT WHEN THE DVD AND BLURAY OUT IN THE MARKET ON THE 22nd
,Ahmedattia24,2010-04-16T20:14Z,"Not necessary the 22nd, Sherlock Holmes and LOTR were released a week earlier, anyways just by looking through the screenshots it looks like FAKE UPSCALED BULLSHIT!"
,yadam2001,2010-04-16T22:12Z,crap
,jimk770i,2010-04-17T03:41Z,"it's in MKV, the files are usually lesser than usual...let's just try to download this one and if it's a crap then what is that to us?
thanks chatraja, I hope what u said is true...i'll comment back after I finished downloading this one!"
,jimk770i,2010-04-17T05:13Z,"after 2 hours, I downloaded this:
this looks like a DVDScreener to me...
not a bluray rip:
A:6, V:8
well, better wait for the release of a Bluray then..:-(
anyway, thanks chatraja"
,theshape31,2010-04-17T20:14Z,"Please re-title this release DVDScr, NOT BRrip.

Also, move this out of Highres and into Movies considering it's an SD source.

Let's keep things honest.  Thank you."
,jimk770i,2010-04-17T21:32Z,"Sorry...after considerable amount of time I can say that V:6, A:5
There is an irritating noise at the background!"
,mrpras,2010-04-18T04:47Z,Chatraja you jerk. It's obviously not a blu-ray rip. Why lie?
[T],zeromancer,2010-04-18T23:11Z,He's a n00b.
,intobearzz,2010-04-20T21:15Z,"BLURAY MY AUSS! AIN;T NO DAMN BLURAY RIP! IT REGULAR DVD RIP. WHAT MAKE U THINK IT A MKV BUD?
