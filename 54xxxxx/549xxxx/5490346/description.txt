      Total Wipeout, TV's biggest, brashest, daftest game show
      returns for another episode of bumps, crunches, smashes and
      splashes. Once again 20 over-excited Brits throw their caution
      and dignity to the wind on the purpose-built obstacle course in
      Argentina, all hoping that their bodies hold out long enough to
      capture that 10,000-pound first prize. Richard Hammond hosts,
      commenting and commentating on the unfolding carnage, while
      Amanda Byram fails to keep the giggles at bay at the side of the
      course.
