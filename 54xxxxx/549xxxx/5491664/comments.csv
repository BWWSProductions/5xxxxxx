,PyroxNOR,2010-04-12T08:53Z,Can you upload the 125cc race to??
,PyroxNOR,2010-04-12T08:55Z,I gonna seed for a long time if you upload the 125cc race! If you upload the 125 race you are the BEST!!
,tdmk1,2010-04-12T10:14Z,"Sorry guys, the 125 & Moto2 races are only available via the BBCi service which I am currently unable to automatically cap in the same way as I get the 'standard' channels... My wife doesn't appreciate how much time I put into capping the F1 & MotoGP already so I'm not gonna be uploading 125/Moto2 stuff or I'll end up sleeping on the sofa! ;)"
,dpance,2010-04-12T15:51Z,"So my good friend TDMK let me share my horrible weekend with you.  After being outbid on Ebay in the last few seconds to have a pristine 1098S Ducati Superbike stolen from my clutches, I figured at the very least I?d watch SpeedTV?s coverage and celebrate another easy Casey Stoner victory to start the season in Qatar.  After all, the dude owns that track in the desert right?  The usual dismal SpeedTV program begins and I?m greeted with a few new faces.  Can I assume a better broadcast is in my future for 2010 MotoGP?  To cut to the chase, nope.  It?s still one hour in length with no substantive replays or podium coverage.  Yes I got to see two seconds of a gorgeous Desmo and its rider off in the kitty litter but why?  How did it happen?  Can I see the crash at all angles?  Hell no!  At least they confirmed Stoner was in good health and shall be at the next race in Japan.

Still crying in my beer over the loss of the Superbike and all the carbon fiber upgrades & engine tinkering I had in the works, I figured why not take a chance on The Pirate Bay and see if ole TDMK had been so kind as to share with us the proper BBC broadcast.  Ah, there it is.  That down and out feeling immediately left me as I began to download the torrent.  Hey, Ducati made more than one 1098S bike, right?  Maybe I might be lucky and find a seller who wants to part with a low mileage 2009 1198S ride with the slightly larger engine and a bit of warranty left.  There?s plenty of Termignoni exhaust choices still to be made as well as a myriad of clutch upgrades to ponder.  Yes kids, life is indeed good again.  We have MotoGP.  We have the BBC.  We have TDMK.

What can I say other than thank you once again kind sir.  I?ll be seeding this first race for years into the future just as I continue to do all the 2009 season you were so kind to upload.

Best regards from all those MotoGP loving folks here in Texas !!!!"
,tdmk1,2010-04-12T17:37Z,"Welcome back 'dpance' - sorry to hear about the ebay nightmare - have a look at http://www.powersnipe.com/ it might save you a few tears in the future.

Hope you like the new, smaller, better quality files... :)"
,wb21,2010-04-12T20:06Z,"Thank God, TMDK, your so reliable. I had to watch this on Eurosport yestarday as I couldnt find any free BBC feeds on the net and the commentary and introduction are terrible compared to BBC... Please never change from the BBC, best coverage by far!

Would be cool if you could include the 125 & Moto2.... Especially Moto2 as its turning out to be as good as or better than World SBK!!!

Thanks, I have been seeding last years Qatar race till now"
,dpance,2010-04-12T23:38Z,"TDMK1,

Thanks for the link although I?m already familiar.  The moment I lost the auction I knew I?d been Sniped.  Doh!  As I mentioned earlier, that?s not the only Ducati ever made.

Pardon the second comment in your torrent but I have a couple of more questions please:

1.	What happened to my girl Suzy Perry?  She was outstanding with her MotoGP coverage and a real asset to the BBC broadcast.  I?ll give Ms. Gow a chance but I wonder why Suzy decided to step down.  I know she was sick for a portion of last year but kind of like when Stoner was out, I never ?really? got the inside scoop as to what was going on.
2.	I dig your new presentation and file structure!  Very nice indeed.  If I want, I can watch the race on my phone or my son?s Xbox 360.  Another tip of the hat.

And guys, TDMK1 has made it clear he CAN NOT upload coverage of the 125 and Moto2 races or his wife will cut off certain body parts.  Those of you who keep asking for the expanded coverage apparently aren?t married.  Let?s NOT press our luck and be very thankful with what we have.

Finally, while I?ve had a man-crush on The GOAT for years you have to wonder the outcome of Qatar had Stoner not crashed.  Damn that?s a nice looking Desmosedici!  I?d part with some serious cash to take a spin on that rocket?"

,RickeeBoy,2010-04-13T17:14Z,"TDMK1, Do you realise that you are spreading dangerous drugs with your downloads as your U/L's are inducing raving adrenalin fuelled , screaming, passion crazy addicts desperate for more and more and more......    Thanks Man. ( PS Love the Professional TXT outlining the prog. Actually the best I've seen. And AVI or MKV or MP4 - all good - so your choice is good ) Thanks for all the races last year as well."

Cheers for link to RSS - now have you on RSS - 

PS - MotoGP is a also a superb format and size - any chance of BBC Jerez race - or did the Beeb not broadcast it ?? - Others have it at 2.2 Gb but you do half a Gb which is just superb - others dont realise that in other parts of the world speeds are slow and limits cost..... Anyway Thanks Heaps - from expat now in NZ ..Cheers."
