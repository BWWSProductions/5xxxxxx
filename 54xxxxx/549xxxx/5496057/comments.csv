This is how you do:

1.Download this torrent (ofc.)
2. Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5497507/GTA_IV__Episodes_From_Liberty_City_Crack___.Reg (If it shows that it's a virus I recommend that you should uninstall your AV because it sucks)
3. extract The game into C:\program files\rockstar games\
4. extract the crack into the EFLC folder. double click the EFLCINSTALL.reg file and apply.
5. open up regedit and locate HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

AND (If you're using x64 I think)

HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now you should make new strings in the wow6432 folder. Give them the same name and value as the ones in HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now to InstallFolder key you should type in the location of the game.. e.g. ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City\EFLC""

6. Start the game with LaunchEFLC"

Then I get the messege the downloadable content isn't installed and it will try to load gtaiv instead and then load fails. 
I've rechecked everything and i'm not new to applying cracks and it's the first time in a long time with issue. Does anyone have this prob or have solution? I've done the x64 reg add and made strings for EFLC and nothing. Please someone help. "
,sharky4687,2010-04-17T22:00Z,@Seoulboy1 So you're having GTA IV installed at the same time. Maybe thats what is interfering with your start. Make sure you've got the right folder adress in the string.
,kudlaty_true,2010-04-17T22:01Z,"Hi. For me the game starts with yellow rockstar logo with first music, blue rockstar logo and crashes. Any of you got that?
(Win7 x64)"
,Seoulboy1,2010-04-17T22:06Z,"@sharky actually i don't have a gtaiv installed. I think the game is defaulting back to gtaiv original because it give me option saying the downloadable content isn't autoloaded and it will try to load gtaiv and press enter. Then it fails obviously because i dont' have gtaiv on my comp. Basically the system is not getting that eflc is isntalled, yet the crack lets me load upto start screen then so on. I've rechecked paths for install folders, but no go. I've tried putting space between string name like Install Folder vs InstallFolder and what not with no go. I've pretty much tried everything with registry i can think of. Renamed folders and matched paths again to see if that worked with no go. Done it with and without gfwl/xvliveless with no go. "
,Seoulboy1,2010-04-17T22:11Z,"I also wanted to add that I recently reinstalled windows 7 x64 with pretty much bare computer minus a couple games and firefox atm. I've also tried with and without internet connected.. offline profile.. etc. What I think I need help with is trying to get the comp to recognize the install of EFLC which must be with reg, but I'm just not having success. I've worked with comp since dos and comfortable with command promp and paths and whatnot so I'm def not making noob mistakes there. I'm really running out of things to try basically and need some insight. "
,Seoulboy1,2010-04-17T22:24Z,"@kudalty for your prob, you are missing the req reg files for the x64. You will need to make the same reg files to Wow6432Node folder. I did this by using the crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5497507/GTA_IV__Episodes_From_Liberty_City_Crack___.Reg and the right click on the reg file included in crack and select edit, Then on the path up top which is set up for win32 change it to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC then save the file. What you did was edit the path this file was gonna create the reg files to a x64 req folder path. Now if you double click on the file, it will go ahead and add the files for you in one step. You can also do this manually by seaching for regedit in win7 search and going in to the correct folder path and adding strings. "
,kudlaty_true,2010-04-17T22:49Z,"@Seulboy1
Thanks, but now I have problem exactly like yours. All is right until the choosing of scenario. It says that I'm missing the content and it's trying to play mission 1 from GTA IV, which I do not have, nor do I want to. When you'll think of something, please post here..."
,kudlaty_true,2010-04-17T23:19Z,"Probably not, but is lack of flash player (can't see social club in menu) could have something to do with it?
Seulboy, do you have socialclub visible?"
,sharky4687,2010-04-17T23:22Z,"@pipakin I downloaded it from this torrent and it went 400-800kb/s.

@Seoulboy1 Did you put the folder adress in the ""install folder""-key @ wow6432node map or the original? "
,sharky4687,2010-04-17T23:23Z,@kudlaty_true Mine isnt either visible. Still I can play. 
,sharky4687,2010-04-17T23:29Z,Sorry for triple-post but I just noticed I run my LaunchEFLC.exe with windows xp (service pack 3) compability and as administrator. Just a heads up.
,kudlaty_true,2010-04-17T23:45Z,"Sharky, I did a little research and people actually have this problem in mass numbers. This gave me an idea. Can you upload a save file at the absolutely beggining of lost and damned, when you start the game? Because people who have xbox360 had the same problem a year ago and there it was a saving problem. Please, RS or MU, whatever.
Thanks. Oh, and tell me where it's supposed to be located."
,flamemc1,2010-04-18T04:16Z,"Right i finally got this to work, follow @sharky4687 discription of what to do and i got it to work, its nothing to do with gfwl or if you have gta4 already on ure system, its all to do with the regedit setting, start with a fresh extraction, delete anything youve done already including the .reg files youve added, and extract the files to this exact locastion

C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City

You dont need to change the .reg file in the crack then, and then just follow these exact instructions, also make sure the contents of EFLC is in the location above and not in the EFLC folder.


Alright I got this working perfectly on W7 x64

This is how you do:

1.Download this torrent (ofc.)
2. Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5497507/GTA_IV__Episodes_From_Liberty_City_Crack___.Reg (If it shows that it's a virus I recommend that you should uninstall your AV because it sucks)
3. extract The game into C:\program files\rockstar games\
4. extract the crack into the EFLC folder. double click the EFLCINSTALL.reg file and apply.
5. open up regedit and locate HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

AND (If you're using x64 I think)

HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now you should make new strings in the wow6432 folder. Give them the same name and value as the ones in HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now to InstallFolder key you should type in the location of the game.. e.g. ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City\EFLC""
5. Install games for windows - live program
6. Start the game with LaunchEFLC "

,ludipirat,2010-04-18T18:05Z,"@JasonP I mean this description:Right i finally got this to work, follow @sharky4687 discription of what to do and i got it to work, its nothing to do with gfwl or if you have gta4 already on ure system, its all to do with the regedit setting, start with a fresh extraction, delete anything youve done already including the .reg files youve added, and extract the files to this exact locastion

C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City

You dont need to change the .reg file in the crack then, and then just follow these exact instructions, also make sure the contents of EFLC is in the location above and not in the EFLC folder.


Alright I got this working perfectly on W7 x64

This is how you do:

1.Download this torrent (ofc.)
2. Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5497507/GTA_IV__Episodes_From_Liberty_City_Crack___.Reg (If it shows that it's a virus I recommend that you should uninstall your AV because it sucks)
3. extract The game into C:\program files\rockstar games\
4. extract the crack into the EFLC folder. double click the EFLCINSTALL.reg file and apply.
5. open up regedit and locate HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

AND (If you're using x64 I think)

HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now you should make new strings in the wow6432 folder. Give them the same name and value as the ones in HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now to InstallFolder key you should type in the location of the game.. e.g. ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City\EFLC""
5. Install games for windows - live program
6. Start the game with LaunchEFLC 
P.S. It doesn't have to be this torrent I have downloaded it from a private tracker because speed here is horrible."

,JonsoNP,2010-04-18T18:52Z,"Okay, I got it to work too,

This works perfectly on W7 x64

This is how you do:

5. Install games for windows - live program (Or use XliveLess; http://www.gtavision.com/index.php?section=downloads&site=download&id=1975)
6. Start the game with LaunchEFLC

Has anyone else had this issue?  Any ideas?"
,SubGum,2010-04-19T04:49Z,"Nm, I solved my problem above.

GTA IV and EFLC share the same settings files, so if you're not running the latest patches (same versions) for both, you will get screwed in one because the settings options are different from patch to patch.

All I had to do is run GTA IV with the ""-safemode"" command line for it to reset all my settings to the lowest on game start.  Then go into graphics settings, set everything how I wanted, and viola! It works again.

Note that if you do this and then run EFLC again, it will screw up your original GTA IV startup again, and you'll have to start over.

At least I can still play GTA IV with mods this way!"

- In the Rockstar Games key create the EFLC key the same way.
- In EFLC, Right-Click on the big white pane on the right hand side > point at New > click string value
- Name it ?InstallFolder? (without the quotation marks)
- Find wherever you put the main folder, which contains files like data.dll, EFLC.exe, etc.., and copy the location.
- Edit the InstallFolder string value, ? Right-Click ?InstallFolder? click modify, and set to the location you just copied

C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City

You dont need to change the .reg file in the crack then, and then just follow these exact instructions, also make sure the contents of EFLC is in the location above and not in the EFLC folder.


Alright I got this working perfectly on W7 x64

This is how you do:

1.Download this torrent (ofc.)
2. Download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5497507/GTA_IV__Episodes_From_Liberty_City_Crack___.Reg (If it shows that it's a virus I recommend that you should uninstall your AV because it sucks)
3. extract The game into C:\program files\rockstar games\
4. extract the crack into the EFLC folder. double click the EFLCINSTALL.reg file and apply.
5. open up regedit and locate HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

AND (If you're using x64 I think)

HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now you should make new strings in the wow6432 folder. Give them the same name and value as the ones in HKEY_LOAD_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ROCKSTAR GAMES\EFLC

now to InstallFolder key you should type in the location of the game.. e.g. ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - Episodes From Liberty City\EFLC""
5. Install games for windows - live program
6. Start the game with LaunchEFLC
P.S. It doesn't have to be this torrent I have downloaded it from a private tracker because speed here is horrible. "
,fenque,2010-07-07T05:46Z,"I fixed the BLACK SCREEN PROBLEM... thanks to REVAN from RLSLOG.net

Here's what worked for me:

For everyone having a ?black screen? problem,you used registry fix,and you most likely have 64bit os,registry fix assumes you installed the game in default dir. (c:\program files?)you have to go to regedit,find value:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Rockstar Games\EFLC
and enter the gamedir manually.

That's it, no more blackscreen. It works."

I drop my graphics to the absolute lowest but the problem persist. Im not very knowledgeable when it comes most things especially computers, I have just built what I thought was quite a good computer. Does anyone have any solutions to this problem or is my computer simply not good enough? Would be very grateful for a reply Thank You.... MY spec :

@JJOEDAKOH first of all, you'll need to install winrar. google it. Than you open folder where you've downloaded the game, inside there will be many files but click on any file, it doesn't matter. When you open that file(any file) you will see folder called ""Grand Theft Auto IV Episodes From Liberty City"" click on that folder and hold ""Alt"" and pres ""E"" than you select where you want to extract it. It will take about 10 mins to extract, so be patient. If you get ""Full disk"" message, chose different location. If that doesn't help, than you'll have to delete something from your computer. When have extracted the game, follow the directions that i gave to Vinci07. Hope this helps."
