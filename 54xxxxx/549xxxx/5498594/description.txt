Live From Daryl's House marks longtime member T-Bone Wolk's last performance with band at Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival

The 29th edition of Live From Daryl's House is a bittersweet affair as it marks the final live performance by Daryl Hall and John Oates with their longtime musical director T-Bone Wolk, who passed away on Feb. 27 from a heart attack at the age of 58. The show, which took place Jan. 30, climaxed the week-long Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival in Montego Bay, with special guests including reggae legend Maxi Priest and R&B star Billy Ocean. This show, featuring seven of the songs from their festival set, includes the Hall & Oates classics "Maneater," "Say It Isn't So," "One on One," and covers of "Love TKO" and Billy Ocean's "Carribean Queen."

T-Bone Wolk was the co-producer/musical director and bassist/guitarist for Daryl Hall and John Oates for nearly 30 years, starting with their 1981 album, Private Eyes. He was also the co-producer for many H&O albums, as well as Daryl Hall solo albums. The next installment of Live From Daryl's House, marking a milestone 30th episode in the series, will be a musical tribute to his memory.
