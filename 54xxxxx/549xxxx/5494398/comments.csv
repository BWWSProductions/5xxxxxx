Dylan is the youngest of four children born to singer-songwriter Bob Dylan and ex-wife Sara Dylan. He married his childhood sweetheart, Nicole Paige Denny (now former actress Paige Dylan), in a ceremony at Sara Dylan's house in 1992. Dylan and his family reside in Los Angeles; they have four sons. Dylan is very private about his family to the extent that there are very few images of his children or wife available."
