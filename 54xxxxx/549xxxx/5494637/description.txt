Release Notes:

Critically acclaimed London-based Unkle announces the release of their
fourth-proper full-length record Ð£Where Did The Night Fall on their
label Surrender All on May 10th.

The album will feature fourteen tracks recorded over the last year at
various locations around the world including the bandÐ¢s Surrender
Sounds studio in London, Ibiza, Melbourne and Los Angeles.

The album has influences from psychedelic rock to afrobeat and employs
live drums, strings and percussion from The Heritage Orchestra. All
this, coupled with UnkleÐ¢s trademark electronica is expertly woven and
layered to build rich sound-scapes. Where Did The Night Fall takes
the listener on another exciting musical journey.

Once again we see Unkle joined by a host of guest vocalists including
gravelly voiced legend Mark Lanegan, formerly of Queens of the Stone
Age and Screaming Trees; San Francisco psych scene darlings Sleepy Sun;
Texan based drone rockers The Black Angels; and Katrina Ford of cabaret
punk trio Celebration and long time TV On The Radio collaborator.

Also returning to the fold are tracks with Joel Cadbury, former South
frontman; Gavin Clark, former Clayhill frontman; ELLE J of dark
folk-rock group Dark Horses; and, Los Angeles based art noise-pop trio
Autolux.

Unkle Live toured the world in 2007 and 2008 and will return to the
stage in 2010 starting with select shows. Live show details, ticket
information and more tour dates coming soon.
