[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-19T06:56Z,"Recently, when trying to update avast, the license was expired. Here's what fixed the problem:  

1. Drag the license file out of (you may need to disable avast! self-defense module first):
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users.WINDOWS\Application Data\Alwil Software\Avast5\license

2. Run the patch again, and reboot the computer.

3. Run avast, and insert the license.


Remember: Update ONLY the engine and virus definitions.Do NOT update the program updates. 
To disable Update Program: At avast Settings-> Updates-> PROGRAM: Select ""Manual update""."
,lain.ph,2010-04-20T09:53Z,"been waiting for this.:D thanks robbinghood. installed today and running smoothly. 

can you crack keylemon? thanks."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-20T19:20Z,"KeyLemon 2.2? Maybe later, cause right now I'm busy unless it's something really hot."
,lain.ph,2010-04-21T14:09Z,"ok sir robbinghood. 

anyway, these crack really works. still my avast has 30days. Thanks."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-21T18:34Z,The problem with the license being expired probably was caused by some of my reg cleaners. Since it's been fixed it's working ok again.
,milkman69,2010-04-22T08:12Z,"Thanks RH. Followed instructions and all is well, great torrent!
One question though, is the Internet security part installed automatically? after installing Pro AV I tried to install the IS as well but it just gave me the option to uninstall?"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-22T22:08Z,"@milkman69

Just install or avast AV Pro (without firewall) or avast IS (incl. firewall). "
,beckinsale_95,2010-04-23T00:30Z,Hi. How long until the software expires? Thanks
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-26T00:24Z,"@beckinsale_95

The license will be showing 30 days left till 6-4-2015. By then people won't be using this anymore, unless they like old things."
,lain.ph,2010-04-26T16:59Z,hi again robbinghood. please make a crack of keylemon 2.2. my sister is asking for it badly. thanks.
,zippy1990,2010-04-26T19:12Z,"Works great thanks !


Anyways robbinghood...

is there any difference between the full version of IS or trial version?  Cus if it gives some extra features i would like to have the license file ^^"
,milkman69,2010-04-27T07:47Z,"@RH

I see now, thanks"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-27T20:03Z,"@zippy1990 

There's no difference between a trial license or normal license, except for the fact that avast says it's a trial license."
,FrLuke,2010-04-29T12:49Z,Works. Mucho thanks!
,SweRaider,2010-04-29T13:41Z,"oh it will stay on 30 days all the time, great, thank you sir"
,Shiejay,2010-05-01T09:44Z,"stupid this work perfect! thx...


finally may Avast will update."
,hunnicuddler,2010-05-01T23:13Z,"It didn't work for me.. it just kept freezing and crashing. I did a restore and tried again and it crashed again.. I don't know if the problem is with Avast IS or the patch, but I'm sticking to KIS until I find an Avast IS that works."
,hunnicuddler,2010-05-01T23:21Z, - before anyone jumps down my throat or call me a noob.. This is very unusual for any of RH stuff to act like this. 
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-02T00:27Z,"@hunnicuddler 

Trolls usually just report a problem, don't provide any useful info, and are not interested in a possible solution. So you're considered as a troll, not as a n00b.

BTW: I know lots of reliable users who will provide the correct info (if there are problems), and you're not considered as one of them."
,Fazren,2010-05-03T21:03Z,"thanks. it works perfectly. (:
one question, it gives two. which is one an antivirus and another internet security.

do i can only choose one to install to or can i install both ?

thanks. (:"
,loonymus,2010-05-04T10:21Z,hi before i say anything thanks for the download its extremely helpful and i rely appreciate it. but im a little confused about the whole download a trial license thing do you mean i have to register? if not how do i download a trial license? also after 30 days will the software expire or will it continue to update after 30 days reguardless thanks agen robin hood your doin a service to society m8
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-04T19:32Z,"@Fazren 

The same question is already asked by ""milkman69"" and been answered. Also as described at the torrent description and included Readme.txt file the only difference is that avast Internet Security has a firewall. So depending on what you want just install or avast AV Pro (without firewall) or avast IS (incl. firewall). "
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-04T19:36Z,"@oonymus

For you also the same: Everything is already described at the torrent description, incl. Readme.txt file, or asked here. First run the patch, then download a trial license through avast. The license will be showing 30 days left till 6-4-2015.

It's all a matter of reading."
,RomeoMaestro,2010-05-04T22:56Z,"Great. It's puched well. There's only question I didn't get reading read me file ""Run avast, and download a trial license""? Where is that license?
 It says Valid till 06/04/2015 but also says will expire in 30 days."
,xxLYNCHxx,2010-05-05T08:42Z,Where do I download a Trial License from?

Everything people need to know about this torrent is described at the torrent descriptions and 
included Readme.txt files. Please learn to read torrent descriptions and included Readme.txt files,
and take your time to try to understand them. Also the same questions have already been answered 
here, so I'm not gonna answer them again and again, even if I get a hamburger. If you don't understand 
the notes then you ought to be playing with toys instead of playing the pirate.

Now does someone has a hamburger for me?"

,WLogan,2010-05-07T04:19Z,"Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to upload this. You said where to download the Trial License question has been answered, I see no answer. There is also nothing in the readme.txt's that talk about where to download the trial license. "
,WLogan,2010-05-07T04:29Z,"Can't edit comment 
-------

Where in Avast is the option to download this trial license? I don't understand, sorry. "
,bookishchick,2010-05-07T11:21Z,"I'm lost too WLogan, and I usually pretty good at installing this kind of stuff. I feel pretty stupid. All I keep getting is ""error check connection and proxy""...or something when I try to get the license.

I read install instructions over and over--'cause I have that kind of time."
,hitec1691,2010-05-07T14:12Z,@WLogan after installing the s/w as instructed to run in trial mode u have to open avast pro then click on maintenance tab and in there subscription tab. Then u will see trial mode option just click on it and it will start. :)
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-08T16:05Z,"@WLogan
@bookishchick

Step 5 from the installation notes: ""5. Run avast, and download a trial license."".

Why would the note say to run avast? Because then it's clear that the license can be downloaded through avast.

Also I've already posted a comment here to explain, so always read comments too in case you don't understand something, cause it may help.
