"The sound of Midnight Movies conjures a certain Los Angeles - but it's no sun-drenched, glamorized metropolis. This is a decidedly noir L.A., replete with mystery, desire and yearning. On Lion the Girl  (New Line), their second full-length release, the band explores haunting new vistas and back alleys of the soul, expanding the reach of their acclaimed "psychedelic pop" with an expanded lineup and more expansive songwriting.

Gena Olivier's elegant, beguiling vocals and Larry Schemel's buzzingly urgent guitar lines are, as ever, prominent sonic elements. But two new members, bassist Ryan Wood and drummer Sandra Vu, add considerably to the outfit's musical reach."
