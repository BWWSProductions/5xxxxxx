They must've skipped ep01 because it aired in December and ep02 didn't air until February.  So when it says ep5 it's actually ep6; ep7 is ep8 and so on.  If you get confused when downloading, I would recommending going to wikipedia and looking at the episode guide there to figure out which one is which (they have short descriptions) because for whatever reason imdb doesn't even have all of the episodes up yet and there's no descriptions available.
