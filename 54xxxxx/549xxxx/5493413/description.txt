Background:
----------------------------

The band consists of Dallas Good (also of Phono-Comb), Travis Good, Sean Dean, and Mike Belitsky. Dallas and Travis Good are the sons of Bruce Good, a member of the Canadian country group The Good Brothers.

In addition to their own recordings, the Sadies often collaborate with other country-rock artists, such as Blue Rodeo, Jon Langford, The Tragically Hip, The Deep Dark Woods, Andre Williams (on the 1999 country-influenced Red Dirt), and are the preferred live backing band of singer Neko Case. The Sadies are also featured in Adult Swim's 12 oz. mouse. An instrumental performed by the band can be heard in episode 5 of season 1, during a scene in which Rhoda the bartender is murdered.

The members of the Sadies have also participated, with Greg Keelor and Rick White, in the supergroup The Unintended.
