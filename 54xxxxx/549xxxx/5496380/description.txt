b]Here is another 7 release, this time inspired by the ASUS ROG Motherboard Series.[/b]


This release has been modded by keeping in mind a "standard default configuration". 
The goal was to obtain a fresh installed OS with all the settings in the right place 
by default, rather than going manually through all the adjustments one by one. 
When you format and install a new OS you waste a lot of time, (setting up windows,
registry setting, icons etc...)
I used Windows 7 Professional as a base version for this release, simply because
7 Professional comes without backup and bit locker features.
Dism has been used to integrate updates and removing useless packages like 
"The upgrading version option" (the annoying entry in the control panel that bothers you 
to update to the ultimate version), Country packages and others...

[b]You will have two installation choices:[/b]

1- "Windows 7 ROG" with full multimedia supports, (Suggested for every day use)


2-"Windows 7 ROG N" with No multimedia. (no Mediacenter, no MediaPlayer, No IE8, no DVD maker.) Keep in mind that the rating system will not be working in this version. This because the "N" has no multimedia support. To have it working you have to install the mediapack from Microsoft. This will reinstall all the packages above and fix the rating issue. (If you ask me, that is a bug that Microsoft should be fix.)
