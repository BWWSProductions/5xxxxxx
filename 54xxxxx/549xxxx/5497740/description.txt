Fresh from the international success of its spin-off 
movie In the Loop, the brutal but brilliant 
The Thick of It is back. Packed with political 
double dealing and sharp satire, Armando Iannucci's 
universally acclaimed series has won a host of awards 
including the comedy award at The South Bank Show Awards, 
2 Royal Television Society Awards, 2 Baftas and a 
National Television Award.

In an attempt to look like he's doing something, the 
Prime Minister decides to reshuffle his cabinet. But 
no-one with any sense wants to join the Prime Minister 
on the bridge as the ship appears to be going down. So 
his chief enforcer Malcolm Tucker is having a hard job 
finding ministers prepared to volunteer for suicide watch 
in the run up to the general election. Enter Nicola Murray 
MP: a woman so far down the list that Malcolm doesn't even 
have a file on her but who can be flattered and bullied into 
accepting the Cabinet post that no-one wants: Secretary of 
State for Social Affairs and Citizenship.

Nicola's got plenty of ideas though: the Social Mobility 
Agenda, the Fourth Sector (whatever that is), but ideas 
cost money and in the current climate that means trouble. 
This series follows Nicola and her used-up team of advisors 
as they struggle to achieve anything at all under Malcolm's 
watchful eye. With Nicola's opposite number Peter Mannion 
and his team circling, they finally sense victory is within 
their grasp, even if they aren't too sure what to do with 
it when they get it.

Being in power is a good thing, right?
