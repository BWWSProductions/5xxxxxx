Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures S01E08: Complications

Ming finally realizes her dream of motherhood, though the donor plans she and Chen made with Fitz don't turn out exactly as planned. In the process, Fitz learns to recognize his ability to love and be loved and Chen feels confident enough to pursue his writing aspirations.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion.
