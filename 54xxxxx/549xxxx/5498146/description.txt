==============

John Perkins was a prominent member of the top-secret team of "economic hit men",
 who used fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion, sex,
 military coups and murder to create the global American empire after World War II.
 After a long internal struggle between his guilt and the fear of telling the truth,
 Perkins meets the daughter of an assassinated president and speaks out in front of
 an angry Latin-American audience
Based on rare propagandistic material, film-noir style reconstructed sequences and
 exclusive filmed confessions of best selling author John Perkins ("Confessions of
 an Economic Hit Man", "The Secret History of the American Empire") this fascinating
 documentary sheds light on the unknown mechanisms used by the rulers of the modern
 world, the roots of Islamic terrorism, and the reason why most of the world's
 population lives in poverty. The definitive answer to President Bush's question
 "why do they hate us?"

================

Aka Confessions Of An Economic Hitman. 

IMDB list it as a 2007 production, but its actually 2008.
Unfortunately the RETAIL DVD has hardcored Greek subs, but the movie language is English.
 
Also you may notice that in some parts of the movie, it may look like its uncropped on 
the left/right side, its because of some of the videos the director used, so if we cropped more, we'd cut a lot of picture from the main movie
