[V],Kuthumi,2010-04-25T21:21Z,"Thank you for this rare title! I am old enough to have seen this film in 70 mm super widescreen in a movie theatre, with 6-track stereo sound. It's a pity it now only be found on vhs fullscreen with mono. The only interest for people today would be to see if it really was ""as bad as they say"".

As a Norwegian, I must admit that I am ashamed of this movie, and we can only blame American director Andrew L. Stone for having so little reverence for our beloved composer. The real Edvard Grieg was only 1.52 meters (5 feet) tall. He had to sit on a book to reach the piano, and his back was deformed from tuberculosis. So he was hardly material for the hero of a musical, dancing up and down mountains and walls!

P.S.: You should edit this presentation and add tag 'norsk film' so that it can be found at

Please avoid codec h264, as it is not accepted by most standalone players.

You quite surely are a Norwegian, and IÂ´m much interested in seein some more flexnes (not sure if I spell it right, that old norwegian comedy stuff anyway). Have they released them on dvd with some subs (eng or fin)?"
