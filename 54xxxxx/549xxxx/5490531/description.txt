I bought this album shortly after it was released, and played it regularly for plenty of years.  Recently, my copy disappeared, so I started searching the internet for torrents of it.  When I couldn't find any, I bought another copy and decided to share it with the world.

If you are a Rush fan, you must listen to this.  These covers are covers in the truest sense of the word: they are songs remade in the style of the covering artist.  Instead of regurgitating the same stuff, these (unknown) groups brand the classic songs with their own artistry, and most of them do it well.

Whether you're a metalhead or not, I think you'll enjoy this.  If you do like this, please buy it.
