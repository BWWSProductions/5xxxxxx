BBC Wonders of the Solar System 2of5 1080i HDTV h264 AC3

Wonders of the Solar System
Professor Brian Cox visits some of the most stunning locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature have carved natural wonders across the solar system.

Part 2: Order out of Chaos
Brian reveals how beauty and order in Earth's cosmic backyard was formed from nothing more than a chaotic cloud of gas. Chasing tornados in Oklahoma, he explains how the same physics that creates these spinning storms shaped the young solar system. Out of this celestial maelstrom emerged the jewel in the crown, Brian's second wonder - the magnficent rings of Saturn. On an ice-choked lagoon in Iceland, he sees the nearest thing on Earth to Saturn's rings. Using the latest scientific imagery and breathtaking graphics, he explains how the intricate patterns round Saturn is shaped by the cluster of more than 60 moons surrounding the planet. One of those moons makes a spectacular contribution to the rings and is the third wonder of the solar system. Brian describes the astonishing discovery of giant fountains of ice erupting from the surface of Enceladus, which soar thousands of kilometres into space.

This is the original 1080 PAFF TS file wrapped inside a MKV container.
You'll also find the PDTV Xvid and 720p HDTV versions at MVGroup.
These have been tested with VLC v1.0.5 and MPC-HC 1.3.1301.0 and FFDShow and Haali.
If you use FFDShow make sure you use the ffmpeg-mt h264 codec, not the default libavcodec codec.
If you use FFDShow libavcodec codec then one processor thread runs at 100%, the other runs at 0% causing jerky video.
The ffmpeg-mt h264 codec balances out the CPU thread usage.
