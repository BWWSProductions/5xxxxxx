Kazuki, Taishi, and all their crazy cohorts are back and getting into all kinds of misadventures. Manga and madness abound as these college students navigate the otaku subculture of doujinshi.

Life is a joke for this crew, but not every day can be a Comic Party. A break in the laughter spells trouble, and this gang of chuckle-heads passes the time with some hot springs action, a whacked out tennis tournament, and a camping trip that ends in a deadly duel!

It's a good thing these manga-maniacs can depend on each other when things go from ridiculous to totally absurd!
