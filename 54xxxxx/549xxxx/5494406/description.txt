			Torrent is downloaded from someone! 
			We don't do commercials for anyone. 

		
		We make movies and music from different sources. 
		Complete sets of DVD's with menus and multiple subtitles. 
		Just give us a proper MPEG and we finalize it.
		Music collections with mixed music from 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. 
		We also make complete discographics for certain artists and groups. 
		We are translating subtitles from English and Greek to Swedish. 

		We don't rip DVD's, we make them.
		Always original full uncompressed movies.
		If you like the movie you borrow, buy it. Also, if you 
		buy a movie without Swedish subtitles we can translate 
		for you and include them. If it's possible we also include 
		Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish and Greek subtitles. 

		If you want you can say "Thank You" it will 
		be highly praised. But the choise is yours.
