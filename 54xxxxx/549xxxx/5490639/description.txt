Publisher: Praeger 2007 | 208 Pages | ISBN: 0275999203 | PDF | 3 MB



â€œHall and Bishop have created a work that addresses much broader concerns than whether eight-year-old girls should dress like adult women in equally adult industries. 

The pieces they have selected discuss the increasing sexualization of culture in the US from different angles, including the marketing of sexy dresses, the proliferation of reality television, and the problem of library Internet access to porn.

Offers a detailed and thoughtful examination of the porn industry's profound effect upon Americans and American culture.
