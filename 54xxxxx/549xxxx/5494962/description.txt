The band formed under the name Beowulf. Early on, the members wore full-face silver masks onstage and in promo shoots. Following the release of the debut album these were toned down to smaller half-face masks and were abandoned altogther after the touring for "Transcendence." Ben Jackson and Dana Burnell both quit Crimson Glory at this point, heralding a shift in the band's direction to a more commercial hard rock sound.

Midnight quit the band following the release of "Strange and Beautiful" and after the rest of the band completed their tour dates with David Van Lending on vocals they split up. A brief reunion with Wade Black on vocals came and went in the late 90s to early 2000s before they split up again. Jon Drenning and Jeff Lords went on to form Crush and Erotic Liquid Culture.

The 'classic' line-up agreed a reunion near the end of 2005 - former touring drummer Jesse Rojas was also re-hired to provide additional percussion and vocals onstage. Midnight, however, was replaced by Wade Black for the second time at the beginning of 2007 following substance abuse problems that led to him being arrested for drunk driving (with a suspended license, no less). A new album called ''Metatron, Lucifer and the Divine Chaos'' had been planned but this was shelved after the collapse of Black Lotus records.

Midnight died at the age of 47 in July 2009.
