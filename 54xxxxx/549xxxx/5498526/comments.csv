[T],artpepper,2010-04-16T13:43Z,"I's not about hating America: it's about the ability to distinguish between truth and romantic fiction. The 'history' that most US high-school students get is that which has been authorised by the rich and the powerful. 

Zinn wrote a corrective. If you find that some historical truths are too ugly for your delicate sensibilities, stick to fucking Disneyworld...OK?"

Thanks for the upload.  Obviously some here need a bit of education."
,hielo999,2010-04-17T13:49Z,"But Zinn admitted before his death to 'dramatizing' his work, to make it more consumable by the American people.

I like my history, well, truthful, not dramatized, thanks."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-17T22:28Z,"Historians are storytellers. I take it you've never read Edward Gibbon or the Durant's or Toynbee or Prescott? All good historians 'dramatise' otherwise what you get is a dry recitation of the 'facts' (already nebulous things). 

I suppose you think Xenophon and Herodotus were just telling it straight? Frankly, you're clutching at straws, pal..."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-17T23:20Z,"What I meant  by 'you're clutching at straws...' is that your frantic back-pedaling fools nobody. 

As your first comment makes clear, your real problem with Zinn is that he was a Leftie, Pinko , subversive, yadyadaya (fill in your own Bill O'Reilly/Hannity dimwit blather). 

You don't give a shit about historical truth, only 'truth' that suits your agenda: so grow a pair and say so. 

Anyway, don''t you have a Teabag Party to get to? Say hi to Lear Jet Sarah for me, willya?
