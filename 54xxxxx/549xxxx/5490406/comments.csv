Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John wrote the four gospels, comtemporary to Jesus Christ, Peter wrote about Jesus Christ and was crucified with his head down, for his love of Jesus Christ and of the Truth... John passed great part of his life in prison... Just to mentiom two...So they didn't win no million dollars... "
[T],Valdo__PT,2010-04-13T00:46Z,"For you it may be a fictional story, just make a search and you will see all around modern civilization proves the existence of Jesus Christ... even the calendar as Jesus Christ birthday as reference... The mos important Man in the history of Mankind... 
If you don't believe in Jesus Christ being the Son of God or you don't believe in God, I don't care at all... 
Well a good person is a good person, and God is much Better and Just Judge than me or any other person, so each will be judged in relation to the person's own heart and own actions, even if he or she lived in a  time before  Christianity...  Abraham, Moses, King David and others were men of God before Christianity..."
[T],Valdo__PT,2010-04-16T03:00Z,"The important thing is from whom's birthday does the calender refers too? Who is the most important Man in the History of Mankind? 
Well by your line of thought Hitler and all the assassins and rotten people in the history of Mankind should have a place in Paradise...
God will give to each according to his or her deeds... if that is not a description of Justice I thing that there is no other... The Angel Michael (Jesus Christ) is described in the Apocalipse as being Justice not as being blind kindness..."
[T],Valdo__PT,2010-04-16T03:03Z,...refers to*
[T],Valdo__PT,2010-04-24T01:50Z,If I would be talking about Hitler I would say the worse rotten rat in the History of mankind...

,jessepb,2010-08-21T12:35Z,"Why do atheists seem utterly unable to grasp the usefulness of evidence and data when it comes to determining the truth? No serious scholar of classical antiquity gives credence to the idea that Jesus (Yeshua to those who knew him) was not a real historical figure. What, do you people believe that claiming to be specially chosen of God is somehow proof positive one doesn't exist? 
That's beyond irrational -- that's ridiculous.
Try keeping your public declarations of ""fact"" from displaying complete ignorance and an utter disregard for the concepts of accuracy and truth, and you'll at least avoid embarassing yourself and your cause."
,jessepb,2010-08-21T12:36Z,p.s. I'm not a Christian; I'm a classical historian. Agnostic.
