,893kira,2010-05-08T16:14Z,"Lol for the graphics issue just use your own desktop 
resolution and just configure in your video options set low some of the useless stuff you think you really don't need.

Yeah agreed Warband really sucks compare to his previous Mount Blade like some bugs, and the new combat mechanism is too confusing ( as for this problem just set auto in blocking and attacking)

The most i hate in warband are when you are in a horse and your are using your bow you don't immediately see your cross hair and they remove the best combat mechanic in Mount and blade when you are riding the horse in a lance or a spear even you don't attack you can still damage your enemies meaning the crouch damage."
