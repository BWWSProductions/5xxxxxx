,Dansk101,2010-07-01T18:31Z,"@asdddasder
I have had the same problem. Metal Slug 1 to 5 is running super fast and I can't play them! But Metal Slug 6 is fine... Help please!"
,sabasNL,2010-08-01T13:43Z,"For all those who have problems:

1. Crack is propably on the ISO or in the installation folder, in a folder named ''Crack'' or ''RELOADED''

2. Try running in XP mode, 2000 mode, etc. If you do this, the whole saga should be playable. Just try wich mode works the best for that chapter.

Just remember those 2 steps for all (older) games you download and you will be fine."
