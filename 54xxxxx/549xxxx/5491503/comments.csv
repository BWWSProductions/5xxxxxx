[V],r3dcat,2010-04-14T06:28Z,@klowne420: If you want to load .wbfs files directly from FAT32/NTFS partition/hard drive then I recommend using Configurable USB Loader (http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=147638)
,klowne420,2010-04-14T23:12Z,Thanks r3dcat
,klowne420,2010-04-14T23:20Z,sorry one more question were do i put the files i DL that that loader and cant seem to figure out were to put the file
[V],r3dcat,2010-04-15T03:48Z,"@klowne420: Just create a folder called ""WBFS"" on your drive/partition and copy/transfer the torrent download ""folder & contents"" into it ... in this case ... eg. X:\WBFS\Drawn to Life- The Next Chapter [R9DP78]"
