        1 JANUARY  1943: The  internees adjust  to life  in their  new
        camp, where things are radically different and seemingly  much
        more luxurious than the last one, but soon realise that luxury
        always has its price. The  leader of the women there  is Verna
        Johnson, who's  a scheming  collaborator in  league with  Miss
        Hasan, interpreter to the  Commandant, Lt Nakamura. No  sooner
        have they  arrived at  the camp  than Christina  is taken away
        from her friends and sent  to another camp on a  lorry. Marion
        is reunited with an  old school friend, Lillian  Cartland, and
        her little boy Bobby. Bea  finds she must defer to  the camp's
        medic, Dr Natalie Trier. Kate conceals the fact she is a nurse
        and Sally's attitude to life deteriorates rapidly.

Proper Notes:

FTP used stereo for Mono: On Part 1 bad Resolution of 368 x 272
Honestly why do they use so many diff resolutions in 1 series?

368 x 272 - 512 x 384 - 528 x 400 - 560 x 416 - 544 x 416 - 464 x 352

Oh well enjoy the Propers
