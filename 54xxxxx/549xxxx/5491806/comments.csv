,antoinetteb41,2010-04-12T17:31Z,this movie is not Avatar but the Bounty Hunter with 5.1 448kbps
,goblindown,2010-04-12T17:40Z,Nope It's Avatar. Don't mislead people.
,antoinetteb41,2010-04-12T18:03Z,"yes you are right in the pre you have the bounty hunter
but it s original retail?"
,goblindown,2010-04-12T19:31Z,"Yes It's original retail, It has the name of the guys who did the turkish dub in the credits(name of the studies they worked with etc), if it werent retail, there wouldnt be something like that.
"
,cinesimon,2010-04-12T20:15Z,"This may well be retail - it's the best release out yet via BTs that I've seen - but it's been ripped pretty badly. It' not hard to see the pixels.
But the audio's great!
For those not watching on a projector, this would be just fine."
,goblindown,2010-04-12T20:44Z,"I agree, it has not the best video quality but pretty acceptable. As movie is about three hours long it surely is difficult to fit in DVD5. I hope they will be better on DVD9's"
,cinesimon,2010-04-12T20:53Z,Also 3 audio tracks don't help...
,goblindown,2010-04-12T21:36Z,And Yep they've released it finally.
,weaping_reaper,2010-04-12T23:02Z,this is the best version out right now.. wont get any better than this till Blu-ray
,cinesimon,2010-04-12T23:37Z,"Eh? There most certainly will be a better quality copy that isn't a Bluray rip: this has been compressed 25% more than it needed to - it's very pixelated. With one language only(there are 3 on this), there would've been be an extra GIG for the video(1/3 more than there is now), therefore the pixel issues would  not exist.
Again: proper rip of a retail DVD will be the next best thing - not Bluray.
To say you'll only get better from a Bluray is misleading - especially to those without Bluray. Guys if your broadband is expensive and you want nearer to DVD quality, I suggest you wait for a better retail rip.
This is fine on an old/small TV - but the pixels are obvious on anything larger than a 20 inch TV.
The audio is very good though.

Thanks to the uploader - I really do appreciate your efforts. Don't take my comments to be a criticism of your outstanding efforts: I just think it important folk know what they're getting."
,cinesimon,2010-04-13T00:10Z,"Hi again Goblindown: hey can I ask if the film 'Arabesk' that you have uploaded is an English dub, or is in Turkish with English subtitles? 

Alkso re Avatar: if it's been released where you are, I wonder if you have access to an orgonal retail copy - with which using the likes of DVDshrink, you could take out the other languages, and fill the DVD up with the film with minimal compression? I'm sure doing so would lead to a great copy.
I only suggest this as it's not available anywhere else for another 10 days! The good karma would fall upon you like torrential rainfall!"
,goblindown,2010-04-13T00:20Z,"There will be better releases than that. I totally agree with you cinesimon it gets pixelated on bigger screens. It wont be easy to spot on crt tv's but on lcd's especially on, that are larger than 20-22 inches, it might not be what you expected but still fair enough.  And I didnt take it as criticism because what you say is what should people know."
,goblindown,2010-04-13T00:26Z,"Unfortunately it's in Turkish without any subs. I wish it had subtitles in other languages. it's hilariously funny. I hope some day someone prepares subtitle for it.

And I dont have acces to original copy now unfortunately If I had I would do what you mentioned. I would remove other languages. But I will get DVD9 version tomorrow so I can remove other languages, just leave english and I will try to minimize the compression as much as possible."
,cinesimon,2010-04-13T00:28Z,"My spiel was in response to the 'weaping_reaper' who said ""wont get any better than this till Blu-ray "" - nothing really to do with my expectations, I just wanted people who pay for internet by the mB that he's wrong and they can wait another couple days for close-to-DVD quality. 
Until a 'scene' is released, I have no expectations - I think all you guys are amazing for doing what you do.

So did you figure out the language of that film?"
,cinesimon,2010-04-13T00:31Z,"Hey good on ya man - you rock!
Personally I have no problem with downloading uncompressed DVD9 torrents - especially a film such as this.  Blank DVD9s are quite cheap now: I think per unit I pay US$2 or a bit less for a good quality brand - in bulk of course."
,Denny33142,2010-04-13T04:46Z,"If you could upload the DVD9 tommorow i think alot of ppl would appreciate it, you would be the first to upload a DVDR version.

Also if its not too much trouble i would really appreciate if you could leave the spanish subs intact, i do not think subs take much space anyway."
,goblindown,2010-04-13T06:46Z,"DVD9 is ready, will be here soon.
Video quality is awesome. You will love it."
,cinesimon,2010-04-13T08:08Z,"Wow man - can't wait! Though I love to share, and will certainly seed at my kinda measly but kinda OK 125 Kbps after getting it, I really hope it's initially not swamped! "
,carlost1960,2010-04-13T12:51Z,superb copy 
,goblindown,2010-04-14T00:19Z,DVD9 has been added.
