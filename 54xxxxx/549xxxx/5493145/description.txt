Plot
Each episode was set in a unsuccessful pub in London's East End, having a different name every episode. The pub is run by brothers, the nervous Barry and the idiotic Garry. The only regular of the pub is Dodgy Phil. Every episode revolves around one of Dodgy Phil's plans to improve the pub, a plan which Barry always has doubts about. The doubts are often confirmed due to the pub's destruction at the end of every episode. One of the running jokes in the series is that, as the pub is next to a zoo, unusual animals are often found inside it.
