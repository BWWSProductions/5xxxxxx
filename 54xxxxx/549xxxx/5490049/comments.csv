,some-young-guy,2010-09-28T16:13Z,"Can this be accessed by aircrack in Backtrack 4?  I'm new to auditing, especially on a WPA/WPA2.  I have a boot CD and a boot thumb drive and would like to mount this on my drive for use with BT4.  Can that be done?"
,base3,2011-04-11T11:10Z,"It's not a CD image, but a zipfile. The zipfile contains lists of passwords in plain text format. As long as aircrack/John the Ripper/Crack/etc can access the textfiles as input, it can use the dictionaries."

,xjd77,2011-11-29T03:40Z,I'm a newbie when it comes to hacking and cracking. Recently downloaded BackTrack 5 (the recommended and ultimate hacking OS). Took a couple of weeks to get familiar with Backtrack but it was worth it. The password lists here are geared for Backtrack and the Aircrack suite (included in Backtrack). So if you fancy a go at hacking and cracking then forget Windows. Just download Backtrack 5 (search TPB) and these lists and use a suitable network card or usb network adapter (mines a cheap Belkin F5D8053 N Wireless USB adapter with the Ralink RT2870 chipset). Make sure you buy a wireless card or adapter with the right chipset for hacking (Google to check). Took me two weeks to hack a connection but then I was spending 12 hours a day doing it. Backtrack is the supreme hacking OS. Go for it!

,xjd77,2011-12-05T05:59Z,lol! those comments I made above have been playing on my mind. Look I'm going to level with you. I managed to hack a few connections but after a few weeks I thought about it. I've got my own connection so I don't really need to hijack my neighbours. If I want to file-share then that's my choice and I don't have have the right to use someone else's connection to do it. I'd still recommend having a go but once you've done it I guess it's your choice what you do afterwards. I still think Backtrack 5 is awesome. Peace and let's keep fighting for a free and open internet.
