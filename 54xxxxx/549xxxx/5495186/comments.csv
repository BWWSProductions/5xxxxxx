[V],twentyforty,2010-04-14T09:04Z,"@lover & hkkoradi & Stev & 
sherynoshka:

Good morning people! Thank you and enjoy new episode.

@honeybunny: So, best site for subs is back on-line. I'll start to pack subs for 720p in my torrents again. Some people need that badly. Thank you.

@hopparty: Yes, I could and I would, after the schedule. I am on a verge to stop doing [quark] because yesterday's ""24"" quark was downloaded 471 times and torrent has - 7 seeders! I have ratio just on that one 86!!! It's redicolous... And sad."

[V],twentyforty,2010-04-14T13:09Z,"@sanyam: Strange, because I haven't stopped to seed after your inquiry about TRGS. And I know for the fact that Jon never stopped to seed. I have no peers since yesterday, if we talkin' 'bout same torrent (Craig with Nayyar and Ricky). Obviously you cannot connect, not just to me but to others too. Are you on your work-place, some university or gov. address, because PeerBlock (and Jon and myself run one) block all such addresses?
I've said you on Saturday what to do. Call me."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-14T13:31Z,@yinzer: Thank you.
,akskok,2010-04-14T14:12Z,Thank you 20-40 ! 
,jjabrams,2010-04-14T16:46Z,"hey 20/40 if your ratio on those quark files are something ridiculous like 86, then maybe you should just seed but only until like ratio of 10 and then stop. If other people dont want to help you seed it - its their loss. If you're on a slow connection then you cant be downloading that fast anyways?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-14T17:22Z,"@jjabrams: What's on people's minds, I have learned hard-way. But, even if that concerns majority, I cannot allow that ugly human intrinsics ruins every single try to help ones who have less money - but it doesn't mean less heart. They (less fortunate people) are often over-voiced by drunken, spoiled punks and oppressed by guys which countries have fast internet infrastructure - but - don't get me wrong - payday always would come. And then we can hear ""Why us? Why me? We are so good, and nice and quiet?""
Rich people have so many only because they are in ""surplus""... but one cannot fuck the whole universe all the time. Everything has an end.

,jjabrams,2010-04-15T01:53Z,"hey 20/40 , I understand your desire to be nice to the unfortunate - Im just saying that if you're on dialup you can upload as fast as download and I dont think there was ever anybody charging for uploads. If their connection is slow then its too nice for you to upload at 300k or whatever, just turn the connection down to a trickle. I remember when I was on dialup I was happy to get anything at all and never complained about download speeds or such.
You could seed only when the seeders drops dangerously low. At least thats how I try to work my seeding of all your stuff :)"

Sound quality tends to suck on these smaller MB copies."
