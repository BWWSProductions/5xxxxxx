I do not encode movies as [micro]. H264 is better for small files. "

Thanks for the encode/upload.

P.S. Would've taken the quark but collecting this series and didn't know what the DVD conversion s/w would do to a quark file.
Will test & fnd out though!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-13T07:33Z,"@Jon: 272p is better choice for conversion. [quark] is here for ""direct viewing"" - more likely ""previewing"" - and in quality not good enough for any conversion. Converted should be bigger files in smaller formats and vice-versa might be disappointment."
,lilars26,2010-04-14T14:40Z,"Thank you 20/40.
Good show."
,jon4fun,2010-04-14T22:19Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for confirming my choice on the type of file for conversion to DVD.


Cheers

@ALL: I cannot believe this show is not in more demand. 
Choice is personal but from a writing and acting point of view this show rocks. Then there is the story, which rocks.

You may think it is too outlandish, an upright respectable man using his skills to provide for his family in an America that is a VERY expensive place to be ill or even to live these days.
I'll remind you of an interview in one a Michael Moore Movie [Roger & Me] http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098213/
He happens across a woman selling live rabbits from her front yard in near-downtown Flint.

Lesson, I got from movie - people will do whatever is neccessary to survive and provide.

BTW, you have to watch Series 1 & 2, you can't just jump in on this one.

Cheers
Jon"
