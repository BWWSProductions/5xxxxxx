The Monkees were a pop rock quartet assembled by Robert "Bob" Rafelson and Bert Schneider in Los Angeles in 1966 for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The members were Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork
and Englishman Davy Jones. (Wiki)

Why two compilations with almost similar track listing? When I listened to these CD's I thought that the sound was quite different for some of the tracks. They're most likely the same recordings, but the reproduction of these CD's make it sounds a little different to my ears. So take your choice and see which one you like best. It is the original recordings.
