I entered the word ""anomaly"" and lo and behold there was a list of derivatives, where it includes ""anomalous.""  The interesting thing about this particular entry was the part of speech listed was NOUN instead of ADJECTIVE for ""anomalous.""  What happens when the mistake isn't quite so blatant and you actually rely on it?  Sheesh!"

,Slangerb,2012-04-22T16:34Z,@gm12345678 Anomalous is an anomaly?  Sounds like the Oxford people have a sense of humor.
