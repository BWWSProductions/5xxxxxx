This is a reproduced torrent of Papakeno's Strange Patterns Collection.


I want to make it abundantly clear that I have not in any form, shape, or way, been involved in the compilation process of these collections - All of the "Blood, sweat and tears" are Papakenos and not mine. If you like the music, then pay your respects to the man here, make a comment. Just say "Thank you, Papakeno" - it's common courtesy to thank for that which is freely given!
Not to mention that a simple "Thank you, Papakeno" will keep the man happy, and  working on these great music compilations for all of us.

For the rest of Papakeno's music (the PapaPop series), check out:

Also check out the ISOTOP collection, created by _Wintermute_ - Very good music in similar style:

SP9 and EP 1&2 are complete with the bonus tracks added 2010.

PS
I work abroad, therefore I will disappear and re-appear at intervals (usually away 6 weeks, home 6 weeks). So if I'm not seeding right now, just be patient, I will return so you can get it downloaded.
