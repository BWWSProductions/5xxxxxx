,witchkid,2010-04-14T14:13Z,"So, how exactly does this thing work? Do we have to pay monthly or anything?
Sorry to be a n00b, but I was just wondering."
[T],Harrharrr,2010-04-14T14:27Z,"Nope, just create a account and start playing. 100% free"
,ionnamun,2010-04-14T18:50Z,"Just remember to use ""Team Reloaded.exe"" to play because of the custom talent patch (makes the 2.4.3 game look like 1.12.1 -> PreTBC)"

,ionnamun,2010-05-18T19:30Z,"RahulZDeadman, first of all read the torrent description, visit the webpage it tells you to go to create your account and well.. READ DUDE!"
,RahulZDeadman,2010-05-23T19:33Z,"Hey Ionnamun... I created an account and updated all the latest patches...But when i login,, it says ""you havent added any game to your account"" and for that u need Unique cd key which we can only get by buying original DVD. So... What Now???"
,ionnamun,2010-05-27T21:54Z,"RahulZDeadman, this is a private server. It is not related to blizzards official servers in any way. You have to pay to play there.
To play on our server, download the torrent and leave it the way it is. Visit our webpage (pretbc.com), registar an account and login using the account name you used during registration.
If you update the game to the latest version (3.x) then you need another server like magic-wow, and I would recommend you to download another torrent with wrath of the lich king installed so you can enjoy the expansion content."
,Yhor,2010-07-01T07:28Z,Awesome server! Very nostalgic. 
,walle245,2010-08-03T11:19Z,"PLEASE HELP ME! when i klick on team-reloaded.exe it stands ""Failed to create WoW process! Is WoWMe in the same directory as WoW.exe?"" what is the WoWMe? And it can also say ""This version of WoWMe was compiled for version 2.4.2 8278 of WoW!""    Please help me really wanna try this server out:)"
,Yhor123,2010-08-10T23:07Z,"If you get any errors after using the Team-Reloaded.exe... force recheck the torrent and resume the torrent. When it completes the rechecked download, you should be error free if you use the Team-Reloaded.exe to connect to pretbc.com's server. Occasionally, it's reported that this error is present, but a recheck of the torrent always fixes it. Hope this helps.
"
[T],Harrharrr,2011-01-14T09:04Z,"Okay this server is dead and buried, but who knows it might come back one day... so keeping the torrent"
