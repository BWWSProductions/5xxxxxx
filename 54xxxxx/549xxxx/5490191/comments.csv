[V],Roberto Rastapopoulos,2010-04-11T01:55Z,"Mercyflush64

I suggest that you look up when and where this event was held."
,share1971,2010-04-11T02:01Z,"lol if this is real than uploader is from the future event starts in 2 hours!!!!!!

,Admz,2010-04-11T02:12Z,"The event was in Abu Dhabi, it began 10am PST."
,johnny_carnage,2010-04-11T02:19Z,"Dude is a trusted purple cross bones and after checking 4 random ups from his list -seems legit.
No past claims of fakery."
,johnmbot,2010-04-11T02:26Z,not fake... fights are over... http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/mma/04/10/penn.upset.ap/index.html?eref=sihp
,MoMahdi,2010-04-11T02:54Z,You dumbs fucks. This fight was held in UAE not in the US so this fight already happened. Next time know your facts before you open your dumb fucking mouths. Awesome upload torrentzone01
[T],spotswood,2010-04-11T02:59Z,Why would someone with a skull be uploading bullshit torrents!?  Fuck off troubleshitmakers!
,jukaal,2010-04-11T03:06Z,"@torrentzone01:

I reported it fake because I downloaded a large portion of the file and previewed it and it WAS porn. Someone commented on the other upload that this was because of fake seeders, and not the fault of the uploader. So sorry if I was/am wrong, I just reported what I saw."
,maasa,2010-04-11T03:14Z,Is the other torrent a fake ?
,MrErick,2010-04-11T03:14Z,Well now I'm curious if this was ripped with English commentators. Did the PPV broadcast in the US at 10am or are did they save it for the traditional 7pm timeslot?
,maasa,2010-04-11T03:17Z,"ofc its with english commentary, just as it is when they are in any other region, like the one in germany."
,simpledood,2010-04-11T03:21Z,"lol wow @ some of you. Thanks torrentzone, you're the man!"
,maasa,2010-04-11T03:22Z,"damn slow downloading, been cross downloading with the other torrent, does that cause a tracker problem? or is it just slow atm, usually my downloads just flyes by."
,Jonathan.Bacon,2010-04-11T03:32Z,GUYS!!! Look on the Wikipedia page this even was available at 1pm on PPV since it was being taped in the Arab Emerates. This is legit...SPOILER...One of the champs lost their titles
,catamaranman,2010-04-11T03:42Z,Goddamnit stupid fucking spoilers! Especially johnmbot.....the result is spoiled in the link.....dickhead.....

,keithh85,2010-04-11T04:06Z,LEGIT I am 95% and previewed it. IT IS REAL. BIG THANKS TO UPLOADER!!!!
,loadup101,2010-04-11T04:43Z,CMON PEOPLE SEED PLEASE!!!!!!!
,catamaranman,2010-04-11T05:00Z, No one cares that you saw it first and people that dont know the fights are not going to be at the normal time dont deserve to be told...those of us looking for this torrent so early are obviously big fans and dont want this spoiled!  Fuck JonathanBacon and Johnmbot for spoiling this event I've been waiting months for.....
,catamaranman,2010-04-11T05:05Z,"BTW....forget my earlier comment about this being fake...sorry and thanks so much torrentzone01 for the speedy up, this is real and works on PS3....BUT THE PRICKS POSTING SPOILERS IN THE COMMENTS SHOULD BE HUNG BY THEIR COCKS!"

,ahalheru,2010-04-11T07:36Z,see damnit!!  This small ass file should not take me all day to download it!!
,jukaal,2010-04-11T18:40Z,"@torrentzone01:

Uh, nope. I commented on the right one. My earlier comments were removed, probably because I said it was fake and it was not.

Anyhow, I already explained what happened and why I said it was fake. I watched it last night and enjoyed it, thanks for the upload. There were some very entertaining fights."
,iseealivepeople,2010-04-11T18:47Z,fights sucked.

,youreallgay,2010-04-11T22:01Z,Anyone know where to find the unaired prelims. Youre a bit out of order there john bacon you didnt need to say that.
,catamaranman,2010-04-12T21:17Z,"Hey, guess what?  Since this event was spoiled for me by some dickheads on TPB I discovered bestmmatorrents.com has a spoiler-free timezone for 72 hours after a main event.  Also OMG they have complete fighters career torrents and OLD UFC with decent quality.....im never coming to TPB again for UFC events.....Fuck you Jonathan Bacon and Jonmbot"
