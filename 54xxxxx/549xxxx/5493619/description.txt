Storyline:

Nicholas Angel is the finest cop London has to offer, with an arrest record 400% higher than any other officer on the force.
He's so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel's superiors send him to a place where his talents won't be quite so embarrassing -- the sleepy
and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford.
Once there, he is partnered with the well-meaning but overeager police officer Danny Butterman.
The son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman, Danny is a huge action movie fan and believes his new big-city partner might just be a real-life "bad boy,"
and his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he so longs for.
Angel is quick to dismiss this as childish fantasy and Danny's puppy-like enthusiasm only adds to Angel's growing frustration.
However, as a series of grisly accidents rocks the village, Angel is convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and, as the intrigue deepens,
it's time for these small-town cops to break out some big-city justice.
