A superb album of live solo Blues from one of the genre's greatest living artists, the one and only Taj Mahal.
It is impossible to describe the legendary musician Taj Mahal in any short phrase. Yes, he's a soulful Blues singer and guitar player, but also a globetrotting multi-instrumentalist, composer, producer, ethnomusicologist, musicians' advocate, and the winner of two Grammy Awards. Oh yeah, he is also a warm human being, with a great sense of humor, and he likes to fish, and smoke fine cigars! For over 40 years Taj Mahal has been playing his very own distinctive brand of Blues. On a rock solid Country-Blues foundation the artist has layers a mixture of genres, including Caribbean, Hawaiian, African, Latin, and Cuban sounds and rhythms blended with Folk, Jazz, Zydeco, Gospel, Rock, Pop, Soul, and R&B. It's been said he plays Afro-Caribbean Blues, Folk-World-Blues, Hula Blues, Folk-Funk, and half a dozen other hyphenated descriptions which have attempted to describe his style, whereas in truth trying to pigeonhole the man is a futile exercise. The glue that sticks it all together is Taj's enduring interest in musical discovery, particularly in tracing American musical forms back to their roots in Africa and Europe. ~ amazon.co.uk
