,thearches,2010-04-16T05:56Z,"Just be aware that you're getting the viewpoint of a well-known right wing extremist.  Don't expect an even-handed approach.  If that's what floats your boat, fine.  If you're looking for serious scholarship, however, look elsewhere.  Just google the author."
,IanCWilliams,2010-04-16T08:36Z,"thearches,

I respectfully have to say that whenever I see the term ""right-wing extremist"", I know the person who is saying it is being dishonest. Phrases like that are so calculated to move men to fear that they cannot possibly be realistic or truthful. Sorry, but it doesn't work for me.

Either way, I wish you well!"
[T],jwhitt62,2010-04-16T20:42Z,"Thanks, Mr. Williams. You're correct; Ad Hominem attacks are a trademark of the Left. Yes, Mr. Spencer is conservative, but I believe that means he's right more often than wrong. He is a scholar and writer. I trust what he says and believes."
,thearches,2010-04-17T05:53Z,"As I said, google the author.  Sometimes calling someone a right-wing extremist is name-calling, sometimes it's simply the truth.  Decide for yourself.

For myself, to the extent I wish to learn about Islam and the Koran, I'll pick a source who isn't already on record with lies about the wars and who hasn't already made a splash with bias and hate speech.

But, again, don't take my word for it.  Do your own research.  But do yourself a favor and do your research before you subject yourself to this author's right-wing (there it is again) propaganda.  If you decide you like his obvious slant - as the other 2 commenters apparently do - then go for it."
[T],jwhitt62,2010-04-17T08:26Z,"Thanks for allowing me to make my own choices. I have a lot of strong opinions about many things, but I have the ability to separate people from their positions. You will not ever see me post any personal attacks on any person. I will take objection to what they say and their believes, but I have respect for their point of view, so I I EVER attack them personally. That's one of the big differences between the left and right. The left start with name-calling, and very rarely give even a single example of what they disagree with; sound familiar. How about one, just one example, any."
,thearches,2010-04-17T17:41Z,"@ jwhitt62 - One wonders what such an exemplary specimen of humanity is getting so riled up about.

It may be the case that nobody but wingnuts will be attracted to this torrent.  But if someone who isn't interested in subjecting himself to a propagandistic screed lands on this page he or she might like to have some warning.

You are obviously too perfect to require it so please accept my heartfelt apology for burdening you."
[T],jwhitt62,2010-04-17T17:58Z,"Elegant, Mr. arches, but you continue to prove my point. I ask for one example of Mr. Spencer's ""right-wing extremism"" and you offer exactly ZERO. Also, I suggest you ""educate"" yourself by reading David Horowitz' ""Unholy Alliance Radical Islam and the American Left"". You'll see yourself in that work. Oh yeah, I forgot, David Horowitz is one of those ""right-wing extremist"", so that completely disqualifies him."
[T],jwhitt62,2010-04-17T18:00Z,Do all you leftists go to the same seminars to learn to post to torrents?
,thearches,2010-04-17T21:09Z,"Actually I have read as much of Horowitz's Unholy as I could stomach (which wasn't much), along with a good chunk of his Destructive Generation - the subject matter of which is something I have experienced.  He's a dangerously dishonest writer.

It's precisely the connection between Spencer and Horowitz that made me do some research before downloading this work.

Don't get me wrong, if you are a believer, then this book is probably what you want to reinforce your preconceived notions.  And, to be frank, I approve of you making it available to those for whom it has appeal.  But if you're coming from the left and/or are looking for something to educate you, this is almost certainly not what you want."
,thearches,2010-04-17T21:15Z,"And, yes, we do go to all the same seminars. 

They tell us, for example, when to use terms like ""right wing extremist"" - when you want readers to know where you're coming from.  And when not to use such terms - when you want to confuse the right wing extremists.  And when to use sarcasm - in response to sarcasm.

Useful skills.  Would you care to join us?"
,scflats,2010-04-18T13:43Z,"Allow me to referee.  

thearches?  You lost.  

You made accusations without specifics.  You attacked the messenger, and then when called out for it, you attacked the person who called you out.  

You did serve useful for one purpose;  you did a fine job serving as a bad example."
,mhotchkiss,2010-04-18T17:48Z,The comments might be more interesting than the content. Biased books like this should be read (or listened to) by both sides but taken with a grain of salt. These two should enjoy their debate but not take it too seriously.
[T],jwhitt62,2010-04-18T21:10Z,"Yeah, Mr Arches, I'd have trouble reading Horowitz's book too, once I learned how much my beliefs have in common with radical Islam. True hurts, eh? 

I'm going to ask one more time, and this time very slowly....please provide JUST ONE example of Spencer's or Horowitz's ""right-wing extremism"". ONE!!!!!!!!! Prove your leftest moral, intellectual and spiritual supremacy!!!"
[T],jwhitt62,2010-04-26T21:48Z,Didn't think so!!
,gasman364,2010-04-29T00:25Z,"Oh, come ON you guys!?  The Koran is in many ways like the Old Testament: violent, intolerant, misogynistic, and completely unsuited for the modern world.  Nonetheless, our societies' laws are based on the 10 commandments, and Judaism survives although last I checked, there are no synagogues encouraging killing people for not believing in it.  The Jewish faith has adapted its faith to a modern world so that the nasty violent bits of the book are not twisted to sick and destructive ends.  The Muslim world hopefully will evolve to a similar point, although the moderate Muslims sure are awfully quiet when it comes to jihadist terrorists.  Say, has anyone seen a ""Muslim Parade against Terrorism""?  Me neither.  It's a vicious faith at present, but there is hope for it to evolve into something civilized."
[T],jwhitt62,2010-05-01T08:42Z,"The Old Testament chronicled historical events, which in some cases were violent. It also reflected the times regarding slavery and the place of women in society. But there is much wisdom in the Old Testament along with many firsts concerning morality and goodness in all of human history. But most importantly, the Bible does not command people to do the horrible things proscribed in the Koran."
[T],jwhitt62,2010-05-01T08:46Z,"My above mentioned comments were in regard to the every common tactic of ad hominem attacks made by the left. I have decided to confront these type of attacks every opportunity I have. I won't let them get away with it anymore, at least on my uploads."
,mrcombi,2010-05-01T16:10Z,"Thanks thearches, I did the research and found the author is NOT a right wing extremist but a scholar of many years focusing on islam with many best selling books to his name, actually I believe after witnessing your empty rebuttal of Spencer there's every chance that he began studying Islam before you were born..."
,hamidmp3,2010-05-03T07:37Z,"""But there is much wisdom in the Old Testament along with many firsts concerning morality and goodness in all of human history.""
so is there in Qoran.
""But most importantly, the Bible does not command people to do the horrible things proscribed in the Koran. ""
that's because these books are written from two different perspectives. remember, Qoran is believed to be God almighty's own exact words directed to uncivilized arabs 1400 years ago to save their souls AND help them survive rival tribes and all those sorts of threats, but it also preaches more or less the same moral values and goodness as the Bible. 
moreover, what is done in the name of a religion doesn't necassarily reflect that religion's (or their holy Book's) original point of view. just remember rivers of blood the christians spilled in the middle ages commiting all sorts of atrocities in the name of the prophet of peace and love!

I don't live in the states so I don't have a clear idea of your Left and Right. I can't understand why the typical middle class white american avoids and/or despises the left like a plague while they have much more progressive/ human/ planet conscisous views on almost everything compared to the Right. 
Personally, if I was an American I'd prefer to have Left-wing Government and politians and the world would definitely be much more sympathetic and respecting to such nation and government.

as for the Book, I'd read this one(which clearly leans to the right) and get another book from a Leftist writer(or atleast a Muslim scholar for God's sake!) so I can hear both sides and judge for myself.

,lrnec,2010-05-10T22:34Z,"As a non Muslim student of Middle eastern and Qur'anic studies and while I agree with spencers conclusion that ""traditional Islam contains violent and supremacist elements"" I can say that Robert Spencer isn't really what I'd call a reliable source for studies on the Qur'an. There are far better sources than Spencer to come to this conclusion. 

With that in mind remember that 'The complete Infidel's Guide to the Koran' contains a lot of personal opinion and is aimed at a non-academic audience.

I'm not saying he is wrong just take what he says with a pinch of salt and realise its only one non-experts review. Robert isn't an expert on the Qur'an or related studies, he only holds a masters in general religious studies."
,RasoolKhan,2010-05-23T07:14Z,"This torrent has generated some opposing comments. But I wonder if the Koran, or Old Testament or the Gospels or any other religious texts are worth reading except for fun. They are just fiction. Why waste time on dissecting something that has no value? Maybe some of you guys believe in hell and heaven! Is that why? By the way, Muslims, Jews and Christians have all done evil in the name of religion at different times in history. Is beating up the topical religion today the answer? "
,DarLink,2010-06-26T19:28Z,"gasman364, There is no hope of reforming Islam  - it is actually forbidden to muslims.You are driven by Western logic, implying the necessity of critical thinking, while Mohammed's followers are stripped of that ability.Are you really willing to take a chance and let them run the world in the name of Allah as they are so obviously striving to achieve?The book is more than 1300 years old, but nothing has changed  - how many more years of grace should we give them, how much more misery should be bestowed upon us ? I would not be holding my breath.... "
,zeitgeistmandvdrip,2010-07-27T04:17Z,"Christianity -The belief that some cosmic Jewish zombie can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present because some rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree."
,shaan117,2010-09-12T15:43Z,Only 3 branches of waterstones stock this in England!  Thank you Jwhitt62; you saved me having to use Amazon.
,faried,2011-02-04T10:25Z,"jwhitt62, if you're still interested in examples, there are many to choose from.  There's a whole bunch at FAIR's site, for starters

http://smearcasting.com/smear_spencer.html

Here's one for you: what exactly makes Robert Spencer an expert or scholar on Islam?"
,Generican,2011-03-02T19:25Z,"@thearches

You say that Robert Spencer is a liar?  Well the Koran is full of lies...So if this guy is lying about lies, it's only logical to assume that what he's saying is indeed the truth..."
,tre.fire,2011-04-28T16:36Z,"It's absurdly funny that jwhitt62 mentions ad hominem attacks when s/he has posted so much Rush Limbaugh, the Queen of personal attacks! thearches, if you aren't from the US you don't realize the futility of trying to convince (or encourage to think for themselves) religiously motivated American ""conservatives"" with words. Humans are lazy, they don't want to think so they just choose a side that fits their world view and won't hear anything but support of their preconceptions. There are an equal number of morons in every country but the culture dictates the idiom of the stupid. The un-thinking commentators attacking you are the shame and destruction of the US, but every culture has its share of ignorance so don't let these mantra-mouthing fanatics convince you that they represent America or the values of this country."
