,catamaranman,2010-04-11T05:22Z,"Works great! Thanks for the UP! P.S.- everyone who doesn't want the ending spoiled stay away from the comments...especially on the other 2 copies on TPB now...people still feel like they need to post results as if to say ""hahaha I saw it first""!  FUCK THE SPOILERS!"
,catamaranman,2010-04-11T06:27Z,Also....DL'ed all three copies...this one took a bit longer to finish but is better video quality than the other 2 despite being a smaller file.(?)  Additionally this is a single file and the other two are split......
,houdinkie,2010-04-11T13:17Z,thanks can't wait to watch it !!!!!!!
,catamaranman,2010-04-12T05:41Z,"Seems video is SLIGHTLY better on this copy...its barely noticable tho......I think this audio stream is smaller thats why....BTW also DLed: UFC.112.Invincible.HDTV.XviD-W4F
Its HD (sorta) and surprisingly fast!"
,catamaranman,2010-04-12T21:17Z,"Hey, guess what?  Since this event was spoiled for me by some dickheads on TPB I discovered bestmmatorrents.com has a spoiler-free timezone for 72 hours after a main event.  Also OMG they have complete fighters career torrents and OLD UFC with decent quality.....im never coming to TPB again for UFC events.....Fuck you Jonathan Bacon and Jonmbot"
