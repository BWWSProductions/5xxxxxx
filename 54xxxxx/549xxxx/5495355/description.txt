     What's New in WinZip 14.5 ?
    ________________________	     
     Microsoft Windows 7 is here, and WinZip 14 is ready for it. Were 
     taking advantage of Windows 7s key features, and weve 
     streamlined and improved many of our dialogs and operations to 
     make WinZip easier to use and better than ever. Weve enhanced 
     security too, by automatically wiping any files that were 
     temporarily extracted from your encrypted Zip files.
     
     Windows 7 support
    ________________________
     Windows 7 includes many significant enhancements that simplify 
     working with documents, folders, and programs. WinZip 14 takes 
     full advantage of these new features to make working with your Zip 
     files effortless:
     
         Libraries
     ________________________
         WinZip 14 provides support for Windows 7 libraries. Libraries 
     group together folders with a common theme regardless of where 
     the folders reside. For instance, the Windows 7 Pictures library 
     groups all your separate folders that contain pictures in one 
     convenient place. WinZip allows you to create and open Zip files 
     in these convenient, themed libraries, add files from libraries to a 
     Zip file, and extract to libraries. This makes many activities much 
     easier. For example, you can zip all of your pictures, no matter 
     where they are, by simply selecting the Pictures library.
     
         With the WinZip Job Wizard, you can automate zipping of your 
     libraries using jobs that you create or jobs that are provided with 
     WinZip 14. Windows 7 also lets you define your own libraries, and 
     you can take advantage of those with WinZip. For example, you 
     might create a Backup library containing a collection of folders 
     with content that you frequently back up in Zip files. Or you might 
     create an Archive library that contains a collection of folders in 
     which you have stored Zip files.
     
         Jump Lists
     ________________________
         Windows 7 provides easy access to your documents and 
     programs with taskbar icon jump lists. Pin the WinZip 14 icon to 
     your taskbar for quick and easy access to frequently used zip 
     features, recently used Zip files, and your favorite WinZip jobs. 
     WinZip 14 even supports the new taskbar progress meter, which 
     lets you keep an eye on the progress of extensive zip operations 
     right on the taskbar while you work.
     
         Explorer Preview
     ________________________
         With a simple click in Windows 7 Explorer you can activate a 
     preview pane, allowing you to view the contents of certain file 
     types. WinZip 14 adds Zip files to the list of supported files, so 
     you simply select a Zip file in Explorer and the preview pane 
     shows whats inside your Zip file. See a file in your Zip file that you 
     want to view? Double-click it in the preview pane and your file is 
     extracted and opened. Plus, if you use Outlook 2007, you can 
     now use its preview pane to see the contents of zipped 
     attachments and open files inside an attached Zip file.
     
         Touch Screens
     ________________________
         WinZip 14 fully supports gesturessimple finger 
     movementson your touch screen PC. Using gestures, you can 
     easily scroll through the contents of your Zip files. And using 
     Windows 7s new multi-touch (two finger) gestures, you can even 
     pan, zoom, and rotate your images in WinZip Pro's built-in Image 
     Viewer without touching your keyboard or mouse!
     
         Common Dialogs and Task Dialogs
     ________________________
         Many WinZip dialogs, including the New, Open, Add, and 
     Extract dialogs, have been updated to use the Windows 7 style 
     and to provide new filtering and organizational support for finding 
     your files and archives. New task dialogs provide clear and 
     easy-to-follow instructions throughout WinZip 14.
     
     Security
     ________________________
     A key reason why many users purchase WinZip is its powerful, 
     easy-to-use AES encryption. WinZip 14 introduces automatic 
     wiping, which helps you to keep your confidential information 
     confidential. To open an encrypted file, WinZip must create a 
     temporary copy of the file on your disk. This temporary copy is 
     deleted when you close the file, but, before doing so, WinZip 14 
     wipes (or shreds) it using the U.S. Department of Defense 
     standard (DoD 5220.22-M). This prevents temporarily extracted 
     copies of encrypted files from being recovered. It is safe and 
     simple and secure.
     
     In addition, WinZip 14 recognizes Intel-based computers with 
     built-in AES encryption and uses the available hardware support 
     to make encryption operations two to three times faster.
     
     Zipping Simplicity
     ________________________
     WinZip has always been focused on making compression and 
     encryption as easy as possible. Most operations can be accessed 
     directly with a right click in Windows Explorer. Inside WinZip 14, 
     the following updated dialogs for Windows 7 and Vista users 
     provide even more power and simplicity:
     
         Add
     ________________________
         In the Add dialog you can use the new Organize and Views 
     features to help you find the files, folders, and libraries you want 
     to add to your Zip file. With a few clicks, you can elect to add only 
     specific types of files, such as documents or spreadsheets. You 
     can create your own custom filter to control which files are added 
     and modify other options for how they are added as well.
     
         Extract
     ________________________
         As in the Add dialog, the Organize and Views features in the 
     Extract dialog allow you to easily navigate and find the libraries or 
     folders to which you want to extract the content of your Zip files. 
     Just pick a folder or library and click Extract; its as simple as 
     that.
