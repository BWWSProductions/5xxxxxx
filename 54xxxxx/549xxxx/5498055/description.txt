A collection of risquÃ© jazz and blues tunes. While all drug related in one way or another, most of these songs center around the usage of that great menace, Marijuana. 

Incredibly enough, songs with this subject matter actually enjoyed a certain level of popularity at the time. Until the (US) Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, that is. That piece of legislation led to the eventual criminalization of cannabis. Because of federal pressure, many of the artists that continued to sing about its virtues suffered industry blacklisting.

Skin up and enjoy.
