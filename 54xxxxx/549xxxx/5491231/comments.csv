It a ""one must see  ""."
,crookedtree,2010-04-11T20:04Z,"absolutely! I agree. Haven't seen it in years but I still remember clearly the wedding scene... and that one drop of red wine that spills on the brides dress, clearly significant based on the way the camera zooms in, but I have never really understood why.. anyway, thanks again man."
