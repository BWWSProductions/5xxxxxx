I may have to switch to another tracker."
,wtcls123,2010-04-12T12:01Z,Thanks a lot for all this. :)
,kaarma33,2010-04-22T03:33Z,Set 4 CBDA is now available!
,sk9348392,2010-08-12T21:27Z,Thanks for these sets. Is Set 6 missing?
,kaarma33,2010-09-06T07:08Z,"I'm still working on Set 10 and then Set 6 would be next.  Set 11 and 12 would follow.

23 more comics to trim for Set 10.
Set 10 will also have a A day in a duck's life scanlation drawn by Daan Jippes as well as comic updates and some scanlated one pagers.
2-3 more weeks."
