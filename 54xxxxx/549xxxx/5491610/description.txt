Updated Video request list.

The excellent free disney comics website is available if you just
want to read the uncropped comics online.
Much thanks goes to that guy who has posted many more recent 
scans of wdc&s stories.  It gives me a quite a few more comics
to update though.


The CBDA collection will be complete, but if you can find better scans 
than posted within this collection, then
please leave a message and post up your comic scans.


I will update this request list as I go along.
Thanks for helping!
