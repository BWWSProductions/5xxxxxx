,nightwish1988,2010-04-11T18:41Z,Do not download if u dont want some wierd japanese sub on the movie. Seriously enoying.
,deus3x,2010-04-11T18:50Z,"hey nightwish. i know you were born in 1988 but please the subs are chinese. It's never to late to learn a little about the great outside. it would be like taking german subs for english one. and oh boy you wouldn't like it. and by the way, i'm french and i speak your language."

,OGma59,2010-04-13T21:11Z,"hey, deus3x, pas tous les AmĂŠricains sont stupides!  Some of us went to college or even learned other languages in high school.  We have very little use for Chinese in our everyday lives - just as even though I took four years of French, I've never really had occasion to use it.  On the other hand, English is spoken in most countries worldwide; and I'm sure that's why you speak it.  Chinese and Japanese schools teach English to all their students for a reason.  
p.s I see people butchering English on this site and others every day and don't call them stupid.  Chill out on the hatin, bro, you'll end up with a stroke."
,OGma59,2010-04-13T21:13Z,"oh, yeah, this torrent is out of sync"
,HOT-LIPS,2010-04-14T19:58Z," thank you,
                ogma59 this is not out of sync,
           i down loaded it and coverted it to dvd
          nae problem   O K."
,OGma59,2010-04-15T18:19Z,"whatever, hot-lips, i played it on vlc & it was oos and it was oos after converting with convertxtodvd...not very bad, but enough to be irritating.
i am thankful to the upper, just saying, it is slightly oos and the oriental subs block out the English ones for the Spanish parts (though I speak Spanish and can understand those parts, many people cannot)"
,Lopes_221,2010-04-16T07:26Z,whats the A/V on this? cause i liked this in theaters i dont wanna get like some cam edited version
,uberglotten,2010-04-23T09:14Z,Can someone post a good copy of this in the DVDR section in English with no subs. You would be a legend. Thx Mates.

,arun4urmoney,2010-06-27T04:49Z,"OGma59, you're a dumbass. You took offense by deus3x comments and you attacked him and all he was saying was that nightwish1988 needs to be more in tuned with the world. He didn't say that we needed to learn chinese, just that if you knew any better you could tell the difference between chinese and japanese. It's like a person calling an Asian a Negro because they don't know of any other race other than white or Negro. I'm an American but you're just a dumbass american. "
