UniversalAbsurdity NOTES
Used Video from a chinese R6 and Audio from a Reguler English Cop out TS, i didn't crop the chinese sub part, just blurred the lower chinese sub part. but didn't do anything with upper chinese sub coz it will blur the video and there is also english sub for foreign parts. so sometimes upper chinese sub will come, but its not much, and there is still english sub for foreign parts.
sample included.
