,FcukReality,2010-04-13T17:46Z,When is GTA: Episodes from Libery City going hit the bay?
[V],Mbb15,2010-04-13T17:48Z,"I hope soon, its already released in North America so the Razor1911 guys needs to crack it."
[T],Knaster,2010-04-13T18:03Z,"Woohoo then maybe tomorrow if were lucky :)

drooling (like homer)"
,thyho,2010-04-13T18:31Z,"Hope 1.0.6.0  crack come soon.
Just Waiting"
,Alekcsander,2010-04-13T18:35Z,"I hAVE bought this game so I don't need a crack ,thanks"
,sqllius,2010-04-13T18:59Z,Yes where is the new gta liberty episods? I do not appreciated the long wait time. 
,SteXDudE,2010-04-13T19:06Z,Will crack 1.0.5.0 work with this patch? Can someone check
,Netarangi,2010-04-13T22:47Z,"Alek, what the fuck was the point in posting that? You're the man, you bought it! Fuck off"
[V],Mbb15,2010-04-13T22:56Z,"Note: Crack from version 1.0.4.0 still works on this version, download it here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4979250/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV_v1.0.4.0_Update-RazorDOX-CrackOnly"
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-04-14T00:10Z,"Note: I don't really recommend using a crack from a previous version of most games... it fucks up many games, it might work, and it might be bugfull too"
[V],Mbb15,2010-04-14T01:01Z,"the orginal file that has been cracked isnt updated since the last 2 versions, so there is no change that it will screw up your game.
If razor1911 will update this version, they will release exactly the same files.
understood?"
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-04-14T01:53Z,"The last crack doesn't work well with 1.0.0.4 patch (the patch before this one), you can't complete a main mission because it locks up

I still don't recommend using this version until proper crack is available, keep using 1.0.4.0 because as of now, it works flawlessly"
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-04-14T02:01Z,"Oh, didn't notice it, congrats on VIP skull"
,motnahpraw,2010-04-14T03:46Z,"The update broke my game. When I try to launch it, it says, ""FILE CHECK FIX ERROR!"" Sorry, but this version of GTAIV is not supported"" 

Which mod is messing up the game?"
,motnahpraw,2010-04-14T03:51Z,"Never mind, I fixed that, but now I'm getting a new error: ""Invalid resource detected. Please reinstall the game"""
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-04-14T03:54Z,Told ya
,DBNSystem,2010-04-14T08:48Z,'EFC20 - Invalid resource detected' happens if you use a crack which is too old - the 1.0.4.0 crack 'update' still works completely on this version. ;)
,DBNSystem,2010-04-14T10:54Z,"Also, I guess EFLC will come soon. :)"
,RobertinhoNIKE,2010-04-14T15:18Z,"GTA: Episodes form Liberty City is out on Internet. But, no crack. You can found the game in epidem.ru... 16.24 GB"
[V],Mbb15,2010-04-14T16:38Z,"@all

this patch dont work if you have installed mods, try to install it on a fresh copy"
,SteXDudE,2010-04-14T16:50Z,Mbb15 are you sure this crack will work with this patch?Did you try it and can i install this patch offline?
[V],Mbb15,2010-04-14T16:53Z,"I tried it and it works single player, and online because I have a serial from another GFWL game so I can play it online to, but I havent tried a mission because I already finished the story"
,SteXDudE,2010-04-14T16:59Z,"OK and one more question,Episodes From Liberty City:Do i need to download full game or there will be a version just to ""update"" the original GTA 4 ?"
[V],Mbb15,2010-04-14T17:06Z,"you will need the stand-alone version (full) it will be here in a few days, im sure of that."
,Ezlin,2010-04-14T21:51Z,"Thanks a lot dude, I hope this patch helps the performance. Can't wait till Episodes is cracked, should be soon and it will probably be a Razor crack."
,itttakary,2010-04-14T23:00Z,"hey guys!
there's a problem with my game: i sintalled this patch successfully, but tha game is not working. In task manager i can see the GTAIV.exe for 5 secs, but after that, it exits :( 
i used the crack of 1040 as you told

i tried to install SocialClub again, but it didnt work"
,Ezlin,2010-04-15T01:10Z,"@ittakary
This is how to get it running.
1. Do a clean install of the game.
2. Apply patch right away.
3. Put in 1.0.4.0 crack (and the XliveLess thing, Google it)
4. Run it.
If that doesn't work, are you running a rip of the game or something like that?"
,kespertive,2010-04-17T13:32Z,"@Ezlin

yeah it works :)

but you can patch the game with the 1.0.1.0, 1.0.2.0 etc... and then 1.0.6.0

shadows are great :D (finally:P)
and i have avarage 35-40 fps YAY>.<
so this patch is awesome."
,motnahpraw,2010-04-17T21:47Z,"Thanks Mbb15, I tried your link to the crack, and it still doesnt work. However, I'm reinstalling the game. Let's see what happens!"
,keravnos,2010-04-20T11:12Z,"I had the 1.0.4.0 patch installed with the Razor1911 crack supplied by Mbb, then I installed this (from UpdateTitle.exe if that matters) and I didn't even need to apply the crack again. Internet works and everything's fine, though the frame rate dropped quite a bit (probably because Opera was running in the back).

Amen to new shadows. No more pixelated ugliness - even using the GFX tweak isn't necessary anymore. Also, finally no more need for that Social Club drek running in the background. Though it takes time until you get to the game with the new launcher and all... Still, a pretty sweet patch."
,Donut200,2010-04-21T20:20Z,"Please help!I did a clean install, applied patch and carcked game, but when i launch it i got a very annoying lag.Like when i go to a vehicle and accelerate, game lags.PLZ HELP !!! =/"
,Donut200,2010-04-21T20:26Z,"I mean in my previous comment i used razors crackfix crack.Game didn't even start when i used linkid crack.I tried Ezlin's way to solve problem, but it didn't help.Thanks for some1 who can solve this :) :)"
,Ezlin,2010-04-23T01:02Z,"@Donut200
Did the game work before you patched it?"
,Donut200,2010-04-23T07:14Z,"Yea, it works fine with 1.0.0.3 patch and it's crack, but doesn't work with 1.0.0.6 patch and 1.0.0.4 crack."
,Donut200,2010-04-24T20:02Z,Could someone please help ?? =/
,mm1985,2010-04-25T20:16Z,Probably you need to install/update Microsoft Games for Windows - LIVE.
,stickman1000000,2010-04-26T14:19Z,"damn the crack works great but i get stuck at the damn intenet cafe on the computers and i cant use them

anyone solved this that works with this patch"
,aulohk02,2010-05-05T13:36Z,"For those who have ""The ordinal 5365  could not be located in the dynamic link library"" problem (like I had) after applying the crack, make sure you have the latest version of Xliveless installed (atm it is 0.999b1). Older version might not work for this patch."
,NishadJ,2010-05-09T04:51Z,"anybody know a way to play multiplayer? I've tried clicking LIVE and LIVE Marketplace but nothing pops up. I have Games for Windows Live running in the background, signed in but how do I send that account to GTAIV so I can go to my cellphone and run multiplayer successfully? "
,Camaleos,2010-05-16T04:01Z,"Is there a way to mod GTA IV 1.0.6.0? I've been trying so hard, though I couldn't afford doing so"
,computer-guy,2010-07-04T13:38Z,WHY EVERYBODY CALLS THE xlive.dll AS xliveless.dll????
,yourlit,2010-08-17T18:06Z,"@itttakary mine did the same, if your running win7 right click the launcher and properties, you'll see compatibility, run it in windows xp SP3 "
,Eafis,2010-09-03T01:20Z,so the latest is 1.0.6.0 and the previous is 1.0.5.0 ? there is no 1.0.5.0 ??
,R3C0NxX,2010-12-27T18:59Z,"@computer-guy 

Sometimes, People name it xliveless.dll to distinguish the different dll's. But, you do have to rename xliveless.dll to xlive.dll"
