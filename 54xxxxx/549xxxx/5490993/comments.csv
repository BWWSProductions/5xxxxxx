,heathen3017,2010-04-11T16:45Z,Why do you insist on mis-labeling the episode number by 1?
,Dakota85,2010-04-12T14:32Z,"Hey There heathen... obviously i'm not 100% sure what you're meaning and I have no affiliation with TvTeam or anything, but if it helps you, the episode that's listed as 59 by big fish and released on the same day as this one is actually the ""Masterclass"" and isn't the same episode... the Masterclass is a longer episode hence the 500mb. I thought it was strange at first too until I looked at the airdate in the comments. If i'm wrong with your concern, I apologise - just thought i'd try to help! Cheers :o)"
