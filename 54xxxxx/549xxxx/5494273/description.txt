  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

                 Wolfram Research Mathematica v7.01 for Linux

   Whats new?
    - Performance enhancements to core image-processing functions.
    - Right-click menu for quick image manipulation.
    - New tutorials, "How to" guides, and screencasts.
    - Thousands of new examples in the documentation.
    - Improved documentation search.
    - Integration with mathematical handwriting-recognition features of
      Windows 7.
    - Integration with the upcoming release of gridMathematica Server.

   If you're doing anything technical, think Mathematica - not just for
   computation, but for modeling, simulation, visualization, development,
   documentation, and deployment.

   Why Mathematica? Because this one integrated system delivers unprecedented
   workflow, coherence, reliability, and innovation.

   Rather than different toolkits for different jobs, Mathematica has been
   built ground-up over nearly 20 years to deliver one vision: the ultimate
   technical application and environment.

   Following closely on the dramatic reinvention of Mathematica in 2007,
   Mathematica 7 continues the momentum of innovation to deliver an array
   of new capabilities, greatly extending the state of the art in many areas,
   and bringing a dozen major new application fields into the integrated
   framework of Mathematica.
