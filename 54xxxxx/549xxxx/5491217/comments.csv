Hi 20-40, this is a direct reponse to your posting on LOTS E15.

The quark has changed my life and I do NOT want it to go away.

From my reading in your comments section, you are asking for a 7:1 (700%) ratio on seeds for all quark files.
Is this correct?

I, personally, have no problem with this as I do not get charged for uploads and you are now actively (quark file) saving me on downloads.

May I ask what you would prefer as seeding level for non-quark files, e.g. Avatar or Pacific?

I give Pacific 6:1 at this stage anyway but that takes about 6 days. 

The length of time is not the problem but rather that my upload bandwidth, (only 30KBs +/- at best of times), is tied for 'x' days.

Is there a rule you want us to follow, e.g. Pacific - once seeding has reached 3:1 then limit upload speed to 5KBs?

Or do you want us to let the torrent app sort out the upload speeds?

Above is example/question only! 
Looking for input on the way to keep quarks  but also seed other files?

Trying to be fair to everyone but will loose everything else if it means keeping [quark] alive!

Cheers
Jon"

[V],twentyforty,2010-04-12T09:46Z,"@Jon & Stev: I completely understand and you are not alone. [quark] made lot of noise. Even without real mass.
But.
Everything I have said on LOTS e15 is frightening and devastating fact - however behavior of the people haven't surprised myself and for sure not the Jon or any other man who know few things (and have learned or gathered on a hard way thing or two about nature of the humans).
Have any of you downloaded a 43 minutes long episode for 16 seconds? I repeat - SIXTEEN SECONDS. 
Well, about 60 guys, mainly from Sweden, have such experience. And  about 400 got full episode under 6 minutes. I spoke about Vampire Diaries from Friday...

Take a look at any of the [quark] torrents. How many seeders is active?
LATEST talk show pack (greatest saving of all) has TWO frikkin seeder whole Sunday... one sucker plus myself.
ALL this super-trooper-light-speed-fast guys have seeded - ALMOST NOTHING.

Do you know who have been left to drag as snails? THE PEOPLE WHO THIS THINGS ARE FOR - people who still have needed few hours to download. Read my damn ""quark Manifesto"", in entirety, few times, and if something wasn't clear enough, I am sure that your brain could fill eventual blanks up. My English is not very good, but I know how to make myself clear.

As I have said thousands of times:
""I do not expect a thing, from any of you"". I do not ""prescribe"" ratios, time - nothing.

These people do. 

I cannot but to repeat myself:
Be decent human beings, be better than any other men. 

Jon, Stev, do you know how much of people like you is here? I will tell you: twenty-two. And I know all of you not just by your screen-names but I know your IP numbers, how much this and that, pretty much I have a decent picture how any of these twenty two behave - but I see literary hundredths of thousands who haven't read any of these words, never will and never ever would understand. 

None of the things."
