,poet123,2010-04-15T07:47Z,"I generally know eztv to be a trusted source. However, why is it that this particular downloaded file wont play with VLC, WMP, or Real Player? On the other hand it forces you to download some player called ""flvdirect"" (http://www.flvdirect.com/). I checked on cnet and this software is not available on it. I suspect it is spyware. How is this possible knowing that eztv is generally very reliable and trusted?"
,MR-2,2010-04-15T08:08Z,"I am having same problem, looks like spyware, it wont let me play in VLC or real player and forces you to download flvdirect"
,avatar2012,2010-04-15T09:16Z,"FLV Direct 3.0 IS available through CNET.
FLV Players are for .flv files, not .avi files.
Why would an avi file demand that you download software you dont have, to play a file that it cannot read? Strange days indeed - so peculiar brother! EZ!~"
,Dutch_Cap,2010-04-15T12:17Z,REAL!
,poet123,2010-04-15T12:23Z,"I repeat that this torrent is fake! The file is ""protected"" and if you try to play it with VLC, Real  or WMP: it says you need to download ""media usuage rights"", and then it takes you to the FLVdirect page. This is FAKE!!!!"
,embmmusic,2010-04-15T12:23Z,"There are always some people who seek to discredit good uploaders for some reason, but having checked this file in WMP, VLC and my X-Box 360 I can verify that it works perfectly."

,xiphone,2010-04-26T06:55Z,"One can smear any form of ideology by showing what people do with it. For example communism is evil, capitalism is evil(corporates), democracy is evil(spread with gun in iraq), secularism is evil (Brit was secular when it colonized, Saddam was secular. Basically any ideology can be called evil for what its follower do.

People should understand that there are different sensitivities in religion, culture. In some culture talking back to elderlies is wrong but in our culture its not as much of an offense.
Right now our country is blowing up two Muslim countries with cluster bombs, carpet bombs, phosphorus bombs killing over millions directly or indirectly. On top of that Muslims have to keep up with this kind of smearing who are trying just get by with their life. Most of them keep their mouth shut in their country so that the radicals or their dictator government we PLACED wont make them disappear. Its very easy to smear others being in front of a thousand dollar computer with super fast internet and McDonald's burger to eat. Please try to understand it from a different perspective it will change the way you look into the world. "
,mm-artin,2010-04-26T23:00Z,"xiphone freedome of speech is invaluable, and should be the same for everybody. It doesnt matter if you're a muslim or if you eat at Mc Donalds lol"
,wally_91,2010-04-29T20:41Z,It works on Mac OS X 10.6.3 Quicktime but Mohammed is censored :(
,AxBattler,2010-05-02T21:15Z,"Episodes 200 and 201 must stay seeded allways!!

You can't watch these episodes on the SP website, on itunes or any other legit media! ONLY on torrent sites!!

THIS IS THE PUREST MANIFEST OF WHAT FILE SHARING IS ALL ABOUT  -  F R E E D O M "
,Sublime865,2010-05-09T01:08Z,"xiphone:

Not to target muslims, actually, yes, I do target them. my tax dollars that I paid on my mcdonalds burger is going to fund these ball licking douche bags. funding for mosques to preach in MY country. here, an excerpt of what they are preaching:

And fight with them until there is no more persecution and religion should be only for Allah (8:39) 

FIGHT THEM: ALLAH WILL PUNISH THEM BY YOUR HANDS AND BRING THEM TO DISGRACE, AND ASSIST YOU AGAINST THEM. (9:14) 
"
,Sublime865,2010-05-09T01:08Z,"Continued:

I WILL CAST TERROR INTO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO DISBELIEVE. THEREFORE STRIKE OFF THEIR HEADS AND STRIKE OFF EVERY FINGERTIP OF THEM. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ACTED ADVERSELY TO ALLAH AND HIS MESSENGER; AND WHOEVER ACTS ADVERSELY TO ALLAH AND HIS MESSENGER - THEN SURELY ALLAH IS SEVERE IN REQUITING (EVIL). THIS - TASTE IT, AND (KNOW) THAT FOR THE UNBELIEVERS IS THE PUNISHMENT OF FIRE.
"
,Sublime865,2010-05-09T01:08Z,"Continued:

I could go on... Here, do your own damn homework. I'd love one of those raghead fuckers to show up at MY doorstep though screaming jihad. I've got a 10MM round with ""TO: Allah"" written all over it, loaded in my Glock at my hip. Am I intolerant? Of people that want me dead for MY beliefs, YES. Will I shoot to kill? Not for the FIRST 4-5 rounds, no... Besides, cutting them up into cubic inch meat cubes and using them to feed the coyotes out back seems much more satisfying. I should probably pick up a bone saw sometime today.
