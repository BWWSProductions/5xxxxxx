Autobiography was the ninth album by jazz cornetist Nat Adderley and Nat Adderley's first album as a leader after the collapse of Riverside found him switching to Atlantic. With several brass players, Seldon Powell on tenor and flute, pianist Joe Zawinul (who provided the arrangements), bassist Sam Jones, Grady Tate or Bruno Carr on drums and guest spots by Victor Pantoja and Willie Bobo on Latin percussion, he performs eight of his most rewarding compositions. 



It was released in 1964 as a vinyl record, his first after moving to Atlantic Records. It includes elements from the genres of soul jazz and hard bop and a performance of what is arguably one of his best-known achievements, "Work Song", which was produced during his time with his brother Cannonball Adderley's second quartet.
