BBC Wonders of the Solar System 3of5 1080i HDTV h264 AC3

Professor Brian Cox visits some of the most stunning locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature have carved natural wonders across the solar system.

Part 3: The Thin Blue Line
Brian reveals how something as flimsy as an envelope of gas - an atmosphere - can create some of the most wondrous sights in the solar system. He takes a ride in an English Electric Lightning and flies 18 km up to the top of earth's atmosphere, where he sees the darkness of space above and the thin blue line of our atmosphere below. In the Namib desert in south-west Africa, he tells the story of Mercury. This tiny planet was stripped naked of its early atmosphere and is fully exposed to the ferocity of space. Against the stunning backdrop of the glaciers of Alaska, Brian reveals his fourth wonder: Saturn's moon Titan, shrouded by a murky, thick atmosphere. He reveals that below the clouds lies a magical world. Titan is the only place beyond earth where we've found liquid pooling on the surface in vast lakes, as big as the Caspian Sea, but the lakes of Titan are filled with a mysterious liquid, and are quite unlike anything on earth.

This is the original 1080 PAFF TS file wrapped inside a MKV container.
You'll also find the PDTV Xvid and 720p HDTV versions at MVGroup.
These have been tested with VLC v1.0.5 and MPC-HC 1.3.1301.0 and FFDShow and Haali.
If you use FFDShow make sure you use the ffmpeg-mt h264 codec, not the default libavcodec codec.
If you use FFDShow libavcodec codec then one processor thread runs at 100%, the other runs at 0% causing jerky video.
The ffmpeg-mt h264 codec balances out the CPU thread usage.
