,skareo,2011-05-21T08:52Z,"@QuarterBell

Dude? Are you serious or trolling? It's 1280x528 because that's the aspect ratio the film was shot in. It is 1280x720 video, only 1280x192 pixels is black so it was trimmed... God people are retarded. You're downloading a movie ffs, have some respect for the uploader. If you want better quality go buy it you cheap piece of shit."

,kusk69,2011-08-19T06:27Z,QuarterBall is obviously a retard.
,ithorbarr,2011-11-21T00:04Z,"The horizontal resolution is 1280 :P

Also the movie wasn't shot in 720, it was shot with 35mm Kodak analogue film. This has probably been ripped from a 720p recording though."
,ithorbarr,2011-11-21T00:15Z,"Sorry noticed you said aspect ratio, and that it was actually ripped from 1080. According to IMDB this movie's aspect ratio is 2.35:1 (which is in reality, in modern movies 2.39:1 but called 2.35 due to old conventions) cropping a few pixels would make it 2.40:1."
