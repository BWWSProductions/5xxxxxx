Refresh My Heart is the first album from Christian pop rock artist Rebecca St. James. It was released under the name Rebecca Jean by DTS Music and distributed by Word Australia in 1991 when St. James was 13 years old. It was later re-released without an associated label.[1] The album is currently out of print.

For this torrent, I've uploaded a .torrent file for each of the other albums, as opposed to just bundling together stuff I've just downloaded from existing torrents. Kinda surprising that nobody seems to think of uploading discography torrents this way lol
