,honunet,2010-04-19T01:32Z,Dude I think youre past adding screenshots unless you just want to.  I dont think anybody actually checks them anymore if they see your name on the torrent.  Thanks again. Side note: does anybody know how to search for individual torrents on ez's page?  He has so many now it takes me hours to go page by page to find a particular one

To Honunet, sorry if I'm telling you something you already know, but I also use a website          www.eztv.it         which list loads of TV programmes, oddly enough Justified isn't there, but there are lots of others, hope this helps, if not.... well nothing lost :)"
