"FREQUENT FLIERS" 

Nancy (Anastasia Griffith) and her father (guest star John 
Terry) clash over his new role as the head of the Trauma 
center. Marisa (Aimee Garcia) has a surprising dream about 
Rabbit (Cliff Curtis), and it begins to affect their 
working relationship. Boone (Derek Luke) and Tyler (Kevin 
Rankin) respond to a call at a mosque and have a 
difference of opinion on how to treat the patient. 
Elsewhere, Ira (guest star Richard Kind), known for his 
tendency to call in repeatedly for medical assistance, 
resurfaces.

Enjoy:)
