ARE YOU TIRED OF YOUR SAME DESKTOP SCREEN DAY AFTER DAY? 

WOULD YOU LIKE TO BRING YOUR DESKTOP TO LIFE?




Desktop Icon Toy is a desktop enhancement tool, it spices up our desktop and adds a bit of life to it. 

Firstly it can automatically arranges our icons, and gives them a nice "Bouncy" animation when we hover over them. It has a handy way of arranging icons to the top, bottom, left and right of our screen. 



All we have to do is: 

    - Click on a blank area of our desktop 
    - Drag either up,down, left or right, depending on where you want the icons 
      arranged
    - Release the mouse 


And we will see all our icons slide gracefully into their positions. 

Of course, not only that, Desktop Icon Toy also can arrange all our icons in many many very interesting shapes (eg: a live clock), quickly and easily. 



Desktop Icon Toy also allows us to do more cool things: 

    - Save different desktop icon layouts that we like and set a favorite as 
      default 
    - Race desktop icons by dragging and dropping icons quickly 
    - Hide desktop icon texts 
    - Show/hide desktop icons on demand 
    - Lock desktop icons
