It's not Mr. Jones. It's not Dr. Jones. It's LEGO Jones! Indiana Jones returns in LEGO form for a new twist on one of Hollywood's most legendary adventures. Don your fedora, grab your whip, and experience a quirky LEGO take on all four Indiana Jones films, including your first crack at visiting the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Collect artifacts, unlock characters from Indy's adventures, and use your whip to solve treasure-hunting puzzles. Drop-in, drop-out co-op play lets anyone join at any time. You can even create your own movie moments with LEGO's first-ever Build Your Own Adventure Mode, which lets you design and share your own levels.
