ClipMate Clipboard Extender description
-------------
A popular Clipboard Extender that Holds Thousands of Clips, Powerful Internet Features.

ClipMate enhances the Windows clipboard, making it a true power tool.

The cut/copy paste capability of Windows works well for transferring single items of data, but is not useful if you want to move a lot of data or keep data longer than until your next cut or copy (at which time Windows overwrites the clipboard whether you were ready or not!).

ClipMate works alongside the regular Windows clipboard and remembers every piece of data (both text and graphics) that you cut or copy.

Once your data is in ClipMate, you can select an item and it is automatically placed back on the clipboard or directly into the application you were using.

You can view, print, edit, reformat, convert to upper/lower case, search, rename, and reorder clip items. There is even a built-in spellchecker.

You can create an unlimited number of collections to store your data, and you have full control over the retention rules so that your collections will fit your own work process.

For example, you can use a "InBox" collection as a catch-all, and create "Safe" collections for topics like Tips n Tricks, Frequently Used Letter Closings, Clip Art, Hot Internet URLS, Project Research, or whatever you wish. ClipMate's exclusive PowerPaste allows you to rapidly paste large amounts of data with ease.

Shortcuts help you retrieve your favorite clips, and you can keep sensitive data safe with 56-bit ARC4 encryption. Built-in database backup, SQL-based searching, and screen capture round out the new release.

ClipMate Clipboard Extender is a software that allows you extend clipboard.

With ClipMate as your Windows companion, you will take the familiar underpowered clipboard and turn it into an unexpectedly powerful timesaver.

Here are some key features of "ClipMate Clipboard Extender":

Â· Portable! You can now take your clips with you, on portable USB "thumb" drives.
Â· Universal QuickPaste - Available from within Explorer or Classic. Just double-click on a clip, and it pastes wherever you were working. The new "Auto-Targeting" feature watches to see which application you are working in, so that it knows where to paste data when you double-click on a clip.
Â· Virtual Collections - Shows you all clips captured Today, last 7 days, and last 31 days. Â· XML Import/Export - Allows you to share clips with other users, or synchronize multiple databases. If you move from one computer to another, you can export the new/changed clips, and then import into the other database to "sync up". You can even send XML files to other users to share your favorite clips.
Â· Macro Clips - Allow you to designate clips as "macro clips", so that special tokens such as {ENTER}, {TAB}, #DATE#, etc., will be "expanded". This allows the insertion of ENTER, TAB, and modifiers like CTRL+, ALT+, and SHIFT+ to perform "live" as the item is virtually "typed into" the target program. This allows limited navigation within the target app, such as entering a TAB between a userid and password, followed by an ENTER.
Â· VISTA ClipMate utilizes the new clipboard functions available in Vista, to eliminate clipboard connection problems.
Â· Drag 'n Drop - You can now drag text, rich text and graphic clips right into any OLE-compliant application like Word, Internet Explorer, FireFox, TextPad, etc.. You can also drag portions of a text clip from the editing window directly into other programs. And internal drag/drop has been enhanced as well, such as when dragging a clip into the editor.
Â· Templates - add title, URL, date/time, or any boilerplate text to clips as they are pasted. It's like a "mail-merge", built right in. Similar to the "format strings" in QuickPaste, but will work in all situations, and is compatible with PowerPaste.
Â· Screen Capture - Dual-monitor capture is now supported, with mouse pointer capture. Capture individual screens, selected areas on screens, or the whole desktop. And now there are toolbar buttons that you can use to keep your favorite screen-grab functions right at hand, even on the ClipBar if you like. Update: 7.2 lets you capture from up to EIGHT monitors.
Â· User Interface improvements feature easy "stay on top" toggling with transparency, more flexible choices with ClipMate Classic layout, and visually pleasing "skins". The screenshots on this page feature the "Longhorn" skin.
Â· Additional hotkeys for manual clip capture, toggling auto-capture, and manual filtering.
Â· Outbound Filtering is now "active", meaning that if enabled, any new clip arriving on the clipboard is immediately overwritten by a "plain text" or "plain bitmap" version, without the fancy formats such as HTML, RTF, OLE, etc..
Â· Graphic storage in PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format, with comparable space savings to JPEG with no loss of image quality.
Â· Export - The Export function can now prompt for filenames. Graphic clips can be exported directly to PNG files, along witih JPG and BMP as before. If you do a lot of exporting, you can also put the Export button on any of the toolbars.
Â· URL highlighting in editor can now be turned on/off, enabling editing of text with URLs.
Â· Database compatibility with ClipMate 6.5 - eases transitioning, with proven reliability.
