,goldendreams,2010-04-16T00:14Z,"Where have the two last episodes with swedish subtitles gone? Where are our friend Kickfoot?

I do appriciate this torrent too, but I'm still depending on the subs. 
I am reasonably disappointed that they suddenly disappeared.

Do you know anything about that, Doshaat?"
,goldendreams,2010-04-16T00:27Z,"Where has the last two episodes with Swedish subtitles gone?
Where are Kickfoot gone?
I really appreciate this torrent, but I have been dependent on the subs because of poor hearing.
