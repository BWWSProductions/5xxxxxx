NOTES:
#
 
#
IMAGiNE bringing you another release.....Why Did I Get Married Too ?
#
Well firstly welcome back to NNC to the torrenting world .....many thanks bro ;-)
#
Work done,well mainly just rotating the video and ripping source files.....but done a little tweaking to colours,contrast and what not.
#
Audio is untouched not filtered in anyway.
#
Now the source is pretty good for a cam,but does have it problems ...main one being now and again the video
#
goes all weird when changing from dark to light scene (not a focus issue) but it's hard to explain,goes like slow motion and
#
grainy for a few seconds and then kicks back in.
#
Audio....well we have direct audio now and we have it before the other groups (as far as we know). This is pretty good direct audio also, so we did what we said.
#
 
#
Anyway enjoy
