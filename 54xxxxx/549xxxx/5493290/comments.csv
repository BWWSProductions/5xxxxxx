[V],mothergoose56,2010-04-13T01:28Z,"Yea I suppose I could have been more descriptive. It's a special hosted by R&F highlighting the more important bits - they ran it especially for the free Sirius preview last week / weekend. 

I wouldn't wait up for todays O&A unfortunately. I havent edited either R&F or O&A - and I'm getting pretty shit speeds off my current emergency setup. I think I'm going to eat, edit R&F and up it with this crap setup since it's a smaller file. Later tonight I'll put the old image back on my normal system (which will fix my network problems) and take care of 128k O&A. Unbelievable sometimes how all the shit comes crashing down at once. 

I do have a backup system I picked up awhile back that needed a power supply which I now have. I need to re-wire the power plug and that backup system will be ready when needed down the road. "
