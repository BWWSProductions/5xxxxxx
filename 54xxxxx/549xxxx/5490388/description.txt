7 MONTHS are a progressive metal act formed in 1995 in the United States of America, Simi Valley, California. It was not until 2002 that the band released their self-titled debut full-length studio album though. The band at that time consisted of Joe Booe on lead vocals, Chris M Jacobson on guitars and vocals, Garegin "Greg" Kalajian on keyboards and vocals, Shawn "The Dude" Richkind on bass and Barry Magnuson on drums and percussion. Lead vocalist Joe Booe was replaced by Danny Veras before the recording of the second full-length studio album "In Time" which was released in 2009.
