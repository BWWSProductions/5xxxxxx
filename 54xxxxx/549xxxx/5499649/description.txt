The Spiritual Predecessor to Black & White

About: Heaven & Hell - Live and Let Die is a game in which you send missionaries to convert various towns to your faith, either Good or Evil. Doing so allows you to Generate mana, which allows you to use a variety of miracles, upgrade structures and create new Disciples. The game requires no disc to play and can be played online with just about anyone provided you set up a game. The single player random map games are a bit weak but the good and evil campaigns are fairly fun and the game has a lot of colorful humor and nice cutscenes.

Installation: Installation is simple, just mount, run install, and play. I suggest
Daemon Tools or PowerIso but it is simply a point of preference.

Scanned and Clean: I uploaded this torrent after seeing that another, provided with
a rather gruesome picture I might add, came loaded with malware, stealth viruses and trojans. If you had the misfortune of trying to install that other one I strongly suggest doing a thorough virus scan.
