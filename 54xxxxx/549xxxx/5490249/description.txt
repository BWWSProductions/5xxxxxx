In todays's age of the internet, labels remastering oldies records and blogs posting the forgotten music, it's becoming extra tough to pick obscure/rare albums from my collection that fit the criteria I had set for posting these torrents. Anyhow I managed to come up with another set of four that are still hard to come by. Some fun rocking records which will just make this 80s wiki more complete! Please don't forget to seed...
