                                 : Takes us behind the headlines to reveal 
                                   the political maneuvering behind Barack 
                                   Obama's effort to remake the American 
                                   health system and transform the way 
                                   Washington works. Through interviews  
                                   with administration officials, senators 
                                   and Washington lobbyists, Obama's Deal 
                                   reveals the dramatic details of how an 
                                   idealistic president pursued the health 
                                   care fight -- despite the warnings of 
                                   many of his closest advisers -- and how 
                                   he ended up making deals with many of 
                                   the powerful special interests he had 
                                   campaigned against.
