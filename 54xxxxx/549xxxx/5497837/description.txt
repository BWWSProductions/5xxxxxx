Thanks for your continuous support! NAVIGATOR team wishes to thank all the people who keep downloading our lists. There's more and more of you each month, and we're trying hard to choose only quality stuff and include it in our playlist and make it more FRESH!!! each time.

Anyone who is interested in sending your own stuff (via links to downloads), we would gladly listen to your music and include it in our list or radio show if we find it good, so more people would hear it...

Soon we will post some more lists with our choice of music in other genres as well - ranging from fresh electronic to fresh jazz, swing, nu soul & groove and more...

As always, our own radio show is on the internet radio station (every Tuesday 9pm CET).There you will be able to hear some new stuff before we upload it on the net.

From this month we also included artwork from our good friend Andrea. Every month you will be able to use her artwork as cover for Navigator's Fresh!! Indie Playlists.

Best regards
Navigator  team
