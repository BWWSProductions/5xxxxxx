Yeah, I know where I am, but this is the good stuff, produced by a guy like us.  Feeding his family with the proceeds.

Buy it if you like it."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-13T17:22Z,"An admirable sentiment, @hielo999 . 

The thing is, many of the people using TPB just don't have the $39.99 that's being charged for this. Should they just do without? 

Or don't you think it's a better idea that they use it, become converts, spread the word and actually help the creators of this software make money? Or is good stuff only for people with money?"

,beccyd,2010-04-13T20:15Z,"Works great, Thank you."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-13T20:28Z,"Glad to hear it, @beccyd. Thanks for letting me know."
,Hecubus452,2010-04-14T05:59Z,"I've been using Scrivener for years and love it. I'll absolutely buy it when 2.0 comes out, but in the meantime, I'm gonna enjoy having an up to date version."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-14T19:38Z,"@MachIICumshot , would you like a puppy to drown? I'll be happy to upload one. The cuter, the better, right?"
,anders_and,2010-04-20T10:46Z,to TPBRools: If you use both you find this is NOT a ripoff from Storyist. And if it were - it still is a piece of software that could/should/ought to be bought. Keith in Truro/Cornwall is not The Big Company that should be cheated ... 
,ashrosek,2011-02-06T11:26Z,"I downloaded it and it works great, thanks. :)

However, when I first opened the program, it said that the program is unregistered and I will need to register within 30 days, or it will no longer open.  Was this download only for the trial version?  Is there a way to keep the program past 30 days?  Will I lose anything I do in the program once the 30 days are up?

Thanks!"
