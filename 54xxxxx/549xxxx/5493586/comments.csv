and open the hosts.file with Notepad and paste the lines in and save. You might have to log off or restart but I doubt it."
,kauken,2010-06-03T12:48Z,"PLEASE HELP.

Cant evade ( get past) the activation code popup.

I have to each time use the keygen on startup, fine, but when u have Photoshop, illustrator, Dreamweaver, Flash etc it gets kind of irritating AND I guess I?m gone run out of codes!!

I have done as described: used the ?127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com? in
Windows / system 32 / drivers / etc / hosts

There is something out there that hacks master collection and deletes Dynamiclink.app, which makes the whole suite collection not work."
