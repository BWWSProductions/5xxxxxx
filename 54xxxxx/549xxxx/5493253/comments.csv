Then when i see all the releases i thought they was going to be bad just like all the other famous films that people rush out on torrents but having this film this early of this quality is a wish come true lol so thanks for the up and thanks to imagine for the hard work they put into it.
Now for the wait for it on bluray, and irobot 2, mib3 etc etc ;)"
