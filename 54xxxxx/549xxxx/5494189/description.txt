For the second show at the United Palace, the ABB brought several new and rare tunes to the table, along with smokin' hot versions of Allman Brothers classics.  Even though the band isn't at the Beacon, this show is proof that they always bring something special for New York!

Bob Dylan's "Blind Willie McTell" is a perfect choice, considering that the Allmans helped popularize McTell's "Statesboro Blues."  Check out the vocal harmonies on this cool addition to the ABB repertoire!  That was followed immediately by the first version of "Egypt" since 3/20/06, and this exotic-sounding instrumental has never sounded better!  This incredible jam is great to have back in rotation.  Wicked versions of "Gilded Splinters" and "Woman Across The River" finished off a first set that felt like a second set!

Susan Tedeschi joined the band for two tunes to start the second set, performing Delaney and Bonnie's song "Comin' Home" and "Lost Lover Blues."  As always, Susan's sultry vocals and stinging blues guitar licks added a lot to this show.  Check out the "Southbound" encore, where Susan takes an extra run at the guitar break.  The Cowboy classic "All My Friends" is appropriate for the annual NYC Peachhead Reunion, and it is played beautifully.

The highlight of the whole show might be the massive "Mountain Jam>Smokestack Lightning>Mountain Jam" sandwich, an epic journey that travels though many different musical landscapes before bringing it all back home for the big finish.
