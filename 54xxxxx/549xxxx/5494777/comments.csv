I take it, it comes with .net 4?"

,cyberneticjazz,2010-04-14T08:26Z,"Listen theree is a much (IMHO) easier way to get this: Just download the ultimate trial from the microsoft website, install it, goto change/upgrade then use the following key to activate it:

YCFHQ9DWCYDKV88T2TMHG7BHP

I did this yesterday and then found the key online and that seems to be ok for me 

Im not sure but it definately works for ULTIMATE/ NOT SURE about PRO. Peace out"
,neetz,2010-04-14T09:34Z,"il try to download tonight and will see if all working without the key lol else would use the key that -cyberneticjazz posted , please seed people :)"
[T],torrentshredder,2010-04-14T09:47Z,"so you are postings works by some other people (tkiso), so why not posting their full information and bits.

that way people could follow and check this release and you wouldnt need to have make claims about something being legit or not or real deal or whatever.

this stuff is as good as tkiso makes it. nothing else.

other than that you need to make your own release, acquiring software on your own means and with your own sources and make your own claims.

that way people could judge you and your work.

but what you post here is a work by tkiso, and people will need to judge their work and efforts.

simple as that. dont know what your problem is.

dont take credit or make claims about other peoples work if you are not part of it and not involved.

cheers."

,avseq,2010-04-15T12:08Z,"I just finished installing this release.

It is indeed the untouched MSDN iso, the CRC and SHA-1 values from MSDN matches with this one.

CRC: 0xB22E6250

It doesn't need a serial. As aoloffline said, just click next, next,....

However, MSDN Library IS NOT included in this release.

@rarrar...
There isn't (and won't be) any 64 bit version of VS2010. This version can obviously compile 64 bit code, just like VS2008."

,gent323,2010-04-18T10:45Z,"Hi guys,

I am running Windows 7 Ultimate x64. I downloaded the trial from microsoft website and installed it, now when I go to maintenance mode to try to put the serial from this page (YCFHQ9DWCYDKV88T2TMHG7BHP), it does not give me anywhere to put the serial.

How can I fix this? If I download this torrent, is it any different than the direct microsoft download? Will this torrent give me the space to paste the serial in the maintenance mode?

Please help. thanks!"
,avseq,2010-04-18T11:27Z,"@gent323
Please read previous posts before posting, it is clearly stated that this release of VS2010 doesn't need a CD key.
I don't know about VS2010 trial, but I had this problem with VS2008 trial. It had let me upgrade to Pro version in WinXP/Vista in maintenance mode, but in Win7(x64) it wouldn't let me. The field for serial was just not there. I think you can solve this issue by editing the ISO. Open the file Setup\setup.sdb with notepad, search for the section containing the phrase [Product Key], replace the key present there with YCFHQ9DWCYDKV88T2TMHG7BHP and save the ISO. Then do a fresh install."
,xXx-2010,2010-04-18T16:50Z,"This is VS2010 rtm or copies of evaluation or trial?

,mrsnerd,2010-04-25T00:36Z,"@avseq please read gent323 post in full before posting.  He clearly states that his troubles are with the Visual Studio downloaded from Microsoft, and he hasn't even downloaded this iso yet."
,avseq,2010-04-25T07:39Z,"@mrsnerd
Well, he/she could obviously read previous posts about the serial requirement. That's what I pointed out.
And about his problem with trial from MS, I think I tried to help him.
Finally, your comment doesn't make any sense to me."

,namshub,2011-02-05T01:14Z,"just a reminder, if you're using zonealarm:
go to:
'Program Control'
'Main'
set 'SmartDefense Advisor' to Manual
(this makes every program ask you for permission to use the net. don't worry, you can make any choices permanent so you don't keep getting bugged every 5 minutes)
***********BUT***********
if you're using any ms s/w, such as this,
you'll want to go to
'Advanced'
in
'SmartDefense Advisor'
and uncheck the
'Allow certified MS programs to run automatically'
otherwise there's really no point to using torrents cuz something'll phone home and then you'll be F*@ked!"
,aqw212,2011-02-10T19:41Z,"I downloaded this and when I mounted the ISO it had a readme inside. The readme said and I quote ""This disc contains a ""UDF"" file system and requires an operating system

SYMPTOMS:
You log on a computer by using a user name whose length is longer than 19 characters, excluding the domain name or the computer name. When you try to build a Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 project, you receive an error message that resembles the following:

Error MSB4014: The build stopped unexpectedly because of an internal failure.

I am getting a message ""The evaluation period for Microsoft Visual Studio ends in 5 days."" and ""You can get a key to extend your trial by registering this copy of Microsoft Visual Studio online.  You may also purchase a key to activate the product."" ... I thought this was pre-activated ?!? Nobody else seems to have mentioned this as a problem !!!"
,mrasshole,2011-06-23T20:16Z,"Thanks for the up, it worked perfectly, although I had already VS Express installed. Just install this, no need for crack or something. Good job!

@Stellaman: that's weird. Maybe you have another version of VS installed? Try uninstalling that first, then. For me it worked just 'out of the box'. "
,looloo1,2011-06-27T11:22Z,"Hmph thats strange... When i try and use the installer it says it cant read file ""somethingFactory"" (i think it was ""FileFactory"") I have Windows 7 x86 too... Strange :/"
,dothackjhe,2011-07-22T08:16Z,I had downloaded an installer of MS VS2010 Ultimate on another torrent pre-installed with this key: YCFHQ-9DWCY-DKV88-T2TMH-G7BHP but was prompted to buy a serial since the trial will end in few days. I think the given key most people are aware have been blacklisted thus can't be used. 
,peradjura,2011-08-10T10:59Z,"Installation halts on 1st screen, after loading files. Once you click next the installation doesnt do nothing, just stands like that.

Have tried everything, cleaned temp folder, removed what apps could interfere.

Torrent does not work. Any help would be  appreciated."

Does anyone have a solution?  I program a lot and really miss out on programming."

,HippieMagic,2011-08-25T20:49Z,Thank's for putting this on here.  The MSDN downloader is so damn painful to use.  I am on the 3rd day and it NEVER stays connected.  I swear it errors at least 50 times before it finally finishes and then it normally fails the check and deletes the file.
