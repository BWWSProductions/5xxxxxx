Listening to this album is like taking a crash course in music history, but in a good way. There's something for almost anybody somewhere on this album. "The Pimps of Joytime" use sounds and influences from everything (hip-hop, country, rock, reggae, funk, samba, rap, gospel, R&B, jazz, soul, world music, and I'm not kidding) and manage to mash this melange into a deliciously smooth album. 

With songs that are positive, affirming and infectious, it's an eclectic and consistently entertaining album that gets better every time I hear it. If you like music, there's sure to be something on "High Steppin" that will get your toes tapping, your head nodding, and your mouth smiling. All props to The Pimps of Joytime!
