but I didn't burned it on a CD., Instead I mounted it using Daemon Tools Lite, installed it ok but when I tried to launch the game, it say's ""Please insert A Bugs Life CD.

So, do I really have to burn it?
Please help me TeNNeT3!
I really have to make this work because my brother is really excited upon playing this game!
Thank You!

If there is a crack present in the mounted directory, then copy it & paste it in your installed directory...i hope it will work. Bst if luck..."

Is there anything I'm missing? I'm not quite sure where to go from this point. Please help! "
,fischkopf11,2011-08-21T19:49Z,"We need a crack for this game. When i start, it asks for an original disk... :("
,ipodmonesta,2011-09-07T21:49Z,"**FOR EVERYBODY ASKING FOR THE MISSING CD ERROR**

You'll need a program called ""Virtual ClonDrive""
google that and download it. then associate .iso files with it.
now when u need to play the game, don't run the .exe game file, run the iso file that u downloaded. really hope that works for everybody cuz when i was little i tried to play such games and never worked"
