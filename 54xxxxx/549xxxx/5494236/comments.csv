,Pothead808,2010-04-13T17:34Z,"Awesome twenty, U IS MAH FRAVORITE UPLOADER!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-13T19:20Z,"@lilars: Sure, I watch Craig for few years now. It is best Late show, exactly what I need.

@slntscrms: For extremely low bit-rates (including streaming) without any doubt and any serious competition H264/avc1/x264 (they are all the same).
Container (mp4, avi or mkv) is compatibility issue among other (internal) things. Mkv cannot be played on nothing but computers and just few stand alone devices. Avi has widest acceptance, its old container, and doesn't handle well modern and advanced video and audio COmpressors/DECompressors (such the ones I use). MP4 container offers pretty much everything users really need and mp4 is the most adopted by new and latest devices.
So..."
