MAC OS X


FROM APPLE.COM

CrossOver Mac lets you install many popular Windows applications and games on your Intel-based Mac running OS X. You can open Windows files directly within your file browser or from email attachments--without the need for a Windows license. There's no rebooting or switching to a virtual machine. As far as your Windows applications are concerned, CrossOver is a complete replacement for the Windows operating system.
CrossOver includes an easy-to-use, single-click interface that makes installing Windows software simple and fast. Just insert an install CD in your Mac and CrossOver will recognize it and offer to begin the installation process. It then completes the installation and configures your application to run on your Mac. That's all there is to it.
