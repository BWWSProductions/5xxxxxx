Metal Slug PC Collection is a compilation of seven classic arcade games from
the Metal Slug franchise including Metal Slug, Metal Slug 2, Metal Slug X,
Metal Slug 3, Metal Slug 4, Metal Slug 5, and Metal Slug 6.

Each of the games included in this compilation ran on the NEOGEO AES
hardware with the exception of Metal Slug 6, which ran on the Atomiswave
arcade hardware.

In each of the games, players proceed through a scrolling, run-and-gun
action fest taking out enemies and saving hostages. The more hostages that
are saved, the larger the bonus at the end of the level. When a player dies,
they lose all of the hostages that they have saved earlier in the level.
Players can access vehicles, obtain new weapons, and gain other power-up as
they progress through the levels.

Some of the games include multiple branches, secret paths, and other bonuses
that create extra reply value.
