This isn't an Alastair Sim movie though he does appear in this movie albeit in 

an uncredited part. 

Despite its lighthearted title, Lady Godiva Rides Again is a fairly potent 

indictment of the darker side of beauty contests. Waitress Marjorie (Pauline 

Stroud) enters one competition after another, hoping for fame and fortune. She 

manages to make the finals of a "Lady Godiva" contest, never suspecting that 

the outcome has been rigged. By accident, Marjorie wins First Prize, a huge 

sum of money and a movie contract. Alas, she hasn't the talent to parlay her 

win into a lasting career, and soon Marjorie is scrounging around for any 

"girlie show" job she can find. Only when reduced to performing nude in a 

French cabaret review is Marjorie rescued by her Australian boyfriend Larry 

Burns (John McCallum), who makes her promise to stop all this nonsense and 

settle down to domesticity. The well-chosen cast includes Dennis Price as a 

lascivious movie star and Stanley Holloway and Gladys Henson as the girl's 

nonplus ed parents. Featured in smaller roles are such future leading ladies as 

Kay Kendall, Diana Dors, Dagmar (later Dana) Wynter and, in an uncredited bit, 

Joan Collins.ALso an appearance from Ruth Ellis (who was the last person to be 

hanged in Britain in 1955) as one of the beauty contestants.
