A new single Aurora is on the way we wasn..t able to release it before the end of last year as promised, but it will be out shortly. A part of the delay is sadly that Annelie has decided to leave Disco Digitale due to personal reasons. We are parting at the best of friends and we will probably hear Anneile again as a guest singer on some future song. We wish her all the best and she will always be apart of Disco Digitale. 

We also wants to present some happier news and that is our new member Emma Hogander. Emma joind our crew in middle of december 2007 and we have recently finished recording her voice on the new single Aurora. We have also performed our first live gig with Emma so check out the pictures section on our webpage for images of us as the new band.
