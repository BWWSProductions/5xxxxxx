Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



If anyone enjoys the music of 'The Replacements', then you will enjoy seeing this musical documentary from the one and only Paul Westerberg, lead singer and songwriter from The Replacements. The video and audio is NOT slick and perfect as much of it is captured by fans during concerts. This video is for fans of the 'Mats and Westerberg and may NOT be something to win NEW fans to the fold. For the fans - ENJOY! ;D 

I wanted to see this DVD for a LONG time and couldn't find it anywhere to download, so I finally purchased it dirt cheap used off Amazon. If you download and enjoy this film (or not), go and purchase yourself a full DVD copy for around $4 and show your support for Paul Westerberg.
