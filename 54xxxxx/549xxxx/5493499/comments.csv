,gkotse,2010-04-13T13:56Z,Looks like it is re-encoded. The quality is lower than the usual releases of 175MB.
,zoundieP,2010-04-14T06:58Z,"Yes, gkotse, it has been re-encoded. It's a smaller file hence the ""SD"" in the title. If you were looking for a hidef version, go check out http://eztv.it as they get great caps up really fast.

Thanks for paying attention though."
