My thanks to the original seed of the ISO Disc Image from which this was made.   EMI Holland have just re issued a series of 1970 to 1990 Hits and all I have done is keeping the original quality, split the files into music tracks and named and tagged them for playback on a PC or MAC.   This lot is ready for import onto Ots Studio or any Discotheque video software of your choice.

Enjoy!
