,uzalu,2010-04-18T22:35Z,"hi, theres alot of bluster in this installation, which seems to come to nothing. Im sure i have done something wrong, because when i use both methods (following instructions to the letter) the launcher for the game tells me it needs an internet connection. i'll write back if anything changes. thanks."
,uzalu,2010-04-18T22:37Z,"scrub last, it gets past that now, thanks!"

,JadeBoy,2010-04-24T07:29Z,"Get the SKIDROW release, you don't have to do anything with that"
,uzalu,2010-05-02T16:42Z,"This worked fine for me, i used the second method, just follow the instructions :)

advise downloading in conjunction with http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5413868/Assassin_s_Creed_2_ISO_crack .

also, you have to close skype (and probably others) for 'server.exe' to work. 

win7 3.16 ghz dual core ati 3850 gpu, so you know."
,ficious,2010-05-07T10:11Z,"It works fine, I can play the game and it's pretty awesome, but for some reason the save games aren't created. 

The folder in C:/Program Files /Ubisoft /Ubisoft Game Launcher/ storage/ bW5pb3N14 where the save games are supposedly kept hasn't been created; even the storage folder doesn't exist.

It's a bit of a long game to play in one sitting, so any advice on how to get it to save would be appreciated. Thanks."
,ficious,2010-05-07T10:20Z,"Strike my last, I ran the program as administrator on win 7 and it created the save files just fine."
,potay,2010-05-15T05:04Z,"I have this error""An internet connection is required to play this game ..."". Help"
,markolo87,2010-05-20T21:58Z,"I don't have that hosts file,and I can't play the game,it says ""invalid username and password"". what should I do?"
,babel55,2010-05-22T23:10Z,"Just all use the second option, it works fine for me. Just follow the instructions right, if it fails, try again. If it fails again, use another Crack."
