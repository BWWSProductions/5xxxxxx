These people are going to be destroyed."
[T],Quazza,2010-04-13T21:36Z,They certainly will be destroyed...I'm sure that the American people will see to it that the filth is disinfected.
,unomyname,2010-04-13T22:01Z,"Thank you Quazza, 
This was quick. 

Another example how competition makes it better for consumers :)-|-E"
[T],Quazza,2010-04-14T00:31Z,"BTW,

My brain exploded today when I heard the lady crying about her lack of high-speed internet.

I actually had to turn off the show and walk away for a few minutes because I couldn't handle it."
,Mhockey1505,2010-04-14T05:46Z,quazza! how dare you! that was the funniest part of the show in the last month... i listened to it 3 times on my iPod
,BarrySoetoro,2010-04-14T05:51Z,"Pat cracked me up today... just hammering this woman at every opportunity.

Mocking people is perfectly acceptable as long as you're providing relevant arguments at the same time."
[T],Quazza,2010-04-14T09:43Z,Oh it was funny...that's exactly why I had to walk away!
,hopegone,2010-04-14T15:06Z,"@unomyname  

and the competition is what exactly?"
,hopegone,2010-04-14T15:08Z,lack of high speed internet cannot compare to the lack of big screen flat tvs in EVERY room especially for those who carry forward a five digit balance on credit cards
