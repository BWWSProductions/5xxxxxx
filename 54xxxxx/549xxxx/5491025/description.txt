Kings of Leonâ€™s sold-out three-night stand at Londonâ€™s O2 Arena will be the subject of the Followill clanâ€™s first DVD,
Live at the O2 London, England, due out November 10th. The DVD itself was filmed on June 30th, 2009, with the band
rocking out in front of a packed house of 18,000 fans. The 22-song set list hits on all four of the Kingsâ€™ albums,
stretching from â€œMollyâ€™s Chambersâ€ to â€œBe Somebodyâ€ and all those essential tracks in between. For the technologically
advanced, Live at the O2 London, England will also be released on Blu-ray on November 24th.


As Rolling Stone previously reported, Kings of Leon have also recruited Justin Timberlake, Pharrell Williams, Mark
Ronson, Lykki Li and Linkin Park for an upcoming remix album the AMA-nominated Kings have in the works. The former
Rolling Stone cover boys have also been sound-checking eight to ten new songs recently. If the band wasnâ€™t busy
enough, Caleb Followill will also guest-judge on an upcoming episode of Iron Chef: America.
