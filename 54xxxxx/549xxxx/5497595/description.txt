A promotional recording, or promo (recently known as a radio single), is a recording issued on vinyl, CD, cassette tape, VHS, or DVD and distributed free in order to promote a commercial recording. Promos are usually sent out to music radio and television stations, music journalists and reviewers in advance of the official release date so that their reviews will appear in the current publications, and DJs. They are often distributed in plain white packaging, without the text or artwork that appears on the commercial version. Typically a promo is marked with some variation of the following text: "Licensed for promotional use only. Sale is prohibited." It may also state: "Item is to be returned to the distributor upon demand."
