I made this keylogger because I was sick of my AV or SpyBot picking up on and deleting commercial keyloggers I was trying to use.

This keylogger is unrecognized by all virus scanners tested by VirusTotal.com

Features:

 - No installation necessary.

 - Logs can be uploaded to a FTP server.

 - Can capture screen shots.

 - Logs all keystrokes made on the computer as well as the title of the window
   the keystrokes are made in. Captures passwords and all other invisible text.

 - Can record all text which is copied to the clipboard 
   (whenever Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X etc is pressed).

 - Has an invisibility mode as well as user interface. Can be hidden on
   startup. Restoring visibility can be password protected.


Is not currently working on Windows 7 64bit, But I am working on this.

How to use:

      - Move Steel.exe to desired location.
      - Run Steel.exe.
      - Customize options to your liking.

Help Needed:
- I would appreciate a help file written in notepad that would explain some basics to a new user
- I could do with one more beta tester. Send me an email with why you would be good at it.

Thanks to Leon, hes been a complete legend at testing and has great suggestions.
