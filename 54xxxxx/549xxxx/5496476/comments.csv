,Super_Saiyan_Link,2010-04-17T08:43Z,Now I see why not all of the anti malware apps can catch these kinds of programs... This proves it. Can't wait for the email feature and 64 Bit Windows 7 support. Is this a portable app by any chance?
,_Smithy_,2010-04-17T09:40Z,"It does not work with any 64 bit system at this stage. I am working with someone to try and fix this because I do not have a 64 bit system to test it on. Email support isn't too far away either.

@PwrdbyWoody: The number pad should work. Please contact me if it doesn't so I can make it work with your system.
@Super_Saiyan_Link: Virus scanners can't detect it simply because they have not been programmed to. I am unsure what you mean by portable app sorry"

Basically that's what it is. I don't plan to use it on a flash drive or another portable device, I just don't want it making registry entries really."
,jmwho,2010-04-17T16:50Z,Great logger!! Smithy can't wait till it works with windows 7.. thanks for sharing
,Kaemos,2010-04-17T19:26Z,hey it does work for win 7 x64 lol i got my sister's pws for my mom this way xD great for school computers too
,Kaemos,2010-04-17T19:34Z,i just had an issue where i couldnt get it to unhude but i hit ctrl-alt-8 lol not f8 and it worked im running win 7 x64
,Kaemos,2010-04-17T19:50Z,ok lol im sorry last comment but what file format are those screenshots saved as?
,_Smithy_,2010-04-18T00:39Z,"IMPORTANT: Forgot to mention. Unhide is now Ctrl + Alt + 8 by default. The F8 part sometimes interfered with software already on the computer. Thanks for mentioning kaemos.

@SuperSaiyan. It can be run via portable drive etc, but there are a few registry values. It has to have some to automatically start with windows. These are all removed if you self destruct the keylogger. I will try and reduce the number, Thanks.
@Kaemos: Please email me. Would love to do some tests on your computer to see how it worked. The images are compressed jpegs.

If you like it please seed. The number of seeders and comments are all I have to go by for whether or not it is liked. Thanks."

Upon opening Task Manager it shows as Steel.exe and a simple search with Google shows this as a key-logger. NOT what we need to happen. Needing this for checking a certain comp here at home and CAN NOT afford to have this detected. Thanks."

,gorrin79,2010-04-27T01:35Z,"hi Smithy, wow such great job, congrats for this wonderful tool, i can only complain about the screen capture, it were cooler if you can configure it like this for example, instead of capture every 30-60 seconds one option that the capture activates with ""enter"" or some keywords, that's much to ask!!! but still i think the one of the most rockings apps!"

works well....thanks...."
,kappahjay,2010-04-27T12:20Z,"Hi Smithy,

first of all, nice job. secondly, it works fine. thirdly, ftp upload is fantastic. 

However, i have a little problem. First, the program does not start with windows, even when you click on the option in preferences. It always pops up when windows starts asking you to run it. It does not automatically start and run on its on. Is this a general problem or its only peculiar to me?"
,Balaji_55,2010-04-27T18:02Z,"@kappahjay:
it needs administrative rights
first of all exit the program(better using task manager)
then right click on program and select 'run as administrator' option and then try"
,kappahjay,2010-04-28T18:13Z,"@Balaji_55

Thanks for the tip. I will try it out"
,fredsell,2010-04-29T14:37Z,"Smithy, this is amazing
this is so fucking awesome really. 

Best features:
1) free
2) password protect (combine this with renaming the file and noone knows what the program is even if they delete it)
3) undetected by virus scanners
4) no install (quickly slipping it onto a system has never been easier) 

THANK YOU! P.s. I have tried all features, execpt for a slight glitch with the screen capture at first (working now) everything is 100% [Vista buisness 32 bit]"

,Super_Saiyan_Link,2010-05-08T06:29Z,"Why request a readme? Personally I like the tooltips just fine, besides people will complain they don't know how to do something and not even bother with the readme and the tooltip will pop up whatever it is they need help with.

,Mikek1993,2010-05-09T00:18Z,"Just a thought, but it would be cool if you could set it up so that you don't have to re-enter the settings when you put this on a different computer."
,xVORTEXx,2010-05-09T11:28Z,"I have a few suggestions:
1)make less convenient icon this looks way too fancy if found it might be suspected.
2)File properties>details reveals that its steel.exe even if you rename it. good name would be svchost.exe nvvsvc.exe etc similar..
3)try to avoid word keylogger anywhere except this page description (like in program options, folder name etc)
i hope this helps :)"

hey for every1 and you:P maby for your next version of this perfect keylogger:P

i did the keylogger in a map in c:/system/programfiles 

gave it the name: %SystemRoot%\System32

changed the icon: in a broken file or something

in that map i did the logs too but if you have the logs in that map and you dont want that some1 is going to find it?? click with the left click on it and the proportions (sry for english) then hide map...
btw only the map self and not the other in itt becuz otherwise the keylogger cant find it anymore.
to see your logs just press your unhide key and press show loggs :D

,johnnybgood888,2010-05-18T21:22Z,"Hi Smithy,

Nice product- every review I've seen has been really positive....

But I seem to have been experiencing some kind of glitch... Screen shot is working fine but the actual keylogging doesn't seem to work right.... For instance, when I type ""test"" in notepad- it records ""es"" but nothing else.... If I write a sentence, it records random letters in the sequence.....

Any idea for a cure?"
,_Smithy_,2010-05-21T08:56Z,"@johnnybgood888: This is a very common problem if more than one instance of the keylogger is running. Make sure you haven't renamed a copy of steel and have it running also.
@Everyone with the screenshot error. Thanks for your feedback, It has been fixed.

Nearly finished the next version with email support. Just have to get it working with FTP. Should I release a buggy beta or wait until I have it working better?
Thanks to everyone for support! Smithy."
,GYNAECO,2010-05-21T13:27Z,"Thanks for writing this enormeous usefull piece of software. It worked straight out of the box...I'm just having some trouble with ftp settings. I made them and tested them (test doc came trough good).

Then I set the app to report once a day, but now I'm not receiving anything on ftp. PC reporting works just fine though... It saves the files where I told it to save them.

Anyways... I think maybe I filled something in wrong so I will look at it when I get home again.

Thanx again! Awesome app!"

On another note as someone said before, a way of transferring the program along with the settings would be good.

Another thing i noticed is i had a problem with the naming conventions, it seems to go by date then the number of lines .. not sure exactly where the number comes from but im already seeing duplicates. And when there is duplicates it cant upload to drive Hq and will either overwrite or not write at all on local."
