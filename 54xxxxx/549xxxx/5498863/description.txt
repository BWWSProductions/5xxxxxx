Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties.

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible.

On with the update release information:

Supreme Commander 2 Update 6
============================

New Features

New AI categories are now available via the Skirmish or
Multi-player lobby menu:

Air: Focuses on Air units.

Land: Focuses on Land units.

Rush: Focuses on large amounts of land units and less on
defense.

Balanced: Balanced between Land and Air.

Naval: Focuses on Naval units.

Turtle: Focuses on defenses and Experimentals.

Random: Chooses one of the above based on various factors.

Added the Steam avatar for each player on the multiplayer
summary screen: This will let players click on the avatar
image and access that player's Steam profile. From there, they
can add that player to their friends list if they've had a
good match

Added Mic Icons display in game when bringing up the in game
score menu (F2) allowing players to mute individual players

Improvements

Added anti-cheating code that will detect modified lua files
and prevent playing with unmodified users. This also prevents
achievement and leaderboard updates. Still permits playing
with others who have identically modified their games.

Disconnections in Ranked: The game now tracks the number of
disconnects a player has during Ranked 1v1 matches. If you
exceed a certain percentage of disconnects to games played,
they will count as losses instead of wins.

AI Improvements:

The AI will no longer get stuck in its startup build sequence
if rushed or if there are build restrictions in place.

The AI will choose an appropriate archetype based on unit
restrictions.

If a unit type is restricted the AI will act as though the
unit does not exist in the game.

AI will now group units based on their target enemy's threat.

AI will now group experimentals based on their target enemy's
threat.

If the victory condition is Assassination we are artificially
inflating the Neural Net data to make attacking the ACU more
desirable for both Land and Air units.

AI can now respond to being attacked my Nukes or Artillery,
even if it cannot see where it is coming from.

Fixed a bug where threat build conditions were not being used.

The AI should no longer attempt to send attack platoons to
unpathable areas.

The AI will hold back units until it thinks it has enough to
make a push based on defensive intelligence.

Fixed an issue where the AI would constantly pull units back
to attack an expansion base instead of pushing forward.

The AI will no longer build more than 3 transports unless it
has land units and it is not a land map.

Added AI response to make a land AI get land unit AA upgrades
if the enemy has air units.

The Naval AI will not build more than 3 subs unless the enemy
has Naval.

If Research is disabled the AI will not build research
facilities.

The AI will add a small amount of threat to all enemy start
locations so it knows where to find them.

Platoons will try to only attack areas where they think they
can do enough damage before dying.

The AI will react to enemy TML, artillery, or Experimentals by
building more shields and placing them closer together.

The AI should send a more appropriate number of units based on
enemy threat.

AI will build and use Mass Convertors.

If the closest enemy to the AI is a lot weaker than the other
enemies the AI will focus on the weak enemy.

The AI's air units will wait longer before re-evaluating which
target to attack.

The AI's NUC will now check for pathability before firing
units.

The AI's Nuke Launcher will now check for pathability before
firing.

You can now select which AI type you would like to play
against from the dropdown in the game lobby (random is still
an option).

AI will build factory shield upgrades more often, not just
when the enemy has air.

Factory upgrades now have a threat value.

AI should react better to an enemy having nukes.

AI will not build research stations if it already has
everything researched.

AI will not build a mass convertor until it has enough energy
to convert.

Added bigger Air and Land platoons.

When a build item has a resource type of All the AI will use
Slush first.

Added build conditions to check for current target enemy
threat.

AI air scout platoons will now path around threat as much as
possible.

Mass convertor research is now a higher priority for the
Turtle AI.

Changed some threat evaluation when deciding where to attack.

AI will build fewer MMLs and Mobile Artillery.

Added a new function to store the victory condition for the
AI.

When an AI unit dies it will add threat to the instigator's
location to warn other units.

Added some anti-turtle measures.

Fix for units that were built outside of the AIs base not
being used.

Fix for AI not using its full base radius.

Land AIs on Island maps should build Air factories to build
transports.

AI should send platoons when it is at unit cap, no matter
what.

AI will space out naval factories more to prevent blockage.

The Ranked maps have been updated to

Markon Bridge

Clark Training Center

Coalition Ship Yard

Arctic Refuge

Open Palms

Finn's Revenge

Fixes

Fixed units arriving from Space Temple teleport immunity to
Magnetron effects

Fixed Engineer pathfinding in crowded conditions

Fixes for occasional crash if Client disconnects at the same
moment Host launches Ranked game

Fix for Crash / Soft Locked: Players can get soft-locked in
the 'Starting Game' screen if other players disconnect when
matchmaking begins 'Starting Game'

Backspace will reveal all characters in the edit box when you
have more characters than the visible section

Tuning and Balancing

Capturing units now provides the same experience as killing
them
