The passer-by would be forgiven for thinking that jazz music was at one time cursed to be populated by drug addicts, alcoholics and sad figures. 



Clifford Brown, however, was none of these. Instead he was a budding genius who lived a clean life, but still died young, aged 25. He died in a car crash and wasnâ€™t even behind the wheel. Seems that the spirit of jazz was gonna get him anyway.



This excellent album features tenor saxophonist Harold Land, pianist Richie Powell and bassist George Morrow. Max Roach accompanies the group brilliantly on drums, and itâ€™s hard bop to the max, courtesy of one band that could have reached the heights in time. Now you can learn what all the fuss was about.
