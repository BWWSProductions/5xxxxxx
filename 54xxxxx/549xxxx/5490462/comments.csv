BTW, LOL for that..."
,laptopdog,2010-04-11T16:14Z,"Thanks so much for continuing to download this show.. between this and Doctor Who, i'm in Britsish TV heaven... So much appreciation, twentyforty - I like it here!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-11T19:02Z,"@laptopdog: Yeah, but Dr. is in HDTV and A2A not, what bothers me. I know, HDTV shooting equipment is expensive, BUT why A2A producers have decided to release past seasons as BluRay if all series is ""old"", plain format, prepared for airing as PDTV (720x576)?

I have warned people last week than 3x01 720p looks as upscaled PDTV and I was right, unfortunately. I screamed about on some site and FoV haven't tried the same prank as last week, what in turn resulted in my dropping A2A from weekly schedule. Hence, quality of these encodings would be lower, but file-size is smaller 2.4 times and we must tolerate that."
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-11T22:42Z,"BTW, laptopdog, I am surprised how much better is this season than the previous one. "
,laptopdog,2010-04-13T05:45Z,"This season is fantastic so far, isn't it - I agree with you! Much darker than the last one.. it's surprised me too. I think it's really smart of them to return to a focus on Sam Tyler and what happened there.. I *cannot wait* to find out what they come up with!"
