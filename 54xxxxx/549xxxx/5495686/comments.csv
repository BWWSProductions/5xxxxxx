,gianis777,2010-04-15T01:04Z,"Very Bad quality (way lower than cell phones quality), no widescreen, bad sound quality :(

Still thatnks for uploading ;)"
,DeltaPan,2010-04-15T16:49Z,"Thanks Den.

Dunno who fracking encoded this though, worst i've seen an Xvid under an hour playtime and over 350Mb, ever.

I'm no quality snob but that's atrocious man, audio track was worst i've heard for that filesize as well.

But then again, as fabiomoron at 2010-04-14 19:11 CET: says, good enough for NXT.

Show is utter crap!

[Who actually pays for tickets to go and see it is beyond me, should be boycotted until WWE corporate understands what they've done and changes back to a decent show format, nothing wrong with giving new wrestlers a platform but really, this crap show is mind numbingly inane.]

Bring back ECW and put Paul E Dangerously back in charge of it!!!

Then WWE would have a solid winner, a top class show again for that slot, NXT is utter pants and then some.

Peace. : )"
,DeltaPan,2010-04-15T17:06Z,"I think it was a re-encode of a cyberlocker MP4 which encoding that to XviD would not improve quality, hence the filesize is more than a scene release properly capped to raw .avi and encoded to XviD.

Could be wrong but that's what i thnk was done here, quality is atrocious because source file was bad, then released as an XviD scene cap, which i deffo ain't.

Whoever did it, please don't bother again, just upload the damn MP4, it would have been lower filesize.

Peace. : )"

,richo1007,2010-04-16T01:09Z,"shit quality. watched 1st 5 mins then deleted it

@deltapan i actually like this show, its something different. if you dont take it too seriously and get passed all the botches and poor wrestling it can be quite entertaining. It something new and im preferring it 2 raw atm"
