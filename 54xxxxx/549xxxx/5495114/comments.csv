,dardar6t9,2010-04-14T09:49Z,"I'm in need....My ex-wife commited suicide and I have done my back in 6 places thru work,still gotta try and raise them and put up with never-ending pain.....Screw the Haitians"

,Bombardem,2010-04-14T10:18Z,if I was your wife I'd commit suicide too...
,FSmonster,2010-04-14T10:59Z,"I notice that Raymondhome never actually credits the makers of the movie..... all his little buddies get a right proper felching, but not the people who actually contributed.

I wonder if Buddha is comfortable with you thieving from others to proseletyse for him ?

Hey dont get me wrong, were all thieves here... just some of us are sanctimonius, delusional wankers like your man raymond here."
,rathanek,2010-04-14T15:27Z,"Ramobdhome, please disregard all these negative comment. Keep up the good work. However, I do agree. We should all thank the makers. :)"
,paulderby,2010-04-14T17:54Z,Which is better? This or Classified?? 
,ExhamPriory,2010-04-14T18:33Z,"Hey guys.
I notice more and more that these comment sections are turning into chat blogs rather than informative details about the torrent in question. There are TONS of places to go Gab like girls, why not throw the occasional relevant statement about the DL in while you download all this shit for free?

V: ?
A: ?

(  monsters comment I felt did have some belonging here, though I don't agree with the negativity and insults [in this particular case]  Raymondhome, I love all the sharing you do and a lot of your uploads are good quality. Whether or not you give all props due is your own choice, but I dont think it makes you a ""delusional wanker"". man brits piss me off anyways)

So....   A / V ANYONE???"

,peturx,2010-05-10T14:31Z,tanks bro XD
,hawkeseye,2010-05-12T07:14Z,rankscutter use this ConvertXtoDVD 4 v4.0.10.324 Final (incl crack) from gangmie.
,mrdirectorman,2010-06-07T07:40Z,"Alright folks I'm bringing something totally new to the TS table and I know this is the forum to ask for it. Movies are awesome in 3d but to TS in the theatre wouldn't work UNLESS THE MOVIE IS FILMED TWICE THROUGH EACH SIDE OF THE GLASSES PROVIDED AT THE THEATRE. This could later be recombined IN FULL COLOR by a 3d TV or even color encoded for Anaglyph (blue/red). Now this TS should be performed from the SAME SEAT FOR THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT EYE! Provide both Right and Left videos to us separately (in one torrent) so people can mess around with different 3d formats. THIS IS REAL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE AN HD CAMCORDER YOU CAN GET US AVATAR IN 3D MUCH SOONER THAN WAITING FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE. Movies to capture: Alice In Wonderland, Clash of the Titans, How to Train Your Dragon, and if you are fortunate enough to have AVATAR near you please get this on the net!
By the way, THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO HAS AN UPLOAD RATIO!"
,PrinceDastan,2010-06-08T11:50Z,Does this movie have subtitle? where can i get english subtitle that suitable for this movie?
,PrinceDastan,2010-06-19T13:37Z,"the movie was recorded in a cinema. you can see a shadow of a man standing in the middle of the movie. so it is not good for me but still you can watch it if you like.

A=8
V=5"
