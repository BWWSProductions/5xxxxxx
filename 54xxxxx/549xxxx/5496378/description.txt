        alive, but shot in the back; Bernard was killed at the  scene.
        Bea and Kate operate on Rose  to remove the bullet and all  of
        the women provide items for  them to use in the  surgery, even
        Verna. When  Rose wakes  up, she  is paralysed  from the waist
        down. Yamauchi and Miss Hasan try to find out how she kept  in
        contact  with Bernard.  Blanche finds  it hard  to visit  Rose
        after the shooting. Shinya tells Dorothy that one of the women
        informed  on Rose  and everyone  suspects Christina  of being
        responsible. She is put before the disciplinary committee  and
        gets back a Not Proven verdict. Marion catches Lillian  giving
        Bobby unusual food items and realises she was the informer, to
        get extra food for Bobby.

Proper Notes:

FTP used stereo for Mono: On Part 1 bad Resolution of 368 x 272
Honestly why do they use so many diff resolutions in 1 series?

368 x 272 - 512 x 384 - 528 x 400 - 560 x 416 - 544 x 416 - 464 x 352

Oh well enjoy the Propers
