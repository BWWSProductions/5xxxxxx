On the eve of the critical battle of Cedynia (972 AD), the Polish ruler Mieszko falls ill; when a witch is summoned to treat him, he feverishly reflects on the turning points of his reign, including his assumption of the throne (against the wishes of his dying father, who preferred Mieszko's brother), and the politics that led to his baptism as the first Christian Polish monarch (largely to enjoy the perks of an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor Otto I).
