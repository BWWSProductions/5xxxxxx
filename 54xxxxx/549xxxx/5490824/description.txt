Towards the end of his illustrious 'career' Terence pioneered a form of performance art, where he spoke/chanted/channeled with musical backup from the Techno Tribal Trance Dance Maui band, Lost at Last.

These performances took place at the Maritime Hall in San Francisco, CA on 12/12/98 and a venue in Maui, Hawaii on 03/15/98

I've been shooting video practically every day since 1987, starting with 8mm, Hi8 beginning 1989, DV in 1996, HDV in 2005. Started VJing in 1989, and pioneered many techniques in that world, including early Blendo vids with Billy Idol and Peter Gabriel. Was a founding editor with DV Magazine and the secret identity behind the pubs industry snoop, Max Bloodhound.

I am now a partner in a Santa Cruz based media company, www. awake.net, and love evolving the cinematic language and experimenting with high def.
