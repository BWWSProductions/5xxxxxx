Extra info:
This one off many Mix tape's me and my friends got off the various DJ's in Clubs..
many DJ's sold tapes they recorded during there set. (in Club IT amsterdam they used 3 Tape-decks at once)


Used for Recording:
AKAI HQ Tape-deck connected (analog) to a SONY MD recorder what converts the analog input to a digital signal
witch i used for recording, used a PC with a Audigy2 sound-card.
Used Sony Sound-forge 9 for the recordings and Mastering.
Tried to give them a clear sound.. think they sound OK.. remember these are Cassette tapes and some of them are more then 17 years old...
