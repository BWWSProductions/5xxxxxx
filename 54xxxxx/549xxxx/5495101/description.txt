"Hell-O"

Fresh off their monumental win at Sectionals, New Directions 
is on top of the world. With an extra spring in their step, 
they get to work on new numbers for Regionals. But when 
Rachel and Finn's budding romance hits a bump in the road 
after she becomes involved with a competitor, Jesse St. 
James (guest star Groff), it threatens to derail the entire 
club. Mr. Schuester pays a visit to Shelby Corcoran (guest 
star Menzel), coach of Vocal Adrenaline, to confirm Jesse's 
motives. Meanwhile, Will is newly single, but is he ready to 
take his relationship with Emma to the next level? And to 
top it all off, Sue Sylvester returns from her condo in Boca 
with a renewed focus on destroying Will and disbanding the 
glee club.

Enjoy :)
