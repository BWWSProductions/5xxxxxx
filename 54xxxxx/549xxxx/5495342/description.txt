Ajami is the religiously mixed community of Muslims and Christians in Tel Aviv. These are five stories about the everyday life in Ajami. A great story about small hopes and dreams in an average-Israeli-reality in which no one is sacred. A story involving cops, corruption, drugs, weapons, love, siblings, illegal immigrants and fastfood - everything you'll find in the cities these days. 
Nominated for Oscar. Another 13 wins & 5 nominations

Spoken languages: Hebrew and arabic.
Subtititles: English

I downloaded the movie from TPB and included the subtitles file (.srt) that I found somewhere else. The subtitles aren't always 100% and they are partially on top of the hebrew subtitles (when they speak arabic), but they are good enough. 
Plays in VLC-player. 

This movie is definitely worth to watch!!! I think the story is great and has a surprising twist.
