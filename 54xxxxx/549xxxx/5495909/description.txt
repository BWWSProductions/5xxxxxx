Tortured Females" is one of few surviving films distributed by super-cheap Mitam Productions, which was essentially like a west coast version of New York City's Distribpix. It's also the most entertaining feature on this disc. While there are a few too many striptease acts substituted for torture (shades of Steve Apostolof's ORGY OF THE DEAD), this is a fantastically kooky unearthed treasure. In the style of Dale Berry's films, dialogue is spoken while the actors don't move their mouths, there is lots of rugged outdoor photography, and a dimly lit house is made up to look like an unconvincing dungeon. In the most demented plot point, the naked bloody girls are tended to by (swear to God) a mutated Mongolian hunchback who speaks in sped-up Chipmunk-sound chattering! He feeds the girls like dogs, relishes being whipped by Mr. Big and has to bury the dead captives in shallow graves when they croak from too much torture. Despite the film appearing to be cut (a lesbian rape seems to be missing), this is a perverse journey well worth taking...
