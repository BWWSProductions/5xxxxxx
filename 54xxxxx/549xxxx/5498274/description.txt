"White Tulip" 

When passengers aboard a commuter train appear to have 
died a still death, it seems that a switch was flipped 
because all cell phones, mp3 players, laptops, 
batteries and bodies have been drained of power. As 
the Fringe team assembles at the bizarre crime scene, 
Peter remains suspicious that something is amiss with 
Walter, who is struggling to keep the unimaginable a 
secret. When the investigation leads them to Alistair 
Peck (guest star Weller), a very powerful man who has 
tremendous energy with severe consequences, an ironic 
set of circumstances surface.

Enjoy :)
