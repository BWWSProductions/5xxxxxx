,Kohls81,2010-04-26T20:42Z,"This is S07E08...""Juggalo""  You can find the real S07E07 uploaded as S07E06, and as far as I can tell all of the other ones uploaded by TvTeam are the same way.  They must've skipped ep01 because it aired in December and ep02 didn't air until February.  So when it says ep5 it's actually ep6; ep7 is ep8 and so on.  If you get confused when downloading, I would recommending going to wikipedia and looking at the episode guide there to figure out which one is which (they have short descriptions) because for whatever reason imdb doesn't even have all of the episodes up yet and there's no descriptions available.
