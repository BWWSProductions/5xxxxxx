IDM UltraSentry v5.00.1007 made Portable.

No need to install it!
Or, if you want to, Setup and Keygen are included...


You can configure UltraEdit and UEStudio to securely dispose of temp files post editing as well as source files post Encryption. All made seamless and fully automated by a simple check in the configuration dialog.

Besides secure file/folder disposal, UltraSentry offers disk sanitation, selected registry cleaning, and advanced browser security! UltraSentry can run as a service, on demand, as scheduled upon logoff or restart. It offers an easy-to-use wizard interface for nearly any scrubbing operation you desire. Whether it's simply cleaning up temp file artifacts or decommissioning/sanitizing fleets of PCs at your corporate headquarters, UltraSentry completes your secure file management solution at an exceptional value.

UltraSentry was designed to delete file and folder data to United States Department of Defense standards, which is why we call it a military-grade cleaning application. What does this mean? Well, many electronic files and data are highly-sensitive or private, and when deleted, the data itself still remains on the disk, making it recoverable or accessible by anyone. UltraSentry eliminates that risk by overwriting the file data repeatedly, completely destroying all traces of the sensitive file data, making it completely unrecoverable. The standards to which the data is overwritten are compliant with Department of Defense standards, and are the same standards the U.S. military and government use when deleting top-secret or proprietary electronic information.

The Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.


This has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.



SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal

http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you like it and it's useful for you, show your support buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
