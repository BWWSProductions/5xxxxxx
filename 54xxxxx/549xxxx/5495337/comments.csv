Although - it does play divx with higher resolution. How come you downsize it? Is that a compatibility issue?

Thanks again - me and the wife really appreciate it!"

And yep, it is mainly a compatibility issue. The 350mb (624x352 res) rips are still the most popular, largely because a lot of the common retail devices like my DivX DVD player don't play DivX HD 720p. So this makes a good in between quality that everyone can use. ;)

Of course, that will change when people are able to upgrade in a few years since MKV is making it's way into retail devices now too.

And thanks for the appreciation! :) Have a good one!"
