no problem mate. yeah i'm really impressed with it myself, its makes a massive difference over the default sounds and better than alot of the sounds installed with quality add-on aircraft also. the whining sounds of the engines spooling up and powering down and that hard grrr of the 737 in high throttle ranges during take off and climb are excellent.
its a massive improvement on the sound environment X i'd been using, that was uninstalled instantly after i had a test flight using this. "
