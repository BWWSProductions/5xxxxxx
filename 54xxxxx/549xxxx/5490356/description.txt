**QUICK NOTE** - I had to split this into halves to fit under TPBâ€™s size limits. Just download both and dump them together to get the full torrent.


1970s Musical Hits Torrent â€“ SHORT VERSION:

This torrent contains almost all of the major pop / rock hits of the 1970s. They are mostly in 128 kbps mp3 format. If a song was popular during the decade, it is probably in this collection. It is offered AS IS. Read the details below before you ask questions.


1960s Musical Hits Torrent â€“ DETAILED NOTES:

Like many other people, I have a collection of music on my computer divided up by my own little system. While some bands or genres get their own folder (Billy Joel, Punk, Opera, etc.), I mostly have it chopped up into hits by decade. The only test to make it in is if I like the song, not whether it was some loser extra track on an album, or some admittedly large hit that I personally didnâ€™t like. Every now and then, I would hear some tune I didnâ€™t have, download it, and add it to the file.

The problem is that some of these songs are damned hard to find, especially since the essential break-up of single file p2p sharing in favor of huge full album or discography collections. Those are great for groups like the Rolling Stones â€“ especially if you are an anal-retentive audiophile screaming for everything at high bit rates or .flac â€“ but what if you heard â€˜the Loverâ€™s Concertoâ€™ by the Toys on the dinerâ€™s background music last night, and just want a copy of that? The torrenting world can make it hard to find.

This collection contains most of the major hits and memorable songs of the 1970s from the world of pop and rock. There is a little country cross-over, but not much. If you listen to your local 70s station, this torrent is probably most of their playlist, give or take a few tunes. What I have done is taken my own 10-year-old and steadily added to â€˜1970sâ€™ file, and deliberately added the billboard top 100 songs from each year. Each year IS available by other uploaders individually, but I have found most of them to be poorly seeded, often mis-tagged, and named rather stupidly. Let me explain what *I* have done, and why:

â€¢	Named each file by ARTIST â€“ TITLE (I have removed â€˜THEâ€™ from the names of any artist to ease searchability, and have kept to the convention of first names. For example; Diana Ross rather than Ross, Diana, and simply Beatles rather than THE Beatles or Beatles, the. That crap is just bloody annoying.)

â€¢	Since the autotaggers tend to find tunes by compilation, I have renamed the albums and genre simply to â€˜Hits From 197Xâ€™, and â€˜1970s Hitsâ€™. There may be the odd error here and there, but these should be mostly reliable.

â€¢	The track numbers are essentially meaningless in this kind of compilation, so I sorted them by year and then alphabetically.

â€¢	Kept the bit rate to 128-160 kbps .mp3 for the sake of space. Most of the files were burned that way in the first place.

â€¢	In the case of the â€˜superbandsâ€™ â€“ groups that had TONS of hits in the decade, such as ABBA, Queen, Captain & Tenille, Billy Joel, etc. â€“ I have largely left them out simply because I keep that music in individual folders, and the complete discographies for these are already well seeded all over the place.

â€¢	Cleaned up the tags to remove all comments and crap, leaving only a link to a music website article, and an innocuous 1970s graphic. All extraneous garbage about labels, composers and such is deliberately eliminated.

â€¢	Left the files loose (no .rar or .zip files) so that people could snag that song whose absence from their collection is making them crazy. The collection is entirely of either official top 100 hits, and/or songs I personally remember and like. Some deeply rare or esoteric tune from your dadâ€™s shitty New Orleans garage band in 1971 is not going to be here. I meant this torrent to be one-stop shopping for popular 1970s pop/rock. No more, no less. I know that I have to be missing some songs Iâ€™ll add after I post this, but this torrent is still a fairly complete starting point for a 1970s collection. It took me ten years to gather all this â€“ not a bad download at one hit for YOU.


I want to be clear on a couple things. This collection is NOT an offering of complete albums or discographies. Those are already available all over the place. I also donâ€™t have most of these albums, so no, I CANNOT make this or that song available in a different format or at a higher bit rate. This entire torrent is a meta-collection of other peopleâ€™s work; tweaked, renamed, and reorganized. I often have trouble finding what *I* am looking for, so I assume other people have the same problem. This is simply a collection of hit songs offered in a very generic format and bit rate. If you are looking for the entire album of some 1972 one-hit wonder offered in 320 kbps, it isnâ€™t here and I cannot help you. In all likelihood, that album has never been released on DVD anyway â€“ most of these are from compilation collections. This is also the entirety of what I have at the present time. If you are searching for some song that isnâ€™t here, keep looking â€“ I donâ€™t have it. I hope you enjoy it.
