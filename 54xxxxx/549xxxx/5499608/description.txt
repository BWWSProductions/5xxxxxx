plot:
A depressed section of Monterey, California, known as Cannery Row 
from its string of now-empty canning plants is the backdrop for an 
offbeat romantic comedy about a pair of mismatched lovers. Doc is a 
lonely marine biologist (and former baseball star) who supplies specimens
for science labs and classrooms. Suzy is a scrappy drifter who can't even
succeed as a prostitute because of her abrasive manner. When the two get 
together, it's fireworks, though not the romantic kind. Not to worry, 
everything is in the hands of Cannery Row's resident guardian angels, Mack
and the boys, a band of drunken derelicts whose hearts are in the right 
place, even though their brains are not.
