I'm so tired of my blurry, unbookmarked copy of Arcane Power. I'm trying to get decent copies of my collection. Thanks again. Will report on quaility if it doesn't take forever to download from 1 seed."

Only issue is, excepting the front and back covers, the contents of this volume are 100% monochrome. Maybe the original is like this too. I don't know. Still, best quality up I've run across of this volume. THX!"
