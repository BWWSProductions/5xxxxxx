Rating:        M (Mature)
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2 or Swap Magic Disc Method. 


Compressed with 7Zip, Game was tested and works.


Note: No Ps2 backup disc/game or copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is Modded 
      (allows playing of backups), or if you use Swap Magic.


You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console. If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

And here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

Then you will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Swap Magic should do the
trick.


Game Description:

Sgt. J. Keller is a Black Op and he has just failed his operation - badly. He has been incarcerated and is interrogated to reveal his mission and to find out what went wrong. The player goes through Keller's failed operation in eight areas, wasting enemy soldiers and trying to stay alive. There are primary and secondary objectives, such as reaching a rendezvous point and gathering intel.

Black is a classic first-person shooter with variety of weapons and interactive scenery - interactive meaning destructible in this case. Enemy soldiers can be killed by destroying a nearby fuel tank for example, and weak shelter, like a wooden fence, can be shot to pieces in order to expose the enemy.

The game can be played in four difficulty levels: easy, normal, hard, and black ops. In easy mode, only the primary objective is required. In normal and hard modes, some of the secondary objectives are required. In black ops mode - unlocked after completing the game on hard - all objectives must be reached. New weapons are also unlocked after finishing a level.


Features:

* Covert Action- BLACK operatives do not hide in shadows or sneak behind walls 
  waiting for the right time to engage their foe- they destroy the wall, enemy and 
  anything else that gets in their way.

* The Guns Are the Stars- An explosive arsenal of bleeding-edge weaponry lets you
  experience the awe-inspiring power of the world's most exotic lethal firepower.

* If You Can See It, You Can Shoot It- Reduce cities to rubble in a world where 
  virtually nothing is impervious to your bullets.

* Get Your Blood Pumping- Adrenaline is your friend. Visceral, destructive action 
  sucks you deep into the gameplay as you blaze and blast your own path through 
  open-ended environments.

* BLACK-Style Kills- Use destructible worlds and explosive objects to take out 
  enemies in cover, frag multiple enemies at once or just wreak massive 
  destruction for its own sake.
