I still remember Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev (April 15, 1894 ? September 11, 1971), and the day a triumvirate took the reins of power from him. They were Brezhnev, Kosygin, and I can't remember the third man's name. I know he didn't stay very long. He was rather old and in poor health. I think he died within three years of the takeover.

I remember the day we woke up to the news that a wall had been erected overnight, splitting Berlin into 2 parts, and the consternation that caused.

I remember seeing President Kennedy on TV, saying ""Ich bin ein Berliner!"" I further remember the history teacher coming into class on fateful afternoon and telling us Kennedy had just been shot!

And I distinctly remember airplanes practicing breaking the sound barrier at high altitudes over our town in Northern Ontario. We kept hearing a big bang in the sky but saw nothing, not even a contrail. As kids, we had no idea what was happening. It's only after we learned that military planes had broken the sound barrier and had it explained what happens when you do that (pass the sound barrier) that we realized what we had heard.

As for feeling old, I don't and I certainly don't think old.

What do you remember?
