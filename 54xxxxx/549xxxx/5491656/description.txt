Storyline:

This 1983 adaptation of the Stephen King horror novel about Vic and Donna Trenton (Daniel Hugh-Kelly and Dee Wallace)
struggle to repair their crumbling marriage, while their young son Tad (Danny Pintauro) befriends a hulking, lovable, 200-pound St. Bernard named Cujo.
With Vic away on business, Donna and Tad take their decrepit car to be fixed at the remote farm of
their mechanic (Ed Lauter).
As their aging Pinto sputters to a stop and dies, Cujo appears.
But the once docile dog has undergone a hideous transformation - and becomes a slavering, demonic, impecable killer possessed of
almost supernatural strength...and unholy cunning.
Critically acclaimed, CUJO is a fearsome, spine-chilling tour de force from the most popular name in horror!
