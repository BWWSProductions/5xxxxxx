,RavenLabs,2010-04-13T15:03Z,"Yup, I want the Ultimate as well :("
[T],SceneRlz,2010-04-13T15:56Z,"Of course I will. But now, professional version is only available. Because ultimate has not released yet by any ""scene group""."
,D.C.R,2010-04-13T16:32Z,"Oh great, so this is NOT a trial right?"
,ingukk,2010-04-13T17:04Z,"this is version from msdnaa so its full one

and there's no ultimate version on msdnaa so you will have to wait for some group to rip it"
,Xetrill,2010-04-13T17:44Z,"Ultimate coming? (IntelliTrace, Static Code Analysis, ...)"
,noekk,2010-04-13T20:44Z,Does this have an embedded serial/key ? I never heard of group KOPiE. I use my Visual Studio 2008 Pro (downloaded here) every day so I really need to have a good copy.
,t-pirates,2010-04-14T02:16Z,nice bro !!
,noekk,2010-04-14T07:06Z,Is the MSDN AA the exact same as if you bought it somewhere else ?
,ACSKYDOS,2010-04-14T13:51Z,"do I need key?
is this trial?

i relly need normal one... please... :)
waiting for answers!"
,D.C.R,2010-04-14T14:36Z,Just installed this and works perfectly.
,ingukk,2010-04-14T15:21Z,"i said its from msdnaa, its FULL normal version, no cd-key or anything since this is supposed to be used by students"
,__int64,2010-04-14T16:16Z,Thanks for the professional. Ultimate comes with too much crap.
,noekk,2010-04-14T18:26Z,"Sometimes the student versions lack certain features because they're not supposed to be used for commercial reasons...and yeah, Ultimate is too bloated for me as well."
,ACSKYDOS,2010-04-14T20:27Z,"just installed it!
Its fantastic!
working perfectly!
thanks!"
,D.C.R,2010-04-17T19:47Z,I just downloaded the DreamSpark version and it's exactly the same files as this one.

i don't know much about this


HELP ME"
,FearCain,2010-05-30T19:38Z,"This has a different version Express, express editions are free and have features stripped out you may or may not need.  They indeed ideal for cheap students.

Thx for the release SceneRlz.

This one did freeze on me three times when installing .NET 4.0. I just downloaded and installed that, ran the setup again and everything installed fine.  I think it was my system not the release since no one else had problems."
,ntoskrnl,2010-06-07T16:20Z,"I had issues downloading this by HTTP from DreamSpark, so I'm grabbing it by torrent instead. It's the exact same file. Thanks for the upload!"

,CreativeProducts,2010-10-09T05:17Z,"Is this DreamSPark version? I had MS Expression DreamSpark version be4 and it worked great. If this is DreamSpark version too, then it should work just finee. 
Thanks~"
,namshub,2011-02-05T01:17Z,"just a reminder, if you're using zonealarm:
go to:
'Program Control'
'Main'
set 'SmartDefense Advisor' to Manual
(this makes every program ask you for permission to use the net. don't worry, you can make any choices permanent so you don't keep getting bugged every 5 minutes)
***********BUT***********
if you're using any ms s/w, such as this,
you'll want to go to
'Advanced'
in
'SmartDefense Advisor'
and uncheck the
'Allow certified MS programs to run automatically'
otherwise there's really no point to using torrents cuz something'll phone home and then you'll be F*@ked! "
