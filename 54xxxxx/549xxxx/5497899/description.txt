Martian Outpost provides a detailed insight into the various technologies, mission architectures, medical requirements, and training needed to send humans to Mars. 


It focuses on mission objectives and benefits, and the risks and complexities that are compounded when linked to an overall planet exploration program involving several expeditions and setting up a permanent presence on the surface.



The first section provides the background to sending a human mission to Mars. Analogies are made with early polar exploration and the expeditions of Shackleton, Amundsen, and Mawson. The interplanetary plans of the European Space Agency, NASA, and Russia are examined, including the possibility of one or more nations joining forces to send humans to Mars. 


Current mission architectures, such as NASAâ€™s Constellation, ESAâ€™s Aurora, and Ross Tierneyâ€™s DIRECT, are described and evaluated.
