Annie Ross - Sings A Song With Mulligan (1958)

MP3@320KBPS






Singer Annie Ross' first solo album after joining Lambert, Hendricks & Ross finds her at the peak of her powers. Ross is joined by two versions of the Gerry Mulligan Quartet with either Chet Baker or Art Farmer on trumpet, Bill Crow or Henry Grimes on bass, and drummer Dave Bailey. 


For this CD reissue, there are also five previously unissued selections and one that was originally on a sampler. Annie Ross is at her best (and most appealing) on "I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face," "Give Me the Simple Life," "How About You," and "The Lady's in Love With You," but all 16 selections are quite rewarding and her interplay with baritonist Mulligan is consistently memorable. 


This CD is a must-have for your essential jazz collections.
