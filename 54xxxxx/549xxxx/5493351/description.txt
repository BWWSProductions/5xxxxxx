Glenn Beck Program for April 12th 2010


Man...SO strange. Glenn's show is the ONLY show that the comcast DVR box won't record...even the nervous tech who came out today to look at the issue had no idea what that was about.

Don't worry though. I checked Olbermann's show and I'm still able to record that!
