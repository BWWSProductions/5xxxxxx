,hopegone,2010-04-14T15:12Z,"with M-cards being liberated from OEMs last year user-choice PVR kits should be availble any time now without the OS fascism of microsoft (win7)

watch one channel record 6 at USER SPECIFIED encoding levels without fascist flags.. and HDCP ""encryption"" is one thought experiment away from extinction.

I can't be bothered to pay for liberty suppression via DVR -- drm FORCES me to torrent shows from the lineup I PAY TO WATCH!!!   F*k them"
