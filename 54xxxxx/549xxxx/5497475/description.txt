Plot:

Henry Rowengartner is a young kid who is a big baseball fan. He even plays on a little league team, but he is rather lacking in skill. This is highly present when Henry slips on a baseball and breaks his arm. When his arm heals, Henry attends a Chicago Cubs game. A home run by the opposing team is hit, and, corresponding with the tradition, must be thrown back. Henry ends up throwing the ball back, but he throws it back all the way to home plate on a dead line. Henry is quickly signed by the Cubs and is the biggest phenom in Major League Baseball. But, is all the fame and fortune too much for him to handle at such a young age, or will he continue as the best pitcher in baseball? Written by David Landers <dml@gwis.com>
