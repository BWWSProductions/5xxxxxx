That Night In Toronto 

************************************************************************


That Night in Toronto is a live concert DVD featuring Canadian rock band
 The Tragically Hip, filmed and directed by filmmaking brothers Pierre and
 Francois Lamoureux. It was recorded November 26, 2004 at the Air Canada 
Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada during The Hip's In Between Evolution
 tour. It differs from most concert DVDs in the fact that nothing was 
edited out of the set. It is not a composite of several different shows, 
and the chronology is exactly that of the actual concert, one that was not
 booked or in any way influenced by or for the filming of the DVD. Originally 
released November 1, 2005, as a part of the Hipeponymous box-set, it was
 released separately on November 8, 2005. The audio is exclusively available
 from the iTunes Music Store. The title of the DVD is taken from a line of the
 popular Hip song "Bobcaygeon", which was included in the concert's set, much
 to the pleasure of the crowd at the Air Canada Centre that evening.
