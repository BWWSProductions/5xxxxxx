IMAGiNE NOTES
Here's our v2 of when in rome....sources used are the russian cam (thanks) and our own line audio.

The video was another one of them "blue" coloured releases and there is several camera movements through.

Work done, firstly we synced our line audio.

The video we needed to play with the colouring and yet again we get one part looking good, then theres other scenes that aren't as good Anyway done the best we could and also sharpened and
cleaned up the video a touch as well. The video also contains some glare and is worse in some scenes than others.....toned the glares down the best we could without making the film too dull.
