[T],artpepper,2010-04-14T18:18Z,"Thanks, @nobody2007, glad you like it."
[T],artpepper,2010-04-14T23:26Z,"@Feddersen, it's OK but compared to what went before? It's just a bit too safe, too bland... 

I remember my mother hearing it (I guess I was about 19) and she said 'Oh, that's nice...'. 

Well, exactly. When I played Blind Faith doing 'Can't Find My Way Home' or Cream doing 'Strange Brew', she told me to turn it down.

421 OB was when Clapton turned into Robert Goulet..."

You nailed it with that last comment.  We're about the same age, and there is no question in my mind that Cream and Blind Faith was Clapton's best work.  Thanks for this up though.  It's better quality than what I had."

,alcocops,2010-10-19T15:06Z,"Can't agree that this is Eric's last good album.
Layla, Journeyman and From The Cradle are all better, not to mention some of the live albums he's released. You're right about his lurch towards MOR of course, but I'd venture to suggest this first solo album was actually where that began. Aside from Let It Rain and maybe Slunky it hasn't got much of the wow factor about it. There are worse songs on 461 Ocean Boulevard but a few better ones as well - I'd give it the edge over this."

,cormaczoso,2012-06-12T21:06Z,"artpepper ... yep i agree as well this is the last great one ... combine blind faith, layla, and this one into a quadruple album and you get all you need of the stratocaster years (always shocked me that when he put up Brownie and then later Blackie for auction that Blackie went for a significant amount more ... for me, Brownie is the best and that is what is used on these three projects ... frankly, everything with Blackie is weak, too loaded, and a half-assed effort at best ... i got burned with about four of those albums and also about a dozen live shows i shelled out money for and then i finally woke up and realized he just didn't give a shit ... just wanted to be loaded and stand around pretending to be eric clapton ...

pretty damn sad ... and hey, clapton, i want all my money back i wasted on those albums and esp the live shows ... couldn't believe i kept going but it was usually after reading a 'promotional' interview claiming he was 'back into the blues and sober' ... yeah, both lies all thru the years ...

sorry had to vent that lol

and hey artpepper, he's my personal fave jazz sax man too :) got ""thursday night at the village vanguard"" you can upload? someone snatched that album off me years ago ... also Friday Night would be nice too ;) tho Thursday was always my personal fave ... ""My Friend John"" ... what a tune :)"
