Eric Clapton is the eponymous debut solo album from Eric Clapton. It was released in August of 1970. The album that launched Clapton's solo career takes most of its cues from his then-recent collaboration with Delaney and Bonnie. 

In fact, Delaney produced the album, which explains its loose, jam-session feel that sometimes finds Clapton battling against a cast that includes guest stars Stephen Stills, Sonny Curtis, Rita Coolidge, Leon Russell, and Delaney and Bonnie. 

Sadly, it's also Clapton's last good LP (@artpepper's opinion).



I loved Clapton--from The Yardbirds to Cream to Blind Faith to the emotional hurricane that was Derek and The Dominoes. But after this LP, Clapton turned into an FM staple--music to do your laundry by. The fire, the passion, the edge--all gone. Which makes this LP all the more valuable.
