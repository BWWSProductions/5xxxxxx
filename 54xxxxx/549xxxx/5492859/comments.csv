,D0gmeat,2010-04-12T22:24Z,"Thanks! Appreciate the effort!

You can add one more pt to your last Q/A: No one is asking you to play AC2 cracked. Buy the game if you're so desperate. ;)

Personally I'd say boycott any game that requires server-side validation and that requires constant downloads to play. We're paying money for a game with replay value and not for a license that goes away when there's no more support."
,rocco_sifredi,2010-04-13T00:08Z,"Sooo, if I understood it , correct me if I'm wrong, this gadget will emulate the real UBI server , and...if I have no internet connection , I can't play it this way, right ?"
,The.Genius.of.the.Hole,2010-04-13T02:10Z,"@ Rocco: HEY DUMBASS, read the FAQ, it says that it includes an offline mode for your pleasure...

HELP!
When I start the exe, it crashes ""AC2Launcher has stopped working""

DARN"
,cloud858,2010-04-13T05:21Z,"Thanks, works great. I had trouble trying to get AC2 to work before I found this, even got a trojan in the process (no idea where it came from, but malwarebytes got rid of it already)."
,socker_conny,2010-04-13T16:50Z,"my game freeze when leonardo should fix my knife.

,RhymesMatter,2010-04-13T16:57Z,Seriously if i had u in front of me i would bow and kiss ur feet!!!!(I know lol) This launcher is finally the best solution to play the game and it freakin works like a charm!!!!thank you so much for ur upload!Cheers!
,vanzerx,2010-04-14T12:48Z,"It worked, but sometimes, after finishing a mission the next one doesnt star. and i have to quit to main menu and load again. And when i turned off my PC the next day i can't play for some reason, it says You have no internet connection. While I have. :S"

Anyone know why the above message appears?"

,FelixLeech,2010-04-14T19:45Z,Will this work on a Steam version of AC2?

,garyoak99,2010-04-15T05:50Z,"I tried running it as administrator but the same Unhandled exception message came up! 

Any other possible solutions to this problem? "
,priapisme,2010-04-15T16:20Z,"@ garyoak99:

If you're running Spybot S&D (or any other program that blocks any process from changing the host file), turn that option off in tools->IE tweaks->""Lock Hosts file read-only as protection against hijackers""."
,lime195,2010-04-17T15:49Z,SAME as socker_conny stops when u get the knife.. what should i we do any solution? Mbb15?
,priapisme,2010-04-17T16:22Z,"@ socker_conny & lime195:

You're supposed to select your assassin's blade. I've found that it doesn't work if you select it through the weapon wheel, and you need to press its hotkey (default is 2).


I have a question myself about this launcher; are there (or could you add, maybe) command line options, like '-offline', to force it to create a local server and bypass the whole internet connection check?"
,RhymesMatter,2010-04-17T22:19Z,"@Mbb15
I wanted to ask u something about chapters!Will i be able to play chapter 12 and 13 through this launcher or does it skip to 14 after chapter 11?"
,RhymesMatter,2010-04-17T23:22Z,Indeed Pier82m is right! I can verify his state for Win7 x64 Ultimate...Not working anymore
,mayke_asa,2010-04-17T23:29Z,"Stopped working for me 2, 20 minutes ago or so...

Are you guys stuck in ""connecting"" after you select history mode ?? thats the problem here...
Windows 7 ultimate 32b "
,bedaro,2010-04-17T23:36Z,"yep, not working anymore after update"
,mayke_asa,2010-04-18T00:05Z,"I guess the server was just offline, working again... back to ""work"" now =)."
,RhymesMatter,2010-04-18T03:56Z,"and again i verify as well got it working once again!
But strange that when it asked me to update to 1.36 before it had finished updating the game started and played normally!Once i opened the game again it was still version 1.35 and again asked for update!Then i w8ted for the update to finish and then chose ""normal mode"".In other words weird as it sounds it worked as 1.35!Dont know what caused the problems!"
,warchicken,2010-04-18T16:36Z,It works ! Thanks !
,borsvalpen,2010-04-19T20:31Z,It has worked before but now itÂ´s not working at all. It goes offline when I am going to load the saved game. :(
,forcomments,2010-04-23T08:36Z,"Downloaded this and so far it was able to update itself up to v1.4. Right now, I seem to be stuck in the ""Checking Installation"" phase. Does it really take long to load this segment?"
,kdv439,2010-04-25T22:17Z,What the fuck?! it doesnt work anymore!!!! Establishing network connection when going to storyline!!!! WTF??
,JonRoark,2010-04-25T22:41Z,"Exact same problem here, too.  Worked fine less than 24 hours ago for me, now can't get past the ""Story Mode"" main title screen.  Just says ""Connecting..."" for ever.  Local mode gives same problem as normal mode.  Was there an auto update or something that killed the current crack?"
,fishcp2,2010-04-25T23:23Z,"It has stopped working! Really, really bad news..."
,clone420,2010-04-26T03:06Z,Yup stopped for me too.  Ubisopft fuckd us again
,kdv439,2010-04-26T03:47Z,"yo guys, just download this skidrow crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5507231/Assassins_Creed_II-SKIDROW-CrackOnly
it works fine, and to have your saved games, in the ubisoft launcher folder, in the storage, copy the files from [whatever] folder to skidrow folder and they will work."
,JonRoark,2010-04-26T05:07Z,"Uh Oh - just tried this, and now instead of letting me select ""Story Mode"" and then having no saved session in place, I just go to the ""Connecting..."" screen with my only option to exit back to Windows.  This is exactly what the AC2 Launcher started doing today.  This happening to anyone else with the Skidrow crack, or is it just my problem?  Is Could Ubisoft have updated something that kills both cracks?"
,kdv439,2010-04-26T18:32Z,"no, skindrow works perfectly for me"
,JonRoark,2010-04-26T19:59Z,"Interesting- randomly tried running AC@ Launcher again today and it's working again.  I have Skidrow's patch applied now, as well, and it doesn't seem to be causing any problems (my saved games returned).  Weird.  Maybe my experience is just unique- has any else tried to run the launcher again and gotten it to work, too?"
,strakha,2010-05-09T21:59Z,"This isn't working for me.  When I run AC2 launcher as an administrator I get 2 options, normal mode and local mode.  Normal mode goes to a screen saying ""Checking Assassin's Creed 2 Installation"" and stops there, I have waited for ages and nothing happens.  When I try local mode, it starts to launch the game and looks like it is about to work, but then I get ""An active internet connection is required to play this game"" (I am still connected to the internet).  Can anyone help?"
,strakha,2010-05-09T22:11Z,"Ignore my last comment, it's working now.  I added the information

to my hosts file (windows\system32\drivers\etc) and it took a long time to launch, but then it worked.  Thanks, and keep fighting the ubisoft restrictive DRM!  Fuck ubisoft!"
