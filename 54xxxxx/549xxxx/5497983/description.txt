Reviews:

International Record Review

"Both players have the measure of this music, both technically and musically. They offer more verve and variety of both tone and musical approach than Kim Kashkashian and Robert Levin for ECM â€¦ All in all, these are excellent, well-recorded performances of these fine works, brooding and turbulent in the best traditions of the early twentieth century."


BBC Music Magazine

"Some of Hindemith's most haunting tunes went into his viola music â€¦ This is the first volume of a projected and very welcome series devoted to the viola works of a composer who played the instrument himself and wrote prolifically for it â€¦ [Sonata no 4] gives Power a chance to show off the gorgeously smooth tone of his 400-year-old instrument â€¦ Power's acute sense of phrasing makes for an eloquent and elegiac 'Meditation'."


The Guardian

"All the performances are superb, with Laurence Power lavishing all the richness of his velvety tone and generous phrasing on some of the most striking melodic ideas that Hindemith ever produced."
