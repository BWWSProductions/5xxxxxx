,MarkSeif,2010-04-29T04:31Z,Wow .... already no seeders.  This could turn out to be an impossible file to get.
,MarkSeif,2010-04-29T21:18Z,"Everyone will be stuck at 53% until garaa288 decides that ""will seed forever"" means more than just 12 days without giving a single person a chance to get the file yet :p lol"

,xtyrasage,2011-04-11T07:36Z,"If I can get this downloaded, I'll definitely seed for at least as long as it takes me to watch them all, which will be a long time for 6 seasons of a tv show. xD  I've been downloading for 2 hours, currently at 4.7%, downloading between 150-200 kb/s, which isn't too awful. I'm going to leave it running tonight and hopefully see lots of progress by morning. Cheers!"
,Mrjeftic95,2011-04-30T03:06Z,By far one of the best torrents ive ever downloaded. Great quality and it even has HD episodes from the point in time they were starting to be produced. Thanks a million bro.
,xbins,2011-06-03T22:55Z,Want this bad but it is so fucking slow...
,DarkNatasX,2011-08-22T22:26Z,"Good side = HD
Bad side = All seasons in 1, so huge file."
,coo4632,2012-03-02T22:31Z,"Thanks for the share.
