,utron11,2010-04-16T18:49Z,Good game!!!! Enjoy it everyone!!!
,Ketanou,2010-04-19T10:39Z,"Works fine, but crashed sometimes : save before changing zone. "
,wscarney,2010-04-25T17:50Z,Can someone walk me through the steps of how to patch the game. I downloaded the other patch from the torrent he recommended but I don't know what to do from there. It just brings me to terminal and says it can't find the image. Any help would be great thanks.
,DollyPunter,2010-04-25T20:04Z,"You need to download the official patch for the game ? you execute that patch, and then you just copy the file from the torrent over the patched file."
,sirveaux,2010-04-26T08:54Z,"I'm having the same problem as wscarney - 
I can install the 1.12 patch, but when I unstuff the crack, I get a unix executable file, rather than a replacement .app."
,sirveaux,2010-04-26T11:05Z,Thanks for the explanation - it works perfectly.
,saslanid,2010-05-06T12:15Z,I have done all this stuff but still i am having a problem in accepting the serial you are giving .... please help !!!
,saslanid,2010-05-07T10:45Z,I have tried many times by copy paste from the text but it does nothing ...... i can't find the problem !
,Major._Spork,2010-05-08T16:21Z,is anyone else experiencing a large amount of crashes when playing? I've had quite a bit of issue playing because of crashing
,saslanid,2010-05-11T18:02Z,i really have tried everything .... i have tried copy paste or writting by myself... i have tried caps locks or not and everything else i can think ! i cant understand wy it does this !
,Vladimir28,2010-05-13T07:17Z,"I know I'm just missing something obvious, but when I try to patch the game it can't find the files.  When I try to select the destination manually, all the files are grayed out and I can't install the patch.  Could someone please explain what I'm missing?  I'm relatively new to macs."
,sunfire1226,2010-06-07T02:18Z,"I can get all the way to playing the game itself, get through the first part of the tutorial, the part inside the house, but when I try to leave it gets stuck on the loading screen for the next area, any ideas?"
,lentz1,2010-06-11T08:49Z,ok i must be an dumb shit but i have never done this on a mac so i need some help installed the game but i have no idea how to get the game to work
,ArtJenneration,2010-06-19T10:01Z,"It all works great, thanks!
Had to download the Stuffit Deluxe application to make the AESTHIR crack work though, and that's what had me stuck for so long."
,ArtJenneration,2010-06-19T10:07Z,"@Vladimir28
Did you install the patch? If so, then you have to use the 'Neverwinter Nights 2 v1.12 (1295) [K] for Mac.sitx' files. 
There should be a Unix Executable file (an exec / terminal file) that you copy into the folder through Package Contents ""/Neverwinter Nights 2.app/Content/MacOS/Neverwinter Nights 2"""
,PigNo,2010-07-01T05:05Z,"Ok i download this torrent installed installed patch then down load the crack i get this folder
""Neverwinter_Nights_2_(Mac-OSX)_[k]--AESTHIR"" inside is only 2 files ""Neverwinter Nights 2 v1.11 (1152) [k] for Mac"" and ""Neverwinter Nights 2 v1.12 (1295) [k] for Mac.sitx"" these are not exe or app files and i cannot unpack them im so lost any help?"
,PigNo,2010-07-01T05:06Z,i have read all the help on this page 2 but for some reason i cannot seem to figure it out ive done this 1000 other times with other games bt this is jst not wrking 
,PigNo,2010-07-01T05:30Z,"ok figured it out took me for ever! im new to mac so it helps when i havnt yet acquired all the programs i require to properly do this.... please explain the programs required to unpack files in the brief it helps for 1st time mac users 

incase anyone else gets this simple just down load a unpack prog so no one ever has to make such noob mistake :P"
,sycruss,2010-07-06T05:04Z,Thnx
,coruir,2010-07-08T03:12Z,"I know cracked games generally don't work on multiplayer, but have to ask, will this work online? Is there any way to connect to a persistent world server without connecting to the developer?"
,pikkoloh_,2010-07-25T18:27Z,"If it asks you for serial, like it did, even though i followed those instructions.. Try this. Works with me.
THX for upload!
but heres the serial: 
WE999-ARE99-RLD99-L33T9-AD9VD-K6AGU-DVGEE"
,smchucky,2010-08-09T19:02Z,"Thanks Santoka for the upload...... and to those who originally packed and uploaded this.....

Heres a few pointers for those needing help......

first you need to download stuffit expander for the crack torrent from Aesthir......

Second the file you replace is a Unix Exe file like others have said, you DONT replace the main .app file

thirdly you must right click on thr .app file ( the NWN2 icon and go to show contents then navigate to the appropriate folder and replace one file.....

The crack torrent has a text file with step by step instructions on how to do this....

hope this helps....."
,fictionalMe,2010-09-24T02:59Z,"Guys... All you need to do to unpack the files is download a stuffit expander (or Path Finder)
Then  you follow the instructions."
,assalyu,2010-10-01T09:05Z,"followed ALL instructions exactly, but it still asks for the SERIAL NUMBER. and the one provided in Neverwinter Nights 2 - Mac - [atlan] doesn't work.

any ideas? 

btw, i'm using MacOSX 10.5.8"

,kendorobban,2010-12-28T17:57Z,"Thanks for the upload! 
But please seed, dl: 9.6 kb/s ! "
,Yatar,2010-12-29T12:17Z,"I did 
- download and install the game 
- download and the patch, updating the Neverwinter Nights 2.app, without opening it. 
- download and unpack the crack 
- navigate following the indication and find the file that needs to be overwrited 

I can't overwrite it because (as said by the system) the folder ""MacOS cannot be modified"". 

The file permission says ""read only"". 

How do I overcome this issue ? 
Please, help "
,Yatar,2011-01-08T17:54Z,"Problem solved. 

Game runs perfectly and smoothly. 
A few minor bugs, but nothing yet that could restrict the game experience. 

Thank's a lot ! "
,Contemplator,2011-01-10T14:25Z,"Guys, does anyone have this trnt?
Please, seed if you can! :)"
,mikd,2011-01-24T16:15Z,"im experiencing constant crashes, have dl and installed the patch 1.12 but still crashes after like every 10 minutes. any solution for this ?"
,Aquita,2011-03-04T19:45Z,Serial code doesnt work and neither does the serial code that pikkoloh_ gave... Can anyone help me?
,Jawwwwsh,2011-03-12T19:50Z,Seed please!! :)
,phite,2011-03-17T23:00Z,"for those of you that are having trouble with the serial codes: reinstall the game, when it prompts you for the serial code enter it, after the game starts close the game and tell little snitch to block the neverwinter nights 2 app. Thats what i did and I am able to play.

However I am having other troubles. Every time after I leave the lizardling cave place after collecting the white shard thing the game crashes no matter what. Anyone else have this problem/solution?"
,phite,2011-03-17T23:56Z,so i finally got past that part after trying a few more times but dang this game is constantly crashing
,lynvspudge,2011-05-12T02:08Z,works great thanks santoka !
,papafilipou,2011-06-21T18:16Z,he  so i downloaded it fine and started a character but after the tutorial and when i try to skip the tutorial it crashes. Any suggestions?
,odobo1,2011-07-25T01:12Z,"Way too complicated, and doesn't work when the process is finished.   Program won't open."
,Malcavian,2011-08-10T22:57Z,"FOR EVERYONE EXPERIENCING CRASHES,

Run the game in the windowed mode. It's enabled in options-graphics section. It solves the transition crashes. The downside is that F12 doesn't work (maybe you can fix it through System Preferences though, I haven't tried), so no quicksaves - the usual ones could be done via the NWN symbol in the left bottom corner - options - save game.

Hope I helped"
,anabioz-0700,2012-02-17T09:51Z,"serial don't work. searched in comments.
