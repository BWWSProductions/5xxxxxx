Not my torrent, but I couldn't find the game here at TPB, there was only the crack, which you should use if you insall the recommended 1.12 patch, from here : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5172733/Neverwinter_Nights_2_%28Mac-OSX%29_%5Bk%5D--AESTHIR

Includes SN and crack, but the crack included didn't work for me (SnowL maybe...) so I had to use the crack from the link above ; and anyway, patch up and use the crack above !!!

So for those having troubles patching then cracking the game, even though all is explain in the cracks read-me, there's a detailed walkthrough :

    * Download this torrent

    * Install the game

    * Download and install the 1.12 patch from here : http://files.aspyr.com/support/NWN2_1.12.1295.dmg

    * Download and unpack the crack from here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5172733/Neverwinter_Nights_2_%28Mac-OSX%29_%5Bk%5D--AESTHIR

    * Right click and "Show Package Contents" of your NWN2 application

    * Within the application, navigate to "/Neverwinter Nights 2.app/Content/MacOS/Neverwinter Nights 2"

    * Copy the "Neverwinter Nights 2" unix exe file from the crack folder into the the folder you opened in the step above

    * Overwrite

    * Enjoy !
