Lot Notes



This complete set of Camera Work was inscribed by Stieglitz to 'Litchfield' and eventually came into the possession of the current owners via the photographer, Consuelo Kanaga, a close personal friend and whose own work is represented in the sale in the following two lots, 548 and 549.


In 1919, Kanaga married mining engineer Evans Davidson, but they separated within two years and Kanaga moved to New York to work as a photojournalist for the newspaper, New York American. Donald Litchfield, a colleague and with whom she was briefly romantically involved, introduced her to her mentor, Alfred Stieglitz.
