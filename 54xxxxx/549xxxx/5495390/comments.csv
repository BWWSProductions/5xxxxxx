,mukuface,2010-05-13T12:41Z,"Congratulations.  After years of trolling and  downloading behind the scenes, yours is the torrent that drew me out to register so that I can comment.  Pat yourself on the back.

And what do I have to say that's so important, so important that it drove me to register?  

""PLEASE SEED!!!!""  

Seriously, seed it for like half a day, a few hours even, so that I can get the whole thing, and I'll leave the torrent up for days on end for all to procure.  I've been slowly climbing towards 100% from 80%, but I don't think I can wait anywhere from 2 years to infinite years."
