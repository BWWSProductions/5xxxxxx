,ZenRhino,2010-04-13T15:26Z,"Is it possible that you can get the unaired prelims from UFC Fight Night Live 21 (Florian Vs. Gomi) ??

I've been trying to get the Brenneman - High fight cuz Charlie is a local guy from my part of PA. and was hoping to get that fight (plus the others too of course)

Thanks in advance for any help you might have & +1 for the release here!!"
,ZenRhino,2010-04-13T15:28Z,"btw, couldn't find the torrent you mentioned with the Veach-Kelly fight... which one is that?"
,ZenRhino,2010-04-13T16:13Z,I tried to rip them from the UFC website (since the event was on free tv the prelims don't cost anything to watch) but they use Silverlight & my Real Player won't rip that format... was hoping someone could figure out how to get those prelims since I have no clue. Thanks for the response!

,gabriel1475,2010-04-14T15:43Z,Thanks!
,ZenRhino,2010-04-14T22:44Z,Thanks... I went to that site & found the prelims from UFN Live 21 I was asking about... so another +1 from me!!
,ZenRhino,2010-04-15T00:20Z,"trying to DL from those links, but it's saying invalid passkey... I'm signed in - so what's the deal? can you help me figure that out?"
,ZenRhino,2010-04-15T03:29Z,Could you take that UFN 21 unaired Prelims from that website and UPload it here? I still can't get it to work for me over there... thanks in advance
