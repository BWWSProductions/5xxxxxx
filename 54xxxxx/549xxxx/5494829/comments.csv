,icesave,2010-05-06T00:34Z,"Thank u so much for the upload.
It's been like a month since I gave up on finding any more than episodes 1-3 on the torrent sites.
Don't care at all how 'bad' the graphics will be.
Just don't understand why this show was deemed as 'Not upload worthy'
Best wishes from Volcano Iceland!!! :D"
,shackwove,2010-11-29T16:45Z,Episode #8 has no sound :( Any chance you might re-upload that one seperatly ? Thanks a lot for this!
,Lordkire,2011-01-16T21:01Z,"What do you guys use to play episodes 4-8?
They don't work in Media Player Classic :/"
,tonyx21,2011-01-28T20:17Z,"Man, thanks to the uploader. I Tried to find these episodes for days! I love this program. Can't believe it's not populair!!"
,petermartinverduyn,2011-02-02T16:01Z,He man thanks a ton. Sound on the 8th episode isn't working though. I tried it on all of my media players :S. Any idea''s anyone? tx
,no1313,2011-02-02T16:33Z,"sorry for the sound on e8, link to a working one http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6145666/Breakout.S01E08_soundfix
should play fine in any player

ep4-7 on this torrent should play fine with vlc and maybe a few more players, they are encoded in a bad way thus lowering compatibility."
,fertjuh,2011-02-27T14:13Z,"Thank you, great show!"
,lockedup1,2011-12-24T06:28Z,All episodes except the last one totally watchable. Thanks so much :)
