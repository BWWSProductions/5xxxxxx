The Incredible Hercules is an ongoing comic book series written by Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente and published by Marvel Comics. The series stars the mythological superhero Hercules, his sidekick Amadeus Cho, the seventh-smartest man in the world, and half-sister Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, Strategy, and Heroic Endeavour.

The first story arc picks up from the end of World War Hulk, Hercules and Amadeus Cho are now on the wrong side of the law. Hercules intends to make peace with S.H.I.E.L.D., while Cho only wants to continue his campaign to bring it down. But then Hercules is confronted with his half-brother and longtime nemesis Ares, God of War.

The title changed from The Incredible Hulk to The Incredible Hercules. Though the title does not change until issue #113 the first issue of the first story arc of The Incredible Hercules appears in issue #112. The series has garnered high praise since its debut in 2008. In its coverage of the initial arc, IGN labelled the first issue a surprising success, and, in its review of #115, singled out the series' distinctive humour: "Incredible Hercules #114 is hilarious." Comics blogger Chris Sims has repeatedly compared it to the famous Walt Simonson run on Thor for "complex, interweaving plotlines that built organically over months, and paid off beautifully" and "big action, emotional moments balanced out with lighthearted humor, and a blending of mythology with the Marvel Universe."
