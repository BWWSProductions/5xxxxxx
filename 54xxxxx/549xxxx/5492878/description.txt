plot:
Against the background of an Australian desert landscape, so much space
and so few people, Sandy, a geologist, and Hiromitsu, a Japanese businessman,
play out a story of human inconsequence in the face of the blistering universe.
The end of the journey leaves no-one capable of going back to where they started from.
