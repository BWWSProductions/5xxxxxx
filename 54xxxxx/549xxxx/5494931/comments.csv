lockdown is episode 16."

Wikipedia lists it as #17.
The site were I dl'd it listed it as #17. 
The filename says #17.

But whatever the number: It is the *latest* episode, from April 12th.
Next episode is April 19th (#18, ""Kinght's Fall"")."

Problem is probably that the first two episodes ""Broken (Part 1)"" and ""Broken (Part 2)"" are counted as one feature-length episode by some broadcasters."
