,clarenicole,2010-11-23T06:22Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS! You'll only be wasting your bandwidth and despite what LeTHL_SnOFLAkE says, there is no bar you click. It's all in Russian and you CANT change it."

,BogeyMaster,2011-04-23T20:44Z,@clarenicole u suck dick..its fuckin working :D
,steveturner,2011-05-04T18:55Z,"@clarenicole, if you do what LeTHL_SnOFLAkE said correctly (which btw he gave the best instructions possible) you'll see that you can change it to ""English version"" on the third step of installing."
,ngeee,2011-07-05T21:05Z,"As LeTHL_SnOFLAkE said, there is an option to switch to English after 2 or 3 screens while installing.
Works fine in English to me."

,hackerkillerpk,2011-07-21T09:44Z,"guyz for godsakes i really need help with this. i tried to check for the bar within all the installer pages but found nothing then i went right ahead and installed the game, after tht when i tried to play it and pressed on the launcher and stuf, it keeps saying ""The directory name is invalid"", please anyone, help me out :("
,Levov,2011-08-01T05:04Z,"HOW TO INSTALL IN ENGLISH

1. Make sure you have either Daemon Tools or Winrar installed

2a. If you want to use Daemon Tools, mount TonyHWK.mdf and run the installer. On the third page select the drop down box and select English.

2b. If you want to use Winrar, open TonyHWK.mdf with Winrar and run setup.exe. On the third page select the drop down box and select English.

Not that hard, guys."
,Stormtrooper12,2011-08-17T15:02Z,Holy fuck guys if you mount the game there will be a place to change it to english.. note how the pic of the game he got was in ENGLISH.. that because that game has more then one language setting so people outside of you house can play it.. maybe even people across the ocean.. and if someones trusted guys download it the game works..
