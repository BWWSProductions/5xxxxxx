The story of a boy named Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest. At first, he thinks it's a lucky discovery, something that will bring meat to his poor family for the winter. Instead, it brings a dragon hatching, and Eragon is soon thrust into a world of magic and power through which he and the dragon must navigate.

According to prophecy, Eragon is destined to be a dragon-rider like those who once protected a benevolent kingdom, thus reviving an ancient conflict against the army of King Galbatorix, a former dragon rider who turned to evil, now in alliance with a dark magic.
