"Time After Time"

In an effort to get to the root of the secret that William's 
nemesis, Dennis York, holds over their heads, the Walkers 
recall their memories, both good and horrifying, of their 
family's days at Ojai Foods in 1986. Then, as they continue 
to flashback to their younger days, they finally recall the 
shocking secret and the shameful cover-up that led to York's 
power play, and are forced to deal with the remorse of a 
tragic event. Meanwhile, Nora and Holly take an 
uncharacteristic trip, a la "Thelma & Louise," to search for 
answers about Ojai's hidden worth, and Justin and Rebecca 
finally get their happily ever after.

Enjoy :)
