Another excellent weekday show for the New York faithful, filled with unusual treats and great jams!  This show also featured a Beacon-esque parade of special guests in the second set, all of whom added to the show.

The first set got off to strong start with the classic combo of "Don't Want You No More/It's Not My Cross To Bear" and never let up!  This was a bluesy first set, with Warren wailing on "44 Blues" and "The Same Thing," and Gregg digging in deep on "End Of The Line" and "Leave My Blues At Home."  For the second time in the run, they played a new, extended jam in "Midnight Rider" that really allows Derek to soar, and the second appearance of "Egypt" confirmed that it is back in the rotation.  A spirited "Revival" wrapped up the first set in style!

The second set began with avant-blues legend James "Blood" Ulmer on guitar.  The ABB played his tune "I Asked For Water (And She Gave Me Gasoline)" for the first time ever, and the mesh of styles worked out perfectly!  A ripping "One Way Out" and the second Palace performance of Bob Dylan's "Blind Willie McTell" followed, before Soulive guitarist Eric Krasno took the stage for Little Milton's classic "That's What Love Will Make You Do."  This funky tune is custom-made for Krasno's laid-back, in the pocket style, and Warren kills the vocals!

An epic "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" ended the set, with dazzling solos all around and an intriguing "JaMaBuBu" segment in the middle.  A powerful version of "Southbound" with both Krasno and former Phil and Friends keyboardist Rob Barraco put an exclamation point on another great show!
