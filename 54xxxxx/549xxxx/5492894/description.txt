Priestcraft and Pagan Christianity:

We resume with this upload our task of collecting evidences against Christianity. This upload examines the system of Priestcraft in Christianity and shows that it was unknown to early Christians and is against the teachings of Jesus. It is an innovation in Christianity that was borrowed from pagan practices. 

The current exposure of the sex abuse scandals of the Church and its priests is only a small demonstration of the corruptions of Priestcraft. It shows how dangerous to the society could a group of people become when they put themselves in a class above people, and like gods give themselves the authority to exploit people and control their lives.
