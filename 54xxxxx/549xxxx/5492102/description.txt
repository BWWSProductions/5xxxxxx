"Gone With The Wind"

When Cleveland is diagnosed with high cholesterol, Donna puts 
him on a new high-fiber diet, which causes an intestinal 
backlash. It may stink up the place, but Cleveland quickly 
realizes his gas might score him a few points in the Broken 
Stool's karaoke contest. Meanwhile, Quagmire pays a visit to 
Stoolbend to deliver Cleveland some upsetting news.

Enjoy :)
