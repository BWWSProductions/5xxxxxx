There are many places you can go to in the Caribbean, but there is only one spot that has been called "The Best Kept Secret".

That place is the Dominican Republic, and the time to find out about this investors paradise is sooner, not later ! You can find out about basic statistics from any book-store travel guide, but not the honest kind of perspective you are looking for. What is it really like to live there? What is the cost of living? How do I find the real estate or apartment bargains? Can I find good Internet access? What is the shopping like? How about banking rates? 

Christopher Columbus did not discover America, he discovered the Dominican Republic!  In fact, he liked it so much, he decided to stay. The odd thing is, Europeans have been coming ever since, but with less than 20% of the tourists coming from the US, it remains a undiscovered "secret" for Americans. Are there other beautiful places in the Caribbean? Sure there are, but not as inexpensive or offering so much for both the investor and retiree. 

High tax-free interest on your US dollar investments, one of the fastest growing countries & economies, pleasant year-round climate, the opportunity for a tax free business, and very modern health care facilities are only a part of the attraction. 

Regardless of whether you want the casual beach lifestyle, the cooler temperatures of the mountains, or the nightlife of a modern cosmopolitan capital city, the Dominican Republic has something for everyone. Located on the second largest island in the Caribbean, just a short flight from Miami, it also has more undeveloped and unspoiled beach front property than any other place you can think of.
