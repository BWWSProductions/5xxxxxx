Innocents in Paris is a series of anecdotes bundled together by geography. 

First we see the efforts by British diplomat Alastair Sim to loosen up 

Soviet-agent Peter Illing long enough to forge an economic plan between Russia 

and England. Then we watch as dotty artist Margaret Rutherford purchases a 

copy of the Mona Lisa. Next we see British officer Jimmy Edwards go off on a 

toot in a Parisian bistro. The next vignette involves impressionable Claire 

Bloom, who is swept off her feet by a local rake (the human variety, not the 

garden implement).
