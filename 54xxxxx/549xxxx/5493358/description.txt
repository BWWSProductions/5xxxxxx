Born February 23, 1994, this list includes all of her major work as listed on IMDB up until her 15th birthday, with two exceptions: The unaired pilot episode for the Fighting Fitzgeralds, and Father Xmas, which while available on iTunes seems to be DRM protected and my attempts to extricate it have failed miserably. If anyone out there has copies of either, please link to them in the comments!

Enjoy!
