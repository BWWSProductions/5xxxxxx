...?

Hows that work? She was born in '94.. She was -6 when she filmed this?
Haha, I'm just unfamiliar with what this one is."
,Ducks44,2011-02-26T01:31Z,@PwnzAll  I think My Neighbor Totoro was originally a Japanese Anime Film that Dakota and Elle Fanning did the english translation for Disney in 2005.  or... Dakota Fanning is just that good! =)
