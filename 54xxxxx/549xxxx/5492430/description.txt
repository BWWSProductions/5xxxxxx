Percy Mayfield/The Phillip Walker Band - Hit The Road Again (1982)


MP3 | CBR 320 kbps | 45:38 


Recorded November 5, 1982.





"Hit The Road Again" with the Phillip Walker Blues Band is a rare blues album on the Timeless label. Most of the songs are remakes of (the late)Percy Mayfield's old hits like "River's Invitation", "The Highway Is Like A Woman", "Two Years Of Torture", "My Jug And I", etc. The performances are excellent and the mood is laid back, with splendid guitar from the under-rated Walker and fine tenor sax from Hollis Gimore.
