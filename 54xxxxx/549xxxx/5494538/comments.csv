,sharenneedles,2010-04-26T09:10Z,can you please seed
,Silverhandhealer,2010-06-14T03:53Z,"its a real pity, but this user posted a couple of interesting audio books, but never stuck around long enough to seed anything past 10 percent.  truly a pity.  "
,dark_gable_64,2010-07-03T02:26Z,"This torrent is DOA as the tracker has been down for months and there are no seeders.

For a similar, if not better torrent, pls feel free to come here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5665166/Kim_Harrison_-The_Hollows_-_(Audio_Books_1-8)_MP3

I will be seeding this torrent continuously for at least a week, or until there are several seeds connected in the swarm."
