Bun B Presents: Trill - Swisha House Remix


With his debut solo release, TRILL, Bun-B proves that he doesn't need his UGK partner Pimp C to deliver the goods. On this sprawling set of gangsta-crunk tracks, the Texas-based rapper delivers more unflinching, sinister tales from the ghetto over dizzying, southern-fried beats. The impressive array of contributors--including Ludacris, Too Short, Ying Yang Twins, Scarface, and Mike Jones--adds even more star power to an already top-notch production.

Personnel: Bun B; Jazze Pha, Juvenile, Lil Jon, Mannie Fresh, Mddl Fngz, Mike Jones , Paul Wall , Pimp C, Scarface, Slim Thug, T.I., Too $hort, Young Jeezy, Z-Ro, Lil' Flip, Devin the Dude, Petty Pueblo.
