,Daca5,2010-04-27T13:08Z,"I try to run the games with No$GBA Emulator 2.6a and No$Zoomer 2.3.0.2 but after I pick my name and gender the infamous black screen shows up.
I am confused since you say it works on No$GBA. Could you please tell me the exact emulation options I need to use?
Or maybe if you know something else that I am missing here. Any instructions would be much appreciated."
,ryan88cool,2010-04-29T03:49Z,"i just downloaded a version and ran the game as normal and it ran fine, i collected upto 5 badges on it, not once did it crash or go too a black screen, give me a few hours and ill see if i can do anything."
,argghhh,2010-05-03T18:48Z,"this has crashed twice in the past 10 minutes. I'm past gym 3 and it had only crashed once and frozen a couple of times but its getting worse. and for black screen use this code check action replay and RAW 
020DE16C E1A00000 
020D3FA8 E1A00000 

just copy and paste that in your cheats menu. anyway can anyone help me out?"
,argghhh,2010-05-05T07:24Z,soooo this crashes. maybe less. but now i saved after beating the 4th gym and i can't even start it. I select the saved file and the rom image has crashed. so i'm removing this file. and you should change the name to reduced crash.
,Daca5,2010-05-06T15:09Z,"The code worked, thanks for that. I just didn't think it was needed.
So the sprites sometimes get all screwy and it does freeze (although rarely), but it's playable as long as you save often.
Thank you for the torrent and sorry to have worried you."
