,FSmonster,2010-04-14T10:58Z,"I notice that Raymondhome never actually credits the makers of the movie..... all his little buddies get a right proper felching, but not the people who actually contributed.

I wonder if Buddha is comfortable with you thieving from others to proseletyse for him ?

Hey dont get me wrong, were all thieves here... just some of us are sanctimonius, delusional wankers like your man raymond here."

V - 9

A - 9

M - Well acted, great cast, good soundtrack, but the script and cinematography is a fuckin mess.
Should have been a great movie but end up just wave to predictable and leaves you bored.
It feels bad man... "
