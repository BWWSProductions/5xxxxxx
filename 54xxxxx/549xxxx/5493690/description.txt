PLOT
Cillian Murphy delivers a career defining performance as John Skillpa, a quiet bank clerk living in tiny Peacock, Nebraska, who prefers to live an invisible life. This might have to do with Johnâ€™s secret: he has another personality no one knows about, a woman who each morning does his chores and cooks him breakfast before he starts his day.

Then, in a moment, everything changes.
