I LOVE QUARK!

Cheers

P.S. I am having a problem understanding 'RATIOS'in relation to seeding. My being stupid and just nit understding system.

I use uTorrent 2.x and it uses percentages for ratio of seeding.

I download a Talk Show Pack which is 88/mb and I seed it to 700% (7:1). It shows that I am seeding 7  times the amount I downloaded, i.e. 616MB.

Am I reading this wrong, going from your post? Should I be seeding to 1000% (10:1)?

Cheers
Jon"
[V],twentyforty,2010-04-16T06:56Z,"Ratios are irrelevant guys. They are ""numbers"" just meaning something to yourself.
If someone pays, pays by the traffic (megabytes, gigabytes) not by th ratio, right?

The point I was trying to make was just: If you want... and can - seed - do not look at the ratio. 
File is mostly in range 20 - 70 MB.
To seed few FILES back to the people, doesn't look too costly. And it doesn't looks complicated to understand too

@TKOG13: Unfortunately, that's why [quark] torrent dies within 6 hours. Many little hands together can move the mountain. For instance, most downloaded [quark] is ""The Vampire Diaries"" - 1147 times. Could you imagine that ALL people stayed to seed - at 1kB/s? Just that. At least for a while. I do understand the problem of daily nature of the daily talk shows pack (shelf-life is built-in), but - for sake of god - not to stay on two-three seeders within few hours.
