All of the themes for Windows XP included in this package will work without installing any third party software (like StyleXP) if you patch "uxtheme.dll" in the system 32 folder; for which I've (footloose) included Neowin UXTheme Multi-Patcher to do it with.

If you don't patch "uxtheme.dll," then you will need to install a program like StyleXP in order to run any of them.

Before installing any of the themes, use the Neowin UXTheme Multi-Patcher.
It will patch "uxtheme.dll" in the system 32 folder, so that you need not install
any third party software to run them.

Some of the themes come as a setup file. The ones that don't have a setup,

manually unpack them to:

C:WINDOWSResourcesThemes
