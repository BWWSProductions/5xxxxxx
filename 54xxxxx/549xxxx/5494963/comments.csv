[T],artpepper,2010-04-14T04:16Z,"Not that Chrome is bad (it's fast), but compared to FF, it lacks features: AdBlock, FlashBlock, etc etc..."
,scykei,2010-04-21T01:53Z,"Thanks but you DO know that Chrome has AdBlock, FlashBlock, etc, etc now with the introduction of extensions... :3

It happened quite a while ago..."
,Scattysit,2010-05-20T22:22Z,Interesting....no registration box popping up.

No need to bother with this since it might contain Viruses and Trojans!

Instead pick up the LATEST Winzip from its own site:

http://www.winzip.com/downwz.htm

And then just use:

name: WinZip

Serial: F7LH3-ZHK80-EJ7EF-WX4XC-HQW01-MGN9X

And DON'T FORGET to turn OFF the

>>Options>Configuration>Miscellaneous>Check For Updates!
Set it to: ""Do not check for updates"".


And do NOT let it install the Google Toolbar while installing Winzip ...
