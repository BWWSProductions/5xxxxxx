,al5ander,2010-05-04T16:55Z,This is excellent! I was looking for one broken down into individual chapters!

Hi Plaasjapie and TPB,

Thanks for the heads up, but I've already re-encoded all 13 books and assimilated into my audiobook library.  The total size of the series being 5.08gb.

Since I have an extensive audiobook collection, there are a set of standards that I employ in order to maximize quality and harddrive space.  As a pirate who happens to be blind as well, I do not think that ""regular audiobooks"" need to be in stereo and encoded at a high bitrate; ""special audiobooks"" are treated differently, however.

A ""regular audiobook"" contains mostly vocal elements, with perhaps small elements of music serving as intro or outtro queues, and without stereo being a vital part of delivering the presentation.  In this case, encoding at a bitrate of 32 mono using the mp3 Fraunhofer IIS encoder is adequate enough for me.

 a ""special audiobook"" contains multiple vocal elements, with both musical and sound effect elements, and stereo playing an important part of delivering the presentation.  In this case, encoding at a bitrate of 64 stereo also using the mp3 Fraunhofer IIS encoder is a better choice.

If a file is encoded at a bitrate of x in stereo, the file size will not change when encoding the file at the same bitrate in mono.  The difference will be in the quality, with the stereo encoding sounding much more poor than the mono.  This is because, with the stereo, there are two channels that add up to be the total size.  With the mono, there is only one channel, therefore, that one channel takes up the total size by itself.

Think of it this way.

Stereo encoding: 16 + 16 = 32 = 10mb
Mono encoding: 32 = 32 = 10mb

Stereo encoding: 32 + 32 = 64 = 20mb
Mono encoding: 64 = 64 = 20mb

The above equations are crude, but it illustrates the point nicely.

I think audiobooks encoded above a bitrate of 64 is simply overkill.  Alternatively, for music,  a bitrate of 192 should be the minimum, but higher is better.  With that said, it all depends on the type of encoder one uses.  MP3 Fraunhofer IIS encoder, brought to you by the creators of MP3's, does the best job at encoding at lower bitrates, and because of that reason, that is what I use.

If anyone who reads this would like for me to upload my Wheel of Time series coming in at about 5.08gb, do let me know, and I'll upload it.

Signed,
Glitch

,plaasjapie,2010-05-16T17:00Z,"Hi again Glitch

my encoding uses the Apple standard, AAC file at 64Kbps stereo / 32Kbps Mono. As you must know, AAC has a higher quality at those settings than MP3. in this world of large hard drives, I didn't see the point of reducing 15 days and 19 hours worth of audio to smaller than 9.6Gb.

I have over 135 audiobooks on my hard drive re-encoded at these settings, and it takes up less than 23Gb for 1176 hours worth of audio

,sascourge,2010-05-27T20:19Z,"thanks for the great download.  I read all the books as a younger man, but now I can listen to them at work, makes the night go by ALOT faster.

Rand was such a little whiny bitch at the beginning lol.

Question, what software do you use to combine the chapters/assemble the mp4 file?"
,plaasjapie,2010-06-13T03:36Z,Chapter and Verse
,lordfritz69,2010-06-18T00:22Z,thanks for the download your time and effort is appreciated
,Krinkovic,2010-06-20T16:13Z,"först o främst tack så väldigt älskar dessa böcker :)
nu en fråga:
varför finns det två prologer till crossroads of twilight?"
,Krinkovic,2010-06-20T16:15Z,"oops sorry forgot wich langauge to write in. what i meant to say was Thanks alot i love these books :) but i have a question:
why does crossroads of twilight have 2 prologues?"
,Krinkovic,2010-06-20T16:18Z,and will you upload the rest of the books when they become available? thx again :)
,Krinkovic,2010-06-27T22:44Z,"ok i have listened through ""the gathering storm"" 's prolouge, both the three parts in the TGS folder and the three parts in the ""new folder"" folder and the first three are missing two parts, one from gawyns POV and one from davram basheres POV. why haven't you said anything about it? took ages to listhen through both and figuring out what was missing."
,Krinkovic,2010-06-27T22:46Z,"oh sorry not the gathering storm, i meant crossroads of twilight"
,plaasjapie,2010-07-03T21:34Z,I didn't answer because I cant be asked. Figure it out.
,cros,2010-09-23T22:35Z,"How does this compare to this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5170255/Wheel_of_Time_audiobooks_(ALL_OF_THEM)

I downloaded that one and and I didn't have any problems.  It's about 2 gigs less with a bunch more seeders."
,smooth54,2010-10-08T00:32Z,"has any one gotten the 2nd of three books for the ending, ""Towers of Midnight""?"
,-SPQR-,2010-10-29T07:04Z,"@Glitch01: you suck!
you write a whole letter explaining why the quality is too high for you. screw you, I dont care why you like bad audio and small files.

@OP: thanks for your release. I already have the other 20gb release which is quite good, although it has a few glitches in certain parts. I am thinking about downloading it all again, maybe. :) better quality is always welcome.

,kool6988,2010-11-02T02:26Z,"@Glitch01

Does your version have lower sound quality? or is it just the same? Coz if it is, then I'd appreciate a smaller size. Thanks."
,Rashen_Riael,2010-11-10T02:38Z,"@Glitch,

I would really appreciate if you could upload the series in the smaller size.
thanks. "

,misterslippers,2011-03-20T00:52Z,"these are still cassettes though i do not know that they are not cassette rip im not sure the difference  book 2 has its rough spots including the word ""jason' interupting the audio twice, and often repeating the same sentence twice, and once i heard a cassette fast forwarding and it skipped a paragraph, and book one you hear ""this book continues on side two"" plaasjapie advertised them as higher quality not cassette rips"
,plaasjapie,2011-04-01T01:59Z,"These are not casette rips fucktard.

These books weren't released on cassette."

I love it when someone calls someone a fucktard and then makes a completely stupid comment.  "

i did not know that CD's had another 'side' to turn over to, as referenced in my post, and i have never heard a CD fast forward in a way that you could hear the tape in the audio, CD's mostly skip, the books are now available to purchase via download, but they were originally released as either audio cassetes or Cd's please make sure you are correct before calling me what you clearly are"
,plaasjapie,2011-09-23T02:42Z,Your link is by a different narrator. Dipshit.
,VampireMuffinMan,2012-01-29T06:21Z,"Great quality...even though the first two (I'm listening to the second now) appear to be cassette rips.  Mind you they are Excellent quality still.  I'm editing out the repeated sentences in book two and I tracked down (in my hardcovers) the garbled part of chapter 8 and the only word that was missing was ""We"" [not an entire paragraph] so I just copied that word from another part of the narration and pasted it in place of the garbled bit and done...  Now can anyone point me to the chapter in the first book that had the ""Continues on Side 2"" bit?  I don't fancy listening to the whole book again so I can find it.  lol"
