                         A documentary by Stelios Kouloglou.       
                John Perkins was a prominent member of the top-secret  
                team of "economic hit men", who used fraudulent fina- 
                ncial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion,  
                sex, military coups and murder to create the global   
                American empire after World War II. After a long      
                internal struggle between his guilt and the fear of   
                telling the truth, Perkins meets the daughter of an   
                assassinated president and speaks out in front of an  
                angry Latin-American audience.                        
                Based on rare propagandistic material, film-noir style 
                reconstructed sequences and exclusive filmed confessi-
                ons of best selling author John Perkins ("Confessions  
                of an Economic Hit Man", "The Secret History of the   
                American Empire") this fascinating documentary sheds  
                light on the unknown mechanisms used by the rulers of 
                the modern world, the roots of Islamic terrorism, and 
                the reason why most of the worlds population lives in 
                poverty. The definitive answer to President Bush's    
                question "why do they hate us?"...

   Aka Confessions Of An Economic Hitman. IMDB list it  
   as a 2007 production, but its actually 2008.         
   Unfortunately the RETAIL DVD has hardcored Greek     
   subs, but the movie language is English. Also you    
   may notice that in some parts of the movie, it may   
   look like its uncropped on the left/right side, its  
   because of some of the videos the director used, so  
   if we cropped more, we'd cut a lot of picture from   
   the main movie.
