,blgarath,2010-04-20T14:41Z,Will not play.  VLC says that it is protected.  All I get is a pixilized pink screen and it ain't a close-up.  :p
,chippychek,2010-04-21T03:18Z,Windows Media Player says codec is out of date and asks to download another which usually means a virus or some other such problem.  VLC won't play as previous comment mentioned.  Don't download!
