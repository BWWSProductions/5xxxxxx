many peers have very slow internet(as you'll find out) but please be generous and seed over 2 ratio if you can (you know who you are;from US, Scandinavians, Ned to Rom..) please help.. it will be very appreciated, I'm sure many peers would be willing to seed generously but they got only apx 25 kB/s upload, this torrent I already seeded over 20 Ratio. Thx for your understanding."
