Founding father of hip-hop whose experiments in musical fusion (he has worked with John Lydon, UB40, James Brown) exemplifies hip-hopâ€™s versatility. 


His massively successful 1982 Tommy Boy single â€œPlanet Rockâ€ melded hip-hop beats with Kraftwerkâ€™s techno-pop futurism, giving birth to the electro genre and influencing techno, house and Miami bass scenes to the present day. 


1997â€™s â€œZulu Grooveâ€ includes 1984â€™s â€œWorld Destructionâ€ [featuring John Lydon] and the popular title track.
