,karliboy,2010-04-11T20:11Z,nice upload mate! but there's supposed to be 16 tracks on this album.
,Essex_N17,2010-04-18T17:55Z,"It has got 16 tracks. Track 6 is listed twice.
I think a little renaming session should do the trick ;-)"

I'll wait till I see the 2CD version out there :-)"
,Billo007666,2010-04-25T15:03Z,"The album 100% has 16 tracks, and this torrent also has 16 tracks. Nothing missing. Some tags need to be changed though, especially as there appear to be two No.6 tracks which is clearly wrong. The link on play.com is missing the first track ""moonshine"", but is not actually missing on the album. The person who put up the tracklist on that site obviously made a mistake. Thanks for this btw, bought the limited edition because it's such a great album, Long live Weller."
