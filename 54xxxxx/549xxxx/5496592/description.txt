|  Alu is a singer/songwriter from the Los Angeles area. But, when we call   |
|  her a singer/songwriter she tends to lean towards a Bjork and Tori Amos   |
|  sound over your conventional singers out there. When the record first     |
|  strikes up and that quite and minimalistic beat kicks in you know that    |
|  "Lobotomy Sessions" is going to be a special record.                      |
|                                                                            |
|  The record gives us a lot of different styles and looks. Starting with a  |
|  track like "Martian Rendezvous" which is very "Bjorkian" in style and     |
|  substance. The track is built around a lot of odd noises and the          |
|  occasional string pops in and out of the track. "Casket Salesman" has     |
|  the structure and the hook that could make it a solid pop song but the    |
|  music sounds like a mix of Massive Attack meets the Adams Family theme    |
|  song. But, the results are really cool as the finger snapping and the     |
|  old rickety noises give it that full effect. "Circus Cosmos" gives out    |
|  that bedroom recording styles with a sweet track that has a great         |
|  overall lo-fi sound.                                                      |
|                                                                            |
|  Alu's second album is a stunning record that drives you from start to     |
|  finish. The record is a perfect late night record as it gives plenty of   |
|  a dark shaded tracks for you to hide underneath and get thrown into a     |
|  sweet slumber. "Lobotomy Sessions" is a dark and mysterious track that    |
|  will up Alu's stature. She has a great voice for the downtempo chilled    |
|  out style of pop. I would love to hear her on the next Massive Attack     |
|  record as well. -by John Siwicki                                          |
