Ana, a 28-year-old young woman, lives in a small port of the great Chilean South. She is shy and extremely reserved. Without any real prospects for the future or ambition, she lives with her sick mother whom she takes care of. Every evening, she hangs out with Veronica, age 37, whose expansive, wild personality is diametrically opposed to her own. She is also friends with Marta, a somewhat retarded girl who tries by any and all means to win Ana's love. Accused of theft, Ana is dismissed from her job as cashier in the village grocer's shop. Now unemployed, she doesn't know what to do. Veronica finds her work with Toro, a 45-year-old man who leads a solitary existence outside the village. He is a recluse, a stranger, and no one knows much about him. Ana will soon become his only link with the outer world. Each of the characters will trace his or her own path, by confronting the other characters, and try to find salvation in love, sex or family affection, not so much to assuage their deep solitude as to (re)discover themselves.
