[V],mothergoose56,2010-04-14T21:34Z,"Don't get too excited, it's seeding too slow and I gotta move. I am going to up a z share of the file in about 5 minutes so hopefully some kind soul will seed out for the rest of the peeps. If not I'll seed again in a few hours when I can. "
[V],mothergoose56,2010-04-14T21:41Z,"OK, here's the link:

http://www.*share.net/audio/74969823d018d650/

(change * to z)

Stop the torrent and replace the mp3 file with the complete one and then re-start the torrent. Sorry about that (I would have had to wait till later) - I'll up R&F in about 3 hours....."
