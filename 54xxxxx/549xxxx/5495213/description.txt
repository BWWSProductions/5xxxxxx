DiAMOND NOTES
iMBT & Pocahontas werenâ€™t retail. Retail AR for this title is 1.78:1 in both R1 (where ours is from) and R2 (where IMBTs is from) and not 2.35:1 as those releases and the MULTI reencoded DVDR where they were sourced from. We also decided to go 3CD with AC3 for the best presentation possible. Enjoy at long last the giant smurf movie as it was intended to be seen.
