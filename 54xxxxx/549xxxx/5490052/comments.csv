[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-10T22:21Z,"ok so i only uploaded this because it was requested twice, my copy of this record is in BAD condition, so i had to do ALOT of click and crackle removal throughout all 4 sides, side C is the worst by far, so don't comment on the quality.

i mostly want people to see what a bad record sounds like, so when i put a good on, you'll be able to tell.

and i will re-record this album when i find a new copy :D

What ADC (analog-digital-converter) did you use? What soundcard?
Thaks again mate!"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-12T13:21Z,"i have an asus p4s8x in integrated hd sound card, and i use the recording tool in sony sound forge to record through the line-in. pretty simple really."
,rosma32,2010-04-12T21:16Z,"Ok : ) 
If you like to listen to flawless audio or record old vinyls, my tip is to buy an second-hand semi-professional soundcard. I myself first thought that onboard audiocards were just fine, but then I got an second-hand EMI Juli@ for 50 euros. Totally worth it! Cheers again : ) "
[V],HMVinyl,2010-04-13T07:30Z,"thx :D will check it out. i'm mostly looking for a sound card that has RCA inputs, for direct recording so i dont have to use an adaptor "
