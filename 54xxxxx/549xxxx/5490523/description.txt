Storyline:

Three years ago, two young scientists teamed up to save New York City from an roach-borne epidemic that was killing thousands of children.
Their miracle of genetic engineering was the Judas Breed, an insect whose enzimes proved deadly to the disease-carrying roaches.
However, their creation has come back to haunt them, altering the balance of nature and tipping the scales in favor of the insects.
The thing created in the lab has changed, and now, out there in the city it has begun to mimic the most dangerous predator of all---humans.
