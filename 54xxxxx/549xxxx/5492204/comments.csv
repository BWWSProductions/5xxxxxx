I don't know why but what I can see with the quality of this film, it feels like I'm watching a DVD screener. One more thing the ""Day of the Dead"" when the scene is in ""fast motion"", I don't know what it called but it look like ""scale lines""? Could be problems with video encoding?

Anyway thanks for uploading :)
