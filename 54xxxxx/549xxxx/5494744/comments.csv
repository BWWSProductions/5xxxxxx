,gamer2010,2010-05-23T14:30Z,how to make all the missions in missions menu 
,chuckmamuck,2010-05-23T19:40Z,"gamer
you just have to click on what mission you want to fly in the FOX configurator and it then loads it into fsx where it will permanently be after you've loaded it.
theres 300 flights so its better that way than them all being in fsx at once.
just choose ya flight from the configurator then when you open fsx it will be there in the missions."
