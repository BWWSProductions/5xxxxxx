Quality is very good..., if played back on a PC, but I would think that most people would like to watch on a flatscreen-TV, but this is just awfull and terrible, it is VERY pixelated and has large block-building, therefore unwatchable on a TV. Seems like just about all of the *.mkv's made by ""DIMENSION"" have this problem. Could this not be correctly encoded? But, thank you for your time and effort, would you PLEASE try to encode - so that it is TV compatible. That would really be nice. "
