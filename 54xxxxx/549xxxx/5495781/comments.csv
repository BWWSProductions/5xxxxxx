,avist,2010-05-19T16:30Z,"Hey, thanks for this. I lost my save file due to a power outage and an overzealous diskcheck (I think), and I was just about to start memory 14 after collecting all the codex pages.

Unfortunately I found out that the game doesn't let you repeat memories after completion of the game so...I'm screwed :'("
,tayab_076,2010-06-08T22:58Z,Can anyone post a save game after the cheaters never prosper mission. I just cant get through this mission cus of a stupid glitch.
,lgfjkhfg,2010-06-17T20:16Z,What happened when you finished the DNA 100%? Did the people outside the Animus (Baby/Two-point-oh) say anything? Did you leave the Animus (Baby/Two-point-oh)? Just wondering cause I finished everything except for those last Secret Locations (How did you find them?) Thanks
,dante_91,2010-06-25T18:53Z,"@lgfjkhfg   Nothing happened after I finished the game. About the secret locations, I unlocked them after I found those two 999 save files on the web (can't remember exactly where)"
,lgfjkhfg,2010-06-26T12:38Z,Thanks man
