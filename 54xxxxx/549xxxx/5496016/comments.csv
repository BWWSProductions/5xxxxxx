Download a season, watch the season. Delete the season!!! wow I'm smart. There, now your not taking up much space!!! Tv-out to a nice lcd, and get an $80 surround system. Now watching High quality rips on the computer is your preferable alternitive!! I just simply don't understand the desire of so many for SMALLER and CRAPPIER files, when decent quality files are so rare, and true 5.1 surround is almost unheard of. I just watched all 9 seasons of smallville, and couldn't find 1 freaking season in 5.1 on the entire internet, because people are so obsessed with trimming the goodness down to 350mb crap-ass files. When i decided i'd watch ST:TNG next, I was THRILLED to find out some GENIUS had decided to actually make a torrent availble with 5.1. Sir, i'm so sorry you did all this work to provide people with exquisite videos, FOR NO PROFIT, just to make people happy, and assholes actually COMPLAIN at you for it. These complaints I refer to were actually on an unrelated torrent, not this one. The guy said ""this isn't even better than the 350mb rips, it's blurry, if someone wanted 5.1 surround and good quality they'd by the DVD etc..."" totally wrong. This is above and beyond anything else.If watching tv episodes on your computer is a hobby, why watch ass-crap?? I don't understand."

[V],meech,2010-10-16T05:06Z,"theoldfarter:
The reason why it probably wasn't working, was 1. you have the ""definitely disable subtitles"" option checked.  And 2: you had the option: """"Switch to tsMuxer when H264 video is ps3 compatible and there's no configured subs"".  So the combination of those two options told ps3mediaserver to switch to tsMuxer.  However, back when I was ripping/encoding these files, the ripper I used at the time was having trouble making files compatible with tsMuxer (it is actually a bug in tsMuxer that had to be eventually worked around in the ripping program).  That's why I made the note in the torrent description that these ""may not work properly with TSMuxer"".  The options you had were causing ps3mediaserver to try to play them with TSMuxer.  Once you unchecked that option, TSMuxer no longer kicks in and MEncoder should work fine.  At least I think that's what happened (-:  My more recent rips (DS9, SG-1, Farscape) should work with both Mencoder and TSMuxer."

,cesar3dg,2011-05-27T20:00Z,"i forgot, to those who complain about size, i recomend them to move to Blu Ray, its not that expensive now and you can fit two seasons in one disc, dvd's are kind of outdated already, you just cant fit a good 1080p movie on a dvd."
