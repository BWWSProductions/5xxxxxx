This is a high quality, full resolution, high profile h264 dvd rip of Star Trek Next Generation - Season 6.  These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on a 50 inch lcd/surround sound system.

Please seed when you are done...I good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded...thanks!!


p.s. ATT PS3 MEDIA SERVER (which I use for these) USERS : Make sure to disable ASS/SSA Subtitles.  Also, these files may not work properly with TSMuxer...use the MEncoder engine(default) instead. Also if using MEncoder, if you have problems with audio sync, try unchecking AV/Sync Alternative Method.
