,Ezlin,2010-04-14T01:05Z,"Thanks for the quality works, and congrats on getting purple skulled."
[V],globeplus,2010-04-15T00:01Z,"I appreciate that in theway that i do the correct work to have the files ok , the intention is always getting the best size possible for a game keeping the all game more as possible without beeing obcecated getting every single mega , wahat i mean is a good analysis of the what can be the work in a game file is important too , i am uploading files for many years now and the users independtly of symbols already know my work , knowing very well that they count on me for a nice work on the games , so it is very easy to me without beeing arrogant and i proved in all this years to have the trust from the users that get my files , little circunstancial problems any user can have even with real copys , what is important when i finish a work is to have the conscience that the correct work for that game was done and if i have to repeat the work probably do it in the same way , so , thank you pirate bay for the recognising of the trust in my files and it is for me very easy to keep that trust . thank you ."

I know you get a lot of requests but it would be phenomenal if you ripped GTA IV Episodes from Liberty City, 16 gigabytes is huge. Thanks if this does happen."
[V],globeplus,2010-04-17T12:32Z,"i am very happy with this last fantastic comments , having in consideration that they express appreciation for the hard work with a good analysis on the games that i am beeing maded , about the game you refered the new gta , i donÂ´t get him working properly for the moment , the maximim i get is to reach the menus with hte episodes but then when i launch any of them i get a black screen continously without a way out , what i mean is we probably have to wait some more time until have the game ok to the users , is noway that i am uploading a file that the users have to wait uncertain time to play but i leave the promiss that when it will be possible to do the work , i will do it and thanks again for the respectfull generosity of your comments . thank you ."

,Zamorak1,2010-06-09T23:26Z,"Could you upload a patched rip of this one? Very good updates, including an increase of 15 FPS on higher resolutions."
,Zamorak1,2010-06-10T00:32Z,Apparently the official patch doesn't work with this rip... So it'd be kind if you made a compatible one. Somehow.
