The 50 Key Positions of the Kama Sutra in 3D (red-cyan glasses needed)

According to the Kama Sutra, amorous desire and sexual pleasures are
prerequisites to world harmony. The Kama Sutra, also called the Book of Love,
comes to us from India and values a form of eroticism that leads to spiritual
realization. It teaches that the goal of sexual union is not only pleasure, but
also mutual evolution. Each successful union should aim for double ecstasy, with
each partner trying to bring the other to orgasm as well as finding a way to
reach orgasm for him or herself.

The 50 most representative positions from the Kama Sutra have been chosen to
initiate you in this awakening to sexual pleasure and to bring you a step closer
to mastering your passions.
