Thankful for this OST none the less. Thanks man"

,Avarik,2010-04-23T01:55Z,"Soundtracks generally deserve FLAC, but I think 320k is fine.
 Thanks for the upload!"
,coolintorrents,2010-04-28T14:34Z,"lol dumb ass like @Desolator4u dont understand things like the Sun is Hot and Snow is Cold

This is the same: 192kb/s is a light quality and 320kb/s the music has another quality and its diferent ... so if you dont understant that my speach about Sun and Snow, please: Kill your self =)

,kiteofdark,2010-05-04T08:09Z,"Man...I'm kinda pissed. There are several tracks in the game that I don't hear in this soundtrack, specifically the fighting music from the airfield.

I hope someone makes a game rip."
