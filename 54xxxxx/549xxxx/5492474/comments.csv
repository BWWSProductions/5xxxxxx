,xenu dot net,2010-04-13T10:53Z,"Great job. Thank you! I have liked your previous Heroes uploads of season 1 and 2.   Having the subtitles included with a rip is excellent.  I have bought the Heroes DVD, but it is a lot more convenient for me to have your rip on my popcorn hour harddrive so I can watch any episode anywhere, even streaming on 3G.

I hope you keep ripping tv series, and my personal wish would be for a RiddlerA complete rip of all seasons of Sopranos.
