Huey Dunbar, (born Eustace Dunbar IV on May 15, 1974), was the former singer of Dark Latin Groove. Born to a Puerto Rican mother and a Jamaican father, he was exposed to music since his earliest years due to his parents' musical careers. His hits with the band included "La Quiero a Morir", "Juliana", "No MorirÃ¡", "VolverÃ©", "Todo Mi CorazÃ³n", and a remake of Ricardo Montaner's original classic "Me Va a ExtraÃ±ar".
