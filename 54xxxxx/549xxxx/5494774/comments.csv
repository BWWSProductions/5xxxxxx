,Heretic1808,2010-04-14T09:45Z,"I googled this, and it actually looks amazing! it completely overhauls HL2s graphics, replaces the blurry textures with HD ones, uses unreleased content, etc. for this one to work you have to have HL2 and bith episodes installed, if your missing one of them just google cinematic mod and get the right version"
,rocco_sifredi,2010-04-14T12:54Z,"what does this package contain? The texture (mod itself) ONLY...or is there included the half Life 2 kit + ep 1 and 2, as well ? It's not clear. And WHY do I have to choose a ...""version"" of that mod to...""suit"" the half life 2 kit , as that comment said or is he mistaken ?"
,hpbifta,2010-04-14T16:00Z,"This package contains just the latest version of the mod itself, NOT HL2, HL2-Ep1/2.

What it actually contains is far more than just a texture mod, The game engine has been tweaked, models have been massively updated with much larger poly-counts and a lot more. The whole point of the mod was to turn HL2 into a far cinematic story with WOW quality graphics. 
The game pace has changed slightly due to this, but most people who have ever used this mod all consider a vast improvement over the original game.

The rason for finding the correct version of the mod is down to what parts of HL2 you have installed, as the mod requires certain objects and stuff from the GCF game files each version has to be tailored to the content available, otherwise you will get in game and all sorts could crash or just look stupid.

One note also is that if I remember right the mod combines all three story lines into one much larger game, you just play through, theres no loading HL2, then Ep1 then Ep2 it`s just one long game starting with Gordon waking up on the train into City 17 and finishing with the Strider battle from Ep2. Once Ep3 is complete I am sure there will be yet another version of this mod combining all 4 games."
,rocco_sifredi,2010-04-15T10:51Z,"thx for the explanations , now is crystal clear. How do I know which version of mod works with which version of game ? Do I have to search for this info or...in the readme of the mod it says what version is and what half life 2 version I need?"
,hpbifta,2010-04-15T19:52Z,Just go here >  http://www.cinematicmod.com and check the download details on each version of the mod to find out which one you will need if you are missing Ep2 for example.
,vinniem,2010-05-02T22:03Z,"I have downloaded this and it contains a full Halflife 2/Ep1/Ep2 (and even HL1). It features a custom installer (in Russian though, but just click the right buttons :)). After installing it is 34GB in size, so it's definitely not just the mod itself. Only thing is that all the spoken language is in Russian by default, but you can change that in the file \fakefact.ini and remove the lines with ""russian"" in it."
,_keen,2010-05-11T17:28Z,"does this pack contain all the files you need from the orange box?

I didn't get the CM mod to work when I downloaded it from fakefactory, and installed it with a pirated orange box"
,_keen,2010-05-12T18:51Z,"I got it to work, I just opened the configurator and choose english. For some reason the HL2 EP2 english GCF was missing, just copied it from the orange box and it worked :-). Everything you need is in this pack, except for the small issue I had this works flawlessly

remember to go to the character pimper to choose the models you want installed into the CM mod before you start playing"
,sicmofo,2010-05-16T09:26Z,will this work on the orange box offered through torrents?
,Jackal331,2010-06-05T17:12Z,It says my steam isnt running (which is) when I want to start the game. Any ideas ?

,_luciferi,2011-08-29T08:23Z,"Works perfectly fine on win7 ultimate 64bit and looks awesome. Thanks for this.

Problems noticed so far:
-missing the file posted by others in the comments (hl2ep2.gcf). I wasn't able to start h2 without it.
-the moment you pick up the crowbar your reticle becomes a capital q, 'Q', and it's ridiculously annoying and I don't know how to fix that. Haven't played past that chapter yet, so I don't know if it fixes itself later down the road.
-The train that is supposed to come by in the 3rd part of the first chapter doesn't come by and there is no animations for it at all, only sound. Probably intentional to avoid the stuttering issues with hl2, but idk so im just posting."
,Echelon2009,2012-01-04T07:53Z,"works like a charm , tnx thenoobish.

,danwat1234,2012-04-01T23:08Z,"@Everyone, Cinematic Mod 11.05 is out! It's SO awesome! Thank you FakeFactory!"
