Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



This is a live concert that the Afro-Cuban All-Stars performed in Japan in 2004. I believe most of the original members that were featured in Ry Cooder's 'The Buena Vista Social Club' had passed away, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this concert. The Afro-Cuban All-Stars are TOP-NOTCH, fantastic musicians and this is a GREAT concert.

I've included the "Extras" which are brief personal clips of some of the members of the band. Enjoy!  :)
