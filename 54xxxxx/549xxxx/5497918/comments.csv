,beccyd,2010-04-16T14:44Z,"Shame, it loaded perfectly, but won't allow me to open any of the contents once on the Dashboard, or from within C: Office.

Thanks anyway."
,poisonof143,2010-04-16T15:36Z,"Thanx man, worked perfectly

,antman872,2010-04-17T21:48Z,"IT IS SAFE TO DO THE CRITICAL UPDATE IN THE AUTO UPDATR. also works great use serial provided and also any name works, i used my own and my own development team as the business"
,vodkaboy1976,2010-04-18T22:37Z,"Dont think that this is real, as the email program that is included is Entourage, and Office 2011 has replaced Entourage with Outlook for Mac. Haven't Installed to confirm, as it doesn't seem right..."
,misanthropic_pony,2010-04-19T03:28Z,"@vodkaboy1976
Just installed this - it includes Outlook for Mac 2011 version 14.0.0 (100326)
Entourage is nowhere to be seen.
Everything is working great so far."
,syrokid,2010-04-19T17:25Z,"I have downloaded program no problem, can't find serial key, text file is blank, any ideas"
,goldlite,2010-04-22T17:15Z,Works beautifully!!  Thank you so very much!!
,Ogawa08,2010-04-23T16:40Z,"Installed perfectly!  Thanks!

Can't get exchange working in outlook though.  Hotmail and Gmail work great, but not my exchange account.

Anyone else having this problem or know a solution?"
,Beephe,2010-04-24T02:20Z,"File seems fine but everytime I install and try using the various programmes they crash - all except outlook which works fine? 

Removed all evidence of  Office 2008 before trying to install 2011 (Kept microsoft data for '08' on external drive) but nothing seems to work.
Did I leave something behind that is causing this?
I'm running 10.6.3.

Seems others are having success - could it be that they didn't have Office on in first place.
Anyone got any ideas to try, otherwise I'll wait until official copy is available"
,ashn2k,2010-04-24T08:32Z,"I have the same problems as Phebee, all programs except Outlook can't work, asap I open them, they crash immediately. Anyone knows why :( "
,drsquirlz,2010-04-24T23:20Z,"@ashn2k
Uhmm, because it's still in beta and not meant for public release...?"
,danicsilva,2010-04-26T15:10Z,"Work's fine where, much better than 2008 version

Running SL 10.6.3"
,gasolara2002,2010-04-26T16:57Z,Great Software. I will not use open office anymore.

,zeth006,2010-05-09T11:25Z,Does this include OneNote?  This is probably the one improvement that would bring Mac users to Office in droves.  
,mattk37,2010-05-11T01:17Z,"@Beephe, ashn2k, and anyone experiencing crashes every time:

This is due to an issue with duplicate fonts.  To fix this:
1.  Open Font Book
2.  Select all fonts (? + A)
3.  Option/Right Click the fonts
4.  Select ""Resolve Duplicates""
5.  Done!!!

This worked immediately for me and now i am enjoying the 'new' equation editor that was not on mac office before now..."
,swaye,2010-05-11T23:16Z,does anyone know how long I can use this beta before becomming disfuctional?
,Beephe,2010-05-12T06:09Z,"Mattk37

,FitchleyHornbuckle,2010-05-15T07:01Z,"Installs and runs great, however, just today, I received a notification that this beta release will expire in 10 days (May 25). Not sure if anyone else got this yet."
,mrsatchmo50,2010-05-15T10:29Z,Yes I did also
,FitchleyHornbuckle,2010-05-16T04:25Z,"We may be forced back to 2008 if there isn't a fix soon. Not that I like doing it, but if I set my calendar back a few months, would that buy me more time?"
,danielmiro,2010-05-16T22:48Z,"Expire show up in my system too..
