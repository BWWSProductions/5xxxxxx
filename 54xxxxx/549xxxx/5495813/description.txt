Opie and Anthony April 14, 2010

The source cut out for about twenty minutes right in the beginning while they were discussing Ant's date, it also cut out at the end for I duno how long.  I will find a better copy later and fix what is missing.  Until then here is an incomplete copy. Sorry 'bout that.
