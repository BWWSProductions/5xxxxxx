sure would be nice if your *.mkv's would be encoded so that they could also be watched on a HD-TV, (pixelated blockbuilding). Therefore not watchable on HD-TV. Plays OK on a PC, but who wants to watch a high quality mkv only on a PC?
Please encode your mkv's so that that are also watchable on a HD-TV! That would really be nice and much appreciated. Thanks though for your time and effort!"
