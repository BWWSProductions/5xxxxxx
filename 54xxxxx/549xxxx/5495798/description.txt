In AD 2154,[14] humans are engaged in the colonization of Pandora, the lush moon of Polyphemus, one of three gas giants that orbit Alpha Centauri A,[14] 4.3 light years from Earth. Pandora is filled with incredible life forms, and is home to the Naâ€™vi, an indigenous sentient humanoid race who are considered primitive by human standards, yet are more physically capable than them. The Na'vi are tailed, slender creatures with sparkling blue skin, standing three meters tall. They live in harmony with their unspoiled world, which the humans have found to be rich with unobtanium, a valuable mineral that is essential to remedying an economic and energy crisis that is gripping Earth.
