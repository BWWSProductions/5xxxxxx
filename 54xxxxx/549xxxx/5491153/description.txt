Book Description
================
Long ago, a human astrophysicist, Inigo, began dreaming scenes from 
the life of a remarkable human being named Edeard, who lived within 
the Void, a self-contained microuniverse at the heart of the galaxy. 
There, under the beneficent gaze of mysterious godlike entities, humans 
possessed uncanny psychic abilities, and Edeard's were the strongest 
of all. Equally strong was his determination to bring justice and freedom 
to a world terrorized by criminal violence and corruption. 

Inigo's inspirational dreams, shared by hundreds of millions throughout 
the galaxy-spanning gaiafield, gave birth to a religion---Living Dream. 
But when the appearance of a Second Dreamer seemed to trigger the expansion 
of the Void---an expansion that is devouring everything in its path---the 
Intersolar Commonwealth was thrown into turmoil. With the adherents 
of Living Dream determined to set forth on a dangerous pilgrimage into 
the Void, interstellar war threatens to erupt. 

With time running out, the fate of humanity hinges on a handful of people. 
There is Araminta, only now awakening to the unwelcome fact that she 
is the mysterious Second Dreamer---and to the dire responsibilities 
that go with it; Inigo, whose private dreams hint at a darker truth 
behind Edeard's legendary life; Paula Myo, the ruthless field operative 
of the Commonwealth, whose search for Araminta and Inigo is about to 
yield a most unpleasant surprise; and Justine, whose desperate gamble 
places her within the Void, where the godlike Skylords hold the power 
to save the universe...or destroy it.
