The movie opens with John Tyree (Channing Tatum), a young soldier from the Army Special Forces, lying on the ground in his army gear with gunshot wounds. Coins begin to fall over him as he recalls a childhood trip to the U.S. Coin mint. He goes on to compare himself to a coin in the United States of America's army and states that the last thing he thought about before he blacked out, was "You".

In 2000, John is on leave when he meets Savannah Lynn Curtis (Amanda Seyfried), a college student on spring break. In a matter of days, Savannah and John fall in love. John meets Savannah's family as well as her neighbor, Tim Wheddon (Henry Thomas) and Tim's autistic son, Alan, who looks up to Savannah. Savannah meets and befriends John's father, a reclusive man who is only interested in his coin collection.
