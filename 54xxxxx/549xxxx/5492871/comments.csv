,ettin,2010-04-17T05:17Z,"Ok, so heres the deal with cs5, i installed AE and PPRO and while they are both more or less the same as cs4 as far as features go, they are actually stable on win7 x64, where cs4 was inoperable. 

Premiere is missing the timewarp effect (placing the ae timewarp plugin into premiere doesnt work) and you can no longer cut and paste keyframes across clips (but you can still duplicate them within a clip). Premiere does appear to be able to playback much better with unrendered effects and rendering actually works for once. The fact that timewarp is missing totally makes cs5 useless, as thats one of the most important tools there is, so go figure, adobe actually manages to make premiere work properly but they dont have enough sense to leave a critical tool in it. 

As for validation, the serial keys work, but adobe eventually phones home and invalidates them, so if anyone has a firewall installed where they can log the connections, please post the addresses so we can add it to our hosts lists and block them."
,ettin,2010-04-17T08:57Z,"Turns out all you have to do to keep it from invalidating your key is use peerblock with the level 1 (p2p) and level 2 (corporations) blocklists enabled. This will block adobes servers and all its third party companies like OpSource Inc and Archer Communications.

They changed their licensing mechanism from flexnet to PACE which from the little ive read works sort of like a rootkit, so caveat emptor."
,JackBack,2010-04-17T09:39Z,"Ettin, Both Premier Pro CS4 and After Effects CS4 work perfectly with Windows Seven 64x. Works perfectly for me. You might want to check that out again. "

this codename for beta version"
,dcoryh192,2010-04-17T17:21Z,"""White Rabbit"" is simply Adobe's codename for Photoshop CS5, just like ""Stonehenge"" with PS CS4. It doesn't have anything to do with whether it is beta or not."
,hunnicuddler,2010-04-17T20:36Z,"for Premiere and After Effects system requirements are for 64 bit Win Vista or 7.. and at least 4GB RAM.. ok.. I'll stick to C4 for them two then. 

Fast download speeds reaching 500kbps :D"
,ettin,2010-04-17T20:54Z,"Jackback, 

go fuck yourself troll. 


Interesting thing ive noticed, when peerblock is enabled (block http!, sorry i forgot to mention that), if you open premiere and then AE, or vice versa, it will tell try to contact adobes servers and tell you the program has crashed, which is bullshit because you can open the program back up and it works fine. 

So for instance if you open PPRO, and then AE, it will give you a crash message upon opening, and then you can open AE back up. If you close everything down and open them back up in the same sequence it wont happen anymore, but if you open AE first and then PPRO it will exhibit the same behavior, which will go away if you always open the programs up in the same sequence. 

Otherwise everything works great. Thanks adobe! i was going to give you $1k but now i think i'll just tell you to go fuck yourselves."
,ettin,2010-04-18T09:08Z,"NM, it appears it still invalidated itself even with peerblock on. Either its using a ip bluetack is unaware or its the PACE rootkit that comes with it thats bypassing the ip filter driver. 

Oh well, its going to get cracked by the time the trial runs out, and all it takes to refresh it is a reinstall. 

I'd like to extend one more gracious fuck you to adobe, you finally made a functional program but you still managed to leave out so many key editing features, and why you bothered to rewrite them from scratch and not even had the sense to merge them into one program can only be described as pure fucking incompetence. 

I only hope your shit company tanks so someone with half a wit can take your place. "
,someonegotmyusername,2010-04-18T12:23Z,ettin cs4 works flawlessly on w7 x64. never had a crash. you seem obsessed with some little crap plug-in. i assure you most serious editors don't rely on one crappy one trick effect.

,ettin,2010-04-21T01:42Z,"I found a solution, just install a firewall like comodo, put it in custom policy mode, let all the adobe stuff connect so it gets added to your network policy, then edit the allow rule of the main program exe's, and set the destination ip to 127.0.0.1, then add a block rule, destination ip 127.0.0.1 and check the ""exclude box"", which will prevent the programs from connecting to the internet but still allow them to communicate with eachother.  Apparently peerblock doesnt have every adobe ip so it eventually gets through. "
,cintronix,2010-04-21T04:56Z,"@ ettin.  I installed this the other day and it locked up and rejected my keys the first time I launched a CS5 app.  I'm installing Comodo Firewall now.  Can you PM me detailed instructions on how to set it up where CS5 will work?

Thanks braddah!"
,ettin,2010-04-22T06:22Z,"Ill just write it here for everyone. 

1. Uninstall CS5 if its on your system. 

2. Install comodo firewall, dont bother installing threatsense, dnsservers, antivirus, or malware defense or any of the other crap comodo puts in the installer. Also you can uninstall comodo live help afterwards since theres no way to not install it. 

3. Set firewall level to custom policy. 

3. Install CS5. Block all connection attempts (checking 'remember my decision') during the process. 

4. Open each program one at a time. Allow any connection attempts made to 127.0.0.1, and block anything else, remembering to check ""remember my decision'. 

Two programs you'll definitely want to block are 
Logtransport2.exe and PDapp.exe. 

5. Go into the main comodo program, click the firewall button on the top bar, click advanced over on the left, and click network security policy. 

6. Select each main program like PPRo and AE, and click edit, select the allow rule you made so the program would open, click edit, and change the destination address to 127.0.0.1. Then add a new rule, action:block, destination address 127.0.0.1,  check the 'exclude' box.

The main program exe's, in addition to the two i mentioned before, will attempt to phone home, sometimes long after the programs have been closed. This will allow the programs to communicate with eachother but prevent them from contacting adobe and harassing you. 

If you get a popup box afterwards asking you to block/allow a connection from the main programs, it can add a rule that will effectively negate your other rules, so check your network policy if that happens to make sure everything is as you left it. "
,ettin,2010-04-22T06:47Z,"One more note,

For your completely blocked exe's, set it to block, ip, in/out. 

For the main exe's, set the block rule to block, ip, out. For the allow rule, set it to allow, ip, out. Otherwise it will default at TCP/UDP IN/OUT, which would leave it vulnerable to external connections and alternate protocols.
