But I have no grudges because this is the R-E-A-L Batman movie. But the problem is that I was getting a speed only in some SINGLE digits and for a long time now the downloading is stopped. PEOPLE, PLEASE SEED!!! I WILL SEED THIS MOVIE ***5 TIMES*** AT LEAST, BECAUSE THIS IS THE GREATEST BATMAN MOVIE EVER. But unfortunately, at the time of commenting this, there are 10 seeders right now and yet I am not getting any speed. PLEASE PEOPLE....SEED."
,LingvoX3,2010-07-04T12:29Z,Alright. I allocated some more bandwidth to this release. :-)

First of all make sure that ffdshow (libavcodec) is enabled to decode VC-1."
