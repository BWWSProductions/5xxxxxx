,FSmonster,2010-04-14T10:59Z,"I notice that Raymondhome never actually credits the makers of the movie..... all his little buddies get a right proper felching, but not the people who actually contributed.

I wonder if Buddha is comfortable with you thieving from others to proseletyse for him ?

Hey dont get me wrong, were all thieves here... just some of us are sanctimonius, delusional wankers like your man raymond here."

A=9/10
V=9/10
Thank you.
This movie has to be the singularly worst drama I have ever seen. Both of the leading actors were annoyingly over-melodramtic. John continually threw his toys out of the cot and hit people... not the most lovable character for a love story. She was just feeble and messed with his head. Don't waste your download time on this.
Movie=0.5/10"

,ashleysmashley007,2010-05-08T00:22Z,"great torrent.. but this movie was a bunch of hype.. in my opinion the beginning and the ending didnt quite come together well.. i mean i guess he finally got the girl in the end but it just didnt make sense to me how in the beginning it was all about falling in love with eachother and their dang love letters and then all of a sudden, she leaves him, marries another dude, his dad dies and then he comes home.. i dunno.. i thought the movie was lame.. i feel like it was a waste of a dvd but thanks to the uploader =)"
,taker455,2010-05-08T06:09Z,good quality 9/10....shit second half of the movie

,AveFroman,2010-09-21T02:29Z,"I agree that this is a great torrent, but the movie was a total let down.  I completely concur w/ ashleymashley because she's right, I was like in tears for 3/4 of the movie and then at the end I was like WTF?!?  You want it to be an epic love tale, like the Notebook and it just didn't deliver.  The ending totally sucked.  And another movie that the creator of the Notebook did, which was another monumental piece of crap was The Last Song with Miley Cyrus.  I was willing to give it a shot (even though I can't stand Miley) because of my love 4 the Notebook, but again it totally sucked and I wished for my 1hr & 1/2 back of my life.  The ""person"" who did the Notebook needs to stop advertising that on all these other movies that totally blow.  It's like stick with the good stuff and when you run out of ideas just call it quits and hang up your boots (like Seinfeld) don't keep producing lack-luster crap that disappoints your one-time audience.  And that is my rant :P"
