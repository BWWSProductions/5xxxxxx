 Martha, an emotionally fragile mother, who moves to a   
 remote Irish village with her husband Tomas following   
 the tragic death of their baby daughter. Whilst there,  
 the couple decide to take in a disturbed and orphaned   
 autistic girl called Daisy. Uncommunicative and greatly 
 scarred by the violent death of her parents, Daisy      
 gradually warms to her new surroundings. But, as a      
 series of strange occurrences begin to be linked to the 
 little girl, Martha and Tomas begin to hear rumors from 
 the locals that Daisy might be something far more       
 malevolent than she seems.

      R E L E A S E  N O T E S       
  
  
                                                               
  Ok, so here's the deal. GFW really fucked this shit up. I    
  mean badly. Do they check their shit before they pre it?     
                                                               
  As you can see in the included samples, their release has    
  obvious ivtc issues. You wouldn't know this by checking      
  their sample because they were so God damned lazy, they cut  
  it from the beginning where it was a dark fucking intro at   
  the very start of the movie that had zero movement. Way to   
  go. So I had to use MY time/credits to download their piece  
  of shit release and cut a sample that they should have       
  included in the first place.                                 
                                                               
  Also, their nfo shows that there were subs with the movie.   
  ORLY?! Everywhere I checked I could not for the life of me   
  find a sub dir. So I was kind enough to include them with    
  our release.                                                 
                                                               
  I don't mind a group getting a release out before us,        
  that's fine. That's how the scene is sometimes. But fuck     
  man, atleast have some pride and do it right. Fixing         
  someone else's bullshit mistakes pisses me off more than     
  actually losing a title.                                     
                                                               
  Anyways... Enjoy yet another great VH-PROD release!
