         After having their power turned off because they couldn't     
         pay their electric bill on time, Frankie and Mike decide      
         to cut unnecessary expenses - starting with their cable       
         TV. But while the kids adapt to the change by doing other     
         activities, Frankie and Mike find themselves not knowing      
         how to fill the time they used to spend in front of the       
         tube. Meanwhile, Brick and his fellow socially challenged     
         friends are dealt a major blow when the school library is     
         closed during recess and they're forced into the outside      
          world onto the playground with the other students.
