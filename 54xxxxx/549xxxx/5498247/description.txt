Please help to seed this torrent when you are completed as my ISP has a monthly limit that I always max out on since I have over 50 torrents that I seed for you all. My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)



This is a wonderful documentary of the Afro-Cuban All-Stars - the famous Cuban musicians that would a few years later be featured in Ry Cooder's 'The Buena Vista Social Club'. The first half is a documentary featuring interviews and commentary with the members of the band, as well as a performance at Havana's Salon of Dreams.

The second half of the video is a wonderful concert that Compay Segundo performed at the legendary Olympia in Paris, France, featuring fellow Buena Vista compatriots Omara Portuondo and Benito Suarez.

This is in English and Spanish with English and French subtitles.
