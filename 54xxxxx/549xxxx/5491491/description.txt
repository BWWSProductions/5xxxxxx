Food, Inc. is a 2008 American documentary film directed
by Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Robert Kenner.The film
examines large-scale agricultural food production in the
United States, concluding that the meat and vegetables
produced by this type of economic enterprise leads to
inexpensive but unhealthy and environmentally harmful
food. The film is narrated by Michael Pollan and Eric

production of food. The documentary generated extensive
