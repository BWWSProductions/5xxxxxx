Sarah Cain and Thomas Corriher from The Health Wyze Report (HealthWyze.org) were guests on 'Buckshot's Survival Hour' on March 24th, 2010 to discuss emergency alternative medicine. The show is partnered with the Liberty Tree Radio and Militia Radio networks. It is popular amongst 9/11 truthers and the Internet's alternative media. It is also retransmitted by thousands of radio microtransmitters across the United States. The show is hosted by Bruce Hemming ("Buckshot"), and Marcus Jones ("Captain Gringo"). It was a great show and we recommend listening to it.
