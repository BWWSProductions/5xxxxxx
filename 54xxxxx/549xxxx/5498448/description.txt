Blood Bowl is a Fantasy Football game created by Jervis Johnson for the British games company Games Workshop as a parody of American Football.  Blood Bowl is set in a fantasy universe similar to, but not the same as, Warhammer Fantasy, populated by traditional fantasy elements such as human warriors, goblins, dwarfs, elves, orcs and trolls.

This mini-series features the legendary Bad Bay Hackers in a grudge match against the ever-evil Orcland Raders! Join the Hackers as they begin their brutal march to their next championship game, filled with spiked balls, corrupt refs, and giant-sized barrels of Bugman's XXXXXX!
