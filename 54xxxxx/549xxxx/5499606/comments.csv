,W_Irizarry,2011-02-07T18:53Z,Ok scratch that.  Windows Media Player is causing it to come out of sync if you sift through the movie.  Watching it with Divx Player had no problems.

,G3n3tiX,2011-07-15T01:37Z,Somethings wrong with the audio. Voice only comes out of one ear. Every other movie works fine. I had to pull my 3.5m out a little to get voice in both ears.

So this film doesn't have 6 channel audio, i'd say it's more like 1 channel."
