           A fairy tale character who is about to flunk out of fairy      
           tale school, Jack must perform a heroic deed by Monday or      
           fail miserably, just like his father before him. Anxious       
           to make good, Jack sells his C.O.W. (Computer of Wonder)       
           for a handful of magic beans and a mysterious book that        
           records his adventures as he's having them. Accompanied        
           by his sidekick Grayson -- a goose who ate a bean and          
           underwent an amazing transformation -- Jack climbs the         
           magic beanstalk to recover the fabled Harp of Destiny          
           from the evil Giant who lives in the sky. Helping Jack on      
           his perilous quest is the spunky Jillian, a fearless           
           young girl whom Jack meets on his journey -- and who just      
           may have a hidden agenda...
