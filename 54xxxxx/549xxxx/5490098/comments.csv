,Damonte,2010-04-11T06:48Z,1920*794 = 1080p? Since when?
,psychoacer,2010-04-11T08:37Z,Since black bars were deleted. When you add black bars you will get 1080. This is a very wide aspect ratio movie so no matter what screen you have it will never fill up the entire screen. You will always have black bars no matter what. To save space on the disc they just descided to not even include them all together in order to save bytes that would of been wasted on rendering black. So the extra resolution your missing is black bars. Do you really want them to be encoded into the movie?
