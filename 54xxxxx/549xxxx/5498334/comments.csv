You info is very poor, but it sounds like you need to run the patch while your computer is on ...... "
,tnas11,2010-04-17T14:44Z,Exactly .. the patch stops the 30 day countdown.. so its gonna keep saying 'your trial period will expire in 30 days' always! :D
,tnas11,2010-04-17T14:45Z,"btw, u can update the engine and virus definitions.. but do NOT update the program :D"
,javabest,2010-04-17T16:50Z,"@Shitdog1
just run uninstall and run the setup again
and choose trial license
enjoy"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-19T06:55Z,"Recently, when trying to update avast, the license was expired. Here's what fixed the problem:  

1. Drag the license file out of (you may need to disable avast! self-defense module first):
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users.WINDOWS\Application Data\Alwil Software\Avast5\license

2. Run the patch again, and reboot the computer.

3. Run avast, and insert the license.


Remember: Update ONLY the engine and virus definitions.Do NOT update the program updates. 
To disable Update Program: At avast Settings-> Updates-> PROGRAM: Select ""Manual update""."

[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-20T19:13Z,"@UsamaBinLaden 

You're welcome, and enjoy TPB and my torrents. :)"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-21T18:35Z,The problem with the license being expired probably was caused by some of my reg cleaners. Since it's been fixed it's working ok again. 
,neilzzz01,2010-04-22T14:02Z,"RobbingHood pls upload the ""Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate v6""....

,WId0W,2010-04-29T08:07Z,"To be fair, I've gotta give it to you Robbing Hood. You're a bit of a legend, all your uploads are really well thought out, stable and clean, not to mention all very handy programs and lots of them! If there's ever any problems with them you seem to know about it and appear with a work around or a fix pretty quickly, allot of people don't do that. You seem to be someone who takes this hacking game seriously, hats off to you my good man.

By the way, dig the name. I'm from Nottingham as it happens and Robbin Hood has always been a big influence on me ;)"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-29T18:54Z,"@WId0W

Thnx m8. Here's a secret: Honestly I'm not the real Robin Hood (but don't tell), so hopefully you won't be disappointed. :D "
,foeyrules,2010-05-03T17:15Z,"I installed and patched now I go to activate the trial period it gives me error message:The trial period could not be activated.
Please make sure you are connected to the Internet and
your proxy settings are correct."
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-05T21:19Z,"@foeyrules

So did you make sure you're connected to the Internet and that your proxy settings are correct? "
,43wg3hyw435yh,2010-05-07T02:11Z,"@RH avast! 5.0.545 Final *just* got released, hope a new patch for it will appear soon?"
,sojici,2010-05-09T16:40Z,i installed it as you said but it says that this is trial period and that licence will expire in 30 days
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-10T00:16Z,"@43wg3hyw435yh 

And till 2015 it will keep saying that the tirlal licence will expire in 30 days. So what's the problem? Never mind, you're number xxxx who doesn't know how to read or understand the install notes.

Gosh, who's next??? "
,43wg3hyw435yh,2010-05-10T16:00Z,"@RH Wow wow, relax dude. What's with the attitude? My .507 version is working fine with the patch, I was just wondering if you're going to patch the latest version as well. A simple 'no' would've sufficed"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-05-10T22:26Z,"@43wg3hyw435yh

Sorry m8, but my reply was meant for ""sojici"". You may have noticed that people keep asking stupid questions about the patch, while at the torrent description and incl. Readme.txt file clearly is stated:

""Avast_5.0.507-Patch_v1 stops the countdown of the avast 30 days trial license 
so that the trial license never expires."".

Cheerz :)"
,43wg3hyw435yh,2010-05-10T22:50Z,"@RH Fair enough, though the '@43wg3hyw435yh' kind of made me think it was aimed at me but I understand now. Anywho, I still would like to know if you're going to patch the latest version (.545) as well =)"
,43wg3hyw435yh,2010-05-11T15:06Z,"@RH You are the best, thanks :D"
,sojici,2010-05-11T18:00Z,ok thanks :)
,amk9468,2010-05-21T08:49Z,"I'm assuming this wont work for the newest version, 5.0.545? or will it?"
