"The Death of the Queen Bee"

The team's latest case takes Brennan back to her alma 
mater, Burtonsville High School, where she and Booth 
investigate the discovery of an unidentified skull 
and upper torso. With Angela's help, they identify 
the victim as one of Brennan's classmates, and notice 
a possible connection to a second murder committed 15 
years prior. Brennan and Booth go undercover as a 
married couple at her class reunion to interrogate a 
set of suspects, where even as an adult, Brennan is 
still predictably misunderstood and her only friend 
lies in a strangely dark and offbeat janitor (guest 
star Englund). Meanwhile, Hodgins spills a lab 
secret.

Enjoy :)
