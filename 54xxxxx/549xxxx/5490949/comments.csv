,cuteselene,2010-04-11T17:13Z,isn't is going to overwrite my progress??
,just.dont,2010-04-11T17:35Z,"@cuteselene:
Not if you read the instructions (and understand them). And noone forbids to make a backup."
,versamaz,2010-04-11T17:41Z,"Please let me know if you guys finish the Templar Lairs,, i've finished the Villa Assassin Crypt (Auditore),, but I couldn't finish the Templar Lairs, I guess something's wrong with the installer of my ac2, i had an error with the installation..."
,fsxman,2010-04-11T22:33Z,Where can I find the saves?
,forb1dden,2010-04-12T00:57Z,By Default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\storage\SomeLetter-Numbers\4 (this is your saves folder) ..   x86 if you have OS 64bit ^^)   Remember to disable online saving. I think that's all
,raviraj87,2010-04-12T10:19Z,"See DLC is great but I couldn't finish Templar Lair as is it meant only for Assassin's Creed II : Black Edition. I can'y exit from the location.
Any suggestions????"
,versamaz,2010-04-12T12:36Z,"@raviraj87

Yeah that happened to me as well, here's what you do... Try quiting, it'll promt you to the main menu, load your game again,,, now the templar mission will start from the beginning, it'll even ask you to accept or decline the mission, just decline it. Then you'll be back. What's great with this dlc is that you can wear Altair's original outfit, check your outfit in the inventory."
,raviraj87,2010-04-13T02:07Z,"@versamaz 

Ya its great And I know that already... Thanx for your info, I just want to finish that part of the game  but this is my request that can any one of you guys upload the ""Black Edition"" or the ""Deluxe"" edition for PC if you have it.


Thanx"
,jorjetkong,2010-04-13T13:53Z,"is there any way to somehow repair that ""not exiting"" problem"
,Gigakos,2010-04-13T13:56Z,it just replaces my saves when i overwrite your files in the save path. I tried creating them as a file with number (2) in its name but nothing new appeared. What should i do ?
,jorjetkong,2010-04-13T16:21Z,"i ment the problem with the ""not working"" templar lairs. sorry!"
,amstelr,2010-04-13T21:49Z,"I've done everything but the dlc wont appear.
I'm in the beginning of the game that cloud be the problem pls help me."
,jorjetkong,2010-04-14T12:59Z,"@ amstelr
the templar lairs for example become active at a certain point of the game! when you reach the exact year they will appear ;)"
,amstelr,2010-04-14T15:08Z,what about the weapon and altairs robe ?
,carnage3344,2010-04-14T18:55Z,Can anyone fix the templar lairs please. I've done 1 of them but dont know how so can you guys help?
,Gigakos,2010-04-14T18:57Z,What the ..? I was doing the Mission in which the templars are trying to kill the medici and the boom crash when i was at the 3rd floor. Whats going on ?
,jorjetkong,2010-04-15T00:16Z,only the lairs don't work and they look like they have already been done cause none of the things you have to interact work and they all act like they have already been used and also doors are opened but they shouldnt be cause you've got to open them
,weezy69,2010-04-16T09:57Z,"works great, thank you."
,jorjetkong,2010-04-16T11:41Z,"@weezy69
i strongly doubt you manage to finish the templar lairs"
,weezy69,2010-04-17T04:56Z,well i did 2 of them but since you said that imma go try to do the 3rd one now
,weezy69,2010-04-17T07:27Z,"yea like i thought, i just finished the 3rd one, I dono, make sure u guys got the latest values, its 1908 i believe"
,amstelr,2010-04-18T15:19Z,"I've completed the without a bug
I'am using latest values"
,amstelr,2010-04-18T15:20Z,every dlc
,RanY2jith,2010-04-25T14:14Z,My respects brother { altair tone } 
,arciusazrael,2010-05-07T20:28Z,Is this for people who use offline server only? cuz Im playing AC2 using crack from skidrow and im not sure if its gonna work. Can someone answer me please? :)
,arciusazrael,2010-05-09T13:45Z,"nvm, the crack unlocks all the DLCs"
,pixie1966,2010-05-24T10:13Z,"Yup, worked beautifully with SKIDROW's game and crack torrent. Also, the instructions given tell you to overwrite save file 1 or 2 when it's easier to just rename the files after the 3rd save spot. You don't risk losing a saved game, and in my case it was necessary, since I have two saved games already"
,dont_ask,2010-05-29T20:59Z,I had the same problem with the templar lairs u dnt hav to hav the black edition u just need the latest values.db file
,storm919,2010-06-17T19:53Z,"i have the white edition of assassin's creed 2 , what more will i put in the game with this dlc? (i dont know if i should download this or if i have them )"
,Ratspike,2010-06-23T12:38Z,does this include Battle of Forli?
,kriss3d,2010-06-30T13:09Z,"Ive installed this and it seems to work. I completed 3 templar caves and the family tomb.
Though now i have no idea what to do. Isnt there supposed to be some ending or somthing ? I already finished the game before installing this DLC so im not sure what else there is to do."
,xiIix,2010-08-02T01:28Z,"This is fucking ridiculous. I had the DLC's unlocked the entire time. Basically, this is the rule of thumb, if you got the Assassins Creed rip that didn't require a complicated install with a server emulator, you have the DLC's activated. I had no idea of this, so I'm sitting here trying to figure out if the extra content is unlocked, so I did a search on the net to see what the DLC includes, and it's talking about Ezio waking up with a beard, realizing that a priest got his hands on the Apple, and realized I already did that.

Facepalm."
,gerald78nl,2010-10-07T03:21Z,"@pixie1966 OR ANYONE helpful enough, how can tese DLC be used with a AC2 cracked by Skidrow becaue I can't find a values.db to replace?"
,pixie4000,2010-11-04T22:36Z,"@gerald78nl Prolly a bit useless now coming a month late, but you can just ignore the whole values thing if you're using SKIDROW's crack. Or you should at least."

,pixie4000,2010-11-13T17:39Z,Sorry for the double post. It was bugging out on me.
,AssassinsDecree,2010-11-28T05:41Z,"Okay guys I'm confused as shit. I extract it to the save folder, and nothing shows up. Can someone explain it step by step?"
,elturbo9077,2010-12-22T04:09Z,does not work people becuase the save game gotta be cracked also in other words i u want to transfer a save to another pc u canot becuase it has to be cracked
,Brode33,2011-03-07T11:41Z,"Hello
I would like it what it is necessary to ask with this punctually how the two regrets to make because if I copy it onto the place of the rescues then there is nothing if I rename all two 1.save ,1.save.metadata my first rescue disappears now then what there is then it is necessary to copy it and wears out it is necessary to start the game ?"
,sunetesimuzici,2011-04-06T18:53Z,the crypt works excellent with my skidrow rip. When I reach templar lairs I will report. Thank you uploader!
,sunetesimuzici,2011-05-12T18:44Z,all 3 templar lairs worked excelent. Thank you.
,fox12345,2011-07-17T14:04Z,"Things that should be cleared up. DLCs ""The Battle of ForlĂÂŹ"" and ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" comes with every PC version of Assassin's Creed 2. Also, you dont have to download any values or emulators to get this DLC to work.

1) Install the game (the version does NOT matter).
2) Apply the latest patch (optional but recommended).
3) Apply the Skidrow crack
4) Open ""AC2 DLC Enable"" rar and extract the files ""2.save"" and ""2.save.metadata"" to the save folder location (it should be a folder name ""4"" that should be somewhere in C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\storage)
5) If you already have a save game. DONT overwrite the 2.save file (it'll delete your saved game). Instead, change that file's name to 3 or 4 and then put in the save location.
6) The Three Templar Lairs should be marked on your map during some point in the game (wont be there in the beginning of a new game)."

,chinz1337,2011-08-21T22:36Z,"Yeah, Skidrow version has those 2 other DLC's, I don't remember seeing Templar Lairs in last time when I finished the game.

I installed Skidrow version of this game by following their instructions, started slot 1 save and got to sequence 4, then I downloaded this and copied files to my save folder (ignoring instructions about latest values and offline server) and after sequence 5 started there was first Templar Lair in my map."
,jkbulan,2011-12-21T13:48Z,yes is works
,Philippine1,2012-03-17T12:22Z,"how can i get altair's outfit?

,ahmedez,2012-03-23T20:48Z,"Ok so I also had problems doing this kinda sh!t but ill tell u some instructions IF you have skidrow

so backup ur files!! (you find them in programfiles/ubisoft/ubisoft game launcher/storage/skidrow/4)
1. Copy the files in the extracted folder, place them into were ur saves r 
2. Check if ur save is deleted(ingame) or not(then you can enter ur save file and enjoy all the dlc's!!!), if it is. delete newly added files and replace with original save files. 
3. (if your save file was deleted ingame) copy the 2.save.metadata into were ur saves r and rename the 2.save (from the dlc enable file) to 1.save and drag to were ur save files r and HAVE FUN!!!!(ull have to replace tho)
