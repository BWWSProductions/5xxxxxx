,YNinja23,2011-09-22T22:42Z,"Found this for those who want to know the order of reading:


Although the novels were reprinted in chronological order it is recommended to read The Icewind Dale Trilogy before The Darkelf Trilogy. If you read them in the order they were originally published you see the characters evolve. Some small errors were also corrected.
