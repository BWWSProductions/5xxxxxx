,QuietGeek,2010-04-17T07:26Z,"This series, when aired in WS HDTV (AR 16:9 or 1.78), like on the Cartoon network, is actually a cropped version of the original ""anamorphic"" AR of 2.35 (as seen on SkyHD). If you'd like to see all 22 episodes of Season 1 at near 720p (1280x544) beautifully ripped from Bluray, in the original 2.35 AR, then visit this page (UJ dld links listed and comparative Bluray/HDTV screen grabs shown and commented):

Watching the Bluray rips after the HDTV is like seeing the episodes for the first time. A real eye-opener, worth every bit of bandwidth."
