Have you ''unpacked'' those .rar files that you got after finishing download?
If you did than you must have got yourself an .iso file.
Just burn that .iso file at slow speed, like 4X.
There's also a chance that this torrent is not live any more so you should look out for a new one, since this game is kind of old theese days."
