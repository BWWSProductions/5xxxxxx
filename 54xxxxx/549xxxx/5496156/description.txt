Gnamien Ato, an occasional pig man who also works as a welder, is the odd-job man in the village of Bali Ahuekro which has a population of three thousand. One day, alone in the forest Gnamien Ato experiences "hypnotic convulsions". In a vision he sees a child and hears a heavenly voice telling him what his mission in life is. Taking this dream for reality the pig man goes to the village square one morning to preach his new faith, he performs several "miracles" thus gaining the trust of the villagers. Amazed and convinced of the coming of a "messiah", the inhabitants of Balo Ahuekro all join the new faith.
Now named Magloire 1st, the former pig man embarks on his mission as a "Liberator" appointed by God...
Magloire 1st, who also claims to be the son of Christ, acquires great fame. From all over the country people come to see him: would-be politicians, shopkeepers who want to make more money, sterile women, paralytics, blind people and poor people.
