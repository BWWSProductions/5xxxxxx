Billie Holiday - The Complete Storyville Club Sessions (1951-53)

Mp3 320 kbps




Though born in Baltimore, Billie Holiday had strong ties to Massachusetts throughout her career. Her final performance, in fact, took place in Lowell, cradle of the industrial revolution. Long before that tragic set, however, Holiday recorded a series of shows at George Weinâ€™s legendary Boston club Storyville. 



Though separated by two years from 1951-53, these discreet recordings capture "Lady Day" in prime emotive voice. From the first of Carl Drunkardâ€™s watery piano drops which open "I Cover The Waterfront" to Sten Getzâ€™s peppy sax supports in the abbreviated closer "Youâ€™re Driving Me Crazy," Holiday evokes a wide palette of feels and feelings. 



"Ainâ€™t Nobodyâ€™s Business If I Do" depicts an eerily realistic abusive relationship with disturbingly defiant laissez faire. Gershwinâ€™s true classic "I Love You, Porgy," on the other hand, places Holiday in the position of a lover afraid of losing the one man who treats her right.



Along the way, Holiday also cries, creaks and slurs her way through such signatures as "I Only Have Eyes For You," Johnny Mercerâ€™s "Too Marvelous For Words" and her self-penned "Billieâ€™s Blues." Despite 24-bit remastering, the recordings retain the production value of their original platters. Even so, the CD is a historic record.
