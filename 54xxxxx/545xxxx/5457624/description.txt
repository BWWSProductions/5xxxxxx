Giovanni Maciocia, "The Practice of Chinese Medicine: The Treatment of Diseases with Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs"
Churchill Livingstone | 2007 | ISBN: 0443074909 | 1546 pages | PDF 

The new edition of this popular clinical text describes the application of traditional Chinese medical theory to the diagnosis and treatment of up to 48 diseases, conditions and disorders. In addition to the existing 34 covered in the first edition, 14 new conditions and symptoms have been added, and these include common, chronic and acute conditions which clinicians may see in their practice. Each chapter contains aetiology and pathology; differential diagnosis according to TCM; selection of treatments with acupuncture and herbs, with explanation of choices; case studies for illustration; summary of Western differential diagnosis; and discussion of prognosis and prevention. This book again brings the enormous wealth of the author's experience, and his insights in applying TCM medicine to a Western context, to the support of all clinicians whatever their own range of experiences.
