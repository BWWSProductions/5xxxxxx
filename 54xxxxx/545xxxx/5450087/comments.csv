Part one was my first upload ever, now I got the hang of it so expect part 2,3,4..ect to be posted by 11:00 PM EST every Sunday night . the only reason it would not be up is if my recording screwed up so I would have to wait till midnight or monday. Enjoy them as they come, and please seed :)"

,kingscorner1,2010-04-06T23:50Z,Thanks. Excellent quality both video and audio.
,kingscorner1,2010-04-06T23:58Z,"For some reason it will not play on DVD. My palyer plays DivX but does not recognise file. Plays fine on PC.
It can be changed to DVDVideo with DVD Santa"
,kingscorner1,2010-04-07T00:01Z,"This does not play on DVD player, even if the player reads Divx. It plays on PC perfectly.
The only way to watch through DVD player is to convert it to DVDVideo using DVD Santa."
