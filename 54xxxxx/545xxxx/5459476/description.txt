From hit movies about car racing to Wrestlemania to nationwide 

television broadcasts of college basketball, one particular band has 

been tapped to provide aggressive, kick-ass rock 'n' roll to jack up 

the pulse of the masses--Saliva. Now, six albums and a dozen years 

after the Memphis-born group debuted on record, Saliva issues its 

first retrospective, "Moving Forward In Reverse: Greatest Hits." 

Featuring 13 of Saliva's best-known tracks and a new track, "Time To 

Shine," only available on this release, "Moving Forward In Reverse: 

Greatest Hits" is brash and brazen, fast and furious.
