This is Volume 2 Which has season 3 of Family Guy. 

The iso file has 3 folders each being one of the discs ready to burn. There were no previews like the first volume I put up the only thing I did was to compress them to fit onto dvd5 discs.

Disc 1 is episodes 1-8

Disc 2 is episodes 9-16

Disc 3 is episodes 17-21 and the special features.

(NTSC)

Please seed cause when my ratio reaches 1.5 to 2 I will stop seeding and upload volume 3

I seed 24/7 till this is done other then when I have to take the computer to work a few times a week for two to 6 hours at a time.


Enjoy.
