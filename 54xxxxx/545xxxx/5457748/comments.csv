as seen in the link steam.api.dll is noted as a virus so if you have avg (like me) you need to turn off your virusscanner "

,sdnl1j2,2010-03-26T02:07Z,NUKED!!   get SKIDROW proper crack!
,M0usAKa,2010-03-26T21:22Z,"@Bixel2:

You are the motherfucker, you son of a bitch! You think that cracking is done by one click on a ""CrackIt!"" button? Cracking is really hard, you have to learn a lot! Years!! And every application can't be cracked on the same way! It takes long time! And SKIDROW, RELOADED, RAZOR1911 and all the others do it for FREE!!!! And thes spend much, much hours on it! RESPECT THEM!
Are you working for free too, fucker???
If you can't fucking wait, just buy the game, or shut up and stay down on your ass!! You fucking n00b..."
,Kak_Ballin,2010-03-27T02:46Z,"I agree with you M0usAKa, good words!!!!"

Can anyone help me with this issue.... "
,cpktnwt,2010-03-27T22:36Z,"Ice02: 
I had the same problem once, I think it was because the resolution was too high. Try lowering it in options!"

,BillTheGreek_HAF,2010-04-02T11:48Z,I need the serial code
,ramoks,2010-04-13T07:49Z,What is the CD key of this games?
,inuyasha5891,2010-04-13T18:34Z,"OKAY FELLAS I'VE FIGURED IT OUT!!!!! HOW TO GET THE GAME RUNNING.

THIS IS WHAT I DID.

I mounted the ISO and ran the ""Autorun.exe"" on the ISO and went through the setup, which installed Steam etc. I did not make any account with Steam etc or Entered any Serial Code I copied the contents of the CRACK folder (JustCause2.exe, language TXT, and Steam_api.dll) to the Steam directory located in Program Files. I TRIED TO RUN THE GAME BY RUNNING THE JUSTCAUSE2.EXE, BUT THAT DID NOT WORK. I READ SOME OF THE COMMENTS ON HERE AND FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN STEAMBACKUP.EXE on the ISO. 

I ran Steambackup.exe on the ISO and i t prompts you to choose a folder. Choose an Independent folder of the Steam Installation folder found in Program Files. Create a new folder on your desktop and choose that folder. Steambackup.exe will run and start unpackaging some files. It'll take some time so go do something else in the mean time. I called my girlfriend over and we fucked for about 2 to 3 hours. :-D LOL. By the time we were done with that it had already finished unpacking. THERE WAS AN ERROR MESSAGE, but I ignored it and the game was unpacked into the new folder I made. I went back to the crack folder on the ISO and copied the contents of the Crack folder to the new installation folder then ran the game. THE GAME TAKES A WHILE TO LOAD. I don't know why, I suppose it has to with me running the game on Windows Se7en.

Anyways good luck and I hope this helps.

Still need help getting AC2 to run, getting past the White Screen. Anyone?"
,ryandude,2010-04-19T19:21Z,"To fix the save failed message, just run as admin :)"

You are a fucking genius.
It was your help that finally got this one up for me. Thank you.

This one was a toughy. There are no instructions.

I'm on Windows 7 and kept getting errors during install.

People!
If you have disabled auto updates then you have also disabled Windows Installer. Go to services and put it back on automatic."
,danconia3873,2010-05-01T03:44Z,"Anyone else having issues trying to copy and paste the crack over the original files?  2 of the 3 files past fine but the steam_api.dll file says I don't have permission to replace the original.

And I'm logged in as administrator... why is this happening?"
,DarthChipmonk,2010-05-07T04:12Z,"fuck you razor1911 your ""cracks"" dont work for shit, and fuck you too RELOADED, you even shittier than razor. pieces of shit"
,bLoWsMokE,2010-05-08T02:18Z,In order to save the game you have to open the app as administer... I dopn't know about you guys but I just uninstalled my skidrow copy becau8se it creates steam executables in the game directory and mc affee says that the JustCause2.exe is a trojan right in the iso iteself
