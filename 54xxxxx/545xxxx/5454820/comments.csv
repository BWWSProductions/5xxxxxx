[V],twentyforty,2010-03-22T20:45Z,"As usual, I watched couple of hours ago ""old"" one, and... I admit, I was bothered with those ""glitches"". There is at least dozen of them...

Maybe two hours after, PROPER has been released and this time, a Dimension done it with a reason, no doubt about. I am not sensitive for such ""glitches"" nor crazy about PROPERs. But - somehow I felt that my re-encoded PROPER should follow Group's Proper. This time.
I usually avoid Propers which are mainly some sorting-out between Groups with laughable reasons - ""Group XXXX release has over-cropped picture by 2 pixels on top and 1 pixel on right side""... LOL"
