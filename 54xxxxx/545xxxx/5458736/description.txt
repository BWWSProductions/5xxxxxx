The Early Tapes of The Beatles is the first digital repackaging of the 1962 German album by Tony Sheridan and The Beat Brothers (a.k.a. The Beatles) called My Bonnie. The original repackage was first issued in Germany in 1964 and titled The Beatles' First. It was recorded at Hamburg in 1961. This repackage was released in 1984. Most of the tracks feature vocals by Sheridan. Only tracks 1-5, 7, 10, and 11 actually feature the Beatles; the other songs are performed by Sheridan and other musicians. This album was reissued with a different design in 2004 on Universal Music's Spectrum label. (Wiki)
