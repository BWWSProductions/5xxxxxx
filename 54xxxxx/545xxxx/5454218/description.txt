*  RELEASE NOTES  *

MATLAB  is  a high-level language and
interactive  environment  that enables
you     to     perform computationally
intensive   tasks   faster   than with
traditional programming languages such
as C, C++, and Fortran.

Release 2010a includes new features in
MATLAB  and Simulink, one new product,
and  updates and bug fixes to 85 other
products..

New    capabilities   for   the MATLAB
product family include:
* Additional multithreaded math functions
and enhancements to file sharing, path
management, and the desktop in MATLAB
* New System objects for stream processing
in MATLAB, with over 140 supported
algorithms in Video and Image Processing
Blockset and Signal Processing Blockset
* Multicore support and performance
enhancements for over 50 functions and
expanded support for large images in Image
Processing Toolbox
* New nonlinear solvers in Global
Optimization Toolbox and Optimization
Toolbox
* Ability to generate Simscape language
equations from Symbolic Math Toolbox
* Stochastic approximation
expectation-maximization (SAEM) and
pharmacokinetic dosing schedules support
in SimBiology

New   capabilities   for  the Simulink
product family include:
* Tunable parameter structures, triggered
model blocks, and function call branching
for large-scale modeling in Simulink
* Code generation support for Eclipse,
Embedded Linux, and ARM processors in
Embedded IDE Link and Target Support
Package
* ISO 26262 certification for Real-Time
Workshop Embedded Coder and PolySpace
products in IEC Certification Kit
* DO-178B qualification support extended to
model coverage in DO Qualification Kit
* Simulink PLC Coder, a new product for
generating IEC 61131 structured text for
PLCs and PACs

This DVD covers the following OS linux
32/64,  macosx intel 32/64 and solaris
sparc64
