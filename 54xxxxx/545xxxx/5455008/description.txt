I RE-UPLOADED THIS TORRENT BECAUSE SOMEONE DIDN'T LIKE THE ONE RAR FILE I UPLOADED PREVIOUSLY.
Mono, 32 kbps, excellent quality! Ripped from CDs, one track per chapter.

Why I didn't upload Jim Dale's version?
Because he reads like a computer, he doesn't put heart into the characters. Yes, he may have created 176 different voices, but his voices are all raspy. He does use them, but he doesn't act, while Stephen Fry, who created less voices, reads ten times better: when a character screams, he will scream too, for example. 
If you think I'm right, please post a comment. If you think I'm wrong, please post a comment xD . When anyone wants me to upload Jim Dale's version, just ask and I'll do it!
Please seed and enjoy!
