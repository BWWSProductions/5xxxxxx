My Aim Is To Upload Quality Music Torrents And Keep Them Active
But The Better The Seeding Then The More I Will Upload.
All My Music Will Be Uploaded At 320Kbps Bitrate Mp3 Format.

Cheers


Just One Small Note: The Album Details Shown In Windows Media Player Are All Correct ie; Song Name,Track Number,Contibuting Artist etc.But The Album Details
Say "Singles[Bonus]Disc1".This Is Not A Bonus Disc Or Part Of A Set. I Tried Correcting This In The Advanced Tag Menu And It Just Jumbled All The Tracks up.So As It Didn't Matter To Me,I Just Left It.
