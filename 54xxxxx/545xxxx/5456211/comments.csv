,codepoet,2011-01-15T17:46Z,">> To anyone that's had problems from the game crashing, during intro or upon starting a game. 

There seems to be issues with nVidia PhysX system. This worked for me: Uninstalling PhysX, remove left-over traces of PhysX in your registry. 

Let Metro 2033 install PhysX. And you should be good to go. Plays fine for me, installing Second update Now. Will post how it goes."

Update 1 works fine after doing the methods above. Also gives you english titles and subtitles. Nice game, thanks for the upload!"
