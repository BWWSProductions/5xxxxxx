    Test your reflexes by punching Twittering Birds!                      
                                                                          
    Imagine you are enjoying a nice sunny day in the beautiful            
    countryside. You lie down under the tree ready to take a quick        
    nap... Suddenly there are disturbing noises from above!               
                                                                          
    What?!? Those little birdies are twittering like mad. If you          
    could only punch them so they stay quiet...                           
                                                                          
    Now you can! New iPhone game Bird Reflex lets you test your           
    reflexes by punching those crazy twittering birds...                  
                                                                          
    See how fast your reactions are in two game modes: In Reflex Mode     
    there will be 10 birds randomly falling from the tree. Your goal      
    is to punch the bird as soon as she leaves the tree but not too       
    early and not too late, because there will be penalties.              
    In Time Mode you have to keep little worm alive as long as you        
    can. Every birdie you don't punch will bite the worm a little.        
    If you're really really fast you'll gain various game                 
    achievements.
