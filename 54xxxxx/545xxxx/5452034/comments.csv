,taxcut,2010-03-28T05:05Z,Did you have to pack it three times?
,Zerojohnnyx,2010-04-13T21:46Z,How do you get this to work exactly?
,Zerojohnnyx,2010-04-13T22:53Z,   I actually downloaded a similar program. I figure I should have done with this one what I did in the other I downloaded which was use the self installer rather than the setup icon.  
,kafug,2010-05-11T04:24Z,sorry i really suck with zip files after i unzip it what do i doo next any help would be great
,mohanlal2000,2010-06-14T03:09Z,"Man, can't really figure out what to do next..any one succeeded?"
,dalwhin,2010-06-17T18:20Z,"scenebalance, 
Any reason you make the packaging sooooooo complex ?
This is a zipped winrared self-extracting-SFX.  Unless you want to hide some virus, I do not see any reason to use 3 steps...
For those who want to use it, unzip each zip file, which will give you a set of setup.rar files.  Unrar the setup.rar, which will give you a 'unpack-setup.exe' file, which, when executed will self-extract, resulting, finally in a setup.exe file."
,willynillyking,2010-06-18T17:57Z,"Thanks for the program, scenebalance.  

I got this to work with dalwhin's instructions.  Thank you, dalwhin."
,di3lectric,2010-08-21T20:16Z,this kinda sucks man... i mean wtf it doesnt work
,overtherainbow101,2010-10-08T03:36Z,"32 individually RAR'd files, with a RAR file inside each one, which all unrar to a self-extractor which then installs the program. Really? The program worked for me perfectly, just unpacking it was a royal pain."
,Evilbones76,2010-12-28T21:41Z,"I'm sorry - but WTF have you done here?  So many rar files.. I'm trying to unzip one of the setup files, and it asks me for the next volume, but wont let me choose anything.

This torrent is fking amateurish, scenbalance, you need to learn how to package..  !!!!!"
,Evilbones76,2010-12-28T21:54Z,"IS THIS A JOKE OR SOMETHING?  I cannot get this to work, wtf do I have to do?  Seriously, this is amateurish.. Never have I had to do this on any torrent..  ffs.."
