Aired 21.03.2010

Basilone - Basilone and the 7th Marines arrive on Guadalcanal 
	   to reinforce Leckie and the rest of the 1st Marine 
	   Division as they continue to defend the crucial 
	   airstrip. Basilone plays a key role in repelling a 
	   nighttime Japanese attack, but suffers a frightful 
	   personal loss. After four months of continuous 
	   action, the exhausted and disease-ridden members 
	   of the 1st Marine Division are evacuated off the 
	   island.

XIIMERSE video is undersized. Once you strip away their junk
padding they are only 1490.69mb, below the limit of 1491.
They have video glitches from start to finish. I gave up 
counting somehwere in the 20s.

Til Death had 2mb of junk, Simpsons only 1.1, and America
2 again, which leaves those within their particular size
allowed size range.

Enjoy :)
