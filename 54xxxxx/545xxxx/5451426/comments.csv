,dariian,2010-03-23T08:39Z,"Thx TPTB and Shroo.

I dowloading i make this steps for working.

1 - Disconnect from internet after install it.

2 - Go to SOFT folder and istall the Offlinepatch.
                 (do not run the game yet)

3 - Go to Data folder an run first ""CNC4SERVER"" let the window open..then run ""RunCNC4.eng"".

Thast it,cya"
,makerof,2010-03-23T11:18Z,"Did that but still doesnt work, so I wait for a crack"
[V],Shroo,2010-03-23T11:22Z,check your windows firewall settings make sure that C&C.exe and CNC4SERVER are allowed to connect.
,robbierlz,2010-03-23T12:17Z,"WTF are you knuckle heads talking about? fuck me ! i ran the setup.bat and it was sitting there and nothing happened for 30 mins , just a crappy animation was playing on the side ? how to install the game cause setup.bat doesnot work  fuckheads !"
,makerof,2010-03-23T12:29Z,Thnx Shroo but it doesn't work for me. I re- installed and cut internet when patching and tried to run game after that but the login part is still there. Anyone knows if registering at EA helps the problem out of this boring desert?
,makerof,2010-03-23T12:40Z,"robbierlz!

Hit esc. to cease the animation and install will start.
Plz tell if you get the game to work after that..."
,random-hero1986,2010-03-23T18:14Z,"hey guys i can confirm this works perfectly after running CNC4SERVER in the data folder then play via the RunCNC4.eng file in thesame directory, but id like to know if it is possible to run this game in ""windowed mode"" as i like to multi-task msn/gaming/surfing and dont like ALT-TABing. thanks in advance. "
,sidaster,2010-03-23T19:35Z,"Dude, the site is offline, so is the tracker of your site.

,robbierlz,2010-03-24T03:38Z,"@makerof: thanks dude , you ae a lifesaver mate! anyhu , played the game for a few missions and let me say its a let down from the original series . WTF ? where are the options of making a gazzilion units and ploughing them over NOD's defences ? i am dissapointed . Shroo and team TPTB , good job lads with the game , but a small suggestion , if you guys would have posted your review aout the game itself , i wouldnt have downloaded it . anyhu , keep up the good work , cheers . TO all C&C fans out there , download at your own peril , cause once you play this awful game you will say WTF happened , why did EA do this to us ? so sad . Corporate bastards , they ruin everything ! hope diablo will not sell off like C&C did . so fingers crossed . "
,kami2k,2010-03-24T06:04Z,"When game starts it says, internet connection is not available "
,pether,2010-03-24T12:35Z,Does this fix the problem of nothing being saved? Going back to level 2 and no achievements saved?
