The heavy dub sounds of The Big Bass Theory resonate with the deep bass & drums of a Jamaican thunder storm. This â€˜creation equationâ€™ is rooted in solid riddims with serious bass frequencies. The music uplifts the soul with positive sound. Repleate with soaring horns, steady bubble and skank, and stellar percussion, the music is dubbed-out with multiple delays, analogue effects and â€˜old-schoolâ€™ mixing techniques. The bass-lines are massive and the modern beats are original and moving, with a definite dancehall feel and reggae groove.
