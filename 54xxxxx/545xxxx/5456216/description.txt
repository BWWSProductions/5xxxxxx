    Simon Reeve continues his epic journey around the world    
    following the Tropic of Cancer, the northern border of    
    the tropics region.                                      
                                                              
    The second leg of the journey sees Simon dodge the         
    Moroccan secret police in Western Sahara, travel on one   
    of the world's longest trains in Mauritania, visit a     
    forgotten refugee camp in the Algerian desert where       
    more than 100,000 people live, and take a swim in a        
    Libyan oasis with a government minder who bears an        
    uncanny resemblance to Colonel Gaddafi.                  
                                                              
    After travelling around the Tropic of Capricorn and the    
    Equator, this series completes Simon's trilogy of         
    journeys exploring the amazing tropics region with his   
    toughest, longest, most ambitious challenge yet.
