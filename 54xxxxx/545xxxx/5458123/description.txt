From the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team (F.A.R.T.)
comes this excellent quality video with the original soundtrack restored!
As you probably know, DVD's of season two of The Fugitive were
released with a completely new, synthesized music score which
destroyed much of the show's drama.

Now, thanks to the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team, you can
enjoy the show in top quality as it was originally intended to be experienced.
