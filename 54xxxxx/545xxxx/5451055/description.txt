The Haunted Castle (also known as SchloÃŸ VogelÃ¶d and Vogelod Castle) is a silent chamber drama directed by F. W. Murnau in 1921.

The German The Haunted Castle (Schloss Vogelrod) has been described as director F.W. Murnau's "warm-up" for his subsequent Nosferatu. At this point in his career, Murnau was more interested in effects than in story or characterization, but those effects were among the best within the boundaries of Germany's "Caligari School." The cast included Paul Hartmann, Arnold Korff, Paul Bildt and Olga Tschenova. 

In the castle Vogeloed, a few aristocrats are awaiting baroness SafferstÃ¤tt. But first count Oetsch invites himself.. Everyone thinks he murdered his brother, baroness Safferstat's first husband, three years ago. So he is rather undesirable. But Oetsch stays; arguing he is not the murderer and will find the real one..
