"DISABLED" 

Detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Eliot Stabler 
(Chris Meloni) are called in to investigate when a disabled 
woman, Cara Benson (guest star Lisa Arrindell Anderson), is 
beaten and raped. Though the victim's condition has rendered 
her unable to speak, the detectives soon deduce that someone 
close to her is responsible, with the lead suspects being 
her resentful sister (guest star Jill Scott) and troubled 
nephew (guest star Quinton Aaron). As the investigation 
continues, Benson and Stabler strive to make Cara comfortable 
with coming forward to stand up for herself and illuminating 
some of the disturbing truths about the assisted living 
business.

XIIMERSE forgot to mention that their original BMS was 
incomplete and contained 110mb of junk data, again. Really,
just learn to encode and stop relying on a shitty one-click.

Enjoy :)
