,thadream101,2010-03-22T01:33Z,"sorry for the off subject but maybe someone can help....should I burn R5 rips onto dvd in PAL format or NTSC format for the best quality?
I am in the united states but i'm not sure it makes a difference....I usually do NTSC but was wondering if PAL might be better being their native format"
,swaltz,2010-03-22T02:44Z,"this looks awesome.  cheers!

thadream101 - my advice is buy a divx player and then you don't have to worry about conversion, but if you want to, i suggest NTSC.
PAL doesn't play on a lot of players due to region restricitons (in my experience), but some will play it fine."
,thadream101,2010-03-22T03:02Z,"well they play ok fine on my ps3 (little pixelated bcuz of my plasma, which i think also has something to do with the PAL) but i burn them for my grandparents and the NTSC doesn't always look good on their plasma but its cool i'll stick to your advice and what i'm doing thanks"
