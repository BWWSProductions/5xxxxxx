Solid songwriting that doesn't fall into the usual three-chord power pop/punk trappings and emotional lyrical output that manages to avoid seeming trite mark Sorry About Tomorrow as one to keep an eye and ear on. Tracks such as "Knees" offer dynamic moodiness unheard of in most of the band's peers, and even when they do get more traditional, it's led with such a great riff, like on "Radiation Suit," or overwhelming catchiness, as on "Now or Never," so as not to detract from enjoyment. Comparisons to Weezer  are a little unfounded this time out, however; Hot Rod Circuit may be geeks, but that doesn't make disc number three geek rock.
