,wayward12,2010-03-25T05:31Z,Amazing quality for this size dile keep up the great work!
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-25T06:09Z,"@ninapuss: Yes, one of yours..."
,ninapuss,2010-03-25T11:34Z,"Amazing quality? Hmmm... well, on a 44"" Bravia the quality is exactly what one would expect from 140Mb... shite.
Must look great on an iPod, for those tards who would even think of watching videos on a micro screen.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world waits for a decent xvid (PC, Mac, PS3, Xbox etc.)."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-25T16:36Z,LOL. You are stupid. No help in that. I am so sorry  about.
,lilars26,2010-03-25T18:23Z,"@ninapuss
I don't normally watch this show but I thought to be fair to you I should download it and watch it on my Bravia.I only have a 32"" but I found the quality very good.My only other choice would be to download a 1.09gig version.I would probably get better quality but the difference would not be worth the cost.
My point is that 20/40 is here to fill a gap,small file size with very good quality.If you can afford to always download large files then more power to you.But do not criticize what you don't understand.There are many people out here who
have limited bandwidth and would not get to watch their shows if not for him."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-25T22:04Z,"@lilars: Look, she have NOT downloaded this. If she has, she'll never wrote such rubbish.
I can give A9/V9 without any doubts and 'cause of that I am not bothering myself. 
I know my encodings and I do believe in things I'm doing last four years. 

I have done over 3700 H264 encodings and I get exactly what can be achievable. No other can, and wont, not in my pace nor space.

Lunatics MUST be laud because it is only way to be heard.

Our *pussy"" has spoken on only way known to their kind. 
Do not get engaged in discussions with insane people. You cannot prove them wrong, their mind is differently - formed.

Let say, she haven't on mind a/v quality, but pussy was angry about more profane things.

But, let that as a secret, not to be relieved."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-25T22:06Z,"relieved = revealed
LOL (oxymoron?)"
,pirateradiorocks,2010-03-26T06:25Z,"thanks, very much!"
