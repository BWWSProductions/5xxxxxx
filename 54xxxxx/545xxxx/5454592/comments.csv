""The Thirteenth Floor (1999).Magyar""  460 MB 
(Hungarian dub) if you don't want it."
,]eep,2010-03-24T15:17Z,"great movie btw, one that got snowed under in all the attention to the Matrix. The theme is similar.

Not as flashy but the story has more depth. Makes you think about what is real about our perception of the world around us since science does indicate that we live in a digital universe (hence quantum mechanics. Look up Planck-time, -lenght etc.)."
,pickled_egg,2010-03-25T01:58Z,"How can you list it as 1080p when its hight is only 800????

1080p is exactly 1920x1080 no more no less

All video that is released as 1080p is 1920x1080 on the original disc. So why do you have to lower it when you rip it???

I know that there are very few Programs that rip to MKV without lowering the resolution but you can always rip to AVI or MP4 & still keep up to 8 Audio streams & 12 sub pictures.

The resulting AVI's are usually at least 40% smaller files too & will play back on a lot more systems than just a PC or Mac
plus play back of a 720p MKV file requires twice the processing power of 1080p AVI so many more people with older systems would be able to watch it."
[T],FatFreddy69,2010-03-25T15:23Z,"because the 280 pixels difference are the two horizontal black bars which were cropped because they take up to 700 MB with no use any way because your player will play those anyway, 
 but I see you never ripped in your life but just love to bully about on other people's hard work. You make a BRRip then see what it takes. You talk double dutch mate, why don't you stick with your old fashined AVI crap and take your hand away from my x264 torrents.

You see those black bars any way without having  those apx 700 MB extra in the file.

If the black bars were not removed 
like here:

http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Thirteenth-Floor-Blu-ray/3961/

then would be (theoretically) 1080p but the  real actual movie is only  800p, the full 1080p has the damned black bars included.

When you play this damned 1920 x 800
your player will add the missing 280p black bars.

I don't know how to make my self more clear.

Why is that always those who don't know like to show off how ""smart"" they are?

Unthankful bullies will all burn in hell!"

,boxorats,2010-05-22T22:36Z,"Thanks mkvonly! Also highly appreciated is the very clear and careful description of your encoding process and so on. It's great to get rid of the 'letterboxing' bars to save space -- too bad somebody comments rudely, though I suppose I can understand how people would be confused about aspect ratio issues if they've never thought about what they've been looking at all these years. I guess another way to explain to the confused is to note that the aspect ratio of a television set, or other display monitor, is way less than the frame ratio of a movie that's shot relatively wide. So if your HDTV has a physical screen ratio of 16/9 or whatever, a movie that was shot 2.35 or 2.40, as examples, obviously can't ""fill"" the vertical dimension of the TV monitor unless a lot of the edges were cropped off. It's basic geometry. (""1080 pixels is just how 'high' the TV set is, nothing to do with the original movie or anything, which can be whatever the director of the film decides to run with when he's making a movie."") It's worth noting that aspect ratio is the creative choice of the movie director and it's not a fundamentally set ratio at all, it depends on what the director and DP did in camera and/or the editing room, it doesn't have to conform to one of the recognized ratios, you can shoot your film 2/1 or 2.950063453627 to 1 if you are so inclined."
,boxorats,2010-05-22T22:39Z,"Also: I love how you've included the dub track as a separate file so it's an optional extra download for those of us who don't require the Hungarian audio track! That is so careful and great, thanks!"
,raterillo,2010-08-31T23:11Z,black horizontal bars
,raterillo,2010-08-31T23:16Z,"oops sorry about what posted above!!!  I red later the explanation this not has that bars (and that's good, 800 vertical is enaugh for me but the title of post would be 800 vertical and not 1080)"
