    beautiful free-kick into the corner of the goal on your iPhone or     
    iPod Touch.                                                           
                                                                          
    Swipe the screen to kick the ball - apply power, direction and        
    swerve to your shots. The simple, intuitive controls make             
    KickSwerve easy to pick up and play for a minute at a time and        
    offer the depth to make it difficult to master and keep you coming    
    back for more.

     Main Game challenges the player to beat the 'keeper and a wall      
    in 50 free-kick scenarios.                                            
                                                                          
     Quickplay randomises the placement and set-up of the wall,          
    'keeper and ball, offering endless variety!                           
                                                                          
     Crossbar Challenge is the classic test of accuracy. Hit the bar     
    as many times as you can in 60 seconds.                               
                                                                          
     Tyre Targets challenges the player to guide as many shots as        
    possible through hanging tyres in the space of a minute. The tyres    
    act under realistic physics, so shots need to be accurate or          
    they'll start swing about!                                            
                                                                          
     View your replays in slow motion from 3 angles and save them to     
    view later in the Replay Gallery. From there, you can upload your     
    best replays to share with friends to view on their device or         
    online.
