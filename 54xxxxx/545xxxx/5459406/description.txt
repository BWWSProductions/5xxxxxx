BB FlashBack Pro Overview
BB FlashBack Pro allows users to record the whole, or selected areas of, their computer screen. Once captured these recordings can be replayed, edited, produced and published into a wide range of formats. Unlike most screen recording software, BB FlashBack Pro uses a special capture driver to intelligently detect the changes in your screen. This method of recording minimises the strain on PC resources during recording, produces crystal clear movie quality and delivers a low file size.

For ease of use BB FlashBack Pro is divided into two sections: the recorder and the player. BB FlashBack Pro recorder deals with all aspects of capturing your screen. After recording, movies can be loaded into the BB FlashBack Pro player and edited by inserting, removing, cutting or pasting footage. Text annotations, sound effects, imported graphics and spoken commentaries are all fully supported. Text can be added into your movie with a variety of different effects, or inside highlighted boxes and callouts. Sound can be recorded from a PC microphone or any other sound input into your computer; either â€˜on the flyâ€™ while capturing your screen, or added later in the BB FlashBack Pro editor.

To polish presentations a range of extra production tools are available. The speed of the movie can be tweaked and changed at selected areas. Mouse cursor movements can be shown, hidden or re-recorded altogether. Your own graphics can also be imported into the movie and positioned and displayed as desired.

For navigation through your footage, BB FlashBack Pro player allows users the ability to jump to the next selected movie event such as â€œnext mouse clickâ€ or â€œlast keypressâ€. Along with this functionality a helpful timeline and preview panel are part of the FlashBack player to allow browsing through the footage. Searching for text inside the movie is also possible.
