This is much of the content available on The Fuelless Enginecom. There are so called "Plans" 

to build an electric motor that generates electricity while it runs. I'll save you the expense of 

purchasing the plans. I don't think they are very good, but there are some interesting things 

here.

There is some good information on High Voltage applications.

Worth your time to download, if I got the torrent setup right.
