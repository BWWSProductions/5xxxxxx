,pretoria114,2010-06-12T23:35Z,"Thanks to the uploader. And to you guys who are having problems: The first, why its not speaking; you have to first install the language pack of your choice, ie, the speach synthesiser and you can get that for free from nuance download page. The second guy that says certificate error; this is a common problem since the app is generally unsigned, you have to get a cert for your phone's emei. Post another comment and I will explain further if you are still having problems."
,christer.26,2010-06-29T23:07Z,Have a Nokia N70 and I got the same sertificate error. This is because the program from Nuance is unsigned... Therefor I need a sertificate for my phones emay. How can a get a sert for my phones emay? Please write a short discribtion how to get it work. Thanks!
,pretoria114,2010-07-08T06:44Z,"OK here's what you need to do: Go to http://cer.opda.cn/en/index.php?module=index&action= and register a new account, there you will be able to apply for a certificate for your phone's emei. When you have your cer and key files download a program called signsis, you can use this app to sign the installer and it should work."
