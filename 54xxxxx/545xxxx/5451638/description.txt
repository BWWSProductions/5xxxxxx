    You had hoped for a simple career as a space miner working for        
    Vesta Corp, but it wasn't to be. Forces based on the asteroid         
    Ceres have invaded Vesta Corp space and it has fallen to you to       
    defend the territory.                                                 
                                                                          
    Battle alongside your Vesta Corp comrades as you dodge and destroy    
    asteroids, pick off enemy scouts, and finally stand against the       
    Ceres Corp invasion fleet.                                            
                                                                          
    Battle for Vesta features a first person view of a fully 3D           
    environment that players are free to explore as they choose. Dive     
    headfirst into a massive tangle of dogfights or run for your life.    
                                                                          
    Touch based controls are intuitive and accurate. You can swing        
    your ship around 180 degrees in an instant with a swipe of your       
    finger or make tiny adjustments to pick off a distant enemy. A        
    heads-up display leads you to the nearest targets via radar and       
    highlights all friends and foes.
