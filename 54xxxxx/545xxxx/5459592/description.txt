About DJ Arim (written by him)

my name is goran lovric; born in zagreb, raised in vodice later in graz, now getting old (studying) in graz and rejuvenating (holidays) in vodice; music for me is not just a background sound or radio, concerts and clubbings

music for me is emotion, being happy, becoming aggressive, hangin around with people, men, women, love, sex, culture, movies, being in a film, being watched, creation, commentary, experimental, certain, weak, weather, aspect, ideal, dreams, floating - in fact the creative side of life; one part of us is responsible for learning how to write, speak, calculate or understand history, the other one finds this information and doesn't know what to do with it

to understand music, to be music you have to be the crowd, overcome all differences in race/religion/colour/language/culture/looks/appearance; collecting information means understanding it and posessing knowledge and creativity means being able to express oneself, expressing oneself means being social - music is social, is uniting

music depends on the occassion, on the social constellation uniting all diversity, not on the musical genre/stlye or year of publication nor on the century and its origins; it's a matter of moment, here and now, good or annoying, chilling or "loj"-ing ("loj" is a word often used by my surroundings - hardly translatable, but means something like "rocking")

people listen to music, people make music, life is music, music is emotion and emotions colour our life; emotions are the main reason why we differ from each other

our diversity reflects in music and we all are followed by music, some more some less; some looking back, some trying to shake off the pursuer,

...but music will allways be and i will be part of it (at least all my life)
