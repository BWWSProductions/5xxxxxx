The entire collection of the Stargate Atlantis TV show episodes. Episodes are labeled as SGA 0xyz--SGA standing for Stargate Atlantis, 0x for the season number of the episode, yz as the episode number (i.e. SGA 0101 0102 Rising--airing in two parts but distributed as one dual-length episode, hence the labeling. Normal episode--SGA 0411 Be All My Sins Remember'd). Seeds would be very appreciated, as my bandwidth is not very good. Thank you very much.
