,Hutch822,2010-03-22T04:32Z,"Downloading now... Will seed!

Fakes are around so will update if quality/legit is good"
,teabag87,2010-03-22T04:35Z,im pretty sure all the fakes were about 350mb
,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T04:46Z,"Im downloading now, will comment when finished, looks legit, although its not up on EZTV yet so im suspicous....."
,phail_saph,2010-03-22T04:55Z,C'mon guys look at the file structure...all rar's. Nobody does that anymore...>90% fake. It's done to purposely real you in since you can't tell. If you get a tspBay letter let me know ;p
,phail_saph,2010-03-22T04:57Z,Plus check TvTeam's history...all bullshit...I highly recommend you wait until EZTV gives the go ahead.
,DeepPirate,2010-03-22T05:07Z,"Um, TvTeam are legit uploaders."
,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T05:11Z,"Hey noob, rar files are quicker to upload, they prolly wanted to get it up as fast as possible, all you have to do it use win rar and put them back togeather, tvteam is a legit uploader"
,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T05:11Z,"Ill comment when finished, eztv is slow to get this one up, they were last week too, ill comment when finished on legit/quality"
,MeNoob,2010-03-22T05:19Z,Great & fast job TvTeam. [EZTV] is getting slower & slower nowadays. Thanks.! :)
,phail_saph,2010-03-22T05:23Z,"@frivilousMC Are you a fucking moron...you were even ""suspicious."" AND you are waiting to give us feedback! Fucking hypocrite. It is apparent you are the noob...or have been lucky and never been caught. I was just looking out for you guys...sharing best pirating practices and as to the upload speed you don't know what you are talking about...dumb ass. "
,DeepPirate,2010-03-22T05:26Z,"TvTeam are legit, which is why they have a skull & bones icon next to their name.  The file is broken up into rar's for compatibility with usenet.

No need for FUD."
,phail_saph,2010-03-22T05:29Z,@DeepPirate Hope your right...been burned by a green skull and bones before...just looking out for everyone. Can't wait to get a copy!
,TheAussie00,2010-03-22T05:29Z,"phail_saph, stfu and learn how to check comments. TvTeam has legit uploads with very positive feedback.
Go troll somewhere else."
,phail_saph,2010-03-22T05:34Z,@theAussie00 lolz...follow your own advice...
,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T05:35Z,"LOL im a noob, eztv just uploaded the exact same file lol fucking losers.  This is legit, please seed im only half done this is so painful been waiting all week for this one, thanks guys will comment on quality when its done but im sure its good"
,drjft,2010-03-22T05:42Z,Anyone else getting no seeders? I've got 44 Peers and no seeders.
,phail_saph,2010-03-22T05:44Z,@frivalousMC Wow dude you are dumb...EZTV has verified for us the validity...assuming he used this RAR...he performed a valuable service...and his torrent is a separate clean torrent we can trust...recommendation to all the smart pirates to use EZTV's.
,Hutch822,2010-03-22T05:45Z,"estv did in fact just upload 0min ago :P

I'm getting 50 peers and 0 seeders

70% finished --- almost there"
,beachbums624,2010-03-22T05:48Z,"i notice that there are no seeders on this torrent, i predict it will stop and no one will have the file"
,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T05:49Z,"Hey phail stop posting dumb ass noob comments, have you ever heard of winrar you noob loser, takes two minutes too zip it back togeather lol get a load of this guy lol.  It takes longer to zip it togeather and then upload it thats why this one is in rar. files, maybe you should do your homework, I will seed this when finished 100 % real, its just a rar. file no big deal, thanks uploader been waiting all week for this one......phail- you epically phail go back to playing world of warcraft ha ha ha"
,DeepPirate,2010-03-22T05:52Z,Just because your client shows zero seeders doesn't mean the file is not being seeded.  I've downloaded tons of TvTeam's torrents without any issues.
,phail_saph,2010-03-22T05:56Z,"@frivalousMiniCock...lolz...you really don't know what you are talking about, I love it; it's so clear that you don't know shit haha...do you even know what the internet is..."
,beachbums624,2010-03-22T05:56Z,"thats nice  , i am only 48 and been up'ing and dl'ing for decades now ,  i will let you know if this goes through ,  i dont care what the little icon color is "
,drjft,2010-03-22T05:58Z,"This is acting like there's no seeders. I'm only DL'ing at 15-25kbps, when last night I was peaking with only 3 seeders."
,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T06:00Z,"OMG 70 % lol this is painful, please seed when your finished I will do the same, this is a great show I want to get it out there a.s.a.p, if you have trouble with the rar. files all you need is a small and free program winrar. , it zips them back togeather and you got yourself an avi. file, this is 100 % legit,  Please seed when finished thanks !! SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED and I will seed it all night for everyone thanks !!"
,phail_saph,2010-03-22T06:05Z,you are stuck at 70%!?...it's been an hour for you...I just started EZTV's about 20 minutes ago and I just broke 70%...
,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T06:05Z,"@phail your such a dbag dude, first of all check tvteams upload history 100 % legit, second check eztv they have the same file up, third of all your such a noob you dont even know how to deal with rar. files, and fourth your obviously downloading the file or you wouldnt continue posting on this page so suck it buddy, with a name like phail what else can you do?? Dont listen to this loser its 100 % real, and your best chance of watching it tonight, please seed when finished so everyone can enjoy, thanks and phail just log back on to WOW and meet your guild lol"
,phail_saph,2010-03-22T06:12Z,"@MC or as his friends call him...MiniCock...Why are you rooting so strongly for this torrent...now that is suspicious in and of itself. Another ""computer"" lesson for you...EZTV is using a separate torrent with a separate AVI file...yes, assuming this torrent is valid he may have created it from this...verifying for us that this is a good torrent...and then seeded his own. But it is a separate file and torrent so stop spreading disinformation. A very, valuable service that EZTV did for us. That's why he's the best. As to the reason why I still remain, I'm here to watch my buddies' backs for guys like you."
,beachbums624,2010-03-22T06:26Z,whooo-hoo   i see some seeders  now
,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T06:33Z,"Just finished downloading and zipped it togeather, works fine a-9 v-9 thanks uploader,(works on xbox and ps3 as well) ill SEED this one for everyone that wants to download it.  All you need is a program called winrar. its zips rar. files togeather into an avi file, just tested it works fine, you can always find the avi file somewhere im sure if you are an epic noob like PHAIL, thanks tvteam much appreciated for getting it up early, cheers !!  Dont listen to this fucking peasant phail, his mom and little sister know it aint a mini cock, they were walking bulllegged for a week lol go back to world of warcraft your guild is waiting for you lol fatty"

,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T08:25Z,"@phail wow you were already five minutes in and you started downloading way before me, and I had to take five minutes to zip it togeather and posted this twenty minutes after i was done cause I had to run to the store, so in reality, you epically phail once again lol congrats buddy! Go back to your plow you fucking peasant, god damn plebs who needs em!!"
,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T08:26Z,"@PHAIL So back to your original point this was a legit upload and you are a fucking idiot, thanks for proving my point peasant, have a great night !!!"
,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T08:27Z,"@phail tell your sister to shave her bush, it looked like guadal canal !! baha ha ha ha ha "
,frivalousMC,2010-03-22T08:29Z,"Thanks for the upload tv team, i appreciate you got it up first, even if some people cant figure out how to unzip rar. files we do appreciate the effort to get it up as fast as possible, cheers boys/girls !! Ill seed this all night, there are now avi. uploads on though if you are like PHAIL and you just cant figure it out"
,freaklust,2010-03-22T09:07Z,"Dude what is wrong with you? You started the suspicion with the torrent. Phail_Saph was just giving his two cents. RAR files ARE history and like someone mentioned only for usenet use really which is a dwindling culture and NOBODY uses winrar you use Powerarchiver, full version that you get off TPB. "

,TheAussie00,2010-03-22T09:45Z,"Great torrent, A9/V9. Makes sense to download this aswell: 0.7 seeders to 1 leecher, unlike 1 seeder to 5 leechers (eztv)
Argh I wish I could just watch the whole miniseries at once like I did with BoB! But I'll have to wait episode by episode like everyone else :("
