,davektm,2010-03-22T11:28Z,"Loving the hd ama supercross hdtv rips . Uploading to others that cant get this in their country is absolutely fantastic of you , but a get rich qik scheme is a fucking joke FFS you got to be kidding me , how dare you even fucking ask .
Fucking rude no doubt , not a cent outta me , but hey thanx alot for the FREE upload !"
,ProCircuit,2010-03-22T13:41Z,"Good on him for asking why not??? a small donation from those  with no chance of watching the rounds /or who ever /is a token of  respect for slicks effets  and punctual uploads, 
If you get rich quick ( good on ya! ).
Here in AUS we have to wait a week , fork out upto $80.00 / month for 1.5 hours of racing and 30mins of bullshit to some get rich quick pay tv provider."
,mrduke77,2010-03-22T14:52Z,thanx from japan!!!!
,bender101,2010-03-22T15:04Z,Thanks from Argentina.
,mikebrownsound,2010-03-22T15:14Z,"Hey slick! Thanks once again, ive been download from you since 06 i think.  But the last to rounds have been laggy? Interuptions and screenfails, have you recorded or change anything?   Dear regards MBS"
,848,2010-03-22T15:17Z,"@davektm- Video capture equipment and all the other stuff it takes to encode/upload these races costs money. You realize that, right? If anyone's willing to donate then that's fine. He's not demanding that you pay anything. Nothing rude about that.

Thanks again for the uploads slick."
,Asher951,2010-03-22T16:35Z,"dude since you switched to hd they don't play right on alot of our computers!!!

upload a non hd version PLEASE!!!!!!"
,agm137,2010-03-22T16:42Z,Thanks a lot from Russia!!! HD quality is the best!
,mikebrownsound,2010-03-22T16:47Z,"I also checked what the difference was between the working HD file from last week and the not good working file from this week lites.   If you right click on vlc and check power and mediainfo  
power 0 says :
codec: mp4a 
language: english
Type: Sound
Samplefrequence: 48000 HZ
bite per bla bla
bitefrequence bla bla.

Power 1 says 
Codect avc1
and the rest is as last weekend, 

But the different is that  They are vice versa on this new file,  Power 0 and Power 1.   On the working file  the first  power 0 starts with mp4a, on the not working the power 0 starts with avc1.   It should be  like the first one, "
,agm137,2010-03-22T16:47Z,"To Asher951!
You can download free version of ""The KMPlayer"". This player can read all types of media - HD or not HD."
,KuRsse,2010-03-22T20:23Z,Thanks Slicknick... I will donate something... keep up the good job.
,davektm,2010-03-22T21:36Z,"Procircuit  - I I too am from  Australia and have never paid a cent to watch any motor racing , sounds like like you too much cents and not enough sense .
848 TV capture card and the like are now standard equipment on a computer - what $109-00 for a card ? pfffft 
Like i said appreciate the upload but asking for money IS BS , it is called sharing   :)"
,Hardcore,2010-03-22T21:54Z,"Why can't you just upload a version that actually works, instead of this shit?"
,jeffro30,2010-03-22T22:17Z,is anybody else having the video getting stuck??
,jeffro30,2010-03-22T22:24Z,"Hey Slick first time having problem with one of your videos.....Do you know why is this gettin stuck like every second????....thanks :)

And also for user Hardcore if you donÂ´t like the uploads so suck my ass, you should be thankfull and not beatching on slicknick he always make a great job with the vids, I hate fucking loosers bitching on everything...."
,slicknick610,2010-03-23T00:04Z,"About the donations. A bunch of people on a forum asked me about making donations. I never even thought of the idea. Then they brought up that they would donate even more for HD. I had to buy a HD capture device and a computer with a quad core processor. 

As for all the problems I havent changed anything since the Daytona torrent. I have a desktop and a laptop and both of them play these torrents just fine. Also my xbox 360 plays them perfectly too."
,jeffro30,2010-03-23T01:48Z,"slicknick that is the rare thing, I have played all of them with VLC and no problem till now, which player are you using????....do you have any idea why might this happening??"
,jeffro30,2010-03-23T01:57Z,"and also if I play any of the other 10 races they all run good, but this one"
,jeffro30,2010-03-23T02:23Z,"Hey listen everybody I just Installed the K-Lite_Codec_Pack_583_Full and it worsks flawless, hope it works for everyone

Note: I matched all .mp4 video file extensions, just in case"
,jeffro30,2010-03-24T05:26Z,"To bad dude, well I did selected al the mp4 extension file during the installation, make sure you did this, if nothing after this.... I have no idea...sorry dude wish you the best"
