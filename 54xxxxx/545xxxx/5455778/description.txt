"Four Cops Shot"

When Detectives Cyrus Lupo (Jeremy Sisto) and Kevin Bernard 
(Anthony Anderson) arrive on the scene of four fallen 
police officers, they have to act fast to find the shooter. 
With a room full of witnesses, they have a description of 
the culprit but little else. The case becomes even more 
complex when the detectives discover that the police 
officers may have known the shooter. The investigation 
quickly leads them to a circuit of drug dealers, a jealous 
husband and a remorseful judge who are all pieces of a 
larger puzzle.

Enjoy :)
