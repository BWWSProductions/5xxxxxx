thanks for sharing this fantastic series with us. as you must know, if you were a fan of the show, and were a subscriber to showtime, and you didn't record any of the shows because you knew it would last forever, you would pull up ""zip"" in google for over 10 years, so it amazing that so many downloaders knew to be looking for this, and then you serve it up on a pirate platter !!! 
you deserve a Platinum Star for all your efforts, but you can't have it until you UPLOAD 3X15 = ""Ode to Billie and Joe"" (and seed)=IT'S MISSING. 
don't hate me for saying this, but the only other comedy i know worth finding, that isn't available in any market (except utube), is ""Working"" (1997-99), with Fred Savage. oh, yeah, also SNL and MadTV seasons, are hard as hen's teeth to find. so, if you want to further help humanity.......
i wish you continued success in finding and sharing shows that don't exist."
