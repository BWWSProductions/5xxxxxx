,JustCallMeD,2010-03-25T22:43Z,"Downloaded just fine, installed via CD as I couldn't get it to mount with PowerISO.
It installed without a problem, but wouldn't start up as it had issues with the screen resolution - needing it to be lowered to1024x768. And after that, it gave me an error and refused to start claiming there was something wrong with my sound card and that it needed to be in 16 bit.....
I have been unsuccessful in running this program. I can't get it past that last mentioned suposed 'error'.
I am running Windows 7.
I have now removed and uninstalled the program until someone has a solution...?"

,pac07metal,2010-05-27T21:07Z,Does anyone know which version is this?
,pac07metal,2010-05-28T02:11Z,Just downloaded this. This is the 5th version which was made around the year 2000. This version is outdated and I would not recommend this old version (according to the Tell me More website the current version is 10).
,maxmak,2010-08-19T02:06Z,"The guy above me says that this is Version 5 while the picture shows it as the Version 9, so this creates a confusion for me. But I do agree with the Version 10 recommendation. 

So please do the entire humanity a favour and upload version 10"
