Engineers should exist in this world!!! :)"
,swe_Bogus,2010-03-23T16:01Z,I'll be happy to give feedback as soon as i can get this one down. There aren't any seeders up.
,geezer55,2010-03-25T18:22Z,"Yeah, stuck at .522 avail
On a 3.3GB upload you gotta hang on until at least 2 guys get it all
(as in 100%)"
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-03-25T22:10Z,i am fed up with complain.i am stuck blar-blar-blar. ve been seeding. infact ve uploaded 6 gig so far. hit and run is bad. look guys don't expect me to on my pc for ever. 
,geezer55,2010-03-26T06:03Z,"BLACKTROY:
You have absolutely no understanding of how torrent works
In uTorrent ""peers"" tab NO ONE has more than 56.8%. There are 276 leechers, 68 ACTIVELY sucking up the files avail from others. Thats the problem with very popular large multi GB downloads.
6GB transfer on your side DOES NOT MEAN 2 leechers have the file. 
It means 276 peers have gotten SOME of your files.
NOBODY HAS HIT AND RUN.
NOBODY HAS GOTTEN AUTOCAD 2011.
NOBODY!!!!
GOT IT????
You have no right to be mad. We do.
You wasted our time."
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-03-26T09:34Z,"geezer55 -----  so you ve the right to be mad at me the uploader. lol? you such ungrateful sod. get a life. ;

,lefree,2010-12-30T09:27Z,"Good morning and happy new year!
I am from Greece, working on a program that works with the Autocad. The version I have is for 2004. I wanted to ask if they'll be easy to send you the 2008 version and if you could help me with your knowledge to crack the program. If you have any doubt about who I am, the website of the company that sell it is www.art-cad.gr but the bad news is that you can not download a trial version like in Autocad, if you could find a solution I will be grateful. I wish you the best for the new year!"
