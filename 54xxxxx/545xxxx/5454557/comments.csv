While the iso is mounted (and the files are showing), open up Rosetta Stone and on the top right find the option in one of the drop down menus that says ""add or remove languages."" Follow the prompts and find the language you want to add that is currently being mounted. That easy! (REMEMBER - Never update or register...EVER!) "

I have started using this torrent, and it works great! Thanks for uploading it. I'm currently in Unit 1 Lesson 2. I notice that sub lessons (like Pronunciation, Reading, Grammar) within the Lesson 2 alternate between sub lessons from Lesson 2 and Lesson 1. Meaning that, I am repeating some of the Lesson 1 sub lessons within Lesson 2. Is there a way around this? Is it from not activating, or is this just how Rosetta Stone is structured?

however I'm proving too computer retarded to use it. ): I downloaded the Rosetta Stone Version 3 Crack torrent, I'm able to get it to work but when it comes to instructing me to ""add languages"" I'm stumped. I've used Daemon Tools Lite to mount the first French lessons ISO file to the virtual drive, however this doesn't seem to do anything. I've also simply burnt the ISO file to DVD and CD but neither of these play on Rosetta Stone. Can someone walk me through what to do?
Thank you. :) "
,PapiJack,2011-05-31T20:19Z,"For all the new people that is having trouble. 

There is a difference between a language pack and the software itself. This torrent is a ISO image (virtual CD-ROM) of the French language pack. It will not run by itself.

So you have to do the following:

1) Download a cracked version of the Rosetta Stone software (Rosetta Stone 3.4.5 + Crack(VasiaZozulia) I believe is the one I downloaded.

2) Install it following the instructions on the README.TXT file. Always read it! It is very important. Don't let the program launch right after it's installed and never update anything.

3) Use an ISO software manager like DeamonTools or such to mount the language pack images into a virtual CD drive. That mimics the action of inserting a CD-ROM into your computer. 
If you don't know how to handle ISO files and/or virtual CD images do a Google search. It might take you a minute to get it but it is not hard.

4) Once you got the image mounted on your virtual CD-ROM run the Rosetta Stone and add the language pack. If you don't get prompted to it just go to the top right cornet and find it in the drop down menus.

5) After you add the language pack the program will prompt you to an update. Skip that.

6) Enjoy your new program.

I hope this help."

,monstaber,2012-02-13T00:35Z,"--HOW TO DOWNLOAD--

I experienced some confusion myself, here's how to do it.
1. Download the torrent.
2. Put all the MP3 files and the picture file into a folder on your desktop..
3. Extract the three ISO files using PowerISO into their own folder on your desktop, name them FrenchL1, FrenchL2, or French L3 as appropriate. Each should contain 4 subfolders.
4. Use Windows Explorer to burn each folder onto a CD. If it asks, select ""for use in CD/DVD player,"" not ""as a USB flash drive"".
5. After they're all burned, insert L1, open Rosetta, and add the language. Repeat until all 3 levels are added.

Then TURN OFF YOUR INTERNET and use the hilarious ""register by phone"" function in Rostetta to register the software. (this works with all Microsoft programs as too, for your information, including OS's, Office, etc.)

Cheers, fellow Pirates."

,DrHenry,2012-05-09T19:16Z,"--How To Download WITHOUT A CD/DVD--

1. Download the actual Rosetta Stone software torrent (if you don't have it) from here:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso
2. Open the iso file with PowerISO (or a similar application)
3. Follow the instructions in the ""How to Install"" pdf file.
4. After successfully installing Rosetta Stone by following the instructions in the PDF file, run Rosetta Stone.
5. Now go into your torrent download folder and open the torrent folder for this torrent. (Should be labeled ""Rosetta Stone V3 - French"") and mount the French L1 iso file (with a program such as PowerISO) 
6. Then go to the Rosetta Stone program and click ""Add a Language Level"". 
4. After it finishes installing and updating, go back to the folder and now mount French L2 and then back in the Rosetta Stone program, up in the upper right corner click the second yellow circle and choose click ""Add or Remove Languages"". Click ""Add a Language Level"" and it'll install French L2.
5. And finally Mount French L3 and in the Rosetta Stone program repeat the same process"".

HAVING ACTIVATION PROBLEMS? These are just the language files. Activation deals with the Rosetta Stone software. Go back to your Rosetta Stone torrent download and re-install properly, being sure to copy the crack file over BEFORE you run the program. Again, the program and the crack are not in this torrent.

Best of luck, mates. Hope this clears up confusion and you can now begin learning a new language!"
