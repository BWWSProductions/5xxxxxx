,jeff_hudson,2010-08-06T05:59Z,Don't bother if you are current with Windows 7.  Cannot use the patch.exe which disables the 30 day trial.  Just errors if you try to run it or copy and paste.

,ForFun00,2012-01-14T14:03Z,"2012/01/14, hi, this comment is for the UPDATES only.

BLACKTROY, I been using your torrents for many years now, and I want to thank you for your kindness, and report back to you that this is the only torrent I can't figure out for the updates.
The same patch that works for the installation, doesnâ€™t work for updates. 

For over a year as of today I been trying to install ""en_qbwebpatch v11.exe"" downloaded from QuickBooks site, without success.

Up to 2010 I used WXP, also SP 2 and 3, since April 2011 I upgraded to W7 Ultimate, also updated to SP1, running the patch for the upgrade, in â€œallâ€ mentioned operating systems, without success.

I run the patch regularly and as ""admin"", also stopped ""ALL related services"" for QB; I tried rebooting, non-rebooting, uninstalling and re-installing, and so on, without success. I all ways get the 30 days trial window.

If anybody had the same problem, or updated and the patch worked, please can you write a detailed description of what you did that worked!

Thanks a Lot!"

,bdashill,2012-06-18T20:56Z,"Thanks for the upload.  However I've tried on multiple PCs and none will let me run the keygen.exe file.  It just says ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file.  You may not have the appropriate permissions to access them.""  

I've tried doing the right-click run as admin options but no luck.  Any suggestions?  Thanks"
