,do0d,2010-03-22T15:46Z,This is an old series and I believe there are a few copies of the full season here on tpb.  This is not the new one on Discover as that is narrated by Oprah Winfrey.

Technically you are right. However this IS the new series, just narrated by David Attenborough, the way it should be. You see, this exact series aired in the UK last year. They took the same video and just let Oprah read the script. They did the same thing with Planet Earth, with Sigourney Weaver reading instead of Attenborough. Its a shame too.

I can handle Sigourney, but not Oprah. Her voice makes me sick."
,Livens,2010-03-26T01:20Z,Nooooooooooooooooo! Crap. Just finished DL'd and it IS the Oprah version! And a crappy grainy one at that! This type of show is best watched in HD.

Livens is exactly right.
