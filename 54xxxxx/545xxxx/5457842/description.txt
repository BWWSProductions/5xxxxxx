      HLS once again released a shady rip with shady subs. This     
      time around it was a "bdrip". Given the fact no src sample    
      was supplied, the subs were not retail src (see some          
      screenshots attached) and they never followed with an x264    
      release we conclude it was a simple reencode from a german    
      scene x264 rip combined with srt fansubs converted to         
      vobsubs in a lame attempt to disguise they are not retail     
      ones. Further more anyyone who knows how resized bluray .sup  
      look like can easily tell the HLS subs didn't come from any   
      bluray (resized bluray subs always look faint). In another    
      pathetic attempt to make them look like retail subs they      
      also converted them to some fancy font. Looking in the .idx   
      file you'll find they were created with Subtitle Creator      
      which is a tool for converting srt to vobsubs.                
                                                                    
      The same subs were also used before by another bunch of       
      jokers called America but they weren't as sophisticated and   
      pre'd them in their original srt glory.                       
                                                                    
      One can go and claim it's silly to proper over subs, we've    
      heard shit like "release just a subpack", well guess what?    
      we don't want to. We don't support grps who manufacture       
      releases hoping no one will notice or care.
