Thanks for the encode/upload.

Love the fact that you packaged last weeks OT into the bundle.

Any idea on why the show was so late being 'upped'? Not by you BUT by ANYONE?

Doesn't matter have it now. I get my Bill fix. I did try that 'mini' but it just wasn't the same.

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-03-24T15:59Z,"Hi 20-40,
Just a question on your schedule.
[Legend of the Seeker S02E15] isn't listed for this Sunday. Have you dropped it?

I know it is off-air the following week (i.e. 3 April) and then is 'scheduled' to air the last 4 shows of S2 between 10 April & 1 May.

Just wondering? I hope you haven't dropped it but would understand if more H&R freaks just made it not worth your while.
Maybe I just have my dates wrong and it is not on air (i.e. E15) next week.

Cheers
Jon"

>""twentyforty at 2010-03-21 10:21 CET: 

Number of Hit&Run exceeded 90%.
Are people so crazy?

Well, same as for Caprica yesterday - this show is GONE FOREVER from my schedule.

eztv will be lucky to have such peers.

Now... please... could someone step up and ask me for something or maybe place some request? ""

In short, it was failure, of epic proportions. LOTS stayed without seeders within ONE fucking hour. In first hour (not counting myself and one similar sucker) - in most critical time - and out of 17 first 100%-ers.

I have said and warned that such behavior wont be tolerated.

Regarding last weeks RT. no one has captured the show on Thursday, on second airing, on third and - someone showed mercy and captured fourth airing... Silly, especially today in times of TiVo and digital recordings...

Only one recording/encoding, a micro mkv floated around since Saturday and I mailed you a link...

@sasash: Later tonight goes
The.Imaginarium.of.Doctor.Parnassus.2009.DVDRip.H264[PC.Mac.Xbox.PS3.ipod].mp4
394 MB."
,jon4fun,2010-03-24T17:16Z,"@ 20-40,
Sorry, I missed your comment on LOTS, my fault for not checking back into the comments on that torrent, but I did see it in relation Caprica.
I was afraid it was because of H&R bastards.

Ah well, you tried and WE (the downloaders) failed.

@ ALL, I have one thing to say to all you H&R FUCKS! This is what happens when you don't seed. Now we fans (of this show) suffer because of you greedy bastards.

@20-40, please excuse my language, I know you warn about using foul language... but I'm pissed off. NOT at you but at all the H&R F%^* .

Thank you for sticking with LOTS for so long. I appreciate your efforts.

Cheers
Jon
P.S. thanks for the update on RT with Bill. As you say 'in the age of Tivo"" etc. Weird!"
