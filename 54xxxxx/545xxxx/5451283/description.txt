- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   For all you over-zealous nukers, there is a pop on track 3 at around 0:18.
   This is on the source.  Compared to two cd players and my car stereo. You 
   can also very slightly hear it in the shitty myspace album stream.

   For years, Dillinger Escape Plan have been the metal standard-bearers of
   dizzying, time-signature torture, though they have occasionally eased up to
   construct NIN-damaged, alt-rock superhero fantasies. The band's fourth album
   gives these two personalities their most seamless marriage to date, as
   aggro-prog headfucks roar with the anthemic crush-and-croon of late-period
   Faith No More. "Widower" is a beautiful, early-Lollapalooza-era treat,
   featuring Bowie's Aladdin Sane pianist Mike Garson, who helps push the vocal
   cords of sensitive-to-seething-to-soaring frontman Greg Puciato to the
   harrowing edge.
