,stardude,2010-03-22T01:51Z,"This release if fake. It's NOT a DVDrip with DD5.1 AC3.

It's another R5 with a bad buzzing Line audio >=(("
,CrimsonSilver,2010-03-22T03:27Z,"V: 8.5
A: 7.5
This does look like R5 but is appears as good quality with skip through and audio check; better quality then other releases (MXMG). 

Audio is ok, no buzzing from what I can hear.

 Vision releases are usually pretty good compared to the other guys."

,bychance,2010-03-26T03:58Z,"Your 02/18/2010 upload was good enough RH. This one was not necessary as theres
 no improvement in the audio. I'm sure others will appreciate it more. V10 anyway."
,ambhai,2010-04-04T16:19Z,THIS IS FAKE DVDRIP!!! AUDIO IS CAM LOW QUALITY
,hinchey,2010-04-18T20:28Z,take the green skull away please tpb
,spiritwarrior,2010-04-20T21:03Z,"No matter the quality, though I am sure it is great, Ray has uploaded the best torrents i have seen throughout my searches. He is the only source for all my searches, he tops even axxo in my book (obviously since hes still around and axxo is... well not). The newer the better and if Ray has it upped then its a torrent well worth watching :)"
