IMAGiNE NOTES

Well this is just a re-encode of the russian TS XViD (thanks) mixed with our own line.
The video is nice so it was not worth getting....we've opted to do a few tweaks here and there on it but nothing major.
The audio is not the greatest we've had, but still better than cam audio. The audio picked up a high pitch sound for some reason but we've cleaned it up the best we could.
