If you have a brain, it's not."
,robin_france,2010-03-22T23:51Z,"hmmm presumably the reason why it is so difficult to find this book is that the publishers are so concerned about our mental health...
on Amazon.fr for example it says

""Actuellement indisponible. Nous ne savons pas quand cet article sera de nouveau approvisionnĂŠ ni s'il le sera.""
(currently unavailable. We don't know when this article will be restocked nor if it will be."")

But as the summar says... Read the book, then you decide.
