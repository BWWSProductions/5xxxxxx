,amyadkins,2010-06-11T13:15Z,"Can you guys seriously not torrent an avi instead of .rar files?  I really don't see the point in this.  Breaking an avi up into rars doesn't seem to serve any purpose.  It doesn't protect against ""corrupted downloads so you can re-download the .rar section that didn't download properly"", it doesn't ""make the torrent stay up on the site longer because .avis get taken down a lot faster and downloading an avi outright will get you a letter from your ISP"", it doesn't make it download any faster.  The only logical explanation for anyone sharing a 30-minute TV show broken up into several .rar files?  The seeder is severely mentally handicapped and retarded.  It's okay, though, because I hope that one of these days...maybe...someday...hopefully soon...in the near future...you'll see the light and realize that it's really too much trouble and a lot of useless busywork to share a TV show in this manner.  Kinda like an autistic photographer who protects his photos online by using an image map to break his pictures up into little pieces so if someone tries to right-click and save one of his works of art, they'd only get a little slice, mua-ha-ha!!

Fucking retard.  :)"
