,ryanastley,2012-04-22T09:30Z,"11PDG11- To do that, what you want is ""Preware"", which is the Palm version of 'rooting'. Allows you to 'overclock', 'underclock', and a bunch of other things. WebOS Doctor is for when you screw-up your phone, from doing the previously mentioned things. I haven't had to use it yet (knock on wood), but it's handy to have, if needed."

I downloaded the set and verified the md5 sums myself.

If you don't know what they are or what they do... Please don't mess with them and bonk your webOS device.

They are akin to a factory reset of the software on the phone. These old versions are very specific for carrier and model.

Nice torrent. ""Out of print"" material that might just save someone's phone. Kudos to you Anonymous. I got these to pass to a friend who needs them..."
