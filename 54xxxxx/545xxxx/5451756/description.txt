Palm recently pulled downloads of any older versions of webOS Doctor from their website.

This is a collection of all the webOS Doctors that I have downloaded.  Unfortunately, I only have the Sprint ones, so this won't work for the Pre Plus on Verizon, any of the other carriers, or on the Pixi or Pixi Plus.

That being said, apparently some people have wanted older versions in the past.

This includes:


1.1.0
1.2.0
1.2.1
1.3.1
1.3.5
1.3.5.1
1.4.0



Just one more thing I wanted to add to the description, feel free to check the MD5sums against what's listed on webOS-internals, to make sure it won't mess up your phone.
