Instal the game using the "Left 4 Dead 2 .exe " instaler

After instalation is complete extract the archived patch4.zip from the patches directory
and copy the extracted files into the game.
The addons are just a few weapon skins from fpsbanana site, optional to use, the readme in the folder must be readed.

Autoexec.cfg is the config file i use , its tweaked to optimize hitregistration
and decrease lag, if you wanna use it copy the file into "x:/Left 4 Dead 2/left4dead2/cfg/"
and replace the one allready there.

Enter the game and press:
F11 to load the server list (/oppenserverbrowser)
F10 to create server (your friends can connect to your server using "/connect <your server IP>")
F12 or ` to togle console on/off

I am not supporting this anymore, because i have a new and better client.
Don't worry, I will upload it here too.
A much better client that works on all the non steam servers in the world using the Seti master server database (about 2000 non steam private servers) :D 


the new better version can be found here:
