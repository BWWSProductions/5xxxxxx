maybe because i had a few decompression file errors?"
,genotm,2010-04-26T20:44Z,"I am not supporting this anymore, because i have a new and better client.
Don't worry, I will upload it here too.
A much better client that works on all the non steam servers in the world using the Seti master server database (about 2000 non steam private servers) :D 


the new better version can be found here:
