Thanks for the great torrent! I'll be listening to Fleetwood Mac for days :D"
,Spambolo,2010-11-06T10:05Z,"Brilliant, thanks SO much for the up, I've worn out several vinyl, cassette and CD copies of most of these over the years! :D"
,dherrera56,2011-01-02T01:49Z,Very Good Upload. Thanks! Buddy Boy!
,SmnkPnk,2011-04-29T00:27Z,"The album Fleetwood Mac of 1975 seems to be missing, good torrent otherwise - thanks!"
,Fenton_Beasley,2011-04-30T06:18Z,"The 1975 self titled album IS there, it's just mis-labelled as ""1968 - Fleetwood Mac""

There's no 1980 live album though.

Worth it just for the Blue Horizon 6 CD set"
,BaronVonWatermelon,2011-05-10T20:55Z,"So if the 1975 self titled album is mis-labelled as the 1968 album, then where is the 1968 self titled album..?

Too sloppy for me, I'm sorry to say."
