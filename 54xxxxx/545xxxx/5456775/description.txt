Multi-instrumentalist and composer, Prem Joshua â€“ pioneer extraordinaire in the field of World Fusion Music â€“ creates and explores forever new synthesis in sound, transporting the listener as he does beyond the borders of both East and West.
Drawing inspiration from the deep well of the ancient music traditions of the Indian sub-continent, while remaining constantly in touch with the pulse of contemporary Western music scene, over the years Joshua has continued to refine his awesome talent for fusion, creating a sound both distinctive and unique.
His music appeals so deeply because despite its contemporary feel, it still succeeds in keeping alive the wild â€˜let-goâ€™ and meditative silence of its cultural roots. This musical masala of Indian classical, jazz, funk, ethno and trance music is so masterly, yet playfully blended, that it has indeed a completely global appeal.
