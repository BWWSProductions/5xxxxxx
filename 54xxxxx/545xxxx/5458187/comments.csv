,Dfewer,2010-04-02T10:26Z,"As a caver, I find these movies hilarious.  They do get the correct feel for crawling in tight places, which is nice to see in a movie. As cave-ins/tunnel collapses  go, caves exist because they are the strongest of earth's natural structures.  I.E. Pour a mountain of dirt on your house and see if it survives.  Anyway, I've been in some deep, dark, and spooky places, and given the choice I'd gladly get torn apart by hideous creatures rather than have my light go out and slowly starve to death with the slow psychological torment of knowing my impending fate (although you have to be deep down in a remote area to die of dehydration before rescue arrives).
