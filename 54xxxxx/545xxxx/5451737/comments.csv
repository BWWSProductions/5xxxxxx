According to the Preface:
""This second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary amalgamates the text of the first edition, published in twelve volumes in 1933, the Supplement, published in four volumes between 1972 and 1986, and approximately five thousand new words, or new senses of existing words, which have gained currency since the relevant volume of the Supplement was published. """

,freeholay,2011-01-12T08:39Z,Makes absolutely no sense... OED and it's Thesaurus comes installed on every mac an planet earth today... is this somehow different???
,chapter1,2011-02-04T20:21Z,thank u very much dear.
,papapapapapa67,2011-08-19T05:49Z,"@freeholay The OED comes pre-installed on precised zero Macs on planet Earth. What does come with them is the Oxford Dictionary of English, a completely different (and much smaller) dictionary."
