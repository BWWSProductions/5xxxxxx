,Apocangel,2010-03-25T05:37Z,Is this and Upscale?
,justin131,2010-03-25T06:19Z,"@Apocangel

Did you read the description? It clearly states the source is a bluray. So no, it is not an upscale."

,Apocangel,2010-03-25T13:39Z,"@justin131 Dude you really need eyeglasses if you can not read the description. It CLEARLY says NOTHING ABOUT THE SOURCE. 

Only place it says its BluRay is the name of the torrent and those are never to be trusted. 

There are WAY too many people claiming that their upscales are BluRay rips. 

Only thing that might make it a real BluRay rip is that it was uploaded by aoloffline (VIP).

Either way it doesn't matter anymore, Ive already downloaded it and im seeding so w/e.

,Porna420,2010-03-27T05:50Z,"lol like the username aoloffline. cuz, in my mind, aol is basically GONE!  w00t w00t.  oh, btw, good upload, the name says BluRay, so its probably a bluray rip imho. especially if its playing the video at about 6mbps."

,KickassWashingMachine,2010-06-10T17:09Z,"This 720p ""ALLiANCE"" rip is definitely the best of the rips out there that I've tried.

I also tried the 720p ""Alex"" version, the 720p ""ViSiON"" version and the 1080p ""LTT"" version, and the ""ALLiANCE"" one has the least amount of artifacts of them all. All of them, however suffer from a bad luma range (blacks not properly black) (except it's not so bad in the ""Alex"" version, but that's not very good looking anyway).

It's clear from testing these releases, that it's a very difficult source to encode (I'm betting the original looks pretty bad, too), but my money is on the ALLiANCE one, for sure. Don't bother with the 1080p LTT version, and don't settle for the other 720p versions.

,totenkopf1891,2010-06-18T19:35Z,Boring as fuck... Impossible to watch all of it... 
,JokerEcho,2010-09-19T07:29Z,"well i can see you guys dont know about the MKV file. well every time i download one of these... its a Miro Vidio... go to www.getmiro.com one of the best free downloads ever.... watch any online video ever made and some movies... all for free all streaming well anyways, when you download this you can watch the movies of the mkv file on this... i have been able to everytime without any problems... but it is true... you cant stream it to the xbox or ps3."
,BuckNaked69,2010-10-11T11:52Z,"@ JokerEcho
Use TsMuxer, it takes about 4 min to turn the mkv into m2ts which streams beautifully to a PS3.  Or, put the m2ts on a DVD or flash drive and throw it in the playstation.  Pretty simple."

,DaSqurlyOne,2012-07-15T18:55Z,"This was a great movie.  Have yet to see the quality but I trust the comments and the green skull. If you are looking to burn the movie onto a disc that will work on the PS3, XBOX, of DVD player of any sort, ConvertXtoDVD(http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6386910/ConvertXtoDVD_v4.1.19.365___Serials_%5BChattChitto_RG%5D) is, in my opinion, the easiest program to use."
