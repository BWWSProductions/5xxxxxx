Try editing your torrent, copy paste this into the image field

and save your changes...
It would work for any of the future and past Heartland torrents you have posted
People love pretty pictures, and it should help people distinguish between this show and the other heartland...

Thanks for posting the show, you're the only source. "

Thank you so much. That is awesome. I'll put that on all my Heartland eps (and then figure out how to put it on my other shows).

Thanks again for your help."
[T],KnifemakerC,2010-03-29T05:56Z,"Thanks for your work posting all of the Heartland episodes

I'm glad you like it, It took me a very long time of fiddling about to learn how to get the images to work.

For each time you want a new photo.

Save a photo you want to use to your computer.
If it is too large a file size, it will just stall and not work

Click the link on the bottom of the TPB page ""BayImg""  which is 

http://bayimg.com/

Click the browse button to find your saved photo

Type in a removal code (a password that you want to use)

Click ""Settings""

check the box ""Resize to""

Select the dropdown ""300 x 300  TPB...""

Click upload

Copy paste that code to keep it safe

just use the last part of that code when posting a torrent
