"Purple Haze" is a song written in 1966 and recorded in 1967 by 
The Jimi Hendrix Experience and released as a single (Hendrixs 
second) in both the United Kingdom and the United States. 

It appeared on the US release of their 1967 album Are You Experienced
and on subsequent re-releases of the album. 
Purple Haze" has become one of the "archetypical psychedelic drug 
songs of the sixties"and is often cited as one of Jimi Hendrixs 
greatest songs, and for many is his signature song.

David Lee Roth (born October 10, 1955) is an American rock vocalist,
songwriter, actor, author, and former radio personality, best known 
as the original and current lead singer of Van Halen. 

In addition to his work with Van Halen, Roth is a successful solo 
artist, having released several platinum and gold solo albums, 
sometimes referred to as Diamond Dave, Roth rejoined Van Halen in 
2007 for a North American tour that became the highest grossing tour 
in the band's history.

Manfred Mann were a British beat, rhythm and blues and pop band of 
the 1960s, named after their South African keyboard player and 
founder who later led the successful 1970s group Manfred Manns Earth 
Band.

Status Quo are a british rock band with strong boogie line. 
The group was founded by bassist Alan Lancaster and guitarist Francis
Rossi in 1962, they began as a rock and roll freakbeat band called 
The Spectres.
 
By 1967, with very little commercial success, they discovered 
psychedelia and changed their name to Traffic (later Traffic Jam, to 
avoid confusion with Steve Winwoods Traffic.) 

Twisted Sister is an American heavy metal band from New York City, 
their most well-known hits include "Were Not Gonna Take It" and 
"I Wanna Rock", both popularized in the USA by regular airplay on
MTV tv channel in the 1980s.
 
Many of the band's songs explore themes of parent vs. child conflicts
and criticisms of the educational system.

Scoring some 23 UK top 40 singles and 17 UK top 40 albums to date in 
a career spanning five decades, the Stranglers are the longest-surviving 
and most "continuously successful" band to have originated in the UK punk 
scene of the mid to late 1970s.
. 
Beginning life as the Guildford Stranglers on 11 September 1974 in Guildford, 
Surrey, they originally built a following within the mid-70s pub rock scene. 

"Smoke on the Water" was included on Machine Head, which was released in 
early 1972, but was not released as a single until a year later, in May 1973. 
The band members have said that they did not expect the song to be a hit, 
but the single reached number 4 on the Billboard pop singles chart in the 
United States during the summer of 1973, number 2 on the Canadian RPM charts, 
and it propelled the album to the top 10.
 
Live performance of the tune, featuring extended interplay between Blackmores 
guitar and Jon Lords Hammond organ would become a centerpiece of Deep Purples 
live shows, and a version of the song from the live album Made in Japan became a minor hit on its own later on in 1973.
