This is a 4 part series looking at the 20th century history of once legal drugs and how they came to be illegal. The politics behind the changes are shown for the most part. The economic threat hemp posed to the cotton, wood pulp, and paper industries is ignored as is the economic threat to the individuals who ran those industries. The series shows the changing public attitude for and against these drugs. The free use of these drugs was once considered a Constitutional right of the American citizen. The racism behind making the drugs illegal is also shown.

I have reconstituted this torrent by using the best files of each of the 4 episodes that I could find on the web. Two files are divx and 2 are xvid. There are 2 text files that give a little background information also. These videos make learning history interesting.

Enjoy!

P.S. You will also find out how the government made machine gun ownership illegal.
