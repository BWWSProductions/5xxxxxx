    Catch the eggs - feed the fox!                                        
                                                                          
    From the same developer who brought you Airport Madness and Bird      
    Reflex comes Alex the Fox. With amazing graphics and infinite         
    polished gameplay you'll have hours of fun!                           
    It's an idyllic countryside evening with crickets and owls echoing    
    in the fields. Can anything disturb this beautiful night?             
    Unfortunately Yes! There is something odd going on in the             
    neighborhood... Alex is a good boy, but because of his hunger he's    
    forced to be the egg thief. He's up to his foxy foray but he has      
    one slight problem. It's the evening of the Full Moon and he's        
    exposed to the weird stares of the curious villagers. As soon as      
    they spot him, they're afoot and the mess begins. Pots, pans,         
    pumpkins, scissors, everything they reach they throw on poor Alex..   
    . Help Alex to avoid falling objects and catch enough eggs to feed    
    himself. Go through as many levels as you can, while the situation    
    complicates and quickens more and more. Then share your success       
    with your friends on Facebook and Twitter through the OpenFeint       
    integration. GAME PLAY:  First 5 levels: slow for training  Every   
    3rd level: new falling object  Every 5th level: new diamond score    
     Achievements: bonus, score & level  Speed: slow, then faster       
    over time  Highest speed: level 150 - very hard :-)
