,akito76,2010-03-22T21:46Z,"Mine dose play, but picture is slow a behind the sound. anybody who knows what can be done??"
,slicknick610,2010-03-22T23:57Z,Wow all these problems. I have not changed anything since the Daytona round. The videos play fine on my desktop and laptop.
,debz199,2010-03-23T00:02Z,I couldn't get them to play either so i used WINavi video converter and changed it to an avi file and now they play perfect.
,mak621,2010-03-23T01:09Z,"debz199, good idea!  when i use kmplayer the video seems to slow down which puts the audio outta sync.  i used windows media player in which the av is ok but the picture gets some weird pixelations.  vlc does the same.  nero showtime seriously lags.  still great quality video, thanx, ive been dl'n u all season!"
,jeffro30,2010-03-23T02:23Z,"Hey listen everybody I just Installed the K-Lite_Codec_Pack_583_Full and it worsks flawless, hope it works for everyone

I use a flash drive into my lg tv , has most codecs installed i, but  not the  codec to watch slicks new hd vids, my old dvd player also has codecs installed but doesnt read the file also.

,slicknick610,2010-03-23T15:18Z,I tried playing my Dallas torrent again on my laptop with a dual core processor. Everyone was right the lag kicks in after a minute. It plays fine on my xbox 360 and desktop with a quad core processor. I will try to post another one with a resolution of 960x540. I will probably have the 450 class up by the tommorow morning 8am EST. 
,iveztheman,2010-03-23T20:39Z,use SHARK 007 codecs an play all type of files on windows media plaer with no problem and thank slick
