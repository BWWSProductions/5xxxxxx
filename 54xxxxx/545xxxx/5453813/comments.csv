,bhailog,2010-03-22T15:33Z,excellent work dude!!!!!!
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-22T16:00Z,"@hopparty: Long ago I've dropped FGuy and It's always sunny in Philadelphia for the same reason - both shows never went HDTV (still 4/3 old TV aspect ratio for FG and just old HighResolution for It's always sunny)...

However, I have last FGuy in HR, but - I repeat - it's not HDTV, it is High Resolution version (better than PDTV XviD) but you must know that 4:3 screen make video unplayable on iPod & clones (16/10 display AR).

I CAN add black bars on both sides to make it 16:9-10 and playable on newer WideScreens or iPods - OR - up the ""normal"" untouched one with 4:3 aspect ratio which looks great on 4:3 TV sets and normal PC monitors.

As I wrote this, such 4:3 is finished, but hence we have time till after the upping of Breaking Bad we could ""negotiate"" another version.

What's gonna be?"
,lilars26,2010-03-22T16:16Z,"You were right 20/40.This show is a definate keeper.I really enjoyed the 1st episode and the series will be enjoyed by generations to come.I will thank you now and download later.
Thank You."
,hopparty,2010-03-22T16:18Z,"@ 2040 i watch everything of urs on comp screens only and its awesume...abt FGuy i was thinking doesnt adding black bars makes the video look streched?but still i would lik to see....
thanks for replying man..."
,hopparty,2010-03-22T16:28Z,@2040 also wat other versions are there? act i hav no knowledge about encodin frame size n all...i will take watever you give...better add those black bars so that its also useful for people with ipods etc...
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-22T17:26Z,"@hopparty: LOL no! Black bars prevents stretching. Black-bars are added left and right, not on top and bottom.

People who have WideScreen TVs or 16/9 monitors know how, for example, old VHS tape recordings look squashed on new, wider screens if they doesn't manually change aspect ratio of screen.

But - black bars are just that - blank, empty space on screen which doesn't do anything but fit the frame size of 4/3 on today's 16/9. Picture (frame with actual content) is the same as it was, but appears as smaller 'cause in fact the percentage of used screen - IS smaller.

Now you can ""see and feel"" why I wont torture myself with such things, I have no time for that, for ""fixing"" something for maybe 10-12 people. 

However, I would up the FGuy later tonight, as promised, but expect not the same week after week. IF I could find the time AND when situation arise, I would up the FGuy in the future. Please, do not remind me next week."

re: your question in [Edge of Darkness]:
""Pacific"" Pt.2; should be a 360p or normal, small-sized?

My vote is for 360p (450MB) size as this is one of those shows that NEEDS the extra definition.

I fully appreciate that it is a big file BUT the fans of this show will appreciate it.
May take longer and use more download allowance BUT this show is worth it.
Also, there are only 10 episodes!

Just my thoughts.

Cheers

[V],twentyforty,2010-03-23T06:30Z,"To maintain technical compatibility with all newly produced TV sets, computer monitors and displays of mobile devices TV shows must be Wide-Screen. Unfortunately WS implies HD more than anything - but in turn, for the moment, such move is really expensive and production companies try to delay it as much they can. 
However, few years from now, maybe a decade, today's HDTV would be existing standard.

So... nobody needs all shows to be High-Def, of course not, but we spoke about compatibility with screens of different devices and that's all---"
