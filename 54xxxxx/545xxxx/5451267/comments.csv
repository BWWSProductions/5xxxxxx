,XYTPBAY,2011-11-11T12:26Z,"thanks cotta , 
this is the best nfs carbon rip on the internet

for those who are having problems -
1. open .exe file and exract to another folder
2. open the extracted folder and extract it to another drive
3. go to that folder and run install.exe 
4. wait for 2-3 minutes 
5. play through nfsc.exe

hope it helps
thanks"
