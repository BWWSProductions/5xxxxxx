I'M FED UP OF GUYS UPLOADING FLAC FILES MAKING PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IT'S A GOOD QUALITY. I CAN CONVERT AN MP3 FILE INTO FLAC TOO, BUT THAT'S NOT A GOOD QUALITY FILE!"
[T],kimeesteres,2010-04-06T13:40Z,"I did not remaster this; I uploaded it. The sound quality of this version of the 1988 demo is crystal clear, however, and is much better than other versions I've heard. Did phinot actually listen to this? Does anyone have any audio complaints with this download?"
,sucksucker,2010-09-21T20:38Z,"The audio sounds excellent.
This wasn't transcoded from mp3.  Anyone can see from the frequency spectrum that this is lossless.

phinot, get a clue.   
There are 2 remasters of Purest Feeling, one was remastered by Kirby, the other by thir13en
(I personally prefer thir13en version)"
,benakenobi,2011-04-24T12:39Z,"anyone has a link to unmodified copy instead of these ""remasters""?"
[T],kimeesteres,2011-04-26T08:16Z,"To benakenobi -- I did find an MP3 version here on Pirate Bay. I can't vouch for its quality, but here's the link for you:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6055515/
I hope this helps you out! :)"
,benakenobi,2011-10-19T21:34Z,"thank you but mp3 i found sometime before, don't get me wrong: while remasters add better bass i just want to store a copy of unaltered recording :)"
[T],kimeesteres,2011-11-14T08:30Z,"benakenobi -- The best thing I can suggest is to go to the nin.com site, and post your request on the forum. Surely there must some collector out there with an unaltered original master of PF. 
If you should happen to find it, please let me and everyone else know! "
