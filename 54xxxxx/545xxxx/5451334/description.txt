A classic slice of Brit pop and rock history, 16 Nov 2005 

A 3CD set full of classic hits spanning 45 years from the UKs biggest 
selling singles artist Cliff Richard.

Its inevitable when you've had a career spanning the decades like
Sir Cliff Richard but this is the best to date its bang up to date 
featuring the hits from the most recent album Somethings Goin On. 

For anyone with a casual interest in Cliff this is the hits album to get
hold of, if your more of a serious fan the Singles Collection is more 
definitive if not more up to date.

Playing the first song on the album Move It which John Lennon hailed as 
the most influential British record ever made and the last hit What Car?
(which got rave reviews and a top 20 chart placing ) back to back- it 
sounds like Cliff has come full circle and his voice and enthusiasm is
as fresh today as it was when he first started out. 

Having heard the more recent slightly rushed live versions of Living Doll 
however its good to go back and rediscover the original recording which 
has an effortless vocal the most laid back mellowist sound you are ever 
likely to hear which is complimented by the classic guitar solo from 
Hank Marvin. 

Theres some classic cuts Tavelling Light, Im Looking Out the window and 
Itll Be Me are like the best blues pop recordings you never heard. 
Then theres the classic shadows sound paving the way for the Beatles and 
the bands that followed. 

On the Beach, Blue Turns to Grey ( a slice of the Rolling Stones), 
Time Drags By, In The Country ( recently ripped off by Belle & Sebastian) 
are the most joyous Britpop anthems your ever likely to hear and they 
showcase Cliff and the Shadows at their tightest and very best. 

Towards the end of the 60s the influences had changed new solo singers 
had emerged like Tom Jones and Englebert and Cliff followed in that 
direction from All My Love through to Big Ship. 

During this period Cliff voice sounded deep and rich and he wasnt afraid 
to throw himself into the songs with uninhibited gusto.
 
When it looked like Cliff was floundering and loosing his way it all kicked 
off again when he teamed up with producer Bruce Welch ( of the Shadows) and
Devil Woman and Miss You Nights put him on the right track for the years 
that followed. 

Theres some great tracks on this set especially to those who think Cliff is 
just about Christmas singles.
 
This is a slice of Brit pop history and great songs from every decade - 
everyone should have a Cliff Richard album in thier collection and if they 
havent got one they should get this - its got nearly everything they need to 
hear and a little more besides.
