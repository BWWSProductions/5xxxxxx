,Magpie13,2010-03-22T21:40Z,"I've not seen this version, but I just watched this the other week and it is a MAMMOTH EPIC!  The best frontal assault of ANY movie I have ever seen! (in part 2)  John Woo does the business in this one, and I highly recommend it to medieval war movie lovers... Mythical Being characters, Ridiculously realistic filming in parts, and just bloody brilliant... The frontal assault makes The Two Towers look pants... :)  hope its a good download everyone cos this film deserves it!"

,random-critic,2010-03-29T22:25Z,"First time, asking for help...

using uTorrent I can't get the pre-window to open so I can view and deselect some files. (No matter what combination of check boxes I do in Preferences.) Anyone experiencing the same thing?

I would like to see the files first.... Again...

Thanks to any helpers!"

--Click on Preferences (it's the cog next to the arrows on the toolbar). 
--Look for UI Settings, then under ""When Adding Torrents"".
--Check the box next to ""Show a window...""

That should do the trick; good luck."
,Flopis,2010-04-01T06:05Z,"I just saw this movie. It has among the best medieval war scenes I have ever seen. The acting is good. It is sad to see that English speaking war movie lovers are missing on this one!
Thanks, extremezon!"
,random-critic,2010-04-08T19:06Z,"@ Fabe-O:

Hey thanks for the reply!!!
...
Unfortunately those damn check boxes do precisely bupkis for me.
Ah well maybe it will resolve itself when I upgrade.

Peace out."
