,KnightOwl70,2010-03-24T06:48Z,There is a Repack floating around.  Try it instead.
,sonofdog,2010-03-24T16:50Z,yeah this is way outa sync and I couldn't fix it. Gonna have to dl another.
,Mercyflush64,2010-03-24T17:25Z,Out of sync for me as well. Reminded me of the old Godzilla movies. And oddly enough there has been no other HQ copies of this episode posted.
,alexapirot32,2010-03-26T18:35Z,Same thing here.
,lilpeyo,2010-06-18T12:26Z,I've tried to re-sync sound using MkvMergeGUI (linux) but problem doesn't stand there. If you change FPS video track to 23.976792 it would be synced but the last 4 min are soundless
