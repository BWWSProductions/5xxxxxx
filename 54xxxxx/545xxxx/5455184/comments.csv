@ .3kb/sec we won't get this finished for weeks!
I have 0.656 share ratio and only 51.3% complete.
I appreciate your work getting this up, and I wish people would continue to seed."

,Charles_U_Farley,2010-04-02T04:22Z,"Where is this ""ReadMe"" you mention?  Package is not a .rar file, comes as a folder with just the .iso and an MSInfo file that contains no instructions for installation."
,Charles_U_Farley,2010-04-02T04:27Z,Nevermind... I'm a dunce.  It's IN the .iso.
[V],BLACKTROY,2010-04-02T17:05Z,Charles_U_Farley ---- the MSInfo is also know as info file. lol lol .to open the MSInfo. right click on the msinfo and choose notepad to open. you will be able to read the content in it

,Jettwinlock,2010-04-15T00:12Z,"Does anyone have a problem loading new content.  All I keep getting is I need adobe flash player which I have, and just redownloaded it and nothing seems to change.

I can't get to any new figures or anything that I have don't know what the problem is."
,orca1966,2010-04-26T20:06Z,Thanks a lot!
,hammer4hire,2010-04-28T21:17Z,"Hey Blacktroy - Thx for the awesome upload - It work beautifully on Windows 7 and I still have Poser 8 installed as well.

@ Jettwinlock - I had the same problem with the libraries function not showing up and it was Flash as well. On W7 the panel where the libraries are supposed to show up, there was an error message saying my version of Flash was incorrect - it had links to a Flash uninstaller and the correct Flash installer from Adobe ...

If I can find the links to Adobe again I will post them here.

Until then all I can recommend is searching Smith Micro's website and forums for an answer...

Thx again Blacktroy, +1 for the upload!"
,Ra1111111111000,2010-05-14T00:34Z,"Thanks! seems to be working great - not crashing as much as poser pro 2009 (in windows 7 64 bit). 

Just one question: is it safe to use the library - I see that when it opens through adobe air it tries to connect to the internet - if I deny it the library doesn't work and it say an error if I allow it it works and opens. But I am worried to use it now so what do you think?"
,Ra1111111111000,2010-05-14T23:52Z,Ah I see the address is a loop back one: 127.0.0.1 so its only checking my Pc so I guess its fine?

,josh1003,2011-03-07T09:42Z,"@mickr
Just turn off your net and fill up the required fields then you're good to go. I dunno about turning it on afterwards. If I don't post anything back, then it's probably fine to turn on your net after submitting fields"

Edit:
Everytime I try something with the library, it crashes. Any hints?"
,Trisste,2011-03-13T12:18Z,"Installation and entering serial went without any problems, progrm works fine, but I have a problem with installing additional characters. Every time I run installation program I get this message ""when used with poser TM ""Victoria 4.2 Base"" must be installed to the same directoryas the application executable, due to restrictions on support file locations. Please select the directory that contains your Poser executable.""
So I select folder with PoserPro.exe but I get same message again and again."
,g1zm02k,2011-03-28T02:36Z,"@Trisste,

GO to your Poser dir and copy the 'PoserPro.exe' twice. Rename one to 'Poser.exe' and the other to 'Poser 8.exe'. No more problems.

* I created both as I can't remember which worked with what..."

,SumeklamKidd,2011-09-02T07:43Z,"NJM16, I had the same issue at first. There is a very small icon near the upper right of the application. Click on that. Just dismiss Adobe AIR (I don't trust it myself), and the libraries come up. POSER used to have a small tab on the far right, but that does not seem to be in the new POSER posted here."
,SumeklamKidd,2011-09-02T07:49Z,"BTW BLACKTROY, thanks for the torrent! Working great. 

Hey you all, when you install it  (or anything for that matter), disconnect from the Net, add the new application to your firewall manually, then uncheck the box so it is blocked (Windows 7). Later, you will be asked to okay connecting it to the Net via Windows dialog box: choose no. Never update,  or connect for help."
