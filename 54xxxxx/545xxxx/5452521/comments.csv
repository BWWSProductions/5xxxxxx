,bryanwood343,2010-03-22T05:37Z,I have done everything up to the DS screen. When I go to play the game a blue screen with Japenese writing shows up. I do not know what to do from there
,nox150690,2010-03-22T06:15Z,"ok , this means you need to change the type of nds cartridge backup media you are using, try FLASH 512Bytes, in the options menu."
,StormtrooperZ,2010-03-22T10:38Z,"Should we patch the English version or the Japanese version of these games? It's not mentioned in your readme nor is it added in the download file...

I hope this patch fixes the 24-events crashes."
,nox150690,2010-03-22T11:01Z,I used the Rom Decrypter on the USA version of Soul Silver and Heart Gold. I have not tested any of these patches with the Japanese versions.
,tocnoupodne,2010-03-22T12:47Z,"please help 
when I run encrypter it says ''windows can't open this file'' (for Patchengine.da1) and asks me to select a program to open this file"
,nox150690,2010-03-22T15:26Z,"Make sure that you have Unzipped the Rom Decrypter before trying to use it. Also make sure your selecting the eNdyptS Advanced File, and not the Dat file. "

that's because he said it's for no$gba, read the description"
,nox150690,2010-03-27T01:05Z,"Please note that I have already uploaded an already cracked version of both games with the emulator, saving those who have not downloaded the game already the hassle of patching it. "
,nox150690,2010-04-05T09:28Z,"Good to hear that this is helping those who want to play. I have only experienced the saving issue once,  so I don't really know what causes it. I believe it may be that no gba is not creating the save file quick enough, or ""forgets"" to generate the file."
,nox150690,2010-04-05T09:30Z,"Damn, posted on the wrong torrent lool :D"
,argghhh,2010-05-05T06:49Z,It says it can't find the file. I'm clueless as to what to do :/
