This should fix the crashes that many people are having for the $gba emulator.(crack only no game)



unzip the Rom Decrypter and follow the instructions in the readme file. This also includes a few files ( I have not tried any of the others) that may help you with your emulator.
You may also experience crashes with this crack if u have the sound turned off.

-Extract firmware/bios files to no$gba folder
-Put ROM in encrypt folder
-Run encrypter
-Press 1

-Run no$gba and open the (now encrypted) ROM
-AS SOON AS THE FILE BOX CLOSES (while the screens are still white)
open the emulation options (F11) and change the option under
"Reset/Startup Entrypoint" to GBA BIOS. After hitting OK,
immediately reset the game (numpad *). If you did it right, you'll
see the DS menu as you would on a real DS. Play it normally from there.
If you reset too late, or use an unencrypted ROM, it will crash.

Make sure the save type is set to automatic (2.6a).

This should work with any $gba emulator.

You can also find an already patched version of both games that I have uploaded.

Hope this helps anyone who has had the same crashing issues I have had.
