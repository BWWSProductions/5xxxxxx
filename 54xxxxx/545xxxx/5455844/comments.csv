man!!!! good work
I have a request bro, if you could please do....

EYES WIDE SHUT in PS3 format

Please do that if possible in 1080p or even 720 would do.

thanks ever so much"
,jzaw,2010-03-23T18:50Z,"I love bricktophd's uploads 

and I acknowledge the rational for doing 4GB files

but it would be amazing if you could release them at 1080p in say 8, 10 or even 12GB ... they would really really benefit from the extra bit rates 

maybe have two torrents ... 4GB for those who want/need them and larger for those who arent limited to 4GB on their playback device and really want the extra quality 

keep up the good work 
THANKS!"

,swiftgate,2010-03-24T03:20Z,"hi Brick 
need your help if you could please
I have found this movie in 720 def

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5452027/Eyes_Wide_Shut_[BDRip-720p-Mkv-Ita_Ac3-Eng_Aac-Sub-Ita_eng][TNTV

But this movie is encoded in MKV with x264 video format but there are two audio streams in it. Italian language audio is in ac3 but the english audio stream is in aac audio. 

I want to convert this mkv to m2ts but the problem is that english audio is in aac format. And tsmuxer would'nt convert the audio. when I play that m2ts on ps3 its plays the video nicely but there is no audio as you know the ps3 supports only ac3

I don't know how to resolve this issue.... Any word of advice would be appreciated.

Thanks a ton"
[T],bricktophd,2010-03-24T05:05Z,thte ps3 does play aac audio make sure it is on in your audio  settings on the ps3. as for your problem i have never ran into that
