Step One is the debut album by British pop group Steps. It was released in the UK and Europe on September 14, 1998. The album charted at number two on UK Albums Chart upon its release. In 2000, the album was re-released in the US, containing songs from both Step One and its successor, Steptacular. The tracks "5, 6, 7, 8", "Last Thing on My Mind", "One for Sorrow", "Heartbeat" and "Better Best Forgotten" were released as the singles in UK. In 2000, the album was certified 8Ã— Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry for selling over 2.4 million copies in UK.  It is also considered to be one of the biggest-selling albums in United Kingdom by a band/group. The album contains some coversâ€”"Last Thing on My Mind" was originally released as a single by female pop group Bananarama, while "Love U More" was originally recorded by techno/house band Sunscreem. The Australian hidden track, "Tragedy", has also been released as a single, originally by popular trio, Bee Gees.

Amazon.co.uk Review By Charlie Porter - When he split from his 1980s buddies Stock and Aitken, those who loved pop feared that there would never be another record to come from pop svengali Pete Waterman. Then, out of the blue, came Steps, a five piece who were shockingly group-by-numbers for their bland first single (the aptly titled "5,6,7,8"). Then, with "Last Thing On My Mind", an immense, Abba-like paean to heart-break, the group became whole--an immense camp beast, whose songs kept giving to everyone from Teletubby toddlers to ageing old queens. That the band are singing Waterman's trademark open-sore teen ditties helps ("One For Sorrow"--can you bear the pain?), but what completes the brilliant package is the routines. Each song has an aerobic-like succession of weird hand poses and body-twists that should, if you're being good, be learnt by rote from their videos. But what the hell--come on and do some bad vogueing to this great, bad-but-cool pop.
