Duane Eddy, father of the solo popular guitar, is usually known for his twangy, rock'n'roll sound. Not so with this unusual album. Backed by lush strings and intimate chorale group, this haunting, dark and moody album was ripped from the original, rare RCA Dynagroove LP. Found today only in Europe, costing over $150, this album stands alone as one of the most unique sounds of the early 1960s. Those over 50 will especially enjoy it.
