,CommanderNZ,2010-03-24T08:51Z,"Generally I never have problems installing cracks, till now.

Installed the game to default location. (didn't install the EA download manager thing as I have read thats not needed)

Installed the crack, ran the new shortcut, & 2 CMD boxes come up, one vanishes right away the other one stays and says it's a server but nothing else happens... no game loads...

Will try another crack.

,Rogue426,2010-03-24T09:06Z,"Makes two of us sadly. 

Any advice on how to fix it?"
,buggyboy1,2010-03-24T09:37Z,"@ CommanderNZ and Rogue426 - Hmm that's really strange, cause it worked fine on all of the machines I tested it on. Could you guys please be a bit more specific as to your specifications and, most importantly, could you please make a screenshot at the very moment the disappearing black screen pops up. Might be frustrating to catch it on a print screen, but it will help me to identify the problem. You could upload it to BayIMG and post the link as a comment. This should work for most people though. Alternatively, you could try the first version of my automated patch. Thanks for sharing your concerns!"
,gopolog,2010-03-24T11:41Z,hey buggyboy i followed the instrutions installed this patch and and wen it finished it still asked for the key that comes with offical releases help plzzzzzzzzzz
,razielblack13,2010-03-24T13:14Z,"@gopolog You probably run the game once before cracking. Reinstall and try again, but first crack, and then run the game."
,pether,2010-03-24T13:33Z,Do you have any idea when the whole rerollthingie will be fixed?
,CommanderNZ,2010-03-24T14:29Z,"@buggyboy1

I am on windows XP SP3.

I managed to get it to work by launching the desktop shortcut then when the server window is open, then launching the ""RunCNC4.eng.bat"" inside the data folder. (finished the nod missions in a single run... what a crap game so far IMO)"
,dopey007,2010-03-24T17:05Z,What the hell i still must fill in my ea account
,gopolog,2010-03-24T18:33Z,razielblack13 firs time doing this normally jst buy so do i have to do it offline or online also do i do install then crack or crack then install cheers 
,dopey007,2010-03-24T19:00Z,stupid question but where do i put the Resources map....? : (
,gopolog,2010-03-24T19:03Z,this crack dosent work all i get is the same as the other people have commented 2 black screens cum up 1 diseperes and 1 stays then nothing happens also bad spelling i no
,gopolog,2010-03-24T19:26Z,also tried your other crack that dosent seem to be working either but thanks anyway
,dopey007,2010-03-24T19:27Z,"no the game starts perfect no problem so far, get a nice intro what take place in Manchester but after that i have to fill in my ea account and password i cant pass that shit.... so any one any suggestions... i installed en reinstalled the game 10 times to rule out a couple things..."
,gopolog,2010-03-24T20:15Z,for all the hassle this has been it would off been better jst to buy this lol
,buggyboy1,2010-03-24T20:20Z,"@ CommanderNZ - Hmm, so the batch file refuses to run. Could you please make a print screen the instant the 2nd console window pops up. Then please paste it in paint and tell me what it says.  I would be most grateful, cause it's really hard to identify the problem without having a clue where to look at. I don't like the game either. It's short, the actors are abysmally bad and it's not even close to a Command & Conquer game. I stopped after a few GDI missions. For me this is more about finding a one-click solution to EA's new security method than anything else."
,buggyboy1,2010-03-24T20:22Z,"@ dopey007 - Has to be your firewall, antivirus or something else blocking access to your local IP-Address. Allow access and everything should work just fine. Thanks for the feedback!"
,buggyboy1,2010-03-24T20:23Z,"@ dopey007 - You don't move the resources folder. It contains the resources for the Patch.exe file, so no need to move any of those files yourself."
,Crgwal,2010-03-24T20:44Z,"ok so, still not getting anywere.

i take it this patch is suppose to take like 1 sec to load and patch?

,Crgwal,2010-03-24T20:45Z,"oh and i downloaded the patch 4 times, so i guess its not a corrupt download"
,Crgwal,2010-03-24T20:48Z,"lol, u just read my screenshot...

i have problems wenn i click the offline patch on my desktop then a black window appears and i think tries to open the game but my whole desktop begins to flicker for like a min then a window appears witch says this 

((Please make sure you have Direct X 9.0 or higher installed. Also verify that your video card meets the minimum requirements, and that you do not have hardware acceleration disabled in the Display control panel.))

plzzz help me i wanna play this game so much plzzz"
,damsco32,2010-03-24T22:30Z,"hey buggyboy1

,CommanderNZ,2010-03-25T06:44Z,"@ buggyboy1

I finally managed to get it shot of it.
http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/8100/cmderror.jpg

"" 'C:\Program' is not recognized an an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. ""

This may have something to do with how XP and Win7 call cmd prompts?

Any how, as I said and others should do with this issue for the time being is run the new shortcut on the desktop (You really should rename it buggyboy1 as it's the name of the original shortcut and will confuse people)

The first CMD screen will come up and vanish but then the C&C 4 Server Emulator window should still open and stay.

Leave that window open and then run the ""RunCNC4.eng.bat"" inside the data folder.

You might have to wait 30 seconds (I did) before it will start. If you are still asked for login stuff you have either tried to launch the wrong file or you installed the crack wrong or you tired to launch the game when you installed it first with the crack."
,CommanderNZ,2010-03-25T06:48Z,"@ damsco32  
Yeah it sounds like you don't have DX installed right or you are using some ancient ATI driver as I have an ATI HD 3650 and worse specs than you and it runs fine for me."
,tomsons26,2010-03-25T08:02Z,tested on win xp SP3 go to control panel >administrative tools>services> and enable everything services that has connection to internet IP DNS and anything else that has connection to internet worked for me

tnx again"
,damsco32,2010-03-25T14:17Z,"it stil wont work i tried installing the new direct x but i already had it.
So what im a suppose to do know plz any 1 help me 
cuz my specs are good enough and my direct x is installed but it still says the same thing.
Plzzz help me"
,oOlowwOo,2010-03-25T22:05Z,"damso i had the same issue.

first it worked properly but after started the game for the second time the screen flickers and the directx error occurs.

it seems that we have some resolution problems in the options.ini in the users/roaming/c&c4 directory.

After i plugged my pc to my tv via hdmi, it worked fine.

then i simply deplugged it again and now i am able to play again...i haven't figured it out yet why exactly this is necessary...but i'm glad it works for the moment, try it, it may work for you too ;)"
,lastmanstanding,2010-03-27T05:31Z,wtf is this? THIS DOESNT WORK. Window pop up saying some server emulator and it just stays there. The worst part is this junk patch deleted a bunch of original files I found them in my recycling bin now I can only uninstall and try another carck. Thanks a lot azzhole.
,buggyboy1,2010-03-28T00:37Z,"@ CommanderNZ - Thanks a lot for the screenshot mate! I'll try my best to figure out what the problem is and will stop it from happening starting with the next version. There is something in there that corrupts the string. The problem starts with the first space in the file path so yea, I'll look into it."
,buggyboy1,2010-03-28T00:43Z,"@ damsco32 - This issue is definately not crack related. Try lowering the resolution, since I heard that worked for some people. Good luck!"
,buggyboy1,2010-03-28T00:46Z,"@ lastmanstanding - Why are people without any uploads always the meanest towards the actual content providers. It's a pitty that this doesn't work for you, sounds like you're one of the few lucky ones that got the file path bug. Congrats! This patch does not remove any game essential files, so quit the bullshit. You sir are a retard. Have a nice day!"
,theloston3,2010-03-31T05:12Z,"@ Buggyboy1
First of all, thanks for upload! Doesn't work for me, I'm trying the it again, this time going to reinstall the whole game then do only your crack,  tried the one from SPiRE, it load the game and the video then goes to the EA Login Screen like some other people are having problems with, tried disabling my firewall, doesn't help. So maybe a clean install of C&C4 with only this patch will work. Will reply again!"
,theloston3,2010-03-31T05:18Z,"Wow... I take that back, sorry for underestimating this crack. Worked fine without reinstall, but am going to see if it will work on clean install now though. Windows 7 Ultimate (x64)"
,theloston3,2010-03-31T07:12Z,"Okay I found this out myself and I think this is very much for the better. If you don't want the two windows to pop up before the game then you can do what I do. Navigate to your data folder for C&C4 (usually C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Command and Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight\Data) and create a shortcut for CNC4. Place the CNC4 - Shortcut on your desktop and rename it if you want. Now right click your new shortcut on your desktop and select properties. Then under the shortcut tab, enter this under Target.: 

""C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Command & Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight\Data\CNC4.exe"" -config ""..\CNC4_English.SkuDef"" -loginToken ""test@xmail.com|zzzz"" -persona ""Test""

or for user who installed in \Program Files (x86)\:

""C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Command & Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight\Data\CNC4.exe"" -config ""..\CNC4_English.SkuDef"" -loginToken ""test@xmail.com|zzzz"" -persona ""Test""
-------------------------------------
Do this AFTER applying this patch, it works fine.
-------------------------------------
You could actually just change the target from in the shortcut from this patch that was placed on your desktop to this but either way it will work."
,theloston3,2010-03-31T07:16Z,"@ buggyboy1:
I do not know why... but this patch only worked on my previous, non-clean version of C&C4 that I placed files from around 5 different cracks in, and they didn't work, but then the game worked when i did this. On the clean version that I just installed and patched it runs the game, video, C&C4 screen, but doesn't get to the main menu. By C&C4 screen is the picture of the guy and the plant and it says Command & Conquer Tiberian Conquest like in your uploaded pic."
,runekiller,2010-05-08T17:02Z,"Hi i need help when i click on cnc 4 icon on desktop after install of patch it launches just a black box with the text  
Command and Conquer 4 Server Emulator ver 0.1a by  KoriTama  
ut that was it the game dont starts and the black boxes rest there 
Need rly help pls"
,dANGER_boy,2010-05-21T11:21Z,"I give my vote +1 for this torrent.

At first I thought it was broken because launching the desktop shortcut would only bring up a window stating that the server emulator was running.  The game would not load.  However, navigating to the install directory of C&C 4, and then in the ""Data"" folder, I ran RunCNC4.eng.bat and everthing worked!  Awesome work!

It's sad that I have to crack my own game.  I bought this legally cause I'm a huge C&C fan but I hated EA for making it online only.  Thanks for this.  You've done more for me than EA ever did!"
,rsi,2010-05-23T11:46Z,"works fine, thanks !"
,Vegasbob,2010-06-26T18:17Z,"Well here's hoping this works for me. I got the game and crack from reloaded. But With McAfee I have no way to block CNC4.exe with the firewall but ALSO allow it to connect with 127.0.0.1. And even when I shut off McAfee firewall and used windows firewall to let it connect to ONLY 127.0.0.1 it still says it ""Unexpectedly disconnected from online services..."" Blah Blah Blah....so I am hoping this will at least let me play this piece of shit game. Fuck EA and the corporate shitholes. C&C was only a good game when Westwood Studios was in control over it. After EA bought them it all started going to shit and this is just more proof..."

make the same with persona, account folder and profile and will work ;)"
