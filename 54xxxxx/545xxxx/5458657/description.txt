--------------------------------------------
Command & Conquer 4 Crack v2.0 - BLACKTRONiC
--------------------------------------------


Explanation:
------------

- Run "Patch.exe" and follow the instructions.
- Start the game using the desktop shortcut.

NOTE: A new desktop shortcut will appear. Do not 
try to use the old one, cause it will not work.


Fixed Issues:
-------------

- The patching process no longer fails if host file 
is read only and/or hidden.

- Drastic decrease in file size. This patch is more
than twice as small as its predecessor. 

- Offline patch no longer requires write access to
the Windows registry.

- Game now bootable from a desktop shortcut instead
or a seperate launcher folder.

- People who use this crack no longer start with a
total of 1821 GDI Experience Points.

- Should work for a lot more people thanks to loads
of small bug fixes.


Known Issues:
-------------

- Progress jumps back to mission two after restart.

The emulator is an 0.1 alpha version, so I bet it's
going to get fixed real soon. I'll release a new
version of this application everytime a new emulator
comes out so stay tuned! Saving your progress at the
beginning of a new mission before closing the game
should work just fine until then.


Other Issues:
-------------

The following game issues are not crack related, so
please check out the official Command & Conquer 4
forum for tips on how to fix them.

- Playback problems with sound effects and voices.
- Black screen directly after the EA intro clip.


Clarifications:
---------------

It's normal that you will NOT gain any experience points 
from the first few missions since they are nothing but a 
short tutorial. This is not a bug.

It is not necessary to copy this patch to the Command &
Conquer 4 game directory. However, the file and folder 
structures have to be intact when you patch the game.

There is no need for the patch files to remain on your
PC once the procedure is finished, but please keep them
for seeding purposes. Thank you in advance!
