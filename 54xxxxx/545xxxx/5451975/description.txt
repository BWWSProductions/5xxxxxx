Cliff Richard 50th Anniversary 2008(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
____________________________________________________	


Over his amazing 50 + year career, Cliff Richard has carved an extraordinary niche for himself in British pop music.

He has notched up 14 number ones, with top ten hits in each of the last six decades and he has sold more singles in the UK than any other act.

Perhaps more impressive than his phenomenal chart success is the way Sir Cliff has steadfastly resisted a decadent, debauched lifestyle.

Where many a star has plunged into a substance or sex-fuelled abyss, Cliff has stayed true to his moral standard of living.

And that, he feels, is the explanation for his longevity in a business known for cut-throat competitiveness.Cliff, who became a committed Christian early in his career, has never married and refuses to discuss his sexuality.
