Song: No Time To Lose lyrics

Album : Run For Your Life

Every day I walk in shadows
And know not what it is I'm heading for
As the evening lies dying
.... lies near me sighing
.... we can never understand
We can now be like water
Rolling on to find our way.... game

No time to lose, no time to lose
No time to lose, no time to lose
Go with the flow, never let go
No time to lose...

There ain't no way to see forever
It's only day to day I'm living for
Like a wheel you keep me turning
It's your love inside me burning
Questions... flame
Will .... love remain ?
You can never understand
You can now be like water
Going on to find the way to ....
With the game .... the game
You know the game, what a game

No time to lose, no time to lose
No time to lose, no time to lose
Go with the flow, never let go
No time to lose...
