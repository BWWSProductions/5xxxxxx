A little historyâ€¦.
Macromedia, formerly an American graphics and web-development software house headquartered in San Francisco, California, produced such products as Macromedia Flash as well as Macromedia Dreamweaver. Its rival, Adobe Systems, acquired Macromedia on December 3, 2005 and as of 2009 controls the line of Macromedia products.
