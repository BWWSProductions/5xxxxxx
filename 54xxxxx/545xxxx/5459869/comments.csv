Get activated yourself smartass, or is reading that difficult?"

[V],thethingy,2010-04-01T08:40Z,"yes MR Hood i did use your patch for my combined package, credit should go to you, perhaps youll be passing comment on this user who uploads all of your stuff;

[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-01T18:29Z,"@ thethingy

No need to screw others who are not involved, and certainly no need to give me credits. More important is to be aware of certain codes among TPB VIPS. Anywhow, enjoy your AVS torrent and be happy."
[V],thethingy,2010-04-02T07:32Z,"spy v spy aka bitch v bitch, im sure a couple of virus total reports in the right place woul fix WordL , any how my torrent is not the same as this but if you have a look here youll see the avs is certanaly not unique;

seems the patched exe works on most versions as the md5 is the same"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-02T13:32Z,"@thethingy

You did reposted both of my AVS torrents as one torrent, no matter what you say.

And for your information: Cracks, patches, and keygens are different things. Go figure.


Please lets cut the crap here and use the forum if anyone wants to continue, but I'm done with this."
,Boadicca,2010-04-11T20:39Z,"My appreciation Mr H!  I Thank Jesus's donkey for smart boys like y'self, and hope you ignore the pea-brains here. :)"
[V],RobbingHood,2010-04-22T00:30Z,"@MovieMadness101

If people say a crack doesn't work usually it means that they don't know what to do and don't read, or because they don't want to use a crack. In that cause you'll been waiting for a long time, since AVS can only be activated online by the licenseholder. That's why there are cracks and patches."
,majorbum,2010-04-24T07:37Z,Works great. I decided to turn unplug from the internet and turn off my firewall this time. Make sure not to run the software (which is the default) at the end of installation -- make sure to copy the crack over the original file first. I made this mistake on the previous version and the software didn't work right. This worked to convert to the Sony Walkman -- just make sure to use the 320x240 or less quality so it'll play.

,Metatron3,2010-06-21T04:37Z,"Every AVS converter I download, including this one, gives me an ""EAccessViolation"" error when I try to run it. Before or after being cracked.

Can anyone help me?

I'm running Win7 x64.

Thanks for the upload.

,bokehjoe,2010-07-28T12:38Z,"RH: Mucho Appreciano Feliciano...  Seriously folks. I appreciate your effort and wise words. I takes a bit to take the time to write out your  words of wisdom if this wonderful world of piracy is to continue- and I pray that it does. After the good fight that these fine folks have waged- it would be a pity to see this *pearl* of a *url* go under because of A BUNCH OF FRIGGING RETARDS!  I am going to write a novella about a new superhero- *name withheld due to idea vampires*- who can jump in his *micro-BUS* and track down the little weasels who think they are safe behind their keyboards and 8cinematic8 sized monitor and spew forth their binary-bizarro-bitchiness, and the SH will EXPLODE into their mommy and daddys basement and beat the living crap out of them! or something like that. Maybe strap them in a 21st century version of a stockade that others that they have pissed off can take punches at them all day- that they have the pleasure of actually feeling. ***Watch for the HC coming to a bookseller near YOU!!***"
,ant36t,2010-08-08T06:17Z,"Excellent, works perfectly.

,dashivasss,2010-08-31T22:28Z,"Thank you very very much!!!!
