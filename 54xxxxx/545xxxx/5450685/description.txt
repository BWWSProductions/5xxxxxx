    Different missions of the campaign will take you into the game,       
    which will cure your boredom. You can practice your favorite          
    missions again and again to surprise friends with your incredible     
    high score. Now online global High Score included. Can you be at      
    the top of the world's leaderboards?                                  
                                                                          
    Arcade mode walks you through a series of levels, each one more       
    complex than the last. You have to tap a certain number of flies      
    on each level, and if you miss too many before reaching your quota    
    you lose and have to start over. Be wary, because if you              
    accidentally tap an empty spot on the screen the lifemeter on the     
    left will go down, and when it's empty the game is over.              
                                                                          
    Bonuses will help you pass through the missions. You can:             
    - frighten;                                                           
    - blind;                                                              
    - spray flies by finger movement;                                     
    - and decrease their speed.                                           
                                                                          
    Hungry spiders will help you in this hard game, you must feed it      
    sometime (it will double your points). But at the same time your      
    enemies can be faster, double their quantity and you can be           
    poisoned by beetles.                                                  
                                                                          
    Your highscores will be the truth reflection of your accuracy,        
    speed, reaction and ability to use bonuses. And of course your        
    insistence. Ready to fly? Let's tap tap with fly-flap!
