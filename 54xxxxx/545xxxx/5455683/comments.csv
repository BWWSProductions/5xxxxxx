Thanks again to bbforlife, the creator of this torrent"
,ideathproof,2010-06-04T19:03Z,"Thanks for this, I was going through the 220-602.pdf I found a few errors like Question 152 command to restart the printer spooler, which is net stop spooler, then net start spooler. It had net spooler restart which as the correct answer and no other answer was correct either. How reliable are these?"
,slava29,2011-06-01T04:52Z,I've been in desperate need of some extra questions for the A+ exam and couldn't find any. This is greatly appreciated. 
,jackching,2011-10-26T00:06Z,Are these actual questions from the actual tests or are they just similar questions?
,seether_fan1369,2012-06-23T20:56Z,"looks legit to me. TONS of questions to practice with, even though the exam itself is 100 questions "
