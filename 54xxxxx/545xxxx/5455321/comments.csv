,john rallus,2010-05-27T17:28Z,"many thanks to the Uploader and the Seeders!!!
do you know if it could work on an W7 x64? yes, i need this for an XP x86 machine, but i wonder if it could also be installed on an x64 computer?"
,maruwo,2010-09-13T23:37Z,"I installed in W7 64bit and it works good, I do have one problem with, what I think must be the graphic card and a refreshing problem. The ""mouse over"" function where you prehighlight data isn't working and there are problems with the tree to, I do have to rotate very often to see what I picked. I'm using a Invidea GTX graphic card in my laptop."
,reloordan,2010-09-17T19:48Z,"Many thanks to ULoader and seeders!
1) Installed on Win7 64bit, started with SPO 1st and did the .dll file replacement. Without loading, continue on with SP1 but installation failed.
2) Load up SP0 successfully, but no access to part design and all other features despite checking MD2 etc licensing options.
3) Had uninstalled the CAD currently.
Can maruwo or other pls advise? Been working with CATIA since R13, is been a dream to be able to try out other capable features of this CAD program. "
,maruwo,2010-09-18T20:47Z,"I downloaded this version
DSS.CATIA P2 V5R20 GA x64
burned the data to a real DVD (this should not make a difference). Installed the Catia copied the JS0GROUP.dll into the right dir (there is a file you have to overwrite) Started catia enabled all licenses in options and restarted the system
Everything works fine exept I have a refresh or double buffering problem with my Invidia GTX craphics card and I'm looking to get the help files."
,reloordan,2010-09-19T06:41Z,"@maruwo
Noted. Started to re-download x64 version and will seed whenever i can. Thanks.

Will try it out with my Nvidia GeForce GT335M graphics card on my lappie and see whether will have any problems. Thanks "
,Montan,2010-10-19T16:59Z,"I have got some problems and I really appreciate if anyone can help me. I have done the following:
1) Installed the Catia software (Windows 7)
2) Extacted the JS0GROUP.dll file from the ISO program (winISO)

But still there's no licences to activate. Am I missing something? Has anyone gut a clue how to solve this issue. (Feeling a bit retarded right now) "
,maruwo,2010-10-26T23:52Z,"To get to the licensing
Select Tool
than Options...
select General at the left side
and the 4th tab is licensing
now you select from ADD to WS1 everyone
that's it"
,maruwo,2010-10-26T23:53Z,"The licenses are a little bit hidden
select Tools / Options... 
inside the option menu go to General and the 4th tab is the licensing
now you select from ADD to WW1 or so everything"
