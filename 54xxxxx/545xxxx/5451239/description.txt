A challenge as old as the Orient rises up before you. Will you accept this test of your mind and spirit or turn and run? On the surface, the task is simple: Clear a board of colored runes by creating matches of three or more stones. As you progress, however, the puzzles will become harder and the obstacles more cunning. But don't give in to fear, as the dragon offers his help to those who persist. Only then, as he dazzles your eyes with his fiery displays, will you understand the path you are walking is one of enlightenment.
