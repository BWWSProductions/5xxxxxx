    Raymond uses two wonderfully seasonal ingredients -        
    game and mushrooms. His first recipe is delicate cep      
    mushroom tortellini made using fresh pasta. He follows   
    this up with a French version of a pasty called           
    pithivier, filled with a rich mix of pheasant,             
    chestnuts and dried fruits. Next is the simplest          
    fricassee of wild mushrooms with herbs and croutons      
    cooked in the company of restaurant maintenance manager   
    Steve Truman. For the finale, a salt crust baked pigeon    
    uncovers a technique perfect for cooking game and         
    poultry. Along the way, Raymond and Steve join a shoot   
    in Perthshire and go mushroom hunting in the Scottish     
    woodlands.
