Faulty Intelligence
The catch-all phrase for the Bush years. These fifteen tuneful lampoons take on the neo-con nitwits and evangelical nutcases whose "Faulty Intelligence" has led us to war in Iraq and inflamed the Culture and Class Wars. Highlights include a lesson in "Creation Science 101," the bawk-along "Chickenhawk" and a plantive plea to "Abstain With Me." Also, new recordings of Zimmerman classics, "My Conservative Girlfriend" and "Defenders of Marriage."
