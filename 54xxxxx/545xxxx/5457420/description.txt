This is the edited version of this concert, with no announcements, little or no applause and minor defects in the recording repaired so far as possible. Each part of the concert is archived within the overall archive file and consists of a separate flac file for each work/movement. If you want announcements etc., you will need the unedited version, but there will be some minor blemishes in that which you may like to edit yourself. This version is the one for most people who just want the performances.
