SYNOPSIS:
Before The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries established him as one of the great masters of cinema, Ingmar Bergman created a series of devastating but less well-known psychological character studies, marked by intricate, layered narratives, gritty environments, and haunting visuals. These early films, which show the stirrings of the genius to come, remain the hidden treasures of a European cinema on the cusp of a golden age.

TORMENT
ALF SJÃ–BERG, 1944 - 101 minutes
Ingmar Bergmanâ€™s first produced screenplay was for the great Swedish filmmaker Alf SjÃ¶bergâ€™s Torment, a dark coming-of-age drama about a boarding-school senior, Widgren, terrorized by his sadistic Latin teacher. When Widgren falls for a troubled local girl, Bertha, he finds himself caught up even further in a web of emotional mind games.

CRISIS
INGMAR BERGMAN, 1946 - 93 minutes
In Ingmar Bergmanâ€™s feature directing debut, urban beauty-shop proprietress Miss Jenny arrives in an idyllic rural town one morning to whisk away her eighteen-year-old daughter, Nelly, whom she abandoned as a child, from the loving woman who has raised her. Once in Stockholm, Nelly receives a crash course in adult corruption and wrenching heartbreak.

PORT OF CALL
INGMAR BERGMAN, 1948 - 97 minutes
In Ingmar Bergmanâ€™s Port of Call, Berit, a suicidal young woman living in a working-class port town, unexpectedly falls for GÃ¶sta, a sailor on leave. Haunted by a troubled past and held in a vice grip by her domineering mother, Berit begins to hope that her relationship with GÃ¶sta might save her from self-destruction.

THIRST
INGMAR BERGMAN, 1949 - 84 minutes
A couple traveling across a war-ravaged Europe. A disintegrating marriage. A ballet dancerâ€™s scarred past. Her friendâ€™s psychological agony. Elliptically told in flashbacks and multiple narrative threads, Ingmar Bergmanâ€™s Thirst shows people enslaved to memory and united in isolation.

TO JOY
INGMAR BERGMAN, 1949 - 99 minutes
An orchestra violinistâ€™s dreams of becoming a celebrated soloist and fears of his own mediocrity get in the way of his marriage to the patient, caring Marta. Played out to the music of Beethoven, Ingmar Bergmanâ€™s To Joy is a heartbreaking tale of one manâ€™s inability to overcome the demons standing in the way of his happiness.
