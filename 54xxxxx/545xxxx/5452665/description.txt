PLOT
After a mid-air collision, an uncontrollable passenger plane with 90 passengers on board speeds through the skies over Germany. The impact point for the inevitable plane crash is easily calculated: the center of Berlin. Now the race is on to prevent the catastrophe, with only two hours separating the desperate passengers and the unsuspecting inhabitants of Berlin from a tragic end.
