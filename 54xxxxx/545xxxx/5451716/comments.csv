,nickbfromct,2011-06-30T19:55Z,"god damnit this is the same torrent I downloaded before with the random songs in it. The description says all the right songs but then you get a bunch of shit songs that aren't on the album in the torrent.

THIS IS NOT PURPLE HAZE, only a few songs from the album and other random Cam songs."
