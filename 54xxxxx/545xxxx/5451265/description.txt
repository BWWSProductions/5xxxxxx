presents New Day Rising by HÃ¼sker DÃ¼ in FLAC audio.

From Wikipedia:

New Day Rising is a 1985 album by the American punk rock band HÃ¼sker DÃ¼, released on SST Records ... While retaining the speed and aggression of earlier efforts, many fans maintain that virtually all of the songs on New Day Rising exhibit a strong pop sensibility. Guitarist and lead singer Bob Mould's trademark miasma of fuzz distortion is still present, but with much of the harsh rawness of previous efforts abandoned in favor of a more melodic sound.
