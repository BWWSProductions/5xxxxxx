[V],mothergoose56,2010-03-23T00:05Z,"You're right, hes a socialist. Democracy leads to Socialism, which ends up as Communism. The folks who founded this country warned us about what is going on right now. That's why America was created as a Constitutional Republic (with Democratic elections) and not a ""Democracy"". 

No matter what you believe, the Constitution does not allow for unequal re-distribution of wealth. Period. You want Government run healthcare? Than work to make amendments to allow such things and push for it. Just ignoring the Constitution and the rules that are to be followed (and that politicians swore to uphold) is wrong. It's not about ""Right"" or ""Left"" - that's a fallacy to keep us preoccupied and fighting. Neither side follows the rules - America is straight up fucked as a country. "

[V],mothergoose56,2010-03-23T02:35Z,"Maybe, until the dollar completely collapses - and rest assured it WILL happen. How do you think they're going to pay for all of this ""Free Health Care"" garbage. Raid 500 Billion from Medicare, tax people with good insurance 40%, use student load funds, and print EVEN MORE PAPER MONEY. It's a tax unto itself, the main reason for massive inflation since the 70's, and it lowers all of our individual net worth. Despite what the ""mainstream"" media tells us over and over, we are not coming out of an economic downturn. We are on the verge of a major collapse (could be a few years out still). Our politicians ""solution"" to our problems is to continue to do what has caused the problems times 10. 

Ironically blackirishlad, if ""what we once were"" means a nation reborn from the ashes of government oppression and excessive taxation - then maybe we will end up what we once were. Not sure it will happen though, too many fucking sheep lemmings asleep at the wheel. WAKE THE FUCK UP AMERICA. 

Seriously - 16,500 new IRS agents are being hired and every American isn't outraged by this? Now we're taxing Pizza and Soda? Why not just make it illegal so we can have an underground Pizza trade and the government can lock us all up while fighting the ""War on Food"" - all with our own tax dollars of course. We are no longer a free society - things have gotten out of hand. If we don't stand up now it's only going to get worse. "
[V],mothergoose56,2010-03-23T02:58Z,"Yea, I know. You don't want to hear about it - you just want your O&A, lol. "
,FayeRaye,2010-03-23T09:53Z,"Thanks, as Always MG. And you're wise to be weary of the coming chaos and more losses of our freedoms. But, this showdown has been a long time coming. 

As Winston Churchill said: ""Never, Never, Never, Never Give Up."""
[V],mothergoose56,2010-03-23T12:52Z,"> But, this showdown has been a long time coming. 

That's absolutely correct - I'm not insinuating that this all started with Obama. Our last real president might have been JFK - even though he was from a connected political family and was far from perfect I think he actually had a conscience. Although the showdown pre-dates his presidency as well. 

HOLY CRAP. Did I just hear an Alex Jones ad on XM202 as I type this?! Alex is just a little scary, but sadly the truth is quite insane. 

If I told you world political leaders, business leaders and media elite gather every year deep in the woods of California and perform Satanic rituals including mock human sacrifice before a 40ft stone owl - you'd called me insane, right? 

Unfortunately, the above ACTUALLY happens at ""Bohemian Grove"", an exclusive men only ""club"" that has existed since 1872. No conspiracy, just FACT - Alex Jones snuck in and even captured video of it. Patrice Oneal knows what's up (Bill Burr too) - he has mentioned Bohemian Grove on air. "
