Duran Duran came out of Birmingham and conquered the world during the 1980s.
Originally a New Romantic band in full make-up and cossack pants, they rapidly became
bedroom pinups for a generation of teenage girls.

Led by Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes and John Taylor, Duran Duran dominated the British
and American charts in the mid 1980s with classic singles such as Rio, Save a Prayer
and Wild Boys. Pioneers of the MTV-style promo video - from the X-rated Girls on Film to
Raiders of the Lost Arc spoof Hungry Like the Wolf - Duran Duran were the 80s
equivalent of the Beatles in America and outsold Spandau Ballet and Wham! in their
pomp.

Sixty million records later, Le Bon and Rhodes are seen touring America with their Pop
Trash project from the early 2000s. The documentary reflects on the heady heights of
Duran Duran's career, the cracks in their make-up plus the effects of sex, drugs and fame
on ordinary boys from working class backgrounds.

Apart from the key Durannies - Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor - the programme also
features celebrity interviews with Debbie Harry, Yasmin Le Bon, Duran Duran managers
Paul and Michael Berrow, Claudia Schiffer, Nile Rodgers and Lou Reed.
