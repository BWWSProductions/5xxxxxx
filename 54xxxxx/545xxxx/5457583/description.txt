The endearing, hard-working Nastienka is tyrannised by her unpleasant stepmother, who prefers her german daughter Marfusha in all interests and supports her in her laziness. By the way, not that you think, Nastya's father is dead or so, he only hasn't much to say in this household. He plays the role of the henpecked husband, who carries out the instructions of his wife.

After Nastya used her little spare time between her arduous work to talk with Stumpy, the stump, she meets the ruthless egomaniac Ivan, who is looking for a bride and puts an engagement ring on the finger of our heroine without hesitation. Nastienka seems to sense his good marrow (at least she seems to prefer the macho instead of the situation at home), but first the spirits of the forest punish Ivan, to feel humbled and learn helpfulness and so they transformed him - into a bear! Now both, Nastya and Ivan, must pass a set of tests, before they finally find together again and we can experience the usual fairy tale Happy End.

With Fairy Tale the clear moral message is provided to the young target group that sympathy and helpfulness have a high social value. While Nastya already progressed far in this regard, Ivan must still learn his lessons. Even if the scenes mediate a quite idyllic impression, the characters have all together nothing to do with romantic aloofness, but manage their affairs pragmatically reasonable.

Our fairy tale adventure is told with much humor and winking. We learn e.g. how looking for a wife and wedding negotiations ran off in rural Russia   and must smile inevitably, when the constantly grouching Marfucha bangs her fist on the table or stamps her foot on the ground demanding: "I want a husband!" Then even the constantly nagging mother pipes down and tries to appease the daughter.
