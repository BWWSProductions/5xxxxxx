BIO
The sound of Ellison has been described as having some of the trademarks of â€œEmo,â€ but with a more graceful, grown-up edge. 
With great honor, the band has been compared to the likes of Jimmy Eat World, Copeland, and Cartel. Ellisonâ€™s energetic blend 
of indie pop with straightforward rock is sure to deliver a powerful emotional punch to the indie pop scene. Their debut full 
length CD Say Goodnight, Sleep Alone hit stores in August 2006 thanks to the faith and hard work of Carbon Copy Media, the record 
label started by J.T. Woodruff, lead singer of Hawthorne Heights.

On September 25th, 2007 a brand new song by Ellison called â€œLet Your Guard Downâ€ mixed by famed producer David Bendeth was 
released on the Punk The Clock Vol. 3 compilation alongside Jackâ€™s Mannequin, The Almost, The Starting Line and more.

Ellison will release their sophomore release, Color Of Compassion, independent of any record company on June 3, 2008. 
Ellison is already looking ahead to plans for a second release in 2008 and will continue to tour the country and share 
their passion for music with newfound fans.
