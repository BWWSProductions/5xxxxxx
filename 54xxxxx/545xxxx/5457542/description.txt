Heads Or Tales is the fifth studio album by the Canadian rock band Saga and was originally released in 1983. The album was the second of the band's to be produced by 1980s producer Rupert Hine. Although it did not receive the commercial success of the previous collaboration between the band and Hine, both "The Flyer" and "Cat Walk" became respectable radio hits for the band with the album eventually securing gold status in Canada and Germany.
