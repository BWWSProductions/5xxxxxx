Released on March 16, 2010.

The White Stripes is an American rock duo, formed in 1997 in Detroit, Michigan. 
The group consists of songwriter Jack White (vocals, guitar, piano, and once 
bass) and Meg White (drums and occasional vocals).

After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit independent music underground, The White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002, as part of the garage rock revival scene. 

Their successful albums White Blood Cells and Elephant drew them attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom.

The White Stripes use a low-fidelity, do-it-yourself approach to writing and 
recording, their music features a melding of punk and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. 

The duo is also noted for their fashion and design aesthetic which features a 
simple color scheme of red, white, and black.

Now everybody knows Jack White can be a little bit different but theres no doubt about his talent whether it be with The White Stripes, The Racounteurs or latest band the Dead Weather however how much do we actually know about the other half of The White Stripes, drummer and some time vocalist Meg White? Its safe to say all we really know is that she used to be married to Jack and is married now to Patti Smiths son.
