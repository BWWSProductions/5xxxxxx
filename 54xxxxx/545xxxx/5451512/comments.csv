Sincerley hoping you can do the same next year!

And maybe the darn Eurosport will some day get in the habit of always showing ENTIRE races, not just recorded highlights..."
,BasilBrush,2010-03-25T23:11Z,On the satellite multiplex there's a Eurosport test stream that could be a future Eurosport 3 channel. They basically don't have enough channels. On Eurosport 2 they seems to transmit live stuff in 4:3 mode. Sometimes it's a 16:9 picture inside a 4:3 box which is transmitted as 16:9 - in other words you finish up with hardly any picture. Eurosport 1 seems to always use 16:9 but the frame size is 544x576 which looks a bit fuzzy when stretched to 1024x576. I suppose for ÂŁ1 per month that's all you can expect.

On the one hand, yes. But on the other hand, those kinds of broadcasts are paid for by sponsors - that's why we CONSTANTLY see all the Viessman and Ruhrgas logos."
