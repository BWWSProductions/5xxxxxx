LENNY KRAVITZ Mail On Sunday(mp3 320kbs)ICM369 
______________________________________________

This is a preview of four of the great tracks sensational CD exclusive six 
tracks from Lenny Kravitzs new album(2003), and six original studio recordings of his greatest hits, available free on CD in the Mail on Sunday.

He is a rock god, he has dated Nicole Kidman, Kylie and Madonna, and he has built Miami's ultimate party pad.

The collection of uber-stylish vintage cars; the Austin Powers love shack, the leather trousers, dreadlocks and iconic good looks and, of course, the array of beautiful actresses, models and pop stars ? if ever there was a personification of a rock god then Lenny Kravitz was it.

His pad in the glamorous Miami district of Biscayne Bay had the reputation among those lucky enough to have frequented it as a party palace.

Complete with a laminated purple front door, white fur-lined hallway, pinball 
machines, pool tables, doors that opened like the ones on Star Trek, and, of 
course, the obligatory mirrored ceiling, visitors took much coaxing to leave.
