,lilars26,2010-03-21T16:46Z,"Thanks 20/40.
The telesyncs are getting very good.Technology must be getting better.We should thank the people who take the geatest risk in getting these for us.
Have a great day."
,P2P101,2010-03-21T17:33Z,"Just wondering if You were serious about not uping Caprica anymore.  And what of Spartacus?
I've been using up my bandwidth to continue seeding all your torrents and now you start to remove the good ones, why is that??? Thank you again for all the time and effort you have put into these shows and I hope you change your mind about these shows."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-21T18:16Z,"@P2P101: If I get 92% of Hit&Runs, I always have removed the shows. It's like that last few years and my ""regulars"" know that 1st: I am serious in keeping promises I made and 2nd- that this is is the last resort I use for maintaining my manifesto and to protect (believe it or not) remaining few good people.

I cannot support Hit&Run, I won't - and... period.

No one has invented any better way for dealing with growing number of desperate, insane people than removing, destroying and deplete their ""sources"". 

Look, it's up to you, wont you seed or not, I obviously cannot change the path of self-destruction of P2P network and a idea of file sharing. We have corporations against us - but.. as always goes - we do their job, P2P would self-destruct and die. Like eDonkey.
Thank-god or whomever, I won't be here when that happen."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-21T18:35Z,"@lilars26: Sadly, it cannot be truth. Just yesterday I downloaded insanely BIG (4.3 GB 720p) Telesync of Cop Out and one semi-big of Green Zone (1.4 GB). 
It took 12 hours to download these and only a second for clicking on ""Delete"". You can guess how ""good"" they were.

Did I felt stupid after that? Yes... that feeling never left."
,lilars26,2010-03-21T19:32Z,"Sorry about that.I forgot about all the crap you have to download and sort through just to get us one good one...but I do appreciate it.It was just wishful thinking.Hopefully the day will come when
the original uploaders will stop putting out crap and take a little more pride in what they do...as you do.Problem is there are thousands of people who will download sight unseen instead of waiting for a good copy.Thanks for your work and allowing me to ramble on."
