,lastjedi,2010-08-05T01:10Z,ive download hundreds of movies from piratebay and never had any problems till i downloaded from this file.i picked up a really bad virus and i dont recomment to anyone to download this.i only downloaded american pie 1 but when it was downloading on utorrent i couldnt even delete the file cause the virus wouldnt let me open it to delete it.so i had to use spysweeper to get rid of it.and whenever i get a virus i never have to restart my pc but for this particular virus spysweeper told me i had too.
