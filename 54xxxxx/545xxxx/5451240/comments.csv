I hope it's not too late. 

First, thanks for those great mixes. I haven't heard any equal level, yes there some little mistakes but it shows that you didn't you used program like mixmeister. And the choice of tracks the manner you organised it is excellent. It not linear I hope one day I reach this level.

Second, I'd like to ask you the name of the song of the sample you used at 11min 19 sec ( at the end of impulse 101). I don't even know what a female voice says "" into your mind "" or something like "" 8 1 0 1"". And the style is house acid with a pretty good baseline and some indian trumpet like sample's.

I have a mix tape from 1994, but without any names or titles. All I know is, it's a mix made in France ( don't know the dj. I have to find this music ! 16 years that I have this frustration. 

Five years that I have access to the net, your mix is the first and better clue that I have found.

Please help."
