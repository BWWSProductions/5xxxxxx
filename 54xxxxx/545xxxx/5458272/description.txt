From back cover:

After her first divorce, Ellen gave up on marriage â€” but then she met Marsh Greene. Over the next 20 years, Ellen secretly wrote down all the thoughtful and caring things her husband said and did in her â€œSweet Things List.â€ In Remember the Sweet Things, Greene recalls these memories, sharing an honest account of her own love story, and reminding listeners that true happiness in marriage can be found in the smallest actions.
