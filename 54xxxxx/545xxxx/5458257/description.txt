JAMES COTTON LIVE IN CHICAGO
MR SUPERHARP HIMSELF
Label Alligator
Orig Year 1986
Format:Mp3@2320


A 1986 live show by the legendary bluesman, and as the title indicates this one features a bigger band than usual, featuring a three-piece horn section. The arrangements are also a little different than Cotton's norm, tending as they do towards late '70s funk, in particular on songs like "Part Time Love" and "Hard Headed."

There's still plenty of straight blues here, however, including "When it Rains it Pours," and Cotton is in terrific vocal form throughout, particularly on a blistering version of Muddy Waters' "Born in Chicago." Meanwhile, his harp work is especially fiery on the concluding instrumental "The Midnight Creeper," a de facto tribute to Little Walter.

Recorded at Biddy Milligan's, Chicago, Illinois from February 1-3, 1986.

James Cotton (vocals, harmonica); Michael Coleman (guitar); Douglas Fagen (tenor saxophone); Danny "Boney" Fields (trumpet); Johnny Cotton (trombone); Eddie Harsch (piano); Noel Neal (bass); Ray "Killer" Allison (drums).
