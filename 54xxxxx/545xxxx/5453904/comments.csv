,Mitzos,2010-10-13T20:28Z,"THIS SUCKS! some songs are not complete, such as doggfather, the first 30 secs are missing, or xplosive, the first 3 secs are missing, i know its not much, but that first tone of the bassline its just toooooo important, if you know what i mean haha... didnt hear every single song yet, but dont think the rest is 100% complete..."
,Mitzos,2010-10-13T20:31Z,"sorry, i meant Buck'em, not xplosive hahaha.... my fault..."
