This is a requested reseed. It died before as apparently no one in torrent land has any gambling issues and doesn't know anyone who does. Good to hear.

Review
This terrific DVD explores the true costs of gambling and examines the myths behind the obsession. There is no glorification of gambling as it is exposed for what it is and does--damages the lives of those who gamble and of those around them....This is probably one of the best all-round teaching and therapy tools available on the market today. The price is quite affordable considering the excellent content and information. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a realistic, unbiased overview of problem gambling. This should be mandatory viewing for parents with their teenage and college-aged children....4 stars! ----Doody's Review Service

Product Description
This straight-talking, empowering video program offers essential information on how problem gambling develops, its damaging impact on individuals and families, and how it can successfully be treated. Through candid first-hand accounts from four recovering gamblers, along with illuminating commentary from mental health experts, the program shows gamblers, their families, and therapists: how an alluring diversion becomes a shameful secret as problem gambling takes hold; common myths and misperceptions about gambling--and why 'winning big' is so unlikely; the benefits of individual and group therapy and self-help approaches; and ways to overcome setbacks in recovery and make meaningful, lasting changes.
