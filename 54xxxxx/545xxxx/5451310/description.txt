Released: 15 Nov 2004
__________

An Unrivalled Collection From The Greatest Voices Of A Classic 
Era, hairstyles change, clothing trends come and go, but truly 
great music never goes out of fashion. 

The Original American Songbook is a comprehensive collection of 
classic songs from some of the finest vocalists of all time.

With so many fantastic artists featured on this triple CD collection 
it is hard to decide who not to mention, but what better place to 
start than with king of the crooners himself, Frank Sinatra, 
delivering Stormy Weather as only he could.
 
Franks rat-pack pals Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr also feature, 
perhaps most notably with Martins light-hearted ode to lovers 
everywhere,Thats Amore.

More memorable moments from the golden age of silver-screen musicals 
are brought flooding back, with songs from Gene Kelly, Judy Garland 
and the ever-elegant Fred Astaire. 

The appeal of Andy Williams Moon River still runs wider than a mile; 
and no collection of classics would be complete without ol Sachmo himself, 
Louis Armstrong, performing the evergreen What A Wonderful World. 

Other stars on the album include Patsy Cline, Bing Crosby, Marilyn Monroe, 
Bobby Darin - the list goes on and on - and is rounded off with the 
original Unchained Melody (a No.1 hit for more artists than any other cover), 
performed here by The Righteous Brothers.

The Original American Songbook is a testament to the timeless quality of tunes penned by Cole Porter, Rogers and Hammerstein, The Gershwins and many more legendary songwriters. 

These are the all time classic artists singing their classic hits; in the way 
only they know how.
