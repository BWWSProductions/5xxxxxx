Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures S01E05: Unhappy Endings

It's Christmas Eve and chaos reigns in the emergency room. Fitz contends with some hard-assed cops and a belligerent patient. It's a contentious situation that he initially handles well, but as the evening progresses he spirals out of control to a very self-destructive place. When Chen finds himself dealing with the family of a man who died in a brothel, he starts to question his own views on medicine and family. Meanwhile, though she's not embroiled in the turmoil of the hospital, Ming is confronted by her father's strange solution to her fertility problems.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion.
