 RELEASE NOTES:                                                             
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                              
 A photo restricts your excitement from holidays spent at the seaside or    
 near a waterfall to flat, two-dimensional images. Nature Illusion Studio   
 lets you go beyond these physical restrictions and make a self-made        
 animated scene, which can bring the original spirit and excitement of the  
 holiday back to life.                                                      
                                                                            
 All visual effects have been recreated with accurate physics, so ripples   
 on the water or subtle movements of the air look and behave just like they 
 might in the physical life.                                                
                                                                            
 The best thing is that you can share your excitement with others. You can  
 create a screensaver and present it as a gift to your beloved or friend,   
 publish it on your website and let your guests or customers download it    
 for free.                                                                  
                                                                            
 An important benefit of Nature Illusion Studio is the option to share the  
 exciting and happy moment in the more realistic manner as opposed to the   
 traditional two dimensional photos.                                        
                                                                            
 The end result is a superbly lifelike and atmospheric presentation that    
 can be saved as a screensaver, a standalone executable, an AVI or animated 
 GIF file and distributed to other people, who can admire your creation.
