,Prosum,2010-03-24T06:34Z,"The crack doesn't help when you can't get it installed. CD-Key request comes prior to install.

The SteamBackUp.exe file doesn't appear to install the game, as far as I can figure. It asks for the ""installdir"" but does not, again as far as I can tell, actually install the game. Actually it looks like it would make the game playable w/o the need for Steam.

But again that's a problem for after you can actually get it installed..."
,DemonicArc,2010-03-24T06:35Z,"Ok yeah, I just finished the download and yes it is, steambackup.exe, just run it and pick your directory, whatever directory you pick it will add a folder ""Just Cause 2"" into that directory and install the game there, than just copy over the contents of the crack  folder into that ""just Cause 2"" directory.

nothing to it."
,Prosum,2010-03-24T06:38Z,"Okay the oddest thing... running it from a mounted image, for some reason it will not actually add the files to the folder... but copying the files to a folder then running it... seems to be working..."
,xDrTran,2010-03-24T06:41Z,"For future reference Prosum;

It's always better, and usually works, if you DO extract it before you do anything.

It installs better, and finds the files better, from a folder on your computer, rather than an ISO file.

I always extract it before I use it, and never fails. :D"

(sorry for my english)"
,fhffan,2010-03-24T07:09Z,"Just so everyone knows: You DON'T need a CD key to install. 

After mounting/burning the iso, go to that drive and double click ""steambackup.EXE"" This is the real installer to use for this cracked version. When the window pops up asking where to install, select your normal Program Files folder and then hit ok and the game will be installed from there. It will be in Program Files\Just Cause 2 or Program Files(x86)\Just Cause 2 depending on your OS."
,Gimmicco,2010-03-24T07:34Z,"The problem is with Nvidia drivers at the moment.
If you have the latest drivers installed, the game will stop loading when you start the new game.
There is a way to get around it tho, but it makes the game highly unstable, and pretty much too crash prone to play. But if you wanna try it out, here's how you get in game.
Again, this is just a work around, and the game WILL crash quite a lot.

1.
Start the game

2.
When in main menu, press Ctrl+Alt+Del

3.
go to the process bar

4.
Right click on JustCause2.exe (or what ever it is)

5.
Pick ""Set affinity"".

6.
Make it work with 1 processor.

7.
Go back to game, and click new game, and you should be able to get past the intro demos, and into the game.

Again. This works, but it makes the game highly unstable, because this was intended to be played with multicore computers."

,Gimmicco,2010-03-24T08:39Z,"Further more...
You can apparently play the game with ridiculously small settings...
This game, or Nvidia drivers have some serious issues. The demo that came out some weeks ago played well and dandy with my rig, but not this one. Have to turn the graphic setting to pretty low, until i can play the game...
Oh well. Even then the game looks awesome and so forth... "
,WifoutTeef,2010-03-24T08:54Z,"I can confirm this works.

1. Download this torrent and the RELOADED Crack only torrent

2. Mount the ISO

3. Install it to C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common

4. Copy the contents from the cracked folder you got from that torrent into the Just Cause 2 folder that gets installed in the common directory.

5. Done, it works! Have fun and buy the game if you like it."

,Khosrow Khan,2010-03-24T16:01Z,"I have a problem with this release! 

I'm using windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit. 

I ran the "" home made "" installer by reloaded, and chose my "" program files "" directory to be where the game gets installed. 

After the process was finished, I browsed to the "" program Files "" folder, and folder called "" just cause 2 "" or anything similar to that could be found! It simply wasn't there! However, I could see that 4GB of my hard disk space had been taken! 

Now here comes the strange thing: when I ran the installer again, a folder called "" justcause 2"" could be seen in the browsing window that popped up with the installer, but still nothing could be seen when I normally browsed there. 

Restart didn't help either. 

Next thing I ran the installer with admin clearance and chose the very same place. this time the folder appeared and the game could be played! However, I still don't know where or how to find the first installation! 

Could anybody help me out? 

Thanks!   "

,keanez,2010-03-24T17:27Z,"To all the guys that are having trouble installing it without a CD Key, what you need to do is start the install with the steambackup.exe

If it doesn't let you start the steambackup.exe, unmount the image, disable your antivirus software, remount and try the steambackup.exe again.

For some reason the steambackup.exe is recognised as a trojan with some antivirus software so it'll block it.

You won't be ask for a CD key this way."

I've been reading the past 6 pages and I see TONS of arguments about XP and Vista/7.

To be honest, I hate Vista/7 with a passion. Its one of the most buggy OS in existance.

But then again, Vista was always a piece of crap, and 7 Hasnt been out for long. So of course its buggy. I'll wait for a service pack or two, then update to 7.

Untill then, im sticking by XP. Fuck Microsoft and their marketing bullcrap."

The game though, is garbage.
crappy graphics look like a game from 2004. The dialog is stupid, and the concept ridiculous:

When the window pops up asking where to install, select your normal Program Files folder and then hit ok and the game will be installed from there.

""steam_api.dll"" file
and the
""(0xc0000022)"" error message when trying to start
is caused by your virus program(s).

For eg. I'm using AVG Anti-Virus and it freaks out over the ""steam_api.dll"" file and says it's full of viruses (and whether or not that's TRUE, I have no idea), so what I did was:
1. I mounted the ISO file with daemon tools
2. I added the ""crack"" folder ON THE DVD to AVG Anti-Virus's exeptions (tools > advanced settings > resident shield > exeptions), this allowed me to copy the ""steam_api.dll"" file from the dvd to the game directory without any problems
3. Then I did the same thing for the Just Cause 2 game folder, I added it too to the AVG Anti-Virus's exeptions, wich allows the program to use the ""steam_api.dll"" file without any complaint from AVG Anti-Virus

Now, depending on which virus program you are using, the way to allow (""infected"") files through it will be very varying, but shouldn't be so hard to figure out with some >>>GOOGLING"

In my case Panda Cloud ""neutralized"" the file when it tried to run and made it useless so I had to re-extract it and then disable my virus scanner and run it again, and the installer came right up, I picked a folder to install to and copied the crack content over so I was good to go."

,NestlePureLife,2010-03-26T23:06Z,I didn't realize this game didn't work on XP so I had to upgrade to Vista (a free upgrade came with my computer) and I don't know how to install this. I was low on space before I upgraded so I burned this game onto a DVD. When I installed the game on XP it was just straightforward but now that I'm on Vista it wants me to install it from Steam which requires a CD key. So what I'm asking is how do I install it without having a CD key?
,NestlePureLife,2010-03-26T23:10Z,I looked around and found autorun.inf and in there it says OPEN=steambackup.exe so I tried running steambackup.exe and it's installing but just to clarify that's how you install it right?

Then run it.

Give me 3 valid reasons WHY Windows 7 sucks.

I've been using Windows 7 for nearly 5 months now, and not a SINGLE problem, not big nor small.

Just because you got NEW parts, doesn't mean they aren't OLD in terms of power. (many people get confused with this)

I'm using Windows 7 64bit, I can run this PERFECTLY, no problems AT ALL.

It's not the OS, it's YOU or YOUR computer."
,xDrTran,2010-03-28T10:11Z,"Okay.

To all those crying; ""THIS HAZ VIRUSES, DONT DOWNLOAADD!!!""

This has none.

If you're computer literate, and know ANYTHING about computers, 'cracks' are original files, MODIFIED.

Therefore, anti-viruses and other programs MAY say these cracks are viruses, when they ARE NOT.

Please, get some knowledge in computers before saying shit on something."

3 Reasons why XP is better than Windows 7.

1) Memory usage, most annoying one. I mean for example you are playin solitare on XP it takes about 3900-5000K of memory. Now lets say you have 2 Gigs of memory and you install Windows 7. (NO I HAS 4) When you install it the memory usage is 1 GB already though you have installed yet nothing. When you start solitare on W7 it eats 40 MEGS of your memory!Solitare is a 2D card game ffs. And this is supposed to be the os that uses less memory.

2) Amount of processes. First time i installed 7 i was shocked when i realized that it had over 50 precesses on stock. When i used xp i had only 29 without anything running. And once again they use a serios amount of memory.

3) Compatibility problems. Vista had it Windows 7 has it, but guess what: XP didn't. Now you propably think now that i have ancient computer. Nuh uh. 

MB: Crosshair III Formula
MEM: 4 GiG of Ripjaws @1600MHz
CPU: AMD Phenom II x4 965 BE
GPU: Radeon HD 4870
PSU: 600 Watt 
HDD: 1TB Samsung HDD @ 7200RPM

And yet everytime i run Just Cause 2 for example, this happens: ATi Radeon drivers has stopped working. I've updated the drivers, it didn't help. And everytime i update them then windows 7 comes and say ""omg download bttar drivers from me nao"" and starts to download a older version of the drivers.

There are many other reasons as well like UAC and other shit. When i had W7 x64 running it was slow like hell bsod rvery other minute, and i thought my parts weren't compatible. I installed x86 and it gave up with bsod, but everything else is still there.
Only good feature in 7 is DX 11 support and the super bar thingie (no really, it's fucking cool ;))

I can confirm you're a dickhead and computer illiterate.

@4z4z3l

The RAM usage isn't really a problem if you keep your computer up to date, if you went back, to before XP, to the day it came out, you could also complain about that comparing to an older OS.

With the computer I have now, comparing XP and Windows 7 from a performance standpoint (not technical and FULL ON into everything), it seems better.

Looks smoother, feels smoother and runs smoother from what I can tell.

2. a) Run ""steambackup"" (The option should pop up when you mount the image)
2. b) Choose the location (a pop-up asks you to choose).  I saw lots of people saying to put it in the SteamApps/Common folder, but I didn't.  I just put it in a random folder (D:/Games/Just Cause 2).  I don't think it matters where you install it.
2. c) At the end of the installation, you'll get an ""Error"" message, telling you to buy the game.  This message doesn't matter, just click cancel.
3. You'll find the crack in the mounted image thingy (Open to view files).  You can find it by going to Computer, and it should be on the DVD drive.  Copy EVERYTHING in the crack folder into the folder where you installed it, and choose to ""Move and replace"".  If you don't copy the .dll file, the game won't work!
4. Run the JustCause2 application
5. Enjoy!

By the way, I'm using Windows 7 64-bit.  I don't know if it works the same on other OSs."

It gets repetitive after awhile, especially between story missions, but theres still alot of different stuff you can do.

Its like Red Faction Guerilla, but waaay easier to get around. (Or like GTA, but bigger and easier to move around, also has a destructable world)

You go around, blow stuff up, kill enemies, and you got this badass hookshot to get around with. You can even use the hookshot on enemies/vehicles, hang enemies from trees, pull them off buildings, pin the to helicopters, pin a moving vehicle to the ground so it flings itself when it moves too far."

There are lots of errors with reloaded version. You will need to patch it with missing files from Skidrow version

The crack supplied with the reloaded version is VERY buggy, it will work for some, but not for most others. 

Make sure you download the skidrow missing files, the reloaded guy never bothered to fix the pc.04 error(and .02?)

http://www.ticmarket.com/just-cause-2-errors-fix/

I finally got it working after the stupid loading screen freeze.

IMPORTANT>>> MAKE SURE YOU DELETE SQUARE ENIX FOLDER IN DOCUMENTS BEFORE YOU APPLY THE MISSING FILE PATCH. 

Don't run the benchmark, it may corrupt your .dat files for JC2 and you may have to delete your JC2 folder, and do it all over again"

I used reloaded crack and it didnt work, gave me 0xo00002 (something like that) error. I donloaded the Skidrow proper crack and that didnt work, clicked launch and nothing happened, Justcause2_game didnt work gave me errors. Final fix was to download (Just Cause 2 SKIDROW CrackOnly and missing files) torrent and transferred over the archives win32 folder AND newer crack files contained also. BANG it worked right away.

The get-around of you have AVG installed is a bitch, it will always block the backup.exe from working so here is what i did.

1) i opened AVG up
2) went into the tools menu at the top, then advanced settings
3) Under Resident Shield settings, then Exceptions
4) add the entire folder where you have the files to the exception list
5) run backup.exe and install game

*Note* you need to extract the .iso to a file before you can do this

I don't know, perhaps I'm just too old now to enjoy this kind of games. This game reminded me a lot about another game from Sweden called Bionic Commando, especially that part with the hook. It was just swing there, swing here, grab that, make that stunt and so on. What happened to story? Depth? Detail? These days all games are supposed to be open ended but aim too high and end up thin. I think games being a little linear is good. The game felt quite silly and unrealistic also."

Copy the contents of the Crack folder on the mounted drive to your intall directory.
Play the game.

,beastb,2010-04-07T17:34Z,"for those having issues with the steambackup not having the correct permissions - and you are an AVG user - you need to do a few things as mentioned by Conkker a few pages back

avg will always be running on your system, you need to not just close it or disable it, you need to make exceptions for it to obey by

first make sure you extract the iso using winrar or something to a random folder

in avg go to tools>advanced settings then scroll down to resident shield and click on directory excludes

add a new directory by using the path options and point it to the directory of your extracted iso

after that run steambackup as admin and you'll be fine for the install, let the 8bit awsomeness commence"

STEP 1
Open AVG, and go to tools, then advanced settings.

Find Resident Shield, to the right, then go to excluded files.

Press ""Add"", then find steambackup in your mount/burnt dvd.

STEP 4 
Start Steambackup.exe in your mount/burnt dvd,  and it will install.

Not bad but it does not deserve the scores its been getting from people who obviously have only played it for a short time. NOTE: to the people that have been having problems installing and playing 1 to install you have to turn off your anti virus because of a false positive it gets from he installer (you install this game with the steambackup.EXE nothing else!) then copy over everything in the crack folder to the folder its installed in. 2 if the frame rate is low i.e. its very laggy lower resolution and setting as needed if problem persists it means you need more ram this game eats up a lot of ram/a better proseser or just one you overclocked (overclocking you proseser is not recommended if you don't know what the hell you are doing) and fill the void with virtual ram."

,inuyasha5891,2010-04-13T18:34Z,"OKAY FELLAS I'VE FIGURED IT OUT!!!!! HOW TO GET THE GAME RUNNING.

THIS IS WHAT I DID.

I mounted the ISO and ran the ""Autorun.exe"" on the ISO and went through the setup, which installed Steam etc. I did not make any account with Steam etc. I copied the contents of the CRACK folder (JustCause2.exe, language TXT, and Steam_api.dll) to the Steam directory located in Program Files. I TRIED TO RUN THE GAME BY RUNNING THE JUSTCAUSE2.EXE, BUT THAT DID NOT WORK. I READ SOME OF THE COMMENTS ON HERE AND FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN STEAMBACKUP.EXE on the ISO. 

I ran Steambackup.exe on the ISO and i t prompts you to choose a folder. Choose an Independent folder of the Steam Installation folder found in Program Files. Create a new folder on your desktop and choose that folder. Steambackup.exe will run and start unpackaging some files. It'll take some time so go do something else in the mean time. I called my girlfriend over and we fucked for about 2 to 3 hours. :-D LOL. By the time we were done with that it had already finished unpacking. THERE WAS AN ERROR MESSAGE, but I ignored it and the game was unpacked into the new folder I made. I went back to the crack folder on the ISO and copied the contents of the Crack folder to the new installation folder then ran the game. THE GAME TAKES A WHILE TO LOAD. I don't know why, I suppose it has to with me running the game on Windows Se7en.

Anyways good luck and I hope this helps.

,ab0m8,2010-04-23T13:57Z,"Can someone help me with something?  Should be simple, I'm not retarded and other people might benefit from it.

I went through what libertystrike said to do a few times and each time it failed.  It extracts fine with the steambackup.exe thing and all but every time I try to start the game it opens a huge white window (presumably the game) and then the program crashes.  It gives me the typical ""Just cause 2 has stopped working"" with the option to check online for a solution (uselss btw, kids).

I figured I might fix it by taking it out of Program Files (x86) and putting it in Program Files cause that's helped with some other games but nothing here.  I also didn't get any error before it gave me a browse prompt, that might help.

Running windows 7, 64 bit and I have dx10 with system specs that can run this game fine.  I just can't go and download the Skidrow torrent cause I'm right near my bandwidth limit for the month.  I'd really appreciate the help and I'm sure some others would too."
,ab0m8,2010-04-23T14:13Z,"I'm just gonna add to what I said cause I think something may have failed to run or something judging by other people's comments.

I mounted the image using daemon tools, opened the ISO from my computer and ran steambackup.exe.  It instantly prompted me to choose the folder without giving me an error first.  The first install I chose program files x86 and it extracted a folder called 'just cause 2' to program files x86 with all the game content in there.  Next install I did it like libertystrike said and chose 'JC2', the folder I created, then the next two installs I did the same two things but in regular program files, none of these times did it work in the end.  After installing each time, i put everything from the skidrow crack into the folder where the game's exe is and let it replace stuff and merge folders, then tried launching with each exe (there's 2 after you copy the crack) and with 'Just cause 2.exe' I get the launcher with the language select, works fine, but then it fucking fails when I hit launch.

There just doesn't seem to be a reason why it's not working.  Really confusing me."
,ab0m8,2010-04-23T14:30Z,"I found the problem.  There a directX folder in the install directory, if you open that and install the version of dx that's in there it will fix the blank screen error I was getting.

First, great game, wonderfull graphics...

But, in the steambackup.exe theres a trojan... link to prove it: http://www.virustotal.com/de/analisis/c06bc2cfcd77a02ed346693d56c564ca568066bdd5278c9ca15b15b752d86785-1272184020

imho, its not a badass one, i easily removed it with mbam...

another question: do some of you also have problems with a resolution of 1440x900+FS? on my pc, it cuts the screen left and right... and no, its not a screen-error, because i can't move the mouse outside the cutted area...

make sure the image IS ALREADY MOUNTED when you do this!

,Camoron,2010-05-01T00:24Z,"Okay, just thought I'd post something to help clarify this for other people who may be having problems installing.

1. Run steambackup.exe, not autorun.exe.
2. If Windows says it won't allow you to run it, it's probably because your anti-virus is blocking it. There is no trojan or virus in this torrent. This is called a ""false positive"" and it occurs when your anti-virus THINKS there's a virus where there really isn't one. Disabling your anti-virus tray probably won't help. You'll either need to completely remove your anti-virus (simplest method) or, if you have a program that allows you to extract ISO files, do so, then add the directory of the extracted ISO folder to your exceptions list. If you don't have an ISO extraction program, it's probably easiest just to uninstall your anti-virus, restart, install the game, then reinstall your anti-virus.
3. If you get an error message telling you to support game developers, don't worry. Your game should be installed correctly in the place you put it.
4. Copy the cracked content on the iso to the install directory and play."

,elcapizzo,2010-05-06T17:50Z,"Works for me, well the first mission so far.

This torrent is good, instructions are a little off though.

This is what I had to do:

1. Mount disk ISO using Daemon tools.
2. Open disk contents
3. Run ""steambackup"" and point it towards your storage location e.g. C: > Programs > Games. I had steam installed on my second drive and chose the steam folder, not sure if that is required.
4. Let it extract.
5. Click ok on the ""support game developers"" thing.
6. Copy all the contents of the ""crack"" folder on the disk image into the newly copied ""JustCause2"" folder on your computer.
7. Play!

Sounds like a lot of work, but it probably took me about 5 minutes to work it out and 10 minutes to do it all and have the game up and running.

I didn't get any virus warnings, using Avast here.

The game seems OK, it's more geared to Xbox players than PC players. Platform adventure sort of game, graphics aren't that great, gameplay and control mechanics are a bit clunky. Compared to games on PC like Bioshock 2, this is crap. However I will give it a crack and see if I can get into it. It's only a 4GB file so not too big."

but it's not compatible with XP,

to install this, you have to TURN OFF
your anti-virus,

it sees the installer as threat when it really is not.
damn this game is great!

All of extremezone's torrents are working.
based on my experience."
,bLoWsMokE,2010-05-07T19:39Z,"No there really is something wrong with the Just cause two torrents. Play through the game once or twice and you will start tyo notice little bugs that shouldn't be there. It also creats steam executables in your directory folder...... it contains a trajan... the game will work and you will be able to play thye hole thing but little things will start to mess up like  the faction people wont take off when you jump on there car...

If you too have this problem, then do this:

Boot a random program in a window, then boot Just Cause. Then you start new game, and when it freezes, use Alt-Tab. Then it will go to the other program. Use Alt-Tab again, and the problem is solved, he plays the first mission."

""File corrupted!. This program has been manipulated and maybe it's infected by a Virus or cracked. This file won't work anymore.""

According to ""File corrupted"" I assumed the file was corrupted since I already disabled antivirus (Comodo Antivirus Free). There are no blocked as stated on main window of Comodo.

I redownloaded and did the same as above. As result was the same error.

Any idea how to fix this error?

Any help appreciated.

1. I had to put dirext 1.3 dll into the Just cause 2 Folder

But still Just Cause 2 did not work.

I've downloaded Just Cause 2 crack fix reloaded. I did not solve the issue. I had a black screen upon lauch. Once, JC 2 tells me before crashing steam should be running to play JC2.

So I installed steam from the Iso. When prompted to update I cancelled.

And now JC 2 works fine with my xbox controller on Win7 64.

Note : you can play in your language by replacing ""english"", for exemple by ""french"", in the file ""language.txt"" in the just cause 2 folder.

1. Mount the image
2. Add steambackup.exe to your anitvirus exeptions (in avg go to ""tools > advanced settings > resident shield > excluded files) or as i did, exclude the whole directory of the mounted disc
3. Select folder to install to
4. After it has installed copy the files in the ""crack"" folder on the mounted disc to the ""Just Cause 2"" folder on your hard disk, overwriting them
5. Run the game by clicking JustCause2.exe
6. If it crashes or hangs on a blank screen, go to the installation folder on your hard disk, there should be a folder called ""directx"", run DXSETUP.exe and install that version of DirectX.

,KrazyK89,2010-06-24T14:07Z,"- How 2 Install - (It worked for me using Vista 64 bit) BTW The game runs great, I haven't gotten any crashes & I've been playing close to 2 hours.

1. After downloading this torrent use DAEMON Tools Lite to mount ""rld-jc2.ico"" which is located in the folder you just downloaded. Link to get DAEMON Tools Lite: 

http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads

2. After mounting the ""rld-jc2.ico"" using DAEMON Tools Lite go to Computer & Install by double clicking the mounted image which should look like the JC2 disc is loaded on a drive. (Install took me like 10min)

3. After installing go to Computer & Explore by right clicking on the mounted image to find the folder ""crack"" Once you find it then copy the crack files. 

4. Go to the folder you installed the game at & inside paste the crack & replace. 

5. Create a desktop shortcut of the JustCause2.exe & play the game!

Note: Add Steambackup.exe to your anitvirus exceptions (In AVG - tools/advanced settings/resident shield/excluded files) I had to do this in order to install the game. AVG also wouldn't let me paste the crack & I didn't know what to do, so I un-installed the garbage. lol

Other Notes: Every-time I quit the game to windows I got a message saying ""Steam needs to be running to play Just Cause 2"" or something like that... I fixed it by just adding Just Cause 2 to Steam."

,Syltsorc,2010-06-26T12:29Z,"Ok its simple, if you mount the iso and get any kind of error msg its your antivirus that stops the autorun funtion of the crackprogram.

1. temporarily disable antivirus protection

2. remount the iso (or reenter the burnt dvd) and the crackprogram should start up ""its a small window with music playing in the background""

3. choose where to install the game and let the program do its thing

4. when the program is done open the mounted iso (or burnt dvd) and copy the contents of the crackfolder in to the main folder of the game, let it replace the files when asked

5. play the game, if it still doesnt work check of your system is upp to standard, if you still cant play it there try to redownload"

,crossebby,2010-07-04T14:11Z,"HERE IS THE SIMPLE STEPS TO INSTALL THE GAME: on W7X86 version+HD48501GB version

Click on ""steam backup.exe"". I am using NIS2010 its also reports that its ""trozan"", I just turn off the antivirus before extracting(becoz its deleting after extracting.)

When U click on the ""steam backup.exe"" it will ask U to select the game folder, I created ""just cause 2"" folder in programm files, and selected it for installation. 

The installation takes about 4 minutes. A message appears "" if U like the game then BUY IT to support............."".

Now copy the ""crack"" contents(U downloaded in this torrent), and copy them to the ""just cause 2"" folder located in Ur ""programm files"".

Now U can turn on Ur ""antivirus and firewall"".

--------------------------------------------------------

NOTES: Most of US facing ""no signal input"" or ""out of range"" message on Ur moniter after starting the game. U can solve this problem as below.

open the ""just cause 2"" game launcher properties, and in the ""compatability"" option select ""run in 640x480 resolution"" and click on ""OK"".

Now start the game, Ur moniter also swithces to 640x480 resolution(ok its little wiered), still the moniter says ""no signal or out of range "" message.( incase if U still on Ur desktop click on the game button on the taks bar to go the game). Now press ctrl+alt+delete, and clost the game in the ""task manager.

Now open the ""documents"", and U will defnetly see  ""sqare enix>just cause 2>saves>JC2settings"" delete this file.(U can't see this file with out opening the game for the first time)

Now U can start the game, there will be no more issues any more. But U gotta delete this file again and again every time when the PC shuts down when U playing this game. So keep it in mind.

Good luck boys."

Re-Install the Game and use this:

-After mounting the image you need to Explore the mounted image: Computer/right click on JustCause2/Explore then scroll down and click the steambackup.exe to install (a installer will appear while playing background music)

-After installing Copy & Paste the Crack contents (Only the JustCause2.exe & steam_api.dll) in the same folder that you installed the game which should have the JustCause2.exe. Make sure to replace the files when you Paste the Crack contents into the game file.

-Create a shortcut and play! :)"

There is no key, man. Don't read the README, it tells you how to install it legitimately, which aren't the instructions for this cracked version. You're supposed to run the program STEAMBACKUP.EXE.

,gwodus,2010-08-10T02:03Z,"Wasn't working for me. Kept asking me for a serial key during install. Downloaded the Skidrow Version now. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5460370/Just.Cause.2.Proper-SKIDROW-%5Btracker.BTARENA.org%5D.iso . That one worked flawless. No steam bullshit. Install, copy crack, run. Like it's supposed to be."
,lazonby,2010-08-10T15:33Z,"I have Steam installed already.

1. Mount the ISO

2. Install it to C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common

3. Copy the contents from the cracked folder you got from the torrent into the Just Cause 2 folder that gets installed in the common directory.

4. Create a desktop shortcut from said directory for easy access.

5. Play

There is no CD key needed, nor should it ask for one. Steam does not need to be running. The game does not show up in the Steam games list when logged in. If the above does not work, possibly if you do not have Steam, you may need to run the steambackup.exe first.

Now a question: How do you uninstall it? It does not show up on the Programs list in Win7."
,Ishaboo,2010-08-10T23:09Z,"@lazonby: The way I usually delete games that don't show up in my Win 7 Program list is to find where you installed the game and delete EVERYTHING in there. Oh, and delete the .iso since that takes up 4 GBs in this case since the game is 4GB."

works perfectly... windows 7 x64 amd quad x4 620

just mount and click.. 

install steam first and make an account then its gona start installing the game and will ask you for a key.. cancell and exit  


Ok yeah, I just finished the download and yes it is, steambackup.exe, just run it and pick your directory, whatever directory you pick it will add a folder ""Just Cause 2"" into that directory and install the game there, than just copy over the contents of the crack folder into that ""just Cause 2"" directory.

made my day with this post ............ for RMJ13

RMJ, please shut the fuck up, your ""idiot"" is showing, you're about as cool and as elite as a kindergarten student, your little snot nosed pissant allowance-made shitbox is nothing to be proud of, and just the fact you're so ready to announce all the retarded info you cooked up in your head is even more proof that you are about as knowledgeable in computers as my grandmother, 14 years of tech experience? fuck, you'd have to be older than 14 for that to actually work.

Also, you're not impressing anyone, this isn't 98' we're not on AOL with shitty HP pc's waiting for pictures to load completely, everyone and their mother has a good PC these days, and the fact you feel the need to brag that you have one only shows that you're completely new to this, what? mommy finally bought you that alienware for birthday? shut the fuck up............ for RMJ13"

,lolcheese,2010-08-28T01:09Z,"ATTENTION TO ALL WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE:

This is a good torrent! But you idiots cant figure out basic torrenting 101. YOU MUST HAVE STEAM INSTALLED FOR THIS TO WORK.

For Windows Xp/Vista/7

1. MOUNT THE ISO WITH A MOUNTING PROGRAM, DONT EXTRACT AND RUN THE .EXE

2. THEN THE STEAMBACKUP LOADER WILL OPEN UP, WITH AWESOME TECHNO MUSIC.

3. HAVE IT SELECT STEAM/STEAMAPPS/COMMON SO IT CAN INSTALL THE FILES TO THERE.

4. IF A ERROR SAYS ""SUPPORT THE GAME"". THEN THAT MEANS IT WENT OKAY AND THE FILES INSTALLED SUCCESSFULLY.

5. THEN OPEN UP THE .ISO AND COPY EVERYTHING IN THE CRACK FOLDER TO THE JUST CAUSE 2 INSTALLATION FOLDER. INCLUDING THE EXE, THE STEAM FILE, AND THE LANGUAGE.EXE

6. THEN DOUBLE CLICK ON THE CRACKED .EXE AND WAIT AWHILE. If it doesn't open at first, it takes a while to open up. So be patient.

7. THEN ENJOY THE GAME.

If you dont have a commons folder in steam, then make one. You dont have to run steam while playing it. Steam shouldint run while playing it. If you install and steam opens up with an activation code. THEN YOUR DOING SOMETHING WRONG. 

Like stated:

DONT EXTRACT THE .ISO TO THE FOLDER AND RUN THE SETUP .EXE. Use an ISO program to mount it.

If it still doesn't work, then I dont know what to tell you."
,Darth_Adversor,2010-08-28T03:03Z,"When downloading any sort of torrent, I tend to ignore a lot of the negative comments, because they're mostly from noobs who have little knowledge on how to install these programs.  I've been doing this for years and have never really had any problems getting whatever program I downloaded to work.  That being said...

This torrent is a turd.  Maybe it does really work for some, I don't know.  It doesn't work for me.  Windows 7 x64, Phenom II 955, 4GB DDR3, 2x 4870's XFire.  From going through most of the 46 pages of comments, I was able to identify 2 different methods of installing the game, but ultimately, neither worked.  I get right up to launching the game, and after a few seconds, all I get is a Windows error message saying the program has crashed.  

A lot of people seem to be reporting better luck with the Skid Row release.  We'll see.  "
,lolcheese,2010-08-28T20:55Z,"@ Darth, I honestly dont know whats wrong with you here. You have similar specs as me (but minus the xfire radeons, I just have 1 big 5770). But I am using the x86 version of windows 7 (Which ever one is 32bit). Maybe this isint from the torrent. It could be another issue. Try to install official patches for the game."
,Darth_Adversor,2010-08-29T01:47Z,"@ lolcheese

Yep, you're running the 32-bit version of Windows.  I'm starting to think the problem lies with the 64-bit version I'm running, but then I've seen a few posts where people report it's working fine with their x64 version, so...I honestly have no clue.  

I have a host of programs and games that have all been downloaded and I'm always able to get them working, which is why this particular one is frustrating me so much.  It's personal now.  lol

I saw a couple of posts talking about extracting the .iso with a program called Phoenix...I'm unfamiliar with it.  Anyone care to comment on this?  

BTW, no joy with the Skid Row version either.  Same problem...launch the game, get a white screen, followed by an error message a couple seconds later.  And yes, I'm running it as admin...

,Danielzxzx,2010-08-29T15:02Z,"I seem to have a problem. I started to install the game and did everything it told me to do like log in to my steam account but then it wanted to know the game's product code. I don't know the code. I know I have to use the crack over top of the original after the game is installed but the game is not installed because everytime I click autorun, it tells me to install the game so that means it is still not installed so I can't use the crack yet. Now I can't get any further without knowing the product code. Now everytime I choose to install the game now, it skips straight to the product code section, the first time I tried to install it told me to do other stuff like log in and where the game should be installed I think or maybe that was where steam is going to be installed. So anyway, game is not installed so I can't use the crack and I need to know the product code, is there some file in the torrent that has the code that I might have missed? Is the game really installed and I just don't think it is? Where does the game get installed?"

FOR ANYONE HAVING PROBLEMS GETTING THE GAME TO LAUNCH:

Head to Microsoft.com and make sure your DirectX drivers are fully up to date.  Fixed my problem.

I'm using the SKID ROW release, but since the problem I was having was identical no matter which one I tried, I'm assuming the RELOADED version works fine, too.  

There's been enough people posting directions on how to install, go back and read the comments.  But if you do everything right and the game still won't launch, even money says it's your DirectX drivers."

*Update your graphics drivers by going to nvidia or ati (This fixes the GPU Water simulation freeze)
*Water on low (it has no effect on any other setting
*bokeh filter set to OFF as it seems to change nothing
*Geometry to low or very high (any other setting has no effect)

1) TURN OFF ANTI VIRUS (THIS RELEASE IS NUKED AND ITS BETTER TO DOWNLOAD SKIDROW'S VERSION)

2) Run ""steambackup.exe"" an error will come up, but ignore it. The game is installed.

3) Download skidrow crack and missing files - google JC2 reloaded missing files.

4) Copy and replace the missing files

5) Run JCgame.exe select language and then exit. This is the trojan which makes your anti virus stop installing.

6) Delete the above file and use the exe JC2 to run the game.

7) You can now turn your anti virus back on. Have fun with this awesome game."

,spencer05,2010-09-26T19:43Z,"IT WORKS FINE FOR ME, VISTA 64X

ATTENTION TO ALL WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE:

This is a good torrent! But you idiots cant figure out basic torrenting 101. YOU MUST HAVE STEAM INSTALLED FOR THIS TO WORK.

For Windows Xp/Vista/7

1. MOUNT THE ISO WITH A MOUNTING PROGRAM, DONT EXTRACT AND RUN THE .EXE

2. THEN THE STEAMBACKUP LOADER WILL OPEN UP, WITH AWESOME TECHNO MUSIC.

3. HAVE IT SELECT STEAM/STEAMAPPS/COMMON SO IT CAN INSTALL THE FILES TO THERE.

4. IF A ERROR SAYS ""SUPPORT THE GAME"". THEN THAT MEANS IT WENT OKAY AND THE FILES INSTALLED SUCCESSFULLY.

5. THEN OPEN UP THE .ISO AND COPY EVERYTHING IN THE CRACK FOLDER TO THE JUST CAUSE 2 INSTALLATION FOLDER. INCLUDING THE EXE, THE STEAM FILE, AND THE LANGUAGE.EXE

6. THEN DOUBLE CLICK ON THE CRACKED .EXE AND WAIT AWHILE. If it doesn't open at first, it takes a while to open up. So be patient.

7. THEN ENJOY THE GAME.

If you dont have a commons folder in steam, then make one. You dont have to run steam while playing it. Steam shouldint run while playing it. If you install and steam opens up with an activation code. THEN YOUR DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

Like stated:

DONT EXTRACT THE .ISO TO THE FOLDER AND RUN THE SETUP .EXE. Use an ISO program to mount it.

If it still doesn't work, then I dont know what to tell you. "

If you already have steam, make sure to file->exit out, not X out, (it runs in the background,)

Some other notes; I had Avira running during the install and I just clicked ""ignore"" during the 4-5 ""warning"" messges that popped up. No, its not a virus, but it is a crack so don't be alarmed during the install process.

the game works well. and on my gtx285 it can run it on maximum specs with no lag. beautiful game.  once I can afford it, I'm pretty sure I'll buy a legit copy.

,CRRPGMyk,2011-02-05T14:20Z,"incase some1 didnt get it right yet,then ill try to explain my best,cuz it also took me some time to figure it out:
after downloading,either mount the file or unrar it with WinRar/7zip or an equivalent program.Start up the 'autorun' which should install steam on your PC(you should login or create an account first-dont worry,its simple and fast) and after that it should ask you for the product code of JC2.cancel the installation now,and run steambackup.exe.Install it to Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common (if you dont have the common folder,create it).Note that UNLESS you install it to common,the installed files wont appear,so its useless to try and install it somewhere else.After youve done installing it to common,open the Crack folder in the downloaded file and copy the 3 files onto Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Just Cause 2.You should be able to play now :D"

What do I do? 

Answer:
When you see that window ""bay the game"" DONT CLICK TO THE ""OK"" BUTTON.
If you click to the OK button the installed files will be erased.
Just pull out the computer from the electrick socket. 
If you just stop your computer this dialog boy can't ereas anything.
Then switch on your computer again and copy the cracked files to the game's folder.

1) download and install Daemon Tools Lite.

3) locate a file named steambackup.EXE, open this (if you cannot open it, either disable your antivirus or run as administrator, if problem persists run the troubleshooting options to find the problem)
4) choose where you want to save the game, a folder named Just Cause 2 will be created so don't bother making one.

,jordanidk,2011-05-20T03:21Z,"Okay got my problem fixed. Here is how to install the game and possibly fix the black screen problem alot of people are having. This is without using ANY other torrent.

1. Mount ISO with daemon tools. If you don't know how to mount, go to google and type mount with daemon tools guide..I'm not going to explain it here.
2. Close any pop ups that the computer will give you asking what to do with the file. Click my computer. Right click the virtual drive that has JC2 mounted and click open.
3. Look for STEAMBACKUP.EXE. Then RUN IT AS ADMIN IF YOU DO NOT THIS WILL NOT WORK!
4. Select an install DIR in this case it's C:/program files.
5. Wait until you get an error telling you to buy the game and click ok, the game will still be installed wherever you selected as the install DIR.
6. Open the virtual drive where the ISO is mounted again and open the crack folder. Copy all 3 files to the install directory. In this case C:/Program files and replace the existing ones.
7.  Go back to C:/Program files/Just cause 2(Or wherever you selected to install it) and go to the dxdiag folder. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, IF YOU DON'T YOU MAY FIND BLACK SCREENS AND TERRIBLE LOAD TIMES, EVEN IF YOU HAVE DX ALREADY, INSTALL THIS AS WELL!
8. Once DXDIAG is installed go to the just cause.exe in the install dictory, right click, click compatibility and select run as admin, click apply and then exit.
9. Click the .exe and if you followed step 8 it'll ask for admin rights. Give these or YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAVE!
10. Enjoy :)"
,jordanidk,2011-05-20T03:31Z,"Additional tips:

If your already in game and have played a little then find you can't save, don't panic and don't quit the game. You can enable saving while still in game. Alt + Ctrl + Del to windows while paused, go to the install directory. Right click then click security.  Edit each one of the users/things that are on the list and give them ALL FULL ACCESS RIGHTS. You will now be able to save without running as admin. After saving exit and follow step 8.

This does not work with windows XP in ANYWAY regardless of your CPU. If you have XP, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING THIS GAME!

If while in game at the starting screen you get a black screen or bad load times, REPEAT STEP SEVEN, it's probably because a dx file is missing!

I faught with this torrent virtually all day because I had black screens between each load screen. Updated my graphic drivers, gave admin rights, spent hours on google and finally all I had to do was install the directx from the game folder.

Great game, thanks for uploading :) will probably play it all the way through. 


Posting a comment on here took me 5 attempts..geeze."
,scourge257,2011-05-20T07:18Z,"Another tip if you're having a black screen at startup(with sounds perfectly running) or you're getting ""monitor out of range"" is:

Do not try to set the Anti-Aliasing and V-sync.

Mine is set to 4x AA and V-sync ON.

-Been experimenting for several hours just to make this game seamlessly working.

If this doesn't fix the blacks screen:
1.) Update your drivers
2.) Install DXDIAG included in the game.
3.) Delete JC2SETTINGS in Documents/square enix/just cause 2/saves"

If you don't know what you're doing, then just shut your mouth. I worked on this torrent for 5 minutes, and got it work, didn't even use Daemon tools.

So, saying worst torrent ever uploaded by someone who made a good working game... is just retarded. Again if you don't know what you're doing just don't post, and from your ignorance and rude comments I'm not even going to post on how to help you, it's as simple as 1-2-3... though

,Aft3rMiDn1Ght,2011-07-19T11:20Z,"@ jeremyn

There you go again, trying to use your brain and failing, has nothing to do with hacking, get a brain you'll understand, download Winrar... and make sure you have ISO checked when installing it.

Can open it up, and run it yourself without having to mount it up on Daemon Tools, I never use a mounting program.

God learn instead of being such an ignorant ass, but that's all I'm helping with, you can figure out the rest since it only took me about 10 mins, and I'm sure a lot of others have had success on it as well."

,Kildorragh96,2011-07-21T08:29Z,"Sorry, but this has got to be the most stressful and least useful torrent I have ever come across. I've been spending 2 hours trying to get this god damn thing to work and it hasn't. First, the little install thing with the flashy music, well it would quit without warning. After running it god knows how many times, I finally got to the ""Support the develepors"" error. But lo behold, I go to the program files (the same program files I told it to install to) and there is nothing there! So again, I run the program, still nothing there, I run it again and change the directory to my user, and for whatever reason it finally decides to work. So just in case I install the directX and vcredist folders just in case, double click exe file of the game, and after about 30 seconds, a glimmer of hope! The game actually starts up! However, I am now at the stage where after selecting new game, the loading screen does not go away. As in, it looks like it's loading fine, except, it never stops loading. So I spend even more times trying to find a fix for THIS, turning off filters and light settings etc in the advanced display settings, only to find that they were already turned off! Then finally I read somewhere that one of the reasons could be ""because I don't have all of the required files from the install"" and so now I have finally given up and looked for a more reliable torrent.

Apologies for my frustration, I probably am doing something wrong, but I'm used to being able to open torrent, install game, copy crack, and play.

Thanks for all of your previous work, but I was very disappointed with this torrent.

Also it could be something to do with the fact that this is the first pirated game I've downloaded have had anything to do with Steam, so if there is something I'm missing please do tell, although I am quite sure I've done everything in the instructions and more.

Rant over."

Mount the iso. You don't need to extract it or something, that just gives your antivirus an excuse to remove the installer.

Temporarily disable your antivirus. Don't trust it? Download something else/buy it.

Run Steambackup.exe from the mounted iso. Choose C:\Games or where ever you install your games, the Just Cause 2-folder will be created automatically.

Copy the cracked content to your brand new Just Cause 2-folder.

And that's that.

Could this have been made any more complicated? i have downloaded many other games without a single hiccup.

Double clicking the steambackup.exe does literally nothing whatsoever, i managed to get that keygen box with the music open once but it stopped halfway.

You know what the problem is? Your shitty antivirus picking up false positives. Learn your shit before you slag off another persons torrents. 

On another note, thanks Extremezone. Your torrents are the shit. "
,Mrpepperson,2012-02-23T05:34Z,"Hello everyone!

How to install and what you need to know:

First things first, most of your anti viruses will pickup a false positive, being the file you need to install the game. ""steambackup"" 

It is a virus, but not a harmful one, it's the same as a trojan.gen virus, but it doesn't implant itself within your computer. The file does contain a string of characters that matches a string from an actual virus. Don't worry, it's completely safe!

To install: You have to have Windows 7 because XP doesn't support DirectX10.

1. Mount or burn your disk

2. Run steambackup.exe

3. Browse to the folder you want the game to be in. (It automatically will make a ""Just Cause 2"" folder.)

4. After it's finished, copy the files from the ""crack"" file to your main directory where you installed the game.

5. Play the game

Good luck and have fun!"

Its not in my program folder where I told it to put it, I even ran a search, and windows can't find it. Where the hell did it get put?"
,shmimbadad,2012-02-25T07:16Z,"okay i found it, deleted it, and reinstalled it somewhere that made sense, and it seems to be working, except i can't save. No reason, it just says ""save failed"" when I try to save. Any special trick for this one? Do you have to be signed into a games for windows account? If so, how do I do that? There doesn't seem to be a menu for it in this game."

,Deeladeda,2012-03-05T02:07Z,"This took such a long effing time to work but I've finally installed it. S: It is not fake and it does not contain a virus or trojan.. :L If you're having any problems, follow the instructions below which are basically just WifoutTeefs post on page 5 and jordanidks post on page 53, so thank you both for helping me!

Once the torrent has finished downloading choose to disable your anti virus. You should be able to right click your anti virus icon on the taskbar and have a choice to disable it, but if you don't know how then Google will be able to help.

1. Click Start, open ""My Computer"" or ""Computer"" and create a new file path which is where you will install Just Cause 2: C:Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common

2. Mount the ""rld-jc2"" ISO with whatever program you usually use, DAEMON Tools, etc.

3. Click Start, open ""My Computer"" or ""Computer"" and right click the virtual drive that you have mounted then click ""Open"".

4. Find the Application with the name ""steambackup"" or ""steambackup.exe"", right click it and choose ""Run as administrator"".

5. A message will pop up asking you to select the install directory. This directory is the path you created first: C:Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common

6. Wait for the installer and when an error message pops up with ""Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT!"" click ""Ok"".

7. Go back to ""My Computer"" or ""Computer"", right click the virtual drive and choose ""Open"". Go to the ""crack"" folder and copy all 3 files to the install directory: C:Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Just Cause 2 and replace the existing files.

8. Open up: C:Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Just Cause 2 and go to the ""directX"" folder. Click ""DXSETUP"" and install the application.

9. Once this is installed, go back to the Just Cause 2 folder, right click ""JustCause2"" or ""JustCause2.exe"", choose ""Properties"", go to the ""Compatibility"" tab, check the ""Run this program as an administrator"" box and click apply.

10. Double click ""JustCause2"" or ""JustCause2.exe"" and a new file called ""Justcause2.exe.3872.STEAMSTART"" or something similar will be created and the game will start.

Have fun playing! :)"

Please stop commenting that there is a virus. There really isn't.

Again, your AV is reporting a false positive. ignore it, install the game and enjoy.

Thank you."

,ACRkiller,2012-04-08T06:06Z,"Jeez...Now I got another error like someone mentioned before about :
Fatal DirectX error!
Code: 15
Result: 0x80070057: E_INVALIDARG

The game will now exit. Try starting the game with /failsafe if problem persists. 

What do I do????????????"

,GJSsucks,2012-04-20T08:05Z,"Support of software companies. If you Play this game, buy it! -ERROR"
,sirtokesalot420,2012-04-20T21:59Z,"   To those getting the save failed problem either remember to always run the justcause2.exe as an administrator by right clicking on the exe and selecting that every time you launch the game or going into properties then compatibility and mark it as always run as administrator to permanently fix the error. 
   To those getting the ""Fatal DirectX error"" I believe that is your graphics card either can't handle it or you lack a graphics card altogether(integrated) which would be a problem only upgrading hardware can fix.
   I don't have that nice of a computer but the game still runs flawlessly, so dont worry if your rigs a few years old, you just may have to turn a few settings down. 
   Thanks for a great torrent, extremezone. "

1 - Mount image. Then Run Steambackup

4 - Open iso again but this time go into the folders and open the CRACK folder. Copy contents of Crack folder into your game directory - program files (x86)/Just Cause 2 (where ever you installed the game to)
