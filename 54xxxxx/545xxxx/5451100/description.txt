Queen At The Opera[mp3 320][ICM369]
___________________________________


Though they began their career practicing an artier, more theatrical 
variant on Led Zeppelins heavy rock sound, Queen was always capable 
of much more. 

Ultimately, Freddie and the boys were popsters at heart, and capable 
ones to boot. 

The album title is probably a reference to the FM rock anthem 
Bohemian Rhapsody, which begins as an existential ballad before 
moving into a mock-operatic section featuring scores of overdubbed 
Freddie Mercurys.

Rhapsody is just the tip of the iceberg here. Lazing on a Sunday 
Afternoon is a music-hall ditty that owes a debt to the Kinks. '39 
is a surprisingly poignant folk-rocker written and sung y Brian May. 
Youre My Best Friend is pure 70s AM melodic pop. 
Queen even ventures into vaudeville territory (given Mercurys show-
biz leanings, not as much of a stretch as one might think) on the 
fatalistic, old-timey "Good Company." 

There are several souped-up rockers here as well, but its A NIGHT AT 
THE OPERAs winning stylistic experimentation that makes it a milestone 
in Queen history.

Queen were straining at the boundaries of hard rock and heavy metal on 
Sheer Heart Attack, but they broke down all the barricades on A Night 
at the Opera, a self-consciously ridiculous and overblown hard rock 
masterpiece. 

Using the multi-layered guitars of its predecessor as a foundation, 
A Night at the Opera encompasses metal, pop. campy British music hall 
eventually bringing it all together on the pseudo-operatic Bohemian Rhapsody. 

In short, its a lot like Queens own version of Led Zeppelin IV, but where 
Zep find dark menace in bombast, Queen celebrate their own pomposity. 

No one in the band takes anything too seriously, otherwise the arrangements 
wouldn't be as ludicrously exaggerated as they are. But the appeal -- and the
influence -- pf A Night at the Opera is in its detailed, meticulous productions. 

Its prog rock with a sense of humor as well as dynamics, and Queen never 
bettered their approach anywhere else.
