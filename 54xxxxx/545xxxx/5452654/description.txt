They must have mastered this dvd from the vhs version because the quality is about that of a vhs video capture. That said, it's good enough for a guitar lesson and the audio quality is better than the vhs version.

One thing I liked about this dvd is the option to see the exercises at half speed but at normal pitch. It's the first dvd I've used with that feature and it's nice for the first couple attempts at hard licks.

Because the original wasn't that sharp, I sharpened it slightly and recompressed the video. The video quality is slightly better than the original and the dvd is 1gb smaller :)
