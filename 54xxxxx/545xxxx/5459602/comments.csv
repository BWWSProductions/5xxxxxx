[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2010-04-02T05:20Z,"FYI: Permanent Waves and A Farewell to Kings are swapped. Haven't heard the rest to know if there are any other kerfuffles.
The audio quality is super, of course. FLAC perfection goodness, plus no skips or any other errors so far."
,MJKW2Ab,2010-08-06T07:01Z,"Big Rush fan here, at least from my youth. Can somebody advise is this the entire Discology of all of Rush's STUDIO music that has been released, not counting all of the compilation remakes they had?

Also with another Rush torrent it seems many files were converted to MP3 then to Flac. I trust that has not been an issue with this one, eh?

So far this looks like a winner. Wish more were seeding. Thanks willrain!"
,MJKW2Ab,2010-08-06T07:03Z,"Opps, I mis-typed. I see the LIVE albums here too, so can one say this collection is ALL of Rush's RETAIL CDs (studio and live) minus the compilations which had the same songs repackaged? Looks good. "
,MJKW2Ab,2010-08-13T10:01Z,"THANKS!! FLAC RULES!!!!!!!!!
Were any of these CDs made from Gold plated souce discs?"
,MJKW2Ab,2010-08-18T06:45Z,This is the largest 100% Flac (All were tested for being direct Flac copies of the CDs with AudioChecker) - The quality of this set is lightyears ahead of most other rush collection uploads. Thanks willrain for this! It sounds flawless.
,MJKW2Ab,2010-08-26T03:44Z,"I know many Rush fans that can not find the studio REMASTERED set (which is 7 albums I believe). We tested and found THREE Rush Remastered Albums within the following link below. Please be advised to ONLY CHECK and download the albums you need as many discs in the following url have albums on flac which used MP3s as source.  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4612718/Rush-_Discography 

FOR THE TRUE RUSH REMASTERED LOSSLESS COPIES (Not found in this collection) ONLY DOWNLOAD THESE THREE RUSH REMASTERED CDs AS THEY TESTED ALL AT OR NEAR 100% probability of being from source of pure lossless CDDA from this torrent (url):
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4612718/Rush-_Discography 

1 RUSH Remastered(First Album)
2 RUSH 2112 Remastered 
3 Rush Rush Permanent Waves Remastered

All other Remastered Albums within the torrent at link above tested as having a MP3 Source."

(Wish I could speak russian :D)"
,tex99999,2011-01-18T05:44Z,@MJKW2AB there are no LIVE albums here
,viragored,2011-02-19T04:49Z,"Wow - great collection, great sound, all tags in place and copious artwork extras.  Thanks a whole lot for this :-)"
,didactandnarpet,2011-03-27T09:08Z,Audiochecker is telling me that some tracks are mp3s... mostly all on Grace Under Pressure.  However it could be false positives based on the way the album was mix/mastered.  Willrain your Dream Theater and Muse torrents were perfect so I'm gonna trust you on this one.  Just wanted to point out my findings.  Anyway thanks for all this.  You rock
,KGN-004,2011-10-25T08:04Z,"Um, the album marked as ""A Farewell To Kings"" is not so. It's Permanent Waves. The song marked as ""Closer to the Heart"" is actually ""Jacob's Ladder"", the song marked as ""Xanadu"" is actually ""Freewill"", e.t.c....

But beside that the torrent's fine. I think..."
,KGN-004,2011-10-25T08:30Z,"Yeah, it seems you got mixed up and switched around the album and track titles of ""A Farewell to Kings"" and ""Permanent Waves"".

But it's still all there. :)"
,ja_iom_jedi,2012-06-22T12:12Z,"Awesome Torrent and great tagging, art etc. There is the problem mentioned that Permanent Waves and Farewell... are tagged the wrong way round, but that's easy to fix and swap the art between folders. Major kudos to the uploader and decent speed too. Will seed 5.0 as a thanks. Cheers mate"
