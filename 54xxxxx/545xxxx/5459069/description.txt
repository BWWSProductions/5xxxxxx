My personal DVD rip of Disney's Fantasia movies.

Includes Fantasia 1940 and Fantasia 2000.

2-pass hifi x264 encoded with HandBrake and includes original AC3 (5.0 for Fantasia 1940) and DTS (5.1 for Fantasia 2000) soundtracks plus stereo mixdounw AAC audio tracks for convenience, plus a few director comments soundtracks for your documentation.

Matroska (MKV) files also includes semantic chapter marks and names for your fast skips.

Matroska files also includes original textual english closed captions from DVD, original VOBSUB english and french subtitles from DVD and OpenSubtitle.org's portuguese textual subtitles.

Since Fantasia was not released as Blueray yet (2010), this is the best Fantasia movies rip available for sure.
