    PreFab UI Actions brings "universal attachability" to                 
    AppleScript, greatly enhancing your control over applications         
    running on your computer. Attach a UI Action script to any            
    standard native Mac OS X application, and UI Actions will             
    automatically run the script whenever you perform specified user      
    actions in the target application. You select the user actions        
    that trigger a UI Action script, such as choosing a menu item,        
    changing the value of a text field, opening a drawer or window,       
    and activating an application.

      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
