NEWSFLASH: From February 20. I entered Mode Three in initial-seeding phase. In short, it means initial seeding "by the numbers" (as written in almost forgotten Rules): the swarm will get exactly as it should be: total exchange between peers divided by the number of peers (seeding=exchange/peers). 
It counts How much you share (give) to other peers and how fast is your upload to others (don't worry, these are the bytes you got from me and others, not "yours").
So, my dear fellows, step on the breaks even harder - you'll get nowhere. 


SUBTITLES: external, English, English for hearing impaired.
