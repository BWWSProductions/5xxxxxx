plot:
After a bull is killed in a bullfight, its body parts are transported 
across Spain, France, Italy and Belgium. The bull's parts fall into the
wide variety of people, including: an Italian actress selling the bones 
in a supermarket promotion, a Spanish woman who dines on its steaks, a 
little girl in France who imagines a world where animals are much larger
than humans, and a taxidermist whose wife is simultaneously giving birth
 to quintuplets.
