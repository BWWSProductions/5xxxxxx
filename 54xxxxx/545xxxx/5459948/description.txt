Scorpions - Live at Wacken Fest 2006
Shot at the Wacken Open Air Festival  
Wacken,Germany  08/03/2006

One of the longest running acts in heavy metal, the Scorpions, celebrate both their long history, and some of their most beloved past members, in this 2006 performance at the famed Wacken outdoor arena in Hamburg, Germany. 

Billed as `A Night to Remember, A Journey Through Time', the performance features guest appearances by past members Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker and Herman Rarebell. The set list was partially based on input from the fans, and features many of the classics, with a few surprise selections.

It's probably the best Scorpions concert you'll ever get to see in your living room.
