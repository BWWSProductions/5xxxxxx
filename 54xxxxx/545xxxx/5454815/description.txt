Wikipedia - "One for Sorrow" is a song by Steps, which became the group's first single to make it to the Top 5 on the UK charts. Debuting at #2 and spending 11 weeks on the British charts, this song firmly established Steps's intention to revive the ABBA sound; in fact its chord progression in the chorus is almost identical to that of ABBA's "The Winner Takes It All". A remixed version of this song is also featured on the Drive Me Crazy movie soundtrack and released in the U.S. during the summer of 1999 when Steps opened for Britney Spears.
