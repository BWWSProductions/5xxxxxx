,boysie,2010-03-24T15:12Z,"Mine keeps falling over when I try to use the sliders. I haven't rebooted yet, though."
,ramachandra,2010-03-25T02:23Z,'boysie' I have same problem 
,boysie,2010-03-25T14:46Z,"Yes, there's definitely an issue here. It was better when I rebooted, but just when you think you're OK, it bins out on you. You can work with it, but my suggestion is to constantly save your project. Great piece of software, if you can live with the glitch. I'll report back, if I find a cure."
,AndyWallis,2010-03-25T19:45Z,"Crashes out when using sliders under Windows 7, works perfect on my old laptop running XP. Thanks very much for this version, been looking for it for ages, far better than v6"
,AndyWallis,2010-03-25T20:02Z,"Follow up to earlier post -  
I can't think why didn't I think of it before! 
Set the program to run under XP compatibility  mode in the properties menu. It now works a treat under Windows 7 on my desktop computer. "

,grtday,2010-03-30T23:54Z,"Got it and thanks!  Worked great until I downloaded the update to V 9.6.  Then, I demanded a ""Token"".  
I had to uninstall all and reinstall.
Any ideas on how to design the ""Token"" so the update will work?  Keygen perhaps?
Thanks again!"
,puck1279,2010-04-22T06:37Z,"I'm having the same crash issue, on xp... as if there's a cut off on how much you can use the sliders... I'd agree, save OFTEN...

Also, might want to specify which file to install and then replace for the newer folks to this game. I used the installer and replaced with the other exe"

But I've managed to get it to stop... However I used the SHOTGUN method (more than one change at a time) so I can't tell you what exactly it was that worked. First I (as recommended) had my XP start it in 98 compatibility mode and disable Visual Themes. #2. I went into the apps settings and (FILE, SETTINGS) and the COLOR TAB. And ""un-check"" High Performance Display and ""checked"" #3 Always use 16bit display. My guess is that it was #2 and possibly #3 that made the difference... disabling 2 probably dumb'ed down the graphic acceleration.. An old trick when Windows would hang (back in the day). Cool program! Good Luck.. "

,mrblue777,2010-07-11T13:16Z,"This software is working! I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. It first crashed when I moved the sliders too fast. But after changing the compatibility to Windows XP SP3, it works perfectly so far. At first I tried changing it to Windows 98 as suggested by the other user earlier but the OPEN IMAGE button is not working.nnHopefully someone can do something with the latest version 9.7.nnBTW, this is my first post."

,NLAlston,2010-08-17T08:02Z,"Just recently downloaded this, and was quite impressed with the program.  That is, until I began to use the sliders - which always caused the program to crash.   My PC is a Vista64-bit system, and I wonder if that might be an issue within itself (regarding the functionality of this great program).

Also, being very new to this, what is the procedure for seeding?"

,rominaabela,2010-12-21T21:40Z,"Great it works ! it took me a day to realize how to replace the file.
so for those who didn't manage this is how :

1. Open the folder you extracted the files in

2. Open the folder in which the program is installed in [ go to my computer, C://, Program files and find portrait professional.]

3. Then copy the PortraitProfessionalStudio.exe file from the first folder you opened [ the one you extracted the files in] and then 

4. copy it in the portrait professional folder that is in program files and 

5. click copy and replace when a window comes up.

Hope this helps!"

,durnkpritae,2011-01-05T02:50Z,"To fix crashes when using the sliders, download:

thanks for sharing mate .
:)"
,durnkpritae,2011-01-16T05:23Z,"OK, I found out the crashing had to do with certain multi-core CPUs. If neither LaunchTest.exe nor Compatibility mode fixes the problem, try restricting the process to 1 CPU core only, through Task Manager -> Set Affinity, OR a custom .cmd file involving ""start /affinity""."

,pjescani_sat,2011-02-19T12:31Z,I set the win95 compatibility mode
,wetWeasel,2011-03-16T16:31Z,"One workable solution (Win 7 64bit Dual core CPU)

After starting the program, load your picture. Before making any alterations, open task manager (Ctrl+Alt+Del) and under the Processes tab, select Portrait Pro. Right click and select ""Affinity"" and only check ONE CPU.

This seems to have fixed it for me without having to run compatibility mode, Administrator, or any of the other fixes suggested here."

,music.muncher,2011-06-18T05:44Z,"Installing Professional Portrait 9 is sooooo easy. Just follow these steps:

1. Check to make sure you have these three items in the extract folder: (a) PortraitProfessionalStudio (identified by the camera icon) (b) PortraitProfessionalStudioSetup (identified by the PC-CD icon), and (c) Read Me First!

2. Install the software using the PortraitProfessionalStudioSetup. Once installation is completed, it will ask for an icon. 

3. Don't panic. Just ignore the message.

4. Go back to your extract folder, and copy the PortraitProfessionalStudio. 

5. For those using Windows, go to My Computer, Drive; Next Local Disc (usually drive C). 

6. Open drive C and look for the Program Files folder. Open this folder and look for the Portrait Professional Studio 9 folder. 

7. Do any of the following: (a) Highlight the Portrait Professional Studio 9 folder and paste by doing Ctrl V (b) Open the Portrait Professional Studio 9 folder and paste by doing Ctrl V.

8. When you receive the prompt ""There is already a file with the same name in this location,"" confirm or choose ""Copy and Replace""

9. Potrait Professional Studio 9 should work now. 

10. Enjoy!"
