,raptor660r,2010-08-03T07:53Z,"usually don't comment for torrents, but ive been looking for some decent S03 episodes for while! just started to download now and hope they burn without missing stupid codecs...never had a problem like his ever but the season 3 episodes i got now. when i burn them it says missing codecs when i try to play the movie on LG BD350C...these are the only ones ive ever had trouble with. so if these have proper codecs, then thanks a million.I will seed what i can after but could u explain how to create torrent? im not a noob when it comes to PC things, im on it a good amount of time between my Xbox too...i have so much to share but need HELP XD"
[T],jonnoel1,2010-08-05T21:54Z,"These are in .avi format. The codecs missing are from the program you are running, not from the files. If you need help creating a torrent, look up the help section of your torrent program (VUSE, bitorrent, utorrent, etc...) I dont know what you are using, but its pretty easy to do. Theres a create torrent option on the browser somewhere, and you just pick the file to upload, create, then on tpb use the upload torrent (on the bottom of the page) and upload the torrent you created. Thanks for seeding this one, good luck on your uploading!"
