[T],data9724,2010-03-22T23:58Z,"Yes, when they're done....#7 is still in retexting, 8-9 still in proofreading, and plan to start on 10-11 in a few days :)."
,ajones81,2010-03-23T00:01Z,"Thanks a lot, will wait for them. Really appreciate the effort in translating these and bringing them to us non-Danish folks. :)"
[T],data9724,2010-03-23T00:06Z,"No worries, it just take a lot of time. I HOPE to finish all 15 this year, but also depend on the prooreading and retexting speed :). But for now, im 2 scans ahead, so can translate a bit :)"
,Ljufa,2010-06-12T15:19Z,I start to worry if your retexter is well :( It's taking so long :(
[T],data9724,2010-06-13T19:35Z,"He is well, but working hard on the full Wake serier, and are using all his time on that. That should hopefully be done in a few weeks, so he can start on all of my stuff :)"
