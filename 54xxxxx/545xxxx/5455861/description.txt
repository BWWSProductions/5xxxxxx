These are all of the YYH OST that have been produced. The only ones that are not included are the karaoke discs (2) and a re-release disc that has the openings and endings along with the karaoke versions for them. Those were not added because really, who the hell wants to listen to that shit?

In any case, there are too many tracks to list. So, OST of interest are: OST 1, OST 2, Movie OST, All Game Ensemble OST, Shitou Ankoku, and the bonus folder.

Also, the other torrent that I uploaded with the YYH stuff is dead. This new torrent has better rips (higher bit-rates) and no corrupted files. Your better off downloading the whole thing again.
