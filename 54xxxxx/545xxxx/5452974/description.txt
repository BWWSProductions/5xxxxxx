    Professor Brian Cox visits some of the most stunning       
    locations on earth to describe how the laws of nature     
    have carved natural wonders across the solar system.     
                                                              
    Brian reveals how something as flimsy as an envelope of    
    gas - an atmosphere - can create some of the most         
    wondrous sights in the solar system. He takes a ride in  
    an English Electric Lightning and flies 18 km up to the   
    top of earth's atmosphere, where he sees the darkness      
    of space above and the thin blue line of our atmosphere   
    below. In the Namib desert in south-west Africa, he      
    tells the story of Mercury. This tiny planet was          
    stripped naked of its early atmosphere and is fully        
    exposed to the ferocity of space.                         
                                                             
    Against the stunning backdrop of the glaciers of Alaska   
    Brian reveals his fourth wonder: Saturn's moon Titan,      
    shrouded by a murky, thick atmosphere. He reveals that    
    below the clouds lies a magical world. Titan is the      
    only place beyond earth where we've found liquid          
    pooling on the surface in vast lakes, as big as the        
    Caspian Sea, but the lakes of Titan are filled with a     
    mysterious liquid, and are quite unlike anything on      
    earth.
