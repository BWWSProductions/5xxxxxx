I have an unstable connection to the Net, and my client, Deluge 1.2.1 sometimes shut down of itself. So if you between the hours of 0300 and 1200 CET don't get anything, it's because I'm sleeping and the client has shut down. Don't worry though, I'll keep restarting and seeding for a long time, but there WILL also be gaps in upload time..."
,OttifantSir,2010-03-25T20:58Z,"AMAZING1 Half an hour ago, I was the only one seeding this, and NOW? 10 SEEDERS! I was almost convinced I had to seed it alone for the next week....

Anyways, good to see people like it, despite the wild range of codecs and resolutions. Please, give me an evaluation of how it is when you've downloaded it. Especially the Theora/Vorbis-OGV files."
,mcfacker,2010-03-26T06:57Z,"Have tried converting ogv to avi so that Ican burn to DVD, tried AVS Converter, WinFF, AVI2MP4 all failed, Convert X 2 DVD worked but audio is out of sync, OttifanSir upload again in AVI, or sum1 Help me pliz. "
,mcfacker,2010-03-26T06:58Z,"Great Upload Thanxz, but still need help"
,OttifantSir,2010-03-26T11:44Z,"As you can see from ""The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe"", I was actually starting off with x264-MP3/AC3-AVI, but then on the next episodes, all ripping-tools I had that coded to AVI failed. I love the series, and I knew at least SOME other people would like it to, so to get it up and running, I turned to the last resort (because people don't generally use Theora/Vorbis-OGV): Thoggen. It only rips to those two codecs and that container. I am sorry to hear you can't burn it to standalone DVD-player conpliant DVDs. I know it's possible, I have done it, but don't remember at the moment what I did. I'll investigate what I did, and see if I can help you. However, I might not be able to, due to the fact that I use Ubuntu, not Windows.

As a result, the programs I use, are: 2ManDVD, DeVeDe, DVD Styler, DVD95Converter, dvd::rip, QDVDAuthour, OGMRip, Handbrake, Thoggen, AcidRip. These are rippers and standalone-DVD player compliant DVD-makers.

Most of them don't exist for Windows. My favorite for making DVDs with menus is 2ManDVD (French program, badly translated, but easy and efficent and feature-filled)

I have no problem converting the OGVs to XVid/MP3-AVIs using WinFF. Remember though, that WinFF is just a Graphic front-end for FFMpeg. If your WinFF can't do it, you might like to visit FFMpeg's site and see if there are more codecs you can download, or a newer version of FFMpeg."
,OttifantSir,2010-03-26T12:02Z,"Converting the first Caspian-episode to AVI with XVid and MP3 shows me something peculiar:

The OGV is 720x576 Theora at ~1850 KB/s and Vorbis at 128KB/s, and a size of 377MB. Not finished coding to AVI 640x480 XVid and MP3 at 128KB/s, but the bitrate is ~6000KB/s, and it looks like the result will be somewhere around 1GB.

To me, it's astonishing. XVid needs to be coded at 3x the bitrate and close to 3.5x the size to produce the same quality in a lower resolution as Theora. So why aren't more people using Theora, Vorbis and OGV?"
,brycej11,2010-07-01T04:01Z,400mb down 2gb up??? everybody else be cool with seeding!!!
,NicyKristy,2010-12-20T01:41Z,"I was first introduced to ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" through school. We got to watch the BBC series as we read the books. If only the teachers could teach that way again instead of teaching to tests, I think our children would learn and retain more."
