Atomic Playboys is the first album released on August 8, 1989 by guitarist and songwriter Steve Stevens, best known for playing for Billy Idol for several years. The style of the songs varies widely, between the Rock tunes of the anthemic title track and guitar riffs typical of Billy Idol's hits like Rebel Yell, a cover of the Sweet's classic "Action", and elaborate works of Flamenco. Former Warrior singer Perry McCarty sang lead vocals on the album.
