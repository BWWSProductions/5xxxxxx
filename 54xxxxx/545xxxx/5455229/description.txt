Expert C# 2008 Business Objects. If you like it, buy it. (I suggest the hard copy, since APress will either give you the PDF or charge you something like $10 for it, which you'd already have! :)

New version of this should be out soon. I don't use the CSLA (or whatever it's called) framework, but it's a good learning tool. You can get the updated code from the author's website.

Cheers!
