Amazon.co.uk Review - It is regularly suggested that Steps are one of the hardest-working groups in pop and the Gold DVD provides further evidence that such an assertion is almost certainly true. Since crashing into the Top 20 towards the end of 1997 with the line-dancing inspired "5,6,7,8" (the "in" craze at the time) the group have been constantly churning out top-notch tunes. Their videos have been as equally colourful, energetic and fun (apart from the video to "When I Said Goodbye" which was shot in black and white). With their carefully choreographed dance moves, flashy locations and outrageous hairstyles and outfits, the videos have always been a top priority for the group. This collection ranges from the video for their more recent cover of "Chain Reaction" deceptively filmed in one continuous take, to the beach fun of "5,6,7,8" and are excellently matched to the style of each song. Admittedly some of the videos are rather cheesy, such as "Say You'll Be Mine", which is a pastiche of the group re-enacting scenes from recent Hollywood blockbusters, and the sleigh ride scene in "Heartbeat" (also the "bad hair" era for the female members of Steps). However the videos work best when a soap opera-style narrative is introduced, as with their flat-sitting escapades in the "Stomp" video, and the "Four Weddings and a Funeral" inspired video for their first number one single "Tragedy".
