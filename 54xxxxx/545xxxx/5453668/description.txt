G R Y P H O N - Four Albums (1973 - 1975)


Gryphon shared a vision of blending traditional English folk, Baroque instrumentation and Renaissance music in a modern format. The compositions resemble those of Gentle Giant but give greater emphasis to the authentic textures and sounds of the Renaissance period...
...with a seamless fusion offolk and medieval rock, GRYPHON developed a strong sound of their own and a loyal following.
