This NBC special was videotaped in color, but unfortunately it 
survives only as a black & white (kinescope) film copy. 

Jack's guests include Bob Hope, Elke Sommer, Walt Disney,
The Beach Boys, and actor John Ireland.

It was the first of several specials Jack did once his 
regular TV series ended after 15 years.
