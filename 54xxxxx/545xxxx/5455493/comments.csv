,ingersedat,2010-03-26T18:09Z,"i cant believe this shit... guys, pls dont be retarded. this is for ones who believes the uploader and seeds this crap. wth?! now, we all know, ITS OFFICIAL that the dvd will be released on 22th of april, the earth day. so, how are you so retarded that you still search dvdrip for avatar???? any torrent that sais avatar dvdrip should be deleted. nobody should accept to be fooled in this way. just wait until 22 april and then search for the dvdrip. even on 22, a 2d dvd will be released, not 3d!!!! 3d will be out by the end of this year. hope this infos helped the retardes that seed this! :))"
