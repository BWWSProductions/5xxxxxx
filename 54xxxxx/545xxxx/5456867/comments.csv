,Mikeman2000,2011-08-08T21:13Z,"Well, you could download this torrent because you think this is something you have to pay for, or you could just Google it and get hundreds of pages to download any of these files and more for free and about 10x faster."

,kvedran,2012-03-09T22:07Z,"Thanks man, I'll keep seeding for the rest of my Zelda-loving life! :D Screw you @Mikeman2000 this torrent rules and it downloaded really fast. If you don't prefer this type of downloading of Zelda, excuse me for my language, but what the fuck are you doing here?
Cheers!"
