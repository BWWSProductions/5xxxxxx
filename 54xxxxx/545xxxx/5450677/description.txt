    ZombieSmash! is a Survival Comedy game, featuring undead-themed     
    castle defense and entertaining, physics-based gameplay. The game     
    casts players as Joey, a lone survivor pit against a herd of          
    writhing, unrelenting zombies - to defeat the undead masses,          
    players must use their fingers to flick and smash them until          
    they're un-undead.                                                    
                                                                          
     To aid players in their fight, over 20 specials and upgrades        
    allow for creative zombie demolition - including fun implements       
    like asteroids, wrecking balls, liquid nitrogen and a gigantic,       
    rolling boulder  combine specials (for instance, smash               
    nitrogen-frozen zombies with a boulder!) for added hilarity.          
                                                                          
     Sophisticated ragdoll physics produce unique and hysterical         
    zombie deaths, and the proprietary SplatterEngine renders adorable    
    cartoon blood and gore in a convincing and entertaining fashion.      
                                                                          
     Three game modes provide limitless replay value:                    
    o Campaign Mode challenges players to survive for 31 intense days     
    against the mounting zombie threat.                                   
    o Endless Siege Mode confronts them with a never-ending zombie        
    assault - hold out as long as possible, racking up an ever-rising     
    body count.                                                           
    o Sandbox Mode gives you all the tools to rain destruction down on    
    those stinking, moaning zombies without any of the peril.             
                                                                          
     Social features including Chillingo's Crystal and Playhaven for     
    online and community support, and the ability to share screenshots    
    of your best ZombieSmashing moments!
