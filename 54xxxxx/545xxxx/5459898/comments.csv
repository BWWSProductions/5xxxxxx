No, the DVD didn't come with any, but I'll tell you what: Since you're SO grateful that I made this film available that you rushed to the comment section to thank me, and not gripe about what it DIDN'T come with, howzabout YOU download it along with a subtitle maker, and YOU make them available?

I admit it, I'm SUCH a wretch, not wanting to spend several hours typing out the script to a flick and fixing timestamps to them. I'm so selfish and low. I shall at once don a hairshirt and flagellate myself to get over the deficiency. "
