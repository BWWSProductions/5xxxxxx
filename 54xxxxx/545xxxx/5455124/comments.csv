Only one suggestion... Please in the future set your recording bit rate higher than 128Kbps as it sounds very watery & cheap at this setting.
Even converting to a higher rate didn't help the sound much for me because at 128k there aren't enough Bits to accurately capture & reproduce the original sounds.
I would recommend at very least 160k-192k @ 48.000 Hz instead of 44.1 Hz but even that barely cuts it sometimes with heavy music.  No offense of course just suggestion. Try it and you WILL hear what I mean.
Thanks for the up regardless!"
