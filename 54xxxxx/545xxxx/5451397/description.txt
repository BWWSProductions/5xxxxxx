    Typing Assistant Auto-Completes your frequently used words and        
    phrases anywhere. It makes typing faster, more intelligent and        
    lowers effort.                                                        
                                                                          
    When typing, a smart Typing Assistant suggestion window opens to      
    show you the possible words you are typing, then, with one key        
    stroke, it automatically completes the word for you. The program      
    automatically learns the words you type, automatically expands        
    user-defined shorthand to full text, automatically accesses           
    clipboard history contents, and automatically launches                
    user-defined application so that the more you use the program, the    
    smarter it becomes and the more you find it useful.

      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      
      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
