But i did put it into a mkv container to play on my tv through my wd tv media player to fix the audio sync problem i was having. Nothing to do with your encoding though, check my older posts to see why. If its size i would rather have the 720p for the extra 250 odd meg of difference there is in it. 

Keep up the top notch work mate. Thanks"
