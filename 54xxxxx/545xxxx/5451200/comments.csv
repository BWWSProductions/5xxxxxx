,aktankit,2010-03-22T17:55Z,"hello guys

i have been downloading m2ts files which have been playing fine on my ps3.
However recently i have been experiencing problems with the audio.
I downloaded m2ts files of 21 and saw 6 and while playing, the dolby digital audio stutters a lot (the blue light on my receiver keeps on blinking). This has been happening only with these two recently downloaded files. Is there a way to fix them?

also i downloaded these files via Vuze and a lot of times my pc shut instantly due to electricity cuts. Can this in anyway corrupt the downloading files. (this was one of the reasons for my psn downloaded demos to not work on ps3).

any help is appreciated"
