[V],RiddlerA,2010-03-21T20:30Z,"Added A sample

Just to give u guys a heads up regarding the Sustitles - They are 2-3 sec out of Sync

I couldn't find any which were in sync

I suggest watching my Uploads in GOM Player, which has some very cool & user friendly features

One can easily Manually sync the subtitles

GOM player can be download from FileHippo.com

Also keep on updating ur codec packs, as it will keep the viewing experience great

Next Upload :

Mr & Mrs. Smith
