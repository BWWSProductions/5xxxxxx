    FANUC, SINUERIK, MITSUBISHI, FAGOR, HAAS, PA, GSK, HNC, KND,          
    DASEN, WA,GREAT,SANYING, RENHE, SKY, JNC turning and milling and      
    machining center simulation software developed by Nanjing Swan        
    Software Technology Company are all based on both colleges'           
    teaching and machine factories' manufacturing experience. And the     
    software is the first domestic NC simulation software which can be    
    downloaded and updated automatically for free. By using this          
    software, we can attain the aim of enabling students to have the      
    experience of practical manipulation on a largely-reduced cost.       
                                                                          
    Swansoft CNC Simulation includes 16 sorts, 65 systems, and 119        
    control panels. It has programming and processing function of         
    FANUC, SIEMENS(SINUMERIK), MITSUBISHI, FAGOR, HAAS, PA, GSK, HNC,     
    KND, DASEN, WA, GREAT,SANYING, RENHE, SKY. By using the software      
    in PC, students can master operation of all kinds of NC lathe, NC     
    milling and machining center in short time. Teachers can gain         
    current operation information of students' at any time through        
    network teaching.

    Install the software. Start the keygen. Use "RegWipe" to clean the   
    registration data. In the program you should use "Mac Encryption".   
    Compare the serial number of the keygen with the one of the          
    program. If it is the same, everything is fine. Use the generated    
    serial from the keygen.

      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      
      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
