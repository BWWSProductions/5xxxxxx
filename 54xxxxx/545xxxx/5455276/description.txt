BBC - Requiem for Detroit - (13th March 2010) [PDTV (XviD)]
-----------------------------------------------------------


Powered by extraordinary archive â€“ vivid projections of the cityâ€™s heyday on itâ€™s now abandoned buildings â€“ and the irrepressible music that continues to come out of Detroit, from ragtime and rap to techno, the documentary charts the rise and fall of the â€˜Big Threeâ€™, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, and the impact the decline of these giants has had on the city. 

Detroit was at the forefront of the American dream of the 20th Century. The fourth largest city in the US, it was also one of the wealthiest, housing the countryâ€™s earliest shopping malls. Americaâ€™s first major freeway was built in Detroit to facilitate the increasing number of commuters into the city. 

But the 21st century has seen the American dream, powered by the Big Three, slide into a nightmare for Detroit. Levels of black inner city poverty, hunger and unemployment have reached critical proportions, in grim contrast to the affluent white suburbs which surround the city. 
Requiem for Detroit? includes interviews with the people living amongst the deserted auto plants, closed schools and failing infrastructure, as well as those who are based in the consumer utopia of the suburbs. It also features interviews with Motown star Martha Reeves and beat poet John Sinclair. 

Julien Temple, Director, commented:
â€œDetroit was the frontier city in the US, powering the American dream. What I find fascinating is the fact that it is still ahead of the game, becoming the first big US city to virtually fall off the map.â€
