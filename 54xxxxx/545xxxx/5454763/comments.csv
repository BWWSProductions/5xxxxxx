huge rips lol but quality is gr8! :) "
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-22T21:07Z,"The movies are very long, thus very big files. Quality is superb though.  They are 1/3 the size of the source files I had to process.  Whoever fetches them will certainly be pleased, especially my Apple TV fans."
,dezertx,2010-03-22T21:35Z,resolution ?
,X3MEX,2010-03-22T21:44Z,if its not the Extended Cut its a Waste of time .. its better to wait nxt year
,abban009,2010-03-22T22:20Z,"@PT-Can you please upload the movie ""The Abyss(1989)""

,blurayfan,2010-03-22T23:29Z,"I don't know if its your movies but when i try to fast forward them it doesn't do that. I cant even skip through the movie at all, all of your movies all like that,,Why?"
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-22T23:34Z,i would say an old version of firmware with your hardware device.
,blurayfan,2010-03-23T03:26Z,Well i view all my files through Western Digital WD TV HD Media Player..SO idk what can be the problem..
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-23T03:35Z,"well that's most likely the problem, update the firmware to the latest available and tell me if its fixed."
,torrentfan21,2010-03-23T08:35Z,"PT how can i stream tru my xbox 360 it wont work??????????????????????????????????????????????????

[V],poppedtart,2010-03-23T16:53Z,"windows media player can stream files just fine, its designed for this, just share your library."
,jake_samuals,2010-03-24T17:33Z,"Hi PT, do you know if these will stream to Apple TV as well. I am connected wirelessly."
[V],poppedtart,2010-03-24T18:02Z,you need to sync for flawless playback I think.  streaming is iffy with the apple tv.
,krillert,2010-03-24T18:51Z,"Thanks for these :D Awsuuum!!! 

Could you please up the AVP duo.?  Really want these in an HD from PT :)))"

,KickassWashingMachine,2010-05-22T10:46Z,"Wow, at least the dude is honest about it, writing that the sources are the 1080p bluray rips by cbgb.

But why the fuck would you re-encode a bluray rip to reduce the size? AND YOU NEED TO STATE THAT IN THE TITLE, YOU BITCH! IT'S NOT ""BRRIP"", IT'S ""RE-ENCODE"", YOU FUCK! OMG, stay away, people, stay the fuck away!"
,BatuMelissa,2010-05-23T15:06Z,"Hi poppedtart. Can you tell me the program you use for converting ? I am not able to convert any of my .mkv , .avi,... files succecfully for watching on my Samsung BD1250 Blu-ray player. Even I use different kind of programs."
[V],poppedtart,2010-06-01T22:07Z,"@KickassWashingMachine

its commonly done to fit a certain purpose.  The quality is perfect for its designed platform."
,midge218,2010-06-15T02:28Z,"loving every rip you do PT, great quality especially theyre all in m4v, stupid mkv doesnt work so well on mac, thanks, and keep it coming, oh any chance you can do me Jumper? thanks"

,ultimagic,2010-12-04T08:49Z,"i feel sorry for KickassWashingMachine for being a jackass. he's really poor guy, he doesn't know anything about this stuff. he is just a downloader leecher who doesn't know what he is doing."
,virtueso,2010-12-30T09:47Z,"come on guys its been downloading for over 3 frickin days ! thats over 72 hours non stop! so few peers around india,getting really poor speed.. you guys gota seed more !!!"
,virtueso,2011-01-01T14:31Z,"hellpp!! my samsung lcd doesnt play the m4v format!! wtf ! what soft do i use to convert? will it affect the quality?? ive waited tooo long for this file to dl and i cant bear the thought of not getting the quality i want on my 40'' lcd..
it plays mkv,mp4,avi,all of the other formats ive ever tried..damn you apple ! please help "
,ultimagic,2011-01-02T16:28Z,"@virtueso
don't convert it. you will lose a lot of quality if you don't know how to encode. i suggest to use the Yamb software to extract the video from m4v to mp4. or you can use mkvtoolnix. m4v to mkv, it's very fast."
,virtueso,2011-01-03T07:33Z,"@ ulti, i converted to mkv using OJOsoft,the full version. file size is greater than the m4v ,the 5gig file converted to a 6.5gb file..but i know that this does not mean that the quality has improved,or NOT derogated for that matter... it looks good, but i can see pixels when theres absolute darkness in the background etc..my tv has excellent contrast ratio so thats not the problem..looks good,but not 720p good..appreciate your help,any more ideas are very welcome.."
,yopepoy,2011-01-03T15:18Z,"converting is really time consuming but if you have a great speed of bandwidth, i suggest you get this

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5700561/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Trilogy_720p_BRRip_x264-HDLiTE_%28Kingdom%29

it's already mp4 and 5.1 sound. but if you really want to encode, i suggest you use ripbot264 or MeGUI for windows and encode-handheld.pl for linux. that's was poppedtart use to encode this file.
"
,virtueso,2011-01-04T17:10Z,"ya thanks..bandwidth is reeeeally bad lol..you have no idea! net is slow here in india..1 and 2mbps are considered fast !  i connected my pc to my lcd with a vga,display in 1080p res..evrything plays like a charm now! thanks for the up..converted to mkv all the same.
cheers"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-09T05:02Z,These have 5.1 surround sound via Dolby Digital.  The only device that will automatically play that track is the Apple TV however.  Otherwise your device will default to the AAC track.  Your device may have options to let you choose the alternate track.  You may easily convert these to MKV format using mkvtoolnix.  It will take you approximately 2-3 minutes per film to change to MKV which may be more compatible with your playback device.  If you change to MKV then you most likely do not need the AAC track so uncheck that track when you do the container swap.
,weaping_reaper,2011-01-20T03:34Z,"This will be the first time that I have ever watched any of TLOTR.. After watching the first 5 mins of the 1st one already, I can say the quality is AMAZING AS FUCK! and I'm glad I chose to download from here.. And thanks to VLC, VGA cable, and a Badass Tv and speaker system. I will enjoy these next couple of days.
