,k7evrr,2010-03-26T04:13Z,come on guys. hes a new artist and he made this song before he signed any record deals and paid out of his own pocket for this song. its only 69 cents on iTunes- not even the usual dollar charge and that goes to pay him back for this song and not only that but hes paid for himself two full albums that hes already put out before signing with universal republic records.
