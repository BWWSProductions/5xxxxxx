[V],Team_xRG,2010-03-24T12:34Z,"WDC_GaMeR u will get chance to make more spam :D

2 more BDRips Coming :P"
,badboy420,2010-03-25T12:38Z,"Source 720p= 1280 x 720.

when u rip it u get black bars both at top and bottom of the video.Black bars cost bits and hence reduce quality.

so cutting off the black bars, u get 

Mod 720p=1280 x 560.

@WDC_GaMeR,rttlesnke .

secretmyth doesnt do hindi movies or tamil movies.so appreciate the once who does it on bluray for those who want quality and low size"

,amitarora78,2010-03-27T03:49Z,"Just ignore WDC_GaMeR  and rttlesnke. I think they are ignorant. 
For you both WDC and rttlesnke go to imdb and check for aspect ratio. Just don't prove that you are a stupid by putting such comments. Learn a little about video encoding/editing before you disrespect such reputed groups like Team_xrg

Keep rocking Team_xrg. "
