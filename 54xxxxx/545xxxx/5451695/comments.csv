Thanks for the encode/upload.

I know I shouldn't compare to the BBC series. But as it is the same director I think this is a special case.

I won't start downloading until tomorrow, have to wait for the seeds to grow.

Thanks for this torrent and the original series.

Cheers
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-03-22T04:37Z,"Hi 20-40,
Taking a chance that you're open for requests again.

If not, then just tell me to go elsewhere.

Hoping you might do an encode of 'The book of Eli' http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1037705/

No rush, as usual.

If this has already been asked for and you have answered, (yes/no/when etc.), then please ignore this request.

Cheers
Jon"

As I'm making requests I might as well go for broke.

Just discovered that [Breaking Bad] Season 3 has started, tonight!

Any chance of you including this series in your schedule?

Don't know how many episodes as writers strike interrupted S1 (12 scheduled anyway & I think 7 were aired). There were webisodes linking to S2, which was 13 episodes long.

Would really appreciate it, as I LOVE this show.

Cheers

[V],twentyforty,2010-03-22T05:56Z,"@Jon: I did really shitty Telesync of ""Book"", its somewhere on Pages a month ago. Nothing new came out. I would wait some DVD or BD rip but I don't know the release date.

BBad has already been downloaded and will be encoded after the schedule"
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-22T06:17Z,"@Jon & anyone interested:

""Pacific"" Pt.2; should be a 360p or normal, small-sized?

I have mixed feelings about 428 MB episodes, even if I advocate ""season on one DVD"". Quality of such big encodings is unbeatable, but 428 MB compared to ~200 sounds pretty sobering. Any suggestions are welcomed."

re: your question: 
""Pacific"" Pt.2; should be a 360p or normal, small-sized?

My vote is for 360p (450MB) size as this is one of those shows that NEEDS the extra definition.

I fully appreciate that it is a big file BUT the fans of this show will appreciate it. 
May take longer and use more download allowance BUT this show is worth it.
Also, there are only 10 episodes!

Just my thoughts.

Cheers
