* STORY : (text extracted from wikipedia) *

* The gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, in which the player is free to roam the game's open world at will, not having to focus on the game's storyline. In this it is similar to that of other sandbox style action games like Mercenaries.

Several new additions and improvements to the game have been highlighted by lead designer, Peter Johansson. The AI has been rewritten to use a planning system which enables enemies to perform varying actions. In game enemies can use the environment to their advantage, taking cover behind objects, and adapting dynamically to the objects around them. Additional elements include vertical gameplay and a manual aiming system that allows the player to have full control over the cross-hair, allowing for the pinpointing of specific limbs with varied crippling effects. Just Cause 2 also has an adaptive difficulty system, gradually scaling the difficulty as the player does more in the game.

The game takes place on the fictional island of Panau, situated in the Malay Archipelago[citation needed]. It is geographically similar to both New Zealand and Hawaii.

There are several new weapons in Just Cause 2, including a rocket launcher with laser-controlled rockets, a one-handed grenade launcher, remote-triggered C4, and a detachable mounted minigun. There are several new vehicles, including a Boeing 737, with a greater variance in the handling of different vehicles. Ground surfaces now have a large influence on the player's controls, with respect to the abilities of road vehicles on rough terrain. There is also a real-time deformation system and individual components that can come loose from vehicles.

Initially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field of their own accord. Early in the game the player encounters a black market supplier, from whom weapons can be purchased along with vehicles, with an option to have them delivered to the player's location via helicopter drop. As the game progresses, additional weapons and vehicles become available on the black market. All weapons and vehicles on the black market have parameters that can be upgraded in several steps, by building upgrades with weapon and vehicle components. There are over 2,000 parts that the player can acquire.
