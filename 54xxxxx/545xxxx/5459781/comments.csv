,newmouse,2010-03-27T04:44Z,"Just to make the install method clear.
This 1.16 GB File is more highly compressed than any I think I've seen .
Fully decompressed it will take up over 8 GB Disc space.
@@@
0) Read the enclosed Instructions.txt file carefully.
1) Download the Freeware Program FREEARC (Goggle it) FreeArc is safe & Virus & addware free. 
Install FreeArc.
2) Use FreeArc to decompress this torrent File 
to Disc. It will create a Folder called JUST CAUSE 2 about 7.5 GB size. Takes around 20 Mins.
3) Inside that Folder is GLOBE CONVERTER.EXE  
Run this to decompress the ""Archives_win32.globe"" file.
THIS WILL TAKE A VERY LONG TIME one hour perhaps. It should play a Tune when finished.
Mine didn't.
While this is working it takes up to around 15 GB of disc space. Allow for this . 
When it's finished this reduces to around 10 GB total. 
4) Now check that the files inside archives_win32.rar (if its still present) are
inside the Folder archives_win32.
Also move pc4.arc file and pc4.tab file inside the archives_win32 folder.
5) Run justcause2.exe to play .

The 2 archives archives_win32.rar and
archives_win32.globe  (totalling some 10 GB) 
can now be deleted if the are still present.

The final full Game Folder size is just 4GB.
I see nothing missing & no down sampling.
Eng Lang only.

Hmm. I don't think it's my PC, I can tell that much. Virus won't let me use System thingy to check out processes (clever people these mexican hackers (they wrote in engrish)).

Apparently Steam must be running. But the game continues to load anyway.

Once you're in the game it will run better (although I still get a bit of choppiness - just not so much that it's unplayable) and if you're lucky there may even be room for upping the specs a bit."
