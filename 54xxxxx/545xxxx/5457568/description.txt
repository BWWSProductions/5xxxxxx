Worlds Apart is the fourth studio album by the Canadian progressive rock band Saga and was originally released in 1981.
Widely considered Saga's best album (and certainly their most commercially successful), the album has become the band's most recognizable work to date. The first song on the album, "On the Loose" was a single that hit #3 on worldwide Billboard charts in 1981, landing Saga their best performance on the charts. The single was helped with a well-made music video which appeared on MTV during the station's inaugural year on the air. Videos were also made for the singles "Wind Him Up", another successful chart-riser and "Amnesia". The success of the album was also largely credited to an expanded tour roster which saw the band enter new territories and venues, particularly in the United States, to expand their musical presence. Worlds Apart has been certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Germany, Denmark, The United States and Norway.
