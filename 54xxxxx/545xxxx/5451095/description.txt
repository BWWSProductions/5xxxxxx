Clean, upbeat music with inspired lyrics After revisiting this album 
for the first time in eleven years, I cant imagine why Id forgotten 
about it to begin with. perhaps the fact that I had owned it on LP 
originally, and my record player has long since bit the dust?

Once Upon a Time by Simple Minds is simply amazing, because Im just 
a music fan who cant sing or play anything worth a lick, I lack the 
musical language to describe Simple Minds style beyond comparing them
to other bands of their time. 

Superficially, this collection sounds like early U2 with a little more
emphasis on the synthesizers and backup singers. 
The lyrics even have a similar quasi-spiritual overtone, poetically 
borrowing phrases that could have been Praise and Worship quotes 
but are probably used to describe human relationships. 

For instance You lift me up like the sweetest cup I share with you is 
from Alive and Kicking, and from Sanctify Yourself: 
"So you cant stop the world for a Boy or a Girl, Sweet victims of poor 
circumstances But you can pour back the Love, Sweeping down from above, 
giving hope and making more chances Well I hope and I pray that maybe 
someday Youll come back down here and show me the way...Open up your 
heart, Sanctify yourself.
