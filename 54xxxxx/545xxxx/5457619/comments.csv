,BasilBrush,2010-03-25T23:00Z,"MVgroup's policy is to seed one torrent for 2 days before issuing the next episode. This allows the slow people to catch up.

Date/Time now is 25th March 2010
I've just started seeding episode 6 HD.

Episode 7 will the about 27th March.

If you login to MVGroup you'll find the PDTV version as well - it's all free."
,BasilBrush,2010-03-25T23:46Z,I only cross post it to Piratebay once it's well seeded at MVGroup. So if you want the torrent a bit quicker get the torrent file from MVgroup and stick it in your BT client. The torrent will start downloading as soon as I start seeding.
