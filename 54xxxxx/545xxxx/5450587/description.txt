Some of the Baabaa Kabeer Sahib's Banee indeed is very condensed and impregnated with Spiritual suggestions. Not easy to figure it out from its face value. But if we really try deep Vichaar in truth, it can be decoded. The Shloka above is a case in point. In order to understand its purport, we need to look at some of the previous Shlokas for clues and hints. Unfortunately, to make easy money, many Raagees and Bhais take short cuts and narrate weird stories, doing injustice to all. The instructions of the Granths, scriptures, and Enlightened Ones that command spiritual discipline as essential to God realization are invaluable signposts to the mortals caught in the worldly cycle.
