Wikipedia - Gold (The Greatest Hits) is a greatest hits album released by pop group Steps. It reached #1 in the UK charts. "Baby Don't Dance" and "Only In My Dreams" were the only songs not released as singles, although promotional copies for "Baby Don't Dance" have surfaced since the group's split. It is notable that the singles "You'll Be Sorry" and "I Know Him So Well" were not included on the compilation, even though their counterparts did. The US version was released under the name â€˜The Best of Stepsâ€™. The version of "One for Sorrow" on this album is the original mix, not the US Mix. The compilation features three songs previously unavailable in the US - "Better Best Forgotten", "Chain Reaction", and "Words Are Not Enough". It is also surprising to note that "When I Said Goodbye", one of Steps's biggest UK hits did not make it onto the US version.

Amazon.co.uk Review By John Galilee  - Countless tribute and sound-a-like bands have had various stabs at mimicking the magic of ABBA. Of the bunch, Steps have been the most successful in their attempts to nurture a similar ABBA-esque musical style and image. It comes as no surprise that Steps should call their "best of" anthology Gold, just like the best-selling "best of" from their Swedish heroes. The ABBA influences can be heard right from their earliest material--"One For Sorrow" to "After The Love Has Gone" (October 1999), through to newer compositions such as "Baby Don't Dance" (an updated version of "Voulez-Vous?"). Released at the peak of the line-dancing craze in the UK, their thigh-slapping debut "5,6,7,8" thus sounds remarkably out of place. Proving that they're no puppets of Mr Waterman, the Euro-pop style "Only In My Dreams" is the first song written by Steps as a group. Their cover of Diana Ross's 1986 number one "Chain Reaction" looks destined, along with "Tragedy" and the 70s disco inspired hit "Stomp", to become the songs which future generations will best remember Claire, Faye, Lisa, H and Lee for.
