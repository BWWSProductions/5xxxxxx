James Stewart and his wife Glotia made multiple appearances on 
the game show PASSWORD as they did on The Jack Benny Program.

This is also the second appearance with both the Stewarts and 
Barbara Nichols.  She played Jack's wacky blonde bimbo 
girlfriend Mildred, who again drives Jack's celebrity neighbors crazy!

This episode is entitled "Jack Goes to a Concert". 
It's from the 11th Season (1960-1961).
