,Philonetic,2010-04-06T00:13Z,"Starting to get annoyed with imagines existential ""Imagine"" crap throughout the film.  No other release group pulls this bovine feces.

But yeah, superior quality in a TS.  May be the best quality TS I've ever seen.  Story was alright.

But the ""Imagine"" crap, pretty annoying."

whoever rip this DVD did not care too much about the sound quality."
,xMOXIEx,2010-04-22T14:32Z,Why even post a dvd version of a ts video? You'd have to be a retard to download it when you can just get the avi and convert it yourself. What gives?
,peptheblue,2010-05-16T18:30Z,"Seriously - some people need to read about it before showing how dumb they are, making random comments.

It's a Xvid ripped into DVD format (VOB VTS etc)
