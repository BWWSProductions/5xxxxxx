Same cover as shown here though.

Looks hilarious :-)"

Sorry its my mistake... I changed it"
,godswallops,2010-03-21T07:33Z,"Thank you for the Up.

I've queued it for d/l in about 7 hours when my ISP goes into off-peak mode - I'll seed for at least a full copy back to the swarm as usual."

I'll keep this one going for a while."
,godswallops,2010-03-21T17:00Z,"Got it. 

Excellent quality for such a small file - A9/V9.

Thanks.  Seeding for the next 6 hours."
