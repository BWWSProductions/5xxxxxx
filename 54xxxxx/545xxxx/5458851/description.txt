Instructions:
1. Extract files to folder of choice.
2. Click on play.
3. Have fun.

Simple as that.

You will start out with the stats I had at the time of upload, sorry if that causes a problem for you (if you wanted to start fresh).  
The stats aren't very high, but it is still a little bonus if you don't care if you get my stats.

Also, at the time of the upload, my name was 'Thunderhorse' and I forgot to delete it before making the torrent.  If you wish to change it. Simply open up the folder where you extracted the game to, and open 'rev'.  It shouldn't be in any folder, and it is a notepad file.  Once open change the steamuser and playername to whatever you want.

Please seed.  I will seed as long as necessary.

Here is a link to having all level 6 perks.
Good to use when you have a group of friends wanting to play on suicidal difficulty.
Not my torrent so all credit goes to, Tyrfi.
