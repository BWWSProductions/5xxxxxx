I think this episode will be better than the others, as at least they will show something about Richard."

Thank you very much for all your uploads!

Medum quick download [from 12AM to 5AM; now I'm seeding at 70kB/s, and will stay on till next monday. 
Now utorrent shows 19,855 Seeds / 11,795 Peers for this torrent.
My speeds are not high: Download 250kB/s Upload: 90KB/s

Note: For brazilian subtitles, try 
opensubtitles.org 
or 
legendas.TV 

At addic7ed.com, the english subtitles are always ok, but brazilian subtitles  have problems due to strange coding: accented  letters like ĂĄ, ĂŁ etc are shown as a weird combination of characters. 

Best regards to all!
