,gonusanti,2010-03-23T20:43Z,"Ganja is the sanskrit word ( ????? ) for the plant Cannabis Sativa. Other names are marijuana, reefer, weed, grass, pot, etc.

It is the psychoactive substance which is regularly consumed by 162 million people globally even though it is considered illegal. Even though it has been decriminalized in most of the civilized world (-US), it should be treated like alcohol and tobacco. A substance to help joie-de-vivre like beautiful women, nature, etc."
