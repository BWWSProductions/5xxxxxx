Now American will pay for Abortions and sex changes, botox and other crap that everyone else wants but that you don't want...just like here in Canuckistan.  

The next thing the Obamination will do is tackle 'immigration reform' which in pure English means an amnesty for illegal aliens and remind them to remember to vote Democrat to say 'Thank you'.

This is the same shit the Liberals did here in Canada. And all that it does is encourage more illegals who come here with no job or housing and they apply for welfare. They bring their extended families who wind up on welfare. Free medical, etc.

You think you have Medical fraud now? You ain't seen nuthin' yet!

I just had a full physical including prostrate exam. Had to pay out of pocket for it BUT if you want to have a sex change, it's free courtesy of liberals who have succeeded in making people believe it's their 'right' to change - at a cost of around $200,000 as well as psych eval and aftercare. But if you need a PSA test, you have to pay for it yourself. I'd rather we went back to the way it used to be some 20-25 years ago when we actually paid for healthcare visits, etc.

Obama isn't telling you the REAL cost either., just the way Canadians weren't told how costs would skyrocket, how there would be long long wait times to see a specialist or for an MRI, CT or surgery. We have a shortage of doctors who fled to the States because they didn't want this kind of socialism, and now where will doctors move to?

/end eulogy.

Thanks to jwhitt for the daily dose of sanity. Cheers!"

,.xMule.,2010-03-23T00:16Z,"Some democrats like to point to our Canadian system as an example of working universal healthcare but they couldn't be more mistaken.

Besides the intolerable and sometimes fatal rationing that thunderbum described, there is the simple fact that a great many of us rely on the American private system to get care that we'd have to wait months or even years to get. I have experienced this personally, having to rely on pain medication to endure months of waiting for a procedure I'd be able to get in a few days at the most in most of America.  I am also in a provincial capital, not some little town in the sticks.

My city is about 19 times larger than the nearest American city and its medical centers advertise in our papers.  A great many of us Canucks live close to the border and the simple fact is that our system is not working and driving doctors out.  About 6 of the doctors from the town I grew up in moved to work in the states.

Our politicians have been forced to allow expanded care from private providers but the simple fact is that we have a very difficult struggle to undo the damage that has been done.  We have been graciously allowed access to the American system but where will American's go when universal care is eventually forced down their throats?  

Some democrats say that say that this is not a step towards universal care but they are either misinformed at best and at worst, liars.  Your president and many other ranking democrats have publicly said they are proponents of universal care when surrounded by the loyal but their tune changes when they address the nation as a whole, Alinsky style.

My prayers are with you all."

I hope you got the help you need. 

The American system is aboratioanally expensive.  

And private insurance companies deny care by either outright dropping customers who get sick 
or
raising premiums on sick customers to the point
the they can no longer afford to pay.

I agree with you if you are correct about Canada's shortcomings,
but the American system has got a lot of wrong in it too.

Why didn't the Republicans / Conservatives fix it when they were in power? "
,booboo332,2010-03-23T04:26Z,"You make some good points, captainronito, and I appreciate your civility.  Some that will go unnamed could learn a thing or two from you.

It should also be pointed out that the Democrats have held majorities in the house and senate since the Bush administration.  Both parties are full of whores to lobby groups and Bush was no conservative either. ""I had to abandon my free market principles to save the free market system"" was a pretty telling quote. 

A number of things increase the cost of healthcare but adding a national level of bureaucracy does not seem to be the answer nor does gradually bringing about a single payer system. The founder of Whole foods suggested several ideas to address the current problems with the system and was promptly ostracized, with many calling for a boycott of his stores.  Bullies like Pelosi and her ilk are not the people to solve even trivial issues let alone one this substantial.  They make a mockery of our Republic and its representative processes.

Yes, there are problems and we should help people that cannot help themselves but narrowly pushing through a bloated and nebulous bill is not the solution.

You mention the abuses of the customers of health insurance companies and this is indeed an area that needs a lot of attention.  Such companies are immune to anti-trust lawsuits and unlike many other kinds of insurance there is no competition across state lines.  There is a lot that can be done here but what is being jammed through is not the solution and will only lead to widespread rationing.

Tort reform is another area that could be addressed.  This raises the cost of care substantially as does the abuse of the system by illegal immigrants.  This is not a racial observation and the people who are truly being shafted by the disrespect of our southern border are those who are here legally.

Its one thing if a state has a public option.  People always have the freedom to leave.  Instituting a National option that will destroy private ones eventually leading to a single payer system will only spread misery throughout the country."

You conservative morons are just going to try to take credit for health care reform in 20 years just like you have with social security and medicare in the past. 

LOL LOL LOL LOL"

,Moodscapes,2010-03-23T15:37Z,"Spiritual View: When President Ronald Reagan defeated fascism in Europe and the former Soviet Union, the demons that lost their power and foothold over there declared war on the United states and came over here in the attempt to destroy democracy. They couldn't have picked a better candidate to lead their cause then in the likes of Obama."
,thunderbum,2010-03-23T21:36Z,"The Obamination is the quintessential turtle on a fence post. You know he doesn't belong there, the turtle knows he's out of his element and everyone knows it had help getting there.

No-one knows anything about him, his autobios are exercises in creative writing, his namesake Obama isn't the one who supplied the DNA - it was actually Frank Marshall Davis who had threesomes with his mother Ann Dunham. Look at any picture of Obama and FMD, especially around the mouth to chin. Gotcha, bambam.

He is Muslim and went to a Medrassa, claimed there was no more beautiful sound than the call to prayer in the evening, repeated the Muslim self-identification for a NY newspaper, complained in interviews and in one of his 'autobios' that as a NON AMERICAN he could go to the wealthy American Schools (in Indonesia)
He got financial assistance to attend Harvard and Columbia on a foreign student grant, gave a falsified birth cert that was a proven forgery that originally issued to his half sister, beyond his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, Ferrakhan, Jeremiah Wrong and on and on he is first and foremost a Muslim who is successfully destroying America, and with the destruction of America will bring ruin to the rest of the world's commerce because where America goes, the world follows in its' wake.

He's laughed and scoffed at Christianity, treats Israel as an enemy, bows and scrapes to tyrants, and has told the Muslim world that America is not a Muslim nation, but a nation populated by Christians, Jews and other unbelievers - thus announcing subtly that via several verses in the koran that America is fit for destruction.

People really need to wake up..."
,booboo332,2010-03-23T23:42Z,"When someone go off on a birther rant, everyone who does not already buy into it simply stops listening.  Also, if Davis was indeed Obama's father, that would make him the child of two American citizens and an even more pointless distraction.

As for the religious stuff, this stuff is even more self defeating than the birther stuff.  It is more likely that Obama is personally not religious in any genuine way and, like politicians on both side of the aisle, is simply pandering to those who are unable to accept a separation of church and state.  It is ironic that many of those who object (rightly) about the indoctrination of children in the religion of climate change are the same who supported prayer in public schools.  People have an amazing capacity to see what they want to and let their imaginations get the better of them.

My point is that getting all twisted up with pointless ""weapons of mass distraction"" only detracts from the issues staring us all in the face, such as Obama's progressive ideals, outright lies and insidious methods.  Have you ever considered that this is what they want you to do?  All it does in the long run is make Obama's detractors look like lunatics and helps advance the progressive agenda."
,koniev,2010-03-26T10:34Z,"Sorry for you Americans. Communist revolution finally got you. Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotzky, Stalin, Ted Kennedy are laughing at US. All that compassion/equity trickery Democrat propaganda worked. Prepare for lowering of madical care standarts: big lines, bad and insuficient meds, ignorant and frustrated doctors and nurses, regulation of your health relate habits, no money for medical research, no money for infrastructure/machines, no money for nothing. Congratz. I mean I`m sad. Last hope of free market is going to fall ;( Sad days are comming. I hope you guys will destroy the Dems in 2010 senate elections. Remember, as long as they remaign on air in media (even talkin completly bs), their aprooval ratings slowly grow automaticly, bacause they look like idiots and a viewers will have compassion for `em. Doesn`t matter if they use kids in ads or dying animals. Be strong conservatives. "
