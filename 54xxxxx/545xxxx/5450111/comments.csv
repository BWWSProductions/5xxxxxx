,Babik0s,2010-03-25T05:17Z,thanks
,shinobiung,2010-03-25T22:07Z,"wow, I am glad I didnt pay for this SHIT movie.

When you do something thats been done 50 times (Patrick Stewart was best version), you better make it good, but this is ANOTHER DISNEY FAIL."
,JPSchwarz,2010-03-26T11:01Z,"Has no one else noticed that, while the video quality is good, for 700Mb, the film seems to have been squashed from a true widescreen version to fit the 652 x 344 format. This distorts the images, stretches the characters and makes it unwatchable for me. Pity! Still there's a goog one - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5457602/A_Christmas_Carol_2009_HD_WS_H264_CRYS"

There is a very slight blurr but not big deal, but i was watching it on a 50inch tv i guess a smaller one will be better."
