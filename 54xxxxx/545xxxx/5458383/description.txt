 Schoolteacher and family man Ed Avery, who's been       
 suffering bouts of severe pain and even blackouts, is   
 hospitalized with what's diagnosed as a rare            
 inflammation of the arteries. Told by doctors that he   
 probably has only months to live, Ed agrees to an       
 experimental treatment: doses of the hormone cortisone. 
 Ed makes a remarkable recovery, and returns home to his 
 wife, Lou, and their son, Richie. He must keep taking   
 cortisone tablets regularly to prevent a recurrence of  
 his illness. But the "miracle" cure turns into its own  
 nightmare as Ed starts to abuse the tablets, causing    
 him to experience increasingly wild mood swings.
