The extras in US release are:

Production commentary
Deleted scenes
Comic Book art
Brigitte's journal
Storyboards

The US release DOES NOT INCLUDE:

Audition Tapes: (12:17)
Behind of scenes: 6 Part Documentary (22:20)
2 TV-Spots (30 sec each)
Still Gallery
Ginger Snaps 3 Teaser
Trailers (in english and french)
and French audio 2.0/5.1, of course.

Look in ""http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=4771"" for more detailed information.

Still, some extras is better than no extras at all.

Thanks for sharing Dante.Xavier.
