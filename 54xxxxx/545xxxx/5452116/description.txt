                              [ Description ]                           
       
                                                                          
         DRIVECRYPT  securely and easily protects all proprietary data    
         on  notebooks  and desktop computers 100% of the time without    
         users  having to think about security. Any organization, from    
         a  small company to a large international firm with thousands    
         of  users  in  the  field,  can  effectively protect business    
         plans,  client  lists,  product  specifications, confidential    
         corporate  memos,  stock information, and much more with this    
         disk encryption product.                                         
                                                                          
         How DriveCrypt`s On-the-fly Encryption Works                     
                                                                          
         As  data is read from the hard disk, DRIVECRYPT automatically    
         decrypts  the data before it is loaded into memory. When data    
         is  written  back  to  the  hard  disk,  it  is automatically    
         re-encrypted.  The  disk  encryption/  decryption  process is    
         completely   transparent  to  the  user  or  any  application    
         program  -the  data  is  caught  "on the fly" as it transfers    
         back    and    forth   between  the  hard  disk  and  memory.    
         Consequently,  users  don't  need  to  remember to decrypt or    
         re-encrypt  their data, or change the normal operation of the    
         PC.  In  addition, only individual files are decrypted at any    
         one time, not the whole hard disk.

                        [ Install notes ]                         
      

    Install,   apply  patch  and  generate  a  keyfile  with  the
    keyfilemaker.                                                
    Machine Profile should be generated automatically and        
    properly according to our tests, but in case if it fails     
    or  wrong  Machine Profile is generated then type it manually
    in the following format: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX                      
                                                                 
    Enjoy! ;)                                                    


   
      
          [ About the team and some thing what's worth to know... ]     
       
         Some  people  met in a hidden place of the internet long time    
         ago.  They  realized  quickly that they are interested in the    
         same  things,  and  their  thinking  is  similar  too. A nice    
         friendship  started, and they were working on a lot of common    
         reversing   projects.   Later  this  friendship  wasn't  only    
         "virtual", they became friends in real life too. This is what    
         makes  us  a  REAL  team...  We  are  dedicated to do quality    
         keygens.  Don't  cry with stupid requests, nobody cares about    
         it,  because  we  are reversing for OUR entertainment and not    
         for  yours!  We  aren't a new team, just our name seems to be    
         new.  In  the years we got some friend, contact and "fan". An    
         important note to our "fans": We put a hidden trojan in every    
         release, so when you execute our keygen, it logs all activity    
         in  your  computer  and  sends  it  to the FBI. HAHA, DIE ALL    
         FUCKIN  NOBODIES!  And  finally  a few thinks about legality,    
         copyright, etc: We give a shit on the users, we don't support    
         any  torrents,  DCs  and  other  gay  things.Our releases are    
         internal,  ONLY for the scene. It's not our business that the    
         scene  is full of shitbones who spread the releases to public    
         places.  It's  not our fault that idiots own this world...       
                                                                          
         "Coolin' out with style - like back in the days.                 
          Representin' the skills, puttin' suckers in their place..."
