â€œThe Weird Missing Case of Mr. Jâ€ is a detective-comedy centered around fund manager Seung-pil Jeong (Beom-su Lee). Seung-pil Jeong manages some 50 billion wons in assets and suddenly disappears one day. His fiance Mi-seon (Gyu-ri Kim) reports Seung-pil missing to the police. An overly aggressive detective named Inspector Kim (Chang-min Son) then suspects Mi-seon (Gyu-ri Kim) as the likely suspect â€“ she took out an insurance policy on Seung-pil Jeong just the week before he went missing. Meanwhile, the disappearance of Seung-phil becomes a hot topic on national television.
