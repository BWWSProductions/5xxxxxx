Awards

According to AV-Comparatives, Kaspersky Anti-Virus rates highly amongst virus scanners in terms of detection rates, even despite the fact that the program has failed two Virus Bulletin tests in 2007 and another two in 2008. In addition, PC World awarded Kaspersky Anti-Virus 6 the Editor's Choice in its 2007 anti-virus comparative. The well-known and highly regarded Ars Technica lists Kaspersky as one of the best choices for Anti-Virus on the Windows platform.

Kaspersky Anti-Virus was "A-listed" by the UK PC journal PC Pro in late 2007, where it scored very highly for detection and removal of malware. PC Pro attributes this to â€œa combination of the softwareâ€™s heuristic scanning and uncompromising approach to database updates. While many packages check for new virus signatures on a daily basis, Kaspersky runs to an hourly schedule, improving your chances of being immunized before an infection reaches it.â€ 

Kaspersky Anti-Virus was tested by PassMark in June 2008 and was accoladed as having the "the industry's fastest scan times" on Windows Vista.
