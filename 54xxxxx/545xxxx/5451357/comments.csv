Whenever you're using a full functioning trial version of antivirus (whether you have 30 days or 1 day left) follow my instructions: in kaspersky settings --settings--disable self-defense--exit kaspersky.Open registry (type regedit in RUN ) --navigate to HKEY LOCAL MACHINE\software\kapserskyLab\protected\avp9\environment\pcid. In pcid click modify and change last three digits with any digits you want .Start kaspersky and activate AGAIN your 30 day trial. You welcome."
