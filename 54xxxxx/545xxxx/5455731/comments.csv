,piegore,2010-09-11T00:23Z,"Great! It is only missing Endgame but oh well... it's only one album missing which you can torrent on this site anyway, at an extremely high speed may I add.
Anyway.. this is great! Very fast download!"
,JSGuitar4Life,2010-09-18T07:08Z,Very well done and organized discography; good quality and safe.
,JSGuitar4Life,2010-09-18T07:09Z,"Well done and safe torrent, everything is of good quality and well-organized. Thanks!"
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-16T09:19Z,"Guys, the audio in this torrent is 128kbps, thats rubbish... why would you want that kind of quality?

Download this instead: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5211645/Megadeth_-_Dyskografia_%281984-2008%29_%5Bmp3_128-320kbps%5D

That has EVERYTHING this torrent has (and more)... and most importantly... 320kbps quality! Compare the two and you'll see what I mean.

@ Uploader: no one wants 128kbps, but thanks for your effort."
,xxxchromaticxxx,2011-01-16T09:21Z,For 320kbps engame: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5687663/Megadeth_-_Endgame_%5B320Kbps%5D
,maggot11,2011-02-15T01:29Z,"128bkps has its upsides, mainly if you were putting it on a phone or ipod where sound quality isn't that great anyway and it helps keep the size to a more managable level, Thanks for uploading"
,man_made_oblivion,2011-08-07T23:23Z,chromatic needs to shut the hell up and quit bashing your upload. Thanks man. I want 128. So chromatic is obviously an idiot.
,Polaris6,2011-08-12T23:27Z,128kbps managable file size? LOL its 2011 everyone should be using at least 320kbps. The difference in filesize for mp3s is so small its neglible with the amount of hardrive space and flash memory these days.
,cannabays,2011-12-16T17:49Z,"Excellent torrent and collection, flawlessly organized! Missing only Endgame (and of course Th1rt3en, now). Having heard about 80% of it all I can tell you it works perfectly! Thank you so very much for the upload, JumpInTheFire!!!

@xxxchromaticxxx & @Polaris6: u mite wanna consider da fact dat most of us r all grown ups, & fairly intelligent ppl. If we dl dis torrent it's probly cos we consider it fits our requirements.

What an excellent demonstration of grown-up speak :D

Crap audio quality torrents are like a plague that kill high quality torrents because most of the grown ups here have no idea what 128kbps or ""bad audio quality"", if you will,  means and they just download that.

Today all mp3 players have the memory to store more than enough high quality rips and additionally software like iTunes can automatically re-encode files while transferring to the mp3 player.

I'm not saying that 128kbps isn't usable in any situation. There just is absolutely no excuse to distributing or storing 128kbps since the conversion can be done on the fly as needed. Or would you convert your digital photo albums to 640x480 50% compression just to save some space?

Still, I respect the uploader for organizing the collection. I know it's hard work since I have thousands of songs almost perfectly tagged and organized in an archive in which I don't allow below 192kbps songs."
