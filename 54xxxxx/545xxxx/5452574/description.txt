Greetings fellow music lovers,

First, JFLabs is a fictitous name i'll be using to denote bootlegs that have been mastered by myself & assistant.  I used to work as an audio mastering engineer in the music industry for almost 20 years. Now my health is not so good & i'm disabled & retired.  This gives me the time to work on projects like this one...as long as my health is decent.  I wish to remain anonymous for any possible legal issues regarding bootlegs...ya never know in today's world:-(   I treat each track as if they were final mixes placed on my desk to be mastered.  I only deal with high quality recorded & mixed tracks...stuff I'm gonna listen to myself after they are mastered. On to this series of tracks.

First, I chose only tracks that were recorded & mixed somewhat pretty good (except for the 2 Bonus songs...i couldn't resist adding them even though they have their share of hiccups & the quality of recording is not up to par). I did some edits (removed clicks, crackle, hiss, corrected speed/pitch, fades...etc.), then went about the mastering procces. I tried hard to stay away from compressing the mids & was real careful not to limit them to death so as to keep the dynamics/transients intact. They are limited to around 12.3db--15db, which is a good comprimise between loudness & dynamics. Don't expect them to sound like officially released tracks...although i do prefer some of these over their official counterpart. Some tracks were just not recorded good enough (wild horses, sweet virginia, all down the down_acoustic...etc.), but still sound pretty good. The songs are in no particular order, i figure you can make your own cd's with the tracks you like best. Check out the samples in the mp3(320kbps) sample file.  My deepest gratitude goes out to all who have shared/uploaded these gems...you know who you are!

Please upload this to other sites, but keep the files unchanged so myself & others can help seed it (less chance this will be sold for money...which i strongly don't want to happen...DO NOT SELL). Thanks and enjoy the music. Hopefully some live stones will be coming soon as well as a few others.  Comments are especially welcome, let me know what you think.

p.s.  This needs some art work, if someone could do that it would be greatly appreciated!
