My PMP prep journey came to an end a few days ago when I cleared the cert exam. I got a lot of help from TPB & thank you all for DL'ing my torrents. This is my last upload on PMP, & though these books will not help you on the exam as they are about Program and Portfolio management, the info is good to know if you are thinking of a career in projects. 

May the 4th be with you!!

I will take a couple of days off & then start uploading stuff on GMAT. My next target.
