    Just when he thought his life was regaining some semblance of         
    normality, Simon's wonder years are once again turned upside down     
    when the evil wizard Sordid returns from the grave with only one      
    thing on his mind - revenge ! Sordid's Fortress of Doom is            
    reconstructed and Sordid has a new robotic body. He sends a magical   
    wardrobe to fetch Simon but it accidentally ends up on the doorstep   
    of Calypso, the wizard Simon had to save in the last game. Simon      
    then starts to look for a fuel called mucusade which he needs to      
    power the wardrobe in order to get home. Journey with Simon through   
    this inevitable sequel to the best selling Simon the Sorcerer (also   
    available on the AppStore), as he manages once more to get stuck in   
    a land of twisted fairytales, recycled gags and carbon dated clich   
    s ! With a cast of thousands (mostly woodworm) and enough Swampy      
    Stew to keep an underprivileged country sick for a year, this         
    classic adventure will keep you well entertained until we manage to   
    make another sequel. http://www.iphsoft.com/simon2
