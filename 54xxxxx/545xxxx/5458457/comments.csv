,clumzyclutz,2010-03-24T11:20Z,"first i tried the reloaded version but to no avail and so when this came out i was very happy. However after installing and copying over crack files i start the game...launcher says choose language, i choose english and click launch and wait patiently for the game to start. It wont. WTF! anyone know what i might be able to do?"
,clumzyclutz,2010-03-24T12:05Z,ok strike my last comment. i do have another problem though...im not able to save the game
,WTFX,2010-03-24T13:10Z,"clumzyclutz, create offline gfwl acc.

to others, it is a valid proper reason so quit whining. don't u know how the scene works? they give fuck all about p2p so be thankful u can even reach theses releases. i have also seen reports on pads not functioning correctly for some ppl in rld rls.

the keyb. and mouse combo is quite clumsy in this game. tried myself in the demo and the controls were just awkward to remember as they weren't similar to others. not impossible, but 360 pad has a great feel and the vibration is also some extra.

that aside, game kicks ass!"
,WTFX,2010-03-24T13:41Z,"ok, not sure about the gfwl, dunno if it has it. i just saw that comment around somewhere. i think this was supposed to use steamworks only."

Here is how i did it.

1.Extract the files.

2. Create a folder and call it Just Cause 2. Note: Don,t place the folder in your program files dir

3. Mount the image and direct it to the folder you just created.

4. Copy all the contact from the SKIDROW folder on the DVD image to the Just Cause 2 folder.

Note: you want to use the JustCause2.game.exe file to launche the game.

Have fun and if you like the game BUY THE GAME!

Running on Windows 7 64-bit, and my specs are above the recommended. Yes, all the other components are installed, drivers are up to date. Regardless, of anything it seems, what I do - The game just freezes. Anyone else with this problem?

Oh, maybe another important note: It did NOT freeze or anything, the very first time I played it. I played for +3 hours straight without any problems what-so-ever. Take care and thank you for readin' !"

3. install Microsoft visual C++ redistribution package, u can install this in the vcredist where your game was installed
just look for program files -> SQUARE ENIX - Eidos Interactive -> vcredist -> vcredist_x86.exe

4. u need to download and install game for microsoft live, google search it --> gfwlivesetup.exe  (dont have to login)

5. copy all files from Skidrow folder int the mount DVD and paste it on your C drive where the game was installed (program files -> SQUARE ENIX - Eidos Interactive -> just cause 2)

6. one of the file justcause2.exe will be detected as virus due to modification, u need to exclude that file from your anti virus program.

,Call-Me-Kenneth,2011-11-21T11:53Z,"Hey, i followed all the steps but the game wanst running, theres one final thing taht you MUST do in order to make this work. go to the install dirr, then back up one level, so all you see is the ""just cause 2"" folder, then do right click and select properties. AND MAKE SURE THE READ ONLY CHECK MARK IS UNCHECKED! if th game is not runing, 100% sure youll see it ticked, just untick it, then select apply. you will get another prompt asking if you want to apply this to the folder alone or to ALL files and subfolders. select ALL. then start the game with admin rights. :D"
