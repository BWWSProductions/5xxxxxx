If you decide to update any in set 1 can you just include them in set 3 as well to make it easier?"
,kaarma33,2010-03-23T05:02Z,"For reviewing Set 1, I did find two new Donld Duck scans from the freedisneycomics website (Too many Pets, new cover for Christmas on Bear Mtn and a one pager in Golden Christmas tree), so I updated 3 issues.  Then I liked how the more cropped comic scans looked better on my HP mini laptop.  I am in the process of cropping Set 1.
Set 1 isn't too large a download and you can pick and choose the updated comics with utorrent software.  Release date for Set 1 version 2 won't be until at least end of April. "
,wtcls123,2010-03-23T12:16Z,Thanks for your effort.
,kaarma33,2010-03-30T17:12Z,CBDA Set 3 now available!
,kaarma33,2010-05-23T22:41Z,"4c0367 - Donald Duck in ""A Christmas for Shacktown"" CBDA.cbr is the correct title for that comic.
Two more days and I'll have Set 5 ready!
