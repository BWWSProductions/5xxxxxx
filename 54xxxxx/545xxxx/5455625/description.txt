*********************************

Enjoy!


Set 3 is now available!
I am still putting together set 8-10 and 12.  

Found an excellent free disney comics website for updates.
Much thanks goes to that guy who has posted many more recent 
scans of wdc&s stories.  It gives me a quite a few more comics
to update though.

Possible version 2 of Set 1, since I found two new 
nice versions of duck stories on that freedisneycomic 
website and I like to trim the comics as much as possible.
The trimmed comics look really nice on a mini notebook pc!


For set 11, I am encoding mkv videos of Carl Barks' Donald Duck 
short videos from the Chronological Donald Duck. 4+gb of cartoons.
(7.9 GB)
 
For set 12, I can put together Carl Barks' Ducktales .mkv 
videos from the DVDs.


The CBDA collection will be complete, but if you can find better scans 
than posted within this collection, then
please leave a message and post up your comic scans.


I will update this list as I go along.
Thanks for helping!
