Inspired by nature, ancient mysteries and cultures, Medwyn develops his music from his Studio in rural Cornwall. He plays over a dozen instruments and has evolved unique styles of instrumental music, which are highly melodic, expressive and inspiring. His music magically blends many acoustic instruments as in "The Scroll" and "Medicine Woman 2" although Medwyn continues to enthral us as he breaks ever-new ground with such critically acclaimed contemporary albums as "Millennium" which won the album of the year in 1999 and "Comet"; which was nominated for various prestigous awards, Medwyn never ceases to share his journey with us from the gentle tones of "Timeless" to the mystical power of Rhythm of the Ancients, he is a master of his genre.
