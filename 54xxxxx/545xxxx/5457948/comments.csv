[V],mothergoose56,2010-03-24T03:49Z,"Well, he must think so if he's advertising on 202. Patrice was on his show, and I've noticed Bill Burr working ""new world order"" comments in to his act as well. I'm not saying I believe everything he says, in fact I lost quite a bit of respect for him when he crashed that gun rally a month or two ago. Not sure if he's gotten so paranoid that he didn't notice he was shouting down people who are (were?) supporters of his or not. Either way it was counter productive.

Those so called supporters were never his supporters. Just research them. They set speaking times with a bull horn (LOL) for the same time he said he was going to be there. He said the day and time, they made it a speaking event with a bullhorn...damn rookies...

Goose I love your work, really appreciate it alot. Although I think Op and Ant have gone downhill since Sirius won't let them do anything. But I'm not sure what there is to disagree with him on, he doesn't make up anything. He only covers government documents and media reporting that you could find yourself."

Maybe they should embrace the concept....they could use a new bit."
