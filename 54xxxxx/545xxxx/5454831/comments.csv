,Daiquirii,2010-09-03T03:30Z,"Alright, so I've gotten a bunch of these avi files from many sources that just don't play, on mac or pc.

I can't encode it with some encoders, but the converters that DO work don't have cracks online.  Can anyone just make a normal file of any kind?"

,ARABMONEE,2011-02-01T06:06Z,@zeitgeist...i dont think its cool to joke about viruses on other peoples torrents. if a simple lack of comments scares u than get your torrent off another user plain n simple. thanks for the upload SIRS!
