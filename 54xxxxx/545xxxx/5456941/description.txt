The Cult (2010): Pilot.

The resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This series pilot aired on CBC on Mar 22, 2010. I have no idea whether this pilot will be followed by other episodes

I would appreciate if people could seed this longer than usual, since this show does not seem to have been advertised but stars some well known Canadian actors including Torri Higginson (who played Dr. Elizabeth Weir on Stargate Atlantis) and Ian Tracey (who played Jimmy Reardon on Intelligence).

There seems to be very little info available online for this series. One reference I found said that Angus Fraser "wrote and produced an hour long pilot for CBC/GRANADA/ITV Global called The Cult. It was directed by Kari Scogland and stars Henry Czerny and Torri Higginson."

Episode info: A first year student vanishes a month after classes begin. Nathan (Henry Czerny) and Evelyn Pfahl (Torri Higginson) are the smart, accomplished, soon to be divorced parents. Late one night while watching TV, Nathan sees their estranged daughter in an infomercial. It's quickly determined that she's missing and in a cult. In fact, she's the centre of it.
