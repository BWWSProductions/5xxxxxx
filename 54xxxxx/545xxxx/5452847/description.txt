STAR RESONANT - Ryuâ˜†  Tribute

This torrent is made of five CDs containing released, unreleased, and mixed tracks of Ryuâ˜† , also known as Ryu*, and Ryutaro Nakahara. Ryuâ˜†  is a Japanese DJ and music composer for Konami's Beatmania series, along with creating individual releases as well as under the Exit Trance and beatnation labels. Some of his better known tracks are Starmine, Rainbow Rainbow, AGEHA, Mind Mapping, and the Caramelldansen and Caipirinha remixes.

I, QMDMQ, am releasing this torrent since I am a fan of Ryuâ˜†'s unique blend of happy hardcore, techno, and trance, and in trying to obtain every album of his, STAR RESONANT was exceptionally difficult to obtain. Hopefully putting this on Demonoid and ThePirateBay will enable more users to hear his style.

For what it's worth, my favorites out of the five discs are: SpecNonstop (Shortened) [I later discovered by absolute chance it's a track called Pumpin` Rabbit Express (Grabbing Tanga Remix) from the album Teranoid Overground Edition], Brother Soul, Shining Stars, HARDCOREmix (The last five minutes of it), and PONYO on the Cliff.
