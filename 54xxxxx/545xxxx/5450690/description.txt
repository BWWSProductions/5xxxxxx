    Mega Man is back and better than ever in this updated version of      
    the legendary platformer. For the hardcore Mega Man fan, the new      
    Classic Mode allows you to experience the game in its original        
    incarnation with all the enemies, movement and action you             
    remember.                                                             
                                                                          
    More casual players can toggle off Classic Mode and enjoy a           
    rebalanced gameplay experience with more forgiving controls,          
    scaled-down enemies and an auto-fire option.                          
                                                                          
    Both modes can now be played in landscape mode in addition to the     
    portrait mode that was available in the original release.
