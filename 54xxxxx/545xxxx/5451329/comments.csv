,RedhackHD,2011-10-21T00:31Z,"Dear DragonBall fans,
I,m seeding the best i can and i hope you guys will do this to.
I,m downloading with 200 kb/s right now and i,m happy with it considering you're download speeds.
Bye the way, who hopes there will be another DragonBall animation series after DragonBall GT."
,AILD,2012-02-23T09:38Z,"pls do seed i just started the torrent.
and i really think there should be another dragonball series. im hoping there will be one."
,gm1993,2012-03-27T02:54Z,"Hey guys stuck at 97.2%, you don't need to download the full thing. Once you get to 97.2% everything except for 2 of the movies and episode 143 should be completely downloaded, meaning you should be able to watch them. I'm using BitTorrent 7.0, and when you click the ""Files"" tab you can see how much (in %) each of the individual files has downloaded. Probably can also be done with other torrent clients. I've watched episodes 1-13 thus far and they work perfectly although I'm also stuck at 97.2%. Hope this helps."
,gm1993,2012-03-27T02:56Z,"Oh I forgot to say, this is kind of implied but if a file under the ""Files"" tab reads ""100%,"" It's watchable."
