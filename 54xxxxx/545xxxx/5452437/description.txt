From back cover:

  Edna Buchanan, best-selling author and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, writes novels that crackle with action, suspense, and street-smart wit. When she released the first mystery featuring Britt Montero, a quirky and abrasive Miami newpaper reporter, fans across the country clamored for more. Margin of Error joins Suitable for Framing and Act of Betrayal in this popular series. 
  On the streets of Miami, where herds of celebrities and criminals roam at large, sometimes it→s difficult for Britt to tell the preditors from the prey, especially since she met Lance Westfell. A film superstar, he has joined her on the job to research a role in his latest film, Margin of Error. With his well-known face, he draws unpredictable crowds wherever they go. 
  But when a staged explosion on the movie set misfires, killing a technician who was standing in for Lance, Britt suspects that there→s someone who wants to make drastic changes to the ending of Margin of Error, at least for the star. Join Brett and her handsome companion as they race to find the killer before the shooting stops. Narrator Barbara Caruso→s reading captures all of Britt Montero→s bravado and her growing fascination with Lance.
