[V],twentyforty,2010-03-24T09:54Z,"Thank you. I am big fan of this show from first episode. I never understood such small number of downloads. First Season was 360p .mkv (matroska), and I was thinking ""that's the reason""... I switched to small-sized H264... nothing has changed - and now - I do it for myself and few people out there...

Thanks again and seed as long as you can - this show need and - deserve it."
