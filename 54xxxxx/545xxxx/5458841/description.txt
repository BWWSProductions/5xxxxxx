This is a collection of nearly all the books for Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition as well as tons of extras. Does not include the Living Forgotten Realms, and as far as I can tell is missing only the Player's Handbook 3 and Hammerfast. This is my first time making a torrent, so please be kind; if I am missing any other books please let me know.
