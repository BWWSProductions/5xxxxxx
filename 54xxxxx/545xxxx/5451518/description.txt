Tired of paying tolls?  (If you said no, immediately exit this page and never visit my account again)

In many states, you can buy a service (it goes by different names) where you put a small plastic box on the inside of the top of your driver's window, and then you can drive through the faster lanes (going under a RFID reader) uninterrupted.  These two files discuss how to modify the boxes, spoof ID numbers, and even how to monetize this.  The backend of the toll system is also discussed.  This is the high-tech way to deal with this problem....
