,sistromo,2010-03-22T14:51Z,Religion of the world? That's a laugh! 
,wielkidupek,2010-03-22T21:12Z,"@sistromo I think ""pomzbatala"" does not mean exactly "" - religion of the world"". He was going to say ""..one of religions of the world"".
Let me put it like this:There is a very famous book ""Religions of the World"". If someone will talk about just one of them... it's enough to change plural:""Religions"" into singular: ""Religion""...
Simple? - Simple but incorrect...
My english is very poor as well - that's why i can understand ""pomzbatala's"" mistake..
By the way: Thank You very much ""sistromo"" for all the good job You're doing here! "
