V-Ray was developed by Chaos Group in an effort to raise the bar on the rendering and raytracing standards set by more expensive systems, but at a fraction of the cost. The result is a rendering tool that offers an incredible suite of features that should satisfy even the most hardcore users without breaking the bank. And the output will stun users in terms of both realism as well as overall control.
Animal Logic, Rezn8, Digital Dimension, Encore Hollywood are among the many V-Ray customers that acknowledged the fast, flexible, production-oriented rendering solution from Chaos Group. Packed with a rich set of high-tech cutting-edge features, V-Ray has become the renderer of choice for many broadcast, architectural visualizations SFX companies around the world.
