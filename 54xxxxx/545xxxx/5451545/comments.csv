I suspect this is to do with openbittorrent.com being unconnectable. If anyone has this torrent, completely, or just more than 9.52%, please connect to one of these other available trackers (or others from trackon.org):

Thanks ~~PidGin128
Also, thanks to the original leaker, uploader, and all seeders."
