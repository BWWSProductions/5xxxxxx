           A mysterious love story between Hamburg and Taipeh. The        
           unsolved murder of her young Taiwanese lover Ai-ling           
           leaves the Hamburg artist Sophie Schmitt completely            
           disoriented. She dedicates a video-installation to her         
           and shows it in Taipei. During the opening she is              
           approached by a mysterious journalist. Sophie is               
           fascinated at first glance by Mei-li, the young                
           journalist. Mei-li takes her to visit the famous Taipei        
           night markets and tries to seduce the artist. Sophie,          
           still mourning her lost lover, rejects Mei-li and returns      
           immediately to Hamburg. Shortly afterwords Mei-li shows        
           up on her doorstep, unannounced. Sophie takes her in and       
           finally falls for her. But soon she realizes that her new      
           lover is secretly investigating Ai-ling's death. Strange       
           happenings occur, sudden flashes of recollection come and      
           go, and then Sophie finds out that there is no Mei-Li          
           working for a Taiwanese newspaper and that no one by that      
           name ever entered Germany. Who is the mysterious               
           Taiwanese woman?
