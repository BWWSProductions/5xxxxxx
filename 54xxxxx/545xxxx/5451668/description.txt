 RELEASE NOTES:                                                             
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                              
 Rental Property Manager (RPM) is a one-stop database for managing your     
 rental property information. RPM is designed by a property manager to meet 
 your unique needs. It is for real estate professionals and private         
 property investors alike.                                                  
                                                                            
 Using RPM, you can save and manage data about your properties, tenants,    
 and financial transactions. RPM includes advanced reporting functions that 
 create spreadsheets with the rental information you need.                  
                                                                            
 Is your property portfolio residential, commercial, rural, or varied? Do   
 you have two or three properties, or two or three hundred? RPM can grow    
 with your portfolio. It's a small investment to help you manage your       
 larger ones.                                                               
                                                                            
 Many property managers use spreadsheets or hand written records to keep    
 track of data. This is a slow and error-prone process. Entering data into  
 Rental Property Manager takes only minutes. Optimized data entry screens   
 and sensible defaults makes data entry easy and pre-defined reports makes  
 getting it out again just as fast.                                         
                                                                            
 Rental Property Manager's customizable alerts mean that you will never     
 miss a rent review or overdue payment again. Automatic rent calculation    
 and payment tracking mean that you always know who owes what, down to the  
 cent. A comprehensive list of property expenses means that you are         
 prepared at tax time.                                                      
                                                                            
 A central data location means that you have only one place to look for     
 that crucial information. Income and expense records are at your           
 fingertips. Contact details for long-gone tenants are easily found.        
 Appliance model numbers and room dimensions are immediately available.
