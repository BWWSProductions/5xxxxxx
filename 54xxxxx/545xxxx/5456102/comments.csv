[T],Magash,2010-03-23T21:18Z,It's about 1:15PM California time and I have to stop seeding this for about 7 to 10 hours depending on how much work I have at this job. Just letting those that care that I will be seeding it again till I get the rest of it up. 
[T],Magash,2010-03-23T23:14Z,Job cancled till tomorrow. I'll be done seeding this by then. 
,Mercyflush64,2010-03-25T22:38Z,"I have been stalled at 63-84% on all three of these because there has not been a full 100% copy to download from. If you can seed them I can leave my copies available until more seeders can finish, nobody gas a complete d/l yet."
[T],Magash,2010-03-26T05:49Z,No longer have them on the computer to seed. I won't be doing the rest of the volumes either. My isp limits my upload speed to 250 kbs so it just takes to long with files that large. 
[T],Magash,2010-03-26T19:19Z,I'm gonna start over and load them up one disc at a time.
