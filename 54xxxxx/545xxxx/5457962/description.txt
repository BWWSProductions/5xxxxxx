|  Henok Achido took his first step into the light in music in 2001. His     |
|  legendary feature on the two grammy winning song -Mina Hundar- became a   |
|  controversy on the Swedish hiphop scene, only at the age of 18. After     |
|  his guest appearance and touring all over Scandinavia, he still did not   |
|  create music consistently, due to personal reasons and lacking            |
|  motivation to persuade his own music career but that would took a huge    |
|  turn on the summer of 2006.                                               |

|  raised in a single parent home in the southern parts of Sweden. The       |
|  musical influence originated from his family, mainly his mother, uncle &  |
|  cousins, all huge music fans, which later persuaded him to purchase his   |
|  first vinyl with the weekly allowance at the age of 8. Although the       |
|  response for Henok was massive, he still did not feel satisfied with the  |
|  mind state and lacked maturity and the preparation to be the complete     |
|  musician he desired. After, Mina Hundar, Henok dropped out of high        |
|  school and moved to Stockholm to continue recordings but still did not    |
|  feel that his timing was right. However, that all changed in mid 2006.    |
|                                                                            |
