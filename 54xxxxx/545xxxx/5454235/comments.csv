,Leitzge,2010-03-22T18:14Z,what about episode 1?
,FragRev,2010-03-22T20:08Z,Leitzge: Just search for Pure.Pwnage.S03E01.720p. That is episode one of the TV show.
,Leitzge,2010-03-22T23:30Z,"Okay thanks, any particular reason for that?"
,NanaFreak,2010-03-23T01:00Z,also isnt this Season 3 not Season 1? or do people just not care about the online seasons?
,ZoolooCH,2010-03-23T10:13Z,Well it looks like the release group had a discussion with the consensus that the notation should only take the TV series into account. It's kinda unfortunate that they did this -- they should at least re-release the first episode as S01E01.

Not that they nobody cares about the online series, but this is the first season of the tv show"
,DoomTra1n,2010-04-09T13:20Z,"Season 03 01 is the 1st ep? thanks for the info. 

It should be Season 1 too. Since the TV show is seperate from the online series right? I know they are going to do more web shows. at least that's what I heard last time I was on their site."
