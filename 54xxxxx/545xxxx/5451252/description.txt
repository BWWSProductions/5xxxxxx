Wikipedia - Steptacular is the second studio album by British pop group Steps, released in the United Kingdom on October 25, 1999. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, where it remained on the position for three weeks, selling 260,000 copies in the same time frame. "Tragedy", "Love's Got A Hold On My Heart", "After the Love Has Gone", "Say You'll Be Mine", "Deeper Shade of Blue" and "When I Said Goodbye" were released as singles. Many of the songs also appeared on the track list of the US version of their debut album Step One. Like the group's debut album, Steptacular also contains a cover, originally released by female pop group Bananarama, entitled "Movin' On". Unlike in Step One, their version of Bee Gees' "Tragedy" was recorded in this album as a main track and not a bonus track. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, selling 84,000 units in its first weekâ€”only 1,000 copies ahead of Westlife's debut album, Westlife, beating the phenomenal Irish boyband. Early UK copies of the album featured a holographic silver "STEPS" logo on front. It was also released in cardboard and tin boxed sets, internationally.

Amazon.co.uk Review By Ian Fortnam - Following their initial inception in 1997, the five extraordinarily exuberant members of Steps rapidly gravitated to the very peak of the pop pile with an irresistible coalition of infectious melodies, lashings of personality and charismatic sparkle. Following hot on the heels of Step One, this second collection further consolidated the band's position as a seductively up beat Abba for the 1990s. Kicking off with the triple barrelled fusillade of "Tragedy", "After The Love Has Gone" and "Love's Got A Hold On My Heart", Steptacular proceeds into hitherto uncharted areas of down-tempo maturity with the contemplative, heart-string stroking of "You're Everything That Matters To Me" and melancholic introspection of "Since You Took Your Love Away". Yet Steptacular still boasts a rich surfeit of Lisa, Faye, Lee, H and Claire's singular sonic bounce--witness the lush simplicity of 'Say You'll Be Mine', yet another sure step on the stairway to pop heaven.
