3 x 30 minute episodes - 128Kbps - Mp3 - Slimoo

Three-part documentary series in which Rory Bremner asks topical comics, satirists and comedians from different countries about their cultures and how they relate to ours - if at all.

First up is the mad bad and dangerous to know Hans Teeuwen of Holland, then Rory meets Irish comic and satirist Barry Murphy; and, last but not least, Viktor Giacobbo who has been a satirical presence in Switzerland for the best part of 30 years now. 

Rory talks to the comedians about their local take on topical comedy. The episodes also feature highlights from the comics' stand-up acts.
