The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 21 March 2010


[sebaygo1]




A live show today.

The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

Today's big topic is the so-called health reform bill, which may receive a critical vote either tonight or tomorrow.

Alex also takes a number of calls.

[NOTE: There were audio problems with the podcast files from which I prepared this torrent's edit. I compensated for them as best I could, but please don't expect it to be the best.]

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
