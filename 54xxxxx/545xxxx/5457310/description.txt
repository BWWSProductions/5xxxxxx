Born Iverson Minter in 1932, Louisiana Red has every right to sing the blues. His mother passed a week after his birth and his father reportedly suffered an early demise at the hands of the Ku-Klux-Klan. Spending much of his youth in orphanages, he finally settled at an aunt's home in Pittsburgh, PA, where he had his first taste of guitar at around age 11. Red studied at the hand of the masters, citing Muddy Waters as an early influence and mentor, plus he played along side another personal hero, John Lee Hooker. His 50+ years in the industry has afforded many great moments, including work with Albert King and Carey Bell plus session work for Chess, Atlas, Checker, and Tomato among other labels.
