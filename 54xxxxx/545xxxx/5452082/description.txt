Neon Genesis Evangelion - Collection 1

01 - Angel Attack
The year is 2015, 15 years after the first disastrous contact with the mysterious beings known as Angels resulted in the global cataclysm referred to as the Second Impact, which wiped out half of the human race. To defend humanity against future Angel attacks, the UN established the Nerv organization in Tokyo-3 to develop giant bio-mechanical mecha known as Evangelions. Now, the Angels have finally returned, and the untested Evangelions can only be piloted by specially selected 14 year olds. Shinji Ikari, estranged son of the director of Nerv, Commander Gendo Ikari, arrives in Tokyo-3 and is dragooned into piloting Evangelion Unit 01 to fight the Angel Sachiel, which is attacking the city.

02 - The Beast
Shinji wakes up in the hospital, with no memory of the fight against the Angel the night before. His father wants nothing to do with him, so Nerv's head of operations, the young and attractive Misato Katsuragi, becomes his legal guardian. Settling in to life in Misato's apartment, he eventually recalls the furious battle.

03 - A Transfer
Shinji begins school at Tokyo-3 and meets classmates Toji Suzuhara, Kensuke Aida, and Hikari Horaki. Toji is upset with Shinji because his sister was badly injured in Shinji's first fight against the Angel Sachiel. Another Angel, Shamshel, appears, and Shinji must defeat it. Shinji is pushed to his mental limit during the battle, going berserk during the last seconds, engaging the Angel in close combat and savagely disabling it. Afterwards, he is traumatized by the emotions he experienced during the battle.

04 - Hedgehog's Dilemma
Overstressed from being made an Evangelion pilot, from the events of the previous episode, and arguing with Misato, Shinji runs away from home. Shinji is soon recaptured by Nerv, but he quits being a pilot. However, at the last minute Shinji does not board his train to leave Tokyo-3 and decides to stay.
