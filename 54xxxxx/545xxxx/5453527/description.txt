Hwang Byeong Ju Gayageum Sanjo (Seong Geum Ryeon's style)
Seoul Records SRCD-4368 1995

Somebody requested some gayageum sanjo, so here you go. Gayageum is a plucked zither, something like a Japanese koto or Chinese guzheng. Sanjo is an virtuosic instrumental style of music in which the instrumentalist, accompanied by janggu (hourglass drum), works through a sequence of rhythmic structures and melodic modes. The primary modes are Ujo, Gyemyeonjo and Pyeongjo. Modes may modulate. Rhythmic cycles include Jinyangjo (slowest), Jungmori (slow), Jungjungmori (medium), Gutgeori (medium) Jajinmori (medium fast), Dongsalpuri (mediom fast), Hwimori (fast) and Eonmori (irregular). Hwimori is normally only played in gayageum sanjo (not the sanjo of other instruments). Gayageum sanjo is considered to be the most sophisticated form of sanjo. In its earlier history (19th century), sanjo was supposedly improvised. Today, it is passed down by teachers and memorized precisely. New sanjos are created by masters once they have reached a certain level of experience and recognition. Recordings of sanjo will state whose style of sanjo is being performed--in this case Seong Geum Ryeon. The final track on this CD is Jjalbeun Sanjo (short sanjo)--basically sanjo condensed down to around 10 minutes (or less).
