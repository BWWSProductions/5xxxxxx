,hauntnut,2010-04-28T06:18Z,"The video quality is very good, but the audio is terribly out of sync, which makes it unwatchable."
,crucifire,2010-11-22T11:52Z,Can anyone confirm the audio being out of sync?
,ROFL_A_PIGGY,2010-11-30T04:13Z,"I downloaded the sample first (do the same if you like) and found the quality to be dvd quality, thanks for the upload!

The audio is not out of sync, to clear up any confusion."
