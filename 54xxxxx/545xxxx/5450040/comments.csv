,mattbdon,2010-03-21T08:09Z,"Also, Ashes to Ashes and Doctor Who start on the first weekend of April. Any chance of you uploading them? Thanks again man."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-21T08:15Z,"A2A as I said - absolutely.

Dr. Who - I cannot."
[V],twentyforty,2010-03-21T10:21Z,"Number of Hit&Run exceeded 90%.
Are people so crazy?

Well, same as for Caprica yesterday - this show is GONE FOREVER from my schedule.

eztv will be lucky to have such peers.

Now... please... could someone step up and ask me for something or maybe place some request?"
,jon4fun,2010-03-21T13:48Z,"Hi 20-40.
Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon"
,mattbdon,2010-03-21T16:02Z,"Oh well Ashes to Ashes is enough thank you loads.
Any chance you could upload a little series called dr terrible's house of horrible? Again can't find it anywhere. "
,mattbdon,2010-03-21T16:06Z,"Sorry, Also is there any chance you could upload the movie Timecrimes (Los cronocrimenes)?"
,DMVIN,2010-03-21T19:01Z,"If you are taking requests, I would love to see more of My wife and kids."
,jon4fun,2010-03-24T18:02Z,"@ ALL, I have one thing to say to all you H&R FUCKS! 

This is what happens when you don't seed. 

20-40 drops it from his schedule! He warned us!

Now we fans (of this show) suffer because of you greedy bastards.

Jon"
