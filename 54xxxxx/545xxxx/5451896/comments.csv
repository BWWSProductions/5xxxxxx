sorry to hear that, I did reproduced the incident and seems like if you shutdown from ESET Internet Security it may corrupt the \Boot\BCD file. I did have the same issue and recovered from a BCD backup I have. I also tested shutting down normally with the StartMenu-->Shutdown-->Shutdown and all went fine. So my recommendation is not shutting down through ESET and if you use a Multi-Boot Menu get EeasyBCD from Neosmart Technologies (Google it) and make a backup of your BCD store . Any other problem please report it."

Even if XP SP3 LiveCD has more applications. I prefer the Win7 LiveCD. 

Thanks again for the good work."
