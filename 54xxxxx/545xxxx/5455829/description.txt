       Sonny and Tawni are invited to travel to Glandovia because the Check it Out Girls   
       are very famous there. Since Sonny and Tawni are mad at each other, only one of     
       them goes away to the foreign said to be European country, Tawni. Sonny later       
       decides to go to Glandovia to save her friendship with Tawni as she thinks she is   
       being replaced, and Tawni thinks the same. Meanwhile, an exchanged student from     
       Glandovia impresses a girl Nico and Grady like, and they both think it is because   
       of his mustache. They then wear a mustache trying to impress her, but they get      
       themselves stuck in their own mustaches because of the glue.
