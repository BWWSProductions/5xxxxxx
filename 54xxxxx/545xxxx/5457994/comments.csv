[V],twentyforty,2010-03-24T07:52Z,"@montmarte:
1. ""re-encode of pretty bad CAM""
2. ""SAMPLE is included. Download it first, then decide.""

So...
1) You cannot read.
2) You are unfortunately blind and cannot
a) read what has been said
b) watch the sample
c) decide for yourself.

If 2) is true - you want be able to see - the movie.

There is another possibility: You have been taught not to trust strangers and follow, for instance, their advice.

Well, in that case - why do you ask for judgment people you don't know (like me)?"
,athanasia2,2010-03-25T21:35Z,thanks
,denaughty,2010-04-01T00:48Z,"Thanks great movie.
can i please request Alice in Wonderland 2010?
thank you :D"
,trytryagain1,2010-04-24T06:40Z,I just saw the sample and I say thanks very much for downloading.  But I think I am going to check out a few more before I take the time to download the whole movie.  I think I would rank the vid as 5 out of 10 and audio probably 7 of ten.
