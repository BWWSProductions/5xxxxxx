Version 5 will be the last version from my hands. Someone else can take over from here.

Have some bloody fun! :D"

,zzozmo,2010-06-29T16:23Z,"Okay, I couldn't start it with the Glide Wrapper, sadly. If I could, I'd have far more advanced graphix, but this machine just refuses the compatibility.

For those who experience the same problem, I found the solution:

Download the zip from here:
http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~std04100/files/OpenGLide_009rc7.zip
and extract ""Glide2x.dll"" and ""OpenGLid.INI"" to the Carmageddon 2 folder. Now You can play the game with classic/default preferences. It still manages to crash tho, but it's far from frustrating (imo :b).

Have fun!

And thanx james9753 for this unique upload. The World needs more dedicated people like You. ;)"
