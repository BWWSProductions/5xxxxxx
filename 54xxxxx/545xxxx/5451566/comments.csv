I just started getting into house music and these fits my taste perfectly.
Other Best of Disco House, Best of House 2011 don't really have good tracks.

Thanks again."

it very much comes down to taste, really. Some like more the electronically based variant of Deep House while others prefer the one with real instruments and a live feel (or disco influenced). I myself prefer the disco influenced and jackin' house type, but I also like the electronically based type so I switch between the two every now and then when I get bored of the one I'm listening to :)"

no passwords on any of my releases. I just put them in rar to prevent cherry picking and hit & runs as I don't have unlimited monthly volume and bandwidth to seed forever :)"
