[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-01-16T22:12Z,@Mocanu: I read again your post and you talk about a dual layer DVD[DVD9]...You may try the same...[close to 8gb/disc...single sided]....These BluRayrips in mkv container are made to fit [almost all of them ] on  a single disc...Change the soft for dvd burning...Ashampoo...
