Goteborg Wind Orchestra has in the past had Naxos-successes like Swedish Summer Favourites, Christmas carols and Astrid Lindgren-songs,recordings, earning the orchestra both gold and platinum discs. In 2007 they recorded music from some of the greatest films, with the common denominator that John Williams is the composer. There are well-known themes from films like Star Wars, ET, Harry Potter and Schindler's List. Often, it is with impressive, magnificent arrangements, where the wind orchestra's resources really come into its own.
John Williams has been nominated 45 times for Academy Award and has won five times.

The band consists of 21 full-time musicians (according to the orchestras website) and its concert hall is the historic Crown House in the centre of Gothenburg, built in 1642-1655.
GWO's history began in 1905, when some employees at the Gothenburg Tramways Company, GÃ¶teborgs SpÃ¥rvÃ¤gar AB, started a brass sextet. The band grew during the years, as the Band of the Gothenburg Tramways Company, and gradually was allowed to play employed by the company.
In 1992 the name was changed to GÃ¶teborgsMusiken and since then it has served as a full-time professional ensemble. In 1997 GÃ¶teborgsMusiken was commissioned to perform as the Band of the Royal Air Force. This commission ended last year.
GÃ¶teborgsMusiken is financed by the City of Gothemburg and the Swedish Arts Council. Main sponsor is Gothemburg Tram Company.
