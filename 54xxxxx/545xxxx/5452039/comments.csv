Thanks a bunch, and +1 for no RAR nonsense.

,crowhite,2010-03-22T23:07Z,"THANK YOU SO FUCKING MUCH!

I live in Sweden and love Bill Maher. But none of the televisions network does broadcast the show so
the only way for me to see this is illegaly..

Once again, thank you!"
,Lord-Darkstorn,2010-03-22T23:18Z,"Bill Maher's a beast, but I'm holding out for the high res video.
Why's it taking so long for someone to put it on TPB?"
,truenova,2010-03-23T02:00Z,I'm glad somone finally posted the latest show. Too bad its low quality but after waiting all weekend I'll take it.
,zapfan,2010-03-23T08:58Z,"Fantastic quality for such a small file.

Thank you!"
