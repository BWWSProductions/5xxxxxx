,brewcity77,2010-03-24T01:54Z,Two possibilities...either it aired overseas and they snagged one of those (time zone ahead) or someone works at a TV station and they usually send a tape ahead of time in case the satellite goes down mid-broadcast.
,cafinatednarcotic,2010-03-24T01:57Z,"looked at the screens, and it seems to be the right one.  However he did it, wow.  Just wow."

,honunet,2010-03-25T02:52Z,The first commenter should be banned just for being stupid enough to question ez's uploads
,LtCmdLore,2010-03-25T05:04Z,"Dark_Isle is hilarious. I get all the amusement of seeing people react to spoilers, without actually having to see spoilers.

But it never ceases to amaze me how many people who DON'T WANT TO SEE SPOILERS are yet dumb enough to read the comments.

And I find it especially hilarious the sheer number of morons who start raging at him before they even find out if the spoilers are real or not.

Loads of stupid people provide hours of amusement."
,PingPang,2010-03-27T09:45Z,This is the best episode this season so far.
,afgaviria,2010-03-28T00:26Z,"thanks for the show, shame about the spoilers.
JUST DONT READ THE COMMENTS!"
,clipandgo,2010-03-28T06:11Z,"I cant believe richard finger fucked Jacobs wife who was also having a affair with MIB.

,matchstalkman,2010-03-30T04:25Z,"Many thanks to the original capper and those seeders who keep seeding.
