,TheArchiver,2010-05-30T10:24Z,"As above dude, there's no point. 320 or flac, the age of the less-than-a-terabyte hard disks is over."
,ooktar,2011-02-09T03:41Z,"the above people can go fuck themselves. Who the fuck cares about the format. This is one of the more organised torrents I've seen and your worried about the format. Its simple and easy to use and made for people who don't want to deal with organising and formatting for mobile players, not for ungrateful little shits like you who expect something free to be Perfect."

Many of Sun Ra's recordings, especially those that were originally on his ""Saturn"" label, were mid-fi (by the standards of that time) AT BEST. 128 is OK for making this much music available for mobile use."
