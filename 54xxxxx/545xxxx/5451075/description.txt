The Other Side of the Mirror - Bob Dylan Live at the Newport Folk Festival  (â€™63 - â€™65)

Few performances are as legendary â€“ or as controversial â€“ as Bob Dylanâ€™s appearance at the Newport Folk Festival. In a single, galvanizing instant, Dylan plugged an entire generation, forever changing not only the way music was made, but the way it was heard. By putting you in the audience for Dylanâ€™s Newport Performances from 1963 through that pivotal set in 1965, Academy Award winning director Murray Lernerâ€™s â€˜The Other Side Of The Mirrorâ€™ captures Dylans metamorphosis from folk prodigy to rockâ€™s fiercely confrontational poet who would electrify and inspire an entire nation and become the voice of his generation.
