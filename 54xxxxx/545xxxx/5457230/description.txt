The Spitfire Collection is a compilation album released in 2007 by Spitfire Records. The release consists of tracks from the Spitfire-era Testament titles Live at the Fillmore (actually re-released by Spitfire), Demonic (also a re-release by Spitfire), The Gathering, First Strike Still Deadly, and Live in London. Of note is the number of musicians present on this compilation; there are five different drummers (Louie Clemente, Jon Dette, Gene Hoglan, Dave Lombardo, John Tempesta), three different bassists (Greg Christian, Steve DiGiorgio, Derrick Ramirez), and four different guitarists (Glen Alvelais, James Murphy, Eric Peterson, Alex Skolnick), though Peterson appears on all tracks. Chuck Billy provides vocals on all tracks, but there is one guest vocalist: Steve Souza, who sang the last two tracks on the First Strike Still Deadly release. This compilation was released without the band's consent.
