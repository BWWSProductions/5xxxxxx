As OP said, please go to:

$3.99 to make sure they keep making these tracks. Well worth it."
,ronnycordova,2010-03-25T02:10Z,For being almost a gig and a half I would expect a bit higher resolution for the video.  Too much space was wasted keeping the original audio stream.  
,rifftraxfan,2010-03-25T06:36Z,"The video stream is directly from the JayBob rip. And if you check around, you'll see this is the smallest New Moon RiffTrax on thePirateBay. Both the others are 1.8GiB or more. So get one of those, although I haven't checked their quality."
,jeretalamen,2010-06-15T22:57Z,"What is it with people and recommending K-lite?

K-lite can cause so many problems and screw up so much... and most of the time to fix it, it's easier just to reinstall windows...

Stop recommending k-lite people!  CCCP!  Look it up!  A codec pack that installs every codec you need, nothing you don't, and doesn't bork your system!"

Where are the other torrents? I tried looking for them but I didn't find any."
