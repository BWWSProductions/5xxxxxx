     Being the sixth album from Jean F. Cochois aka The Timewriter, this latest
     one is a fresh surprise in many ways. First and foremost, he has chosen 
     the German title Tiefenschoen, wich could be translated as 'beautiful depth',
     but really it is a more poetic way of saying that in the German language. 

     Secondly, he has positioned himself in an altogether different way on a
     musical basis but still continues in his unmistakeable Timewriter style, 
     and once again proves as a producer his fine feeling for sound and musical
     arrangement. After a long musical journey beginning in 1994 with his first 
     single and subsequent albums, he now melts together his continuously
     developing sound with the sound of the good old days. The results are deep
     and tech house tracks which have a warm old school twist and flavour to 
     them at the same time as totally hitting the zeitgeist. 

     Tiefenschoen as an album is a complete whirlwind having a raw and dirty feel
     to it, albeit without losing focus on the original and well-known 
     Jean F. Cochois sound. This is an extremely strong club album with a 
     powerful recognition value â€“ not only musically, but also visually thanks
     to its album cover. Emotionally loaded with this pleasant kind of pain that
     just hurts in the right places. Not only as a producer and remixer, but also
     as DJ, The Timewriter enjoys the respect he receives internationally since
     the last 15 Years. He held a residency in Sven Vaeth's Cocoon Club and
     plays in Clubs all across the globe. On a regular basis he presents his
     own mix-CD series "Deep Train" of which Vol. 6 was voted Album of the 
     Month in Mix Mag UK
