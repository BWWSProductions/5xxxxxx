,ZenRhino,2010-03-23T18:48Z,Kudos for being the 1st ( 1st I've seen) to release a TS of this movie!! I'll report back after checking out the sample...
,agosign,2010-03-23T18:48Z,"Hi and Thank you. Dlding now, will comment in a while."
,monstr555,2010-03-23T19:16Z,Where's screens???
,luv2bleed,2010-03-23T19:23Z,"well... whata we got people???
is it watchable??"
,ZenRhino,2010-03-23T20:23Z,"Just got done checking out the sample... it's one of the best TS releases I've seen in a long time!!! The night scene isn't blacked out like with some I've seen, and the colors/whites aren't washed out either. Very good quality for sound & video... I'd say 9/9 or better... def worth getting if you can't wait til the rip or BR"
,ZenRhino,2010-03-23T20:54Z,"I made some screencaps but can't get the links to post. They are at tinypic, so if someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong, I can post them for people to see"
,ZenRhino,2010-03-23T21:01Z,"Here's a try, all are at tinypic

If it's not 100% accurate, it's my fault, not the uploader. I cut & pasted the screencap from WMP to MSpaint.

Hope this helps."

,Qryptic,2010-03-23T23:23Z,Thanks for the UL!
,agosign,2010-03-23T23:35Z,"Ok friends, just finished downloading...
Thanks uploader!
Very hard work and as far as quality, considering this is a TS, I'd give it V8-A8
Now of course, if it were labeled DVDRIP, it would be 4-7 respectively.
cheers"
