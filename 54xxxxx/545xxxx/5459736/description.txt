In each city she seeks out that region's most celebrated dishes -- the ones that define each town and create culinary rivalries -- and pits the nation's most iconic eateries in a one-to-one comparison. In blind taste tests, local food enthusiasts try to squelch the competition in a food face off unlike any other.
