IMAGiNE NOTES

Here we go again we another decent TS, got to be honest and say it is not the best we've done.
The movie was pretty much a dark film which made it harder to do and also harder to sync.
So being a dark film we opted to leave the contrast off so you can see it better...so the black does look more like a dark grey now.
Audio is pretty nice so no real problems theres.
