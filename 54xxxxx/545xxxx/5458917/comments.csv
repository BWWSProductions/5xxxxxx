Avatar.mp4/2,10 GB (2.262.809.524 bytes)"" 

The mp4 is only packed in an ISO.
Kind of weird because now you must mount the ISO before you can play it.
It's not a DVD or Blu-Ray ISO strukture !!!

Futhermore it has no srt (subtitle) files included like the original torrents has.

If you ask me it's just waste of time and bandwidth.

Just download/seed the original torrent ;
