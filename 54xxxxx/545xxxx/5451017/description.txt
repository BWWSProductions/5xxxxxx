Heartbeat City is the fifth studio album by American new wave band The Cars, released in 1984.

Heartbeat City contains a total of five American Top 40 singles, two of which ("Drive" and "You Might Think") were Top 10 as well, reaching #3 and #7, respectively. A number of songs from the album gained significant radio and TV exposure, notably "You Might Think", which had a memorable music video in heavy rotation on MTV in 1984 and 1985. Another hit single frequently seen on MTV was "Magic", in which singer/songwriter Ric Ocasek walked on waterâ€”that is, the water in a swimming pool at a backyard barbecue party. This song reached #12 in the U.S. The "Drive" video (directed by actor Timothy Hutton) showed Ocasek, who did not sing the song, arguing with a troubled young woman played by model Paulina Porizkova, whom Ocasek would soon marry. "Hello Again" had a video directed by the legendary Andy Warhol -- who also appeared onscreen, further raising the video's curiosity factor. The song "Stranger Eyes" was used in the theatrical trailer of the 1986 film Top Gun, but it never made it into the soundtrack.
