A rather well-done 1980 Television (ITC) version of the famous Dickens story, it serves as a fair introduction to the timeless tragedy. Some of the younger folks might not be familiar with some of the wonderful character actors of a bygone age that play in this production, especially the magnificent Billie Whitelaw and the inimitable Nigel Hawthorne. The download is worth it just for these performances alone. 

For the newbies, this is a love story set against the backdrop of the French Revolution. There are many versions of radio plays and audiobooks available as torrents for those who are interested. Generally considered to be one of the finest things ever written in the English language, it contains perhaps the most famous opening and closing lines in literary history:

"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times..."

"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known."
