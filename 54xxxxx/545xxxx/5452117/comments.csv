now, it says that this keygen or code wont patch it because its not the correct OS, and im on vista.

I think i remember getting this to work before, but im not sure on which computer. Ill keep trying, while i expect some kind of answer as to why i should even  give this group a chance."

Ive tried winRAR and then winACE actually asked me for Part #2, but i still didnt see it combine the two 9,112KB setup files into 1.. Are there 2 included or what the fuck is going on. Im going to try 7zip, and IZarc next"
