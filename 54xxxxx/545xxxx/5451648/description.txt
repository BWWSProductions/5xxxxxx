    Don't let the balloons get away! Pop as many as you can within the    
    time limit!                                                           
                                                                          
    Balloonz! is an addicting arcade game for all ages. The concept is    
    simply to pop as many of the colorful balloons as you can to          
    achieve the highest score! Play either in hard or easy. Play Easy     
    and drag your finger across the screen to pop the balloons. Play      
    Hard and you have to be a little more precise to pop the balloons!    
                                                                          
    To pop the balloons, simply just tap on the screen at the location    
    of each colored balloon to score points. Avoid the black balloons     
    because they deduct points. You'll receive 10 points for each         
    colored balloon. Get a high score and get prompted to post it         
    online and show off your achievement to the world.                    
                                                                          
    There are four power-ups; STARS will increase the amount of           
    balloons to pop (Means More Points!), BOMBS will wipe out every       
    balloon but give you half the points for each balloon (Hit A Bomb     
    After A Star To Get A Big Jump In Points!), TIME-CLOCK adds 10        
    seconds to your game (More Game Time Means More Points!), and         
    SKULLS generates black balloons. (Careful Not To Get The SKULLS!)     
                                                                          
    Balloonz! consists of 3D balloon models, and real time lighting       
    for the 3GS and 3rd generation IPod. The balloons are controlled      
    by real-time physics and mimic real life balloons floating through    
    the air.                                                              
                                                                          
    If you don't have a 3GS iPhone or 3RD gen iPod Touch, the game        
    will change its settings for you.
