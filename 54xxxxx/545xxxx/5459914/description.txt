PLEASE SEED AND COMMENT

The Pretty Blue Guns have been playing shows all South Africa for the past few years with some of the countryâ€™s top acts, ranging from small intimate theatre shows to huge festival stages. 

Their style has been described as â€œgritty blues rockâ€, with influences ranging from early Robert Johnson era blues and Tom Waits to modern rock giants such as The White Stripes or Kings Of Leon.

â€œWhat the Pretty Blue Guns do well, is introduce this genre of music to an audience that would not normally be familiar with it, back to a time when music was still considered an art. Not only do they introduce it, but they set the standard for others to follow.â€ -morethanmusic.co.za


They recently released an album entitled â€œCutting Headsâ€, the name of which is a reference to blues buskers in the 1920â€™s that would battle for tips from passers-by, playing the same traditional blues songs as other buskers, except finding ways to make the songs more interesting and more entertaining in order to capture the attention and respect of the crowds. The album has been received with critical acclaim:


â€œI can honestly say these guys, with the help of a brilliant producer and sound engineer have made an album thatâ€™s difficult to switch off once you started listening.â€ -samusicblog.co.za

â€œâ€¦if you are a fan of any version of the blues, you will love Cutting Heads.â€ -twindie.net

â€œâ€¦itâ€™s a great album, I can almost describe the album as modern vintage, uniting the old and new into a complete package that is â€œCutting Headsâ€. â€“morethanmusic.co.za

â€œA fine, fine release from a shit-hot band. Highly recommended.â€ -Muse Magazine (4/5 Stars)

The Pretty Blue Guns do not follow the expectations of any particular "scene", and they have been praised for their heartfelt approach to the creation of music and their identity as a musical force that does not follow trends, but instead stays true to its roots.
