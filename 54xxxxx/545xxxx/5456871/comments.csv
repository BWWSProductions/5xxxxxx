,Annonsi,2010-03-29T01:06Z,"Well, i very happy about this release, but...
As far as i know, a most of cg pros are still using 2009, or 9 version. Yea 2010 is the newest, but it still have the dn4 bug with  antialias, and a huge performance and graphite switch time lags.
I it really such a big problem for cracking most used versions, not just one?
Each vray version has faster rendering times, thats the reason of using it, but its painfull to load each time scene from 2009 to 2010, where i cant change anything because of lags and low fps.I wish youl throw 2009 version too someday, thanx bwt."
