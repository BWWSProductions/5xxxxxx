,Jaret2008,2009-08-12T12:40Z,"Audio 8/10 Video 7.5/10 - Way better than the other GI Joe I downloaded, the audio is pretty clear and in sync with the video, the video is definately watchable, not dvd quality, but closer  to VHS format. The video may be slightly blurred but for the most part it is the best I've seen yet and the contrast is set properly so dark scences are easy to make out... I hope this is enough information for anyone who is wondering what the qaulity is like. Thank you to "".BONE"" for uploading a far superior screener. Peace"
