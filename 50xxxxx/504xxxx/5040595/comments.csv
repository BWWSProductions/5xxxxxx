,nuktriggerpuller,2009-08-04T03:16Z,I understand. Us achievers are going to have to pay for the existence of those who depend on us aka the government. It's the producer verses the leecher. 
,ZERO_BS,2009-08-04T03:17Z,"Thank you!


The extra hours may suck, but don't you feel nice sponsoring a jonesing crackhead from Harlem?"

,booboo332,2009-08-04T03:53Z,All your grammar are belong to us.
,trickdaddy0024,2009-08-04T04:07Z,"I heard the achievers will start paying their fair share for the economy they wrecked...As usual Limbaugh presents a question then answers it... Basically, telling his listeners how and what to think...These people are dumber than that monster on Creature from the Black Lagoon...END "

,nuktriggerpuller,2009-08-04T21:04Z,"td24-Not me. I have used the tax code to where I only pay an effective federal tax rate of only 22%. Net worth is high six figures.  Doesn't that just piss you off?  I laugh at people like you who think ""the rich"" are going to pay any more taxes.  The ""rich""  will do what they can to hold on to our assets.  Look at the fall in federal revenues over the last six months.  I'm just a happy American. Please feel free to join me and thank God for America. :-)"
,ItBitTorrent,2009-08-04T21:46Z,"In TD24's world the achievers are the bad guys. While he lingers among the losers of life's lottery, he is a lost cause, beyond reproach. 
I get a perverse pleasure pointing out what an absolute idiot he is. It's like slumming with the low lifes. A 'wallow in the mire' so to speak.
I would never hope to change him as he is the ying to my yang."
,trickdaddy0024,2009-08-05T08:52Z,"""he is the Van Helsing to the liberal Vampires""....u meant the FAT Van Helsing who sits behind a mic and command his zombies to disrupt healthcare meeting...END "
,trickdaddy0024,2009-08-05T08:58Z,"""I laugh at people like you who think ""the rich"" are going to pay any more taxes"", u said...ntp, u think that making six figures means ur rich...How many houses do u have oversea?...How many private jets do u have in ur backyard?...Its funny how people write dumb things....NEWS FLASH...NTP U R NOT RICH...MR. LIMBAUGH IS...Just stating the obvious.END 40-1(40KO'S)"
,trickdaddy0024,2009-08-05T09:05Z,"""I get a perverse pleasure pointing out what an absolute idiot he is"" u said....BSTorrent, in what sentence u prove ur statement?...Did you goto to college?...Or did you barely made it out of High School?...If I hurt ur feeling...I dont give a DAMN...""In TD24's world the achievers are the bad guys"", u also said...ACHIEVERS...u and ntp use that word as if u guys ever needed to...Tell ur parents to send u to college so that u can learn something STUPID...END  41-1(41KO'S)"
,nuktriggerpuller,2009-08-05T14:32Z,"td24-In no way do I think I am rich.  My point was the ""rich"" will not pay as much as you think in taxes.  By the way I didn't say I made six figures.  Learn the difference between net worth and yearly earnings.  I may not be ""rich""  but I lead a rich life."

,trickdaddy0024,2009-08-06T05:12Z,"ntp, i know u r not RICH...But u were the one bragging about six figures the high ones at that...Who cares that u meant net worth which means assets+cash-risk...Wow big difference...But I will not allow u to take back or change what u wrote...If you meant u have a ""rich life"" then say that...Im DONE with this conversation...Next u will be telling me that u r not a Republican...END"
,nuktriggerpuller,2009-08-07T01:40Z,"td24- You just can't stand  that most of us Americans are happy and don't depend on other Americans to subsidize their existence. 
Too bad for you WE are expressing our resistance. "
