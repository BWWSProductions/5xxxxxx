She's challenged along the way by the evil Laverna who wants to usurp the Enchantress, the ruler of Fairytopia. Written by IMDb Editors

The movie believe it or not was actually pretty good for a kids Barbie movie. 
My little sisters got it for Christmas and the movie was pretty good. 
It's not regularly I would watch Barbie movies but i don't mind watching this one occasionally. Me personally am not very in to Barbie but when i have to watch my little sisters i play with them. I'm not normally one for writing comments on movies but i guessed because i just watched it it would be okay to comment on it. 
Fairytopia is a movie that i guess i would take on a car trip considering we have normally one or two days to watch movies. I'm not one for watching little kids movies but i guess if you're stuck in the car for two days with two little toddlers it's okay to watch Barbie movies or little kid movies. When you think about it maybe you should appreciate that not all movies are filled with violence and swearing. Well i guess they still make good movies now a days, not that there are that many. It's not even safe for young children to be flicking through the channels at night. Well i guess that's when it's good to have appropriate movies to watch.
