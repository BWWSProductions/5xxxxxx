[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-08-09T04:31Z,update your directx if that dont work get a new graphics card
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-08-11T23:16Z,"@Katisu
after readin your error again i think you have tried to burn the images to disc and install that way YOU CAN ONLY MOUNT THE IMAGES TO INSTALL DO NOT BURN TO DISC these images are 1:1 clone copies done with alcohol 120% with read errors YOU CANNOT BURN THESE TO DISC"
,liangtkl,2009-08-21T18:09Z,i also face the same problem. i do as you say but it cant either. i didnt burn to disc...
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-08-27T06:48Z,try updating graphics card drivers and direct x
,leithy854,2009-08-29T21:34Z,ive extracted each archive but the images wont mount!!!
,ust2,2009-09-15T06:59Z," Everything mounts and works with this copy.

 Though I don't get what all the hype about this game was. It is far too dark to see and enjoy anything. Even with my game/monitor settings on full brightness I still can't see shit."
,xXGuardianXx,2009-10-12T21:57Z,What do I use to mount these images daemon tools will only work with ISO files.
,-Xxm0nkeyxX-,2009-10-13T05:55Z,"I will seed as much as i can to help out.
Thanks djDEVASTATE2009... i have the expansion for this game.. just needed this to play the expansion. "
,darin_zanyar_92,2009-10-26T15:12Z,"Hi ! :)

The upload and all the seed was good. But one thing that really sucks is when you come to the Mars City, the underground, when the accident starts and then the zombies starts to attack you, the game starts to lagging and then crashes and returns me to the window, I tried several times but nothing happened. Whats' wrong?"
,OjoeO,2009-10-28T16:54Z,"when i mount cd 1, no setup wizard comes up or anything. im using daemon tools. im having the same problem as leithy854."
,smithy125,2010-04-03T09:45Z,"Great upload all works fine, nice job dj"
,ratrave,2010-06-08T07:45Z,pls seed
