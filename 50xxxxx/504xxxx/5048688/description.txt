Benny Hill Complete Collection

Benny Hill is perhaps the greatest comedian that ever lived.

This Torrent Includes:
The entire Thames Television Shows (Seasons 1-6 - 58 episodes)
The released BBC Shows
Ernie Music Video
a few documentaries from A&E
and some cast member interviews.

(the only thing missing is the world tour - everything he did before then is included - I didn't include it because I couldn't get English soundtrack).

I found this torrent on a private Russian site and have remastered the English audio tracks back in.

These are all high quality NTSC videos.

If you hark back to an age before political correctness then this is for you!



Enjoy and Seed!!
