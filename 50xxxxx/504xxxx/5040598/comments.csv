[T],ripthejacker420,2009-08-12T10:43Z,no bro sorry. what's even worse is that i can no longer upload ANYTHING.  my ISP turned off my internet because i exceeded the 10GB bandwidth limit this month. they turned it back on but i cannot exceed the limit again or they will probably turn off my internet for good :( so until another ISP comes to my area im screwed. sorry guys. i am unable to seed anything until further notice
