TO MARKET TO MARKET TO BUY A FAT PIG
2007

If shoppers want to buy really fresh salad greens or perfectly ripe raspberries or a culinary surprise of the best sort, they'll want to find an old-fashioned market -- like a farmers' market or a vintage market house -- with a variety of vendors.   

If viewers want to watch a crunchy, sweet and delicious celebration of such places across the United States, they will want to see TO MARKET TO MARKET TO BUY A FAT PIG, premiering Wednesday, August 1, 2007, 8:00-9:00 p.m. ET on PBS.

From the Lexington Market in Baltimore (which has some of the best crab cakes in the world) to the small but exotic Hilo Farmers' Market on the Big Island of Hawaii (full of fruits and vegetables that aren't always familiar), this tour of a few outstanding markets will delight and amaze. The variety of products and people keep the program as juicy and tender as an August peach in North Carolina.
