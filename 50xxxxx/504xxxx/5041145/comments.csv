,rickcain,2009-08-10T00:14Z,Why did you ZIP it?
,williewonton,2009-08-10T10:32Z,Hasn't seeded in a long time so probably it's dead
,ack0pb,2009-08-19T12:18Z,"People will largely avoid ZIP files, especially when they are posted by *ANONYMOUS* and particularly large."
,Schwein,2009-08-23T18:38Z,"Well I can't believe you have the nerve to get upset by a simple request for screenshots, given the lack of info on the whole upload.
""My thing"". What the fuck is that? Some 7000 jpegs of your dick? Who the fuck is gonna downloaad a 7.42 GiB .rar archive without the slightest idea of what it contains?
So this is your first upload? Please let it be your last one too."
,Schwein,2009-08-23T18:47Z,"OK, the file name ""RITA_PLAYTHING"" probably means it's My plaything Rita Faltoyano. The whole thing still has a shitty description, but like williewonton said this is most likely dead now anyway."
