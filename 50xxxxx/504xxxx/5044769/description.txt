Host:
 George Noory
 
Guests:
 Stanton Friedman, Alex Jones 
 
Ufologist Stanton Friedman spoke from Denver, where he'll be presenting at MUFON's 40th Annual International UFO Symposium this week. His topic at the conference is the 'Pseudoscience of Anti-Ufology.' There are a number of people who masquerade as scientific investigators of the UFO phenomenon, he said, but these debunkers don't actually investigate, nor are they scientific. He detailed the "four basic rules of debunkers:"

â€¢What the public doesn't know, I'm not going to tell. 
â€¢Don't bother me with the facts, my mind is made up. 
â€¢If you can't attack the data, attack the people, it's easier. 
â€¢Do your research by proclamation-- investigation is too much trouble, and nobody will notice the difference anyway.

Among the other speakers at the MUFON conference will be Ted Phillips, on dramatic changes in trace/landing events, and Bruce Maccabee, on his analysis of UFO photos. Friedman noted that wealthy entrepreneur Robert Bigelow is now sponsoring some MUFON investigations and rapid response teams for significant UFO events. 

Friedman recounted his experiences with some of the earliest and most influential ufologists such as J. Allen Hynek and James E. McDonald, and also talked about the Betty & Barney Hill case, as well as the UFO crash at Shag Harbour. He'll be speaking at the Shag Harbour Conference in Nova Scotia on August 15th. During the last hour, callers included an anonymous 727 pilot who saw white circular objects over the Caribbean, and a contactee who shared his 1952 encounter with alien UFO occupants. 

Alex Jones Update

First hour guest, radio host and filmmaker Alex Jones shared updates and commentary on a number of news stories, including a botched building demolition in Turkey, and a privacy-eroding plan to install cameras inside 20,000 homes in Britain, in order to monitor antisocial families.
