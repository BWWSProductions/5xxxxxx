,spuby,2009-08-08T11:29Z,"the aniston movie doesn't have a release date yet people, this movie is not it! this is a western that will be released directly to dvd, and it's barely worth the download (even if the quality of the recording is good). so don't waste time on this. Funny thing is that probably to cut costs on their teaser trailer - http://www.seetrailer.com/2009/08/08/bounty-movie-trailer/ - they used the background music from Lost (i'm pretty sure it's the same)."

V:9

the movie itself contains bad acting and a poor storyline. but again that is my opinion.

keep it up AiTB."
