,JPeterson,2009-11-04T19:45Z,"IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT THIS HL VERSION

This is the old non-steam version of HL. The main game is 1.0.0.9-893 and can be updated to 1.0.1.6-1629 with Blue Shift. I recommend you get a steam version of these games, i.e. 1.1.2.0 or higher from another torrent. It has better resolution support and music is played from mp3 files rather than from the CD."
