,darkfairyyume,2009-08-08T09:59Z,"Hi, I downloaded from this torrent before and I wanted to thank you for taking the time to collect all this awesome awesomeness. I also wanted to let you know that the new stuff you just updated isn't working, it keeps freezing at a certain percentage, so is your files corrupt or is there a certain torrent I should be using. Before your update BitTorrent worked just fine, and I don't understand why it wouldn't now. Please read and reply, thanks again!"

,Aidinthel,2010-04-25T07:12Z,"This collection is great. I downloaded it no problem and all the comics were even in the proper order unlike some others I've seen. Sonic Universe #2 was in Spanish for some reason, but that's my only complaint."
,yet_another_user,2010-05-27T08:56Z,"I don't suppose we could arrange for the availability to increase to unity?

Which is really just a sophisticated way of saying...

SEED PLEASE!"
,cartman19987,2011-04-20T17:55Z,Thanks for this! I'll seed indefinitely.
