Atomic Mail Sender is a flexible newsletter sending program with HTML mass email support and tracking facilities. 

The program is perfect for sending personalized e-mails in bulk as it allows mail merging. The number of email addresses is unlimited. Integrate our bulk emailer with Atomic Email Tracker to control the effectiveness of your email campaigns by monitoring who opens your e-mail, clicks links or loads images in real-time mode. Atomic Mail Sender has its own internal SMTP server and delivers email messages directly to their recipients by passing your ISP mail system. The only requirement is an Internet connection.
