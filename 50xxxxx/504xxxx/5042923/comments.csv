,tunejunki,2009-08-12T22:05Z,I do a lot of word processing and so using the old menus allows me to switch back and forth between computers easily.  There are some items that don't translate well between office xp and 2007. Thanks so much.

,ES_tonian,2009-09-05T10:48Z,microsoft 2007 new ribbons are a piece of shit. Who the fuck came out with such idea? That moron should be fired indefinitely.
,janp0l,2009-11-16T03:00Z,"It works well, i'm using win xp sp3. ignore the error that shows up."
,lamcoun,2009-11-28T10:01Z,"I have microsoft office word 2007 but need a keygen, will this one work for me?"
,crossfire6,2010-01-05T03:56Z,Is it normal to expect a malware warning on the keygen?  A false positive maybe?  I'm getting one but I know that it doesn't necessarily mean that the file is bad.  Can anyone advise?
,suckbox554,2010-09-25T12:15Z,"Norton comes with a keygen result of ""generic trojan horse"". Some keygens are false positives, but unless the software is really necessary and I can verify that other people have run it without bad results. (Or in the VERY least; the uploader has a skull) I usually wont run it, this torrent has since been deleted from my hard drive. I won't usually run non-skulled members A/V flagged torrents EXE's"
