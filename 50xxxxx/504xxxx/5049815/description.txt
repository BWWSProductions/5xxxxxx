Kathleen, a bride to be, and her four bridesmaids Sophia,

Jessica, Beth, and Amber travel to Mexico in hopes of

having a last "hoorah" before the wedding a few weeks

away. After partying hard the night before, Sophia splits

from the group to pursue Rob, a hansom young tourist from

the states. The other girls decide to take a tour of the

countryside without her, but are robbed and left for dead

in a remote rugged terrain. As night falls, the tired and

injured girls arrive at an abandon resort and decide to

take shelter until morning. When they enter, strange

things begin to happen, as the girls become overwhelmed

by an unspoken evil that possesses the resort. Back in

town, Sophia is worried about her friends and works hard

to track them down. After realizing they took a scenic

tour, Sophia and Rob do the same, in hopes of finding her

lost friends. Sophia and Rob finally discover the resort

and attempt to help their friends, but an unspeakable

evil has taken control of all who travel to The Resort.
