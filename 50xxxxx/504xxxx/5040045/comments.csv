,mu57i11,2009-08-18T02:34Z,"I'm glad that so many people have found this torrent. It was in the top 100 audio torrents for around a day, it made warner send mininova a takedown notice and muse fan friends were sending me links to my own torrent.

To answer a few questions:
I'm a guy.
The person who gave this to me was being a bit cagey about where he had got it from; all he would tell me was that he used eac (Exact audio copier) which to me implies that he had a copy on some form of physical media. I was a bit skeptical about this but he gave it to me about a day before it got leaked in nz plus he's given me other stuff before - stuff that implies that he can get new tracks.
I wasn't sure if this was converted to 320 from something better at first, but i've listened to all the other versions carefully and this seems the best qualitty out of them all.

Cheers for all the thanks."
