 Additional notes.....: About time a full DVD of this fine 
			film is released here. If you are not
			from a NORDIC country you can use 
			programs such as DVD Shrink/DVD Decrypter 
			to strip the subs before you burn it 
			to a DVD disc. The reason for this is 
			that you cannot turn off the subs, you have
                        to choose from one of the four Nordic languages,
			when playing in a DVD player, unless you 
			strip them off first. Also menus are in 
			SWE/DAN/NOR/FIN. Enjoy!
