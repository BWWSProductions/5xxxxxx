,hockeyboii91,2009-10-10T15:14Z,i downloaded this but it never asked for the serial. and when i edited it it had a big white log crossing out the pic telling me that it was unregistered
,notenough,2009-12-05T03:49Z,"Serial doesn't work. If you enter in the name and serial number it says that it accepts it but the program doesn't change and still thinks it's unregistered.

All saved files still have a banner across them indicating that it's a shareware version even after registration info has been entered.
