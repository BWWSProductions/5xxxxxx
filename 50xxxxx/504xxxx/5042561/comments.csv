,rogersb88,2009-08-28T05:07Z,25 seeds and i'm only getting 25 k/s come on     oh but thanks for the upload
,3ss0neR,2009-09-04T04:01Z,"WTF?!?  I've been DL at 3kb for the last 6 hours!!!  Wake up people, if you want it you gotta be willing to share it!!!!! Damn!!!"
,ginto,2009-09-05T12:21Z,"Dear fellow pirates: It took me two weeks to get this! So don't complain about 25k/sec or 3k/sec. I'm still seeding 24/7 but my UL speed is slow. Btw, the files don't play on a PS3, no idea why!"
,DorianLun,2009-09-09T03:35Z,"ginto, I'm no expert and I don't  actually own a PS3 yet but I've seen similar issues from friends not only for PS3 but also PS2, Wii, XBOX and XBOX360 with varying media formats.  This is only a guess but it could be that they all have protection in them to keep from playing certain media such as burnt discs or CD copies.  Again, I'm no expert though, so I may be wrong in this.  If you can mod your PS3 this may solve the problem, but I'm not recommending it.

As for me, I came across this by chance and was interested, but I don't have anywhere near the room for full DVD rips, so I'll stick with the Seasons 1-6 in MP4 that I found for now, and get the rest later."
,maolain88,2009-09-26T18:47Z,"No probs for downloading speed..had 250 kbs for a while..so I appreciate that seeders :)

,hio77,2009-11-12T22:09Z,"seed everyone ... iv had this on my box for a week or so now and as pain staken it was to get it downloaded to there i have now seeded it to well over 1TB ... once i get it onto my computer i will probly limit the upload down to something like 2mb/s  .... atm its going at 5.2mb/s purely on this torrent

when i jumped on this on my home connection i also got the 20kb/s average most people get .... now i am sitting on 100-200kb/s most of which is off my seedbox ... 

ill be removing this torrent somewere around 1.5TB to 2TB but even currently i have seeded it back 50.8 times!"
