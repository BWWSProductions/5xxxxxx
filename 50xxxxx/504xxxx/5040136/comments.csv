To ESPURIOUS:  Thanks for this torrent, man.  From where I live, it's so expensive to buy these premium books...I still remember the old times when I just had to content myself with looking at the COVERS of my favorite comic books and forever wonder what could have happened within its pages.  Through these scans you have renewed my faith in the goodness of people.  =)  As tribute to you...I'll seed some of these myself.  Thanks and keep up the good work!!!"
