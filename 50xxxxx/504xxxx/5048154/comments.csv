,balleron24z,2009-08-09T09:22Z,"this torrent is dirty as shit, in terms of ""certain people"" watching the torrent.  pg2 is a good idea folks, and even then, they could be evading that.  so be easy on this one.  also, watch the sample before asking for the a/v quality.  its only 20mb.  my opinion is,  v = 6/10   a = 5/10   video has a tad bit of motion blur, and the contrast ratio could be better, but the video quality is good.  audio is as expected from cam, sounds like its in a box, but its good."
