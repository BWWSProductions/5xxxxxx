There are plenty of wireless security books. This oneâ€™s seriously â€œhands-on.â€ It 
was written by the leaders of one of the worldâ€™s top wireless security auditing 
teams. Penetration testing is crucial to protecting yourself, and this book is 
the source for mastering it. But it doesnâ€™t just show you how to attack 802.11 
networks -- it shows how to detect and defeat those attacks, too.

First, youâ€™ll assemble the arsenal needed to probe wireless network security: 
hardware, drivers, utilities, network mapping and site surveying tools, and so 
forth. The authors offer knowledgeable advice on cards, chipsets, antennas, 
amplifiers, cables, connectors, Linux drivers and wireless extensions, and of 
course software tools. When it comes to the underlying hardware, they go beyond 
conventional PCs and notebooks, also discussing iPAQs and Sharp Zauruses running 
Linux: super-handy for monitoring signal strength and discovering rogue access 
points.

Once you have your toolset, youâ€™ll walk through planning your attack, gaining 
access -- and the awful stuff that can be done once inside. By now, netadmins 
will be plenty motivated to fight back. The authors teach how, in detail. Youâ€™ll 
learn how to make the most of cryptography (not just WEP); provide effective 
user authentication, deploy higher-layer wireless VPNs, even implement a 
wireless IDS system.

We neednâ€™t remind you just how vulnerable many 802.11 networks still are, even 
now. Letâ€™s just say, if you want to do something about it, youâ€™ll find this book 
indispensable. Bill Camarda

for Dummies, Second Edition.
From the Publisher

The definitive guide to penetrating and defending wireless networks.

Straight from the field, this is the definitive guide to hacking wireless 
networks. Authored by world-renowned wireless security auditors, this hands-on, 
practical guide covers everything you need to attack -- or protect -- any 
wireless network.

The authors introduce the 'battlefield,' exposing today's 'wide open' 802.11 
wireless networks and their attackers. One step at a time, you'll master the 
attacker's entire arsenal of hardware and software tools: crucial knowledge for 
crackers and auditors alike. Next, you'll learn systematic countermeasures for 
building hardened wireless 'citadels''including cryptography-based techniques, 
authentication, wireless VPNs, intrusion detection, and more.

Coverage includes:

    * Step-by-step walkthroughs and explanations of typical attacks
    * Building wireless hacking/auditing toolkit: detailed recommendations, 
ranging from discovery tools to chipsets and antennas
    * Wardriving: network mapping and site surveying
    * Potential weaknesses in current and emerging standards, including 802.11i, 
PPTP, and IPSec
    * Implementing strong, multilayered defenses
    * Wireless IDS: why attackers aren't as untraceable as they think
    * Wireless hacking and the law: what's legal, what isn't 

If you're a hacker or security auditor, this book will get you in. If you're a 
netadmin, sysadmin, consultant, or home user, it will keep everyone else out.

WarDriving-or moving around an area to map wireless access points-presents an 
opportunity for those interested in raising awareness of wireless connectivity 
and security vulnerabilities; an opening for those looking to contribute 
connectivity through deliberately opening access; and a security threat to those 
who fail to protect their networks-even though ethical WarDrivers point out that 
they eschew unauthorized network use. WarDriving teaches how to WarDrive, from 
necessary tools to useful software; each chapter ends with a summary, bullet 
points, and FAQ. Later chapters discuss how to attack and how to defend wireless 
networks, making this useful for readers wanting to protect their networks. The 
main focus, however, may find a narrow audience in most libraries; those seeking 
books on securing their network will want to supplement with more thorough 
guides, and those interested in WarDriving may already be conversant with the 
tools and ideas discussed. A supplemental purchase for larger libraries. Wi-Foo 
covers similar ground and discusses similar utilities, yet it goes much deeper 
into the nuts and bolts of both breaking into and defending wireless networks. 
Some more technical sections are balanced out by step-by-step explanations of 
security basics and patterns of attack. Extensive appendixes range from antenna 
irradiation patterns to war-chalking symbols to a penetration testing template. 
Wireless security is an ever-growing issue, which makes this thorough guide 
recommended for larger libraries. Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information.

Uses clear language and is easy to read. ... if you're network admin or security 
professional, this book is almost a must. It's a combo of Exploiting Software 
and Hacking Exposed with specialization on wireless LANs.
