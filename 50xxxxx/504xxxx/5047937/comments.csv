For the conspiracy theorists who watch scifi for pattern recognition and elements of reality in fiction etc, this has some interesting stuff, keep it real though, keep it real, objecfy don't subjectify there are red Herrings if ye don't actually know much metascience, a knowledge of quantum cosmology helps.

Peace. : )"
,DeltaPan,2009-08-14T11:09Z,"**Tip for series downloads.**

To watch the first episodes quickly and complete others 2-3 at a time.

Deselect all episodes except 1+2 and let them complete, when the torrent drops to seed those two, just select further episodes and torrent will jump back out of seed rank back to download and continue, repeat as per sequence of episodes ye want to watch, any bulk files/series torrent has file selection and priority per item which allows full control as to what files one wants first.

Some folks think you have to finish entire download to watch first episode.

Lots of people know this, some don't, good to mention the basics now and then.

Peace. : )"

Uploader knows.
Stay on this for all bar episodes 1x08, 1x13 and 1x24 and download the rest.

Uploader, vads76, has those episodes on seperate torrent here....

Vads mate.

If you fix the torrent inserting the good files for the corrupt preventing extant to complete, into a new create directory and up a fixed torrent.
Us lot on this one, stuck at %98.8 or any stage before that -%30-40 whatever can delete the 3 offending files 1x08, 1x13 and 1x24 for this torrent, copy good files minus *deleted* offending over the new torrents files and cycle a recheck in torrent client and that'll stabilise things with no loss of data and the main torrent will show seeds, from the completers of this torrent when completing the 3 good files added to new torrent.

Link to new one on page a while so people can read this and adjust or jump on fixed version and then delete this version to clean up.

Just saying like, because as is this won't show a seed swarm, doing above with a fixed torrent will do, many may avoid this version.

Peace. : )"
,DeltaPan,2009-08-14T11:46Z,"At the moment guys.

**Those stuck on %98.8 are essentially seeds for the others downloading**, because of the above situation, even though still in download rank showing stuck, the others, myself etc, require you to seed all but the above indicated  episodes data.

Please don't stop uploading at %98.8, the completed data you have is still required until Vas or somebody else does the suggested above so we can switch to another fixed hashcode/torrent with existing data overlay.

Cheers. : )"
,DeltaPan,2009-08-14T11:59Z,"Anybody at %98.8.

If you open torrent in your BT client and deselect episodes 1x08, 1x13 and 1x24, you will drop to seed rank and show as a seed in Azureus and probobly all clients although i don't know all so that's a guess, will do with Azureus/Vuse though."
,DeltaPan,2009-08-14T12:13Z,"Episodes 1x08, 1x13 and 1x24 should be watchable using VLC player http://www.free-codecs.com/download/VideoLAN.htm

There's very little data missing @ -%2 so that player will view and resolve the data loss as dropout.

If one wants to watch them that way and not bother with downloading  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5051839/Code_Name_Eternity_-_Complete_Series  to correct or overlay to any later fixed torrent."
,laero,2009-10-31T17:49Z,someone seed please!!!!!!!!!
,bburwood,2009-11-04T16:41Z,"Like a few commenting on this and the fixed 3 eps torrent, I've been looking for this for a few years as well, since I missed all but the last episode or 2 when it aired here a few years ago.

Thanks for the upload."
