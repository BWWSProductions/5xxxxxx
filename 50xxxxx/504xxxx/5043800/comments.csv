I would not have bought it without first giving it a complete test."

Does anyone have a working one? "
,Biggsis,2009-08-09T01:02Z,"These austrian guys, who brought us this software jewel, deserve every single penny they can get for their excellent work. So people please BUY this software. And NO, i am not affiliated with LS. Just support good software by buying it."

This is not the place for software you pay for. 
For PC's the are a lot of free/freeware software like this. Usually I donate money for software I like. But that should be my decision, also how much I want to donate. 
Hopefully, there will be more freeware for the Mac in the future. 

So I ask again if there is someone with a working serial for this software."
