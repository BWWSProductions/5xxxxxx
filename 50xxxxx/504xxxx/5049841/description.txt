A multi-strand narrative set in early 1980â€™s Los Angeles, centered on an array of characters who represent both the top of the heap (a Hollywood dream merchant, a dissolute rock star, an aging newscaster) and the bottom (a voyeuristic doorman, an amoral ex-con). Connecting the intertwining strands are a group of beautiful, blonde young men and women who sleep all day and party all night, doing drugs â€” and one another â€“with abandon, never realizing that they are dancing on the edge of a volcano.
