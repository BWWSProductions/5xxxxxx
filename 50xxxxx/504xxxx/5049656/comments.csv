,XxReDragonxX,2009-08-12T09:56Z,"hey by the way... i downloaded and works perfect,  today is august 12 2009 and i just update the lastest virus definitions or something like that.... then i start the full scan and the AV-Engine detected this----> App/MediaAS-A in file c:\program files\media access startup\1.5.3.850\hpieaddon.dll , isnt this your SSTR_v1.5A patch?

mail me:  velezjorge_@hotmail.com
"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-08-12T10:55Z,"@XxReDragonxX 

c:\program files\media access startup\1.5.3.850\hpieaddon.dll does NOT belong to the trailresetter.
The trialrestter stores a file at: C:\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\ALL USERS\APPLICATION DATA\WEBROOT\""NAME PC USER + NUMBER"".EXE  (335 kB)

The resetter is to acquire a new trial key, and it can be uninstalled in the meanwhile (also as startup prog)."
,dinosaur07,2009-08-13T04:29Z,"many thanks, i just downloaded the trial from softpedia (this dumbasses from webroot removed the trial from their website :)))) and applied this trial reset.
so far so good...

You can learn the basics through google. As newbie it might take a few years before you're learned that."
,milk1620,2009-08-29T01:33Z,Just wanted to say thanks this is working GREAT! It's the 1st time I've been able to have a decent anti-virus software run on my PC. I also have a question I'm running vista home basic 32 bit... can you point me in the right direction for 64 bit Vista I'd really like to upgrade so I can try some newer programs that can only run with 64bit. TIA. milk

,virusbox,2009-12-21T13:14Z,"not working trial reset
pls give new one"
,JustDownloader,2009-12-23T18:07Z,"Best AntiVirus software I ever had Runs perfectly for about 6 months with the same TrialReset patch. Usually I had to format my PC and reinstall windows 'cuz of Viruses every 6 months, until today I had no problems with viruses and slow downs of my PC. I highly recommend it."
,avenger63,2010-02-16T03:03Z,"Ok. This seems to work - But , Webroot itself says that the SS TrailReset File has virus Mal/Generic-A and Quarantines it"
,Shaftell,2010-02-23T05:45Z,"Just a quick question. What antivirus or Internet security software do you people reccommend? I currently have KIS 2010, but I never know which is the best one. Any suggestions?

,e666,2010-11-02T18:29Z,thanks mate
,fc322,2010-11-11T23:28Z,"Works great and resets the trial to 14 days everytime I reboot the PC  

Ive been able to update definitions 2 days in a row and scan with no problems

I used one of the ""expired keys"" from the readMe  for av + antispyware during setup (with internet cable disconnected) then said ""do not restart"" and applied the trial-reset program.

After that I restarted my PC and was able to update the program and definitions with no trouble at all.  

It works but I dont like the fact that there is no option to ""shutdown PC after virus scan complete"" "
,memphian1,2010-12-25T16:54Z,"RobbingHood,

Not sure if you can help. I had been using the 7.0 version which stopped a few days ago. I removed it, and d/l'd this veriosn. The program installs fine, but when I try to run SSTR_v1.5A.exe, I get a message ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file.You may not have the appropriate permissions  to access the item."" I am running WinXP SP3, and am logged on as administrator. I have also turned off all SpyBot and any other programs before un-rar'ing. I have un-rar'ed everything to my desktop. Any ideas?

Thanks!"
