A Very Potter Musical

This musical spoof of the Harry Potter books was written and performed, including original music, by a group of current and former students a the University of Michigan. It is a completely non-profit endeavor and can be seen freely online at the place where everyone posts video.


I made this DVD image for convenience. Its original source is the flash video ripped from online and reencoded to DVD specifications. There are no special features and no menus.

To use burn to a DVD-R with your favorite program. I recommend IMG Burn for Windows.
