I just ripped it into .avi so I'll be posting that soon. 

The video is of the stage production with no microphones so the music overpowers the voices a bit but if you have a decent equalizer you should be able to bring the voices forward more."

By the way, why is this ripped twice? As soon as the movie is over, it starts all over again - if it was just the actual show once it would only be 2 gigabytes or so. "
,ossprey,2009-08-24T09:42Z,"It's not there twice. Since there's no menus most players will start over from the beginning when it gets to the end.

But, yeah, Joe Walker's Voldemort is really amazing. Him and Draco are my favorite parts."

,ossprey,2009-10-31T21:46Z,"Unfortunately, the audio is not great on the original recording and there isn't a lot that can be done about that. There is a high quality version of the soundtrack available for free at starkidpotter.com."
