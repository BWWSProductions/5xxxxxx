It is censored. Though, very little. Just tiny gray bars. Not too noticeable. Anyways, "have fun"? ;)
 
SUMMARY/DESCRIPTION
This volume contains 2 stories about teacher-student relationships and overcoming the past.

Titles:
1. The Frozen Time : Even though the whole class loves her as a cheerful & honest person, Ken Sakai loathes his teacher Midori Misaki. Much to his bargain she is fixated on getting along with him, even if it means to extort him into having some drinks & a nice talk... Little by little Sakai realizes that there is more to Misaki than meets the eye, as she doesn't seems dandy nor that cheerful when then they are alone.
2. Rooftop Scenery : Mako Uehara is a strange girl, who opens this story by trying to seduce her teacher and by trying to commit suicide in front of him some time later. Will her irresponsible teacher ever get a grasp of what's going on? And will it be before getting fired for un-proper behavior towards his student?
