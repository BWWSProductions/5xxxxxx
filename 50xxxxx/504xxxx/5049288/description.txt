SG-2's Dr. Grant has discovered a previously unknown form of writing and text, in a temple abandoned long ago on Earth. This text was found to be written by beings who lived during the time of the Ancients, the original gate builders. They were a sophisticated race, whose technology was parallel to that of the Ancients.

These two races seemed to have shared technology. However, this unknown race mysteriously vanished before the Ancients left our galaxy and headed for Pegasus. All that remained was this one temple, some cryptic inscriptions on its walls, and The Ninth Symbol. Now, SG-2 are tasked with discovering where this Ninth Symbol resides, what it does, and what its connection to the Stargate is.

However, finding this object, whatever it may be, proves harder then expected. Even after thousands of years of being undisturbed, its going to take a monumental effort to overcome the challenges this mission will produce. What will SG-2 discover? What is the Ninth Symbol?
