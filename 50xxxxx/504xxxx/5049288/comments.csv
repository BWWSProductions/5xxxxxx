,RickyTheFish,2009-08-21T14:30Z,"Decent enough to watch, but the acting was pretty bad, and the picture quality suffered at times (crappy cameras, I assume), and some effects were rather shoddy (such as the green screen). There are many, many plot holes, but I guess overall it's not terrible for a fan movie. Certain facts were also incorrect, such as the SG-2 team placing C4 charges and referring to them as ""claymores"" and ""land mines."""
,pcdiver,2009-10-11T13:45Z,"Good quality  but as far as the film goes it is total crap!  I watched about 10 minutes and that was enough.  I'll stick to the genuine Stargate, because this really is rubbish as far as acting goes."
