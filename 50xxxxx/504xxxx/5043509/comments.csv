[T],gamerguuy,2009-08-07T10:54Z,sorry but there are no pirated games for ps3 and even if there were the ps3 wouldn't play them.There are some sites which are having ps3 games on torrents but i think they won't work.There are some ps3 games on this website too like this one:http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3893432/Call.of.Duty.4.Modern.Warfare.USA.PS3-PARADOX.so check it out.

,mosley187,2009-09-29T19:11Z,"Hello,

1st thanks for the upload.

Wonder if anyone can tell me how to install this to my (PS2-HDloader) HD, does it need a SLUS? and if so does anyone have this info?

I use Hdl-dumb in combination with HDloader 8.0 to instal my games normaly to my HD.

Many thanks in advance!

Mosley. "
