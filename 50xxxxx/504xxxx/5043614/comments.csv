,monoape,2009-09-07T09:46Z,All tracks on CD2 are corrupt - they won't play in J.River Media Center or VLC.
,canco,2009-09-14T18:00Z,i downloaded this torrent and both CDs worked fine in Winamp and Windows Media Player. The problem is caused by your player or audio codec.
,monoape,2009-10-19T20:59Z,"I have ~1800 albums, about 40% FLAC. The only files that don't play are those on the second album of this download - I've tried it in VLC, J.River Media Center and Windows Media Player (Windows 7). None of them work.

It's not *my* CODECS - there's something wrong with this rip. Maybe something to do with using something called 'Easy CD-DA Extractor' to rip.

I solved the problem by using Winamp to convert the files to 'FLAC' again."
