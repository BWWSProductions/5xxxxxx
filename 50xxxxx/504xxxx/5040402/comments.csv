,big_raji,2010-04-28T00:25Z,"seeding this now. Video and Audio are ok for a DVDRip. I expected the V/A quality of a 1.37GB movie to be better, until I saw that the movie was almost 3 hours long. Yikes.

If you've seen the original Firestarter movie and liked it, you will absolutely hate this movie with a passion. If you haven't seen the original Firestarter movie, you still won't like this movie very much.
