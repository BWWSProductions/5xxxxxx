Larry B. Max is an unusual specialist from a little-known branch of the I.R.S. (Internal Revenue Service), the all-powerful tax-collecting agency of the United States, which has every technological method at his disposal to link high finance and high crime.

Max unravels the financial and logistical organisations which supports a huge drugs operation between Mexico and the US. In the process, though, the lines between legality and providing jobs for thousands of people, between prosperity and morals become blurred.
