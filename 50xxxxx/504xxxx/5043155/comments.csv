Are you experiencing ringworm of the scrotum/balls? Are you frustrated that you don't have the option of having sex? 
I am about to tell you how I got rid of ringworm of the balls/scrotum! One word...
Garlic.
Garlic works very similiarly to liquid nitrogen in that it burns like a motherfucker!
Garlic is actually known to burn human flesh if it's kept on long enough. Check out this medical article. 
Materials
- 1 garlic bulb (which is plenty)
- 1 plate
- 1 cooking tool that can be used to crush garlic
- 1 knife
- 1 chair of some sort (i used a toilet seat)
- 1 garbage can

Procedure
steps:
1) cut the bulb of garlic at the top and bottom end with your knife and remove the essential cloves of the bulb with your hands (and throw away any skin)
2) place the selected garlic cloves on the plate
3) crush as many cloves as you like with your cooking tool depending on how much of your scrotum skin are infected by ringworm. (i used 3-5 cloves)
4) position the garbage can infront of your chair
5) grab a piece of crushed garlic and place it onto the affected area of your scrotum. Keep it there until it's burning like hell! try to keep it there as long as possible (I read on another website that a woman used it on her daughter for 10 minutes, which is unbelievable... While I applied it for 1-2 minutes, I would hop around the bathroom with this face --> -_- )
6) Throw the used piece of crushed garlic in the garbage below you, normally i'm in so much pain that i'm flicking the crushed garlic off my balls so it immediately falls into the garbage can (no mess. yay!). 
7) At this point you'll feel an extreme burning pain, the best thing to do is focus your attention elsewhere. What I did was handstand push ups against my bathroom door, thought of dance combinations, Standing on tables in front of the bathroom window with my balls facing my neighbors. Essentially anything to get your mind off the pain. 

Recommendations 
Keep your balls cool, dry and in the light. The ringworm fungi thrive in a dark, warm and moist environment. They also thrive skin flaps of your scrotum. So I bought a fan and kept it under my computer facing my balls, to keep them cool and dry (this helps ruin the multiplying environment for the fungi). As for keeping your balls in the light, I suppose you could quit wearing pants (e.g. I kept my room door locked, and slept without pants everynight). 
Keep your immune system strong. Eat wise and exercise to help your immune system fight the nasty ringworm. Definitely doesn't hurt to eat healthy. I started eating yogurt which has powerful bacteria inside it, which help fight off other harmful bacteria. Get ample sleep! Also keep a positive attitude. Stress lowers the immune system anyways, and it will not help you in your goal to get rid of the ringworm. 
Masturbate. As you should already know, having sex with anyone is out of the question because ringworm is highly contagious. But you can?t infect anyone else if you're just masturbating! Masturbation is great because it is also a healthy habit. It reduces the risk of prostate cancer. See this article by Dr Weil. 
Be patient. It will leave with some effort and x period of time. Lastly, I'd like to say that don't worry about how many times a day you apply the garlic. You should use the garlic crushed pieces when you feel you are ready. I did it whenever I felt the ringworm subsided, and when I needed to get rid of more of it that was left over. 

peace. "
