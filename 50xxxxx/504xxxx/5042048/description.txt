TCM Underground hosted by Rob Zombie
Film conversations featured on Turner Classic Movies' T.C.M. Underground.

These are the Rob Zombie intros to TCM Underground. The films themselves aren't included. Some episodes include two films and some include one, so I've separated each by film. Only the intros are included (with two exceptions). The actual show has outros for each film as well, which usually explain why the film didn't succeed commercially. 

If you have the missing files, please upload them! There's no DVD release for this stuff, and now that Rob Zombie's no longer the host it will probably disappear forever.

If you're a fan of this stuff, you might also want to check out the podcast Double Feature -
