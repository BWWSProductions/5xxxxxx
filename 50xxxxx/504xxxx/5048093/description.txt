Hampton Hawes' amazing string of trio albums recorded between June 1955 and Jan. 1956 superbly accompanied by Red Mitchell on bass and Chuck Thompson on drums.This is another great recording by Hampton Hawes whose Bud Powell-influenced piano is in fine form. I think anyone interested in Hawes should try and pickup everything he's done. You won't be sorry, because the music swings and that's what matters. He is also quite good on ballads, which shows a completely different side of any musician. Hawes is joined by his then usual trio of Red Mitchell and Chuck Thompson. Another stellar release from Hampton. ~ J. Rich

Oh, yeah, baby. This is some serious 50s groovin'. A really beautiful trio featuring nimble piano, brushy drums, and bass solidly in place.  to it over and over until your head explodes. ~ A Customer, Amazon.com
