,pizzabandit,2009-08-17T16:45Z,"Thanks again reaper!  Another great upload.  Worked perfectly for me . . . I'm running Vista HP 64bit and installed and patched to registered version without any problem whatsoever.  
Tried a couple different versions and so far this one was the first to work for me without any problems.

Still having a bit of trouble making problem free images of a particular CD, but thats an issue with SecuRom and not this torrent."
