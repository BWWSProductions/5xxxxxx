,Sarkasmi,2009-08-12T15:28Z,"Mooshi4686, you can burn a demo to pretty much any disk you want.. even a CD, if it fits. (This one obviously doesn't).. I used one of my ""Crappy DVD's"" that I'm not using since they suck. But it worked fine. And I'm not an xbox live gold member and the demo is for gold members only right now.

So yeah.. I, for one, was very happy about the demo being shared here :)"
,Muhit,2009-08-12T17:37Z,"just use a dvd re writable, it works fine, when your bored erase the dvd"
,Sarkasmi,2009-08-12T20:26Z,"God I hope the full release leaks quick. The demo is AWESOME. 

A lil tip; In the last room, where you can have ALL THE FUN(if you're like me, you find yourself restarting the checkpoint everytime you kill the last one in the room)

After opening the vent/hatch thing, go out of it, before killing anyone, go back in the vent. Far enough to change the place of the name (it displays it on the screen) and then go back. When you restart the checkpoint, the hatch is open, sparing you the time to always having to open it :) 

Realized it by accident.


Hell, I'm running out of fun things to do... 
But the most fun things must've been killing another guy by dropping a previously hung criminal on him. And making a loudy kill and then trying to pick most of em while they're running to check the noise... Starting with 5, killing one through the glass roof, then picking up 2 before they even get there was my ""record"" :D

Any fun tips? Haven't found any secrets whatsoever :P "
