Hello, hope everyone's doing ok. 

Just found out the good ol' Microshit (Soft) decided to go and change the RTM build number. What other surprises are in store?? 

After digging around on the internet I found the stand alone installers for the updates that change Win 7's build to:

BuildLab 7600.win7gdr.090722-1835
BuildLabEx 7600.16399.x86.fre.win7_gdr.090722-1835 (came straight out my registry)

These updates are for the the 32bit and 64bit versions of Windows 7. I assume all models are fine. I.E Home Premium, Enterprise, Ultimate.

If your here, then you probably did as I have, and grabbed the first available RTM version to hit the torrent scene. I don't think MS planned on such diligent software pirates to hack there golden egg this soon. So there doing what MS alwasy does, patch, patch and more patching. For me windows update seems to work, but it did not offer THESE updates, even when I told it to check for updates.

As for activation, it seems to have had no effect on the SLIC or the Startup Loader that I used to activate the version I have. I used 2 activation methods which I have kindly included with this upload.

For comparative purposes, I'm running the 32 bit Ultimate version. I Love It! 

Won't really know until next year how all this activate this and update that will go. Come March 10, 2010 though I may be downgrading (probably not, someones always going to crack it) if MS finds a way to keep poor folks like me from using there software for free.
