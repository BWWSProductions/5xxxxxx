From SÃ£o Paulo city, the group was formed in 2003 by the desire and experience of friends whom aimed to work out their musical influences through the composition of instrumental music. Inspired by feature movie scores, lounge music sound and experimental music bands & sounds, the compositions look in to create textures and images based vibes: as in a sound track, but casting the listener to come up with the picture and scenario on his own mind. The music harmony as constructed by the band give priority to the several emotions that rise as the songs flows through an idealistic and interpretative labyrinth. Plural instrumental sound like and diversity of images and unity as concept. In 2007, Labirinto won the top instrumental music award, at SESC PompÃ©ia's PIB festival, in SÃ£o Paulo City, Brazil. Labirinto took part on shot cut movies and other videos shot by independent film makers. Also released three EP's, and prepares the CD named Anatema to be out in 2009.
