I'm trusted, and I think VIP's and higher don't need capctha"
,opelkoenjas,2009-08-10T13:03Z,Any news if this rip is working? Is it single player? Do you need Steam? All that sort of stuff. Kinda weird that there are allready 128 seeders but only 2 comments here on PB.
,jadotben,2009-08-10T14:10Z,"Working 100% on vista 32.
@ opelkoenjas :
Single player.
No need for Steam to run it.
Crack included.

Thank you Groo_The_Wanderer"
[T],gamerguuy,2009-08-12T09:27Z,hi Groo_The_Wanderer can you do something about this captcha thing cuz we all want to upload torrent but can't see the code.

,bwmood,2012-01-19T22:18Z,"Thank you for this upload!
I downloaded and installed it; it works perfectly except for the images: they all look weird, shades of greys, blues, red, absolutely not normal. I'm running Windows 7 64bits and my graphic card is an ATI Radeon HD 4650.
For information, I've got the first game on dvd when I try to launch it after installation I get an error message saying more or less ""can't find graphics something"". Months back this game was working perfectly.
Anyone has an idea what's going on there?
Thank you."
