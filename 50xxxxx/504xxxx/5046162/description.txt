The Salon stars Vivica A. Fox (Jenny) as the inheritor of a neighborhood beauty salon.
 Jenny is being forced to sell her shop to the Department of Water and Power (DWP)
 due to eminent domain. She has not told the other tenants in the salon and is trying to 
  build a case to save the shop.
 The DWP is represented by a hot shot attorney (Darrin Dewitt Henson) who takes a 
 liking to her and a romance begins. This is a fresh look on the inside of a salon where
 anything can happen.
