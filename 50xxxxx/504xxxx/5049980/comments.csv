V - 9

Good download, except for the fact that quite a few scenes seem to be cut out, so occasionally I'd be lost as to what has happened. E5 audio is particularly quiet too, for some reason. Overall, however, a great download. Thanks."
,jrunke,2010-09-21T00:33Z,"Dont get me wrong thanks a bundle for uploading, but why would you cut out scenes?

P.S. - 41% after 3d 1h.  Please seed moar!"
,adrifter,2010-09-22T03:26Z,"seriously, why are there scenes missing? I've tried two other versions of this torrent and they both have the same awkward transitions between certain scenes that give the distinct impression of something cut out, but I dunno whether it's actual parts of the episodes (as some of the comments insist) or just someone's very poor job of cutting out the commercials. What gives?

For an example, the elevator scene towards the end of the first episode. It seems so random and ends so abruptly I feel like that can't be the actual end of that scene. There is a similar case in episode two.

Where can I get unedited episodes?"

,Dirkastanian,2010-10-14T03:58Z,Thanks for the upload!
,Nikokvaj,2011-01-30T04:00Z,"Notice how the cut-out parts always appear at the beginning and end of a scene? 

This is because they are poorly edited commercial breaks. 

Nothing to worry about ;)"
