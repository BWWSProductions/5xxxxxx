Genre: Comedy

"Craptastic" is a sketch-comedy film unlike any other. Presented in a "stream of consciousness" manner, characters proceed from one sketch to another, following a single thread that flows between them. With the use of strange, bizarre and hysterical situations, our cast follows a cohesive mindset that will leave you most surprised in the end.
