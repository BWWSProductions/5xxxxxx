,NilsNL,2009-08-18T20:51Z,"Thanks. Really curious about S01E13, 'Epitaph One'."
,sunshinestate,2009-08-28T18:50Z,why the fuck would you put episode 3 hdtv rip instead of a dvdrip like every other episode in here? 
,cyber857,2009-09-01T21:03Z,That episode was corrupt in the original batch. As I did not rip these I simply provided a working copy of that episode so that the first season was complete. You are welcome to look for the dvd rip of that episode at the time I compiled this torrent it was not available. 
,leyla316,2009-09-30T09:43Z,Seed Please!!
,laparapa,2009-11-04T03:03Z,Is there a huge difference between the HDTV rip and the DVD rip?
,hayden1,2009-12-23T03:30Z,"The HDTV rip will have the TV 14 thing in the corner (or whatever it actually is) and possibly the network logo in the other corner. All TV rips also have an increased tendency for out-of-sync audio because editing out the commercials messes up the sync between the A/V. However, my download's not done yet and I have no idea if this particular TV rip suffers from the same problem."

,fossil44,2011-03-12T02:47Z,thanks for the up cyber857  a/v 10 outa 10 keep up the great work cheers
,Xeginy,2011-09-08T18:30Z,"Good download. Some of the episodes were spotty (froze for a few seconds, etc) but nothing that made them unwatchable. Played in WMP. Thanks a lot!"
,Pagasai,2012-05-10T06:16Z,"For the most part quite a good upload thanks.

HOWEVER, there are major problems with episode 07. The episode suffers from a vast amount of lag in both video and audio. The beginning audio .300s delayed, and then later becomes .700s.
- Happens on multiple video players (VLC, Windows, Quicktime)
- Happens on multiple computers with a different download of the torrent."

,ScottyD7421,2012-07-20T11:28Z,"Only up to episode 5 and so far very good quality so props to cyber857 for uploading.

One thing i would say is about the unaired pilot; my suggestion would be to treat this episode as a stand-alone just to see what is was like and watch after you have finished watching the whole season. Whilst Whedon did take parts of this episode and put them into the first 3 episodes (to date) they are not neccessarily how they were in the pilot i.e. he changed things around so some might find this confusing. Hope that makes sense :-0

Cheers again cyber857"
