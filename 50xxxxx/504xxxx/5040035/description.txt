This is the first season of Dollhouse.

Several things to note episode 3 is a HDTV rip, not DVD. The un-aired pilot was cannibalized by Whedon during the season so images and scenes from that episode make it into other episodes.

Episode 13 was not aired by fox due to some confusion and contract issues, you can google this for more info.

I did not rip this, only repackaged them into a working full torrent. Enjoy.
