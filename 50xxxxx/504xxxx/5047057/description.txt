Hey all,

Here is a little compilation I made for Wipeout HD and called it "Hyperspeed". Of course it is somewhat my own personal taste going on here, but I thought I'd share it with you anyway. I hope you like it so I didn't created the cover / folder image for nothing ;-)
 
Tracklist:
01 - Infernal Droid - Outlander
02 - Astrix vs. Melicia - Dancing Up
03 - Hiroyuki Oda - Transmigration
04 - Roni Size - Snapshot
05 - Boosta - Dance is Dead (Tocadisco Mix)
06 - Chemical Brothers - Under The Influence
07 - Leftfield - Phat Planet
08 - The Crystal Method - Comin' Back
09 - Sean Tyas - Candida

Enjoy.
