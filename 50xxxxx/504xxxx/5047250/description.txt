  From Recorded Books:

  With over 65 million copies in print, the immensely popular Left BehindÂ¨ series by best-selling authors Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins continues to fascinate and inspire new readers. Desecration: Antichrist Takes the Throne is the highly anticipated continuation of this powerful saga. Twenty-five days into the Great Tribulation, the horror and suffering in the world is intensifying. The Antichrist Nicolae Carpathia--now the complete embodiment of evil--is preparing to desecrate the holy temple in Jerusalem by entering and declaring himself god. But the Tribulation Force of believers has more than a few tricks up their collective sleeve--if only they can continue to operate without being detected by Carpathiaâ€™s sadistic military forces. Skillfully mixing Biblical prophecy and current events, LaHaye and Jenkins pack their story full of action and adventure. Narrator Frank Mullerâ€™s legendary voice heightens the growing tension of the End Times on planet Earth.


  From Wiki:

  Based on dispensationalist interpretation of prophecies in the Biblical books of Revelation, Isaiah and Ezekiel, Left Behind tells the story of the end times, in which many have been "raptured," leaving the world shattered and chaotic. As people scramble for answers, a Romanian politician named Nicolae Jetty Carpathia rises to become secretary-general of the United Nations, promising to restore peace and stability to all nations. What most of the world does not realize is that Carpathia is actually the Antichrist foretold from the Bible. Coming to grips with the truth and becoming born-again Christians, Rayford Steele, his daughter Chloe, their pastor Bruce Barnes, and young journalist Cameron "Buck" Williams begin their quest as the Tribulation Force to help save the lost and prepare for the coming Tribulation, in which God will rain down judgment on the world for seven years.
