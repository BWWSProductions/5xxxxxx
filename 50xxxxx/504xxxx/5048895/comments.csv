Made them self rich on other people misery.Today in america any idiot can made a fortune with a single song, not fair, in other countries you can be as good as Rolling Stones and play for 30 years, and still in all that time you can not make tiny part of the money let's say Britney fucking Spears made by one fucking single.
I say, let the musicians earn most of thair money on concerts and live performing, selling rights to play their music to tv stations,radio stations,restaurants etc...
Anyway, I say this, music,movies,games, should be free for private and personal use after certain period of time after industry and creators has made a bulk of the profits, lets say 6 months to a year.
Music,games,movies and like, are not like cars, houses, or other material things for which you must use raw materials that are not in limitless supply, and therefore you can not make them free after period of time.But copyrights on intellectual property should be made void after the certain period of time.At least for private people.
For example, if pharmaceutical firm invented some drug, they can have exclusive rights on selling and making only for couple of years, after that, everybody else can make their version of the drug, of course that version all being the same thing even if named differently, so why would entertainment industry be any different."

,iTPB,2009-08-14T00:29Z,"FUCK OFF RIAA

We share asking nothing in return. We make sure people who can't afford things can have entertainment to. We buy things when we are able, and we support those worth supporting. 

I REALLY think the government in ALL countries and the RIAA should REALLY consider what they are doing. There are millions of people who whole heartedly believe in file sharing. Putting innocent people behind bars and trying to get money from people who have none to start with is going to cause one helluva revolution. 

Look how many people came to the aid of one SINGLE person like Kevin Mitnick for being thrown in jail. When you try to take the entertainment from millions... picture that. I for sure stand tall head held high and will be one of the people who are willing to take you guys on. I have nothing for you to take but I damn well will stand up for everyone. Feel free to fine me or toss me in jail I'll go proudly head held high. What we do is NOT stealing. Sharing asking nothing in return is innocent and kind. Charging people 20+ dollars for a disc of plastic that someone is going to watch once is criminal. Not even to bring up the fact that a LOT of us if we've downloaded something and like it save to buy it for the ridiculous sum you ask. 

RIAA claims billions of dollars loss with digital entertainment. Wanna know why I don't believe a fucking thing you say? EVER SEEN MTV CRIBS? Our musical artists and actors still have 10+ cars and 3 pools and movie theaters in their homes. Don't tell me shit about how we are thieves hurting people. "

,soggyorigami,2009-08-14T00:50Z,"What I find funny is when the RIAA cries about loosing billions, when the people who download the songs would most likely have never bought the CDs in the first place. There's absolutely no money lost.  The figures are based solely on a theory that they could have made that much more money if the people had actually purchased the CDs. Not to mention that most of the people who pirate (In America at least) are from the poor blue collar working class. People who can't afford to spend money frivolously on things past bills and necessities. If you can broadcast a song on a free for the public medium like radio, then those people should be allowed to record and own it for themselves."

RIAA has management, but also has secretaries to maintain and others.

Those children eventually become teens and get all stupid about what is ""their music"".

,Candy_Man,2009-08-14T03:27Z,"I'm not gunna download this because I have all the good songs. But if you think about it he should sue the RIAA back for a cruel and unusual punishment. You could buy all the songs below for 99 cents but instead they are going to charge him over 20,000 dollars each. 
If I stole a pack of gum from my local 7-11 I wouldn't be fined over 20 grand. I'd probably  have to pay them back for around a dollar and maybe get a stern talking too. 
Doesn't that make sense you learn your lesson you have to pay for your crimes. Do they really think Joel will ever be able to pay over half a million dollars if he makes 50'000 a year. That's a pretty good job. And if he lives in the cheapest of houses and spends almost no money he'll probably be able to pay 25,000 a year. That is extremely low living standards. At that rate it would take him 26 years to pay it all back. thats until he's in his late 40's. Everyone of the artists live rich lives and the RIAA are being assholes and think that charging this guy 675000 dollars will fix anything. They need to realize that they will never stop piracy. I think the best way to slow it would be to charge people like 2 dollars a song because it's reasonable and it's not a life ruiner. What about the mom who was ordered to pay like 1.5 million dollars. I can tell you right now that she will never pay that back and her kids lives will not be good. She might even have to give them up. Talk about life ruining. Even if many people were losing job's at the RIAA because of piracy( They don't) I still wouldn't care. The people who lose their jobs would have a tough spot in life. The people they help prosecute have their lives ruined. So all in all the RIAA is a bunch of selfish assholes. I'm not hurting an artist by downloading their songs because I never would have bought them in the first place.

Ask yourself: from all the musics you ever downloaded, are there 30 pieces that suck big time? For me, there are much more than 30. You know the routine: you search for your favorite one, you find it in a ""Best 1000 songs of something"" torrent, you DL the whole and then you realize 995 out of it are just bad. 

My best bet that Joel downloaded and shared many other songs, only the RIAA wasn't interested in those...

Hell, I'm the uploader of this torrent and even I didn't listen any of the tracks. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter what kind of songs are they, now does it?

I don't really like the posies, but i heard this interview on npr recently and one of the bandmembers was talking about this, and how he and th band are in debt alnmost 2 decades later, paying for these record labels bills (recording expenses, hotels, food, ad nauseum).  and so many other similar stories.  so the artists are in debt for becoming mega stars, while rotten crotch record label execs and the infected absessed anal glands known as the riaa profit endlessly.

[T],vexfoo,2009-08-15T05:06Z,"By the way, if this torrent grows into the 10,000+ seeders and growing (and perhaps orders of magnitude beyond that are possible too) then it could take on a cult following. In that sense the songs would take on new meaning, and be rediscovered, even if they're considered junk (poor taste) now.

For example, the demo scene could tear apart and reconstruct each track down to their constitute elements. Or think about the well known drum and bass loop that is used in so much music. That can be torn down again, more intricately than say a cthugha type audio visualization because each beat or sound would be synthesized from scratch.

Just tossing some ideas out there. I know it's a lot of work. I also suggest it because at that point it would truly be a derivative work and I don't think the original authors deserve anything at that point, aside from a reference or acknowledgment. Not sure how you would word that in actual legalese, maybe someone could correct me.

It may seem pretty bad that Joel is the one who is asked to cough up that amount. But look where you put the blame! I would have cursed the lawyers and and the faulty loopholes in the system rather than RIAA.

RIAA (or whatever it is) is there to ensure that artists (and their sponsors) get paid genuinely for their talent and resources. It is us hackers (sick) who are asking for a free ride and are therefore responsible for the pitiable lifestyles of the artists. The sponsors and distributors are already too scared of us (pirates). This is just their retaliation by holding one of us accountable.

If you want a free ride, go have it, but don't blame the ticket collector. He is just there to ensure that those 
- who are selling their talent are not denied justice
- who have bought the tickets are getting their moneys worth."

""We are grateful for the jury?s service and their recognition of the impact of illegal downloading on the music community,"" the RIAA said in a statement. ""We appreciate that Mr. Tenenbaum finally acknowledged that artists and music companies deserve to be paid for their work. From the beginning that?s what this case has been about. We only wish he had done so sooner rather than lie about his illegal behavior.""

This quote makes me want to buy a gun...

Last December, the labels announced that they were no longer initiating new cases against individual peer-to-peer users. However, they said they would see through to the end those cases already in the litigation pipeline. According to the labels? attorneys, there remain about 100 cases pending where the defendant has filed an answer, about a dozen of which are being actively litigated in the discovery stage."
