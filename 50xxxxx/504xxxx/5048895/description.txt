I too downloaded them!

These are the tracks Joel Tenenbaum downloaded. For 30 tracks he is ordered by the court to pay $675,000 to the RIAA. 
Well, all I can say: the RIAA can come and try to get half a million bucks from me too, let's see if they can make me pay...
Btw, it's amazing how easy to become rich, ain't it? You just download this pack two times and you already have something that worths more than a million...

Don't forget to seed, let everybody know: "I too downloaded them!" :+)

UPDATE 01: 
Facebook doesn't let you share a ThePirateBay link, but it let's you share a shortlink. So use this checked (virusfree, spamfree) link to let your friends now about it:

UPDATE 02:
Currently more than 900 of us are seeding. If one seed means $675k, the whole bunch must worth around $600.000.000 
Man, in a few days we gonna become one of the most wealthy group on the planet. 
But c'mon, there ain't no such thing as free lunch, you should work for your money. The PirateBay guys already done what they could, now it's your turn. Downloading and seeding is a good start, but don't you even think about stopping there. Share the short link (see above) via Facebook, mail, blogs, tell your friends... Alone we are nothing, together we can make this one of the most popular torrents and show the RIAA why not to attack any of us! So happy seeding, let's go for thousands and ten-thousands! :-)
