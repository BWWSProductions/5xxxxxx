De mythische stad Camelot, in een tijd voor de geschiedenis begon. Een fantastisch rijk van legendarische schepsels en mysterieuze volkeren. Een gevaarlijke wereld waaruit de genadeloze tiran Uther Pendragon elke vorm van magie heeft verboden. 

Wanneer Merlin, een jongeman met magische krachten, in het koninkrijk aankomt, maakt hij meteen heel wat vijanden. Dankzij zijn mentor Gaius, de wijze lijfarts van Uther, ontdekt Merlijn zijn talenten om de mystieke geheimen van Camelot te ontsluieren en daarmee te overleven. Zo ontdekt hij dat zijn lotsbestemming en die van Arthur, de volgende vorst van het koninkrijk, onlosmakelijk met elkaar verbonden zijn.

Set in the mythical city of Camelot, in a time before history began, this magical adaptation of the Arthurian legend follows Merlinâ€™s early adventures in the court of King Uther... and his enthralling encounters with the young Prince Arthurâ€¦ 

The Kingdom of Camelot is a realm of legendary beasts and mysterious peoples. In this dangerous world, magic has been banned by the ruthless tyrant, Uther Pendragon. Merlin, a young man gifted with extraordinary powers, arrives at the gates of the city. Though bright-eyed with wonder, the young sorcerer quickly makes enemies, including the headstrong Prince Arthur. 

Guided by Gaius, the wise court physician, Merlin is soon using his talents to secretly defend the Kingdom and unlock Camelot's mystical secrets. Soon he discovers that his destiny and that of Arthur, the future King, are inextricably linked. Starring Colin Morgan, Bradley James, Anthony Head, Richard Wilson, Katie McGrath and Angel Coulby
