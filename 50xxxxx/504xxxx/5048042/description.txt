NOTE: The only thing I've done is convert these files to mp3 format (320 KB, 44100 KZ, Stereo), so the quality varies based on the recording's source. If you like these recordings, or live music in general, I encourage you to seek out the uncompressed (.flac & .shin) concerts these are from and go see these bands when they come to your neighborhood.
