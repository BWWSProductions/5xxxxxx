"I believe you should try to make music as beatiful as you can. 
It should not be done with ugliness.
There's so much hate in the world;you have to interact it with loveliness."
Stan Getz

This Album is recorded from two of his performances in CafÃ© Montmarte in Copenhagen. 

On july 6th 1987 Stan Gets held a concert in Cafe Montmarte to celebrate his sixtieth birthday.
"I thought that those concerts could be my last ones, and that gave me the feeling of 'Now I really have to try my best'. In my fantasy, I was singin my musical swan song."

The improvisations in this concert are really amazing and moving. 

In march 1991, after combating illness for many years, he came back to say goodbye. This time he tries even harder. Knowing that he wont come back, he gives his best performances ever - and performs some of the songs like no one have ever done before and nobody will ever do again.
