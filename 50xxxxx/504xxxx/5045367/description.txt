PLEASE SEED!
The Manhattan Transfer, one of the worldâ€™s finest vocal-groups in my opinion. Here are albums with their second line-up; Tim Hauser, Alan Paul, Janis Siegel, and Cheryl Bentyne.
This is not a complete discography. If someone wants to help and share whatÂ´s missing IÂ´m sure weÂ´re many that would appreciate that.

The albums are: Extensions, Mecca For Moderns, Bop Doo â€“ Wopp, Vocalese, Brazil, Live (At Nakano Sun Plaza Hall, Tokyo), The Christmas Album, ToninÂ´ Boy from New York City and other Hits, Swing, CouldnÂ´t Be Hotter, Vibrate, The Symphony Sessions
