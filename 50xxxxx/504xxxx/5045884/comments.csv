I found GB a few years ago in the swamps of florida, and then in my travels, found out I was more Texan than Canadian. In fact, I never was a Canadian. Even less so now!

Listen to his radio over Internet EVERY day! Post those shows to the other guy!!

This is important stuff!

Can't get this on my cable channel. (Surprise...)

Again. Many thanks.

Prepare for the future.
