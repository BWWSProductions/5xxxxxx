The FREE OpenCPN software works well with these charts.
Can't get it to work with Maxsea yet???"
,blubikbeneenvis,2009-12-04T14:43Z,"Does this one work with Raymarine E120(W) ?

On http://www.c-map.com/Content/files/C-Map%20compatible%20chart%20plotters.pdf , there I can see that C-MAP 4D is compatible with E120(W) plotter.

CM93 == CMAP 4D ??"

,ScumSoft,2010-03-08T22:23Z,"Works like a charm with OpenCPN. 
just install OpenCPN,  then copy those maps you wanna use to some katalog on your disk, open Toolbox (within OpenCPN) and choose Charts, then point to the catalog where you have copied your maps.. there you go.."
,livetorrents,2010-05-02T21:00Z,Thanks. Anyone have english symbol explaination?
,insomni,2010-06-16T21:50Z,Great collection - any idea how I can install these in Deckman? Is that the same issue as Maxsea?
,pisvejc,2010-09-01T00:02Z,Great map of world that works with Maxsea v10. Just mount with daemon tools and click File/Open chart. After a while of search you should see the drive letter pointing to the map. Any one with working 3d maps and Maxsea v12 ???
