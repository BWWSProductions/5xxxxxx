The Twilight Zone - Complete Franchise

------------------------
File naming:

[Air/Sequence Date*: YYYY-MM-DD] - [SERIES ABBREVIATION or MOVIE #] [SEASON#] [EPISODE#] [SEGMENT] - [Name]

------------------------
Abbreviations:

TOS - The Original Series (1958-1964)
MOV - Movie (includes TV movies)
RV1 - Revival 1 (1985-1989)
RV2 - Revival 2 (2002-2003)

(and the usuals):

Sxx - Season #
Exx - Episode # (followed by segment letter if applicable)

------------------------
Other notes:

-There are two videos that preceed TOS S01 E01: "The Time Element" pilot and an interview with Rod Serling by Mike Wallace - these I marked TOS but gave them no season/episode demarcation.

*Air/Sequence Date:  Uses the original air date of the episode UNLESS the network veered from the production order for its own purposes (ratings).  In these cases air dates have been shuffled to restore the series AS IF the networks aired them in production order.  So all can be watched as intended by the writers just by sorting alphabetically, from season to season and series to series.

-The file organization is intended for use with a view filter, using the above abbreviations to focus on a particular subset (eg series, season, year, etc..).  If u need a good filter (for windows anyway) I use/recommend xplorer2 (ctrl+H & ctrl+J functions).

Enjoy!
