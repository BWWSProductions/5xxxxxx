This is Len Martin's amazing booklet Judges, Lawyers and Other Destroyers (1992) which cites numerous examples of how judges, lawyers and other destroyers have combined forces to undermine and destroy the freedoms and prosperity of the people of the United States. Every state in America is facing serious problems. Specifically, there are economic hardships and various violations of peoples' rights. Rather than solving these problems, the situation continually gets worse. When the facts are studied, it becomes clear that the prime cause of the problems facing the American people (the honest ones) falls on the shoulders of the bankers and other moneylenders. These money-creating, money-lending thieves could not get away with their destructive schemes if it were not for the nations's corrupt system of justice. Laws are on the books for most borrowers to save their property and stop other violations of their rights. But the laws do little good because standing in the way is the judge/lawyer gang. The first American settlers viewed lawyers with contempt. All the extravagance and incompetence of the present government is due, in the main, to lawyers. They are responsible for nine-tenths of the vicious and useless laws that now clutter the statute books, and for all the evils that go with the vain attempt to enforce them. Every federal judge is a lawyer, so are most Congressmen. Every invasion of the plain rights of the citizens has a lawyer behind it. If all lawyers were hanged tomorrow, we would be freer and safer, and our taxes would be reduced by almost one half. Find out how judges and lawyers primarly work for the banks and not for the people who continue to be stabbed in the back in courtrooms. 40 pages. A must read for everyone.
