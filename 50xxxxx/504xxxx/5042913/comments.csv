,camicio,2009-11-24T19:10Z,"From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliders


Episodes aired out-of-order

The original filmed order for Season 1 episodes is as follows:

   1. ""Sliders"" (two-hour pilot episode)
   2. ""Summer of Love""
   3. ""Prince of Wails""
   4. ""Fever""
   5. ""Last Days""
   6. ""The Weaker Sex""
   7. ""Eggheads""
   8. ""The King is Back""
   9. ""Luck of the Draw""


The Fox Network aired the episodes in a different order to best capitalize on potential ratings-winning episodes, thus causing some continuity errors. For instance, the timer is first set to count down not in the pilot episode, but in ""Summer of Love"" ? since Fox aired ""Fever"" right after the pilot episode, though, many viewers were left confused as to why the Sliders suddenly had to leave within a very specific period of time. Similarly, the cliffhanger at the end of ""Summer of Love"" leads directly into the opening of ""Prince of Wails"" ? which Fox had actually aired a week earlier.[7]"
,camicio,2009-11-29T00:46Z,Does anyone have the english subtitles for episodes 06 to 12 of season 2 please? I can only find them for the first 5 episodes. Thanks.
,mialien,2010-02-23T23:44Z,"What language is this in? Are there any subtitles already encoded?

,Dramat,2010-04-24T23:05Z,"Gr8 upload! Thank You.

,wira020,2010-08-24T14:54Z,Will sum1 please reencode this into smaller size... perhaps using a much efficient codec like h264 and aac.. and use mkv container.. please... i really cant download 30GB... it's wayyyy tooo big!!... please anyone!! I really want to watch this...
,Zarod,2010-09-10T04:02Z,"And why is it set to ""private""?  DHT, Local Peer Discovery, and Peer Exchange not allowed?  Can this be re-upped as an open DHT instead of private?"
,s20dan,2010-09-22T02:55Z,"""i really cant download 30GB... it's wayyyy tooo big!!""

 Then only download half, that'll only be 15 gig.

,dannyboiii19,2011-06-17T13:27Z,Can someone tell me if its in english and there are no subtitles? Because i just want to watch it in english with no different language subs.
,Kzin42,2011-07-20T11:54Z,"Something odd with this Torrent I DL the first season then 1 ep of season 2 and now there are no longer any seeders or peers for it, has the RED down Arrow in Bittorent client. can any one explain what may be wrong? thanx"
,ILELECTRIC,2011-08-25T07:40Z,I know 30GiB sounds like a lot but think of it this way........ If you download each Season separately it comes to around 40-45GiB give or take. My suggestion is to get an External Hard Drive............ WELL WORTH IT!!! The Drive AND the Download!! THX
,photon3456,2011-12-19T06:28Z,"wow... old movie.. like it..

[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2012-01-26T21:25Z,"WHY DONT YOU READ THE TITLE? S=SEASONS
SEASONS ONE -1 TO FOUR -4
WHY WOULD ANYONE UP AN EPISODE AT 7.5 GIG? AGK DONT EVEN GO UP THAT FAR-READ THE TITLE OF THE TORRENT & THE TITLE CONTENT-UPLOADER WAS MERELY POINTIN OUT THAT THE 1ST EPS WERE SHOWN OUT OF ORDER SO THE EPILOGUES DIDNT MAKE SENSE-THIS IS SEASONS 1-4 NOT SEASON 1 ON ITS OWN."
