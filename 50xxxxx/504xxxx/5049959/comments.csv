Hvis ikke I kan finde ud af at rette fejlen i Windows kan jeg uploade korrektionen. Jeg har sat .srt på Unicode i min Linux, hvilket burde være European 8849-1 eller  8859-15."

It's obviously not a real DVD rip. It may be from a DVD, but it's recorded either with a screen capture program, or it's recorded with a tv/video tuner, with a dvd player connected to it.

Picture is blurry and shitty.

Audio is too loud, meaning the source was turned up too loud so now it's distorted. Again a sign of it not being a real rip.

I hope whoever ripped it, learned a few things since it was done.

It's watchable, but it's SHIT quality."
