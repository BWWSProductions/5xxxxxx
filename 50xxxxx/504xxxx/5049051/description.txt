Assuming the role of a young farmer, experience the 18 hours a day lifestyle of running a busy farm in the middle of beautiful, rolling countryside. You start the game by choosing from a small collection of basic vehicles and machinery to explore your fairly sparce farmland which measures a mere 4 km2.

Playing in Career Mode, your aim is to whip the farm into shape, expand your fleet of farm machinery and become as successful a farmer as possible. As you progress through the game you ll need to visit the local agricultural machinery store to trade in your old vehicles and equipment for newer kit. You can choose between seven beautifully detailed tractors, four combine harvesters and over 20 tools such as a plough, seeder, baler and a self loading wagon.
