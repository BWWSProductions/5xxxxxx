Described by some fans as her "acoustic masterpiece," Tammy Wynette's 1987 album Higher Ground is an all-star event, featuring collaborations with Ricky Skaggs, Gene Watson, Vern Gosdin, Emmylou Harris, Vince Gill, the Gatlin Brothers, the O'Kanes, Ricky Van Shelton, Paul Overstreet, and Rodney Crowell. Released on Epic and produced by Steve Buckingham, the album peaked at No. 43 on the Country Albums Chart. The single "Your Love" reached No. 12 on the Country Singles Chart, followed by "Talkin' to Myself Again," which peaked at No. 16. A third single, "Beneath a Painted Sky," reached No. 25.

Long out of print, Higher Ground is one of the strongest albums in Tammy's later catalogue.
