Schizophonic - Geri Halliwell [1999]	


Schizophonic was the debut solo album by pop singer Geri Halliwell after her split from popular girl group the Spice Girls.  Three of the four singles from the album went to number one in the United Kingdom, while the debut single made number two. The album was a commercial success and actually sold better than Forever, the Spice Girls album that was released after Halliwell's departure from the group.
The album debuted at no.4 in the United Kingdom, selling 31,274 in its first week, and 483,419 in total, being certified 2x Platinum for shipments of 600,000 copies.
In the United States, the album faced medium success, selling 40,000 copies in its first week debuting and peaking at no.42 on the Billboard Hot 200 (still the strongest Spice Girls solo showing on the chart). Eventually, the album was certified Gold in 2001 with shipments of 500,000 copies.

Schizophonic was released with 2 different covers, representing an angel (white), and a devil (red); both covers are the same edition of the album. On the first O on Schizophonic there is an angel halo on the white cover and horns on the red cover. On the back cover, the song titles are written on both red and white, relating the theme of the song to one of the personalities. The booklet of the album features both covers on all editions, and the lyrics of the songs are included on the side that they are marked on the back cover.
