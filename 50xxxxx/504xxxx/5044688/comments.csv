,beish,2009-08-09T00:24Z,"This is great upload man. Thanks, but i have a this one problem :( 
When i try to run a simulation there is error saying ""Some of the components needed by this simulation have not been installed. Please close the course materials and run the setup program for this course"". All other course materials are working just fine. If anyone can please help me with this??? IÂ´m seeding this. "
,yen81,2009-08-10T08:56Z,"Thic problem may occur on new cources. To avoid it, follow the instruction.

1. Install one of the old Testout cources (for example, 70-294). Don't change the default path (C:\Program Files\TESTOUT).

2. With a program that works with ISO images (UltraISO and others) extract the content to a new folder (for example, C:\Exchange 70-236).

3. From the folder  C:\Program Files\TESTOUT delete subfolders Glossary, Outlines, Questions, resources, Sims or rename them different names however you want.

4. From the folder  ?:\Exchange 70-236 copy subfolders Glossary, Outlines, Questions, resources, Sims to C:\Program Files\TESTOUT.

5. In the folder C:\Program Files\TESTOUT\Outlines\ rename file ms236cle.xml to ms294ce.xml.

6. Launch TestOut Navigator. In the choice window you are going to see the old cource. Choose it - you will see the new one."
,MrB8,2009-08-12T03:57Z,how do we get past the activation code screen?
,yen81,2009-08-12T04:18Z,"Sorry, what activation are you talking about? When it is needed?"
,MrB8,2009-08-12T06:22Z,"I installed 70-640, when I start it, it asks for a login, I click on create account then it asks for an activation code."
,yen81,2009-08-12T09:08Z,"You don't need to install 70-640. First you should install one of previous cources that need no activation (for example, any of MCSE, you may choose 70-294). Then you mount ""Configuring Windows Server 2008 AD 70-640.iso"" file to a virtual drive and copy every folder from \Testout\ to C:\Program Files\Testout. Then you should rename file C:\Program Files\Testout\Outlines\ms640_cle.xml to MS294CLE.xml. It works. Check this out.

I cannot install Network+. My antivirus program (Norman Security) detecting an infected file, called Xpexplorer.se, and deleting.
Could anyone help me, please!"
,yen81,2009-08-16T14:04Z,"I don't know what is Norman Security. If it is possible, add this file to trusted list or something like that, so it could be run without scanning.

Thank you very much for the help!
I do not know how to add the file mentioned in a trusted list. But for the meantime, I disabled Norman Security, and now the video works just fine.
Thanks"
,MadPAM,2009-08-25T15:24Z,"Hey Guys - I need some help.
I install 294 and it works just fine. Then I move the 5 294 directories (as described) somewhere else and copy 647 (which I want) into the TESTOUT directory and rename the XML file to ms294cle.xml (as it is called in 294). When I start the Navigator the lower Product Information field is empty and the course doesn't start.
If I then move the 294 files back into the TESTOUT directory and start the Navigator again, it also doesn't work anymore.
Please - what am I doing wrong???"

,big_bad_wolf_99,2009-08-28T06:32Z,"Hi yen81, downloaded and installed 294 goes ok, did the file swith over stuff but when I try on 70 643 it says it can't locate the file MS294CLE.xml
??????? Any ideas, or has any one found this to work OK??????? Thanks all the same as some of this stuff works OK"
,big_bad_wolf_99,2009-08-28T06:51Z,tried it on  70 647 and does not go says cant find the file 
,big_bad_wolf_99,2009-08-28T07:38Z,"OK stupid me... it does work. This is what I did.
1. Install 294 as normal. Installing to disk as in C: not running from disk
2. run it and make sure it goes OK... it will
3. delete the 5 files that yen81 says to delete
4. mount the 70 643 or what ever to POWER ISO or what ever. Copy the 5 folders to the c:/testout ..... basically to the location of the 294 stuff
5. now this is the bit I did wrong but goes now. Rename the file to ms294cle and it should already have the defult xml attached to it. so all I had to do was rename to ms294cle And nothing else. Run as you did for the 294.....
6. Enjoy.... thanks again yen81"

,jaystar123,2009-11-01T23:41Z,HELP GUYS!! I dont even have the orbis//legacy folder where did you guys get it?
,1morelia,2009-11-25T08:28Z,"First of all, thanks yen81 for the upload!
Can somebody tell me what are the ones that do not need activation, please? I am only trying to get MCSA.
Also, on the second step of the instructions, what one needs to extract with PowerIso to a new folder is THE NEW COURSE that you want to mount onto the old one, is that right?
Thanks for your help!"
,1morelia,2009-12-03T22:10Z,"Hi guys, me again.

I am trying 70-270. It installed and runs well but WITH NO SOUND . . . any ideas, help, suggestions, please? . . . . . . "
,Omega8472,2009-12-10T22:22Z,"Awesome Download!
For those that want to install the old A+ Operating Systems Technologies course, install it before every other one because for some reason it cannot install to a directory with a space. If you install others first you will have to reinstall to a directory without a space. I got half way through and it happened to me. I haven't installed it because it is old, but I think there might be a workaround. Start in safe-mode remove the space in program files and install it then add the space after install.

http://www.testout.com/support/kbdetail.aspx?KBA-01006

Also for Vista users this might also be an issue for you

http://www.testout.com/support/kbdetail.aspx?KBA-01029"
,Omega8472,2009-12-11T11:55Z,"For those who are wondering, the following require activation:

CCNA 640-802
BCMSN 642-812
BSCI 642-901
WS2k8 70-640
WS2k8 70-643
WS2k8 70-642
ES2k7 70-236
WS2k8 70-647
WS2k8 70-647

The clue is the different style launchers. If it has a black guy a white guy and an Asian (I know its a setup for a joke) Then it Doesn't need activation, otherwise it does. I did install all except the above and got access.

Side Note: I ran into another problem and am not sure what the cause was. After installing about half the labsims I opened the launcher and noticed only one was in the list. I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling everything to c:\Testout instead of C:\program files(x86) to get it to work. OS: ""Windows 7 Ultimate ala TPB""

I was also wondering if there is a way to work around the activation and still be able to use the old Labsims. Any Ideas?"

Here is what i did. 
1- i had already 294 already installed 
2- i replaced the folders and changed the name of the file to the old name as the comments said but when i started the sim it said it need some files that is not installed
3- i installed the new testout 647 which i need and restarted it asked for the user name and password but i noticed that now i have the folder orbis which i didn't have first so reinstalled the old one again and replaced the file ms294le.xls with the new file ms_647le.xls and changed the name
