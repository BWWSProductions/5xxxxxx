,Arxidis,2009-10-20T07:44Z,"I really appreciate all your work. I have my iphone filled up with movies by you :) . I just have one request if possible and if you have the time. I would appreciate it if you could create a perfect iphone copy of the Wolverine WORKPRINT (for reasons like different music, different filters in this unfinished copy). I understand that you may not do this since you do official movies but for certain reasons it's important to me and even though I tried I haven't been able to create a perfect copy like you guys do. Please let me know if you can, I will appreciate it a lot. Thank you for all your work."
