It could be of help for people with only a standard DVD burner, but for a minimal price, someone can just pick up a dual-layer DVD for $20-50 or just mount them into a hard-drive enclosure, 
( I actually have mine set up that way so I can use it on my tower & just plug it into my laptop when I'm out. It cost me about $80 for the 320gb 2.5"" drive & case and just took some time to extract the dvd's to it. Now I can use it wherever I need it and I just erase and copy the newer versions as I get them.).
Definite nice trick though...
I wonder if anyone can figure out how to merge the data dvd's onto 1 blue-ray disk...???"
