,DevilPrez,2009-08-16T12:21Z,"Well...Bogwart, if you look at the files' length, you notice most of 'em are 1.4 GB.....do the math again...Thanx Sheila for the torrent, will seed"
,bogwart,2009-08-17T02:08Z,Silly me.  There I was thinking I could rely on the info panel.
,ares0103,2009-08-31T21:10Z,"is the language in english?
obviously it is english
since its BBC documentary rite??
otherwise i wud hav trouble understanding
cos the subs are only in romanian..
sry if this is a stupid questn"
,sinesurfer,2009-09-17T09:34Z,Are the sub-titles hard/subs or in a .srt files?
,eappan,2009-09-28T04:47Z,"Shiela6,
Do u have it in NTSC format?

Also it will be easier for people to identify if u explicitly mention video format in PAL/NTSC in title or in description, instead of 25fps."
,gillesjmenard,2009-10-12T16:19Z,thanl you very much for this upload. took 1.5 days to get which is not baf considering the size. being a bbc production the quality is great. i cannot seem to get the audio even when i use the latest release of VLC. can anyone help. i'm in ntsc country but that should not be a problem since my laptop is connected to my digital tv and i'm playing the files directly from the hard drive.
,gillesjmenard,2009-10-12T16:24Z,ooooops!!!! got the audio by choosing track 3 in audio settings. again tx for a great upload .seeding as i write
,t06afre,2009-11-03T19:47Z,Sorry to say it but this was boring stuff. BBC have not done a good job with this one. 
,pentagraham,2009-11-15T00:11Z,the descriptions of the episodes make the history seem questionable.
,rens0000,2009-11-24T16:56Z,"ehhm, this maybe a stupid question but why would you convert each episode individually. Now you need 6 dvdÂ´s... 2 would be enough.
Aint it allot smarter to just make complete dvdÂ´s?? containing 3 episodes each??"
,giantic12,2010-01-30T13:23Z,bravo mah....macar am gasit shi yo un film cu subtritari in romana....bv
,Trexian66,2010-02-06T19:27Z,"Has anyone tried to extract the iso's and compile this onto  DVD 9 or 2 DVD R's ?

Seems silly to burn 6 disks 1/4 full"
,penfold_3946,2010-02-08T04:56Z,Seed plx......this d/l is slow
,GoldUsher,2010-02-23T02:18Z,"OMG...this is SO simplified it's like a comic book!
Just watched Caesar and can't believe how bad it is. IF you are looking for something more accurate, this isn't it. Production values up to BBC's high standards but that's all. 

Any student of history will sit agape at the missing or misleading info despite the disclaimer at the start this is BASED on real histories (which apparently real liberties were taken with in the same vein as the Beeb's ""Casanova"")

We are totally surprised at how let down we are by Auntie Beeb on this one -- usually number one in the history arena.

,lareth,2010-04-01T23:15Z,"The third was also corrupted. Started fucking around after about 30 sec, so got tired of watching. Too bad, might have enjoyed this."
