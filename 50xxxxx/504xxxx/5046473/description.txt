The Delfonics are a pioneering Philadelphia soul singing group, most popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Their most notable hits include "La-La (Means I Love You)", "Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)," "Break Your Promise," "I'm Sorry," and "Ready or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide from Love)". Their songs are written by lead vocalist and founder William Hart and have been used extensively in numerous film soundtracks, the most notable being Quentin Tarantino's movie Jackie Brown, in which their music ("La-La (Means I Love You)" and "Didn't I Blow Your Mind") is used as a pivotal part of the plot to underscore the relationship between Pam Grier and Robert Forster. The film helped create a border-line cult following for the songs and this group. Their songs have been sampled extensively by various hip-hop and rap artists including: The Fugees ("Ready or Not"),The Notorious B.I.G., Nas, Boyz II Men, Missy Elliott and DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. These William Hart songs have been covered by numerous other performers, including Aretha Franklin, The Jackson 5, Patti LaBelle, New Kids on the Block, Todd Rundgren, Prince, Swing Out Sister and The Manhattan Transfer, among
