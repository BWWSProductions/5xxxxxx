,Vinlandr,2009-08-08T07:49Z,"It's installing as I type this, so far so good.
Had no problem downloading it."
,Vinlandr,2009-08-08T07:58Z,works pretty good so far.
,starscream107,2009-08-08T11:07Z,"prompt me please in a game only English, where to get Russian localization? I beg pardon for bad English "
,Sematary,2009-08-08T12:24Z,"As expected, the game is far from unfinished and customers are bound to pay for working as betas.

It seems there are major bugs that make the game unplayable, mainly one introduced in 1.1 that forces to drive all IC to consumer goods, thus leaving all other areas at 0.

1.2 will be badly needed."
,dziban303,2009-08-08T18:34Z,"These games have always been a pain in the fucking ass in terms of bugs and balancing issues. HOI2 is *still* being patched, mostly by the community, because Paradox Games doesn't know what the fuck they're doing."

[T],Knaster,2009-08-09T11:12Z,Hey dziban303 GO FUCK yourself 
,acezee,2009-08-10T06:41Z,Requesting help on install please. 
,Nohg,2009-08-12T15:33Z,"While I think dziban303 was a bit rough....I agree. 

The community DOES end up doing about 50% of the developing.

But that's OK. Paradox always lays some good groundwork."

,skilledhavoc,2009-12-09T13:20Z,"i normally can figure out how to get these thigns installed but i have no idea at all what to do, its jsut a bunch of winrar files and crap i have never seen before, help would be awsome thanks"
,urdoomd,2009-12-25T20:53Z,"@ skilled havoc. Download winrar from www.rarlab.com. After installation, right click on one of the icons that look like a stack of books and either ""extract here"" or ""extract without confrimation"" (makes an additional folder). Then you should be able to figure it out from there."

,Lyca77,2012-02-14T22:02Z,"Hi, by making this message I intend to be harsh and heavily critical. What kind of bullshit fucking torrent is this? Who wants to download 50 god damn parts. Fuck this torrent. Upload the iso god dammit, not 50 parts."
,nodirhon13,2012-03-08T00:39Z,"ok this is the step of installing progress.... 
 1) download the torrent
 2) extract one of the ""sr-hoi3"" rar. files
 3) mount BIN file  using software  ( i recommend daemon tools) 
 4) install and follow instruction...
 5) play :)"
