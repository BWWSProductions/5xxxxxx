I have one request for you bro, I want you to reseed one of your old torrent ""In Cold Blood"". Can you please reseed it, here's the link : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4516275/(PSX-PSP)_In_Cold_Blood_converted_properly_(Kingdom-games_by_Klo"
[T],TaurusKJ,2009-08-07T07:27Z,What if you want to play it on your modded PSX or PS2? Is this possible yet with your conversion? Thanks in advance.
