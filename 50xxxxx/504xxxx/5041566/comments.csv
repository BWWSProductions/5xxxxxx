please help!!"
,Lliam,2009-08-16T01:36Z,"Oh how stupid of me =D
the dvd..

@Don_naza

Are you sure that you've done that?
Because it worked fine for me =S..
I'll write how I've done it....

I got the files, they were blank, not in an actual ""file type"" yet.
I double clicked on one of them(doesn't matter which one), and chose to open the file with an existing program I had on the computer.
I chose Winrar...
Then it automaticly opened and showed an ISO file, which was the game.

I extracted that file.
And by extracting it, a map has been created in the same folder that I chose to view the blank file with Winrar.

In the Map were a new file, which i mounted""in Daemon tools"" then the Auto-start thing came up, and asked if I wanted to start the game setup..
and there I got it. installed the game and started it without problems."
