In this savory PBS documentary, host Rick Sebak crisscrosses the United States -- from Buffalo, N.Y., to San Jose, Calif. -- in search of the country's best sandwich. Sebak sinks his teeth into a long list of culturally diverse sandwiches, including New Orleans' muffaletta, Pittsburgh's chipped ham "Slammer," Buffalo's "Beef-on-Weck," Houston's barbecue on a bun and, of course, Philadelphia's world-famous cheesesteak. Starring: Rick Sebak.
