As usual, if you have problems with subtitle files, install VLC."
,celtfanatic90,2009-08-19T22:39Z,This film got banned in the uk lol
,LilleJente,2009-08-21T02:11Z,Is this the unrated version? Or is it no such thing? :P 
,celtfanatic90,2009-08-21T03:02Z,"i their is an unrated version, its from a deeper circle of hell than this satanspawn lol"
,celtfanatic90,2009-08-21T03:03Z,if*
,S-the-Wolf,2009-08-21T08:20Z,"Just finished downloading this. This is one bad ass movie that makes the Saw and Hostel films seem childish. If you want subtitles both of the links list by kosen63 and Dillster work pretty well.

,KRYPT0N1T3,2009-08-21T15:03Z,insane movie
,shawnduhast,2009-08-22T01:53Z,"This is the Unrated version, a title card on the front says so.

A=10 V=10 for a 700Mb version

IMHO it's OK but doesn't really set up much atmosphere or tension as much as it should. Gore is good but needs more than just that.

http://www.uk.imdb.com/title/tt0856288/
Inside the French film I felt is much better as a very gory horror film with tension and atmospgere, that the UK distributors were told don't even bother submitting it for certification so a UK release has been dropped. "
,the-chojin,2009-10-02T18:16Z,"shawnduhast 
 inside got issued with an 18 cert
