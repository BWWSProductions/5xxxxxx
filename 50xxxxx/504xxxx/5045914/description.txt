The Noble Dead Saga is a series of series that chain together rather than containing separate series stories. It tells the saga-level tale of a long forgotten conflict in the world, that once wiped out recollection of history, and the possibility that forces behind this mythical war may return again.

First series

The first series of six novels by Barb and J.C. Hendee tells the story of Magiere ( a dhampir, a vampire/human hybrid), Leesil (a half-elf, an elf/human hybrid, with a dark past), and Chap (a strange breed of dog rarely seen in the world). Magiere is unaware of her ancestry, the discovery of which comes as a considerable shock, and leads the trio into a tangle path that uncovers hints of the Forgotten History and what may be coming.

At the start of the story, the two "half-breeds", together with Chap, make a reasonable living pretending to be vampire-hunters. Eventually the inevitable happens and they cross paths with genuine vampires, or Noble Dead as they are called in the saga. Hoisted by their own petard, they are plunged unwillingly into a dark battle and into their own dark fates.

Second Series

The second series incorporates a new trio consisting of two characters met in Series 1, a significant 3rd protangonist, and a new antagonist in form of a new type of Noble Dead. The new series is set about a year after Series 1, ended in different part of the world, and is presently planned as three books. According to the authors, additional series will follow to bring the saga to its final conclusion, making this "series of series" one of the more unique approaches to a longer dark/high fantasy tale.

The second series centers around Journeyor Wynn, the scholar, Vampire Chane, her protector, the Fay-Dog / Mahayji Shade, daughter of Chap and Lily. A new type of Noble Dead, a Wraith is featured.

This is another PDF formatted eBook that I have built from the ground up, to be better than what I normally find online. There were a lot of HTML artifacts to be removed and I think I got most of them. I also worked very hard on the paragraph and chapter structure, which always drives me nuts when i get eBook shares online. 

If I have the opportunity, I will go back and rebuild the six books from the first series when I have time. 

I will seed through the night, and then off and on through the weekend, or until they take my home and/or internet away.

Please comment and let me know what you think and how the Dl went.

I hope you enjoy it, and PLEASE SEED!!!
