THE VOICE OF A TWO-PERSON NATION IN WYOMING. 
Radio Free Nestlandia is a multi-subject talk show produced by an unusual married couple who comprise the two-person sovereign nation of Nestlandia, which is located in a normal neighborhood in Casper, Wyoming. 

Author Michael W. Dean and his talented wife Debra Jean Dean stick a giant virtual antenna on their roof to entertain and delight the world with their spirited discussions of art, marriage, sex, politics, science, cats, shopping, guns, liberty, love, sex, bondage, travel and shoes, as well as opining on their love of the First and Second Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.
