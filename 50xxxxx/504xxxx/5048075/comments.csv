,Ykalon,2009-08-09T01:56Z,Whoever the idiot is who decided to zip an already rared release I hope you first freeze to death and when burn in hell. Totally IDIOTIC. ZERO benefit. But ONLY bothersome. NOT NEEDED.
,Groo_The_Wanderer,2009-08-09T08:51Z,"Files are packed according to scene rules ...

The uploaded files are ZIPped.

Inside the ZIPped files are the RAR files.

How to unzip all files in an easy way:

Select all ZIP files, right click and click Extract files..."

   burn in hell and suck my cook .i."
,kalle,2009-08-09T13:58Z,"Here is the save fix.

1. Go wherever you extracted the game.
2. Go into the buccaneer folder.
3. Go into the data folder.
4. Create a folder called ""Captains""
5. You can now save your progress

So for instance my directory looks like this

""F:\Buccaneer.The.Pursuit.of.Infamy\buccaneer\data\Captains"""

Stop raring and zipping!
I allways delete all rars and zips after install anyway."
,iokots,2009-09-02T09:07Z,"the MOST idiotic upload I've met
what's the point of so many zips and rars"
,SphinXXXXX,2009-09-03T23:19Z,"Thanks bro..
Scene Releases ROCK!!
We can know for sure that it works perfectly..
Nice work guys.. :)"
,johnboy1998,2009-11-15T12:42Z,Downloading now Thnx! Stop complaining guys rars and zip files so what! Log on to steam and buy it then creeps!
,SIlentOmen,2009-11-29T04:12Z,"Im not entirely sure, but maybe all that extra zipping is to hide the fact there is a virus/security threat, norton picks it up when the installer is at bout 2%, so despite i loved the demo of this game i cant install this version. If the 'Unleashers' would like to comment on why their code is recognised by norton please do."
,Hasaosan,2011-06-05T22:03Z,"@SIlentOmen

or should i say RETARDOmen

Nortin picks up all kinds of false positive... u CAN'T be serious when u say ur using Nortin  the worlds WORST anti-virase in the world... hell id rather DL an anti virase software from HERE then use that pos (note dling an anti-virase soft from a pirate-site/ unofficial-site is a BAD idea)"
,adawadawada,2011-06-10T10:12Z,"It's a .rar inside a .rar inside a .zip!

COMPRESSION!!!

Seriously though, why'd you have to do all that?

Works fine otherwise."
