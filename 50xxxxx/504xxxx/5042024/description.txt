At the heart of "11:11" lies Rod & Gab s wish to celebrate some of the great musicians, both past and present, who have inspired them along the way. Each of the eleven tracks is a musical "gracias" to a delicious and diverse assortment of talent. Some are transparent - the "Voodoo Chile" quoting "Buster Voodoo" is a clear nod of appreciation to Hendrix - others are more discreet. Metal God Alex Skolnick of Testament joins them on "Atman", a thrilling Arabesque charge in celebration of Dimebag Darrell, replete with a scorching total shred solo from Skolnick.
