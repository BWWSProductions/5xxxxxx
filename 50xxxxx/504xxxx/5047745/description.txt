Departures demos from 2007 - 2008.


Stuff we had lying around, recorded at various places throughout the year, which we decided to release for free since it was just gathering dust.

If you enjoy this, take the time to check out the myspace.

We have a 4-track self titled EP on iTunes, and an upcoming split with Atlantic Hearts on the way.


Departures, August 2009.
