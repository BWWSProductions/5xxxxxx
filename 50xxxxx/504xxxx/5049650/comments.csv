,headcaver2,2009-08-22T07:42Z,"I liked this movie! thanks to the release group..
It gave me a bit of insight to the life of an alcoholic, and how that lifestyle erodes one's moral compass to the point that they become such a monster.
Apparently, > 50% of murders are committed by people when they are drunk. Alcohol is a major social problem, but its legal.. go figure.
Anyway, intense movie.. watch it whilst u get sloshed!"
,libertaswv,2010-06-02T04:52Z,"Thanks, FxM - You're gone but not forgotten. Never did see this one, but it made Ebert's top 10 independent films list for 2009, so i figure it's worth checking out. 

If anyone is still hunting subs, Subscene has 'em: http://subscene.com/Julia/subtitles-78385.aspx

Thanks for the up!"
,libertaswv,2010-06-04T00:44Z,"Good quality up: 10/10. Eng subtitles i linked to are solid as well.

The movie? Very well done, but pretty depressing. 

Plus....and i don't THINK this requires a spoiler warning....It's one of those 'choose your own ending' kinda flicks, where they don't give you a clear conclusion. Did X happen? Did Y happen? It's left up to the viewer to decide (i hate that kinda thing, myself)."
