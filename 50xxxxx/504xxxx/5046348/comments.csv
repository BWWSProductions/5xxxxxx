,eclipse0,2009-08-28T18:33Z,This game requires a little bit of brains so you guys thinking this is boring should go back to your Super Mario and FPS games. This game is fantastic!
,funkyDL,2009-09-04T21:56Z,"lol maybe school-freaks likes this game. but in my opinion this sucks. just click click and click.

,fel.cha42,2009-10-08T10:34Z,"Does this game lags like HOI2?? 

I remembered i quit playing because after a while the computer made so many moves a PC turn took like a minute to pass. And this was in a P4 with 3gb ram, long after the game was released, and no fix for that was found."
,Neusyn,2009-10-10T22:16Z,One the best strategy games I have ever played. Works great and is compact.

Component transfer error

Component: Core files
File Group: common
File: E:\data2.cab
Error: Data error (cyclic reducdancy check).

Any help please? I'd like to play tonight :)"
,KaidoM,2009-12-27T04:10Z,"try clearing your hard drive up, that usually means its full... or redownload, you have a broken file.

As for the download, great speeds, will be seeding this one for a while. Thanks Groo."

,Fascii,2010-04-27T00:07Z,"Can somebody explain how to instal this? There's an assload of rars, but I'm not sure what to do."
,lareth,2010-06-08T16:04Z,Unpack one of the packed fiels and it will unpack the whole piece of shit. Then install how ever it is installed. Havent even downloaded yet but I'm guessing it'll work with all the good comments.
,Henjii,2010-06-15T16:08Z,"This sucks. The game wont start saying ""this application has failed to start because d3dx9_35.dl was not found""

And when i try to uninstall the game it says ""Component: core files""
""error: catastrophic failure""

WTF? No I cant play it our even uninstall it."
,svecenik,2010-07-29T22:44Z,You can find new beta updates here!hoi.comule.com!(with out !) No need for game key or some other stupidities!
,Cornish-Pirate,2010-08-19T00:58Z,"For those who don't know how to install:

Needed programs: WinRAR, Power ISO (or other mounting software)

1. In the downloaded folder right click on one of the sr-hoi3 files and click Extract here

2. Open the mounting software and mount the .bin file

3. Go to My Computer (or Computer) and run Autoplay

4. Install the game and play! :D

Big thanks to Groo_The_Wanderer for this!

If you get a d3dx9_35.dl not found error like Henjii when installing a game it just means you have to install the DirectX package that comes with the game which is usually an option during installation so i reccomend chosing it everytime you install a game."
,ddcarson,2011-01-07T14:27Z,"@ Henjii   You can download almost any .dll-file from the net, just type the name of .dll to google and pick a good link and download it. Then move the file to the folder where you installed the game. (If it's .rar or .iso etc. you must obviously extract it first.) This should clear at least your .dll problem."
,rajeevrn,2011-01-31T19:18Z,"this is a great game...great up!!!

works fine...but is slow on fast systems"
,bashprompt,2011-02-22T06:54Z,"Fuck having to mount shit, grab the extract-and-play version, this version sucks."
