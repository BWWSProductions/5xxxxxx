Renato FalcÃ£o's feature debut, Margarette's Feast, is a silent film that recalls the early days of cinema. Pedro (Hique Gomez) is a lower-class factory worker who is fired as the film begins. He is handed a container full of cash as severance pay and becomes embroiled with street kids, a cab driver, and police officers. He eventually pays for a lavish birthday dinner for his wife, Margarette (Ilana Kaplan), but eventually reality settles in. Margarette's Feast was screened at the Rio de Janeiro Festival and the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival.
