COUNTRY JOE & THE FISH
---------------------------------------------------------
Electric Music For the Mind and Body 1967 (first album)

Vangard reissue jewel case  ed.

"...The CD reissue also has the virtue of being one of the best analog-to-digital transfers ever issued on one of Vanguard Records' classic albums, with startlingly vivid stereo separation and a close, intimate sound." ~ All Music Guide.

I used XLD for Mac (CDParanoia Mode) log included, 
Flac extracted with XLD at 0 compression, fastest, best quality.

Sorry no artwork.
