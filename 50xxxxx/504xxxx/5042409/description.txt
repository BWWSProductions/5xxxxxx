This file has been scanned with NOD and AVG
Please scan ALL your downloads. I do NOT upload virus.
If you dont understand what a "bik" file is in the game, do NOT download this.
This is a modified replacement opening credit videos which does NOT show all the opening credits so you can get to game faster.
Its basically "ripping" the bloatware out of the opening video.
You want to play your game without having to keep hitting escape all the time to get past the opening credits. then download this.
So yes, this is small, it is intended to be, I removed all but 1 frame out of the intro logo videos. you want yur games to boot right up without having to watch all those credits? then this is how its done.

Tired of those damn LONG PLAYING ad intros in your games?
You know, the Nvidia logo and Take Two game logo and so on, you have to wait for them 
to finish just to get to the game.
Some games wont let yougo past it by tapping the escape key.

So this is where I come in.
This is for the Gears of War Game. An annoying logo ad.
NOT NOW!
Copy these files into the Gears of WarWarGameMovies folder.
(in case this doesnt show the backslashes, find the "Gears of War" then the "WarGame" folder, then the "Movies" folder.
Start the game and wala! go right to the game!!! On this one, the screen will blank a few seconds and then bring up the game menu.
All I did was zero out the "bik" ad intro.
You still get the game intro, just not the minute long adds!

This file is zipped up, so download and just unzip it in that folder!
Be watching for more for other games as over the next few days I will be releasing a 
bunch more of these.
