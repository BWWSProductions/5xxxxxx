,sargenttaters,2009-09-01T01:00Z,"i didnt think there were different clan/inner sphere paks for mech vengeance/black knight and mercenaries. i downloaded the mech paks and tried to install them and it installed them only to vengeance and black knight. i removed vengeance and black knight to attempt to force it to install to mercenaries, but it told me i had to install vengeance first. i know this should work for mercenaries, because i used to have the packs working for it. can i get a bit of help please?"

,stonerhosch,2009-10-17T01:47Z,"I have yet to install but when i do, "" i have vista"" i assume to run it as XP? or will it just work on vista??  I plan on making an .iso with MagicISO, know do i only need to burn just the 2CDs of MW4 to the cds??  ANd i see that the Clan Mech Pak & Inner Sphere Mech Pak are .iso, so how do i install those, would i also have to burn those to CD??  And exactly what are those too packs??  I think that is it for questions. Thanks for any feedback provided.

I use to play MW2 as a child and i thought it was the shit!!!"

,Vyschalla,2010-01-14T20:06Z,"I have 2 problems with this torrent so far. First and foremost, the Blacknight .iso freezes at 87% upon install and usually locks up my windows when it freezes. Luckily I still have my old blacknight CD so that wasnt an issue.  Next issue is the mech packs. They both installed flawlessly and gave me no issues at all, but none of the new mechs or equipment show up in my mechlab or instant action tabs. Are they multiplayer only? Do they only become unlocked during campaign play? I read up on the mech packs and that doesnt seem to be the case, so I am at a loss as to why the new content doesnt show up."
,lordstrike,2010-01-18T08:23Z,I have a problem with the disc 2 of MW revenge... I can't lunch it... If someone can help me it would me cool.

[T],Skymocker,2011-09-15T13:27Z,"I've just successfully downloaded and run the game on windows 7 32x.  
INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS WITH CD KEYS - you'll want a pen & paper, alt-tabbing or resizing the install screen makes you restart the install in order to type the full cd-key at once....

Thanks for the great upload.

,gavilatius,2011-10-12T05:39Z,"found the solution for MECHLAB, DO NOT INSTALL BLACK KNIGHT yet, install the update 2.0 for Vengeance first and then copy crack. then play, it worked for me. after finishing the Campaign, then install the expansion."
,Zenoliath,2011-10-15T23:41Z,"Found a fix for if the game isn't loading.
# Right-click the games shortcut.
# Click on the ""Shortcut"" tab.
# Find where the target is.
# It should say something like this- ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Mechwarrior 4\MW4.exe""
   But varies per PC.
# At the end of the text just add /gosnovideo after MW4.exe""
# It should look like this now-  ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Mechwarrior 4\MW4.exe"" /gosnovideo
                                                                                   (Don't forget to add a space here ^)
# Add /gosnovideo at the end of Black Knights shortcut aswell

Hope that helped!
Good luck."
,Zenoliath,2011-10-15T23:44Z,"Sorry, where is says in my comment (Don't forget to add a space here ^)
It meant to point between- MW4.exe"" /gosnovideo
The space is supposed to be here....^

Hope that helps!
Good luck"
,chrispm84,2012-03-14T11:41Z,"Great torrent, works fine! 

To everyone that was having the pain-in-the-ass freezes with the intro video not showing, but audio playing, here's the fix. It worked for me, anyway.

FFdshow comes with many codec packs and you may even have it and not know. Look into your program files and see if you have a ffdshow folder. If you do, uninstall it via the Add/Remove programs, in your control panel. ffdshow is just trying to interact with the videos and the game really doesn't like that. Just like Fallout 3 didn't like it... Anyway, hope this helps some people. "
,drop-dead,2012-04-23T00:02Z,"Can somebody help me out?  I downloaded the torrent, and when I try to install MW4, it says I need the discs to install it.  Any way I can get by this?"
