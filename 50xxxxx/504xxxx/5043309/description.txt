Steven Spielberg directed this romantic remake of the World War II film A GUY NAMED JOE. A daredevil firefighter pilot, Pete Sandich (Richard Dreyfuss), dies after saving fellow flyer Al (John Goodman), leaving behind his soulmate, Dorinda (Holly Hunter). Pete, in ghost form, "wakes up" six months later when an angel, Hap (Audrey Hepburn), instructs him to somehow resolve his relationship with Dorinda. Pete must selflessly and silently encourage Dorinda to overcome her grief with the help of a new love.
