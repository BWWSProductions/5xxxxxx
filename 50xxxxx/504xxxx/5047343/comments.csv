,Fatzkid,2009-12-20T23:05Z,"Had one little snag in the first video, but other than that, FUCKING EPIC.  If you like Coheed, you'll love this.  It the feeling of being able to see their expressions and their emotions when they play their songs.  Im seeding back 5x, plz at least seed a little to help others enjoy such a wonderful collection."
,candlejack89,2010-01-21T18:11Z,"This torrent is shit, some of the songs are spliced with other songs, do not download."
,candlejack89,2010-01-21T18:12Z,"When i say some i mean a good 20% of them, spliced with songs from other bands, really bad bands to."
,hyteck,2010-03-31T20:45Z,"@candlejack89 Stop making shit up, I know your mommy and daddy don't give you attention so this is how you have to get it, the two people above you said it's fine."
,eagle_poacher,2010-06-12T06:38Z,"I saw Coheed last month and they always put a GREAT show. If you havent seen them live and your a fan. You are really missing out. They put electricity in the air!!!  ,\m/

I'll seed this forever."
,_Dude,2010-08-24T00:48Z,i personally own the standard version of this. i just want to be able to listen to it when i'm not watching it. i just don't see why i have to pay 140 bucks for that...
,GamingPhoenix,2011-12-23T10:13Z,"@_Dude It was $140 because it was nine discs, a huuuge book, and a special dragonfly. If you got it early enough, your NAME was actually in the back of the book."
