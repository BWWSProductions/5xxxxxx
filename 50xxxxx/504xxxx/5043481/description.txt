The latest slab of Structural Damage noise comes from The Grand Ayatollah (aka DJ The Blade) who has given us 10 tracks of irreverent gabber, gonzo sample fisting and rungle-clotted amen destruction that leaves few genres un-violated. Guaranteed to leave YOU with ears like the raggardy end of a wet binbag, but begging for more like a nympho at a gangbang.
