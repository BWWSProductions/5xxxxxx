,adminer,2009-08-07T00:46Z,I found a website  where you could decode swf 
,adminer,2009-08-07T00:46Z,its showmycode com
,deekdog,2009-08-07T02:54Z,"it doesn't decode swf
it manages it into a standalone file so you can access more features that you are not able to do through action script.

Like take the title on the top or access other files or no prokector boarder"
