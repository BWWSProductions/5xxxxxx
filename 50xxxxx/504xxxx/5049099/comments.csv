,xp3ri3nz,2009-08-09T20:46Z,"Stuck in the user login screen at the start of the game, it ask for you to login with username and password. I dont come pass it can sombody help me?"
,NasshX,2009-08-09T20:46Z,Hope this is good 
,xp3ri3nz,2009-08-09T20:52Z,What Username and Password should i use? If i press cancel the same message apairs when i push a button! Please login or your settings whont be saved blablabla
,themaster2k4,2009-08-09T21:03Z,use your gamespy account to login but even after this i carn`t connect to any of the servers iam using win 7
,xp3ri3nz,2009-08-09T21:06Z,I dont have an gamespy account but the login request comes when you are in the game at the begining right after the intro.
,themaster2k4,2009-08-09T21:17Z,yes i no like i said go and get a gamespy account or fileplanet account and put username and password in game but for me i see the servers and carn`t connect to any :(
,xp3ri3nz,2009-08-09T21:17Z,"Ok i got an Gamespy account but it looks like you only can play multiplayer, and you only can join games but the problem is that there is no serveres! This Relase is stupid you cant play singelplayer you cant host multiplayer with boots you cant to anything! Whats the point? This is youst waist of my time! FUCK"
,themaster2k4,2009-08-09T21:20Z,i can see the servers but i carn`t join them your write its a fucking waste of time any one else had any luck
,Ordeal,2009-08-09T21:59Z,"You guys are clearly either blind or retarded. It says right in the torrent name, [BETA]. The actual game hasn't even been released yet so stop acting up like freakin' idiots -.-"
,themaster2k4,2009-08-09T22:03Z,we no its beta the fact remains it doesn`t work and i am not a freakin idiot there is no need for that
,Vonzom,2009-08-10T06:28Z,"My guess is that this build of the beta may outdated and, as such, it won't let us connect to whatever matches are being held by their beta testers.

Now, perhaps somewhere in the game files (maybe the config files) we can change a variable and enable ourselves to host games."
,Vonzom,2009-08-10T07:08Z,"So far I haven't had any luck finding a way to enable hosting, if anyone else figures it out, let us know. With hosting enabled we could just use hamachi."
,333def,2009-08-10T07:08Z,"maybe host on game ranger?  would you need to have a server to link thru to do this?  i usally don't play online (even tho a lot of even single player cracks still require sign up, so i have like 6 or 7 accounts)"
,Vonzom,2009-08-10T07:21Z,"It's all the same to me how/where we host, but we need to figure out if there is a way to enable the host option in-game. I tried launching a server using command-line but apparently that isn't possible with this release."

,deuse,2009-08-10T16:24Z,"Did anyone notice that when you first install the size is 3.gig
after the updates it 2gig so it looks like single player is out and you have to get a key for online
and it looks like the key that comes with it has gone or black listed..
"
,call_me_nobody,2009-08-10T19:01Z,"what the hell was the point of uploading this crap when u cant fucking play either online or singleplayer? was it just for to watch the menu ????

[T],gamerguuy,2009-08-10T20:57Z,don't you guys get it? it's a beta test which means that the game isn't fully made.ok

,reality66,2009-08-12T16:47Z,Is this game about wetbacks who live off of Section 8?
,ShineEyes,2009-08-13T04:13Z,"http://www.joystiq.com/2009/08/12/section-8-open-beta-is-go/

There you go, everybody.  The beta is open and free to join.  No more need for the torrent, or your bitching. :D"
,tibrusjer,2009-08-13T05:39Z,"Want to join the BETA?
visit fileplanet(dot)com

Section 8 has an open BETA."
,equazcion,2009-08-13T20:29Z,"I think the bitching is pretty legitimate. I think everyone realizes it's a beta, but if someone uploads a beta we generally expect it to be playable in some way. Otherwise what's the point?

Good to know that the beta is open now though, so there's no need for this torrent. I apreciate gamerguuy's effort, but this should probably be deleted now that it's useless, so people don't waste their time and bandwidth."
,Krzysd,2009-08-14T02:37Z,anyone know how to change cd-keys with out uninstalling this version?
,equazcion,2009-08-15T20:43Z,"Of course if you're more concerned with the personal glory of having a torrent in the top-100, and don't care about sacrificing people's time, then I suppose it's a moot suggestion."
,AeroAsasin,2009-08-16T23:48Z,"is that demo??
what about LIVE??"
,Xthlon,2009-08-19T08:45Z,lames torrent ever... and it made it in top 100?.... sad...

,dR435t4,2009-08-24T02:08Z,"you can download directly if you want, but itll take a while cuz you have to wait in a ""server line"".... but its 2.1GB not freakin 3.6GB wtf is wrong wit this torrent????"
