,Snowptrl,2009-12-23T01:23Z,"Thanks for uploading guys, i used to play this game at a friend's house when i was about 10 years old:) i loved to watch him playing while i didn't understand a thing:P
Now im 15 and finally getting the change to play it by myself.

It's a great download: everything works(including the cracks and disks). I have mounted everything with PowerISO."
,Emperawr,2010-03-04T03:06Z,Couldnt mount the mdf files in magiciso on windows 7 for some reason. Dont know why but just be warned.
,lasrever,2010-03-29T19:56Z,"using MagicISO to open the .mdf file and it says ""fail to mount""

when i try to mount the disk in Alcohol it says file not accessible."
,fishcorn,2010-04-13T02:28Z,"Okay, I figured out how to install this for anyone who's wondering. MagicDisk and Alcohol can't mount MDF's, so you'll have to use MagicISO to extract the contents of the MDF's to a folder and install from there. Just follow this guide:

http://www.yasasoft.com/press_release/open_mdf_file.htm

Then after installation replace the executables with the cracked versions just like the readme says."
,joyfer,2010-07-04T18:32Z,When i try to install the game it asks for a second CD. What can i do to solve this problem?
,adptnz,2010-08-21T00:54Z,"thx bro

runs fine
"
,adptnz,2010-08-21T00:57Z,"@joyfer

when it ask for the other cd just mount them using daemon tools or powerISO and it should continue installing"
,backhousemc,2010-09-27T03:27Z,Work Online? :o
,Rumikosan,2010-10-09T09:01Z,"I've mounted the files with MagicISO to a private folder, and I installed the game without having the need of ""insert Disk 2"" or 3. Anyhow, In chapter 3 (i think) When you are about to enter the wintertown and passing the big gate to town, the game errors out as there as missing a resource; Dungeonsiege/Resources/Objects.dsres (something about farmgirl that corrupts the game.) Can someone tell me what of the many thousand dsres opening/Activation programs to use to fingure out about the problem?"
,evilfox10,2010-10-21T05:29Z,"Hi, um is this part 1 and expansion or just the expansion, sence im trying to find the regular first dungeon siege sence i havent beaten it in a long time ago, and the expansion plus dungeon siege 2 is the whole new thing and i checked it out and it has way too much detail and different a lil bit, anyways is this regular and expansion?"
,silverorange,2011-02-04T22:16Z,"Alright I need help because the readme is one fucking sentence and that doesn't cut it.
I have extracted the CDs to an external hard drive F.  I'm clicking setup to start the installation and it gets 28% done and says ""insert disk 2 into drive F.""  Daemon tools AND PowerIso are only letting me mount shit to their new drive G.  And am I'm supposed to be doing this BEFORE I replace the executables with the cracked versions right?  I am a man obsessed so if anyone can help seriously PLEEAAASSE."
,silverorange,2011-02-05T02:24Z,"Ok nevermind I got it figured out.  Instead of extracting any of the original ISO files (the ones with the CD or lightning bolt icon depending on whether you have daemon tools or poweriso as your primary) use daemon tools to mount CD 1 (by right clicking on the lower right icon and selecting virtual devices).  Installation will start, choose where.  Then mount the other CDs as the prompt asks for them until it's installed.  After it's installed, create a backup folder for the original .exe files, and replace them with the cracked ones.  Hopefully this comment will help anyone as unfamiliar with CD-drive emulators as I was going into this."
,xxAvengedxx7Foldxx,2011-02-11T20:37Z,"@xxThugxx:

Couple things you may want to check, using avira and it detected that the DSLOA is a possible threat, i know this is common with game cracks but you might want to double/triple check it, also while using utorrent the download failed at about 50%, trying with bitlord now considering i have had more then one problem with utorrent, will leave a comment if it does again that way you can look into it."
,xxAvengedxx7Foldxx,2011-02-11T21:31Z,"@xxThugxx:

OK so DSLOA is still a problem, you are gonna have to replace it, it is a threat, but the torrent screwing up was utorrents fault, great DL speed 500 KBS minimum : )"
,boogoo,2011-02-13T00:09Z,"Ok guys I am downloading it now and then will mount it with PowerISO and see how I go. I doubt this torrent is dirty with a virus so please try scanning it with Kaspersky and not your one (the person who commented above me).

This is Dungeon Siege 1 + the expansion (to answer the comment asking if it is from above). Click the Files button to see the things you're downloading and this proves you also get the game because of the CDs and file sizes.

Finally, The whole game should run fine because it was uploaded in 2009 and no one has had game play issues (so just disregard Rumikosan).

And yeah, if we have the game being played successfully then that means we can also go online. There would be nothing really stopping us. Even if we all share the same keys it will allow us. We aren't tied down to only one PC being able to go online :)"
,boogoo,2011-02-15T10:47Z,"Yep, all is well. The game works fine. When you install it you get the original or the expansion to choose from. I am playing the originally game but via the expansion because of more spells etc etc (but even though I just started I noticed we have Giant Rat summon instead of Gremal...oh well, at least the DSLOA interface is much better!)"
,Sevenfoldfreak,2011-05-22T05:36Z,I have installed the game and it starts up but its stuck in a weird distorted resolution and I dont know how to fix it. I have tried a couple different mounting software for it but still no luck any help would be much appreciated.
,bigowens125,2011-06-08T22:29Z,"ok how do i move the ""two no-cd cracks to the install directory and replace
the originals"" I'm still kinda new to the torrent scene"
,Ultrakonkret,2011-06-16T05:40Z,is it multilanguage???
,ifartedandshatmyslef,2011-06-29T13:39Z,i shall dl and seed and i suggest using a bit torrent  called vuze its fast i was using utorrent then i switched to vuze and there was a big difference
,OscarAlhoII,2011-07-11T22:41Z,"It's not compatible with win7x64
suck"
,eberry3290,2011-08-10T18:28Z,Have you tried changing the runtime configuration in the properties? I have had to do that with some older games on my win7x64. You can set it to run like its xp or older.
,fcukpaying,2011-09-07T18:56Z,"ok heres how i done it:

1.obviously download all parts of the torrent
2.make sure you have daemon tools 
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite
3.find where your torrents have downloaded 
(go onto utorrent right click on the dungeon siege torrent then click open containing folder) there should be one folder named disks open it then if disk1.mdf is the symbol of daemon tools double click it and installation will begin otherwise select it manually through daemon tools
4.when it says please insert disk 2 go onto the disks folder then double click disk 2 or manually mount it  same again for disk 3 do this for all disks
5.the game should work fine if you try to play it but if you want to use the no-cd crack go onto crack folder leave it open then go onto program files>microsoft games> dungeon siege then drag the DSLOA.exe from the crack folder into this folder it will ask you if you want to overwrite select yes. from there on you should b able to play dungeon siege ledgends of arrana without the disk "

,Xantex82,2012-04-28T22:15Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE DSLOA.exe CRACK!

The file has a nasty trojan in it, I had to run a few registery checks and systems analysis in order to isolate it.
"
,Hansen_LaMoose,2012-05-18T04:16Z,"@Xantex82

You're fucking kidding right? xxThugxx is a trusted uploader, so why would his crack be a virus? AV's ALWAYS think cracks are a virus because they bypass stuff in the registry that they're not meant to. Get out with your retarded shit"
