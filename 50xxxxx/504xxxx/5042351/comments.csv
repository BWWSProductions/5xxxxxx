Thanks for the effort though."
,voltsin,2009-12-09T22:51Z,"I can say exactly the same thing I said about the first movie.

Video quality isn't that great, especially given that the file is almost 900MB & video is encoded at 958KBps.

Also, the person who encoded this did not crop the black bars from the top/bottom. Get this only if you're desperate to watch this movie.

Note that I haven't watched this copy yet so can't comment any further. "
,voltsin,2009-12-09T23:01Z,"Oh yeah, & the video is actually encoded at 640x480.

So while the movie itself, taking into account the letterbox, is the correct AR - you may find that some players will automatically stretch the image, so you'll have to play around with settings - no big deal really, but just mentioning it.

Any of these things can be fixed if you use AVISynth."
,voltsin,2010-01-24T10:29Z,"There was one other thing I forgot to mention.  The rips haven't been deinterlaced either.  There are several scenes I noticed while flicking through, but one example is around the 1m40s action sequence, interlace lines are clearly noticeable.  I tried to deinterlace using AVISynth but the results were ugly at best."
,voltsin,2010-01-24T10:34Z,Bah I had both YGI & YGII pages open & mistakenly commented in the wrong one.  My comment above is directed at YGI...
