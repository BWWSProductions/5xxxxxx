,flip69,2009-08-06T06:51Z,Webroot which I trust gave a lot of malware trojan warnings when I ran this from a thumb drive. It seemed to work but all the warnings upon running the program? Anyone else have comments?
,Andreychru,2009-08-06T11:43Z,so that it does not look so everything is working correctly

How does one install this???  Please provide installation instructions.

I have extracted it and replaced existing files as there are some files that are the same in the last 5 RARs.  I then also tried it WITHOUT replacing the similar files, but I get the same problem.  It starts and tries to install new files via the net, and during the new file install the whole program shuts down.

Am I doing something wrong?  Please advise."
,toja92,2009-09-08T21:38Z,"No warnings from ESET Smart Security, however, all programs start but hangs during splash screen stating too low RAM / too little disk space left. Win XP SP3, Office 2007 installed already. Too bad, the splash screen promisied a lot regarding the look of the rest of the programs :P"
,snuupy,2009-09-10T22:23Z,"hmmm.....it closes right after ""install""...><

DAMN."
,yoedz,2009-09-25T20:49Z,same like snuupy....
,Veligekas,2010-03-19T02:15Z,"Sanpork, anyone,

How do we get this thing to WORK?  I can't get it to work on my PC when I unzip all the folders and extract to a folder.  So how can we get it to work PORTABLE???  What do we have to do to install/burn it onto a DVD to make it work???

Can anyone please provide PROPER instructions?   I can't understand we there are NO instructions provided ON the download itself.

Any help by anyone would be appreciate.

Thanks."

Which build and version is this release? Could you please mention? Is it RTM? is it x86 or x64? Is it Vol Edition? Can it be activated using Mini KMS activator?"
,theofanis,2010-07-14T16:44Z,does this one include MS access???
,sijie123,2010-09-06T08:52Z,"OMG! This is awesome.
Thanks so much Sanpork!"
,sijie123,2010-09-06T09:05Z,sorry about my comment just now. It does not work now on my computer.
,cyop,2011-03-24T21:43Z,"File scanned, no virus.  Ran word/excel and trojan was created in \stubs\ folder.

This file is then run when the install launches within word/excel.

I tried installing this on a work laptop that has tight security...

File in question:  \OSPPSVC.EXE.870a68.tmp

Either way the applications close when the install fails to run."
,jimmyirish,2011-07-16T02:49Z,"Ive got trojans and shizz all over the place, any way to remove them without ruining the software?"
,Jasper77,2011-11-17T15:13Z,Doesn't work under Win7 + virus. don't bother.
