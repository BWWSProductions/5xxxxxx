Hold Me Tight, Let Me Go
Premiere Date: July 28, 2009

For the 40 children who call the Mulberry Bush School in Oxford, England home at any one time, the school offers possibly their last chance at a normal life. The kids boarding at Mulberry are not brain-damaged, and many are very bright. Yet their extreme behavioral problems â€” often caused by emotional trauma and including violent outbursts, agitation and verbal abuse â€” have gotten them excluded from other schools and institutions and made their familiesâ€™ lives intolerable. 

Variety describes it as a film "mixing ferocity with tenderness, delicacy with tenacity" â€” exactly like the unusual school it explores. In Hold Me Tight, Let Me Go, one of Britain's leading documentary filmmakers takes a vÃ©ritÃ© look at Oxford's Mulberry Bush School for emotionally disturbed children. Mulberry's heroically forbearing staff greets extreme, sometimes violent behavior with only consolation and gentle restraint. Kim Longinotto's unblinking camera captures an arduous process and a nearly unhinged environment, but it also records the daily dramas of troubled kids trying to survive and the moments of hope they achieve with Mulberry's clear-eyed staff.
