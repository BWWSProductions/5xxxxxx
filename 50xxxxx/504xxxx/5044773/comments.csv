,claude31,2009-08-13T12:14Z,"Is Windows multi-language ? I need french release.
Thanks."
,REDAXIUM,2009-08-14T17:00Z,this one is english only xp mce or vista ultimate are multi-language without installing third party software to alter the os
,PCKitty,2009-08-19T13:18Z,"REDAXIUM, when you list this torrent as ""Corp"", it should not require a product key.  Corporate is synonymous with VLK (Volume License Key).   "
,REDAXIUM,2009-08-19T15:08Z,"FYI (PCKitty) corp does need a key most copies on the internet have the code added to the winnt.sif file for an unattended install. this one has no alterations so you need to enter the code manualy
also the term vlk(volume licience key) would imply that there is a volume key used! ie one key for a large volume of xp installations. corporate versions of windows xp still use a product key but dont ask for activation"
,falconeye001,2009-08-20T15:55Z,"Worked great with me

I provided a CD key during installation and no activition required ( yes i can download updates :) )

just a clean install of win xp sp3

thank you REDAXIUM"
,falconeye001,2009-08-20T15:56Z,"By the way !

it is Corp edition"
,REDAXIUM,2009-08-20T17:32Z,Thanks falconeye001
,Quilvio,2009-08-20T19:29Z,"But Where is the Serial Key?
I start installing it, but ask me for the key.
What Can I do?"
,REDAXIUM,2009-08-20T21:34Z,you will need to use your own CD Key if you have one
,Zippo179,2009-09-05T04:43Z,"Awesome work, thanks for putting this up, Redaxium - it's nice to have a clean install disc that I don't have to muck around with Service Packs for"
,asdhokker,2009-10-01T19:08Z,"whats the difference with this?
