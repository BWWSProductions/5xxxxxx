The piratebay sale is not going through however a Dutch court
has ordered the site be shut down (to Dutch access) by August 9th.
With the legal battles and jailtime being faced, it's unclear 
whether the founders will continue to fight and move the servers 
or if the site will shut down. Assume the worst and prepare now:

BOOKMARK THIS IMMEDIATELY so you can get O&A past August 9th....

Another heads up: I'll be back on the later schedule for this 
week only. That means 64k's up between 12 - 1:30 est, and 128k's 
up around 7ish. Sorry for any issues that causes but it is 
what it is. Should be the last of it for awhile.
