Violinist Zina Schiff has been described by the New York Times as an instrumentalist of "Luscious high voltage...vintage Heifetz." The comparison to the legendary Heifetz is apt, as Zina is a Heifetz protege. With her special blend of passion, poetry and communicative power, she has dazzled audiences throughout North Ameria, Eastern and Western Europe, Israel, and Australia.

Dalia Atlas was born in Israel, graduated from the Music Academy of Jerusalem, and studied conducting with the most distinguished teachers abroad. She won seven prizes in international conducting competitions, the first woman conductor to achieve this. Her wide repertoire includes about 750 scores, among them hitherto unknown music, some of which are her own discoveries, and also arrangements of her own.

She has conducted some seventy orchestras in concerts, festivals and recordings, and broadcasts in 29 countries, among them the Israel Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Philharmonia in London, Helsinki Philharmonic, ABC orchestras in Australia, Warsaw Symphony, Brazil Symphony, Buenos Aires Philharmonic, Maggio Musicale in Florence, the Slovak Philharmonic and the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra, Czech Radio Orchestra, and the Berlin Symphony Orchestra. In Israel she has founded many musical and cultural organizations, orchestras and choirs, both professional and educational, serving as Music Director and Principal Conductor for many years.

In pursuit of her philanthropic ideals, Dalia Atlas has travelled widely with her orchestras, the Israel Pro Musica and Atlas Camerata, at her own expense, in order to promote music education for children in schools and concert halls. Her research on the music of Ernest Bloch resulted in her undertaking the promotion and recording of the composerâ€™s neglected compositions. To date, she has recorded about 20 of his orchestral works for ASV and Naxos.

In 2005 Dalia Atlas decided to terminate all her permanent positions in order to share her wide repertoire and experience as a guest conductor all over the world with orchestras, operas and festivals.
