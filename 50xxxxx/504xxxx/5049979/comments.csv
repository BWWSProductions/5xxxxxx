,Orkem,2009-08-12T19:36Z,Does anyone else have graphic issues with this ?
,sniderjinx,2009-08-12T19:53Z,I do. When I get past the main menu it crashes and wont let me play the actual game
,Hrorlf,2009-08-12T21:55Z,"Anti aliasing is bugged, just disable it to play ;)"
,mikd,2009-08-13T02:02Z,"anti aliasing is turned off, and it's still not working, anyone know why?"
,fleetkid,2009-08-13T09:13Z,"Works perfectly. Nice game for 280 Mb.
But hell it is difficult. Even the tutorial is tough to finish."
,Lliam,2009-08-14T15:30Z,"Anti-aliasing works fine with me, and overall game works like a charm = b..

Fleetkid@
The tutorial wasn't that hard  = b "
,Lliam,2009-08-14T15:32Z,"Mikd@ 
Maybe you need to upgrade your system ;S"
,fleetkid,2009-08-15T17:18Z,"@Lliam
ya just got the hang of it.
half way through in quest mode :)
it would have been great if thr was a story line"
,sexy_bitch7412,2009-08-16T06:30Z,Damn.. aftr the main menu if i select anything the game crashes
,defaulto,2009-09-04T10:47Z,is it just me or doea it really need 7 exes to install
,anthony073,2009-09-05T20:40Z,dont download this game is crap
,hercthemerc,2009-09-07T01:21Z,"Don't download, not cause torrent is bad, but cause game is the worst game ever.


Not cause it's graphics are dated, or that your playing overhead, it's cause it's TOO DAMN HARD, AND IT'S MOVEMENT SUX
you get raped for an hour minimum before you advance to next missions, and your movement is so slow even the clot from Killing Floor could catch you."
,loongear,2009-09-09T05:42Z,"I will have to agree with hercthemerc. The game is too damn hard and your movement is too damn slow. It is obviously the zombie shooter version of Third Soldier but this game does not even 1% of the balance in Third Soldier.
I have no problems with the torrent but this game sucks."
,pwned131,2009-09-10T17:43Z,Upload the damn patched version with fixed movement speed.
,paio666,2009-09-13T16:39Z,im pretty sure this is like the pre-release or sumthing
,gotthelife,2009-09-15T22:03Z,nice game. btw this game is full.
,hadtoregistertopost,2009-09-16T00:58Z,"Works like a dream.
All full + antialiasing too, no probs.
the ones having prob with anti aliasing, prob have simply too crappy gfx card :)
How is this supposed to be hard, i dont get :D
Like walk in the park even eyes tied shut :)
Just the fact that you need to zoom out every time at start, is crap.
Otherwise fun game at least if u got spare time and nothing to do.
Thanks for the ul."
,T1taN_KakaN,2009-09-19T12:41Z,it's maybe your grafik-card :P
,Lellenadde,2009-11-04T16:11Z,"I can't get it to work, I don't even get past the installation... It says ""Error 1327.Invalid Drive: H:\"" and the installer ends. All I've ever had as H is my external HDD. Does anyone know why this happens?"
,Tzalix,2010-04-26T18:52Z,"Is this supposed to be the full or demo version? Because I can only play the demo stuff. How do I fix it so I can play the full version stuff?

And also, if you think this game is so dam hard, you gotta suck reaaally hard... It's a chill game:P"
,AFSSMOW,2010-06-06T19:16Z,"works fine ,thanks 2 the uploader "
,PikeyBoo,2011-03-07T03:03Z,Another great torrent from extremezone. No faults or problems at all. Thanks!
,filrookie,2011-03-14T17:43Z,works perfectly with 2 gb  RAM and thank you!
,MASTuR94,2011-03-17T19:10Z,"i start the game and not only doesnt it crashes it reboots my whole system ?!?!?! 
it doesnt tell me anything "
,TheFelikZ,2011-04-07T12:58Z,Worst install exe ever....
,Alenthas,2011-05-13T13:15Z,I saw this game on TotalBiscuit and he had really fun with it. If you're having problems with speed you either suck or its some problem about cracked version. So get your story straight people.
,Alzitar,2011-06-02T13:54Z,This game is to hard because: its just not updated to the newest version. I believe 1.8 is out now.. this one is 1.0? Thats why its to hard.. The updates change the difficulty and alot more.. only the demo version is already 350 MB atm. Cant seem to find a update though since its all on steam..
[T],Maverick2587,2011-06-03T15:59Z,Is this Game with COOP?
,16peela12,2011-06-09T11:19Z,Could u plz upload the latest patch. its really cool with more guns and even co-op
,jordanidk,2011-08-11T20:40Z,"You guys must just be terrible..

I completed this game in 1hr-1hr 30 and it wasn't difficult at all. The bosses are complete and utter failures who just stand there while you shoot them..

Try pressing E to roll if you don't already know, it's the only way to survive. Other than that great game, albeit short and in my opinion to easy.

Oh and no I don't play alot of zombie shooters. Mostly rpgs so I'm not particularly good at the genre either."
,SmokeTheChron,2012-01-13T21:22Z,"Maybe its just me, but I ran into some corrupt files while extracting and attempting to launch the .exe, I've done a manual hash check and tried compatibility mode, but to no avail. I'm not doubting this share because I trust extremezone 110% , I've gotten many shares from you and every last one has been excellent, virus free and installed quickly. not to mention ALWAYS work 100%. I'm deleting the task and redownloading now, hopefully this will help. I'm using win7ultimate64x with 4gb ddr2, plenty disk space and full admin privs. This game runs great on integrated hardware for the folks who are without a decent gfx unit."
,SmokeTheChron,2012-01-13T21:23Z,"^I got to test it on steam, but have no money to buy a copy, even the 2.50 it costs since its on sale now, but money is tight :("
,AddyTzu,2012-01-16T07:04Z,"@Alzitar http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6617094
this is the only updated version i found"
