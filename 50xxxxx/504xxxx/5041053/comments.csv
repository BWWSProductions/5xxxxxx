[V],2nafish,2009-08-04T11:00Z,I'm not really going back to MPG files. I'm just uploading MPG videos that were already done before I switched to Xvid.

[V],2nafish,2009-08-06T13:14Z,I made an XVID file and an MPEG file of a few videos and compared them and saw no difference in quality. The Twisted Sister video I uploaded was 119MG and it would have been over 200MG if it was an MPEG file so it's nice to have a smaller file.
