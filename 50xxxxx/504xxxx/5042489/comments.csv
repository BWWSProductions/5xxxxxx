,goldensun87,2009-08-05T11:22Z,"Hello, everyone at EZTV.  Could you guys please start using the correct episode numbers?  The 2 hour premiere was not really two episodes, it was actually one single two hour episode.  According to TV.com, this is episode 5, not 6."
,notenough,2009-08-05T12:30Z,"Historically when someone gets the episode numbering wrong it takes until well into the second season before it's corrected.

and for the record ive heard this show compared to other shows and in reality it's closest to errie indiana than anything else."
,goldensun87,2009-08-06T09:38Z,"@shaden666: Ban the poster!?  Are you serious!?  EZTV is one of the most popular TV torrent distribution groups here on TPB as well as several other torrent hosting sites.  Sure, it is up to us to point out valid mistakes, but show some respect, man."
,topdogdk,2009-08-07T13:03Z,"Look at the titles instead.
Last one was Claudia.
EZTV is usually ok."
