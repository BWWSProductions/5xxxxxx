Shy and awkward, 14-year-old Daniel Hobson (Sebastian Gregory) is  a quiet  boy living  on a  quiet street  in the  idyllic, picture-perfect suburb  of Sunshine  Hills. Viewing  his world through the lens of  an old camera, Daniel  is - like many  in the  neighbourhood  -  both  entranced  and disturbed  by the sinister  rumours that  circulate in  whispers from  house to house. A third teenage girl has just disappeared without a trace, and while the police  don't seem to  have any answers,  the locals all point to the derelict house at number 46, with the strange woman who stands at the front window from morning to night and the rumbling  black Ford  that creeps  up and  down the sleepy tree-lined streets once the sun goes down.
