Ego Is Dead - Dedicated To Eckhart Tolle

This is a song-cycle I assembled a few years ago after reading Eckhart Tolle's books "The Power Of Now", and "A New Earth".  

Some of the tracks have the intros/outros layered over each other as I thought it enhanced the flow of the music and facilitated enjoyment in the present moment.  Using Foobar, Replaygain Track Gain was applied to the tracks in conversion to MP3 and so the music data was altered to facilitate appropriate volume consideration from track to track.  This song-cycle should be burned "Disc At Once" to yield a seamless and gapless album.  Separate track numbering will still be available to access each song individually upon playback.  

Track-list is witheld to narrow the appeal of this song-cycle to reach individuals in the present moment, whom may appreciate the breathtaking beauty and diversity of love shining through these performances.  Music has always been my favorite portal to the present moment, where we all are, in the one life.
