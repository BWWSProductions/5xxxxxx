,da_maze,2009-08-12T02:04Z,"I did read numb nutz. 

My comment was in response to the first guy who said it was ""the best copy until now"" which seemed unlikely if the same shitty video source was used."

There's nothing wrong with the video files here on TPB. Your PC is not working well. I'm using WMP for 5 years and never had problems watching these movies. Before complaining with the video, or the sound, try to update your system with the latest audio/video codecs and you'll see the results. Try at least K-LITE MEGA CODEC PACK. It's free and very useful...After that you'll CRY no more, I'm sure of it. Grow up guys !!!!"
