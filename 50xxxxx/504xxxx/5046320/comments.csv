Or maybe about the lavish lifestyle the leaders of the peoples revolution live in?

I doubt it."

He killed many of his own people, and rape, is that not bad enough.  At least the revolutionary forces had morals, and would help the wounded of batista.  And those that were executed got what was coming to them.  so before you speak from your ass, pull your head out of it and do some research!"
