                  ManiacTools Audio CD Burner Studio v6.0 + Patch



Burn Audio CD from MP3, WMA, WAV easily!


Audio CD Burner Studio will help you to burn Audio CDs with professional quality, 
but without any complexity of professional software.

Audio CD Burner Studio opens a new dimension to Audio CD burning. This smart tool 
can create an Audio CD in a single click. Just insert an empty CD, drag and drop 
music files from Windows Explorer or add them manually and hit "Burn". Audio CD 
Burner Studio will take care of everything else: automatically processes your 
files, extracts information from MP3 and WMA tags, creates a proper Audio CD. 
Audio CD Burner Studio automatically reads necessary information from MP3 and WMA 
tags and writes it to the CD-Text field. Play newly created Audio CDs in your car 
audio or Hi-Fi system and get information about tracks on its display.

Behind this simplicity hides a full-featured professional burning engine that 
provides high quality and all necessary features. Audio CD Burner Studio supports 
all existing write methods and the full range of write speeds offered by your 
CD/DVD burner device.

Unlike many other tools that require some initial setup by the user, Audio CD 
Burner Studio is ready to work 'out of box'. Its intuitive interface supports many 
languages and automatically switches to the language of your system (but you can 
easily select any other language).

The program works properly with both CD-R and CD-RW (rewritable) media. If you 
have a CD-RW with some information that is no more needed, the program will prompt 
you to erase the CD-RW before writing new information.

Yet another nice feature of the program is the automated support for CD-Text.
Initially the Audio CD format didn't support any textual information, and all 
tracks were displayed like the following: 'track 01', 'track 02' etc. This didn't 
tell much about particular songs, so later a small field was added to the format. 
This field called CD-Text contains description of all tracks on the CD, which 
includes information about artist, titles, album, and so on. Many software and 
hardware players are capable of reading this field and displaying relevant 
information while playing tracks.

Full CD-Text support allows you saving information like title, artist, album etc. 
to the Audio CD. This information will be displayed by your player (if it supports
CD-Text), making it easier to recognize individual tracks and providing better 
experience. The program automatically extracts this information from ID3 tags of 
MP3 files and from WMA tags and burns it with audio tracks. Insert your Audio CD 
into your car audio or into your Hi-Fi system and get full titles instead of usual
'Track 01', 'Track 02'... on the display!
 
The built-in player will help you recognize individual songs when creating a 
compilation. Tracks can be sorted or rearranged in the list manually by using 
"Up" and "Down" buttons.

Audio CD Burner Studio is equally good both for inexperienced users and for 
professionals that don't like wasting time on setups and wizards. Try it to get 
convinced! 

Burn your Audio CDs with style and comfort! Making Audio CDs was never so simple!

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of 
    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting 
    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz
    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!
  
08- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

10- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by 
   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!

To the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
