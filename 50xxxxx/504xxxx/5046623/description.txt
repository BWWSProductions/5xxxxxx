Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber

My take: One of a seeming slew of over-the-top chick flicks that portray a woman as insanely fashion-obsessed and preoccupied with social status (e.g. the similar but higher profile "Confessions of a Shopaholic"). It's a romp with Jennifer Love Hewitt as the titular sociopath, and she's a lot of fun to watch. I enjoy her in this type of role as she's quite believable as a self-involved socialite. The outfits women wear in these movies are crazy, but I like them.

Social satire based on the best-seller by Adele Lang humorously chronicles the life of Katya Livingston, a self-centered, obnoxious and conceited 28-year-old ad sales exec who won't let anything or anyone stand in her way in getting to the top of the San Francisco social ladder. When tax inspectors quesiton her claims Katya is forced to keep a financial diary and finds time to add details about her friends, enemies and lovers all from her unique point of view.
