The number 10 in english is pronounced as ten. adding an x it sounds like a thanx. You should know it as you too are using the SMS way of writing...

Speed Commander offers some useful and basic features not available in the native Total commander, like temporary file container, display folder size by default. I tried to offer suggestions in Total commander forum, but they all went ignored, as there are some out-dated plugins that you can append to achieve those functions in a sloppy way, or ""you should simply set up everything in your configuration file"". The problem is-- I'm a computer idiot and I don't plan to learn a lot more just to use one software.
I hope some competition will benefit us users."
