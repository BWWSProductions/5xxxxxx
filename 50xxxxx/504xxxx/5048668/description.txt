Mike Oldfield The Space Movie.  2 disc set taken from the test pressing of The Space Movie soundtrack which was originally scheduled to be released as a double album in 1979.  

Disc 1: The Orchestral Hergest Ridge (parts 1 and 2, live London 9.12.74), 
Ommadawn (remixed version parts 1 and 2), 
John F. Kennedy speech, 

Disc 2: The Orchestral Tubular Bells (parts 1 and 2 live, London 9.12.74), 
Incantations (parts 1 -- 4, remixed version).


I think, where it says remixed version, it means, official cut version, and I think this differs
from the rare versions featured in the films.
