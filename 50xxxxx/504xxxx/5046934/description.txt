The Very Best Of (As Ugly As It Gets) - Ugly Kid Joe [1998]
	



This Best Of only features songs from the first mini-album and from the two first albums. No tracks from the last one "Motel California" who is self-released. The record company could not include tracks from the album without Ugly Kid Joeâ€™s permission, which They didn't get. 
A Best Of-release cannot show how a band have matured and changed if it doesn't contain tracks from the start to the end. 
This collection includes the hits and most of their best work, and is therefore a great introduction to the group, and a fairly good insight to their career.
