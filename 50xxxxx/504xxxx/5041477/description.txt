Synopsis :
That one morning walk in Joymohanâ€™s life changes it allâ€¦ Suffering a heart-attack one morning, on his birthday, Joymohan (Anupam Kher) realizes that he needs to spend more time with his family - son (Rajit Kapoor), daughter-in-law (Divya Dutta) and grand-daughter (Avika Gor)â€¦ and mend broken bridges of the past. It is during his â€˜Morning Walkâ€™ that his life changes forever. He meets his once-upon-a-time-student and friend Neelima (Sharmila Tagore), now a mother of two, who carries with her a strange but surreal truth. Neelimaâ€™s bright and beautiful daughter, Anjali (Nargis), dreams of pursuing her doctorate in the USA, and is encouraged by her doting mother and boyfriend Ajay (Shayan Munshi), an upcoming singer who will go to any lengths to put a smile on her face. A beautiful and heart-tugging tale of two families who are so different from one another, yet connected through a special bond.
