In a 1976 pornographic take-off of Pygmalion, the film is about a sexologist who tries transforming a prostitute into a goddess of passion. While he tries to prepare her to seduce a homosexual artist, it is he for whom she develops feelings.

In this film, Henry Higgins is replaced by Dr. Seymour Love, the sexologist, played by Jamie Gillis. Eliza Doolittle becomes Dolores 'Misty' Beethoven, who is played by Constance Money, and Colonel Pickering becomes Geraldine Rich, played by Jacqueline Beudant. During the film, Beethoven achieves 'elevation' better than Love and Rich had hoped but then cuts them off, as in George Bernard Shaw's play. However, this film then follows the common divergence from Shaw's plot when she returns to Love at the end.
