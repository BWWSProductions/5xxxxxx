,medthief,2011-11-09T02:10Z,The unrated version is absolutely the only way to go with this and almost any movie. Cannot wait to see this again and will put a true a/v rating up because if this is a dvd rip theres no way sgtmactavish is right on his rankings

Movie: 5 - if you want an uproariously, (very) adult holiday flick, watch Ted Demme's 1994 ""The Ref"" with Judy Davis, Kevin Spacey and Dennis Leary.  You will have to stop the movie several times to recover from laughing.  (And watch out for that cat spray!)"
