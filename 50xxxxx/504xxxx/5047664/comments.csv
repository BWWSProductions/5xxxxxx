[T],dexto,2009-08-09T12:00Z,"the format is a .mp4

I'd rather like a .avi.."
,IG3N1987,2009-08-09T23:11Z,"@dexto - secret_myth specializes in H264 video / AAC audio inside an MP4 file which is compatible with the ps3 and xbox consoles. 

If your looking for an AVI there are other versions available. But this mixture of formats/codecs is the future of media, avi / xvid are well outdated in my opinion."

really Sharp Quality video for an R5.....
definitely better than ""maxspeed"" rip....dunno why its in top right now for this movie since maxspeed quality is lower than SecretMyth quality....maxspeed even mislabeled it as a 'DVDRIP'!!!!
