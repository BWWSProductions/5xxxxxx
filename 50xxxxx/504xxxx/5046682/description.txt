Description

I watched that movie in Italian and I hardly could ask for the way

in that language. So I more or less had to guess the plot albeit it

was not too much of an effort given the complexity of it ;)

17 years old female (Nastassja Kinski) falls in love with a 50 years

old who could be her father. Eventually he turns out to indeed be her

father. To me the all time most graceful and beautiful (insert all other

thinkable positive attributes appropriate for describing a goddess

here) picture of a female appearance was in that scene when he was

watering some plants in his house and then she came in smilingly saying

Ciao.
