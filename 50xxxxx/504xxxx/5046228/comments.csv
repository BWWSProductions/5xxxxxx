,jcbrodt,2009-08-07T16:04Z,"R5 is region 5 (Russia). What it simple means that the release is close to dvdrip, but it's not a dvd. This was an attempt of the industry to stop piracy copies, with poor audio/video souces, but with professional filters the groups have been able to work around this. Anyway, for more info look into google. Greetings from Brasil. "
