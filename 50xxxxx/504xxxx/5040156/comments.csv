,Icetuborg,2009-08-06T22:14Z,Nogle som har denne til en Blaupunkt 35E navigation. Altså E udgaven og ikke DX
,Fysle,2009-08-10T10:49Z,"Hi

I tried to burn this image with clone cd in both ""Game mode"" and ""protected game mode"" with Verbatim CDR- disc, but the car doesnt recognice it. Anyone who have got tips how to do it? I got problems with the elder torrent here (Teleatlas 2004 scandinavia), but made it at last. So.. please, if anyone have succeeded burning this compilation, please tell me about all the details, disc-type..-cd-burner.. 

TY for the torrent anyway :)"
,topala,2009-08-14T21:32Z,"Nice, thanks. Works fine with VAG MFD2"
,orvar58,2009-08-18T21:53Z,"Thanks
Funkar perfekt på DX-R70"
,closeup536abc,2009-08-29T21:03Z,"Hej, 1000-tack för uploaden. Jag har försökt bränna Teleatlas Scandinavia 2007/2008 många gånger utan att lyckats. Jag har testat olika bränningsprogram, olika datorer, olika brännare och självklart också olika media.

Var hittar jag ett program + brännare som fortfarande går att bränna med 1X hastighet?"
,tuffetorsten,2009-09-01T15:57Z,"Okey guys, I will try to write a bit more resourceful tutorial on how to burn this Navigation CD than the original uploader.

1. Unpack your .rar files.
2. You should now have 4 Tele Atlas DX Skandinavien 2009 2010 files in your folder with different file endings.
3. Download the program ""Clone CD"". You can either take a trial from their homepage http://www.slysoft.com/sv/download.html or download a cracked version here from thepiratebay. You will need this program and nothing else to burn this program!
4. (And this is where I spent a long time failing) In your downloaded folder there is a subfolder called ""Substance"" with a file called ""Teleatlas.ccp"". Copy this file and find your install path for Clone CD. In your Clone CD folder there is a subfolder called ""Profiles"", put your Teleatlas.ccp file in here.
5. Start Clone CD and choose ""Burn from Imagefile"".
6. Locate ""Tele Atlas DX Skandinavien 2009 2010.ccd"" which is located in the folder you unpacked into. Choose that file and click ""next""
7. Now you have another option here called ""Teleatlas"", choose that and burn in 1x speed.

Finished, you now have a new navigation for your car.
However the first three copies i burned failed, one crashed at 97% burned. The two others just stalled at ""Navigation being loaded"" when i put them into my car(MB CLK -00).
I then changed from Verbatim cd's into ""Sony CD-R audio"" and now it works perfectly.

Good luck and thank me if I helped someone."
,tcbman,2009-09-03T00:56Z,"Thanks alot TuffeTorsten, now I have atleast manage to burn the CD, hope it will work ! :-)"
,kelpguze,2009-09-07T16:07Z,"THank you Tuffetorsten!!!!
Works like a charm on Audi a6 2006"
,kveito,2009-09-24T00:55Z,"I can't find a ""Tele Atlas DX Skandinavien 2009 2010.ccd"" file in the archive. 
Just ""Tele Atlas DX Skandinavien 2009 2010.img"" and ""Tele Atlas DX Skandinavien 2009 2010.sub""

Is there something I'm not getting?

cheers"
,teralv,2009-10-30T20:26Z,Porn links in this torrent
,teralv,2009-10-31T10:08Z,"Porn links that were attached had no influence on the result. This was only html files.

Do as tuffetorsten says, and you get a perfect result."
,sv1ds1,2010-01-02T21:44Z,Hey. Kan someone help me. I need this program for an EX not DX. Some norwegian who can help me? please let me know. mariussv88@hotmail.com
,sv1ds1,2010-01-03T00:08Z,why do i get error. wrong format when i put the cd in the car?
,Poker,2010-02-11T22:40Z,"I have tried just about everything.
Can not get it to work. 
Tried all kinds of CD brands,
(around 20 cd trashed) Tried different computers, burners. 
Given up. Bought myself an origin disk.
Will UL here after making an IMAGE with a really good cd/dvd program, TOAST. I do not trust CCD. I think it is CCD that gives us all headache.
(MB Comand 2,0)"
,Ramp1,2010-04-29T23:33Z,"Works perfect as tuffetorsten explained. Used a TDK CD, and burned on a windows PC that I had to borrow, because I use Mac. *ashamed*"
,OlleBolle96,2010-06-24T19:50Z,"Thanks. 

I finally managed to make a fully functioning copy for my VW Passat 2002. Kodak Ultima 80 CD-R and a Medion PC at the speed of 8(!) did the trick."
,kornhuolio,2010-08-31T22:59Z,"MB w220 03 works perfectly! maxell cd-r.
Many thanks to tuffetorsten for explanation! Good job!"
,Mureka,2011-01-09T10:38Z,Burning according to the instructions and using Verbatim AZO CD-R worked fine for me. I failed with TDK CD-R however.
,kapper1980,2011-01-17T12:39Z,Please seed! Den her har jeg sgu kigget efter længe!! :-D
,Capo,2011-02-19T14:21Z,"Thanks for sharing!
Works perfectly in my friend Skoda Octavia -07

Burned just like tuffetorsten said. Downloaded CloneCD trial, copied profile to profile folder. Burned with 1x speed to TDK cd-r disc. Burned with Samsung SH-203B cd/dvd writer."
,TheMPG,2011-04-11T11:53Z,Works perfekt in my 2001 mercedes with comand dx. tuffetorsten's guide worked perfect!
,eml21,2011-12-19T20:07Z,"It worked like a charm! I drive a Audi A4 2002

But the roads aint updated by far.


Highways in Norway that were done in 2008-2010 aint there.. Guess im going over to TomTom again.."
,eml21,2011-12-19T20:13Z,"Funker drit bra! Kjører en Audi A4 2002

Men kartene er ikke oppdatert skikkelig:/
Store motorveier som var ferdige i 2008 - 2009 er ikke der.. Går vel over til TomTom igjen://"
