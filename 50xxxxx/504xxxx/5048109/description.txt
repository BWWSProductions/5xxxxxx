Songs and calls of 396 species in systematic order. 

Each CD contains 99 species indexed by track number only and not announced. Names given in latin.

Based on the species order in the Collins New Generation Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe, it covers regular breeding, wintering and migrant species.

Notes: I included txt files with the english names, but track names are latin only. 



Enjoy and Seed!!
