"When the Civil War ended in 1865, more than 4 million slaves were set free. By the late 1930's, 100,000 former slaves were still alive.

In the midst of the Great Depression, the Federal Writers Project hired journalists and writers to travel the country and record the memories of the last generation of African-Americans born into bondage.

Over 2,000 interviews were transcribed as spoken, in the vernacular of the time, to form a unique historical record - first-hand accounts of what it was to be a slave. The Library of Congress is home to most of these "Slave Narratives."

Narrated by Whoopi Goldberg and featuring dramatic readings by Angela Bassett, Don Cheadle, Ozzie David, Ruby Dee, Samuel L. Jackson, Oprah Winfrey and others. 
UNCHAINED MEMORIES: READINGS FROM THE SLAVE NARRATIVES breathes the voices of the living into these transcripts of the past, bringing to life the pain and suffering, the fear and yearning, the pride, the spirit and the deep resonating sadness of those who had been born into slavery."

Also contains a bonus clip with Fountain Hughes, the grandson of one of Thomas Jefferson's slaves.



The last 20 minutes of the main documentary are SLIGHTY unsynchronized. I just couldn't get it right when I fused them all together (three clips to begin with), however it is only very slightly and not enough to really get on your nerves, not even like half a second. perhaps 0,2 secs or so. I don't know. Since you mostly don't see people talk or so anyways, you don't notice it for most of the part.

I hope you all enjoy the clip. It is definitely a must-see! (despite the tiny unsynchronization. :) )
