,primalclaws1974,2009-08-14T23:38Z,"Nearing 3 times the upload size. I thank the 2 other seeders. Please, more of you help out with seeding! I don't see complete seasons of the Waltons much on TPB!"
,primalclaws1974,2009-08-26T04:59Z,"I am sorry I am bitching, but I am nearing 5 times the original files size for my upload contribution. I was hoping to stop seeding by now, but I never see more than a few seeders on this. Come on, people! I am dropping off this if I see 10 seeders."
,primalclaws1974,2009-09-03T00:07Z,"I dropped off a few days back, glad to see a few are keeping it alive. Getting a new conn around Sept 21, 2009, will seed some other seasons then"
