,xlabelmeadork,2011-01-04T02:14Z,"video is very nice, but so far--the first 3 episodes-- the audio volume is really messed up. first part of the show, audio is perfect, then it gets so quiet I have to turn up my volume to the max; all of a sudden, volume shoots up again and nearly blasts my ears out. okay download if you want to deal with the volume fluctuating.. "
