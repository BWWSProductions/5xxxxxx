I hope everyone is well.  This has very good picture and sound quality.  This is also the complete version. I am currently seeding this as much as I can.

Brilliant effort.

Thank You

I forgot to mention one other thing which is that it is in Urdu with optional English subtitles. These can be switched on or off on the VLC Player.
