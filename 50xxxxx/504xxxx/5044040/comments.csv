,.DeathCab,2009-08-07T16:54Z,"It's real, but sounds awful! No offense..
In 'You're not in on the joke' track, you actually hear MSN convo beeps; so it's like a recording through this person's speakers...how 90's.

Again, it's real, but you will not want to play it on anything better than Acer Laptop speakers.. sorry Ycar, it's just how it is."
,Ycarcomed,2009-08-08T00:41Z,"I'm really terribly sorry! I hadn't heard that, I must've just associated it with my computer's sounds when it played. I didn't rip this personally, it's the same leak from all the other torrents of it. I'll check to see if it's all of them or just mine."
,Ycarcomed,2009-08-08T00:53Z,"I just checked out 2 other torrents from different sites, both shared the msn tones. This was leaked by the through a stream, and so whoever had originally recorded it could have done it on accident."
,CobraDave,2009-08-08T23:05Z,"@.DeathCab go here to find a better version not a recorded version http://www.rlslog.net/cobra-starship-hot-mess-deluxe-edition-2009-tosk/

And no i am not a spammer im just letting people know that there are better versions of this cd elsewhere."
