,HailsHailey,2009-11-06T20:07Z,"Thanks Goldfish!
I will seed for a week or so.
I do have a question though. 
I am a noob, sorry.
Do i have to enter the serial in everytime I use it or did I do something wrong?"
,dmKata,2009-11-14T01:35Z,Thank you... All are works!
,selflove,2009-12-04T10:11Z,"The program acts as if it works, but when trying to create an ISO image file over 300 MB, I get a warning that the unlicensed version cannot create images over 300 MB.  Then when I exit the program and launch it again, it asks me to register."
,selflove,2009-12-04T10:57Z,"The first key has the problem, but I tried the second key and the program was able to create the image file."
,jaslop,2010-05-22T21:25Z,"Works Perfect, no problem. Best program for mounting or buring programs and files. Thank you very much Goldfish, keep up the good work."
,CODENAME_FORCE,2011-05-09T07:54Z,"Works flawlessly once you put in the second code. Much appreciated sir.
Seed on!"
