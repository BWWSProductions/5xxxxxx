[V],only1joe,2009-08-22T18:32Z,"ezquared - i am struggling with this one. My Come Away With Me cd is scratched. I had the songs uploaded at 320kbs but when i went to give the music a quick check at least 2 of the tracks were damaged.
Anyway i am on the look out for another cd either off my mates or in charity shops, should'nt cost me more than a EURO.

Sorry Dude....
