It received a physical release worldwide throughout November 2007, except for the United States where it received a limited release in November 6, 2007 and a full release in January 15, 2008. 
Greatest Hits has sold over 1.7 million copies worldwide.
The album features two new songs, one of which was released as a single: "Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)" and "Voodoo." Halliwell describes Headlines, the single, as a "big love song" and "a Spice Girl classic". Another group member, Melanie Chisholm in her 2008 appearance at Never Mind The Buzzcocks show announced, that "this song is not good at all." She was against the release of the song and claims it was just a move by the record company to market the album. 
The second new song is "Voodoo", with the former being released as a single in November 2007.

The CD was released in several different formats, including versions with bonus DVDs and CDs. The limited edition box-set includes the normal standard edition CD, a remix CD a karaoke CD and a DVD featuring music videos for their greatest hits, individual postcards of each Spice Girl, and a friendship bracelet bearing the words 'Spice Girls'.
