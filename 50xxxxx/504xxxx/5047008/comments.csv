Usually fixes 90% of the problems and makes it easy on me. If this doesn't fix it, usually I do a Windows Repair and if that doesn't do it, then a format and install is the last resort."
,starstorms488,2009-08-12T00:32Z,"Awesome upload Soldierx, this is a great utility to have. I am encountering some problems though, when i try to run it on my laptop all of the LASER scans fail and it says ""Error Parsing"" for the description of each scan (Kaspersky, Panda, etc). The only scan that works is A-squared, but even that seems odd, its been running for 2 hours now and is only at 1% In addition, it keeps saying in red letters ""CONSOLE HUNG: HIT ESCAPE OR SPACE"". Please advise, the virus scanners were the main reason i got this in the first place"
,starstorms488,2009-08-12T00:33Z,Forgot to add that it works just fine on my desktop computer. Both OS's are vista

Just a heads up!"
