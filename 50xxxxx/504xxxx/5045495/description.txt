An outlaw-turned-bounty hunter races to pay off a lingering debt

in order to avoid a grim date with the hangman's noose. Shortly after arriving

in the rough and tumble town of La Guijas, Nate (Jarrett LeMaster) takes

notice of imprisoned outlaw "The Sparkle Eyed Kid" (Michelle Acuna). The

bounty on the beautiful outlaw's head is just enough to cover Nate's

lingering debt, but in order to collect he'll have to break her out of jail

first. Desperate, Jim takes on the local law and one relentless posse in order

to take custody of "The Sparkle Eyed Kid" and collect the bounty that will save his neck.
