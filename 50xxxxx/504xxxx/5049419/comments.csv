,saridon25,2009-08-13T16:09Z,First one was good.I download this with 320kb/sec...what limited bandwidth ?
,saridon25,2009-08-13T17:41Z,Game it's working.Explosion of a grenade graphics it's bring you back in '90.Nice :) 
,HeftyBomb,2009-08-14T09:15Z,"Downloaded this, works great. Got to about 700kb/s to 900kb/s, and maintained between there. This is definitely a difficult game but is still fun if you got the patience. =). Good Torrent."
,equazcion,2009-08-14T23:30Z,"Game works, just mount, install, and copy the files from the SKIDROW folder into the install folder, overwrite all.

I didn't have the patience for this game though. There aren't too many in-game tips for beginners, and the ones that are there are hard to understand. You'd need to learn how to play by dying many times. Pretty frustrating."
,djani555,2009-11-07T13:59Z,don't download it  a error
,riku.ojala,2009-12-09T17:41Z,Where to get SKIDROW?

,azidtrip,2011-07-05T16:02Z,"I do normally never complain, but skidrow.exe wich is merely a informationfile about Skidrow contain a backdoor trojan if I should trust MSE. I could understand this if it was a trainer wich manipulates the memory. But a skidrow.exe is not supposed to behave like this. I never seen it before from Skidrow and you should check your sources extremezone. Else thanks for your other uploads wich usually works flawlessy. 

Details: Ursap!rts (Backdoor)

file:D:\SKIDROW\SKIDROW.exe
filelocalcopy:\\?\C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Microsoft Antimalware\LocalCopy\{29D08837-5432-458A-A2D1-72159B649436}-SKIDROW.exe

MSE failed to remove (I dont like this...). Gonna research it and report back."
,azidtrip,2011-07-05T16:07Z,"Ok. After reading a little on the web I found this http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Backdoor%3AWin32%2FUrsap!rts

It appears this is harmless and notifications from antivirus is the only symptoms. I still wonder why this is listed in the definitions (Maybe to sell more software?, lol). However no harm from this as I understand else than alert."
