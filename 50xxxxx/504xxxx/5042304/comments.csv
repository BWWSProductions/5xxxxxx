,buddog05,2009-08-06T01:01Z,"The Insanity Dvd's have a newer Copy Right Protection on it, Ive tried 6 different rippers including: HandBrake, CloneDVD2, DVDRipper, Xilisoft, and so on,
I also have used DVD 43 along side with it, as well as tried AnyDVD separate from DVD43

All it does is stop after a little bit and fails when Im trying to rip each dvd, If anyone could help me figure out how to rip it then I can possibly get it posted as well.
Thanks"
,yomanaj,2009-08-06T08:05Z,"I read this on another site:
the DVDs are protected by RipGuard from Macrovision. You need to disable autorun, because it automatically runs a program that hides in your system procesess (can't be closed via Windows Task Manager) that blocks de-protection programs like AnyDVD, DVDDecrypter. And then use a program like Magic DVD Ripper (I was able to rip it successfully with this program).

So according to them they where able to rip them in the above mentioned way. "
