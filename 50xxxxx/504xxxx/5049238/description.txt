Significant Other - Limp Bizkit [1999]
	



Amazon.Com - Florida-Bred Metal-Rappers Limp Bizkit Sold A Million-Plus Records Of Their Debut Largely On The Strength Of A George Michael Cover Song. But The Band Indeed Had "Faith" And The Group's Second Outing Proves That The Bizkit Have The Goods. Still, It Seems As If Boastful Frontman Fred Durst Is Loading The Band's Deck Again, This Time By Including Scads Of Guest Vocalists, Such As Stone Temple Pilots' Singer Scott Weiland, Method Man From Wu-Tang Clan, And Korn's Jonathan Davis. (In Fact, Korn Gave Limp Bizkit A Leg Up In The Industry.) But The 16 Diverse Yet Cohesive Tracks On Significant Other Don't Need Any Help. Not As Heavy As Their Mentors Korn--Or As They Are On Their Debut--Bizkit Give Everlast A Run For His Money On The Tuneful And Appealing "Rearranged." "Just Like This" Is Another Winning Hip-Hop And Rock Entry, While The Amusing And Memorable "Nookie" (As In "I Did It All For The Nookie") Has Self-Deprecating Lyrics Not Unlike The Offspring's "Self-Esteem." Bizkit Segues With Ease From Pleasing Rock And Hip-Hop Amalgam To Spooky Tool Territory On "Don't Go Off Wandering" To Moshable Moments In The Entreaty "Show Me What You Got." Significant Other May Be Hard To Categorize, But It's Easy To Like.
