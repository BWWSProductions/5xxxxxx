However im wondering if there is a subpack releases with this, and if it's coming to a bay near me??"
,RL269,2009-08-13T00:22Z,Skulls are awarded by the Bay based on # of uploads & positive downloader feedback ( the quality +/- at top)
,moshster,2009-08-13T11:18Z,Generations and Insurrection are not PS3 compatible.  Even if the profile is changed from 5.1 for 4.1.  also found that remuxing them using tsMuxer to have just the video and english audio tracks causes out of sync issues.
,tdawgx00,2009-08-14T03:00Z,"i cant wait to get these, what i dont get is how theres 74 seeders and i can only connect to 4 and get a 10.8kb download :("
,TobiasHUN,2009-08-14T19:54Z,big thnx ST rulez
,shodan_,2009-08-15T19:44Z,"To make them playable on PS3 reencode them with RipBot264.
Takes some time but you end up with much smaller mkv that plays without any problem.
Plus you can remove all those extra languages :)"

,JPeterson,2009-10-02T21:03Z,Are 1-6 blu ray? Is the it the scene releases from SiNNERS and FSiHD?
,truced_animal,2009-10-09T08:56Z,I tried to download but it seems as if transmission cant handle such a big torrent :-(
,Jigure,2009-10-12T21:24Z,Insurrection and Nemesis aren't in english. The rest seem fine however.
,Jigure,2009-10-13T01:11Z,"disregard, the last two movies come with Hungarian and English tracks encoded into them...if using VLC just go into audio tracks and select the one you want."
,M0e09,2010-05-10T22:34Z,"Thanks a lot for the collection!
Unfortunately the quality of Nemesis is quite bad in my point of view... there are several artefacts and the picture is quite blurry. This kinda surprises me, as the older movies have better quality... maybe something went wrong with the encoding or the source (Source.........: stn.2002.1080i.ts-hdr) is bad..."
,John_Doe1214,2010-08-24T05:57Z,"Why is the sound out of sync (about a full second)? I use ConvertXtoDVD 4 for burning. Is there a step or setting to correct this? Any help is appreciated.

Thanks for the upload."
,mike18xx,2010-10-21T21:52Z,"Nemesis is also 25fps....FAIL.

Please retime PAL rips."
,the.llama,2011-02-18T21:31Z,Awesome! Big thanks to the uploader!
