            Ã›  BEHEMOTH have set â€œEvangelionâ€ as the title of      Ã›
            Ã›  their ninth hell breaking opus. A Greek word        Ã›
            Ã›  meaning â€œspreading the good newsâ€ or â€œspreading     Ã›
            Ã›  the words of Godâ€, its use is often related to      Ã›
            Ã›  biblical stories of the salvation of mankind, the   Ã›
            Ã›  sacrificial death of Jesua and his later            Ã›
            Ã›  resurrection. BEHEMOTH choose to use the word in    Ã›
            Ã›  itâ€™s purest, etymological context, without any      Ã›
            Ã›  Christian connotations - the time of spreading      Ã›
            Ã›  good news has come indeed. This is the Evangelion   Ã›
            Ã›  Of The New Eon.                                     Ã›
            Ã›                                                      Ã›
            Ã›  Representing a whole new spectrum of strength,      Ã›
            Ã›  creativity and determination, â€œEvangelionâ€ is the   Ã›
            Ã›  album to undoubtedly lead this Polish mob to the    Ã›
            Ã›  peak of the extreme metal genre. Always a band for  Ã›
            Ã›  disrespecting the boundaries of self-limitation     Ã›
            Ã›  (indeed, evil has no boundaries), these metal       Ã›
            Ã›  luminaries have returned with fury and vengeance.   Ã›
            Ã›  Recorded in the bandâ€™s hometown Radio Gdansk        Ã›
            Ã›  studio with Wieslawscy Brothers and Daniel          Ã›
            Ã›  Bergstrand (drums) in the producers chair, and a    Ã›
            Ã›  stunning mix courtesy of the legendary Colin        Ã›
            Ã›  Richardson (Machine Head, Slipknot, Carcass), the   Ã›
            Ã›  final result is a beast of an album, and one that   Ã›
            Ã›  will tear any competition to shreds.                Ã›
            Ã›                                                      Ã›
            Ã›  Expectations are high for BEHEMOTH with what many   Ã›
            Ã›  are citing as their breakthrough album. Indeed,     Ã›
            Ã›  the band have already stolen a Golden God at this   Ã›
            Ã›  yearâ€™s Metal Hammer Awards for â€œBest Underground    Ã›
            Ã›  Bandâ€, as well as securing first place in           Ã›
            Ã›  Terrorizerâ€™s readers polls (â€œBest Live Bandâ€,       Ã›
            Ã›  â€œBest Vocalistâ€, Best Drummerâ€). But this is not    Ã›
            Ã›  an overnight success story. BEHEMOTH have been      Ã›
            Ã›  together for close to 19 years now. Formed by a     Ã›
            Ã›  teenage Nergal in 1991, BEHEMOTH quickly made a     Ã›
            Ã›  name for themselves in black metal circuits with    Ã›
            Ã›  early cult releases â€œSventevith (Storming Near the  Ã›
            Ã›  Baltic)â€, â€œâ€¦And The Forests Dream Eternallyâ€ mini   Ã›
            Ã›  CD, and â€œGromâ€. Third full length â€œPandemonic       Ã›
            Ã›  Incantationsâ€ saw the addition of drum monster      Ã›
            Ã›  Inferno, at which point the band started to         Ã›
            Ã›  realise their full potential. Slowly evolving with  Ã›
            Ã›  increasingly impressive musicianship and            Ã›
            Ã›  songwriting, as well as ever-imporoving production  Ã›
            Ã›  values, the band amassed a solid and dedicated      Ã›
            Ã›  fanbase with such highly acclaimed albums as â€œThe   Ã›
            Ã›  Apostasyâ€ and â€œDemigodâ€, as well as some very high  Ã›
            Ã›  profile tours, including runs with acts such as     Ã›
            Ã›  Dimmu Borgir, Deicide, Amon Amarth, Opeth, In       Ã›
            Ã›  Flames, Trivium, Morbid Angel, Chimaira, and, most  Ã›
            Ã›  notably, 2007â€™s Ozzfest where the bandâ€™s            Ã›
            Ã›  unrelenting energy, savage brutality and            Ã›
            Ã›  uncompromising vision made them the breakthrough    Ã›
            Ã›  artist of the tour.                                 Ã›
            Ã›                                                      Ã›
            Ã›  In support of their 9th full-length, BEHEMOTH will  Ã›
            Ã›  be hitting the road with Slayer and Marilyn Manson  Ã›
            Ã›  as part of the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival      Ã›
            Ã›  tour, the hottest US tour of the summer, and one    Ã›
            Ã›  that is bound to see them increase their dedicated  Ã›
            Ã›  fanbase even further. Out to consistently push the  Ã›
            Ã›  envelope and top previous efforts, BEHEMOTH have    Ã›
            Ã›  with â€œEvangelionâ€ delivered an extreme metal        Ã›
            Ã›  masterpiece set to drop the jaws of all who hear    Ã›
            Ã›  it. Stay tuned and beware - Evangelion is here!     Ã›
