:) im using uTorrent on a mac & FINALLY worked out how to get magnet files to work, this link was my first attempt & in less than an hour it's nearly finished!!! Unsure of quality yet but so far so good!!!

,blank8087,2012-06-24T19:41Z,"@PhilnLisa - ahem... you realise you can just convert the files to make them smaller & merge the two folders together...? 

Adobe audition or cool edit pro are the two programs i use but anything like protools or similar would work, you can get simple converters too & just save at a smaller bitrate :)"
