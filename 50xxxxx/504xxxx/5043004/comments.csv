,davidscritchfield,2009-08-09T20:42Z,"I love this collection!!  The only song i really recommend for volume 2 is ""No leaf clover""  from the Metallica S&M CD....its a live song but its the only version available and a great song!!  Thanks for the collection!!!"
,Derrick4Real,2009-08-12T05:09Z,"i highly suggest to anyone who still burns cds for the car...use the audio leveling function when burning.

each Metallica album has such different production qualities...the audio goes from one extreme to another.

Your torrents are really good as they are Original CD Rip & 320kbps.
But why do you rip at ""Joint Stereo""?

Please use Stereo mode.
Just few MBs more & we can get the best quality."
