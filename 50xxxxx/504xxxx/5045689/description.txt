THE STORY: 
Trapped in what will soon be a purely robotic world, The Exiles find out that drastic steps were taken to save humanity, and even machines can have secrets! But one of the Exiles has a secret too - one that can destroy the whole mission when revealed. (And Morph finally pokes his head back in!)
