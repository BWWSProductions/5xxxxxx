The CD version, released on February 15, 2005, includes several recorded segments including a rap song performed with Lil' Jon called "Get Lower", and recurring themes of "Thug Radio" and "Tip Your Hat to Whitey". At the conclusion of the album, is a spoof movie trailer titled "Who Tha Fuck You Looking At"; the protagonists are made out to be black men, but the voice-over gives the cast as Steven Seagal, Chingy, Sidney Poitier and the sound of machine guns.
