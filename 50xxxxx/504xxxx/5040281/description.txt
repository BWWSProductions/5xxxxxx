O Magnum Mysterium - 
Johannes Ockeghem: Missa Prolationum and Josquin desPrez: Missa Da Pacem
Stuttgart Schola Cantorum


The Missa prolationum is a musical setting of the Ordinary of the Mass, by Johannes Ockeghem, dating from the second half of the 15th century. Based on freely written material probably composed by Ockeghem himself, and consisting entirely of mensuration canons[1], it has been called "perhaps the most extraordinary contrapuntal achievement of the fifteenth century", and was possibly the first multi-part work to be written which used a unifying canonic principle all its movements

   1. Kyrie
