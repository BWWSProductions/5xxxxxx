I had already downloaded this but like yours, it doesnt work after installation. I use mandriva 2009 if you know how to start it without errors tell us."
,shahinul,2009-08-06T15:20Z,"@evastevens first you should note that errors. maybe you have something missing on your os.
try better to mandriva or linux forum. you could get more help there."
,Disinfo,2009-08-06T18:16Z,"I`m not sure about dependecies, but the most important thing is your videocard and the installed drivers. 
I`m running on Ubuntu 9.04 with the ATI Radeon free drivers"
,evastevens,2009-08-06T23:36Z,"Yes im sorry.
