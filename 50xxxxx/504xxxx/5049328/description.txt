Hworangs Game DVD1 [English][PCDVD][4in1]

Black And White:
No other PC game to date has so effectively combined so many seemingly incompatible elements into one highly polished game.

Red Faction:
THQ brings the Geo-Modding hook of its original shooter series to the latest generation of gaming systems.

Planet Of The Apes:
It fails at each of the three elements that can make this type of game enjoyable: exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving.

Outlive:
While it may appeal to nostalgic Starcraft fans, there isnt anything in Outlive that isnt done much better in any number of recent games.
