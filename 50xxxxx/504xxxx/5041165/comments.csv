,vetsoljer,2009-08-04T22:01Z,"the crack was made by someone on 

http://tehparadox.com/forum/

he said he changed 3 lines of code :0, guess making a noo cd crack isnt that hard. only thing is I lazy and didnt install a virus scanner on my pc yet, so if you'd like to scan it be my guest, im still good over here though."
,vetsoljer,2009-08-04T22:04Z,"@ 113977 & inges
are you patching 1.2.7 then 1.3.24 ?"
,zsigaantal,2009-08-05T01:07Z,"Install The_Sims_3_-_Razor1911_Final_MAXSPEED
than use the crack but only the exe crack not the dslhost.dll, update to 1.27 than use the 1.27 crack (the exe and the tslhost.dll),after that u can update to 1.3.24 and use the 1.3.24 exe carck for no cd bullshit.A bit complicated but i got it to work perfectly!"
,vetsoljer,2009-08-05T01:18Z,"@zsigaantal
you actually shouldn't need to install any cracks except the 1.3.24"
,zsigaantal,2009-08-05T01:46Z,"Sorry for double post but heres the easiest way to install sims 3 with the 1.27 and 1.3.24 update :
download the sims 3 by itself here
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5022393/The_Sims_3_-_Razor1911_Final_MAXSPEED

After instaling the game dont use any cracks!Just update to 1.27 than update to 1.3.24 than use the crack u got with 1.3.24 and play!

,Zedseayou,2009-08-06T17:25Z,"Still working on it, but please update the readme in the torrent, the instructions at the complete torrent (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5040628/The_Sims_3_%28Razors1911%29_With_patches_and_crack_for_1.3.24) seem to be correct, since the torrent includes only 4 files : readme, crack, and two patches. The readme in the torrent however references some other files not there."
,Zedseayou,2009-08-06T18:25Z,"Works great thanks, follow zsigaantal's instructions or the ones on my previous link. 

Thanks, and seeding."
,cutiepi5254,2009-08-06T23:46Z,"i already dl'ed the sims 3 before (not from the link provided here)... and i dl'ed these patches and its telling me that an invalid file was found D:

how can i get the patches to work?"
,sprocket9,2009-08-07T00:14Z,"So, I've already cracked the 1.06 update that came with razor1911's one dl. and since they're cracked, I'm afraid this might not work as people have already showed. so, if someone would post the correct TS3 and the .dll, that would be amazing. just a lil copy and pasting, then some updates"
,vetsoljer,2009-08-07T10:16Z,"yes I kno this readme is messed up. becuase I changed the readme for just patch 1.3.24, but it didnt work because that patch only patches 1.2.7 to 1.3.24.
so yes zsigaantal instructions are right. 
@sprocket9
I included the patches and the crack for the 1.3.24 patch. you shouldn't need the .dll file?? verified on mine, my mothers and I guess zsigaantal.
@cutiepi5254 google it, I saw how to fix it... but truthfully it confused me and I don't remember. You could try downloading my other torrent which includes the razor1911 .iso I used, and this torrent. or download razor1911 newest torrent which should be faster then mine.

PS
first time upoading a game/cracks/patches. it worked for me, so i wanted to share, if your having problems, because I know i messed up the readme, thats what this comment section is for, because this game/patches/crack does work. GUARANTEED.  I just suck at this, I'll make a better one next time I decide to upload something."
,brengsed,2009-08-07T20:11Z,dude i have a request can you find or upload a crack for 1.4?
,fnnnk,2009-08-07T21:09Z,"OK, I got myself a little situation. I installed TS3 from the other razor torrent and cracked it with the crack that came with it (Both files). Then I downloaded this and tried to update it but I couldn't cause I cracked it bfore. Then I uninstalled the game so I could reinstall it without the crack but it still shows up in Control Panel and it still takes up 5 gigs of space on D (I installed it in D). I can't reinstall it cause it says it's already been installed and that it's an older version than what I have (Cause I used the final version patch). It won't uninstall from Control Panel cause it says there is still an unfinished setup running (Probably the failed patch setup) and that I have to close it before uninstalling, but there's nothing else running (according to Task Manager). Please help. My game was running fine before I tried this. I'm on Vista, btw."
,fnnnk,2009-08-07T21:36Z,I checked it and turns out there's a bug in TS3 where if you failed to install 1.3.24 you can't uninstall the game :(. But I can'tr install patch 1.4 to fix this bug either XS!
,fnnnk,2009-08-07T21:51Z,"Really sry for the triple post. I started installing patch 1.4 and that one  doesn't require the two previous patches.  It failed, but it fixed the 1.3.24 bug. I uninstalled the game and everything's fine now :D."
,corruptcompassion,2009-08-07T22:02Z,"To fnnnk. Mount your original Sims 3 image, right-click open it, open the game folder, and then the bin folder. Select all in the bin folder and copy everything over the content of your bin folder in your game directory on you HDD. Don't just copy one bin folder folder over the other, that could cause problems. Now delete the TS3.exe file and rename the newly copied ""TS3.ex_"" to ""TS3.exe"". Now go back to the original disk image, copy the original skuversion.txt file and paste it over the one in your game directory bin folder. Now apply both updates. They should work and so should the game. "

,RhymesMatter,2009-08-12T15:06Z,"@vetsoljer
So this crack worked like a charm!Great work mate really thank you for that!I wanted to ask a question:Will you be able to upload patch 1.4 that's been released as a followup to this particular patch with a crack?Thanks again for great upload!"
,SubGum,2009-08-12T21:23Z,"Following corruptcompassion's post, I got the patches installed correctly and the crack placed.

After getting everything installed the game would run but would shortly crash to the desktop at the loading screen.

I determined that it was because of the mods I was using (no intro, debug enabler, fruit hack). So I simply disabled all my mods and the game works great. I assume the update was simply a mod breaker and new versions of my mods will be released soon.

Hope this helps someone."

,tallen90,2009-08-14T10:46Z,"Anyone that downloaded the Razor1911 MAXSPEED version of the Sims 3 and used the supplied crack needs to follow these steps to install the patches:

1) Mount the original Razor1911 .iso file to a virtual disk drive.
2) Navigate to the disk in 'My Computer' and right-click the disk, then select 'Explore'.
3) Open the ""Game > Bin"" folder.
4) Copy the files ""TSLHost.dll"" and ""TS3.ex_"".
5) Paste the files into ""C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin"", replacing the old versions.
6) Go back to the disk and Explore again. Don't go into any folders, just copy the file 'skuversion.txt', and then paste it into the same folder as before.
7) Now patch the game, it should proceed without any errors. 
8) Once patched, install the crack again, works a treat!

Thanks vetsoljer :)"
,Thoms,2009-08-16T19:55Z,"Hi. 
Hope that someone can help me. I've tried several times to patch with the 1.2.7 from the Razor1911 iso file, only following the latest instr. from vetsoljer.

But when I Try to download it on my friends computer it didn't work, instead of the ISO file, it was a .rar file which didn't contain the ISO file needed to start the game.

Before the download he did not have daemon tools, but now he does but when i look at the files I am downloading in the torrent it still says its a rar file. Whats wrong?"

,dj_necro,2009-08-30T17:43Z,"I personally tried all of the patch/cracks for the razor version that were available on the blogspot site...these are the same files.  

I must have spent hours trying it again and again....the best I got was ""region not found"" error.  

If you got in my situation and it screwed up the game, all you have to do re-extract the original files from the razor torrent and over-write the patch cracks.  the game still works patched or not,....and you can still find the downloads for extra content.  

But seriously, for all the trouble you will go through to get the patches/content (and an expansion is coming out soon) it's probably more worthwhile to just purchase a copy of the game lol"
,chelleeee,2009-11-17T00:04Z,"hey guys, thanks for all the help, installing the patch and the cracks worked fine. 
But i still have the same problem i had from the beginning: when i click TS3.exe (no matter what version or crack or whatever) it seems like the game starts, my screen goes black, and then it goes back to the desktop and does nothing. 
Can anyone fix this?

Is it at all possible that someone could upload just the pre-cracked game files so I could download that instead of the entire game over again? I'm at college so I can't download huge files without getting caught. Thanks guys."

,Epixfailz,2011-05-04T01:31Z,"Heres link for further patches aswell
http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/patches/sims3/patch.html"
,EXMONL,2011-06-06T16:33Z,"SOLUTION FOR SUCCESSFUL PATCHING!
------------------------------------------------
A patch has to overwrite certain files that's the job of a patch. So if some files are not original anymore which the patch has to overwrite there will be a file error.
The first 2 problems are TSLhost.dll and TS3.exe which are not original anymore because they are cracked.
Remove those 2 files. Then copy the original 2 files from the ISO to your Sims 3/Game/Bin folder.
After that install the 1.2.7 patch. You already have it but still patch it cause it will restore the other critical files needed for the 1.2.34 patch.
After that you have a clean 1.2.7 and you can use the 1.2.34 patch. After everything is patched ok use the TS3.exe crack and copy that to your Sims 3/Game/Bin folder.
Now everything should work fine.
