HOW TO STOP A HURRICANE (2008)

There are two things you can say for sure about hurricanes. One, they are Natureâ€™s most destructive force, and two, another big one will soon be on its way.

Given the incredible destruction wrought by the hurricane that actually swerved away at the last minute from New Orleans in late 2005, imagine the devastation and loss of life when the Next Big One slams directly into a major American City. And given the likelihood of that happening, what, if anything, can the most technologically powerful nation in the history of civilization do to save itself?

Believe it or not, there are dozens of scientists, government researchers, inventors, and entrepreneurs who think hurricanes can be stopped. Could their theories work? This documentary looks at the most interesting ideas and evaluates them. 

This film will take a look at the fascinating origins of hurricanes in Africa and track the life of one hurricane as it is born, builds power as it crosses the Atlantic, and becomes a full, named hurricane threatening the lives of millions on the east coast of North America. The film will also introduce the men and women who watch hurricanes, penetrate the storms in specially designed aircraft, and are fascinated by every conceivable aspect of these Monster Winds.

As Dr. Robert Knapp and his crew of the worldâ€™s top hurricane trackers at the National Hurricane Center headquarters in Miami follow the beastâ€™s path across the Atlantic towards America, the story inter-cuts with the hurricane-busting theories and their advocates being put to a virtual test. Each of the scientists/inventors who is convinced they know the way to stop a hurricane will be profiled and filmed on location with their apparatus and tests, which will be combined with computer-generated animation and graphics to clearly illustrate their method. 

Part human drama and part technological exploration, How to Stop A Hurricane is a fantastic scientific thriller on one of Natureâ€™s Great Beasts, and Manâ€™s attempt to contain it.
