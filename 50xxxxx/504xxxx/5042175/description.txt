Grey Gardens (2009) - [True glamour never fades] 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758751/

Based on the life stories of the eccentric aunt and first cousin of Jackie Onassis (both named Edith Bouvier Beale aka "Big and Little Edie") raised as Park Avenue dÃ©butantes but who withdrew from New York society, taking shelter at their Long Island summer home, "Grey Gardens." 

As their wealth and contact with the outside world dwindled, so did their grasp on reality. 

They were reintroduced to the world when international tabloids learned of a health department raid on their home, and Jackie swooped in to save her relatives.
