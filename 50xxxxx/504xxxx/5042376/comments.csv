It comes with a standalone bink player.
that way you can play each bik file to see which ones yu want to edit out.
then open rad, choose a file and click ""bink it""
then yu can edit out all the frame rates you dont want.
You can also use this to compress videos further. I dont recommend it for game files, theyre already compressed.
but this is how I have been doing this.

You gotta love it when you can start a game and actually play it now instead of watching opening credits for all the companies that made it."
