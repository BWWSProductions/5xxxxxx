This file has been scanned with NOD and AVG
Please scan ALL your downloads. I do NOT upload virus.
If you dont understand what a "bik" file is in the game, do NOT download this.
This is a modified replacement opening credit videos which does NOT show all the opening credits so you can get o game faster.
Its basically "ripping" the bloatware out of the opening video.
You want to play your game without having to keep hitting escape all the time to get past the opening credits. then download this.
So yes, this is small, it is intended to be, I removed all but 1 frame out of the intro logo videos. you want yur games to boot right up without having to watch all those credits? then this s how its done.

Tired of those damn LONG PLAYING ad intros in your games?
You know, the Nvidia logo and Take Two game logo and so on, you have to wait for them 
to finish just to get to the game.
Some games wont let you go past it by tapping the escape key.

So this is where I come in.
This is for the Prototype Game. Gets rid of the annoying logo ads when the game starts.

Cut all the LOGO's 

Copy these files into the Prototypemovies folder.
(in case this doesnt show the backslashes, find the "Prototype" folder then the "movies" folder and unzip this in there)

This file contains 1 of the ad logos that drag the starting of the game out to a couple of minutes, but not now.

Start the game and wala! go right to the game!!! 

This file is zipped up, so download and just unzip it in that folder!

Be watching for more for other games as over the next few days I will be releasing a 
bunch more of these.
