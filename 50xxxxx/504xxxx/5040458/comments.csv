,dentarthurdent,2009-08-05T12:56Z,"according to the BBFC This re-edited version is a few minutes shorter than the Director's Cut release in 2004.  Incidentally, it was rated 18 in 2004, now is a 15.  The televised version was PG on DVD.
WTF???"
,ChockFulla.info,2009-08-05T16:04Z,"They removed some of the funniest lines of dialogue and all of the nudity that was in the original episode, plus the ending was changed so that it does not fit in with the next episode any more. Way to screw up a perfectly good episode, MGM! I'll stick with the original."
