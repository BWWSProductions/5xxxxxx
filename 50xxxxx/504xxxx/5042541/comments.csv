,BinkyDeath,2012-01-14T01:10Z,I can't get this to play with VLC Media Player and can't figure out how to install the codec (or even find it) to make it play. This is the very first file after years of use that VLC has failed me. Any suggestions on how to get this file to play? All I get is the audio. :(
