Rare colllection of alternate mixes of some of the tracks from Michael Jackson's album "Bad". Featuring rare extended mixes from the 'Bad' album. The disc includes a collection of much longer versions of selected tracks (some an amazing 10+ minutes long), plus previously unavailable extended versions. This post includes the covers.

This is a repost as my previous torrent failed to hash everybody stuck at 84% while 100% was available. Sorry for that. 


IMPORTANT NOTE: 

I am looking for Thriller 25 - The bootleg (contains the demos and unreleased tracks from the Thriller period)If you like MJ this is a must
if someone could upload it would be magic  thanks
