A compilation of Maps for World @ War Nazi Zombies. Modern Variants, too!

Contains:

Modern Nacht Der Untoten
Anzio
Bunker
Chinatown
FRUchurch
Tunisia
Vacant
White Woods

And their Modern Versions. Will add more later if I can.

Mind you, these are for Co-op Only. It's possible to play over LAN with friends, but if you're not on a LAN, then Hamachi can be used, as well. However, it needs a little configuring.

How to install:

Open up Users[Your Windows Username Here]AppDataLocalActivisionCoDWaW

Drag the contents of the .7z into the Mods folder (make one if you don't have one yet).
