This is kind a tribute to Zappa's unique music
VHS Release Date: November 2, 1993-two days before his death! Weird!"
,sy_borg,2009-08-07T06:20Z,"My pleasure, guys!

Since there seemed to be a good bit of interest in this torrent, I'll get to work digitizing two other VHS bootleg/rarities type affairs which are in my possession (entitled ""Zappa Interviews"" and ""Zappa On TV"").

Should be up in a week or so!"

Perhaps you should review your Zappa history since Frank died on December 4th, which obviously is not two days after November 2nd."

I had been meaning to clean it up and compress it eventually... you beat me to it, and did a far better job than I could have done.  Thanks again!
