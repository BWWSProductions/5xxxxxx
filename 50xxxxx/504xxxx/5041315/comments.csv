,Danjres,2009-08-05T04:07Z,LOVING this rar file.  It has so many parts!  It's like downloading a ton of files instead of 1! awesome! ;-)
,caliwillbemine,2009-08-05T15:35Z,"yeah rar is like rawrr, i love converting it before it plays, so i can microwave popcorn & stuff!

Plus 5432 rars are so usefull cause if it ever crashes in a chance in a million, you just have to redownload the bad one, only if you find it among the others!"
,Latiino,2009-08-05T17:43Z,LOL
,davidmhodgey,2009-08-05T23:16Z,I heard you went to the rar restaurant and ate all the rars in the restaurant and they had to close the restaurant 
,gregersamsa,2009-08-06T22:44Z,"Everyone's a comedian! ;) Except me. I don't like rars. It's stupid and everyone (yes, every single one) who disagrees with that is an idiot. It's incredibly inconvenient that I have to unpack a hundred files (!) and hope that they're all fine instead of just putting it directly on my network media tank (PH) or even using my NMT to dl it."
,astolthet,2009-08-15T18:57Z,"gregersamsa, ever thought about the fact that the file system FAT32 only truly can handle files of sizes maximum ? 4 GB and under? For instance, it's not possible to download a whole DVD-sized movie and copy it to a regular USB storage device. Rars are very handy. Also as mentioned earlier you can easily replace damaged files without the whole movie being corrupt."
,ironton,2009-08-16T17:53Z,"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

If you don't like RARs. then don't DL them. If you want something for free, take it and say thanks.

thanks, AiTB!"

(paraphrased, of course.)
You sound like the guy who must have started the mob that stoned Galileo.
There are valid reasons for raring a torrent. Reasons that reach a greater beneficiary audience than your idiotbox sect. astolthet is right (mostly). Also, it really is a great chance to pop popcorn.
Oh, and let's not forget that your statement about the inconvenience of unraring is complete hyperbole. You just have to double click a .rar file, click extract, and hit ok.
Everyone's a comedian; or a critic."
,Lexiconic,2009-08-18T02:39Z,"Sorry, I've mixed Galileo with someone else. Can't remember who. Either way, he was denounced and called crazy."

Yes there are but RARs also shoot themselves in the leg when it comes to seeding.

Here is what usually happens:

1. DL the rared movie whatever.
2. Wait...
3. Unpack rar... wait some more.
4. Delete everything except the actuall movie.
5. Watch movie.

Notice anything there that might mess up the seeding? Mr Imdonedownloading doesnt care, hes watching X-manIIIV right now.

My point being that people are egotistical, lazy and far from idealistic. In your perfect world everyone is a filesharing idealist who leaves the RARs and keeps seeding. And some suckers do, thank you to those.

Now what happens if you have just one movie file:

1. DL the movie file whatever.
2. Wait...
3. Watch movie as soon as you reach 100%.
4. Keep seeding because youre to lazy to remove it from the list.

See? This works WITH peoples bad sides rather than rely on people being all nice and sharing carebears.


I rest my case."
,Nate8727,2009-09-01T19:50Z,"Despite the fact you guys don't like RARs, lets get to the whole point of this comment section.

How was the quality of the movie?  Just because RARs were used doesn't make the quality of the movie bad.  You do realize that RARs help the downloads from being damaged right?

You're truly that lazy if you can't wait a whole 30 seconds for a rar file to extract..."
,Zeppoleon,2009-09-02T23:21Z,This unrars to a .mkv right?
,Klo-Robot,2009-09-09T17:01Z,You don't know because it's rar'ed!
,farstar,2009-09-10T11:57Z,To all the stoneage people out there: there are programs and movie players with RAR support  which means you don't have to unpack and wait. Just a simple click 'n' play.
,lailabagge,2009-09-11T21:31Z,"I agree with all those who think rars are stupid. If a system has a technical limitation to how large files are, than you should stop using it. It sounds like those who argued that there's really no need for a file to have a name longer than eight.three letters and that it was the best system really. No thank you, the future is one without rars."
,miller126,2009-09-12T02:25Z,"you people are stupid........... if you don't know how to download and then turn all the rar's into one file,,,, then you have no business even being on here downloading anything!!!!!!! and you can't have ONE huge file like that to download anyway... well i guess you could only it would take three months... 


go download win rar right click the first rar......and if you can't figure it out from there then sorry bout your luck"
,Christian777,2009-09-14T18:39Z,"Dear Uploader, thank you so much for this and many other great uploads.

But I do agree, rar packing a movie is a thing of the past with low bandwidth and what not. than if there was an error somewhere in the movie compilation we only had to dl i rar to get it right.

However, machines are faster today and we have multicore cpu's, therefore very few compilations end up damaged. Also moviefile are getting very large due to HD. I got now 6 TB of harddisk space, 1/3 of witch are filled withs rars, thats not very efficient and when the harddisk space once again is close to used up many people have to delete the original rar directly after downloading, giving bad dl speed and hit and runs. Really, who wants that?

So please lets discuss this and hopefully decide that the time of rar packed movies is a time of the past."
