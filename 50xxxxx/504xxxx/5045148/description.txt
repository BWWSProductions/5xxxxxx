Curiousface- The Night of Sevens
The music of â€œCuriousfaceâ€ is an indie produced combination of Electronic and classical sounds inspired by bands such as; Â Radiohead, Fever Ray, Postal Service and many others.Â  The concept behind the album â€œThe Night of Sevensâ€ can be taken on a shallow level following the â€œTanabataâ€ love story derived from the Japaneseâ€™ star festival.Â  If you feel curious enough to dig a bit deeper,Â  you will find verses, taken from the Bible, included with each of the tracks to add to a secondary story.
No matter which way the listener understands the album, they will find the common link as the number 7.
