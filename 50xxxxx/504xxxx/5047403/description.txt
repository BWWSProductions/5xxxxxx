Storyline:
"The Arab world's greatest-ever film star Omar Sharif teams up for the first 
time with the Arab world's biggest box office draw Adel Imam in Hassan and 
Morcos, an often hilarious satire which attempts to tackle religious bigotry in
 Egypt. The film revolves around a Christian priest (Imam) and Muslim preacher 
 (Sharif) who survive separate assassination attempts. Now on the run, the two 
 men - who don't know each other - take refuge in a safe house in a downtown 
 Cairo neighborhood and assume different identities, with Imam's character 
 pretending to be a Muslim and Sharif a Christian.
