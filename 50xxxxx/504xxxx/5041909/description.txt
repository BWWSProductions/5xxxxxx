In Premiere Pro CS4 Essential Training, Antony Bolante provides a step-by-step, hands-on demonstration of a typical video editing workflow, from import to export. After creating a project and discussing how to configure settings based on editing goals, he shows how to gather and organize assets, including video files, layered Photoshop and Illustrator files, and footage captured from tape. He applies basic editing techniques to assemble a rough sequence, then tightens and refines the edit while doing basic audio mixing. Titles, transitions, and effects are used to add a professional touch. Antony also discusses techniques for exporting the finished edit to disc, tape, and a variety of digital formats.
