also please seed, every gigabyte you seed saves a child from molestation and/or abuse... do you support child molestion and abuse?????!!!!"
,vetsoljer,2009-08-04T08:44Z,"If you have the sims 3 .iso file that came with the maxspeed razor1911 torrent in the folder you download this in, it will go SOOO much faster, and you'll also help seed this better"
,santos2,2009-08-04T10:28Z,I have 666 kbit/s uploadstream. Feed me.
,RiceNBeans93,2009-08-06T22:09Z,"im kinda new to this entire thing
so i downloaded everything
the only thing im have trouble with is the crack
how do i overwrite the game with the crack"
,sprocket9,2009-08-06T23:48Z,"hey, for people that already have game downloaded, would it be possible to use your crack to update it? for example, if you would post just your cracked new version without the game, could we just update the game via the game bin folder?"
,sprocket9,2009-08-06T23:55Z,"nvm dude, I found you're other one d:"
,vetsoljer,2009-08-07T10:18Z,"@RiceNBeans93 (love your username lol)
so you have the game installed and patched to 1.3.24 correctly?
well you copy the crack I gave you in the crack folder into
C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin"
,RiceNBeans93,2009-08-07T23:17Z,"@vetsoljer
Thanks,
Ok but theres already a file with the same name here so do I just copy it into the game bin and delete the other one? "

,munkymagic556,2009-08-09T19:30Z,"I cannot seem to get this to work, and ended up through trying, unable to uninstall the game. Help please, it would be greatly appreciated. "
,munkymagic556,2009-08-09T21:19Z,"Nevermind, I was able to update up to the latest version, but when I open the game it closes when it begins to load."
,therevolutiongirl,2009-08-14T03:03Z,"i have a problem, when the game ends of loading it says that they cant make sure that my game is original so it closes, what should i do?"
,ergys_ura,2009-08-14T03:43Z,"DUDE, vetsoljer...whats with the child abuse and molestion? does any1 know if this is worth the download?"
,oskare8,2009-08-15T00:17Z,"ok it took me 3 days to download this :) , so i hope this will work, well i have unrared the files and installed the game, but when i wanna start it, it says i need to enter the CD, i have daemon tools so i can mount it but where is the CD ? i can't find it.

,WateryIce,2009-08-16T22:10Z,"need some more seeders = (, and shit when i left it on over night it got like 10% and then went inactive, just noticed and gotta force start it = ("
,Makeswell,2009-08-17T06:33Z,"I was not able to update The Sims 3 and got instead a ""file not found"" error. Also, the patch installer for 1.27 launched Internet Explorer, which I found unusual. I placed the patches into the Sims 3 folder after installing the razor1911 Sims 3 and opened them before getting the error. I use Windows Vista and stuff. Also considering how recent this torrent is, it probably is a fake, and certainly didn't work for me."
,Blackbyrd,2009-08-20T09:18Z,"Ok I did everything got the crack and the patch to work- but now I CAN NOT play the game. Every time I try I get this message: We are unable to verify that your disc is a valid copy of The Sims 3.
Please contact customer services. I do not have a mac, the game seemed to work fine before I put the patch in. PLEASE some one tell me how to fix this. I am not a nobie so there is on need for condescending comments. I've been simming for a very long time and this is the first time I've had this problem. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP.!!!!!"
,E2tava,2009-08-20T14:24Z,"When I try to run ""autorun.exe"" OR ""sims3setup.exe"", That error-message appears:

Does anyone KNOW what this is and how can I fix it?
"
,E2tava,2009-08-20T14:41Z,"Ok guys, sorry I figured it out !! My version of Daemon tools ... You sound open this with PowerISO !!!"
,Blackbyrd,2009-08-20T17:24Z,"I just wanted to add that I am NOT connected to the internet when I try to play my game, so its not as if the game is checking my registry to see if it's legit or not. So if anyone knows anything your input would be greatly greatly appreciated. "
,didvid,2009-08-20T20:13Z,"to people with ""Cannot verify CD"" error, you need to take the TS3 file from Crack folder and replace the one in the game folder.

I download the sims and install it. Yesterday i could play the sims. But today i'll try to play, but i can't. There's standing that i have to put the disc on. But i havent a disc. Does anybody know what i should do?

really tnx if anybody could help me!"
,dolan9223,2009-09-10T06:39Z,"norton 360 picked up a backdoor... something and told me to eject the disk in E drive... which is where i had this mounted. i had nothing else mounted and when i unmounted it, and rescan, it was gone...

virus? should i be worried?"
,Mudget,2009-09-12T02:04Z,"having the same problem as someone above mentioned.  i'm using windows 7 64bit, and installation is fine.  but when i apply the first patch, it gets all the way to the end and gives me a ""file not found"" error.  also opened internet explorer, but i think that's built-in because it's just a page with all the updates that come with the patch.  but i can't install the patches.  i'm gonna go out on a limb here and say this must be a vista/win7 problem, or maybe a 64 bit compatibility problem.  but if anyone knows what's up or has had this problem and solved it, let me know.  thanks."
,metalaxe,2009-09-12T10:27Z,I don't know why everyone is having such a problem with this game... works flawlessly for me.
,Mudget,2009-09-14T01:10Z,"i've decided to just buy the game, end the headache of trying to play patch-catch up every time new content is released, and not able to find a work-around for the inability to patch up, and the ""file not found"" error."
,data662,2009-10-03T20:15Z,I think this will work better on xp and hope fully it won't exit to the desktop like the other torrent.
,data662,2009-10-04T22:33Z,I get an extraction error.............
,data662,2009-10-04T23:33Z,If any1 gets an extraction error extract the folders and stuff one by one
