Program Description:

The most realistic R/C flight sim experience is back â€“ with plenty of all-new features to send you soaring! For starters, G4.5 includes RealPhysics 3D â€“ one of the most accurate, realistic flight models ever created! Each aircraft, from the smallest heli to the mightiest warbird, reacts to its environment as it would in real life. Crash into a tree, and leaves fall. Crash a balsa model and you'll even see wood dust appear after the impact! And now Real Renderingâ„¢ gives you even greater detail without increasing the workload on your computer.
  Want to fly with a friend? No problem! RealFlight G4.5 lets you fly with up to seven other pilots at once â€“ whether they're as close as the next room or on the other side of the world! Two-pilot flight is also easier than ever. Just connect your own radio transmitter for multi-mode flight â€“ no need to buy another controller! Other exciting new features let you add your own headset to chat with other pilots â€œlive,â€ and offer the ability to block out unwanted users!
  And let's not forget the features RealFlight is famous for: exciting night flying, coaching from Virtual Flight Instructors, easy push-button resets, AccuModelâ„¢ aircraft editor with over 1,500 airfoil choices, over 5,000 square miles of 3D TruLifeâ„¢ terrain and much, much more! Only one question remains: why fly the rest when you can fly the best?
