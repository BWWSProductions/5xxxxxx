,Stefflo73,2009-08-06T15:09Z,"I got probleme when i try to install this under vista 64 bit. 
It says this product don´t work with 64-bits vista product. 
Some fix for this."
,linkadrip,2009-08-06T19:44Z,"I'm running a 64 bit version of windows as well as Stefflo 73 is.
 realflight will work in vista 64 bit versions of windows but you wont be able to upload any of the updates or addons just the sim G4. The updates must be applied in order to run the addons and are all based on a 32 bit operating system incomplatiable with 64 bit versions..
But you can goto the swap pages and download  custom aircraft for G4. I havent tried this particualr torrent for upload on my machine i used an older torrent from 2008 on here and it uploaded fine you have to use a program like dameon tools and upload it with an image iso just liek putting the diskin the machine and it should work fine buy following the instruction txt.."
,Stefflo73,2009-08-07T13:09Z,"Thanx Linkadrip.

A new problem now. I have start the realflight without the addons or extras and it works. I have only the Esky hobby controller for a free simulator and i not got the channel to work. I se on the pictures on controller (left side on screen) but is not do it i do. 
way. Must i have a real controller maybe.

Calibrate the TX in windows then run the Dongle EMU and select AutoDetect. Waggle each stick and click finish for each one, you should be ok. 

Click lock calibration.

Run the sim and select Controller drop down, select G2. Then calibrate the controller within the sim..

Hope that helps.."

Thanks for posting this, great torrent.

A note about the stick config. It can be configured for mode 1 /2 /3 or 4 so no need to have fixed US stick layout.."
,geoff1967,2009-08-15T19:50Z,"hello, I'm trying to download this program but it stops more than it comes in.
Can anyone try to speed this thing up a bit??

,alexvc2003,2009-08-20T01:42Z,was wondering..... how do i install this? got it and i dont see an exe file
,andersio,2009-08-25T22:50Z,"Hi, i dosent have a controller but i have a regular pc joystick. How can i fix so i can stear up down and roll with the joystick and trotthle and rudder with keyboard?"
,sharloch,2009-08-26T20:10Z,"i downloaded it.. 

now in the instructions it says to install the game... 
but which setup to use... there are three folders ""Addons""  ""Dongle Emu 3.3"" ""Updates""  could please any one explain it..

Thanks"
,sharloch,2009-08-26T21:40Z,"it says ""DLL may be missing, corrupt, or wrong version file"""
,sharloch,2009-08-28T21:35Z,so finally it worked all i can say realflight is crap & sucks compared to AFPD please dont waste your time downloading this software..............
,max11max,2009-09-04T10:34Z,"@sharloch

I have AFPD and all I can say is Realflight is 100 times better than AFPD. The only good thing about AFPD is TrueScale, it does not have multiplayer and the simple / very basic user interface is poor.

Get Realflight G4.5, only one sim better and thats phoenix.."
,NoWiSee,2009-09-09T08:05Z,"Works great when i first got it installed. 

When you install the game you have to install it using a windows user with username that only contains the characters A-Z. You can not install it on a user account with scandinavian letters like äëö. 

Also, if you install it on a x64 operating system you will have to skip the installation of the two first updates since both of them are x86. But the last update from 4.0 to 4.5 works on x64, so you will get it updated and you can use the add-ons. "
,footdick,2009-09-11T05:14Z,"I'm using the Esky TX too and it's not fucking working.  Calibrate it with the emu.exe or whatever, then in game, and it's totally backwards and nothing works."
,Strappo,2009-10-08T16:03Z,"Works Great!! Thx!

Just one problem. The whole game just freezes when I tap CTRL+F or CTRL+G! 

One more: How the h*ll do I get the collective-pitch helicopters' rotor to start spin!? It just pitches!!

Thx"
,Strappo,2009-10-08T18:41Z,"Installing this for dummies:

Get Daemontools.
Rightclick on the red icon down to the left in windows. and hold the mouse over the first alternative in the list : ""Virtual CD/DVD ROM.

Then again hold the mouse over the first alternative. ""Device (something)"" And then click mount image. 

Now navigate into My documents/downloads/Realflight or wherever your downloaded files are.

Then mount the "".mds"" files! Not the others.
Mount them from the top to the last .mdf-file.

You'll notice that the installation-window comes up when you mounted the first one. Then just wait till your computer ask for the next disc. Just mount the next .mds and click OK. Repeat the same procedure with the 3rd and 4th .mds-files.

,kanonkanjag,2009-11-21T12:04Z,"Thank you! This works with my Esky controller for FMS.

I downloaded this torrent, and followed the instructions. 

Now i can fly all the planes, but only one heli (the ""Watt Not"" helicopter) Im mostly interrested in helis, so i was wondering if anyone knows what to do to fly the other helis aswell? The helicopters only stand there on the ground. I can se that the servos is moving when i move the sticks, but they wont take of.

Also i could not install the uppgrades because im running VISTA 64, and since the 5 addons is compatible only with the upgrades i cant use them eighter.

But hey thank you anyways becaus atleast i can fly one helicopter and i bet that someone out there knows how to fix this.

Please?"
,puttiplatt,2009-11-24T12:06Z,"@kanonkanjag
To fly helis you must reverse or unreverse ""channel 7 smoke"" in realflight channel mapping. Not in the emu!"
,kanonkanjag,2009-11-27T14:50Z,"Thanx Puttiplatt

Ill try that. I noticed i can fly the helicopters if i edit them in electronic - throttle servo and edit to fixed to 100% or collective"

,stonerpanda420,2010-01-14T23:11Z,"OK this is working great for me but there's only one problem... all the planes are ridiculously overpowered.  I get unlimited vertical from all of the planes, even the trainers.  WTF"
,KDJ1616,2010-01-19T23:50Z,sharloch how did you get the setup icon to work? I am having trouble. I just get the same error that you commented on before. Any others want to help.

,kappa8564,2010-01-25T17:45Z,Im not able to get full throttle in positive position and i and figure out why. Ive tried using the signal fix in the emulator but i doesn't seem to make a differrence.

,Panoso,2010-06-11T08:49Z,Does this work on win 7 ?
,frog760,2010-06-14T07:47Z,"Yes, works in Win 7, but you have to find the emulator without the trogen horse or get an actual realflight latest gen controller."

,NoGuilt,2010-09-21T03:56Z,"Groo Dude!. You are my new bestus friend. This is one of the best D/L's. No BS! Easy install on Win7/64 bit. Bit of tweaking on the console needed and then works just sweet.

THANKS MAN."
,ITguy,2010-09-26T16:43Z,"Many thanks for this excellent torrent!!

Just to clear up a few things...

1. Runs on 64 bit Windows 7.
2. Helicopters DO work.

Use a program like IsoBuster to burn the 4 burn CD's then follow instructions included. However it is not necessary to run the first 2 updates just the RealFlight4_50_021.exe which along with the 5 add-ons is also available as a free download from the RealFlight website but is also included in this torrent.

Depending on your radio transmitter or joystick you may have to:

In the Dongle Emulator:

under 'Keyboard Mapping'

Check off 'Enable Hotkey > Joystick Emulation'

and enter:

Flaps: F1
Gear: F2

There is  NO virus in the dongle emulator. Norton is in bed with the software industry and will detect most cracks/hacks as a virus."
,Schizems,2011-02-09T00:48Z,"Ok so i can get my left/right on the right joystick of my 360 controller to work right. 

It sticks on 300% during calibration.

,ColWilson73,2011-09-22T19:55Z,"Dont know if anyone else having this problem.  
I am using Alcohol 52 on a laptop running Vista 32bit to mount the images and then run the set up from the virtual drive.  Files RFV4-1 and 4-2 load fine but then RFV4-3 hangs on loading (about 1/3rd way through)  
I have tried turning off antivirus and disconnected from internet with no joy.  Am trying a fresh download of this torrent as I think some code might have been missed during the first load.  Any pointers or hints anyone?!!"
,ColWilson73,2011-09-25T10:53Z,Just downloaded the torrent again and this time all appears to be loading OK.........Will be trying the dongle emulator with a Hitec Eclipse.......here's hoping.........
,ColWilson73,2011-09-25T18:07Z,"Had this running with a Hitec Eclipse 7 handset and a USB trainer lead.  I initially had issues with the calibration and the throttle being set to 50% indicated at minimum throttle stick position.  However, I altered the signal fix for X2/Y2 which has set the values to the right ""feel"".  if anyone else wants these values will post later.  
Great download, just make sure aftermarket tx'ers are calibrated fully."
,clivop,2011-12-26T16:59Z,"Man I feel super stupid. Cant get it to work, I have mounted all the images but keep on getting the message after clicking on the first message ""unable to remove read-only attribute from copied file ........\installer\setup2.exe"". HELP!! Pease."
,teamscon,2012-01-27T04:29Z,"Downloaded and installed with no problems.  Scanned with 2 anti-virus all passed np.  
Using a ""rc tech usb flight simulator"" by dynam.  Airplanes work great, and after some tweaking I am able to get everything working on heli's but the turn right/left stick ... Which sucks hardcore.  Think im gunna sell the simulator I have online and buy the flight simulator 6.  Unless you are flying airplanes, or have a RealFlight G4 controller ... Dont waste your time.  I wanted to throw stuff into the wall after messing with this crap."
,piwikiwi,2012-04-10T12:59Z,"Works perfectly, using ESky controller and Win7.

Thanks!"
,piwikiwi,2012-04-11T09:22Z,"BUT: Phoenix RC 3.0 posted by Tunt3Maton is MUCH better. 
Really smooth, has a nice interface and a bunch of good models included. Works easily with a USB controller through the provided emulator."
,hennieabc,2012-04-12T21:05Z,"I need help with this. I downloaded everything and then landed up with four SQL Server Database files and four .mds files. I suppose those are the four disks that Groo is talking about. How do I mount them??
There is also an ""Updates"" folder with install files. I run them and they seem to install Realflight but when I run it it complains about missing dll files.
Any ideas? Please if you can help I would really appreciate it. You can email me at hvzyl@live.com."
