,dubndrone,2009-09-20T18:08Z,cine3688: thanks so much man for getting this back online!  These are some of the most outstanding sounds I have ever heard.  
,thedukeofrosco,2009-10-22T23:12Z,Some good stuff on here. I wish there were some un altered original sounds on here. Some dodgy phasers and flangers on too many effects. Would have been nice to fuck about adding your own atmos and effects instead.
