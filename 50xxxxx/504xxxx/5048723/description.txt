What is Music Director?

eJay Music Director Gold is a music software package that is both easy to use and meets the most sophisticated professional requirements! 

Apart from the more typical audio editing tools the program also incorporates a unique system giving you full and instinctive control of every parameters! This means you now have the ability to easily automate all of the controllers used in the software by means of simple characteristic curves. This applies in particular to the effects that you use â€“ regardless of whether they are internal effects or VST plugins that you can activate from within the software.


In addition to the comprehensive audio editing function, Music Director Gold also provides video editing features. Use photos and video clips to make your very own music video! Of course, you can also edit all your video clips using fades and effects and then save the results as an AVI file.

More than 1,000 samples supplied with the software from the perfect starting point, allowing you to create your very first tracks quickly and in a number of different styles. The samples have been produced exclusively produced for eJay. In addition this package contains more than 7.500 samples from eJayâ€™s extremely Sound Collections Vol. 5.


Music Director Gold allows you to use effects, parameter curves and other audio editing tools with more flexibly than ever before. It is therefore important to ensure that you never place features in your mix that you donâ€™t really want to use. For example, there is of course no point integrating a compressor in an audio track unless you definitely need it. Only set the compressor in the audio track when and where you are actually going to use it! The following features in particular will have an effect on the performance of your computer and should, therefore, only be used when and where actually needed:

Automated parameter curves
Insert effects
Videos
Video effects
