Artie's Heroin Addiction Discussed Again


The day Artie admitted to his addiction to Heroin was quite a big moment in the show.  After he broke down the issue wasn't discussed again until the middle of the next week.  Howard felt bad bringing it up in respect for Artie.  Tune in to this classic rewind of the discussion that took place that following week.  Poor Artie!  WAHHHHHHH.


                       [***CLASSIC REWIND REQUEST WEEK***]
I've decided to have my own little special to contrast the "not-so-good" Road Trip special that's airing this week.  I'll still post the Road Trip special as well but figured I'd add a little fun to this week.  I will call it "Classic Rewind Request Week".  Give me a classic Stern moment you want to hear from the past and I'll see if I can get it and post it.
