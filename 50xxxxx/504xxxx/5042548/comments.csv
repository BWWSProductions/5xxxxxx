3.73 is the latest"
[T],jmb2012,2009-08-07T18:10Z,"sorry it is the latest available on the vso site, but it is available elsewhere."
[T],jmb2012,2009-08-07T18:16Z,"After i install and check it says version 3.7.3.190

So it is 3.8.0 when you download it but it really is not"
[V],Slickinator,2009-08-07T21:34Z,what are you talking about its 3.8.0.193 it even says so in the about of the convertx window and in the log file when you start convertx so get your story straight before you say it is not as i can even prove it. if your refering to the main download of the website it does not have a direct download to this version yet as its not officially released thanx
