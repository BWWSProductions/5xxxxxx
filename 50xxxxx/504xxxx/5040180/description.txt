This file has been scanned with NOD and AVG
Please scan ALL your downloads. I do NOT upload virus.
If you dont understand what a "bik" file is in the game, do NOT download this.
This is a modified replacement opening credit videos which does NOT show all the opening credits so you can get o game faster.
Its basically "ripping" the bloatware out of the opening video.
You want to play your game without having to keep hitting escape all the time to get past the opening credits. then download this.

I created several of these and uploaded them last night, but someone had deleted me for this.
Once again, if yu dont understand bik video and what I mentioned above, then dont bother downloading this.

Tired of those damn LONG PLAYING ad intros in your games?
You know, the Nvidia logo and Take Two game logo and so on, you have to wait for them 
to finish just to get to the game.
Some games wont let you go past it by tapping the escape key.

So this is where I come in.
This is for the FUEL Game. Gets rid of the anoying logo ads when the game starts.
NOT NOW!

The intro were 43 megs large with 675 frames. 600 of them were the logos of the game makers. NOT ANYMORE! Now it just goes right to the "Fuel" screen!

Copy these files into the FUELVIDEOS720P folder.
(in case this doesnt show the backslashes, find the "Fuel" folder then the "Videos" folder then the "720P" folder and unzip this in there)

This file contains 2 of the ad logos that drag the starting of the game out to a couple of minutes, but not now.

Start the game and wala! go right to the game!!! 

You still get the game intro, just not the minute long Logos!

This file is zipped up, so download and just unzip it in that folder!

Be watching for more for other games as over the next few days I will be releasing a 
bunch more of these.
