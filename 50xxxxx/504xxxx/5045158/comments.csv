,T-Grave,2009-08-12T19:01Z,"Hi,

Thanks for the torrent, couple of questions though:

Does this work with Windows 7 RTM x64bit?
Will I be able to use Windows Update with this?
It doesn't fuck up anything else right? Like some fucked up error code or something like that?

Thanks in advance,
T-Grave"

,kaktosjaaz,2009-08-24T02:54Z,"Any antivirus would name a 


crack
keygen
activator
patch


as a ""THREAT""

ITs a policy adopted by the antivirus 

This is just to discourage ppl with weak hearts so that they dont use such things 

Basically they are worried that we burn holes in their pockets by using such things....


Dont worry its not harmful to u in anyway :-D"

,10101-Killer,2009-11-01T17:41Z,"Per AVG Anti-Virus: Trojan Horse PSW.Generic7.RNQ. If it really *is* being triggered of of standard words such as ""crack"" ""keygen"" ""activator"", etc. then A) the smart thing to do would be to remove those items from all ascii strings prior to compiling, and B) everything (not just this app) with those patterns would trip as infected (which they do not).

The other logical solution is that the software really IS infected, and your assurances to us to continue to use it provide you with some form of benefit.
