BEST TO PLAY THIS GAME: With a controller (Press PAUSE on the keyboard to pause game)

Game Description:
THIS TIME I'M NOT GONNA WRITE ANYTHING LONG :(
1, EITHER PLAY AS THE FAST & SKILLFULL X-MEN CHARACTERS OR AS THE VERY POWERFULL TURTLES CHARACTERS
2, FIGHT RANDOMLY AGAINST 1 OUT OF 3 FINAL BOSSES IN ARCADE MODE OR THE INTENSE RATKING'S IN TAG MODE
3, MOST CHARACTERS HAVE THEIR OWN ENDING/ PLUS THERES A REAL ENDING
4, 34 CHARACTERS 
5, 37 STAGES
6, EXTRA STUFF AS ALWAYS
SO ENJOY. 



ITS BEST TO UNZIP THE GAME FOLDER TO YOUR DESKTOP FOR SECRET REASONS, BUT I WONT SAY WHY AS ALWAYS ;P
