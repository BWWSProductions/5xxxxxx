Galeno Natural Method
A Conversational System of Teaching Languages

Spanish
Book One

by Oscar Galeno

"The Spanish used in this book is correct Castilian as approved by the Royal Academy of Spanish language."

"The aim of this book is to give the student the opportunity to learn the Spanish Language in a practical and interesting way, and to furnish that foundation which is so hard to secure through a study of grammar alone, and which teachers often find tedious and painstaking."

"In this work the author has endeavored to modify the Direct Method to the extent necessary to make it intelligible and interesting to the self-student with such aid as he may be able to secure, as well as for class and schoolwork."
