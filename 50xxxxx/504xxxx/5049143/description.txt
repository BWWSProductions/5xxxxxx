 Review taken from Sputnikmusic.com:


Summary:
 A solid DVD with a superb performance and sound quality
 that is slightly let down by some minor issues. An easy reccomendation
 for anyone who is fan of the genre or of the band.


Background:
For the uninformed, some background. Porcupine Tree are a progressive rock
 four-piece from Hemel Hempstead, north of London, England. Fronted by
 vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Steven Wilson, Porcupine Tree have been
 at the forefront of the modern prog-rock scene since the release of
 The Sky Moves Sideways in 1995. Wilson has gained prominence not only
 for his works in Porcupine Tree, but also for his contributions
 to works by Opeth, Marillion, as well as his other projects
 No-Man and Blackfield. Within Porcupine Tree are bassist Colin Edwin,
 keyboardist Richard Barbieri and drummer Gavin Harrison.

Info:
For this concert release, titled Arriving Somewhereâ€¦, 
 the band, together with touring guitarist John Wesley,
 performed at Park West in Chicago, Il. The band has previously stated
 that Park West was a favorite venue of theirs, and prime contender
 for a DVD recording. 15 songs are performed in total, covering songs
 from the album Stupid Dream, released in 1999, to Deadwing, in 2005
 and everything in between. Fans of the bands older, more psychedelic
 sound may be in for a disappointment, but the selection of songs is
 a solid representation of the bands more recent sound, blending melodic,
 almost radio-friendly tunes to some heavier riffs usually only found in the depths of metal.

Audio Quality:
As expected, Steven Wilson has delivered on audio quality and mixing.
 Porcupine Tree music is often a choice pick by those reviewing high end audio products
 due to their high quality, clean production DVD-Audio releases and 5.1 DTS mixes.
 This DVD is no exception, with 48000 Hz PCM and DTS sound which is exceptionally
 clear and high quality with just the right amount of warm tone to make the soundtrack
 feel full, but not quite so much as to kill the live mood. There are a few periods where
 the music sounds almost prerecorded, but this is mostly due to the tight performance
 of the musicians and use of keyboards. These periods are hardly worth noting,
 but when the crowd cheers leave earshot, a sharp ear can sometimes pick them up,
 rare as they are. Wilsonâ€™s voice, while not the best in the genreâ€™s, holds up
 well and provides ample emotion along with the higher tones and falsetto of John Wesley
 (who is a very impressive solo artist in his own right).
 Every part of the audio feels and sounds like it was thought through and stressed over,
 and the final product shows that easily.

Conclusion:
So in conclusion, thanks to a blend of a great set list, stunning audio and a competent
 video aspect, Arriving Somewhereâ€¦ is an excellent DVD concert that will certainly
 entertain any Porcupine Tree fan, or fan of the prog rock genre. The performance is next
 to flawless and stage presence is acceptable for a band with a lead singerguitarist.
 A few shortcomings such as slightly overactive camera effects and the lack of
 a documentary are all that really stop this DVD from being one of the best released
 in a long time. That said, these annoyances are nothing to prevent you buying or experiencing
 firsthand how strong this DVD is. So spend the money, put this in a high quality player
 with a dedicated AV receiver and see for yourself not only how impressive Porcupine Tree
 are as a musical ensemble, but also how impressive this DVD looks and sounds.
 Once on your sofa with the receiver just so and the TV levels calibrated,
 very few DVDs will come to rival Arriving Somewhereâ€™s depth and quality.
