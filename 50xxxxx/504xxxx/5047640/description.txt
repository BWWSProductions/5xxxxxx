"Sunny Afternoon" is a song by The Kinks, written by chief songwriter Ray Davies. The track later featured on the Face to Face album as well as being the title track for their 1967 compilation album. Its strong Music Hall flavour and lyrical focus was part of a stylistic departure for the band (begun with 1965's "A Well Respected Man"), who had risen to fame in 1964-65 with a series of hard-driving, power-chord rock hits.

Released as a single in 3 June 1966, it went to number 1 on the UK charts on 7 July 1966, remaining there for two weeks. The track also went to number 1 in Ireland on 18 July 1966. In America, it peaked at number fourteen. "Sunny Afternoon" was placed at #200 on Pitchfork Media's list of The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s.
