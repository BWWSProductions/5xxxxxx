,el_presidente_djc,2010-12-07T22:07Z,"@download_dude112 whoooahhhh what the hell are you talking about? YOUR content? Is your name Isaac Brock? Or are you the real Johnny Marr? What the HELL are you talking about, YOUR content. Jesus H. Christ. Torrent uploaders getting tetchy about their pirated music? What will happen next . . . a balanced budget? Democrats linking arms with Republicans singing Marilyn Manson tunes? It's a Great Big White World... Ah and I'm not talking about race/skin colour but dope Charlie . . . "
