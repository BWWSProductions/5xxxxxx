Here is the product of most of my 2009 solo work.  There are many different sound textures on this album, ranging from ambient to disco.  Enjoy.  This is a guilt-free download.  The album may pop up on Itunes in the future, but will remain free indefinitely.
Also includes some tracks from other artists that I just happen to like, please don't sue me.
