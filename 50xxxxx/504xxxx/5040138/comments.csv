,Roland7749,2010-03-15T05:02Z,"Ok, game works amazing except for 3 things. 
1. Had to white blocks on the floor in Dr.Kliners lab. They didnt glitch, they were just empty blocks, just kinda detracted from the game.
2. Background noise mess up. Cant here some background noises, like people on monitors, very annoying.
3. The worst glitch, NO FLASHLIGHT! I cant see a thing in some places!
If anyone knows how to fix please tell me ;(
Otherwise its amazing :D"
,DoomTra1n,2010-03-20T14:38Z,"Ok, I actually HAVE this game.

I had let my sister test it out on her laptop 1st b4 I had gotten home, but by the time I had got my game home to MY PC (different city). I couldn't install shit. So , what I want to know is....

How do I remove that pesky ""install steam"" and ""activate with steam"" shit? I have the install disc, the manual w/ the cd key, but I CAN'T INSTALL THESE FUCKING GAMES!

..... FUCK STEAM.

*favorites bookmark* I'll be checking back daily. 

God I hope I can get MY BOUGHT GAMES to run w/out that steam bullshit. I don't care if I can't play online. I just want to at least test out the Half Life single player games. I'd heard that they were supposed to be great...... fucking waste of 40 dollars!"

,boknoy24,2011-10-02T15:49Z,"i make it work yeah... you should have mss32.dll if you got error Miles Error...

and you should create steam_appid.txt with 220 inside and steam_api.dll found in dll-files together with SteamUI.dll to make it work and your target should look like this ""C:\Program Files\Half Life 2\root\hl2.exe""ï»¿ -+mat_forcehardwaresync 0

or this this one

if still not working try this method..

go to C:\Windows\System32 (XP USER) delete the Mss32.dll and then you should have a shortcut of HL2 in Desktop right click it.. and then add this -+mat_forcehardwaresync 0

so it's gonna be like this ""F:\GAMES\Half-Life 2\hl2.exe"" -+mat_forcehardwaresync 0"

,Fishmannens,2012-05-10T22:58Z,"Maybe this will help someone... I haven't yet experienced any major problems. This is what I did, folks: I installed this on an old business laptop newly installed with 32-bit (x86) Windows 7 Home Premium. Drivers, Windows updates and DirectX were, to date (10/05/2012), all updates. I DO NOT have C++ or anything related, other than .Net 3.5 and 4.0 Client profiles (including updates), installed.

I ran the installer as an administrator (right-click, compability options). I changed the folder in which the installer wanted to install HL2 to ""C:/program files/Half-life 2"", and manually created that folder before i continued the installation. I then, still before clicking next (or whatever), granted the current user full access to this folder, before I actually installed the game into that very folder.

I have since experienced minor bugs, such as the textures being somewhat grey in the second chapter, as well as not being able to see current ammo status whilst playing the 3rd (or 4th?) chapter with the water buggy. Anyway, I practically didn't read any comments or apply any fixes, but merely used common sense. Taking this into account, I vote this release to be more ore less stable, and therefore recommended, even though my setup sucks ass.

Good luck, y'all"
