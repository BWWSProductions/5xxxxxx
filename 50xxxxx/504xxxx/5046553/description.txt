Choose from 16 playable characters (four of which are unlockable COBRA characters) â€” each with a unique set of abilities and weapons. Then gear up with the latest in high-tech gadgets (like the film-inspired Accelerator Suit) and high-powered vehicles and take your forces across 20 levels to face the worst threats in Cobra Commanderâ€™s arsenal. Adding to the adrenaline rush will be an intense single-screen co-op mode allowing two players to easily unite as a team in a classic struggle between good and evil as they work together to defeat the powers of the COBRA organization.
