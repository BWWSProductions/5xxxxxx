This is a compilation of the Beachbody - Shuaun T. Insanity videos I have been able to download so far, converted to mp4 to save space.  If you can't play the .mp4 files on your pc either download media player classic or quicktime player.  I know the quality of the videos isn't great, but it's good enough to do the workouts correctly and honestly that's all I care about.

Everything here is enough to get you through the first month, substituting 'P90X - X Stretch' for 'Cardio Recovery'.  You could also substitute 'P90X - Core Synergistics' for 'Core Cardio & Balance' during week 5.  Once I get the files I am missing I will stop seeding this and create a new torrent with the whole package. 

I created Calendar.xls to help track progress and fit test results.  Just enter your start date in the blue box and put an x in each blue box next to each workout as you complete them.  Use the Fit Test sheet to keep track of your fitness progress.
