Ive shut off auto play and I use Magic DVD Ripper to burn them but what happens after I rip it is it will start off normal then it will jump to about 20 min in to the workout and then jump around from there. Am I doing something wrong? Once again, when I get the programs ripped I will post and seed thanks!"
