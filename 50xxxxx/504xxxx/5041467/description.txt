Windows), in order to use them.

Note: There's no 5.1 audio here.  I repeat: there's no 5.1 audio here.  Only the

by Ned Raggett

In a word, stunning. Perhaps an odd word to use given that Violator continued in 
the general vein of the previous two studio efforts by Depeche Mode: Martin 
Gore's upfront lyrical emotional extremism and knack for a catchy hook filtered 
through Alan Wilder's ear for perfect arrangements, ably assisted by top English 
producer Flood. Yet the idea that this record would both dominate worldwide 
charts, while song for song being simply the best, most consistent effort yet 
from the band could only have been the wildest fantasy before its release. The 
opening two singles from the album, however, signaled something was up. First 
was "Personal Jesus," at once perversely simplistic, with a stiff, arcane 
funk/hip-hop beat and basic blues guitar chords, and tremendous, thanks to sharp 
production touches and David Gahan's echoed, snaky vocals. Then "Enjoy the 
Silence," a nothing-else-remains-but-us ballad pumped up into a huge, dramatic 
romance/dance number, commanding in its mock orchestral/choir scope. Follow-up 
single "Policy of Truth" did just fine as well, a low-key Motown funk number for 
the modern day with a sharp love/hate lyric to boot. To top it all off, the 
album itself scored on song after song, from the shuffling beat of "Sweetest 
Perfection" (well sung by Gore) and the ethereal "Waiting for the Night" to the 
guilt-ridden-and-loving-it "Halo" building into a string-swept pounder. "Clean" 
wraps up Violator on an eerie note, all ominous bass notes and odd atmospherics 
carrying the song. Goth without ever being stupidly hammy, synth without 
sounding like the clinical stereotype of synth music, rock without ever sounding 
like a "rock" band, Depeche here reach astounding heights indeed.

                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Violator is the seventh studio album by the English electronic group Depeche 
Mode, released by Mute Records on March 19, 1990. Preceded by the hit singles 
"Personal Jesus" and "Enjoy the Silence" (a Top 10 hit on both sides of the 
Atlantic), Violator propelled the band into international stardom. The album 
yielded two further hit singles, "Policy of Truth" and "World in My Eyes". This 
album is the first of the band to achieve the Top 10 on the Billboard 200â€”
reaching #7â€”and staying 74 weeks in the chart. It was supported by the World 
Violation Tour.

As part of Mute's 2006 reissue schedule, Violator was re-released as a hybrid 
Super Audio CD + DVD-Video package on April 3, 2006 which included two-channel 
and 5.1 surround mixes of the album. The six B-sides to the Violator 
singlesâ€”"Dangerous", "Memphisto", "Sibeling", "Kaleid", "Happiest Girl", and 
"Sea of Sin"â€”also appear, albeit without the surround sound treatment. The 
reissue didn't reach the US till June 6, 2006. The US version lacked the hybrid 
SACD and instead just had a CD, but the DVD was included, and was identical to 
the European DVD.

A 32-minute short film entitled Depeche Mode 1989-90 (If You Wanna Use Guitars, 
Use Guitars) and featured interviews with the band Daniel Miller, Flood, 
FranÃ§ois Kevorkian (who mixed the album), Anton Corbijn (who directed the music 
videos and did the album's photography/cover), and others. It also includes news 
footage from the infamous "riot" in Los Angeles which gave the band media 
publicity the day before Violator came out. The band were scheduled to do 
autographs in an LA music store, and the line reached into the 10,000's. The 
event had to be cancelled shortly after it began due to problems keeping the 
line in order. There is also footage from Strange Too, notably clips from the 
music videos for "Halo" and "Clean".

The remastered album was released on "deluxe" vinyl March 2, 2007 in Germany and 
March 5, 2007 internationally.

                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD IN MY EYES     by Tim DiGravina

The first thing that becomes abundantly clear when "World in My Eyes" kick- 
starts Violator is that Depeche Mode has massively upgraded its sound. Where 
things were somewhat rough and minimal on past albums, a new fullness or 
lushness is in place. The hiring of producer and all-around musical guru Flood 
to co-produce the album is most likely the catalyst for the sound upgrade. Where 
industrial-tinged bangings and clangings marked the band's output on the 
immediately preceding albums, Violator absolutely charges to life without 
pretense. "World in My Eyes" sees David Gahan's vocals in the foreground, but 
Martin Gore's high-pitched background vocals stalk Gahan step for step. The 
lyrics detail a lover's wish to "show you the world in my eyes." Such a conceit 
is classic Depeche Mode. Through sexuality and love, Gahan/ Gore's lover will 
see the world through the eyes of the singers. Twitching, perfectly-in-tune 
electronic samplers and keyboards race around the musical map as Gahan implores 
that no map is needed at all, because his "body [will] do the moving, and [his] 
hands [will] do the soothing." A somewhat lo-fi beat, almost reminiscent of a 
video game, loops throughout the track's running time. Gorgeous keyboards rest 
on the loop's base, as alternating piercing and bubbly electronic effects 
skitter about in a beautiful, complex arrangement. "World in My Eyes" is a 
glorious start to Violator. 



SWEETEST PERFECTION    by Tim DiGravina

That "Sweetest Perfection" wasn't released as a single is a tribute to the fact 
that Violator is such a masterpiece as a whole. It seems somewhat odd that 
Martin Gore handles the vocals, because Gore usually turns vocal duties over to 
David Gahan on more snarling numbers, but his vocals here are a kind of 
revelation. Gore sounds positively bothered about his sweetest perfection, and 
his lyrical obsession is tied up in the usual sexual and emotional imagery. It's 
hard to decipher if he's singing about a drug addiction or about human 
attraction, but his passionate delivery and dark words resonate powerfully over 
Alan Wilder's bleak, percolating shuffle. Infections and "injections of any 
kind" cause Gore to "stop and stare too much, afraid that (he cares) too much" 
as the sound of swirling strings and racing keyboard notes engulfs his voice. 
Screeching sampled guitars and ominous drum punches provide a brutal edge to the 
song's otherwise bubbly underbelly. "Sweetest Perfection" is a song about 
desperation, but it's about loving and even needing desperation in one's life. 
That Gore feels comfortable singing a somewhat angry confessional, rather than 
his usual redemptive ballad, is as much a testament to his ability as a 
songwriter as it is to his maturity as an artist. 



PERSONAL JESUS     	by Ned Raggett

One of the Depeche songs that seemingly everyone knows -- in large part thanks 
to blanket MTV coverage and record sales in late 1989 and early 1990 -- 
"Personal Jesus" saw Depeche tackling the ridiculous canard that "bands without 
guitars don't make real music" with vicious gusto. That Depeche had always used 
guitars in one form or another -- or that guitars or lack thereof don't 
determine quality -- had been ignored by said doubters, who had to swallow their 
words as the group's knowing revamp of an old blues lick became a smash hit. 
Starting with a soft two-note guitar chime, a massive overdubbed vocal echoes up 
-- "Reach out, touch faith!" -- and the song is off, its distinct, big but 
shuffling rhythm created from samples of the band stomping on travel cabinets. 
Compared to the busy arrangements of recent songs like "Strangelove" and "Never 
Let Me Down," "Personal Jesus" is a touch more spare, its extras more suggested 
in the mix than overtly calling attention to themselves, like the simple bass 
stabs or the brief orchestral swirls on the chorus. Otherwise, it's all beat, 
Martin Gore's not-a-note-wasted guitar twangs and slides and David Gahan's 
seductive delivery of a lyric inspired by Priscilla Presley's relationship with 
Elvis. 



HALO     by Tim DiGravina

"Halo" expertly merges a chilled but edgy dance beat and flanged guitar samples 
with sweeping cinematic strings. Following the hard-rocking "Personal Jesus" on 
Violator, the song feels like a brisk drive down the highway in a convertible. 
Underneath its suave atmosphere, the song is built on a companion melody to 
"Policy of Truth." Indeed, "Halo" might be considered a kind of musical marriage 
between "Policy of Truth"'s steady, bubbly beat and "Behind the Wheel"'s fuzzy 
tension, of course merged with an artsy film score thanks to the recurring 
strings. David Gahan's vocal delivery couldn't fit the music any better. He 
sings with a detached confidence, only sounding slightly worried as he sings 
about the "world falling apart" and walls tumbling in. That "Halo" is actually a 
love song is kind of remarkable. Buried beneath its electronic veneer and 
driving rush of melody, Gahan sings that it will be worth it to face the worst 
that life can offer just to have his lover fall into his arms. Even among the 
equally stellar moments on Violator, "Halo" stands tall as one of Depeche Mode's 
finest songs. It's the sound of the band firing on all cylinders, and showing 
great sonic and thematic restraint in the process. 



WAITING FOR THE NIGHT     by Tim DiGravina

David Gahan's hushed voice might dominate the musically minimal "Waiting for the 
Night," but the song's somber electronic tones and Martin Gore's harmonies emit 
a dark, touching cloud of their own. If one listens closely, Gore's voice 
matches Gahan note for note through a majority of the song, adding vibrato and a 
hint of unease. The song opens with spare, bubbly digital notes, as if one is 
under the spell of a futuristic art installation. Gahan and Gore sing repeatedly 
that they are "waiting for the night to fall." In the night everything is 
"bearable" and "all that you feel is tranquility." Gore's closing moans are 
stark and haunting. It seems safe to say that previous to Violator, "Waiting for 
the Night" wouldn't have been possible. Co-producer Flood's hand steadies 
Depeche Mode here, adding subtlety where before there may have been grit or a 
yearning toward realms more epic. That's not to say that Black Celebration and 
Music for the Masses aren't gorgeously arranged and executed albums, but there's 
a sense on Violator that every note and emotion is in its proper place. "Waiting 
for the Night" is a powerful representation of how expertly Depeche Mode 
balanced emotion and restraint in a sweeping musical vision at this point in its 
career. 



ENJOY THE SILENCE     by Steve Huey

Longtime underground favorites for their pioneering use of synthesizers in 
alternative rock, Depeche Mode finally scored their first (and only) Top Ten 
single in the U.S. with "Enjoy the Silence," the second single from their 1990 
best-seller Violator. "Enjoy the Silence" begins with a melancholy ballad feel 
in spite of the busy bass lines underneath; a clean-toned guitar plays a 
haunting melody over synthesizers mimicking a gothic choir. The electronic beats 
begin to kick in with greater prominence during the first chorus, and 
immediately afterwards there is a funky percussion break which alerts the 
listener to the song's rhythmic underpinning. When the rest of the 
instrumentation returns, it's suddenly just as danceable as it is gloomy. The 
lyrical subject matter of "Enjoy the Silence" is typical Depeche Mode bleakness, 
in this case with a more personal slant. Its main point is that the more people 
talk, the more likely they are to hurt each other, and so a sense of doom hangs 
over the romance alluded to in the chorus ("All I ever wanted, all I ever needed 
is here in my arms/Words are very unnecessary, they can only do harm"). On a 
deeper level, "Enjoy the Silence" suggests that getting to know someone more 
intimately destroys any romantic illusions about them, and the singer seems to 
prize those illusions as a form of perfection that doesn't exist in the outside 
world. It's a little solipsistic and all very dramatic, but the music supports 
those ambitions with a chilly sadness and an austere grandeur that perfectly 
expresses the sentiments of the lyrics. 



POLICY OF TRUTH     by Tim DiGravina

Taking hints from R&B, yet adhering entirely to Depeche Mode's stylish 
electronic swoosh, "Policy of Truth" is a silky smooth and funky highlight among 
highlights from Violator. More than perhaps anywhere else previous to the album, 
vocalist David Gahan effects a kind of sinister, romantic croon. It's a style 
he'd gravitate to again on Ultra and Exciter, though with perhaps more 
confidence and humor on those later albums. From its groovy opening to its jazzy 
dance club conclusion, "Policy of Truth" oozes an addictive, uneasy kind of 
suaveness. It's clear that the fuzzy, wobbly electronics come largely from Alan 
Wilder and Flood, as Violator is largely considered to be Wilder's album, and 
because so much of Violator's success stems from Wilder's masterful, edgy 
arrangements. Gahan isn't truly the star of the song, for better or worse, but 
because his voice takes a kind of background role, the smarmy keyboards, synths, 
and samplers absolutely bleed emotion and atmosphere. It's almost as if Gahan 
was told to find an indifferent mood, stick with it, and let the music take 
control. "Policy of Truth" feels experimental in construction, as electronic 
sounds ring out and disappear from just about every angle. But it's an 
experiment that resoundingly works. That it's difficult to imagine a more 
perfect lead-in for the startlingly sweet "Blue Dress" is just another example 
of how great an album Violator is, in both its songs and its sequencing.

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
