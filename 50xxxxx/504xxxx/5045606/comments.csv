,GreG975,2010-03-06T17:49Z,"""Copyright controversy:

In the autumn of 2009, Azerbaijani composer Eldar Mansurov contacted the Romanian Office for Copyright claiming the refrain of ""Stereo Love"" was a copy of a tune from his popular 1989 composition ""Bayatilar"". In the videoclip, the composer of ""Stereo Love"" was indicated as ""Anonymous"". Both the Office and Edward Maya later confirmed that Mansurov's work was in fact used in the making of ""Stereo Love"". Maya commented by saying he was ""fascinated"" by the accordeon version of ""Bayatilar"" he had come across on the Internet earlier in 2009 and claimed he had tried to contact the author but failed due to his busy schedule. On 19 January 2010, Edward Maya arrived in Baku, Azerbaijan, where he signed an agreement with Eldar Mansurov affirming their co-authorship of ""Stereo Love""."""
