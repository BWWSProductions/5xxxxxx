Young Buck needs to move on and focuse on hiz LP'z... But he cant release an lp..
Kuz that BITCH 50 wont release him. TIP tried to buy him out of his contract for 
2 mil... but 50 wants 8... 50 all about his paper!!! BUT that ain't never gonna 
happen... There are alot of pepz that don't like 50, and give Buck the pass by
because of it...
