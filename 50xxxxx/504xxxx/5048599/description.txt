Preserve The Culture presents "Real Hip Hop 101".

This mixtape is a re-issue from 2007 that is back by popular demand. This is the way mixtapes used to be before everybody had a home computer with Pro Tools or imitation DJ software. Much better than a compilation of songs with gunshots between them. Cop this and all future joints from us mawphucka!

Be on the lookout for new mixtapes from Preserve The Culture (PTC) and Vibal Beats, as well as the new Gritty Committee project.

Respect,
