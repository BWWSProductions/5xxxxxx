,synchro_w,2012-03-09T01:51Z,"unaired pilot episode? of series one? the richard 3rd period series with brian blessed? i don't recall them ever making an unaired pilot. the budget for the 1st series was bigger than almost all the other 3 series combined cos of rowan atkinson's popularity at that time. of course, we now know that elton and curtis' 2, 3 and 4th series were incredibly low budget but superbly written and acted but the 1st had an enormous cast, filmed on lots of expensive locations w highly detailed and expensive costumes... but an unaired pilot? this isn't the USA. and in the 1980s even less so."
