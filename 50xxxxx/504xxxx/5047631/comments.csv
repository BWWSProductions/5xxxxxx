The Video/Audio is 10/10 and you have my many thanks for such awesome quality

reliant1, I know you dislike Ep 18-19, but is there any way at all you can put them up.
Maybe as a separate torrent?
I really want to have the entire series and I dislike missing two episodes.
Espically such high quality videos as you have in your torrents.

,cutchya,2009-08-08T17:40Z,"Even if you don't like E18-19 wouldn't you consider uploading them for the good of the community?  Please bear in mind that many of us are collectors and although I personally (and many others from what I understand) really hate the final episode (22) our collections would simply not be complete without it.  

Also as a Trek-nerd I think you should know that the Dark Mirror theme has a long history in Trek.  There was an original series episode based on this, a Next Generation novel and a whole story arc involving 5 or 6 episodes in DS9.

Anyway it's better than nothing, thanks for sharing!"

Enterprise was the only series that was filmed and edited in high def. The other series (besides TOS) were all edited on video and not on film. They'd have to go back and re-do the effects for each episode. So there aren't any. =("
