,MrCyberdude,2010-05-11T07:20Z,"Monkey aka Monkey Magic - English version of Japanese version of 16th Century Chinese novel called ""Journey to the West""

This series was shown in Australia back in the 80's and has a cult following. The quality is better than I remember watching back then. It is in English and there are no subtitles (better than vcd quality)"
