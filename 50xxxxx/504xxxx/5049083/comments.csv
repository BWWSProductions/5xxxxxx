,kevmeister95,2009-08-09T19:45Z,"there was an adult comedy series made in Canada about 3 fictional characters who live in a trailer park in the east coast.  the 3 brothers in the show are named Ricky, Julian and Bubbles.  it's basically an independantly produced show (done in a mock-umentary style).  very funny BUT definitely for adults.  just google it and check it out.  I keep forgetting that a lot of people outside Canada don't get to see the show."
