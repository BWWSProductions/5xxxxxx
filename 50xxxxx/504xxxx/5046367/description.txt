R-TYPE DELTA:

It's the year 2163, and the Bydo Empire has resurfaced with new plans to destroy Earth. Bydo's Mortiz-G doomsday weapon has the capacity to eliminate the fair planet for good, and you stand as humanity's last hope. To save the planet, you'll commandeer one of three awesome ships: the R9a, which boasts an energy-dispersing cannon; the Rx, a ship that features wave cannons, a time disruption corridor, a chain reaction missile, and a tentacle force; and the R13, which uses a lightning cannon, a photon missile, and a claw-shaped anchor force. The game's seven broad, detailed levels all contain Force power-ups, which attach to your ship to help protect you against enemy fire. The more Force power-ups you collect, the more deadly your firepower will be. You'll battle Mecha-Bydo warriors throughout demolished streets, a run-down energy reactor, a space fortress, and a ripple in time. Can Earth count on you to have the bravery and reflexes to save mankind?

Want to get those conversions directly from the source instead of through "unsafe" torrent browsers? Come and request them at
