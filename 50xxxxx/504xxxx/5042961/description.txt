Slax 6.1.2 is here


It's finally here. What's new? Well, few bugs were fixed, KDE didn't change, FireFox 3.5.1 has been added (yes I know there is already 3.5.2, bad luck I didn't look just before the release).

That's not all. A new thing. But still very old, well known. Let me introduce ... WINDOWS SHARING ON THE DESKTOP! hehe :)

This Slax release adds an icon at the Slax desktop, which is labeled as 'Slax Drive'. After you click on it, you'll get a dialog for login and password. Don't be afraid, simply click the button at the bottom of the dialog to register your personal Slax drive. It's a network disk, you'll need Slax Account in order to register it. You'll get 30MB for free, just to test if this is something for you. If you like it, you may buy additional storage.

You may put there anything you like. I hope somebody will like it.

I'm not sure if this is even interesting for anybody ... we will see. Even if you don't like it, it's still a way how to support Slax financially - so if you have spare 3 dollars monthly, and I am sure you have, please consider buying the 1GB plan. Thanks! :)

The good news is (or is it a bad news?), you can Map your Slax Drive even in Windows. Just grab a tiny program SlaxDrive.exe (25KB) and map it as S: for example. Again, I hope somebody will find it useful. We will see :) In all cases, I would like to kindly ask you for comments, so I could see if you like the idea or not. Thank you!
