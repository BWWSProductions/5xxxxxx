If you find a crack for this maybe... :o)
Up to now even the v5.05 was using the cracked exe of v4,27, not the real crack from my point of view. Never seen a real crack for 5.05 or later. If you find one let me know..."

I've successfully unpacked Atomic Mail Sender 5.10 at the moment....> AsProtect 2.10 registered.
Now I am looking how to patch the app. to make it fully registered.
When I'm done I will upload it to TPB.
