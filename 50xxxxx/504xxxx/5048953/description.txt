Another classic movie by Christopher Lambert in his early days. He wasn't chopping heads off and spoke French at the time, hence the dual audio in the file. So here it it- enjoy whichever lingo you speak. The file is standalone DVD players compatible and will also work in BSPlayer and the like. Share & Enjoy!
