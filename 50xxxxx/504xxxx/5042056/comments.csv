,Bluedawg,2009-08-26T01:39Z,"I'm having a weird problem installing this patch on a Vista (SP2) machine. When the patch program runs, the ""laptop"" shows and the music plays, but the bottom row of buttons, the one with the ""patch"" and ""exit"" buttons, and even the ""check box"" on the left is missing. Clicking where it should be does nothing. Any ideas as to what's causing this, and more to the point, how to fix it? "

,isisx3,2009-10-22T21:55Z,"just letting everyone know, Norton 360 detected a virus in the patch. I was going to risk it and use it anyway since most patches and keygens get false positive given the way they execute confusing anti-virus programs but my norton refuses to let me unzip or un-quarantine the file... So... you decide for your self. "
,psycho12349,2010-09-02T09:10Z,Hey there is a virus that keeps popping up called W32.Heuristic. I just want to get a confirmation that this is a false positive.
