it is a trap . you have to control atl delete the browser if you click on any movies .  It is spam bad"
,max11max,2009-08-08T21:40Z,"Thanks to the uploads but!

One of the worst cams I have ever seen, audio is way over the top with low end bass. Goes out of focus every 10/15 seconds so you miss over half the film as you cant see what's going on..

Terrible.

A3/V3 Wait for a better version..."
,chedderz66,2009-08-09T10:13Z,"yeah, it does go out of focus quite a bit which is a shame.but overall for a cam, you can probably get through it ok and still enjoy it, although I did stop watching after about 30 or 40 mins or so when i realized just how much i was ""missing"", especially the action sequences Might actually go to the theatres for this one.  I still appreciate the upload though."
