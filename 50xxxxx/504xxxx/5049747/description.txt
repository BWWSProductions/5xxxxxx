Northern Star - Melanie C [1999]

What a surprise! Nobody would think this was a SPICE GIRL!!!! Melanie Chisholm 
first album is absolutely a very surprising album. You can notice is a debut 
album because there are so many styles in only 14 songs, but either way, you 
can't think about that in her quality, not only the voice, but the type of songs. 
Out of her 5 singles, Melanie C has dare to do beautiful songs not so commercial 
like "Closer", "Feel the sun", some of them more accoustical like "Be the One" or 
"If that were me". You'll feel British sound in songs like "Go!" or "Suddenly 
Monday" (this one is absolutely Beatle-styled). With songs like "Ga Ga" or "Goin' 
Down" you'll detect a more rocky sound and she can even sing R'n'B with Left Eye 
in "Never be the same again". THE BEST ALBUM OF 2000. More than 900,000 copies sold 
only in the UK is more than enough to get this Disc
