,menniemen,2009-08-22T21:09Z,"Hmph, maybe I must just re-upload it...

But I have deleted it already :P.
And I lost my CD..."
,menniemen,2009-08-22T21:55Z,"@ Ben, and others.

The Dx3Dx9_27.dll is gained from not having DirectX9 installed. Google it, and install it. When that doesn't solve the problem, go to my DLLFiles site(Especially set-up for game DLL's)

Here's the link:

Instructions are added in the .RAR file.

,themilkshakesula,2009-11-02T03:37Z,hey i have the same grayed out option problem help would be much appreciated
,sp0tty,2009-11-15T16:55Z,"hey dudes,

if you have problem with the greyed-out launcher it's because there is no registry entry for Oblivion (since you didn't really install it)

copy the following into notepad, change ""installed path"" to wherever you installed it, save as ""oblivion.reg"", and run it to add to the registry.

copy here>>
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bethesda Softworks]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion]
""Installed Path""=""C:\\Program Files\\Oblivion\\""

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion\1.00.0000]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion - Construction Set]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion - Construction Set\1.00.0000]"
,CopperStar,2009-11-17T02:53Z,"Works perfectly! Great stuff!

For those of you with greyed out links - the Launcher cannot find the game because of missing registery keys.
Just follow the uber-easy free instructions (to the letter - no changing location regardless of where your game is actually situated) here and in less than five minutes it is all enabled!

Easier than pushing over an old lady! ;D"
,themilkshakesula,2009-11-26T03:09Z,"Thank you so much, all the greyed out options are gone!!! but now i have a new problem it says launcher could not find the oblivion game excutable please reinstall!! any help would be helpful!!!!!!!!!!! "

Thanks ! "
,Kiloca,2009-12-13T00:44Z,"game works amazingly, no grey screen or any of that. but after a little bit of playing the computer just restarts, any ideas? any help is greatly appreciated, i love this game and would love to play it uninterrupted. if you have any solutions email me at kiloca@yahoo "
,L-i-m-e-r-i-c-k,2009-12-22T22:59Z,Are the plugins formatted like normal mods or are they integrated into the game already?
,deerpoob1,2009-12-30T14:18Z,"the reason all the options are grayed out is because the game isnt technically installed on the system, to work around this (if the registry edits dont work, or you dont want to mess with the registry) download the ""oblivion mod manager"" avalibe here

http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2097

that will allow you to start the game, and also work with the mods, even allowing you to load some you might not have before!"
,HighTechPirates,2010-01-15T12:20Z,that issue with the grey launcher is common and exist on other games to just guess where the play icon is or start the game manually
