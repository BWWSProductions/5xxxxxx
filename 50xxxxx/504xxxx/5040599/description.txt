    * Background folder scan. Background scan is effective the second time you start a slideshow, when exiting gPhotoShow saves current files list to a cache file. On next startup gPhotoShow starts to display images from the cached list in the meanwhile it scans the configured folders, when completed the list is synchronized and newly added files will be available for the slideshow.
    * Periodic files synchronization. If enabled gPhotoShow will periodically scan folders to find new files.
    * Each monitor can have its own timing. This option can be useful in some cases with multiple monitors setups, for example when one monitor is displaying a long video (or an image with its own timing) with this option enabled other monitors can continue to change images.
    * A new randomization option. When this option is selected gPhotoShow will choose the first file randomly, then subsequent files will be picked-up randomly in the same folder until when they are finished. At this point gPhotoShow will choose a new file and the process starts again.
    * Image index displayed over image during slideshow
    * Modified interface with VLC Media Player to fix compatibility problems with v0.9.x and improve integration with player
    * Minor bug fixes
