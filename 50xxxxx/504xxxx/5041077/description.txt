This is an installer, made by me, containing all 5 of the official downloadable content addons for Fallout 3.

Operation Anchorage, The Pitt, Broken Steel, Point Lookout, and Mothership Zeta.

Quick and simple to use and easy to store for backup. 
Just run and install to your fallout 3 folder.
Be sure to go to "Data Files" in the Fallout 3 launcher and place a check next to the addons.

This requires Fallout 3 to be patched to 1.7 - The patch is included.

Seed Please! Enjoy!



--EDIT:
 "For those having problems with the xlive.dll; it is not a problem with the turrent. You need to upgrade to the most recent version of the windows live software. Grab it for free here: http://www.microsoft.com/games/en-US/Support/Pages/technicalIssuesGuide.aspx"
