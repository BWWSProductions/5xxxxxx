thank you =D"
,mosbach,2009-08-06T20:07Z,What a waste of Bandwith.All this does is transforms a legit copy of Fallout into useless crap.Just patch and enjoy.I like to patch your Ass with my foot and kick it all over the planet.That i would enjoy.Fucking Retard.
,Keishikun,2009-08-06T20:14Z,"@mosbach
Because that rant made sense.

maybe instead of being a cock, you could explain what your issue is. However, from your incoherent ranting, im gonna guess you're just a troll."
,OmniNegro,2009-08-06T21:48Z,"I'll chime in on this too. PLEASE tell us what is happening. Most of TPBs users are decent and kind. We will try to help you if you simply explain what is happening to you.

If you choose not to accept that this may be true then to hell with you.

Have a ncie day and I hope things work out for you."
,mosbach,2009-08-07T06:47Z,"I followed your instructions to a t.This is not the first time that i have downloaded something. however,after patch installation it said that there were files missing in the library. Then the game would not start at all. Tried everything but it just froze. lost all my saved games and everything.that is why i am so pissed. so anyways i reinstalled and tried again. Then updated my game from legit update,just like the one you provided. And now it runs fine.Guess from now on i will get everything the legit way.Learned a hard lesson. And no am not a troll. Likewise have a good day."
,Keishikun,2009-08-07T08:05Z,"The patch is legit, its directly from the Fallout 3 website, i just downloaded it and added it to the torrent. However, it is for the US version, and if you are using a different version it may have caused issues. Though, it should have, in no way, touched your safe files. They are not even located in the fallout 3 folder. If they vanished, its because YOU deleted them - by accident or otherwise. 
Im sorry to hear you have had such an incident, but i can assure you it wasn't an issue with the patch I included. As i said, its directly from the fallout 3 website."
,Keishikun,2009-08-07T08:05Z,save files**
,Keishikun,2009-08-07T08:17Z,"PS:
It is also possible if you had unofficial mods installed before patching, that could have caused a major issue with your game crashing. A lot of unofficial mods only work under certain versions of the game, and if you patch up to a new version with mods activated that are not compatible with that version, this could cause your game to crash. 
Which would explain why it worked after you uninstalled it and then reinstalled then patched.
Just a thought."
,wallinho10,2009-08-07T16:20Z,Hey Guys i finished this download yesterday and installed it (checked all the add-ons too). today i tried to play it but right after i turned on the reactor of project purity (the last objective in the game without add-ons) i go into a medical room somewhere in the citadel i think. but whatever i do and how long i wait; the game just stays like that =( does somebody recognize this problem and have a solution for me? thank you very much!
,mosbach,2009-08-07T22:46Z,Thanks for the up.No hard feelings.
,Ruugab,2009-08-08T06:41Z,Does this work with the steam version of Fallout 3?
,InebreatedHobo,2009-08-08T11:00Z,For some reason I cant play broken steel. I can level up to 30 and all the perks work yet I cant continue after the main quest line. It wont let me finish the quest because it cant secure the room so it just shows the credits then exits back to main screen. (I'm using vista/i have the 1.7 patch/i use fomm and fose/i put all dlcs in correct load order using fomm.)
,mezmer1,2009-08-08T11:10Z,hey i got a problem. i downloaded it and i can't get it running. i mean that i double click on the icon and it does nothing. any ideas why that's happening?
,mezmer1,2009-08-08T11:18Z,"ok, i got it, sorry for bothering :)"
,InebreatedHobo,2009-08-08T11:19Z,nevermind about that cant secure the room thing. but i still cant play brokensteel
,InebreatedHobo,2009-08-08T11:23Z,sorry for three posts but i also have steam version on fo3
,Keishikun,2009-08-08T20:31Z,"@InebreatedHobo
A little more detail please. What exactly happens, how can you not play it?

(Spoiler)
If you use the FEV at the end, its game over and you cant continue on to the Broken Steel content."
,MoreBlud,2009-08-09T02:14Z,"So I successfully ran patch 1.7. But when I went to the program that installs the dlcs, I chose the wrong location (I chose the data folder within the Fallout 3 folder, not the fallout 3 folder itself). I had a data folder within my data folder. When I went to correct this by copy/pasting I screwed up somehow and I currently have no idea what was supposed to go where.

During the last cutscene of F3, I don't reawaken at the Citadel, like I'm supposed to with the broken steel dlc. It goes to credits like without the dlcs.

So what do I do now?


"
,Keishikun,2009-08-09T02:45Z,"@MoreBlud
You selected all the addons in the falout 3 launcher? By going to the ""Data Files"" and then placing checks next to them?
And did you use the FEV at the end? If so that would cause the game to go straight to ""game over""
I should note, if the addons are successfully/correctly installed you should get 3-4 popups in-game saying something about new radio signals found. They usually popup about 1-5 minutes after you get in game."
,MoreBlud,2009-08-09T03:14Z,"@Keishikun

Amazing. I read over that part that said to check off the addons. Thank you! I'm looking forward to these dlcs."
,mosbach,2009-08-10T17:28Z,"Just an update,i finally got everything working.Must have been a glitch in xp pro.I re-installed everything in windows 7,downloaded patch from site and then just added the mods.all works great now."
,insomniabob,2009-08-10T19:50Z,Can anyone tell me if this will work with a Steam version of Fallout 3? Haven't modded or installed anything to it before... kind of worried about it crapping itself.

Opened through launcher, selected all mods, launched game. Loaded to the part where I have to decide who goes in to activate the purifier. I waited for a few seconds.. and all the quest notifications came, including the level cap increment etc. of Broken Steel. I could even send my companion in to do it for me. But the problem comes from here.. whether I go or my companion, I always get the outro and then credits. My game never continues?
Another anomaly I noticed - whenever I tick all the mods in the data files and click ""ok"", it resets to only having the Fallout ESP and 3rd ESP in the list (it was anchorage, then I deleted it, so it became broken steel) tick marked. Is this supposed to happen? If the other mods somehow didn't get loaded, then how did I get the notifications in-game? Please help!"

,Keishikun,2009-09-15T22:01Z,"@jerk_shop & RaitoKunRyuk

Sounds to me like maybe your install shield is maybe out of date or broken. If not I honestly don't know what could be causing that.. Its worked fine for tons of people so far

@AryaNFirE2010
Could have been something to do with if you were playing with GFWL online or offline, possibly. Particular rips of the game could be at fault. I run a legit copy of Fallout3 so I'm not sure, haven't tested it on every rip available xD"

I've installed the patch, I DLed FOMM because it's been said that this will get around it (which it hasn't), and I've tried updating Games for Windows Live, but when the lengthy download finishes, the following security warning pops up: Windows has found a problem with this file. Name: gfwlivesetupmin.exe Publisher: Unknown Publisher... This file was blocked because it does not have a valid digital signature that verifies it's publisher. I push 'OK' and nothing happens. I REALLY want to play Fallout! A quick fix would not go amiss. Thank you."
,jackslash,2010-09-25T04:06Z,Do not download there is a coupon malware imbedded. Atleast that what i picked up
,CarbonVll,2010-09-28T18:20Z,how do i play the addons i check the DLC i want to play but when i load up my game i dont know what to do???
,domfontana,2010-10-28T05:13Z,"Do download this torrent. The other poster is mistaken.

First, thanks for the torrent. Nice job. I downloaded the whole thing in less than 10 minutes and I can verify that everything works perfectly.

Second, when you first start to install it, your anti-malware, may report a false positive. That means, it may ""warn"" you of a threat, but it's mistaken because there is no threat. That happens alot with torrents. Just click to Allow or Ignore it and proceed with the Installation.

Third, just follow the excellent directions that were provided here. In the decsription above, use the link to update Windows Live. It takes about a minute. Then, run the update from the torrent to update to ver. 1.7. Finally start the installer and it will install all 5 expansion packs. Install them to your Fallout 3 directory. Then, don't start the game yet. Use the Fallout 3 launcher program in your Fallout 3 directory. From there, select Data Files and a window will open. You will see Fallout 3 and the 5 expansion packs you just installed. Fallout 3 will already be checked. Just check the 5 expansion packs and close the window. Now you're all set. Start the game as usual and you will have the original game and all 5 expansions available to you.

Again great job and thank you. From the time I saw this torrent and downloaded and installed everything, it took about 20-25 minutes and I'm all done.

Very highly recommended."
,Aeronomer,2011-01-08T15:46Z,I agree with domfontana. I have the retail version of the game and this works perfectly. Great job. 
,northm,2011-01-30T21:34Z,"If you are running into the following problems after installing broken steel and/or other mods:

- mods not activating even after hours of gameplay
- red diamond shapes (textures/images not loading)
- cannot move upon starting broken steel
- cannot find Paladin Tristan
- lots more crashes than usual

YOU MUST upgrade to 1.5+ or 1.7. If you already have, CHECK THE VERSION NUMBER of your fallout3.exe file, it might not have upgraded properly EVEN IF YOU INSTALLED THE UPGRADE! This is especially common with 1.0.0.12. You will likely find that all these problems vanish when you finally get this file upgraded."
,Oroles,2011-02-08T14:56Z,"Thanks to the uploader for making this pack available, but I have a major issue regarding the patcher, and apparently there are many more other people having the same problem as me. I own an early retail version.

@northm

I hope you can help with this as I think you mentioned my exact issue. I have the early version of the game, 1.0.0.12, and whenever I run the updater, it just starts the game exe after loading, resulting in a non-responsive patching process. I have tried endless methods of bypassing this, as researched on the net, but to no use.

So, how can I bypass this game-starting-while-patching issue? Can anyone help? If not, it seems I'll be stuck to playing the original content only."
,HP-NRNS,2011-03-19T22:19Z,Works fine. Many thanks! :D
,dontpKaniC,2011-03-21T20:28Z,thanx alot but ive got a question how do i know that the dlcs are actualy working? do i need to finish the original game first? or is there some other way to verify that the dlcs are working?
,masonhales,2011-04-10T03:26Z,1mb+ dl speed. THANKS!!!
,ReallyReallyDumbGuy,2011-04-13T02:24Z,"Well, I've got an issue where I open the Data Files and check all the boxes, but it resets to just Fallout3 being selected no matter what I do. So then I tried only selecting Operation Anchorage, and then it tells me that ""Fallout 3 has stopped working.""

Also, I am running the Precracked Fallout 3 Reloaded by ictorrents."
,ReallyReallyDumbGuy,2011-04-13T02:28Z,"Hi, I'm running the Fallout 3 Reloaded by ictorrents and I've got an issue when I try to run the DLCs. I open the Data Files and I select all of them, but it always resets back to Fallout 3, then I tried only selecting Operation Anchorage, but the Fallout crashes on me. 

Any Suggestions?"
,ReallyReallyDumbGuy,2011-04-13T02:29Z,"Double post, my bad."
,MrAwesome123,2011-07-06T22:04Z,EVERYBODY !!! to play the mods install them with mod manager and go ingame and you will recieve the dlc quests
,Radbanshee,2011-07-28T21:21Z,Works like a charm. Thanks
,Trevoc,2011-08-03T15:27Z,"HEY! If you are having problems patching to 1.7 because FALLOUT STARTS UP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, then what you need to do is move both the fallout.exe and falloutlauncher to Data file while the patch installs. This makes it not start up and allows it to save the new changes. My launcher wasn't 1.7, but my .exe was. When I clicked on launcher, I click on data files and checked all the boxes, but I started up fallout with .exe---After about a minute or so I got barraged with radio broadcasts. This works perfectly! Thank you so much!"
