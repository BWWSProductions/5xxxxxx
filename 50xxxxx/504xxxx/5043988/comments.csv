,Alexoman,2009-08-10T15:32Z,"Don't bother downloading this sh#t. The installation will ""finish"" but it will not work. The game does not start,the patch does not install and the crack either. Don't waste your time like i did."
,Demonilith,2009-11-27T12:41Z,"Get this crap off the internet. Doesn't work at all, just a waste of time. Damn disappointing too..."
,FalseAccount,2009-12-15T08:04Z,"It wont work on Vista or windows 7. For some reason the newer systems cannot find the RTSERVER.DLL file, even though it is sitting right in the game directory. *shrug* You can try putting it on a windows xp, but seems any effort to put it on vista is wasted. I tried a bunch administrative loop holes, as well as googling solutions with no success. "

,chaotic82,2010-05-20T11:59Z,"Anyone still wanting to download a working copy of this game, come on over to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5574213/Pool_of_Radiance__Ruins_Of_Myth_Drannor.
 I didn't add the no cd patch or the latest game patch but you can go to the official site I think or there is some ""after market"" (lol) that you can use to find a update patch.  I guess there always is game copy world I think they have updates sometimes and that would be a good place to look for the no cd patch...."
,Dark_Salad,2011-08-07T03:30Z,"Thanks for wasting two of my dvds. I thought maybe I'd try it with actual dvd (instead of mounting) nope. I know they're cheap but... your a dick.
