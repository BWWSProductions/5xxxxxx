,didgesteve,2009-12-05T10:57Z,This is MKV format. Non standard and awkward to burn correctly.
,Pho2,2009-12-17T13:03Z,"Not fake and excellent quality, thanks for the seed."
,lancid,2010-02-14T21:05Z,"MKV is pretty much standard now. You can use mkv2vob to remux it, then burn it to play on the ps3.
