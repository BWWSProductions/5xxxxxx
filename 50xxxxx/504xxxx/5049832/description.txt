Scream if You Wanna Go Faster is the second solo album by British pop singer Geri Halliwell. It was released by EMI Records on May 14, 2001. 
Scream if You Wanna Go Faster was released as a single and is a cover version of the Weather Girls "It's Raining Men" (1983), which became Halliwell's fourth and (to date) final no.1 UK.
