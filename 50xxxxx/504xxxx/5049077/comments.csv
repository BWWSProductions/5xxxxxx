,head_banger,2009-12-16T22:57Z,"Great upload, however Power DVD won't play any of the DVDs when i choose ""Open movie file on hard disk drive"".
Perhaps some of the IFO or BUP files are damaged (maybe just my copies).
The VOBs work correctly.

Please, point me to the right direction!
I've been looking forward to it!"
,head_banger,2009-12-17T16:19Z,"Sorry!
My mistake = problem solved!

It turned out, that the name of  the directory, into which I have downloaded the torrent, was something Power DVD could not handle."
,KISSfan50,2010-04-19T20:59Z,"If you have problems with playing this with VLC or others, change the directory name, that'll fix it!!"
,Sanantta,2011-11-25T22:25Z,"Thank you very much, aivars.m.!!!"
,Thircase,2012-04-18T02:19Z,"The IFO files are corrupted, but still can be played well on computer. Burn software like Ashampoo will say is corrupted though.

Search for this torrent and repair it: AR7JI2D6ZE5ZPFULOYV2EJ25CBVFSYY

Greetings :)"
