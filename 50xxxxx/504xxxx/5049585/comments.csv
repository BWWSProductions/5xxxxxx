Sir when i heard the chirping birds i tought to my self ""No, this cannot be, no one could be as epic as to put Pink Floyd on their crack"". But then as the chirping progressed i heard jet engines and i felt as if i had been reborn into a creature capable only of orgasmic feelings. 

Thanks for the crack too."
