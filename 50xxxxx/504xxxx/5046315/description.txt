                    Depeche Mode - Exciter (Remaster 2007)
*******************************************************************************

This torrent contains both the Audio CD in its remastered stereo form, as 
released in 2007, plus a short video, which tells the story of DM during the 
era.  

The video is presented in XviD with .mp3 sound.  There are spanish and english 
subtitles already ripped and a subpack which also includes subs in Deutsch, 
FranÃ§ais and Italiano.  You have to rip it yourself (I currently use SubRip on 
Windows), in order to use them.

Note: There's no 5.1 audio here.  I repeat: there's no 5.1 audio here.  Only the 
2.0 stereo album remastered.  And sounds great!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Ned Raggett

It's rare to find bands capable of keeping their own best qualities to the fore 
while trying something new each time out, but Depeche Mode demonstrate that 
balance in full on the marvelous Exciter. Arguably the first album made by the 
group as a cohesive unit since Violator (and bearing some resemblance to that 
record in overall title and song names â€” compare "The Sweetest Condition" with 
"The Sweetest Perfection"), Exciter finds the trio again balancing pop 
catchiness with experimental depths. As with Ultra, an outside producer helps 
focus the end results in new, intriguing directions â€” in this case, said 
producer is Mark Bell, known for his work with BjÃ¶rk but also as part of Warp 
Records' flagship act LFO, which always acknowledged their own debut to Depeche. 
Bell's ear for minimal, crisp beats and quick, subtle arrangements and changes 
suit Martin Gore's songs beautifully. If there are few storming arena-shaking 
numbers this time out, the exquisite delicacy throughout is addicting, with 
Gore's guitar providing slippery and stinging leads to the smoky, romantic flow 
of Exciter. "When the Body Speaks" is a particular winner, his gentle work and a 
backing string section combining just right. David Gahan's voice, already 
audibly benefiting from lessons on Ultra, is even more supple and passionate 
than before, ranging from the fuller delivery on the snaky charm of "Shine" to 
the haunting album-closer, "Goodnight Lovers," a romantic lullaby with perfect 
counterpoint backing vocals. Gore's own singing remains equally fine, as does 
his lyrical obsessions on, well, obsession â€” "Breathe," which quotes more Bible 
names per verse than most preachers, makes for a good example on both fronts. 
When the band fully crank it up, the results work there too â€” "The Dead of 
Night" makes for a far superior nod to Gore's glam roots and Depeche's own 
industrial dance descendants than Songs of Faith and Devotion's "Rush" did.

                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exciter is Depeche Mode's tenth studio album, which was released on 14 May 2001 
in the UK and May 15 in the US. It uses more digital music technology compared 
to their other albums. It was produced by Mark Bell of BjÃ¶rk and LFO fame. It 
also had several songs which became big hits in clubs, like "I Feel Loved". The 
album also launched the Exciter Tour, which was one of the band's most 
successful tours.

Exciter debuted at #9 in the UK Albums Chart and debuted at #8 in the Billboard 
200 with sales of 115,000 copies. It's the only Depeche Mode's album to debut 
higher in the US than in the UK. As of July 2008, Exciter has sold 449,000 units 
in the United States and was certified gold there. Exciter also went gold in 
Canada, for shipments of 50,000 units. Today, Exciter has sold more than 3.4 
million units worldwide.

On October 2, 2007 (October 3 in North America) Exciter was re-released in a 
two-disc set, along with Ultra, in the fourth and final set of Depeche Mode 
reissues. The first disc was a remastered version of the original, on an SACD/CD 
hybrid (only a CD in the US). The second disc is a DVD which features the album 
in DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM Stereo. The B-sides from Exciter as well 
as the single version of "Freelove" are included. There are also audio versions 
of all the live Exciter tracks played during the One Night in Paris movie.

Like the other reissues, there is a documentary on the making of Exciter titled 
"Depeche Mode 1999â€“2001 (Presenting the intimate and delicate side of Depeche 
Mode)". The documentary begins with the talks of Martin Gore's writer's block 
and what they did about it. It also discusses the first three singles, the 
recording, the cover art and the Exciter tour (including one of the opening 
acts, Fad Gadget). The documentary is around 30 minutes long. The three members 
of the band are interviewed along with Daniel Miller, Christian Eigner, Peter 
Gordeno, Anton Corbijn, and Mute label representatives. The documentary ends 
with a "To Be Continued..."

Producer Mark Bell does not appear, and although they discuss the fact that the 
band declined not to have Corbijn direct Exciter's music videos, they do not 
mention or interview the two who did direct them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DREAM ON     	by Dave Thompson

The half ironic title says it all and, although writer Martin Gore obscures some 
of his meaning, there's little doubt about the main thrust of "Dream On". His 
song's protagonist, a fast-living, fast dissolving-into-disaster party person, 
resides in a world of pain, relieved only by the drugs she imbibes. "It sucked 
you in, it drugged you down," Dave Gahan sings, and truthfully, he could be 
speaking of his own experiences, as his â€œbeen there, overdone thatâ€ tone seems 
to serenade his own near self-destruction.

Gore's lyrical images are striking, his metaphors even more so, as he twists his 
words and meanings back in and around on themselves. "As your bony fingers close 
around me long and spindly, death becomes me," is one of his best and most 
thought provoking lines, while the musical base is equally intriguing, as the 
band play the evocative, acoustic guitar against the jittering, scratchy beats. 
The arrangement pushes at times into blues, but the rhythm puts paid to that, 
while the eerie effects further haunt the song's dark atmosphere. "Dream On" 
kicked off the group's "Exciter" album, and was the first spun off the set onto 
single, in May 2001, taking the band back into the British Top 10. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT WIKIPEDIA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DREAM ON

"Dream On" is Depeche Mode's thirty-sixth UK single, released on April 23, 2001 
in the UK and April 24 in the U.S. It was the first single from the album 
Exciter.

"Dream On" is an electronic based song mixed in with acoustic guitar and rough 
vocals, causing some people to falsely think of it as a country song. The single 
version starts with the guitar, while the album version has David Gahan saying 
"Can you feel a little love?" before a minimal electro beat opens the song.

The B-side is the instrumental song "Easy Tiger". While the Exciter version is a 
short interlude, the "Full Version" has an extended intro and continues the song 
with a similar melody underlined by a beat.

The music video for "Dream On" was directed by Stephane Sednaoui. One of the 
special parts of the video is that it was filmed on Route 66, which is also a 
Bobby Troup song that the band covered in 1987 for the "Behind the Wheel" 
single.

On June 26, 2001, the band played "Dream On" on The Late Show with David 
Letterman.



FREELOVE

"Freelove" is Depeche Mode's thirty-eighth UK single, released on November 5, 
2001 in the UK and December 11 in the U.S. It is the third single for the album 
Exciter.

David Gahan prior to Exciter called it the best song he's ever sung since 
"Condemnation".

The single version of "Freelove" is completely remixed from the album version. 
The mix was done by Flood, who produced the albums Violator and Songs of Faith 
and Devotion. Flood's return is quite surprising, as he previously wanted to 
never work with the band again after the strenuous experience of recording Songs 
of Faith and Devotion, during which the band was in-fighting with each other.

The B-side is an instrumental called "Zenstation".

There is also a DVD release of "Freelove", a first for Depeche Mode. It 
contained video footage of "Freelove" from the Philadelphia concert in 2001, as 
well as audio of some of the other songs. It also contained four bonus 30-second 
videos of the band. The videos were directed by Anton Corbijn.

The main music video for "Freelove" was directed by John Hillcoat. It is not 
available on a public release.



I FEEL LOVED

"I Feel Loved" is Depeche Mode's thirty-seventh UK single, released on July 30, 
2001 in the UK and July 31 in the US. It is the second single for the album 
Exciter.

"I Feel Loved" was played live during most of the Exciter Tour but was pulled 
halfway through the Europe leg for unknown reasons. On August 7, 2001, Depeche 
Mode performed "I Feel Loved" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

The B-side is a cover of the Stooges' "Dirt".

The music video was directed by John Hillcoat.

There are four versions, one that uses the "Single Version", but with a cold 
ending, rather than the fading out ending. There are remix videos by Dan-O-Rama, 
a long version, and a short version. The two remix versions are composed of 
modified production shots of the original video. The original version wasn't 
released on a public video until The Best Of: Volume 1 was released in 2006. The 
other two aren't on a public release. A version using the Danny Tenaglia Radio 
Edit of the song also exists, but was pulled from the official website and the 
label's effort to promote it were scrapped.

The original video features Depeche Mode performing in a club. The setting makes 
for a hot, sweaty ambience. The club is stormed by policemen with dogs, 
apparently trying to close down the gig. The audience, however doesn't seem to 
mind the intrusion and some girls play with the dogs.




GOODNIGHT LOVERS

"Goodnight Lovers" is Depeche Mode's thirty-ninth UK single, released on 11 
February 2002. It is the fourth and final single for the album Exciter.

"Goodnight Lovers" is a lullaby of sorts, a strange choice for a single that 
surprised many fans who were expecting "The Dead of Night" or "The Sweetest 
Condition". It was also surprising as the song was not played live during the 
Exciter Tour, making it the first single that wasn't played live at its album's 
tour since "Little 15" (It was later featured in the encore of Touring the 
Angel). The single version is the same as the album closer from Exciter.

The single did not qualify for the UK Singles Chart because it had excess songs. 
Singles with more than one unique track need no more than three tracks, while 
this single had four. The B-sides are remixes of "When the Body Speaks", "The 
Dead of Night", and "Goodnight Lovers". However, it did qualify for the Budget 
Albums Chart and went straight to Number One before falling rapidly, the first 
Depeche Mode single to reach Number One in an official UK chart.

The UK only had a CD release, but there were other European countries that got a 
12" release, their tracklists are all the same. The single was not released in 
the USA.

The music video for "Goodnight Lovers" was directed by John Hillcoat, filmed in 
Germany following the final Exciter Tour concert in Mannheim. It is not 
available on a public release.

                      IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ (A REQUEST)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
