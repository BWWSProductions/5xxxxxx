This torrent is for the 5th Fallout 3 DLC, Mothership Zeta. This takes place upon board an alien spaceship after you beam on board. You'll have to fight the aliens and their robotic army alongside other captives, and even spacewalk. I am not sure if 1.7 is necessary. But, as all it does is add achievements, I can safely say that it probably won't require the 1.7 update.
