,sharebird,2009-08-19T01:02Z,"There is a discussion here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5052418/Total_Commander_7.50_RC1_Portable

that the Thinstall app used to generate these portable apps is infected... The apps themselves are scanning clean, but when they run they unpack a svchost.exe, usually as part of a file open dialog.  

We appreciate NoExcuses' efforts and don't want to undermine them, but right now all of his portable apps are suspect.

: (

Sorry mate, but you might want do do what fredpc did, download a different copy of thinstall.

Just wanted to spread the word, because this particular virus hides itself very well."

This is NOT a Thinstalled program. Stop putting this silly comment in any upload... :-("
,criminalverse,2009-09-03T00:17Z,Works Fine for me DUDE :)
,DarkStormz999,2009-09-11T23:38Z,"Seems to be working great for me. Found a total of 15 missing/old drivers, and updated them easily. 

I like how you can see the status of the download too.

The readme in the Crack folder was very self explanatory, the crack worked great, the serial is legit. 

Thanks much for the upload!"
,Chili287,2009-09-17T21:49Z,Does this thing update for Windows 7 yet?

,iSze,2009-10-01T08:21Z,"Here's some words of wisdom...

OK, so we've got about 10 comments here, right? Yeah about that, give or take a few. Ok juist give. Anyways, I'm here to help you out by letting you in on a little secret. Well, it's not so much a secret. Those of you who were born with the rare ability to percieve things on a basic level... I believe the technical term for this ability is ""common sense"", though I can barely understand it myself. Y

ou see, there is something going on here... something within the comments... a pattern. It's very complex but as I said before, if you were born with common sense, you should already see it. Please note that it may take a bit longer for E-tards and Backbreakers as well; let's just call the Backbreakers ""Acid Heads"". The flashbacks might slow them down yet even they should figure figure it out before the retards. So who are the retards? The retards make up the group of users above my comment. So, you're no doubt wondering what the hell I'm fucking talking about, and/or where I'm going with all of this. And what makes all the users above so retarded? They're the same exact person, you see. Creating multiple tpb-accounts isn't by any means original... alot of kids do it b/c they have low self-esteem. Or Daddy doesn't love them. Or they've never been laid. It's all the same guys. Unlike the usual 14 year-old boy plagued with low self-esteem (aka skinny british kid w/ thick glasses and a severe masterbation problem), our friend here created over a DOZEN different accounts, and posting comments that supported this torrent, and why he would do suc ha thing is beyond me, but there is no mistake... just read the comments above and you'll see what I mean. Now for the hard part... whoever can answer the final question to this mystery gets a free, all-expenses-paid, chance of a lifetime, absolutely insane opportunity to... post the answer to this final mystery RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW on TPB! Only one lucky pirate will win this absolutely unheard-of opportunity, to post the name of the user responsible for the creation of all these user accounts... the name of the clown who commited such a heinous act against newborn user accounts. 15 of them! He killed them... all because of the deep, unwavering love he held towards his life's greatest passion.... updating sound card drivers. I salute you, young humble pimp(s)...

...cause this software is a fucking joke."
[V],NoExcuses,2009-10-09T20:41Z,"@iSze
I've read all your long comment, reaching the point to think that the last time I was making such kind of talk was after drinking about ten glasses of a pretty good sangria, and as in these time there was no keyboard near me, my friends were thinking to kill me  to make me stop.
Sorry for you, but I have no time, and less desire, to create multiple accounts and use them to go around to say in my uploads how good they are. At the end my only way to judge how good is an upload is to see how many continue to seed them day after day, and this one seems to have a good persistence.
I probably don't have a life, spending my free time trying to make portable the programs that seem interesting for me, but at least I waste my time way better than you, thinking to write such comments around. You better find something more satisfying to fill your days..."
,Arklite,2009-10-24T09:37Z,This doesn't work once you update drivers.

,e-dry,2009-12-06T14:24Z,"Thnx mate, this program works fine for me!

remember folks, that when you installed, copy pasted the crack to the install map and then open the program itself, it asks ''would you update because it's been longer than 30 days'' or some kind of message.fill in no because if you update the program first and then register the key won't work anymore!so make sure you register the program before you update to newer version!"
,rogamosh,2010-08-08T00:26Z,"NoExcuses, You Are The Best But What I Like Most About U Is

U Don't Put Your Files In A RAR Or Zip File So We Can Download Just What We Want....

And U Also Provide Both The Portable Version Along With The Setup And Serial....Thanks From All Of Us Buddy....."
,Sk8genius,2010-10-09T19:38Z,"Thanks a bunch NoExcuses!

Remember guys, if you want to install it, what I do is:
1) Turn off internet
2) Run the installer
3) DO NOT LAUNCH DriverGenius
4) Replace the .exe with the cracked one included in the torrent
5) Start up DriverGenius
6) Perform a scan
7) When it asks you for the registration key, enter the one provided
8) ENJOY!"
,Sk8genius,2010-10-09T19:40Z,"Oh, by the way, you can turn the internet back on after the 5th step. AND when it asks you if you want to update, select no."
,NosNos22,2010-10-29T09:21Z,"sit man I downloaded a similar program and it made my pc act weird especialy after writing a comment on a tutorial on youtube.. pphhhh serious man.
I think the goverment and FBI CIA and cartel industry orginizations are into this thing they collect personal information (like what sites youv been what files you have games credit card number and if your a terrorist etc.)
as for noexcuses his just multiple user as has been said by iSze (which could be NE too sit) and edry (yes too man), but hes just a small fish. but the bad part is that we could be making wrong to him and that is simply because we have no information!!!!!"
,NosNos22,2010-10-30T18:54Z,sit man again! i downloaded driver magician from NE and it was the only one that worked from a milion downloads that i tried.. so sorry NE it seems that isze is the pretender.
,NosNos22,2010-11-16T07:25Z,shit.. it worked but uploaded a virus deep into my system that i cant delete till now. well no wonder it worked
,craigbrian,2011-06-05T09:02Z,"AWESOME MAN!!!! works 100% thank you
it found the problem iv'e been trying to fix with my Bluetooth adapter"
,lilome,2011-07-11T06:52Z,"I just came on looking for a program like this cause my Emachine D525, DVD-RW-RAM drive stopped reading burned disks . It's not listing it as a dvd drive , but as standard cd drive. The windows updates & the Emachine update tool have not worked so I went looking for a fix & found this. My drive is a Hitachi GT-30N DL CD-DVD-RW/Ram multiburn. I will download, scan it & install it then get back with the results. I just did a complete recovery from the recovery partition so I have nothing to lose if I get infected. I'll just do another. Comes with all the 60 day trials , even Antivirus software. So here goes.     "
,jrock84,2011-09-02T22:49Z,"It's good, it works fine, just dont update after switching the crack. Don't listen to isze he's got his panties in a tangle. I hope you didn't waste ur time reading his long sob story. Thanks for the upload NoExcuses."
,Zwicky,2011-10-11T02:07Z,Thanks for sharing !! Works Great windows 7 64bit
,ashishrane,2012-06-20T06:36Z,"Thanks NoExcuses. Just install the software without internet first followed by crack. It will ask for update. Just say no. Then, run a scan.  It will ask for reg key.  Apply the registration key provided.  After that you can update Driver Genius.  It was ask for serial key once again. Just ignore it.  Then apply the crack once again and you are good to go.  I found out this solution.  It worked.  Updated all my drivers without problem."
