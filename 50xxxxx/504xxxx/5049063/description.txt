Greatest Hits is a hits compilation by Robbie Williams, released in 2004.  The album is his 7th released in the United Kingdom. becoming the fastest selling greatest hits album ever released in the United Kingdom, where it debuted at the number-one spot with first week sales over 320,000 copies  The album hit the top spot in 18 other countries. To date the album ended up selling slightly under 8.5 million copies becoming one of Williams' best selling albums ever.

All the hits are here, except for his initial solo outing "Freedom", and itâ€™s interesting to see how his sound evolves from wannabe Britpop buffoon on the sub-Oasis pubrock of "Old Before I Die" to the subtle captivating melodies of "Feel" and "Come Undone". There are so many great tracks that itâ€™s impossible to list them all, but highlights have to be the barnstorming "Let Me Entertain You", the bouncy, floor-filling "Rock DJ" and the song that madeth the man, "Angels".

It included two new songs, these being "Radio" and "Misunderstood", which were both released as singles."Radio", the compilation's first single, was released in October 2004, debuting at number-one of the UK Singles Chart (becoming Williams' sixth number-one hit) selling 41,732 copies. The album's second single, the ballad "Misunderstood", was included in the soundtrack of the film Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason and hit the top ten around the world in December of that year.
