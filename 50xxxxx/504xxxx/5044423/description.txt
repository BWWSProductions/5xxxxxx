-- White Light / Black Rain: The Destruction Of Hiroshima And Nagasaki --

"One hopes it is not too late for the world to listen and learn." - Los Angeles Times

In August 1945, the world was transformed in the blink of an eye when American forces dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, causing unprecedented destruction, and precipitating the end of World War II.

In this extraordinary HBO Documentary Film, Academy Award-winning filmmaker Steven Okazaki (Days of Waiting), presents shocking archival footage, stunning photography and heart rendering interviews - from both Japanese survivors of the attacks and the Americans who believed their involvement would help end a brutal conflict - for a deeply moving look at the painful legacy of the first use of nuclear weapons in war.
