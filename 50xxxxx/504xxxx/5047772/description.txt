The J-League is in focus once again when Konami ships the latest edition of their renowned J-League Winning Eleven game for the Playstation 2. With the way the market is headed, this may be the final J-League title on the PS2 which has survived for nearly a decade in the rough and tumble video game market.

A total of 36 J-League teams are featured in JLWE 2009 CC including three new inductees as follows: Tochigi S.C. from Utsunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture, Katare Toyama which is a recently merged team that's comprised of ALO's Hokuriku and YKK AP F.C., and Fagiano Okayama F.C from Okayama Prefecture. All three teams play in the J-League Division 2. In addition to the three new teams, a total of five new stadiums have been added: Saitama Stadium 2002 (World Cup), Sapporo Dome, Osaka Nagai Stadium, Tochigi Green Stadium, and Momotaro Stadium. To bring the world a little closer together, the game also features 118 foreign teams from the Italia League, the England League, Spanish League, and Portugal League which allows players to set up dream matches between marquee clubs. The team and player data in the game is current as of April 10, 2009.
