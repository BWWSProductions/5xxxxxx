,xXxEclipsexXx,2009-08-12T19:33Z,"doesn't work. Downloaded, can't extract. Even ISO. the file to be extracted and mounted, still leads to a file needed to be extracted that doesn't extract either."
,xXxEclipsexXx,2009-08-12T19:36Z,unknown format or damaged
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-08-21T18:54Z,"try using magic iso v5.0 or above or power iso v4.3 or above looks like you are using outdated software ""xXxEclipsexXx"""
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-08-21T18:59Z,"@xXxEclipsexXx
you can convert images to iso using magic iso v5.0 and you can mount the image with that software too my guess is you are using alcohol120%"
,segree,2009-08-23T23:29Z,"I only have a 64bit VGA so this game is what I've been searching for a really long time.

If you use magic ISO, please remember that you also will need to get the magic disk in order to mount the ISO file. 

ANyhow, I'm downloading it now so i'll post back later and let ya'll know if it works or not. If it doesn't work for me that mean it wont work for anyone ;)"
,VicRattlehead27,2009-10-27T16:51Z,"This works 100% for me. If you run into any problems, the fault is on your end. 

This is by far, the best tactical FPS I have ever played. I suggest everyone downloading this to install it this way instead:

1. Ghost Recon
2. Desert Siege expansion
3. Island Thunder expansion
4. Patch 1.4 (you won't need patch 1.3 if you have Island Thunder installed)
5. Apply crack

I also noticed that the Desert Siege ISO isn't properly compressed like the other ISOs in this torrent but it works perfectly fine so it doesn't really matter."
,bigsip,2009-11-24T04:07Z,I was able to install the game including the patches. The only thing I cannot find is the patch . exe. where is it? I looked in all the folders that came with the download!
,bigsip,2009-11-24T04:08Z,I mean crack . exe
,VicRattlehead27,2009-11-27T15:11Z,The crack is in Ghost Recon.iso
