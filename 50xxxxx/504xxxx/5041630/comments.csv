,dougaldog2002,2009-08-04T18:54Z,"There's a reson for people not trusting you, TT. You're a first time poster with something nobody else has. There are major players who would have got hold of this file much earlier than you possibly could have and not even they have it. Most will now wait until some genuine feedback on the legitimacy and quality of this U/L."
,dougaldog2002,2009-08-04T21:53Z,This appears to be a legitimate U/L. Definitely not a Screener rip. I'd hazard a guess that it's a half decent TS.
,dougaldog2002,2009-08-05T17:00Z,"Thanks for changing the file name from SCR to TS :-) 

Congrats on your first up, looks to be quite successful!
