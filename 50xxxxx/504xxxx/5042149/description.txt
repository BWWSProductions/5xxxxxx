U2 - 360Â° Tour
Nice (France)
Parc des Sports Charles Ehrmann
2009-07-15


lineage: uni-directional (cardioid) stereo microphones MM-MCSM-5 + MM-CBM- Battery ---> Edirol R-09 24 bit/48 kHz ---> 16 bit/44.1 kHz ---> WaveBurner (eq)---> Amadues II (track split) ---> xAct ---> Flac level 8 > WAV (TLH) > Apple Lossless (iTunes 8.2.1)

note: In a couple of songs the sound is affected by some distorsion (not too much) but it was in the PA probably only on my side (South - on the right). I hear clearly those problems when I was there. Anyone who have got the same feeling?
