Many fan comics set in the Touhou world; the realm of Gensokyo (literally
Illusion Village or Fantasy Village): a place where magical and spiritual
qualities prevailed over science and where yÅkai and humans coexist,
more or less peacefully.  The only known gateway from the outside world
into Gensokyo is the Hakurei Shrine has it connects the illusion village
to Japan. However, the seal has weakened and more humans are able to wander
into Gensokyo from the outside.

Even if the original setting is from a series of games the stories can be
enjoyed also by people who never played them.


Slow upload speed, but I'll keep seeding at least until there are other seeders.
