                                 CITY OF STEEL-CARRIER
                                -----------------------




The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier is unquestionably the world's most powerful warship. Fully loaded she displaces 97,000 tons, boasts a four-and-a-half-acre flight deck that is as long as the Empire State Building is tall, and is run by nuclear reactors that can go twenty years without refueling.

How does such a mind-boggling vessel rise up out of molten steel? Witness every critical step in the construction of the USS Harry S. Truman. Time-lapse filming at Newport News Shipbuilding captures this seven-year odyssey from computer models to final fittings. Learn how engineers, machinists, construction supervisors, and others bring hundreds of subsystems together under infinitely precise requirements. Finally, stand alongside top brass for Truman's grueling sea trials to learn if she will prove herself worthy to join her sister supercarriers of the U.S. Navy.
