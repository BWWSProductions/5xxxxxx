and your bitching about what exactly? who stole it first?

What do you get if you steal it first? the nobel prize? a medal? money? a lap daance for fucks sake

geezus....how old are you people exactly? are you seriously having this argument...neither of you own it...you BOTH fucking stole it"
[V],maestral,2009-08-29T22:18Z,"From my experience DUQA is trusted, i find few older movies DVD rips, which doesnt exist anywhere on net anymore, plus Piratebay is not beginning nor the end of torrent world so did any of you considered that DUQA maybe upladed this torrent somewhere before TPB and it was taken from there??? And this discussion is too much.

DUQA i trust you its DVDrip, never was wrong and if you say its premiere theres more than 90% chance that it was.

Cheers & Thanx"
