,scottyscum,2009-08-13T06:08Z,"Sorry about this being dead, I've been having some serious problems with my computer. When I try to up a file, the image code doesn't appear, so I can't upload. Until I can figure out just what the hell the problem is, there is nothing I can do about it. Good thing is though that you can go to the Random Touch website, and all of them are posted there for free. The download speed is really good, so it might actually be faster than getting them from this torrent. I posted them here for convenience, and to expose them to people who don't know the group. So yeah, just go to their website. As for my other torrents that are dead, well, don't know what to say. "
