I stumbled across these on the internet, free from Random Touch's website. These are really cool videos from the avant garde performance group Random Touch. I know you can get these for free, but if you have never heard of this group then, well, check them out. I will certainly be buying something from this group because I'm really impressed with just the free stuff. Enjoy!
