One of the greatest westerns of all time in which Clint Eastwood plays the man with no name who teams up with another bounty hunter (Lee Van Cleef) in order to find hidden gold.

This version has been newly re-edited and includes additional scenes which increases its length by some 18 minutes.

A masterpiece of the spaghetti-western genre and the last of the 'dollar trilogy', it was filmed entirely in Almeria, Spain.


Enjoy and Seed!!
