,stankyhankypanky,2009-09-09T01:11Z,This torrent works fine.  When you first open the executable it shows you that continue shit... and enter license info here bullshit.  This is a trick by the programmers.  If you run the bat file it ads a command line modifier to the .exe which allows you to use the REAL info.  (the .bat does this for you) Learn 2 read and follow instructions.
