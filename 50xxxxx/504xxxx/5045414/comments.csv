,otacon2940,2009-08-08T23:43Z,"Great upload man, works great, no bugs or anything. One thing though I downloaded this thinking I could make a Deck and play it against the computer or other people.....not so much. Turns out its just making decks to print or just have :/ Anyways that would be the developers problem not the uploaders....again, nice work."

This is still playable, by the way."
