Notes

Alright folks, the toolbox has been popular, and here are the beginnings of version 2.0
This is the list of recommended programs so far; all these won't necessarily be included.
If anyone has anything to say pro or contra about an entry, or it's inclusion, please post your comments.

This list will be finalized and the actual torrent created once a list is decided

---
a preconfigured EAC is in the works. I'd encourage everyone to link to guides they like, so that we can come to an agreement on best settings.
---
would everyone like this to be like the portable version, blend them into one, or have both?
---

I forgot to mention that from now on, the toolbox will be both a list of recommended programs discussion and input from users, and an actual torrent.
at this point there are still good arguments for including them and for not including them. feedback on your preference would be appreciated.

listing url pro: links to official, current release; doesn't add to torrent size
including in torrent pro: all the work is done, if the user has to follow the link and get 8 tiny programs that would be in the torrent anyway, then including them saves allot of time.
con: constantly updated torrent to reflect new versions. seeders loose their torrent when new one upped. (if we delete/dupe the old one)
---
including url files would be another way to go as well.
