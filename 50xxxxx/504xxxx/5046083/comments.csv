The mark of the tooth."
,sw40cal,2010-07-06T17:16Z,"2thMark, you're welcome. I wish I could get the MP3 collection torrent uploaded, apparently the torrent file itself is too large."
,2thMark,2010-08-20T23:10Z,"If you can upload 117GB of videos, I'm sure you can manage MP3. This has gotta be the best torrent for any serious Bible-believing christian! May God uplift you in all areas of your life for you have helped spread the Gospel. Jah bless....look forward to your next upload!!"
,sw40cal,2010-12-26T00:39Z,"2thMark, for some reason the torrent file for the MP3 collection is too large, something about too many file names inside the torrent, since there's a lot of MP3s in it not rar'd up... however, its on bitjunkie, look for the kenneth hagin audio collection, over 40gb in size"
,2thMark,2011-01-10T08:52Z,sw40cal. Thanks for the info and Happy New Year! Will check out the referrenced site.

Now to see if I can get this one."
