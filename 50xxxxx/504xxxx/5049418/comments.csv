,jaspyrnyte,2009-08-10T05:31Z,"This was a completely fan made film, meant to pay tribute to the books and films (as well as, i'm sure, show off the directing/effects/and acting talents of those involved). It's entertaining, very much in the spirit of LOTR...and also available to watch in HD at http://www.thehuntforgollum.com/
