The Courier (Ireland, 1988)

Possibly the worst Irish movie of all time. As a result, unmissable.


When a courier at the D-Day Courier Service mistakenly finds a pile of money in his regular delivery, he does some digging only to discover that the messenger company is a front for a drug ring. A reformed drug user himself, he sets out to crack the lethal ring.
