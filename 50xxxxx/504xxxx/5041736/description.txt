This is a folder w/10 techno tracks that were downloaded from a very reputable site so I figured If I paid for them...why should you!  

DJ Music (full length traks...no cutoffs) I use this stuff with traktor scratch

Please seed forever...and I will keep them coming...I have about 2000 techno, tech house, electro house, and other good traks to upload but I wanna see how the seeding goes with these first.

This stuff spins at around 130 BPM just in case anyone wanted to know.

SEED IT YOU LEECHES!!!
