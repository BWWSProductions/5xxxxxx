If for some reason you cannot get a seed for these torrents, there is a FAST server located here:

66.90.104.17 port 6878

If you add that server, your download will go MUCH faster! The fast server listed above cannot make direct connections to TPB trackers because it is blocked somewhere. It crosses a Comcast network in order to reach TPB, so I am betting that is where the trouble is... but that is just a guess.

There are also web download options for all of these videos on the server listed above. You may find them at the link below, but please only download using the torrent unless you cannot get a seed for some reason. You may use the web downloads as torrent seeds!

PLEASE share this video with the world!!!


I recorded this myself at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, U.S. on May 30th, 2009.


This video is 2 hours 2 minutes of incredibly good material that is definitely not shown on U.S. corporate controlled media! This video does a great job at exposing the U.S. propaganda about Venezuela and Latin America!

This is definitely must see material, especially if you live within the United States!!!

For example, please read this excellent article written Aug. 5 by the host of this panel:

"Venezuela: Socialism for the 21st Century"

This is a panel discussion with Eva Golinger and Evergreen State College professors and students discussing Venezuela, U.S. Intervention and Media Control. The video also includes MartÃ­n SÃ¡nchez, CÃ³nsul General of Venezuela.


Eva Golinger is a famous author and attorney. To find her books in a local library, search worldcat. Here is a convenient link to find her books:

As you may already know, the United States has a lot of ties to the coup in Honduras. Eva Golinger has written several excellent articles about this subject. Considering the extensive research that she has done concerning the United States role in the coup in Venezuela, I would pretty much consider her to be an expert in this area. I trust that what she has written about Honduras to be nothing but the truth.
