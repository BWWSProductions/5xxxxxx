<<<<-------------------*** ESET Smart Security 4 ***-------------->>>>>>>>>>>


Using our advanced ThreatSenseÂ® technology, ESET Smart Security proactively protects you from new attacks during the critical first hours when other vendors' products are not even aware the attack exists. ESET Smart Security detects and disables both known and unknown viruses, trojans, worms, adware, spyware, rootkits and other Internet threats.



<<<<<<<-------------------*** Features Overview ***-------------->>>>>>>>>>>>


Key Benefits

Protection from the Unknown â€” Its heuristics detect the least amount of false alarms in the industry, and finds malware other antivirus products miss.

Built for Speed â€” ESET Smart Security is lightning fast, so fast you won't even notice it's there. Even disk-intensive operations like performing a "full disk scan" run smoothly in the background while you work or play.

Easy on Your System â€” ESET Smart Security is "lean and mean," using just 48 MB of memory, a fraction of what other products consume. Because it's fast and "light," upgrading your existing Internet security to ESET Smart Security can literally be like buying a new computer. And laptop users can rejoice in the new automatic energy-sipping battery mode.

Easy on You â€” From its compact and intuitive user interface to its minimal use of alerts, self-training firewall, and other new features, ESET Smart Security is easier to use than ever before.



Version 4 Features

Smarter Scanner â€” Threats don't always enter in ways you expect. ESET Smart Security inspects SSL-encrypted communication channels like HTTPS and POP3S, and intelligently scans compressed files to find threats that other products miss. ESET's Smart Optimization feature makes file scanning faster than ever.

Time-saving Firewall â€” The new Learning Mode saves time by automatically creating firewall rules by observing how you use your computer, while offering advanced firewall modes for power users.

Upgraded Antispam â€” ESET Smart Security now takes care of annoying spam with a smaller, faster, and even more effective spam filter.

Removable Media Security â€” Threats can enter your PC from removable media such as USB thumb drives. For self-running media, ESET Smart Security scans autorun.inf and associated files on mount, in addition to scanning any file on any removable device when it is accessed, or during a full-scan of the media. Power users can adjust ESET Smart Security to perform additional levels of scanning on removable media.

System Tools â€” ESET SysInspector and ESET SysRescue simplify diagnosis and cleaning of infected systems by allowing deep scans of system processes to find hidden threats, and creating bootable rescue CD/DVD or USB drives to help you repair an infected computer.

Self Defense â€” ESET Smart Security has built-in technology to prevent malicious software from corrupting or disabling it, so you can rest assured your system is always protected.

Usability Improvements â€” ESET Smart Security has numerous speed, security and usability upgrades.

Energy-sipping battery mode extends laptop battery life without compromising security
Advanced Protection Status screen informs you of detected threats
Information pop-ups are hidden when running full screen applications like games, video players or presentations
Password protection prevents ESET Smart Security from being uninstalled by strangers
New interface and keyboard shortcuts simplify use for visually impaired users
