,ghandi253,2011-12-14T03:34Z,"A/10 V/10. Great up, bro. And don't listen to inkedbarbie. That chick has no idea what she is talking about. There is indeed sound. She just needs to get the proper codec for her media player, or just use VLC media player. 

@inkedbarbie-Next time make sure your stuff works before you try to bad mouth someone's upload. Plus, other dl's stated it worked fine long before you said the sound didnt work. Maybe a clue you're using a shitty media player? Besides, how the hell does it take you 3 days to download 7.5GB? What? Are you using a bonded T1 with one of the lines down over a WEP encryption on an old ass, wireless B router? Upgrade your shit. I can't see how anyone could download a damn thing with speeds like that."
