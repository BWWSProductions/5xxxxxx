This is a Recode of the PFD Source which has been through a few filters to try
 
and lighten it as it was a really dark source, unfortunatly the more you try to 

brighten it up the more problems occur with chroma noise patches and i gather this 

is why PFD left it as it was. Anyway have done the best i can with it after 

numerous attempts.


Its A VIDEO TS Folder to burn straight to disc for DVD Player and it looks much 

Better on a tv screen too.. 2 Short SAMPLES Included in Torrent along with a few 

screenshots
