IMPORTANT NEWS!!!  TELL EVERYONE YOU CAN!!!

Have you heard the latest from Sibel Edmonds?  Brad Freedman was filling in for Mike Malloy last week and interviewed her. She said that â€œthe US maintained 'intimate relations' with Bin Laden, and the Taliban, all the way until that day of September 11."  This was a bomb shell that has been picked up by media all over the world -every place but the US corporate media.  Daniel Ellsberg said that what she had to say was more important than the pentagon papers.

"The nature of all State power is everywhere identical: it tends to annihilate the freedom of the individual, turning him, spiritually, into a slave, and physically into a lackey, before putting him to use for the filthiest tasks. "

If for some reason you cannot get a seed for these torrents, there is a FAST server located here:

66.90.104.17 port 6878

If you add that server, your download will go MUCH faster! The fast server listed above cannot make direct connections to TPB trackers because it is blocked somewhere. It crosses a Comcast network in order to reach TPB, so I am betting that is where the trouble is... but that is just a guess.

There are also web download options for all of these videos on the server listed above. You may find them at the link below, but please only download using the torrent unless you cannot get a seed for some reason. You may use the web downloads as torrent seeds!

"Colorful demonstrations and weekend marches are vital but alone are not powerful enough to stop wars. Wars will be stopped only when soldiers refuse to fight, when workers refuse to load weapons onto ships and aircraft, when people boycott the economic outposts of Empire that are strung across the globe.

"Many people do not have sufficient confidence in themselves, their judgment and their capacities to make them capable of disobedience and resistance. Having no strong will of their own, they accept that of their rulers, and sometimes prefer rulers who will direct their lives and relieve them of the task of making decisions. The subjects may be disillusioned, exhausted, apathetic, or possessed of inertia, or they may lack a belief system which makes it possible both to evaluate when one ought to obey and disobey, and also to give confidence in one's right and ability to make such a decision. Lack of self-confidence may also be influenced by a belief that the ruling group is more qualified to make decisions and to carry them out than are the subjects. This attitude may be based on perceived greater competence, social customs and class distinctions, or conscious indoctrination."

"It may well be a question, whether these are not, upon the whole, of equal importance with any which are to be found in the constitution of this State. The establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, the prohibition of ex post facto laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, to which we have no corresponding provision in our Constitution, are perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains. The creation of crimes after the commission of the fact,or, in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny. The observations of the judicious Blackstone,1 in reference to the latter,are well worthy of recital:


" 'To bereave a man of life,' says he, 'or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government." And as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas corpus act, which in one place he calls "the BULWARK of the British Constitution."2
