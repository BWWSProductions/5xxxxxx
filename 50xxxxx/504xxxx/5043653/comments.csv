1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV 

I scanned this torrent with NOD32 AV, and got a malware hit. Download with caution."
,dj_mm,2010-01-05T22:01Z,"Wrong dude, I scanned with avast! Professional, MBAM, SAS and SpyBot Serach & Destroy. Nothing found. Latest definitions were updated like it should.

It's just the original install-file with serial included.
Question meanwhile: there is already a new version 3.30 but serial doesn't work on that one. Any suggestions? "
