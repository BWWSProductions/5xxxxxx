                       MGShareware FreeRIP Pro v3.1 + Serial                      



FreeRIP is a Windows software that lets you extract audio CD tracks and save them 
to WMA, MP3, Ogg, Wav, or FLAC audio files (this process is known as CD ripping or 
CD to MP3 conversion). Converting your CD audio collection to digital audio files 
is a breeze with FreeRIP: download and install FreeRIP, put your audio CD into 
your computer's CD drive, run FreeRIP and click on the Rip button.

FreeRIP is also a audio and MP3 converter and it can convert MP3 and other audio 
files from one of the named formats to another. E.G. FreeRIP can convert audio 
files from WMA to MP3, or OGG to MP3, or WAV to FLAC and so on. 

Once you have your digital audio tracks in your preferred format, just move them 
onto an audio player (e.g. a portable MP3 player such as an Apple iPodâ„¢, Creative 
Zen Playerâ„¢ or Sony Walkmanâ„¢), an advanced mobile phone, or burn them to a MP3 CD 
to listen in your MP3 car stereo, home stereo or Discmanâ„¢. 

FreeRIP also supports the high quality, lossless compression named FLAC, which is 
widely used and supported by audiophiles.

FreeRIP is also an advanced MP3 tag editor (supporting ID3 v1 and v2) and includes 
shortcuts to find track info (like lyrics or complete title) on the web, with just

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of 
    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting 
    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz
    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!
  
08- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

10- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

*All torrents scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security  
2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  
3- AVG Antivirus Pro   
4- Kaspersky AV Pro  
5- NOD32 AV  

...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by 
   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!

To the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
