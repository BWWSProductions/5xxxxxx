Forever - Spice Girls [2000]




Forever is the third studio album by English pop group the Spice Girls, released in 2000. It is their only album without Geri Halliwell (who reunited with the Spice Girls in 2007 for their Greatest Hits release). The album saw a huge drop in sales compared to their first two albums, but it was also because of lack of promotion especially in the United States, where most of their previous albums were sold. It was at this point in time when "Spice Mania" began to fade. Despite everything that happened, Forever managed to sell 3 million copies worldwide and was able to peak at number two in the United Kingdom behind Westlife's Coast to Coast.
