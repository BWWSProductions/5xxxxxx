,johan_musik,2009-09-12T08:42Z,can I use this as a vst instrument in cubase without having the hardware?
,Space134,2010-01-29T15:21Z,"First I want to say that this is a super fast download (1.5Mb/s), so thanks to all the seeders!! Will seed as well, only at night-time (upload limit!)"
,Space134,2010-01-29T16:01Z,"Second, everything is working fine. I did not use the update that is in the file (1.0.3 update), instead I used the 1.1.0 update straight away (Native.Instruments.Maschine.VSTi.RTAS.v1.1.UPDATE-AiR). 

I assume the update in this torrent is working fine as well, otherwise there would've a lot more replies (read- complaints :) )."
,Space134,2010-01-29T16:04Z,"... just a quick note... you have to update, otherwise you just run the demo version."
,KOBKED-X,2010-02-04T05:47Z,"Hi, I am actually here to ask if anyone has

,hellowren,2010-05-03T21:18Z,does this require some form of hardware?  i'm looking for a decent digital drum machine that isn't hammer head or fruity loops but everything i come across seems to require some form of hardware.
,lsmurp,2010-05-17T07:42Z,"can anyone email me just the update? i don't know what i've done with it, did a reinstall n i've lost it. only in demo mode. jeffgullen at gmail. thanks. be most grateful."
,WeazelBeats,2010-06-08T18:01Z,"Just a quick but (to me) very important question: 
How many disc space is required for the update to install?  Is 1Gb enough? or 2?  or 39?  
I keep getting the message that it won't install because I don't have enough disc space..

Please answer me if you can help me it's very important! "

,filmsy123,2011-05-11T13:56Z,"I'm using OSX 10.6. After finishing the download I extract those rar and get an ISO file which is 5.03GB. But when I mount it, there's nothing inside the ISO file but a pile of documentations.... Can anything help, thanks for your advice."
,Nash6989,2011-09-30T07:07Z,"well it does say its for windows, not a Mac."
,Nash6989,2011-10-14T15:04Z,"the update has a TROJAN VIRUS in it. i ran the update and MSE went off. and told thats what i got.. i dont know if its a false positive or not. but if it was it shouldnt be a trjen. more like a hacktool. your other torrents dont have virus,s so why does this one?"
,onefb,2011-10-15T03:58Z,"downloads alright and runs in ableton but when i try to install the update it says windows cannot access the specified device,path, or file.You may not have the appropriate permissions to acess the item.
So what have i done wrong?
Without the update i guess i'm stuck with the demo,( it ask me to choose one of 3 options.-demo,buy,activate.)
would love some help cheers"

,flipert,2011-12-28T17:26Z,"i got a huge bug on it, when i try to move the mashine window my screen turs black"
,Hungryghost76,2011-12-29T22:09Z,Hi... Not downloaded this yet; sounds like you need hardware; but for those worried about their virus checkers: the software used to 'crack' applications often gives false positives. Obviously.
,LucasRT,2012-03-25T19:59Z,"Didn't find the update in the torrent. Space134, could you tell me where did you get the 1.1.0 update?"
,itsmarshy,2012-06-08T05:38Z,"Can somebody find a 1.6 or above update for this?
I cannot use VSTs such as Massive or FM8 in this version. 

Greatly appreciated if anyone could find one."
,SirVinyl,2012-06-27T17:08Z,"Wont download, but I can't explain why. It tells me I got a download speed of 0.2 kb/s, sometimes 0.1 kb/s and mostly nothing, although it shows that it finds all peers. Help?"
