[T],suavecito195782,2009-08-04T23:09Z,no i said i think bricktop tried at one time to do the godfather movies but had problems with the Italian sub  speaking parts of the movie if i'am mistaken bricktop sorry about that 
,teabag87,2009-08-05T02:24Z,"OMG thank you man

I did my own conversion of this a while ok from a mkv file off pbay, and the audio lost sync towards the middle of the movie, which is a nightmare

Nothing beats matthew mcconaughey in this movie. When they're at the drive in and he pulls up.  ""ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT"" and then slowly pulls up.  I cry every time.  His quotes from this movie are epic"
,teabag87,2009-08-05T02:26Z,"im pretty sure bricktop has Goodfellas, which is WAY better then Godfather

Godfather is just like Scarface. a shitty gangster movie that is WAY overrated. 

Goodfellas will always be the best mafia movie. Along with Casino"
,deathstaraven,2009-08-05T18:57Z,@teabag...Amen to that I have always preferred Goodfellas over The Godfather series of movies. They seemed to be overly pretentious. Goodfellas is more down to earth and real.
