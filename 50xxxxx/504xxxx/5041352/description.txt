Brad and Kate have been together three years, in love, having fun, doing
all sorts of things together with no intention of marriage or children.
Christmas morning, they're on their way to Fiji, having told their two
sets of divorced parents that they're off to do charity work. Through a
fluke, they have no choice but to visit each of their four idiosyncratic
parents. As the day progresses, Brad and Kate remember growing up, each
learns more about the other, and Kate realizes that her life may not be
as good as it could be. Do they know each other well enough to weather
the storms families bring?
