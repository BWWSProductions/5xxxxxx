WINDOWS_XP_2nd_9_in_1_RESEED_FiREQuEST


Hari, ive just installed the Xp, 2nd edition.

I found this some time ago in the TPB.

I consider this to be the best and the most original.

If you install the "Pro Corp" from the boot menu option one ( 1 ).

This is the best, and the best to get the precise drives that is missing,

from the vendors sites. If your network card is not there, then you can

use a usb memory and copy from a friends computer. It ships with a crack

( WPA Kill ). But that IS NOT NEEDED if you install the "Pro Corp".

Thanks ----- enjoy ----- thanks




PS. It is the best to not use automatic updates - this is secure enough with AVG free
It will only try to download SP3 and it will not install - the built in firewall is
allready good - i do belive DS.
