Some flac, some ape, some wv, some mp3, some mp3 that's been converted to flac.  Some split tracks, some full discs, some discs with bonus tracks separate.

How do you stand having your music in such a disorganized mess?

Still, some good stuff in here once I got it sorted out, so thanks for that."
