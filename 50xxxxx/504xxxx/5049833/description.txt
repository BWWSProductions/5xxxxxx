Newly divorced, Achilles Pumpkinseed lives alone in the

house left to him by his deceased mother. Depressed and

adrift, he spends his days smoking pot and watching

television, usually alone but sometimes with his equally

rootless friend Patroclus. Although he owns a small

business, Achilles cannot face working any more than he

can muster the energy to deal with the world he used to

be a part of. Then one day, an unexpected visitor named

Homer shows up at Achilles' doorstep, bearing an unusual

gift: an old dilapidated camping trailer painted like a

child's image of a watermelon. Insisting that delivering

this improbable gift to Achilles is his "mission", sworn

to at knife-point for the young man's hated stepfather

Creon, Homer forces Achilles to accept the bizarre

object. As fate would have it, the Watermelon acts as a

magnet, luring all manner of oddball humanity to

Achilles' home - a flaky artist, a pushy

photo-journalist, a pedantic television reporter, and

even the ghost of his beloved mother. At first, Achilles

rejects the intrusions, until one day he discovers a

young runaway sleeping in the trailer. Rather than chase

her off as he did the others, Achilles invites the

vulnerable Persephone into his home... and his life.

Eleventh-hour appearances from his ex-wife and deranged

step-sister ensure that Achilles' life will never be the

same. Until it is. Sort of.
