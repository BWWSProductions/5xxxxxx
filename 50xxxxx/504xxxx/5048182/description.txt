Install Notes

New episodes will be posted as they air as always.

Need information on h264 look here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264

h264 provides excellent picture quality in smaller file sizes.

Some video cards support accelerated decoding of h264 on board taking
the workload off the main CPU and putting it on the GPU.

H264 is also supported by some newer IPODs.

For the newbies the file extension "SFV" is "Simple File
Verification" and has nothing to do with subtitles or audio. It
verifies the file is complete intact and unmodified. It's as the name
implies, "SIMPLE FILE VERIFICATION".

There has been an update to the episode list, these are updated based
off of current known info @ this date and may change or be updated as
necessary.

Now included is a picture storyboard and a cover from the show.

These are NMT Compatible. These episodes should play with no problems
on most Network Media Tanks and other similar players.
