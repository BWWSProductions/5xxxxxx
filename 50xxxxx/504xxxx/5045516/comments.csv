I have a robbie williams greatest hits up loaded if your interested.

,JoiresWay-II,2009-08-10T05:56Z,"Yeah joe..must be the case, i ve reported on the forum .

and comin to this one. this is just from the collection of coldplay of mine. didn't think this would come so nice. 

and another thing, my first torrent to reach more than a thousand seeders :P"
[V],only1joe,2009-08-10T11:59Z,"I only accidently got to a 1360 seeders 1100 leechers as a result of michael jackson dying.

Dont think i will reach that again unless i upload new releases, but that costs too much money. haha

,socksniland,2009-12-31T17:33Z,"A great selection of classics.

My only issue is that some of the better songs (Clocks for example) are bad quality (as low as 128kB/s).

Many thanks JoiresWay-II."

,quutar,2010-05-12T20:54Z,"While this is a good collection of songs, this is NOT an actual album. I mistook this for being ""The Singles 1999-2006"" album but it's not. If you're going to make a collection, at least properly label the ID3 tags to reflect the proper album/track# even if they are non-album tracks. Very frustrating."
