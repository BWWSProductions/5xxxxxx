A romantic comedy set in 1905 on Cape Cod, Massachusetts,

â€œThe Golden Boysâ€ is the story of three retired sea captains who

keep house together as a way to moderate the loneliness of their

retirements. As the story begins, chaos reigns in the house; dirty

dishes, dust and disorder have become their bane. Together they

hatch a plan to solve the problem: they flip coins, and the loser

must get married and take the other two in as boarders.

The three captains are Zebulon â€œZebâ€ Hedge (DAVID CARRADINE),

Perez Ryder (BRUCE DERN), and Jeremiah (â€œJerryâ€)

Burgess (RIP TORN). Jerry loses the coin toss, and they

run an advertisement in a Boston newspaper to entice

a prospective bride.
