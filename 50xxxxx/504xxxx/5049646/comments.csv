The number to put in ""Delay audio track by"" is 400. The audio is 400ms too fast.

I'm sure that will help a lot of you. Enjoy the film. I'm just about to watch it. :)"

,shinobiung,2009-11-29T00:55Z,"This is the biggest pile of shit movie I have been unfortunate to see in years. It is so corny, I feel EMBARRASED to watch it. It must be jewish yanki homour. Seinfeld is kinda 80's and this film is no where near as funny. And this film is Jewish bullshit, since when did afghans drag their women using goats after chopping their hands of.     I D I O T S. I am sooo grateful that I didnt buy this."
