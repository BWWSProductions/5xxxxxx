http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1112782/

While pulling a down-and-dirty jewelry heist on a subway train, Gabriel encounters Ripley, a legendary thief who was casing the same job. 

In spite of Gabriel's initial reluctance, Ripley manages to rope him into an impossible job: the theft of two priceless Faberge Imperial Eggs from the heavily guarded vault of a New York diamond wholesaler. 

The stakes rise for Gabriel and Ripley when Ripley's goddaughter is kidnapped by the KGB. 

Staying one step ahead of the NYPD, the FBI, the diamond merchants and the vicious Russian KGB crime boss determined to have the priceless eggs for himself, Gabriel and Ripley must find a way to pull off the heist and make it out alive.
