This is the new Remake of the classic Secret Of Monkey Island game.  ALl new 
grafx, full speech, 

Plot
----
The game begins when Guybrush Threepwood, a youth who wants to be a pirate, is 
washed up on the Caribbean island of MÃªlÃ©e. He seeks out the Pirate Leaders, who 
set him three challenges to prove himself a pirate: defeat Carla the island's 
swordmaster in insult swordfighting, steal a statue from the Governor's mansion, 
and find buried treasure.

Along the way he meets several interesting characters, including Stan the used 
boat salesman, Meathook (a fellow with hooks on both hands), a prisoner named 
Otis, the three men of low moral fiber and, most significantly, the gorgeous 
Governor Elaine Marley. The ghost pirate LeChuck, however, has been in love with 
Elaine since his living days. While Guybrush is busy, LeChuck's ghost crew 
abduct her, taking her to Monkey Island. Guybrush gathers a crew (Carla, 
Meathook, and Otis), buys a boat, and sets out to find the mysterious island and 
free Elaine.

When Guybrush finally reaches Monkey Island, he explores it and discovers a band 
of cannibals and a strange hermit named Herman Toothrot. After he helps the 
cannibals recover a lost voodoo ingredient, they provide him with a recipe that 
can destroy ghosts. However, when Guybrush goes after LeChuck, one of his crew 
tells him that LeChuck went to MÃªlÃ©e Island to marry Elaine.

Guybrush returns to MÃªlÃ©e and goes to the church to prevent the wedding. When he 
arrives at the church wedding, he realises that Elaine had her own plan to 
escape. LeChuck starts beating Guybrush; until the arrival at the ship emporium, 
where he sprays LeChuck with root beer (the cannibals having previously 
mentioned that the magic ghost fighting elixir, which is made from a voodoo 
root, goes well with vanilla ice cream). With LeChuck defeated, Guybrush and 
Elaine enjoy a romantic moment, watching fireworks.
