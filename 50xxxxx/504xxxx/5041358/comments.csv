right click on the folder that has all the vids in it then click ""play with vlc..."" . you should then get a title menu with options (not in English) just  click options till it will play w/ subs

good quality overall "
,yuriru,2009-08-15T09:25Z,This is not just 'good quality'. It is perfect quality. Burned to DVD and watched on a large flat LCD screen. Excellent. Thank you very much - Zeer veel dank :-)
,MMSCBF,2009-08-15T12:50Z,"hmm... the info on the torrent says the texted language says Dutch, but the comments make it seem that it's subbed in english. so, is the movie subbed in dutch or in english? i just want to be sure so i don't have to waste time downloading a movie in a audio of a language i'm still learning and subbed in a language i don't know. "

@MMSCBF
The subs are Dutch and English (custom I presume). Wouldn't come up on Intervideo WinDVD on my pc but when I burned to DVD everything works great."

Could you please guys seed ? It is very slow..."
,Makeswell,2010-03-12T19:29Z,"to burn:
just download a program like ImgBurn
burn the whole folder 'Ponyo on the Cliff NTSC' to dvd disc
then you're done, put it in your dvd player and it works.
(this procedure works in general for all those folders with the Video_TS and VTS_01 sorts of files, makes nice product too, in an easy way)"
