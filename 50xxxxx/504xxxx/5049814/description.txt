In a world gone soft and flabby, the greatest threat to humanityâ€™s survival isnâ€™t global warming, but a wobble in the earthâ€™s rotation caused by the excess weight America has gained in the form of obesity and useless consumer junk. Now, audacious lone crusader Grant Fitzgerald (Scott A. Evans) runs for president of the United States to expose the truth about this menace. Scott Tyler also stars in this comic mockumentary.
