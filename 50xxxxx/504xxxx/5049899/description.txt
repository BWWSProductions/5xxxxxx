The Very Best Of Mt USA - Various Artists [2007]
	


MT-USA (Music Television USA), A Three-Hour-Long Music Video Show Modelled On The Then New American Cable Channel, MTV And Presented By Vincent Hanley.  MT-USA Was Broadcast On RTÃ‰ (Irish Television) From 1984-87 On Thursday Evenings, Repeated On Sunday Afternoons. 
Each Block Of Videos Was Followed By A Segment Filmed In New York City With Hanley Introducing The Videos, Discussing American Music And Culture, And Interviewing A Celebrity.  
RTÃ‰ Described Hanley As Europe's First VJ (Video Jockey). All Videos Were Of American Acts, Many Previously Little-Known In Ireland At The Time. It Was Also Remembered For Its "Simul-Cast" Where RTE Broadcast The Video On RTE 2 Television At The Same Time As They Broadcast The Sound (In STEREO) On 2FM Radio And To Get The Benefit Of This All You Had To Do Was Turn Down The Volume, Also Known As Advanced Technology (Haha)
