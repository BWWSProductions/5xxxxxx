Artie's Heroin Addiction Revealed

A classic rewind to the classic Stern moment when Artie admits his addiction to Heroin.  It's not the entire show but it starts right where the discussion begins and he admits it and is really bummed out.  Pretty wild to hear where that whole fiasco began.  You can totally tell how much better he's gotten.  Enjoy.
