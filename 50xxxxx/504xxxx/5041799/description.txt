Synopsis.

The Seventh Seal | Sweden | 1957 | Directed by Ingmar Bergman
                                  
Disillusioned and exhausted after a decade of battling in the Crusades, a knight 
(Max von Sydow) encounters Death on a desolate beach and challenges him to a fateful game of chess. Much studied, imitated, even parodied, but never outdone, Bergman's stunning allegory of man's search for meaning, The Seventh Seal (Det sjunde inseglet), was one of the benchmark foreign imports of America's 1950s art-house heyday, pushing cinema's boundaries and ushering in a new era of moviegoing. This 2009 reissue by The Criterion Collection of one of their first DVD releases contains a new, restored high-definition digital transfer, improved English subtitles, and a commentary track by Bergman scholar Peter Cowie.
