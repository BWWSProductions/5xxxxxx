,robbo86,2009-08-12T18:14Z,Ive got a problem with the lip sync.Anyone else?
,lporiginalg,2009-08-13T07:00Z,Ya the audio sync is really bad for me. It's a shame looks like it might be a decent flick considering it's got Jermain Clement and Bret Mckenzie from Flight Of The Conchords but I can't bear to watch that it's too distracting so I'll look for a proper upload.
