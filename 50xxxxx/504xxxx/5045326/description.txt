This is the 9.5 install disk and crack with Pictures of the actual disks to make lables for your disks if you burn them.

Version 9.5 2007 fourth quarter.

I got tired of trying to swap disks when I was working in the shop, so I downloaded the following files to be able to put all the disks on my hard drive through alldata disk copy.

START - PROGRAMS - ALLDATA- ALLDATA DISK COPY.  

It walks you through the process.

Also, when it asked me to "insert disk"  I just mounted it with POWERISO.

If you don't know how to use ISO programs, I suggest you google powerISO and read about it.


I have downloaded all the "DATA" disks from jabkissma

I did not use his install disk or crack. (those are included in THIS torrent)


I also downloaded the AZ parts info from.... 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4506196/AZ_Parts_for_ALLDATA_9.5

It isn't the ISO image unfortunately, but it does work.
