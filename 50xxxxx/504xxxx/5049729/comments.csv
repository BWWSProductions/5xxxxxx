Step 1) Download - Torrent downloaded fine

Step 2) Extract the files, I had to rename the folder they were being extracted to down to just 'Atlantis Underwater Tycoon' otherwise I was told the files could not copy because the target name would have been too long.

Step 3) I used Power ISO to Mount the Atlantis Underwater Tycoon.mdf file which instantly started up a window asking me to Install

Step 4) Installed the game - Quick and easy Install

Step 5) Play!

Installed and played with no issues... Gameplay is a bit basic, game is quite simple, but that is to be expected. The tutorials are a bit less helpful than I'd like but not bad all-in-all...
