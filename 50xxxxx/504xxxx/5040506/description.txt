:
Neuro Hunter puts you in the role of computer expert Hunter, who finds himself in
an underground world ruled by a computer hacker.

All major corporations have secrets they would rather were kept hidden. Johnston
Biotek Inc. is no exeption, but not all companie's secrets are as dark and
destructive as this one. When the situation threatens to get out of hand, the
management hires a man they call Hunter to restore order. However, sometimes
things have to get a lot worse before they get better. Hunter will soon discover
that no pay cheque would be worth the dangers he will face after accepting this
job
