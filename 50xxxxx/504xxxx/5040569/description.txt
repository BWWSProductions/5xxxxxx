*******************************************************************************

This torrent contains both the Audio CD in its remastered stereo form, as 
released in 2006, plus a short video, which tells the story of DM during the 
era.  

The video is presented in XviD with .mp3 sound.  There are spanish and english 
subtitles already ripped and a subpack which also includes subs in Deutsch, 
FranÃ§ais and Italiano.  You have to rip it yourself (I currently use SubRip on 
Windows), in order to use them.

Note: There's no 5.1 audio here.  I repeat: there's no 5.1 audio here.  Only the 
2.0 stereo album remastered.  And sounds great!

                              THE ALLMUSIC REVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Ned Raggett

Initially the title must have sounded like an incredibly pretentious boast, 
except that Depeche Mode then went on to do a monstrous world tour, score even 
more hits in America and elsewhere than ever before, and pick up a large number 
of name checks from emerging house and techno artists on top of all that. As for 
the music the masses got this time around, the opening cut, "Never Let Me Down 
Again," started things off wonderfully: a compressed guitar riff suddenly 
slamming into a huge-sounding percussion/keyboard/piano combination, anchored to 
a constantly repeated melodic hook, ever-building synth/orchestral parts at the 
song's end, and one of David Gahan's best vocals (though admittedly singing one 
of Martin Gore's more pedestrian lyrics). It feels huge throughout, like they 
taped Depeche recording at the world's largest arena show instead of in a 
studio. Other key singles "Strangelove" and the (literally) driving "Behind the 
Wheel" maintained the same blend of power and song skill, while some of the 
quieter numbers such as "The Things You Said" and "I Want You Now" showed 
musical and lyrical intimacy could easily co-exist with the big chart-busters. 
Add to that other winners like "To Have and to Hold," with its Russian radio 
broadcast start and dramatic, downward spiral of music accompanied by Gahan's 
subtly powerful take on a desperate Gore love lyric, and the weird, wonderful 
choral closer, "Pimpf," and Depeche's massive success becomes perfectly clear.

                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Music for the Masses is the sixth studio album by Depeche Mode. Released by Mute 
Records on September 28, 1987, it provided the band with mainstream success in 
the United States for the first time since Some Great Reward, and the new styles 
of music that appeared on the album and its predecessor Black Celebration formed 
the foundation for their breakthrough effort, Violator.

It was supported by the Music for the Masses Tour, which compiles material into 
the band's first live album 101.

The album became the band's highest-charting in the US upon its release, 
reaching #35 on the Billboard 200. It also contained more hit singles than any 
of their previous releases. While there was no extremely popular single from the 
album ("People Are People" from Some Great Reward reached #13 on the Billboard 
Hot 100), the three singles that were released all made it onto the Hot 100, a 
feat that hadn't been achieved by any Depeche Mode single after those from Some 
Great Reward. Moreover, all three singles achieved modest success on the chart.

The first single from the album, "Strangelove", only reached #76 and spent 6 
weeks on the chart upon its initial release. "Never Let Me Down Again" was then 
issued and hit #63, spending 10 weeks on the chart. Its success was duplicated 
by "Behind the Wheel" which had a similar chart run. This propelled a re-
released "Strangelove" (as "Strangelove '88") to #50, making it the highest-
charting single from the album.

The story was similar in the United Kingdom. While no single reached the chart 
heights of Depeche Mode's early career, "Strangelove" narrowly became the band's 
second-highest charting single since 1984 when it hit #16. The two follow-up 
singles charted in the upper 20s. The album was less successful, reaching only 
#10, though it was a major success throughout Europe. Generally, this album and 
its extracted singles continued the trend for Depeche Mode's releases to chart 
higher in Continental Europe than in their home country: "Strangelove" and 
"Never Let Me Down Again" both hit #2 on the singles chart in what was then West 
Germany, "Behind The Wheel" hit #6 there, and "Little 15" reached #16.

The Music for the Masses Tour was one of Depeche Mode's biggest, notably because 
of the sell-out Pasadena Rose Bowl show where the band performed to around 
65,000 fans, cementing their place in United States alternative culture. This 
made the band question if they had reached the peak of their careers, according 
to the 101 DVD, a documentary on the concert, but put that notion to rest with 
Violator, which was even more successful.

In 2006, Music For the Masses became one of the first Depeche Mode albums (along 
with Speak and Spell and Violator) to be released on a special 2-Disc SACD/CD 
Hybrid + DVD format, in the vein of their 2005 album Playing the Angel, which 
had a limited edition SACD + DVD release. The format was the same as Playing the 
Angel's, the first disc had a special digitally remastered version of the album, 
while the DVD had the album on three formats (PCM Stereo, 5.1 Surround Sound and 
DTS 5.1) plus bonus tracks, and a documentary on the album. The rerelease 
preserves the album as it was originally intended. Thus, the four bonus tracks 
do not appear on the SACD, but appear on the DVD. The DVD also features all B-
Sides from the Music for the Masses era, but unlike the album and the bonus 
tracks, are only available in PCM Stereo.

The documentary, a 37 minute short film called Depeche Mode: 1987-88 (Sometimes 
You Do Need Some New Jokes) is an extensive look at the album, featuring 
commentary from a wide variety of people, including the current Depeche Mode, 
former member Alan Wilder, producer Dave Bascombe, Daniel Miller, Daryl Bamonte, 
Martyn Atkins (who came up with the loudspeakers idea for the cover), Anton 
Corbijn, and others. The documentary features new facts on the album, and also 
an extensive look at the movie 101.

The rerelease came out April 3, 2006 in Europe. The US version was delayed to 
June 2, 2006 and will only be available on a CD + DVD format, with no SACD. The 
DVD on all the versions are region independent however, so one can simply import 
the SACD version without worrying about the DVD being incompatible.

                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEVER LET ME DOWN AGAIN     by Ned Raggett

That the Smashing Pumpkins covered this in later years isn't too surprising -- 
but what is interesting is that they chose to do an acoustic version, perhaps 
figuring they couldn't top the original. It's doubtful anyone could; with Martin 
Gore's compressed guitar riff leading the way, Depeche here created not merely 
the calling card for its smash success Music for the Masses album, but an all-
time anthem for the band and electronic music as a whole. About the only thing 
about the song that doesn't totally work is the lyrics, which are suggestive but 
not as intriguingly poisonous as so many of the band's other tunes. That one 
rhyme goes "Promises me I'm safe as houses/As long as I remember who's wearing 
the trousers" is a bit giggle-worthy. David Gahan's performance of the same, 
however, is big and strong, Gore's hidden harmony vocals an extra. What really 
makes the song is the overall delivery and arrangement, a massive beat echoing 
in the mix and the lead synth lines later accompanied by mock horns, strings, 
and more. It's as if Laibach were able to get one of its brutal post- Wagnerian 
epics onto the charts, and with a weird romantic patina at that. As Gore 
delivers the last "See the stars, they're shining bright" line with the song's 
fade, it's clear the band were on even more of a roll than ever. 



STRANGELOVE     by Ned Raggett

Released in a slightly different, more accessible remix than was originally 
found on Music for the Masses, "Strangelove" is still another big, strong number 
from Depeche Mode, with an attention-grabbing start and lead melody, reflecting 
member Alan Wilder's increasing skill at arrangements. Martin Gore's lyric is 
another one of his sly, aggressively wounded best, David Gahan's almost 
challenging vocal turn on it playing up the confessions of emotional guilt and 
sadism to an almost outrageous degree. Again, one has to wonder at how 
effortlessly Gore could make such material the open heart of a pop single, and a 
successful one at that. Gahan's overdubbed vocals make the "Pain -- will you 
return it?" section equally grabbing, the bell/chime-like lead melody continuing 
on relentlessly as much as the beat does, while Gore's spare, low guitar parts 
add a sharp, unexpected hook on top of things. Extra synth orchestrations fill 
out the mix toward the end, the song as a whole a brilliantly effective 
encapsulation of hooks, studio experimentation, and production. 



BEHIND THE WHEEL     by Tim DiGravina

Despite all of its imagery of driving and being a passenger, its opening sample 
of a wheel falling off a car, and its hypnotic beat symbolic of a car gliding 
down a roadway, "Behind the Wheel" isn't really about automobiles at all. It's a 
classic song of sexual submission or of just giving in to another person's 
control over any aspect of one's life. Martin Gore's favorite subject has proven 
to be relationships, and "Behind the Wheel" blends a little bit of bondage and a 
little bit of codependence to make for a quintessential Depeche Mode song. David 
Gahan seems completely and perfectly exhausted emotionally, singing "Do what you 
want; I don't care tonight/I hand myself over on a plate." He goes on to offer, 
"I prefer you behind the wheel/And me the passenger." The ravishing beat and 
high-tech synth sounds that engulf Gahan's voice suggest he's looking for love 
as long as he doesn't have to be the one in control. He wants "[his] little girl 
[to] come pull [his] strings." "Behind the Wheel" shares a sonic and thematic 
resemblance to "Never Let Me Down Again." Where the latter sees escape in drugs, 
the former finds similar comfort in giving up one's free will to a lover. A 
stylish promotional video for the song directed by Anton Corbijn was released in 
1987. 



I WANT YOU NOW     by Tim DiGravina

"I Want You Now" couldn't be much more straight-forward. From its samples of 
lovers in ecstasy to Martin Gore's desperate pleas, the song has one focus and 
one focus only: sex. Gore offers his vocals as if he's just stepped front and 
center from a church choir. The heavy breathing and cries of joy that surround 
him work like pistons, adding texture, life, and a beat to the pensive keyboards 
and accordion musical backdrop. Without the moaning samples, "I Want You Now" 
would probably be Depeche Mode's most spare musical offering, so it really was 
imperative that Gore set just the right tone with his vocals. The song would be 
a study in atmosphere like "Pimpf" without Gore's vocals. Usually the songs that 
Gore assigns to himself as a vocalist express deeper emotions, but here he's 
concentrating on lust, even if he offers that he doesn't just "want to be like 
one of the boys." The wavering quiver in his voice paints his desperation and 
desires perfectly. His repeated declaration of "I want you now" drips passion 
and frustration. Even if "I Want You Now" isn't Depeche Mode's most high concept 
creation or most complex song, Martin Gore's captivating honesty makes the song 
an integral part of Music for the Masses. 



NOTHING     by Tim DiGravina

"Nothing" is Music for the Masses' brightest and most musically upbeat track, 
despite the fact that it expresses an unrelenting sense of indifference. When 
one thinks of Depeche Mode's energetic 101 film and album, the rollicking 
"Nothing" might pop to mind. One imagines Dave Gahan spinning in circles or 
raising his mic stand to the heavens, and it's difficult not to add his 101 
shouts of "thank you" and his general exultations and grunts over the keyboard 
solos on the Music for the Masses version. The song consists of two primary 
segments: a percolating sampler section where Gahan sings of "sitting waiting" 
and "life's" unadvertised surprises and an addictively catchy quickening where 
Gahan tells listeners there's not really much new to say. All along the way, 
Martin Gore and company provide a backdrop of hushed harmonies, mostly singing 
the world "nothing" sweetly as a group. The contrast of "Nothing"'s bored lyrics 
and its jangling, jolly electronics makes for a humorous, interesting listen. 
That the album follows up the song with the atmospheric epic "Pimpf" only serves 
to make Music for the Masses a more compelling, varied experience.

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
