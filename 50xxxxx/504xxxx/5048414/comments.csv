,sarcastos,2009-11-08T08:28Z,"It's nice to see that dyerseve87 is a complete idiot.
But at least he pointed out the mistakes of the upper before he made his mental illness known to everyone."

hey silly before you throw the words out- Think!

arlovski- is belorussian spelling, orlovskiy- is russian spelling, both is correct. Ooops, feeling stupid?

missing mousassi exhibition- great way to thank the loader for great compilation, shut up retard.

ducking the competition- if you know anything about mma you would say that Fedor is prolly the best it ever seen so far, and prolly will stay that way for a while. Being a supporter of different schools and fighters is good, but you gott be reasonable and respect others. Since there is, there is no respect from you, no respect from me either, get the fuck out retard! Bam, I feel better."
,saber91101,2009-11-29T23:32Z,it doesn't matter if anderson silva and fedor were in the same weight class silva would wipe the floor with him

If you have the Brett Rogers fight in the same format as the others that would be great."
,americanloverman,2009-12-14T03:55Z,"Anderson Silva?  Really? Ducking the competition?  This man beat fighters like Nog and Cro Cop when they were at the absolute peak of their games.  Not to mention he has beaten a number of former UFC champs.  The problem is that Dana White wants to own the contracts for all UFC fighters outright.  1.  Fedor is all about his sambo competitions, and White won't let him participate in those.  2. The UFC has clauses in the contracts to force fighters to make multiple defenses on White's schedule.  

The truth is White won't compromise because he is way too afraid that Fedor will destroy Brock Lesnar or whoever and just walk off with his belt.  With good reason!!!  Mark these words... Lesnar will not make it past Carwin, much less Fedor.  And Carwin would make a compelling fight, but would be an underdog in the 3-1 to 4-1 category.  You may think Brett Rogers is ducking the competition, but check his record out.  He was undefeated and nobody had made it out of the second round with him.  Watch that fight.  Fedor took MANY shots from Rogers but silenced him with ONE PUNCH.  Same goes for Arlovski.

And best of all the man is a humble, spiritual, patriotic family man.    Why hate such greatness?  This man is a treasure of humanity and performance.  "
