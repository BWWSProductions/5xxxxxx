A man must make the ultimate sacrifice to save the woman he loves from creatures of the night in this tale of terror. Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and Amanda (Meredith Monroe) are a young couple who journey to Thailand on a vacation. Connor and Amanda have an argument one night, and she storms off; she doesn't return to their hotel that night, and it isn't long before he begins to worry. When the police can't help Connor find Amanda, he begins to wonder if she's fallen prey to an unusual form of foul play, and he learns that Thailand is home to a tribe of predatory vampires. Putting his martial arts skills to work, Connor seeks the help of a pair of local vampire hunters to bring Amanda back to safety, but it isn't long before he realizes that if he's to find the vampires, he must become one himself. Vampires: The Turning is an in-name-only follow-up to John Carpenter's 1998 hit Vampires. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide
