In 1985 Jimmy Buffett released his greatest hits album "Songs that You Know
by Heart." The disc went on to sell over 6 million copies worldwide and is a
fan favorite. In 2008, he released "Scenes that You Know By Heart" which
features live video versions of the same songs from the album plus two newer
bonus tracks: "Hey Good Lookin'" and "It's Five O'Clock Somewhere". Most of
the cuts are taken from different concerts around the world.

Video: 464x352 anamorphically stretched to 16x9, XviD-insane, 29.97fps
Audio: 128Kbps ABR Lame MP3 (using the louder 2ch wave source; there
was a softer 5:1 channel that I elected against.)

DVD recommended? If you're a Buffett fan, you may already own it, especially
if you have 5:1 and want the crowd to roar over the music for in-concert feel.
NTSC DVD video was 30fps interlaced; isn't much if any better than rip.
