There have been numerous film adaptations of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", over the years. This one which was produced, written and directed by Jonathan Miller in 1966 for the BBC, is one of the most original, capturing the surreal dreamlike quality of the book. Miller wanted to get away from the Disney image of the novel; he saw the novel as a picture of upper-middle-class Victorian society: stuffy, pompous and ritualistic. He was inspired by pre-Raphaelite paintings and Victorian photography; thus the imagery in this film is beautiful and is enhanced by Ravi Shankar's haunting music. The film is also packed with great names of British film and television: Michael Redgrave, John Gielgud, Peter Sellers, Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, Leo McKern, to name but a few; and Alice is beautifully played by the young Anne-Marie Mallik.
