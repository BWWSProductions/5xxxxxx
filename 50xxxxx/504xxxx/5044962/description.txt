
Greetings to whomever it is reading this, my name is Erno Korpelainen from Finland and I go by the name "Urjala" in complete obscurity what comes to the music-industry, -scene or whatever you may want to call it. However, it has been a long time coming that I try to get my point of hear across, so to say. So here you have it, I made a collection of some pieces of work I have crafted over the last ten years, there are some really good tracks and some odd and downright silly ones as well. But all this is essentially me and my brain manifesting, hopefully you will enjoy these as well. 



Special thanks to Mike, without whom I wouldn't have had the go-ahead to go ahead with this, may your endeavours prosper in the fields of music!
