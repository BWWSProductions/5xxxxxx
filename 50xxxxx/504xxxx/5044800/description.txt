Fright Night is an American vampire comedy horror film directed by Tom Holland and starring William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, Stephen Geoffreys and Roddy McDowall that was released in 1985. 


Charley Brewster is a normal American teenager whose mother thinks he watches too many late night horror films. Charley's life is pretty uneventful - until he becomes convinced that his suave, yet sinister, neighbour Jerry Danddridge (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire.
No-one, least of all the police, will believe that Dandridge is the vicious killer responsible for a spate of bizarre murders.
Charley finds an ally in Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), a former horror film star and host of TV's Fright Night Theatre, in his quest to nail the debonair bloodsucker.
But then the nightmare really begins...
