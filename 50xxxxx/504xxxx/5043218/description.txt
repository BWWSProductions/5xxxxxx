       Â¦  The   MASCHINE   hardware   is  both  instrument  and  Â¦
       Â¦  controller in one. Sixteen illuminated,                Â¦
       Â¦  velocity-sensitive   pads   form   an   interface  to  Â¦
       Â¦  intuitively   make   beats,   tweak   sounds,  create  Â¦
       Â¦  patterns  and  sequence whole songs with the powerful  Â¦
       Â¦  MASCHINE   software.   Two   large,   high-resolution  Â¦
       Â¦  displays  with  eight  corresponding rotary encoders,  Â¦
       Â¦  buttons,  and  transport controls integrate perfectly  Â¦
       Â¦  with the MASCHINE software.                            Â¦
       Â¦                                                         Â¦
       Â¦  MASCHINE  unifies  and  vastly  improves  on familiar  Â¦
       Â¦  groove   production  workflows.  Using  the  MASCHINE  Â¦
       Â¦  hardware  controller  you  can  jam  out  ideas  in a  Â¦
       Â¦  pattern-oriented  environment,  and  use  them as the  Â¦
       Â¦  building   blocks   to   create   your  track  within  Â¦
       Â¦  MASCHINE. New samples, loops, effects or               Â¦
       Â¦  arrangements  can be added, edited and tweaked in the  Â¦
       Â¦  same  intuitive  way,  utilizing the ultra-convenient  Â¦
