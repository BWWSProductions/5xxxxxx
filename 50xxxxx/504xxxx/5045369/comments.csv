,mikeboosh,2009-09-25T02:29Z,"nope, sorry i don't have the audio cd

my girlfriend is the cpa, she paid 75 bucks for this from some guy off ebay, i couldn't find it here for her first so I knew someone could use it"
,shaheer77,2009-10-26T07:42Z,Thanks a lot mate. been looking for ever for these. I cannot buy them or copy them where i am thanks a lot
,dmj92002,2009-12-22T01:54Z,anyone know how these files were extracted from the Becker Course CD's/DVD's? I'm trying to use my (legal) copy (not judging by the way) to extract the files into PDF format so that I can basically have an electronic version of all my textbooks...easier to read on my iTouch than lugging around textbooks
,junkylov,2010-01-01T02:50Z,i wud love to know too.. how to extract.. specially the new dvd version they came up with...
,javi02pr,2010-04-05T03:39Z,Thanks you man!
,puffylee100,2010-07-13T09:54Z,"you guys are truly amazing...rnrni am a paid becker student and have just verified that all of these pdf files are authentic. every page of the text is included, and so are the notes and questions, with the exception of the following:rn1. \""revised\"" articles which can only be supplied to a legal licsenced user from becker\'s website;rn2. the essay questions don\'t seem to be includedrnrnbecker\'s software has a unique way of demonstrating the research techniques you\'ll need during the actual exams. without preparing for these essays one will have a very hard time passing. so i suggest that the users of this dl try picking up the essay materials as soon as you finish with these mc questions. you\'ll need them for far, aud, and reg. rnrnfyi, take the exams before the end of 2010 if you are relying on this dl. starting in 2011 there will be new topics and formats on the exam (for example, the international financial reporting topic). no one knows how much change there will be at this point, so make the best use of this dl til the end of this year.rnrnand...rnrngd you guys! i paid $2900 (with discount) for these materials!rnrnstudy hard and good luck!"
,puffylee100,2010-07-13T10:09Z,"one more thing...you guys ought to give becker cpa review a try if you are on the border line of passing them all. you dont need to buy all 4 but just the most difficult sections (like far). besides, going through becker and hell-like studying periods without listening to peter olintos lectures is a real shame."

Please upload the same"
,red255,2011-01-24T15:43Z,"2011 wasn't VASTLY different than 2010, just get a wiley update book or something if you want to know the specifics.  Basically they just added some international stuff for 20% of one exam, and moved some questions around."
,argo81,2012-02-04T20:17Z,"Thanks a lot! I use it in auditing class, very helpful! The basics stay pretty much the same after SOX I giess.  It gave me a good idea if I would  want to buy the latest version for my CPA  exam."
