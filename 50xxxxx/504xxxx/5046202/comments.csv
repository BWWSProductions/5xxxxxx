CAMPAIGN/SCENARIO EDITORS
The Empire Earth Campaign and Scenario Editors are versatile and robust tools for creating original maps, scenarios, and campaigns.  Both give you maximum control over your creations without sacrificing ease of use.  The Scenario Editor allows you to create Empire Earth maps and specify explicit goals which the player(s) must accomplish to win.  The Campaign Editor lets you tie scenarios together into an integrated campaign.  This document provides more detail about these editors than the chapter in the printed manual.
Campaign Editor
The Campaign Editor is used to ?assemble? scenarios created with Empire Earth?s Scenario Editor into complete campaigns.  A campaign is a collection of scenarios presented in an order determined by the scenario designer, therefore you must first create the scenarios before you can put them into a campaign (see the Scenario Editor section later in this chapter).  Campaigns also include associated files such as JPEGs and sound files.
Starting the Campaign Editor
To open the Campaign Editor, click the Game Tools button on Empire Earth?s Main Menu and then click the Campaign Editor button.
Using the Campaign Editor
Creating a campaign is a very simple task.  The only prerequisite is that you have working scenarios to put into the campaign.  Then all you need to do is give your campaign a name, select the scenarios and put them in the order you want, and then save the campaign.  That?s all there is to it.  Once created, a campaign contains all the files needed to play each of the scenarios in it.  Associated files (such as JPEGs, MP3s, etc.) are automatically saved as part of the campaign when you click the save button.  
The Campaign Editor Screen
This section describes all the controls on the Campaign Editor screen and how to use them.  You can exit the Campaign Editor by clicking the Back button, or click the Scenario Editor button to launch EE?s Scenario Editor.
Campaign Name
In this field you can type the name for your campaign.  If you select a campaign from the Campaigns list, its name appears here.  If you edit the selected campaign?s name, the Campaign Editor assumes you are creating a new campaign based on the settings of the selected campaign.
Civilization Name
In this field you can enter a name for the civilization that players will use for the entire campaign.  Players cannot change this name.  If you do not specify a name here or in the scenario, players can make up a name themselves when they enter the Civ Builder.
