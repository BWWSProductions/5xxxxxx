 The cartoon show Usavich is a series of short films, which are completely 
 animated and was produced by Kanaban Graphics for MTV Japan since 2006. 
 The story of the cartoon series revolve around a number of odd lovable 
 rabbits which are being imprisoned in a Russian Gulag.

 The first season of the cartoon series instantly clicked with the television 
 audience because of the simple portrayals of the lovable creatures. In the 
 first season the makers depicted the daily occurrences of the imprisoned 
 life of the two rabbits. The portrayal of the regular life of the rabbits 
 is also done with much dexterity and the audiences seem to enjoy it all the 
 more. The second series of the show portrays the adventurous circumstances 
 under which they escape and shows their life on the run.

 The show has gained huge popularity all over Japan. The storyline also has 
 interesting twists and turns and focuses on the life of two rabbits named 
 Kirenenko and Putin respectively. They were imprisoned in a Russian gulag 
 and had no hopes of being free from the shackles of the evils.

 They could not even spend carefree days in their little cell and were very 
 much disappointed over their present state of affairs. Soon followed their 
 constant battles with the guards in which they always produced some comedy 
 or the other by bringing in all sorts of puns. In fact the whole show turned 
 into a riotously funny slapstick comedy in the course of time. This unique 
 production from the Kanaban Graphics indeed comes with a lot of twists and 
 turns in the sequences of plots and its further development.

 Usavich is a really worth watching comedy. It is also described by some as 
 bizarre series. The fusion of 3D animation and traditional 2D illustration 
 is really a thing which deserves special praise about this series. It is 
 always expected that you will imbibe hallucinogen of choice while watching 
 this series. The funny little creatures involving themselves in a series of 
 adventurous twists and turns really makes the audience and also children
 sit back and take notice of them. This show is enjoyed by young and old alike.

 The cartoon series also got a very high rating in the Atlantic Film Festival 
 of the year 2007. This type of shows are very common in Japan but among all 
 of them Usavich carved a special niche for itself in the hearts of its 
 audiences. The funny Japanese series is also a great watch for the audience 
 worldwide and especially the kids will have a blast of time and definitely
 demand a pair of rabbits on their next birthday. The popularity of the series 
 stands testimony to its wonderful creation. 26 episodes have been produced.
