I already know how to use CLI of x264 and NeroEnc separately and how to rip BR discs, but can you point me the software you use for muxing back audio and video back to one file? I'd be glad for any constructive reply."

There are 4 subtitles in the movie (muxed in the container) and they are OPTIONAL. You can switch to the subtitle you like or completely disable them. I provide detailed info in the torrent description :-)

VLC Player: Video-->Subtitles Track-->Disable

Cheers :-)"

Learn to use convertion software like AVS for example, then hopefully you might not bitch as much. "
