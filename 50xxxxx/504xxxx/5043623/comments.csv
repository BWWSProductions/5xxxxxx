,war59312,2010-04-29T19:13Z,"Hi,

The following 13 videos use the bad video Codec:

DivX 3 Low

This means the following 13 videos are unplayable as is on the XboX 360:

IMAX - Africa, The Serengeti (1994)

IMAX - Alaska, Spirit of the Wild (1997)

IMAX - Beavers (1988)

IMAX - Blue Planet (1990)

IMAX - Cosmic Voyage (1996)

IMAX - Everest (1998)

IMAX - Great North (2001)
IMAX - Mysteries Of Egypt (1998)
IMAX - Mystery of the Maya (1995)
IMAX - Ring Of Fire
IMAX - The Eruption of Mount St. Helens (1980)
IMAX - Tropical Rainforest (1992)
IMAX - Wolves (1999)
IMAX - Zion Canyon, Treasure Of The Gods (1996)

Thankfully you can easily convert all 13 of them using XviD4PSP 6.0 Daily:

""Download beta"" Link Is What You Want

Use these settings:

Format: MP4
Preset: XBOX 360
Video: XVID
Audio: AAC & AAC-LC 128kbps Stereo

Took me about 10 minutes for each video to convert, and now all of them play back great on my XboX 360.

Well, hope that helps someone..

Take Care,

Will"
