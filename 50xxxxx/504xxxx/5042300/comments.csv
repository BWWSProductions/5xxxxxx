Won't happen again (if I can help it) I of course forgot my laptop on the day that no one anywhere else put up a 64k mp3 either so folks were SOL. Unless they caught shuaz's up of course. "

[T],shuazien,2009-08-05T06:04Z,"Thank you MG!!

I told the program I used to encode to do 64K, but it spit out 96K.  I'm still a newbie at that encoding shit. Oh well.
