In this release I have included every Gameboy & Gameboy Color rom I could find.. The emulator plays the roms zipped so I left them that way;)

Just drag and drop the RIN folder to the PSP>Game directory on your memory stick.. I already made the Roms folder and put the roms it it so that saves you a step ;) ..Like my work?? Please read the NFO and support me ;)


Have you been looking for that classic PSX game but just can't seem to find it anywhere? How about those "rare" titles that were only released in certain regions? Better yet, would you like to be able to have those games playable on your PSP so you can play them anywhere you want? Want to get those conversions directly from the source instead of through "unsafe" torrent browsers? Come and request them at
