A Lifelong Dream

A half century ago, a teenage boy named Peter Robbins looked out over the choppy surface of the Atlantic Ocean and envisioned diving to its more tranquil and mysterious depths. He yearned to have a submarine of his very own, and decades later, following a successful career as an engineer and entrepreneur, Robbins had the wherewithal to try to build one. Never did he imagine, however, that his quest would turn into a 10-year odyssey testing both his financial resources and his usually tireless good humor. In the following interview, Robbins describes the bumpy journey.
