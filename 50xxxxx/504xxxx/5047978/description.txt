Stephen Burch was born in the south of England, but spent most of his early life traveling around before his family settled in rural Ireland. On their farm is an old abandoned cottage, nearly collapsed but with one room dry and warm enough to make music in.

A vintage acoustic guitar and the family's upright piano, brooms, pots and metal chains. Images of fields, of farm houses, animals, pursuit and escape - characters appear and reappear in different places - dense journey songs - the unifying theme is that of grave drama and possibility within 'The Great Park'.

(Stephen Burch wurde im SÃ¼den von England geboren, verbrachte jedoch den grÃ¶ÃŸten Teil seines frÃ¼hen Lebens damit, herum zu reisen, bevor seine Familie sich im lÃ¤ndlichen Irland niederlieÃŸ. Auf ihrer Farm steht eine verlassene HÃ¼tte, die beinahe in sich zusammenfÃ¤llt, aber ein Zimmer birgt, das trocken und warm genug ist, um Musik darin zu machen.

Eine klassische Akkustikgitarre und das Klavier der Familie, BÃ¼rsten, TÃ¶pfe und Metallketten. Bilder von Feldern, BauernhÃ¤usern, Tieren, Verfolgung und Flucht -- Charaktere erscheinen und tauchen an verschiedenen Orten wieder auf -- dichte Reiselieder -- die einenden Motive sind die von todernstem Drama und MÃ¶glichkeiten innerhalb des 'Great Park'.)


"Intimate morose folk songs, rooted in a strange personal world of fields and birds and love and persecution." (Southcoasting blog')

"...this is a journey, a misadventurer's odyssey; it's vivid, it's elemental and the wounds are exposed. The road is pitted and merciless, stark and unyielding. The engrossing imagery will draw you in and repeated listening reveals new musical and lyrical nuances." (Nigel Johnson)
