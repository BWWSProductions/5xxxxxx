This is an album which I compiled using tracks from both Viva la Vida and Prospekt's March, as well as a few of my own edits. I believe that I have made what was an incredible album even better. This is what Viva la Vida should have been. I even created my own album art for it using the artwork from the LiT2 single. Modified or swapped tracks are marked with a * and changes are noted at the end.

Tracklisting:

*Life in Technicolor: this is an exclusive track that I created by splicing together LiT 1 and 2, while maintaining the seamless transition into Cemeteries of London. It was created with the utmost attention to detail and sounds like an original studio release.

*Lost: this is the "?" acoustic version.

*Yes: has the "Chinese Sleep Chant" hidden track removed.

*Lovers in Japan: this is the "Osaka Sun Mix" from Prospekt's March

*Strawberry Swing: this is the radio edit that was used in the music video that does not have talking and clapping over the intro (as in the album version)

*Death and All His Friends: the hidden track "The Escapist" has been removed and added as a standalone track
