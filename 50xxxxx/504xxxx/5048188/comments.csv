,kampsefo,2009-08-09T07:35Z,"Hey polifem2009 how come you fill request for some people and you ignore other? I think it's not cool at least response would be good. You have done many known Japanese directors but you ommited mavericks like Seijun Suzuki and Fukasaku. The Yakuza Papapers movies by Fukasaku would be much  appreaciated. I hope I have not offended you with my honest comment and you will fill some of my request.

Regards"
