All the songs on the album were written by Ray Levin and arranged by the band.

The Little Boy Blues were formed in 1964 by Ray Levin(bass, piano), Paul Ostroff(lead guitar), Lowell Shyette(vocals, guitar) and James Boyce(drums), while they were attending the University of Illinois at Chicago. They started out playing Chicago Blues and songs like "Heartbreak Hotel." Lowell's neighbor, the owner of IRC records, heard the band and signed them to a recording contract soon after they formed. The record company wanted them to record in a more commercial style, so they dropped their blues style and recorded their first single with a British Invasion sound. The single featured two Lowell Shyette originals, "Look At The Sun" and "Love For A Day."
