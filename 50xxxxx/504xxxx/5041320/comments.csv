[T],eXPer1ence,2009-08-04T23:25Z,"Exact same release as this one posted yesterday:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5039629/Windows_Tiny7_Unattended_Activated_CD_%28x86%29_-_eXPerience

Except the original release has more seeds.

So why post it again?

Folks, unless the MD5 matches, don't even use this!

,malchomalchev,2009-08-06T11:18Z,"Sorry, but I can't manage to start my local network discovery. Internet connection is OK, but can't see or browse the local network. Activated the 4 services (SAM, Computer Browser, Server & Workstation), also enabled Network Discovery & File&Print Sharing without pasword protection and 128bit encoding, shared a folder - still no luck. Anyone can help??!?"

,mad_onra,2009-10-11T16:55Z,"Fast!! But, several troublesome bugs. use instead Rev01 :
""Windows Tiny7 Rev01 Unattended Activated CD"""
,mad_onra,2009-10-11T17:05Z,Sorry! try Tiny7 Rev02
,mad_onra,2009-10-13T06:37Z,Sorry again. The main bug (rev00 and rev01) was due to damaged partition tables on MY harddisks. I have not been able to find a torrent for rev02 so it seems rev01 is the latest available. Starts in 20 secs and shut down in 8 secs.
