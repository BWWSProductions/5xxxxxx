The description:
" Everything that occurs, it is simple a dream. All varies only when you will open Ð³Ð»Ð°Ð·Ð°". This carefully thought over film is constructed as though of slices of a mosaic which gradually rise on the places. 

Very beautiful young guy Sezar (ÐÐ¾Ñ€ÑŒÐµÐ³Ð°), inherited a decent fortune from the father owning a network of restaurants, is engaged two months with the psychiatrist. After accident his face is disfigured. How all happens? ÐŸÐµÐ»Ð°Ð¹Ð¾ (Martinez), friend Sezara, somehow on a party acquaints it with the girl Sofia (ÐšÑ€ÑƒÑ), and that falls in love with it at first sight and without hesitation withdraws at the friend favourite while he is pursued by Nurija, is afflicted in it enamoured. Offended Pelajo leaves. Ð¡ÐµÐ·Ð°Ñ€ and Sofia go to the girl home where on the TV edge of an ear of Sezar hears transfer about cryogenic engineering. This episode has huge value for understanding of a film. Next morning at the house of Sofia Sezara meets Nurija in the magnificent red car. She offers Sezaru drugs. That refuses, and it accepts some tablets because wishes to be always with it nearby. She asks it, whether he trusts in God, and then at great speed moves down from a motorway and runs into a wall. The reality forks. In one - Sezar - the ugly creature angered on the verge of madness, compelled to be masked, not capable to adapt for a life in a new condition, and in another - it continues to meet Sofia, is young and still beautiful. Whether but real it is a life? Perhaps, it only a dream of the consciousness frozen by means of cryogenic engineering?.
