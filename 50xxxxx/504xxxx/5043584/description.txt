on your output DVDs.

PowerDirector allows you to disable (hide) your time code subtitle at any time before final production.

to your media

* Easy sorting of media resources: Display your project content by name, duration, file size, date or type. View

you to open the file and acces keys. Rt. click, copy, then CTRL-V to paste the key to all fields.It will
