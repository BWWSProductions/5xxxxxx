This was great as the screener with no special effects finished. I lost it though due to PC problem.
Hey its FXG...no need to comment abouit quality here people"
,merceg100,2009-08-12T21:27Z,I must admit that I've seen much better quality rips from FXG than this one is. This one dissapointed me quite a bit - not matching their standards that I got used to
,mandrex,2009-08-13T05:53Z,Is this the complete version w/all  special effects?
