,brianxxx,2009-08-06T17:15Z,"The 1.7 update runs just fine and 1.6 and 1.7 updates do not modify the Fallout Launcher so all 1.5 NODVD patches will continue to work. In fact, 1.7 seems to have solved a lot of issues some people had...BUT it is only supposed to add achievements for Zeta according to Bethesda.  It did stop some weirdness I had. 

I own a legal copy of FALLOUT 3 since it was so good, it deserved to be bought...but I use NO DVD patches so I don't have to bow to the corporations and M$ GFW Live and register, log in, etc. 

I HATE THAT !!!!!!! So fuck 'em! lol"
