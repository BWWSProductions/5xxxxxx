,Juggalett420,2012-05-07T13:16Z,I just downloaded one season at a time and it only took a hour or two for each season. so instead of waiting a week or a month! just do one at a time its ALOT FASTER! and my computer wont play avi files so if yours is only playing the sound not the vido get anyvideoconverter *free version* and it work great!
,Juggalett420,2012-05-07T14:33Z,ok in my other comment i said each season took an hour or two if you download them 1 season at a time it took about 30 minutes to download season 2 so i would definitely say download 1 season at a time is SOOOOOO MUCH FASTER just FYI
