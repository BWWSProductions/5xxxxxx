[T],SpandauBaby,2009-08-17T15:24Z,"With this torrent, but not the audio rip the DVD one I have recorded the video into my PC using a Compro Videomate T750 TV card which I got a while ago.  I do like the quality but I want to get it better if I can :-D  Any idea of anybody you might know with a good TV card that can record in ultra high quality these days?  I'm just wondering really, might do some more of these video things in the future but I wanna improve things to make the picture quality look awesome"
