,Max05,2009-08-04T08:00Z,"I couldnt get it to update automatically...
It gave some stupid error.
Instead, copy all the files into your REX folder and replace everything.
Worked for me.. =)"

,FlightSimGuy82,2009-12-04T01:47Z,"DOESN'T WORK!!! Tried to Backup/Restoreation the setting and doesn't do it. Also tried updating the REX weather Engine and doesn't update, doesn't do anything. :("
,4L3Xv,2010-01-03T01:36Z,"@ FlightSimGuy82, or anyone else having his problem;  you have to copy and replace/merge the files and folders in the REX installation folder with the ones in the update. 

Also you need to copy the SimConnect.xml to :\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\Microsoft\FSX of the Server machine

P.S. read the README people, that's why it's there ;)"
,Bullit_NL,2010-02-19T09:00Z,"Thankss!
Working here! :D"
,mOuse_X,2010-03-05T23:08Z,"Perfectly working. It's a real good version with a better weather control engine.

Many Thx !"
,geahanse,2010-03-11T03:25Z,"When changing simconnect.cfg, what port is fsx reserved for?? Does anyone know how I would go about finding this on Windows 7?"
,Varjagen,2010-04-28T01:55Z,"FSX.CFG is not to be found anywhere... 
I have spent 2 hours searching for that file, but nothing is found. REX starts up but without beinbg able to find the fcx.cfg file it will not continue.
Why is this particular file so dofficult to locate? I am certain that it is not where it is supposed to be. And hidden files is not hidden anymore either...
Anybody with some good ideas that have not been mentioned previously here?
Thank you!"
