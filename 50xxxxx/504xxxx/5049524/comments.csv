,sharebird,2009-08-19T00:59Z,"There is a discussion here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5052418/Total_Commander_7.50_RC1_Portable

that the Thinstall app used to generate these portable apps is infected... The apps themselves are scanning clean, but when they run they unpack a svchost.exe, usually as part of a file open dialog.  

We appreciate NoExcuses' efforts and don't want to undermine them, but right now all of his portable apps are suspect.

Sorry mate, but you might want do do what fredpc did, download a different copy of thinstall.

Just wanted to spread the word, because this particular virus hides itself very well."

BTW, you are attaching your comments to almost all my uploads, also the ones not built up with Thinstall, so that for sure they could not be infected by the supposed virus you say. I'm quite tolerant, but not too much, so if you want to add your comments only to the uploads that show the problem should be great, not also to the good ones. Don't spread panic around about uploads that you haven't tested, and as I say in my comments, if you find something wrong in any upload, not only in mine, go tell it at

http://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34

and the mods will take care of them.



These uploads are free of charge for all and if your AV tells you not to use some of them, then obey but stop spreading havoc on all the other uploads, specially when they don't have any problem. Spreading around wrong comments is considered annoying, and you can be banned for that..."

,qwertybnm,2010-08-24T17:47Z,"This prog nuked my Windows XP sp3 (home) installation; the other popular paragon torrent (the non-portable, ver.11) worked fine. For that reason, I would be wary of this one.

I have a netbook with 3 partitions on its drive. I tried to combine the C partition (with the OS on it) with the D partition (big empty partition) using the NoExcuses version of Paragon here. Seems to have eaten the MBR or something, so computer was unable to restart. Luckily I was able to boot to last known good configuration and do a system restore. 

Did exactly the same operation with a different non portable version of paragon, and it worked great. 

Who knows, it may work for some people, but be careful with this one. "
