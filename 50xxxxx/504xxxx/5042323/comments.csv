,spookytoothe,2009-10-12T23:50Z,Thank you very much! This is the best copy I could find. Some of the older movies can be hard to find.
,armygrunt09,2009-11-10T04:58Z,"10/10 thanks , been looking for this = +1"
,12levelsfightgear,2009-11-20T21:36Z,wow thank you this is my first download withouy any bullshit in it. i didnt have to zip it or download some special player to watch this movie just a simple click thats nice. i wonder why doesn't everyone do this
,voltsin,2009-12-09T22:50Z,"Video quality isn't that great, especially given that the file is almost 900MB & video is encoded at 989KBps.  

Also, the person who encoded this did not crop the black bars from the top/bottom.  Get this only if you're desperate to watch this movie.  

Note that I haven't watched this copy yet so can't comment any further."
,voltsin,2009-12-09T23:00Z,"Oh yeah, & the video is actually encoded at 640x480.

So while the movie itself, taking into account the letterbox, is the correct AR - you may find that some players will automatically stretch the image, so you'll have to play around with settings - no big deal really, but just mentioning it.

Any of these things can be fixed if you use AVISynth."
,voltsin,2010-01-24T10:34Z,"There was one other thing I forgot to mention. The rip hasn't been deinterlaced either. There are several scenes I noticed while flicking through, but one example is around the 1m40s action sequence, interlace lines are clearly noticeable. I tried to deinterlace using AVISynth but the results were ugly at best. "
