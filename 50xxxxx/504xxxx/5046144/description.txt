A collection of training tools to become a human lie detector.

If you've ever watched the show Lie To Me and wanted to learn how to become a lie detector well here's the materials you need to get started.

Please read the READ ME.txt included in the file if your having problems running. There is also an IV50 Codec installer (I've included it in the METT.iso) that needs to be installed before running or the videos will not play in the METT.

The METT and the FACS are ISO's and can be mounted with daemon tools. For the less experienced who dont want to or cant use daemon tools its as easy as burning the ISO's to a CD with Nero or your other favorite burning software (I like Magic ISO). All the other files are basically idiot proof. Just PDF books, AVI video and MP3. If your really having problems just use Foxit reader for the PDF's and VLC Media Player for the MP3's and AVI.

So I hope I've answered any questions you might have. If not just post a comment and I'll try to get back to you ASAP. Thanks for downloading and PLEASE SEED!!!
