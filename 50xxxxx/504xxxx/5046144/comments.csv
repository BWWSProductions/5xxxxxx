,N3CR0S1S,2009-08-07T10:50Z,Anyone who has already downloaded this torrent I'm sorry but the METT CD wasnt working but I fixed it.
,barca1010,2009-08-07T20:38Z,Thanks for putting this up. For some reason when I try to load the mett player.exe it says that I need to insert a disc. I tried burning it to cd and that didnt help. Any ideas on how to get it working?
,N3CR0S1S,2009-08-08T22:17Z,barca1010 when did you download this? I had to replace the torrent because of that but the METT CD should work in this one. I had the problem before because I added the IV50.exe to the ISO so if you have the copy with the IV50 on the cd you should download again. Also be sure you dont edit the ISO before burning or the METT player wont load 
,zeeed,2009-08-13T11:44Z,"I'm having problems with the .iso facs cd as well as METT.iso

,louisriel,2009-11-02T04:26Z,"I have the same problem with the METT.iso, i got everything else to work by copying it over to my mac side but that obviously doesn't work for the software and i get the same insert cd prompt when im running it in windows"
,martenzi,2009-11-07T20:30Z,"I have everything working except the indeo software codec. during ""training"" videos only the sound is working, error message: iv50 decompressor cannot be found. well its spelled out differently but same message. what do i do"
,kyliecoast,2009-11-08T03:30Z,"N3CR0S1S can you please tell us the VOLUME label from the original Mett CD. I think that the exe file checks the volume label of the CD and when it doesn't match it gives that 'wrong CD' error. Probably when you made the ISO file you changed the volume label.
Many thanks."
,kyliecoast,2009-11-08T07:50Z,"I couldn't get the METT CD to work either.
Download it from here instead and mount with daemon tools. Working on Vista:

I don't have a cd drive on my laptop (it's a tiny baby laptop) but from the posts I've read it sounded like I could get it working without? Where do I do the autorun- METT-Program-Player.exe? 
Everytime I've tried to open it in different ways it says ""cannot locate the CD-ROM, please insert correct cd-rom, select ok and restart app"". blah blah blah.
Hope u can help. thanks. "
