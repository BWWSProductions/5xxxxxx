Yasmin Levy is a striking young Israeli singer with a mission: to revive Ladino, the now-endangered language that was spoken by Spanish Jews until their expulsion in the late 15th century, when their songs and culture were dispersed around the Mediterranean, from north Africa to Turkey. If her aim sounds worthy but academic, don't be put off. Levy is one of the finest singers in the Middle East, and deserves global recognition. She has a gently exquisite and emotional style, and can tackle anything from a traditional Ladino song of longing for Jerusalem, to a Bedouin melody (in which she says she sees "the beauty of Islam"), pained love songs, or her own thoughtful ballads of struggle and hope. The backing for all this matches flamenco-influenced guitar with instruments like the oud, ney flute or qanoun, normally associated with Arabic music. It's a powerful, passionate and intriguing set.
