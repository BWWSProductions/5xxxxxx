Also for all these dumb fucks spamming about viruses - ALL LIES. "
,krazy-d,2011-11-23T07:17Z,"isteal2 failed to tell everyone that the serial key will let you install the program, but you'll have to still activate the dammmm thing. Also, I don't know how reliable the updates are. I was able to 1 update before the activation notice came up and I did notice that the driver that it recommended was not the latest version. That being said, I went ahead and removed the program. So you decide......"
