he says he cracked it in 3 sec. and that the password is a (i can't even change that or anything).
then if i try to open the file, it says the password is wrong!
also it's not registered."
,Ace_boy2099,2009-10-20T09:45Z,has anyone tested this program? So far I have dl'd it and have it trying to unlock a file but the program is CRAWLING.... does anyone know how fast this is suppose to be or know of a way to speed it up? I think the crack worked because it doesn't say anything about a trial or anything.

...I have no idea about the performance because I have not tested it.""

What a massive TIT you are."
,sorcerian,2009-10-27T20:25Z,It is still a trial program even after you copy the crack files to the installed dir and entering a name in help>register. Can't even set the password length becoz of unreg version. Bad software. Don't download this!!!
[T],crazylov3r,2009-11-21T19:01Z,cant even run the program after installation
,KrytoPoison,2009-11-23T08:18Z,"no no look this is what your supposed to do
1)install with this setup or the one from offical website
2) replace the original Exe with the crack
3)start program
4)then load whatever file you want to find PW for
5)start the crack process
6)when it prompts you to buy the program simply hit register with code or w.e type in anything into the box and hit ok it says ty for registering and the process goes on"
,KrytoPoison,2009-11-23T08:20Z,also have a movie ready because if the password is more then 3 characters your going to be waiting for a hell of a long time which is what im doing atm
,reachvarunin,2010-03-15T08:46Z,"@ KrytoPoison : how much time it might take to crack the password for a 700 mb movie.,??"
