I put these on when going to sleep but suddenly I wake up to 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, AND NOW YOU'RE AWAKE!""

It really ruins it."

There is absolutely no reason to worry. Though you don't know me, you can take my word. Hypnosis doesn't affect you permantly in any way shape or form.

Everything that happens during a hypnosis is absolutely and purely natural. Also, anything that happens during this hypnotic state that you not do (or what would go against your morals) you will not do. Also, you're 100% aware of what's happening. The last time I was at a hypnosis, I asked a friend of mine if he ""knew"" what was going on. He said ""Yes"" and that he knew everything that was happening. Also, I asked if he could have ""not done"" what he was doing and said ""yes"" as well, but also noted that he ""didn't have a reason not to"".

It's actually kinda fun to mess with groups of friends when you go over to their houses or have parties. Do a little research on how to induce a trance, also DO NOT forget to find out how to get them out of this trance. Getting hung up on that ""stuck(in reality this isn't possible) in a trance"" thing kinda sucks."

,tripita,2010-07-13T07:41Z,how does this work? you listen to all of them one after the other as you sleep?
,chaucerchris,2010-08-11T23:56Z,Hypnosis is not sleep. It's a relaxed dreamy state. Choose one file to work on one area and listen to it for at least two weeks every day then once everyday other day. If for any reason you're not able to relax with these files it is not a reflection on your ability to go into trance but a persons ability and skills who is trying to assist you to going into an altered state of deep relaxation. This could be for any number of reasons. Their voice and use of tonality or using words in the file that jolt you out of relaxation. Have you tried any of the Paul McKenna or Richard Bandlers NLP hypnosis files? These work great.
,bbcxtra,2010-10-10T11:19Z,WoooW Thanks

,fazal127,2012-05-01T08:21Z,"this stuff really works.i have searched this kind of material much.it helps a lot.
A good suggetion is that if you want to use many sessions than you should download this torrent or torrents like this.download a mp joiner cutter sofware than cut these sessions in that way that at start you put session which have induction and at the end put the session which has wakeup.in middle put the middle portions of the mp3's. in this way you may have upto 1 hr of long session.before gong to sleep listen it.you will sleep while listening.i am doing it for one month.very very effective it is."
