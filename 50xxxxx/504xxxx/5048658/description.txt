Second part of the April 30 and May 1, 1966 performance at Mitchellâ€™s Studio Club, Los Angeles (first part was "I'm All Smiles")

Rec. live at Mitchell's Studio Club, Los Angeles CA, April 30 - May 1, 1966

This is jazz the way I envision it. With a live audience mumbling in the background and a super-swinging rhythm section of Red Mitchell and Donald Bailey and a technical master at the piano: Hampton. Recorded in LA in 1966, this is a beautiful trio album. Every tune is lively and full of brilliant dialogue between Hampton and his band. ~ Ahmed Chronwell
