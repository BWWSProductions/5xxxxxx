Further, APE is dying day by day because of contradictory licencing and it is a resource hog - so of little use to portable devices. The idea that APE files are smaller was proved untrue many moons ago - wikipedia is wrong. On the plus side, as APE is lossless we can just convert it to FLAC with no harm done. Even so, it's time to let this venerable format go to codec heaven."
