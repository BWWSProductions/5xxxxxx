,dlectro,2011-01-19T10:23Z,"Is this the US version that starts with the Columbia Pictures intro (23.976 fps, 2h5m length) ?
Or the EU version that starts with the Gaumont intro (25 fps, 2h1m length) ?
The reason i'm asking is that i have an audio track i want to mux, and i need the same fps."
,dlectro,2011-01-22T09:08Z,"I downloaded it, this is the US version.
Also this has letterboxes (black bars at the top and bottom).
Better rip here (no letterboxes): http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4919370"
