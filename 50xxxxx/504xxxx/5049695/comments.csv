,elax666,2009-08-12T11:06Z,"Thanks a lot! By the way.... IÂ´ve heard a lot of rumours about this site, about how U will have 2 pay 4 different services and so on. About how this site will be a 100% legal. I really donÂ´t get how sharing between friends can be illegal, but still. Does anybody know if any of this is true? Thanks again 4 sharing extremezone U rock!"
,o00o,2009-08-26T02:56Z,"yes the shutdown is for real and they are goin to a subscription service it will be kinda like Napster if u were around for that, but they are going to do what they've been doing for as long as possible. these things take time to happen so use while u can"
,buubonic,2009-11-24T19:50Z,"yeah there will be a shutdown of tpb...but don't forget there are TONS of torrent trackers and sites out there to choose from. tpb is, unfortunately, the scapegoat for the greedy riaa and mpaa to use as their example in their ""fight against piracy"". SEEED MF'ers!!! SEEED!"
