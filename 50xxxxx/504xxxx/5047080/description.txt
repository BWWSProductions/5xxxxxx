Solving problems in course work is an exercise of the mental facilities,
and examination problems are usually chosen, or set similar to such problems.
Working out problems is thus an essential and important aspect of
the study of physics.
The problems have been carefully chosen from a total of 3100 problems,
collected from the China-U.S.A. Physics Examination and Application
Program, the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination on Experimental High
Energy Physics sponsored by Chao-Chong Ting, and the graduate qualifying
examinations of seven world-renowned American universities: Columbia
University, the University of California at Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, the University of Wisconsin, the University of Chicago,
Princeton University, and the State University of New York at Buffalo.
This volume on Atomic, Nuclear and Particle Physics which contains
483 problems is divided into four parts: Atomic and Molecular Physics
(142), Nuclear Physics (120), Particle Physics (90), Experimental Methods
and Miscellaneous topics (131).
This volume was the result of the collective efforts of forty physicists
involved in working out and checking of the solutions, notably Ren Yong,
Qian Jian-ming, Chen Tao, Cui Ning-zhuo, Mo Hai-ding, Gong Zhu-fang
and Yang Bao-zhong.
