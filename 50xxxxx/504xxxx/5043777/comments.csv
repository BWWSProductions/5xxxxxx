,brendaleyland,2009-08-06T12:00Z,Sometimes I wonder about some of you seeders - Spongebob Squarepants Greatest Hits - do me a favour - how old are you? my 7year old wouldn't even call this music.
,lenchris,2009-08-07T05:04Z,"brendaleyland your 7 year old might not call this music, but my 3 and 5 year old granddaughters love it. So I'll take it your comment just shows your lack of intelligence. Thank you for this . "
,sebo1084,2009-08-13T05:32Z,"Yes, my 2 year old adores this stuff, so please take your negativity elsewhere because it is not wanted here. If your 7 year old would not listen to this, then why are you even on this page. I don't see that you have shared anything with the community so do us a favor, keep the criticism to yourself, and thank you TheKooksSeeTheSun for this upload."
