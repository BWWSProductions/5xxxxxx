Type: 001 FILE

mintywhite-1003-fonts-megapack.zip.002
Type: 002 FILE
Size: 20MB
mintywhite-1003-fonts-megapack.zip.003
Type: 003 FILE

Size 19.3 MB

All 4 are in .FILE extensions. How can i open and use this?

,mlc666,2009-08-14T18:46Z,use 7zip or winrar to extract them
,twoedge,2009-08-22T04:40Z,or just rename the end .001.zip
,BlowBye,2009-09-24T14:51Z,"Thanks for the effort but this does not work. WinRAR can open the files, the contents is viewable but nothing can be extracted."
,Tusker,2009-10-05T04:00Z,You need a program called HJ Split or Jaxe either is free.  Just Google them they have been around for years.  They will handle any file that ends with .001 etc.
,Tusker,2009-10-05T04:03Z,From the file ending xx.zip.001 you will need to run HJ Split which should join the four files into a zip file to unzip.
