,bitabur,2009-08-14T01:57Z,"The english dub for this one is really good, much better than reading subtitles.

Also, I've been DL'in this for about a week and im just past 50% so if you finish please seed."
,chetanrajgur,2009-10-03T04:25Z,"Is it 2001 eng. version or 1988 ??
in 2001 version, the main protagainist's voice is given by Jh0nny YOung Bosch, Better known for Nero in DMC 4 and ichigo in Bleach."
,Bloodshed5270,2010-02-02T05:45Z,SEED PLEASE!!!
,owns_1,2010-02-21T22:28Z,"@chetanrajgur
This is the 1988 version."
[T],zeromancer,2010-04-21T09:24Z,"So is this 1920x1080, or is it cropped?"
,blackxino,2010-07-21T22:59Z,"1988 version but in hd.
remastered is the 2002 version with new dubbing.

this version has the 2002 english dubbing.

i see no point in actually buying this on bluray itself, since you only see text more sharper and bigger. Other than seeing texts in drawing bigger, everything else looks HQ.

Thanks for putting this up, now i don't have to waste my money on this version."

,mike18xx2,2011-02-21T16:20Z,"Fwackin' Christ....  We have two guys making different claims about whether it's the 1988 or 2001 English dub -- so, which is it?

Which is better? (And by ""better"" I mean better voice-acting, not word-for-word true to Japanese dialogue.)

(Not that it's a big deal to mux audio-tracks in MKVmerger, but just whinin' here....)"
