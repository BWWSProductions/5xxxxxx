Audio quality is good, but if your looking for a specific song you might want to pay attention to the timestamp."

Enjoyed this mix a lot, quality is indeed good. Excellent to listen to on a good Hi-Fi system with a dvd-player that supports usb-sticks, or just write it on a cd-r(w) and enjoy the benefits of your quality Hi-Fi (if you're lucky to have one) :)"
