look here: http://snd.astalavista.ms/board/
if you register you can ask specific crack requests like  Atomic Mail Sender 5.10. There are a lot of very talented people there and I think you have the app. within a day or maybe a day or two.

,THX_1138,2009-08-23T05:54Z,"Anyone else havin a problem getting this program to launch? In the instructions below it says to ""Install setup.exe"" Well... there is no setup file. Just one file ""OJOsoft Total Video Converter.exe"" Since this is a portable I expected the program would just launch after clicking on the exe. Can anyone help me out here? Thx."
