In this epic documentary series, The Universe takes you to the leading edge of our ever-expanding astronomical knowledge. A virtual collision of astronomy and history, these dense, enlightening episodes of unprecedented programming give unique insight - through recreations and animations - on the great "Eureka!" moments of celestial understanding and into the very latest celestial discoveries.

This insightful series gives serious, constructive consideration to the great human questions: Are we alone? Is Planet Earth as insignificant to the Cosmos as a drop of water? Is there anywhere else out there that that can support life? Or, is there truly no place like home?

In the first two spectacular seasons of The Universe, The History Channel takes you far beyond the cradle of our home planet to discover the wonders of Deep Space. From Season One's in-depth explorations of our neighboring celestial bodies to Season Two's journeys light-years from Earth, these programs guide you to the most fascinating phenomena and stunning events known to science.

Experience the Cosmos as no-one ever has - not peering at dots through a telescope or scanning pages of numbers - but firsthand. Strikingly realistic computer reconstructions give you a front-row seat at the hottest events in THE UNIVERSE, from colliding celestial bodies to collapsing suns, from distant, possibly viable planets to mysteries that defy explanation.


This set contains the complete first season (episodes 1-14) and the complete second season (15-32). All are TV Rips and of high quality in XviD format. I've put the seasons in two separate folders so you can choose either or both easy enough.



Enjoy and Seed!!
