Yor, the Hunter from the Future

With an optional comedic commentary By Garrett Gilchrist.

Reb Brown from MST3K's Space Mutiny in one of the best bad movies of the 80s,
a very funny 1983 film about a very blonde, very stupid caveman who fights both
 dinosaurs with an axe and robots with a laser gun.

He wanders around aimlessly and every single civilization he comes across, he 
destroys completely, with fire and with flooding. There's no thought process to
 this, or to this film. Yor destroys simply because he is.

He is accompanied by the jealous, spiteful Kallah, who has some crazy 80s hair
 going on, and attempts to kill anyone else who hits on Yor. There's also Pag, 
an old man who loves his hemp. There are evil blue cavemen, and evil grey 
cavemen. It's nice that evil is color coded.

It all ends up in a sci-fi city for some reason, with the ridiculous villain 
The Overlord, who probably likes to play Dungeons and Dragons, and some pretty 
pathetic future people.

By the end of it, our hero has killed everyone who isn't him and doomed the 
entire future of humanity, as his epic 80s Queen-like theme song plays! Yor! 
Hunter from the Future!
