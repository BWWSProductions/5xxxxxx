About Quadrivium

QIn medieval times the Quadrivium represents the four most important free 'higher' arts (arithmetica, geometrica, astronomia and musica.) The ensemble Quadrivium unites four colors of the medieval musical palette: voice, Ellen Delahanty; recorder, Geert Van Gele; harp, Bill Taylor; and lute, Willem Mook. With their unique historical instrumentary, Quadrivium connects with the audience with a wide array of delicate instrumental colors, typical for the early polyphony of the middle ages and early renaissance.

The international breakthrough of this Belgian based ensemble keeps happening in 2009. Next to giving various concerts in Belgium and the Netherlands, the ensemble has been invited to perform in Germany. Quadrivium, which consists of members from Belgium, the Netherlands, Scotland and America strenghtens its position in the international early music circuit.

organetto), Bill Taylor (harp, psaltery) and Willem Mook (lutes).

The lutes played are a plectrum played 5-course lute, a 6-course alto-lute and a 7-course bass-lute.
Harp and lutes are all strung in gut.

The illustrated booklet in English contains both commentaries on the repertoire and translations
