,maps_5,2009-10-03T13:30Z,"hey.
thanks for the upload, killerdemon.

I would like to ask which format are the files in?

Looking at the size (4.1GB) I would guess that its either xVid or TV.

can you confirm this?

I'm looking forward for the DVD5 version (boxset).

Hope to hear from you soon.
regards."

They are Xvid, just like most other 175mb/20min tv show files :)"
