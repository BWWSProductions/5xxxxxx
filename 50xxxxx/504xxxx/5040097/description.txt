REVERIE SOUND REVUE 2009 Self titled Album

This is the Full-Length release of Reverie Sound Revue's 2009 debut self-titled album. The album, which has been in the works for 4 years, is a much welcomed delight for anyone who heard their 2003 EP and wondered what could have been. I'm at a loss as to why this is the first torrent posted since the album was release in June; please do yourself a favour and give it a listen, share it, feel it, and as always if you like it, buy it.
