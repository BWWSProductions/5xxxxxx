Bird's Eye - Trees

Resolution: from 580*444 up to 1748*1168

The clip-maps of rendered trees are perfect "cut-outs", i.e. blend into their respective background and surrounding beautifully and naturally - they become part of the overall scene and don't look artificial or super-imposed.

Alpha-Channel included
Each picture comes with the matching alpha-channel, which allows for the quick and straightforward use in most CAD-, 3D-design and image processing software programs.

For each tree, an additional shadow layer is provided.

All images are available in the widespread, uncompressed TIF and the Photoshop PSD-formats.
