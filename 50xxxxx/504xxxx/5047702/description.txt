Most songs are from the Unsurpassed Demos & Rehearsals and the Garage Days & More CD's. The editing is really weird on the first CD so I edited the songs + did some hiss reduction and lowered the pitch on the RTL-demos from F# to E. It's not a professional job, I only use Cool Edit. But it sounds much better. 

If you're interested in acoustic covers of Metallica and others, see my other torrents. Enjoy.
