,zen-TAO,2009-08-04T10:46Z,"I am very grateful for everything
that eztv UL, but something must
be said about the lack of speed on
their torrents.

I dont know what the problem is,
but they rarely come up over 50kbps,
at least not for me. I get higher speed
on other places, so it must be at eztv:s end.
(Can it be that your site
 has been down for long?) Because like
this it wasnt a couple of years ago.

I know its for free and all that, but maybe
people starts to abandon eztv and choose
faster DLs instead.

I know eztv is trusted and you always 
know what you get, but maybe You can
have both trust and speed?

Peace and Love!

,Tragonn,2009-08-04T17:40Z,"@zen-tao
A common misstake is that you strangle your downloadspeed. If you are using ADSL/DSL then you have a limited ""space"". Your upload AND download SHARE this ""space"". So if your upload is at maximum then there is no room for any downloading, ie you get crap dlspeed but you are uploading at full capacity.

You should set the  maximum upload speed to at the MOST 80% of what you possibly can(check with your ISP for what your maximum upload is).  If you have set it to unlimited then your upload will be taking up 100% of the ""space"", and you will basically not download anything.

Google some and you can find guides about this. And if you are not using your internetconnection (not downloading anything) then by all means feel free to use all your upload capacity to share a FEW items."

,zen-TAO,2009-08-05T03:02Z,"@Tragonn.
Thanks for your information.
I use FDM (freedownloadmanager) because its faster than Utorrent. I will look in the settings and try to do some adjustments. (But If I remeber it right, I did try it before without
any result.)"
