Many thanks for posting this but I've noticed that Superstars isn't available on here each week which is a shame as it's the only WWE show that I don't get to watch living in England.
If anyone out there can upload Superstars each week, it would be awesome as I really need to watch that show!
Also if anyone would be kind enough to send me an invite for the other torrent site beginning with ""D"" - you know the one! - please send to me at:
zombiewrestling (at) yahoo  co  uk

Many thanks!"
