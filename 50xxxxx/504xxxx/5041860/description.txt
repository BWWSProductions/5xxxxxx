At the BP Oil Refinery in Texas City, a test on the distillation tower goes wrong. Liquid waste     
builds up in the tower and flows out through the blowout tower. A white ute left with its engine    
running ignites the fumes of the waste liquid. The explosion destroys a trailer placed dangerously  
close to the blowout tower. 15 workers die.
