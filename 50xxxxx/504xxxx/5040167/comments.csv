,flashboy94,2009-10-08T01:38Z,Tell me if you have any problem.
,fascinao,2009-12-01T07:14Z,"The problem is not the crack itself. It works. The real problem is it was not completely cracked. You can only create 30 frames and that's it, the software puts another barrier that won't let you use it further.

The crackers gotta look deeper into it. Are you listening? :-)"
,flashboy94,2010-04-22T16:20Z,"@fascinao

,Bennethon,2010-04-23T00:26Z,"I was able to export 34 frame storyboard to PFD, no problem.  Seems to work fine."
,lacey2,2010-05-01T06:11Z,"I'm afraid I have to agree with fascinao. The difference here is when I try to open a file with more than 30 shots, instead of getting the usual denial message, the program simply closes down."

,simonmack,2011-04-16T07:55Z,Hi all - anyone know where I can get a MAC version of this??? Please help... Been searching high and low and am very new to this...
,frddrg,2012-04-10T20:45Z,"Even cracked, the software still has a limitation of 30 shots per project, which renders it useless for most people. This crack must be fixed, or it will remain worthless."
,frddrg,2012-04-10T20:47Z,Still the same old 30 shot limitation problem...
,frddrg,2012-04-10T20:48Z,"You can create over 30 shots, but if you save it, and close the software, it will not open the project again. The error message is very clear."
