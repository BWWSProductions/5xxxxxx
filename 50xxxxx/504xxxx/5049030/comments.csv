[T],gamerguuy,2009-08-09T10:30Z,well you are out of luck if your psp is having TA-088v3 motherboard and i think your ps IS HAVING TA-088v3 motherboard.If it's not having TA-088v3 motherboard then you will have to use pandora battery and magic memory stick.You will have to find out that is your motherboard TA-088v3 or not.
,blue_1294,2009-08-09T10:37Z,how do i do that
