,JiiimJimJim,2009-08-04T23:39Z,but the english version is not out yet? only the german one :O
,fracicone,2009-08-04T23:42Z,So what does this exactly do? A user on another forum told me that it does NOT translate voiceovers to english...
,juzto,2009-08-05T05:51Z,"This changes all text based input to english instead of german.

This package solves 2th loadscreen error that all people got with using english text."
,monslayer,2009-08-05T13:10Z,"but hase any1 made the crack or file that starts the game , rely need it!!!"
,juzto,2009-08-05T14:17Z,"There is no crack for this game yet, use virtual cd 9.x and it is tricking your comp to think it is a real dvd you got."
,SkeLLLa,2009-08-05T16:36Z,"Oh... The patch, that changes language to English correctly is only 650kb!

,IronBars,2009-08-05T19:21Z,anyone can confirm this really works? 
,juzto,2009-08-06T05:20Z,Been playing 35H+ now  in 2 days with it so far all works.
,juzto,2009-08-06T15:11Z,"It is only english text(only found 1 word in that wasnt translated) Honestly kinda funny listning on all those german scream around.
Ive upgraded it to 1.01 yes before i installed hot fix (should not make and difference)

And no I am not using any cracks only this the game found on PB+1.01 patch + this hot fix + virtual cd 9.X(to mount game in ""normal"" cd room"""
,junnujoonas,2009-08-10T12:59Z,"Juzto(or someone): How You get the book in place where there is 4 levels in elevator(ground+1-3)? Got the key next to dead guy behind the rocks and one key from the creature which wakes up from torturetable. Lighted two candles and door opened in middle. That's that (although theres seems to be more rooms behind the ""tortureroom"" according to map). Can't open 1st or 3rd floors doors."
,juzto,2009-08-10T15:32Z,"junnujoonas, kinda hard to help you sins im not sure what dungeon or place in game your at :) more closer details of where you are?"
,JiiimJimJim,2009-08-13T23:07Z,"it doesn't change language for me ? i have added the reg file and replaced the dialogs, when i start the game the menus is still in german? or does this only change dialogs? not the menus ?"
,juzto,2009-08-15T22:31Z,"SkeLLLa, your only showing to a registry changer but not fix 2th load screen error when editing it to english.

peter123gan, hard to say (little info)

JiiimJimJim, you should have all menus + textdialog on english (except 1 word found not translated so far in option)"
,Alaron251,2009-08-16T00:34Z,There is a better one than this that is only 600kb and it does it all for you. This FAILS.
,juzto,2009-08-17T07:52Z,"Alaron251, 600kb file you speak about does not completly fix load screeen error. Test before speak next time ;)"
,christian_persson,2009-08-17T17:06Z,"gamecopyworld.com has language changer and its only 648 kb and its working fine
instead of this one that is 687.75 mb"
,maylolik,2009-08-19T04:24Z,"Why does this get stuck at the entrance of the city by the guard (during the first mission)???  It only lets me move the camera up and down, I'm assuming it's this language fix because the guard might be opening a dialogue where it gets stuck."
,nooberoid,2009-09-24T23:53Z,"stil doesnt work??

just stays on the loading screen after making character :(("
