[V],polifem2009,2009-08-11T21:31Z,I'm sorry for all this but azureus seems to be able to save my problem with the pestering moron.
,tauffen,2009-08-11T22:33Z,"Yeah... I've tried to post you a message yesterday, but seems that TPB went down in my country. Another solution could be using a IP blocker, like Peer Guardian or Peer Block.
Even I don't have anything to do with this moron, I'm sorry for this kind of behaviour. Seems to me that some people simply cannot understand the real values of ""sharing"" and ""comunity""...

By the way, thanks for the reseeding of the Peony. I'll seed all of them from now on, thanks. Just waiting for the #8 to complete the collection! Cheers!"

,kampsefo,2009-08-12T00:01Z,"Polifem that's the sad truth of public trackers in general: many people will flatter you just to get their fix and what they want from you but won't seed back once they have finished the download because they don't have to. You just have to live with it. Anyway the pros still outweigh the cons.

Regards"

That's why I think if just a few aware people seed at least one of their favorite torrents, we'll be able to mantain this. I'm a member of 3 private trackers, but I think I can have a piece o participation here too. Like you said: I don't have to. But I will. That's why I'm seeding in the possible way I can the Peony Gambler movies. People come and grab and go, and even now I'm the only seeder. But I'll still be seeding. Course, right now people have to be patient, thanks to the hit and runners. But it's better to wait and have the movie than don't because no one seed it anymore."

[V],polifem2009,2009-08-13T07:14Z,@titestef: there a few scenes shortened or deleted due to kinkyness. I won't share the graphic details.
,shango,2009-08-23T17:44Z,Do you still need help blocking someone? I would be glad to help you to show you how to do it. It works well providing they cant change ips easy.
