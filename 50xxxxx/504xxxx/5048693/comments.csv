,PREDATOR_SAS,2010-03-13T22:32Z,"can any one tell me what is the resolution...???
and any thing about the quality...??"
,rippervanwinkle,2010-04-25T04:42Z,"Video specifications 1st episode, as you can see it's not great; very small picture size and low video bitrate.  Even worse is that the aspect ratio is very wrong.  It should be 4:3 but the files are 3:2.  Subjectively the picture is soft with obvious distortion due to the bad AR, and there are other artefacts associated with low bitrate.  Overall not a good release but maybe worth watching anyway for the content.
