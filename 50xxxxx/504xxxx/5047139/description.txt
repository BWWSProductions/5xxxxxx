Original Pirate Material - The Streets [2002]
	



Original Pirate Material is the debut album by UK act The Streets.

The album is a unique take on UK garage and lyrics dealing with everyday circumstances and occurrences. The album received massive acclaim from the music press and was embraced by fans of indie and rock music, as well as fans of garage. The album originally rose to #12 on the UK Albums Chart in 2002, but peaked at #10 in 2004 after the release of his significantly more successful second album A Grand Don't Come for Free. 
In the United Kingdom, five singles were released from Original Pirate Material: "Has It Come to This?", "Let's Push Things Forward", "Weak Become Heroes", "Don't Mug Yourself" and "The Irony of It All".
The cover artwork photograph of Original Pirate Material is by German photographer Rut Blees Luxemburg called Towering Inferno. The towerblock pictured is Kestrel House on City Road, London.
In March 2003, NME placed Original Pirate Material at number 46 on their list of the '100 Best Albums of All Time'
