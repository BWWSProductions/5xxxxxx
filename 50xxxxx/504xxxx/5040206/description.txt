((Thorlock)) play a kind of Southbound stoner-doomly fuckyouupcore that only Bulletwolf do more drunkenly and Orange Goblin mastered on their last album, Healing through Fire. Think Melvins, get stoned, think more Melvins, but if their self-titled, self-released full-length is any indicator, ((Thorlock)) have two main modes in which they operate: a straightforward aggressive rock that calls to mind adjectival phrases like â€œwhiskey-fueledâ€ and â€œballs outâ€ â€” as heard on â€œMan Will Lose,â€ â€œTriceratopsâ€ and elsewhere â€” and a full-on feedback shitstorm that only appears twice, on â€œMississippi Wheelwashâ€ and closer â€œBeyond Cosmic Dimensions.â€

Review:
"have to be honest here,even though this band is on my friend list on Myspace i haven't had much time to spend listening to their material so getting hold of their self titled album was a real awakening.For the most part ((Thorlock)) play a kind of Stoner Doom meets Southern type of groove rock but then they have some real surprises in store on this release.The album has two centerpieces â€œMississippi Wheelwashâ€ and closer â€œBeyond Cosmic Dimensions",both being around the 18 minute mark these tracks are a feast of feedback and Doom.

Great as they are,these tracks are the hardest tunes to endure because of the length of the tracks.The guitar work on these two have a real pulsating feel that pummels the listener.The rest of the album though is a different kettle of rock,still heavy and still very stoner but asskicking from a direction you may not expect.Tunes like â€œExtinctâ€ and â€œAssneck" get you headbanging in a whiskey fueled kind of way but then the real surprises take place.Covers of Kiss "Deuce" and Neil Youngs "Rockin In The Free World" turn the thing on its head.

Good versions of these songs but something i really didn't given the context of the rest of the album.I made the mistake of setting my CD player on random when i first listened to this so after sitting through the 18 minutes of "Beyond Cosmic Dimensions" to be confronted with a Kiss tune was like what the hell is going on !This is the sort of album that will appeal to fans of Sleep type bands but could also fit into the party band setting.I was having a few beverages when i first gave this a spin and it seem to fit the mood very well.At the end of the day this is a "Stoner Doom" album but one that is unique even if it is just the two covers they play.Give it a try,i dig it.8.5/10"
