it was very hard subbing it using a shitty vhs ripp barely watchable. 95% I managed, but in 4% I had to use a 'logical' guess of which I'm pretty sure but the remaining 1% consisted only of one letter or word per sub so I just put that word and dots. That's why I've included the .srt and .sup files. It'd be great if anyone(a Japanese speaking anyone) could take the time to fill the gaps or make the necessary corrections where needed.


and here's the corrected .SUP file. if you feel the need you can re-author it in 30 min.
unfortunately it seems thelink isn't accepted. if you need the corrected .SUP file let me know,
