,tornflag,2010-03-03T01:56Z,"If you want the original RARs, you can reconstruct them with these .AVI files, the program found here:
http://rescene.info/

and the .SRR files found here:
http://xvid.rescene.info/search.aspx?q=dexter+bdrip+xvid+saints

You can also reconstruct the samples with the .SRS files found there.

For the subs you'll have to look elsewhere. They have the naming scheme:
dexter.s03e##.bdrip.xvid.subs-saints.rar"
