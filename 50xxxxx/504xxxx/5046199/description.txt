Now, with family life, a day job catching killers and an uncontrollable urge to do away with the ones that get away, Dexterâ€™s got his work cut out for him. And when a high-profile case sides him with powerful Assistant DA Miguel Prado, the pressure might be too great for even our beloved Dexter to hack.
