Coda is a one-window web development app. Coda takes all of the tools you need to build the future of the web, including an integrated file browser, fully-featured text editor, CSS editor, preview, built-in terminal, and complete set of reference, and wraps it all in a single elegant interface.

Tiger + Leopard.

[UPDATE] If the serial doesn't work (it does for me but whatever) your can either check the serial box or download a cracked plist: thepiratebay.org/torrent/5044447
