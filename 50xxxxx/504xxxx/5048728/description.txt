What do the buildings we construct say about us as people? Dan Cruickshank travels across the world, celebrating different types of architecture and showing how our buildings reveal our aspirations, our ingenuity and our beliefs. 

In each programme, buildings from all over the world are dramatically juxtaposed, revealing unexpected connections between very different types of architecture. From the Kizhi Cathedral in remote northwest Russia to the convent of St Catherine in Sinai, Egypt, and themes that range from beauty, to power, paradise and pleasure, this series is a monumental journey that takes in some monumental structures, gradually building an architectural knowledge so that, through the series, a story of world architecture is told.
