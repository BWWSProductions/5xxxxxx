,DSpider,2009-08-09T12:32Z,"The Godfather, sure. But only the first part. The second and third were much weaker. Also, a conversion of ""The Patriot Extended Cut 1080p BluRay multi x264 H2"" would be great. Thanks."

You mentioned you had 2 copies of iron man and i found one, but it is in two parts and has german subs in it. Do you have a second version that is in one part and does not have german subs? If yes, could you provide the link?


Thanks"
