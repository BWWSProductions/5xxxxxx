,wolfmangling,2009-09-21T10:10Z,All of the lord of the rings files were corrupted & wouldn't download...
,psychdude,2009-10-08T05:56Z,Is wolfmangling's comment true? corrupted files?
,Me_Too,2009-10-24T17:58Z,"In the .torrent-file there's an invalid character (|) in some pathnames. Some torrent-clients don't understand it (e.g. BitLord) and gives an error. Some other clients (e.g. uTorrent) works OK.

So far all the files seems to be just fine.

Big thanks to sheila6!"
