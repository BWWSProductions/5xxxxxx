The great Russian Composeer torrent, Harry Belafonte compilation, Charles Aznavour..I will seed them to the best of my abilities.

Could you also inform us as to where to follow you since TPB is going down ( or should I say changing hands end of this month ) and we are expecting lot of deletions of accounts and torrents ?

I suggest you may try h,33,t  website ( very HQ uploads there ) 
and  1 3 3 7x  amongst the Public BT websites .

Many thanks for ur contributions so far :)"
