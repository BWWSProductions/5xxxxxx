,kltsin,2009-08-05T01:20Z,"I messed up this torrent, file name""FG"" confusing, also 'web seed' was linked to a non hotling site. I don't have a pc w/ internet, all of this is done via my phone, (htc-8900(aka kaiser/TyTn2/tilit etc), wm6.1 wmtorrent).
  Fixed both by re-uploading w/ proper name and site that allows hot-linking/leeching incase I can't seed my own torrent when out of wifi range.
new torrent is here..http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5042235/Family_Guy_Episode_Guide_1-7__kltsin.doc"
