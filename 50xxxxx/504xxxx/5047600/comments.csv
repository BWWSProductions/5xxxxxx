,mroboto,2009-08-08T10:18Z,"is this the beta 5 ? because i have downloaded the english beta 5 with key just minutes before,i go to rarlab to found my language version and only the beta 5 is available for download at this time,so i'm confused because you tell 3.90 and it's not available to me on rarlab."
