Either way, its great to have a dvd quality version of a rare movie like this that probably will never get an official release. I like the alternate name poster you have up here."

The main goal of decoding was to make possible view on hardware DVD players."
,mantronixlives,2009-10-12T05:38Z,The mpeg version i uploaded would play fine in all dvd players at a higher quality.....
,vodek,2009-10-18T02:11Z,Not on everyone! For example my DVD (Panasonic SC-PT850) can't play it...
,vodek,2009-10-18T02:22Z,By the way. It will be great to make a subtitles. Lots of non english spoken people like this movie. Subtitles will be big support to understanding.
