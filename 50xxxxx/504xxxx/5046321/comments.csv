,greatmoaning,2010-01-25T12:22Z,"Dear bigborestroker, don't bother yourself reading the description above. Just read the very first word in it 8| And, as usual with patched applications, you don't want to ignore the .nfo"
,pesja,2010-03-16T19:08Z,Could anyone please seed it?
,proxider,2010-07-28T00:52Z,install file was corrupt (it's the trial) and crack does not seem to work with install from the official site
,greatmoaning,2010-08-22T01:12Z,"@proxider
Lame try. May I assume you work with the company?"
,GangOfFour,2010-09-06T11:40Z,"But It's true , the .exe was corrupt for me too , Solution ? Thx"
,greatmoaning,2010-09-17T00:33Z,"Checked it again; all smooth. Just run Earscl5setup.exe, overwrite the installed Ear50s.exe, that's it. If you don't know how to carry out these two actions, ask your mother please."

I'm experiencing the same problem of proxider.

I would suggest you do the test with a download from the torrent. I am not 100% sure but some of the files might be corrupted.

,sideshow1176,2010-11-04T09:50Z,"Just a thought folks, you are aware that ocassionally some files become corrupted in the dl process, hmm? In which case you simply re-dl. Or before you remove the file from your client, run a recheck to check the viability of the files...if the files are incomplete or corrupted, the client will finish what it started. Geez, some people need to be spoon-fed rather than experiment a bit and figure it out--oh wait...that would require common sense and and inquisitive ingenuity. Anyhow, thanks for the up, gretamoaning."
,Tsetsu,2010-11-21T06:53Z,"Downloaded four times.  Each time I get an error telling me the file is corrupted and I need to redownload it from the website.  I followed the instructions to the T (attempted to anyway - couldn't get past the first step).

This seems to be what all the comments are about.  Maybe you should try re-upping, greatmoaning.

The only other EarMaster for Windows apparently contains a trojan.  So, I'm DL'ing Solfege.  It's free anyway.  No dodgy hacking practices or worry of infection.  =p"
,Evangion,2010-12-29T06:36Z,EXE corrupt. Don't bother with this download.
,lambikas,2011-01-25T18:33Z,The EXE file itself is not corrupt. Try turning your computer clock back to 2008 or 2009 and it should bypass the error message.
,caralhentis,2011-04-24T03:25Z,"@lambikas

Dude, I love you, I'm having this problem for more than a year and I didn't know about the solution, I was using EarMaster 4
"
,greatmoaning,2011-05-17T13:33Z,"Alright, due to a cheap trick in the setup file the installation now works this way (thanks to lambikas for discovering):

1. Turn your computer clock back to
    2008 or 2009.
2. Run Earscl5setup.exe.
3. Turn your computer clock back to the future.
4. Copy the patched Ear50s.exe into instll dir.
5. When the registration field appears,
    type in any name & number."
,dillinger1981,2011-09-07T04:32Z,I can't seem to get the crack to work. I still get the evaluation version. Anyone had the same problem?
,knglerxst,2012-07-08T00:07Z,"To crack it, just follow the directions outlined above by greatmoaning.  It worked for me.  Thanks for uploading.  "
