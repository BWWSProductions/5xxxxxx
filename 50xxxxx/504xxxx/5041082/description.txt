Ever found a torrent that had 5000 seeders and your D/L @ 40k/bs to fuckall.

This could be your problem you have to many of these clingon shits that their ISP punishes them for uploading so your swarm is full of tight arse pricks sending you back slow speeds while your U/L them to satisfaction.

I have gone through this and checked the IP's you can cross referance it with iplookup.

To understand this better look here at the data plan of the leachers ISP here.

Just because they went with a ISP not Pirate friendly doesn't mean we have to carry them.

Just add the 2 isp files to peer guardian or cut and copy it to your ipfilter.dat list and these 2 leaching ISPs wont overload your swarm again.
