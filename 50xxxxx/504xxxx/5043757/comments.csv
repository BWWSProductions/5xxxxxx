,Sven the swede,2009-08-06T12:47Z,"I know what you are talking about, Murlok. TPB is a sinking ship. It is enough to look at the amount of added torrents and compare it to a few months ago. The well is running dry. I stopped uploading because I simply don't feel enthusiastic about TPB anymore. 

I'm sticking around to see the new owners take over but of course I have already thought up plans for when I move on. It's not like I believe in the new owners but I'm not really in a hurry to move on either. 

I have a temporary Internet connection right now but when the ship sinks I will upgrade it and probably move on to Usenet or something.

Anyway, I have always appreciated your uploads Murlok and wish you the best. "

,rocketero,2009-08-10T08:19Z,"I have a question: is this compatible with Windows 7 ?

I saw this link
https://www.zonealarm.com/security/en-us/beta-center-details.htm?ifrom=betahome&betaSku=ZAESFDE-BETA-60day-1user&betaCode=ZAESFDE-BETA-60day-1user

where it says this beta program is compatible with windows 7 but I don't see it here in thepiratebay."
,Munkypoo7,2009-08-28T23:39Z,"All of you with issues may just need some common sense, when applying the key make sure you have your internet line disconnected, simple as that, sheesh...

It is NOT Murlok's duty to help absolutely everyone with an issue, everyone should just try and think now and then..

@ Murlok : You will be missed :("
,bingcat,2009-09-18T05:29Z,Good day everybody! Can I update this apps?
,ocyrus70,2009-09-26T19:08Z,"keys don't work, yes they work to install zonealarm but as soon as you update anti virus you get a popup saying ""your subscription has expired"" buy a new subscription and thats to all your keys nothing to do with being a noob and complaining..your shit just don't work!!.."
,sweedishmetal,2009-11-01T17:25Z,"I think Zone Alarm has created some kind of counter-measure for the keys.  I have used this with the keygen for some time and in the last 30 days, both my computers have ZA telling me the subscription expired.  I have reinstalled successfully with the a new key, but as soon as I go back online and update the virus defs, it becomes expired again.

That said, I have been only moderately impressed with this product and am glad I didn't have to shell out money to test this, only to be disappointed.

I recommend using Zone alarm only for a firewall and use another program for virus protection."
[T],sanpork,2009-12-15T09:52Z,"
I haven't used this particular torrent myself (I'm just using ZA Pro myself), but if your copy is reverting back to a trial 
after you reboot, you need to take a few additional steps to keep it registered.  ZoneLabs caught on to the read-only trick;
 you need to take it a bit further.

Install ZA and reboot like usual.  When the system reboots, it'll ask for your key.  Enter your key and immediately reboot.  (You don't want the software doing an update yet.)

Boot into safe mode.  Open Explorer, and locate zllictbl.dat.  In Vista and 7, you'll find it in 
""C:\ProgramData\CheckPoint\ZoneAlarm"".  (ProgramData is hidden.)  In XP, it's in C:\Windows\System32.  

First, bring up the properties and make the file read only.  You're not done, don't reboot.  ZA will turn that read-only
 flag off.  Go to the security tab.  You need to set Administrators and Authenticate Users permissions to Read and 
Read/Execute ONLY.  Turn off ALL write permissions.  This will stop ZA from resetting the read only flag.

That's it, reboot, and you're good to go."
