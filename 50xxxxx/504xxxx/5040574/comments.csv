[V],mothergoose56,2009-08-04T19:36Z,"Thanks shuaz... You people are spoiled, I still don't see a 64k CF going around so I'm reconverting another up - but it's going to be awhile. I would have just done my normal up a little later today but I forgot my fucking llaptop. 

No lie, it'll probably take over an hour to recode on  this slim system I'm on now and probably another hour to up to the remote box. Enjoy shauz's up and hopefully maybe I'll have something up in awhile. If not, 7ish tonight . "
,Ted_Sheckler,2009-08-04T20:59Z,MG don't listen to john2340 he's a fool. We appreciate you taking the time to put shows up daily. Many thanks as always.
[V],mothergoose56,2009-08-04T21:43Z,"Jesus. i was encoding for 2 hours and the file was 2mb. Not sure what the fuck happened. I will start the 128k encode now for a later up and see what i can do about a 64. Grab shauz's for now, sorry folks. 

I won't forget the laptop tomorrow. "

[V],mothergoose56,2009-08-05T00:17Z,"Alrighty, the normal stereo 64k encode should be up in 35 minutes or so, followed by the vbr 128k about 10/15 minutes later. Thanks again to shuazien for hooking everyone up."
