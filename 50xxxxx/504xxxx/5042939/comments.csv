[T],gamerguuy,2009-08-05T14:32Z,well it depends on the chip.Some chips can play both of the regions while others cannot so you should ask  from the guy who chipped your ps2 or the sopkeeper.If you still cannot find then try downloading an NTSC game .

G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra UMD Includes & Requires PSP Firmware 5.55
greg | August 5, 2009

Perhaps this update will never see the light of day, whether that be from Sony?s website or via Network Update; however, G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra UMD comes pressed with firmware 5.55, much like IdolM@ster SP and 5.05. Currently, as confirmed in the below video, 5.55 is required to run G.I. Joe. But really, we all know that?ll be hacked/bypassed in due time."
,patkoltato,2009-08-06T21:06Z,"i think most of u has CFW Folder blocker or other problems, maybe bad drive choose in vsh menu, because pirates never upload not working games, and there is another uploaded version which is tested with 5.00m33. So try other ways to make it work, but its not worth it with gamespot 5 point review, games must suck hard time!"
,omega59,2009-08-07T18:26Z,"yes this game will not run on my psp, 5.50gen-b"
,patkoltato,2009-08-07T23:44Z,"ok i see your point,... sorry for taking your time, oh and i wrote a comment on the other torrent. I try it out too, if it doesn't work... i won't cry... cuz movie based games sucks most of the time. Only problem... Tales Of Vs will use 5.55 too :("

,NoGrp,2009-08-09T08:03Z,"Doesn't work yet because there is no firmware to support it. There have been reports of someone working on 5.55

Here's the thread on PSPISO

,blue_1294,2009-08-09T08:29Z,can any1 gimme a link to modify my psp so that games start workin again
,patkoltato,2009-08-09T21:02Z,Dark-alex's partners said he has no intention in making another cfw... but he worked together with the gen team to create 5.50 gen... so maybe we will have an 5.55 Gen? :D
,patkoltato,2009-08-10T11:48Z,"I love final fantasy games, but i couldn't finish any of them :( I gave up crisis core after 14 hours... i hope dissidia will make it trough until the end, and i think it will because they redone the game and the main story and gameplay takes only 10 hours to complete ^^

Final Fantasy XIII Agito... i will try it out... but i don't think i will get to the end of it :(

Back in my early years i've played out rpg most of the time. But now, msn and other stuff always comes first :(

OK i end my story here :D Also, be happy because the Medal Of Honor Exploit works on the 5.55 so its just a matter of time when the new cfw comes out ;)"
,erlend,2009-08-13T14:11Z,"@patkoltato
Seriously man, 14 hours? you cant give up before you`ve started!! Give it another try. I have all Final Fantasy games, except the online PS2 (XI), only finished four of them though.. VII, X, X-2 and XII. Played these games an average of 350hours each. Awesome when you advance to the really high levels."
,Razgrizsqdn,2009-08-23T06:48Z,"Same for my PSP-1000, I use 5.50(GEN-B) for my CFW on it, And it doesn't run it either. I've download several copies of this game but still nothing works."
