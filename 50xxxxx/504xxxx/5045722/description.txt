To celebrate the release of their ....20th? (not sure..go check Wikipedia ) Girls Aloud released a mix of their hits to the style of 80's group Stars On 45.

I was a big fan of Stars On 45, and am a big fan of Girls Aloud, so this was way cool to me!

I found a SECOND mix...don't know if it's legit, or fan made, but it's there!

Anyway, I took the two, made a cover (LOVE THE COVER!!!) albuminized them, tagged them, and now I'm sharing them. Enjoy them and share them
