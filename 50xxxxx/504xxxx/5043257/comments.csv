,zackismet,2009-08-08T13:57Z,"Something is not kosher with this upload...

i know he's VIP and all, but when i started to dl it there was an immediate boost to 500+ kb/s for about 10 seconds then EVERYTHING died- all my other downloads AND uploads. No, it wasn't my connection. soon as i removed the torrent i swept my comp and it all started up again

odd part was i couldn't find anything malicious, so either the most improbable coincidence or something's up... anyone else able to comment on this?"

Don't forget to use PeerGuardian 2."
,FPyro,2010-12-12T11:46Z,"I agree. What the hell, very strange indeed. Nothing works, upload/download is very slow and utorrent hangs."
,ofpirate,2011-01-19T05:46Z,peerblock + a BOGON list should rrsolv problems described above
