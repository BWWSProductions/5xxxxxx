hey friends,

to register coda you only need the .plist-file as zipped (you get it with these torrent; its small, only 7KB)

put it into following path:

users / library / prefences /

use Little Snitch or OSX-Firewall to block home-calling -

the plist (remove the old file first) should work with Coda 1.63 and 1.64


best regards
