(possibly from something in the code for certain pages here at TPB, I had problems with the way my browser was acting after a page here hit me with a ton of pop up error messages) I thought things were cool because there were 3 seeders besides me... but now I see that everyone has done what I asked them not to do.

I use this computer for more than just this... and I don't like having to seed way beyond a 10.0 share ratio because of d-bags doing a hit and run.

I'll seed this file for another 5.0 of share ratio - and if people are still only leeching, then I'm gonna remove the file from my Vuze library.


So... if you guys want to get a full copy, make sure you keep seeding when done, cause I'm not hanging around for this file if I'm the only seeder."

,eagertestical,2010-11-08T04:43Z,also you should research bittorrent
,ZenRhino,2012-02-10T22:57Z,"@eagertestical  - that's funny you giving me shit & saying I'm worse that some who hits & runs... I see you have ZERO torrents to your name on here. That means all you do is take & not give back - so until you upload something, you can shut the f#$k up, ok? I explained why I was dipping out, if you can't accept that then don't check out my $#it."
