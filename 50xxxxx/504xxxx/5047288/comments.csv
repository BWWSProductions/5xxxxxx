Upload? 
First, stop jerkin' off.
Second, learn to read - instead of jerking off.
Third, read TPB instructions (by not jerking off)
Fourth, leave the pocket rocket alone and do something socially redeeming - instead of jerking off

But first and foremost you gotta stop being a jerk off.

Once you have your file or directory prepared use a client (like uTorrent) to Create a torrent file. In uTorrent this is in the File menu. This will require adding in torrent ""trackers"" or ""scrapers"" during creation process like:
http://open.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce

(some homework and trial-and-error may be required)

Usually the .torrent file itself (containing contents info and bit level hash or 'fingerprint') is stored in the contents' parent directory.

Once created log into a site like the illustrious TPB and select Upload (TPB: Upload will be a URL link at bottom of all pages). During upload you will navigate/select your torrent file and fill in the rest of the appropriate information fields.

If you make a mistake you can delete your uploads.

If there are any other questions or assistance I can provide please let me know. Give a shout once you have something up'd. I hope it has lots of t&a   Goodluck!!
