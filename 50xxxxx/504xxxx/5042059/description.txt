Info about he game(Gamezone):
Rank:9  2005
Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 is a WWII shooter that gives you a sense of the HBO series Band of Brothers. Actually if there are any fans out there, the first part of the game gives you the feeling that this title should have indeed been called Band of Brothers. I would imagine that HBO was not going to give the nod to let the publishers use their title so BIA is a good substitue. You are SGT Matt Baker of the 502 Airborn, a young soft-spoken man from the "show me" state who volunteered as a paratrooper, but never expected to lead a squad.
