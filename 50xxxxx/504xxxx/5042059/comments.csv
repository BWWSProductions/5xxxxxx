,FF_hightopper,2009-08-07T18:47Z,Sorry but my disc failed. Try again later.
,obeyXme,2009-08-08T14:54Z,"Allright sorry i take that back, I had it installed, but it took its time.

But anyways I tried to launch it after extracting it to a Temp file of course but it won't start. It ""does not answer"". When i copy the ""bia"" file from the crack folder to the Temp file(which is 1.0) i tried to launch it.. again. I get an error that ""core.dll couldn't be found"" 

Am I doing anything wrong? I use Vista, maybe that's the problem or something?"
