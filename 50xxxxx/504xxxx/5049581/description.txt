Something has been unearthed in Gotham City, something that should not have been disturbed. An ancient pyramid has unleashed supernatural energies throughout the world. Drawn to the eye of this arcane storm, the heroes of the JLA become caught in the grip of a force far beyond their extraordinary powers. Only Gothamâ€™s protector, Batman, manages to escapeâ€”but to free his allies and stop the chaos that is fast engulfing the world, the Dark Knight must somehow unlock the pyramidâ€™s secret curse.
