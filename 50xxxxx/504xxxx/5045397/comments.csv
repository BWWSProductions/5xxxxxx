according the sales. I have had to up my hours working from 50 to 65 hours per week. It's OK though I have used the tax code to where I don't pay anymore taxes. I laugh at those who think we are going to any more taxes.

NTP - Keep on hanging in...Work the system like its made to be worked.

I look for extreme civil unrest as a reaction to the domestic spying being implemented by the 0bama regime. 
Already the 'Town Hall' meeting are being filled with dis-heartened citizens telling their reps how disgusted they are by what is happening.

And the Demo machine response? Astroturfing and lies. Axelrod & Rahm are true devotees of Goebbels and the KGB."

,gaijin01,2009-08-07T06:08Z,"Trickdaddy, you said rush was lying when he says most people oppose obamas health care plan, however it's not his saying, all the offical polls say the same thing.
http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/healthcare/july_2009/53_now_oppose_congressional_health_care_reform

53% of americans oppose it, that qualifies as ""most"". You can say it's crap or that you hate conservatives, or that you think Americans are dumb or whatever, but don't say it's a lie.

Most people DO support health care reform...most people do NOT support Obamas plan..."

,trickdaddy0024,2009-08-07T13:44Z,"Ah ha not so fast gaijin01, Rasmussen is a right leaning polling website...This was taken directly from wikipedia's websiteDemocratic Party activists have pointed out that Scott Rasmussen was a paid consultant for the 2004 George W. Bush campaign. [9]. Rasmussen presidential polling numbers tend to be an outlier among samples taken from other polling organizations. [10] Others have pointed out that the reason Rasmussen's polls trend more Republican than other mainstream polls is simply that he samples likely voters. [11] John Marshal of Talking Points Memo has said, ""The toplines tend to be a bit toward the Republican side of the spectrum, compared to the average of other polls. But if you factor that in they're pretty reliable. And the frequency that Rasmussen is able to turn them around -- because they're based on robocalls -- gives them added value in terms of teasing out trends."" [12]. Networks such as MSNBC simply do not use Rasmussen polls."". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmussen_Reports...On the other hand Gallup poll says that seniors which I've already said tend to be republicans are most skeptical of Healthcare Reform. http://www.gallup.com/poll/121982/Seniors-Skeptical-Healthcare-Reform.aspx ...Rasmussen could be right but they are polling old people with these robocall...END"

,gaijin01,2009-08-07T16:50Z,"Are you seriously refuting a Rasmussen poll with Wikipedia??? Give me 15 minutes and I will change wikipedia for you...

There is a gallup poll that says almost the same thing. Wikipedia is written by random people... At least Rasmussen actually calls people and gathers scientific data. I agree they are right-leaning people, so what every channel on TV is left-leaning, but data is data. I am willing to give points where you earn em, I can accept you claiming the data is skewed or wrong or Rasmussen made it up, none of which I believe. But you digress, the point is that you say Rush lied... Since there is data to support him he did not, Rasmussen's data is another point, and since I cant argue the opinon of that one writer on wikipedia what can I say, its a ""he said she said"" thing."
,booboo332,2009-08-07T22:16Z,"Also, no college prof worth his salt will accept wikipedia as a source on a paper.  it's great for info on some topics but political science is not one of them.

And speaking of MSNBC, they are owned by GE.  GE used to manufacture landmines and now that they make windmills, the hippies now embrace them.  Has any corp sucked up to the current admin more than GE?"
,booboo332,2009-08-07T22:17Z,"TD - ""I know enough about the bill in that it should and will pass...I do not believe or take orders from an oxcy moron""  

With his lengthy, unreadible screeds, who would have thought TD is one of the TLDR crowd?

Take's a lot of faith for that kind of lockstep conformity and considering your declaration of love and respect for a known drug addict (Michael ""I'm still dead"" Jackson), your ad hominem attacks are just amusing hypocrisy.  "
,trickdaddy0024,2009-08-08T01:36Z,"Ok...gaijin01 you said,""Are you seriously refuting a Rasmussen poll with Wikipedia???"". Yes...Wikipedia and Gallup Poll...Gallup shows that 36% of people 65 and older think that Obama care will reduce their access to healthcare while, only 12% of people aged 18 to 49 think the same thing...The Rasmussen poll does not specify any age group. Young people mostly use cell phone so, how is Rasmussen polling them?...This is why the same Gallup poll I showed earlier is more accurate... http://www.gallup.com/poll/121982/Seniors-Skeptical-Healthcare-Reform.aspx 
 ""I am willing to give points where you earn em, I can accept you claiming the data is skewed or wrong or Rasmussen made it up, none of which I believe. But you digress, the point is that you say Rush lied"", u said...How can u give me points if I say Rasmussen is made it up? Look gaijin01, where I come from we deal with facts...The Rasmussen Poll is accurate until you claim that the All Americans are opposed the Health Care Reform...When in fact the Gallup Polls show it is Older Americans...Mr. Limbaugh knows this but he tell his listeners his point of view in order motivate them to continue disrupting town hall meetings...Also I never said Mr. Limbaugh ""lied"" he just is misrepresenting the truth..."

,gaijin01,2009-08-08T03:20Z,"again, you are debating the polls, but thats not my point.

You said Rush lied, but going by your logic, rush is acting on bad information not lying. Most libs have a way of changing the subject when they lose an argument, just as you are doing.

You owe Rush Limbaugh an apology for saying he lied about it...

,trickdaddy0024,2009-08-08T05:49Z,"gaijin01, I already answered your questions but this doesn't seem good enough 4 u...I DONT apology just because u say I should...At point I agree to disagree...END "
