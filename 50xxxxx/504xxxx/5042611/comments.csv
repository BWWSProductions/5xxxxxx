,grinboy,2009-08-10T19:42Z,"Game crashes at the first FMV, used all pops..

[T],swebarb,2009-08-14T17:05Z,toxics rips are fucking suxxx.. hes a stupid wannabe..
,dOOmBot,2009-08-19T01:42Z,"A ""wannabe""? Maybe you are right... after all, uploaders who post torrents for ungratefull freeloading saps like us is an envious practice that brings fame, glory and mostly money."
,dOOmBot,2009-08-19T01:53Z,"It seems that you upload torrents too swebarb, sorry about my hasty message, it is just that I like to appreciate the effort of others."
,TheModGod,2009-10-08T22:57Z,"I have to agree with swebarb and grinboy.

CFW 5.00 M33-6 With popsloader for that firmware revision does NOT work on any pops.

However lets not call this guy a hack just yet, his Resident evil Directors cut with dual shock works. I even had it working with the built in loader in 5.00 M33-6.

I will update my comments on here as soon as I get Resident evil 3 working."
,DaftThatPunk,2009-12-15T06:28Z,"Are any pops working ?

,eParadigm,2010-01-07T23:01Z,I dloaded RE2 dual shock version from this uploader(chck comments on the torrent page)..that worked perfectly..will comment on this one after dloading it...
,eParadigm,2010-01-08T15:13Z,"I have got it working perfectly....after a lot of work

have played upto second save point/location in game no problems so far.....

Used CFW 5.50 GEN-B with popsloader plugins installed...and enabled from recovery menu.
