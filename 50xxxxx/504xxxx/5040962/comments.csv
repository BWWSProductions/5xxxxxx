,i-dennis,2009-08-04T11:17Z,I Upload with 1 Mb/s but i download with 70 kb/s ..... stupid seed speed
,i-dennis,2009-08-04T11:51Z,When i finished this torrent the retail version is allready in stores xD
,Timyoni,2009-08-04T14:33Z,I'm seeding at @700Kb/s but when you have 96 clients downloading from you there is not much you can do about that. The torrent was uploaded only few hours ago. Wondering if you understand what P2P sharing is...
,balahir,2009-08-04T22:10Z,"Thanks Timyoni for a great upload. Don't pay attention to the people complaing about download speeds, they are probably just spoiled kids..."
,pomares,2009-08-05T00:11Z,"Not to be a party pooper, but you don't need to download this version if you already have any other version of SNow Leopard. Seed updates come automatically through Software Update.

There are more seeders (including me :-) ) for earlier versions."
,icazaa,2009-08-05T00:20Z,Thx for sharing! :)
,BradMacPro,2009-08-05T16:40Z,"If this is too big to burn to a dual layer DVD, then the final either fits on two discs or will be released on a 16 GB USB flash drive."
,midgetbro09,2009-08-05T17:34Z,"umm no, dual layer is 8GB....
snow leopard is 6GB
and we already know its going to be on a dvd, so you sound like a retard right now"
,virgilaug,2009-08-05T19:29Z,Final release will be on a dual layer dvd. If you dont have dual layer dvd R/RW then you can put this or any other OS X release on an ipod and instal from there. Worked for me with 10.5.
,virgilaug,2009-08-05T19:30Z,"Regarding snow leopard and this release: Will it expire after some time, or can i use it as long as I want."
,oldgeezer,2009-08-05T22:23Z,"Like the man said...this is a HD image. It is not an installer image. If you try to burn this to a DL disk, you will be told there is not enough space...you need 14+ GB. However, It can be copied to a HD and will boot...a user has already been set."
,ssn637,2009-08-05T22:45Z,Can someone please give instructions on how to extract the Boot Camp drivers from this image?  I have instructions on how to do this from an installation image but not a hard drive image.  Thanks for your help!
,icazaa,2009-08-06T17:02Z,How do I install?? Plz help..
,icazaa,2009-08-06T17:11Z,Sry for asking. I get it now :) Think I'll just wait for the final release.
,al4zal,2009-08-09T03:53Z,"Hello guys,
for some reason my installation always gets stuck when it is only 3 minutes remaining. It freezes on me. I have tried both burning into a DL disk and boot from an external drive. Please if someone can help me it will greatly appreciated. Its macbook pro 1.83gz . Thank u. "
,andy72184,2009-08-12T09:16Z,"10A432 is GM  not this torrent, lets get 10A432 now."
,jb510,2009-08-13T18:02Z,"I'm a fool for not reading the description...  but please everyone be aware this is NOT AN INSTALL DISK IMAGE.  This is an image of 10.6 already INSTALLED.  

To install SL properly you need to download the 10a380 image.   10a380 can then be updated several times through software update to get to current (10a432).  

Hopefully someone soon will post an image of installer for 10a432.  As I frequently need to reinstall and updating 3-4 times to get to current after each re-install is annoying."
,L3ntil,2009-08-14T05:46Z,"Snow Leopard 10a432 is on Demenoid, be cool if someone would download it and post it here"
,jjh4ck3rs,2009-08-15T06:29Z,"hey okay so this is how you get this installed on your mac , because this has no installation files, i tested and it worked and im on it now typing this comment.

use disk utility , and erase and restore the dmg file to a ipod or to a usb or firewire drive .

then copy the full dmg image file to the usb drive also

then boot into snow leopard from the usb drive.

then go into disk utility and partition or erase your primary mac hard drive , and put one partition on it , and restore to that drive using the dmg image file that is on the usb drive.

worked for me so thought i would share with u guys (:
