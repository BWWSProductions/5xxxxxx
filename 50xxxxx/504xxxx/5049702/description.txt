Strolling casually through the desert, Munsuâ€”a government agent once beholden to a fallen empireâ€”succumbs to the inevitable and collapses from dehydration. He is rescued by Monlyon, a young man on a camel who is traveling back home after having failed to acquire the skills necessary to save his sweetheart from the clutches of a despotic local lord. The boy's passive naivetÃ© rubs the cynical older man the wrong way, but Munsu nevertheless parts company having acquired a cute little bat-mascot and a mission. Later, having lain to rest his young acquaintance's wishes, Munsu takes his newly acquired mascot and Sando, an even more recently acquired sidekick, and allows himself to be persuaded by a young amnesiac named Jyun into visiting an island occupied by a suspicious doctor. Something ominous is afoot on the island, and Munsu, despite his protestations that he's not in the business of helping people, is compelled to uncover the truthâ€”no matter the blood spilled to reach it.
