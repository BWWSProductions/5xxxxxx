Like I said, It's my first torrent upload, so I'm like a mother hen wondering if it went right."
,scottyscum,2009-08-06T08:52Z,"Your baby looks good. As we all know, a lot of pdf's are hard to read, so yeah. I'm in a somewhat similar situation, so I sure as hell can't help. If it weren't for the internet, the ONLY thing I'd be able to ""afford"" is over the air tv. Sucks to admit, but I never even rent dvd's for a buck, I'm that poor. My internet connection is wireless (that I don't pay for). I haven't bought a cd for several years (and I used to buy lots of albums and cds). My local library is my dvd rental store, except they don't cost even that measly buck those machines do. I'm just very fortunate in that my citys library kicks ass, never seen one like it before. So, hope things work out for you, know where your coming from."
,lsoearth,2009-08-06T09:06Z,"Thx for the feedback. It took a couple hours to do the work, but I'm pleased with the results. 

re: the rest.
I hear you. Take care."
,Wmbtcar88,2009-08-09T12:23Z,"looks great, thanks for the upload!"
,monty_m94,2009-08-16T17:14Z,Thanks
,Chjris,2009-12-20T01:28Z,"The first page needs redoing. All the D's have been replaced with A's.

""We were somewhere arouna Barstow on the eage of the aesert when the arugs began to take hola.""

But the rest looks ok, so it's not really a problem once you get into it."
,rekpek99,2010-10-19T23:57Z,"thanks a lot! everything seems fine to me except for the first page,as mentioned above, but thats not really a problem. thanks again for all the work, keep it coming!"
,kabico,2011-01-31T23:02Z,Excellent! Thanks.
,AxlVanHorn,2011-07-06T19:28Z,"That's not complete for fuck's sake! Only 90 pages! Do not even bother, the jerk had a last page saying shit about how he has no food donations and shit. It's the last page (the uploader put) that makes you think the book is complete.

DO NOT EVEN BOTHER!!! this is 1/3 of the actual book!!!

Scum Bug!!!"
,musicguy99,2011-07-30T17:19Z,Ignore AxlVanHorn: This is the full book. The reason it's only 93 pages long is because it's formatted for (roughly) 8.5x11-inch paper/page size.
,lsoearth,2011-08-15T09:40Z,"Thx to all those that have kept seeding. To any new downloaders, please feel free to ignore the last page...life has changed, and improved, much since then."
,bu1,2011-08-16T15:04Z,"I do not recommend this torrent, the text is missing some words (some sentences do not make sense, seem incomplete) and in the end author has included personal message. I downloaded it only because I couldn't get the original book in English, but I found one in my native language, so I think I am better off reading it. 

p.s. I don't intend to be mean to the uploader in any way, I am very sorry for your situation. "
,Amund321,2011-11-02T19:53Z,Tnx! Love the book. You did a good job (mostly).
