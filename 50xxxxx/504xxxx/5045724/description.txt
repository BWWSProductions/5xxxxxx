Vanity was an early "protoge" of Prince. He formed a..."band", Vanity 6, as a showcase for her. Vanity would leave for a solo career, cocaine, and Jesus.

Prince replaced her with Apollonia, and the "band" became Apollonia 6, and released the single "Sex Shooter".

Well before then, Vanity 6 was going to do the song, and a demo version got released.

I found it somewhere, turned it into a MP3, and here it is for you.
