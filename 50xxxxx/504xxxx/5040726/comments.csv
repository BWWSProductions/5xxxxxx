also your using terms like ""Hard Subs"", so you could write a title for a torrent, but then you would have to put ""shit"" in it lol"

,skvii,2009-08-04T12:47Z,so i take it to be....dont download this???
,lapis2,2009-08-04T15:39Z,i just looked at 1 of the vobs...this is just the cam thats been going around turned into a dvd.  which should rly be obvious to any1 by the file size.
,lapis2,2009-08-04T15:46Z,to elaborate dont download unless u want a cam turned into a dvd.  video 5/ sound 4.  this is only worth watching if ud just like to see it again rly bad.  otherwise dont bother.  for those who havent seen the cam it has also been horribly cropped to fix shakiness and such.
,lapis2,2009-08-04T15:57Z,sry i gotta say 1 more thing...WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE SO STUPID AS TO THINK THIS WAS A SCREENER OR A R5...have u never seen a retail dvd?  i mean rly ive never seen a retail disk with video quality this bad lol.
