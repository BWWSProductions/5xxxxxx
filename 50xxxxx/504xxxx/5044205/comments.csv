Thanks for these!"
[T],netviper,2009-08-06T08:30Z,"it would be faster but I am seeding these shows at demonoid too. 

LOL my connection just got upgraded today from 20/5 to 25/15 though it seems that it's actually more like 26/21mbit as speedtest has told me

,ZERO_BS,2009-08-06T09:12Z,"Good stuff! I have 15/1 but get about 17/1

Great for downloading, but unfortunately I can't seed as well as I'd like to. 

My ISP is getting FIOS up and running though, so maybe that will change in the future..."
[T],ct420,2009-08-06T09:43Z,fuck you and your fascist bullshit!
[T],netviper,2009-08-06T10:26Z,"ct420 - fuck you too and your true fascist ilk (you know nationalizing big parts of the economy, banks cars, trying to do healthcare)

stoppiratingbeckno - umm his tv show is broadcast on a publicly available cable channel. This is the modern day equivalent of making a vhs tape of the show and passing it out to your friends. I somehow think that Glenn would be happier that his show is getting to be seen by those that don't have access to it or miss it for any number of reasons. I myself can't justify paying $50 a month for cable tv service to watch one channel. if I could buy FNC and maybe SciFi ala carte from the cable company I'd do so, but alas I can't. Plus I work nights so I'd miss his show cause I am sleeping.

if I were a liberal socialist you honestly think I'd be going out of my way to find his show and post it to the different torrent sites? I don't even cap these myself, I found a source that has been doing them and I just make some torrents and share."
[T],netviper,2009-08-06T11:06Z,"alt.binaries.tv is my source good luck trying to find the guy that is posting them and shut him down.

as for being a hippie liberal - sorry you're quite wrong on that one. I shower daily so that disqualifies me as a hippie. Oh yeah and I can't stand smoking weed.

So I guess your on a first name basis with Glenn eh? Tell him I said hi when you go whining to him about someone that is helping to spread his show around to those that don't have FNC. WTF are you doing at the piratebay if you are so concerned that something like this is stealing?

I fail to understand the logic of  how you determine that I am some liberal democrat agent that is running scared? I post these solely because I want MORE people to see his show. Much like I seed the Limbaugh podcasts for weeks so that anyone that wants them can get them. "
[T],netviper,2009-08-06T11:58Z,"nope I think obummer's clunkers program is crap plus I love my black smoke spewing pre-egr diesel F250. you really are retarded if you think I'd post my name or any of my info on here, not out of fear, but out of common sense. Lets see post my name so you can feel self righteous in sending it into glenn's email. meanwhile some obamaton sends my info on the gestopo flag@whitehouse.gov site and then the fed gov't puts me on a list somewhere. I'm sure that lists like that exist and frankly my name doesn't need to be on them. 

if you are so concerned about the loss of ad revnue that is paid to FNC that in turn pays for Glenn's show, I have purchased both Common Sense (glenn's recent version) and An Inconvenient Book.

Anyhow I don't know why I am wasting my time other than it's fun to see you all irate about this. I can't wait till tonight when I post 08/06/09 episode and then again friday night when I post the next ep.

,ZERO_BS,2009-08-06T13:06Z,LOL...
,ZERO_BS,2009-08-06T13:17Z,I can't comment... WTF is wrong with TPB?
,ZERO_BS,2009-08-06T13:21Z,"Lol, even Glenn himself posts links to videos of his show... there are no licensing issues, dumbass!"
,HelloDolly1,2009-08-06T21:34Z,Glenn Beck sucks ass!
