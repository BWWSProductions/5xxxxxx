[T],netviper,2009-08-06T10:06Z,"Obama will fail simply because his policys are directly opposed to what the American people want. 

Obama sold voters a bill of goods and many many of those voters are having a serious case of buyers remorse. the 2010 elections cant get here fast enough! Time for a repeat of the 94 congressional sweep!!!!! "
