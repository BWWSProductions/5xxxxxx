Monty Python's Life of Brian, also known as The Life of Brian, is a 1979 comedy film written, directed and largely performed by the Monty Python comedy team. It tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Graham Chapman), a young Jewish man born in the same era and location as Jesus Christ, who is mistaken for the Messiah.

The film's combination of comedy and religious themes was controversial, particularly on its initial release. However, it has regularly been cited as possibly the greatest comedy film of all time: in 2000, readers of the British Total Film magazine voted it as such; in 2004, the same magazine named it the fifth greatest British film of all time; in 2006 it was again voted the best comedy movie of all time on a poll conducted by the UK's Channel 4 network.

In a world of religious bigots this is like a breath of fresh air!
