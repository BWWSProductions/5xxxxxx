Desktop Earth is a wallpaper program that will appeal to users who are curious about what Earth looks like from space. By updating constantly and operating on a simple premise, this is a fun and interesting way to spice up your desktop.

This free program embeds its icon in your desktop tray and provides a basic set of options to alter the wallpaper. The wallpaper itself is an enormous photograph of Earth from space and takes up all of your desktop space with no area uncovered. The continents appear clearly and most views provide a glimpse of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and slightly less than half of the entire globe from east to west. Desktop Earth impresses not only on its clear view, but the options users can tinker with. Users can cycle through all the time zones in the world to zero in on the corner they want to view from space. There is also a drop-down menu allowing for the picture to be updated every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and hour. In addition, a slider allows for cloud cover to be erased for a clearer picture of land and sea. Finally, users can adjust the daytime image to get a better topographical view and the nighttime image to show natural moonlight, city lights, and more.

Desktop Earth is a simple tool that gives desktops a lot of character. Thanks to its clean picture and intriguing options, we highly recommend this download.
