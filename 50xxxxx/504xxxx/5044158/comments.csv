Please, keep seeding!!"
,Raukan,2009-08-06T09:51Z,Looks awesome! Thanks man!
,lsoearth,2009-08-06T10:15Z,"Thx, and you're welcome. It took nearly four hours to compile from the .lit file. I wish all .lit files were so well put together.

I didn't take enough time to make the chapter links active, or to place the footnotes, but I'm still happy with the overall results. In the future I may get better with HTML editors and such to go back and rebuild this. 

This is definitely the best version I've seen up, so please keep seeding."
,nadtz,2009-08-08T02:26Z,"any chance of getting the .lit file?  Id rather use MS reader or ybook for reading than any PDF reader, unless there is some awesome PDF reader that I don't know about."
,lsoearth,2009-08-08T12:12Z,"Let me see if I still have it archived. 

I don't keep .lit files long as I am a linux user and don't use ms reader. I just crack the lit open and build a different format. 

*found it*

Give me a few minutes to put together the upload."

^ here's a link to the .lit version

take care, enjoy and most of all keep seeding!"
,joeboemonkey,2009-11-20T06:46Z,"Thank you for this! I actually checked my local library for this book, and could not find it. Strangely, I feel worse about downloading books than I do movies and music, but I feel as if this one will be worth it.
Thanks again!"
,OriginalCindy,2009-12-23T06:53Z,"thanks! 
fast download 
will seed as i was told this was a really great book."
,snowman61093,2010-02-03T04:37Z,"I clicked the download link, read the comments, and it was done.  Great upload thank you so much."
,lancerino,2010-03-02T22:34Z,"Was this translated or  just scanned with a cheap scanner? The quality is fantastic,but it just has too many errors. Its unreadable! If you are OK with some typos every 5-6 sentances then your fine. IF not. Dont download this torrent"
,Hyrrokkin,2010-04-30T02:37Z,"It is awesome you uploaded this as I've been wanting to read it for some time, and the download time was fantastic! I think it took all of 90 seconds. HOWEVER, I have to agree with Lancerino about the spelling. There's an error in about every other sentence. I just don't know as I have the patience to deal with that through 242 pages no matter the level of zombie-deliciousness. Please upload a revised version if ever you get the opportunity. Good luck with your financial problems. Have a nice day"
,upMONSTERdown,2011-07-17T16:32Z,I have this in an .epub format if anyone would prefer that. You can add it to your nook or what ever device you are using. You can download nook reader software from barnes and nobles for free that reads the format too. It is much more organized. if anyone wants it i'll post it to a file share rather than torrent as my computer is not always on.
,lsoearth,2011-08-15T09:38Z,"Thx to all those that have kept seeding. To any new downloaders, please feel free to ignore the text file in this torrent...life has changed, and improved, much since then.

*In regards to any comments on typos, etc. This was built from the publishers retail .lit and I apologize if I overlooked any serious mistakes in the text. If you don't like things for free, then go pay for them."
,hagamablabla,2012-06-11T02:04Z,"Serious mistakes seems to be an understatement. I think you should recheck how you converted it. 
If it's any help, the problem seems to only appear on some pages, and it looks like it involves one letter being converted into another letter (ie all ""b"" on the page being turned into ""k"")"
,hagamablabla,2012-06-11T04:22Z,"Also, it seems to only happen on the first story of every chapter."
