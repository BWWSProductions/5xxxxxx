,takepills,2009-09-22T21:51Z,"Hey  ""sistromo"", if you have better books, please make a torrent and upload them. I clicked on your name and noticed you're not sharing anything, just taking. It's a two way street dude. You have to give to receive."
,kilomonk,2009-10-12T19:49Z,"Bansky, Casteneda, Steiner - there's no way ""sistromo"" even read the file list. Yes, some flaky, newage - rhymes with sewage ;-) stuff, but a nice mix of well, precisely what the torrent title says.  Thanks for sharing this, and for the individual files. Take only what you need.
What the hell, I'll d/l the whole thing. Maybe there is some truth to that ""hollow earth"" theory..."
