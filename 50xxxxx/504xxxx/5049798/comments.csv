Not complaining or anything, just found it funny hehe.

Thanks for the upload! :)"
,IS-118,2009-08-12T03:48Z,"@ursak,

I'm not using Kaspersky. Currently, I have This version on my PC. BTW.. It is very necessary to scan your uploads with Most Powerful antiviruses.. So, It is to be done.

I've scanned this one with Kaspersky & Norton. Login Viewer has been checked through Sandboxie.. It is a bit hard work man.. Nothings funny here!"
[T],ace_102,2009-08-12T03:53Z,My view is that there hasn't been any uploads from trusted uploaders since Aug. 9....only VIP/Helpers.

If you have internet connection, then you can try ESET login viewer which is included in the torrent.

If not, then you'll have to switch over it.. otherwise, You'll have to PM Me here at suprbay.. I'll send one to you..

Hello Pirates,
The Login viewer included in this torrent is not working from a few days. Problem is same all over.

Will try to fix another solution for this.
But, Till that, Please try another torrent, if you want to, otherwise, Patience would be fine!

Sorry for this.

Thank you all!

,kanonski,2009-12-11T20:14Z,"IS-118: Something is wrong with login viewer. I tried to use the latest v. from Robin: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5112731
and it worked. Dunno if your version works for others. It didn't for me :( anyway, you may want to upload the latest v. of login viewer.

Thanks for your work!"
