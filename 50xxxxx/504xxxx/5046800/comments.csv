Now, if MTV only could get off their ass and put this on DVD ;)"
,Vahokif,2009-08-09T22:13Z,At least now you can do it yourself ;)
,nickakalilbj,2009-08-19T14:59Z,U fuckin rock dude
,enigs,2009-10-09T21:02Z,"For anyone that's curious, this has everything that was cut from the VHS, and in much better quality, as Vahokif said.

So, in essence, this is the ultimate Maxx torrent. :)"
,scott_ehm,2009-10-25T21:13Z,"Yay :) Thank you!

*masturbates furiously*"
,tofusoldier,2009-11-16T12:31Z,"I really do appreciate what you've done here (and am pleased to see that there are still enough other Maxx fans out there to keep this torrent healthy), but I have to ask.. why H264?

Perhaps you used it simply because that's what they had on their site..?

Otherwise, I prefer H263 or high-bitrate divX.

Anyway, thanks for all the time and energy providing something MTV fails to."

,cycomico,2010-01-12T02:04Z,"WOW! The quality is AWESOME!
Thanks! You sir are my hero!
I'll seed these as long as possible! :-D"
,Ioz-of-Mer,2010-03-03T23:12Z,"Thanks a lot, Vahokif! From what I've read on Amazon.com, the quality of these files rivals the ""official"" DVD on demand version. Needless to say, there has been, and will be, plenty of seeding for all to enjoy. 

However, I have to share a few minor problems to any would-be downloaders. First, there is a minor skipping issue with the audio. It's so brief (I'd guess a millisecond) that I barely noticed it at first, but after it persisted from one episode after another, I could no longer ignore it. This doesn't happen often, maybe about once or twice per episode, but it seems to happen in nearly every episode. 

Second, after the end of episode 11, which is about 18 minutes into the 20min 19sec total running time of the file, it replays an earlier segment from the episode for the remaining 3 minutes. So if anyone has the means, I suggest cutting out the last 3 minutes or so of from this episode with a video editing application. 

Also, the first 9 minutes or so of episode 11 is a recap. This isn't an ""issue"" at all, just something I think fans should be aware of. The recap exists because the show went on hiatus during its original broadcast run on MTV before this episode aired, so they wanted to make sure audiences were caught up on what was going on. New content isn't seen until about 9 minutes into the episode. 

Other than those two problems, watching this series has been a beautiful experience, certainly better than the official VHS version, which cut a lot from the show, including one whole episode."

Absolutely flawless rip!"
,FcuKUweBoll,2010-04-26T07:09Z,god damn i miss the 90's! when MTV was full of dysfunctional cartoons and not braindead reality tv shows like the real life and pregnant at 16. MTV is now a disease and it needs to be wiped out
,DoctorX101,2010-05-14T19:05Z,Awesome!  One of my favorite episodes and a remarkable series.
,klfshn,2010-09-06T04:34Z,"A sidenote: I haven't ran into the issues Ioz-of-Mer was having. 
Ep 11 ran flawlessly, as did the others.
A tiny bit of interlacing is going on the whole time though, but maybe it's just my player.

Seed it til you bleed it. Then seed some more."
,demongund,2010-11-19T07:41Z,Keep it alive!!!!!!
