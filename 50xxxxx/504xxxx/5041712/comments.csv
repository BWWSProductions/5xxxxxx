I can go up to the search bar and type in Adobe Photoshop CS3 and download the FULL FUCKING VERSION!!! This is just a fucking spam torrent.  You're not going to get downloads uploading a damn trail."

Secondly, there's no point in being rude.

""You're not going to get downloads uploading a damn trail.""
Thirdly, oh, THAT'S why I've uploaded 19GB of this over 20 days; about 3 times/day?! I see."
