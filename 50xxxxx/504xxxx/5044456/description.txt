Founded in 1994 by companies of the automotive aftermarket industry and the German Association for Spare parts (GVA), TecDoc Informations System GmbH has established itself as the leading supplier of electronic spare parts information on the European market.

TecDoc furnishes the free vehicle spare parts market with current and comprehensive data for identifying and ordering parts â€“ for both, PC as well as CV â€“ directly from the databases of the cooperating automotive aftermarket manufacturers in a standardised catalogue form.
