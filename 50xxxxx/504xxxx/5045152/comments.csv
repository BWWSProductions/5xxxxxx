[V],RR-NE,2009-08-06T20:53Z,I'm sure these are going to be some pretty slow downloads since you seem to be seeding 10 torrents at a time..
,edon82,2009-08-06T23:36Z,i dont think its real.
,edon82,2009-08-06T23:39Z,tryin to get a fake pink skull for his fake ass
,SysProfile,2009-08-07T03:56Z,"You should download and check.

edon82, I congratulate you, knows how to use copy and paste!!! you write the same comment on multiple files.  If you do not like this Torrent search TPB surely find something better"
,AVIDM,2009-08-07T13:23Z,"These videos are designed to be viewed on mobile devices eg Blackberry 83xx.
Do not try to see it on HDMI TV because the quality is not for that device. My idea is that you can see the video while you travel.

The site (avidmobile.com.ar) is correct, because I'm from Argentina"
,tvaddict99,2009-08-07T20:36Z,"@ HolyRoses. I thought the idea of TPB was to share, which is exactly what AVIDM is doing. Just coz he's uploading films that you have already done doesn't give you the right to slate his work and just assume its not as good as yours!! You don't rule this site, get a life........."
,AVIDM,2009-08-08T00:22Z,"First, I apologize for my English grammar, not my mother tongue.  In parts of the translation, use Google to do a better translation (surely a mistake:)) 

People should all be ""friends"" and share this site, I respect deeply the work of all. I do not intend to be better than others or get a special rank.

tvaddict99, Thanks for your support"
,AVIDM,2009-08-08T00:32Z,"HolyRoses, On my site I would like to link to your video's. TPB is a public site, but ask before, is the right thing."
,AVIDM,2009-08-08T01:09Z,"HolyRoses, I am not only to iPod 5th. generation. My world of devices is what the market offers. I live in Argentina and although it is possible to buy an iPod, for the common people here mean a lot of money. 1 USD = 3.86 ARS ... :-(. Thus in the previous message asking you to refer to your link's on my site. This way I can ensure that those who have iPod 5th. Generation will see it correctly, if they download the HolyRoses version.

PS: I have a Blackberry Bold :-)"
,AVIDM,2009-08-08T01:18Z,"I think if people stopped to see the details of how to compose the video would be enough. 320x240 resolution is not an iPod 5th. generation. I do not know if you, like happens to me, but when there is much text to read, I do not do it carefully. Write ""NOT FOR IPOD"" in the future would force me to add all the other devices."
,AVIDM,2009-08-08T01:47Z,"My videos are basic and not do for me. Blackberry Bold has a 480x320 screen.

We no longer discuss about formats and devices. Thank you for your recommendations. :p"
