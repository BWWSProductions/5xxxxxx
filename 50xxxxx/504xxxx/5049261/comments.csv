[V],bobo66,2011-02-01T03:16Z,"Thanks. The portable works great (as usual).

As for those complaining about viruses/Trojans, hacks and cracks by their nature will turn up a false positive.  I've been using this guys offerings or quite some time and I've never had a problem. 

If are still concerned use sandboxie or deepfreeze. "
,Farzin67,2011-07-19T05:54Z,"Thanks for upload.
Btw, scanned it with Kaspersky and no malware found, it's clean and functional."
,Ancient Geek,2012-06-28T00:49Z,Warning--my AV blew away this file.  It did *NOT* mind the other torrent that isn't a portable version--it's not the keyfinding ability that it's upset about.
,Ign0tus,2012-07-13T07:58Z,"I don't know about the crack or installer or other files, but the portable file is clean, which is all I wanted. VirusTotal scanned it on 7/12/12 and it was clean on all 42 engines. I rescanned it on Jotti and it had 1 hit on some engine that I'm not familiar with. The rest were clean. Thanks for the upload."
