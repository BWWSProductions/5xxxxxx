Hey my brother just gave me a cd with these plugins (instruments/synthesizers) for FL studio (or other applications but i prefer FL :P) and i thought i'd share it with everyone because the sounds you get with it are amazing ;)

Contains over 50 different amazing plugins!


The map instruments is divided into other maps with each a certain type of plugins.

1. Drums
2. Organ
3. Piano
4. Sampler
5. Specials
6. Synth-others
7. Synth-virtual analog

For installation with FL Studio :(dont know how to install for other apps sorry)

Extract the rar of the plugin you want to install and put the plugin map in the {where-ever-you-installed-FL}Image-lineFL Studio 8PluginsVST folder... 
Then start FL studio and rightclick one of the preset instruments on your screen (when you havent changed it ; kick, hat, clap and snare by default: just rightclick one of them) and then move your mouse over either insert or replace and then press more. A white screen pops up with all your currently installed plugins. You have to press refresh and then press fast scan. It should say that 1 new plugin (or more) has been found and it will be colored red in the list. Then you tick the box in front of it and press twice to open it.

This all applies for FL studio 8 (xxl producer edition?)

I hope you enjoy these plugins as much as i do ;)
