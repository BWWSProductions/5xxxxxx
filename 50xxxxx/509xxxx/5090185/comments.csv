[T],jwhitt62,2009-09-16T06:35Z,"Hey, fuckthesystem? I guess your fucking more than the system by not seeding your own upload. How about seeding your upload...or go FUCK YOURSELF!!!"
,WindTrade,2009-09-16T09:44Z,"Thanks, I was hoping for a 320 upload"
[T],fuckthesystem1,2009-09-16T11:44Z,hey jwhitt.. how about you go suck off rush limbaugh and glenn beck and give me a chance to seed my torrent. douchebag
,sky-ghost,2009-09-16T15:08Z,Remastred in stereo or what. She loves you still in mono or........?
,Carinas,2009-09-16T21:38Z,Please let us know is this The Stereo or The Mono (that we want) remastered albums??
,sergioXVII,2009-09-18T00:18Z,"Yes, these albums are definitely STEREO!
But I don't know if they are of 2009... I think so"
,thetime,2009-09-19T13:19Z,Why joint stereo?
[T],fuckthesystem1,2009-09-19T18:13Z,it's normal stereo.. not joint
,Frukfruk,2009-09-20T10:34Z,"Dear Mr. System,

 Will you please inform me as to what form these files are encoded? It's a large file and I will upload to at least a share ratio of at least one regardless, however,... nevermind it's MP3.
 So, my next quetion is, will you please upload the ISO ?  "
,budash2,2009-10-05T06:57Z,"Don't know why so many people who use PirateBay are such fucking douchebags. Seriously.

Thanks fuckethesystem1, nice torrent. Sounds pretty decent, better than others. 

Too all you whiners, shut the fuck up or find somewhere else to get your torrents."
,neil.hy,2009-10-12T01:09Z,"Some of you guys are so fucking funny.
You come on to TPB to download something for nothing and then moan about if it's stereo or mono, bitrates, mp3 degradation etc, etc.
If you want perfection ...go buy the fucking record from the shops!!"
,seowan333,2009-10-13T17:11Z,"Oh my goDDDDD~~~~~~~~

Thanks man....You are my hero........

Remastered albums plus 320kbps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Kona_,2009-10-14T02:48Z,thanks for the upload!
,NoCode0680,2009-10-19T19:12Z,"I'll have to wait until I get my Remastered Box Set for Christmas to make a real comparison, but I'm not entirely sure this is the real deal.  If it is then I'm not sure the Remastered albums are worth updating your Beatles collection over.  I've been comparing these files with my original CD's, with audiophile headphones on, and I'm not really noticing a difference.  These files are louder, but all I have to do is turn up the volume on the originals and it's the same.  Also suspect is that Past Masters is presented as Vol. 1 and Vol. 2.  My friend who has the box set says it is presented as one album, with a disc 1 and disc 2.  On this torrent each of them is disc 1 of 1.  Also there are a few skips in various songs, and a few tracks that are supposed to blend together have a pause in them."
,NoCode0680,2009-10-26T00:45Z,"I can officially say that these aren't the 2009 stereo remasters.  I borrowed 3 of the new remastered ablums from a friend of mine and compared them to these files.  I compared Rubber Soul, The White Album, and Let It Be, and there is a clear difference.  I knew from the start, it was plain as day from the opening of Drive My Car on the Rubber Soul CD and these files.  I had a feeling these were BS, but I wanted to be sure before I came right out and said it.  "
,kid-fix,2009-11-16T22:11Z,"Jwhitt you sound like such an arse! Great up F**Kthesystem...And like some have mentioned, if you're going to moan about the quality blah blah blah, then go and help support the dying music industry by putting your hands in your pockets. "
,L-310,2009-12-05T14:49Z,thank you for sharing! :)
,L-310,2009-12-05T14:52Z,"geez, just be thankful guys. "
,NoCode0680,2009-12-06T16:57Z,"The only thing I was saying is that this is not what it claims to be.  These are not the remastered stereo versions released in 2009.  I am getting them for Christmas, so the whole don't complain go out and buy it thing doesn't work on me.  I downloaded this because I was curious to compare them to the older CD's, but these are in fact the older CD's.  So instead of telling people who are pointing this out not to complain, why not tell the uploader not to falsely advertise the torrent.  Just call the torrent what it is, Beatles Discography, because it's not the Remastered discography."
,AppleMash,2009-12-31T20:22Z,"NoCode, I don't think you know what mastering even is...

Fuckthesystem, you have great fucking torrents.  Thank you."
,GeekHillbilly,2010-01-07T00:34Z,Thanks
,nanomano,2010-09-03T05:17Z,"nice torrent, download speeds were 1.5 MB/s"
,FethrdWlf,2010-09-04T17:23Z,Thanks man! I just joined the Beatles club at school and this will do me great!
,fadejewblack,2010-10-22T18:25Z,thanks for this 
,fluster84,2010-10-25T06:51Z,"Thanks for the upload fuckthesystem and all the seeders. Btw, there are MASSIVE HASH FAILS with this torrent. It seems those losers at Media Protector are flooding this one bad. I have downloaded about 1GB out of which ~396MB is ""Wasted"" and 363 hash fails. 

Im gonna try using Peerblock for this one. "
,everbleed,2010-11-12T20:19Z,"NoCode, thanks for the heads up. I was looking for the remasters and won't be downloading these if they aren't.

I don't see why people have to get all hot and bothered about somebody simply pointing out something which is actually quite useful. 

I'm sure this is a great torrent and all but fact is I'm looking specifically for the remasters and will now simply go and look for them elsewhere.
"
,alexstron,2010-12-03T22:52Z,"For the  record ""She loves you"" was only recorded in MONO"
,dkstoney,2010-12-09T07:43Z,"Arrogant, ungrateful, complaint-laden idiot pigs.

Thanks, fuckthesystem1, for helping me fuckthesystemtoo."
,ElRoc0,2010-12-21T12:28Z,Thanks!!! needed this!
,lowpriest,2010-12-21T19:54Z,Thank you! Nice torrent! Love the beatles! 
,dherrera56,2011-01-11T19:09Z,excellent upload
,alen0290,2011-02-19T09:58Z,"thank you, excellent sound "
,theryho,2011-04-20T00:25Z,"thanks for the download!
My seed ratio for this torrent is over 64 haha "
,tonedef85,2011-04-23T12:20Z,thanks!!! need more like this more albums less bullshit!!! ill seed the shit out of it
,Halfmad,2011-05-19T23:08Z,"I rushed the download of one file to test the quality.  Piss poor quality!
The Fool on the Hill, as the test, jumped around repeatedly.  Not listenable.  
I immediately stopped the torrent and moved on to a different one."
,Halfmad,2011-05-19T23:32Z,"Right... how do I delete my last comment?

I tried again, just to be sure.  The first attempt was apparently not fully downloaded, or something... even though it showed as having fully downloaded."
,brikkaz,2011-11-15T13:18Z,"Good torrent, quit your bitching. Besides, even if it isn't remastered, I don't know why all the fuss. It makes the tracks seem more original and more original seems a lot more 'Beatles', if you know what I'm saying...
Just relax, it's what they would've wanted."
,zozazoza,2012-01-07T14:53Z,"Thanks man, great work.
To the picky uploaders, be thankful!!
...and do better or shut up."
,zozazoza,2012-01-07T15:26Z,I meant downloaders...
,billysbragg,2012-03-23T22:15Z,"brikkaz- What a dopey thing to say. The remaining Beatles were the instigators of the remaster project so the old 80's CD versions are not now  ""what they would've wanted"". If u listen to any Beatles on radio now u will hear only the remastered versions. The old originals are dead and buried. So to upload a torrent & label it something it isn't is wrong and should be pointed out which some of you have. I for one appreciate that."
,Zofris,2012-05-10T19:00Z,many thanks
,TheRealAnvil,2012-06-22T21:56Z,"I should comment more....
Just wanted to say THX for the hard work to have access to this torrent.We can ALL bitch, but sometimes credit is not given as much as it should be!
PEACE"
,TheRealAnvil,2012-06-22T22:01Z,"BTW....I'm leeching and seeding this in the hope to replace my own Vinyl collection. There is a reason for some peeps to want the ""vinyl"" recordings....not the ""re-mastered"" ones.
Nuff Said
PEACE"
,sonny1960,2012-07-27T01:37Z,"Thanks for your time and effort, I know I appreciate it."
