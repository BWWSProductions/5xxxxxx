"My Time" is the second single from Fabolous' album Loso's Way. The song features Jeremih, who also co-wrote the track with Fabolous. Jeremih uses the Auto-Tune effect in the song.

The video for "My Time" released on May 28, 2009. At the end of the video, there's a snippet of "Everything, Everyday, Everywhere" for what is presumed to be Fabolous' next single. Jeremih does not appear in the video. The song is cut by about two minutes for the video to remove Jeremih's verse. Ryan Leslie appears in the video for his intro in "Everything, Everyday, Everywhere." The song was used as the theme for the 2009 NBA Draft and Season 4 Premiere of America's Best Dance Crew.
