Warehouse 13 is an American science fiction series that premiered on July 7, 2009 on Syfy. Executive-produced by Jack Kenny and David Simkins, the dramatic comedy from Universal Media Studios has been described as "part The X-Files, part Raiders of the Lost Ark and part Moonlighting." It has also been accused of "borrowing" much from the 1980s television series Friday the 13th: The Series.

The series follows United States Secret Service agents Myka Bering (Joanne Kelly) and Peter Lattimer (Eddie McClintock) as they are reassigned to the government's secret Warehouse 13, which houses supernatural objects. They are tasked to retrieve missing objects and investigate reports of new ones.
