Exposed is a 1979 live album by Mike Oldfield.
The album was a collection of Oldfield's tours in Spain, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and England from March to April 1979. It peaked at #16 on the UK Album Chart.

A double CD version was later released. A DVD version of the concert, recorded at Wembley Conference Centre, followed suit and was released in 2005.

"Guilty" was released as a single between the release of Incantations and Exposed.

Initially during the tour the concerts were being recorded without the knowledge of the musicians, so that they could be paid less money; for just a performance and not a recording, the musicians found out, but the recordings went ahead and the album was produced.[1]

The artwork is linked to the title, as it shows a frame of film containing a photo of Oldfield in a concert arena.

The album was recorded at The Manor Studio's Mobile unit, and mixed at The Town House, London.
