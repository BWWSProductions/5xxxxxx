,Bamimi,2009-09-26T06:26Z,"We have someone who is a friend of mine in the US here that was involved in world war II on the nazi's side. He's a good man, not 'bad' nor does he have evil in him anymore really, but...the bottom line is, it happened. period. I'm not saying everything said is true about it....common sense should tell people nothing anyone says is 100% true. and there were a lot more people massacred then just jews, so the jews certainly do not have capitalism on the anger or the crusade.
  But it happened, you can watch a million shows that use a million different clips and this or that to say it didn't, but it did. I really could care less honestly. not the first time millions of people have died, won;t be the last and frankly the world has to many people in it anyways imnsho. nothing against jews.spanish,arabs, chinese or whatever though. have a nice day.

,1derline,2009-09-26T08:17Z,"I read this whole thing and I must comment.  I consider myself pretty open minded.  I am downloading this so that I can see this evidence.  And I don't have a right to say weather I think it did or didn't happen.  I have not done any actual hands on research to determine that.  HANDS ON would be the big thing here.  I find the information presented by historians when this Holocaust was first brought to light, was to inform people of this happening.  Not to prove that it happened.  Now I see many making an attempt to disprove it.  What is the motive???  It is like people trying to convince other people there is no God.  If you don't think it happened, find something else to do.  If one TRULY believes or TRULY doesn't believe something, then go with that.  The need to try to convince other people of ones beliefs is in itself giving much weight to what they are trying to disprove."
,sonofdog,2009-09-26T10:54Z,Uploads by anonymous are usually fake or infected. Was about to download this but thought better of it remembering all the fakes he's posted.

you DO realize that anonymous is not one particular poster, right? If you post something, and don't fill in the poster box, that's what comes up."

,jabijabo,2009-10-01T15:35Z,"This documentary is only to be seen as a ""How can editing totally change the story and create a distorted or  false reality with recorded facts"". Being French and studying the matter intensively for more than 20 years, I know that all the historically reported killings HAPPENED and the only lies are those fabricated today by some outrageous liars like those editing these stupid videos. This is plain stupid and outrageaous. Millions were killed horribly, everywhere, jews and others. And denying their deaths and sufferings is not worthy of any today human being. Just die fuckers negationists."
,jabijabo,2009-10-01T15:40Z,I must add that in France today publicly denying proven historic crimes is fortunately considered a crime and is prosecuted. Official History can and should be questioned but only in free countries with true freedom of speech and also only when you accept the final evidence and agree to one truth that has been proven by the overall community of experts and those studying them. So please just shut up now you dangerous facts twisters lies makers revisionists.
,jabijabo,2009-10-01T15:52Z,"Bamimi makes a mistake when it says it is not the first time millions die because he ignores that it was the first time that it was made this way, in an industrial way, meaning with at such a pace and with such a total denial for humanity. Nazis considered themselves as the first stage to breeding a new ""humanity"" that would have had only one goal in the centuries to come: destroy or enslave ALL humans that we are. It is worst that the worst Alien invasion scenario."
,budgiebutt,2009-10-02T13:50Z,"Posting anonymously is used because of fear of being caught. Being a revisionist should not be a crime. Its frustrating at times but true freedom of speech is a wonderful thing.

BTW I don't agree with these videos and don't even feel like downloading them but I don't believe we should silence people. 

As for the nature of these killings and stating the uniqueness of nazis - eugenics was not created in nazi germany nor were they the first to implement its theories. In fact its scary but the world forgets these things .Ironically even Israel is bordering on the dangerous:

As for mass genocide. Unfortunately it existed before (rome, crusades, Ghengis Khan etc). and continues to this day (Albania, Rwanda, Pol Pott etc.)

We seem to forget our own recent history and are doomed to repeat it. Stopping freedom of speech though was one of the first things the nazi's did (along with every other dictator) and lead to their ability to divide and conquer the masses."

,azeram,2009-10-19T23:12Z,"I watched it, just in case... to see if the authors hasd been thorough. Well NO!!. They twist actual fact to prove their point. It's like they are trying to convince themself  that they are right, refusing to admit that they live in denial. Nothing in those video make sense or prove anything.

Sad !!"
,xiIix,2009-11-26T11:17Z,"A lot of fucking people died in WW2. That's for damn sure. However, that said, I really do doubt that some of the stories told by these people are true. I mean honestly. I don't think that many soldiers, no matter how loyal to Hitler, would have the stomach for that kind of shit. Humanity lives in almost everyone. It's RARE to find someone who is a cold blooded killer who can kill people the way Germans are portrayed in the movies.

But, what's done is done. There's NO WAY IN HELL that anyone is going to recalibrate what they believe about WW2 and the holocaust. It's too ingrained and beaten like a dead horse."
,viedma,2010-07-25T06:55Z,"NEO NAZI LIES AND EVIDENCE AGAINST THE HOLOCAUST: These many videos are a crude (although clever) attempt to deny the holocaust, I can-t cover all these lies in this brief space but here-s one: they say that a German witness said that in a camp 750 people were crowded in a space of 1,590 cubic feet and shows that is impossible, even allowing for many children, but they omit that the confession says (and the movie shows it) FOUR TIMES 1,590 cubic feet, which is perfectly possible... They dwell on a list of supposed inconsistencies to deny a fact that has been proved by millions of elements of evidence that support the fact of the Holocaust, so forcefully that governments like the German and Austrian, which initially let go many war criminals with slaps on the wrist or nothing at all, now condemn to prison those who deliberately deny the Holocaust to support neo-nazi views. WATCH THESE VIDEOS CAREFULLY and you-ll see what a big lie they are."
,stu1000,2011-08-06T02:30Z,"If you watch this video with an open mind then you will see that no way the holocaust happened.

I was a believer for most of my life, but after viewing this I see that I have been massively lied to by the main stream media and hollywood, liars the lot of them."
