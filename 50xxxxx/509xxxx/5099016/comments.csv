,nblax27,2009-09-24T18:56Z,"Thanks MG!

Since you plan on ""retiring"" I was wondering if you could get together a tutorial on how you go about ripping, editing, and encoding. I'm pretty good with computers but I have never done anything like this before. I wouldn't mind trying to do it and upload it for everyone.  Maybe you can include what software/programs you use in this process. Myself and possible others can try to get it down so by December you can relax."

Could you post some URL's for the ""stock"" pics you throw up for the show. I want to add pretty pictures to my uploads."
,Frrrrrrrrrrankus,2009-09-24T19:17Z,No one retires from this gang!!  God bless you MG.
[V],mothergoose56,2009-09-24T20:39Z,"nblax27: I will post a (virus-scanned) torrent with the tools I use and a rundown of what I do before I stop the early ups. It's not the only means of ripping the show mind you but it might help. I also am planning some archive torrents, hopefully they actually get seeded this time.
