,rchardt59,2009-09-16T12:08Z,Works and works good.  It installs Cydia and Icy - The Carrier is left blank.  Use the Shift+Restore feature in Itunes to install.   You do not have to put it in DFU mode first...
,shein87,2009-09-16T13:53Z,You do have to put it in DFU IF you hasn't jailbroken your device before. If it is jailbroken then you only have to put it in recovery mode. Do you have a signal bar or is it gone?
,FusionXtorrent,2009-09-17T09:41Z,"tried on 5 different computers...

when in DFU, just hangs @ preparing iphone for restore. when i switch back to default, it loads fine.

was this actually tested?"
,acutturi,2009-09-17T13:58Z,"I updated my jailbroke 3g with Apple's 3.1 and lost all my cracked apps.  I have tried to restore using this version of 3.1, but it stops and give me errors half way through.  
Once I have used the Apple 3.1, can I still restore using this 3.1?  Can I rejailbreak the phone?"
,shein87,2009-09-17T19:30Z,"If you haven't synced your cracked apps with iTunes then you have to get them all again. Hackulo have updated their appsync hack to work with 3.1. Yes i have testet this on 2 iPhones and they are working great. The first one i put in DFU and restored, the other one was jailbroken so i put it in restore. the first 3 times i tried with the second one it gave me errors or never began with the update. the 4th time (without changing any settings) it updated and worked. 

I connected the iPhone to the computer and then put it in recovery, first time it gave me 1600 error, the phone rebooted to recovery and i tried again, this time the screen on the iphone changed to the one with the status bar but itunes stalled, so i pulled the USB connector and the iPhone rebooted to recovery, this happened one more time but the last it worked without a glitch.

,tamboy,2009-09-20T11:31Z,is this working with iphone 3gs?
,loutsopo,2009-09-22T11:55Z,Thanks but not working for me even and dfu mode error 1600 and1604.
,charlieday2009,2009-09-27T13:22Z,"thanks for the upload but it did not work for me. I have previously jailbroken, restore in DFU error 1600"
,lemonton,2009-09-27T19:20Z,Doesn't work for me - do I need to use it from 3.0?
,error720,2009-10-04T14:52Z,"Hi Guys, I have downloaded this firmware but afraid to install it. I have few queries :-

1 . I have Iphone 3g with 3.0 OS. Can I install    
3.1 directly without installing 3.1 OS from Apple site.
2.If this 3.1 OS does not install properly will it harm my Iphone?

Waiting for response.

Thanks, 
SAM"
,MageVaRup,2009-10-06T22:15Z,Does it work on Ipod touch ?
,pyro459,2009-10-08T06:52Z,"Hi,

will this work on a non jailbroken OS 3.1 3G?"
,sephiath,2009-10-10T17:56Z,"Why is ICY included in this firmware? It causes errors having Cydia and ICY together. I updated my Iphone 3G from 3.0.1 with this firmware and when I opened Cydia to setup and add appsync,I got an error saying that Cydia did not know which version it was running due to ICY being present as well, and It says you must restore and uncheck Icy within redsnow, but there is no way to do that with this process. I could not use Cydia and was stuck with the only option to restore again.
Luckily I went through the process of this update again and did not open ICY, and have not since and everything is working perfectly. ICY is just an icon that lay dormant on my iphone that I dare to open as I was curious what it was and opened it the first time and got the error.  This makes no sense to me why it is included. Before the 3.1 update was around, and everyone used redsnow to jailbreak their iphones, it stated CLEARLY that when prompted to select to install with Cydia and ICY to UNCHECK ICY.  Beware!"
,sephiath,2009-10-10T18:07Z,"Also just to let people know that after this update, iTunes will prompt that there is a carrier update, and it is ok to update carrier updates through iTunes, it does not interfere with your jailbreak/unlock.  It takes only seconds after you click ok and it is done. You do need the carrier update to have MMS available once again after this."
,babylon77,2009-12-09T16:50Z,normaly to install jailbroken or custom firmwARE your iphone has to be jailbroken before install or else you get error 1600 and you cant  install if you upgraded to 3.1.2 then you will have to downgrade and jailbreak befor you install
,killerxtinct,2010-01-21T12:45Z,does this works with 3gs
