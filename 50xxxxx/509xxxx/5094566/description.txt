Busted - Busted [2002]


Busted is the first album by British pop rock band Busted. It was released in Britain in September 2002 and peaked at number 2 the following January after the success of second single "Year 3000". "What I Go to School For", "You Said No" and "Sleeping with the Light On" were also released as singles and all reached the top 3 of the UK Singles Chart.
Busted was reissued soon after its initial release with three bonus tracks â€” "When Day Turns Into Night", "Everything I Knew" and "Extra Exceedingly Fitness" â€” while "Crash and Burn" adopted its single title of "You Said No". "Extra Exceedingly Fitness", a short interlude on guitar, is not written on the album artwork.
Six tracks were co-written with John McLaughlin and/or Steve Robson, who often collaborate with each other.  The other five songs were written by the band themselves.
It was the 8th bestselling album of 2003 in the UK. The album has been certified as 3x Platinum in the UK.  Both "What I Go to School For" and "Year 3000" were covered by the Jonas Brothers in 2006.
