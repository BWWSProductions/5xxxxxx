ive noticed blu-ray rips do this in a BIG way. but im assuming its because its decent sound and not shitty 128kb or watever it usually is"
,truthy,2009-09-24T23:30Z,"thx for sharing - good video/audio quality.

@not enough

if you play 6 channel ac3 audio (= 5.1) on stereo speakers some channels will always be louder than others (mostly bass/effects). with dts 5.1 its even worse ... but that doesn't mean the audio is too loud - it means you'll need 5.1 speakers to play it back properly (audio quality is perfect). but there are a few things you can do - if you, like me, lack the money or space to buy them ;-)

- install AC3 Filter & enable DRC (Dynamic Range Compression) ... then use a media player to watch the movie which doesn't use its own codecs instead of vlc, mpc ...  wmp, old version of bsplayer (you gotta have xvid installed too - in a codec pack like ffdshow or single) 
- there's also Dialogue Normalization (Reduction) ... besweet, audio needs to be reencoded
- convert the audio to AC3 2.0 (megui, besweet, eac3to) ... Stereo-Downmix

but I myself still keep 5.1 & just switch the volume on my stereo down 2 levels & then back up again during dialogues ...  for maybe someday I'll buy good 5.1 speakers"
