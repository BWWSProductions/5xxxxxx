,ras_yo,2009-09-24T20:07Z,"The best Story of Wolverine I ever seen 
Thanks DePo"
,logruszed,2009-09-25T01:23Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I'll have to say that GS was a real let-down for this story arc. 

Maybe if they go on with it and show him re-forming the Avengers or something it would be god, but leaving it as this was just a bummer."
,niceguyanthony,2009-09-25T03:21Z,"actually the ending was brilliant. remember millar's run on FF? That's logan and baby bruce making up the new fantastic force from the future. 1985, FF, and old man logan all tie together"
,baconninja,2009-09-25T03:39Z,Anyone have a link to a readable scan of Old Man Logan?
,Fig-Neutron,2009-09-26T01:37Z,"I've been waiting since February for Giant Size.  Unfortunately, sounds like I'll have to wait a little longer still.

Thanks for the work, anyway."
,BlackLaval,2009-09-26T06:40Z,"@arnesaknussem:
the worst scan you've ever seen?
Well, you no nothing about bad scans, this one's actually quite readable."
,slobinh,2009-10-03T19:50Z,"giant size wolverine is not that bad. there are some cropped pages and a little bit missing text.

thx uploader"

,MisterFilthee,2010-09-06T08:30Z,"This series is great. An amazing homage to ""Unforgiven."" The Giant-Size finale is not that bad of a scan. Give it some credit people."
,cartman19987,2011-04-09T18:20Z,Thanks for this! I'll seed indefinitely.
