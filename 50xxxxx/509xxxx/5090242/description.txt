Fleet Command is part of a three series Naval Warfare Collection that includes F/A-18 Simulator and the 688 Hunter/Killer Submarine PC game. I do not have the submarine game but I do have the F/A-18 and if people want it then I need to have request for it but if not then I won't upload it. Included in this package is a "CloneCD" program to burn games and the "Alcohol-120% that also burns games, the choice is yours open which to use. Have fun!
