,v2jafer,2009-10-07T12:24Z,Hey there would it be possible for you to re-post the extras pack? My download for it seems to have stalled. I have the iso for the windows versions burnt and it works. But I need the extras pack to do anything with it.  Thx.

without the extra pack, please?"

,Straydog1st,2009-10-27T06:48Z,"Is there someone to seed here, please? There are still about 40 peers with 66.7% waiting since my last comment. I know the torrent is available on many other places, but not the extra pack."

I have downloaded and coppied various version of Windows 7 to DVD but none of them seem to be ""bootable"", the only way to install them is to do a upgrade through your existing OS, which then converts the old Windows Director to ""windows.old"", you can delete the folder afterwards, but still, how can you copy Windows 7 to DVD and then boot from the DVD drive to do a fresh install."
