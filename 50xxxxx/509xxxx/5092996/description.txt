This is what Scientology music sounds like. This is probably the only album where you'll hear stars like John Travolta sing about their religion, with lyrics like "Take the route of auditing and once again be free.", or the "lullaby" "The Worried Being" that ends with "And then they gave him Scientology" to which the children's choir respond "Hooray! He was free!". 

Frank Stallone gets a solo number, the catchy "The Evil Purpose", with lyrics like "In modern times the scientists / wag their heads disheveled / Wondering why psychiatrists / Leave the whole world bedeviled", and the nonsensical chorus "Puzzle, puzzle, trouble, trouble / Arcane? Insane? Spirit? Brain?"

And once you've made it through the album none other than L. Ron Hubbard, who composed all the songs, sings "Thank you for listening / I write just for you" (This must be heard to be believed)
