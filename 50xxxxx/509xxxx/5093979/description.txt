Installation:
1. First you need to download AES here http://www.aerosoft2.de/downloads/aes/AS_Airport-Enhancement-Services_V204.zip
2. Install AES
3. Over-write the contents of your X:Microsoft Flight Simulator XAerosoftAES folder with the files in this torrent (Make a back up first)

Start AES (2.04) and you will have over 100 credits!

Req.:
All Imagine Simulations Airports for FSX.

For some reason this doesn't work on all PC's so here are uninstall instructions for AES:
1. Deinstall AES from FS scenery.cfg

2. Delete the AES folder (FS9AerosoftAES)

3. Delete the following registry entries:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREaerosoft [cryptic string]

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREaerosoftAES-Basepack&&AirportPack - FS2004 (if it's not removed after deinstallation)

HKEY_USERS [Looong cryptic string] SoftwareVB an VBA Program Settings [same cryptic string as above]

4. A new installation of AES won't know that you have typed in blacklisted serials before.
