,mad_flyer,2009-10-07T21:34Z,Doesn't work for me.
,hunfatal,2009-10-11T01:41Z,"Doesn't work for me under FS9. It says ""aes files corrupted, please reinstall"". I don't try it in FSX.

I think it uses different files under FSX, and maybe FSX files are cracked, but fs9 files doesn't."
,Nlmichiej,2009-10-14T16:59Z,"Works perfectly fine in both FS9 and FSX here.

,UAL1661,2009-11-15T17:27Z,"Doesnt work for me.  I get an error, and when I try to remove it, I am not able to find the reg. entrys"
,gav24088,2009-11-19T14:58Z,"If you're getting errors all you need to do is re-copy the cracked AES file into the program directory. Then open your windows firewall (or whatever firewall software you are using) and create a new ""Program Rule"". Navigate to your ""AESHelp.exe"" file and 'block' the program.  Then 'Viola' - no more errors! Enjoy.."
,Nlmichiej,2009-11-26T21:38Z,"I just followed the description. Though by now I have some problems too, though I don't think it has anything to do with the torrent itself.

I was asking for serials because I want to have more than just 100 credits as I have more airports I want to unlock =P The ones that were in there worked fine for me though. "
,Edward9401,2009-11-29T20:24Z,Send Serials please to Edward.Kjellen@gbgsd.se
,gav24088,2009-11-29T23:48Z,"What works for me is downloading/installing an older version (1.99b) and then copying the 2.04 crack over the top. This updates to 2.04 without having to download the latest version from Aerosoft. Then block AEShelp in your firewall. 
just be careful not to download any AES updates from aerosoft 'cos that will stuff it up."

,Mister_Toine,2009-12-21T12:53Z,Works like a charm! Thnx!
,parminder27,2009-12-29T19:58Z,"This works great! Thanks so much guys! 

Just one thing: If I update to 2.05 - or any newer version for that matter in the future, how do I implement this crack? If I merge the whole AES 2.04 folder with the 2.05 one, the software gets corrupted and won't function. Any help guys?"
,jeratpb,2010-01-02T02:30Z,"I was always getting error after 3rd loading on AES supported airport, and had to copy files from torrent to make it work again. After little reserach I found that there are actually only 3 important files that you have to copy again: AES_0001.DAT, AES_0002.DAT from AES directory, and AES_LFFFF0.BGL from AES\SCENERY directory
You can also mark them as read-only after you finish AES configuration and you will never get an error again!!!
Only when you need to change AES configuration you have to remove read-only status temporarily"
