The album was awarded a 9/10 score by Clash Music, with the review instructing the reader to "just buy a copy, and PLAY IT FUCKING LOUD." [3] The NME also gave the album a positive review, awarding a rating of 8/10. Ben Patashnik writes: "Travels... feels like a product of 2009, a coruscating reaction to everything that makes us mad but which is never self-righteous or preachy."[4] Andrew P. Street of Time Out Sydney concluded "Let's draw a line in the sand right here, people: either this is your favourite album of this year, or you're just plain wrong."[5] The fly giving the album 4.5 out of 5 was controversial due to the fact the album featured a song denouncing the business, "that damned fly".
