"Don't!" is a song by Canadian singer Shania Twain. It was the second single released from her 2004 Greatest Hits album. The song was written by Twain and then-husband Mutt Lange. "Don't!" underperformed on most charts, mostly due to no promotion by Shania and very little by the label. The highest it made was number ten airplay in Canada. The song was also included under the end credits of the 2005 film An Unfinished Life, and in the Brazilian soap opera AmÃ©rica.

The music video for "Don't!" was shot in Oaxaca, Mexico at an abandoned hotel and Yucca plantation. It was filmed on October 24, 2004 and released December 30, 2004, it was directed by Wayne Isham. The video is available on some of the commercial singles for "Don't!". In 2006, CMT Canada named "Don't!" the eighth sexiest country music video.

In the video Twain is riding around on her horse through rows of Yucca wearing red dress, and walking around within the hotel wearing white dress with the corset. Near the end of the video a tear running down Shania's face can be seen
