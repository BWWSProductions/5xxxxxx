,jurjenb,2009-12-18T16:37Z,"I have a hard drive with pretty much every sector on the surface being corrupt. GetDataBack could see files, but not the names. Scandisk would not repair anymore, since there was too much damage and too little free space to store the repairs. Tools like Partition Magic couldn't read the contents of the disk.

I was getting pretty depressed, since I couldn't even get a look at the file names anymore to see what I need to get back from others. During a last attempt to look for better recovery software I came on this page...

It works magnificent! This is a miracle worker!!
It's now busy copying everything to a second disk. 5 stars for this tool!!! Although everything is coming back 20-25% of the files are not perfect anymore, but on the other hand: my drive was pretty f**ked up (and maybe scandisk also did some damage)."
,rocketero,2010-01-01T06:07Z,"I have a 500 GiGas Maxtor HD, and a couple of days ago suddenly became unreadable, Computer Management listed it as RAW format. 

I thought I would never see my data/programs again.

but thanks to this software I recovered 328 GiGAS of information.

my thumbs up for this torrent."

,gropecunt,2010-03-09T15:30Z,"This software saved 500GB worth of music when Windows started reading my second drive as RAW format. It's a very potent and easy to use program. I recommend it to anyone that needs to recover pr0n and music from a corrupted partition. This is a full version with no need for a crack. Thanks RobbingHood and thanks EASEUS, this program is great."

,dragonrxd,2010-03-23T07:06Z,"Hi guys 

help me out PLEASE.
Early This year i ripped a few dvd movies onto my external hard drive and i used dvd cloner to burn it and they are all dual layer movies.
But the burning process was unsuccessful and i wasted 3 Blank dual layer dvds.
But the very strange thing is those movies i was trying to burn,have COMPLETELY disappeared from my external hard drive.
this is the first time i have experience something 
like this.

Now is it possible for me to recover those missing movies by using this program? 
if yes which mode should i use and 
how should i do it ?

Thank you for taking your time reading this
and thanks in advance.

,HookFacedOne,2010-07-02T22:05Z,I been running this program in the full recovery mode for 3 days on a 1TB external harddrive that crashed and keeps saying it needs to be re-formatted. The progress bar is about 1/2 way and its found over a million boot records but no actual files. Am I wasting my time running it? Am I using the wrong program? If so does anyone have any suggestions? I know there's 100Gig of files on the dirve that I dont want to loose. Thanks in advance

,cojon,2012-02-07T11:02Z,"Fiberoptica:
2TB of PORN?  Sheeesh!   

Are you sure that the bimbo was the problem?  Seems you were also sidetracked enough to let her screw up your highly prized porn collection. 

If she got your attention that diverted, maybe you should reconsider her and just improve the computer security.  Hmmmm?"
,cojon,2012-02-07T11:11Z,"jurjenb:

Same for me.  The usual stuff couldn't do much good. Just like you, it screwed things up even more. I thought I was lost but i heard about this.  

The other stuff was written to fix those problems but it wouldn't even read the disk. When i turned EASEUS on it the missing stuff instantly became readable copy.

EASEUS fixed it like it wasn't even wrong.

WOW!

Now that's the way to write software. What a program! "
,KoiNadi,2012-02-22T13:46Z,"Hi RobbingHood! Thank you so much for this torrent,I downloaded a couple of different 'data recovery' torrents on PB and well compared to this 'Easeus Wizard' I regret ever having anything to do with any of them. Im not to tech savvy, so the whole make up of this program is easy to understand,simple and very straight forward. The fact that it is the full version not like the 'scan for files and pay for results' programs that people pass off here on PB. 
If I could rate this it would be:
10/10 - [*][*][*][*][*] - 100% AWESOME!!!!!!

Thank you so much RobbingHood, you just saved my 16yr old music library from going down the drain. I HEART you xx"
,Droppinplates84,2012-03-12T05:23Z,"So far so good. I have been running this program for 3 days after accidentally formatting the wrong hard drive in a command prompt(Doah!), and it has been recovering some of my AVI files that are playable. It is not complete yet so I'm hoping the reason some of the files that so far arent playable will be after it completes. Even if it recovers 50-75% of my AVI files and have them playable, I'll be a happy camper. 3 days and 50% complete on 1.7TB worth of movies. Thanks RobbingHood and seeders!"
