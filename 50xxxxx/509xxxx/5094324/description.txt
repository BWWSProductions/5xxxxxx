A live prformance by Taylor Swift - You Belong With Me from the 2009 CMT Music Awards Show.


"You Belong with Me" is a song co-written and recorded by American country artist Taylor Swift. It is the third single from her second album, Fearless. The song was originally released as a digital single, peaking at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 based on downloads. In April 2009, it was officially released to radio, debuting at #32 on the Hot Country Songs charts on the chart week of May 2, 2009. The song is Swift's eighth Top 10 country hit. This song also won the award for "Best Female Video" at the 2009 Video Music Awards. After the official full release, the song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #2 so far, becoming her highest charting single, as well as her fourth top ten hit, eighth top twenty, and thirteenth top forty hit. "You Belong With Me" was the first song in over nine years to be in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts simultaneously (the last one being Faith Hill's 2000 single "Breathe").

The music video won the Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, making Swift the first country artist in history to win a moonman. During her acceptance speech, Swift was interrupted by Kanye West, which caused a media stir. Swift was invited back on stage to finish her acceptance speech by R&B singer BeyoncÃ© Knowles, who won "Video of the Year" for her "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" instead of Knowles delivering a speech for her win.

"You Belong with Me" first charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and Pop 100 charts in 2008 based on downloads after its release as a digital single. Upon the song's release to country radio in April 2009, it debuted at #32 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated for May 2, 2009. It re-entered the Hot 100 at #87 on the chart week of May 16. As of August 12, 2009 it has reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, her highest charting single. On the chart week of August 22, 2009, it became her fourth Number One country hit in the U.S. (and fifth overall). It has also become the highest charting country single on the Hot 100 since Carrie Underwood's "Inside Your Heaven" reached #1 in 2005. In the UK, "You Belong with Me" first appeared in the top 100 singles at #99, over a period of seven weeks it has since climbed to #50.
