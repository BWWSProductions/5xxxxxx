ATTENTION !!! FOR ALL THOSE WHO GET â€œFAILED TO LOAD PAGEâ€ ERROR WHEN ACCESSING PERSONALIZE AFTER USING SIMILAR SOFTWARE.

If you have the above mentioned problem reboot in safe and restore your system to a previous state using System restore mode(it won't work if the operation is not performed in safe mode). 
Start your computer normally after.
Install DreamScene_EN_v4 running the application as Administrator (Right Click). After that just choose video files either .wmv or .mpg files by selecting "Dreamscene Content" from Desktop Background option in Personalize.

Don't try with .dream files because this format is not supported.

For safety measures make a system restore point before installing though I had no problem installing this.

My computer specs:
HP HDX 18 1005EA
Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium 64bit

Say Thanks ;)
