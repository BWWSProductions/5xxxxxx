Bite Me With Dr. Mike

Virologist and adventure junkie Dr. Mike Leahy welcomes up-close-and-personal encounters with Earth's most dangerous creatures -- often tiny ones -- that can create big headaches for unsuspecting travelers. Whether they want to suck, bite, sting or feed on his body, he'll do whatever it takes to better understand what they're all about.

Dr. Mike used to be a motorcycle mechanic, but after 10 years of grease and gears he decided to go back to school. But not just any school -- Dr. Mike completed a Ph.D. in Virology from Oxford University. Dr. Mike is really interested in two things: traveling and bugs (the ones that creep around or the ones inside the human body).

Join Dr. Mike on an unforgettable journey around the world to learn more about creatures who love nothing more than to take a bite out of your vacation.
