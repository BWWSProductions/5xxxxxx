Copied from the Notepad++ Homepage:


Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in "free beer") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages.
Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.

Based on a powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.

This project is mature. However, there may be still some bugs and missing features that are being worked on.

I hope you enjoy Notepad++ as much as I enjoy coding it.


Here are the features of Notepad++ :

WYSIWYG 

If you have a colour printer, print your source code (or whatever you want) in colour.


User Defined Syntax Highlighting 

It allows user to define his own language : not only the syntax highlighting keywords, but also the syntax folding keywords, comment keywords and the operators.


Auto-completion 

For most supported languages, user can make his/her own API list.
Once the api file is ready, type Ctrl+Space to launch this action.


Multi-Document 

You can edit several documents at the same time.


Multi-View 

You have two views at same time. That means you can visualize (edit) 2 different documents at the same time. You can visualize (edit) in the 2 views one document at 2 different positions as well. The modification of document in one view will carry out in another view (i.e. you modify the SAME document when you are in clone mode). 


Regular Expression Search/Replace supported 

You can search and replace one string in the document by using the regular expression.


Full Drag â€˜N' Drop supported 

You can open a document by drag & drop.
You can also move your document from a position (or even a view) to another by drag & drop. 


Dynamic position of Views 

The user can set the position of the views dynamically (only in 2 views mode : the splitter can be set in horizontal or in vertical). 


File Status Auto-detection 

If you modify or delete a file which opened in Notepad++, you will be notified to update your document (reload the file or remove the file). 


Zoom in and zoom out 

That's another fantastic function of Scintilla component.


Multi-Language environment supported 

The Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Hebrew Windows environments are supported.


Bookmark 

User can just click on the bookmark margin (located right side of line number margin) or type Ctrl+F2 to toggle a book mark.
To reach the bookmark, type just F2 (Next bookmark) or Shift+F2 (Previous bookmark). To clear all bookmarks, click the Menu Search->Clear All bookmarks.


Brace and Indent guideline Highlighting 

When the caret stay beside of one of those symbol { } [ ] ( ) , the symbol beside of caret and its symmetric opposite symbol will be highlighted, as well as the indent guideline (if any) in order to locate the block more easily.


Macro recording and playback 

You can save several macros and edit their keyboard shorcuts for the next use.
