Majesty 2: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim%u201D which is a sequel to the original game Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim that was released almost 10 years ago now. Majesty 2: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim blends the excitement of kingdom building simulation with the depth of a role-playing game. The game includes one single-player campaign, 10 multiplayer missions, 16 maps, and multiplayer modes for two or four players. As you%u2019ll no doubt remember, Majesty 2: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim is the official sequel to Cyberlore%u2019s original game that was around back at the turn of the millennium. Whilst a sequel was planned by the original developers, it was eventually canned, and nothing more was done to the series. Ten years later and the long lost sequel has finally been realised, thanks to new developer%u2019s 1C and their distributer, Paradox. Like when any publisher acquires an IP that started life elsewhere, Paradox have tried to make a game that stays true to the old-school Majesty spirit, whilst also possessing a bit of Paradox flavour
