Carey revealed on May 20, 2009 that she was calling the album Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel because it was going to be â€œvery personal and dedicated to the fansâ€. She says that the reason she chose to use three images for the cover art is because â€œthere are a lot of different emotions and stories revealed on this albumâ€.
