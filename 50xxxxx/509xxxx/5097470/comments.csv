[T],eyezin,2009-09-23T22:07Z,The fact that you can play the Black Edition Challenge in the Challenge Series is properly a give-away.

[T],eyezin,2009-09-26T00:56Z,Follow the instruction found in these files (INFO.nfo or ReadMe).
,faraza,2009-09-26T06:43Z,Looks like Black edition because the size of the game is different from the original need for speed most wanted.
,faraza,2009-09-26T06:47Z,"Eyezin, I Love You !"
,faraza,2009-09-26T06:47Z,Eyezin rocks !!!
,faraza,2009-09-27T10:25Z,Its Most Wanted and not black edition
,faraza,2009-09-27T10:26Z,Don't Download. I wasted my time downloading this. It is normal NFS MOST WANTED and NOT the black edition
,faraza,2009-09-27T10:27Z,It is just patching NFS MOST WANTED to V.1.3 and saying it as black edition. DONT DOWNLOAD
,faraza,2009-09-27T10:28Z,I wasted my time with this shit. :(:(:(
,faraza,2009-09-27T10:29Z,"Tell me eyezin, why you fooled us saying it is black edition. you hurt me very much."

,karazykid,2009-10-04T09:15Z,This game doesn't work on Vista 64. Followed every instruction in the .nfo. If I run it with the crack as soon as I start it I get a pop up twice that says it's stopped working. If I try to run it from the iso it asks for the right disc no matter which I use. 
,FQU,2009-10-04T11:51Z,"Thank you very much eyezin!

[T],eyezin,2009-11-04T20:13Z,You replace the speed.exe in the directory where the game is installed. If the one provided does not work you can get one from GameCopyWorld or megagames. You need version 1.3 English  
,Ophiicus,2009-11-13T11:55Z,There are several options for obtaining a cracked speed.exe from gamecopyworld and many of them do not work.  Always remember Reloaded is your friend and that is the version I have working.  Ta for the up.

The original speed.exe is about 7MB.the crack here is about 20MB.The crack from other websites is lower than 7MB

Considering I tried using the crack from this torrent, I would say that that is not the case. I had to use the other crack I listed above. Maybe this one will work for some people, but it did not for me."
,bk12321,2010-05-26T02:42Z,"@L_S_wEr

To mount an .iso file as a virtual drive, you need one of the following programs:

1) Daemon Tools
2) Magicdisc
3) Alcohol 120%

All 3 of those can mount an .ISO file as a virtual drive. This means that the virtual drive will show up to the Operating System as a physical CD/DVD drive, but it is only software instead of a physical drive (hardware). It saves you from having to burn a CD and put it in your drive, so you can just emulate the drive instead. It's a very easy process once you do it one time."

1.) Copy contents of ALL the discs/ISOs to a regular folder somewhere on your computer. You should have one folder that is basically all the CDs merged together.

2.) Inside the AutoRun folder is a file called ""autorun.cfg""; open it in Notepad (or your text editor of choice).

3.) Change the line ""DirectXVersion=9.0c"" to read ""DirectXVersion=0"".

4.) Save and close the file.

5.) Back up to the folder that contains all the disc files, and run AutoRun.exe. It should now install properly. "
