Need for Speed: Most Wanted 'Black Edition'

like other Need for Speed games, is essentially a driving and racing game,
where the player selects one car and races against a time limit or other
racers to reach a destination. Police chases have once again been
integrated into certain racing sessions, in which the police employ
vehicles and tactics to stop the player's car and arrest the player,
like Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.
As players take control of faster cars and increasingly rely on nitrous
oxide speed boosts, the oxide meter now refills automatically for the
first time since its introduction in Underground, and driving sequences
become fast-paced and intense similar to the Burnout series.

The Black Edition features additional races, bonus cars and other
additional content.
