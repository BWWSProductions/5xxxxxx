This was recorded from Indonesian Free To Air TV and had
at breaks in between each round.

I'm looking for HDTV HBO PPV version"
,brown13pride69,2009-09-20T21:40Z,"Video and audio quality are good. It's very watchable. Downloaded at full speed. Airfrancisco is not lying about the breaks. They are cut out of each round. That kind of blows, but it is the best copy out there as of now. Thanks AiTB for the upload."
,w4st3d,2009-09-21T04:54Z,"lame ads throughout, cut out breaks, no interviews, didn't have marquez's intro ...but it's watchable for sure, sound and picture is good.  great fight!"
