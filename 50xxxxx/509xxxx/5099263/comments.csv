Anyone see today's Rush?  Sept 24th?"
[T],Quazza,2009-09-25T05:00Z,Rush was doing the Jay Leno show so he had Mark Stein filling in for him...probably why it isn't up
,ZERO_BS,2009-09-26T00:23Z,"Sometimes torrents won't show up in the search for hours. 

Right now Quazza'a Sept. 25th Glenn Beck show isn't listed either, but if you click his username, it's there. Same with Rush's 25th from Jwhitt. Not listed yet, but it's there...

I favorite their profiles instead of searching. Every day I just check my faves, and their lists are there, no need to search.

Thanks to both of you, BTW... I don't have time to listen live."
