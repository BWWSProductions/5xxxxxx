,spectatr,2010-01-15T10:56Z,"Great pilot episode, has alot of potential.  I love how it has humorous elements from frisky dingo, which I love.  DOWNLOAD IT NOW!"
,minorboy,2010-01-15T20:14Z,"This actually isn't the first episode. It's the second episode called ""Mole""."
,BingUser,2010-01-16T10:21Z,I agree. This is the second episode. This is the mole episode. Does anyone know where the first can be found.

,decarlos3,2010-02-10T16:25Z,when will you put up the REAL 1st episode?
,JMAN1156gamer,2010-03-08T16:08Z,"This is the first episode on hulu, but it is missing what I thought was the most funny joke in the first episode.  It was when archer is confronting the isis mainframe door.  It was on hulu but not in this episode."
,JMAN1156gamer,2010-03-08T16:11Z,"Also, I went on the official website, evidently hulu, and this torrent host, mixed up episode 1 and 2.  "
,Saki33,2010-12-31T17:04Z,"According to tv.com, Mole Hunt _is_ the first episode. To the best of my knowledge there was an unaired pilot, only available on the dvd. I believe this could be it:
