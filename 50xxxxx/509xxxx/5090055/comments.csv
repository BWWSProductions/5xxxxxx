,nate8it,2009-09-16T02:50Z,to answer my own question;  I just read that ALL custom ipsws made w/ pwnagetool for 3.1 lack the baseband update so hacktivation just means that you can use unlocked sim while restoring. Thank you for uploading
,shein87,2009-09-16T13:57Z,That is true. The baseband will not be affected by this custom. It is made with the help of the Pwnagetool for mac. Hacktivation means that you can use a non-approved sim card and then install ultrasn0w.
