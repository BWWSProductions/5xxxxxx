,Gaastra_NAC,2009-09-28T14:08Z,I don't know why but the game lags for me too and my pc specification are good enough for this game.
,NotSober,2009-09-28T16:58Z,"laggy here aswell, its ok if you turn all the gfx down to low."
,lynozius,2009-10-05T06:50Z,"Greetings,

Can you provide a valid one please?
Thanks "
,Lennejo,2009-10-08T22:47Z,"@lynozius - Serial is OK, but you should disconnect from internet before running the game."
,Eltiron72,2009-10-09T15:45Z,"KaOs rips always works perfectly. Thx, dudez!"
,bwmcmaste,2009-10-23T06:57Z,"This massive lag makes the game unplayable. This is not a problem with my computer's performance: There is something wrong with the game itself.

It seems that the game starts to choke up every five or ten seconds and then it goes back to normal."
,jdawson8761,2009-10-23T22:20Z,"Lol, I'm guessing I'm one of the lucky bastards, NO LAG AT ALL!  W00t!"
,SirDigbyChickenCaeser,2009-10-25T02:19Z,"Followed the instructions and it all works fine for me, I don't get any lag in the game either. Though it is pretty graphics intensive, got a 4850 and I have to put it on mostly low graphics settings for it to run smoothly."
,yyywww111,2009-10-25T13:09Z,"The in-game radio doesn't work. It worked in the demo but not here, is it a bug or was something in an audio file edited?

Any help would be appreciated"

,11tarot33,2009-10-26T13:08Z,"Well, for people who have problem with lag...

First of all, this game don't use high specs. But, you need to move all of your things in game on LOW. So, if that still don't fix the problem, try to download patch, and than to do the sam thing..."
,Vincent8,2009-10-29T00:47Z,"Only one problem with this one - no music, no radio, no voice on the guy speaking in the tutorial. Music only in main menu."
,Vincent8,2009-10-29T04:23Z,"I just downloaded Vitality version now instead, works fine, music works, no lag etc."
,ogipower,2009-10-30T17:14Z,":( :( :( 
I download a Patch and the game is not lagging but now i cant see a buildings .... please help .... "
,mr1black,2009-11-04T09:52Z,"Yet another feedback of radio not working, lagging, etc.
If you uninstall this version and try to install vitallity, autostart function will show as something is allready installed, but just go to setup, install anew and everithing works fine."
,makka432,2009-11-05T11:26Z,"If you're experiencing lag you have to give the game itself at least 10 minutes to run, during this it will lag a bit but eventually it will go away.

If anyone finds a way to get the radio working then please let us know. Thanks.
"
,Tanks101,2009-11-27T05:06Z,The serial number provided stopped working.
,ismellfunny67,2009-11-29T02:42Z,"No lag here, but im running a quad core. Works great."
,Brotherhawk,2009-11-30T01:40Z,"i cant get the key to work, i put it in and it goes logging in, then tells me its wrong."
,D-Ice1993,2009-12-02T05:51Z,"If I download this, will it install on my Mac?

Stupid question I know, but I downloaded the Sims 3 for my mac, and apparently the torrent could be opened on both Mac and Windows...so just thought it'd be worth asking. "
,darkhunt333,2009-12-06T10:53Z,"Only the Kaos copy experiences horrid lagg.  You will also run into problems when installing new patches.  E.g crashing on every save.   

  I recommend avoiding this 1."
,Imoen7788,2009-12-16T16:02Z,Working perfectly! Thanks!
