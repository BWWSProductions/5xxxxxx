Creation vs Evolution:

The war between creationists and evolutionists has been going for more than 150 years since the publication of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859. The latest discoveries of the genetic code in the DNA should have settled the controversy by helping in defeating the evolution theory. However, the creationists are burdened by the absurdity of the biblical account of creation, and the belief in a universal deluge and a young universe.

The creationists â€“ who believe in the Bible â€“ have to defend the undefendable and explain the unexplainable. This resulted in a stalemate between the two sides.

This upload adds another dimension to the controversy between creationism and evolutionism by including the Islamic view to this issue. The Islamic view is basically a creationist view but based on the Qur'anic view about creation.
