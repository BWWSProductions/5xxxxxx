Evolution by natural selection is a scientific theory with a very solid experimental support; the views put forth by Christian and Islamic fundamentalists are just their own particular superstitions, which are easily discarded as such by scientific inquiry."

Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design

""This is the definitive work on modern creationism, an exhaustively detailed and compelling exposure of the attempt--by the well-known process in nature called by biologists ""aggressive mimicry""--to corrupt science in the service of sectarian religion. In the process, the book explores the larger and seemingly endless struggle between religion-based tribal values and science-based universal values.""--Edward O. Wilson, University Research Professor, Emeritus, Harvard University

Anyone who values science and the benefits of life in an enlightened society should know about the Wedge's political, cultural, and religious ambitions.

Doubting Darwin: Creationist Designs on Evolution

""For those who would fear a return to the Middle Ages, this is the best critique of Intelligent Design available""  - William Wimsatt, University of Chicago"

[T],moman73,2009-09-25T14:45Z,"The upload contains 52 titles and its objective to invite people to look into the arguements of the different side. The Islamic view is a fresh dimension into this controversy.

It seems, however, that some people are follower of the Darwinian religion, and have closed their minds."
,Hails592,2009-09-25T15:08Z,"ahhh, its bollox. we evolved, same way as everything else.. the bible is just some story that someone came up with thousands of years ago, most likely to keep the human race (at the time) sane, to make us believe that there is something better on the other side (suppposidly). when your dead your dead, thats it. everything on this planet is an animal, including us. sooo if humans can go to so called ""heaven"" why cant cats, dogs, horses and other forms of life go there too? its all life no matter what shape or form. life is the greatest gift of them all so LIVE!!

,maddruid,2009-09-26T02:35Z,"Dumbass.  Saying ""Darwinism"" or ""Evolutionism"" is a religion is like saying ""Gravityism"" is a religion.  I don't see many people complaining about how the scientitific community is perpetrating a conspiracy to block the Islamic and Christian theory of Geocentricity or the Flat-Earth. That's because only an idiot would do so. I can't fathom why people have a problem with the theory of evolution.  It is as proven as gravity. Evolution is fact.  The bible and the Quran are stories."
,Blodhosta,2009-10-04T01:09Z,"I think what moman73 is trying to do with the words ""darwinian religion"" is pointing out the anti-scientific mentality of holding Darwin's theory as dogma. In fact, to some extent the theory of evolution AS DARWIN FORMULATED IT seem to be wrong because it says that the genetic structure is unchanging other than by mutations in reproduction, while epigenetics suggest that the genes are to some extent molded by behaviour of the organism (in a way lamarckism wasn't that far off, eh?). Matt Ridley wrote a pretty good book about this in 2003, called ""Nature via Nurture"". I think it's still widely available as audiobook on the Internet.

Two quotes by Bertrand Russell comes to mind:
""What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the will to find out, which is the exact opposite.""
When asked if he was prepared to die for his beliefes:""Of course not. After all I could be wrong."""
,Blodhosta,2009-10-05T15:32Z,"Ps. In reading my previous post; don't put too much emphasis on the reference to lamarkism. I didn't mean to sort of claim Chevalier de la Marck to epigenetics (to me personally it's not quite clear what Darwin said about the inheritance of acquired charachteristics). My point is simply that thinking too much of the conflict between ID and evolution tends to make people very uneasy with the reworking of details within the theory of evolution and thus inhibit progress within the theory (note that evolution and the theory of it are two different things). The theory is a simpel and ""intellectually accessable"" one, and many people seem comfortable with just adopting it and hold it for true, but they then hold on to it in a dogmatic way because of the fear of giving room to ID. This I think is unfortunate because it makes evolution in to something it is not, namely a counterweight - with ID on one side and evolution on the other. Evolution and ID are expressions of two different ways of comming to conclusions, namely the so-called scientific method on the one hand and whichever other method on the other.
Saying that the theory of evolution to the fullest extent possible today is based on scientific research is completely beside the point. The point is that Creationism is not, and holding the theory of evoultion for a theory in progress and always under justified attack instead of holding it for undisputable and conclusive in all aspects doesn't make Creationism any less of a mistake.

The fear of ID has made even people who claim to cling to ""reason"" make the old thought-error of saying (in practice if not in words) ""since you are wrong and I disagree with you, I am right"". What happened to the good oldfashion pleasure of finding things out instead of arguing that you are already correct? Freethought is a journey, not a destination."

Thanks again.

@ Blodhosta:
Your points are well made...
I couldn't have said it better."
,nailrott,2011-01-10T13:56Z,"lol what is the point of putting the koranic and biblical views along side science.
you will not get anyone converting to islam while slandering another archaic religion that would have been taught to your parents lol
you farce intellectuals talk big words like epigentics, which means, for your clarification, the different level of expression of genetic information depending on the environment an organism is in. 
so what is this torrent for? the misguided or those seeking the truth yet you want to keep your 'brothers and sisters' in ignorance, whilst slandering people like dawkins and darwin whom individually have scientifically found and taught greater truth than your sheikh, pope, imam, pundit and prophet.
harun yahya is a quack making money of your sorry asses with non science that you guys put happily down your throat: youtube dawkins vs harun yahya for some lols

religion and science could not be more opposite of eachother. stay the fuck out of science "
