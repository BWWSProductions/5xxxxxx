NOTE:

Sorry for the mix up, guys. I had a weird file issue on my computer and had to reissue the torrent. All is well now, though! Sorry if any of you have to re-DL this.!

Description:



Mike Dignam's AMAZING album, World of Our Own.  

 
"My First Review (New Steps promotions)

Having seen Mike Dignam play not only live, but also simply jamming on the tour bus or busking in Brighton, it is clear to say that Mike is especially talented and what is most refreshing is that he breaks the mould of the stereotypical depressed teenage singer songwriter. Instead of songs being about love and loss, Mike embraces the here and now; he looks to the future and sings about aspiration and dreams. This attribute is admirable and make you appreciate his songs more. Dignam has an eclectic collection of songs which musically are superb and blend beautifully with his vocal talent. I would put Mike Dignam along side artists such as John Mayer and Newton Faulkner and it would be fair to say he is Preston's own Jack Johnson he is truly a force to be reckoned with, and without a doubt a bright young star to be watched with open eyes."
