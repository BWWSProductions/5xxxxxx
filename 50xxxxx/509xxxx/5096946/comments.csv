,darklovetoy,2009-11-08T07:15Z,"The patch does work, overide the rld.dll and shift.exe files then run the SHIFTPCPATCHV1_EU.exe file, it worked for me. My problem is this, I installed the game, patches, etc... but my cars don't rotate in visual and car lot and where ever else they're supposed to rotate, the funny thing is when I first installed the game everything was fine. I turned off the game and when I turned it on again, the rotation didn't work, when I try to install visuals on my car it takes forever to switch the dialog box that states the side the visual is supposed to go on and the car doesn't move. Also when I attempted to change the paint colour on a vehicle the game shut down. what do I do? is anyone else encountering this problem?"
