,ThaPyratBay,2011-06-17T19:06Z,"For a single, ""When the Sun Goes Down"" is a good song to listen to... once in a while though. It's not one of those songs you'll be listening to constantly until it gets worn out. It is one of those songs you'll listen to occasionally until it Does get sort of annoying."
