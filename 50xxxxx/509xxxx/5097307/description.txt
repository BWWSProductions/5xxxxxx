I suffered long and hard for 17 days downloading this from that crappy emule/edonkey network. It was nowhere to be found on any torrent site I looked on.

If you love the film, like I think you will, head over to his dirttrackproductions.com and buy a copy, he's a small independent filmmaker and deserves our help to keep making great movies. He's got a new movie out as well, One Crazy Ride, also looks like a great film.

Riding Solo... is a film about filmmaker Gaurav Jani's solo motorcycle journey from Mumbai to one of the remotest places in the world, the Changthang Plateau.
