In the past few years he has gone from strength to strength working with the likes of Tom Church, Chrizzo (Lyfe Jenning's producers) and D-Boy/Synergy Music (who has produced for Estelle) to name but a few, as well as himself penning and producing several tracks for other artists both here and abroad. He has also performed as supporting artist for JLS, as they toured the north of England and supporting artist for Lemar.

Jaycee writes:
â€œThe track was actually written after a conversation I had about a real person. I tend to draw inspiration from real situations whenever Iâ€™m writing or at least think about how I would feel if I was put in that situation. It gives a sense of authenticity to the listener that they might not KNOW, but you can almost feel it like a 6th sense.
I came up on the concept just through the word, â€œeverythingâ€ â€¦ being like literally 100% of what someone would want in a person. We all have been with people who are cool, you get along just great, but theyâ€™re not â€œeverythingâ€â€¦â€
