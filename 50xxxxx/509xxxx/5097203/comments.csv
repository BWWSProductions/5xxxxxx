,possm88,2011-01-17T04:34Z,"You got a bunch of  great torrents on here and I love the message, but I gotta say take Noam Chomsky's work with a grain of salt. He and Naomi Klein are mislead when it comes to their accusations of who is responsible for the problems they point out. They have a good message when it comes to the problems of our country. But when it comes to accusations and solutions they are politically incompetent. Go look up Milton Friedman for yourself and then you will understand how false their information is. Milton Friedman would have ended Kleins career in the first minute of a debate between them. Thanks for the uploads though! But please go to Utube and watch all of Friedmans videos."
