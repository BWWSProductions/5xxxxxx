,Squashi.b,2009-09-27T22:12Z,"Such a cool movie that really does whip you up into a emotional frienzy about the effect of taking drugs in general..........

if you have not seen it, you have got to wat it . "
,Jack_Raiden,2009-09-28T16:42Z,"One of the finest films ever made, from dir. Aronofsky. A must-own, esp. on Blu-ray for less than $15 (Amazon)."
,TommyBlade2018,2009-10-11T00:18Z,Thanks King
,snowbirds,2009-11-17T02:57Z,the only movie about drugs that i've ever seen that didn't make me want to go out and do drugs afterwards...
,snowbirds,2009-12-03T23:58Z,"i've never seen the audio file seperated from the video file before.  

i have no idea how to get them to play together...

I'm going to have to toss this one and DL an avi.

thanks for the up though.  the video looks super sharp..."
,trakerman,2009-12-20T03:03Z,"thanks man, Very god quality, Keep working !"
,Incamal,2010-01-23T14:31Z,"This is what I call ""Real Quality""!
I believe that secret_myth is the most professional Ripper in the world of torrent!
The video size is always around 2 GiB, but movies you love deserve to be watched in secret_myth version!
Thanx secret_myth, undoubtedly my No 1. Uploader!"
,HDMI_GUY,2010-02-14T17:04Z,"Using Computer Hi Def Out to 46 inch screen
10+ all arouund & fills entire screen (no pixalation)
Thank You!"
,Aximized,2010-03-03T21:08Z,"Ridiculously good quality.  I love this movie and ordinarily I would look for the 1080p version that is out there.  But that one weighs in over 9.6GB, and this is one is just so damn good already at over 8GB less that I just don't see the point in bothering.  SecretMyth is definitely the aXXo of the Bluray generation and I hope the releases continue to come -- there are none better."
,AyoubMuh,2010-03-19T20:59Z,Thanks man
,BurtAlert,2010-03-21T19:33Z,This is an amazing movie. Thank you for yet another excellent torrent secret_myth!

,as14ever,2010-07-03T19:39Z,"Movie request to any one that can do it. I have a request for some very hard movies to find as mpeg4 BRRip H264 AAC3 in resolutions: 1280x544 or 1280x720 or even 1920x1080p

The Movies are: Appleseed 2004 
Tron 1982
Brazil 1985
Naked Lunch 1991
Conan the Barbarian 1982
Conan the Destroyer 1984
The Dark Crystal 1982
King Kong 1976
The Secret of NIMH 1982
Spike Lee School Daze 1988
Spike Lee Mo Better Blues 1990

If any one can find these movies in the format mentioned above, or can create them in the same quality as secret_myth I would be very appreciative and can maybe work on some type of compensation if needed.

Let me know at firstliight@yahoo.com "
