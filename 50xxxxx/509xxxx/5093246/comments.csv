A. If YOU don't seed we can't help you"
,elecor,2009-09-19T12:44Z,"please:

language?
subtitles?
pal or ntsc?
thanks"
,white_arcades,2009-09-19T21:53Z,"cmphoto - not sure why its appearing unseeded on PB. I am seeding and i can see its being uploaded by users in my utorrent. I even checked the box to prioritise seeding over downloads but it didn't make any difference. For some reason in my completed torrents the numbers of seeds and leechers only ever appear in brackets, never outside the brackets - does anyone know why this is and how i can solve it?
I know the uploads are working because i have 4 seeds overnight on one of my smaller torrents"
,white_arcades,2009-09-19T21:55Z,"elecor - sorry for this omission. The DVD is in PAL, unfortunately there are no subs and the audio is English only. I don't think it was ever intended as an international release."
,dougaldog2002,2009-09-26T01:50Z,"According to your trackers. there have been zero completed downloads. In fact, everyone that's attempting seems to be stuck at 11.7%. 

It's a shame if we miss out on this rare DVD, (I tried to get one when it was first released but they refused to ship it to Canada), so could you please recheck and/or reseed?

Cheers"
,dougaldog2002,2009-09-26T01:51Z,"EEEEK! No sooner than I type that a seeder appears!

Thanks!"
,rahsoft,2009-10-19T06:33Z,"seems TPB can't DL this torrent.
Anyone know of alternative site that I can get this torrent from ?
thanks"
,rahsoft,2009-10-20T10:13Z,"Hi all
finally got the torrent,
but as everyone can see, seeding is very bad with one seeder only seeding on an irregular basis. Once a new part comes in there is a flurry of activity for every other torrent to catch up. then it goes quiet because every leecher is at the same percentage of Download level.


to the one seeder, you need to leave the seeding on all the time until at least one other seeder is created and uploading( not hit and run ). the current situation will only kill the torrent."
,dougaldog2002,2009-10-21T17:47Z,I gave up on this yesterday after 30 days of constant D/Ling and hitting less than 40% with no hope in sight. I'm glad to see someone's finally completed a download and will start downloading again later. Will seed 5:1 once completed.

Are you going to bother to seed this properly or not ?
I noticed that a number of people have appeared to given up.

so far, you really wasted other peoples time.
I think you will find all your torrents labelled as time waster."
,white_arcades,2009-10-24T21:12Z,"Rahsoft, a few points if I may-

1. Try not to get so upset (its only a torrent)

2. If you don't get what you want, when you want, try to take it silently on the chin (that's what dignified people do)

3. Stop wasting your time leaving pointless messages against my other torrents calling me a TIME WASTER (Successful uploaders are likely to think you're an imbecile)

4. Learn the art of tact (people are more likely to oblige you)

5. Why not take the time to actually upload something yourself instead of complaining about the length of time it takes for the crumbs to fall from my table? YOU HAVE ZERO UPLOADS

,houghbong,2009-10-26T12:51Z,"I thank you persoanlly for sticking with this upload, well worth the wait, I am a lifelong OMD fan so have a great affection for your efforts. It is a shame others cannot share my enthusiasm.
As for 5:1? Please do, and a dvd cover if at all possible.
Thank you for all your efforts mate, 100% respect."
,dougaldog2002,2009-10-26T14:24Z,"Yeah, despite my impatience I really appreciate this U/L, like I said earlier, I tried to buy it from the OMD website when it was released but they wouldn't ship it outside of the UK!

Glad you like the small collection I made. ""The Taverner Tape"" is rather interesting. Despite being low quality (the original source was a low quality cassette from '78-'79-ish) it's interesting to here a band right at the dawn of their career before all the fame and BS got to them.

Cheers!"
