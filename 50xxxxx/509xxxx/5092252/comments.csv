,rohagymeg,2009-09-18T19:29Z,Uploader fucked up the title that'S why i couldn't find this earlier
[V],bubanee,2009-09-18T20:47Z,"easy answer to that.. it wouldn fit..
and if you had brains you would look at typing the artist name and looking at the last few torrents..
common sense"
,rohagymeg,2009-09-19T00:44Z,Yes I did that then. Thank you for uploading it to tpb!
[V],bubanee,2009-09-19T01:59Z,"welcome, cheers!"
,martian_neighbour,2009-09-19T02:07Z,"Thank you so much for the upload!. Love to see the new Alice in Chains. Jerry Cantrell is the main force of the band, he writes most of the songs and its lyrics. It's not 50/50 between Jerry and Layne. Layne is just a awesome vocalist with a pretty face, no offense. Loot at Mad Season, it fucking sucks.

The singer is pretty good though, but nothing to Layne."
,AJ78910,2009-09-19T05:50Z,"martian neighbor, layne wrote some songs like hate to feel. and mad season was good! but whether he wrote that much or not, i think he was a better singer than this new guy. the music is still good though. jerry is the driving force. "
,gared111,2009-09-19T07:23Z,"Deal holy jesus, bless this heavenly angel for posting the new AIC cd before it's even released....LOL

,VonNegga,2009-09-30T20:36Z,"The uploader apparently thought this information to be top secret, but these mp3s are VBR with an average bitrate of about 275kbps across the entire album.  You should also be aware they were encoded with LAME 3.97 - a version about 2 years older than the newest - 3.98.2."
