[T],dkent4000,2009-09-17T15:46Z,"@the4thgod
I warned you before, that if you keep commenting torrents saying it's a virus when it's not that you will be banned. Now you've gone and done it again... to the same torrent.

Now you will be BANNED asshole. Can't abide by the rules? - Then you don't belong here on TPB.

Have a nice day! :)"

,Tcip,2009-09-20T04:01Z,"dkent4000 - There is some humor in infected files to. Like when they force to install porn toolbars etc :P

But, the best shit is clean like this one :) And btw, Matrix is the best! :$"

[T],dkent4000,2009-09-29T07:26Z,"I just found out ANOTHER neat thing about this screensaver... if you click on ""Display Properties"" (Screensaver/Desktop settings), click on the ""Settings"" button and you can modify the screensaver... allowing you to change the text, the speed and more! =D"

,dercas,2009-12-07T12:35Z,"If something is ""Heuristic"" is ""looks"" like something that looks like a virus.  The majority of the time it's simply because of the way the file(s) is (are) packed and is nothing to worry about."
