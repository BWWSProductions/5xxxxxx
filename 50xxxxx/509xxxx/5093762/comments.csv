@Meedina
There is no virus."
,Mitch_Bainwol,2009-11-02T08:27Z,"Bad news. Although CPUs since the dual processor Pentiums (and possibly even Celerons) are x64 machines, Magic ISO & Power ISO & Ultra ISO do not run under XP x64.

I'm trying to open a damn "".isz"" file from a torrent, and they all blow up with a DEP exception.

That means they tried to execute program code from a data area. I know how the link editor works and that most buffer overflow hacks try to execute off of the stack, and so I'm not about to allow a DEP violator to execute. It's not even obvious if I can disable DEP protection.

WinISO runs, but doesn't know what "".isz"" is."

,northernangel1,2010-03-19T22:37Z,Awsome up thank you.
,skoobiedu,2010-04-25T01:44Z,"The apps in this torrent are out-dated.

Current versions are as follows:

* MagicISO Maker 5.5.281

* PowerISO 4.7

* UltraISO 9.3.6.2750

* WinISO 5.3 (the only up-to-date app)

As for some of the apps not running under a 64-bit OS, they all run perfectly.

Personally, UltraISO is the only image editor I need, especially since it can handle .UIF files (no more MagicISO). I use ImgBurn for burning, UltraISO for editing, and DAEMON Tools for virtual optical drives."
