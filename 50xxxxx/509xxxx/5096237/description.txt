Colour Revoltâ€™s members first played together while they were high school students at Jackson Academy in Jackson, MS under the name Foxxe, then changing to Fletcher and releasing a full length entitled â€œFriends Donâ€™t Speakâ€. They then moved on to become college students at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi. They take their current name from Edwin Abbottâ€™s mathematical novel, Flatland.
