I went to this concert on August 24, 2009 in Gilford, NH, at the Meadowbrook U.S. Cellular Pavilion, and got this CD. I figured I'd share it with you all, as it's extremely good.

2 discs at 192kbps. Cover art isn't real, I whipped it up so there wouldn't be a "blank album art" thing when you go to play it.
