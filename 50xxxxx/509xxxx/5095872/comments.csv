She only really goes for gold on Angels Cry and to some extent on I Want to know What Love Is. Up Out My Face, The Impossible, H.A.T.E.U and Angels Cry are standouts at first listen. I think a few more listens to the album will change my opinion on the rest of the songs, definitely a grower I reckon."
