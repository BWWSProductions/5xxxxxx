In early 2009, singer-songwriter The-Dream stated that he and Carey had already begun working on her next studio album: â€œI think itâ€™s about just writing an album that includes the focus of all the hits that sheâ€™s had. She canâ€™t take a loss; she has to do everything to the T. So itâ€™s basically like weâ€™re trying to make a greatest hits album without using the greatest hitsâ€. In February 2009, MySpace Music interviewed The-Dream, he revealed that he and Carey had finished seven songs for the album.

Carey revealed on May 20, 2009 that she was calling the album Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel because it was going to be â€œvery personal and dedicated to the fansâ€. She says that the reason she chose to use three images for the cover art is because â€œthere are a lot of different emotions and stories revealed on this albumâ€.
