First aired: 9/14/2009

Kerrylea and her husband Geoff have 2 houses, the first of which they have completely filled! The felt the best thing to do was to buy another home. But, now in order to sell one home, they need to empty it. Lauren's hoarding forces her boyfriend to sleep in the living room. If she cannot begin to deal with her hoarding problem, Will plans to leave her.

[T],keka_umans,2009-09-23T18:33Z,"good, its one of the ones i'm missing
any chance you got ""Jake & Shirly""  and/or ""Patty & Bill"""

""Patty/Bill"""
,Seanster,2009-09-25T18:59Z,"Just so we're all clear, ep 04 was actually Jake / Shirley : insane cat lady & retarded gay guy

Here's the episode list that matches how they actually aired:

01x01  	Jennifer & Ron / Jill : horrible food hoarding lady
01x02  	Linda / Steven : fat jobless guy in small filthy apartment 
01x03  	Tara / Betty : woman in apartment / pair living in hotel (husband banned from house)
01x04  	Jake / Shirley : insane cat lady & retarded gay guy
01x05		Kerrylea / Lauren : two house bitch
01x06  	Patty/Bill : the 'tool' guy / idiots w/ children taken away
01x07  	Paul / Missy & Alex - scrap cars guy
(not aired yet)
