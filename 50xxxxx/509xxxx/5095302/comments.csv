,gottit,2009-11-01T22:28Z,Any ideas on how to make the game able to find the saved games? seen others with the same problem but no one got a solution?
,Benvox2,2009-11-26T08:53Z,"Yea having same problem, the game cant seem to find the save files evan tho they are in the correct places, Anyone know whats going on??"
,AgentBuckwald,2009-12-06T06:51Z,"Do not Waste your time with this shitty piece of crap game. its nothing like the original game due to the fact the the probability factor of the supposed ""dice rolls"" tend to favor the AI opponent 90 percent of the time. the rest of the game is spent trying to organize your team back together after half of them are scattered about the field due to a faulty and misconcieving user interface. FUCK THIS BROKEN PIECE OF SHIT"
