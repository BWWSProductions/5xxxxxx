,jigsaw695,2009-10-12T01:38Z,Good torrent.Will seed for awhile
,stevecureboi,2009-12-05T15:08Z,"alternatively, you can go to http://www.cureconnections.com & download these (faster) with all the artwork too (& much much more).
@mav140991. Would be nice if you actually quoted the source of these instead of catching all the praise yourself.
:o/

For info. These compilations are put together by the members of cureconnections, who also created the artwork for them.
They are by no means rare. They are part of our 20th anniversary event. You can come along & download virtually every show from the Prayer tour at http://www.cureconnections.com
See you there"
