,Mahnas_92,2010-06-22T23:47Z,"@vikkg: You need serial/crack.
Use http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5585701/Windows_7_RemoveWAT_v2.2.5.2
Anb beware of ""Update for Windows 7"" where in the description it tell you this makes Windows Activation Tool (WAT) better.
@Cpatrik08: If you have a decent torrent-client, e.g. Âľtorrent, you will be promted to choose files the torrent contains. this torrents seems to contain 6 files, (I guess one iso for every version of W7, and maybe some info-file)"
