,rjames,2009-09-19T12:07Z,what is this DVDSCR? Anyone?

It's really not important. eztv is a trustworthy source and it's always top quality, no cams and stuff like that. If you don't know it eztv is all about tv series and nothing else, except april fools day, then they're all about sports lol

But to answer your question I guess it's DVD quality?"
,cannabis1,2009-09-19T14:13Z,Thank you for this great series! I can not wait to start watching! THANX & PLEASE SEED!!!
,margolik,2009-09-19T23:43Z,"eztv has nothing to do with the quality/source. all they do is download from top sites and seed here.

i'd assume this is a DVDSCR, as that's what the title indicates.

it would be nice if eztv would include the repack reason in the torrent information though."
