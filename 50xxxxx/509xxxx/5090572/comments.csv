,bully_h,2010-05-23T02:25Z,Yes its Censored!
,polkafrenzy,2010-06-30T06:46Z,Well I'm sure I'm gonna love it cause its Miike but I hate buying movies before I get to watch them at least once. I refuse to watched censored anything.
,Trickee,2011-02-19T11:33Z,"As far as I know, there is no ""uncensored"" version of this movie. It is Japanese, and they are known for censoring out the bushy parts... if you know what I mean."
,nihonsuki,2011-10-29T21:57Z,"Miike seems to enjoy taking the piss out of the Japanese censorship laws, as much in this film as any of his others.  This is a brilliant, deeply disquieting and often monstrously funny film, and the concept of censorship hardly applies.  If you're looking for titillation you're looking at the wrong film."
,Ravensbane,2012-03-03T08:55Z,Did a bit of research and there is NO uncensored version. It was never released. So either watch this or don't.
