,adobo76,2009-09-24T14:22Z,This is the first torrent that offers a crack for 1.1 but I find it confusing to install.  I have not been able to successfully install it yet.
,Dumbbanus,2009-09-26T05:19Z,how do you install in what directory?
,Currentry,2009-09-28T00:21Z,"For those with the grapple bugs:

Play around with the values on in DefaultGame.ini

For example to get up to the vent (without using a grapple at all!)

Try having the values set at:

[Engine.WorldInfo]
DefaultGravityZ=-2.0
RBPhysicsGravityScaling=-0.5

Originally it is:
[Engine.WorldInfo]
DefaultGravityZ=-1000.0
RBPhysicsGravityScaling=-1.5"
,Currentry,2009-09-28T00:25Z,"best of all, 

-there is no need for any patch at all!
-no need to restart the game from the beginning!
-continue with your bugged save game as nothing happened.

Just quit the game and return the values to how they normally are as soon as you're through the vent :)"
,rayking,2009-09-30T23:48Z,"after runnung unpack.bat symantic quarantined ""whysosrs.dll"" as a trojan horse."
,rayking,2009-09-30T23:50Z,And the game quit working.
,rayking,2009-10-01T09:13Z,correction on my previous comments: it's a false positive and the update needs the DLL to run. works fine now.
,Nolumbus,2009-10-04T04:41Z,"it installs the patch ok, but the Xlive acount ask for a serial number of the game, what to do?"
,rayking,2009-10-17T06:15Z,this screwed up my computer
,TheUnderlost,2009-11-12T14:22Z,Does it enable PhysX for this game??
,shiv_01,2009-11-22T09:48Z,"WTF!!!

,godzook1,2009-12-06T23:08Z,"I'm very confused with all the solutions that everyone is posting, should i still copy the crack that came with the RELOADED version even if i'm using this one? What patches/updates do i need? I've seen 3 or 4 different ways to get this to work, someone please clarify."
,NotSober,2009-12-11T02:08Z,"lol, easy way is this, download kaos batman install it with install.exe to the default folder, wait till black box it done, download this and do the same. thats it, if u get asked for a serial open an offline account. it cant get any easier than that"

,coldkilla9,2010-02-05T02:00Z,"Is there ANYWAY to get past the Ivy area in the Botanical gardens? When you enter the Glasshouse, the Vines are invisible. Turning OFF gravity does work for this area - however Ivy's room is MISSING and the level doesn't load. 

Restarting the game is a HUGE gamble... I mean spending another 10 hours getting back there just in the 'hopes' of it working seems too extreme. "
,skeelol,2010-02-07T01:18Z,"Currentry's trick works great for grapple glitch. I got stuck in batcave, editted .ini file to get rid of gravity, jumped off the bridge then kept pressing space to skidaddle up to the air vent. Get to next save point and then put .ini file back the way it was and cha-ching."
,Xan0x,2010-02-19T16:20Z,The reg file doesnt help shit it keeps asking for a profile and then asks for serial
,krinsmnite,2010-03-22T16:26Z,Thanks loverboy for telling us how to make a local account. I felt like a n00b for not realizing how to do it. 
,RR92,2010-05-22T06:44Z,"Worked without a hitch. To enable the save function, just install the Games for Windows Live client and create a local/offline profile at the game title screen when the client window appears.

Thank you for the upload."

,Batmanfan202,2010-07-10T04:52Z,Does this give corrupt saves?
,spiegelnder,2010-12-25T01:43Z,"I was trying for hours to make this game work, browsing countless comments at the torrents here trying to solve the tangled situation, following instructions, trying this and that... And in the end, it all amounts to one big mess and to no avail at all, much to my exasperation!!
Not only has it proven a huge problem to make it even launch, but from the comments it seems to have a bunch of bugs and other issues too.
I spent hours downloading it, and hours trying to make it work and all that for nothing. How did some people manage it...I wonder. 
Eventually I removed it. To hell with it."
,LawfulCopter,2011-01-28T00:57Z,"I installed it and everything, but I cannot figure out how to make an offline Games for Windows account so I can actually play...."
