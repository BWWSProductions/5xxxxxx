,dj_mm,2009-09-26T15:16Z,"Important remark: NEVER use ZoneAlarm when you have avast! antivirus installed or vice versa. After 3 years of personal testing and experience ZoneAlarm still hasn't solved this issue. I like avast! antivirus because it's a strong protection on many levels, even for free. But just remember that ZoneAlarm is totally incompatible with avast! and using these 2 apps together (free or pro, doesn't matter) is begging for total system crash. I tried many times to mention this issue on several fora, but no one knows how to solve this incompatibility. I also contacted avast! website and zonealarm.com to warn them but they refuse to fix this issue, mostly don't even answer my questions. Poor support imho! In 2005 this problem was already known, and currently not solved yet. If anyone knows some advice how to solve this issue, please reply... thx."

Zone alarm is now blocking these keys so,Here's a fix i found. 
Enter license while your internet connection id OFF or disconnected, then do the following:

               (do not connect to the web until you've finished)

Make sure you unhide hidden folders. 
Boot up in safemode

Windows XP goto:
C:\Windows\system32\zllictbl.dat
right click 'properties' attributes click on 'read only' (leave hidden as is) apply > ok > re-boot 

Vista goto:
C:\ProgramData\CheckPoint\ZoneAlarm\zllictbl.dat
right click 'properties' attributes click on 'read only' (leave hidden as is) apply > ok > re-boot


It stops it from regestering and checking the key online. 
Mines been working fine for days now, license says 65532 days :)

Simply setting the 'Read Only' flag doesn't seem to work anymore, at least for me. After connecting back to the network and re-booting, ZoneAlarm reset the flag and updated zllictbl.dat. The license was then shown to be expired.



@ All

The procedure I followed to ensure the license remains active is this:

Note: Tested on Windows XP Pro and Windows 7 Ultimate

1) Install ZoneAlarm
2) Re-Boot your PC
3) Generate license and input when prompted
4) Re-Boot and enter safe mode
5) Login using an administrator account
6) Ensure hidden files are shown
7)

For Windows XP browse to c:\windows\system32

For Vista/Win7 browse to C:\ProgramData\CheckPoint\ZoneAlarm\

8) Right click the file 'zllictbl.dat' and select properties
9) Click on the security tab
10) For each user and group listed set 'write' access to deny
11) Reboot

You should now be able to update ZoneAlarm and reboot your PC without having to worry about the license expiring.

FYI: If the security tab isn't available you can still set permissions using the 'cacls' command from the command prompt. If requested I'll post a tutorial."
