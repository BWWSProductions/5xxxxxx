The year is 2021, and half of the Earth's population is suffering from the disease known as Nerve Attenuation Syndrome (NAS). Johnny, a mnemonic data courier, is hired to carry 320 gigabytes of crucial information (stolen from the nefarious Pharmakom corporation). Pursued by Yakuza agents and a crazed cyborg, Johnny must deliver the data to avoid death within twenty-four hours.
