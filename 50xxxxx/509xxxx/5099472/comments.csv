,egosavar,2010-01-25T21:08Z,"You do this for fun? Well, i say f..k your fun in the ass! This episode you presented has missing 30+ seconds! And when you say, ""Don't download it if you don't like it!"", i'll say, ""The damage is already done before i know some stupid encoder group named 'AMiGOS' don't know how to rip a tv show. Because i already downloaded before i knew it had missing the final seconds of the show.' 

You don't have to do this, you don't have to present a tv show here, when you obviously don't know how to do so! 

Don't download it, grab the CTU version. I hate morons who feel the need to make stupid attempts like this. "
