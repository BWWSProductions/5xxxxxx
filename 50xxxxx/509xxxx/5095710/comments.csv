,Foolmonkey,2009-09-24T06:48Z,oh god this movie fucked me up when i saw it at 5 years old LOL. gotta check this one out!
,The.Oracle,2009-09-24T09:05Z,Good Quality... Stupid movie... The baby is shown for like 3 seconds and that too at the end..
,Foolmonkey,2009-09-24T11:18Z,"Yea this one sucks balls. The original is way better. First of all, the baby was born normal, not a mutant. It seems it only turns mutant when it attacks. This movie is more suspense than it is horror. They never show the baby except for one goddamn second at the end. It's more disappointing than cloverfield was."
