[T],IndianChristian,2009-09-20T15:52Z,"""For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."" (Eph 6:12)

No points for guessing who is behind the persecution of christians and the burning and abusing of the Holy Bible."

,dougaldog2002,2009-09-21T13:28Z,"Godswallows, please explain how this doc is propaganda. I doubt you've downloaded it but even by the description how did you come to your conclusion?"
[V],Kuthumi,2009-09-21T18:10Z,Thank you for this interesting documentary. And thank you again for doing something you believe is right. Take no notice of those who dare not believe in anything.

[T],verifire,2009-09-24T16:10Z,"@ All you nay-sayers: Man, am I getting tired and embarrassed by your comments. Oh, you're so wise and insightful. Educated to the bone and really nice people to hang around with. Who wouldn't want to know your opinions on things you know nothing about? It shines so brightly through you well documented comments. I really wish I knew so much about flaming that you do, oh wise men of Babylon.. 

No.. Come to think of it, that area is yours and your alone. I dare not tread on such ground.. I'm not worthy, oh ye bringers of wisdom and truth to the Bible claim that ""all who wants to live god-fearing in Jesus Christ, shall be persecuted."" 

Thank you for once again confirming the Bible's message. Thank you, oh, thank you.."

thanx!

and do'nt pay attention to all the people who are so desperate to tell you what this film is about. i believe it's better to make up your OWN mind instead of lending other peoples opinions. "

,Tamarind777,2009-10-25T06:25Z,"Hey Indian Christian, I am very grateful for your uploads. They've really benefited me greatly. BTW, I am also an Indian Christian. Keep spreading the Word.

Hey, do you have anything on the different versions of the Bible? For example, like the history of the different versions and what manuscripts were used to translate them? Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, Alexandrian, etc? Or even something on which version is more accurate and so on. I personally like the KJV, but I'd like to see something on the myriads of versions out there.

God's continued blessings!"

,sandshreder,2009-12-22T19:58Z,"I love how atheists hide behind things like ""science is truth"". well unfortunately the science in the text books is not always accurate or true. in addition it is sometimes a complete lie. moreover any science that may contradict evolution is often left out of textbooks completely. There is a movement in the scientific community to hide anything that discredits evolution. Lets look at some facts...

evolutionists tell you that DNA mutates and we have these improvements in Biological functions.
the FACT is there has never been a mutation observed that was not harmful to a biological process or function.

Now ask yourself these questions...

How did natural selection develop (over millions of years) ears to hear with when life did not and could not know sound existed?

How did natural selection produce eyes when it could NOT know light existed?

How can the first Male and female sex organs develop in two different organisms at the same time AND work together for the first ever mating process? you want me to believe two similar organism just happened to evolve with two different sex organs that just happen to work together to create off spring?

Now I ask, who is really spreading ferry tales...

God Bless you all, I could go on for hours but atheists are not worth the time.

Jesus says dont throw pearls to pigs... so dont wast time with atheists"
