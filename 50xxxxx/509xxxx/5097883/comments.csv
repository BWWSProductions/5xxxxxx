[V],BOZX,2009-09-23T18:36Z,hay why u stopd uploadin.go onnnnn.....
,Sunseeker908,2009-09-23T19:10Z,"I'll download this for seeding help, but I would prefer to see this in an unrar'd format."
[V],BOZX,2009-09-23T19:16Z,"actually i askd ""educu"" why he stopped uploading his torrents.
and RARS i too dont like.but quite a time compelled.
njoy the speed and share as much as u can and let others njoy that speed too."
,maxxer2,2009-09-23T20:47Z,"Winrar says R75 is corrupt (unexpected end of archive.) So I cannot extract the rars. (Why use rar in the first place??)

This sucks. 8GB down the drain.

So do NOT download this crap."
[T],educu,2009-09-23T20:52Z,"BOZX	
I discouraged, but I intend to return soon."
,maxxer2,2009-09-23T20:55Z,Or just post a good .r75? Saves a new download... ;-)
,scarlanah,2009-09-24T01:17Z,R.75 confirmed to be bad... where is a good place to get it ??
,Sunseeker908,2009-09-24T02:14Z,"Yeah,  I got the same problem with .r75.  Even the size is off.

**** DO NOT DOWNLOAD ****"
,onegreatguy,2009-09-24T03:17Z,"BOZX, Why not just upload some of the par files?  If you made them.  That would solve it too."

,kakalos76,2009-09-25T11:09Z,CORRUPT rar......
,kakalos76,2009-09-25T11:09Z,"CORRUPT rar,,,,,??????"
,scarlanah,2009-09-26T01:00Z,".r75 is corrupt, follow the link above for that Rar fix... save the Rar fix in a seperate folder then copy it over after download completes. 
Video works fine afterwards"
,Sunseeker908,2009-09-26T03:41Z,@educu:  That would be fine if it wasn't a site that requires registration.  How about you post the file here.  
,juhle,2009-09-26T07:21Z,"The rarfix works!
Good sound and picture quality. Liked the movie a lot, thanks for the up."
,oxycodone,2009-09-26T22:47Z,i posted the rar fix here to make it easier for download  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5101386/Year_One_1080p_BluRay_x264-HD1080_BOZX_75_rar_fix
,willdrumz,2009-09-28T07:02Z,"Where the hell is the 720p version?!?!? I don't want to have to buy a mac pro just to play movies. 720p is the best for my setup and EVERY MOVIE EXCEPT THIS ONE IS AVAILABLE IN 720P MKV'S!!!! WHY is THIS one only available in 1080? 1080's play like crap, even in VLC. This is just a comedy movie. Save the 1080 shit for Star Trek or something. What a fucking wast of space. O.k. Thats my rant. Now give me my fucking 720p version of Year One. Thank you!"
,patrioticparadox,2009-10-07T04:20Z,@willdrumz ...  Or thank you BOZX for the great upload! Thank you for the 1080p! If you download please seed AT LEAST a 1.0 ratio. Thank you seeders.
