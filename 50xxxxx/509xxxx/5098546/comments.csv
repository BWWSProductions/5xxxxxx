,BigfootMSR,2009-11-13T08:27Z,"This Download is great, However, You have to convert them in order to burn them onto a DVD. It would be awsome if somebody could help me do that. I have tried several solutions online to convert them to no avail. "
,Hexentanz,2009-11-25T16:15Z,"Excuse me if this is a stupid question, but how do I use this? Can I just watch it in a program like mediaplayer or something, and which file do I click when I want to watch an episode? Sorry I haven't tried myself before asking, but I'm asking while it's downloading so I can cancel if I can't view it anyway :) Hope somebody sees this! Thanks"

Thanks."

,Hexentanz,2009-12-01T14:45Z,"Kidnasty: Okay, thanks!"
,k-372,2009-12-01T17:45Z,"OK folks... I've finally managed to download the missing 12.9% of this torrent... there is now 100% available!!!

I will seed for a while, for everyone else to finish... hopefully the rest of you will too."
