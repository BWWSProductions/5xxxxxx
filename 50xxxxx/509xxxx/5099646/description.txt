What to say abot Frank Zappa?

Just one his tought: Light is just a vibration of a note too. Everything is. You've got to keep that in mind.


A bootleg album, released by Frank Zappa  and also available as part of the Beat the Boots! box set. A two-CD set, it contains a Zappa concert performance in Paris on February 24, 1979. The sound quality is good, and the set list varies from oldies like "Brown Shoes Don't Make It" and early-'70s favorites like "Cosmik Debris" to current material like "Dancin' Fool." As such, it provides a good overview of Zappa's career. The album is also notable for containing "Dead Girls of London," a song Zappa had recently written for an LP he was producing for L. Shankar that is otherwise unreleased on any Zappa recording.
