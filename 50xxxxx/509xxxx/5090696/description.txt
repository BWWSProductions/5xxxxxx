Lydia Bjornlund, "Going Green"
Lucent Books | 2009 | ISBN: 1420501194 | 120 pages | PDF 

Young people today are inundated with information but
often lack the tools for understanding the complex issues
that stir public debate and dissension. The Hot Topics series
provides clear, balanced, and thoughtful examination of the
hot-button issues of the day. Carefully crafted narrative,
fully documented primary and secondary source quotations,
informative sidebars, and study questions all provide
excellent starting points for research and discussion. Full color
photographs, maps, and charts enhance all volumes in
the series.

The present book examines the issues surrounding the environment
and provides an overview of the topic.
Millions of different things live in our world. From the giant
blue whale to the tiny ant, from the tallest redwood trees
to the tiniest blade of grass, every living thing is dependent on
everything else. Going green is about remembering that the decisions
we make have an impact on the earth on which we live
and the other living things that live here.
