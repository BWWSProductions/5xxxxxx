Plot :Featuring Derek Hughes as the hapless John Doe, a

man who doesnâ€™t know where he came from, who canâ€™t

control his insatiable hunger for raw meat, much to the dismay

of everyone who rings the doorbell. That is, until he meets the

smart-ass grocery delivery girl Audie Bantam, played by

Tara Price, who falls head over heels in

love with him and fights to convince him heâ€™s not a werewolf.

Bloody murder, rollicking romance, and phenomenal comedic performances

by the sultry Christa Campbell, the legendary Rance Howard, and the

inimitable Richard Riehle, as well as an outrageously talented ensemble

cast of newcomers, Audie and The Wolf delivers a 70â€™s style, r

ed-hot operatic rock-and-roll score by composer Karl Preusser.
