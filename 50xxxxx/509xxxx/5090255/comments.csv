Now that he's dead, maybe somebody will cough up the missing ones ?
I'd really like to see ""Waking up in Reno"" with Billy Bob Thornton..."

,mikek241,2009-09-18T04:57Z,"HEY THANKS for this great upload
Except for some reason the movie Desperado is in the Father Hood folder
...can you please upload the actual movie Father Hood"
,primalclaws1974,2009-09-22T20:34Z,"Wow. Something wrong with your speed, BOZX? I can't even get 10k! I only took about half this torrent, and at 30 minutes not even .1%? I feel sorry for people that are going for this whole thing! It'll take a month!"
,primalclaws1974,2009-09-22T20:55Z,Less than a meg a minute? Why even post if this is all the upload strength you got? It's pathetic!
,primalclaws1974,2009-09-24T01:33Z,"This is the weirdest torrent I have ever seen! Starts out so slow you want to drop it, then today I was getting close to one megabit with something like 37 seeders. Now I am back down to 20k, with only ONE seeder, although TPB claims there's 50!"
[V],BOZX,2009-09-24T14:28Z,"may be u r not connected with many seeders that does'nt mean thy ar nt there.
Most of the public torrents tend to b slow.no exception."
,boogie_rhino,2009-10-23T21:33Z,"The Father Hood movie in this group is not the AKA Desparado with Patrick, it is the Antonio Banderass Desparado..  Still looking for that one too then."
