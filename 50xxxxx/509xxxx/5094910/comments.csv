I have it and have seen it. I prefere Barefoot gen. Please take a notice that I'm not the one who ""hates anime"". I love it That comment as indicated is from a guy at IMDB.

I'll post some more anime movies which I've never seen on torrent but along the time as there are others to appear first.

thanks again"
