Billy aka Dr. Horrible (Neil Patrick Harris)is a budding supervillain whose plans for world domination continually go awry. His two goals: getting accepted into the Evil League of Evil (ELE for short); and working up the guts to speak to his laundromat crush Penny (Felicia Day). The only thing standing in his way is Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion), Billy's superhero archnemesis. With one big score Billy could into the ELE and earn the respect for Penny , but only if he can keep her away from the dashing Captain Hammer...

"Exceptional dialog, music, humor, pathos...yes, one of those again! Whedon and crew are reshaping "television" into the 21st Century and hopefully will carry the "industry" along with them in their wake (I know...I'm mixing metaphors but what the hell!). I can't wait for the next episode (I pray one will follow)! 

Each of the main actors brings with them a unique "graphic novel" ambiance to the three-part episode. Nathan Fillion delivers just the right balance of likability and swarminess. Neil Patrick Harris brings an exquisite mix of illusion and reality - enough that we can touch his human side (and connect with it), while still laughing along with his illusory attempts at superhero-ness. And Felecia Day provides a perfect target of the two male leads' affections. The songwriting is catchy and endearing and the songs delivered with clarity and feeling.

For the past three days I have found myself unintentionally singing lines from the show as I drive, shop for groceries, shower, walk the dogs, cook dinner . . . you name it! They are that catchy!

You won't regret downloading and sitting through the 40 minutes of exceptional film-making! "--gormanme from imdb
