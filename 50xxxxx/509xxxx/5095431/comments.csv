,SuperMegaAwesome,2009-12-15T18:56Z,How do I turn off the subtitles?
,chaos913,2009-12-20T16:37Z,How do you change the subtitles?
,chaos913,2009-12-20T16:44Z,"scratch that last one, if figured it out."
[T],metalcore.,2010-01-26T02:10Z,haha one of my worst uploads (in quality of entertainment) ..yet one of the most popular....why am i not surprised lol
,Ult1matek1ll,2010-03-25T04:06Z,"This vid has some kind of audio playing over the audio of the movie very disruptive quality is fine but the ""commentary"" as i calls itself in the beginning is utterly obnoxious i do not recommend"
,crucifire,2010-12-14T18:38Z,"Metalcore, could you please comment on Ult1matek1ll's comment about the audio tracks?

Is the commentary hard-coded on the movie, or if I download just the movie and not the extras, I'll be fine?"
[T],metalcore.,2010-12-21T18:16Z,"@crucifire: There are 3 audio tracks contained in this package.

if you play the file in vlc, the normal audio track will play.

if you right click the vlc screen and go to where it says audio, slide over, you will be able to click on the 2nd audio track..which is the ""commentary the musical"" track. 

i also included a non-muxed (not combined to the video) audio track with the director and cast commentary ...Extra #1...you can mux this on as a 3rd audio track if youd like...or just leave it in the extras folder...or unclick it and not download it at all, this track should not play when you play the video, unless you specifically go into the extras folder and click it (at which time it will play the audio commentary track only)

either way, it's safe, i'm not sure what he's talking about....hope this helps!"
[T],metalcore.,2010-12-21T18:21Z,"to turn off the subtitles

 watching on vlc when you play the video, right click on the vlc screen and slide over where it says ""subtitles track"" and click ""disable"" to turn them off, or click on the language you would like to be shown, if you need them.

if you are not concerned about keeping the subtitles you can just delete the .sub and .idx file, they are the subtitle files."

,tunnelsunshine,2012-03-06T09:45Z,"audio is good, video seems fine enough. a 9 v 9 thanks."
