,R2/D2,2009-09-19T16:25Z,"Hi, shikari. Are you there? This is a great upload, but we've only got 3 % so far... At least I have."
,tawa72,2009-09-19T16:58Z,HALLO SEEEEED !!!!!!!!!!!
,shikari,2009-09-20T20:04Z,"Yes I am here :)  

Sorry, the power went out for most of a day a few days ago, they were upgrading the power lines in my area or something ..  weird and just bad timing.

Anyway, it's back seeding again now for a couple days and I see the majority of you are now up to like 10% or so.

I will seed this indefinitely but it would be great if lots of you could too, once you have it completed.  Thanks and enjoy!"
,tawa72,2009-09-29T17:28Z,"83,5%?"
,shikari,2009-10-01T01:47Z,"I see there are now 30 or so of you up to 96%!!  Wooot!

Keep seeding!"
,tawa72,2009-10-01T18:41Z,Seeder?
,tawa72,2009-10-01T20:27Z,When is next?
,cryptic_s,2009-12-25T14:15Z,What about the quality anyone??
,shikari,2009-12-30T19:15Z,This is a DVD image so it is exactly as good as the original DVD.
,dickchin,2010-12-08T07:12Z,"PLEASE SEED!  

I'm stuck moving at 0.7k, if that!"
