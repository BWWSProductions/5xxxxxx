They held back the Russian Juggernaut in a frozen Hell!

Russia attacked Finland in late November 1939. This film tells the story of a Finnish platoon of reservists from the municipality of Kauhava in the province of Pohjanmaa/Osttrobottnia who leave their homes and go to war. The film focuses on the farmer brothers Martti and Paavo Hakala.

Soldier that leaves the position.: Nothing but bad spots here, pal. 

Aatos Laitila: If it gets any colder we'll need dynamite to break up the cheese. 
Arvi Huhtala: Let Russian artillery do it for us.
