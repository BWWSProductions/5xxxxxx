,daveo76,2009-09-21T11:38Z,@ fonzbear2000: just download it from it official site. Surely before the trial ends there should be a working crack. I tried from different sources and I give the same error message. I don't know why people put fake cracks up for.

Have you replaced DVDFab.exe in c:\Programs\DVDFab6 with the crack, then applied the crack? 

Because I got it to work at the first attempt.

,Deathstryker,2009-09-25T00:23Z,I get the same error on Win 7 with this crack trying various file to mobile options. This crack needs work.
,Deathstryker,2009-09-25T00:29Z,I retract my previous comment. Apparently ChattChitto's release is using the old crack. this one works without the error.

,fredpc,2009-09-27T00:32Z,the error message seems to be in relation to 3d encoding and codec's ?.......are you trying to copy a 3d movie ? 
,fredpc,2009-09-27T00:48Z,does this error occur with all dvd's ?
,fredpc,2009-09-27T05:49Z,"the error that some people are getting seems to be in the crack?   I ran the app before applying the crack and it worked

after applying the crack i ran the app again and got the 

r6002 floating point support not loaded error 

I haven't compared the differences in files to see if it is related to that as yet"

thank you."
,Timewarptwo,2009-11-04T04:08Z,"Iv'e been using this download for sometime now. A few weeks ago I had a problem with Transformers 2. This download would not let me copy the movie. In order to copy the movie I used AnyDVD and Clone DVD both by slysoft. It did the trick. Something must have been left behind, I am guessing in the registry because after uninstalling Clone DVD & AnyDVD & rebooting the computer I am no longer able to use this torrent . I keep getting a RUNTIME ERROR whenever I apply the application to any movie. I am running windows 7 64bit. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. My best guess is that AnyDVD left something behind in the registry that is interferring with this torrent. The reason I say this is because whenever I use DVDFab and Anydvd was running in the background a pop-up would appear asking me to turn off AnyDVD. I uninstalled ANYdvd.  "
,Timewarptwo,2009-11-04T04:12Z,"I forgot to mention that I uninstalled this torrent and reinstalled it with no luck. I also tried to install: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5096503/DVDFab_Platinum_v6.0.7.0_Final___Crack_By_ChattChitto

still with no luck"
,Timewarptwo,2009-11-04T04:15Z,"I made a mistake, The error I was receiving in Dvd Fab  was r6002 floating point support not loaded error not Runtime Error. "
