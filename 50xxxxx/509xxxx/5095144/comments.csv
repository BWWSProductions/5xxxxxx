,Saxondale,2009-09-27T11:19Z,"I hope this patch deals with the cheating AI.  It seems they win every roll, dodge every tackle and very rarely suffer a turnover."
,Saxondale,2009-09-27T12:03Z,"Just tried it with the patch and it doesn't make any difference whatsoever.  I have to agree with seedMeister, this game is a waste of time!"
