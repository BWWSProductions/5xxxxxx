â€œWhat a cold and gross winter day it was! Overcast but no snow or rain. So what better way to cure my gloom and doom mood than to dress up, bake cupcakes, and make a mess? Plus, nothing beats a frosting-induced sugar high.

And by the way, don't believe anyone who says muffins are superior to cupcakes. They are LYING. ^_^â€
