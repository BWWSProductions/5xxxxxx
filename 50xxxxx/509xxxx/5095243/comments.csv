,badbean,2009-09-22T00:26Z,thanks for the upload was just wondering if you could help me out i just got my xbox soft modded and was wondering what program i would use to burn games
,saada245,2009-09-22T04:53Z,"To burn the xbox game u want to first run the .iso file with abgx 360 and it can be found on google to download it. Once you run it with abgx 360 it will hopefully be stealth patched and u can play it online. To burn the actual .dvd file that is made with abgx 360, u want to use imgburn and download it from google too. U want to burn it on 2x burn speed and under settings and the write tab, u want to set the layer break at 1913760. Then burn the game and it will take around 40 min. to burn it. Have Fun!  "
