,uffebe,2009-10-03T17:02Z,"Oh, you downmixed the LAST THREE ones! And not the others.... OK, I get it now. Sorry, man! I really should read more carefully before I say anything. Nice work. :-)"
,i_am_swine,2009-10-04T02:40Z,"I have been listening to both the new stereo and mono versions on a good sound system with a mono-stereo switch.  Uffebe, even though you are correct in that downmixing the stereo versions to mono is not the same as listening to the mono release, my experience is that they actually sound better this way (stereo switched to mono at the amplifier level).  So this uploader is providing a great sounding albeit non-FLAC  torrent IMO."
,adolfhitlerpedofilen,2010-12-28T04:38Z,"I don't get why some people have been giving this torrent minus ratings. This is the true mono masters all but the last three albums (which were never issued in mono and thus are not included in the mono masters boxset).

And they're encoded in 320 kbps MONO, so qualitywise they should equal to a hypothetical 640 kbps stereo MP3 file.
This is a great torrent! Thanks!"
