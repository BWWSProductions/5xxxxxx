gameranger is a nice free to play cracked/legit games at. thay support over 600+ game's new & old. dont pass this place up you just
might have a old game that you thought was dead & is still living live & well @ gameranger.

the ports for gameranger use's 16000-16000 tcp-udp

also be a good idea to open the ports for all your online games as well. come test your skills kiddies."
