"Sideways" was co-written by Bentley himself, along with Jim Beavers, the brother of Bentley's producer, Brett Beavers. In it, the male narrator is attempting to talk to a female in a bar. Despite being unable to hear her name, he still tries to come on to her, saying that he wants to "get a little sideways" with her. The song is backed mainly by electric guitar and banjo, and its final chorus features the ambient noise of a bar, along with a chanted chorus by backing vocalists.
