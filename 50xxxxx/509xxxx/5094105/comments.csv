[V],McTav,2009-10-12T18:30Z,"@westpoint22 

thanks alot, not sure who soagg is but checked him out and his releases are messy =[ . 
I dont like to use a lot of words when the torrent will justify itself :P

I know I make good stuff, and the speeds are all thanks to those who seed! "
,Sumsonfire,2009-10-24T08:11Z,"hi Mctav i greatly appreciate the work u do but i was wondering if it is possible for you to create torrents of all south parks in compressed rar format because they are alot easier to download and they are quicker and for someone like me whos internet isnt very fast it would make a real difference as it took me 5 or six days to download a single season 
thank you for all your work"

,nikoHD,2011-03-27T06:39Z,Thanks mate really loving all your torrents! you rock 
,susannahmio,2011-04-16T15:13Z,All his torrents have been top notch and I've downloaded multiple seasons of multiple shows from McTav. If it won't play for you use VLC.
,DaxFio,2011-12-17T17:47Z,This wont play in VLC. Any suggestions?
