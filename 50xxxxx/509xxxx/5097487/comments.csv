I mean, I basically bought this just to be able to seed it, it bugged me that it wasn't available before although I'm sure many ppl owns it. "
,PatjeVitesse,2009-09-26T13:37Z,"Would be GREAT if seed this one.

Many THANX !!!!!!"
,otgm,2009-10-08T23:06Z,I gotta respect you leecher morons. You can't even thank someone when asked for! That's something alright... 
,charlie1979boy,2009-10-10T23:03Z,"I would love to have this in my collection. Thanks for taking the time to make this available...

It sucks that nobody wants to show appreciation for your work and effort to share. There has to be at least 5 more people that would love to have this. Perhaps they should speak up!"
[T],haevan,2009-10-12T01:18Z,Why not seed?

I changed my mind; even one thank you is enough, so thanks. I'm gonna seed it now. I can't believe that everyone is so busy that they can't even stop and write a little thank you comment on a torrent they like! I guess it's just the way of the modern world or something... "
,AtorranT,2009-12-02T04:39Z,"What's the point of making a really great torrent if you are not going to seed it...

I think this should be a fine material from Against Me, so I thank you in advance for it...

It.s been almost a month since I start to download this... hope to see this dvd someday...."
,4334,2010-02-10T16:35Z,"i just found out of this great band, and it is the kind of band that is perfect for my video bar, i play garage punk indie a lot of 70's and new bands like bloc party, future of the left, bravery, also stooges that i see you like them too, if you can get some dvd of television of tom verlaine i'll thank you, i'm from Colombia and here is hard to find this to buy."
,the_poo,2010-08-26T19:40Z,"seed pls?

yo tend not to bug about it a lot, a lot of ppl are morons that don't understand how the whole torrent/seed/leech thing works. for instance I live in Croatia and have a terrible upload rate, so I never start torrents my self, so I never had a account on any torrent site. You have point in what you're saying, and it the least thing someone can do when they download something this good for absolutely free. pls PM me if you're gonna seed it some time in the future. Cheers!"
,kevitality,2011-06-14T22:44Z,"I'm downloading this right now, thanks, but I mean really THANK YOU to the two people right now who are seeding. 

I'll keep this torrent active for a long time after it's finnish because, come on guys, it's FUCKING AGAINST ME"
