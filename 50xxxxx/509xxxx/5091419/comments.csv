,brianxxx,2009-09-17T17:45Z,Very nice! Just what I needed for my virtual machine tests!!!
,brianxxx,2009-09-18T02:29Z,"WOW...I tried and tried and tried and have not been successful at all to get this to work. 

Anyone else get it working?"
[V],RobbingHood,2009-09-18T02:55Z,"@brianxxx

What's the problem? It's a resetter, so what do you expect it to do?"
,robalm,2009-09-18T17:10Z,90 days ?
,brianxxx,2009-09-18T18:07Z,"Yes, I know it is a resetter. I have used BOX's stuff before. It just will not reset the trial time. 

Install new copy of 2010. Has 15 days of trial time. 

Run NTR as directions say. Everything goes fine. After reboot, NIS 2010 is locked up demanding activation. Trial period of 15 days is gone and is now expired.

Disabled the TAMPER PROOF, tried under normal and safe mode. Tried both Manual and Auto options for reset...it always boots into a disabled mode demanding activation.

This is under clean, Windows 7 virtual machines with no prior installations of any kind.

Possibly a virtual machine issue or Win 7 or both?

,brianxxx,2009-09-18T19:07Z,"And yes, the internet has been disconnected. lol"
,brianxxx,2009-09-18T19:42Z,"OK...I did some heavy Googling.

It does seem NTR 1.4 has a problem with what I described. Some people have it, some don't. Supposedly, 1.5 is out and circulating. Will look for it. There was a RS link but it disabled. "
[V],RobbingHood,2009-09-19T00:07Z,"@brianxxx 

I guess it's a virtual machine issue, since lots of cracks don't work with virtual machines, especially this kind of cracks. And if things work for others then it's probably a pc issue at your end."

,brianxxx,2009-09-19T04:11Z,"Yeah, I found 1.5 earlier but had to rush to a client to help them so I tried it under VMWARE and the same problem. it does not work. I assumed it was a VMWARE issue but I never had a problem before with NIS 2009. Seems to be VMWARE and NIS 2010 are not playing nice!!! lol

I wish someone could get a message to BOX and give them a heads up....if they even care...lol

I have to do a rebuild on a real pc this weekend and just for kicks I will try it on that machine. But I have legal licenses for all my machines and they are good till June of 2010 so I am set anyway. Just the VMWARE tests I need to run would be great to get working. 

OH well, I can stick with 2009. It should be close enough. lol
