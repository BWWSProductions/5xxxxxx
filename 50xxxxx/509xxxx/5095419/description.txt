This is the second time I'm releasing this torrent, due to seeds hitting zero and new mixes coming out. That Wikked remix was a real pain to get a decent copy of, and for REDALiCE the best I can find is 160kbps (Nowhere to buy the cd). Enjoy!

Ripper's Notes

After the Caramelldansen meme hit, the disc was exported to Japan where it achieved relative success. In response to demand, the primary song Caramelldansen (Speedycake Remix) was given to Exit Trance/Tunes to be remixed by various Japanese DJs which produced the tracks on this album. This release is intended to provide the maximum quality possible, and everything was extracted off a retail disc from Japan at 320kbps. The filenames have had their Japanese characters removed to comply with an English typeset. ID3 tags are as in the original Japanese release.


UPDATE - 14 Feb 2010:
I never cease being amazed at how many new remixes of Caramelldansen are released across the internet. There are more than went into this torrent, I only put in the ones I've found to be of reasonable merit. Here is another to add to the list, Caramelldansen (DJ SHIMAMURA REMIX) from Exit Trance (The same group that this album was made by, I don't know why this wasn't included in the pressed disc). When I gather a few more I'll remove this torrent and re-release it in an updated torrent, until then enjoy the new tracks.
