,Amen11,2009-10-09T01:33Z,"appears to be a broken file 10 mins from the end.
Does it work for anyone to the end?"
,blob76,2009-10-13T05:18Z,Unfortunately the sound quality is poor.   Every 3 to 4 seconds the volume drops and rises again.  Very annoying ;-(.  Nice try but will get another torrent for this one.
,umarnawazkhan,2009-10-18T09:07Z,"does this have english sub title?

,loaded12,2009-12-14T08:18Z,Good quality for the size. Thanks Klaxxon
,spooler1966,2009-12-27T12:45Z,"This is excellent quality. It plays in 3/2 which is as close to dolby surround as you can get from an AVI.

Audio: 10
Video: 10"
,yerisan,2010-03-08T03:47Z,KLAXXON.....subts??????
,electrohippy,2010-03-13T04:36Z,"Hey KLAXXON:

So, I went to the forum site to look up the release, as suggested, but all I find is a cover and a review.  That's great and all, but what I hoped I'd see were the specs for the rip.  What gives?  I'd like to know the audio quality, because too many rips have crap audio.  

Thanks!"
,MTFDarkEagle,2010-03-14T21:26Z,Is this the extended edition?
,michaelrwatson,2010-04-28T01:05Z,"KLAXXON, you are a fucking dumbass. This movie (as i'm sure you know) has important foreign dialog but YOU FORGOT THE SUBS. "
,TheDoctorTmeLrd,2010-05-07T08:46Z,"Damn you KLAXXON, there goes my 1T hdd."
,stonelesscutter,2011-05-09T00:45Z,"Geez! 23 comments and I get pretty much NO information to base a decision on wether to download or not.
Guess I'd better skip this one and go for the Extremezone torrent instead."
