My torrent statistics shows 139 leechers with the highest % completed being 70.4%. No one has yet completed the download, and already I see eight people have clicked on the quality button."

[T],IndianChristian,2010-03-28T11:32Z,"Gr8 to see. These things are rearing their ugly head again. The secret church directive, issued by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (before he became Pope Benedict XVI) to silence the victims of child sex abuse by Roman Catholic priests has come to haunt him again. This is what happens to all scoundrel catholic priests and catholics. Welcome to hell Ratty. "
,kneebutt,2010-06-06T12:52Z,"Fucking confusing... So this is an anti-catholic doco yeah?  And you're calling for the support of 'christians'... knowing, of course, that Catholics ARE christians.  So - IndianChristian - they are essentially your brothers, sucked in by the very same work of fiction, all over the dick of the same irrelevant dead bloke.  Good for you.  It's like watching soccer fans bash eachother for loving the same sport.  Still, you can't explain intelligence to a gullible wanker so I'll be off.  Enjoy posting a response that no-one will ever read - except for you, as you seem to be the only person here, busily commenting on your own post.  "
