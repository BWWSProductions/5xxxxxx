Plot: On the surface, Saya is a stunning 16-year-old, but that youthful exterior hides the tormented soul of a 400-year-old â€œhalfling.â€ Born to a human father and a vampire mother, she has for centuries been a loner obsessed with using her samurai skills to rid the world of vampires, all the while knowing that she herself can survive only on blood like those she hunts. When she is sent onto an American military base in Tokyo by the clandestine organization she works for, Saya immediately senses that this may be her opportunity to finally destroy Onigen, the evil patriarch of all vampires.

However, it is not until she forms her first human friendship in centuries with the young daughter of the baseâ€™s general that Saya learns of her greatest power over Onigen may well be her ability for human connectionâ€¦
