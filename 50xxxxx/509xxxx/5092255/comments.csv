,epicfrog,2010-01-16T14:54Z,"looks like avi, actually. at least that's what is tagged on the end of each file name."
,Sleppmegin,2010-01-29T19:56Z,"Sucks balls, if only uploader bothered to inform the simple info that its with spanish subs !

Other than that the vid quality is okey, i am watching them on a 22"" 1680x1050.

@magicman: Thank god you do atleast have the ability to remove the spanish subs yes. You see they are org without subs in eng speaking, the subs are just extra files added, you don't even need to dl them unless you want spanish subs ofc."
,Sleppmegin,2010-01-29T19:56Z,Oh and yes it is AVI files.
,epicfrog,2010-02-04T01:58Z,"I have a problem burning this to dvd, using nero. the video goes too slow and the audio is normal, making it out of sync. encoding problem? can anyone help with this problem? thanks. p.s. the aAF file is in sync, the NoTV files are having this issue."
