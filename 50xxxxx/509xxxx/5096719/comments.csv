But sounds really good.

Do you own all of these movies
you have on here or do you 
download avi files from other torrents
sometimes and just convert them into 
more convenient files, reducing the MB size."
[M],vicerock,2009-09-22T23:45Z,RAYMONDryche wots up mate some like the screeners are downloaded and the older dvdrips are my own dvds
[V],RR-NE,2009-09-23T00:11Z,"That's cool dude, very much appreciated.

Do you have any ideas of how I can reach
more leechers on my torrents, all of them
always go to Peer Exchange, they don't show
up here..

I need some help with that."

Take a look, please tell me
which ones you think other
people may be interested in?
