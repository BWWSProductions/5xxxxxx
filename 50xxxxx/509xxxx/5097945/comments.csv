,snowbirds,2009-09-25T07:43Z,"I've been visiting Pirates Bay for years, and I've never understood  one thing.  Maybe someone here will explain it to me?

Whenever I read the comments on a page, I almost always come across some motherfucker screaming bloody murder at some other person, but then I often won't see any comments from that other person.

For instance, FimbleGimble is having a brain aneurysm yelling at 718.212.420, but I don't see any comments by anyone named 718.212.420.

So my question is, what the fuck is NimbleThimble talking about?  Who is he yelling at? And why do I come across this same phenomenon on every page I visit on PB?

,wolfie00,2009-09-25T12:30Z,@snowbirds: I think the comments they all get angry about have been deleted by a moderator or something like that..? at least that's what I've always assumed when I've seen this shit happening
