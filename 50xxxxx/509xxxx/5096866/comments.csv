,[TPG]Mikey,2009-12-13T12:03Z,"@L3nz3 first of all is burning a waste of time, u should download magicdisk (magiciso) or daemon tools ( i suggest daemon tools ) but it doesnt work for me so i used magiciso and mount the cd1 on a virtual disk this is way faster, after need cd2 u unmount cd1 and mount cd 2 u will be able to start the game but u need to mount it everytime, so i suggest downloading a gta_vc.exe no_cd crack and backup ur old gta_vc.exe now u can start the game without cd or mount :D"

Daemon tools Lite i think"
,rafuchos,2010-05-22T18:05Z,"same thing, mounted, installed both CDs, and it appears to start loading (CD looking cursor thingy) and then stops. I'm using Windows 7."
,vlad_ivx,2010-05-23T21:19Z,"PROBLEMS...... After installing the game and copy/pasting the crack, when I try to play the game it reads the disk and then nothing happens... "
,fireuptheblunt,2010-06-08T20:20Z,"ATTENTION for all who are experiencing the spinning CD cursory icon followed by nothing happening. NOTE: I am running 32 Vista.

I'm no computer genius but I'll tell you what I did to make it work. I have a feeling something is wrong with the crack provided in this torrent.

1. Mount CD1, run setup, follow instructions for install. You'll also notice the faulty crack entitled ""gta-vc"".

2. After the install, copy the crack over to the directory. Copy and replace, then right click the new gta-vc file, select properties, then choose Windows 2000 compatibility (not sure if this step is necessary but just letting you know what I did.)

3. Normally now you would be able to run the game, but this is when that blasted cursor pops up. NOW head on over to this website 

http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=1920

4. You'll notice cracks for both versions, I used both and the game worked with both. In any event download either one, open in winrar and extract to your desktop or wherever is easy for you.

5. Copy this new crack of the same name (gta-vc) and paste over to the directory file. Copy and replace, you know the drill.

6. That's it! The game should work just fine now. Hope this helps some fellow pirates :)

P.S. If any of you are trying to play this game with a ps3 controller via the motionjoy driver you will quickly notice that the joystick axes are all screwed up. If any of you would like assistance in fixing this problem, drop a comment and I'll get at you and help you solve it. Happy hunting!"
,fireuptheblunt,2010-06-08T20:23Z,oh and thx very much mr.joker85 !
,ProtusMose,2010-06-13T01:14Z,There are no cracks in either CD...
,fireuptheblunt,2010-06-14T00:37Z,"@ProtusMose its actually in the first cd, its just not in a crack folder. its just a file entitled ""gta-vc."" regardless you probably dont even need to use that crack. just use the one from the website link and it should work fine"
,lionn_1,2010-06-16T14:08Z,"the game installed perfectly using daemon tools lite, except i have a problem playing the game. I can't start the game. the Rockstar logo thing appears and that ""load 'gta vice ctiy'"" thing but then after that, the game crashes. Then this Microsoft runetime c++ library thing comes out and i have to use the task manager to quit it. 'Guys got any tips on solving this problem?"
,na_hui,2010-07-06T15:00Z,"this shit doesn't work, don't download it. minus to mr.joker85"
