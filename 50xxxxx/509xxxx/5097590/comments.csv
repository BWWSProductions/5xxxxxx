,Ordeal,2009-09-23T20:00Z,"If this is infact a german release, does it even contain english language? Seems kinda retarded if they'd release an english version in germany before everywhere else, instead of a ""worldwide"" release right away.. :S"

,data662,2009-09-26T00:47Z,"Is this torrent the same as this one??

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5097591/Tropico.3-ViTALiTY"
,Burlak,2009-09-29T00:04Z,I could run it one time and played the tutorial fine. Next time I tried to start it it wouldn't work properly (the menu didn't show when it should). Now the game won't start at all :/ The Packs/dirs files are spelled correctly as was mentioned as a problem before...
,lockdown6,2009-09-30T08:11Z,"I have a problem: the on-map water/lava is messed up, It's just some broken texture, a bunch of dots.

I have an ASUS EAH3650. Messed around with the video options, didn't help.

Help me out?"
[T],spectre.alpha,2009-10-03T14:55Z,Genuine Release :)
,Thekillcommander,2009-10-03T15:09Z,The serial number that follows with this Torrent has been disabled.
,Mikesmith08,2009-10-03T16:46Z,"None of the buildings or people show, I can see the map and all the plants, I've ran it on every setting and still nothing. Any help appreciated."
,Burlak,2009-10-04T15:37Z,yeh the serial is disabled
,Groo_The_Wanderer,2009-10-06T08:07Z,i was able to make the game run again after  i have cut access of  tropico3.exe to the internet with windows firewall
,kizabg,2009-10-09T11:44Z,"i have problem,i download the game but i have not the .exe file,i only have 50 of unknown files vty-0265   pls hlp"
,ChrillDeVille,2009-10-10T03:48Z,"lockdown6:

""There is an issue with this specific line of cards (X19x0 models) which will be addressed in one of the coming patches for the full version."" said Kalypso to me after e-mailing them. This almost certainly applies to your graphics card as well, for I have your very issue. Lava, Water, Smoke and shadows."
,Tehmulletman,2009-10-11T07:23Z,"i had the same problem all the tiles are awkwardly set up with big see-through gaps between em the only way i can play is zoomed all the way out...
hopefully someone will post the update"
,eheads,2009-10-14T15:52Z,let's just wait for the crack... patience is a virtue.
,Claus-,2009-10-18T00:52Z,lockdown try this for HD 3650 fix: http://forums.amd.com/game/messageview.cfm?catid=279&threadid=88152 catalyst 9.1 works fine
,Hotwired05,2009-10-20T00:55Z,"Works Great! Thnx. 

@eheads: No crack is needed.  

Use serial included, 
or this one CXDBL-FMDBX-URGAJ-XREA7-XXD4W

Make sure the  internet connection is OFF when putting in the serial number.  

OR block the programs access to the internet using a firewall!

If you don't, the game will say the serial is invalid."
,avienated,2009-10-25T13:44Z,"How do I unpack this baby? Usually there is a rar file. 7-zip can't seem to do the job, havn't seen that before! Thanks for all answers."
,finnr2008,2009-11-06T11:02Z,"The ViTALiTY release is buggy. Google this: Tropico.3.v1.04.Update-SKIDROW.rar

This fix re-activates the serial (add the tropico3.exe to your firewall) and fixes various bugs.

Runs smooth on a amd4600 gt250 xp pro sp3.

Powerarchiver will recognize the file extension. Any other advanced tool will unrar too, you just need to open the *.001"
,cgijoe123,2009-11-21T14:55Z,"I downloaded the other vitality yesterday (the one with most seeders) and the files couldnt be mounted, there was no iso or exe or anything, im gonna assume this is kinda the same but i couldnt get any help from the comments in the other because they are bugged, can someone help me and tell me how to use all those files you get in this?"
,mangomush,2009-11-28T02:22Z,Works great :D
,mangomush,2009-11-28T02:26Z,"To cgijoe123: The iso is packed into separate archives. All you gotta do is select the first file to unpack, and your unzipper should do the rest."
,Ckeaschz,2009-11-28T16:56Z,I hope this works otherwise the one from multi 5 is bullcrap or my pc is just a unique piece of shit XD
,rob211,2009-12-02T23:31Z,this doesnt work for me. i'm guess i have the wrong video card: Intel  g33/31
,ruarfff,2009-12-09T23:02Z,"For anyone who just sees a bunch of unrecognised files after download and hasn't a clue what to do, you just need to use a different archiving tool. There's a good 30 day trial one at http://www.powerarchiver.com/download/ (or you can probably get the full version free here somewhere). Point it to where you've downloaded the file and then mount the extracted file with http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads or whatever tool you choose."
,kalysto,2009-12-14T13:19Z,The serial does not work!
,Vladimir002,2009-12-16T06:53Z,"I'm having a bit of a problem, I successfully downloaded, installed, put in serial, got to the main menu. then when i go to play a game I select my island, then it goes to the loading screen and during the loading screen it closes and says it encountered a problem. Any help? I reinstalled numerous times and still no luck."
,ruarfff,2009-12-16T20:46Z,"Sorry vladimir002. Not sure what would make that happen. Occasionally happens if the graphics card is not supported even though it should be picked up during install. Could try update your graphics driver if you haven't already. Make sure you block Tropico from connecting to the internet although I doubt that's what's causing the problem. I'm assuming the error message came from windows and not the game. If there was an error code post that, it may help."
,Ecko1911,2010-01-07T09:14Z,"alright, so same problem as a few others, game opens fine, no serial needed, open a new campaign, click on the first level, then when the loading screen starts the typical background is all kinds of screwed up and whatnot, and then a few seconds later it crashes. any idea what is going on? i've tried this torrent as well as the multi5, tried installing one patch, then the other, then both, etc. can't get it to run. any help?"
,getzbzy,2010-01-09T06:13Z,The game crashes every time I try to save........has anyone found a solution for this??

,demonboy1,2010-02-20T12:35Z,.... Which file do i need to mount.. when i mount the .sfv file it says: File contains no data.
,Jack_Raiden,2010-03-07T11:05Z,Thanks Groo_The_Wanderer (& seeders)! ViTALiTY rarely lets us down.

,chunisfun,2010-08-09T06:15Z,"another retard seeding another bunk game. Doesn't matter who you install it from on this site, it must be running at a resolution unknown to mankind for it does not work and is not supported by any monitor, in short...just bout everyone on pirate bay is a complete moron who takes little time to think before they put something up. Less idiot, more thinking guys!"
