Plot outline:
Younger Sister Vera (Jenny Lampa) needs her sister Vanja (Ruth Vega Fernandez) to remain close. They are the ultimate outsiders, they are Vampire. They don't have any special powers and they don't even have fangs just a knife to make a cut and create a fountain to refresh. Vanja longs to live among the normals and has made plans to run off with a human man she has met. All this seems impossible now as Vera has taken the life of a motorcycle gang member and would be rapist. Now they are being chased through the dark streets as they each confront their own being. It is all nothingness, Vanja complains inside a movie theater before they must have a final standoff with the remainder of the motorcycle gang...only one will survive.
