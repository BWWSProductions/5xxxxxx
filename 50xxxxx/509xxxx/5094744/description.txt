A film starting from naught. With no prior research, no characters, no sites, nor specific themes, a film team arrive to the hinterland of ParaÃ­ba state in northeastern Brazil in search of people with stories to tell. In the village of SÃ£o JoÃ£o do Rio do Peixe they come to SÃ­tio AraÃ§Ã¡s, a rural community of 86 families, mostly relatives. With a girl from AraÃ§Ã¡s as mediator, the residents, in their majority, elderly, tell their life story, marked by popular catholicism, by a hierarchy, by a sense of family and honor - in a world fast disappearing
