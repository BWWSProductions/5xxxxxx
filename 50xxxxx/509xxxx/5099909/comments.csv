[T],liluser,2009-09-25T15:54Z,"this version 2 has been re-made with a new dx 10 & 11 addon.. 

version 1 had slight problems copying over the dirext x files to system32.. where as version 2 now does this all at T13 i.e. the last 13 mins of install..

also this version seems to be a lot faster in general.."
[T],liluser,2009-09-25T16:26Z,please leave a comment after you have downloaded and installed this xp.....
,Flazhp0intX,2009-09-25T20:26Z,... once you've seeded ...
,Demi-lich,2009-09-26T12:56Z,if you want my opinion - When you starting upload - wait till at least someone will download it.  atm this is not worth of time. you are not seeding. 
[T],liluser,2009-09-26T15:11Z,i am seeding !!.. and if you wait like everyone else you will get it..
[T],liluser,2009-09-26T15:22Z,"ive seeded like 3 GB so far..
seeing how the iso image is only 1 GB
where has the 3 GB gone so far ???"
,gooroo72,2009-09-26T18:18Z,"liluser: Are you superseeding? If not, that's why nobody has 100% yet. More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-seeding

Hope this helps."
[T],liluser,2009-09-26T20:08Z,yeah i do Super-seed... but my bandwidth gets cut down at times by my isp.. nearly there though..
,gooroo72,2009-09-26T21:14Z,"Ok, sounds a bit weird to me, both cases. Are you obfuscating your torrent-traffic? It's an option in some clients, e.g. uTorrent. Then your ISP shouldn't be able to limit your bandwidth.

Thank you very many for the upload, can't wait to install this ""distro"" on my gaming rig. =)"
[T],liluser,2009-09-26T21:24Z,"yeah protocol encryption obfuscating is on forced..

your most welcome.. enjoy this distro.."
[T],liluser,2009-09-27T01:57Z,"SEEDED !!!..........

please leave a comment..."
[T],liluser,2009-09-28T13:33Z,"i was going to make a xp sp2 64bit gamers edition..

[T],liluser,2009-09-29T14:34Z,"sorry guys.. no more uploading on torrent now..

,sxp64,2009-10-01T15:15Z,"Hey LilDude, this version is very flakey. IE crashes, it freezes with a lot of things after a few minutes, and drivers aren't installed the way they should. Plus the X stuff is annoying. Who ever registers for that?

Sorry, I'd advice against downloading or using this one. Try a tiny release instead.

Also the ed2k links do not work. Emule is slow and polluted with crap. I'd stay with bittorrent if I were you."
[T],liluser,2009-10-03T16:23Z,"@ sxp64  as you can read what i posted before..
my ISP has blocked bittorrent protocals..
so im now forced to use emule for my p2p.
ill put a ed2k link in main info also"
,gigglegoggle,2009-10-04T11:27Z,"I also had crashing problems with IE and Firefox at first, but they stopped at some point? Maybe after I downloaded some security updates etc. from MS. No problems at the moment.

However, AVG Antivirus says ""C:\Program Files\KM-Software\KMSPD\kmspd.exe"";""Virus found Win32/Induc"". Is this false positive? I think it is part of the integrated DX10 delivery, but what exactly is that ""kmspd.exe""?"
[T],liluser,2009-10-04T18:53Z,"yes its comes with dx 10.. i just remove kmspd.exe myself.. and all still works ok..
its russian people that make it..
i read its a small exe that is a PAD = Portable Application Description http://topdownloads.ru/addpad.php?id=4202460"
,clinician,2009-10-09T11:36Z,"Good clean install, no driver issues from only having E-Sata drives, which can cause Headaches.

Contents appear to be complete and functional.

My problem is just that I get a split second blue screen as soon as the XP-Gamers Ed. logo shows up and the OS restarts, so I don't have it working. I'm confident this is my problem (Hardware/Partition etc) as opposed to the package."
,LAIKVE,2009-10-20T03:09Z,"anyone experiencing the same probs as me?

you should try checking your torrents before uploading them as i told you before when you asked who i am.. check system properties for my name fool.."
