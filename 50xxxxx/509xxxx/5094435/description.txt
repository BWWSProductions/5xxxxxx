Leslie R. Rudnick, "Lubricant Additives: Chemistry and Applications, Second Edition"
CRC | 2009 | ISBN: 1420059645 | 790 pages | PDF 

Cost, environmental, and performance issues coupled with legislative changes, new engine oil requirements, and technology development for exploration of space and the oceans are changing the lubrication additive market. Reflecting how the need for new applications drives the development of new lubricant additives, Lubricant Additives: Chemistry and Applications, Second Edition presents methods to:

Improve the performance, efficiency, and stability of lubricants
Protect metal surfaces from wear
Select lubricant additives for the food processing industry
Select the most appropriate ashless additives
Avoid microbial degradation of lubricants
Lower toxicity

And describes:

Standard lubricant testing methods and product specifications
The mechanisms and benefits of specific types of lubricant additives
Recent industry trends

Up-to-Date Coverage of Lubricant Additive Chemistry and Technology

Addressing new trends in various industrial sectors and improvements in technology, this second edition provides detailed reviews of additives used in lubricant formulations, their chemistry, mechanisms of action, and trends for major areas of application. It explores the design of cost-effective, environmentally friendly lubricant technologies and lubricants for automotive, industrial, manufacturing, aerospace, and food-processing applications.
