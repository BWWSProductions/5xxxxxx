After-Death Communications

Date: 09-08-09
Host: George Noory
Guests: Bill Guggenheim

Appearing during all four hours, Bill Guggenheim, an authority on after-death communication (ADC), discussed his thirty year journey into researching and documenting over 3,000 first hand accounts of communication with the dead, including stories from children, and instructions on inducing after-death communications. Guggenheim said he had his own instance of ADC, when a disembodied voice warned him to go check the swimming pool. He did, and found his young son on the verge of drowning and was able to save him. He believes the voice he heard was that of his own father, who passed away when he was 8 years old.

Guggenheim, who coined the term ADC, defined it as a spiritual experience when "someone is contacted directly and spontaneously" by a deceased loved one or friend. The departed seek to let the living know that they're OK, and want to help alleviate the grieving process, he explained. He described cases where children reported seeing deceased relatives-- one teenager knew names of antiquated plumbing tools that he said were told to him by his deceased grandfather, a master plumber. Another boy could recite statistics of the St. Louis Browns, a baseball team his departed Uncle played on, but was long gone.

He shared the story of Katherine Cochran, a woman who received an after-death communication from her brother-in-law during a vivid dream (dreams are a common way the dead may contact the living), and subsequently began to hear lyrics and melodies that she used to compose songs,even though she had no previous musical background. While ADCs typically come unbidden, Guggenheim suggested that if people have a meditation practice, they will tend to be more open to intuitions.
