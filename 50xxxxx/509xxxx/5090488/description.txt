Grand Theft Auto Vice City .Welcome to the 1980s.

Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long
stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his
old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his
re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good
idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous,
hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no
money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker
gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way.
Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to
fight back and take over the city himself.
