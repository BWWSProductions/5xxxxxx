Real Vampires and Time Shifts

Date: 09-09-09
Host: George Noory
Guests: Starfire Tor, Whitley Strieber, Brad Steiger, Anne Strieber, Alex Jones

During the first half of the show, researcher & experiencer Starfire Tor talked 
about time shifts, and her unified theory of psi. The theory posits that all psi & paranormal phenomena come from the same source or field. This field also incorporates time shifts-- "an astounding phenomenon in which our perceived reality and the timelines are just constantly being restructured," she said. Alternate versions of the timeline can coexist in different frequencies, and time slips occur when people become aware of odd changes, such as being sure that a certain person is dead, only to find out they're alive, she explained.

Whitley & Anne Strieber joined Starfire for a segment to discuss an unusual time slip episode they had when first meeting her. The Striebers and Starfire Tor will be giving presentations along with William Henry at the upcoming Dreamland Stargate Experience at Joshua Tree in October.

In the latter half of the show, paranormal expert Brad Steiger discussed real vampires, stalkers and creatures of the dark. While the legend of the vampire has been made into something glamorous and seductive by Hollywood, the reality is much harsher and uglier, he noted. Vampiric lore dates all the way back to Lilith, a demon written about in early Jewish texts, who was associated with succubi and incubi. The ancient Jews used skulls and magic to drive away the sons and daughters of Lilith, he detailed.

Real life vampires, as opposed to members of the modern day vampire subculture, can commit heinous acts of violence and horror. Steiger suggested that some of these individuals may be possessed by evil parasitic spirit entities that feed on them, and control their behavior. Various vices and addictions can act as an invitation for these beings to come through, he cautioned.


Steiger also mentioned a connection to vampirism and UFOs-- in South America, numerous witnesses describe the UFO occupants as vampire-like entities. The chupacabras, he added, may be an animal that is possessed by one of the parasitic forces.
