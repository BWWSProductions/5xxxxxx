?Escape from Japan? is the story about a band member who yearns to go to America. He is sought after by the police after helping his fellow conduct a robbery and so must risk it all to escape Japan at a time when the nation is preparing to host the Olympics. This film, which was produced just after ?An Affair at Akitsu?(Akitsu Onsen) (62) is a different type of action movie in which it is more of a satire of the social conditions of the time. YOSHIDA Kiju left Shochiku after the distributor cut the last scene from this film. Since that time he produced several films on his own production company including ?Eros + Massacre? (Eros + Gyakusatsu) (70), ?Coup D?Etat? (Kaigenrei) (73) and ?Women in the Mirror? (Kagami no Onna Tachi)(03).
