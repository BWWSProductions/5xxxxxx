Beneath the Veil (2001) (TV)

 A hard hitting documentary with presenter Saira Shah who goes out of her way to show you what the Afghanistan not shown in the press is like. Including a particularly disturbing visit to the Afghanistan football staidum (soccer) that is instead used for executions. Not especially original, but you are guaranteed to have found out some significant things you never knew about Afghanistan after the documentary is finished. I strongly recommend this documentary to anyone who are interested in Afghanistan.
