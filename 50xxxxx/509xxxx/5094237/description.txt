The Best Of - George Harrison [1976]
	

The Best of George Harrison is the first compilation album of George Harrison's music and was released in 1976, following the expiration of his EMI contract. It was also released the same day as his Dark Horse label debut Thirty Three & 1/3.
As the Beatles' perpetual dark horse, Harrison rarely got the chance to write and sing more than one or two songs per album. But once the band split up, the former "quiet one" was quick out of the gate with a series of memorable hit singles that seamlessly merged his budding spirituality and an epic, Phil Spector-inspired pop sensibility. This collection, originally released in 1976, combines seven of Harrison's best-known Beatles numbers, including "Something," "If I Needed Someone," "Here Comes the Sun," and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" with a half-dozen early solo hits including "My Sweet Lord," "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)," "You," and "What Is Life." As such, it's a good entry-level Harrison primer.
