[T],TalmudTimmy,2009-09-29T06:41Z,"Sig, you seem alright, but this Aladin character I find very disturbing, in that he believes Alex Jones is infallible and anyone who critisizes him is automatically labelled as some kind of agent of the New World Order. Theoretically speaking, if Alex Jones is a secret NWO agent, accusing those who attack him as being NWO agents, he has duped everybody using double-sided propaganda. That has the markings of a cult. Cults will demonize anyone who critisizes them, all the while the cult members are further convinced, but the criticism, that their cult must be in the truth, since it is being ""attacked.""
The convert naively, and by brainwashing, believes that when they are attacked, there must be not truthful reason for it and its all part of some ploy."
[T],TalmudTimmy,2009-09-29T06:45Z,"Tak the Jehovah's Witnesses for example. The typical Jehovah's Witness is brainwashed to believe that their ""religion"" is truth. 

Now, when an outsider comes up to a Jehovahs Witness and says something like ""Your religion is a cult."" Does the Jehovahs Witness stop and think that the assertion may be correct? No, they are pre-conditioned to interpret any criticism as proof that the religion is in the truth. In effect, their normal critical and objective thinking patterns are turned off.
It's the same way with Aladin here thinking Alex Jones is infallible. He doesn't consider what Alex's critics are saying, instead he turns off his critical thinking abilities and the criticism further confirms, for him, that Alex Jones must be truth, since he is being criticized."
