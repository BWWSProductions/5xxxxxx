Alex updates the events in Pittsburgh where the militarized G-20 is under way and Infowars reporters are on the ground. 

Alex also covers the news and takes your calls."

It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
