[T],jwhitt62,2009-09-18T19:58Z,"Tricky...my upload of Rush's show used to attract a total of 20 to 25 seeders a day, at most. In the last three months, the total amount of seeders on my upload has soared to nearly 300...

Your prediction of Rush's demise will fall on deaf ears here...but then again, everything you say falls on deaf ears here....END"
[T],Quazza,2009-09-19T02:41Z,"Ya know...its not like Rush and Beck go home and call each other to talk about what they are going to say tommorow.

Beck lead the 9-12 Program but the people involved actually did all the work. He just allowed the people to connect with each other easier.

Rush talking about the march being ""conservative"" was him saying that they are sick of the government. Since the current Admin is Democrat that the opposition is obviously a conservative opposition (though I do disagree with that personally)"
,gaijin01,2009-09-19T04:10Z,"Trick here is your problem, you rely on others informing you rather than hearing him yourself. What rush said id that they had no official leader, meaning a grassroots march, it had no formal party or orginazation pushing it. Just because glen beck ""lead the charge"" does not mean it was not a grassroots effort. Rush never claimed that no one would ""lead the charge"" you cant prove that he did."
