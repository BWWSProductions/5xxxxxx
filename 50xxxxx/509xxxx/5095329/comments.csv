,GLR457mAn,2009-11-12T19:26Z,"you can play this game online @ gameranger. just google gameranger 

gameranger is a nice free to play cracked/legit games at. thay support over 600+ game's new & old. dont pass this place up you just
might have a old game that you thought was dead & is still living live & well @ gameranger.

the ports for gameranger use's 16000-16000 tcp-udp

also be a good idea to open the ports for all your online games as well."
,Eirik-MooseMan,2009-11-14T14:47Z,"Awesome game, excellent torrent - one question though, in the campaigns, more precisely the ingame cinemas where characters speak, is there supposed to be voices? I only get text, this a bug or how it's supposed to be..?"
,sveken95,2009-11-21T22:16Z,Its a bug..sorry
,Mccowie94,2009-12-09T22:25Z,Great Download Thanks 900kb A Second :)
,IamMille,2009-12-12T15:00Z,"@sveken95 

How did you get the game compressed so much? 

I've tried to compress my own installation with different settings in 7zip but received sizes around 300 Mb. 

I see you have some Myth tools, but how do they work? And how have you used them?

Thank you in advance!
