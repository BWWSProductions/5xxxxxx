,protongeek,2009-09-25T05:08Z,"I offered a debate in regards to sissy lala and trickdaddy as well as there... Ah I cant remember there new persons name to go on any chat engine with all who are here to watch and so far no takers. But then again they dont seem to respond to anything that I say other than by complaining about something else. This is the same thing they accuse conservatives over.  Hmmmm . 
        Trickdaddy if you read my post you would know that I wasn't sure what you meant by your statement but I had said "" IF "" ( Key word is IF ) you meant as I was thinking it may have been meant then my statement would apply. No wonder you guys have such a hard time understanding Rush or any other conservative idea. You emotions are like a womans and your reaction clouds your ability to comprehend things. Id say slow down read myposts thoroughly. If you think something Ive posted is cloudy speak up. This one is also for Trickdaddy you said GM is a great company because they take care of there employees. First of they do not take care of there employees. In case you haven't been watching the govt bailed them out. We own them now. Thats not the sign of a good company. Management is spineless, the unions are a joke and the govt needs to get the hell out of the auto industries way with there BS regulations. Only a liberal could witness a bailout of a corporation and claim its a successful corporation. Its not a corporation or mom n pop shops job to take care of you in your golden years thats your job. Thats whats fair as you liberals would say. These entitlement attitudes you guys have do not even come close to representing the principles founded by our forefathers. And where you could possibly even begin an argument of your communistic ideas and somehow apply them to the founding fathers ideology would be the equivalent of having a conversation in two different languages with neither conversationalist understanding the others language."
