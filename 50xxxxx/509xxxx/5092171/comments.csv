Anyone else get this problem?

,raner88,2009-12-18T14:43Z,"Can someone tell me if there is anything special required needed to patch this? Game works perfect for me and I have virtually beat all the missions, but new patch has more missions."

You can try deleting the folder ""USER\documents\majesty2"" But this deletes all the settings and saved games, but if you can't even play on it I suppose that won't be a problem.

That error could come up if it is set to 16-bit colour instead of 32-bit colour, so you would just need to change the colour in your resolution settings.

Have you considered you might not have the minimum requirements? Double check on Wikipedia if you aren't sure, it's probably on there, or check the main game site.

You could always set it to use 1 CPU as a last resort (Use something like a CPU-control and start it at 1 processor), which is what my friend had to do, but of course it doesn't have a very good performance now.

Hope everything works out for you okay."

I'm pretty sure nothing 'special' is needed to patch it. :)"
,jasta85,2010-08-07T16:49Z,how do you install the patch? i downloaded the latest one (1.3) but it says that it cannot find the game on my computer or that it has been corrupted.  Do i need to move the game folder somewhere and rename it to something?
,Blackgoatee,2010-08-20T14:38Z,"ok so i did all this, and i can't play the game. if i run the .exe, the multi-frequency bwee sound occurs, and nothing else. i think maybe there's a pop up about not having the cd in the drive, but the message is hidden behind the majesty icon in the middle of the screen. i tried mounting the ISO but there isn't any. i also cannot uninstall it as there is no majesty on my computer according to my control panel. help, anyone?"
,Blackgoatee,2010-08-25T20:46Z,"nevermind i got it to work. didn't have the right video driver installed :D torrent is great, game is not."
,i-pirate-shit,2010-12-09T11:17Z,worked perfectly
