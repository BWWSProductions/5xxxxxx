,discoverychannel,2009-10-21T21:47Z,whats the difference between this and the dvdr format?
,sister_kelly,2009-12-02T22:42Z,"@discoverychannel
The other DVDR has the real menus and extras and chapters, this is just the main video file. The other's file size is about 6 times as large though due to all the extra stuff.

btw thanks so much shft_play"
