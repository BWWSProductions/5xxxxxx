,job_hunterx,2009-09-23T23:56Z,wuts the cd key??
,Raven-Darkstar,2009-12-09T08:08Z,"SKID-ROW0-RULE-YOUR-WORL-D431 isn't working for me. The install goes fine, but when I load up the game it asks me to input my CD Key again, and it doesn't accept the above CD Key, nor does it give me an error message. I click the check mark, it turns into an 'x' for a second, then goes back to normal.

Please help? What am I doing wrong? "

,msaabneh,2010-05-23T11:29Z,"Oh god... the usual clueless fucktards strike again. Do not update the damn game after you install it and apply the crack, it work perfectly. Seriously if you can't even figure this by yourself and are too retarded to even apply the crack then just go buy the fucking game and STFU.

Thanks in advance"
,lenn89,2010-08-15T11:51Z,"I downloaded the torrent and I unpacked it. But if I mount (I tried it with Daemon Tools & Magic Disc) the *.cue-file, nothing happens. I'm working with Windows 7, could that be the problem?

Please, help me on this one. "
,Poot70,2010-09-12T00:07Z,"Installed according to enclosed instructions being sure to UNCHECK THE UPDATE NOW BUTTON and it works like a dream.  Grabbing various refreshments and settling down to a new game tonight.  Cracking open the first one in your honor, Skidrow!"

,crowb14,2011-07-14T07:30Z,i need a cd key the SKID-ROWo dose not work 
,Ph0nex,2011-07-22T03:07Z,"If the CD-Key is not working, try typing(manualy of couse) the cd in LOWER case ^^)   it works :)"
,Hiddenka0s,2011-08-28T15:37Z,"First Gamerguuy great torrent

Second, this works perfectly fine as it is. The issue comes from trying to get the crack from the CD, as sometimes the .dll that comes with it is listed as a virus(its not one) if that happens your AV program deletes the .dll file and the game wont work right. 

Thats what happened to me. After I ok'd the .dll( after checking it on virustotal) the game loaded up fine and i went on my way. Love this game btw."
,astevan,2011-10-14T12:27Z,"Install Notes:

1. Unpack release
2. Mount image or burn it
3. Install
4. Use this serial: SKID-ROW0-RULE-YOUR-WORL-D431
5. Copy the content from the SKIDROW directory on the CD to your installation directory and overwrite
6. Play the game"
