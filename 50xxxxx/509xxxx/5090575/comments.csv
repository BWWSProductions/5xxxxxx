,projesman,2009-09-20T16:56Z,"Half the stuff on here is out before it's retail date and yet it's silly to ask?!  WTF really?  I appreciate your effort but don't slam people that ask legitimate questions.  By the way, I asked if we will see it soon, didn't say I wanted it today.  "
,Prospector99,2009-09-22T03:58Z,"Bobbyc3op...... Dude... I don't make many comments on this site..... But I have to say that you should download and check things out before making comments like that... I have no idea how Jonny does it.... but he does.... So down load this movie and then come back and apologise.

Jonny, sorry I don't comment more but I really do appreciate you filling my 1 tb hard drive...."
,loadstone007,2009-09-25T13:33Z,Thank you! :)
,teabag87,2009-10-04T06:47Z,"bobbyc3po, what an idiot, must be new around here.

I remember some blu's were uploaded on here 3-4 weeks before it was released.

Best was Taken, which we were able to download in 1080p off here before it EVER EVEN GOT INTO THEATERS! (U.S. theaters, was released in theaters earlier in Europe)

Little tip for you cocksucker, blurays for movies exist WAY earlier then their release date. "
,teabag87,2009-10-04T06:48Z,"Prospector99,

Im up to 2.5tb of hdd space of these movies.  

party on wayne"
,pystdante,2009-10-05T03:17Z,"LOL, I saw Taken like a year before it ever started showing advertisments, and yes bobbyc3po must be an inbred moron. For as the movie, I think a 7.0 is wayy too high, this movie blows."
,afghanwhig02,2012-06-04T17:38Z,"Excellent quality, many thanks A10 V10"
