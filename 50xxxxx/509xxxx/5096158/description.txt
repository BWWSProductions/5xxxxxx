Hello again.  So yea, first let me start by saying that you assholes aren't nice enough to just say thanks for the upload or appreciate your work.  Instead you go and bitch about me having a watermark on my video....or rather a logo. A fucking logo, whoopteedoo.  MTV DOES THAT SHIT TOO YOU GONNA SUE EM?  NOPE  Go suck a fucking dick seriously.  Its a video.  Want a better version?  GO GET IT YOUR DAMN SELF!!!!

This is the HQ release of "Break Up" by Mario featuring Gucci Mane & Sean Garrett.  This has to be one of the most overplayed songs on the radio, but I still like it.  The beat is annoying, the vocals are catchy though.  Video is great, one of the sexiest women I've seen in a while on a video.

I ripped this from MTV (hehehe) so the quality is slightly better than an HQ YT video.  I will post YT link soon so you can see before you download, of course quality wont be as good on their as it is in the actual file.  Codec for video is DivX @ 2500kbps Reso: 656x280 and codec for audio is MP3 @ 224kbps 48000khz.  I initially captured the video with no audio (stupid Vista stereo mix lol) but that was good because it uses more cpu to capture audio in the process, resulting in jittery video capture.  I then used VirtualDubMod to cut the AVI to where the actual song starts, and added the MP3 of the song as a stream, so there was no conversion in the process.  Quality is finally what I would call good lol.  Enjoy though!!!

Didn't really get a good generation for the actual size image, but good enough.
