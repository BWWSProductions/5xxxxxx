I get an error when trying to install it to OCTGN saying ""Image for card 'Dragon Spirit', with URI '/tokens/Dragon_Spirit.jpg' was not found in the package. Otherwise every other one installed perfectly. Thanks!!!"
,xarfox,2010-02-21T23:30Z,"one small bug

1. rename the champions of kamigawa to a zip file
2. edit it with a zip program and rename the Dragon Spirit.jpg in the tokens directory to Dragon_Spirit.jpg. Note that it was missing the underscore.
3. Close the zip file and rename the extension back to o8s
4. Now you can load all the cards"

We have many new users entering our community frustrated and unable to get OCTGN to work, because they obtain outdated and incorrect files from these torrents.  The MTG files are updated much too often for torrent seeding to ever be effective.  You are NOT doing the community a favor by uploading them onto torrent portal sites, in fact you're adding to the headache.

http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com (and http://octgnsets.freeforums.org, but it is shutting down soon) are the ONLY official places to obtain the OCTGN MTG files.  

If you ignore my warnings and continue to download/upload the files using torrents then WE WILL NO LONGER HELP YOU.  We are getting sick and tired of the users coming to our chatroom asking for help because their torrented files do not work."
