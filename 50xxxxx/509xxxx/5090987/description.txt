Description: 
===========================================================================

Apply the theme never released officially by Microsoft

During Royale's development (the XP Media Center theme), the graphic artists 
also produced a black version of the skin, sans the overused "glass" effect. 
The result was an aesthetic black skin that was named -Royale Noir- and that 
even works with Office 2003.

Since the skin was never released (or reached final adjustments) there are a 
few issues with it: some of the colors don't meet the overall feel! (they're 
too purple-ish compared to the greys of the bitmaps) and the inactive titlebars 
are a little too dark.
