I've only watched a little bit of this film, but what I've seen is absolutely hilarious.  As a fan of the 'Nazi Zombies' mode of "Call of Duty:  World at War", it's especially funny.  This may be the closest we ever get to a real 'Nazi Zombies' film, and it's worth seeing.  It's also got some great make-up and costume work, if you're into that sort of thing.  This film's dialogue is in Norwegian, so I've hardcoded English subtitles in for those of us who don't speak Norwegian ... which is basically most of the world.


TRIVIA:
1.  I COULDN'T EVEN FIND ANY!!!  Since this was just a small film that took off and already has the makings of a cult classic, so I'm sure there is some interesting trivia ... but I know none and I could find none ...
