I don't know what time I will be doing it, but it will just be offline for a short time. Thanks for your patience."

,raptozilla,2009-09-22T06:35Z,Switching back to the Gateway. Be back in a few minutes.
,raptozilla,2009-09-22T22:15Z,switching over to main computer. Be right back.
,raptozilla,2009-09-23T06:50Z,It's that time again. Be back after I switch over to the Gateway

,raptozilla,2009-09-24T23:52Z,"Where did everybody go? At least 100 people finished downloading this last night and only 15 are seeding it? If people who download these things won't seed them, this will be the the last torrent I list here. I uploaded this for others to share, and less than 15% of those who downloaded it are seeding it. Nice"
,codgecodge,2009-10-31T12:52Z,"Thanks raptozilla, 13 seeders at present. 666 would be better. We all know that there alot of young selfish leechers. I am on a slow connection myself but do seed even if it is at 10kbps. You get there in the end. Others have smalll hard drives and have to write things to disc. But most of all you are doing this for people like me that really appreciate it. I went to SBIT in christchurch NZ.
Thanks again. UP THE IRONS \m/"
,raptozilla,2009-11-02T06:18Z,"Thanks, codgecodge. I also thank you for those who have yet to download this file for your seeding help. I can't seed it all the time or my electric bill would be astronomical. I have a shitty old 993 MHz dell I use for torrents and try to run it for downloading every night, but all the help I can get is greatly appreciated.  UP THE IRONS!"
,cyco10,2009-11-29T22:42Z,Thanx for this outstanding music.
,CHARIS65,2009-12-27T19:14Z,"Thanks,UP the IRON'S!!!"
,raptozilla,2009-12-29T00:47Z,"Glad you people like the movie, and your appreciation is much appreciated. Just please help me seed it because I can only upload at a measly 10 KB/s, and although there seem to be plenty of seeds now, that may drop off in the future.  So try to keep it seeded so that others can enjoy the movie and the music as much as you do. Up the irons......forever!"
,CrashGordon,2010-10-13T09:07Z,"Thanks for sharing, my upload is shit too but I seed at least 1:1 usually more for things like this. 

Up The Irons!!"
