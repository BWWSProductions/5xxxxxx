Nice to see a UK copy of a Professor Layton game! All of the roms currently available are USA roms.

Examples:

Professor Layton and The Diabolical Box (USA)
instead of:
Professor Layton and Pandora's Box (UK)

Professor Layton and The Unwound Future (USA)
instead of:
Professor Layton and The Lost Future (UK)



Good work my friend ;-) Appreciated!"
