,Shynobi,2009-10-03T21:54Z,"Seed you motherfuckers. this is bullshit, I;ve been going at like 10kb/s or less since I started this thing, and I have left it seeding the whole time. Quit being bandwidth Jews."
,Shynobi,2009-10-03T22:34Z,"until I start getting DL speeds above 10kb/s, I'm only seeding this at 5kb/s, if you want to jews, i'll be a jew."

you could all be like me

hac your neighbors wifi

,Tre0n,2010-04-01T15:30Z,"What the fuck is the point NOT seeding to teach people that aren't seeding a lesson? 

It's like feeding a child a chocolate biscuit every time he tries to take one from the jar!

Just seed. Everyone will appreciate it. I'm only downloading this because the DVDs haven't been released in Australia. I imported their CDs from Canada, but the DVD won't work because of the region.

I'll seed AND download. When I'm done downloading, I'll seed some more. You've got to lead by example."

,EmbraceTheFall,2010-07-10T09:53Z,Any chance of getting an .avi or .mpeg-4 copy of the dvd portions of the package?  Or at least the concert footage.
