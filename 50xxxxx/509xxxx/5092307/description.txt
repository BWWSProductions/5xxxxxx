I Hate Valentine's Day (2009)  
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0762105/

Meet Genevieve. She loves romance. She loves flowers. She loves Valentine's Day. All of which is fitting as the owner of "Roses for Romance," a quaint flower shop in the heart of a friendly Brooklyn, NY neighborhood. Her one problem is that she hates relationships. Having been hurt numerous times in the past when it comes to matters of the heart, Genevieve keeps herself happy by not letting any one man in. Dating is a game to her, a game she is very good at. Genevieve doesn't get dumped and never gets hurt because she doesn't stick around long enough for things to get ugly. Then she meets Greg. 

Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, Stephen Guarino, Zoe Kazan, Gary Wilmes
