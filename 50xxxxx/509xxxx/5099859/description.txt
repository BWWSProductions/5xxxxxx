Atlantis: The Lost Continent

Date: 09-07-09
Host: George Noory
Guests: Frank Joseph Hoff, Jaime Maussan

Appearing during the first three hours, researcher of ancient mysteries Frank Joseph Hoff discussed the work of Brazilian Professor Arysio Nunes dos Santos on the location of Atlantis. Santos determined that Atlantis, and earlier Lemuria, were located under the South China Sea, at the farthest ends of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. He made this conclusion based on decoding a number of ancient Hindu texts, Hoff related. 

Larger than an island, Atlantis was a continent comparable in size to the United States-- it didn't sink, but went underwater when sea levels rose around 11,600 years ago, Hoff detailed, adding that Indonesia is actually the only part of that continent that remains visible. Sources like NOAA satellite data show that the continent was there, he added.

Millions of Atlanteans were killed in the deluge/tsunami that followed a massive earthquake, but some citizens fled to the Indus Valley area in India and Pakistan, and other locations, Hoff said. Atlantis dated back thousands of years-- it was the "soul of the world," the original cradle of civilization, and the source for most races, religions, and science, he noted. Hoff will be giving a presentation on Atlantis at the upcoming Bay Area UFO Expo.


'Alien' Creature Update

In the first half-hour, investigator Jaime Maussan shared an update on the 'alien' creature found by a Mexican farmer in 2007. While initially he thought it was a skinned monkey, tests have shown that the creature doesn't match known animals, and has a bigger inner ear, brain, and eyes than other primates, Maussan reported. More on the story here.
