[T],musicalibera,2009-09-26T15:24Z,"My pleasure Jasper. ;-) Re Alice; my mistake. Since you were a Japan fan I assumed you knew about her. She's worked with Jansen, Barbieri and Karn (plus a large number of other famous English/American musicians) all through the 80's, 90's and 2000's and she's often referred to as Italy's own Kate Bush. But if you've never heard of her I'd recommend ""Il Sole Nella Pioggia"" first (her masterpiece IMHO) followed by ""Mezzogiorno Sulle Alpi"" and then you can explore the rest of her back catalogue if you like those.

Thanks - again - for the feedback. :-)"
