First came the emancipation, then came energy and power, and now come Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, the new album by internaÂ­tional superstar Mariah Carey, scheduled to arrive on September 29th. The first new single pick from Memoirs is "Obsessed,". The video for "Obsessed" is directed by Brett Ratner.
