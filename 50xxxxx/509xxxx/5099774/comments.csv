,sonofdog,2009-09-26T11:33Z,"It is quite possible that political spin was attached to the allies victory, but there is no denying that around 50 million people were culled in some way or another during this period over 60 years ago. It is certain that vast numbers of Jews and political prisoners were executed by the Nazis. Whether this was exaggerated or not there can be no denial of a human holocaust having taken place as a result of global aggressive dictatorships. It should be noted that mankind has not learned the lessons from this time, as such horrors from coercion, bigotry and greed have continued to this day. The Bush administration is a prime example of Nazi politics - election rigging, control of the media, false flag operations, removal of peoples rights in the name of anti terrorism, torture and war for profit to the elites. Why there is no Nuremberg trial for these fuckers is proof of our continued impotence as people enslaved by our own governments, instead of served by them."

Hitler's entire government was preceded and established by the German Worker's Party as an anti-elitist socialist party. As for the 50 million people, where the fuck did that come from? Jews were not exterminated. They were put in camps justly as a step towards ridding Germany of it's elitist upper class and taking down the Jewish lies and control established with Christianity and Catholicism. 

The main reason so many Jewish people died is because of the following: 

1. The Americans cut the German supply line which caused the Germans to decide whether to feed their own men, or feed the prisoners. Of course they chose their own men. The Jews were the cause of German poverty. 

2. The Russians killed a largely substantial amount of Jews when they were raping and pillaging Germany in the offensive overwhelming the Germans deep into their homeland. 

3. The Jews died largely in part to the fact the scarce amount of foods caused sickness to be abundant. When you see those black-and-white non-reenactment videos of Jews being burned, it was burning the sick to avoid more people dying.

Not to mention, a report by the Red Cross dictates there were more Jews in Germany after the war. That does not match up with the ""6 million exterminated"". I will not bother discussing all of the faults and inconsistency of all the books published by ""survivors"". There are already videos like that."
