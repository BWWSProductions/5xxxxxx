Lord Of The Rings - The Return Of The King (2-disc)

The Lord of the Rings film trilogy consists of three live action fantasy epic films:
The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003)
(often abbreviated to LotR for the trilogy, and FotR, TTT, and RotK for the individual films), 1 The trilogy is based on the three-volume book The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien
While they follow the book's general storyline
the films also feature some additions to and deviations from the source material
Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the three films follow the young hobbit
Frodo Baggins as he and a Fellowship embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring
and thus ensure the destruction of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron
The Fellowship becomes divided and Frodo continues the quest together with his
loyal companion Sam and the treacherous Gollum. Meanwhile, the wizard Gandalf and Aragorn
heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, unite and rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth
who are ultimately victorious in the War of the Ring
The films were directed by Peter Jackson and distributed by New Line Cinema
Considered to be one of the biggest and most ambitious movie projects ever undertaken
with an overall budget of $285 million, the entire project took eight years
with the filming for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand
Each film in the trilogy also had Special Extended Editions, released on DVD a year
after the theatrical releases
The trilogy was a great financial success
with the films being the 15th, 8th, and 2nd (8th, 4th, and 2nd following the third film's release)
highest-grossing films of all time, respectively, unadjusted for inflation
The films were critically acclaimed, winning 17 out of 30 Academy Awards nominated in total
and received wide praise for the cast and for the innovative practical and digital special effects, 2[3][4]
Jackson is collaborating with Guillermo del Toro on a two-part The Hobbit film adaptation
for release in 2011 and 2012
