Allegro is unquestionably a difficult-to-categorize band. The acclaimed
debut cd â€œAllegroâ€ gives only a hint of the different influences the band
have, ranging from heavy metal, new metal and progressive to
rock nâ€™ roll and pop music. The band is fronted by singer Ilton Nogueira,
who also writes the lyrics of the songs and by guitarrist Lula Washington
and keyboardist Bruno Sa, who are well-known for their work playing with
other famous artists, from Brazilian pop singers to other underground acts
as well as soundtracks for alternative movies.
Allegro was founded in 1995 as a heavy metal band. They started
to play all through the underground scene in Rio de Janeiro and soon
a loyal audience followed the band. The first album, released in
2001, helped them to gather larger audiences. It was during the promotion
of this album that they played with bands like Dr. Sin, Angra,
Stratovarius, Saxon, Shaaman, Korzus, Exodus and others. Allegro faced
some serious problems concerning management, record contracts
and musical diferences that led to changes in the line up and finally
to a break up in 2005.

Now, the group started to work together once again on a new album.
Itâ€™s a new time for the bandâ€™s sound. As you can conclude from the
demo version of two new songs, â€œNo Truthâ€ and â€œWhat I Still Keep
Insideâ€, the next album is going to be very diferent from the 2001 debut
release. From here, Ilton and Lula expanded the sound and let other types
of music blend with the old metal style. Although the range of influences
are wider, the band is moving into a more song-orientated direction.
