Atari 1040 ST archive and emulator of games

Extract to c:

then find the 
steem.exe file

tons of games on it.

Also a nice access database with what games are where and an excell one too.

Over a 1000+ games

Enjoy it.

Works well with XP, might need some work for vista.

In a few weeks I might even test it with 7 unless you beat me to it.
