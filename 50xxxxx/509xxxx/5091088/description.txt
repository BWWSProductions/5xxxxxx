An amazing collaboration between Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis of Bright Eyes, and M. Ward. It's more than just the sum of its parts, and after you listen to it, you will probably have a greater appreciation for the fact that these four gentlemen are truly prolific, creative, and brilliant artists who have created some of the most timeless American music of the past 10 years, both with this project and with their respective bands. Enjoy, and go catch the tour if you can!
