This is Gary and Doni Wedemeyer's amazing book The Coming Environmental Sabbath (1996) which takes the seed of the annual Environmental Sabbath (Earth Rest Day) and set it within a field of political and religious data to provide an account of future religious intolerance in the name of environment. This conclusion, however, was not arrived at through analysis of current events only. It is supported by a sound Biblical study of theological and eschatological factors in relationship to current political/religious trends. Even though the conclusions may differ from mainstream theology and political correctness, there can be no doubt that this assemblage of facts and data, both from the secular and inspired writers should raise concern and introspection in all who read this book. Before reading it is recommended that the reader sets aside any preconceived theological and environmental views that may hinder a deeper understanding of current events and future spiritual realities. 95 pages. A must read for everyone.
