,rugburn11,2009-10-29T18:19Z,"I have to say that this album does not continue with the music quality of the other albums.
 By that i mean when you play a Michael Jackson album the Music Production is FANTASTIC. The Base and the SOUND is the BEST.
This album does not come near that production or the sound quality.
I know its live but, i have heard other live concerts and the sound BLOWS you away on a 5.1 surround system....this album FALLS very short on sound....to put it straight ...IT SUCKS.
IMHO"
