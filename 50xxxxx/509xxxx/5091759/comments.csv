,flamingmnky,2009-10-03T21:36Z,"Would have been nice if you had included log/cue files with the rips so we could ensure that they don't have glitches. Thanks though, glad to see good quality files, even if they can't be verified."

@ flamingmnky : in stead of complaining upload something by yourself asshole!"
,gopipog,2009-11-27T03:33Z,"wow, relax spikkie some people support good uploads by seeding. Just cuz you uploaded something doesn't give you the right to trash talk someone that didn't. I appreciate the comment flamingmnky, and the download Frankosio.. but not your comment SPIKKIE go f*ck urself"
,retardoface,2009-12-02T21:03Z,"Id like to say good mother fucking job Frankosio,     Could someone answer the question; Are these remasters of which year, or are they the original albums. Either way they sound pretty good but id like to know considering i have 10 different remasters of pink floyd lol"

This so called Prog Band, Pink Floyd were never really much of a listen anyway!  It's true and there's nothing any of these arseholes on here can prove to say I'm wrong.  Look beyond Pink Floyd and you shall find good music, not this Band they are boring..."
,scott_ehm,2009-12-08T02:45Z,"Christ, what a piece of shit you are Spandau. I think most Floyd is boring but i wouldn't act like a supreme ass telling people what they should like. There's no accounting for taste, but a pretentious prick is easy to spot and most would agree. Rant over."

Actually it is the stuff I'm sharing in regards to very good bands that fall into the Progressive/Krautrock/Psychedelic and Avant-garde genres that are amazing and brilliant.  They are the most talented bands!  Not Pink Floyd!  Pink Floyd are what people listen to when they DON'T have an intelligent mind and also don't understand what TRUE complex rock music is all about.

If you want some proper decent bands then you have to download my selection.  This one ain't no good and I'm not joking either, you probably think I am!?!  Let's take for example the Echoes ""Best Of"" album.  Now let's see... when I first heard that album I didn't know if I wanted to cry or just slit my own wrists it was so naff.  I think I once listened to The Wall a long time ago and towards the end of the album I ended up in a coma and I spent a couple of years of my life actually missing out on what was going on in the world!!  Take my advice you dumb shit, don't download these they are dull and very very boring.  I am ACTUALLY sharing the real prog, if you don't think so then well hahaha I am friends with somebody who knows more about prog than just about every single person on this site.  I know all the bands because he has taken his time to tell me what are the really good ones so you saying you like Pink Floyd well you're not only insulting my intelligence but you're also insulting his too you dumb fucker, he say Pink Floyd are shite!"

Well that must suck for you if you have to listen to Pink Floyd on acid because you can't enjoy it otherwise lol  What kind of crap are you talking about anyway you sad cunt.  Fuck your crap!  It's quite simple really to anybody who is reading this: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE MUSIC BY THIS BAND PINK FLOYD, THEY ARE HORRIBLY OVERRATED AND HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS NOW, THEY ARE PRETTY LAME AS A PROG BAND.  IF YOU WANT THE REAL STUFF THEN DOWNLOAD MY LATEST PACKS FROM ME AS IT IS PROPER PROG ROCK MUSIC.  I HAVE ALL THE BEST PROG MUSIC SHARED NOW AND THERE'S PLENTY MORE TO COME YET.  THIS TORRENT MIGHT BE POPULAR AND SEEDING RIGHT AT THIS MINUTE BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REAL GOOD MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT.  TAKE MY ADVICE AND DOWNLOAD MY LATEST TORRENTS.  PINK FLOYD ARE SIMPLY NOT THAT GOOD REALLY, IF YOU HAVE LISTENED TO MY STUFF THEN YOU CANNOT DISAGREE WITH ME, I HAVE ALL THE BEST STUFF YOU CAN GET.  PINK FLOYD ARE VERY BORING AND THE MUSIC ISN'T EVEN HALF INTERESTING.  THIS IS NOT A JOKE THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FACTS, THESE PEOPLE WHO TAKE CHEAP SHOTS ARE BRAINDEAD."
,Zeppoleon,2009-12-26T04:41Z,"Oh wow. 

Haha,
Hahahaha,
Hahahahahahahahahaha.

This is hilarious. SpandauBaby, I don't think you should take this so seriously. Chill man, chill. There will be people who download this, and the people that download your stuff. You don't have to go anal over the people wanting to download this stuff. I'm sure your collection is quite as marvelous as it seems. So it will gain the respect it deserves in due time. Don't slander it with your own name. Shame."
[T],SpandauBaby,2009-12-28T17:37Z,"@Zeppoleon:  Believe it or not, this actually work you know.  Advertising your own torrents on another one and people start to notice that you're actually sharing stuff that they've probably missed on this site.  Trouble with this site is that there's so many torrents and when you go to all the trouble that I'm doing people won't hardly notice your torrent because of all the crappy ones that people put up all the time.  The good thing is that by slagging off a well known artist like Pink Floyd people will read this and then click my name to view my torrents.  Come on you've got to admit there's more to the world of prog than just Pink Bloody Floyd, I've heard them a hundred times!  They are so boring.  People really should be aware of all these other unknown or unheard of bands instead of just this one all the time, how smallminded people can be sometimes.  I bet there's so many who all have heard of Pink Floyd and but yet they've probably never heard of any of the bands I'm sharing.  People can be like sheep and all go for the same thing.  The reason why I'm making a big collection is because I know that people will expand their knowledge of this kind of music and they'll discover new sounds that they like and appreciate.  Not all this Another Brick in the Wall crap over and over, Pink Floyd have just become a boring main stream commercial kind of band as common as a box of Cornflakes in the cupboard in your house.  It's time to move on and find out the more interesting stuff, hence my job entirely :-)"

Anyway the one who is really laughing is me cause you don't have ANY torrents yourself, I bet you're probably one of those leechers who never gives anything back and just leeches everything without seeding torrents.

I never asked you to come and talk to me and neither would I care if you never talk to me again (I wish!)  but the one thing you must understand is that from what you have just said you have just insulted a HELL of a lot of people on this planet.  You have practically just insulted every single person on this planet who has either A) suffered some kind of personal abuse in a sexual form and B) you have also insulted every single person who has had to take or does take meds in their life.  You are not very bright really, using what you said as some kind of insult you never thought to think about those people who would most likely if they knew you kick your bitchy little ass all over the place.  I happen to have met many people over the years who have been sexually abused and I didn't see them laughing when they were talking about what happened and also I have met people in the past who have had to take medicine to help them.  You are clearly a loser in life who has serious issues if you think you are better than people for these reasons.  It's quite simple really, you go and say these things... I hope that somebody brings something bad in your direction one day and you'll soon learn that you are a nasty little man with a nasty little attitude."

I don't really give a crap about any legendary existence that Pink Floyd are supposed to have from over the years.  I also think this torrent is crap, even if it's free on here I still don't want to download it.  At least the albums I'm sharing are interesting, Pink Floyd's music is proper boring and rubbish, the songs they wrote make you wanna fall asleep and die.  Better that, if you really like Pink Floyd that much then why don't you just top yourself, go and take a load of Paracetamols and then when you go to sleep after a while you probably won't wake up again lol.  That's probably what you need if you like this band.  Talk about a right load of fucking crap they are.  Now they're trying to say that Dark Sides of the Moon is the greatest rock album of all time.  Crikey!  Wake up you sad fucks, there's tonns of shit that's better.  It's only cos penis brain's went out in the seventies and all bought Pink Floyd at the same time they can make statements like that today, talk about a load of shit.  I think Britney Spears is better than this band and her music is dam right bloody aweful!!  Britney makes more sense in her music that Pink Floyd.  You are all idiots you people who like these, you all need a good kick in your bum bums to wake you up from the stupid mindsets you all belong to.  I don't give a fuck telling anybody what I just said on this site, fucking floyd man, god!  Bloody SHYTE!!!!!!!!!!"

[T],SpandauBaby,2010-01-15T00:56Z,"Ok, fair enough, I have proved now how nasty I can be about something but if you want me to be completely honest with you what it is that annoys me.  It's because with this band (and I know from previous experience of meeting these exact same people in life) there is this utter snobbery surrounding Pink Floyd, I can sense it a mile away and I think it stinks!  This thread or comments page or whatever you want to call it is a direct example of that!  Just because I come on here and start a drama immediately there's all these chumps taking cheap shots at me because they're stuck up Floyd fans.  I used to have a neighbour who was into this band and I thought he was a toss pot.  He smoked drugs for years cos of this band, fucked himself up in the head from taking trips and pills and now he is just an idiot.

This is why I think this band sucks, this whole thing just proves how stuck up and snobby these people are.  Stuck up arrogant tosser Floyd fans lol :-)"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-01-15T03:56Z,"whatever, pink floyd in my opinion is better than briney spears. do you have any idea how long pink floyd spends on an album? vs how many hours britney spent singing, and dancing? i listen to pink for the quality, and experience. the shit today is exactly that.."

You people on this torrent who talk all this crap about how great Pink Floyd are are all sad bastards!  I'm right and you're all wrong.

You know I haven't listened to them for ages and I played the first disc of Echoes... Really they ain't that great, I just don't know why you people bother to keep argueing about it, really they're pretty shit.  It's not proper prog, if you actually took your heads out of your arseholes and listened to my shit then you would probably not all be so nasty.

And you can't say that it's just me, yes I am a nasty fucker but it's only cos you people are asking for it.  Looks like whoever has made this torrent doesn't give a flying fuck anyway, can't you all see that?

Really..... Pink Floyd aren't that great.  Why get so dam hung up over a band for years and years?  It's all commercialised music, like the stuff I'm sharing isn't like that, it's pure prog not this main stream stuff like these.  Fucking hell all this crappy abuse you've all given me just cos I said what I said originally.  You people are the ones who take it all too seriously.  You've all taken your own decisions to come and have a dig at me about it.  I personally think they are not all that good muscially and the songs really do drag on for ages and ages like something that sounds like it's gonna die but doesn't quite manage it until after a while.

How stupid every single person who has been nasty towards me on this torrent is because Pink Floyd don't give a fuck about you, they've already got their money so they're living in the carribean whilst you live in your rented 3 bedroom semi.  Pink Floyd are shit, when are you people gonna wake up?  I am sharing far far better music than this tripe.  I said it before and I'll say it again, I listened to them last night and I was proper bored.  All I can say is that if Pink Floyd were/are popular then there must be a lot of very boring people on the planet..."
,TheLizardKingMike,2010-01-24T07:28Z,"First off, I usually don't listen to people who believe that their OPINION is right and everyone else's is wrong. I do not care about what music you share, I do however care about the music you MAKE. When you record an album that is on the Billboard 100 for over twelve years, then we'll talk.

Maybe go and try the jungle or something?  That might be the best place for you, somewhere where something will eat you and swallow you down for breakfast! LOL well that's what I think anyway, you suckass, Pink Fucking Floyd, what a JOKE!!!  They're shit and you can't see that, you stupid blind twat!

The music I am sharing is the best prog there is!!!!!!  HAHA and you're trying to say it's not, well hehe you are just so dumb!  What a wally brain!

Goodbye and good luck in your future jungle visits! ;-)"

,Krzysd,2010-02-22T04:32Z,"Pink Floyd - The Wall is a 23x platinum seller, and DSOTM sold 45 million albums i think numbers speak for themselves.

Sheep will never learn new things, exactly my point because they spend too much time doing the same as everybody else instead of being individual.  Maybe now you will understand!"
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-02-22T14:30Z,"Anyway... My question still stands and regardless of what anybody else on here says or has said already, why listen to a crap band like this?  Exactly the truth, they're not all that good, people go on and on about Pink Floyd but so what, they're pretty naff.  If you want to listen to proper bands then take my advice and don't download these guys.  They aren't even a real prog band anyway, the bands I'm sharing are real prog bands.  Pink Floyd are just pretend prog but really they're just a plain old classic rock band.

People won't listen because THEY'RE the ones who are ignorant.  Take it from people like me who have a wider idea when it comes to prog, the sheep like these guys but if you wanna be cool then you should go and find your own music instead of Pink Floyd.  Musically there's far far better stuff out there, much more talented musicians etc..  Really if you don't care much for proper stuff then just keep listening to this crap and you'll never learn a thing!"

It's a free world, if I wanna post comments on here I don't see what harm it is doing, I don't care either.  I do feel however that this band is shit and that I have much better bands to listen to myself thank you very much which is the reason why I am saying that very exact thing on here.

I personally don't give a crap what some loser floyd fan thinks!  Floyd fans are pea brained idiots and need to learn a good hard lesson from yours truly."

If you don't like Pink Floyd, that's totally cool, your choice.. 

So then why are you saying the Pink Floyd fans are stupid?

It's all perspective. I'll keep enjoying the band I like if I want. I don't care if I was the only person on earth that liked them, I'm not going to stop listening to them just because other people disagree with my taste."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-03-06T19:42Z,"Take no notice of the chumps that post comments on here, they're all full of shit!  If you want GOOD music then don't download these guys come and get the REAL prog instead...

Download from my torrents, you'll find there's tonns more better music than Pink Floyd, only chumps listen to Floyd but I have something better to offer!

You don´t have the right to tell us what we should listen to, and you don´t have the right to tell us that we are ""dicks, shitheads and such"" just because we think Pink Floyd are one of the best bands of all time.

On the other hand you have all the right in the world to say what you think is good music and promote it as such."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-03-10T19:06Z,"Look people on this site will download whatever you want to download, they will do what they want!  That is pretty dam obvious.  It is their business to get what torrents they want to get, it's quite simple really.  I am merely just pointing out the FACT that there's much better prog bands out there than Pink Floyd.  Pink Floyd are not one of the best bands in the world because when you have actually listened to the ones I'm sharing you will then finally understand that there's much better than Pink Floyd.  That is a pretty simple statement to make, which part didn't you understand again exactly.  I'm just pointing this out for the good people of Pirate Bay.  To make a point on here you have to be blunt, it's the only way!  If people really wanna download Pink Floyd then they will I really don't care, I'm just trying to offer an alternative because too many people will just listen to the same old Pink Floyd songs again and again and again and again!  Which is boring.  My prog collection on here is one of the best collections of Prog music on Pirate Bay and it's just getting bigger and better!"
,seanmcintier,2010-03-11T09:47Z,"Alright. S'all good then. 
I've been tempted do download your collection, but not enough hard drive space right now, could you reccomend me some good albums to start off with?"
,bartgreat,2010-03-11T14:48Z,"Thanks for all the work, 
Though, I found a glitch after listening only 1 song : / 

Animals - Dogs - 1:11
and 1:35 as well
Actually, the song Dogs has quite a few,

I`ll listen to some more over the next few days, hope it isnt as bad as it looks

[T],SpandauBaby,2010-03-11T17:34Z,"See I told you, this torrent has got glitches in the music.  That's a shame really, obviously whoever has put this collection together didn't pay as much attention to making it and certainly didn't care about whether the files were of good quality.  Another reason to not bother downloading it."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-03-11T18:07Z,"@seanmcintier:

Alcatraz - Live Trockeneis Zum Frühstück (1980)

on this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5105567/The_Progressive_Kraut_Psych_Avant-garde_Rock_Collection_%5BPart_1%5D

and

Ardo Dombec - Ardo Dombec (1971)

on this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5105589/The_Progressive_Kraut_Psych_Avant-garde_Rock_Collection_%5BPart_2%5D

Both of those albums are excellent.  I really love the sound of the Ardo Dombec, the kind of prog they play, it's awesome quality music.  The Alcatraz has got some very intense playing on it which includes saxophone and electric guitar, it's incredible playing.

That's 2 albums that I've uploaded so far that I like but there's loads more, you've just gotta wade through a lot of them.  Since I started I've made my way upto J and I'm just at the moment getting the K section together with lots of King Crimson which I personally feel are a better band than Pink Floyd.

Anyway, have a listen to those 2 and let me know what you think?"
,Hitmanwtm,2010-04-21T17:30Z,thumbs down...sorry
,Atttack,2010-05-03T03:49Z,"what the fuck SpandauBaby..
I don't think Pink Floyd is the greatest prog band but I have absolutely NO issues listening to their work as it is UNDENIABLY phenomenal. Despite that the lyrics are often shallow and repetitive, not really offering solutions as much as simply identifying that there are problems in our society, the music is incredibly creative and without it you wouldn't have the shit bands you parade about like they're you're God or something.

To further the point, you are entitled to your own opinion to one of the greatest bands ever but to deliberately enter a page dedicated to preserving their discography in lossless quality and slander it with your own unjustified opinions is worthy of sub-par society. In fact, you are probably the low-life scum Pink Floyd identifies to be the shit-stain of the human race.
Take your filth elsewhere. You're not going to convince anyone here your music is the answer to life if you disregard any musical technicality Pink Floyd has when people are here to appreciate their work. No-one is going to comfort you in your misery of having a poor understanding of what the musical artform is.

I might add I dislike the popularity Pink Floyd has gained, making it more known to morons who follow the generic pop/rock trends. It should have always been a cult band."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-08T01:17Z,"@Atttack: LOL you can keep your precious little Pink Floyd band, I don't need 'em.  I'm happy with all the other bands I've already got thank you very much.  Read my comments on my Prog/Kraut/Psych/Avant-garde collection.  You'll see that there's not a single complaint about my music I'm sharing other than the chumps that came to challenge me on this torrent's comments.  Just like you infact, another chump that has crawled out of the wood work.

I know which band I shall be choosing, it won't be Pink Floyd let's put it that way.  I think it might actually have something to do with the fact that with Prog Rock music etc.. that the unknown bands are the better ones not the commercially available in every single recordshop kind of band that Floyd are.  The more rare and uncommon bands are better in Prog, that's what makes them special.

The stuff I'm sharing you can't get hold of much these days which makes it far far superior to the usual stuff that Pink Floyd have churned out over the years.  It's boring really, you obviously haven't heard any decent prog yet.  That is sadly your own fault so don't blame me in future.  Go and complain to your dad or somebody for bringing you up on shite music like Floyd..."
,hyoung3,2010-05-10T09:17Z,"Small minded little peon dogging Floyd must have been molested by his beer drinking, country music listening, West Virginia, Grandfather-dad!"
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-05-10T20:53Z,"I am taking the piss outta a band that comes from the same country as what I do, from England.  I am from England, I am English.  I really couldn't care less about Pink Floyd.  I am bascially taking the piss out of a band that is from my own country so if I want to do that then I jolly well will do and nobody anywhere on piratebay can do anything about it.  If I don't think they're a ""great"" band well so what?  What you gonna do anyway about that?  haha talk about just stupid how you can't even take the piss out of a band from your OWN country lol"
,KaptainPig,2010-06-10T05:25Z,"Wow, just donwloaded this, and it's awesome! I discovered Pink Floyd while looking through my dad's record, and since then I can't spend a day without listening to them. Pink Floyd is(and will always be) the best band ever! Can't wait to see Roger Waters live!

And SpandauBaby, your music isn't that great..."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-06-12T05:55Z,"It makes me laugh somebody saying that what I've put up with my torrents is MY music lol.  It's not my music at all, it's the best prog in the world.  I happen to know it is already because I gathered the collection I've made from a Prog experts opinion, somebody who knows far more about Prog than somebody like you.

I personally feel that King Crimson go way above the level of talent than Pink Floyd have ever had.  Obviously KC play better music and have more skills.  The stuff that Pink Floyd have played over the years isn't all that good, it's fairly basic stuff.

I'm probably going way too fast for your head here, maybe I should slow down and talk about Pink Floyd so you might understand me more but then again I won't bother cos they're boring and the songs are lame."
,renegade334,2010-06-23T08:33Z,"How about you stupid wankers stop fighting and actually leave some comments about the quality of encoding, so it could actually help others?"
,AbganExplor3r,2010-06-23T14:48Z,"Looking through the comments and sad that only a couple people actually had useful comments.

It would be helpful to post some more technical information, for example bit rate.

SpandauBaby- I find it highly annoying that you come into other people's torrents and do exactly what you just did; spam their comment's page with your own torrents. It pisses people off; especially when the person posts smug and bastardy comments. All I see is an argument about whose band's cock is superior."
[T],SpandauBaby,2010-06-23T23:53Z,"@usrnme: Oh my god what the hell is wrong with you?  Get a life please, I'm not going around spamming people's torrents all the time, I'm just talking on this one.  You are trying to make things worse than they already are/have been on this torrent's comments by adding to it.  You are doing this yourself, nobody is holding you at gunpoint so don't give me that crap.

When you read through all these comments you will find that I just defended myself against what these smug Pink Floyd downloaders were all saying when I rubbished them.  They didn't like it and infact it got right up their nose and you know what I say to that?  I say good job!  I think a band like Pink Floyd deserve to be rubbished.  I don't care if you don't agree with what I've said.

So are you saying that I was the only nasty person who commented on this one's comments?  HAHA yeah right!  Whatever to that, there's many a piratebay users out there ready to attack you on a torrent's comments, maybe you just haven't met many yet?  Face facts pal, people are just not even remotely bothered about what gets said on these torrents.  If they were so concerned then they would come back but they haven't they have given up and gone home with their tail between their legs.

I'm not doing anything wrong by simply typing a few words here, it's just an open opinion, not everybody has to like this band.  I don't have to say anything else about them because I have already said it.  If you want some of the really good prog then you don't have to look far to see the collection that I have been putting together.

There has been many people now who have all said very positive things about some of the bands I have been sharing and those people are extremely grateful that I have taken a lot of my time up to make these bands a reality as far as torrents are concerned.  Some of these bands that people don't know about, many people have discovered some amazing sounds from my Prog collection.

If I have to come here and talk about some of these bands then so what?  There's nothing you can do about it, the only reason that this one gets to be popular in the top 100 piratebay FLAC section is because too many people out there automatically assume that the only bands out there who have played prog are bands like Pink Floyd, but this is an extremely bad understanding of music.  There's bands that go way beyond the likes of Pink Floyd and I am merely stressing the fact that this is entirely true in this day and age.

I personally feel that the more people will read my comments the more they will become educated about Prog Rock music which is beneficial to a great many piratebay users out there.  If you don't tell people then they'll never know.  Besides everything I've already said previously, the torrent uploader for this doesn't even give a stuff about what I have said, they've never said anything.  It proves that a torrent uploader like for this band really couldn't care less about what goes on in the torrent world."
,bendoveru,2010-06-30T11:11Z,"@enegade334  I feel the same way you do.. There are a bunch of bs comments here,  for all I know these ""flac"" files were transcoded from 92kbps mp3 files..
