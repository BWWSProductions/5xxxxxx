is there a download link?"
,sasi89,2009-11-30T08:05Z,"I uploaded it now, just click my name and you will see my torrents, NFS3 will be on the list."
,agrwalmayur,2009-12-04T18:42Z,"I have extracted the .bin file and tried to run the setup but it shows an internal error 0x80040707 saying that ""setup.cfg"" file is missing.

Then from the main folder I tried to run the fifa2001.exe file. But it gave an error asking for CD.

Also I tried to mount the .bin file on a virtual CD drive using a software and then tried to run the game from there, but again it gives the same error and asks for CD.

I don't know what to do. Help me."
,pogothearabmonkey,2009-12-25T01:50Z,"Hey THANKYOU sasi89 for this magnificent game, its low MB so didn't take long to download and just as fun to play as fifa 08 or 09 although as you probably know the graphics arn't as good and also the controls took me a while to figure out as there is no controls option - For anyone having trouble I used Alcohol 120% to load the .BIN not the .CUE and it has been working perfectly ever since i installed it.
Great Game and Thanks Again Sasi89."
