,mojoedm,2009-09-17T12:09Z,That would explain the SCR in the title LOL
,mojoedm,2009-09-17T12:09Z,Oh and Thanks EZ
,marvind,2009-09-19T16:42Z,"wtf, why is that HBO logo all over the screen? you never give out crappy things eztv,but that logo was shitty"
,reachrulz,2009-09-26T23:38Z,"the logo was there because this is an advance screener. at least i am pretty sure it was, i dont think episode 2 has aired, and i know ez had californication ep 1 and 2 up early, as screeners."
