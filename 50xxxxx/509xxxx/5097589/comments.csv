,globu,2009-09-24T05:47Z,"Revolts against Rome were a dime a dozen. Their revolts were like those of everyone else. To create their own empire to replace Rome. Freedom my ass. There is plenty known about Bar Kochba. Give it a read from sources that do not have a religious ax to grind.

Archaeology has shown Josephus told a very tall tale about Masada which is a relief as he reported the murdered their wives and children before suiciding. Josephus reported this as both murder and cowardice. It is not possible to describe it as anything else. Fortunately it appears to real archaeologists the people there were not Jews. Those pig bones tell a story of their own. The local people requested Rome clear out Masada as they were bandits at best. Robbing from the surrounding towns, kidnapping children. Organized low life thugs. 

As for separating the actions of Israel from the Jews, Jews do not do that. Israel specifically says it acts on behalf of all the Jews in the world. Last year its representative to the UN made that exact assertion. I have yet to read any Jew damning Israel for saying it. 

Therefore there is no reason any of us should make a distinction that the Jews and Israel do not make. "

Do you think you know more or better than them when they had to face their conciparacies from inside and not just as observers like you and me?
So, if you dont listen to them to whom u r going to listen?

,martsego,2009-09-24T07:36Z,"Things will be clear to you all if you bear in mind that jews after being expelled from Palestine by the romans for not submitting to their rule had to be everywhere the object of hostility for trying to keep their religion and customs and refusing to assimilate. The great enemy of the jews was the chistian churches who slandsered them as the murderers of christ, forgetting tnhat jesus was a jew and therefore subject to the jewish laws that condemned blasphemy like any other jew, prohibited them to own land and could only engage in the hateful money lending or crafts to survive in medieval Europe. The christian princes borrowed money form them and when it got to be too much, encouraged pogroms against them, massacres, so their debts were cancelled, the surviving  jews moved elsewhere and the story happened again. Today many jews donÂ´t like israeli policies but some of them remain silent not to lose business partners or customers or risk being marginalized by sionists, others are vocally opposed to some israeli policies and say so. That is why so many jews like to have ready cash in case they have to escape again for their lives. We all owe the  jews more than apology for those unjustified slander, persecutions and murders over the centuries. I over the years personally knew about 200 jews and only one of them could be considered a bad person, all the others have been great pals and honest in all their transactions with me. "

,willdenow,2009-09-25T20:29Z,"I see the Julius Streicher tradition of jew-baiters and -pornographers is alive and well on Pirate Bay.    You neo-nazis are truly repulsive,  I can only hope that you, as a group, suffer 1/100th the misery that has been undeservedly laid at the feet of the jewish people."
,swangpo,2009-10-02T19:52Z,"All people suffer for a reason.....there is a law which none can escape, some people have killed so many prohpets and God sent men and now they want to continue their merry go round for etertnity.....
Thats not the end for them however, the sword of Damocles is upon their heads and all the conspiracies wil be revealed and all the crimes will be paid. "
