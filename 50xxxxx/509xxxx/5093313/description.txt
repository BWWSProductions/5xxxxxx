Judas Goat Jones admits on air that his wife is a Polish Jew but tries to play it off as just being because of "distant" relatives who had "some Jewish blood."

Alex Jones' wife's name is Kelly Rebecca Nichols. Her nickname is "Violet".

Her father's name is Edmund Lowe Nichols. Her mother's name is Sandra Kay Heiligman.

'Lowe' and 'Heiligman' are almost exclusively Jewish names.

Alex Jones' wife has a sister named Jill Elizabeth Nichols, M.D.

She has a brother named James Edmund Nichols.

This means that Alex Jones' wife's mother is fully Jewish, which means that Alex Jones' wife herself is at least 50% genetically Jewish. But, significantly, this also means that according to traditional Jewish Halakah law, Alex Jones' wife is fully Jewish, because according to traditional Jewish Halakah law, a person is considered fully Jewish if their mother is Jewish, regardless of the race, ethnicity, or religion of their father.

In addition to this, Alex Jones' wife's father's middle name is "Lowe", which means that in all probability he is Jewish as well("Lowe" is almost an exclusively Jewish name). This would mean then that Alex Jones' wife is genetically 100% Jewish. But even if Alex Jones' wife's father were not Jewish, Alex Jones' wife would still be considered fully Jewish by traditional Jewish Halakah law, because her mother is Jewish.

Pediatrician Names People's Community Clinic as Beneficiary of His Estate Clinic Receives $520,000 Bequest 
http://www.pcclinic.org/news/view_post.php?id=85

Austin, TX â€“ December 10, 2007

People's Community Clinic announced today that, to date, it has received nearly $520,000 from the estate of the late Dr. Emmett M. Heiligman, who died April, 27, 2007 in Austin, Texas. This bequest is the second largest gift the clinic has received from a private individual since its inception in 1970.

Dr. Heiligman, a native Texan, graduated from the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Galveston in 1944. He first practiced medicine as a Naval medical officer in World War II before beginning general practice in Overton, Texas with his brother, Dr. Haskell Heiligman. He then went on to specialize in pediatrics at Los Angeles Children's Hospital. As a reserve officer, he returned to military service during the Korean Conflict. Following his service in Korea, Dr. Heiligman continued to care for patients for thirty years at the Alhambra Medical Clinic in Alhambra, California, before retiring in 1985. Dr. Heiligman relocated to Austin in 1994 to be near family.

He is survived by two nieces: Sandra Heiligman Nichols, of Austin, Texas, and Ann Heiligman Saslav, of Overton, Texas, nephews Mark and Gary Heiligman of Maryland and several great nieces and nephews, including Dr. Jill Nichols of Austin.

In designating this bequest for People's Community Clinic, Dr. Heiligman expressed his belief that primary health care is vital to lifelong wellness, especially for young children. Dr. Heiligman felt strongly that health care should be available to all who need it, according to niece Sandra Nichols. She recounts that, as was customary in small town Texas in the 1940's, Dr. Heiligman regularly received payment in venison and other hunting bounty when patients could not afford to pay him for their care. Dr. Heiligman became familiar with People's Community Clinic after a visit to the Clinic in 2004.

"Dr. Heiligman's generous, unrestricted gift to People's Community Clinic reflects his intimate understanding of the critical benefits that accompany access to primary medical care," says Regina Rogoff, Chief Executive Officer of People's Community Clinic. "This gift will allows us to continue providing high quality, affordable health care to the 11,000 patients who call PCC their medical home and to further develop our program to improve health outcomes. We are honored to receive this gift, especially from a man who was, by all accounts, a wonderful doctor and humanitarian."
