Lofofora is a French Funk Metal band from Paris. 
They write songs of protest and denounce some of the failings of the French society. 
For example, the problems in the underdeveloped outskirts, the hypocrisy of the politics of the French extreme right leagues. Among their titles are "Buvez du cul" and "No Facho". 
The band was created in 1989 and plays concerts in France as well as in Belgium and Canada. 

These guys play a mix between Funk / Fusion Metal and Modern Hardcore, with aggressive vocals; this one includes their complete discography
