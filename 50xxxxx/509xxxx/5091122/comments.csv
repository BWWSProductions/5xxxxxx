sistromo, when you listened to this podcast, which part did you disagree with?



Dont hide behind generic comments. What did he say that was Intolerance, ignorance, hatred and xenophobia?"

Jimmy carter was used as a pawn or talking of his own free will or both...Rush will never say over a mic that he is racist but to only to his disciples in private...It doesnt matter to me what Rush thinks about other people but why does he crucify them for saying what he thinks...END"
