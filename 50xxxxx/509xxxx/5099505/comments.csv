,seirio,2010-03-22T01:41Z,"My new PC is running Win7 64bit, which DVD43 is not compatible with. Does this version still require DVD43? And if so, does anybody know an alternative which will run with a 64bit OS? "

,Splinter_Sam_Fisher,2011-02-20T20:40Z,I see a message regarding a keygen?  It's not in my download and that's really what I want.
,jacksp5,2011-03-05T10:28Z,"Hi, BlackTroy! I was wondering if you could help me look for a piece of software? I'm sorry, but i don't remember the name of the program. I wrote the name of the software down, but I lost it. Anyway, the program is similar to ""1click DVD Movie"" and the interface was kind of more like DVD cloner. Do you think that you can help me? Sorry for lack of details. Oh, I remember reading a 3-step tutorial on how to convert video files (avi, wmv, etc.) to DVD in the program I'm trying to find. Please e-mail me: block.man52@yahoo.com  Thanks!"
