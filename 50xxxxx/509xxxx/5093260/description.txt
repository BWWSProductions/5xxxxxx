What is Q-GPS? Q-GPS for Pocket PC version 2.00 can speed up the amount of time for determining a users GPS position by downloading the latest satellite information via an Internet Connection (such as GPRS, ActiveSync, etc). Q-GPS is intended for use in conjunction with Telenav but will provide the same experience if a customer is using another GPS Solution.
