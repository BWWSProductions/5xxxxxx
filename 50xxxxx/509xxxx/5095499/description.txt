"I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes" is the title of a song co-written and recorded by country music artist Dierks Bentley. It was released in July 2009 as the third single from his fourth studio album Feel That Fire.

Bentley said of the song, "One of the best compliments I can get is when a guy comes up to me and says that one of my songs helped him out at home...maybe helped him smooth something over with his girlfriend or wife. That's the goal with this one."

Feel That Fire is the fourth studio album by American country music singer Dierks Bentley. It was released on February 3, 2009 on Capitol Records Nashville. The album's first two singles were the title track and "Sideways", both of which reached Number One on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.
