Raw Diamond is a hardrocking band from Uppsala/Sweden that started their journey to the big arenas about a year ago. They have released 2 EP/Demos. Since the soundquality on the first one (This is how it started) sucked, I'm just going to upload the second one, "75% Raw Diamond". It's a kickass record with four awesome tracks:

1. Starchaser
2. Shout at The World
3. Deadline
4. It Depends on You
