messiah:studio is a powerful animation & rendering software package specifically 

designed to handle the most demanding character animation & rendering needs.  It has 

been used in feature films, commercials, games, music videos and print ads since 1999. 

 messiah can be used as a stand-alone animation package or as a powerful addition to 

Maya, 3D Studio MAX, LightWave, Cinema 4D or an in-house proprietary application 

through the Host Connection plugins and Host API .  One of messiah's many unique 

capabilities includes the ability to set up an animation and, through messiah's host 

connections, run that animation and use it in any of the host programs messiah can 

connect to.  The same animation can be used and moved between each software. Maya 

users love our powerful and easy rigging capabilities, such as the ability to setup 

custom control rigs with Armature, without having to write MEL scripts.  Another 

favorite is messiah's "smart bones", that work the way you want immediately, without 

requiring weight maps (though weighting systems can be used too).

Torrent includes program, installation text file in english and screenshot images.

All needed cracks and serial numbers are include to run as full version.

For Vista and Windows 7 user, disabling UAC or 'Run as administrator' may be needed.

Tested on Windows 7 RC 7100 x32 and scanned with Microsoft Security Essentials.
