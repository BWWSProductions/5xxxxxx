,nuckfuts,2010-06-23T22:23Z,"issue 5 and 6 are also out now.  it's only 10 bucks an issue, and these guys are spending like 20,000 a year on bandwidth alone.  nothing more has been posted because they almost shut down the project because of the reports being posted here and elsewhere.

it's more than just interesting to read, it's survival gold... and hopefully a better chance at staying alive is worth more to you than 10 bucks."
