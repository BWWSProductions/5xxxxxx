Editors - Papillon/mp3

Zane Lowe | 20:50 UK time, Monday, 24 August 2009 
                                                        Yes, quite the departure for Editors, however, they've barely stood still since their debut album. So something this drastic is to be expected really. And it suits them, 'Papillon' is full of emotion and drama. It's just expressed in a different way. Whether or not this will represent a complete overhaul on the record, remains to be heard. But as for now, Editors are back and are pushing things in the right direction.
