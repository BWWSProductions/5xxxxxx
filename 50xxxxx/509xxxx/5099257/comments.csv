,Damien74,2009-09-25T14:56Z,Is Outpost rated as the best?? Where? I have a hard time believing that.

Are you fucking kidding me?! Most experienced users enjoy adware free firewalls that DONT constant ask you for money. PFFF free versions....ha!"
,PowerZer0,2010-01-03T02:36Z,Otherwise this is a great upload!!! virus free and 100% working!!
,SpawnMan,2010-01-06T02:47Z,"...and im back. Well this worked well for some time, but apparently it stopped my browsers, ie & firefox from connecting to any sites. This didn't happen initially, it happened after one of the updates. Not saying it's the uploader, but if anyone else has this problem after getting this program, thats why. Its really worth a try tho, I honestly love the interface and features, but I do enjoy ""using"" the internet. Peace!"
,SpawnMan,2010-01-06T02:53Z,Wow..and the uninstall does not work. Wtf Murlock?
