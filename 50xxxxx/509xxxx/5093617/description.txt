Release Notes:

It definitely has been a unique year for the Beastie Boys. Despite
postponing the release of its brand new full-length, Hot Sauce
Committee Part 1, and scrapping a slew of U.S. dates following MCAâ€™s
health problems, the Brookyln trio is trudging through with the
re-releases.

On September 22nd, the Beastie Boys will offer their fourth and final
reissue of the year when they relive 1998â€™s Hello Nasty. As with this
yearâ€™s reissues of Check Your Head, Paulâ€™s Boutique, and Ill
Communication, the set will sport a bounty of goodies, including 21
bonus tracks and rarities (10 of which are previously unreleased), and
be packaged in multiple configurations. These range from a digital
download of the original album and b-sides to a 43-track 2-CD set, to a
limited edition deluxe package of four 180-gram vinyl LPs featuring the
deluxe remastered album, 21 bonus tracks and rarities, and Hello Nasty
collectors edition patch in an 8-panel gatefold package enclosed in a
hardcover â€œcoffee table bookâ€ case.
