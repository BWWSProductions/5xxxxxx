Michael MÃ¶ser, "Engineering Acoustics: An Introduction to Noise Control"
Springer | 2009 | ISBN: 3540927220 | 536 pages | PDF

'Engineering acoustics' is a teaching textbook that can serve as a tool for self-study and as a compendium for lectures as well. One of the author's goals is not only to describe how the topic develops but also why a specific way is chosen. The explanations do not restrict themselves to mathematical formulas. Only the illustrative explanation relying on the reader's imagination creates comprehension. This book represents the foundations of what nowadays seems necessary to make our environment quieter - in buildings as well as in the open air. Fundamental chapters on the physics and perception of sound precede those on noise reduction methods. A chapter dealing with microphines, loudspeakers, and acoustical antennae is included as well as a chapter on the fundamentals of signal and system theory. Practice exercises with solutions serve for the application of the entire content.
