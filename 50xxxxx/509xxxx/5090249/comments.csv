,CSKaydon,2009-09-17T05:27Z,"Am I alone in thinking our beloved SoA won't be around much longer? It seems the story is unfolding too rapidly. I hope I'm wrong. 

And a big thanks to eztv, I was surprised to find this ep so soon. Will seed for sure. "

,almostaquad,2009-10-02T17:57Z,Do you think you could possibly get the first episode of SoA? With no RAR. Where I'm at we don't have cable. I just found out about the Sons.  Thanx for the upload! Always quality shit.
