      New single from Mustasch. Album out next week.

      Mustasch are a Swedish heavy metal band that rose to Top Five success in
      their homeland over the course of a half-decade of recording activity.
      Based in Gothenburg and comprised of Ralf Gyllenhammar (lead guitar,
      vocals), Hannes Hansson (rhythm guitar), Mats "Stam" Johansson (bass), and
      Mats "Dojan" Hansson (drums, percussion), the band came to life in 1998
      with a demo recording session on a farm on the Swedish island of Orust.
      The demo recording led to live performance opportunities, and in turn a
      recording contract with EMI Music Sweden resulted. Mustasch made their
      major-label recording debut in 2001 with the six-track EP The True Sound
      of the New West. Their full-length album debut, Above All (2002), proved
      commercially successful, logging 19 weeks on the Swedish albums chart and
      peaking at number 22. Furthermore, the album earned the band a Best Heavy
      Metal Album nomination at the 2002 Swedish Grammy Awards. Mustasch's
      second full-length album, Ratsafari (2003), proved similarly popular,
      peaking at number 20 on the albums chart and earning them another Swedish
      Grammy nomination for Best Heavy Metal Album. Their third album,
      Powerhouse (2005), was an even greater success, reaching the Top Ten and
      concluding their EMI contract on a high note. In 2006 Mustasch
      independently released the six-track EP Parasite! and shopped around for a
      new recording contract. Upon signing with Swedish metal label Regain
      Records, the band released Latest Version of the Truth. The album was a
      tremendous success; not only did it debut at number three on the albums
      chart, but it spawned the number two smash hit "Double Nature" and the Top
      30 follow-up single "Bring Me Everyone." In the wake of this mainstream
      breakthrough success, the career-spanning compilation Lowlife Highlights
      (2008) was released, including previously released singles such as "I Hunt
      Alone" and "Black City."
