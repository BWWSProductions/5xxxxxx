Im running Vista 64bit, I havent read anything about it not working with 64bit OS.
Any help?"
,diskgrind,2009-09-19T21:01Z,"Downloaded fast, thanks, will seed...
Has anyone got this to work?
I've tried several different install and patch attempts and all have failed, running vista 64bit.

Further investigation found that it was being stopped by Data Execution Prevention.
After disabling and rebooting the machine I still wasnt able to start the game.

Any Help?"
