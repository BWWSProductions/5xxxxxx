Ã› Ã› Â± Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Time for a return to roots of the scene. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Time for blending nostalgia with the present. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Skid Row proudly present our conception of integrating a crack Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› intro with a cracked exe. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› This is how it works: Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› After you copy the cracked content over, like you normally do, Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› and launch the game like you normally do, then you will be Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› presented with a little menu screen. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› This screen has 2 options: Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› 1. Launch Game! Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› 2. View Intro! Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Option number 1: will launch game like a standard cracked exe. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Option number 2: will launch our crack intro and upon exiting, Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› the game start will start normally. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› This is our solution, on how we wanted to integrate a cracktro Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› with the cracked game content. We could have made it without Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› the menu screen, by starting the cracktro directly and then on Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› exit, then game would start. That method will not work today. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Because of so many different PC configurations and Windows Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› versions, which could for more or less unknown reasons cause Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› problems running our cracktro. We didn-t wanted our cracktro Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› to be a problem on launching the game EXE. The best solution Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› is to give sceners those 2 choices above. Our solution will Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› not alter the command line functions of the original game EXE, Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› if such commands are present in the original version. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› This is how the future of our cracks will look like. This is Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› not meant to make the launch of future game titles more Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› annoying. - this is done to bring back some scene spirit into Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› the scene. A spirit which goes back to the origins of the Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› scene, where independent pioneer sceners started to embed Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› their nicknames into the games. They simply did this to show Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› others what they accomplished. It soon became more and more Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› advanced, as these independent people teamed up in groups, to Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› build and attach their own programmed introduction screens Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› inside the games. Thus, crack intros were born and since then Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› have been a major part of the scene. Sadly, in the last couple Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› of years this trend has fallen and cracktros became a niche Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› thing. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Our best wish is to revert this rather bitter tendency and Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› encourage other groups to bring back this great, great Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› tradition of the scene to it-s formal glory. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Concluding, we want to show others, that a pre with just an Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› ordinary NFO file and group tag of the release directory Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› totally misses the true point of what scene can and what Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› scene should be. Our launch menu conception, intermixes the Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› best aspects of two worlds - a homage to tradition while Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› maintaining a complete compatibility & versatility of a Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› typical cracked EXE. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› We want to stress out, that we took the liberty to include Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› one of the best Commodore 64 intros, which have been Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› converted to Win32 platforms and customized to fit our needs. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Of course, it have been kept as true as possible to the Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› original. Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Special greetings to The Papillions Incorporated for the Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› inspiration! Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Thank you for reading! Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã› Ã›
