Looks like the show has been cancelled.  Enjoy it while you can."

This show HAS been cancelled from ABC, but its only produced by 1 US company (FOX television studios) 2 Canadian companies, and one UK company.  So even know ABC cancelled the show, if it gets good enough ratings in CAN, or UK then it will probably order another season."

,Lykos09,2009-09-24T18:27Z,Though I love the show..... I did find the whole Mars suface in pod 4 Annoying and slow to build up it felt like a thriller movie more than a TV series... I will miss the show but if it gets canceled I kinda saw it coming..
,Valdamir91,2009-09-29T21:33Z,U gotta be fucking me. This was the best show in a long time.
