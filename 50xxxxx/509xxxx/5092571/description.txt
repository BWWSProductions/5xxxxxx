"Loverboy" is a song written by American singer Mariah Carey, using a song sample originally written by Larry Blackmon and Thomas Jenkins, and produced by Carey and Clark Kent for Carey's tenth album Glitter (2001). It is built over the sample of "Candy" by Cameo, who are featured artists on the song. The song's protagonist fantasizes about her "loverboy," and it was released as the album's first single in 2001. It has been certified gold in United States and Australia.

"Loverboy" won a Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Award for R&B/hip-hop singles sales.

The single's music video, directed by David LaChapelle, uses the album version of the song and features appearances from both Carey and Cameo. Cameo can be seen driving all over a racetrack (Los Angeles County Raceway) and vocalizing as Carey, dressed in revealing clothing, is shown singing in various "car girl" positions at the track on a hot summer day. She flags down cars as the "flag girl" and dances as a "tire girl" in a kaleidoscope-inspired sequence, before jumping out of a cake to the roars of the crowd below.

Glitter is a soundtrack album to the film of the same name by American R&B singer Mariah Carey. It was released by Virgin Records on September 11, 2001. The poor sales of the album, which was Carey's only release on Virgin, led to her departure from the label in early 2002. Glitter has sold an estimated 3.5 million copies worldwide.
