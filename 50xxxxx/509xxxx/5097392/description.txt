Pompeii: The Last Day is a 2003 dramatized documentary that tells of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 24 August 79 AD. This eruption covered the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in ash and pumice, killing all those trapped between the volcano and the sea. The documentary accurately portrayed the different phases of the eruption although the digitally created images of the city itself are not entirely accurate. It was directed by Peter Nicholson and written by Edward Canfor-Dumas. It was a BBC/TVE co-production.
