[V],Murlok,2009-09-21T21:56Z,donpisote  you kind of not able to read? It claims to support Vista sp2 not sp1 do you got that? since you comment the same on 2 torrents :(

,hunnicuddler,2009-12-30T04:19Z,"Serial worked for me.. thanks for this!

This was installed as OEM but lost it when upgraded to Win 7.."
,deefu,2010-01-17T07:41Z,"Like the other torrent that this is identical to,...I kept getting BSOD: ""BAD_POOL_DATA"" during install in Windows 7.  Oh well."
,chicken-,2010-02-28T03:11Z,Serial doesn't work with latest build.
,dsrs,2010-04-05T11:13Z,"i would really love to get a working version of acronis. but the last one to work is version 11.

if you take the time to read comments on this software across the board you will see there is NO WORKING VERSION of 12 or 13

all serials are quickly blacklisted. you get left with trial version which is difficult to uninstall without crashing windows 7

jerks keep posting trial versions with trojans and keys that expire
