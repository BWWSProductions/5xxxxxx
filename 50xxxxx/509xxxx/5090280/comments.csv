thanks"
[T],grimreaper420,2009-10-01T22:46Z,"Well here it is people...thank you movieFOX!!

I?ll post what I did so it may help someone out there?.

Keep in mind that not all people?s computers are gonna install this as fast as mine.
My comp specs quad 9650 oc?d 4.05ghz, 3x 280gtx oc edition tri sli?d, evga 790i ultra sli, ocz 8gb ddr3@ 1800mhz, and 3xWD 1TB hD?s. running Windows 7 Ultimate X64.

it works on Win 7 X64 im pretty sure it will work on Win 7 X32 and XP X32/X64

I started up Power ISO virtually mounted 3  .ISO drives

first one is d-131rcp 
second one is d-131rcq 
and third one is d-131rcr

All you have to do now is run the first ISO, insert serial and watch it install.
install times vary dependant of ur hardware configurations.
*Serial(s) is in DVTfolder open first ISO file it?s there look for it
After install you will see the icon Roxio Creator 2010 pro on ur desktop

Look in C:>Program files(x86)

Should find 3 folders:
CinemaNow (8.72mb)
Roxio (440mb)
and Roxio 2010(618mb)

Do not register, click cancel, go to tools>preferences> and uncheck whatever is obvious to you.

Enjoy :)

To mount the virtual drive ( i use magicISO, its freeware so i recommend getting it), run magicISO then right click the icon in the task bar, click create drives (3 disks, so use 3) then after creating them, right click magicISO again and click mount drives, find the first file mount it and install. Then do the same for mounting the next three( do everything but create new drives, all you need to do is the mounting process)"

the first Roxio update is ok.  disabled automatic updates inside Roxio immediately after Restart... use Tools-->Preferences. uncheck the obvious.

fellas, usually the first one gets by un-noticed. i've done it plenty times with no problemos.
for other programs use EDIT-->Preferences,  shut off auto updates, click ok,

tip for all mankind: follow Darkave10's cab driver.
having the keygen by CORE makes gettin'  updates a phantom spectator. if they shut ya down, generate another code...the updates still exist bc they're downloaded on your HD

,cr250msr,2009-12-17T22:44Z,"I've had a really difficult time installing the app once I downloaded so I thought I would help out those in need. I'm running XP and have had a lot of conflicts that others (people who purchased the software) have run into but the program still works. 

1. Download file 

1.5 Before installing anything you should update your Windows Media Player to WMP 11. I had issues with this later on.

2. Download MagicISO (skip steps if you know how to use Virtual Drives like Power ISO or MagiceISO)
- Start MagicDisc or other Virtual mounting software
- In you task bar right click MagicISO, Set Number of Drives to 3
- Virtual CD/DVD, Mount Disc one d-131rcp, Repeat for Disc two and three
- The installation should start when you mount the first disc, If not go access the virtual disc one and double click.

3. Enter in the serial number 3V-CV6N2-47J0S-RPXD1. It worked as of 12/17/09.

4. Wait for it to install. This could take awhile. DURING THE INSTALLATION ROXIO WANTS YOU TO UPDATE YOUR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER AND THAT CAUSES OF CONFLICT WITH WINDOWS XP AND ATI FILES. SO DO THIS BEFORE YOU INSTALL ROXIO AND THAT MIGHT HELP SAVE YOU PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD.

5. Restart cpu and start the Roxio. Skip the Registration there is no need for it. (This is where I ran in to problems. If people have solutions for them I would love the help.) First block Roxio from calling home.  Go to preferences or settings in the bottom left hand corner and uncheck the obvious.  Then I blocked Roxio or any of the affiliates from accessing the Internet using Norton Internet Security. Click NIS, Network -> Settings -> Smart Firewall -> Program Control. Block all ?free? software here so it won?t phone home.

6. I had 3 Error Messages that kept popping up. The errors started from indivdrm.exe, dwwin.exe and ehrecvr.exe.  The first two stopped popping up after I did the following: Start -> Run -> type msconfig -> Start Up tab -> unchecked anything that has to do with Roxio or those error messages. The last error message I still can?t figure out how to prevent it from popping up. Google hasn?t help a lot either with answers other than other people were having the same issues that I am. 

7. After that the program works great.  I?ve been d/l movies to DVD, Copied DVDs, burned CDs, etc.

By no means am I an expert so for what is worth.  If anyone else can resolve the issues once the program is installed that would be cool."

      Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Sonic\

   3. Relaunch your Roxio software.

,THXLOGIX,2010-09-05T03:13Z,"installation goes ok everything installs correctly no errors. after restarting the computer and running the roxio only a few of the application from the menus work!!!! I'm guessing there is something conflicting with roxio or the download is bad ive tried installing and re-installing it but nothing works 

so it might or might not work for you!

,Isayitagain,2010-09-13T14:05Z,I installed with no problems.  was able to use the program to burn the disk 2 and 3 which also installed ok.  I keep getting the no permission to launch message on several of the programs.  I read the suggested remedy to deleat the file from the program data file but I can't find the program data file. How do I get there I am using Vista OS  Thanks for any help
