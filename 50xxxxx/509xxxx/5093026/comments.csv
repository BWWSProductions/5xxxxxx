,ALIEN68,2009-09-22T23:49Z,No comments.Anyone tried this?
,retro90,2009-09-25T11:05Z,Are these the Retail versions?
,ouchsplat,2009-10-01T04:15Z,Where are the CD-Keys?
,ouchsplat,2009-10-09T03:47Z,"No CD-keys and also not activated, other than that great pack.  Anybody got keys that can be activated?"
,drizuid,2009-10-19T04:37Z,get an MSDN AA Account and you get free keys. This is just a torrent of what we (MSDN members) can legally download.
,treontn,2009-11-21T12:22Z,is there a watermark on it??
,133794m3r,2009-12-29T15:58Z,ER... why the hell is the version number not 7600?  And what the hell is all that jibberish at the end? How am i supposed to trust this download considerin ght efile names make no sense to me... i have an msdnaa account but can't find my iso so i needed to download the pro iso but with this jibberish i'm quite confused. but the filename seems to match up with what my friend's iso is so i'll give it a whirl.

My key didn't work with another version I found on TPB, so hopefully this one works."
,hawkx87,2010-03-01T05:59Z,"everybody, refer to this torrent for Windows 7 MSDN downloads:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5061850/Windows_7_All_Editions_MSDN_%28Ult_Ent_Pro_HP_HB_Starter_Language

There are many more peers and it has all the versions that you could want.  My MSDN serial worked fine with this."
