Keriver Image v4.1 Build 2694403030.

This is just the GiveAwayOfTheDay.com program of a few days ago. The license works also with the Setup downloaded from the original Internet Site.


    Keriver Image is a cloning or imaging utility to protect you from important data losses. It provides the ability to back up the entire contents of a hard disk or partition. The contents are saved as an image file that can be restored later to a disk or partition.

    As a backup program for disaster recovery, Keriver Image is simple and efficient. If your disk or partition is no longer accessible due to corruption of the disk's file system or operating system, and you previously created a disk image or partition image file, you can use that image file to restore the entire disk or partition. If the disk is physically damaged, you can use the image file to restore the entire disk or any backed-up partition to a working hard disk.

    As a backup program for file recovery, Keriver Image is quick and to the point. If you lose a file which does not have a backup, your previously-created disk or partition image can be used with Keriver Image Explorer to extract just the file you need from within the image file.

    You can use Keriver Image to clone a computer's operating system, programs, and data files to a new computer or to a new hard disk. While you are restoring a whole disk from an image file to a new hard disk, you can use Keriver Image to move or resize the target partition's location or size, see the picture above.

SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal
 
http://virusscan.jotti.org/
 
http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
