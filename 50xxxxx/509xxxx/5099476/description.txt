Double CD of Fridrik Thor Fridriksson's documentary of the Icelandic punk scene 1981-1982, containing some great live performances from the likes of Tappi Tikarrass, Purrkur Pillnikk and Theyr.

If it wasn't for the popular picture of 14-year-old Bjork on the cover this album may never have resurfaced as it did in the late 90s, introducing some cool and intelligent rock music.
