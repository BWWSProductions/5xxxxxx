,therealduckie,2009-09-24T00:02Z,"10 Racist Rush Limbaugh Quotes:

1. I mean, let?s face it, we didn?t have slavery in this country for over 100 years because it was a bad thing. Quite the opposite: slavery built the South. I?m not saying we should bring it back; I?m just saying it had its merits. For one thing, the streets were safer after dark.

2. You know who deserves a posthumous Medal of Honor? James Earl Ray [the confessed assassin of Martin Luther King]. We miss you, James. Godspeed.

3. Have you ever noticed how all composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson?

4. Right. So you go into Darfur and you go into South Africa, you get rid of the white government there. You put sanctions on them. You stand behind Nelson Mandela ? who was bankrolled by communists for a time, had the support of certain communist leaders. You go to Ethiopia. You do the same thing.

5. Look, let me put it to you this way: the NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons. There, I said it.

6. The NAACP should have riot rehearsal. They should get a liquor store and practice robberies.

7. Blacks are 12 percent of the population. Who the hell cares?

8. Take that bone out of your nose and call me back(to an African-American female caller).

9. I think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. They?re interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well. I think there?s a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really didn?t deserve.

10. On President Obama: ?halfrican American?, 'Arab', ?affirmative action candidate?, ?Barack the Magic Negro?.

So, tell me; how are Rush and his listeners (who put up with this and never question his holiness) not racists. Go ahead. Try and rationalize this idiocy. I dare you.

Furthermore-- ANY American who opposes wire-tapping, illegal wars, lies, funding religious organizations, willful govt waste, torture, and unselfishly cares about his fellow Americans is MUCH more of a citizen and a patriot than any of Rush's zombie ditto-heads. "

,limhwa,2009-09-24T01:42Z,"Why do people who don't like Rush or Glenn, seem to think that people who do like them, like idiotic comments by acorn trolls? Life's too short, why bother us? Oh that's right, your Saul Alinsky religion compells you to be an idiot. "
,palistar,2009-09-24T02:34Z,Mark Levin says comparing Rush to Glenn Beck is like comparing George Washington to George Jefferson.   lol.

,protongeek,2009-09-24T06:36Z,"Ive read the rubber duckies comments. The Mcnabb thing I heard with my own ears and Im sorry man your reaching for something that isnt there. You may want to site your sources. As I can actually get the transcripts from Rushes website that has all of his radio show transcripts. The rest of this I have yet to hear. Your painting a picture that just inst there. As far as the blacks make up 12% of the population comment he was referring to why should one race beable to control everything. You really have a issue with comprehending or should I say interpreting what people mean. but then again you are a commie grasping at straws.
And the NAACP is nothing more than a bunch of deviants. You ask how we tolerate this ? Well we know that its meant with meaning to deglorify the liberal idiots who use race every chance they get to side track all of the issues. Its not us who need racial programs to supposedly make people equal we just believe they are. You guys dont. Your idiots for thinking these things."
,protongeek,2009-09-24T06:46Z,Trickdaddy so I cant comment because you say so? If this is what you mean well thats a typical lib statement. I too work for a living. Im a self taught Network engineer. Cisco Style. You dont like corporations ? Well I hope you work for a mom and pop shop otherwise youd be a hypocrite. And by chance if you work for the Govt Id say your nothing more than a selfish createn trying to pad your job. But those are all statements based on if any apply to you. As far as Rush being a subserviant or someting of that nature why should he be ? The guy makes more money than most of em. Financially it makes no sense to kiss there rears. What does make sense though is that people can earn a hell of a good living with hard work at a corporation I know Im one of em. It didnt come easy and its always work and studying. So for all of you misguided folks that think corporations or capitalism is bad I say move! There are plenty of countries in the midst of a socialism failure and you and they can blame the all mighty powerful US for your failure. How terrible its not FAIR you say? Well life isnt fair get used to it.
,sonews,2009-09-24T07:26Z,"The problem with Rush Limbaugh and almost all other right wing radio talk hosts is they are just so damn boring to listen to.  I mean come on,  No one wants to hear the same thing every single day.  The lib's lie,  they will take our guns,  Obama wasn't born in america,  etc.  Get over it and talk about what matters.  Getting people back to work.  Support small business.  Get insurance rates down.  Higher wages for workers instead of supporting companies to want to evade taxes!"
,trickdaddy0024,2009-09-24T14:30Z,"protongeek, where did I say that you cant comment?...I find it funny that after 9 months of being MIA you now demand someone to respond to you or take it to WWE and tie one arm behind your back...I take issues with corporations who dont take care of their longtime employee...For example, Walmart which doesnt pay alot...But this allows them to sell their products very cheap...On the other hand look at the police department which is run by the Govt...Police Officers get paid well and have excellent retirement benefits...People will never work until they are 80 and yes if they work for a company for a longtime those people need to compensated...GM, is an example of a corporation that did take care of their employees...And yes I do work for a mom and pop establishment...I am firmly against Rush because I know he is not looking out for my interests...And Rush fools middle class people to think he's on their side when its the exact opposite...Next, you look to give Rush the benefit of the doubt on being Racist...But if you were a regular troll on this site you would have known that we've already agreed that every Race is racist in their own way...And yes even your favorite alter boy Rush Limbaugh...Also I put up the source for the Racist comments...Young Turks do a good job in exposing Rush...END

,AladinSane1984,2009-09-24T20:52Z,"Trickdaddy - the reason the tele-link was not working yesterday is probably due to one of two factors.
1) You are holding the magical quartz crystal in you left hand- always hold in the right hand.
2) When tuning in you need to repeat ""oh what a dick i am""until you receive transmission.
Hope this helps>"
,protongeek,2009-09-25T05:30Z,"Also I just finished reading the link you posted. C'mon man is this what you actually call a legitimate source ? The beginning of this article starts off with Rushs comments that Collin Powell is voting for Obama because hes black. Thats somehow racist ? I agree with him (  Rush ). I used to love Collin Powell but he has turned into nothing more than a tool. Hell several of my own freinds who just so happen to be black agree and one of my buddies voted for the first time in his life just because he was black. Which is fine even though he doesnt agree with the guy ( Obama ). 
      So to start off an article like that already shows where there leaning towards. Ive listened to Rush for over a decade. Racist is he ? Good luck with trying to paint Rush and conservatives as racist. Each day more and more people of all walks of life admit they are conservative versus Liberal. What are you guys going to say to Blacks, Asians, Mexicans, Persians etc for being conservative ? Are you going to call them uncle Toms as your Liberals did against Clarence Thomas ? What about the rest of the worlds races who live here and are conservative ? Are you going to lash out and call them names to for dispelling the myth that liberals are nothing more than Marxists ?
 Another one for Trickdaddy. Cities paying there Police so well ? Hmmm, Take a look at where the stimulus money is going and why ( to bailout City Govt's ). Cities are miss managing themselves again. Making promises they cant keep. Don't believe me ? Try the City of Vallejo CA about an hour from me they are bankrupt or hell try my City Modesto laid off 25 police officers. Not to mention all the city employees who lose there pensions who were also laid off. Wow... Boy sign me up for the way they were treated. No thanks. Govt was never setup to be the ones to set the standards of pay or perks for skilled people. Its wrong! It completely con volutes the market place."
,trickdaddy0024,2009-09-25T07:09Z,"""The beginning of this article starts off with Rushs comments that Collin Powell is voting for Obama because hes black. "" - protongeek...Just to let you know every writer's objective is to influence the reader to their way of thinking...Rush has been doing this for years...Colin Powell said he supported Obama...Why?...Because he could not support the Old guy and the extremely unqualified Sarah Palin...Colin Powell represented what a lot of smart white americans thought about the Mccain/Palin ticket...Does the fundmentals of OUR economy is strong sound familiar?...""Good luck with trying to paint Rush and conservatives as racist. "" - protongeek...Being a Conservative does not make you a racist...What people say and do does...Again, every pure race is Racist in their own way...No need to talk in circles about this...Nothing you say can change my mind about this...""Try the City of Vallejo CA about an hour from me they are bankrupt or hell try my City Modesto laid off 25 police officers."" - protongeek...Protogeek despite what Rush has said we are in a recession inherited from the Bush Administration...Let me put this out there...Find me a news article in any city in America where the county does not have to cut their budget and I will send you $100.00...GM was doing fine until the economy went into the toilet so argument has no merit...Police Officers from around the country get Federal Money from the Government...I dont see any PO stand in line for a job at Walmart...END "
