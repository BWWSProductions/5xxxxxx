,InEvX,2009-09-24T06:55Z,"NTR 1.7 didn't work for me. After 2 days, I got the subscription pop up. :(. I had 366 days and then all of a sudden, it stopped working :(. I'm pretty sure these are false positives because I checked out RobbingHood's torrents, mostly all positive feed back. 

I hope they can fix this issue in 1.8...
I might just do the extended trail of 75 days or whatever, that's what worked for me in NIS 2009.
Not a biggy, good for 2 months and a half :)!
By then, it'll be fixed!

Thanks for the torrent, hopefully a fix shall come soon :)

Cheeeers!"
,InEvX,2009-09-24T07:00Z,"It doesn't matter if we uninstall NTR right? The subscription should last until 366 days?

Or is that the reason why it only lasts 1-2 days?

I uninstalled NTR after it installed...so it showed 366 days and then two days later, it went back to being lame :(.

I also have KIS 10..and it doesn't like these NTR stuff. Same stuff on this page RobbingHood posted. 

ANyways, I'll keep trying... I like to have both KIS and NIS because I like my cpu safe :)

Cheers once again!!!"
,InEvX,2009-09-24T07:04Z,LAME! 1.8 is only 75 days :(
[V],RobbingHood,2009-09-24T07:38Z,"@kingLeonidas 
An av scan report is also mentioned in the torrent description. All hits are false positive caused by some used binaries and cryptors etc.

@InEvX 
Reliable users reported that the resetters are working for them. Seems like the problem is at your end."

why you got 2 antiviruses on your system ??? this will cause problems ,should only heve 1 !!!"

,natyxxo,2009-09-24T13:51Z,"Guys, this one doesn't work anymore... it keeps saying that I have exceeded the number of installs for this serial and only activates a 75-days subscription... had to install the 1.5.0 version again... :("
,InEvX,2009-09-24T18:22Z,"wullthebull... I use two because sometimes Kaspersky's key get black listed, so I use Norton.
Intel I7 handles two AV quite well so it doesn't really matter about the 1 second start up delay.

I got 75 days, just like natyxxo is stating. 
Sooo I'm in a quagmire :(

Hopefully this gets resolved soon :D.
Cheerios :)"

So far there are about 4 trial resetters for Norton 2010, and they all work, no matter how many days it gives. It just takes a few minutes to reset Norton.
If you have a better fix then your welcome to post it instead of complaining. 75 days or 1000 days: it's all the same as long as the 75 days can be resetted."
[V],RobbingHood,2009-09-25T00:37Z,"@wullthebull 

Besides a full security suit it's no problem to install more than one av scanner as long as just the av scanner is installed (uncheck all other features by custom install). Just a few av programs, like McAfee or Norman, are standalones."
,lkadar,2009-09-25T04:43Z,"I had a same problem, after two days it gave the red sign and said that I am not secure anymore.
However, I made a simple restart and it was green again and said that I have 366 days left (again)."
,sariroti,2009-09-25T22:11Z,"@lkadar

You have the option for 366 days, why would u need to have the trial reset activated?
Install the trial reset with 366 days, once you got it, uninstall it.
You won't have any problem for a year.
After a year, they will publish the 2011 version anyway."
,lkadar,2009-09-26T06:04Z,"@sariroti

You misunderstand me. I didn't activate anything.
What I am saying is this: Normally I leave my computer on. However, if I have to restart for any reason (for instance installing updates or a new program) the TralReset (v 1.7) does not work anymore if NIS is down to 365 days or less.
Now if I restart Windows 7 again NIS goes back to 366 days and works again. This happened for me at least twice."
,sariroti,2009-09-26T21:49Z,"@lkadar

I don't know about that then.
Coz mine is Windows Vista 64-bit, and I used the v1.7 to make it became 366 days.
And so far, I still have 349 days of subscription remaining and no problem at all (been shutting it down, restarting it for times).
All I did was just exactly like what I told u in my previous comment.
U have to ask RH then."

Buggy or not, NTR 1.8 is working for others, but it may depend on it's installed and on which pc etc.
