This is a portable version Atomic Mail Sender 5.10

I don't take credit for this app  I just made it portable so you can take it with you 

I have scanned it for viruses and it scans clean    but it's a good idea to check it yourself . This was made portable on XP pro machine  and I have tested it on windows XP & XP pro   I have not tested it on vista

There is no need to install just copy the file to your desktop or usb key  and just click on the Atomic Mail Sender.exe file 

This is NOT a registered version the serial that i had wasn't excepted but you can add your own serial in help settings
