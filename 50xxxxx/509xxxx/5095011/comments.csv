Although I haven't seen the sequels yet, I get the feeling that this is a reasonably good guide as to whether you'll want to endure the slower dl times for those lesser seeded versions.  Gave me what seemed to be a ration of shit in burning with all kinds of error warnings, but played back fine afterwards.  Who knows.

Thanks.  (Isn't your user name some kind of dreaded flu virus or something?:} )"

By the time you downloaded this everyone was done and thats why it took so long for you. Also, what kind of errors did you get? I didn't do anything different to this than the other ones that I put up.
And the virus thing is funny."

I never heard of this one (Cube) before, found it by browsing SF torrents. Thank You, mr. Virus, I'm looking forward to seeing this. It looks nicely weird.
As for seeding: It is a wonder ppl are unable to see, that the whole idea of P2P rest on uploading more than downloading.
Thanx again, man"
