,ozc,2010-04-25T03:47Z,"Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 720x400 29.97fps 
Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo
Subtitle: VobSub 

episodes 1-18 200mb each
episodes 19+ 249mb each
Encoder changed their compression quality for some reason.

720x400 means it was down-scaled to hide interlacing. However I haven't found anything better yet."
,AeroCrux,2010-05-10T20:15Z,"Where are the english subs when I play the video in Jap language?

I tried DivX, WinAmp, GomPlayer but I can't find the subs. 

How do I play the video with Jap audio and English subs?"
,mizukimadness,2010-07-26T01:04Z,Awesome anime. Definitely worth seeing!
[T],youssef0eddoumali,2010-08-06T13:08Z,"@AeroCrux:
use vlc player when you wanna swith between languages use the audio menu,when you want to choose a subtitle use the video menu"

p.s.- small problem w/ the english subtitles. The vid wouldnt display the subtitles (doesnt really matter tho. I still watched w/ english audio). I would rate this d/l a 5 star."

,Ockin,2011-11-13T16:17Z,"@koudepinda

The English Subs don't work, and the Japanese Subs are in English.

Just use the Jap Subs, or is that too much of a mindfuck?"
,sytheii,2011-11-23T09:32Z,"in the defense of people asking about how to get the subs to work...it confused the crap out of me as well...

why the heck did they make the ""jap"" subs the eng? i guess they prolly just slipped up when generating the files."
,zooter6,2012-03-12T00:53Z,"thanks uploader!
dual audio was just what i was looking for!"
,Spec234,2012-03-22T07:07Z,Thanks for this! It's an awesome series.
