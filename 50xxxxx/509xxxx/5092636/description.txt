Synopsis: LIVE ANIMALS is a grisly indie-horror film that follows in the torture-porn tradition of HOSTEL and WOLF CREEK. When a group of college students go partying in the woods, they find themselves targeted by a sadistic hunter (John Still, BLACK SNAKE MOAN) who traffics in selling his human victims to the white-slave trade.
