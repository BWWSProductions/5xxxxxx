The CLIFFHANGERS

Swedish Garage rock legend Jens Lindgren ( Crimson Shadow, Stomachmouths, Wylde mammoths, Maharajas) 
and  drummer , and in this case also sharing lead vocals, "Doctor" Ã…ke Eriksson ( Wasa Express, Attack, Egba )
In a tribute to 60's rock heros like The Electric Prunes, Sonics, Seeds, Trashmen, Downliners Sect and The Standells.
Jens couldn't resist, so he had to write some original songs as well ! And they're also included here.
BjÃ¶rn Beaver and the mysterious "Bruno" trashes the guitars. In "Brunos" case it 's a completely round one , built by himself.
Playing a gig at mental institution "Beckomberga" outside of Stockholm was not beyond The Cliffhangers tour schedule.
