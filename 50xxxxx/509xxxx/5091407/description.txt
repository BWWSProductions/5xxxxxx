Marvel Preview was a magazine-sized black-and-white showcase comic book published by Curtis Magazines, an imprint of Marvel. (The final issue was published by the Marvel Magazines Group, another Marvel imprint.)

Marvel Preview is notable for containing the first and early appearances of many Marvel characters like Blade (issue #3), Star-Lord (#4), Dominic Fortune (#2), Satana (#7), and many more. It also contained premiere artwork by Keith Giffen (in the back up story of issue #4 and #7, "The Sword in the Star"), and the first teaming of the celebrated X-Men creative trio of writer Chris Claremont, penciller John Byrne, and inker Terry Austin (in issue #11, featuring Star-Lord.)

Despite a quarterly frequency, the magazine had a history of scheduling problems, with one "Next Issue" ad after another proving inaccurate. For example, #2 promised Thor the Mighty for #3, but a Blade story originally promoted as a serial for the recently cancelled Vampire Tales appeared, while the Thor material was not seen until #10. As of #25, the title was changed to Bizarre Adventures, which published an additional ten issues before folding in Feb. 1983. The final issue, #34, was a color comic book, a "Hate the Holidays" issue fronted with a story featuring Howard the Duck.
