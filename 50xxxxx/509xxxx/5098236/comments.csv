direct download"
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T01:06Z,"don't worry son, i'm almost done downloading the file... i'll start your torrent for you, and suggest you reread the how-to of uploading torrents. the longer you wait to start seeding, the slower it'll run"
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T01:09Z,"Ok guys this is now seeding. 
@supson...Don't quit your day job,and thanx for trying"

Do tell."
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T02:47Z,"there were no seeds until me? i started your torrent. now if thats ""right"" check your logic"
,Supson,2009-09-24T02:49Z,"Well I left my computer running after I uploaded the file, maybe my computer fell asleep while I was gone."
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T02:53Z,"shit happens, nothin personal....all is fixed and theres plenty of seeds now"
,Supson,2009-09-24T02:54Z,Well lets be real you were being a fucking douche but whatever its good. Appreciate you starting it up for me.
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T02:58Z,"in my defense when i checked your torrent list nothing showed up thought it may have been your first.  so i'll apologize for that. and my only real concern is everyone gets the chance for there fav tv shows free and when they want......
