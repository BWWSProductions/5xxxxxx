Works really well too.

From my experience, install Norton under safe mode...do not reboot...then run the resetter (as admin) reboot when done.

This one an version 1.5 work really well under VMWARE too if you run both in safe mode."
,robalm,2009-09-20T22:48Z,"nice this one works for more then 1 day i hope :) 
I got 363 days is this normal?
RobbingHood great work many thanks

,sariroti,2009-09-20T22:59Z,"So basically,
this version will reset Norton to 366 days and the old version (1.5) will reset to 362 days??

Is there any major difference??"
,sariroti,2009-09-21T17:30Z,"@rahulunknown

Been 3 days here and it's fine though (I'm using 1.5).
But one thing that's weird, it started with 362 days, after I rebooted the computer, it became 361 days, then I stopped checking it. On the next day, it's been around 24 hours since I installed it, the subscription day remaining was 356...It's only 1 day but it took 5 days of subscription. I don't know what's goin' on though."
,lil.ahlot,2009-09-22T22:09Z,thanks RH wrks great
,calkinsclan666,2009-09-23T08:18Z,im sorry to say this torrent really sucks! it worked and changed the trial from 30 to 366 and the day after i installed it the damn thing stopped working and said i have to register....

You don't need the ""Auto Reset"".
All you need to do now is to remove Norton using Norton Removal Tool.
Then install back the Norton 2010.
Disable Norton Tamper Protection thing, run the crack as Administrator (I believe u already know this).
Install the 366 days. Don't click yes on the auto-trial reset.
Then after it's done and you can see that you have 366 days of subscription, UNINSTALL the Trial Reset.
Then u're done."
