I was unsure of him but after this set i know it will be well done. BUY HIS BOOKS. I have all 5 now."

As thebadman77 mentions, buy his books.  This is one author I would like to see much more of.  I'm also thankful to discover Graphic Audio's audiobooks though this, they did a great job.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase their product now.

Can't comment on the others.  Read them already & didn't download."

,freddykur,2011-09-17T00:26Z,"Misborn 1 Final Empire has the first part of the first file 3 separate times,  #1, 9, and 16. Weird "
,fatcamo,2012-03-21T04:37Z,Is anyone else having trouble with Mistborn: Final Empire? It seems to me that the files are mislabeled and I'm having trouble putting them in order. 
,divedancer,2012-04-22T17:44Z,"hi yes mistborn is misnumbered ,it will play fine on the pc but not when you transfer to i-pod or what ever you are using, they have the correct sequence on demoniod :-))"
