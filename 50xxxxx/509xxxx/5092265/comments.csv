,hobocommando,2009-09-30T12:28Z,Holy crap!!!!! i'm so glad they came out with a new album.   Thanks!
,jerstud56,2009-10-01T07:20Z,Great speed but no need to add 320 kbps to your torrent when none of the songs are 320 kbps. All are in the 200 range.
,yldee,2009-10-08T21:05Z,"thanks, just got this after dl ing an inferior version!"
,hrag,2009-10-14T04:07Z,Awesome! 1.4 MB!
,rpgmaker,2009-12-03T15:23Z,"I still haven't downloaded the torrent but the file says it's a V0. That's a better quality. I guess he put 320 because you can select that range with LAME. Anyways, the fact is that if its really a V0 it's quality on par with 320 or better."

,johnnyboy787,2010-11-23T03:13Z,Thanks for wasting my quota on this non 320kbps album.
,jew_green,2011-06-30T05:00Z,"@rpgmaker

From what I know, v0 is in the 200s range, and by definition cannot be better than 320kpbs.

Regardless, this rip is not 320kpbs."
,USAofTPB,2011-11-29T18:42Z,Thanks! Downloaded at about 500kb/s. Not bad for 45 seeders! Quality is fine nothing to complain about. I will seed until 10.0 ratio. You should do the same. 
,f1tch,2012-03-18T17:18Z,"@ryan_syek enjoying a band like water in your lungs would mean that you don't enjoy them.

this rip is 256vbr not 320."
