,samsayit,2010-02-21T23:32Z,"This is awesome! I have been looking for this and was stunned there was no such available even on the DVD source.

A tip some may find useful:
I just made a very HQ rip of my DVD to use with my media server. However my copy was NTSC/23.976 FPS. 
So the subs posted here would not be in sync since this rip is PAL/25 FPS.
I opened the subs in Subtitle Workshop, changed Input FPS to 25 and set output FPS to 23.976 and saved. Now they are in perfect sync.

Thanks for the hard work on this!!!"

It's amazing that you squeezed almost 3 hr. movie in 895 MB without any compromise on quality.
Hats off, pal. 
Audio/Video = 10/10 and the movie too is 10/10.
Once again, thanks a lot and Keep 'em coming mate..."
