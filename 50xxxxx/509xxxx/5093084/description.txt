The Longest Day - the most spectacular war movie ever filmed.

While there were plenty of Longest Day sub rips available, there seemed to be none with JUST the French and German speaking parts. So, using Sub Magic I lovingly edited out all the English speaking subtitles... and corrected quite a few OCR errors.

Enjoy.
