At CERN, the Large Hadron Collider accelerator is performing a run to search for the Higgs boson. The experiment has a unique side effect: the entire human race loses its consciousness for about two minutes. During that time, nearly everyone sees themselves in the future (by about 21 years). Each individual experiences their own future through the senses of their future self. This "flash forward" results in several deaths and accidents involving vehicles, aircraft, and any other device needing human control at the time of the experiment.

TV adaptation

FlashForward, based loosely on the novel, will air on ABC in Fall 2009. It differs from the novel by following non-scientists, including lead character Mark Benford (Joseph Fiennes), and changing the "flash forward" from 21 years to six months.
