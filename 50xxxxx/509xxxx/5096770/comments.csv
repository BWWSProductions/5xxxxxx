Issue #2: 50 bestest Halloween songs. You have 20 sings in the torrent, 20 songs listed in the details and one of them is zip-a-dee-doo-dah and #20 is end? End of what. I so hope this was a joke torrent."

good...better...best

there is no such superlative as bestest.   But there is to a child.   At whom this album is aimed.

Adjectives of three or more syllables are governed by that rule of no bestest.


As for the song content:

zip-a-dee-doo-dah...

...I point you in the direction of Stephen King and
Agatha Christie...

novels they both wrote whose titles had to be changed

i'll let you work it out for yourself


have fun tar baby

and i should point out that i did not name this
upload; it is the title given on the front cover of the album.


and i did not change the songs on the album.

it was not a joke torrent.

i hope Brooke grows up to have more fuckin' sense than you do.

and you also need lessons in the use of the apostrophe."

,hillneerg,2010-10-10T23:27Z,"Yes, this is an ""enhanced"" CD with just 20 audio tracks.
The ""enhanced"" bit means you have video and PC stuff on it as well (games, singalongs stories etc).
Only the actual audio tracks have been ripped here.
Your kids will still love it. :)"
