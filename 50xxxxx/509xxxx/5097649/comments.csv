,Bombardem,2009-09-23T15:40Z,like you would put an imdb link in it if you could...
,Dakenz,2009-09-23T19:26Z,"yea seriously, like any information would be good, as it stands on IMDB there is NO Full Length Film called ""Fragments"" that has been released for or in 2009, all of the ones listed are just shorts, however there are about 3 films with the same name that came out last year which could mean that it is : ((DRAMA!!!! AKA WINGED CREATURES)) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0948547/ or maybe this one (( French Comedy??)) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0757201/ then again it could possibly be the last Full Length (w/the same name) from 2008 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1161859/ which is  Horror that has a rather high rating art the moment, but at any rate, Bindass, can you at the very least give a idea just what this one is I gave you the links so just check 'em out please. Thanks"
