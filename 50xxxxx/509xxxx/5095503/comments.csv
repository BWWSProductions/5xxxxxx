,stilljacktwenty,2009-09-21T21:34Z,"Can't say I've ever had a specific problem with any of eztv's torrents,(and thanks for uploading, man) but right now, there are supposed to be 6285 seeders, I'm connected to 39 out of a possible 1442, and it's downloading at a roaring 2.1kB/s per sec. Hang on, it's just shot up to 2.8. No, it's 1.2., no, 0.2......"
