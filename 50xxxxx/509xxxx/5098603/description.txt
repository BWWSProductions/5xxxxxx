Upon request I am adding it to my torrent list to keep it alive.

It is a singular rar file of:
Closer To Home Archive - repack.7z
Jellystone Park Archive - repack.7z


Atarimax EXE Archive.7z
Homesoft Game Archive.7z
Vjetnam Atari 8-bit Game Archive.7z
  These are smaller, but very action packed game archives!


Atari800WinPlus 40.7z
  This is the final word in Atari 8-bit emulators for
windows. The OS Roms are contained within the included
PCXF25 (PC Xformer 2.5) Emulator. Other roms
can be found here and there around the web. Released by
Atari to the public domain.


Included Archivers:


PeaZip (peazip-2.1.bin.WINDOWS.exe)
  Used to Bust open the GZ/Tarballs and put them in
directories.


7-Zip (7z457.exe)
  Used to unzip to folders/files the old zips, and used to
make the .7z that contain the archives. (you'll need this)


Universal Extractor (uniextract15.exe)
  Used to un-arc those nasty old .ARCs the big archives had in
them. Nothing kills an 8-bit buzz than having to use the
emulator just to break open a stupid archive to play the
disk image therin. That is also why the internal .zips and
tarballs have been broken out.


I hope you enjoy this! I sure do!

And it's great for younger kids too and uses hardly any space.  (After unpacked of course)

This is just my second up so any advice or constructive criticism is appreciated.  I am just trying to give back to a great community.
