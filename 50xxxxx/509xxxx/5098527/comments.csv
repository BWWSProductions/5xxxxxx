Unfortunately, almost all the versions of Google Earth found around are are infected with some kind of trojans, and many of them aren't of the version they say, so it's a little bit of a mess to find something clean and *real*, so I'm happy with what I find, if it's clean. There are a lot of bad guys out there... ;-)"

,jersson,2009-09-24T19:42Z,Thank's for your answer and I know what you mean about the bad guy's. I'm happy your'e one of the good guy's out there. I've was just discovering Demonoid site and what is your opinion about that  and do you post appl there as well ?

I've tried demonoid a few times, and even if it's a little more difficult to get access there, still someone uploads infected programs there too. I still find myself more comfortable with TPB.
But it's OK, they also have a lot of new things that sooner or later will arrive also here. At least, it's always better to have a look in other places to find something that can be interesting..."
,jersson,2009-09-29T22:11Z,Thers a vers of Google Earth Pro 5.0.1133 on PB now. Could you make it portable ???
[V],NoExcuses,2009-10-02T19:15Z,"@jersson
All the versions found around have a Pro somewhere in the name, but none of them is so, at their best they are Plus. I was already uploading a Pro v4.2 Portable a while ago, and it's the only Pro version that I've seen up to now..."
,jersson,2009-10-04T03:13Z,"Yepp, you were right man, It was just the standard vers uploaded so I'm using your plus vers, Thank's youre a pro man"
