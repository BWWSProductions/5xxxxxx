Cowboy Bebop (ã‚«ã‚¦ãƒœãƒ¼ã‚¤ãƒ“ãƒãƒƒãƒ—, KaubÅi Bibappu?) is a Japanese anime series. Directed by ShinichirÅ Watanabe and written by Keiko Nobumoto, the series was produced by Sunrise in 1998. Its 26 episodes comprise a complete storyline: the series, set in 2071, follows the misadventures and tragedies of a group of bounty hunters, or "cowboys", traveling on their spaceship, the Bebop.

This is all 26 of the show's English Episodes, and two of the Japanese ones (they were only release in Japan) and also the OST.
