Rock â€˜nâ€™ roll drummer Joe (Dolph Lundgren, Universal Soldier, Rocky IV) and his band are about to make it big as the opening act for Americaâ€™s hottest pop star (Melissa Smith) in Moscow. Fame and glory quickly turn into chaos as armed terrorists storm the arena, capturing the pop star and the guests of honorâ€”Russian President Alexander Petrov and his two teenage daughters. With the death toll rising and the hostagesâ€™ lives on the line, it is up to one man to come to their rescue and save the day. Nonstop action, hand-to-hand combat and a rock â€˜nâ€™ roll edge make COMMAND PERFORMANCE a jam-packed hit.
