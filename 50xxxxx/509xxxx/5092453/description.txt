THE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, UNRELEASED VERSION OF IMPALER. 

This was only seen at Film Festivals. This is the version NOT released to the public. This is one of the best independent documentaries made in the past 5 years.

Jonathon "The Impaler" Sharkey threw himself into the race for Minnesota Governor on January 13, 2006. His thirteen point platform included helping farmers, improving the public school system, and advocating for better benefits for United States veterans. However, it was his "coming out" to the media as a Hecate Witch, Satanic Dark Priest and Sanguinary Vampire that grabbed Jonathon National and International attention. His candidacy marked the beginning of the largest amount of media coverage ever given to an unknown third party candidate running for Governor in American history.
