Demonoid is still down so you get to join in the fun with no user Ratio control, so no seeds and I will take this down after a week or so, download and run on this one at your own risk.

The Iso is up on this site and due to poor or no seeds took me 4 days to download sigh...  I have split the Iso back into tracks and the original VOB files and tagged them so they are good to go.

Video DJ's have no use for physical media and an ISO file is not a lot of use and no one in there right mind would attempt to use DVD or Blu Ray players to do a Video Discotheque.  They are too slow and hopeless to cue up.

So we play individual tracks from a hard disc.  One day the Record industry will catch up, until they do well we have bit torrent and people like myself!

See files for track listings.

Enjoy.
