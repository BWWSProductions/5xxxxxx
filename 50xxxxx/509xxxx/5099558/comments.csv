I mean you torents is very good but if you put them in 1920x1080 it will be perfect."
,imsharing,2009-10-15T01:49Z,y is is it so big of a file? i mean i no its bluray but a whole dulayer size?
,Dizzious,2010-04-06T04:19Z,"imsharing - It's high-definition, genius. HD movies have big file sizes... That's the trade off - you either have crappy quality and a small file, or you have awesome quality and a big file. 

Cinema09 - the reason for the 800 pixel vertical resolution is probably because it was ripped from a letterbox formatted original, and the person who ripped it was probably smart enough to crop out the black letterbox bars in order to cut down on file size a little.  That's what I would think, anyway... "
