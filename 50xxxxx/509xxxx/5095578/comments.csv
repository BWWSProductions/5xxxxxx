,Smithcraft,2009-09-23T09:01Z,"Johnny, you have any screenshots of this one? The US DVD was notorious for having a messed up aspect ratio, so I'm wondering how this one looks."
,Smithcraft,2009-09-23T21:52Z,Sweet! I'll have to put it in my queue.
,Smithcraft,2009-09-24T09:33Z,The image quality is great on this one! Thanks for sharing it with us Jonny!
,rippervanwinkle,2011-06-24T11:51Z,"Image quality overall is excellent, no problems with aspect ratio.  But there is a cropping error: small black bar across the top.  It's minor and many people won't mind or even notice, though if you watch it borderless it becomes obvious and if you scale it down encoding for a device you will probably get an edge artefact.  Here is an uncompressed .png screenshot so you can see for yourself.
