Release Info:

Will Freeman is a hip Londoner who one day realizes that 
his friends are all involved with the responsibilities of married 
life and that leaves him alone in the cold. Passing himself off as 
a single father, he starts to meet a string of single mums, confident 
in his ability to leave them behind when they start to ask for a 
commitment. But Will's hope of a continued bachelorhood is interrupted 
when he meets 12-year old Marcus, in many ways his complete opposite.
