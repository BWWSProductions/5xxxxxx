,jlsmetalhead,2009-12-25T03:18Z,"Thanks. Never Did Make A Copy Before I Deleted It, Oops My Bad."
,ImmenseBeing,2009-12-29T00:25Z,"Awesome quality, works on PS3."
,megatrends,2009-12-30T06:21Z,"Super quality, just watched on an HD TV and still it looked good using my Divx encoded HDMI upconverted dvd player. Great sound as well through the surround system here.

Nice job man!"
,Slein01,2010-01-06T17:35Z,"Hey first of all i want to say thanks for the upload, i always trust your work extremezone....
But to all leechers out there, WTF is with the seeding...started off nice and fast but get to 98.9% and it fucking slowed right down to 06.0k, and the upload is only meant to be 1.37gib but yet i have downloaded 1.50 so far.



Oh and to any fucknut out there that wants to tell me, dont complain its free blah blah...
well you stupid dumb fucks, unless you get your internet connection and downloads for free... IT AINT FUCKING FREE!!! "
,Breyvan,2010-01-08T15:31Z,"This works great, great dvd quality and good download time - thanks for adding the cd cover too!"
,badassbarada,2010-01-11T08:18Z,"Weird,

On computer, this may be the best download I've had quality-wise.  However, audio doesn't burn to DVD despite it being an .avi file like every other movie I have had no issues with.  Picture looks great even on the 60"" HDTV, but without audio, I can only watch it on my computer.  :("
,pvnrt4,2010-01-12T01:38Z,"A=10

,carlitosbob,2010-01-16T08:45Z,"@badassbarada, just connect your PC to the HDTV."

,musicman1105,2010-02-23T18:27Z,Great Movie - Great Quality - Thanks
,takenlife,2010-03-03T21:04Z,"No audio. Good Quality Video though.
Not worth download."
,blackcoldice,2010-03-16T21:39Z,"ok ok ok... listen... i read all the comments and took a chance to download it and i was disappointed... the video was the best ever however you dont hear the actor's voices only the sound effects! i tried different players and nothing only the sound effects...

the video quality is perfect but without the voices (only sound effects) it is useless :("
,NaughtyXT,2010-03-17T22:09Z,"Great quality picture, but low audio.
Enjoyable movie though. Thanks"
,AngelDeakins,2010-03-20T23:23Z,"Okay so here's the deal... To anyone who is reading these comments and see all the ones about ""There's no sound"" or ""You can't hear the voices"" Well... That would be because they don't have the proper codec's. I'm using VLC Media player and if need be, use the K-Lite Codec pack that you can easily find and download. The sound and video on this download is SUPERB. I almost never leave comments but this video seriously deserves my respect. - Extremezone, this DVDRip you left for us is awesome. Never had such superb quality before."
,jhil_sani,2010-04-29T16:26Z,nice
,Zvon,2010-05-11T06:34Z,"A heads up to those it may concern.
This is being tracked.
Just got a notification from my ISP.

I dont feel it would be fair to say that without also  thanking extremezone for making this available, even with the hassle I mentioned above. 
Great copy. Loved it.
This is a movie I will buy someday, just cannot afford it atm.
So suck mah balls Paramount & Comcast!

,vincent_gerome,2010-05-23T17:00Z,thank you!
,68wolff,2010-08-12T08:36Z,"Thanks.

No blocking of this torrent for my download."
,esostigma,2010-08-30T08:36Z,-=-=-=-==-=  this is being watched by paramount.  i got a notice from them the next day after dln'g..  beware.
,FXMovies,2010-08-31T09:24Z,"Watch Out Guys This Is Being Tracked!!!

what is the difference between trusted and vip?

i dl'd this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5095856/...p_XviD-MAX

it was marked as 'vip'. i got a notice from paramount for copyright infringement the next day. From Suprbay Forum!"
,LordAugastus,2010-09-11T18:45Z,"how does this tracking by holliwood work? plz tell me, i want to download,
 but a afraid of getting IP tracked...etc
also what can they do if you downloaded the torrent?"
,English_Steve,2010-10-17T00:47Z,"All as you get is a letter from your ISP calling you a nuaghty boy. If you use Peerguardian or Peerblock they don't know cause they can't see what you are downloading.

To all you muppets with no sound! Download the right codecs FFS! Try the CCCP codec pack, plays fucking anything."
,scottbuds,2010-11-19T14:54Z,"EXCELLENT quality,,  Great Movie !   Thanks !"
,DjHopies,2010-12-24T21:04Z,"Works Fine Downloads Fine,
No Sound With Realplayer Or Divx, Sound + Video Works With VLC Media Player"
,Jacob3087,2011-01-13T01:19Z,"If your having issues burning it to a dvd, just play it on your computer, put it on fullscreen, grab your computers monitor cord, and hook one end to your laptop or computer, then the other to your flat screen TV and you just have to change what channel its on..  HDMI is normally cable or w/e you have, then PC/AV is what your computer would be..  If you want to make it so your laptops screen is off hold down FN and press F5 or F6 until its only on the TV screen."
,kingjim007,2011-01-30T09:10Z,"AWESOME copy man thanks!

Blew me away through the Plasma and Surround sound...knocked a few holes in the wall.

Best quality download don't bother with any other version."
,sharpsh00ter155,2011-03-05T21:41Z,"this torrent is being tracked, beware.  paramount will send you an email, have no idea what they might do about it."
,Outland41,2011-03-17T01:45Z,"Worst fucking shit-fest of a film ever. Didn't even finish watching it.

Rant aside: extremezone, as always, deserves a huge thanks for supplying this it.

Cheers extremezone."

,nath6023,2011-05-04T17:54Z,"I cant beleive there is comments about no sound. If you can use utorrent and download files, surely you can't be stupid enough to know how to install codecs.... K-lite plays all that i have come across. Please don't comments if your that stupid. Thanks for the movie. I havn't downloaded it yet, but i'm sure it will work fine."
,nath6023,2011-05-04T17:58Z,"@ Slein01. Go and buy the DVD then dick head. Either way, regardless of how much you pay for your net connection, don't waste bandwidth complaining like a little faggot. You just wasted 2 comment slot's. 1 for your bitching, and 2 for me telling you so."
