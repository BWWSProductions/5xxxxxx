[T],IndianChristian,2009-09-21T17:12Z,These people's head needs to be examined for mental deficiencies.
,piratebooty,2009-09-21T17:37Z,"Indeed IndianChristian, they do.

Good of you to post a nice cartoon to keep them occupied until the men in white coats arrive though."
,jiveclive,2009-09-21T17:38Z,"Could not agree with you more emphatically, IndianChristian. I been saying this for years already. Pity Jesus Christ, the man told people try to be decent to each other, try to love their neighbor as themselves, and they took his message, turned it into total bollocks, and slapped his name on it. And those fuckups think he's gonna come back. Yeah, right. As if. He favored the simple life, but he wasn't that fuckin' simple. "
