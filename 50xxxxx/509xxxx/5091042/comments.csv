,sauceofsauce,2009-09-18T17:21Z,Bricktop thanks to you and the PS3 Team for uploading all of the movies over the past months.  I have downloaded over 100 Blu-Ray movies.  I upload at 4 times the speed I upload.  Takes me about 2-6 days to get a complete download so over that time I believe that a lot of people get the movie from me.  Thanks so much.  FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
