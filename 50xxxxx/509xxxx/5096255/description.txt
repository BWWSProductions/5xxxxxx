Ueki is just an average junior high student who has the power to change trash into trees. This power was given to him by Koba-sen so that Ueki can participate in the "Battle of the Supernatural Powers". If Ueki wins, then Koba-sen becomes the new King of the Celestial World while Ueki will receive the "Talent of Blank", allowing him to choose whatever talent he desires. However, the battle will not be easy since he will have to face may unsavory opponents who want the "Talent of Blank" for their own selfish reasons. Ueki will undergo many trials and sacrifices in order to win the battle and prevent the "Talent of Blank" from falling into the wrong hands.
