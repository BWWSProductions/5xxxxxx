,c0mmun15tm4n,2009-10-02T15:27Z,"tried reinstalling,

no luck

*CRASH*

i dont even get up to any screens, just click on exe either in folder or on desktop and BOOM. crash

i got xp 32 bit btw, not any of that Vista UAC shit

i really wanted to play this as well :/"
,c0mmun15tm4n,2009-10-02T15:31Z,"do you *REALLY* need the *LATEST* 7zip or equiv? cause i use an older version of Winrar (from a while back, doesnt even read .isos like the new winrar does)

do you think thats the problem?

oh and when i install, its in J:tropico pretty much, except when i use the setup thingy, it gets stuck on 30, so i double click it again, while the old ones up, and it continues on. when it is done, i have loads of random files outside of the folder, on the J drive itself (instead of in the tropico folder, which came with the extraction of the rar) i have tried copying them into every location in the folders of tropico, to no luck

the directx update thingy worked fine, so, its not that



HELPHELPHELPHELPHELPHELPHELPHELPHELPHELP"
,c0mmun15tm4n,2009-10-02T16:08Z,"oh come on

WHAT THE FUCK!?

got newest 7zip

still crash crash crash.

l2 make a good rip shroo"
,fleetkid,2009-10-03T06:35Z,"Works fine :)

I have never had any problems with Shroo's torrents.

Thanks Shroo, because of people like you, I get to play all the games I like. Can't afford to buy each one of them.

Noob special instructions:

1. Use latest Winrar to extract the files to a partition with 5 GB free space

2. Run setup.bat (Run it as Admin, just in case) 

3. Press Esc (escape) key in TPTB splash video to close the TPTB splash video

4. Press any key in the command window to start extraction

5. Wait (this is the important part), wait before complaining it is hanging or whatever. It will take a while at some points like at 30%. Just check the disk space used and it will be increasing.

6. Let DirectX update. Be connected to the internet.

7. Go to the installation folder and run ""tropico3.exe""

8. If you see a black screen with only the cursor, don't panic. Wait for the game video to start.

9. When asked for serial TYPE in the serial with the '-' symbols too.

10. Play the tutorial and learn to be a dictator. Have fun and thank Shroo :)"
,c0mmun15tm4n,2009-10-03T07:05Z,"i have nver had a TPTB problem from shroo yet either,


so, you say that despite hanging on 30%, it is actually working?


i rescind all previous statements at shroo, until i test this (my reasoning behind it doing nothing is that at previous levels it tells you what its doing, while 30% doesnt do that)"
,fleetkid,2009-10-03T07:23Z,"Ya it does keep going... Just check your disk usage. Until there is continuous change in that there is no problem... 
"
,c0mmun15tm4n,2009-10-03T12:54Z,"got it working, took several HOURS of being left alone.

:/

ALL HAIL SHROO.
"
,bigturd,2009-10-03T14:31Z,Worked great until the game auto-patched itself and the serial is now blacklisted.
,Mikesmith08,2009-10-03T16:50Z,"I've installed it all properly and got the game working, but I cant see any buildings or people, just the trees and plants. I've tried it on all settings and still I cant see any of the buildings, please help!!!!"
,fleetkid,2009-10-03T19:52Z,"Played about 3 missions. Nice game. 

@c0mmun15tm4n: Maybe you have a slower PC or a lower RAM. Mine took about 20 minutes

@bigturd: Just block the game from going online with a firewall (after you re-install)

@Mikesmith08: I am not exactly sure of what caused the problem. Try to follow the steps. Also let the vc and DIrectX install when the command window is at 95%. Make sure you use the latest Winrar. And before you do this, try playing the game with minimum video detail level. 
"
,c0mmun15tm4n,2009-10-04T03:17Z,"i have very little  (DDR1!!!) ram.

my computer is in serious need of update anyway...


BTW: TO ALL. THE SERIAL IS NOW BLOCKED, IF YOU PUT IT IN PREVIOUSLY AND IT WORKED, BLOCK TROPICO WITH YOUR FIREWALL, OR GO ON OFFLINE.

TO ALL NEW PEOPLE, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE TO DO, SORRY (maybe this version lets the serial in, but then doesnt work after it patches? then just block tropico)"
,spag007,2009-10-04T17:34Z,"has anyone come up with a new, working serial?"
,bloodlust69,2009-10-25T01:25Z,"any figure out the trick mine freezes at 45.8% i tried leaving it for 4 hours and it just sits there no change in disk space, also tried closeing it and restarting the setup file and it does save any of the previous unpacked data"
,bloodlust69,2009-10-25T01:51Z,"ok i figured it out, must use latest 7zip i used latest winzip and it wouldnt work so i used 7zip and it works fine now  thx for the game"
,Chiva$,2009-10-26T23:22Z,"i'm also having the weird crushes
i must say i rarely had any problems with the game rips i downloaded (btw Shroo, nice job for all the latest releases, thank you!), still this time the game crushes for no apparent reason (the installation went smoothly and i did use 7zip, latest directx and latest graphic drivers)
another thing i noticed was that the serial wouldn't work after installing the game and running it, but after patching it i had no problems with the key, so i must say i didn't try for any crashes before installing the patch"
,Miika.270,2009-11-12T19:31Z,Damn serial key doesn´t work.
,fruitkbob,2009-12-15T07:14Z,"downloaded torrent.
unzipped with latest 7zip.
ran setup.
disconnected from the internet and entered the serial code.
started a new game and all people and buildings were gone but trees and stuff were there like normal.
PLZ help!!"
,ProEire,2009-12-17T18:17Z,"Hello.
First off, thank you very much for this!

But I'm having a pretty big problem.

 After a few days of downloading and learning what to do (downloading torrents and all, I'm new to it) I finally got it installed and working.

 The thing is, whenever I try to play a game (campaign,sandbox etc) it will go to a loading screen before shortly crashing.

I'm not sure what to do to fix this. Any help?

Thanks again :)

,ncc46537,2010-03-07T01:14Z,"I just left it extracting while I went to school...
Came back, it was done.
Working perfectly on Windows 7 32 bit system."
,ncc46537,2010-03-07T01:18Z,"ProEire, right-click the icon and select ""Properties.""
Then go to ""Compatibility"" and select ""Run this program as an administrator.""

If that does not work, turn off Windows UAC.
Google how to turn it off if you don't know."
