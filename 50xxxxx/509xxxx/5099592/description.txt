The best days of your life become your worst nightmare in Tormented, a high school comedy with a very sinister twist. At the exclusive Fairview High grammar school all is not what it seems, although you wouldnâ€™t tell from its seemingly normal veneer. With a budding romance between head girl Justine Fielding (Tuppence Middleton) and popular hunk Alexis (Dimitri Leonidas) blossoming for the whole school to see, a sinister undercurrent begins to sweep through the halls. Alexis is a part of a group of friends headed by Bradley (Alex Pettyfer); a clique who victimise the weaker kids for sadistic pleasure. One such victim was poor Darren Mullett (Calvin Dean) bullied so badly during the previous summer, he took his own life in order to escape their diabolical onslaught. Now, with a newfound confidence and absolutely nothing left to lose, Darren is back from the dead to take his revenge in the most bloody and inventive ways.
