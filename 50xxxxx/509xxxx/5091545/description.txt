These are original, untouched recordings.   So you will have
to ignore the crackles, hisses, pops, etc.   Bear in mind
that these are quite old.

You will also have to ignore the bum notes that fly like
empty beer-bottles at a Donnybrook.
   Look it up if you don't know.


I'm going back to my beer and red wine.
