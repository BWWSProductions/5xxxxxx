,hitaho,2009-10-24T14:35Z,"I unpacked and ran the Encore ENG Start.exe as instructed in the readme. After the MS Paint cracker splash screen, I get these two dialogue boxes, which I cannot read since I don't speak Korean.

After clicking OK on the second one, nothing happens, Encore doesn't start."
