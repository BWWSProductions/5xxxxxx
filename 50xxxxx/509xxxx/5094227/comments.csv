,ulfhenry,2009-09-20T12:08Z,What is this?? How to burn??
,stupido-dk,2009-09-20T12:35Z,Would also like to know how it works
,qumahlin,2009-09-20T21:13Z,"its a demo just like it says.  You burn it the same way you would burn any 360 demo which means just putting the entire directory onto a DVDR

Two seconds of googling would have answered this, when did everyone on piratebay become incapble"
,stupido-dk,2009-09-20T21:40Z,"qumahlin: Guess I'm pretty ""incapble"" cause i've tried 3 times and my xbox just calls it a mixed media dvd. But thanks for the help ;)"
,qumahlin,2009-09-20T23:56Z,"@stupido-dk

With the disc in the drive go to your game library, then goto game demos.  You'll see it in the list, you don't start it from the DVD like a normal game.

Google man, google!"
,Rick360,2009-09-21T06:16Z,"You might need to unplug the network connecting if it doesn't work. I remember they blocked resident evil 5 demos from loading that way.  Disconnecting from live would fix it.

If you run into problems give that a shot.  Thanks for the up I can't wait to try!"
,stupido-dk,2009-09-21T08:41Z,"qumahlin : I did know that, but my problem was i burned a DVD with a folder callede ""Partition 3"" at the root. So thats why it did'nt show up at the xbox. I have now burned it with the ""content"" folder at the root of the dvd and i works, beside it frezzes, but thats proberly just a reburn with lower speed. "
,Rick360,2009-09-24T20:12Z,"Dammit.  I waited until the release of the demo for those that didn't preorder(or those that pre ordered at blockbuster like me...)  To save a DVD.  But apparently, since I'm only 17 and 11 months old I can't DL it.  And my extra account that's 18 can't get it because it doesn't have xbox gold.  

Thanks for the upload.  Will seed."

Happy birthday in advance. 


Awesome demo. Seriously, I wasn't going to buy it till I played the demo now I can't wait for it."
