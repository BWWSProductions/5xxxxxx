United States President Lex Luthor uses the oncoming trajectory of a Kryptonite meteor to frame Superman and declare a $1 billion bounty on the heads of the Man of Steel and his â€˜partner in crimeâ€™, Batman. Heroes and villains alike launch a relentless pursuit of Superman and Batman, who must uniteâ€”and recruit helpâ€”to try and stave off the action-packed onslaught, stop the meteor, and uncover Luthorâ€™s devious plot to take command of far more than the United States.
