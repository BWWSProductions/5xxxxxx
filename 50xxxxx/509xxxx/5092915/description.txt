THE NEW SEASON BEGINGS :D

Snowboarding has a new video project, itâ€™s called Videograss, and itâ€™s here to help you ignore the urge to hit that skip button. We put all the parts you were skipping to and from and threw them into one video. Videograss remembers that a snowboard video is made to watch. With watchibility in mind you wonâ€™t have to sit through painful heli on heli action or all slow-mo video parts. Videograss just lets the snowboarding, music, and lifestyles of those involved tell the story and move the video forward.
Justin Meyer, Sean McCormick, and Jan Snarski have been following around some of snowboardingâ€™s loosest and brutally real snowboarders including Nick Dirks, Darrell Mathes, Justin Bennee, Laurent-Nicolas Paquin, Mikey Leblanc, Louie Paradise, Ben Bilocq, Jonas Michilot, Jake Olson-Elm, Alex Cantin, Aaron Biittner, Keegan Vailaka, Desiree Melancon, and Laura Hadar

Enjoy the new 2010 release.
