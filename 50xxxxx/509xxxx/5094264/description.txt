In his tragically short lifetime (1946-1990), Oleg Kagan established himself as one of the world's great violinists. Yuri Bashmet is universally regarded as one of the greatest living violists; and of course, the late Sviatoslav Richter was one of the handful of greatest classical pianists of the 20th century. Kagan and Richter had a 20-year association performing and recording together. Original 1985 recording.

1-5 Symphony No. 5 in D major, Op. 47

-------------- Artists -------------
Composed by Dmitry Shostakovich
Performed by National Symphony Orchestra
Conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich 

Mstislav Rostropovich was a friend of the composer, and his performances of the Shostakovich'S 5 symphonY IS uniquely authoritative. It's true that as a conductor the great cellist has had his ups and downs, but unlike so many far less musical personalities, he has only recorded the music that he feels most passionately about, and the results have been generally impressive.
