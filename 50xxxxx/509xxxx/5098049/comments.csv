0,1% in 1 hour is not good :/"
,MM2007,2009-09-26T13:52Z,"Awesome!  Installed perfectly.

I plan on replacing the MSO2007 Blue Editions I have on the rest of my computers with this.  Looks great and runs smoother than the original retail MSO.

Thanks for your great work!"
,huntermckiller,2009-09-27T23:26Z,"Works fine.

the classic menu annoyed me (just because I'm used to the new style ones now) but you can disable them anyway."
,Ximbalo,2009-09-28T22:44Z,Thanks for the share.  Great work!
,VarikasTD,2009-09-29T02:43Z,"Every time I try to open a Word Doc or an Excel spreadsheet, I get the ""Preparing to install"" pop up.

I ran the initial install as administrator, as suggested.

Anyone know why it does this and how to stop it?"
,bytor10464,2009-09-29T23:15Z,"Seems to run clean and virus-free!  The updates DO take a damned long time, though, like you said.... In any event, Thanks for putting this out there!!!"
,Kamidora,2009-09-29T23:37Z,I have 10 days notice of Office 2007  genuine advantage warning. No crack seems to stop this. Will this reinstall 2007 and remove this notice
,krytenthesmug,2009-10-01T03:21Z,"I also get an error ""The application cannot start"", and then back to ""Configuring MS Office"". So far it has been doing this for 6 hours...

Also one off the .dll files contains a trojan."
,aett,2009-10-02T20:58Z,"Just instelled this yesterday and i chose to not install the addon (which I don't remember the name on) that had something to do with storing data online on some site, just felt suspicious to me.
Any how, it updates to SP2 with no problems and still no GA message bugging me, nice."
,mystical_being,2009-10-04T11:16Z,"So there is only a setup.exe file.
Does that mean no crack is required or I have to get a crack from somewhere else?
Thanks!"
,VarikasTD,2009-10-04T17:56Z,"Found out what my issue was. I also had Visual Studio 8 Pro installed and that was causing issues with Office 2007. Uninstalled both, reinstalled Office 2007 and put Visual Studio in a virtual machine. Issue fixed!"
,VarikasTD,2009-10-04T17:58Z,"Forgot to mention that on the reinstall I did last night, the Classic Menu addin now comes up with a ""your trial period has expired"" message, which it didn't have before. Just uninstall it from the control panel and you won't have that issue anymore."
,Vil75,2009-10-06T17:01Z,Forgive my stupidity here but this is Office 97 not some dire Openoffice.org item is it.
,Vil75,2009-10-06T17:06Z,Ahhh should have read the FAQ. Sounds perfect just what I need.  Currently using my very ancient Office 2000 (real copy (honestly it is)) and it just doesn't cut the mustard
,scottsrake,2009-10-06T23:22Z,"Okay so it was working perfectly, then today everytime i use it, it  tells me i need a liscne name and liscence code and that it is not free.

,Dutchkip,2009-10-10T08:55Z,"Yeah same here, was working okay and today it asks me for a license name and code.

Found it !!

Delete the folder classic menu for office in the program files, it is an add in program that's causing the problem.
I've removed the folder and it works perfect now."

,AndIfAllElseFails,2009-11-09T20:28Z,"this is great, man! thanks"
,fleetkid,2009-11-10T09:32Z,"Guys if you are just going for the Black theme, just follow the instructions:

1. Open any of the MS Office 2007 application like Word, Excel or PowerPoint. 

2. Click the Office button on the extreme upper left corner of the application. At the bottom you will see Word Options or Excel Options or PowerPoint Options depending on what application you have opened. Click the Options and under the Popular tab, you will find the Color Scheme. Change the color between the available colors (Blue, Silver and Black) and Click OK.

Thx !!!"

,vailenvv88,2009-11-13T19:11Z,"Hi, sorry to bother again. 

Language change still doesn´t work. Also with v2.

I change the ""Primary Editing language"" to German (which the program offers) - it says upon the next start it will perform the change - but it doesn´t. 

Any idea why? What else can I do to change to language into German. 

Thx again !!
