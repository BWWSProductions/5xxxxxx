[T],thegreenfrog,2009-11-10T07:29Z,"I use zips because there are way too many images for a torrent to handle really well. Some torrents will refuse to upload on TPB if there are too many files inside.

By the way, the pictures are not compressed, merely packed. They are poured into a single file without changes. There would be no point in compressing files that are already in a highly compressed format (jpg).

It makes the file a little smaller and easier for me to handle.

If you wish to pick and choose the files you want, I suggest you get a subscription to you know what.
