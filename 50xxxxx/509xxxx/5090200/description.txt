Todd Agnew - Reflection of Something
by Todd Agnew, John Hampton (Producer) 

Everything we see is a reflection of something: photons flying through the air as certain wavelengths bounce off, while others are absorbed into every bit of material around us.

Everything we say is a reflection fo something: our background, our experiences, our thoughts, our feelings.

Everything we do is a reflection of something: the sum total of our likes and dislikes, the culmination of our interests and pursuits, the manifestation of actions both conscious and hidden.

Throughout his two-year journey in the artist's life brought on by his debut album Grace Like Rain, Todd Agnew has taken ample opportunity to analyze the reasons and the motivations behind the things he sees, says, and does, and has channeled them into the dozen songs chronicling the Christian existence for his Ardent Records sophomore release.

Everything you'll hear is a Reflection of Something.

Experiencing Reflection of Something compels you to move. Moving you to sing praises, weep in worship, or fall at the feet of Jesus. Todd applies his signature gritty and passionate vocal delivery to penetrating, emotional songs, leading the listener to a place of thoughtful introspection.
