Visual Basic 6 Xtensions Package
--------------------------------

This is some extensions for the Visual Basic 6 programming language:

- Registration Manipulation Classes:
  Easy-to-use class library for reading and editing the registry.

- PowerDLL2:
  Read description below.


Description for PowerDLL2:
This is a code-library, that I made for 3 main reasons:
- Extend the functionality of Visual Basic,
- Create a lot of often-used functions to save time,
- Enhance already existing functions to run faster and smoother.

This DLL-file is an ActiveX DLL, which means that VB (and all other Visual Studio-products) will automatically load the framework from this file. In other words, you just have to link this file into your project, then all functions are available right away.

There is no manual. There never will be. But the functions all have a name that sort of explains what it does.

This version will work with all Windows-versions, but is primarily made for Windows XP.

Known bugs:
- The Hotkey-module doesn't work. I did some messy code, and decided to leave it.

I have included all the source, for anyone interested.

I have discontinued work on this project, and started on a new version, which will be made on a completely new framework, and will be optimized for Windows 7.
This new version is still underway, progress is being made in my speed.
A brief listing of some of the features to come:
- Support for themes. VB6 will no longer look like a Win9x-application.
- Support for unlimited numbers. I am creating a new datatype, called SuperInt, that is only limited by the amount of RAM you got.

Feel free to comment, if you find anything that you feel I should know about... :)
