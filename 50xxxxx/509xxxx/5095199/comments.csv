- how absolutely, fantastically, utterly, stupefyingly RIDICULOUS...."
,voyeurman,2009-09-21T11:38Z,what do u mean it dont work? can anybody else confirm this please?

,Mekena,2009-09-26T05:29Z,"Oh...so all the eyewitnesses, they didn't see a plane after all?"
,flyspitter,2009-09-27T01:48Z,"What about the people who said they thought they saw a missle?  What about the people who stated it wasn't an ordinary plane because it had no windows?  Why didn't the news let them speak.  Why did they use insiders from the news industry, people who were in their high-rises but no view and even attest that they didn't see what hit the buildings?

,asdhokker,2010-03-04T14:11Z,"thanks for this. gonna watch after downloading...

i'd just point out that the video which showed the cocpit falling out the other side was fake and planes exterior is made out of DURaluminium, which is very light, but very strong at the same time"
,flyspitter,2010-04-13T01:28Z,"asdhokker, you didn't see the official video with the nose of the plane exiting the building?  Newscasters even mentioned it!  Whats interesting is that all the computer simulations of the official theory show the plane getting completely shredded as soon as it enters the building which makes sense because the plane is made from aluminum and the vertical walls of the building were thick boxed steel columns.  So how does the nose of an aluminum plane enter the building then the nose exit the building?  I think this video has some really interesting points that you should watch more carefully."
