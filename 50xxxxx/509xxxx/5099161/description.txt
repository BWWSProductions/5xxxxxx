The New Age of Walmart
David Faber goes back inside the controversial powerhouse, exposing how, in today's economy, Walmart has re-invented itself. Premieres Sept 23 at 9P ET

Five years ago CNBC's David Faber took an unprecedented look inside the world's largest retailer. Since then, much has changed. A brutal onslaught of lawsuits, intense criticism and a plummeting stock price have resulted in re-invention at the largest company in the world. Today thereâ€™s new leadership at the top, major store renovations and a newfound focus on environmentally friendly policies.  

So far, it looks like Walmartâ€™s new image campaign is working. While many companies are cutting back or going bankrupt in the midst of recession, Walmart continues to grow -- outperforming its major competitors. 

But are the changes Walmart has undergone substantial onesâ€¦ or merely slick public relations ploys?  And what challenges does the giant retailer face as it continues its aggressive expansion?

CNBC's Emmy Award winning anchor and reporter David Faber investigates The New Age of Walmart.
