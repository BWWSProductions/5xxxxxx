Full Circle is the upcoming album by American post-grunge band Creed.[4] It will be Creed's first release since their 2004 compilation album Greatest Hits, their first studio album since 2001's Weathered, and the first to feature original bassist Brian Marshall in almost exactly a decade. The record was produced by Howard Benson. The album was completed on July 31 as announced by Scott Stapp. Four days later, the album cover was revealed through the band's official e-news.

So far, sixteen track titles have been confirmed, and the first single was released digitally on August 25, 2009. Stapp has said that most of the album will also be heavier than the past three Creed records. There are also going to be more guitar solos, as Mark Tremonti stated on his Twitter page that he is "very proud of the solos on this record".[5] An album release date of October 27, 2009 was finally confirmed on the official Creed website.
