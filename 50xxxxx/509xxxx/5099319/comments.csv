,funkboy27,2009-09-26T10:35Z,"I was wondering when this was going to show up on TPB.   I helped a bit in the making of this movie, and my good friends are the director and producer.

They worked really really hard on this film, so to those who torrent it, please enjoy it.  

If you enjoy the film, please support the filmmakers by renting or buying it.  It's available on Netflix and blockbuster.com and possibly your local rental shop.  Ask for them to stock it if it's not available.


Happy torrenting! :P

LLTPB! :)"
