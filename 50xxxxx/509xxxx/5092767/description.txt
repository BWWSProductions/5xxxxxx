This gripping tale, action-packed with relentless and brutal martial arts scenes, begins in 1881 as Chinese immigrants flood a mining valley eager to find their fortune. Contrary to their expectations, what they encountered was a lethal gang of betrayed brothers on a mission of vengeance. To fight for the honor of the people, one man must unleash the ancient art of Wushu. His actions cause the Four Dragons to engage in an epic battle in which only one side can win... and only one hero can emerge as the greatest martial artist of all.
