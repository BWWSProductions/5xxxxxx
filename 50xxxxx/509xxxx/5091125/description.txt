This Album is one out of "4 Rare 80s Albums [Part 76]" from 80zforever, but now with correct phasing between the stereo channels. At the originally uploaded Album "Relentless" the wrong phasing of the stereo channels is causing poor sound without any bass at all. 

I did no ID tagging again. So for tagging infos please refer to the original upload made by 80zforever.

80zforever, I hope you don't mind.
