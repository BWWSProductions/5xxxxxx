,vivatpb5776,2011-04-07T20:27Z,"First, to wolfe426, no where in this .torrent does the uploader reference that this the entire .torrent is a DVDRip. Only one file claims to be a DVDRip and unless you have the DVD and can create a better rip, shut the fuck up. Get your facts straight before you call someone out on something.

That being said, for those that care, make sure you read the description of each file. In episode 6 (two part episode), the first part is a VHSRip of piss poor quality and the second part claims to be a DVDRip of average to good quality."
