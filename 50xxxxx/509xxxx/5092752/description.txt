"Known for her hits "More Love," "Bette Davis Eyes," and "Crazy in the Night" as well as her duets with Kenny Rogers, Gene Cotton, James Ingram, Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand, Kim Carnes released Light House (often referred to as Lighthouse) in 1986, her final album for EMI Records. Produced by Val Garay (known for his work with such artists as Dolly Parton, Marty Balin, Linda Ronstadt and the Motels), the album reached No. 116 on the Pop Albums Chart. The single "Divided Hearts" peaked at No. 79 on the Pop Singles Chart. Reissued on CD for a time in Japan only, it is long out of print and difficult to obtain."
 
Uploader's comment: sadly overlooked and much underrated album that deserves to be heard and enjoyed by everybody - not just by those who can fork out $150-300 on that OOP Japanese CD. Shame on you EMI for not re-releasing this album in either the US or Europe. Shame on you for not re-releasing  _any_  of Kim Carnes' studio albums full stop.
