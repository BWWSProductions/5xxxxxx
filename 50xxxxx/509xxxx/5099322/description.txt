Paul Giamatti, Brian Posehn, Rosario Dawson, Danny Trejo, Daniel Roebuck, Tom Kenny, Tom Papa, and, of course, Sheri Moon Zombie all lend their voices to director Rob Zombieâ€™s animated tale of a washed-up luchador who makes it his mission to battle the forces of the supernatural. As the heroic El Superbeasto (voice of Papa) advances ever closer to his ultimate confrontation with the diabolical Dr. Satan (Giamatti), each adventure becomes more surreal and terrifying than the last.
