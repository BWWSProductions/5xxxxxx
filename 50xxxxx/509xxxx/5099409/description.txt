This release is album of the Argentine-Uruguayan tango fusion band Bajofondo.
Disk will be interesting for all, who likes Narcotango, Gotan Project and same groups.
Some tango, some electronic, some trip-hop, house and chill out - Mar Dulce is the impressive mix of so many styles. Many people says that it's a dance-oriented music, but it's not exactly. It's just great instrumental/electronic music for rest.
I think it's one of the best disks in my collection.
