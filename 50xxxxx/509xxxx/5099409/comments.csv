,mava96,2010-03-13T23:23Z,"dont worry about the english, just worry about the ""flac"" format...... would have been desirable to have the files in MP3..."
,grippm,2011-04-13T10:10Z,"thank you.
to those who want MP3 get foobar (free) and convert to MP3 - it is pretty easy.  FLAC rules !"
,Willy_B,2011-04-23T22:45Z,Think it is. Don't understand crying about flac format. Every good players can play in today. And many of them can convert...
,expi4321,2011-10-02T01:32Z,Much appreciated!
