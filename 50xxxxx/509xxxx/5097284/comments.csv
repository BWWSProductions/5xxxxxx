,Emmortel,2009-09-25T21:44Z,"According to the TV Guide website, the episodes are supposed to look like this:

0101 - Pilot, Warehouse 13 [1]
0102 - Pilot, Warehouse 13 [2]
0103 - Resonance
0104 - Magnetism
0105 - Claudia
0106 - Elements
0107 - Burnout
0108 - Implosion
0109 - Duped
0110 - Regrets
0111 - Breakdown
0112 - Nevermore
0113 - MacPherson

So, technically this one is 0113. Just thought I'd set the record straight."
,Emmortel,2009-09-25T21:45Z,"Forgot to also post: that's also how it's set up on the official website, which I don't remember at the moment."
,Online.Pirate,2012-05-04T10:05Z,"I know this is 2 and a half years old but I have just started watching this series...

It is correct that this is S01E12.. not 13

@Emmortel
In regards to the Warehouse 13 official website (which I have open infront of me right now), this is E12, they don't have it listed as 13.

In some series when an episode is twice the length as a standard episode of the series it is two episodes back to back, but that was not the case with Warehouse 13's pilot.. it was one long episode"
