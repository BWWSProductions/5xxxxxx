Thanks and please seed.

,Xsniper,2009-09-21T21:23Z,How about using mp3 format?
,ToplessGranny,2009-09-24T00:52Z,"Whenever there's a torrent using MP3 people cry about it being in bad quality and stuff. I just ripped the CD and uploaded the torrent, no more. if you don't like it, there's plenty of other torrents."
