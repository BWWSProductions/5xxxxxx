 I downloaded this and the rar version- both are identical and both came down with poor sound however after converting to DVD (I use Win AVI) the sound was fine 
on a 42 inch flat screen A=9 and V=9 excellent coppy many thanks to uploader
PS comments on the rar coppy claim there is a virus--- (horseshit) avast found nothing nor did spybot both copies seem to be from the same master"
