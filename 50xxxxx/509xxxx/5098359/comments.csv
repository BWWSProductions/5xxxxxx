,paladin181,2009-09-25T01:44Z,"Used crack following the instructions, (Had to disable AV) and still no dice. Get the register window, and the ""There is no trial version"" message. Any points? Using Windows 7. Crack does nothing. It appears in my task manager for the briefest of seconds then vanishes, and nothing has happened to the Alcohol.exe. And yes, I used ""run as Admin"""
[V],BLACKTROY,2009-09-25T13:05Z,what do you expect from Alcohol software developers. they ve tighten their belt regarding cracking the latest version. they themself are rouge. creating a loophole on how to circumvent  fellow software developer.

It looks like a False Positive to me."
,Talking_Evil,2009-12-16T18:47Z,"Yeah I always get False/Positives from AVG, and it's getting on my Fuckin nerves. Time to get another virus program!!!! any suggustions ???? on a good one, I tried lots of them but haven't found one I can Trust to my liking.  Thanks for the UP, keep up the good work Dude.
{Peace}  "
,SpiritWolfe,2009-12-18T04:08Z,"@ The guys and gals with the false positives...

AVG (among others) WILL allow you an ""out"" by making an EXCEPTION for that keygen within,for example,AVG. I am running AVG 9.0.x with the key I got from this site and I have had to make a folder that it will SKIP the scanning the folders that contain the keygens.

NOTE: BY DOING THIS EXTRA STEP YOU WILL SAVE YOURSELF A TON OF HEADACHES ... H.O.N.E.S.T.L.Y!!!  >:)

Happy Holidays, Cheers!

,SpiritWolfe,2009-12-18T04:44Z,"PS ...  :)

At least this is how it works for me. Since McAfee has become more ""bloated"" I got rid of it.

I have a couple of older computers that once I installed AVG, it gave the speed back to my computers...


But I agree with Talking_Evil. I STILL do not know of a decent virus program that I would invest my resources or 100% trust in!

Later!"

,BipolarMonkey,2009-12-22T21:26Z,To people who can't use crack file: I have found with my antivirus that if I leave it on while downloading it will automatically pull out the cracker/keygen and then it won't work. I turn my anti-virus off during download & install and it almost always fixed the problem.
,spotter12,2010-01-04T17:12Z,"Hello, crack tainted do not use
It seems that crack works, but truth is that along with crack there is at least 3 virus embedded in it in encrypted form or something, after you install the crack my antivirus(Avast! 4.8 with current update) detected three viruses(WIN32:ZBIT-MML [Trjn], Delf-NCC [drp] viruses with random name on the C: drive.
After that Avast! is detecting a virus( Malware-Gen) in C:\Windows\Temporary\****.TMP\svchost.exe
here ""****"" stands for any four letter randome string
I get this warning every three minutes
I think my computer is infected with some sort of new virus and it is still running
But still there isn't any symptoms  except once my E-mail scanner notified me about sending of SMTP E-mails to more than 125 persons within seconds, and i haven't yet noted this again
I have send suspicious crack file to avast and hope a fix soon(the torrent appears to be new So the virus may be new) 


I warn you again, Use Extreme Caution while using the given loader crack, It may be a virus"
,spotter12,2010-01-04T17:17Z,I promise i will keep above info updated
,jammitin,2010-01-12T04:59Z,"Kaspersky updated as of Jan 11th, 9:45pm said the crack had a virus. 

the link that User8z posted was a version that came out clean according to Kaspersky, which has the least amount of false positives in my experience.

i'll post the link again to the virus free version
