It looks like the only solution manual is for Mechanics of Materials.

Thanks."

solutionmanual for statics, mechanics and dynamics.

mechanics and dynamics where only one book see the chapters.
newadays they split it in 2 books
regarding chapter 12 of the solution manual to chapter 1 of the book.

good luck!"
