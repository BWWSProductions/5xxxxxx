,kimahri---1980,2009-09-22T20:09Z,"Your Rip's are the best Major, Secret Myth and of course Lifechanger. No more aXXo or FXG for me.
Anyway one request and one question.
Can any of you 3 good guys please rip: Defiance (2008) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034303/
It would be greatly appreciated and well seeded of course by yours truly.
My question was what is the exact difference between a 480p and a 720p BrRip?
Anyway thx in advance and thx for all the great work you guys have done so far!
:D "
,Otaku1,2009-09-24T04:52Z,Thank you. Quality +1.
,kimahri---1980,2009-09-24T23:06Z,"Thx for replying and for backing my request zax808. Anyway how is the video bitrate envolved in this? I'm  guessing that a 720p Rip requires a higher bitrate then a 420p Rip? And that this would problaby change the filesize. A 720p Rip would be bigger in size then a 420p Rip.
I'm just interested in how these (new to me) H264 BRRips work and why they usualy come in MP4 format, I'v also seen 'em in MKV format.

I'm now a big fan of SecretMyth, MajorTJKong and Lifechanger torrents. (also NewArtRiot, his uploads made me interested in other H264 Rippers)

To the uploaders thx for all your effort and I realy hope you guys wil rip ""Defiance"" but I will understand that you guys may have other priorities at the moment... StarTrek 2009 for example...
Anyway keep up the good work!!!

:D"
,Jack_Raiden,2009-09-28T16:24Z,"Excellent release. Thanks SecretMyth and seeders.

@zax: ""kimahri 480p means there are 480 progressive lines.""

Very basically, 480p refers to ""DVD"" resolution, 720p to ""HD"" resolution, and 1080p to ""full HD"" or ""Blu-ray"" resolution. Each has about twice as many pixels as the previous. More pixels means higher definition (duh!), clarity and detail. "
,kimahri---1980,2009-10-02T21:35Z,"Thx Jack_Raiden for the info.

To Secret_myth, MajoTJKong and Lifechanger sorry about the defiance request since you've already ripped it thank you for that. (oops by me)

Anyway @ zax808 they already did it their original source was: Defiance.720p.BluRay.x264-iNFAMOUS
