Wow thanx for all the comments guyz."
,Revilor008,2010-01-08T19:29Z,"Thanks TheDrizzle, I actually bought this album but I left it at my other house."
,Revilor008,2010-01-08T19:31Z,Next time I would change the song format to .mp3 cuz not everyone likes or uses wmp.
,Tomato9876,2010-01-28T20:35Z,"This is WMA lossless, so just convert it to whatever you want. It's better than mp3 because if you want an AAC file for your iPod or Zune, or mp3 for any other player, you can encode and get excellent quality."
,ThaDrizzle,2010-03-12T03:55Z,"Thanks for the input ""Rev"" and ""Tom"".  I agree with Tomato about the file type.  I used to have an Ipod and a Mp3 player so this is how I preferred it.  Once again however, thanks for the input."
