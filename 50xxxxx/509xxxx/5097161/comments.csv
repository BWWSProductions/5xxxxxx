It's because some else released the exact same torrent last week, and that someone else put in the work and dedicated their bandwidth to seeding it.

,rippervanwinkle,2009-09-25T13:57Z,"Here's the difference between the original release and spotted_jackal's:

He's added some low-res cover art to each album, a small file 'Folder.jpg'.  He has removed the log files.  He has changed the album names, removing the text '(2009 Stereo Remaster)' and replacing that with the year of the album.  He has used a slightly different name+tag syntax.

Here's the metadata (shows the content, creation date, trackers etc) from the original release:

http://pastebay.com/57089

Now here's the metadata from spotted_jackal's 'release'

http://pastebay.com/57091

Anyone can check it out and decide for themselves if spotted_jackal made a new release or if he bastardised someone else's and then pretends it is his own.  You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to work this one out. If you prefer to examine the metadata yourself instead of trusting my upload to pastebay you can download the torrent files and use your bittorrent client to examine the content without downloading anything.  I use ctorrent to do this because it's very simple in a terminal to examine the data and save the output to a text file.

Just one question. What's the quality like? Is it REAL Flac audio files ( that is compressed without any LOSS) or what's the deal? By experience I know that a lot of twanks upload music converted into FLAC with a quality similar to Mp3 (Bitrate of between 128-320 kbit/s). IT should be 1024kbit/s to keep the quality stable! 
"
,thkspr,2009-11-10T05:17Z,"FLAC files are compressed but without losing quality, that is why the bitrate is less than a WAV file but higher than a MP3 file. It is also variable, not fixed.
Unless it is for portability or taking less space, those who prefer MP3 over FLAC do not have idea of what are they talking about. FLAC files, when ripped directly from CD retain CD audio quality. Choosing a MP3 file over a FLAC file is retarded unless it is for the reasons previously stated.
You can always convert a FLAC file to a MP3 file at the bitrate you prefer, but you will lose some information. If you convert a MP3 file to a FLAC file you will not recover the information lost while converting to MP3, while if you convert a FLAC file to a WAV file the converted file will be the same as the original.
If you want to know if these files are ripped from CD you can use Audiochecker to verify them."

mp3 max bitrate is 320 kbps. However, you can have a vbr mp3 file. this would yield a very high bitrate as well. I never noticed a prblem with 320 kbps mp3, the only thing i find superiour is ogg files
(500 kbps max) which at equivalent bitrates is better than mp3. just because it says its a lossles file doesnt mean its lossles. WAV is a CBR (1411.2 kbps) but WMA lossles is a VBR (470-960 kbps) and is widely acknowledged to be equal to WAV. So bitrate doesnt mean shit, its the encoding that matters, and lets face it mp3 sucks."

Copy-Cat torrents do help us keep the material from disappearing though, and that's a good thing.

2) A GREAT FREE FLAC TO WAVE/MP3 (and others is: Free mp3 Wma Converter - http://www.koyotesoft.com/en/products.html - One can make another directory for CD wave files and easily convert the flac to the 16-bit audio cd wave files into a single directory (for each cd).

Set WMP to auto rip when a cd is inserted, pop it in, wait for it to finish, pop another one in etc. It will automatically go out and look for the info for the cd you put in too so theres no searching for anything, which most media programs have now anyway.

Some people prefer to preserve the quality of a recording. With a FLAC file, you can recreate a CD in it's original quality, play the files ""as-is"" from you computer or many hardware devices (like WDTV, etc), or produce lower quality mp3s for your portable players.

Get it? Complete flexibility with no loss of quality. Yes, CDs can be created from mp3s, but there will always be losses.

,samuel123321,2010-07-06T17:08Z,"Hey, I'm having problem with adding the songs to iTunes, when I copy them, and try to paste into iTunes, nothing happends?

HELP!"
,MJKW2Ab,2010-07-28T02:31Z,"samuel123321: For quality recordings like this I prefer to make a CD THEN have Itunes rip the CD to whatever compression you use for your Ipod. It's simple to do.

Place all the Flac songs to each record in separate folders- one folder for each album, actually most likely this will already be the case. Download and run this free Flac/Wave/Mp3 Converter found on this page: http://www.koyotesoft.com/en/products.html - Next create a folder inside your Flac songs folder named WAVE (or whatever). Set the settings on free converter to read the Flac files from the correct folder containing the flac songs to write to the wave folder. Make sure the program is set to write to the correct wave folder in 16-bit wave format (default setting, and CD standard) Next click the convert icon. The resulting Wave folder will contain the exact data needed to convert them to Standard CDs. Be careful to change read and write folders each time you move on to the next album.

Once you have these flac songs converted and inside a separate folder in 16 bit Wave format you can use most quality CD writing programs, such as NERO, to write a CD from the WAVE Folder's tracks. (I use NERO) Now you should have a lossless perfect clones of the actual CDs, unlike MP3 rips. The resulting CD should sound exactly like the store bought cd it was ripped from.

The last step, of course, is to insert the cd you created and use Itunes to rip it in any format you wish. Personally I prefer using AAC @224kbps for very high quality audio yet still in a modest-small file-size which sounds much better than a 320kbps MP3 once synced and converted to an Ipod. However many prefer using Flac genrated cds for a source for Itunes to rip to Apple Lossless (converting to wave is possible on Itunes but will not result in higher quality in this case) for the highest quality Itune rip.

Also, for the really serious fans, one can order Blank GOLD CDs which are made from real gold that are supposed to last longer than most of us will live. Just a suggestion for people that can afford these blank Gold CDs (less than $2.00 per blank gold CD I believe)

Whats cool about this method is you will always have a perfect clone of the CD (with Flac downloads) you can store for backup purposes, yet use your Ipod to play back the songs in any file compression you desire. (as said, I greatly prefer AAC@224kbps over any MP3 rip or even Apple Lossless for the most perfect rip of cds produced from flac downloads, but those will be larger files)

I hope that helps somebody as it is nice to have this collection on CD as well as being able to play it all on an Ipod. For the very best quality rip on Itunes, rip to Apple Lossless, which is their version of Flac. No matter what file compression you prefer for Itunes this is a music collection I feel is nice to have on Cd first, then have Itunes rip the Cds (Itunes can also fetch all song titles online (PeerBlock- Http must be OFF) during such CD rips.

Jewel case images for all of these cds can be found easily on Google-Images."
,MJKW2Ab,2010-07-31T02:16Z,"samuel123321: I forgot this- The reason why Itunes would not play your files, is that, based on what you posted, you attempted to have Itunes play Flac format songs, which most newer media players can do (Winamp etc) but Itunes will not read/write the FLAC format. Apple invented their own version of Flac which they call Apple Lossless. One MUST convert these flac files into a format that Itunes recognizes, such as mp3,aac,wave,apple lossless etc BEFORE Itunes can play them. If you convert to wav you can rip from your wave folder (Add folder to library) directly to Itunes if you do not wish to make a cd first (this preserves the best quality for the final Itunes rip). However your song titles may need manual updating, where as if you rip from a CD all song titles should be fetched online and saved in Itunes (PeerBlock Http must be OFF)."
,MJKW2Ab,2010-10-31T02:26Z,"EliteM: 

Wow, I'm lucky I saw your reply after all of this time. YES ALL off The Beatles songs were remastered in this collection, but some songs are much more obvious than others. The hard panning of the stereo mix seems to be the same (ex: vocals in left, music in right) but these remixes sound MUCH more clear- One might even say their is less over-all distortion & noise and many songs are mixed louder which puts these recordings  pretty close to the mixing standards used in modern music mixing.

Unlike the store purchased box set, there are no computer  graphics here,  just music with this collection. However the story/interview that was interwoven with the computer played discs is a popular download elsewhere (story told by producer Billy Martin). I found a DVD torrent of the same story/interview by producer Billy Martin and simply made it into a DVD and added it and some  rare Beatles cartoons to make what feel is a better collection than the store bought version with CDs in paper inserts (paper is bad to store discs in, as it can damage them over time, no jewel cases were provided)."

Awesome, we are now staring right at 2011 and these 2009 Beatles remixes still remain the #1 download here, and the also sold out of production as I recall.

But am I the only one that feels recent music has suffered? -- CONT--"

We TRIED selling MP3s,AAC/ Flacs etc... For most of us that did not work. I have no idea how Itunes is holding up from a music sales side of their market. CONT----"

Looking back at the so called music of the early first decade of 2010 I must admit the music sucks. Yeah we got EminEm, Kid-Rock, Lady Ga Ga, even Johny Cash was kicking them out before he died, but on a whole creativity in music is as dead as ever before in my life."

But the Beatles is the last best example I know of, I mean they just one day decided they no longer liked touring and would a studio band!! No artists truly has such an option today, they all are expected to go on tour to make the big bucks. ---CONT---"

We can not stop technology, but I do wish we had more artists like the ones I named that go ahead and write record and produce good music, no matter if it sales good, or is the #2 flac download for a year.

Will this be the Generation of 50 year old music lovers? It is quickly becoming that way even for the youngest music lovers.

This Beatles Collection is awesome and worth the download. But it made me think about how things have changed so drastically and so fast. I thank the ones that made these files possible to download, even if we have a mix bag of ones that ripped the files and others that re-posted the same material. At least it is posted for download, and in the end I feel that is an important thing.

Also MTV playing reality shows 24/7 does little to promote record sells too, as it was a driving force decades ago. -- IMHO

No offense, just one dude's 2 cents."
,zackisawsum123,2010-12-10T00:13Z,does it have original album covers and images?

,Zarkow,2011-01-03T17:42Z,"Most people might play this great FLAC release on the computer, but if you want to put it on your cell phone etc you might have to convert it to a MP3.

If you wanna try a Beta of a free tool called zAudioConverter, that does this. I cannot post links here but info can be found on our Digital Software forum."

Hearing the difference now isnâ€™t the reason to encode to FLAC. FLAC uses lossless compression, while MP3 is â€˜lossyâ€™. What this means is that for each year the MP3 sits on your hard drive, it will lose roughly 12kbps, assuming you have SATA â€“ itâ€™s about 15kbps on IDE, but only 7kbps on SCSI, due to rotational velocidensity. You donâ€™t want to know how much worse it is on CD-ROM or other optical media.

I started collecting MP3s in about 2001, and if I try to play any of the tracks I downloaded back then, even the stuff I grabbed at 320kbps, they just sound like crap. The bass is terrible, the midrangeâ€¦well donâ€™t get me started. Some of those albums have degraded down to 32 or even 16kbps. FLAC rips from the same period still sound great, even if they werenâ€™t stored correctly, in a cool, dry place. Seriously, stick to FLAC, you may not be able to hear the difference now, but in a year or two, youâ€™ll be glad you did."
,southak,2011-12-19T06:06Z,"@ Randy - you are totally wrong man. The difference between lossless (flac) and lossy formats (mp3) is the amount of data lost in the compression. Lossy formats compress the file size so much (about 10% of original size) that some of the original ""fidelity"" is lost. With loseless formats much less (if any) is lost - that's why they are much bigger files (about half original size). Loseless formats sound better but are bigger files."
,waccu,2012-03-28T11:35Z,"Many things has been said here and there are mant oppinions about whats right and whats wrong.

no matter what. If the person uploading, isnt the copyright holder, then it`s the same as breaking the law end of story.

To all mp3 lovers go and find out what FLAC really."
