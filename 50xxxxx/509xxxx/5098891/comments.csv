,teikyo30,2009-11-02T11:00Z,"jbrickbm: there is a program called YAMBA that does it. Basically you drag and drop the video file to the program folder and uncheck the 6 channel box for the audio, then you drag the 2 channel audio to the program box, click next next next to start it making sure you have a new destination folder like desktop and voila, you have your Xbox 360 file in 2 channel audio. Hope that helped!"
