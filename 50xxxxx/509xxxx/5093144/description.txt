Red Zone are a little known American New Wave/Futurist four piece band, some members of which went on to form 'Animotion', who enjoyed modest success during the 80s, most notably with the single "Obsession" which featured in the trailer for the movie 9 1/2 Weeks (but was not used in the movie itself).

The LP is pretty hard to come by these days so I've tried to make the best vinyl rip possible. Its pretty lightweight stuff but good fun at the same time. Hope you enjoy.
