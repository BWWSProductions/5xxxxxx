,deverry,2009-09-30T00:08Z,"People try because they are curious and want to know what it is, its hard to resist clicking a link called ""nothing is here"" :P

Anyway, stop using TPB for this, how hard is it to set up an ftp instead? And if you insist on doing it this way at least delete the torrent when you are done."
