Pathfinder is a 2007 action film directed by Marcus Nispel, starring Karl Urban and Moon Bloodgood. It was released on April 13, 2007 with the DVD released on July 31, 2007. It has been rated R by the MPAA for strong and brutal violence throughout.

The story involves a fictional conflict between Vikings and Native Americans around 800, two centuries before Leif Ericson actually set foot to the New World. Dark Horse has produced a graphic novel adaptation.

The movie is based on a Norwegian film from 1987, with the same English title.
