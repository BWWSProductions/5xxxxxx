WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY ABOUT COPILOT:

â—†â—†â—†â—†â—† Stuff Magazine, April 2009 â€œSTUFF HOT BUY: The menu system is intuitive and the map is clearly readable at the wheel. We canâ€™t fault its on-road performance either. But itâ€™s the live functionality thatâ€™s the clincher. Still the most comprehensive and user-friendly mobile solution on the road.â€
