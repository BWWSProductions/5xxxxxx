-Don't know what you're smoking on, but I've downloaded all of oteps' Blues Clues and they are perfect. I watch them with my daughter almost everyday, alongside The Wiggles, Barney and Elmo.

To: oteps
-Please upload the other seasons even though they are missing episodes. We know you're a perfectionist but sometimes it's better to have some than none at all. PLEASE WE'RE ALL BEGGING YOU to UPLOAD THE REST OF THE SEASONS!!!"
,tmsboys,2010-02-11T21:34Z,"To oteps,

Where are my manners??

I forgot to thank you for such a wonderful torrent. All the episodes were wonderful, so glad to have this in my collection. Thank you very much for spending the time to do this for us. Seasons 1, 2, 3, 5a, & 6, they are all great quality. CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK, you deserve a skull next to your user ID. I'll also continue my work with uploading The Wiggles collection as well. Check for that soon."
