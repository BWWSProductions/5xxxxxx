Blue's Clues is one of the best English language children's TV programs for ages 2-10.  It challenges it's viewers with puzzles and clues, teaching letters, problem solving, numbers, sequences and many other useful skills in a very entertaining fashion.

These episodes are taken from many various digital sources.
