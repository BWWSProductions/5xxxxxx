Thanks."
,Navirio,2009-09-23T19:11Z,its a great version if your watching on the comp i used convert x to DVD and for some reason the sound went to just buzzing. Ive made plenty of DVD's just this fatal release did it. otherwise a nearly perfect copy

A:  3
V:  5  (CAM)


The Audio is tinny and brittle/ lo-fi sounding, and seems almost completely balanced to the left channel, also appears to be out of sync.

Video is grainy & fuzzy and noisy.  It's CAM, no mistake.  If you can't wait to see it go ahead, if you can, wait for the dvd.  You'll probably be missing a lot of visual detail however as this is a fully 3D animated and is overall a very dark film."

All ""TS"" releases are cams. And they did provide a sample. "

Has anyone had trouble with the links on here lately? I click on download and it just times out... I could only get this by going through the url for the sample"
