Any way thanks for cartoon..........now lets take look for a movie"
,lucidpaul,2010-07-06T18:32Z,"Just watched it and it's great !!! Having in mind I dl'ed it by fluke.
Batman is portrayed just  the way I like it. Not like some fucking ""social worker"" (..if U know what I mean) like we used to see but more like a real man."

,50l0,2011-01-02T06:00Z,"Great movie, but I still think that they dont make superman look as strong as he truly is, i meen he could punch batman and make him fly 3 miles before he stopped flying"
,kbowk2,2011-04-02T05:59Z,"Lucidpaul I reckon it is a movie.  Considering it sez Animated Original Movie on the cover (see pic).  What is it with everytime I download an animated adventure there are always comments from ppl who didn't know it was a cartoon.  There's nothing wrong with the DC anime, it's always a good watch.  Especially Superman/Batman Apoc. Yeah Kick-ass!  I guess I used to watch a lot of Jap. Anime when I was younger so don't mind a good action cartoon.  

What do ppl expect thou?  Are we that out of the loop that in 2009 Christian Bale dressed up again as batman and Chis Nolan wrote up the first superhero crossover script with not only superman, but a range of other heros and villans (all A+ actors if the movie was going to be high budget & any good) called public enemies.  However, they didn't really think it was a big deal so forgot to advertise the movie and didnt even bother with a trailer so no one knew about it, not even speculation on the internet was heard.  

When it was released it went straight to DVD because Hollywood didn't feel like making any money, rather they lost millions paying for CG, sets, actors, staff, etc, etc.  However, the media didn't know about the movie and it's huge loses, so nothing was reported on it.  

Finally someone saw it in the video store and was like holy shit, Christian Bale + Superman in like Batman 3.  How come I didn't here about this?  So they get it out, love it, put it onto the net for everyone else to see.  However, nobody notices for some unknown reason.  Instead only a few thousand bother to download and watch it.  And in 2011 LUCIDPAUL finds it on PirateBay and thinks Batman 3, hmmm that would be nice to watch.

If you think about it people who keep downloading these animation movies then come back to comment and complain that it was an animation, not live feature are fucking idiots.   "
