Description

A desperate solution for a troubled country: Lex Luthor for 
President with the Justice League in the service of the  
government. Only Batman and Superman stand against the new  
regime - and their disloyalty proves to be exactly what Luthor 
intended. Using their outcast status to instigate a scandal 
against Superman, Luthor finally tastes a victory in his 
vendetta against The Man of Steel. From Executive Producer  
Bruce Timm and voiced by the cast from both hit Batman and  
Superman animated TV series including Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly
and Clancy Brown, this DC Universe Original Animated Movie of  
Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness's popular graphic novel seethes 
with political intrigue and action-packed battles between
heroes all believing they're on the right side of the law.
