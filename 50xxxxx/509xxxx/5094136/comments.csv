As many of you probably know already, but some may not, in the summer of 2008, a partial draft of Stephenie Meyer's ""Midnight Sun"" was released on the internet.  As it was unfinished and unedited, it was very upsetting for the author to have her work shown in a light she wasn't prepared to present it in.  Because of this, the work was discontinued by the author and rather than have fans try to hunt down illegal copies, she published it free on her website.

So, I encourage you to visit her site and download it after completing this series.  ""Midnight Sun"" started for Meyer as a character study of Edward Cullen and quickly developed into a burgeoning prospective novel.  It is the story of the first novel, ""Twilight"", but unlike ""Twilight"" which is from Bella's perspective ... ""Midnight Sun"" is from Edward's prospective.

You can download and read this still awesome story here -- http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsun.html"
