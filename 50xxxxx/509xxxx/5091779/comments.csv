,wurstfinger,2009-10-13T12:24Z,"Correction: Appears that the files are not damaged - only if you, like me, download this and the other at the same time, and unpack this .rar file, it will partially overwrite the other download (which is not a rar but a folder which has the same name as this rar's extracted folder), leading to the damages. So, no worries, as long as you do not try to unpack this rar into the same place where you also download the other one :)"
