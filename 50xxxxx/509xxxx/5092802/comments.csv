,pegasp,2010-01-16T04:58Z,I installed Acronis to 3 winXPpro pc connected each other in network. After that I can not have access in the share drives from one pc to another pc. Does Acronis activate a firewall? If yes who I could restore the communication of share disks from one pc to another pc?

,rocketero,2010-01-28T07:21Z,"@pegasp
that's a bad thing that you lost the shares between pc's.  Have you tried to ping by IP address instead of sharename like in Windows Explorer type: ""\\192.168.100.2"" or whatever Ip address you have in your shares?

Also I would like t ask anyone reading this thread:  What is this Acronis True Image different from Windows 7 Backup&Restore and from R-Drive_Image Software ??? I need to know so I decide witch software to use.

thanks."

,tripplesix,2010-03-21T14:31Z,"Wow!! This thing went smoothly and great!! I am so amazed, especially because of what I went through yesterday with this OTHER program (which is supposed to do the same thing).  This donwloaded, installed, backed up (image) and cloned perfectly... without a single problem!!! (way easier than that OTHER program).
I did all this from a 750 GB HD with Windows 7 64-bit to a 1 TB HD! It works!!!
Thanks so much, Murlok!!"
