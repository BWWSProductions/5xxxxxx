Have you ever asked your teenager to do something, or tried to tell them something important and been answered with that standard teen answer "Whatever"? 


Generations of parents have wondered why their children turn into obnoxious, argumentative, angst- ridden, reckless, lazy and rebellious monsters in their teenage years. 

Whatever! has the answers. Using a series of ground-breaking on-screen scientific tests, we will tread where adults fear to go. This series will combine observational documentary of family life and teens behaving badly, with carefully designed scientific challenges that put our teenagers to the test. 

Experts will be on hand to give physical, physiological and psychological analysis of the way teenagers behave while we talk to teenagers and parents to give us a 360 degree view of the experiments and what they could mean in everyday life.

(my upload bandwidth is narrow, so upload initially will be slow, but I will leave it seeding for some time to ensure it gets completed several times to other seeders, so hang in there - it will complete after a while. Dont be in too much of a hurry!)
