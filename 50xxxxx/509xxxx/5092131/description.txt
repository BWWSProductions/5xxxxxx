Point Club is the second game in the point-and-click adventure series following the Italian Emilio Carboni through his exchange student program in Sweden. The story picks up right away where the previous game ended, and an optional short introduction is shown to get up to speed with the events of the previous episode. Emilio has met the Spanish students Pedro and Miguel who tell him about the point game. Together with Mathias, they have to earn points by kissing as many girls as possible. 

Before Emilio can become part of the game, he needs to show the Spanish students he can pull off a decent prank. Once the point game starts, Emilio will need to find a way to get into the club and get a bike to ride to his fadder meeting.
