,neosudhan,2009-12-06T20:24Z,"Hey guys,
Just downloaded this and it is awesome!
for those who think this to be suspicious,I assure you that this is the real deal!Excellent upload!!
Quality is awesome and so is this anime
The only negative point is that the episode 19 is missing. and otherwise this is as good as those 7g or 15 g torrents for this anime
Thanks a lot youssef0eddoumali!!(I registered jus to post this comment)"

It says Dual Audio in the title and in the info it says Spoken language(s): English, Japanese.
