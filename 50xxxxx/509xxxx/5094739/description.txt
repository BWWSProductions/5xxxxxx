This is Michael D. O'Neal's amazing booklet How Rome Will Recapture the Protestants (1998) which exposes various methods that Vatican is using to subvert Protestants in America to join the Roman catholic church. This booklet is an edited transcription of a message preached by the author originally to the congregation of Gospel light baptist church, Albany, Georgia, where he has ministered since founding the church in 1986. If you are pro-catholic and are offended easily, you are probably not going to enjoy this book. Find out how Rome will use a corrupted message to recapture the protestants, produce counterfeit bibles to create dissension, distrust and construct a desire for unity through other means. As immorality is a basic characteristic of "the great whore" it will use compromised morals to recapture the gullible Protestants. Also she will will use carnal music and the charismatic movement to recapture the hearts of the masses so that all will cheer the pope again. 30 pages. A must read for everyone.
