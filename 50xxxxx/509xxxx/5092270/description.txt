"All for You" is a song by American R&B-pop singer Janet Jackson from her seventh studio album, All for You (2001). Released as the album's lead single in March 2001, the song went on to top the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks, and also reached the top five and the top ten of the majority of the charts. "All for You" remains Jackson's last Hot 100 number-one single so far.

The video, directed by Dave Meyers, takes place in a colorful two-dimensional world. Released in July 2001, it revolves around Jackson flirting with a man whom she first meets on the subway. Jackson and her dancers perform high-octane choreography throughout the video which also features a dance break which contains samples a few different songs. They are sister Rebbie Jackson's 1984 song "Centipede", Jackson's own 1986 hit song "The Pleasure Principle", her 1998 single "Go Deep", and Shannon's 1983 song "Let the Music Play". The video ends with Jackson spotting the same man near a nightclub, who smiles at her; she waves at him before turning to leave.

The video was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Female Video, Best Dance Video, and Best Choreography at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards. It appears on the DVD edition of All for Youâ€”which also contains an exclusive live performance of the song from mtvICONâ€”as well as the 2004 DVD From janet. to Damita Jo: The Videos.

The song is based upon a sample from Change's 1980 song "The Glow of Love", which featured lead vocals by Luther Vandross. It made history by being the first single ever to be added to every major format of radio on the day of its release. The song became Jackson's tenth number one on the Billboard Hot 100, staying there for seven weeks, in addition of topping the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club Play charts. To date it is the final song by Jackson to top the charts. The song was also an international success, reaching number one in Canada and charting inside the top ten of almost all European countries and the top five in Australia and New Zealand. The song won several music awards, including a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.
