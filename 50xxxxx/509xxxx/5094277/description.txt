Introducing James Bond... charming, sophisticated, handsome, chillingly ruthless and very deadly. From the first of Fleming's tales of secret agent 007 which finds Bond on a mission to neutralise a lethal operative by ruining him at the baccarat table to the last, which finds Bond ruthlessly gunning down an unlikely assassin in snipers' alley between East and West Berlin, this collector's set features all 14 Bond novels, beautifully repackaged in a fabulously retro look. A superb box set for the legions of 007 fans, as well as fans of contemporary thrillers, this will keep readers happily occupied for the winter months ahead. Set titles and authors : Casino Royale Live and Let Die Doctor No From Russia with Love Diamonds are Forever Moonraker You Only Live Twice The Spy Who Loved Me For Your Eyes Only Goldfinger Octopussy On Her Majesty's Secret Service Thunderball The Man with the Golden Gun
