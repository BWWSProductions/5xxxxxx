to save some download time i havent included all the different versions of singels and albums. labels ect.."
,Torqued713,2009-10-07T13:56Z,"Nice collection, but shitty tagging. Would it be so hard to at least auto-tag the albums?"
,bunzl72,2009-10-24T03:52Z,@torqued713 tag em yerself u lazy twat!! have some respect for the uploader!!!....next tim go out n find a collection like this yourself!!! fuckin hate ungrateful fookers!!! thanks for the time 2 do the upload zeiten!!! 
,NuRome,2010-01-07T20:02Z,i'll rep for now but if it turns out that the ones that would have been east to tag properly are not then I'll come back and -1 you all day. I don't expect odd stuff to be tagged properly but studio albums and mixes should take only a few seconds to tag properly. nice collection though regardless.
,r3tr0,2010-03-02T20:38Z,"I love Paul and Out There And Back is still one of the greatest albums of all time IMO.  I don't give a shit about tagging if you have all this greatness in one pretty package.  Brother, you are saving me money and an ass load of time this way.  I think my wife owes you something..."
,DCPTKON,2010-04-22T23:15Z,"Superb collection, and it's not just a bunch of one track streamrips [like the Oakenfold torrent I got a while back], it's actual individual tracks! AWESOME Thank You."
