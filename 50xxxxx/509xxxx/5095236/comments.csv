,iwilleatu,2009-09-24T07:43Z,"sorry to hear that you have xp, i run vista ultimate x86 with no probs whatsoever, i used to hate vista too, but its pretty nice"
[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2009-09-26T18:57Z,maybe i use vista in future when its more stable sorry you have to put up with such a shite os yerself
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2009-10-10T12:25Z,"yeah vistas trash. with vista you need 2 times the amount of ram then you'd need to run the same game in xp. also need a faster processor too. so if anyone can explain to me how this somehow makes vista better than xp...id love to argue with ya!!!!

,linkinpark187,2009-10-15T19:59Z,"Is there someone here who could possibly seed this at more than 10kb/s?  I've been downloading this off and on for a few days now, and the sooner it's downloaded, the better, because that means I'll be able to seed it to everyone else.  Thanks!"

,GgioVega,2010-03-05T10:54Z,"Works fine on Vista and Windows 7 alike, just use Compatibility mode and run as Administrator. Thanks for the upload.

Also, for those who say ""Vista sucks"", why was Vista the required operating system for 50% of the games released after 2007, and why does XP not support DirectX10? Oh, right, because Vista is a better operating system. XP requires more resources than ME, which required more resources than 98, and etc. It's called an ""upgraded OS"", it requires more to run, but supports more. Grow up, stop being stubborn, upgrade your computer, and get with the times. :]"

,Toshido,2010-07-07T06:24Z,"I get an error when I try to install the game.

Feature:Do not install Movies.(You need 600MB of free space on your hard disk.)

Component: comic
File : G:\data2.cab
Error: Incorrect function.

I have 10+ GBs of free storage on my hard drive so I don't know what's the problem.
P.S. I know I could just not install the movies but I really wanna keep'em.
So if someone could send me a preinstalled game or tell me how to fix this error comment back. Thank you."
,pira7e,2010-08-27T05:54Z,"If you have more than 2gb of RAM, this game will crash on start up, and I have found no software solution online. The only way is to physically remove sticks of RAM."
,daveo76,2010-09-12T05:14Z,What a waste of time and bandwidth downloading this crap. I get the same error message as Toshido does. I'm running Windows 7 Ulitmate 64-Bit with 3GB RAM
