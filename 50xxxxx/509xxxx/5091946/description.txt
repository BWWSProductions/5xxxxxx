Product Description
Officially a part of the Luftwaffe, Germany's parachute units were organized into the 7th Flieger Division in July 1938 under General Kurt Student. In the German invasion of France and the Low Countries in 1940 the parachute units stunned the world and laid the basis for an airborne mystique that has endured to the present day. The division also fought in Norway, Greece and Crete before surrendering in Italy in 1945. Each Spearhead title includes an evaluation of the units combat effectiveness as seen by the unit, its opponents and subsequent researchers, and a research section including a bibliography and a listing of museums, websites, re-enactment groups and memorials.
