,romeox145,2009-09-17T04:52Z,Thanks so much man. I wish i could do this for myself but i dont have a comp that is capable of such a task.  Its hard watch movies on my computer so i just download movies for my Ipod to watch.  Thanks again.

Both had some subtitles needed in them so learning how to do this was quite useful :D"
