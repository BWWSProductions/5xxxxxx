I guess as long as there are racists, war-mongers, morons who believe ancient books of fairy tales as fact, flat-earthers, rednecks, inbreeds, people who hate themselves in general and feel the need to persecute others for the guilt of this ""original sin."" LOL f-n douchbags!!"
,twoname,2009-09-30T05:37Z,"I've debated as to whether or not to comment on your post because I didn't know if you were done with your thought process, but I will.

I don't know if Hannity, Obama, you or anyone else is a so called closet racist but I do know that if I'm going to accuse someone of it I would be intellectually honest enough to at least show some proof or reasoning behind my accusation. 

Second, how does insulting as many other ""groups"" of individuals on a general basis prove or make a case for your thought/comment?

You just grouped a bunch of individuals based on something you believe to be true and expressed a hatred towards them on a general basis. Does that not make you just as bad as an individual that might believe in racism based on skin color?

In my opinion both are equally as intellectually dishonest in that they both generalize individuals based on a common factor and groups them together based on that but chooses to dismiss the differences that each individual has.

I'm not a racist and I believe that based on what I know of Hannity and what he has said in the shows I've heard, leads me to believe that he is also not a racist. 

This is my opinion just like your comment is your opinion. Since I'm looking at you as an individual and commenting on you I belive that given your comments it is you who most closely resembles what you've accused others of.

You would do yourself a service by coming clean with yourself and changing to reflect more like what you deem to a morally superior human being. Just saying..."
