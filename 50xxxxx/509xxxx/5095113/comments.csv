,desekoro,2009-09-21T00:57Z,It is RELOADED's release and the btarena link would allow one to make an educated guess that it is cracked.
,fernbach,2009-09-21T04:59Z,"having trouble with this, but could just be me being a noob. after installing and patching im asked to validate it, I enter the key ppl say to use but it doesnt work, after that i get a message saying the program has stopped working every time I try to start it? "

,hiddendragon,2009-09-22T10:15Z,"Thanks,had trouble getting it to work at first but works fine now.
If your having trouble installing this is what worked for me:
load up iso,install game,when it asks for verification bit just cancel,then explore the iso image to find crack,run update(note..i had to restart pc before running update as it kept failing,once i restarted i was able to complete update)copy BB crack over to where you installed the game,then copy all the other folders over aswell.
Load up game,you will be asked for a key,type 

RELOADED2009-12345678-C84C9
Game should work fine now,worked for me.
Thanks for the upload!"
,fernbach,2009-09-22T10:56Z,"the key isnt working for me, it goes online to validate and then rejects the key. How do I solve this? "

Crack is in the ISO"
[T],dramacore,2009-10-12T00:20Z,"fuck yeah, thanks to reloaded and friends.

game looks worth a try. been waiting to check it out."
,sarge112,2009-10-14T02:03Z,RELOADED2009-12345678-C84C9 does not work. Are there any other keys I can try?
,toothymike,2009-10-26T13:10Z,"the link to www.btarena.org\games\blood-bowl-reloaded isnt working for me, and I cant seem to access btarena either from google or the link."
,Heffay1122,2009-10-31T03:51Z,"This does not, i repeat NOT work. I have tried several times to do this, but it still asks for an activation code."
,Aeronomer,2009-11-05T01:35Z,"Here's what I did to install. When it asks to Activate, just cancel. Installation crapped out during ""Testing Firewall"" phase. Waited it bit and then killed SETUP.EXE and BB.EXE (I think) in Task Manager. Applied update, copied everything in Crack folder to install directory. Started game and used key in the nfo file and I'm playing without a hitch. Great upload. Going to buy this game. "
,shiftygoescrazy,2009-11-08T01:54Z,"Problems with key.
Installed game.
Canceled activation but wudnt finish setup
Task manager ended program.
Runned update in crack but key wont activate."
,Chakragod,2009-11-27T13:23Z,"Once again, the only people complaining that it doesn't work are people that can't follow simple instructions. I just downloaded and installed this about 5 mins ago and it works fine. Follow these instructions:

1. Mount or burn the .iso

2. Run Setup.exe

3. Game will install and pop up a window asking for your key, DO NOT put the key in here,  just click cancel.

4. Go to the Crack folder on the .iso and run the Update. After the game is updated, copy all the files in the Crack folder to the /Program Files/Cyanide/Blood Bowl   folder.

5. Run the BB.exe

6. It will ask you for your key. Copy and paste this key: RELOADED2009-12345678-C84C9

7. PLAY!

This is exactly what I did, and it's working great."
,cometartes1992,2009-11-28T16:23Z,when instaling after apering the message for a verification i click cancel was they say then its always on test firewall
,devansatil,2009-12-02T05:40Z,"No problem getting past the key, but game keeps crashing on the inducement screen before starting a game."
,AgentBuckwald,2009-12-06T06:47Z,"Do not Waste your time with this shitty piece of crap game. its nothing like the original game due to the fact the the probability factor of the supposed ""dice rolls"" tend to favor the AI opponent 90 percent of the time. the rest of the game is spent trying to organize your team back together after half of them are scattered about the field due to a faulty and misconcieving user interface. FUCK THIS BROKEN PIECE OF SHIT"
,nXr77,2009-12-15T20:39Z,can you install the dark elves patch with this version?
,Kojak00,2009-12-29T22:52Z,"I didn't have any problems installing the game, and it plays fine - but, the save function in SP seems to be screwed - neither the autosaves or my saves show up in the file list. Does anyone have a solution?"
,subliminal_city,2010-01-17T22:46Z,Thanks for a wonderful game 
,FingFang,2010-02-08T14:44Z,"Aww... poor little agentbuckwald is sulking cos he lost a few rounds. All he does is throw toys out of his cot anyways!
Game works, dice roll probability is not bias, saves work. The new blitz mode could have been beeter but the turn based game is just like the orignal. Fun & frustrating to play. Just don't try to go online with it. "
,LordBradius80,2010-05-18T22:07Z,"No matter how many times you repeat the process on how to install and enter the code...IT....DOESN'T.....WORK. Save your time, don't download this. I'd rather pay for it that sit here repeating the same process over and over with the same non-working result."
,ThegmxGhost,2010-05-30T17:29Z,IT Works. However I need to know if there is anyway I can install the newer patches. I would like them. But I can't find any cracks. 
,Honum_Boris,2010-06-03T02:56Z,"Just do a google search for ""nymphetamine_BB.part1.rar"", and you'll get patched and cracked up to 1.1.2.1 - I don't know if there are any cracks past that, however.

And to all you retards who couldn't get the game to work... How about following the instructions? Christ, some people..."
,Habzuki,2010-06-17T01:03Z,"How do i register the serial? The serial in the crackfolder is not correct :/ Is it something i do wrong, please tell me then :D"
,commgaunt,2010-09-21T10:25Z,This games works fine 100% no problems.If you having problems with the activation message just cancel it then it might stay stuck on test firewall just restart comp then apply update then copy the crack over.
,Vuze_Azureus,2010-10-30T21:30Z,"hey aitb, you plan or releasing blood bowl legendary edition?"
