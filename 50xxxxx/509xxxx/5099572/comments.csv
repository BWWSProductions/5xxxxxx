If I can help, why not do it? If all the people of the world should think in this way, what a better world it could be... :o)"

The ThinApped Prog has probably been made on an XP machine, and for sure there is a lot of troubles to make them work on Vista, you can imagine doing it on Windows7. I don't know either if Thinstall/ThinApp can work on Vista or W7 too, otherwise there will be the possibility to build up your own version of WLM for each OS. That's one of the reasons I prefer to continue to use the good ol'XP..."
