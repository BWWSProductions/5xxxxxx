Safely encode private files
Security for your PC is no longer a â€˜maybeâ€™, it has now become an absolute must. Experts estimate that it takes as little as 20 minutes before an unprotected computer is infected with an â€˜internet contactâ€™, whether itâ€™s a virus, a Trojan horse or spy software, which stealthily accesses sensitive information before forwarding it to a hacker. For this reason, protecting data that is saved on the individual computer is extremely important.

Ashampoo Magical Security 2 encodes files with sensitive contents so that instead of text and numbers they simply contain an incomprehensible mix of letters. The algorithm is so strong that it isnâ€™t possible for anyone to crack the code in a justifiable time period, even if they are able to draw on a very powerful computer. The security methodology isnâ€™t only effective against the many confirmed hackers in the internet, but also against the spy who might be lurking in your own office and secretly copying files during the lunch break. With Ashampoo Magical Security 2, converting an encoded file back to its readable format naturally poses no problems.

The Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.


This has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.



SUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS
==================================

1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.


2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal

http://www.virustotal.com/

This will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.


3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) 


4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:
 
http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29

and report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.


That's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.


That's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!



Enjoy and remember to seed... :o)
