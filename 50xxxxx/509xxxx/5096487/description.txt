The UN/EU plan to destroy organic farming and to eradicate the Complementary & Natural Health Care Industry

Having spent the past twelve months investigating Codex Alimentarius, I am deeply disturbed by the almost total lack of awareness (or even interest) with regard to the implications of this pernicious global Commission, particularly amongst those most affected by the excesses of this restrictive legislation.

In the words of the National Health Federation, the aims and objectives of Codex Alimentarius are as follows:  

   * Only low-potency, â€œme tooâ€ supplements available that will do nothing for your health.
   * All or most foods genetically-modified.
   * Beneficial supplements unavailable or sold by prescription only.

For many people, this agenda is so outrageous, they cannot believe such goals are achievable; yet this may well be the reality as soon as 31st December 2009, if the Codex Alimentarius Commission continues to disregard input from those who offer a counter perspective to the combined forces of Big Farmer & Big Pharma.  

For the past five years the European challenge to Codex has been led by Dr. Robert Vererk, Executive Director of the Alliance for Natural Health and Scientific Advisor to the National Health Federation. Yet despite the efforts of the ANH, the NHF and the Dr. Rath Foundation the Codex agenda lumbers ever closer to the EU statute books.

In April of 2005, the ANH mounted a legal challenge to the Codex Commission; Justice Leendert A Geelhoed, the European Union Advocate General, refered to the arbitrary powers of the Codex-supporting EU legislation as being "about as transparent as a black box".  

The subsequent 12th July 2005 ruling of the International Court of Justice in Luxembourg followed the July 4th Rome meeting of Codex when the 85 countries present ratified the restrictive guidelines for dietary supplements. Six days after London was awarded the 2012 Olympics and just five days after the London Bombings, there was little mention of the ICJ ruling in the British media.  

Amongst the most disturbing component contained within Article 6 of the EU Directive, is that it strictly prohibits information about diseases being treatable by nutrients and calls for future supplement dosage restrictions.
