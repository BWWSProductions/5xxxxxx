,burnt04,2009-12-02T06:17Z,"Dustyshot, what the FUCK are you complaining about. who really gives a fuck how fast it is, as long as it downloads."
,primalclaws1974,2009-12-23T02:00Z,"burnt04, u are the dumbfuck. That isn't speed, it's bitrate!"
,mistergroenevingers,2010-04-04T21:18Z,"I've downloaded 5 of the albums in this torrent and only one of them (Curb) is actually 320 kbps.
I don't know about ""All the right reasons"" and ""Darkhorse"" since I didn't download those here.
Thanks a lot but don't say it's 320 kbps when it's not. I don't want anything less than 320."
,hajimesaitou538,2010-12-16T21:16Z,"Thanks, man, I've been searching The Long Road in 320kbps for a long time. Are you sure all your disc are in 320, I have some discs heavier than your torrent?
PS: Sorry for the gramathical faults, is no my mother language, but I can talk it well."

I do not know what world you are fucking in, but kbps is not a fucking speed of download. It has nothing to fucking download speed at all. It is a size and quality of the mp3's. Anyone knows that. Even a 6 year old would know that. Get some help man, and learn some shit before you fucking reply to someones comment. Fucking hell there are dumn muther fuckers."

,LAWLEGGE,2011-03-19T06:45Z,Only 1 album @ 320 - Curb. All others @ 187 to 2whatever. Get accurate.
