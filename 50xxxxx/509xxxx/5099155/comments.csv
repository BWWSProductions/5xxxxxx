ps this isnt just the TS cam w/ a spot of touch-up, is it?"
,emptinessispower,2009-09-25T10:31Z,"ok so, NOT a redone TS, as per my last comment potentially suggested, better visual quality than any other cam i've seen so far... however, the audio leaves MUCH to be desired, utterly unintelligible at many points... 
i will not heat my brain deciding how to rate the A/V on a 1-10 scale but suffice to say, if u havnt seen it yet, keep waiting, and i'd suggest you'd wait until at least an R5 surfaces, kuz this is a great movie, one of the few each year that deserves to be put off until you can view it in all its glory.
all the same of course, my gratitude for the CAMmer, thank you for your risk and labor, but this really is one of the very movies that come out each year that deserves your $10 to see in theaters. as far as best movies of 2009 go, definitely in the top 5 i'd say, D9 of course being on that list; yea just wait or see it in theaters worth it."
