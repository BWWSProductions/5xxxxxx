The Principal Story
Premiere Date: September 15, 2009

The Principal Story tells two stories, painting a dramatic portrait of the challenges facing America's public schools â€” and of the great difference a dedicated principal can make. Tresa Dunbar is a second-year principal at Chicago's Nash Elementary, where 98% of students come from low-income families; in Springfield, Illinois, Kerry Purcell has led Harvard Park Elementary, with similar demographics, for six years. Tod Lending (Omar & Pete, POV 2005) and David Mrazek followed both women over the course of a school year, discovering each one's unique styles yet similar passions. The Principal Story takes the viewer along for an emotional ride that reveals what effective educational leadership looks like in the 21st century.

The Principal Story is a production of Nomadic Pictures with funding from The Wallace Foundation. To learn more about the principals, the schools and the national outreach campaign, visit The Wallace Foundation site.
