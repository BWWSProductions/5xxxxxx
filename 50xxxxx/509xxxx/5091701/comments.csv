,viedma,2009-09-17T17:50Z, *@+!# ... No seeding? What's the point of uploading this if you aren't going to seed it? It came down like a rock... up to 3% and then... nothing... What's up?
,pops87pl,2009-09-18T01:32Z,Man... I have to 1st upload it to someone... And I am seeding... just when 20 ppl are dl it at once it takes at least 1 day to make another seed. I got other torrents too... already at this point uploaded 1GB and there is 17%... wait a day...
,pops87pl,2009-09-18T01:33Z,... then it will be going smoothly
,pops87pl,2009-09-18T01:36Z,btw. I remamber when someone uploaded all That's 70s Show Seasons... it took 2 weeks to make another seed. I waited :}
,Numskull808,2010-01-17T11:31Z,thanks for your ups I've never heard of this but I will check it out.  I wish uploaders could block DLers  it would be nice to be able to block shitheads who have no concept about how a torrent works...
