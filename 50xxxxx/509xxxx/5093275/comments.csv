,akhiugo,2009-09-19T14:10Z,"It's in the description wullthebull.

""Norton TrialReset 2010 v1.4BE works but some users reported a problem with the Norton account poppin up every time.

Norton TrialReset 2010 v1.5.0 resets Norton to 362 days and no pop ups of the Norton account.""

Thanks RH, will give it a go. "
,wullthebull,2009-09-19T14:39Z,sorry mate  should have read the description .thankyou 
,sunnydyz,2009-09-19T15:07Z,after installing this reset norton don't start at all on Vista. event uninstaling doesn't help so i had to reinstall NIE and using 30 days trial version. Hope Box will do the job in this period :)
,akhiugo,2009-09-19T17:35Z,"@sunnydyz, I'm using Vista & it worked for me. Try this.

Uninstall Norton completely and reinstall.
Right click the trial reset and run as administrator. Select the 362 day trial but don't choose to reset every time you restart Windows.
Now make sure you restart your PC!"
,sunnydyz,2009-09-19T20:45Z,"somehow i managed nis to work. i did what akhiugo suggested, but that didn't work. then i remembered that there is such tool as norton removal tool. so steps i made was

1. in safe mode uninstalled trial reset and nie
2. in normal mode executed norton removal tool which i downloaded from http://download.softpedia.com/dl/93114dfc9299b94917382a84ad6b5b21/4ab52393/100026173/software/tweak/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe
3. installed nie

that's it. now i have 361 days of subscription remaining. waf? i didn't even install TrialReset (i tried to but after that nie as i mentioned earlier didn't start at all)."

,olikahn,2010-03-20T16:21Z,"hey i install it and it worked  it said 366 days trial but just after i update it and restart my pc
when windows started norton warns that i have two ways one uniistall now or later and it didnet work after that
we cant update norton in this trial that you made???? am i right cause it causes norton understand that we had a previous trial before  and prevent us from using it
( i had a 30 days trial and it finished and i uninistalled it before)"
