FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!"
,swamiolsson,2009-09-24T13:40Z,"@maxaccel: Four Your orientation: Sound is propagated through a medium (water, air, stone) in the microcosmos. In the Macrocosmos, it also propagates through space. Some of this space is at present occupied by Your body. If You keep that body very still for a long time, You'll be able to hear a sound: AUM.
Try it. You may not fail to hear it, or You may. It takes some talent. "

,executionist,2010-10-03T19:17Z,this documentary attempts to prove the supernatural with pseudo science. After watching this I am tempted to make a documentary about a few homeless people and record their experiences of how the flying spaghetti monster influenced their lives.
,GoodolWhatshisface,2011-04-10T16:49Z,"I havent even watched this yet and I am truly amused by maxaccel's ""fail"" comment. Simply because if you fail to see that everything around you is vibrating at different frequencies, then you will fail to understand why you keep getting stuck in a life of treble, with no bass to hold you mid range. Or something like that. So simple it's stupid.
Uh...PASS!!!!!!!!!! "
