Piracy in US Army legal?"
,ojaideadhead,2009-09-23T02:07Z,Thanks so much...can't wait to hear this! 
,CACross12,2009-09-23T04:59Z,Thanks!
,thearches,2009-09-23T21:12Z,"Thanks.  I have a 32k version that's barely adequate in quality.  This one at 128k stereo is overkill, but the quality is excellent and you can always shrink it."
,bballhead,2009-09-24T12:27Z,Is cd 7 missing some files? It's less files and smaller than the rest.
,PryXma,2009-09-27T00:25Z,US Army can do what they want as long as they can blame some so called terrorists ;)

No but stupid comments like that should be."
,ekumunng,2009-09-30T20:32Z,"techdriver

Its a genuine question not comment. 
You Americans always get what suits you, regardless of morality or ethical values. You always sleep with someone who is beneficial to you, that's how great nation you are "
,ekumunng,2009-09-30T20:34Z,"First slept with Taliban in the 80's and now chasing them in Afghanistan reading Dan Brown. :D

The world needs to stop stupidity like that"

,ulliblogas,2009-10-01T00:05Z,"Hello from Greece! I just purchased a book for 15 euros from the bookstore. It is a great book. I am reading and listening to it simultaneusly. It's great. But the download speed should be much more. So please seed more! PLEASSEEE!!!
Special thanks to the uploader!!!"
,neshaminy,2009-10-24T21:39Z,What is your preferred method of creating MP3 files from Audible or audio books?  Which software do you use?  My experience is with NoteBurner/iTunes and I'm not satisfied. Suggestions appreciated....
,gasman364,2009-10-31T18:46Z,"The torrent itself is great.  The book blows chunkage of a major variety.  The 'science' quoted is all pseudo crap not actually supported in the literature, and Dan Brown writes at the level of a 9th grader, playing out ""cliffhangers"" (actually just leaving out information until a later chapter).  For example, ""Catherine noticed she was wiping her ass with an incredible document that had been placed in the roll.  As she read it through the smear, she couldn't believe it.  Chapter 20 . . . then by Chapter 25 . . . ""Catherine remarked to Richard, I forgot to tell you, I wiped my bleeding rectal hemmorhoid with Dan Brown's picture and it burned, oh God it burned . . ."""

,Dagztar,2009-12-22T23:09Z,"To all those poor folk who might mention such obscure indiosinctatic substructional observations as : The 'science' quoted is all pseudo crap"" & ""I just purchased a book for 15 euros from the bookstore... It is a great book""...
Well, honey... Science has to be 'Pseudo' because it cannot be disproved... and buying a book from a book store -  at any price - just can't be wrong...
Try living more than a mile from momma - it may just broaden that tiny, little mind..."

,suede678,2010-01-22T23:51Z,Thanks!!
,Twas_Black,2010-04-05T12:18Z,"wow... solely for the purpose of not wasting your time, people do not read this book. I guess if you have a few days to waste and 25 bucks, but its like a ten year old born again christain saw national treasure, looked of masons on wikipedia, and then decided to write a book. Just a massive waste of time. "
,elax666,2010-04-12T09:53Z,Thank U! And thank U 4 sharing! Excellent work!
,deviloned,2010-04-27T19:33Z,"seems to be virus in ;(

,rider619,2010-05-18T16:37Z,sHANTARAM PLZZZ !!! :)
,igadoter,2010-07-02T12:48Z,"Thank you for the torrent. 

You know I was always curious who will be a husband  of Sophie (from Da Vinici Code). 

That's the question. Some aritocrat? King? Banker? Politician? "
,ColbyCannon,2010-07-08T04:51Z,It is a decent book but not one of his best works.  It is a simple read with simple ideas and concepts.  I would strongly suggest listening to something by Stephen King instead. 6.5/10
,omegastoo,2010-07-12T16:17Z,"Not bad, but FAR too long. Its all supposed to take place in a single evening, 4-5 hours tops, yet book is over 16 hours long. I did enjoy it, but felt that by time I hit disk 12 it should have ended already. I\'d wait for it to be made to a film, Angles & demons and DaVinci code both got shortened a lot, and in my opinion it made them run better."
,DickDickstein,2011-03-18T17:05Z,"Thanks for the up, but I agree with gasman. It's complete shit. It's the kind of book you just want to end. It drags on and on and on and on with absolutely nothing fucking happening. He is completely right with saying that it would probably take 10 chapters for someone to describe the feelings, or the conclusion of their shit. "
,DickDickstein,2011-03-18T17:07Z,oh and try being less of a cunt dagztar and maybe someone will actually want to fuck you someday.
,Kamikatze,2011-11-10T23:35Z,"Sound allright
as for the content, I'll be enjoying that in the weekend

10x for the effort, sheila6"
