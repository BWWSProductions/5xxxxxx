This is a MPG version, converted to MPG from the previous WMA version (WMA version is available at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5084394/Dr_John_Gottman_-_Staying_Strong_As_a_Couple_Audiobook)


This audiobook is from the Dr John Gottman series on love, relationships, marriage and repair.   This helps you to fix what is wrong in your relationships, and make your relationship or marriage stronger.

Dr John Gottman at the Gottman Institute has written several excellent books on marriage and relationships, based on scientific studies on marriage and relationships over many years.

This stuff really does work.  Its not a fancy gimmick.  It really does help strengthen relationships and marriages.


Also look for other stuff by Gottman as its really helpful. e.g. "The Relationship Cure", "10 Lessons to Transform your Marriage", "Why Marriages Succeed or Fail" and "The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work". All good books and worth buying so you can read them several times and write your own notes in them. Getting your partner to read them is also an excellent idea.


Good Luck.
