AiTB u got the green skull so this shit must be real. Keep up the great work.

Thanks :)!"
,D3LinQuENT,2009-09-18T04:02Z,"thanx extremezone for your reply.

The game installs good tho even though it wont work on my pc since i have ATI Radeon 9500 which doesnt seem to be supported!

Can anybody recommend me a good AGP Graphic Card with Pixel Shader 3.0 ?!"
,sale467,2009-09-18T15:10Z,the game is way much better than Fifa 10 for me!

,Jaffa1978,2009-10-09T17:02Z,"D3LinQuENT you can pick up a Sapphire ATI Radeon HD4650 1GB DDR2 for around ÂŁ60 it has shader model:4.1 and supports DirectX 10.1 very good card for the price,or there's other like HD3850,Nvidia GeForce 7600GT,GeForce 7900,GeForce 7950GT

You'd probably be better of buying a cheap motherboard that supports PCI Express,you can get a decent 1 for around ÂŁ30 of the net.Just make sure the motherboard is compatable with your ie your processor & memory.

Look around on the net & compare prices,upgrading your motherboard will be the best thing you'll do,trust me it will like having a new pc :) 

goodluck"
,paraskevas1996,2010-07-08T18:47Z,I WIL PLAY IT BUT I WILL ENJOY THE FULL VERSION IF I FIND HER ANYWHERE.
