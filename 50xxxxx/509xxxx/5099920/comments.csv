,sitbaknrelax,2011-01-29T03:40Z,"Working on 5.0 M33-6, but I did have to go through the steps on the link above in kingsweetings comment. Before going through those steps, it just wouldn't load at all. Gotta say that it's pretty frickin sick though. Looks and plays awesome.  "
,sitbaknrelax,2011-01-29T03:42Z,"I forgot to add that I am using a PSP 1000 to play it on. If anyone is having any trouble going through the mod steps in kingsweetings link, then let me know and I'll do my best to help."
,sitbaknrelax,2011-01-29T03:57Z,"ill-matic says it wont wok on 5.00 m33-6, and he is correct and I had the same thing. However I went through the process in kingsweetings link and now it's working great. My PSP is a 1000 model. If anyone has trouble with going through the process in kingsweetings link. Then let me know and I'll do my best to help out. 

By the way, cheers to Extremezone. I have never left any comments before on your torrents, and I probably should have, because your torrents are probably the ones I download the most. So cheers fulla, your rips are most appreciated."
,klipsch3,2011-02-09T02:57Z,"Okay so first time I downloaded it didn't work, so I went through ""kingsweeting"" link followed all the steps and still not working, so I have a PSP 1001 5.00 M33-4 and for me it didnt work, so far this is the only game that didn't work for me I have tons of other games and they all worked no fix needed, thnx to the uploader for trying though!!"
,sitbaknrelax,2011-02-13T09:04Z,"Klipsch3 ..... Hey I am just pointing out that, on kingsweetings link, it does say that the mod process is for firmware version 5.00 m33-6 so that may be causing you the issue. Clearly you're a bloke too, and didn't have a girl look at the big fuck off letters that say 5.00 m33-6  lol 8-),

You may have to update your firmware. Try this link to do that, it's pretty straight forward to update firmware from m33-4 to m33-6
