Take a bow, boys.  If TPB where a censored site, the last 5 posts would be 1 loooooong beep.  Well, you've managed to cover about 1/8th of the cuss words in the english language in less than 6 posts.  Aren't y'all just so darn proud of yourselves?  Can any of you squeeze in at least a little bit of intelligence in-between all of those cuss words in there somewhere, or is that all you children know how to mutter?"
