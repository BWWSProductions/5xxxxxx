,Royalwitcheeez,2009-09-25T14:26Z,"Works great although I've experienced 1 freeze up but still pretty solid....
All the functions work and this update is the best version of pro to date.

I've been using T33 still because Pro was horrible and unusable but this update fixes a ton of issues the previous version of pro had....

Like the others, this works w/my Vinyl scratch....
Thx again Murlok"
,Royalwitcheeez,2009-09-26T01:08Z,"Ok, I've experienced the Freeze up again. The Pappy doesn't freeze, neither does my ZERO 4 so this is a TP issue.
I will be installing this on my Home rig now and see if it still persisits.
I've also read on the NI forum of someone else experiencing this so.........
details to follow."

,DJDRFox,2009-11-08T11:13Z,"Hi

I have downloaded this, thank you. Does it need a key to activate and is it virus free?"
,gw1zr1824,2009-11-30T20:37Z,"I've  been  running  this  with  no  problem  at  all  on  Windows  7  32bit  since  September  and  ever  since  a  couple  days  ago  it  just  stops  while  running  and  says 'Traktor  has  stopped  working. Windows  is  looking  for  a  solution  to  this  problem  and  you  will  be  notified  so  and  so. '
Has  this  happened  to  anyone  else?"
,Cookwowz,2009-12-03T03:16Z,Does anyone have a torrent for the timecode cd's?
,steve7268,2009-12-24T03:17Z,"Oh, boy.  I am having some problems.  I used to have Vista 32, and traktor was working really well save for a few minor irritations.  I upgraded to Windows 7, installed this same file, and it refuses to work.  It installs just fine, and upon the first run, nothing seems wrong.  But when i try to set the audio output i get a ""windows has encountered a major issue (or something)""  message and it has to shut down.  The very first time the error came, it was a C++ runtime error.  Now it is different for some reason, but it still doesn't work.  

I really don't want to go back to vista and I will install XP if i have to but does anyone have any clue what is going on?  thanks i really appreciate it."

,86GTi,2010-03-16T15:37Z,"Sorry to say...but it seems that this does not work properly with CDJ 400 pioneer...
I have installed and all ( serveral times ) and my Players are connected on USB before i start traktor so that the software can recognize the players.
BUT the problem is when i try Traktor pro Demo from Native instruments i get Message on players : turn encoder and than i can pick player A or B on each player.
But in this version I dont get any message and i am only able to control deck A with bought players.... i have been using ASIO and bought players are activated...  i am running Windows xp 

if anyone know what i am doing wrong please contact me on LimitedPioneer@hotmail.com"
