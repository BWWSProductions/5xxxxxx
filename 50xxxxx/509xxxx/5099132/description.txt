Studio; Chuck Liddell DWTS; Qaddafi; Jennifer Aniston; Mackenzie 
Phillips; Childhood Stories; Bill's Hole



Note: I'm planning on "retiring" from posting O&A (it's simply a 
logistics thing) in December of this year. No point in upping 
when someone else could be doing it faster. That's 3 months to 
find a reliable O&A upper to serve the pests.

Edit: If worse comes to worse I can still do the 128k ups in the
evenings post December, it's better than nothing.
