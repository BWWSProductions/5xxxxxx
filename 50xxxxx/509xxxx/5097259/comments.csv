,pysilocibin,2009-09-24T00:04Z,"Videos great, this rips ruined by the sound, distortion at every explosion of which there are lots.

Films lovely to look at but is star trek for the mtv generation, once again a remake thats total shite.

go elsewhere peeps 5/10, sound is 50% of a film."
,pysilocibin,2009-09-24T00:17Z,"things come in 3s...

Why they dont explain how a one world government eradicates war/famine/racism thus allowing humans to evolve is beyond me, that is the basis of star trek.

This is a horrible take on it, worse even than Enterprise.

Worst thing about it, they made Kirk ugly."
