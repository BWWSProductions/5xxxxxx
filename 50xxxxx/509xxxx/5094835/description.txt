Mirrorpool is my experimental electronica project. It's not about writing songs, it's about inventing sounds.
Everything started in 2007 when I decided to start solo project for realizing my musical ideas. In 2008 and 2009 I experimented a lot with different sounds, synthies and instruments.
After one year of hard work, I'm proud to release my first album "The Future Sound Of Berlin".

Feel free to download it here on PirateBay.
