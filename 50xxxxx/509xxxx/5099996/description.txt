SYNOPSIS: "Glen and Randa," takes place in an unspecified time after a nuclear holocaust. Free of the apocalyptic battles and black-leather-clad demagogues that would soon come to dominate this genre, this pic starts with, and stays with, the commonplace, such as mining mountains of refuse for usable canned goods. From comic books, Glen has an image of a shining city somewhere "out there." He and the by-now pregnant Randa (they're teenagers) set out on a journey to find it. Along the way, they find a horse, a house, a companion, an ocean where there ought not to be one, and a boat. No pillars of fire. No Statue of Liberty toppled on the beach. This is a small movie that views the small subject of day-to-day survival from a strictly human viewpoint.

 .  Anyone knowing the dodgy history on this one will be glad to see this.
    It has never looked better. I don't know where the 2.0 rating came from, most of the comments are
    positive.
