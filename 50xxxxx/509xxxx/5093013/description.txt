In the summer of 1944, the Second World War entered its end-game when the Allies launched two major operations that would drive back German forces on both the Western and Eastern Fronts at once. In the ultimate test of military strategy, Order of War will challenge you not only to lead Americas finest to victory in the West, but also place you in command of German forces charged with repelling the Red Armys seemingly unstoppable offensive in the East. Even the keenest military minds will find that its one thing to make history, but quite another to change it. Do you have what it takes to command.
