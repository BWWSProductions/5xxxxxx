,reem,2009-09-17T05:27Z,Am I the only one who's having trouble with trackers of EZTV/PirateBay torrents?!?! There's something wrong.
,navel,2009-09-17T09:16Z,"I can't download from eztv! uTorrent says that ""http://eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org/annouce"" is timeout and ""udp://eztv.tracker.thepiratebay.org:80/announce"" is incorrect address. 
Does anyone have familiar problem? "
,fonzie1983,2009-09-17T09:35Z,Same problem here. Cannot download anything from eztv. No seeders and no leechers when I download.
