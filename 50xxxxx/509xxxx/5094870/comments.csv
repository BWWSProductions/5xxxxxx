THIS IS A SHITTY CAM.

CAM of an animated movie?  No! it's recorded live.  It's kinda tough of the animators though. :P

,almostaquad,2009-09-26T07:20Z,ottawabroker - I'll bet 99% of us had it figured out that this was a cartoon when we saw the title. Who did you think Superman & Batman were? 
,Cessate,2009-09-27T09:27Z,"Great film, easily the best of the DC Animated movies yet, next to New Frontier.

Only an hour long, but that's keeping in mind that most of the DCUOA movies are no longer than 80min long anyways.

A - 10
V - 10

Thanks for the upload."
