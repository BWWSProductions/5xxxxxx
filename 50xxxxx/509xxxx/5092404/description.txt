The Mortal Kombat: Annihilation OST in 320 CBR Joint Stereo.

I bought this CD a long time ago, and it still has some amazing songs in here despite how old it is. Songs like "Death is the Only Way Out", "Engel", "2 Phone Calls and an Air Raid", and a lot of others. I actually tried to find this album as a torrent but there seems to be no good ones out for this. 

So... for those who love industrial metal, acid, techno, breaks, and old school techno, or if you just want a pretty good rip to complete your current MK collection :) this is for you!
