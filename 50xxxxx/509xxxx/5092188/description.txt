Set in feudal Japan a time of upheaval of samurai warriors and isolated 
villages comes this story of a gun-wielding, young brave princess who was raised 
by wolves named Princess Mononoke who is sent to an ancient, forested land 
to defend the forest from human encroachment which threatens to unbalance the forces 
of nature. Ashitaka intervenes to stop the two sides fighting and takes San back to
