      New album from Marit Bergman. This is the third version of this album. The
      first two, a single CD and a double CD version, were released in March.
      This is a re-release with a new track on the second cd. Oddly enough, none
      of the other versions were ever ripped.

      Marit Bergman once described her musical genesis as "Madonna > X-Ray Spex
      > Discharge > Sonic Youth > Roberta Flack > Mary J. Blige," which at very
      least points to her aural eclecticism if not the widescreen pop grandeur
      of her solo work and her rich, expressive voice. Born in a small town in
      central Sweden in 1975, Bergman started writing songs at the age of 12,
      and formed her first band at 17, the pop-punk group Candysuck, who made
      their recording debut with the witty but controversial hit "Kill Your
      Boyfriend." But it was when Bergman released her first solo album, Three
      A.M. Serenades, on her own Sugartoy label in 2002 (three years after
      Candysuck called it quits) that critics began to sit up and take notice.
      The album earned fine reviews and impressive sales for an independent
      release, and in 2003 she was signed to the Swedish branch of RCA/BMG,
      which promptly reissued the album. Bergman's next album, Baby Dry Your
      Eyes, was a major success and earned her two Swedish Grammy Awards as Best
      Female Artist and Best Songwriter. Her third album, 2006's I Think It's a
      Rainbow, was an ambitious collection embracing poignant singer/songwriter
      material, joyous '60s-style girl group sounds, smart, effusive
      contemporary pop, and much else; the album helped to spread Bergman's
      reputation outside the Nordic regions, though at this writing she remains
      unsigned in the United States and Europe.
