,Zorcher,2010-05-11T06:31Z,"I am liking this season more and more every time I view it.

I haven't watched all the episodes yet, but thanks for uploading.  Digimon is my favorite anime and I've watched every season.  I still need to acquire seasons 2 and 3 however in subs."

,bananacrammer,2010-06-08T16:33Z,"I'm seeding, but only downloading four episodes at a time, starting with the first.  Right now, I'm downloading 5-8.  If you're having trouble, I suggest only downloading four at a time."
