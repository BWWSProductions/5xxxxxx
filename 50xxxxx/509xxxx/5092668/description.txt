After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
       
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	       
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	       
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce       
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce       
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce       
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce       
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce       
http://tracker4.finalgear.com:80/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.
__________________________

I reseed some of my torrents, waiting for the Pirate Bay's fate to evolve.
If, as it seems from the last news, it won't be sold to people who would make you pay for P2P, more torrents will follow to recover my old shares. If the next TPB owner will impose fees I will delete them all again.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

What follows is the merge of 4 different torrents, just to minimize, with the few bandwidth I have, the numbers of torrents I have to manage...
Also I see that bigger torrents have longer life and more seeders in the average

PIERRE BENSUSAN

Pierre Bensusan is a French-Algerian guitarist. 
The genre of his acoustic guitar music is often characterized as Celtic, Folk, World music, New Age, or Chamber jazz.
He signed the contract for his first album, Pres de Paris, when he was just seventeen.
He has a reputation as something of an innovator in the field of solo acoustic guitar, including his use of the DADGAD tuning system, and his experimentation with electronics such as delays, distortions and volume pedals.

ALEX DE GRASSI

Despite the italian name and the german look, Alex De Grassi is an american 
guitarist.
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_grassi  
http://degrassi.com/

One of de Grassi's trademarks is his ability to create a highly orchestrated sound using his solo guitar and making a wide use of open tunings. Without overdubs, his playing weaves together melody, counter-melody, bass, harmony, rhythm, and cross-rhythms is such a way as to give the feeling of various instruments playing together. Using a broad palette of techniques and timbre, and driven by a unique sense of composition, his intricate guitar pieces begin to take the listener beyond the instrument into a complex tapestry of sound.

What follows is a collection of his albums (mostly from the first part of his career). Preparing this torrent today, I read in the FAQ section of his site that some of these albums are unavailable in music stores (!).

So enjoy these "unexpected" rarities.

PETER FINGER

Peter Finger is a german guitarist, also founder of the label Acoustic Guitar.
  
http://www.acousticguitar.com/
  
http://www.peter-finger.com/

His music springs from the French atmospheres 'a la Debussy' with a strong use of chromatic scales...
His style mixes classic music, rock, jazz, blues, celtic in a unique manner...

[...] quand un poeme exquis amene les larmes au bord des yeux, ces larmes ne sont pas la preuve d'un exces de jouissances, elles sont bien plutot le temoignage d'une melanconie irritee, d'une postulation des nerfs, d'une nature exilee dans l'imparfait et qui voudrait s'emparer immediatement, sur cette terre meme, d'un paradis rÃ©lÃ©vÃ©.
                              Charles Baudelaire "Notes nouvelles sur Edgar Poe" 

(when an exquisite poem brings one's eyes to the point of tears, those tears are not evidence of an excess of joy, they are witness far more to an exacerbated melancholy, a disposition of the nerves, a nature exiled among imperfect things, which would like to possess, without delay, a paradise revealed on this very same earth.)


Enjoy this collection of albums from his discography
