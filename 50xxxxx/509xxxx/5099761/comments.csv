,TerryN,2009-09-25T22:52Z,"WARNING : Dont modify this Windows Sevené€Ÿ Eternity Edition 2009 in anyway

so you catch an early ISO, modify it without asking, and then you have the guts to warn us.
Make my day Punk! Send the cops!"
,xXWolfyXx,2009-09-26T03:29Z,"You can use an activator. We are not posting pre-activated OS anymore cause we were shut down by M4 for that.

Also all of these files are digitally sig. So you mess with the files they will not work. 
"
,xXWolfyXx,2009-09-26T03:32Z,"WE are allowed to Edit this OS in anyway. However it is then copyrighted by us because WE actually ReCODED EVERYTHING. 

Barly any of the codes in here are actually from M4, they are 99% ours. 

We just ahev to not take full copyrights because they created the design and the name of it. "

,tonyk123,2009-09-27T09:07Z,"thank you, enjoyed your version of vista, looking forwards to trying this!"
,sop4582,2009-09-28T04:28Z,"I am having problems installing this program.  It gets past the initial restart and gets to the ""completing installation"" portion, but then the screen goes black and I get nothing.  Any ideas?  I let it sit like that for about an hour and a half before I restarted and booted into vista."
,xXWolfyXx,2009-09-29T01:03Z,make sure your computer has enough space to install. Also make sure everything is compatible. WE suggest you format your partitions and install it on one. So it has all space to operate. 
,sop4582,2009-09-29T03:15Z,I ran the upgrade advisor and the only thing it pointed out is my printer.  I have four hard drives including one external.  The HD that I am trying to install it on has been formatted several times.  I have also trying deleting the partition and creating a new one and I have the same problem.  I am at a loss.  Can anyone help?

,eastsider_roadrunner_com,2009-10-07T01:01Z,"For anyone wondering, 7 is an awesome OS with faster speeds, and out of this world reliability.  Make the switch to x64 today.  It's well worth it."

,h3x6969,2009-10-20T07:57Z,You upload a torrent in PirateBay. Hence the name. How can you copyright? F... Your copyright....
,giggedyguy,2009-11-17T04:38Z,"He can copyright it because he has an agreement with Microsoft that allows him to customize it without infringing on THEIR copyrights. The customizations are copyrighted. 

Many people upload copyrighted software as torrents. Just because it's free doesn't mean you cannot copyright it.

It's not a cracked version of windows, otherwise Ben would be in trouble with MS. Unlike most people on these sites, he's an honest man.

Sure you can get a bypass for this version just like every other version."
,xXWolfyXx,2009-11-20T03:17Z,"This torrent it 4.04 gigs...that is it. I would suggest using this one, for we added tweaks to run faster and be more stable. "

my current os is Vista Eternity Ultimate by Benjamin ..yea lots of stuff added .."
,HelicopterBen,2010-11-04T03:01Z,Flawless- I was very happy with benjamins Vista for 2 years and now this is great. Installed perfectly 1st time. Some people may want Daz'z activator for testing purposes of course. Here it is- straight from Daz himself http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/8632-Windows-Loader-The-Official-Thread
,Shoobox,2012-01-26T18:32Z,"I have yet to see anything impressive by rockers team.
 They have yet been able to balance the OS and blend the themes together. looks more like they just put a collage of backgrounds together and bloated down more software into it.
 Also to claim that its not pirated is silly but is true, is called hacking whenever you change the form of a program.
Never the less I'm not impressed.
 When they come out with a solid functional OS ISO then they might get my thanks"
