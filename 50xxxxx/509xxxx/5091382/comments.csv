The NTR v1.5 has been reported as one of the most stable versions if it's installed and uninstalled again once it converted Norton to 366 days. After all NTR's 2010 work but I guess a few more updates will follow.

Seems like Norton now has two steps ahead of EDGE: after the EDGE keygen for Norton 2007 and 2008 there still is no keygen for Norton 2009. That doesn't look for for EDGE, now that Norton 2010 is out for a while. Their keygen for Norton 2008 alrready was late: Norton 2009 was out by then."
