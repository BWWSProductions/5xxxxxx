,viralencore84,2011-02-20T16:33Z,Some of the reasons why this isn't working for people is your game might not install to where you think. You must go to program files 86 on Vista cut out the files in cod waw folder and then go to user profile folder appdata local  activision and then if codwaw file isn't in there then create one but it should be there. Paste the files in there then get all the patches and put them in there then install them. create mod folder and put any mods you have in them. I'm just telling you what worked for me good people. Be sure to set the patches in the cod waw file first b4 installing. That will make this crack play zombie maps and mods.
