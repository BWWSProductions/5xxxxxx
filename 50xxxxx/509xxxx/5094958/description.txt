Bondage Fairies
From Last.fm

Bondage Fairies is a â€œnintendo-death-punkâ€ band that formed in Stockholm, Sweden. They are named after a japanese hentai graphic novel.
The band consists of Elvis Creep (lead vocals, guitar, sinthetizer) and Deus Deceptor (vocals, bass, sinthetizer). The duo came together in 2001, Elvis after being rejected from art school, and Deus being a budding computer scientist.

They always wear masks on-stage and in pictures, which they say are inspired on japanese robots and robots from the seventies. As for why they wear these masks, Elvis says: â€œThis way we spare people red and sweaty faces; there are already so many sweaty bands, so no need for another. Plus, they look pretty cool.â€
They have released two albums and two singles to date. He-man 7â€ (2005), What You Didnâ€™t Now when You Hired Me (2006), Garbage Indiebands (2008) and Cheap Italian Wine (2009).
