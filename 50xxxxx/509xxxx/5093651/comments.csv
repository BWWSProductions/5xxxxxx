,GlenPMP,2009-11-06T21:21Z,"Great quality torrent, any chance of uploading episode 4 from series 6? Or know where I can get it?"
,lollager,2010-01-05T21:00Z,"I have uploaded it here, too, but as anonymous and PB has since lost it. I can't even re-upload it because it keeps whining ""torrent exists"". Someone has the same version on other torrent sites and they are found easily via Google. The same name and everything."
