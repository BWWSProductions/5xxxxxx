,PROTEOUS271158,2009-09-20T05:07Z,"Wow! I can't beleive anybody thinks they can buy something that isn't being sold yet.All the crap on ebay are knock offs of the free test versions. This was out months ago! it's not bad LOOKING! but IT LACKS DRIVERS AND HAS MASSIVE SOFTWARE COMPATABILITY ISSUES JUST LIKE VISTA IN THE BEGINNING BECAUSE IT IS VISTA WITH A DIFFERENT HAT ON AND A RUBBER NOSE! It all starts with the antivirus incompatability issues wanting you to purchase the latest version of whatever ones it steers you to and goes on from there.You need a new this,that and more of these.hell buy a notebook so you're no longer able to burn copies to keep and just rent every song and vid like the apple dinks! jeez wake up people!"
,PROTEOUS271158,2009-09-20T05:30Z,Istarted the download then synced with my copy and now the seeds are starting.Give it a try and when your ecitement at having the newest goodest bestest next thing dies down come back and write an honest opinion based on your experience using it for a week or two.Not an ooogoody i have it and it's blue an pretty and shiney new kind of quack like 90% of the stuff I've been reading.
,PROTEOUS271158,2009-09-20T10:18Z,"From 1 seed to 370 seeds in 6hrs 30 min. now that's how you get the ball rolling set your bandwidth on high and let it seed for a few hours.don't get all excited and hit and run when your downloads done.this whole sharing thing will never last like that. See how well that worked ! Now all someone has to find is an activation or loader that will actually work and kill the timer cause this one don't quite cut the mustard. this one looks worth a shot next on my list   (Windows 7Loader by Orbit30 And Hazar 32,64Bit v1.5)"

Thanks Rip! 
Don't get me wrong .My horns ain't pointed in your direction.Although rereading my Tirade it does seem like that to me now.
Please accept my aplogies.
I'm just so tired of the scammers out there actually selling this stuff as the real deal,doing it for no other reasons than sheer greed, one upmanship and some warped notion of a type of fame and glory. 
The drivers need some work but that's $MS's bungling. As for the codecs I've seen a win 7 pack on here somewhere ,haven't tried it yet though. The loader I mentioned does seem to work better(takes a few min and dosn't give any indication of what stage it's at,just have to wait till it reboots and says permanently activated) and checking winver comes up with registered .
EVERYBODY MAKE SURE YOU LOAD WIN 7 AND THE LOADER OFFLINE! Unplug your connection to be sure.
And once again oopsy, sorry Rip!
I was a baaaad pirate."

Your awesome!! :D"
,Alensia,2009-09-24T20:53Z,"For idiots like me, when the installation asks for Product Key, leave it blank. I learned this accidentally after 30 minutes of brainstorm when I tried to enter Win 7 RC key I've gotten from Microsoft."
,Zenotek,2009-09-26T22:19Z,"I'm too stupid to use the activator. I run the program as administrator, click ""Activate"", and it goes through some command line gibberish then restarts my computer. When I log in, Windows asks me to go online and activate Windows. Help?"
,Zenotek,2009-10-02T02:49Z,Haven't got a different activator yet?
,kelokata,2009-10-02T21:36Z,"DvDripvanwinkle ,please how to enable Windows 7 with activator?What to do in activator to be activated Windows 7??? Please how to activate ??? Thanks a lot man."
