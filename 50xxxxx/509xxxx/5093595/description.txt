Following the success of its predecessor, Family Trainer: Extreme Challenge allows players to embark on more than a dozen extreme activities, ranging from water skiing in the pristine waters of the Pacific to climb, skate, base jump stunt jumps or between many others. These activities will be as intense but easy to play force us to work on our entire body, burns calories and helps you stay in shape. Again, the Wiimote will combine with the original Family Trainer mat giving you a total body experience and a more vibrant and exciting gameplay.
