Proper Notes:

We're sorry for the screwup. Blame it on the lame Steam
service, that said game was 100% and fully updated. This was
of course not the case.

This edition of the update is an all-inclusive update meaning
you can apply it on initial 1.0 version. You can of course
also update directly from Razor's latest update.

Again, sorry for the fuckup!

BUT I don't know if this torrent contains the proper crack as it was online shortly after the update came online. :-("

Empire.Total.War.v1.4.Update.REPACK-SKIDROW

Is life and coming to the bay soon, I guess."
