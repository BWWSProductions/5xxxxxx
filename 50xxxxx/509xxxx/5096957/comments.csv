[T],metalcore.,2009-11-26T15:39Z,"well....its included as a second audio track...therefore, if you burn it as a datadisc, when it plays it will play the original audio track, and you can activate the commentary track by hitting the audio button on your dvd remote control, which will scroll you through the audio tracks (of which there are 2). im not sure if you can ""un-mux"" the second track, you will have to google around to see if thats possible."
