Bleach Movie 2 - The Diamond Dust Rebellion

Outline:
Captain Hitsugaya, is assigned to guard the Ouin, the staggeringly powerful seal of the royal family of the Seireitei, as it's transported amid great pomp. When the Ouin is stolen, the Soul Society declares Hitsugaya an outlaw. Although he wants to recover the stolen artifact alone, Ichigo insists on helping him: that's what friends do. The thief is Kusaka, who was Hitsugaya's closest friend when they were training to become Soul Hunters--until they were ordered to duel for the possession of an enchanted sword. Everyone thought Hitsugaya killed Kusaka, but he somehow survived. His quest for vengeance pits Kusaka against the most popular Captain and Lieutenants from the series: Renji, Matsumoto, Kenpachi, Byakuya, Yoruichi--and Ichigo and Hitsugaya--in a spectacular battle.
