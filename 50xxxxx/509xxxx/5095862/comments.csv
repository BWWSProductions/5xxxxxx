,Stoffe92,2010-02-16T20:55Z,Hi....Thx for the game....i have just one question.....can you play multiplayer with this one?
,bennemans,2010-05-26T19:08Z,"All guys who have probs with no fullscreen.. You can do 2 things.
1) go to your root folder and open 'GraphicsSettings'.. not the exe but the configuration file.. when you open it search for fullscreen and change the 0 in 1.
2) Or the easiest thing that works for almost every game: just see the game screen is active and then press alt+enter.. it will toglle to full screen

Thanks shroo! somebody know how I can play this game with joystick?"
,Mork_Blasphemy,2010-05-28T03:08Z,"Shroo done it again,thanks man,this game works great as all your games do,and it is in fact a good game will seed it till 3.0 ratio... about the windowed thingy,even if you guys can't get it full screen,its still very playable,it presents absolutely no problem to me,and never forget:above all this is a FREE game,so enjoy what you get :)"
