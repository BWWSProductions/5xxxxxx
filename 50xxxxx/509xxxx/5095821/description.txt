â€œOHIO SUICIDEGIRLS SAY:
Ohio Summer:
Did you know that there are over 30 Suicide Girls in the state of Ohio. Some of us have always lived here....and some of us came to shoot with Alissa and party with our SG sisters and loved it so much that we moved here!
One thing is for sure, Ohio is an amazing place to be a Suicide Girl! If you're an SG in Ohio, there is always someone around when you need a shoulder to lean on, a friend to party with, or someone to talk to, and the monthly SG parties that we throw are always a blast!

Alissa invited all of the Ohio girls over to her house to shoot a set that would show just how much fun it is to be a Suicide Girl in Ohio! 12 girls came and partied away the afternoon! We wanted to send out hugs and kisses to the girls who couldn't make it....we really missed you! Plans are in the works for us all to get together again soon though....

Thanks again to Alissa for bringing us all together and for making Ohio one of the coolest places to be a Suicide Girl!â€
