This dude just uploaded a torrent from mininova or someplace else. He didn't think before he did, just copied it.

And how can it be an album at that low size? It's probably just a single released form the album (which isn't out yet).

,TheQw,2009-09-28T18:03Z,"The debut album of Dead by Sunrise is called ""Out of ashes"", and is due to be released on October 13th (except for Japan where it might get released as early as September 30th). When opening the audio file in this torrent, its called ""Linkin Park - Painted Pictures"". This is NOT a song on the upcoming album. The singer on this song does sound like Chester Bennington in the beginning, but later on you can hear that its just not his sound (and neither is the music of the song). TBH tho hard to determine because of all the glitches...

Bottom line: its a fake. Poor PR for an upcoming band?!
