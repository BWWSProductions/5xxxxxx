Smokie live at Cirkus Stockholm:


Blue intro 

Something's been making me blue 

Lay back in the arms of someone 

Back to you 

Tomorrow 

Boulevard of broken dreams 

MEDLEY: 

It's your life (medley) 

Take good care of my baby (medley) 

Mexican girl (medley) 

A few dollars more (medley) 

Wild angels 

If you think you know how to love me 

Changing all the time 

Home is anywhere you are 

Baby it's you 

Don't give me that 

Don't play your rock'n'roll to me 

I'll meet you at midnight 

Oh Carol 

Needles & pins 

Have you ever seen the rain 

Living next door to Alice 

Blue outro
