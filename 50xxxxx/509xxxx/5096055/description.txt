They the inspiring, playful, powerful, interesting and very clever animals, that possess some magic connection with the people: dolphins. You will see these majestic animals in the natural living environment in the largest sea preserve in the world. But so you will be able to observe under the fact, as dolphins they dance and play with the camera, they dive or simply clown. Never earlier than these animals you saw so closely!




It really is a great documentary with music instead of somebody speaking.
