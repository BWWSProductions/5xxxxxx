video quality  may not be up to some peoples standards  in that it looks a little stretched out..but if  your not too picky and want a good though not great copy of this movie here it is..i hate dubbed movies  and so this is the original korean language version and it has the  english subtitles  perfectly synced and hardcaoded  in the movie..so this one is ready to go     thanks for the uplaod  "
