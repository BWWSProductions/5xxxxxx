The Beatles finest work just got a makeover. "Sgt Peppers", voted as the greatest album of all time by ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE, has recently being remasted. The new Beatles remasters are very hard to find on the internet. As for the qaulity, you can hear things that you couldnt before, ultimatly the blearing noise of the trumpets on "Good Morning". but its not just the remastered tracks that make this amazing, it also includes a mini documentary on the making of Sgt. Peppers, unrealesed before.
