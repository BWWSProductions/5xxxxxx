VHS rip ,its not the whole show or the best quality but there are some things that

 are not available on his website http://www.steveoedekerk.com/ 


This show aired only once in 1997 which is a dam shame, it was good. Most of the skits can be 

seen on his site but some of the extras are here. Approx 28 min.
