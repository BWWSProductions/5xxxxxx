,Blue_Flames,2009-09-22T08:07Z,"Thanks, I love this film.

I would say though (trying to be constructive here...) the film is widescreen (2.35:1) so encoding it 1280x720 is including the borders which maybe a bit of wasted bandwidth/space?

Now, I have -no- idea if encoding the borders has any effect on the file size (I would guess not much, it's just black after all, right?) but it seems to be standard for pretty much any rip (hd/sd in whatever format) to not include the borders, although I don't know how you would go about doing that.

Oh, thanks for including both audio tracks & the subs."
,burnminion,2009-09-22T13:23Z,"The bars at the top and bottom are there on purpose so that the video is true 720p (1280x720 pixels) and thus 100% AVCHD Compliant, which means you may use the multiAVCHD software (described in the 'General Information' tab above) to quickly burn this movie to a DVD-R disc and play back on virtually any common BluRay player, PS3, or XBOX. (Note: Non-AVCHD Compliant video has to be re-encoded {to add the bars} thus reducing quality, wasting lots of time, and bloating file size).
Enjoy the show!"
,burnminion,2009-09-24T00:13Z,"I wish I could please all. I have also read just the opposite comments posted on 'scene uploader' torrents by folks who were upset because the torrent was listed as 720p and they felt it was misrepresented because the video wasn't true 720p height thus they could Not easily burn to AVCHD disc for their BluRay player without having to re-encode.

I am not a 'scene' uploader. I only encode for our family and friends, then if I search torrents and cannot find a good reasonably sized h264 version, I share mine to give back to the torrent community."
,JAGUAR7,2009-10-15T22:00Z,"Its Real Wonderful!

Rip Quality Is Very Good Considering The Size.

The Sample Video Has Only One Audio track [English Is Missing]

But Don't Be Hopless. 
The Main Movie Has Dual Audio 5.1 As The Description Says.

A/V-9.5/9.0

Movie-8.5/10



Thanks A Lot RipMinion.

This Is My First From You. And Its Great.
Just One Problem. I Think Besides The Muxed English Subtitle There Is
Another English Subtitle Which Is HARDCODED 
Or May Be Not?

However, Wating For 
HERO
CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON
CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER.

I'm right now downloading ""Hero"" from this place: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5087736/Hero.2002.1080p.BluRay.DTS.x264-EOS
It's big - 12,1 GB but the DL goes very fast (1Mb/s). It's a blueray (AR 2,35) so the quality is supposed to be very good.

,swamiolsson,2009-10-17T14:05Z,"And a lot of thanks to You, burnminion.

,jrocsexy2000,2011-02-21T00:09Z,How do I get just one audio track> It's mixed.
,mgd37,2011-05-26T19:31Z,Thanks 4 postin'.
,s_t_o_r_m,2011-08-28T01:11Z,"Fucking hardcoded subtitles!!!
Piece of fucking shit!!!"
,Thor-csf,2011-09-17T06:51Z,"Agree with s_t_o_r_m. You shouldn't put hard encoded subs!
What about the persons whose english is not their native tongue and wants to watch the movie with subs in their language?

What's the point of 3 english subs (the hardcoded one, the embedded (timed text) and the external .srt)?! Why?
You should include just the .srt. This way nobody will be disadvanteged. And the movie will be able to be played anywhere (including HDTV's media players that can't handle movies with embedded subs, which is my case).

Moreover, the audio is stereo, not 5.1 (at least according to Media Player Classic)."
,Loaki9,2011-09-18T06:14Z,"Great torrent. Great film.  Thank you.  Don't mind the haters.  

To the haters, if you have a problem with this torrent, get it somewhere else.  He wrote in the comments that he is not a scene UL and is not doing this for you, or the general public.  You just happen to be benefiting from him doing it for someone else.

Thanks burnminion."
,Thor-csf,2011-09-18T10:07Z,"Correction: Media Player Classic was showing wrong info. Both audio tracks are indeed 5.1 channels (just checked with ""MediaInfo""). Sorry for the misinfo.

@Loaki9

If you are referring to me, I am no hater. I think hate is a very strong feeling. I do not hate this torrent nor the uploader. LOL.

I thank his goodwill. I'm just giving a suggestion that he shouldn't put hardcoded subtitles, as not everybody will want to watch the movie with english subs; futhermore, if there's also a dubbed audio track in english, there would be no need of english subs. Therefore, he shouldn't put the hardcoded subs. Just the external .srt would be sufficient; at most, the embedded one (that has the option to turn off). ;)"
,SeaWitch,2011-10-07T04:52Z,"I love this movie!!
The quality is amazing!!!!
But.... Hardcoded subs??!! What a pity!!!!!
:'("
,4ditto,2012-01-12T02:20Z,"Am I missing something here? HARD CODED SUBS! What is up with that? Are you Dutch or Swedish? The video is in English and so are the subs (which aren't even close half the time?) Please don't be anal and use .srt's instead.

Other then that .. thank you for a quality upload (until one comes along without the HARD CODED SUBS!)

And P.S. You don't need to elaberate on 90% of the bullshit specs you provided. (Who gives a shit about the 'Colorimetry', etc? And if they do, they probably drink their wine from a bottle rather then a box, but couldn't tell you the diffrence anyway!"
,osriccc,2012-03-25T19:47Z,I should have read the comments before download. Hardcoded subs screwed it up.
,MrLeecher,2012-05-27T06:58Z,Thanks for uploading :)
