,FebDixi,2011-06-18T22:18Z,"This doesn't work for me

the game will boot, and I can run around, but there are no textures. Just the main character running around on black abyss nothingness, with the occasional object (usually torch) in the distance. It's unplayable.  

Using PSCX2, not having problems with other games. "
