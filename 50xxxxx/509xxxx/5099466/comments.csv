Jack Davenport's character is a quantum physicist who ran a particle accelerator that went bad and threw everybody's consciousness into the future due to the ""Observer Effect"" of Quantum Singularity Theory. The plot unfolds as a conspiracy involving the government who want to cover it up and a billionaire experimenting on achieving immortality by transfering his consciousness to artificial bodies and uses Davenport to crate another Flash Forward to see if he is still alive several billion years in the future.

Nicholas Cage's character dies with the rest of the human race whilst aliens take his son and several other kids to a new planet.

Ewan McGregor's and Scarlett Johansson's characters are clones of rich people to be used as future organ donors.
