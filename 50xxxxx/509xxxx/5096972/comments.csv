,BluRayPro,2009-12-18T04:30Z,"CyberLink PowerDVD Ultra 9 is a nice universal player with Blu-Ray support that I?ve used a lot in the past. That being said, there is a superior universal player called ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre 3 also with Blu-Ray support. It can even play Blu-Ray M2TS with DTS audio which is impossible with PowerDVD. 

After discovering ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre 3 I uninstalled PowerDVD. I suggest trying them both.
