I will keep seeding this at the very least until half of you are seeding along with me.  Perhaps longer.

If you are interested, the 64-bit is here:

Just realized I was still seeding this on and off.
As it is no longer a supported edition, I am not going to be seeding anymore.
I will leave the torrent up as I see people are still grabbing and seeding it.  Not sure why though :P
I've moved on to the full retail (and legally purchased) version of Windows 7 Ultimate 64"
