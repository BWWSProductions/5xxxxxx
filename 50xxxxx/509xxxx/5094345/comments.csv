Seriously dude, what's your problem with the Jews?

""Seriously dude,"" why are people like YOU so closeminded? REFUTE WHAT THIS REPORT SAYS!!!  

The reason why informed people have a 'problem' with Jews is because a certain segment of this tribe is THE CAUSE of the problem. THAT IS AN IRREFUTABLE FACT YOU DUMB-ASS, JEW-IGNORANT MORON!"

What is ""so sad"" is closeminded people like YOU who refuse to research the issue and instead choose to deride and ridicule the messenger, preferring to remain IGNORANT of the absolute evil of the international Zionist crime syndicate! "
