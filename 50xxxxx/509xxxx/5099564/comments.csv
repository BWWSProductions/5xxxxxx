,ust2,2009-09-25T09:26Z," Yikes should of watched it earilier, its gonna take most of the night to get with that many leech. I doubt the vioces are off since that is ussually just a codec problem, if all else fails use vlc.

 Either way thx for the timely upload."

,roccauk,2009-09-25T12:33Z,@mike5hocks & others: if the av is out of sync just use vlc and adjust av delay using j+k on your keypad.  vlc...hands down the best media player imo.

,Crustynudger,2009-09-26T00:04Z,"OUT OF SYNC.. Don't download. FQM= Amateurs. No excuse, they just couldn't be bothered checking their finished encoding."
,ursak,2009-09-26T05:34Z,"It's just a glitch between 5:50-7:20 that is out of sync (no mater what player). 

It's not much and nothing spoiled in the video since its only a few lines spoken."
,rc71,2009-09-26T08:10Z,I thought since it was 40 minutes it was short.  It's just this one hour show had 20 minutes of ads.  damn.
