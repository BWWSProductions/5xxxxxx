,Alexstre,2010-02-04T06:15Z,"the installation failed.
the installation encoutered an error that caused the installation to fail.

Same error here. I downloaded the latest version demo from the main NI website then replaced the app by what's in crack/ and it works fine. Not sure what the hell is going on to be honest... but it works... I'm assuming the crack works on any version?"
,cYberGlobe,2010-03-08T15:23Z,"Hey Alexstre!!!
I was trying to do the same but it doesnt work 4 me.
which cracked files did u copy?

Im working on a 10.6.2 osx"
,Shabaam,2010-03-19T15:28Z,"Installation Failure FIX:

turns out it has nothing to do with snow leopard. it was just too simple to think of:

COPY THE INSTALLATION FILE (Traktor Installer Mac.mpkg) to an external harddrive, THEN RUN IT.

spread the word. "
,joolos,2010-05-25T17:14Z,"Hi there!

I've installed this version few weeks ago and it worked fine.
Then I bought a Numark omni controll with the Traktor LE.
I've installed the LE version (I heard the Omni control mapping doesn't work perfectly with the pro version)
Now I feel so... limited with this Limited Edition, so I want to give a try to the Pro version, BUT! every time I try to install it, it will just start the traktor LE.
I think the Traktor PRO install uses my original LE License and configured itself as LE not PRO.
what to do?
Thanx"
,crash7arb,2010-08-30T22:11Z,"For those who have installed Traktor LE, then tried this torrent.. wherein everytime you try to open Traktor Pro, Traktor LE opens; please follow this procedure----------

the uninstall procedure obviously did not remove the relevant registry entries.

Solution:

Open the Native Instruments Service Center
go to the overview tab, search Traktor
expand the view for details
click the EDIT button next to the displayed serial number
remove the serial completely
press SAVE

PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD. "
,HippieJoe,2010-09-06T23:26Z,I just bought the Numark Mixtrack and got Traktor Pro to work but it won't let me use the Mixtrack as a controller. Can anyone help me with  this? 
,damasta55,2010-11-06T18:42Z,"@crash7arb
