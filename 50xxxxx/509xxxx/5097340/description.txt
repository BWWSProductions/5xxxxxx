This is the only method of quitting smoking that has more than a 90% success rate.

Compare that to conventional quitting - where only 3 in 100 manage to quit, or nicotine replacement courses where only 6 in 100 manage to quit.

With this Allen Carr book - instead of quitting being hard, it becomes EASY!

No hypnosis.
No patches or gum.
No stress involved.
You do not even require willpower!

It sounds unbelievable but it really works and for anyone too.

People have read/listened to this book and afterwards not even realized they had stopped smoking without even really trying! As the book explains, using what we call "willpower" and/or "trying" to quit smoking do not work - this book uses a completely different approach.
