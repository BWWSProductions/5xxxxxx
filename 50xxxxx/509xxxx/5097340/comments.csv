Not only do I not smoke anymore since I finished it, many of my friends, including the one I borrowed it from, started reading it and quit smoking.

To all smoker out there, download this book and be open minded when reading / listening to it, it will change your life to and you will never want to smoke again!"

Here's a down sized version of the same download, enhanced with music from the Norwegian translation, that is recommended to be removed after second listening-through of the book."

There is no such thing as ""smaller files with better sound quality"" but its good you uploaded a translation etc. 

I am after the webcasts now... the 6 seminars for US and Canada only... I can find it (on shitty btjunkie) but of course, it has no seeds.

Someone please upload those seminars! Its not the Allen Carr PDF, audio book and its not the 699Mb DVD either, its the webcasts done by a guy that looks like Ross Kemp from Eastenders."
,Dimulya,2011-06-11T05:13Z,"Description for this files is:
Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking [Audio CD]

Quality of Audio: less then middle. I convert it by Lame V7 (120 MB of total size) and it's enough."
,enzy,2011-06-13T21:42Z,"Torrents save lives! Filesharing saves lives! And you uploader have saved years of my life. I have quit smoking for more than a month thanks to your sharing and totally do not intend to start again. Rest in peace Allen Carr, you are a real man. "

oh yeah seeded fine took 2.30 mins to DL"
[T],eXPer1ence,2011-09-09T06:51Z,"I listened to this audio book a thousand times by now and I am still smoking, however others have managed to quit, I have taken in everything the book says and it has changed my view on what smoking even is. It does make you fully aware that smoking is not only pointless, but to escape the nicotine trap, smoking is in fact ""the last thing you need to do"". I think the day is coming soon where I end my love affair with this nasty substance."
,Arlen_Ness,2011-10-19T06:40Z,I can't belive something that is more addictive than HEROIN is not seeded better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
