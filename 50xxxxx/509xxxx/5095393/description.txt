I originally created this compilation to introduce friends, family, and anyone curious to what electronic dance music (EDM) has to offer. It's partly educational in explaining what makes up the various subgenres and categories, using hit songs from each subgenre of Breakbeat, Downtempo, Hardcore, House, Jungle, Techno, and Trance to help new listeners find what style suits them best. There is an overall guide describing the various subgenres and defining some musical terms, and within each subgenre a guide helping listeners to understand beat, lead, and filler structures and why songs fit into a specific category. Since there is so much variation in EDM, you need to know what sounds resonate with you if you're going to find anything enjoyable on your own.

Most of the tracks are 320kbps CBR Fraunhofer MP3 files, though some are lower at around 192kbps. The selection is what I find to best help those unfamiliar with EDM understand that electronic music is far more than repetitive beeps and bloops resembling a car alarm, and contains a mixture of both popular/casual tracks and some deeper/complex songs to truly explore. This torrent serves as a journey through different forms of music, pick and choose what best suits you.

If you disagree with my placement of songs in their respective categories, please recognize this is a limited personal library compilation designed to educate listeners curious about electronic dance music, and as such the 50+ subgenres of EDM have been blended down into seven. I recognize the breakbeat selection is composed of only a few artists, and the techno and jungle folders are rather empty, if you know of any essential artists I've left out (which I undoubtedly have), feel free to leave constructive comments on what is missing. If you've enjoyed or gained something meaningful from this compilation, please leave a comment!

I'll be seeding this torrent for many weeks on my 100Mbit seedbox, so download speeds should be relatively high.
