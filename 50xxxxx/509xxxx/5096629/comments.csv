,RasoolKhan,2009-09-22T16:43Z,"Morons are born everyday!! Must be in the genes, which they probably don't believe in anyway."
,sistromo,2009-09-22T21:33Z,"Excellent recommendation! Hovind (not Hobind) is a preacher who knows nothing about science in general, and evolution by natural selection, in particular. In addition, the guy is nothing but a scammer and a con-man, who is spending well deserved time in a federal penitentiary. 

It's good to see such a beautiful example of the kind of individuals who espouse such ignorant views."
,botanybay1,2009-09-22T21:46Z,one word.......dinosaur. I rest my case!
,lazlow,2009-09-23T02:47Z,"Sure, evolution might be stupid, but that doesn't make it any less of a fact.

Ken Hovind is, after all, a prime example of the stupidity of evolution."
,breaker01,2009-09-23T13:16Z,"Hi.

Any chance of a seeder or two, as my son is studying the pros and cons of Evolutionism as part of his Phylosophy studies and I'd like him to study this.

Thanks."
,jiveclive,2009-09-23T20:31Z,Evolution is stupid because it has not eliminated stupid people from existence. But then stupid people get together to argue against evolution. I say we should volunteer help evolution out. 
,daMouse,2009-10-04T23:44Z,There's no such thing as Evolutionism.
,Generican,2011-03-10T01:15Z,"If evolution was stupid 1 reason would've been enough to prove it.

By the way, someone please seed.  I'd like to see what idiots take in as education."
