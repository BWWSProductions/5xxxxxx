A classic manga about girls at a private all-girls school. The storyline centers 

around the experiences of Nanako, a "normal" girl who is invited to join the 

prestigious school organization, the Sorority, and is resented by all the other 

students because she doesn't appear to be qualified. Other key characters are 

Nanako's two friends: Tomoko, her friend since childhood who is alienated by 

Nanako's decision to try to join the Sorority, and Mariko, a strange, obsessive 

girl 

who is invited to join the Sorority along with Nanako; her "older brother," Henmi, 

who she corresponds with by mail; and the "Three Magnificent Ones," all of whom 

are admired and quasi-worshipped by the rest of the student body: the head of the 

Sorority, Miya-sama, the haunted, pill-popping rebel, Saint-Just, and the star 

athlete with a mysterious disease who doesn't like the Sorority, Kaoru no Kimi
