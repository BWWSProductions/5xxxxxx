I don't have a very fast line, 200kb/s at top, and several other torrents running at once. I have given this 70kb/s, but with 396 peers wanting this, it might take some time. I am seeding it till 400% at least, and seeing as there are 12 peers currently at 75%, I hope it's enough. If not, I'll up the number later. Enjoy these beautiful Danish women in all their facefucking glory. And please seed it after you're done. 120% is usually a good enough number."

,OttifantSir,2009-11-13T11:25Z,"The format of these files are x264/h.264 video codec, and MP3(Lame) audio. These are free implementations of the codecs, and is playable in any mediaplayer that supports these formats, or have codecs installed. I always tell people to use VLC because so far, the only formats I haven't been able to play, are RMVB and DRM-ed WMVs.

More information on x264: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X264

VLC can be found here: www.videolan.org/vlc

I'll be re-seeding this for another 200%, then I hand over the reins to you. Please seed at least 120% after you're done."
,OttifantSir,2010-05-23T00:04Z,"Will be seeding this yet again, because it has dropped off again. I still don't have a faster line, but hope that more people will keep it going once I've seeded it to completion again. And this time I'm quite patient: A ratio of 10, so jump on this if you want it, and keep seeding when you're done."
