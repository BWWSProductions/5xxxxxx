,interruptingcow,2009-09-24T07:20Z,"Smooth_Passion: From what I know, thegreenfrog has always come through before and you will not be disappointed.  It seems that putting these uploads together is a lot of work and these things take time - especially the larger collection style stuff.  

Thank you Greenfrog for your continuing efforts.  You are so kind to share what you have and it is definitely appreciated."

How about:

Many thanks, thegreenfrog, AND I look forward to your future work!  Might I suggest a GOW torrent next?  Much appreciated.

Sounds better to me. :)"
