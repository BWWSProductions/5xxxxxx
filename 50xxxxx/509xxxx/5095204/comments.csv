,brianmay27,2009-09-23T08:12Z,"@rick, ill take a look at it. I haven't played the single player so ill get on that."
,brianmay27,2009-09-23T09:34Z,Seems to be a problem with intel mac's. It seems like only one map has a probelm. see http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=258312 for details
,flipers04,2009-09-23T21:57Z,"Yeah, same problem.
I guess ill just skip the level."
,Ricknederland,2009-09-25T07:47Z,"I can't skip the level :(
How do you do that?"
,brianmay27,2009-09-25T08:24Z,"hit esc, and go into options. Click move / interact i think its called and turn the console on. (the option on the bottom). Then hit the `~ key and type ""map carride"" except without the quotes"
,benh_82,2009-10-13T18:18Z,"Sorry to be a total dick!  but could somebody help me. I have downloaded this torrent but am struggling to get started. When opening the single player icon im asked for the Disk and when opening the multiplayer icon im asked for the keygen, which i cant find. Any advice please."
,benh_82,2009-10-14T18:51Z,All sorted. Thanks for the download.
,Ricknederland,2009-10-23T10:52Z,"Hey i got it fixed, actually a while ago.
I've played the whole game now without problems.
Thanks!!!"
,cory8itall,2009-11-05T16:07Z,"Hey benh_82. I experienced the same confusion. Basically, what you have to do is open the ""Call Of Duty.dmg"" file, drag the ""Call of Duty"" folder to your applications folder, then go back to the original folder and launch the ""CoD Cracker"" app located in the ""CoD Cracker 1.0"" folder. Once you open that, select either SP or MP (whichever you want to play) and then locate the ""Call of Duty SP -or- MP"" file that you've placed in your applications file.
Cheers!"
