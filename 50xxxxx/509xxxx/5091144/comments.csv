,Conall89,2009-10-10T12:57Z,"This is a great torrent and program. Thanks to all of the seeders; it only took about 3 minutes to download. Works great. Before this,  I was using AVS Video Converter 6 to convert .mkv files into .avi so i could stream them though the media center to my xbox360 and it took 25 minutes to convert each 22 minute video. While I do not have a great computer, it is fairly powerful and with this new program, I can convert 2 episode at a time in only 10 minutes. Thanks to the all."
,parayzed,2009-10-11T21:54Z,"How do I get it to work??? I haved copied the crackfile into: Program Files\Xilisoft\Video Converter Ultimate, but it just says: patch failed!
Am I just slow in my head or what?"
,GRTDLS,2009-10-17T14:28Z,"@parayzed,
I am downloading now,
I'll check that."
,hh300jbc,2009-10-25T17:39Z,"If the crack isn't working for you, you'll need to reinstall Video Converter, make sure you uncheck ""Run Video Converter"" before you click Finish, then run the crack (again, make sure you run as administrator).  I had the same problem at first, reinstalled and made sure the crack ran before Video Converter ran, and the crack worked the second time."

2. at the end of installation, make sure to uncheck ""run video converter"" before finishing.

3. copy both the ""file_id.diz"" and ""VID CONV ULTI 5.1.26_Crk"" into programfiles\xilisoft\video converter ultimate.

4. right-click on the ""VID CONV ULTI 5.1.26_Crk"" (in the video converter ultimate folder you just copied into) and click run as administrator (vista).

5. click the skull and close the program when it finishes ""cracking"".

6. run the video converter normally."

Is this suppose to happen or something ? 
If so, help me please : ("
,narutomaaan,2009-12-29T05:19Z,"hey... i have a question. When i installed this first thing happened was AVG 9.0 reacted on the x-video-converter-ultimate.exe heh normally it reacts on cracks but yea, it did and it came several times... when i allowed all the program and installed everything i went to my documents and i saw a Xilisoft Corporation folder there i went into it and saw JScript script file named crack.... is it something supicious or is it just me :p?

,lucas4,2010-01-19T18:40Z,thanks. this works great with windows 7 HP x64. used it to convert those odd files my WDTV wnt play which means the slight loss of quality isn't bad for a file only watched now and then. thanks again :)
,thirteen37,2010-02-09T00:08Z,"+1 thanks for the upload!

works great. running it on windows 7 ultimate.

was using the version where you just put in the key. but xilisoft kept sending me a ""reminder"" that i was running a cracked version.

if your having problems. just read other peoples comments. thanks lostSEOULx for the help."
,Breezzin,2010-02-25T12:38Z,"Installed it with one of the serials you mentioned. Avtivated alright. 
Didn't dl the updates. Got a nagscreen in which I was told I was running a pirated copy. ;)

Still works though! Better not dl ANY updates ;))

Thanks M8!"
,Breezzin,2010-02-25T16:18Z,"Hi, just installed this with a serial as you mentioned. 
Activated ok.

Did'nt install the updates the program suggested.

When I start the program, it now says I have a pirated copy ;) Just a nagscreen in this case, coz'it still works perfectly.

Better not update though!! Chances are it will kill it :)

Thanks M8!"
,TopShoTTa7,2010-04-06T22:18Z,"wow this is still working guys

1. run ""x-video-converter-ultimate"".

2. at the end of installation, make sure to uncheck ""run video converter"" before finishing.

3. copy both the ""file_id.diz"" and ""VID CONV ULTI 5.1.26_Crk"" into programfiles\xilisoft\video converter ultimate.

4. right-click on the ""VID CONV ULTI 5.1.26_Crk"" (in the video converter ultimate folder you just copied into) and click run as administrator (vista).

5. click the skull and close the program when it finishes ""cracking"".

6. run the video converter normally. 

(when i installed on xp after clicking the skull it said patching failed, however the program was still patched and worked perfectly...)"
,Member24601,2010-04-12T04:03Z,"Works Great for me on Win7 Prof. x64. Make sure to run crack as Admin (right click on app). 

Also, avoid updates. Block application from accessing internet
-or- 
simply un-check the box ""Auto Updates-check for updates automatically"" under Preferences->General"
