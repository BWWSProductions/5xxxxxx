Leech was formed in 1995 by Serge Olar (Drums), Marcel Meyer (Guitar, Piano) and Urs Meyer (Guitar, Piano). Right from the start, the band devoted itself to experimental instrumental music - rhythmic figures are developed and connected with floating melodies - this all fuses in an epic sound landscape, where time becomes irrelevant.

Urs Meyer, Guitars & Piano
Marcel Meyer, Guitars & Piano
Serge Olar, Drums
Dave Hofmann, Bass & Guitars
Tobias SchlÃ¤fli, Synthesizers
