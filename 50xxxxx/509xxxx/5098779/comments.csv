Does anyone have external subtitles?"
,loadstone007,2009-09-25T13:26Z,Thank you!
,Jolley_D19,2009-09-25T22:32Z,How exactly do i get to watch this movie?(soz kinda noob at this) But the folder is just full of INF files and one sample :s. HELP!:(
,willdrumz,2009-09-26T03:20Z,Jolley_D19: these are RAR files. Google: RAR extractor. They are free to download. Unrarx for mec is the best but if you use a PC (sucks ) get Winrar. Once it finishes you will have an .mkv video file in the same folder as the rar files. You will need VLC to play it. It's free also. P.S. I fucking hate the word NOOB. It's totally gay. 
,Zeruel,2009-09-28T13:39Z,"I would recommend if you got or get yourself a htpc use Xbmc and then you dont even need to unpack these rar files to watch the movie , what I am doing on my 40 inch Tv.  And with The Nvidia/intel  Ion platform computer you can get a fully working htpc for under 3200 SEK (in sweden) and run  Linux and Xbmc and watch full 1080p movies  without any problems"
,russ45,2009-10-01T02:48Z,I guess you have to compress these but it makes it tedious.  Thanks anyway.
