This is my iTunes friendly version of this torrent: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5089513/The_Beatles_Stereo_Box_Set_%5BFLAC%5D

If you want the FLAC version download that one.

This one has been: 


1. Converted the files from FLAC to Apple Lossless

2. Changed the dates in the "year" column from 2009 to the correct original album release dates. (helpful if you want to sort and listen chronologically)

3. Removed the tag "2009 Stereo Remaster" from the end of the album names and moved it to the "Grouping" Category. (helpful if you have other releases of the same albums in your library that you want to keep and be able to sort easier)

4. Added the Album Cover Art

Enjoy


PS. This is my first torrent and I apologize if the seed is slow. I live in the boonies and have to make do with slow DSL.
