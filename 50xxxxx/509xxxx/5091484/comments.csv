,bisammie,2009-09-20T16:43Z,"Tell me, are any of you just so so sad that you have nothing better to do than type abusive words..do you know anything else or are you just on here all day wanking off and downloading torrents!!!! If you have a legitimate comment to make in order to help us decide whether or  not to download a particular torrent then write a comment worth reading...if you are only on here to be abusive then i suggest you get a life and go and buy your own copy of whatever film!!! People visiting these downloaders genuinely deserve to know about the quality, and what they thought of the film - this can be done without all the bravado and quite frankly cringeworthy embarrassing use of the english language that many of you half witts seem to write. Do stop this rubbish!!!!!"
,TiberiousJonefer,2009-09-20T17:31Z,"I need help trying to watch this, I already installed the latest codec's and I used gspot to see if everything was working but it still wont play. All I get it noise and no video. Much help would be appreciated. Thanks"

,SALVDOR,2009-09-25T02:52Z,"why would you encode, and upload such a horrible fucking copy. Thanks You stupid nigger!"
,torrento_don,2009-09-25T15:16Z,"jesus man, extremezone stop putting all of your torrents in all of your torrents, i appreciate your new creative idea but please take a break. your torrent pages are the longest, they go way deep, almost 2 yards down my monitor."

,GAZZA2008,2009-09-30T20:55Z,i will download it and let you know quality
,Darkslayer1337,2009-09-30T23:33Z,"So many people whining about nothing.
Listen, this guy at least makes time to upload these things, a little bit of appreciation is most likely pleased. As for description, just look it up! There are trailers out there that show more of the movie. Also, just let him do whatever he want with his Details, it's his torrent. Darn whiners."
,cuftica82,2009-10-01T13:52Z,Do i even dare to ask about quality?
,Dakenz,2009-10-02T01:24Z,"lol jak_mehof, with a name like that you really should just stay silent, you cannot even be bothered to jerk your own non-existent weeee wee-wee, yet you have the gall to whine about shit you get for free, you don't like the comments? then don't fuckin read them you mook, you say you agree ""with all the others"" (who make up what, maybe 1% of TPB?) that extremezone  ""spams"" too much, well motherfucker, wtf are you doing? What you think that you have something unique to add? or that by posting your not adding to the ""spam"" Your a joke, a hypocrite, and a useless tool even to yourself. Oh, and AXXO doesn't miss your ass, so find another name to drop."
,GAZZA2008,2009-10-02T01:25Z,"video = 7.5
audio = 8
film average 5."
,Darkslayer1337,2009-10-02T18:58Z,"Video: 7
Audio: 8
Watchable I'd say, but the audio is a little low, guess all u gotta do is turn it up."
,juned123,2009-10-02T20:12Z,hi...u did a wonderful job as u do always...but i  hv a suggetion for u try to compress the size of the movie..in bitween...700-800 mib..
,SlushiePower,2009-10-08T03:23Z,Its watchable. so-so quality. but i thought the movie sucked by itself. sorry.
,SlashDotFrag,2009-10-09T18:31Z,"For all you crying bitches out there wanting him to put a description of the movie in his comment, let me fill you in on something. USE FUCKING GOOGLE YOU HALF WIT BITCH. easy as that. also  he has all the right to advertise HIS torrents on HIS torrent page. so fuck off. 

@ extremezone: I got your back. keep up the good work despite all the other bitches out there. do as you please with all your torrents. I prefer you keep your links up. Its very useful.

@ crying bitches: fuck off, get a life, download some torrents."
,kebabonline5233,2009-10-10T03:55Z,"Looks like slashdotfrag is trying to be a fuckin hero, good luck with that, internet is practically for bitchin bout movies and other stuff, so either way go cut yerself beatch or just ignore all comments?

@ extremezone sweet that you got this one up here. gj!"
,swashbucklingbuckaneer,2009-10-11T00:54Z,every comment above mine is written by some douche. Not mine of course. I'm not a douche. Just everyone else. United we stand...
,altreap,2009-10-11T04:06Z,Jesus christ for once put a movie that isnt a freaking hand cam that you waste time DLing
,Ctrl_Z,2009-10-11T08:26Z,"I got a partial file. It only goes up to 1:06:36. I'll try DLing again, though. Anyone else having this problem?"
,kannanw,2009-10-11T08:56Z,thanks for sharing
,T1mmyD,2009-10-12T03:07Z,"not a bad copy at all, but this is not a very good movie"
,Hails592,2009-10-21T17:21Z,we dont watch to watch movies online!!! you dicks!!! we want to download them and burn them and watch them on the big mutha fookin' flat screen tv!!!!!!

,jayfrommo,2009-11-03T20:48Z,"be careful everyone, i woke up this morning and my internet was cut off. i called my cable company and the said my modem had been deactivated do to the illegal download of this gamer. shit dude they game me the link to get here, the time and date it was downloaded and the time it finished 

lol i did download this, damn good movie, just cover your tracks"
,shinedown45,2009-11-06T09:59Z,"All you who make all these negative comments, if you don't like the quality of the movie, why complain, it was free to watch, all it took was a little time to DL, like most of us have anything better to do in life anyway.

And for those who argue over the internet, It's like running the special Olympics, even if you win you're still retarded :P .

BTW, extremezone has some great torrents and I don't mind if I get a bad one once in awhile, it's not like it costed me anything."
,traumav2point0,2009-11-06T20:45Z,is the movie supposed to be as sketchy as this? looks like it was filmed off a tv with the brightness turned all the way down
,omega45,2010-02-13T11:29Z,"You know, with all the negative feedback, I am amazed that the wankers even come back to you, to download your movies.....you have your regulars, and I am one of the regulars, so, try not to worry too much about the wankers out there bitching and whinging about what they get for free, as, people like me love what you do....thanks again Extremezone....you are amazing....."
,FailedSuicideAttempt-,2010-04-26T12:43Z,This is filmed inside a theater.  It's dark and fuzzy and below a good VHS quality.  At this point in the game this shouldn't have DL'ers given the DVD versions out.  Not watchable and I have low standards but movie house rips is clearly where i make the line.  IDK if this movie suxs or is stupid but seeing it this way it doesn't have a chance.
,Zaherir,2010-05-08T21:15Z,"its hard to compress a 3h move down to round 700-800Mb, cuz its so long. just look at ""2012"" or ""Avatar"" they are both up in 'round 1.3Gb!"
[T],zeromancer,2010-05-23T04:54Z,why is this even seeded now lol. it's shit and theres like 20 other torrents waaaaay better than this piece of *beep*
