The 1986 reboot mini-series The Man of Steel was followed by three four-issue mini-series that also retold and explored the rebooted world of Superman: The World of Krypton, The World of Smallville, and The World of Metropolis, all of them written by John Byrne.


World of Krypton was a four-issue limited series published from December of 1987 until March of 1988.
