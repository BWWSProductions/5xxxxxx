Yes, there may be a delay until your download starts. Yes, I am working on it. Yes, if you want to download it, I suggest clicking the button now, and showing that you have patience, because I'm working my ass off to fix it. Yes, I would appreciate it if you could wait. Yes, I have had this happen to me before. Yes, I do think people who don't at least explain why it's not uploading should be stabbed in the eye with a really hot French fry. Yes, I will say when I've fixed it. No, I'm not going to guarantee when I get it fixed you will have a fast download, but you will get it downloaded because I seed for 1 year straight on everything I down/upload."
[T],Zoey_Redbird,2009-09-23T23:00Z,"Okay, I have it fixed. The only two things I have to say are: 1.) Check out my other torrents. http://thepiratebay.org/user/Zoey_Redbird and 2.) Seed this for me. The more you seed, the more people can enjoy wonderful things. Bring happiness. Seed."
,Soulcast,2009-11-14T03:23Z,good stuff man. Thx!
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2009-12-14T12:31Z,only 2 things i can think of to cause the problem you had with utorrent are either a firewall or the necessary ports aren't opened. if you have the problem in the future then google how to open your ports...
,c0kefan1,2010-05-10T07:05Z,I love it
,xTheBlackBirdx,2010-06-27T10:46Z,"are you a girl?, im just asking because of the bands you uploaded"
[T],Zoey_Redbird,2010-07-04T03:32Z,"xTheBlackBirdx, I'm a girl.

The stuff that I upload isn't because of my gender though. It's because I could not find a torrent such as the one I wanted, so I had to make my own."
,artgirl217,2010-07-20T00:40Z,I am so impressed with your musical tastes in torrents! 8D I love all of these bands and I'm so excited I found this. Please keep up the fabulous work! 
,Kassner,2010-09-22T03:58Z,Would you be able to upload a lossless version of this discography?? (.flac instead of .mp3) Theirs not a single lossless torrent for Cobra Starship on TPB or Demonoid and I'd love to get them. If you'd be willing to but don't know how I'd be more than happy to explain. Either way thank you for this torrent!
[T],Zoey_Redbird,2010-09-24T00:33Z,"Kassner, I understand wanting a lossless version for the quality. I'm sorry, but I don't have enough space on my hard drive for lossess files because of how much space all the details take up. I have to convert everything from 320 kbps to 128 kbps as it is. 

Believe me, if it weren't for the files size problem, I would upload it for you. I know how many audiophiles use TPB, and I would love to upload for them as weel as the people who don't care about quality and just want the music, but I can't. I just can't. "
[T],Zoey_Redbird,2010-09-24T00:36Z,"Kassner, I understand wanting FLAC versions of these songs. I'm a big CS fan, and would love to have higher quality songs. Sadly, there is not enough space on my hard drive to fit all that quality. If it weren't for that, I would give you lossless versions of everything I have on iTunes. "
,Kassner,2010-09-25T19:28Z,"Darn. Oh well, thanks anyways. Only reason I use .flac is 1 I'm OCD, not having an exact copy of the original drives me nuts, and 2 my one noticeable difference from .mp3 is the bass is better. So honestly. I'd rather have this then nothing at all. xP"
[T],Zoey_Redbird,2010-09-26T21:37Z,"Oh, you're welcome. Just be sure and seed it, please? I'm sure there are plenty of other people who you'd be helping by seeding them this. Like you said, better to have this than nothing at all. :P"
,Rogue357,2011-01-10T03:34Z,You're like my favorite person ever. Thank you.
,hawkbot,2011-01-23T00:19Z,"you are a saint. 
thank you!"
,PitMaGGot,2011-10-26T08:26Z,"AMAZING you have this too!!! TY TY Zoey! +1 and don't worry about loseless, i mean if you can convert and UL any1 that DLs it can do the same i know nero can i use it myself. Keep up the good work seeding now"
