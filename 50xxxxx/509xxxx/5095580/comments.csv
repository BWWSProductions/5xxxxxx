,mervyncp,2009-10-01T12:22Z,"Very dissappointed that the files aren't named track name and artist,  101 Files to change.  A right pain in the arse!!!!"
,erkyesosze,2009-12-04T01:11Z,lol. init.
,ReUpLd,2009-12-05T18:26Z,"if anyone's finished tagging the tracks, can they please re-upload so the rest of us don't have to?

,pesmaniac,2009-12-07T12:00Z,Someone plz tag these songs..it's a real pain in the arse...
,CrimsonR,2009-12-18T01:50Z,"this is an actual published release so you can just use a program like mediamonkey to tag it for you.


thank you michelinman"
,JamDep69,2010-01-09T06:34Z,a right pain that none of them have been tagged...no excuses for not knowing how to do this!
,thegermanguy,2010-02-02T19:02Z,bitrate?
,RIggsta,2010-06-19T21:14Z,"No tags are you kidding me? ""free"" or not, thats just bad upping right there...."
,ashenpirate,2010-07-20T03:05Z,"No ID tags and the files aren't even named, lame"
,kelv1969,2011-11-21T22:25Z,"Oh, aren't you all lazy. Can't you be bothered to go through and type the track names? Shame. I only liked 14 out of the hundred anyway. So why don't you do like I did. Go through each song, decide if you like it, if you do, copy it to a 'keeps' folder and name it correctly. Bin the rest. simple. why keep 101 songs on your hard disk or ipod when you'll only like 10% of them. Best not to whine about the efforts of the uploader too. Not very appreciative is it? "
,kelv1969,2011-11-21T22:30Z,"You are all lazy little shits. You'll probably only like 10% of the tracks anyway, like me. I kept the ones I liked, tagged them correctly and binned the rest. Simple. Can't believe you are all whining. You'll spend 12 hours a day scouring the internet for free torrents but you can't spend 5 minutes renaming a few music tracks. LAME. You'd better move your bodies before you all get deep vein thrombosis and die of a blood clot lodging in your lungs. assholes."
