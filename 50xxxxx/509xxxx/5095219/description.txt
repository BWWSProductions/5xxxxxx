A Ticket For Everyone [Live] - Busted [2004]
	


A Ticket for Everyone is a live album by British pop rock band Busted. It contains twelve tracks recorded during the Manchester leg of their Present for Everyone tour, plus the studio version of "Thunderbirds Are Go!", which had been released as a stand-alone single in July 2004.

The album contains live versions of all nine of their British singles, including both tracks from the double A-side "3am/Thunderbirds", and "She Wants to Be Me", which was issued in its original form three weeks after this album. A cover of the 1978 Undertones song "Teenage Kicks" and the Present for Everyone album track "That Thing You Do" round out the album.

Bourne, Simpson and Willis were augmented by Chris Banks, Damon Wilson and Chris Leonard.

Unlike their two studio albums, A Ticket for Everyone was only a minor hit on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 11. Busted officially split up two months after its release.

The album went Platinum in the UK.
