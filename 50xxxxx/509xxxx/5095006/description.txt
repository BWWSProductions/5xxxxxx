After the 25th august 2009 the TPB site is back online but not his trackers.
So you will always notice 0 seeders and 0 leechers when you search this torrent cause these numbers arent updated anymore.

Then I provide here an updated list of open trackers where you can find my torrents:
        
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce	        
http://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce	        
http://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce        
http://tracker.bittorrent.am:80/announce        
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce        
http://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce        
http://tracker.torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce        
http://tracker4.finalgear.com:80/announce

Anyway, if you have a decent torrent client (i.e. uTorrent) there's the serverless DHT network, where my torrents are always available.
__________________________

I reseed some of my torrents, waiting for the Pirate Bay's fate to evolve.
If, as it seems from the last news, it won't be sold to people who would make you pay for P2P, more torrents will follow to recover my old shares. If the next TPB owner will impose fees I will delete them all again.

I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.

What follows is the merge of 4 different torrents, just to minimize, with the few bandwidth I have, the numbers of torrents I have to manage...
Also I see that bigger torrents have longer life and more seeders in the average

MICHAEL HEDGES

Michael Hedges was an American acoustic guitarist.
  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hedges  
http://www.nomadland.com/

There's a fingerstyle guitar BEFORE Michael Hedges and a fingerstyle guitar AFTER Michael Hedges: his approach to the instrument is a Copernican revolution. After him the guitar can be played as a hammer with percussive techniques never seen before.

He wrote nearly exclusively in alternate tunings. Some of the techniques he used include slap harmonics (created by slapping the strings over a harmonic node), use of right hand hammer-ons (particularly on bass notes), use of the left hand for melodic or rhythmic hammer-ons and pull offs, percussive slapping on the guitar body, as well as unusual strummings. He also made extensive use of string dampening as employed in classical guitar, and was known to insist strongly on the precise duration of sounds and silences in his pieces.

Probably it's unuseful to make a torrent about him, but this is my personal tribute to his memory. What follows it's a collection of his albums. Also included is an amateur video where an unknown fellow shows the astonishing techniques that Hedges used in his tunes.
And, if you have time, take a look onwhere you can find videos of his performance: A bliss for the heart and the eyes...

FRANCO MORONE

Franco Morone is a gifted guitar player and composer and highly-regarded guitar teacher. His musical background is diverse, including everything from Deep Purple concerts in his Italian youth, to American blues giants like Blind Blake, to the inspirational guitar work of Leo Kottke. His own music is similarly versatile, covering everything from blues and jazz to Celtic, traditional Italian, Californian New Age, and more. 

He is one of those true musicians who can say whatever he wants to say with his guitar, which makes his live performances even better than his fine recordings. If he's playing anywhere near you, you really owe it to yourself to hear his graceful, passionate, and remarkably enjoyable music live.

TIM SPARKS

Tim Sparks is an american guitarist with a strong classical background.
This is reflected in the complex harmonic structures of his pieces. His music ranges from blues to balcaninc and sefardic echoes with a strong use of weird odd tempos.

If you dont understand from these poor words the richness of his music, listen for instance "Bach'n'Alya" from the album "Guitar Bazaar". Is it too weird for your ears? But this is pure fingerstyle, listen...

Riccardo Zappa is an italian composer and fingerstyle guitarist. 

  
http://www.riccardozappa.it/

His approach to the fingerstyle guitar since 1977 is peculiarly based on sound manipulations and special effects to build rich textures both on 6 and 12 strings guitars.

What follows is a collection of some of his albums... Enjoy...
