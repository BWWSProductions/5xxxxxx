REVIEW:

Wicked Pictures is one of the few adult movie producing companies that can make successful comedies and dramas, with decent acting to support the sex scenes. This is in contrast to the multitude of companies that either make decent gonzo, decent features, or try to imitate someone else's material. Jonathan Morgan, contract director extraordinaire, turns his eye to a little story about an affair. The twist on the movie this time is that the story is told in reverse order-from the breakup to the steamy sex, to the courtship, to the beginnings of the extramarital affair. The story was solid enough to enjoy but the real point of an adult movie is the sex. After all, if you wanted excellent acting, you'd buy the latest choice of the professional critics right? In any case, there were 6 sex scenes here with something for most people to enjoy, even if the movie is clearly directed at couples. Fans of Stormy will note that she was in half of them and her acting skills have improved since earlier releases. Here's a breakdown of the scenes by cast:

Scene One: Stormy, the blonde bombshell contract star, and a lean gal I haven't seen much of, Jassie, had a scene outdoors on a car. I always like watching Stormy, with men, women, or even by herself, but I just didn't get into the action here. Lesbian scenes are similar to all others in the sense that when there's no chemistry, it's not much fun to watch. I was relieved to hear Stormy, in the audio commentary, agree with my assessment. Jassie's pale white skin and girlish body just didn't work for me.

Scene Two: Stormy, in a much better position to have fun this time, took care of Trevor by giving him a wonderful blowjob. Normally, I'm not into this type of scene since it just seems so limited but she did prove to me that it all depends on who's doing it. Warm!

Scene Three: Bridgette, one of the most well known anal queens in the jizz bizz, showed Trevor a full scene here. After starting him off by deepthroating him, she bounced on his lap while he boned her. The scene progressed to anal although the straight sex was more energetic. As I recall, this was her first scene back after she took a break from the business. Definitely one of her better scenes of late.

Scene Four: Stormy, looking really good, had sex with Brad, her then real life boyfriend, in a scene with lots of energy and chemistry. Oral and straight with a condom but it's easy to see the two liked each other with her getting off at least once.

Scene Five: Nicole, one of the most attractive gals in the business that does anal, and her real life boyfriend, Voodoo, had a scene. Those familiar with these two will know that they consistently have the best scenes, filled with chemistry and energy, of any couple in the business. While they didn't do anal here, there's a reason why I never get bored watching them go at it (i.e.: they're great at what they do and when together...whew!).

Scene Six: Bridgette, given yet another chance to shine here, and Scott, had a scene on a couch. Lots of energy and some anal for raincoaters. Stormy suggested this as the best scene of the movie but I still preferred the previous two scenes. I see why she has a following, given her ability combined with looks and attitude.

Summary: I liked this one although I would've liked it more if there had been a scene with Aria. Otherwise, the cast was full of seasoned porn vets having a good time, and there were lots of extras to enjoy. I also think it would've been better if the story had been a bit more conventionally played out but overall it was worth a rating of Recommended or better to fans of Wicked Pictures past efforts.
