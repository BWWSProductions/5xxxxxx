Pete Yorn & Scarlett Johansson - Break Up [2009]

Break Up is a collaborative album between Pete Yorn and Scarlett Johansson. The first single, "Relator" was released as a digital download on 25 May 2009. The full album was released by Atco/Rhino on 15 September 2009. It was recorded in 2006, thus precedes several albums that Yorn and Johansson have released as solo artists.
 
Yorn said that the concept for the album was realised in a dream he had. The project was inspired by Serge Gainsbourg's 1967 and 1968 albums with Brigitte Bardot. Johansson spoke about the project recently; "The idea of two people vocalizing their relationship through duets...I always thought of it as just a small project between friends. It perfectly captured where I was in my life at the time"
 
In a recent interview Yorn stated that he would like to do some live shows with Johansson to promote the album. On September 10th 2009, Scarlett & Pete performed Relator on the French television show 'Le Grand Journal'. This was Scarlett's first live performance on TV.
