[b]Beatles US LPs (remastered 2009). Part 1[/b]

Several of us grew up listening to the Beatles USA versions LPs, this two parts torrent only attempts to rebuild those, with the new remastered 2009 songs...and some surprises

All songs are in mp3 320bps, cd quality (yes cd quality, with the entire audible frequency range that the human ear can hear, why would you want more?)

Joking. Seriously.

Yes, the instrumentals tracks of Hard Day's Night and Help! are here (with the Barber Of Sevilla Beatles style at the ends credits of Help!).
The sound was improved. "1970 Hey Jude" is here, and the "I'm Looking Through You" false start too. Part 1 includes 1980 USA "Rarities" (with some bonus too) as part 2 includes USA Lps "Hollywood Bowl", "The Beatles' Story" and others. (Part 2 depends on how the Part 1 is received)

ahh...includes small front and back cover. See the set list

Enjoy !
