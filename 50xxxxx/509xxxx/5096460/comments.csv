On the first set Pinetop was not playing and I must say that I was not impressed with Mike & his group.
Pinetop came out & started playing on the second set.
There was a transformation. Everyone in the group feed off Pinetop and took it up a notch. It was excellent.
Pinetop had the ability to bring out the best in other musicians.
Oh yeah and during breaks he did like to talk it up with those pretty women.
R.I.P. Pinetop "
