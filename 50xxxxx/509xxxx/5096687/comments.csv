,djaravindth,2009-12-07T20:47Z,Thanks buddy
,Raventhorn,2010-01-08T22:06Z,"@madmonkey56
Yes it will work on a Intel Core2Quad, as the description says its for Intel processors, and afaik theres no limitation to the number of cores the present chip has to install Mac.

@Goatmaster: you NEVER know whether or not a torrent will work until you try it. So stick it up a goat and chill out the next time before you start calling names."
,diego2400,2010-01-16T08:29Z,"I'm gonna download the torrent & see if I can install it with a program call'd ""Empire EFI""...
this is the original version of Snow Leopard ...(that is what the uploader says, so I'll need the program I just mentioned)
there are other ways to install it but using Empire EFI has worked for me...

here is some help...

if this OS X doesn't get install'd 2 u're PC (it is most likely) then download a OS X version call'd ""iDENEB"" or something like that, these OS X are design'd 2 work on mostly any PC (PC & MAC are diferent)

so U could install this torrent using Empire EFI, or downloading the iDeneb version (google for ideneb if U are interested, there are also many other versions of hacked MAC OS X)

I'm not trying to sound like a smart Ass, I'm just tryin' 2 help...

oh and ammm.../

burn the file using a double layer DVD drive with a double layer DVD inside it...
burn it at the slowest speed posible (this incrises the posibility of a succesfull burn)

any problems, just let me know...
I have plenty o' experiance with installing MAC OSX on non-Mac computers..."
,earthresident,2010-01-19T07:03Z,"@ alexvc2003 - yes you can use this to repair an existing installation. upon booting you can go past the first screen and then in the top menu choose disk utility if you need to repair your disk

@ madmonkey56 - yes this will work for intel Core 2 Quad, however you will need to boot into a different environment FIRST, before booting into this retail DVD. boot132, grub DFE or empire EFI will help you boot this retail DVD on PC"
,fuckingpirate,2010-01-26T00:19Z,"@ diego2400:

Hey, buddy ! :D I've successfully installed ideneb 1.3 (Leopard 10.5.5), then upgraded to 10.5.8 with ideneb combo upgrade. I am very close to install retail Leopard on my Intel DG31PR with the latest BIOS update as of the day that I posted this, I got also the Empire EFI ( 1.6 or something ending with 6) disc you suggested (I had both disc and I had done all of this before I saw your post and when I read it I said to myself 'this guy really knows his stuff' :D). I got a question for you: Have you had or do you know of anyone who had installed retail Snow Leo on the Intel DG31PR? If so, can you shed any light to me on this? Just in case I need some additional kexts or general info about this issue.

Thanks In Advance!

Thank you buddy for this torrent!

Would you please provide the MD5 of this upload? My concern is because I downloaded another .dmg that seems to be corrupted, that one shows an md5 mismatch, now I'm trying yours! Again, thank you! "
