Worthless download..."
,thejackofclubs,2009-10-27T00:54Z,i cant figure out how to extract these. i tried winrar and it just wont work. come on murlok! shed some light.
,thejackofclubs,2009-10-27T19:28Z,i managed to find these elsewhere. thanks anyways. (the bay doesnt allow links?)
,swedcelb,2009-10-29T22:10Z,"Whats the problem?!?!
Use Winrar to extract each zip-file, then extract the setup.rar archive - that's it!
Works just fine - thanks Murlok :-)"
,braddecker,2009-11-02T04:11Z,"So, the files are in a .RAR file, which is added to a split RAR file, each of which are added to a ZIP file? And every zip file has a copy of the same .NFO and file_id.diz? I thought people stopped doing that when we got rid of floppy disks. Compressing it once saves on download time, but the two additional compression steps just make everyone frustrated. 

It seems to work fine, though, once you manage to get everything extracted, so I still recommend this download."
,4rror,2009-12-01T11:46Z,"I've re-released this in a more convenient packaging:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5190531/Symantec.Endpoint.Protection.v11.0.5002.333-ZWT_x32-x64"
,static69,2010-01-30T12:13Z,"Does not play well with windows 7 x86, lots of atapi errors that rebooted my server, uninstalled endpoint and everything ran smoothe again. A real bummer cuz any ""PRO"" should know symantec has offered the highest level of protection in the industry for the last 20 years. I'm a fan of ESET as well, but they don't have the history, or the ease of finding a nice *working* version :-)"
