,sl3p,2009-11-14T01:41Z,i hope we don't have a buffer overflow attack
,athe1a,2009-11-15T08:38Z,"I give up... perhaps someone who has installed this and got it to work can help me. I have followed the instructions to the letter (3 times) and even found a post on a blog. Each time, however, I'm never able to get it to start without a secuRom error of sorts. The instructions make it sound so easy but apparently I need it to be ""Install this game for dummies"" Any help would be greatly appreciated. Hate to delete this file and find another considering how long it took."
,Makinavel,2009-12-02T12:22Z,"Hey Capt111. Thanks for the game. I found problems to save the game cause ""windows game live"" doesn't show offline account option. Another: crack is not into dvd 1 but out. Can you give us more details to install properly? Thanks again!"

,marvey099,2012-03-04T00:59Z,"excuse me Uploader, I am grateful for you to have uploaded this torrent, I have a huge Problem here. After I finished Downloaded the torrent, The file inside it is not an ISO(DVD1 and DVD2). But instead, it is a folder. I tried to convert it to ISO and used almost all the applications to try and test it. But it turns out to be USELESS.  Please help me solve this problem, IT TOOK ME 2 MONTHS TO FINISH THIS TORRENT!"
,planetjm6,2012-04-07T05:52Z,my computer destroys the system requirements.. and the game is really laggy...help? 
,planetjm6,2012-04-07T17:41Z,"don't get this torrent, it sucks.. the game play is horrible and lags. it might not be your computer, cuz my computer fucks up the system requirements and it still lags. listen to me now, i'm helping you "
,bobodia,2012-04-10T22:57Z,"To people complaining about lag, that's likely just the game itself

Even if you get a legal copy of the game, it's a common issue for it to lag horribly despite having an excellent pc"
