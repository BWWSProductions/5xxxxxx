Ripped from the EP released by UK rapper and producer Jeystone. I threw in a bonus track called 'Star Wars' by him also. Definitely worth a listen. I find this type of UK Hip-Hop much easier to access.

Tracklist:

01 Out On my Own
02 I Know
03 Smackdown
04 Get Up
05 Red Alert

extra track 'Star Wars'
