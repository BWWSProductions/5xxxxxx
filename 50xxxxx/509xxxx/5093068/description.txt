Superman Confidential was a monthly comic book series from DC Comics. The series debuted November 1st, 2006, and was canceled in April 2008 after 14 issues.

Superman Confidential featured Superman stories set in the early years of the characterâ€™s career. The stories illustrated key moments in the characterâ€™s past such as first meetings, critical decisions, alliances, confrontations, and events that shaped him into the character he is today. The creative team on the series rotated.  The stories in Confidential are the earliest points of reference in the character's newly established continuity, since (according to former monthly Superman writer Kurt Busiek) the character's origin in this new continuity has yet to be established.
