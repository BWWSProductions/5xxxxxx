These are two more films which I've been able to add hard-coded English subtitles for the non-English dialogue.  In "The Da Vinci Code", there is a LOT of dialogue in French and a bit which is in Italian or Latin.  In "Angels & Demons", there is a bit of dialogue in Italian.  All of this now has hard-coded English subtitles as you can see from the screen shots.  Personally, I love both of these films as they are like are like modern-setting "Indiana Jones" films.  The main character, played by Tom Hanks, is like a watered-down "Indiana Jones" for the 21st century.


TRIVIA:
1.  The gargoyle that Sophie stares at in Temple Church in "The Da Vinci Code" is modeled on Ron Howard's face.  If you look closely during the movie, the resemblance is uncanny ... Opie became a gargoyle!!
2.  Dan Brown, the author of both books these movies are based on, is standing next to Tom Hanks during the book-signing scene.  He is in a tweed jacket to the left of Hanks immediately after the line about his name being in the daily planner, in "The Da Vinci Code".
3.  Because it was not guaranteed that the movie would be a success, all references to Langdon's history with the church from the "Angels & Demons" novel were left out of the script for "The Da Vinci Code".  When "The Da Vinci Code" was a box-office success, "Angels & Demons" was green-lit by the studio for production and the script was re-written so that "Angels & Demons" became a sequel rather than a prequel.
4.  In the first film, "The Da Vinci Code", Langdon wonders aloud if Sophie perhaps was indeed the descendant of Christ because she seemed to have cured his claustrophobia by laying her hands on him.  Viewers of "Angels & Demons" can assume that she did indeed perform a miracle as Langdon enters several small enclosed spaces during the second film without any claustrophobia symptoms.
5.  The book case that Langdon knocks over while suffocating in the Vatican Archives has a plaque labeling it as containing books by Leonardo da Vinci, a clear reference to the first film.
6.  For most of the second film, Hanks was fully clothed, but when he learned the introductory scene would have him swimming laps in only a speedo, Hanks underwent serious training to shape up.  Rumor is, director Ron Howard was actually disappointed by his refined form as he viewed Langdon as an academic, not a chiseled "Indiana Jones"-type.
