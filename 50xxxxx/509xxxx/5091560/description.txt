Max Payne (harder cut) 2008

Grabbed and uploaded JUST BECAUSE it was coming on a disc with some kind of protection (FOX DIGITAL COPY), effectively making it watchable only with iTunes or Windows Media Player, and I was not immediately able to watch it on Linux.

Now I am going to seed this until ratio 20.

I hope the quality of the rip is good enough to justify the size. If you are in doubt, believe me, the effects is the only thing worth watching in this film.
