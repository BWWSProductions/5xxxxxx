,Mydoc,2009-09-16T16:47Z,"This game SUCKS! I have no ide wth EA was thinking when they got so fucking money horny... Wtf happend to all the great old Cop chases?! The Spike strips?!? 

The NFS series has gone down the drain... RIP oldschool NFS...."
,riplikethat,2009-09-16T17:16Z,"Ignore Mydoc

He just emailed me asking for help. Apparently he can't find his pills and the retardation is going out of control. I will help him.. after finishing Shift though (sorry man)."
,oxide6884,2009-09-16T19:12Z,"Mydoc... u have no idea what 'oldskool' NFS is... Realism was the begining of NFS... finally it's back into the game after playing kiddie arcade crap for all these years!!

WARNING: Use the following torrent to continue seeding/downloading this ISO > http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5089736/Need.For.Speed.Shift.RELOADED-[tracker.BTARENA.org].iso

I have to agree with scammy. This torrent is already uploaded, the only thing this Anonymous moron did was to unzip the Reloaded ISO into a folder. To continue download/seeding the file from this torrent to another, just move the ISO from old folder to parent. 

The other torrent has more seeders (and the seeders from this one went from 50 to 1 in less than a day).


I find it fucking retarded how same file is always uploaded ten times here and there confusing most downloaders and slowing down other torrents as well (who the fuck assigns these ppl the purple/green skulls?)."
,riplikethat,2009-09-17T19:37Z,Actually that's just more peers and less seeders ration. It's not going to go fast for everyone.

,bogdadav,2011-01-09T18:15Z,"I installed it like I always install my games, and it did not work, says to insert the original disk (the .iso was mounted).
For the ppl that need help, it usually works like this.
1. you download the file, and you have an .iso file.
2. you need a program like magic iso, just google it and download, after that download winrar also google. open magic iso, click tools, click virtual cd/dvd, and it will tell u that you need to download magic disk, click on it and also download it, after that go to magic iso again and click tools- virtual cd/dvd- mount. and find your .iso file and mount it. after that a window should pop out to install it, if not then go to computer right click on the virtual cd/dvd rom that you mounted it to and choose open autoplay. once u start installing it will ask for cd key, thats when u proceed to step 3.
3. find your .iso file in your downloads or wherever you download your junk. right click on it and click open with, and choose winrar. after it opens click on the crack folder, extract the junk in it do like your desktop or something, i usually prefer desktop. then one of the two .exe is a keygen open it click generate copy paste the key in the installer. once its done installing, DO NOT TRY TO PLAY THE GAME!
4. open the install directory, usually 
C:program files/electronic arts/need for speed shift
and copy the crack files into it, it will ask if you want to replace, you click yes. 
And volla! 
But it didnt work for me, i dunno y. all game work like that usually."

,joeri86,2011-06-17T01:38Z,"I need some help with this one.. installed it for the 4th time and get stuck on the same point, four time in a row.

Installed it and cracked it just like i used to (im not a complete noob) I start the game, I can watch the awsome intro movie. Then you have to race for the very first time in the BMW M3, the intro again runs smooth but when the screen changes to cockpit view it begans to lagg like hell and finaly the game ends and i will get a windows error that NFS SHIFT has stopped running.

SPECS: Win Vista 32bit, core2duo 2.0Ghz, 2Gb ram and a Geforce 8300 128kb. I know the minimal video card used to be a 265kb, but i have overclocked my card. I can play COD Black Ops without any lagg... 

Could it be that i have a bad crack or something?"
,joeri86,2011-06-17T02:07Z,I allready got it working.. just applied the offical patches 1.01 and 1.02 and found an .exe at gamecopyworld.com and it is now running as we speak.. or write :-)
,aps15,2011-08-03T23:38Z,"i installed and then i cracked it.
when i launch the game goes black screen and nothing happens.
but when i launch game on desktop, computer thinks and then nothing.pelase help!!!!!!!!"
,Proxiee,2011-10-16T17:02Z,"@joeri: 
overclocking dosn't increase the memory but increase the speed of your graphics card.

so i quess your pc isn't able to handle this game
"
,SerSpec-V,2011-12-26T23:58Z,I tried the crack included and the 1.01 & 1.02 patch but in all cases when I try to play the game I just get a black screen and Win 7 saying the program has stopped and needs to close. I have got other NSF games to work like Undercover but Shift just refuses to work on my PC.
