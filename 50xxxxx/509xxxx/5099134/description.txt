Ripped from the 2 channel LPCM of the DVD included in the Ten Box Set, this is a direct digital conversion with and absolutely lossless. Several minutes of crowd noise has been removed from before the first song and a ten-second fade-out with silence has been added to the last track but no editing, mixing or mastering has beend done otherwise, it's a pure rip. Includes track not shown on mtv.
