this one seems to be real slow"
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-23T22:01Z,can you maybe seed it
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T00:23Z,"5h 7m and counting. my seed ratio is at 3.5. i will not be seeding this after it completes.
 don't know what happened, i haven't had a problem with any of your other torrents"
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T00:26Z,perhap it would go faster if your seed speed was more than 5-10kb/s
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T02:02Z,"dude seriously, seed your shit right or don't bother. 6+ hours for 42 mins of video?"
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T02:25Z,everyone is stuck at 99.3 you really cant just get the last .7% out huh...selective seeding is a waste of the trackers
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T04:21Z,"now were at 99.5% whats the issue sobb,"
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T05:16Z,still not seeding
[T],keka_umans,2009-09-24T07:41Z,bout fucking time kid
,SOBB3029,2009-09-26T19:50Z,"It's because I go back & re-seed all the other episodes 'cause people like you don't keep seeding the older episodes.

I have 3 more JYW episodes to upload yet...plus all of seasons 6, 7, 8, 9 & 10 of Scr-apheap Challenge.

I have an 80k/s upload speed & I'm not a 'kid'. I'm 45.

I'll gladly stop uploading any more episodes if it displeases you so much.

Then all the people who appreciate the series can send you messages for my discontinuance of uploading everything else."
