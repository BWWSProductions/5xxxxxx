_____________[ P  L  O  T ]_____________          
 
An international crime syndicate is plotting to steal a biochemical 
weapon from Korea, and two secret agents have been deployed 
to stop them - sultry super agent Soo Ji (Kim Ha Neul) and bumbling
rookie Jae Joon (Kang Ji Hwan). Soo Ji and Jae Joon are actually
former lovers who split bitterly because of Soo Ji's constant lying
to conceal her work. Now they're bickering away on the same
mission, still unaware of the other's true identity!
