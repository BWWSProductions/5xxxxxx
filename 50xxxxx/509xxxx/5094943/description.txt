Alex Jones hits on the main bullet points about 9-11 quickly and has paranthetical references to the relevant news articles. He talks about drills that simulated the actual 9-11 events before and during 9-11, the phony anthrax attack coming at a critial time - the patriot act renewal, government obstruction of terror investigation, cancelled flights by top Pentagon brass including Ashcroft before 9-11, insider trading, prior knowledge, CIA meeting with Bin Laden, the Bush-Bin Laden business connection, warnings from other nations and the David Schippers interview who talks about people refusing to take vital information on purpose and other things. Since 2002, more information has come out but the content here on 9-11 (one 50 page chapter) already raises enough questions and doubts and points out too many "coincidences."
