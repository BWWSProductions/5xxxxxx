    * Greg Fitzsimmons welcomes Harland Williams (Half Baked) to his
      studio.  This show definitely does not get the respect it deserves.
      Greg is probably the only other show on the Stern channels that gets
      actual celebrity guests.  If you haven't heard Greg then go listen
      to his show from 08-18-09 with guest Dave Navarro.  You'll be hooked.
