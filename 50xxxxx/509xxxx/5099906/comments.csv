,{}KandyBarrr{},2010-03-28T05:05Z,"BTW I'm gonna seed this for a couple of months, I hate to do so because I would really love to support the artist by buying their album, unfortunately I live in a very interior place of INDIA where 99% of people haven't even heard of this band & bloody music shops don't sell western at all. So my seeding shall be used by those who couldn't get it."
