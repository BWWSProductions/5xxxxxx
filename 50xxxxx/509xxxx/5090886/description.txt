"Radio-Frequency Electronics: Circuits and Applications" by Jon B. Hagen
Publisher:Cambridge University Press | ISBN: 052188974X | 2009 | PDF | 452 pages

This second, updated edition of the best-selling Radio-Frequency Electronics introduces the basic concepts and key circuits of radio-frequency systems. It covers the fundamental principles applying to all radio devices, from wireless single-chip data transceivers to high-power broadcast transmitters. This new edition is extensively revised and expanded throughout, including additional chapters on radar, digital modulation, GPS navigation, and S-parameter circuit analysis. 

New worked examples and end-of-chapter problems are included to aid and test understanding of the topics covered, as well as numerous extra figures to provide a visual aid to learning. Key topics covered include filters, amplifiers, oscillators, modulators, low-noise amplifiers, phase lock loops, transformers, waveguides, and antennas. Assuming no prior knowledge of radio electronics, this is a perfect introduction to the subject. 

It is an ideal textbook for junior or senior courses in electrical engineering, as well as an invaluable reference for professional engineers in this area.
