PrintDevizor 2 continues to be the only print-finish visualizer on the market. It lets you view on-screen standard print, special inks, and decorative finishes in a photo-realistic 3D environment. The program simulates true lighting conditions so you can see how your finishes will look in various situations.

Users create print models by choosing a substrate and then applying multiple print effects and finishes, using images from standard creative software as masks. Jobs can be rotated through 360 degrees in any direction into light and shade. The reflections that appear demonstrate how the finish will behave when printed.
