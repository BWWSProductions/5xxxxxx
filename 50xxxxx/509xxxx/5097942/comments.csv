A bit confused cased by the v11 vs v12. Any advice? Best wishes."
[V],Murlok,2009-09-23T23:57Z,Sorry mate could find P-M and it was 11.0 and a polidh 12.0 small business no more in search I will say this is the latest as far as I know :)
,brianxxx,2009-09-24T00:52Z,"I like version 11 better. V12 cuts off some features because it is for the small biz (under 50 PCs) type market.

Thanks Murlok !!!"

Yes, I saw some changes when I installed the Small Biz ver."

,4rror,2009-12-01T11:45Z,"I've re-released this in a more convenient packaging:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5190531/Symantec.Endpoint.Protection.v11.0.5002.333-ZWT_x32-x64"
,niko2008,2010-02-18T22:52Z,"don't waste your time as ""greythorne"" says it's really missing the first file ""...00.zip"" so does not work at all. Same with x64 from ""Murlok"""
,4rror,2010-03-14T02:34Z,"That's nonsense, it's working fine here for me, that's why I rereleased it. That goes for x86 and x64."
