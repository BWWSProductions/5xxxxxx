,tieranosaur,2009-09-25T22:00Z,"Very good, audio and visual, and the show is fantastic.

One comment, though.  At the end of each segment, before it goes to commercial, there's a short clip of a black background with a blue-toned picture on it (a frog, a hand, a leaf, etc).  Those are actually a feature of the show, it's a glyph-code that spells out words... can you leave them in the next files?
