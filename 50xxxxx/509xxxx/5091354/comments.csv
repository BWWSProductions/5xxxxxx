,Leignheart,2009-09-17T08:20Z,"i played the demo and i loved it of course, i wouldnt have kept the same as much as they have but if isnt broke dont fix it i guess, i love it! will buy it as soon as i get paid, until then, im gonna play the shit of it with this. thanks skidrow and groo! p.s will seed for a week atleast"
,larchy,2009-09-17T08:41Z,"Awesome, thanks a lot :)"
,Marious20,2009-09-17T09:25Z,THX a lot for this ;)
,XCMNate,2009-09-17T09:46Z,This whole game is 1.15 Gigs?
,daMouse,2009-09-17T11:56Z,"It's a fairly low-tech game so it doesn't need to be so big. Parts of the game design feels quite old too but give it a try and it could still be fun. The demo was an odd one, more likely to deter than to intrigue the average player..."
,Leignheart,2009-09-17T12:13Z,"okay guys, i downloaded majesty 2 very quickly, like 1mb a sec throughout, but im only seeding like 20kbs, any tips on how to seed faster and ill do it? i dont get it, ive tried everything to seed faster and it wont. im using bittorrent by the way."
,tibrusjer,2009-09-17T13:08Z,"God...
Feel like a child again when I got my dirty little hands on Majesty 1.

Hope Paradox didn't fuck the game mechanic that made the first one unique."
,Necrol,2009-09-17T16:11Z,"U guys got problems with the demo too? could finish demo lvl 2 , thanks for torrent :)"
,kissmevn,2009-09-17T16:14Z,"U chicken, I finished it by using clerics and tower at the beginning. A small tip"
,Necrol,2009-09-17T16:30Z,i said could ot couldn't but when all the lvl in the game are that hard? i hope you'll have a difficulty setting like: easy-normal-hard etc
,Necrol,2009-09-17T17:28Z,i need serial number why dont you have 1??
,Necrol,2009-09-17T17:34Z,I GOT IT you rule man thanks again m8
,Mudget,2009-09-17T20:23Z,"Thanks very much for this.  Quite literally the ONE torrent I could hardly wait for.  I will be buying it as well, but I can't wait to play it.  So I won't."
,Superbus,2009-09-17T23:57Z,"Thank you , your time and effort is appreciated."
,PsiKnife_KFT,2009-09-18T01:18Z,The crack in this is flagged as a keylogger by Kaspersky every time it gets launched. Sophos says its a virus as well.
,daMouse,2009-09-18T03:12Z,"The file is clean according to Kaspersky. (I use it myself)
http://www.kaspersky.com/scanforvirus"
,PsiKnife_KFT,2009-09-18T03:19Z,"daMouse, re-read what I wrote. The scan is fine, it's whenever it's launched it's flagging the SKIDROW crack as a key logger. I'm running a  legit copy of KIS 7 btw."
,dvl180,2009-09-18T03:58Z,"I've been looking for a keygen or crack, but can't find anything in the files for the Product Activation code. Would anyone be able to help me with that?"
,Waterbunns,2009-09-18T06:56Z,yeah its not working for me anyone have any ideas? asks for serial with normal exe and with crack it wont even launch. I even tried to uninstall but it wouldn't let me
,ub7com,2009-09-18T10:22Z,"bless you, waited this one for so long"
,Mudget,2009-09-18T17:16Z,"Good experience with this.  No viruses found, loaded just fine, crack works.  Perfect.  And the best part?  This game is mad addicting."
,Coactum,2009-09-18T17:26Z,Hello.. having some probs.. crack dont work and the game needs a serial key?.. you guys who got is started how did you do?.. 
,Waterbunns,2009-09-18T19:11Z,"It says ""ran out of memory blah blah blah"" when trying to launch. Any suggestions?"
,Necrol,2009-09-18T20:09Z,"@ Coactum download unrar mount it, look at C: you see a image of majesty2 wen u mounted the cd, open that image the u wil see a map called SKIDROW open it copy it and paste it in: Computer - Boot (C:) - Program Files - Paradox Interactive - Majesty 2 - Paste it in the screen you see than when you have done that you will see a screen saying you already have that one continue copying that one, THEN open it and play

Goodluck m8"

,neozarathustra,2009-09-19T08:55Z,Sorry Noob here.  When I unrar these files there is no iso image.  How do I mount it?  Do I have to create an iso image first?  
,Lucky13s,2009-09-19T23:23Z,"This games pretty good.

Basically, your the kind, and you can order what to do, but your people/heroes are controlled by AI.

All you do is you give them quests and rewards for the quest: like an attack quest to attack a certain building/enemy, explore quests, and they'll go explore, Defend quests, and Fear Quests (Heroes fear that area and stay away from it for awhile)

You get to choose where your buildings go, but its up to your citizens to build them, and your heroes will protect them if they're in the area, or you give them a reward to protect them.

All the heroes wander the map on their own, attack on their own, they buy their own equipment (you build the markets/blacksmiths and they'll use the money they find/get from you to buy stuff).

The only downside to this game is, you constantly get bombarded by attacks from enemy lairs around the map. The entire game you're just fending off attacks while you slowly build up your city.

Also sewers/graveyards appear in your towns as they progress and enemies will spawn from them, so you need to build towers near them to kill the stuff that comes out."
,WingsOfDespair,2009-09-19T23:58Z,"I have the same problem as some here..

When i instal the game there is nothing wrong but if i start normally the game up i get the activation key question en when i copy the crack from the skidrow file then it says ran out of memory..
and it's quite anoying me because i downloaded the complete package a few times and it still won't work.

It is the error

Ran out of memory (/device.cpp, 631)
> ''/texture/groups/default/add.bg''

64:              ''/texture/fx/smoke/smokesmal5b_g30''

Does anyone has a clue???"
,Lucky13s,2009-09-20T01:19Z,"Try: update your drivers, C++, direct x user runtime.

Also what I did was I copied the crack over before trying to launch the game, also had the internet off. Maybe you broke the game when you tried to launch it without the crack?"
,fleetkid,2009-09-20T05:56Z,"Works perfectly. Thanks a lot :)

But all the missions to be so similar and you might get bored. 
Otherwise an awesome game."
,WingsOfDespair,2009-09-20T11:04Z,"I tried everything you said lucky13 but nothing worked..

the game keeps saying ran out of memory

do you have other ideas??"
,Cody900,2009-09-21T09:02Z,"This game is epic fun, I love the style, should be other games made like this, an MMO inside an RTS."
,neozarathustra,2009-09-21T09:47Z,"Awesome download and great game works fine for me, except is anyone else having problems with the whole screen going bright white in areas,  and on and off?  My computer sucks for games so I have all of the graphics turned to minimum. "
,TheDazed,2009-09-21T18:03Z,"For people getting the ""Ran out of memory"" error, I found a fix.

Go to the properties for the game shortcut and add -novideo to the end of target. Cheers."
,tavener,2009-09-21T20:25Z,"Great game and sure is fun! 

thanks for upload =D"
,WingsOfDespair,2009-09-21T22:47Z,"how do you mean -novideo??

I tried it and the only thing he does is giving a bios screen for about a half second and then nothing..

Does the crack to be replaced??
And what is the complete name then of the launcher??"
,WingsOfDespair,2009-09-23T15:54Z,"can please say something about the error ran out of memory..

what do you need to do now?

Wich file is it?? en what is the complete name of it now then?"

You still need to get your shit together though."
,blah618,2009-09-30T09:22Z,"Epic & fun. I haven't played an RTS much before, so anyone know any cheats for hacks for this?"
,Narzul,2009-10-03T15:15Z,"Okay... I'm a bit lost here... No problems with dl-ing the game and the crack. Game is running fine afaik. But somehow my PC won't work with me, i get glitches in my screen when i the video (demo) is playing and when i try to play the game, the screen freezes and i can't get out of it.

I downloaded de latest drivers for my Geforce 7900GT and i'm running XP with service pack 3. But it seems that ain't enough... Can someone help me out here??"
,TailsClock,2009-10-04T11:23Z,"I downloaded this very quickly and got it to run right away! How other people are having problems at all I just don't know, unless this is like their first pirated game ever.
Anyway it was great to install and all, but ingame videos had odd stuttering in them. Luckily those are all only at the start. Also unrelated to the torrent itself, but the game is clearly still in beta or something. Ability and item names change depending on where they are, like in an inventory or in the building you research them. Also Lords do not seem to be effected by inventory items if they were wearing them to start with (or so it makes it look). Really there are far too many things to list that are wrong with this. Everything about this game just seems poorly done and it feels like it is from 2005. Still I do manage to enjoy it. Thanks guys!"

,spineless21,2009-12-16T19:06Z,"Game works perfectly, Fast Download (about 10 mins) Thank You!"
,ilovemyanniepie_tom,2009-12-30T09:02Z,"** For anyone having trouble, I - a humble idiot - has got it to work.

Steps 1-3, are easy enough to follow. Here's step 4:

After you extract the files, you'll of course see the image that needs to be mounted. Most of you, if you're like me, mounted it, installed it, and let your own personal god (the computer) do what it does best.

Afterwords, you clicked play, then cursed at your monitor (like myself).  Then came back here and asked what the problem was.

Here's the solution: Remember that thing you mounted? Double left click it. Look for the folder that says ""SKIDROW"". Copy the only thing in that folder, and put it where ever you installed Majesty 2.

Hope that clears things up."
,johnomd,2010-01-19T03:32Z,"This really does seem to have a key logger (see previous posts from others). I got a positive hit when scanned with Eset, but wasn't sure if it was a false positive or not. A week after downloading (only game I ever downloaded to this laptop). My email of 10 yrs was hacked for 1st time. Password was changed, and a ""help send me money"" was sent to my whole address book. Be very careful, and if you do download, do not enter any personal information/passwords on that machine until you are done with game and clean it well."
,sophievrooij,2010-01-23T22:13Z,i've read some comments...and when you mount the file there isn't always a SKIDROW file. I have search the whole folder but none of them was calling skidrow. The next thing i did was to download a crack an yes it worked :D no virus just download the crack for this game. You can find it anywhere on the net :D

,CakeMonster,2010-06-21T18:12Z,"You dont need a serial you idiots were you all born stupid, did your parents drop you many times as a child?

Read the instructions!!!!

Step 4 after installation copy the file from the Skidrow folder inside the mounted FAKE DVD into the majesty folder

You stupid idiots how do you even manage to put on your own pants???????"
,cooky23,2010-07-01T19:01Z,"yeah virus scanners think the skidrow cracks are a viruses but they aren't. ur virus scanner thinks so because it changes things to the game and your regerstiry so the game will start up from ur pc and not ur dvd/cd which u don't have if u have't burned it and use e.g. Deamon Tools. 

Bottom line the crack aint a virus ;)"
,LordGiruvegan,2010-07-19T02:18Z,"In case anyone is still unclear about how to get this game to run, please let me enlighten you on my method.

1. Downloaded the torrent
2. Select all of the .rar files and unpacd them
3. Download Alcohol 120% image mounter/burner (Others work also)
4. Install Alcohol and go under the options sidebar, click ""Virtual Drive"" and select 1 virtual drive and click the ""ok"" at the bottom
5. Down the bottom right clicked the virtual drive and click ""Mount Image""
6. Find the compiled .rar file you unpacked and select that on for mounting and wait for it to finish.
7. Go to My Computer and double-click the Majesty Icon and install it.
8. Go to My Computer, right click the Majesty icon and select ""Open""
9. Open the SKIDROW folder and copy that file.
10. Find where you installed the program, (most like under Drive C and in your programs somewhere, which differs on which OS you have.Found in Paradox Interactive) Once in that folder, paste that file you copied and double-click it. 

Now these are the clearest instructions I think I can give. I personally just open My Computer and double-click the Majesty 2 icon when I wanna play. You can now play Majesty 2 at your leisure without anymore hassles. Have fun! ^_^

Depending on which program you used to mount the file, you can research some videos on Yootube on that if that is an issue. "
,cervantes06,2010-07-25T09:39Z,"Going along as usual with installations this one hit me with something new ...

At the end of installation it says 
 ""The program has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect"" after which my only options are to click okay and then finish

Any attempts to open the game afterwards give me the same message, Twice downloaded  5 times re-installed, Im low on options of what to do here ... Any help please?"
,LordGiruvegan,2010-07-27T05:33Z,"I am not sure if this game runs off of any particular OS. I am running Win7 64-bit. My guide I posted is everything I had to do for this game to work. 

Although, I didn't like it much. I deleted it after the first day. Nothing like the old Majesty. I miss it's low quality charm.

Do a little research on this game and see which OS's it supports. If not, you may need some kind of firewall configuration for this game to properly run, I am not sure."
,jasta85,2010-08-07T16:56Z,"when I try and patch to 1.3 patch it says it cannot find the game or it has been corrupted, do i have to move the game folder somewhere or rename it?"
,TMad666,2010-12-15T04:11Z,"Ok, I downloaded the game and the expansion packs here: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5943126
and 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6018891/Majesty.2.Monster.Kingdom-SKIDROW

Installed this torrent on the first computer. (if your going to install expansions dont place crack or expansions willnt install correctly and you cant play the games). I installed the expansions and the game plays great! No lag, no crashes. This is a Vista 64x comp.

Wanted to play a LAN game so I installed it on my second comp(Win7 32x) the same way with the expansions. It crashes on game startup, I get a memory error, and then my comp freezes up. So I uninstalled all and made sure no files were left in the dir. I just installed the Majesty 2 and placed the crack. Same thing happens without the freeze.I have tried disabling visual themes, desktop composition, and display scaling.

I get this error:
editor [GEM} - Exception
Resource '/texture/fx/flares/_flare01_n.dds' is not a DDS image....

And I do not get the same error every time which I find odd. 

I am going to install it on my older XP computer and see if it will work there(if not I might resort to my XP laptop as well)"
,TMad666,2010-12-15T08:23Z,Both the Laptop and other Desktop (both XP) ran the game fine(as far as crashes go). I found out how to solve my problem on the other computer though. I just simply ran the game in 256 colors and it worked!
