This is great. I really recommend this one. 

The best part besides for the multiple choice of interface and the fact that it's only 7 mb is that you can play LAN or over the internet really easy with just port and IP address.

Again thanks, this is just what I've been looking for."

Help please?! I like this chess game and I'd like to be able to play it online."
