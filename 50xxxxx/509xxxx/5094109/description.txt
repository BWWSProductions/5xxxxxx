An excellent example of a particularly interesting new genre
of young German cinema; bizarre, deadly serious variations
on the reactionary German "Heimat" films of yore -- those
insufferable, sentimental "kitsch" prosodies to Fatherland,
Soil, and Family. This fully realized work effectively upsets
this tradition by recounting a tale of oppressed 19th-century
German peasants who become rebels against the state out
of poverty, revealing (instead of romanticizing) the brutal
degradation of German rural life at the time. Particularly
audacious is the presence of an itinerant Jew peddler as
mastermind (!) of the conspiracy, predictably leading to
(unfounded) charges of anti-semitism against a young director
who has dared to reintroduce the Jew into German dramaturgy.

An early work from the filmmaker behind THE TIN DRUM with an intriguing Hans Christian Anderson-style fairy tale aesthetic and voice over narration. SUDDEN WEALTH is a despairing chronicle of a group of starving peasants who finally seize governmental wealth like a dysfunctional group of Robin Hood's Merry Men, only to be betrayed by their inescapable selves and systematically dehumanized (think bucolic Orwell) and reprogrammed by what we'll put under the rubric of God and Country. Extremely striking compositions at times. Only one man (who bears a passing resemblance to a young John Cleese, incidentally) refuses to go gentle into that good night. The last scene is reminiscent of the endings in both Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY and THE CRUCIBLE with Day-Lewis, yet all even more chilling with its alienating suddenly reappearing voice-over. SUDDEN WEALTH benefits from an especially strong second half with fuller characterization that makes it come alive as a whole for Schlondorff, whose film's evinces extremely striking compositions at times with stationary camera. Especially recommended for those interested in the New German Cinema.
