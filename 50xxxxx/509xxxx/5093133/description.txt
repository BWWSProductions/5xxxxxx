Watching Feargal Sharkey performing on Top Of The Pops was one of my first musical memories and as such its rather fitting for me to post this torrent of his solo output. There's a number of b-sides and 12 inch mixes absent (if anyone has any, please do post), but all the albums and the early vinyl-only singles are present, together with a CD rip of The Assembly's single "Never Never".

Feargal is a fantastic vocalist, his solo output will never be lauded in the same way as his work with The Undertones, but nevertheless he is fondly remembered by fans of 80s music and rightly so.
