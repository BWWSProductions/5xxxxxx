,g8aso,2011-03-13T14:43Z,"It really is a shame to find a rare collection to see it's only been ripped in Joint Stereo, the very worst of the 3 MP3 formats and not actually real stereo at all.
The only way to get true stereo is with Dual Channel/Dual Stereo, this is the only seperate left and right channel format. "

Thank you white_arcades"

,ShortyCM,2012-07-19T00:52Z,g8aso doesn't know what he's talking about with regard to the technical aspects of joint stereo.  Ignore him.
