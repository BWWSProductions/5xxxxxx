,Crustynudger,2009-09-26T05:23Z,I can't even begin to say how bad this movie is. Ripping your own fingernails off is less painful than watching this.

,dlarrym,2009-10-06T21:28Z,"I saw Pandorum last night and a week or so before then I saw ""9"". I saw a decent CAM of Surrogates the other night and despite visual quality due to it being a CAM, taking all that negative part away, I MUCH RATHER see a 10/10 DVDrip copy of ""9"" or PANDORUM well before I want to see a 10/10 DVDrip of Surrogates. NOT to say that surrogates is a bad flick, To me after about the 1st 20mins, the story became very predictable. If ANYONE can get there hands on a quality copy of the fore mentioned, I would love that... I also have not yet seen a decent HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE???? surely by now someone would have a DVD-RIP.  take care all L8R, sincerely, dlarrym (pronounced delerium as in delerious) pardon my bad spelling..."
