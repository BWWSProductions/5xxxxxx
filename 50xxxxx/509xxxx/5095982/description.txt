:::...> About
:
Advent Rising is a third-person, intergalactic action/adventure epic, akin to a fast-paced 
action movie where the player is swept up in an ever-evolving series of sequences and events. 
Built on Epic Games' Unreal Warfare Engine, Advent Rising offers up the legend that a powerful, 
ancient race will one day unite the universe. Millions of cultures from vastly distant worlds 
revere and hallow these mythological beings known as humans. One race, the Seekers, know humans 
actually exist and are threatened by their potential power. Under the guise of benevolent 
explorers, the Seekers travel throughout the galaxy in a desperate attempt to eradicate any 
human society they unearth. Players assume the role of Gideon Wyeth, a remnant of the last 
human outpost, on the brink of discovering the incredible powers that lay dormant within him.
