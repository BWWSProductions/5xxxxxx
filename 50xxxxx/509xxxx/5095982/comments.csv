,DikkatDeliVar,2009-09-28T23:28Z,"When they ripped, they cutted some of the important cutscenes, so the game crushes very often whenever it cannot find the video. With this version you can only do this: Start game, choose play game, load your save, choose level select, select a different save slot. With this I continued the game until the last episode. However I really had it enough, the videos are so much missing that I cannot understand what's going on. So I searched and found the full download, which is 4.3 gb (guess how much videos are missing).
The game is much better than Halo though, very addicting, and incredibly fun. On some missions I spent extra time for tossing enemies into space, or out of windows, into the fireline of big cannons, great game worth downloading the full version."

,johnwoodstock,2012-05-28T17:56Z,"does it work on windows 7? please somebody answer soon, thanks"
,Cerebral222,2012-06-09T07:31Z,"Works well on Windows 7 32bit, the video re-encoding is fairly boxy, but game itself is good. I bought the GOG version (4Gig) but it would never finish downloading, got to 97% and stopped, every time!, at least this one works, and the game is pretty good."
,GENNDA,2012-07-23T09:52Z,"Corre en Windows 7, funciona perfectamente. Tal vez tengan que ejecutarlo como administrador, pero si es compatible."
