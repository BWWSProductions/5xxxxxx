Thanks a lot for your incredible uploads.
I looked up Johnny Hobo and the Freight Trains but, unfortunately, can't find any of his stuff on here. =/
He's an extremely good musician and I was wondering if you could possibly listen to him, and, if you like him, put some of his music on here? [:
Or A Love Like Pi, which is also an incredible band? 

Sorry for the long comment, thank you. [:"

Thanks for all of the fantastic uploads."

,cheeken,2010-08-24T10:11Z,"Great collection! I haven't ran into any problems thus far. You should update it with the new album, that would make the icing on the cake!"
,toptaster,2010-12-09T02:14Z,You need to add The Suburbs.
