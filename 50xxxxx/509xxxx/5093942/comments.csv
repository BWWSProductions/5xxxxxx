,Igores07,2009-09-19T19:59Z,This only works offline and on another profile?
,Igores07,2009-09-20T03:48Z,"I've tried everything to install all fine no problems with the installation. Entering the game, nothing has changed as it was opened and some open. I do if something online profile in the Games for Windows LIVE."

,sjfunk,2009-09-21T08:34Z,Does anyone know how to get a cd key gen? I wanting to play online cause sheva is pissing me off.
,oggemupen6,2009-09-22T17:46Z,its not a fake you must sign ut your profile and sign in with anader profile
,Bungangers,2009-09-28T06:40Z,"This unlocker works! There are people who are just plain stupid that's why they can't make certain torrents to work! haha then they will post comments like ""the torrent is fake"" or what not...try reading comments before posting crap coz if the torrent works for others there could be a REASON why it does not work for YOU!!!!!!!!!! Ayt"
,klearlycanadian,2009-10-02T01:01Z,can the game be played without all the hacks active?
,saridon25,2009-10-02T15:50Z,Working.I can save the game(autosave).
,Anfertri,2009-10-04T06:35Z,"This really works, but there is something I don't like about having everything unlocked. I don't know you guys, but I rather to do that by miself.

Does somebody knows a crack like this one but whit nothing unlocked???"
,LysanderD,2009-10-05T15:31Z,"@Anfertri This works for that as well actually, just use the unlocker, start the game, after logging in as the 'Christine' profile hit the Home key on the keyboard to bring up the Live menu at the top. Hit 'Sign Out'. Another screen comes up saying 'Sign In', 'Create Profile', 'Delete Profile'. Hit 'Create Profile', make a new one there and set it to 'Offline Account', then you're good to go. I've tested it and this starts out with nothing unlocked on the new name, it signs in without asking for a cd key, and saves the game perfectly fine.

A small note though, if you go back later and change the NAME of the account (like say if I changed it from Lysander to LysanderD for some reason), it does the same thing as making a new account (for offline anyways) and it'll start you back at the beginning of the game. The old one will still exist even if it's not in the list though, so if you change the name BACK again (LysanderD back to Lysander), it'll be back to normal and you'll have all of your progress back. Most people won't run into that problem though, just never change the account name ^_^

Thanks for the torrent gerti_id."
,LysanderD,2009-10-05T15:36Z,"You might be able to use that method without the unlocker at all, but I only just figured it out after getting this (apologies for the double post)."
,soze_kaiser2002,2009-10-15T00:31Z,"I confirme this unlocker works well for me with the keyboard but...if i start the game with the joystick, the save game doesn't work!!?

Have you guys notice the same problem??
"
,lordradish,2009-10-27T05:22Z,"Oddly enough, when I go pick any profile (even Christine), it says it must create save data, and then it says it can't. Anyone else have this problem?"
,noellife2000,2009-11-17T11:28Z,this thing works perfectly but makes the game unchallengable
,m4w5,2009-11-29T12:17Z,thxx very much! works perfectly :)

,chung61,2009-12-08T21:10Z,"I cant seem to get this going.I installed it and it showed up where program files are located.
when I started the game, tried to sign in as christine but it wanted email and password. i know im doing something wrong can you please tell me what to do thanks it seems as though this is the only thing out there "
,jlw08,2009-12-08T23:32Z,"seems to work fine except after installing this script now all the sounds are messed up. they all sound like ""BZZZZZZZZTTTEEEEEEEERrrRRRIIIEeeIIIZZZZZZZRRRTTTTAAARrraaRRGFTTTTTSSSSSSSSZZZZZZ"" like static and crazy distorted high pitched sqeeling. 

also the video sequences lag and skip (they didnt before).

im going to try reinstalling the game and then this file, but i have a feeling it will do the same thing.

i dunno whats all included in this ""profile"", but it seems like whatever audio hardware settings that this user had are conflicting with my hardware.... that is of course only if the profile contains specific data like that (does it?).

Anybody know a fix for this? Anyone experience the same prob?"
,jlw08,2009-12-09T01:18Z,"After uninstalling and reinstalling the game (RELOADED's cracked version) and reapplying your patch, I still get the ""distorted"" sounds and choppy video.

The sound is so horendous that its impossible to even play. 

I'm going to see if I can find something like this patch that doesn't mess up my sound."
,chung61,2009-12-10T04:26Z,hey gerti_id did you read my comment can you help me out please I dont what to do I want to try this out thanks
,chung61,2009-12-10T21:49Z,what is the default directory? I believe I did install it in the default directory. c:program files/capcom so after i reinstall the game do i then install this unlocker.  I still dont get it if you can step by step after reinstalling the game and also what is default directory.  thanks.
,chung61,2009-12-10T21:50Z,"I never saved or I couldnt save it before 
I deleted everything."
,chung61,2009-12-10T21:53Z,after hitting install in your unlocker where should the file be installed at and lastly how or where do you sign christine in at that is the part i dont get. thanks again. please repsond.
,chung61,2009-12-11T16:25Z,"when i install the unlocker it doesnt go to document instead it goes to where c:drive is at
when I move it over to document and start the game it still doesnt recognize your unlocker
it keeps on saying that in ordet to save game i need a profile"
,chung61,2009-12-11T17:57Z,"im using vista 32bit I just dont get it i have tried everything but i know im doing something wrong
i tried unstalling and installing the game 
and then install the unlocker. i moved the unlocker file to the directory you mentioned and start the game but the same results im dying to play this game with your unlocker"
,chung61,2009-12-11T17:58Z,do you have a emial or something instead of doing this here if its okay with you
,chung61,2009-12-11T18:00Z,mine is the reloaded crack version 
,jlw08,2009-12-16T00:25Z,Anyone else experience the sound issue i was having?
,oo1pie,2009-12-18T23:39Z,Works perfectly with the TPTB version. Thank you very much!
,Totalanihilation,2009-12-24T05:02Z,"Worked just fine, no sound problems, no bugs, nothing whatsoever.

If you wish to start a fresh game without any of the unlocked stuff, simply sign out of Christine (after logging in once) and go to create new account. Select offline account, and tada! You can now play offline with no problems.

I haven't tried this LAN yet, has anyone? I downloaded this game to play LAN with my buds."
,Floggin,2010-01-14T02:56Z,"THis is the Simplest Freaking Crack for any thing out there.  However it is a bitch because well , why save a progress to help others play who probably never played before with all unlocables unlocked, without the ability to just remove them.  its totla Bullshit I think, this uploader I Hope has a version with out the shit unlocked.  Or they release there password to allow the others to remove the cheats.     


Does anyone know of anothe rlink from this person that doesn't have the Bullshit enabled?"
,ixbartxi,2010-01-20T07:02Z,"@Totalanihilation
Thanks for the instructions!  Worked just like you said. I can now start a new game with nothing unlocked AND be able to save my game."

,blazedandconfused,2010-02-04T01:12Z,"I installed it this file and I think it created a single file called config in a new directory @ C:\Users\Default user\Documents\CAPCOM\RESIDENT EVIL 5, but it wasn`t under a Christine folder. When I start RE5 nothings changed and I still need a Gamer Tag to play. Some help would be appreciated

(I already had RE5 installed at C:\Program Files\CAPCOM\RESIDENT EVIL 5. I`m on Windows 7)"
,blazedandconfused,2010-02-04T01:48Z,"(Sorry for double post) I reinstalled it along with the unlocker but absolutely nothing at all happens.. no new file created, no new folder created, nothing. 

The config file I said was created in Documents wasn't from this program as it turns out."
,xfive452,2010-02-15T18:40Z,"works great..Windows7..those havin problems..try this: in your profile settings disable automatic login..then exit the game without selecting a profile..run the unlocker..open game..check under game profiles..select christine..and then u good to go..

this i will keep as backup for my re5 data..i will first try and unlock all things on my own profile first..more fun..

thanx gerti_id"

and after all that(the extractor will say that you can play the game now) Click on the Reg.exe that's on the Resident Evil game folder and that's it try making an OFFLINE GFW account and the game will be saved now......  "
