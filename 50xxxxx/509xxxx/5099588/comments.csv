Unfortunately, the Seed/Leech ratio of this torrent is completely fucked...I've been stuck at around 75% complete for the past couple days now.....If there's any way King you could seed for me till I get the rest of it, I promise to do my part and seed this great torrent as well so more people can have it and share it. Thanks."
,arnold_8100,2009-10-25T16:42Z,two thumbs up but can u upload some more? my dl rate isnt that great right now 
,aldowatts,2009-12-31T14:37Z,"there are ZERO episodes of weeds in this torrent. season 5 is jus pieces of other video files
do NOT waste your time or bandwidth on this POS. from now on all this users torrents are SUSPECT"
,DL_King,2009-12-31T18:23Z,"@aldowatts
I assure you that all the files are there and work. If your having problems then you either are not playing them in a player with a decent set of codecs (VLC player for example) or your an ignorant douchbag that just likes causing shit. Either way would any of the 60+ people to have finished this torrent please comment on the quality so this one comment doesn't ruin the whole torrent. 

Enjoy and Please Seed!!!

and if you can't play the files make sure you 1. download the entire file 2. Have codecs to play torrent 3. Aren't a mouth-breathing inbred that couldn't operate a VCR


Anyway Happy New Year to the Rest of TPB!!!"

,kissofd3th,2010-09-14T23:31Z,"Audio and Video are 9/10. I can only speak for season 5 though. As far as I can tell, seasons 1-4 were taken from another torrent. It looks like the same one I used, so I would say they are also a 9/10.

@aldowatts You are a twat. There is obviously episodes in this, you can check before you even start downloading. I can verify that season 5 is there and works great. You are just a little trouble making cock sucker. Oh, and C'mon. Who calls somebody a ""boner""? That is fucking LAME."
,lovetheherb,2010-09-19T02:04Z,"Nice1 dude for this :D
will seed as long as possible "
,yumaslim,2010-10-02T02:32Z,"I have seen the first season and most of the second season and the quality is great.  However, the audio seems to be normal one episode and then very quiet the next and then back to normal.  This is hard for me because I like to marathon and when it switches back to normal I'm worried about blowing a speaker or being deaf for short while.  
Does anybody know of a way to mitigate this?  Or is this just a problem for me?"
,williamsteam,2010-11-12T19:02Z,Both of the trackers are down I am not getting anything
,williamsteam,2010-11-12T19:43Z,I figured out why i couldn't get it to start without the trackers It's close to 200 KBS Thanks for the upload much appreciated

,halfs3,2011-07-11T19:13Z,"While the quality is mostly ok, the subs dont match on a single episode I've watched. Most go almost twice as fast as they should. "
