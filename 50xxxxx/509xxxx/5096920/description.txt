TI has started to send DMCA notices to any website with the TI calculator keys that allow users to make their own 3rd party OS for the calculators. The excuse is that it is an illegal use of the calculators and that it "violates" their copyright. This ain't gonna happen on my watch, so for anyone who wants 'em here they are.

These keys allow anyone to write an operating system that can overwrite the built in TI OS that is sent by default. Be careful because I am not liable for bricked calculators if you fail.
