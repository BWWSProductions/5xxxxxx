,max2562,2009-09-26T23:11Z,"@cactusdas, pdilla and to everyone else who whines and complains about seeders...

you retards dont seem to understand. there is little control any can have when seeding. if someone is seeding files they cannot seed them all at the same time or this would slow each connection to something like .1kB/s which doesn't help anyone. and when you log on and open a torrent and start downloading you stand in line like the rest of us. no one has control over who they let leech and who they dont. its all a matter of what was already being downloaded when YOU decided you wanted the file. if 1000 seeders are not seeding that particular file when you wanted it you will probably have to wait your turn. 
stop acting liek you know everything and its always someones fault and not your own. grow up shut up and think before you open your ignorant mouths. 
other than that, thanks for the upload. contributors are always welcome. "

,redfish,2009-09-28T03:31Z,"Terrible fucking movie. Plot is about as thick as a piece of rice paper, the acting is laughably bad (yes I really LOL'ed at the bad acting). 

It can give you a good ""jump"" if you are just looking for that. It has some pretty well timed suprises.

It also is disgusting, not in the Hell Raiser, House of 1000 Corpses, Hannibal disgusting.. disgusting in the sense of having to change an old ladies diaper or having a drunk person puke on you."

Thank you so much for that.

,redfish,2009-09-29T17:11Z,"@everyone who thinks this is a good movie

Ok, umm.. the anvil falling on the ladies head and the eye balls shooting in the girls mouth. The special effects look like Wolverine released when they still had the half finished effects in.

The old lady puking in the girls mouth A LOT, it was bug, then some sort of green goop..  I'm sorry, that's not.. scary, thats just fucking disgusting. if I want to see something like that I'll go watch 2 girls 1 cup. 

I mean fuck, bike a chunk out of the girls face, open her brain up, eat her fucking brain. That is kind of scary.. puke? FFS... 

this is a dick and fart joke movie. 

The original Clerks movie has more beliveable acting and it was meant to be a little corn ball. I can see how some people are drawing a line to ""The Evil Dead"", but ""The Evil Dead"" was meant to be a little campy.. Jesus fucking christ. 

This is just shity, its not campy, it's not funny. The camera work is very good and so is the stage blocking.
