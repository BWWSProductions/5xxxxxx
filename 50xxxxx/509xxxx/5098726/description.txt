Weather Report for today is Zawinuling, Shortering, Johnsoning and Wilburing. Hot, steamy fusion from '74 will make you sweat today, so be sure to have a cold drink on hand while listening!


Weather Report's fourth recording finds Wayne Shorter (on soprano and tenor) taking 
a lesser role as Joe Zawinul begins to really dominate the group's sound. Most selections also include bassist Alphonso Johnson and drummer Ishmael Wilburn although the personnel shifts from track to track. "Nubian Sundance" adds several vocalists while "Blackthorn Rose" is a Shorter-Zawinul duet. Overall the music is pretty stimulating and sometimes adventurous; high-quality fusion from 1974.

The "rules" are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include cue- and logfiles for the purists and the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)
