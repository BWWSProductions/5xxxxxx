,Skatepunkisch,2009-09-16T23:51Z,"sooners! This seems to be the real deal:) I have compared this one to Ace Frehley - Anomaly (2009) [mp3@256] and that's a crappy rip, enjoy:D"
,xforcer,2009-09-18T00:46Z,Exact same web download from WWW.SPARKSDEN.ORG.  Originally 96 converted to 256.  Even says the website in comments tags.  I deleted mine.  Wish somebody would up the cd rip.
,xforcer,2009-09-18T00:49Z,"Actually must be VBR because some at 256 some 229 and a few at 320, but still downloaded at afore mentioned site"
