The 80s are renowned for one hit wonders and Scotland's Owen Paul with his single "My Favourite Waste Of Time" is often cited as a classic example. The debut album from which it came was a total flop, effectively putting an end to Owen Paul's music career before it had begun. Still, i decided to snap it up on a whim and it turns out be half decent, in a straightforward pop kind of way.

I believe the album was released on CD in very small quantities so this is only the vinyl i'm afraid. On the plus side, it contains two exclusive bonus tracks which weren't on the CD, a remix of "My Favourite Waste Of Time", plus a very ear pleasing instumental track to play the album out.

A worthwhile 80s curiosity if nothing else.
