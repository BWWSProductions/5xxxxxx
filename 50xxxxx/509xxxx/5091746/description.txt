THE SUNBURYS - HERE COMES THE SUNBURYS, album released July 03rd, 2009.
Encoded 320kbps [Lame] mp3. Front cover only included.

The Sunburys are a three-piece Australian rock band. The band members are
Scott Lapthorn (Drums), Andrew O'Sullivan (Bass) and Anthony Dettori
(Guitar/Vocals).

Here Comes The Sunburys is the debut album by The Sunburys. Much of the album
was recorded live in producer Jeff LovejoyÃ†s garage. It cuts to the chase,
it exudes no-bullshit musicianship, considered but unpretentious songwriting
and spirited, sweaty performances. The album evokes oldschool soul rock
influences - from 40 years of British rock, American legends (Bob Dylan,
Tom Petty, Neil Young, Wilco) to great Australian songwriters like Tim
Rogers, Paul Kelly, and Stevie Wright.
