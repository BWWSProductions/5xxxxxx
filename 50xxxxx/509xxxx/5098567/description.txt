Lang.:	      English
Discs:         1
Image:         MDS/MDF 
Rated:         E (Everyone)
gener:         RPG/Simulation
Requirements:  Modded/Chipped Ps2, or Swap Magic Disc Method.


Compressed with WinRar, Game was tested and works. 
Try 7Zip its free google it, if you don't have WinRar.


The reason why the size is so small is because the original game is this small and its just the way this ps2 game was made.


This is a CD-R or Compact Disc Type PS2 game, so you'll have to use CD-R media 
only to burn with. (Verbatim recommended)


Note: No Ps2 Backup disc/game or Copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is modded
      or if you use Swap Magic.

     
You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% & the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.

If your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first
remove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.

Also swap magic should have a cd loader to boot cd type ps2 games.

Here's a link for how to remove the front cover...

Those that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot & how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.

You will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).

After patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media
then use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.

You will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Verbatim or Tayio yuden is preferred.

Note: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Try Swap Magic to load the game.


Game Description:

The first Harvest Moon game for the PS2 takes a little deviance from all the other games in the series. The goal this time around is to save your town from being turned into a resort next year. The game focuses more on relationships than making money - which is the goal in all other Harvest Moon games to date. You still are running a farm and must succeed in the life of a farmer, but the actual gameplay rewards those who interact with the townspeople over those who just work the fields.

Use Verbatim or Tayio Yuden CD-R Media, or if other media isn't working.

(No CD-RW Media will not work only CD-R will).
