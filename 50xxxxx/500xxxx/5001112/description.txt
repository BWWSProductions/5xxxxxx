2009 July Grand Sumo Tournament (Nagoya Basho) Day 01 [English Audio]





I'm still working out the direct download stuff (trying to find a way to upload to multiple hosts at once). Till then here is Day 1. I know I said I won't upload the torrent here but the download links won't get worked out for at least a day and I know people need their fix of sumo.


Upload will be SLOOOOOOW so don't complain if it takes a few hours to download.


I've created a blog where people can donate to help cover the cost of ordering the tournament, links for direct downloads and status updates on future releases:
