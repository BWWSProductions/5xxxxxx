Topics in Mathematical Analysis
World Scientific Publishing Company | 2008-06-16 | ISBN: 9812811052 | 500 pages | PDF

This volume consists of a series of lecture notes on mathematical analysis. The contributors have been selected on the basis of both their outstanding scientific level and their clarity of exposition. Thus, the present collection is particularly suited to young researchers and graduate students. Through this volume, the editors intend to provide the reader with material otherwise difficult to find and written in a manner which is also accessible to nonexperts.
