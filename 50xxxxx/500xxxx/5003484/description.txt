Logic Pro is a digital audio workstation and MIDI sequencer software application for the Mac OS X platform. Originally created by German software developer Emagic, Logic Pro became an Apple product when Apple bought Emagic in 2002. Logic Pro is part of Apple's Logic Studio bundle of professional music applications.
A consumer-level version based on the same interface and audio engine but with reduced features, called Logic Express, is also available at a reduced cost. Apple's GarageBand, another application using Logicâ€™s audio engine, is bundled in iLife, a suite of software which comes included on any new Macintosh computer. Similar DAWs include Garageband, FL Studio, and Indaba Music.
