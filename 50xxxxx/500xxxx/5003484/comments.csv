,Donelson,2009-07-25T09:09Z,"suewolf is wrong.  Superfast, ultra seeded.  Thanks, dubwise2step!"
,likebutta,2009-07-25T14:54Z,what can be the previous serial #?
,likebutta,2009-07-25T15:02Z,Nevermind. I found a way! I love it! Quick download that can take overnight! Great job! Thanks!
,djducky,2009-07-28T03:13Z,"likebutta, how'd you get past the previous serial #?"
,MrBims,2009-07-28T17:42Z,"This Torrent has a virus and all you need is .zip file which is 210MB and serial, other things are useless."
,AncientYC,2010-09-13T05:00Z,"I downloaded this torrent and it seems to be working with this serial:

E-348-DJZ-169-MYT-350-WHT-435-RLY-FB5-WXCX

But for some reason, I only have the garageband instruments. This is a new computer and this is the second time this happened with this torrent. How do I get the logic instruments?"
,ma1u,2012-01-07T18:35Z,Download fails at the end. Possibly just me.
,stinkiestan,2012-01-18T14:46Z,"the serial is blocked, anyone could find another one?"
