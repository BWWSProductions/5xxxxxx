A live performance by Toby Keith - God Love Her from the 2009 CMT Music Awards Show. 


"God Love Her" is the title of a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Toby Keith, found on his 2008 album, That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy, from which it was released as the second single and on the chart week of March 7, 2009, the song became Keith's eighteenth Number One song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Keith co-wrote the song with Vicky McGehee.

"God Love Her" is a moderate up-tempo accompanied by electric guitar. It describes the narrator's love for a preacher's daughter, who despite her own rebellious nature ("she was baptized in dirty water") saves the narrator's "soul from the devil".

Jim Malec, a reviewer of The 9513, gave the song a "thumbs up" rating. He described the song as "pretty damn solid", and said that despite its clichÃ©d theme, it was well executed and Keith's vocals showed a "sense of urgency."

That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy is the thirteenth studio release from American country music artist Toby Keith. The album was released October 28, 2008 on Show Dog Nashville, Keith's own label, and was produced by Keith himself. He wrote or co-wrote all the songs on this album, collaborating with Bobby Pinson on all but three. Lead-off single "She Never Cried in Front of Me" became a number one hit for Keith on the Billboard country charts in late October 2008, as did "God Love Her", the second single, in March 2009. A third single, "Lost You Anyway", was released on March 16, 2009. The album was certified Gold in December 2008.
