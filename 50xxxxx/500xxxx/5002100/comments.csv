,sharebird,2009-08-19T01:03Z,"There is a discussion here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5052418/Total_Commander_7.50_RC1_Portable

that the Thinstall app used to generate these portable apps is infected... The apps themselves are scanning clean, but when they run they unpack a svchost.exe, usually as part of a file open dialog.  

We appreciate NoExcuses' efforts and don't want to undermine them, but right now all of his portable apps are suspect.

Sorry mate, but you might want do do what fredpc did, download a different copy of thinstall.

Just wanted to spread the word, because this particular virus hides itself very well."
