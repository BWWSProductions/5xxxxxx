The Ultimate Collection - Neil Diamond [1996]	



There's only so much you can say about a greatest hits collection, but what can be said about this is entirely positive. 40 of his best from the '60s through the '90s, It's a comprehensive collection which includes every favourite and also those songs made famous by others - many will be surprised to learn that "Red Red Wine" and "I'm a Believer" are originally Diamond numbers. Both appear here. Conversely, a handful of standards get the unique Diamond vocal treatment - "He ain't heavy, he's my brother", "Mr Bojangles" and even "Morning has Broken". But let's not distract from the main purpose - track after track of some of the strongestmoreâ€¦ songs of the late sixties and seventies which would grace anybody's music collection.
