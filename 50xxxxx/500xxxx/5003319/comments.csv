FYI:  the correct song title for disc 2, track 20 is Holly, Holy (first word is a woman's name).  I thought you just typed it wrong, but then I saw it's printed wrong on the back cover image.  It is correct on the CD image.

So there's your insignificant fact for the day.  Thanks again for the upload!"
[V],only1joe,2009-09-22T21:23Z,"lydonit13 - I didnt notice that, when the cd is inserted and if your connected to the internet the CDDatabase automatically looks up the CD Track names, and then i just copy and paste to the word doc. 
But like you say its not important as long as the track plays good.

All the best
