Deep, dark and dirty...


Drums > 100s of sub-heavy big room belters: pounding and pulsating rhythms to rock any floor.  

Bass > Slick and deep, warm and fuzzy low-end grooves â€“ all dripping with authentic analogue fat.  


Synths > From the euphoric to the sublime: oozing wet crowd-pleasers and esoteric ear-teasers.  


Music loops > Stripped synth, nu-noise and percussive grooves â€“soundbeds packed with inspiration.  


Combis > Meticulously programmed trackstarters, mixed and primed for dancefloor destruction.

More > Tweeter freakinâ€™ tops, swooping breakdown FX, sizzling single drum hits and much more
