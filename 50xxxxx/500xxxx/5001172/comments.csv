Hey loser...u r coming to piratebay to say wrongs of copying..how retarded is that..
Stop judging people.These eternal truths were realised and transmitted by Rishis not for keeping in safe deposit box and milking royalty.As for attribution,Tolle very clearly says that..he further understood his experience by learning from Buddhism,Zen,Hinduism etc
But,he realized his Self without all these Eastern spiritual tools&mechanisms,so he dont have to attribute.Btw,he communicates to his audience (especially western ones and other cultures of abrahamic religions with retarded dogmatic God concepts) with minimum of complicated mumbo-jumbo terminology unlike Hinduism etc which difficult for a westerner to understand..Peace.."
