Depending on my mood, it's my personal favorite of theirs. If your only acquaintance with the Maniacs is with their late 80s/early 90s material (e.g., the also-incredible-but-quite-different ""Our Time in Eden""), this'll be an eye-opener. 

My favorite songs on Wishing Chair have an up-tempo, propulsive, jangly, sparkling, sprightly, angular sound (the album even has a kind-of-rocker, ""Scorpio Rising,"" that works surprisingly well). And none of the tracks exhibit the didactic politics that, for me anyway, spoils some of Natalie's later work (I like my left-wing politics, mind you, but between the lines where possible). 

If ""Our Time in Eden"" is the Maniac's ""Automatic for the People,"" this one is much closer to REM's ""Murmur"" or ""Reckoning;"" though not as cohesive, polished, or consistently good (I've got a big bias here, as the latter two records rank among my top desert island discs). 

Many thanks to Kitlope.

Meh. Still good stuff. "
