,kenmo346,2009-08-07T01:29Z,"Whats with the Wallpapers folder with unopenable .jpg's ? Although no viruses were detected, I don't trust this because of that folder & its contents..."
[V],Slickinator,2009-09-12T07:26Z,its fine 
,shammon,2009-11-18T15:01Z,Is this compatable with Vista?
,phoebus23,2010-02-09T19:55Z,"For those wondering which version of WinPE this is -- it isn't.  This is actually a BartPE 3.1.3 disk.  It's still useful and all, and has a nice, varied collection of utilities and programs on it, mind you.  It's just not an 'official' WinPE build .. (but it would most closely match WinPE 1.0).

shammon@ - This disk most closely matches WinPE 1.0, which is built from Windows XP with no service pack, so .. no.  For Vista, you'd want WinPE 2.0  ... and this one is equivalent to 1.0."
[V],Slickinator,2010-04-22T22:46Z,ok but it still works
,vnckien,2011-11-01T15:21Z,"Could you make WinPE v3.1 (Windows 7 - Windows Automatic Installation Kit) with Acronis Disk Director 11 Suite and Acronis True Image Home 2011 or 2012 insite?

Thanks a lot!"
