This is a stripped-down version of the U2 Live at Red Rocks Deluxe DVD, small enough to burn on a single-layer 4.7 GB DVD-R.

Menus and commentary and subtitle tracks have all been removed.
Video was NOT re-compressed.
All surround sound audio was thrown out, and the PCM stereo audio track was re-compressed to AC3 at 192 kbps, then re-muxed with the original mpeg-2 video.

I would have preferred to use a higher-bit rate for the audio, especially since this is a music DVD, but then it wouldn't have fit on a 4.7 GB DVD unless I recompressed the video, which would have taken a very long time and compromised the video quality.

So, whatever, if this compromise suits your needs, then enjoy, and if not, don't complain or second-guess my decisions.
