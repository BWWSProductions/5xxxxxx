[b][i][color=red]Summary[/color][/i][/b]

As night falls, he begins to recall the circumstances that led to the killing.  He remembers that he was in love with a girl called FranÃ§oise, and that everything was going fine until an unscrupulous dog trainer, Valentin, appeared on the scene...[/color][/i]

[b][i][color=red]Review[/color][/i][/b]

[i][color=blue]Le Jour se lÃ¨ve is another doom-laden tale which sprang from the combined genius of director Marcel CarnÃ© and screenwriter Jacques PrÃ©vert.  By the time this film was made, there was an all-pervading aura of pessimism hanging over Europe, with the imminence of a World War, and this is noticeable in French cinema of this period.  Le Jour se lÃ¨ve captures this sense of gloom with a particular acuity and it is impossible to watch this film without experiencing something of the angst of the time in which it was made.

As in CarnÃ©â€™s earlier film Le Quai des brumes, Jean Gabin shows himself to be perfect material for the CarnÃ©-PrÃ©vert brand of poetic realism, a style very noticeable in late 1930s French cinema.  Not only is Gabin capable of playing ordinary working class men with total conviction but he has the aura and looks of a tragic actor.  Although Gabin was possibly asked to play the part of the doomed hero too often in his career, in this film his characterâ€™s demise is one of the most moving. This is mainly due to the actorâ€™s remarkable ability of finding an empathy with his audience, but also because he appears perfectly in tune with PrÃ©vertâ€™s melancholic view of life.

This film also treats us to a deliciously mischievous performance from Jules Berry, by now dangerously type-cast as the villainous womaniser, and Arletty in an uncharacteristically tender and restrained performance.

The filmâ€™s strength lies only partly in its acting performances.  What is equally important, and what gives it the status of an undoubted masterpiece, is the filmâ€™s construction.    Today, the use of the flashback idea is pretty banal, but in 1939 it was practically an innovation.  The filmâ€™s narrative is built entirely around the notion of flashback, and the approach works perfectly.  The film could not have worked if had been told in a conventional linear narrative.

The filmâ€™s unusual construction is served by its sombre dusky photography.  Almost every shot seems to be loaded with significance and poignancy, particularly the night time scenes at the start of the film when FranÃ§ois, cornered in his room, reflects on his predicament.    Visually, there is no doubt that this is a work of poetic genius, heart-rending in its wistfulness, tragic in its stifling sense of melancholia. [/color][/i]
