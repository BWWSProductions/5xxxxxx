Deity follows the adventures of Jamie, a teenage girl who lives in the L.A. of tomorrow.  When Jamie turns 16 she learns a shocking secret: she's actually the Deity, a goddess of immense power.  Aided by a hot-blooded Gunslinger, a young Shaolin Monk and a Dragon Prince, she tries to cope with her destiny and maintain some semblance of a normal life in the face of constant danger from the Ma'Shiva: savage aliens bent on her destruction.

Also included is Saint Angel, which features a number of Deity back-up stories.

In a distant galaxy, on an alien world, floating island nations fight endlessly in bloody conflicts.  On one such island state, a truce is declared between the humans and a flying bird-like race. A member of each race is forced into an uneasy alliance and sent to the super-island of Neamis to investigate a new threat.  
During their travels, the unlikely duo encounter the legendary Saint Angel; a mythic warrior who is waging a private war against ominous invaders.  Together, these warriors bury ancient blood feuds to save their world from certain destruction.
