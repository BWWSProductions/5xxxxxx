Tekkon Kinkreet director Michael Arias knocks on Heaven's Door with his first live-action feature. A remake of the 1997 German film Knockin' on Heaven's Door about two terminally ill men who go on a road trip together to the sea, Heaven's Door changes the premise slightly to follow a man and a young girl on the last and greatest adventure of their lives. TOKIO's Nagase Tomoya (Yaji & Kita: The Midnight Pilgrims) and child actress Fukuda Mayuko (L change the WorLd, 10 Promises to My Dog) make a charming pair of unlikely friends and trouble-mongering travelers, turning an inevitably tragic tale into one of heart, laughter, and revelation. Heaven's Door also co-stars Miura Tomokazu and Nagatsuka Keishi, and features cameos by Tsuchiya Anna, Yumi of Puffy AmiYumi, and other stars.
