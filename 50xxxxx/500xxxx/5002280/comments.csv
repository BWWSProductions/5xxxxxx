,pappoo_samma,2009-07-15T10:23Z,"1. I respect all the men doing this.

2. I am not duplicating anyone?s work; anyone who is not completely brain-dead can easily notice that.

3. If this is the same key as available in another torrent, then he/she has gotten it from the same source I did.

4. My uploads should and will not hurt the work of other men, as they are aware that this piece or work is original.

Long live Piracy.
Long live the TPB."

OR

2. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5007084

And when this gets black-listed I will upload another working key."
