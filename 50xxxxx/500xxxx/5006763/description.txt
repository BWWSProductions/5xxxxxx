In this offering from his period as a matinee idol, Dirk Bogarde is perfectly
cast as a stiff-upper-lipped military man.

Directed by Lewis Milestone, who was previously responsible for the
classic war film All Quiet On The Western Front, this routine picture
centres on the British assault on Rhodes during the Second World War.

Bogarde and Denholm Elliott play Lieutenant Graham and Sergeant
Corcoran, who pass time bickering before leading an attack on German
airfields on the Greek island.


Starring: Dirk Bogarde, Denholm Elliott, Akim Tamiroff
