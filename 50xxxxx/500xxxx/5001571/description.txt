*The corresponding JPEG file "PSP - Girl at the Video Game Store" is the thumbnail for the PSP*
*NOTICE* - For a thumbnail to show up on your PSP, the file name of both the MP4 & JPEG must match exactly: In the MP4 file name, please add a Space (" ") in place of the #, as shown here {"PSP#- Girl..."} so they match. My apologies for the mistake.
