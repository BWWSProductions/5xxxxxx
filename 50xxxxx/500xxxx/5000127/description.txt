        The opening paragraph of the liner notes mentions that it was the
author's intent to find the most politically backward tunes for this
compilation.  He succeeded.  "Kinko the Clown," a Dr. Demento staple of the
eighties opens the disc, and closes the disc with the follow up sequel.  Only
the eighties could give us a song about a pedophile clown, and then he
follows it up with tunes like "Teenage Enema Nurses in Bondage", "Dwarf
Tossing", "Harley David (Son of A Bitch)", and other songs you could never play in front of your mother.
In other words, a great disc.
