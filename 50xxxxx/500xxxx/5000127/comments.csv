I have a boatload of other rarities, anything else you want to see uploaded?"
,Sen-Sen,2009-07-16T19:02Z,"Hey Jimmy.....wow, my head is spinning! I'm trying to think of the other things I've been looking for. (Just popped in here to see what was up!) I've been going through my cassette compilations, and I had gotten stuck on that Brian Briggs song, so....I'll keep listening to figure out what I'd love to get, and let you know. Thanks again, Jimmy. I was looking for that song for eight years! And thanks for offering up the rarities. How very cool!"
