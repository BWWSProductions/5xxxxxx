The Brothers Grime is the new, limited edition project by Eligh & Magi (aka Tom Slick or TS). The album has six original songs with Eligh rhyming over his and Magi's beats, instrumental tracks by both, and then some mixtape style tracks (with Eligh rapping over other people's beats). "Grime" in the title refers to the fast, double time, bounce style which will definitely keep you on your toes.
