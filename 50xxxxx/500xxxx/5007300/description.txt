Originally starting out as a two piece band consisting of Gavin Harper and Christopher Bowes, Battleheart recorded an independent EP in Mel's 

home studio in early 2006. The band was completed with the addition of bassist Dani Evans and drummer Lorna Doone. Battleheart played their first

live show only five days after the members had all met together for the first time.

A second EP was recorded the same year, with Evans now featuring in the recording line-up, although the drums were again programmed. Later in the

year, the song "Set Sail And Conquer" from the EP was featured on Metal Hammer's "Battle Metal V" CD with other such bands as TÃ½r, Firewind,

HammerFall and Blind Guardian.



In early 2007, drummer Doug Swierczek left the band for personal reasons, and was replaced by Ian Wilson of the band Catharist. Later in the year

the band changed their name to Alestorm after being signed by Napalm Records (though the announcements came in reverse order). The name change 

was due to similarities with Battlelore, who were also signed to the label. Their debut album, "Captain Morgan's Revenge" was released in early

2008. The song "Captain Morgan's Revenge" was also featured on "Metal Hammer's Battle Metal VI".

In April 2008 the single Heavy Metal Pirates was released as a digital download. Ian Wilson left Alestorm in June of that year as he was unable 

to commit fully to the band, and he was temporarily replaced by German Alex Tabisz. However, Wilson rejoined the band in late August, in time for

a show at Ivory Blacks in Glasgow on August 29.



In September 2008, Bowes announced on Bloodstock's official forums that guitarist Gavin Harper had left the band due to "[Harper] no longer

having the enthusiasm for Alestorm that he once had". Additionally, Gavin posted on Alestorm's Myspace referring to his departure. Tim Shaw was

announced as Harper's replacement, but after a brief period of touring left the band. Dani Evans has since switched instruments from bass to 

guitar, and Gareth Murdock of Waylander has joined as the replacement bassist.

In late February 2009, after a second European support tour, the band embarked on the Pagan Knight's tour across North America with TÃ½r and

Suidakra.



From April to May 2009, Alestorm, TÃ½r, Heidevolk, and Adorned Brood took part in another European tour, titled "Black Sails Over Europe". A tour

CD was released by Napalm Records, containing new tracks from both Alestorm and TÃ½r's new albums, along with four songs taken from both of 

Heidevolk's albums. Only 1,000 of these CDs were produced.
