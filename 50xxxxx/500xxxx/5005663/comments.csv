,seedfo3,2009-07-29T10:49Z,"If you can seed this up to 100% for me, I'll seed it as much as I can. A while back I lost my discs, so I bought new on Ebay. Then I lost those... so now I thought, ""Fuck it! I'm gonna use torrents!"" But it's going at like 0.2KB/s...

Thanks for the upload and all that, honestly... but could you please seed for the love of Harabec?"
,EXoCiDe,2010-02-01T17:32Z,Both Tribes 1 & 2 have been re-released as freeware by Sierra... I wonder if they'd make much of a fuss if I wanted to show my support for this original classic by hosting the download over HTTP/FTP. Any thoughts?
