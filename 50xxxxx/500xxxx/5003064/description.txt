Plot:
After the events of "Ice Age: The Meltdown", life begins to
change for Manny and his friends: Scrat is still on the hunt
to hold onto his beloved acorn, while finding a possible
romance in a female sabre-toothed squirrel named Scratte
Manny and Ellie, having since become an item, are expecting
a baby, which leaves Manny anxious to ensure that everything
is perfect for when his baby arrives. Diego is fed up with
being treated like a house-cat and ponders the notion that
he is becoming too laid-back. Sid begins to wish for a family
of his own, and so steals some dinosaur eggs which leads to
Sid ending up in a strange underground world where his herd
must rescue him, while dodging dinosaurs and facing danger
left and right, and meeting up with a one-eyed weasel known
as Buck who hunts dinosaurs intently.

NOTES:
Sources used are the russian v2 cam muxed with fatal's original audio file.
The video is pretty good for a cam but does seem to lose quality as it gets into the
film,as if two sources were used....also it's over bright and lacked a touch on the
colour and contrast side of things.
Audio....6 outta 10.
