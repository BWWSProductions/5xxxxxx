,newfolder,2009-09-18T20:16Z,pls seed folkes...
,darthmarcos,2009-10-26T01:37Z,This is NOT the original pdf.  It contains scanned pages throughout.  Only a few chapters are original non scanned format.
,ab4cd,2010-01-14T17:28Z,"Hello darthmarcos,

this is original version of PDF..not a single page is scanned...

Thnx"
,Spooje,2010-01-18T20:55Z,"Actually darthmacros is right.  Scanned pages throughout, and nothing but scanned pages after chapter 8."
,pasaria,2010-01-23T23:12Z,"Spooje and darthmarcos are correct. There are several scanned pages. But, they are high-quality scans, and are very readable! Thanks for putting this up AB4CD! And thanks to all the seeders!"
,coppert,2010-02-11T19:06Z,"scanned pages start at page 13... Nice try on ab4cd's part, but if this is your first java book, i need to be able to tell the difference between a parenthesis and an open brace, a semicolon or a colon, etc.  You can definitely tell the book is scanned later on, as you see gray streaks on the left side of the page (starting on pg 49).  It may revert back to non scanned pages, but for now, I'm going to hold on to this book as a reference (the book is highly rated), and look elsewhere to learn java.  Still, having this book is better than not having at all. cheers"
,Gixxer113,2010-06-18T11:52Z,"Just curious, why even label something as non-scanned when it's this blatantly obvious? And why mix and match scanned into the original PDF? Decent copy, but some parts are a bit difficult to read."
,joshi0411,2010-08-31T09:32Z,"Hey guys. This is Java Core or Java Advanced???
Actually m a learner so don't know much about it. "
,pesmaniac,2010-11-23T08:06Z,Thank you-->> ab4cd.
,2flame,2011-01-05T11:10Z,"Thanks for this upload, ab4cd, but be warned that on page 44 of the PDF a seal is visible, stating ""Biblioteca Campus Estada de Mexico"" and a handwritten number ... you might want to re-scan or to retouch the page(s) in question."
,elex123,2011-02-18T11:53Z,hey i want to learn java so i found the name of this book on net so do i need to see the first edition or this is good?????
