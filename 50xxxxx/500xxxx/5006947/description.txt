Amazon Description

Hailed as one of the best adaptations of this Shakespearean tragedy, Grigori Kozintsevâ€™s KING LEAR is a striking epic interpretation based on a translation by novelist Boris Pasternak and driven by a stirring score by composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Kozintsev transposed the setting to a sparse landscape of moors and marshes, which provides an eerie backdrop to the bare castles and roaming bands of ragged, destitute wanderers. Thin, frail Yuri Yarvetâ€™s unique interpretation of the title role, in which he focuses on the kingâ€™s suffering and pain, was internationally acclaimed. Kozintsev, a peer of Eisensteinâ€™s who worked well into the 1960s, was a master of cinematic technique who finally achieved recognition at the end of his career for his stunning interpretations of Shakespeare. According to film historian Richard Dyer: "Paradoxically, the two most powerful films of Shakespeare plays [Hamlet and King Lear] were made not in Great Britain but in the Soviet Union."
