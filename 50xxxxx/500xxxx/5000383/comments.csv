,abhishek.dewan,2009-07-15T05:18Z,"It does install but the menu bar shows no text at all, making it unusable. For installation, you've to uninstall old technical preview version. During installation it shows Technical Preview only and not Beta."
,nkalsi,2009-07-19T18:57Z,tks m8 works perfectly 
,obry2000,2009-07-22T04:39Z,"It's a little better build overall than the public TP available from Microsoft. Also this includes Visio, Project and SharePoint designer built-in rather than the separate installations of office pro, visio, etc available on the Connect site.

Be ware though that many users, myself included can't uninstall this unless using System Restore. Also for me starting up each application for the first time after cold boot it does some Windows Installer thing which is pretty annoying."

,steroidsmithy93,2009-08-05T00:49Z,It is legit. I had problems uninstalling it. But i was aware of this problem due to it being a 'beta' so i created a system restore point. Then i thought this software was a pile of shit and no point in having it so i restored my pc back to before the installation. THAT WORKS !!!! hope ive solved any unistalling issues.
,Piumosso,2009-08-05T04:03Z,"hey! why the office logo is missing on the office menu button, it's change to ""file'f' word."

=> 2007 is a tough nut to crack. Plus it's very buggy on Win 7, even more than on Vista.
So I'd either go with 2003, or this. Guess which one I'll choose =)"
,Unigedio,2009-08-17T18:17Z,Thanks...downloading when i finish ill report if it worked or not.

,TheDukeNo1,2009-09-03T21:12Z,"I found a solution to the uninstall problem.

there's a folder in the installer files called ""Groove.en-us"". Take the Setup.xml file located there and copy it to:

C:/Program Files/Common Files/microsoft shared/OFFICE14/Office Setup Controller/Groove.en-us/

Try running the uninstaller again, and it should work."

,MoMahdi,2009-09-29T07:46Z,"SOLUTION FOR UNINSTALL ISSUE:

If you double-click on the uninstaller in the control panel window, and receive an error message telling you to run setup again from the source, do the following:

1. While the error window is open, launch task manager
2. locate the setup.exe file, right click, and select ?Open File Location? ? this will take you to the local installation folder
3. Close the error dialog box and simply copy your installation files from your CD or other folder into this one, replacing any files
4. Re-run the uninstaller from the control panel

Voila! Uninstallation proceeds as expected."
