Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy? is the sixth full-length album by Nomeansno. After the departure of long-time guitarist Andy Kerr, the group's lineup stood simply as a two-piece (brothers Rob and John Wright) at the time of the album's recording. The final track, "Cats, Sex, and Nazis", features audio samples of Faith No More's "We Care a Lot", the work of The Residents and Deep Purple, and a previously released NoMeansNo song, "I Am Wrong".

Iâ€™m not gonna lie; this is some weird shit. Itâ€™s an acquired taste. This is not an album to listen to casually in the car or while doing some other work. Maybe later on, after youâ€™ve studied it and buried yourself in it and picked up every single nuance within. But your first couple of listens? Devote yourself to it. Just you and this album. In the dark. With headphones. Turn off the rest of your life and submerge yourself in the music and words. You need to become one with this. And hereâ€™s the thing about this album: you either get it or you donâ€™t. Thereâ€™s no in between. Either your mind completely rejects it or your soul clings to every note.
