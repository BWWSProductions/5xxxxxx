I only ask because I happen to have a couple cyan/magenta glasses lying around.  They mostly work, surprisingly, but a cyan/magenta version of the video would be useful, as I think this type of glasses is more common for people to own.

But anyway, thanks for the rip!
I love all the 3D stuff people are putting up these days."
