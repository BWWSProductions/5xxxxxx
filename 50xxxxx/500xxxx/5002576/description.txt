Allmusic.com review:
"The biggest selling album of Barbra Streisand's career is also one of her least characteristic. The album was written and produced by Barry Gibb in association with his brothers and the producers of the Bee Gees, and in essence it sounds like a post-Saturday Night Fever Bee Gees album with vocals by Streisand. Gibb adapted his usual style somewhat, especially in slowing the tempos and leaving more room for the vocal, but his melodic style and the backup vocals, even when they are not sung by the Bee Gees, are typical of them. Still, the record was more hybrid than compromise, and the chart-topping single "Woman in Love" has a sinuous feel that is both right for Streisand and new for her. Other hits were the title song and "What Kind of Fool," both duets with Gibb. (The song "Guilty" won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal by Duo or Group.)"

Personal note from uploader: "one of her least charactestic"? Right - so the reason it sold 14 million copies in the US alone and won that Grammy is not that it's an absolute masterpiece then? :-) Or to put it another way; this is - IMHO - the first in a trilogy of classic albums written and produced by the brothers Gibb:  Barbra's "Guilty" (1980), The Bee Gees' "Living Eyes" (1981) and Dionne Warwick's "Heartbreaker" (1982). The first and the last one you're probably familiar with, but have you heard that one in the middle? If not, you're not alone - and here's your chance:
