A collection of short films that aired on SciFi Channel's Exposure once upon a time.
Resolution is generally 320 x 240.
File format is generally .flv.
Quality varies.
Films with speaking are in English, except for Hasta Los Huesos, which is presumably in Spanish. Also, Elevated is subtitled in Spanish (presumably and inexplicably).

If /when I manage to find more of these wonderful short films, I shall make a part II.
