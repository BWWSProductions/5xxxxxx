,leshkraven,2009-07-20T18:10Z,Winrar unpacks the files fine for me try extracting with out confirmation this films is good quality but has hardcoded subs on and i dont know why because its in english  
,Dr_Science,2009-07-21T17:03Z,"Maybe I did something wrong but only the first half will play for me. anyone else have the same problem? I probly just need to re-extract the files.

pissed though really into the movie. gives me a chance for a smoke I guess.  if re-extracting doesnt work I will comment again."

V:10
