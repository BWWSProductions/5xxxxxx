This is a collection of torrents relating to the successful treatment of cancer. Please download and load the torrent files you want to watch / read. I found it very difficult to find a lot of these file names in searches so hopefully you have managed to find this torrent with ease. 

If you know of any other cancer documentaries that are not listed here or in my 'health torrent' collection please leave a link / name in the comments.

Please remember to seed as long as possible both this torrent and the files you download as you will be saving lives :)
