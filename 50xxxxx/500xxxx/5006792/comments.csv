I do rememer he was promoting a company called shaklee though, who sell vitomins, he was basicly saying in so many words, taht the vitomins you buy at your health food store are DEAD! even natural ones due to the way they have been processed"

I am doing research on ""prevention"". Isn't it sad that americans wait till we are old and in bad health BEFORE we start to learn how to live and eat? Do we have to DIE before we learn how to LIVE? IT seems like it. Check out vegan stuff, too. THX"
