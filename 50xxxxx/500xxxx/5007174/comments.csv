the only problem i have is getting the activator to actually activate the windows but so far no luck"
,connor112case,2009-07-19T05:37Z,"Ok I want Windows 7 RTM so bad but before I download I do have questions.

1. Has anyone confirmed this is real?
2. Has it been cracked?
3. Is this ISO. bootable in anyway?
4. Can it update to Microsoft's final update in october?

Answers will be very appreciated!

P.S. I'm not criticizing AiTB most of AiTB's torrents that i have downloaded are valid and stable. 

Thanks
Case"

Thanks man this is Case TPB decided to delete my old account for some unknown reason anyway my 3rd question was meant in a different since what I was asking was ""is the ISO bootable""

But now I have another open question to those that have installed this torrent can you please explain step-by-step how you went by installing this torrent it woul be well appreciated.

Thanks

,omega59,2009-07-19T23:26Z,this is not confirmed to be final as of yet.
,shadow112fox,2009-07-20T03:09Z,"@omega59 

Ok now I can answer yes this is real its legit 100%

But i'm having problems with the activator im not sure why."
,Death_Lord,2009-07-21T15:51Z,"Thanks, but I've one question... When I'm using software with English language, it's all right. But when I'm using software with Russian language, I see incorrect symbols like I'm using not correct encoding in browser. What can I do?"
,Reece71079,2009-07-22T04:48Z,"Thanks, this is fully bootable and working the build is (6.1,Build 7600) on Dxdiag, there is no code on the bottom right hand screen so I pruseme this could be a final. The only thing I seem to be suffering with is when I go to transfer files on to disc a 4.30GB file takes about 2 hours to burn, Im sure it never took that long before!!! I dont know what other peolpe have found problems with this, but some feed back of problems from other people would be nice. Thanks"
,KKELTIKK,2009-07-23T20:46Z,"

""he actual build that Microsoft is using as the final one -- build 7600.16385 -- has already leaked to the Web -- several days ahead of Microsoft's confirmation that it was, in fact, the final version.""

OK so there you have it this is it down load away woo hoo"

,funnyname,2009-08-05T14:21Z,"@connor112case: No question this one may be the same as the original. Here you can verify that the ISO is untouched:

Read the info and compare the checksum. If untouched then the checksum should be the same here."
