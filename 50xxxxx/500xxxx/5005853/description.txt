Bios/reviews:

With her affinity for bowler hats, punky couture, and imprecise indie pop, Lissy Trullie established herself as a New York fashion icon and emerging musician in 2008. Her well-clad figure graced the pages of such fashion magazines as Elle, SOMA, and Jalouse, while her lo-fi musical demos attracted the attention of several record labels. Trullie eventually signed with American Myth Recordings and released her debut EP, Self-Taught Learner in Febrary 2009. ~ Andrew Leahey, All Music Guide

"With a tomboy growl and Televisionâ€“ish guitar hooks, her first EP brings enough attitude to put art stars in their place. 'The notches in your belt make your pants tight!' she taunts. Then she makes those tight pants move to a bruising cover of Hot Chip's "Ready for the Floor." The girl can rock an afterâ€“after party." -ROLLING STONE

[...] the talented full-of-attitude singer-songwriter Lissy Trullie with her band who make their U.S. television debut performing the clever single "Boy Boy" from their first EP Self-taught Learner at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles (check the shoes - love the choices cameramen make sometimes - this band's on par with great female up-and-comers like Ida Maria, Little Boots, and Anya Marina). Chrissie Hynde (of The Pretenders) can now stop looking for a musical successor. [...] every track a gem!
