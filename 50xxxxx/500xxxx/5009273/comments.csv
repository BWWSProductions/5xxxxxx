,Sokaleks,2009-07-24T01:17Z,is this game with 47 or 48 protocol? where i can find 48 pr.?
,WhiteChapelJukebox,2009-07-24T07:14Z,"Toca91, JpSpoon, and Criz619...I have one option that might work. Compatability Mode. You could try that or run in Resolution 640x480...
Right Click shortcut,
Click Properties
Go to Compatability
Select Compatabilty choice
Or try, Run is Resolution 640x680
[I run Windows XP Home Edition 32bit, no problems, I dont know about Vista 32b or 64b users.]"
,WhiteChapelJukebox,2009-07-24T07:16Z,"And this actually installs the game. It does not run from a directory from your desktop, my documents etc."
,jerkku97,2009-07-25T22:37Z,can you help me WhiteChapelJukebox ? my counter strike not action :(
,blankmew,2009-07-25T23:34Z,"""Component MSCOMCTL.OCX or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid. ""
Try running it in Administrator. Right click it and properties and go to the tab ""Compatibility"" and check Running as Administrator. I didn't downloaded it yet but it can be worth a try."
,WhiteChapelJukebox,2009-07-27T05:07Z,"jerkku97, please explain to me how it is not working. What operating system do you run? And, Do you run XP/Vista?"
,trent1542,2009-07-28T09:12Z,"I get the ""Component MSCOMCTL.OCX or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid"" message when trying to launch the game. I tried 640x480 resolution and running as administrator. Any help?"
,undentify420,2009-07-29T19:28Z,"wtf, this game is crashing my system and everytime its at the ""Loading page to connect to game"" the screen gets lines going across then my computer restarts.....what is going on?!"
,WhiteChapelJukebox,2009-07-30T09:35Z,"Well, I run this game on Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition 32bit. ATI Radeon 9200 512mb Graphics card. 1GB RAM. Intel Pentium Processor. 1024x768 Resolution. And no problems. No restarting, crashing errors, or anything. I don't really know what the problem is and how to fix it because of me not using Vista."
,xeed001,2009-08-07T17:57Z,is this vista ready?
,trungeta,2009-08-08T20:12Z,"i like this game

,thoughtc,2009-08-16T05:25Z,"damn I'm getting the error message like the rest of you guys. damn, I guess it isn't vista ready."
