This is perhaps one of Hulsbeck's finest albums, and nearly impossible to find! Also one of his first..... and BEST! It contains some of the most dreamy-type techno ever, and is more musical in style, rather than "game music" like his more recent works. Anyway this beautiful album is a must for all lovers of nice electronica and trance music!
