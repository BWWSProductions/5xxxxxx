At age 17, high school senior Kaitlyn DiBenedetto â€“ who performs under the fitting alias â€œJust Kaitâ€ â€“ will have her single â€œSickâ€ featured as the â€œDiscover & Downloadâ€ track on MTV, MTV2, and mtvU the week of July 20th. Discover & Download showcases todayâ€™s hottest new artists and emerging bands just breaking onto the scene. Just Kait will join the likes of The Ting Tings, Duffy, Flo Rida, and Leona Lewis as the newest Discover & Download feature. â€œSickâ€ has also been chosen as the E! Network theme song for their Summer 2009 branding campaign. A segment featuring the song will air for fourteen weeks, through August 29th.

A self-taught multi-instrumentalist, DiBenedetto began playing drums at age 5, picked up guitar at age 11, and started performing acoustic shows and collaborating with local bands shortly after. She then caught the ear of MTV last year by winning a contest which had invited musicians to create a new theme song for the â€œParental Controlâ€ program. At just 17, the punk rock prodigy has risen to the national music platform with features on the MTV and E! Networks.

DiBenedetto has taken the stage at venues and events such as the Stone Pony, Starland Ballroom, Bamboozle, and the Toms River Fest. Working under the alias â€œJust Kaitâ€, Kaitlynâ€™s radio-friendly rock-n-roll is infused with a pop-punk sensibility that has set her on a course for musical stardom, proving that when talent meets hard work and dedication, itâ€™s makes for a sick combination.
