Until now, the Brooklyn rapper Fabolous kept his private life under wraps. Not only did he stay quiet about getting shot three years agoâ€”a rarity among rappersâ€”he also chose to keep his relationship and the birth of his first child out of the public eye.

Recently, though, he's changed his tune. With the release of his fifth studio album, "Loso's Way," out July 28 on Desert Storm/Def Jam Records, Fabolous says he's ready to get personal.

"For a while it felt like my personal life was just my personal life," says Fabolous, born John Jackson. "But I started to feel more comfortable in my skin and with myself as a public figure, and I wanted to share more of my character with my fans. I also felt it could help my music too, especially this album."
