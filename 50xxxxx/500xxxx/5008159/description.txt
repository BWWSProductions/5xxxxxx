DANCE CRAZE re-edited 2009 Best of Britsh ska.

The reunion of the Specials made me look for old and new material a rude boy by heart.

This is a re-edited version of the 1981 ska concert. I used the dvd transfer from "bowenjaybee" Why because the movie itself was a dissapoinment, not filmed and edited very good.

I upgraded the boring intro, uused partly black and white, shortend it and made new titles. 
Also I grouped the songs by band. So I think you better enjoy the concert.Put titles with band names and with each song.  New fans will enjoy it much easier. 
I replaced the boring ballet dancing parts of Madness's Swan Lake with other footage, from teh movie. It's tighter and faster. The outro is also upgraded, also using partly black and white.

I have never had seen the film before, only heard of it, I was 12 then, living in the Netherlands, but if I had seen my version in the cinemas I would have enjoyed it.

Bowenjaybee, thank you for the dvd-transfer and the first cuts.

Well I hope you also will enjoy
