Money as debt is a very interesting documentary, that everyone should see.
To me it was a bit shocking and a real eye-opener. It explains in a lot of ways why
it is such a mess in this world.

It explains in a very simple and easy to understand way:

* How money is created and where it really comes from.
* How our moneysystem works.
* How banks can loan such insane amounts of money.
* Why everyone is so heavily in debt.
* Why our money is worth less and less.
* Why asking interrest over a loan is not a good idea.
* Why the stuff we buy gets crappier and needs to be replaced sooner.
* That modern banking is the biggest scam ever.
* How totally screwed we really are.

Burn the iso to an empty DVD and watch it with your dvd-player. Speech is in English and Dutch subs are provided. Those need to be enabled with the remote. Also note the the first 10-20 seconds will show a black screen. This doesn't mean that the DVD does not work.

I urge everyone to hand this documentary to friends and family.
