Fly Or Die - NERD [2004]


Wikipedia

Fly Or Die Is The Second Album For Rock Band N*E*R*D Consisting Of Pharrell And Chad Hugo Of Production Team The Neptunes And Shay Haley.
The Band Recorded Its Second Album Fly Or Die During 2003. The Band Actually Learned The Instruments Needed To Play The Tunes, So They Could Perform Live. As Chad Hugo Told MTV News On December 9, 2003, "We're The Ones Playing The Instruments Live This Time. I Just Started Playing Guitar Last Year So I'm Learning As We Go. Pharrell's Playing Drums. Last Time, (On In Search Of...) We Didn't Have Time To Learn Certain Instruments So We Got Spymob To Help Us Out."

The Band Also Recruited Some Assistance To Record The Album With Lenny Kravitz Playing On The Track "Maybe" & "Jump," a collaboration with members of Good Charlotte.
 Several Of Tracks Concern Issues Of Particular Concern To Adolescents Including "Thrasher" About Bullies, "Drill Sergeant" About Rebellion And Conscription, And First Love On "Backseat Love".


I Have Split Tracks 7, 8 & 12 Into Separate Tracks, But I Have Also Left The Original As Is. 
The Bonus Tracks I Have Numbered As 13, 14 & 15, So You Can Either Keep The Existing 12 Track Albums Or You Can Have A 15 Track Album, The Choice Is Yours.
