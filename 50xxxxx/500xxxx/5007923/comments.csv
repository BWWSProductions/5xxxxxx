And here's a challenge for you: to find a rare horror flix called ""Inugami no Tatari"", directed by Shunya "" Female Scorpion"" Ito. It don't have an IMDb page. I don't know the english title for it (and I don't know if there's any) but in Brazil it was shown in cinemas as ""A Maldição do Cão"", something like ""The Curse of the Dog""."
