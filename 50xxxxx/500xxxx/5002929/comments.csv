[T],liluser,2009-08-07T13:16Z,"@ staf4d2   one of my friends just installed this xp in a dell, he had bsod at one point but found out he had a bad ram in one of hes slots, he took out the bad ram and all was fine.."
,FlankerB1,2009-08-23T17:03Z,"I think qasaz is talking about slipstreamed drivers, not driver packs. ICH9 and ICH10 drivers are required for some pc's (mostly laptops) prior driverpack installation. If this windows have them slipstreamed (in that initial bluescreen fase of the installation) then it is ok. If they are a part of the chipset driverpacks then you can't install these windows on some pcs (HP 6735s, HP 6835s, ...). In that case without a floppy you're screwed."
,xdraider97,2009-08-27T06:34Z,Do you need Serial or anything else??
,xdraider97,2009-08-27T06:45Z,and how do i Need install sata drive?

,FlankerB1,2009-09-24T19:43Z,Some win xp instalations have unattended.txt file in their i386 folder. The file shows which key is used. This one doesn't have this file. What is the key used? I need it to build a usb stick installation from these windows (windows installable from a usb stick).
[T],liluser,2009-09-26T09:36Z,@ FlankerB1  there is a txt doc on the disk called XP PRO X86.TXT the key will be in there...
