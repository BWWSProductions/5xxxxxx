Step by step synth programming guide with over 300 example patches for 5 particular synths including refx vanguard, big tick rhino, camel audio cameleon, rgc:audio z3ta, wusikstation and vemer audio surge. you can follow along with these examples if you have a similar synth however, as all example patches are included in this torrent and all synths have demos on their respected websites listed at the beginning of the book I would suggest you get these demos. You will not regret it provided you already have a decent technical knowledge of synths eg. polarity, phase and oscillator sync as this book gets down and dirty without the nonsense. Enjoy!
