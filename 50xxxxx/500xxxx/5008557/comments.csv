,rtorrent,2009-11-02T09:48Z,"Hey,
U rock man... thanks for the uplaod.. is this file only 499MB after extraction? i just wondering if you can help, as the File is 1.33GB and when extracted using 7-Zip the file seems to be only 499MB..
I am a fan of yours.."
,rtorrent,2009-11-12T17:58Z,Anybody is there to help me?
[T],FatFreddy756,2009-11-20T04:26Z,"@ rtorrent

there should be a bigger file after the extraction. Try updating your 7-zip and make sure that there are no errors when extracting.
And thanks for being a fan :)"
,CaptainPike,2009-12-10T20:41Z,I extracted the .DVD file using 7-zip -- now which program do I use to open and watch the tutorial? Thanks.
,gologango,2009-12-15T03:35Z,"gayyy

,gologango,2009-12-24T02:55Z,"Nevermind, i got 7zip to work in crossover 

Thanks for the torrent."
,brekfust,2010-02-05T09:31Z,"Having trouble with these videos. I've tried unzipping with 7zip, winrar, and universal extractor and most of the videos will not play. Sometimes theres an error when unzipping, sometimes not. The files acted like they were corrupt so I actually redownloaded the torrent with the same results. When trying to play the video files I get ""error -36: an i/o error occured,"" any ideas?"
