,Dechy,2009-07-15T13:14Z,"ill comment soon as its ripped mate!either way kudos for supplying the subs, its veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrry frustrating when ppl dont up the subs with a film or say that ppl will have to guess some of the dialogue! hopefully will be all good"
,breathing,2009-07-18T04:11Z,"Cheers, man, appreciate it, as I had a bloody hard time finding decent subs for Da Vinci Code which rendered the movie unwatchable due to all the foreign speech."
,rounder,2009-07-19T10:56Z,"A nice first little torrent. Thanks!
This subtitle file helped a lot."
,ZeroMercury,2009-07-19T20:55Z,"I can't get the subtitles to work. I put them in the same folder, named the same and nothing."
,Torrent_chris,2009-07-20T07:05Z,"@zeroMercury
are you sure they are name the exact same just one has .srt the other has .avi or w.e file type it is.

try copying one name and pasting it on the other so you kno theey are exact.

if so try downloading my other torrent for the ipod it has subtitles"
