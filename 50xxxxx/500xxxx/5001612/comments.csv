,lateball,2009-07-14T07:40Z,"If anyone knows spanish, could you please translate what that lady said to Esteban at the end. Also, who was she?"
,henry76,2009-07-14T10:56Z,Awsome show. Thanks eztv :)
,diecelinedion,2009-07-14T11:10Z,"Here?s the translation:

==============================
PILAR
""What do you think you are doing? You didn't think I would find out that you're screwing this fucking white girl? Now you want to marry her? All the eyes of Mexico are on you. I invested my hope, my money, my time into you and you do this to me? You should have killed her when you had the chance. You need to choose.""

ESTEBAN
Are you saying that I have to choose between you and Nancy?

PILAR
No, Esteban. I am saying you have to choose between yourself and her.
=============================

Pilar is another crime boss/drug lord. 

Woohoo!  :D"

,Inspectah13,2009-07-14T19:23Z,"@lawson_jl, aye they have their own site, but even from there eztv still uses tpb trackers, so the question is a good one, where will eztv up to if the tpb tracker goes legit?"
,randomguy12,2009-07-15T01:27Z,how do you know the girl's name at the end and how do you know that she is another crime/drug lord
,lateball,2009-07-15T04:03Z,"Thanks for the translation, and torrent."

,diecelinedion,2009-07-15T08:31Z,"@randomguy12:
Google ""Pilar"", dork. It's all over the internet, the actress has been doing interviews about her new role on the show."
,buccopal,2009-07-18T07:51Z,"File did not contain avi prefix, and was random radio sounds under VLC preview."
,Inspectah13,2009-07-18T15:50Z,"@ buccopal , This download works great, just like everything i've ever gotten from eztv, not sure what happened for you but this copy is good..."
