ITÂ´S A VERY STUPID FILM, BUT GOOD FOR LAUGHS, I NEVER FORGOT THAT THEY NEVER POINT A GUN AT SOMEONE WITHOUT ENDING IN A FIST FIGHT AND THE BEST IS THE ONE IN WHICH A BAD ONE WEARING A HAT (YOU HAD TO AT THE TIME) GETS PUNCHED BEHIND A COUNTER AND THEN SLOWLY STANDS UP HALF DAZED... BUT WITH THE HAT STILL ON... WAS IT GLUED TO HIS HEAD? A FRIEND AND I LITERALLY ROLLED ALL OVER THE AISLE OF THE CINEMA LAUGHING AT THE SHEER STUPIDITY OF IT ALL, ESPECIALLY THE FLYING GUY, IT WAS THREE STEPS AND BOOM, UP HE WENT LIKE A BULLET. :-)"
