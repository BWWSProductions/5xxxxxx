TALES OF DESTINY:

Stahn Aileron wants to leave the dull day-to-day workings of his village and seek fame and fortune in the world. The first chance he gets, Stahn stows away on a dragonship. Unfortunately, he is caught and must swab the decks. When the ship is attacked, Stahn escapes with a piece of valuable cargo a talking sword. But this is only the beginning of a much larger adventure, as Stahn will travel the world searching for other heroes that are tied to him by fate. He will also have to battle a relentless flow of enemies in a real-time battle system. Graphically, dungeons and battle are rendered with hand-drawn 2D animation, while the world is rendered in 3D. You must help Stahn discover his true nature in TALES OF DESTINY.
