Celtic Collection - Clannad [1999]
	
Amazon By  Matt Johnson 

Celtic Collection is a fine mix of a very broad range of Clannad's repertoire. From the modern frenetic intensity of "A MhuirnÃ­n Ã“", to the peace of "Coinleach Glas An FhÃ³mhair", there really is something for everyone here.
Most of the music here is from Clannad's later, more "modern" releases. If you've found Clannad from the "new age" and modern element, this CD will most probably be to your liking thanks to tracks such as "A MhuirnÃ­n Ã“" and "ThiÃ³s FÃ¡'n ChÃ³sta", the latter with a subtle, bluesy intensity which makes it intensely memorable. Fans of the Celtic element need not be disappointed either, with "Buachaill On Eirne" and "Alasdair MacColla" providing a well-needed balance.
