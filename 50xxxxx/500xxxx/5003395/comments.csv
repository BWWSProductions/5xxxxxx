,crazydementedman,2009-07-15T02:05Z,saw the sample a/8 v/8 not bad at all not as crisp as a dvd rip but definitely looots better than a cam version. Its probably the best looking one out there till a dvd rip comes out.

,Jimmy54669,2009-07-18T22:23Z,"Downloaded the movie.  Have only watched the first halk so far.  So far very funny.  Everything seems to be just fine.  Three small letters pop up from time to time at the bottom right of the screen.  Don't really notice them and dosn't hurt the movie.
