,cptnjeanlucpicard,2009-08-07T06:26Z,"Thank you djarmani, you are right, I certainly do appreciate it, excellent work!!!"
,item9,2009-08-23T15:59Z,If you want a real fight watch Boxing. Instead of a couple Pansie's half naked holding each other in a cage. Seriously They should just film bar fights MMA my ass. Nothing mixed about it lol just pure old fashioned ass grabbing.
,BigSniff,2009-08-27T22:10Z,Are you angry cos you got an erection while watching MMA? Or maybe cos you decided to tug on said erection? Or was it cos you blew your load all over your keyboard in record time while fapping to MMA?
,weepndvl,2009-09-08T03:34Z,"Actually, most boxers get their heads kicked in while in the octagon.  I find that a lot of boxing is boring due to the fact that they clinch a lot of the time.  By the way, I have UFC 1-101. Ha ha ha.  Let's get it on!!!"

,Rexus4Real,2010-01-03T16:39Z,boxing isnÂ´t even a real sport. most figths end with headbuts and cuts. wow and they cheat all the time and the promotors cheat even more. mma is the future boxing is dead. just dont go the ppv way..
,rickyno1,2010-01-17T16:56Z,Whats the beef with mma item9 Did a mma fighter bone your boyfriends ass or something. I done a bit of boxing and mma and can tell you this. MMA is as real as it gets and thats why most boxers carnt cut it in mma.
,xsaintxjames,2010-02-09T02:09Z,"AMAZING COLLECTION!
10/10
Loved seeing the history of the UFC as a person who has recently developed the love for the UFC.
MMA has my respect all the way - 
I love what it has become and hope it is legalized in more parts of Canada.  GSP!!!"
