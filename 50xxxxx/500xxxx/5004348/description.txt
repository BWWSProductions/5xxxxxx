ok, so as i'm sure you know weird al has been around for a long time and has made many many hilarious music videos in that time, but what you may not know is that he's also made fake interviews with celebrities that are hilarious, and that many funny music videos for his songs were made by some of his loyal fans. also, he had a tv show that had some other musical moments on it. so, long story short, i decided to get a collection of the best of the best of weird al videos! i'm pretty sure i got too many  ;D 

i got some of these from other torrents, but most of them from other places on the internet (al-oholics,newgrounds, and albinoblacksheep mostly) or created them myself...either way, a lot of work has gone into this torrent, so i hope you appreciate my hard work!

ok, so what's in here...here's a list of all the files, the all caps means that those files are in a category together

Weird Al - On the Simpsons.avi

ok, so i think it's pretty self explanatory, but in case you're dumb...

the "other" files are ones i couldn't figure out anywhere else to put
the "ALTV clips" are music videos from ALTV
"Behind the Scenes and extras" some behind the scenes and extra stuff from his music videos
"Fan Videos" videos made of his songs by his fans
"Interviews" the fake interviews he has done over the years
"Official Music Videos" All music videos that Al has released officially. includes "the ultimate weird al video collection", the videos from "Straight Outta Lynwood" and the two that he released within the last month
"Old Clips" two reeeeally old videos of him performing when he first started out
"Polka music video compilations" his polka medleys with the matching original music videos. basically, his song, but the original artists' videos
"Simpsons" two times he appeared on the simpsons

[b][u]A NOTE ABOUT QUALITY[/u][/b]

the quality on everything important is anywhere from good to great, but there are a couple videos with icky quality. a couple of the interviews are pretty bad, but watchable, along with the "green eggs and ham" clip. other than those though, everything else is great.

please seed this beast and comment! enjoy  :)
