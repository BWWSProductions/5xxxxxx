Episode 7: Heart of Darkness

Spirits are on the upswing as the expedition starts its trek to the Malagarasi. With the finish line is finally in sight, the three experienced explorers use their common love of exploration to help them put aside their differences and enjoy the remainder of the expedition while Kevin has his sights set on the finish line. The group reaches an abandoned village where they reluctantly set up camp near croc-infested waters (they would learn that the village was abandoned because crocs attacked the children). Pasquale and Benedict find themselves getting along, while Kevin grows frustrated. The next day, Pasquale wants to get moving early because thunderstorms and danger loom on the horizon. They make their way to their next campsite, where a night of chatting leads the explorers to open up about their pasts and gives them a better perspective on their fellow expedition mates. The next day, they will begin the final trek toward Ujiji. They must say goodbye to the porters who have helped them come this far. But now, traveling alone, the rains come...
