My own rip of Pink Floyd - Echoes (The Best Of Pink Floyd), 2CD's. I ripped it using the Uberstandard way (Uberstandard.org). Uberstandard is just a guide on how to best rip cd's. The bitrate is around 200kb/s and variable. This makes sure that the audio fidelity is extremely high and even audiophiles with the best equipment and extremely good ears will have a really hard time (if they succeed at all) telling this one from the original.

So with the high fidelity and superior ripping method Uberstandard.org describes, this is 'practically lossless' and using higher bitrates would be silly.
