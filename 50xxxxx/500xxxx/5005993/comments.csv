However, if you seriously believe that 9/11 happened the way the feds say, then you are very misled.  There is no fucking way building 7 fell so gracefully into its own footprint without explosives.  That alone makes me ask, what the fuck is the real truth.  No one will ever know the real truth and it isn't what the feds have tried to propagate to the media.

To all the sheeple, just keep watching the news and believe everything you are told by CNN, MSNBC, etc cause that's all you can handle.

If you watch an Alex Jones video, please don't accept everything as fact. 

As for blaming Alex Jones for starting hate and wars, are you kidding me?  Religion is used as a base to breed hate and start wars all the time.  Look at how our people / media have treated Muslims since 9/11."

[T],Knaster,2009-08-19T01:41Z,This is the truth and this has nothing to do with rascism since it's basically a white ruled plot to gain more power over ALL COUNTRIES. International bankers are ruled by gangsters and ex nazi backers.

I think its the other way round. Alex Jones, the guy who screams like a monkey claiming that atheists have no morals, that America is a Christian nation (just as it's a straight white nation), if there is someone you want to make the ""9/11 truthers"" look bad, Alex Jones is your guy."
