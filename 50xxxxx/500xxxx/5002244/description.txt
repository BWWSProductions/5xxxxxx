Bellydance!

DVD Rip

Thanks go to a friend.

Performance video of some of the stars of bellydance...mixture of styles from Persian to Tribal. Has Ansuya and a funny number by Dondi where she is pretending to again be what the first people thought bellydance was back when it first became scandalous/risque at the Chicago world Fair thingy...so it has lots of exagerated moves/veil swirling...its just so funny to watch.
