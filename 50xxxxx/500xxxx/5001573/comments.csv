,thatswhatshewatched,2009-07-14T05:17Z,"This is not a DVDRip.  It's a Digital Distribution Copy. Way better than a cam but not quite DVD quality. (although I've seen worse DVDRips)

The origianl source was the .mkv that hit earlier today.  I just converted to 16:9 XviD for those of us who prefer .avi.  I won't rate it out of ten since I upped it.  Hope you enjoy.  :)"
,ruudsach,2009-07-14T10:48Z,"Quality is not great, i hope uploader agrees.

What i want to know how much you rate this DDC to general DVDrips?

I know sound is just awful. No amount of increasing the speakers volume will it sound any better. Its mp3 and no bass effects."
,ruudsach,2009-07-14T10:50Z,"I am assuming this version is cropped because we are yet to see DVDrip's wide screen of this movie.

How much is cropped depends on the releaser's discretion"
,sdhdhgdgb,2009-07-15T03:35Z,"Very Pleased!

V=8/10
A=9/10

Only problem is it's cropped to much, why crop at all?  Was the source a cam.  Not complaining just don't understand why it needed to be cropped.  Thought DDC was like a screener copy.   ???
Thanx for the upload thatswhatshewatched"
