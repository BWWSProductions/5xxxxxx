The Crow is a 1994 American action-thriller film adaptation of the 1989 comic book of the same name by James O'Barr. The film was adapted by David J. Schow and John Shirley, and directed by Alex Proyas. The Crow stars Brandon Lee, in his final film, as Eric Draven, a rock musician who comes back from the dead to avenge his own murder, as well as that of his fiancÃ©e. While filming in the closing weeks of production, Lee was killed when a dummy bullet, which had become lodged in one of the guns, was fired into his abdomen. Despite the incident, the film was a critical and commercial success upon 








The Crow 1994


The soundtrack to the movie The Crow was released in 1994. Its biggest hit song was "Big Empty" by the Stone Temple Pilots, which was also on their album Purple. This album featured many covers including Nine Inch Nails who covered Joy Division's "Dead Souls," Pantera who covered Poison Idea's "The Badge," and Rollins Band who covered Suicide's "Ghost Rider," which is about a Marvel Comics character. Rage Against the Machine re-recorded their 1991 b-side Darkness of Greed and simply re-named it "Darkness" especially for this soundtrack. Also, The Cure wrote the song "Burn" for the movie. Despite requests, they have never performed the song live.[citation needed] James O'Barr, the creator of The Crow, is a big fan of The Cure and lyrics to the song "The Hanging Garden" by The Cure even appear in the original comic book.

The Crow â€“ Salvation 2000


The soundtrack to the third in the Crow film series, The Crow: Salvation album is once again compiled and produced by Jeff Most. As with the soundtrack to The Crow: City of Angels, Salvation includes an otherwise unavailable cover version by Hole: this time of Bob Dylan's "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue". Several other contemporary big-name artists are also included, indicating that even at this late stage in the series, The Crow brand name still held a certain cache within the grunge / industrial / gothic rock scene. This would not extend to the fourth film, The Crow: Wicked Prayer however, for which no soundtrack album was ever released. In the UK, the release of The Crow: Salvation's soundtrack pre-dated the release of the film itself by four years. The film was finally released straight to DVD in 2004. The Juliette Lewis track is not an example of the actress' recent Juliette and the Licks project. The song is primarily performed by The Infidels, but features a sample of Lewis singing "Born Bad", taken from the film Natural Born Killers.
