Last Call with Carson Daly - June 3, 2009

Carson hosts from the West Coast Choppers warehouse in Long Beach, CA (run by none other than Jesse James, aka Mr. Sandra Bullock), where gearheads can fill their dreams with custom hotrods, choppers and anything else that has an engine, even a low-emission one.

Guests: rapper/producer/shoe designer Mike Shinoda of legendary rock band Linkin Park (try his DC kicks), the very entertaining standup comedian (and dad to a restless young son) Jo Koy (catch his act on the DVD "Don't Get Me Angry"), and the talented full-of-attitude singer-songwriter Lissy Trullie with her band who make their U.S. television debut performing the clever single "Boy Boy" from their first EP Self-taught Learner at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles (check the shoes - love the choices cameramen make sometimes - this band's on par with great female up-and-comers like Ida Maria, Little Boots, and Anya Marina). Chrissie Hynde (of The Pretenders) can now stop looking for a musical successor.

Lissy Trullie - Self-taught Learner EP (every track a gem!):
