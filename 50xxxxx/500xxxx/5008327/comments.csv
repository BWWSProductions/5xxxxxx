,ojuice3112,2011-04-22T07:11Z,"I can't get it to work. I installed it, but when I try opening it it says it ""could not startup [my] digital sound card. Please check the Install settings and make sure they are correct for the card installed in your machine. This can also be caused by a read error on the CD-ROM.""
Then it says ""a processor excpetion has occured. Your system may be unstable at this point."" I can't figure out how to get back to the intall menu.
Please help, I have been dying to replay this game for about 10 years"

I type wc3, it goes through the install routine, and then says ""can't create save game directory"" and aborts to dos."
,HereticF,2011-11-07T21:37Z,"Hi! I have problem with installing the game under Dosbox. After I set everything and save settings, then it quits and saying one file is not readable. Anyone have any idea how to solve it? I mounted two ways the .iso but always the same problem. Thanks for help!!"
,JF21,2012-04-29T09:02Z,hey! I tried downloading the images on to disc and running the games and still isnt working. When playing the disc back it just opens and shows the same iso. file. How do I get this game running?
