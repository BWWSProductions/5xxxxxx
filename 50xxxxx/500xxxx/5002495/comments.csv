,badykay,2009-07-15T16:58Z,ok...let me try to download it also
,slothin21,2009-07-16T02:15Z,Haven't watched yet but I'm getting great speeds...
,tmaxxgod4,2009-07-16T03:20Z,I would love to download this....but I refuse as the file name is analshit-th.avi ... that makes me wonder why it says that... is this truely the movie?
,lienenkugel,2009-07-16T05:37Z,"tmaxxgod4, I've never seen anything from AiTB that wasn't as promised. "
,derrenfox,2009-07-16T06:36Z,"GREAT, IN A DECENT FORMAT ASWELL UNLIKE THE OTHER ONE CAN EASILY RIP WITH NERO,,, CHEERS"
,equazcion,2009-07-16T20:56Z,"Like the other AnalShit releases, this is just the DDC version with the aspect ratio corrected, and encoded with a higher bitrate to create a larger file. The quality isn't actually any better than the DDC, and it's certainly not a DVD screener."
,btheworm,2009-07-17T00:37Z,"Thanks AiTB, worked great. AV Quality is as Sativa85 says to anyone in doubt out there. "
,izmikey,2009-07-17T04:51Z,"This torrent is great, close to dvd quality. Its the best quality for this movie so far.
V=9
A=9"
,snkbrn,2009-07-17T16:04Z,"dude, you come out with the most badass screeners ever. keep it up. by far the best version of this movie.

A=10
V=10"
,smm1099,2009-07-18T08:45Z,"Great Quality. Way better than anything else.
V:9 A:9. Pretty damn close DVDrip."
,nova19,2009-07-18T20:19Z,"gr8 quality... v=9,a=9!!! 
cool movie...."
,equazcion,2009-07-18T22:20Z,I love the 10/10 ratings. That's just hysterical.
,signalman4,2009-07-19T07:05Z,"Horrible quality.  The framerate is 29.97 (movies are 23.976) and the encoder used a bad resize algorithm.  Even the ""WB"" at the beginning is a little jagged."
,blkjak_21,2009-07-20T04:03Z,half the movie the audio was out of sync
,ladiesman117,2009-07-20T05:04Z,Dude what the fuck is with the ARS everytime the fuckin movie switches scenes!
,the0d0r,2009-07-20T19:23Z,"I can't play this movie...
I've tried with VLC, MPC, WMP.
Any tips or ideas? Thanks!"
,ringmaster510,2009-07-20T19:54Z,"Awesome video and sound quality. Movie is hilarious. Has almost all ending credits, although not required to see them for the movie to make sense, just funny to watch. 

IMO:
A: 10
V: 10

Thanks AiTB!"
,sandite5,2009-07-25T10:01Z,"*****HASH IS TRACKED BY WARNER BROS*****

Just FYI, I got hit up by my ISP that I ""infringed"" on their copy-written product and must delete it....

Pisses me off as I was using uTorrents ""Encryption"" option and still managed to get nabbed.

Oh well.  I'm taking this movie with me to Iraq, so they can kiss my ass."

,x-y1p33y0-x,2009-08-14T10:33Z,"Saying 10/10 is DVD quality, this torrent would be:

V-9
A-8

Its almost as good as a DVD quality. And I burned it and watched it on a big tv and there didnt seem to be anything out of sync. It was a great movie too!!!"
,dirtmerchantHD,2009-08-18T13:47Z,Beware downloading this torrent.  Warner Bros. is tracking this. I got a letter in the mail yesterday from my ISP threatening to cut off my service if i dont quit it.
,fatality54,2010-02-12T05:58Z,Good movie great quality the only thing that bothers me is the ARS icon poppin up in the bottom right corner like every 5 min. its nothin big but it get annoying sometimes
