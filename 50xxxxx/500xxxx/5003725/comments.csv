,bbutton1,2009-09-02T23:32Z,I've uploaded 300gb and finally got this great upload xD
,b6f6Lb4u,2011-02-06T19:40Z,"Get the textless opening and fixed episodes from this torrent.
Get the other videos from the ""Dragon Ball - UNCUT - Episodes 001-153 [Japanese/English Audio,"" torrent : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3728679
It has more seeds & peers ! Releasing all episodes was a mistake imo but thanks for sharing the fixed versions !"
,x0myheart0x,2011-05-06T01:49Z,"I don't think it's a mistake to release all episodes at once. 
It's retarded to have to download each season at a time -.-"
,ATP-Studios,2011-05-12T05:12Z,"Ya I agree people are stupid, all in one is so much better especially considering that all the files will be the same. Are these the Funimation remastered versions? the blue bricked looking dvd sets that were released as seasons?"
,rockpetrus,2011-09-22T20:05Z,"I'm seeding, please do so as well guys! At this downlod rate I'll be able to see all episodes at the age of 80. Please!?"
,rockpetrus,2011-09-26T18:23Z,"Thank You, absolutely great!"
,b6f6Lb4u,2012-03-03T15:10Z,"x0myheart0x & ATP-Studios,
You guys got it all wrong. It's a mistake because this torrent has only 4 seeders and 5 leechers when the other has 57 and 126 ! To sum things up only the fixed videos should have been released. Instead this torrent is a real jungle."
,b6f6Lb4u,2012-03-03T15:14Z,"By the way the following file is missing :
[a-s]_dragon_ball_-_154_-_textless_ending__rs2_[435C144F].mkv

There's the opening but not the ending. You can find it on eDonkey/Kad. Enjoy and thanks for sharing !"
