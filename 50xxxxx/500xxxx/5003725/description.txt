This is just like the torrent on BTJunkie, except this one has all the fixed episodes up to date. And this is a very high quality release by the way. CRC check screenshots included, MD5 included for the paranoid :b (two certain people can both win the lottery, can't they?)

The fixed episodes are: 10,18,38,62,82,91,116,124,138,140,143. You might want to download the rest from BTJunkie's torrent because I'm on 1M. Enjoy!
