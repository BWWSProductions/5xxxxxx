The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien - June 4, 2009

Conan does foley on the Universal lot, poorly.
The macabre Glen Campbell mugshot presides.
We witness the creation of a Conan's Tabloid Moment. (The LA sun demands some getting use to.)

Guests: the Oscar-winning actress/mother/wife-of-a-celebrity-musician Gwyneth Paltrow who continues, in the sequel, the role she played in the blockbuster Iron Man, the comic Joel McHale, host of The Soup (a comical review of entertainment news), and the superb singer/guitarist John Mayer, his trio (plus young choir!) rendering a swinging rock version of California Dreamin' (love the guitar solo, and if you look in the background, the kids seem to enjoy it too).

Note
A public release of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon could not be found for this date.
