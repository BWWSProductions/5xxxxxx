Want to watch on the big screen?

Here are few ways to do that:


1) Use an Apple AV cable with your iPod device.  Check the description to make sure the cable works with your iPod.  I don't recommend the old iPod photo cable as it doesn't come with a charger device also.  The other 2 cables let you charge your iPod while watching TV so that your battery doesn't die midway ;-)

4) Play using your Xbox 360 or PS3 either by hooking a USB device to your console or streaming the media to it using software such as TVersity or uShare for Linux.
