,ciscoman,2009-07-15T06:41Z,here we go as usual...lets wait 2 days for the proper size...not all of us have great download limits to do these size files...sure someone else will upload proper size anyway

,icelaw,2009-07-15T10:13Z,"The proper size is this, the old 350mb is super-low quality, so High-Def is much better.
EZTV is not the only uploader, so you can look for the video on another site...

And by the way EZTV, thanks for uploading!."
,zen-TAO,2009-07-15T10:33Z,"Thanks,
but I will go for the smaller file.
Sure, eztv is not the only one,
but you always know what you get!"
,Lenny9,2009-07-15T15:52Z,"350mb LowRes rips are crap, so this is the proper one. If anything, it should be even 2gigs per episode, to get rid of all those compression artefacts!
So thank you very much 'eztv'!"
,Alex460,2009-07-15T20:35Z,"@ciscoman: When you say ""proper"" you mean sub-480p resolution - check the specs on the FQM release, it's 624x352 - whereas these HD releases are true 720p."
,shaden666,2009-08-03T03:53Z,mkv file? wtf?eztv this is a first.i will no longer seed any files for eztv because they post useless file formats like this one.go choke on a dick eztv
,Cederoo,2009-08-09T21:00Z,Thanks very much for high quality upload it is much appreciated!
,maxfilmy,2009-08-13T14:14Z,mkv is the best format dummie..
,gskrillz,2009-09-02T06:49Z,"@shaden666: probably one of the dumber things I have ever read. thanks for the laughs fucktard. thank you EZTV for providing both standard definition (.avi) and high definition (.mkv) for our differing needs. Please pay no mind to people that can't fathom that difference, or just to busy ""choking on dicks"" to do a simple search on google. "
