,BlackEchoes,2009-07-23T21:27Z,"You have a Freddie Mercury Albums
I know that in Solo Collection 11 CDs.
I listen 10 CDs, but 11cd I don't listen
You have this? Thanks."
,BondClint,2009-07-24T12:03Z,"To BlackEchoes:

I have the 10cd solo collection, and these cds too of Freddie Mercury:

Love Kills Single (2006)
Lover of Life, Singer of Songs (2CDs)
Mr. Sad Guy
Remixes (1993)
The Freddie Mercury Album (1992)

CD 11 which you asked me about could be one of these but i don't kno which it could be, it's title or a link of it on the internet could be helpful for me to see which one is CD11

The solo collection was released as a 10CD & 2 DVDs, maybe CD 11 could be the dvd which includes the documentary, 
I don't know about CD 11. But that's my entire collection of Freddie's solo."
,BlackEchoes,2009-07-24T22:07Z,"Ok, I understand - this 11dvd . Plese, if you can, seed this 11 dvd. Thanks. "
,BondClint,2009-07-26T12:31Z,"To BlackEchoes:
Sorry I don't upload DVDs, they're very big for me to upload, even if I compress them to 4.36, it takes me days to upload an album, so if I upload a DVD it would take weeks or months, lots of my time and the downloaders would get upset and cancel it. However the DVD was also re-released in 2006, with better sound and picture quality, there's also another DVD with his solo videos.

These DVDs are called Lover of Life singer of songs.

DVD 1 - The Documentary about Freddie Mercury

DVD 2 - His solo videos"
