|  â€œConstellationsâ€ is heavier, more technical, faster and more diverse      |
|  than any August Burns Red album to come out yet. I was managing my        |
|  expectations when August Burns Red announced â€œConstellationsâ€ because I   |
|  loved â€œMessengersâ€, I didnâ€™t know if they could pull it off twice in a    |
|  row. Well, call me Doubting Thomas, because they not only met my          |
|  expectations they blew them out of the water. August Burns Red has        |
|  progressed into one of the finest Metal bands today.                      |
|                                                                            |
|  Jake has a very similar guttural scream that he did on â€œMessengersâ€, but  |
|  with more range in â€œConstellationsâ€. As you listen to this CD you will    |
|  discover Jakeâ€™s talent and range and how it fits perfectly in with the    |
|  metal riffs, solos, heart-pounding drums, and ABRâ€™s signature             |
|  breakdowns. Speaking of the breakdowns, they are faster and more complex  |
|  than any previous ABR projects. I found myself being captured by the      |
|  breakdowns, they are catchy, groovy and just flat out epic. Through out   |
|  â€œConstellationsâ€ you will be surprised and excited by the diversity this  |
|  band offers, especially in the building up of a song. And speaking of     |
|  building up, that is one thing August Burns Red has perfected - the art   |
|  of climax. They do this by creating a series of unexpected events - they  |
|  will tone the tempo of a song down, throw in piano, bring out a guitar    |
|  melting solo, and yes, they will even sing. That is why this is August    |
|  Burns Redâ€™s most diverse and most promising album to date.                |
|                                                                            |
|  On the lyrical side of life, it seems as though ABR has brought it up a   |
|  notch - each song is poetic and uses analogies and metaphors to describe  |
|  an experience or a struggle we face daily. An example of this is from     |
|  the song â€œThirty and Sevenâ€. â€œWhat will you become, what will become of   |
|  you. Your mind is the mountain before you. Youâ€™ve reached the summit,     |
|  now transcend the skies.â€ From the song â€œThe Escape Artistâ€ there is a    |
|  line Jake screams â€œyour mouth is like a grenadeâ€. These are just a        |
|  couple of examples to wet your appetite.                                  |
|                                                                            |
|  â€œMetalâ€ has been assaulted by a variety of variations over the year, but  |
|  one thing ABR does that no other band has is keeping â€œMetalâ€ original     |
|  and not falling in with the fad that has seemed to take over the metal    |
|  genre. Know this: August Burns Red has created an Epic piece of music     |
|  that will take metal to a whole new level. You will not be disappointed.  |
|                                                                            |
|                                     |
|                                                                            |
