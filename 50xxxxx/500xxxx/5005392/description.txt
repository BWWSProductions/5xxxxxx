Patricia Ford PFML Collection
*****************************

Patricia Ford is a model that was very active in the 1990's.  This was when the internet was getting popular and back then there weren't that many babes that you see nowadays on here.  I had a big crush on her big time back then, as i'm sure a lot of us did.  

Bio:

Patricia Ford (born March 17, 1969 in Honolulu, Hawaii) is a popular American model of multi-ethnic ancestry (German, Irish, Chinese, Portuguese and Hawaiian). She is best known for modeling for Playboy's Special Editions, but has also posed for erotic photographer Suze Randall and various swimsuit and lingerie catalogues. Ford has also worked as an actress and had bit parts in Play It To the Bone (1999, with Antonio Banderas) and Biggles: Adventures in Time (1986, with Peter Cushing). There are numerous websites devoted to her by her fans, and the PFML (Patricia Ford Mailing List) was created in the mid 1990s to compile all known photos of her.
