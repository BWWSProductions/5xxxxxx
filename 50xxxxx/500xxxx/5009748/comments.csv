,redmoose,2009-07-18T15:09Z,This has the stank of a fake.
,kolddayz,2009-07-18T15:09Z,"why is that?

Why are people always complaining, and never say thanks ??
"
,Voiceman1,2009-07-18T15:25Z,Because anonymous posts with multiple files are usually fakes & spam.
,kolddayz,2009-07-18T15:27Z,"Trust me, this is just an scene release.

I checked .sfv file for possible corruption -> none
unpacked it -> working

Look up the internet and try to find out what an scene release is.. It's ALWAYS packed with rar.

the unpacked 1 file torrents are usually unpacked  scene releases and scammers. They act like they uploaded it and created it. But in fact they stole to get some credits.

Anyhow, this release is working. "
,kolddayz,2009-07-18T17:51Z,did you expect something else? ;)
,Eudamon,2009-07-18T17:57Z,"Yup, seems to be Dollhouse. I haven't watched it yet, but it seems to be the real deal.  I randomly checked a few scenes."
,clockwor,2009-07-18T18:51Z,"Cheers Its defo not Ep 13 but it is the unaired pilot only available on the blu ray or dvd box set
cannot wait to see how it all started"
,kolddayz,2009-07-18T19:02Z,"@clockwor

This is the 13th ep, not aired, only on DVD.

The S01E00 is the original unaired pilot ;)"
,aliasme,2009-07-18T19:45Z,"works fine Not fake. 

Excellent episode."
,chaoticnature,2009-07-18T19:45Z,Where can I find the S01E00 is the original unaired pilot?

,oos11,2009-07-18T23:37Z,Thank you very much!
,capitanqueso,2009-07-19T04:16Z,Where can I find original english subtitles to translate to spanish?
,indeldude,2009-07-20T23:39Z,"Yup, this is real. But any chance of getting a HD (720p) rip of it?"
,zezzer,2009-07-21T18:18Z,Thanks in advance
,jimmystol,2009-07-21T20:48Z,ep 13 is due to air in UK in HD in 3 weeks time.
,indeldude,2009-07-21T22:26Z,"@jimmystol The blu-ray of it comes out next week. Figured if this came out early, why not a HD copy."
,t2BeDLaM,2009-07-25T03:04Z,"its dollhouse alright!
The beginning will throw you, but keep watching!
didnt care for this episode though as it went away from the original story line by jumping into the future.
Also, helps denote the fact that dollhouse will no longer be carried out in any new seasons.

Shame cause it wasnt a bad show.
Joss Weadon has some decent shows. too bad this one wont carry on."
,styleaddicted,2009-07-26T11:42Z,not fake. good quality. but the episode stinks! so disappointed!
,sdamon,2009-07-28T14:57Z,"http://www.fox.com/programming/

Rumors of Dollhouse's death have been greatly exaggerated.

http://www.tvguide.com/news/dollhouse-premiere-delay-1007823.aspx

Dollhouse will return on Friday, Sept. 25th"
,ZenRhino,2009-07-28T16:17Z,"The DVD for season 1 just came out - so these ""extras"" like the unaired pilot, commentary, deleted scenes, etc have now become available... chill pickle & just say thanks for the people providing them, k? 

BTW... thanks!! :)"
,kev121282,2009-07-30T04:34Z,"Great episode. The most suspenseful by far.
I think it carries on the storyline excellently too.
Can't wait for September.

btw who gave it a -1 ???

Thanks for the upload, great quality."
[T],Atilla82,2009-07-30T14:47Z,"thanks, works fine for me, and it is episode 13.  Why do you people comment if you didn't watch it?"
,Arkngt,2009-08-01T01:42Z,"So many morons. It's actually painful to read many of the comments here. It's as if I get brief flashes into the minds of complete idiots. 

Anyway, thanks for the up!"
,isisx3,2009-08-05T00:21Z,"i really wish it wasn't all .rar-ed up...

but thanks anyway."
,DrunkPollock,2009-08-12T18:21Z,This is epitaph one?
,Twindz,2009-08-13T07:16Z,great episode.. strange how it's the unaired pilot.. makes you wonder what season 2 is going to be like
,ascdsu,2009-08-16T14:11Z,Is there any torrent with a 720p+ BluRay rip of this episode (and the unaired pilot)?
,newzbin,2009-09-19T04:28Z,"@kolddayz
there is an error in your link for S01E00, it starts with https://thepiratebay.org and it does not load.
here is the correct link

,qpwoeiru,2010-02-03T15:49Z,"I hate RAR torrents.
WTF so annoying, extra steps to view, then have to keep 2x the data sitting around to seed the RAR while watching the video."
,Murdoc2k,2010-06-21T06:12Z,Thank you for the upload! I've been looking for this!
,fuckfrank,2011-05-16T10:03Z,"Ugh. Why do people split torrents into multiple files, it's utterly pointless."
,jadicction,2012-04-17T04:00Z,How do i play a file like this??
