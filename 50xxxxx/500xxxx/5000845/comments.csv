                                 Plot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a retired Polish American Ford automobile 
assembly line worker and Korean War veteran, haunted by memories of that 
conflict, lives with his Labrador Retriever Daisy in a changing Highland Park, 
Michigan neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants. At the start of the 
movie, Walt is attending his wife's funeral, bristling at the shallow eulogy of 
young Father Janovich (Christopher Carley). Similarly, he has little patience 
with his two sons, Mitch (Brian Haley) and Steve (Brian Howe), and their 
families, who show little regard for Walt's grief or the memory of their dead 
mother. Throughout the movie Walt views his relatives as rude, spoiled and 
self-absorbed, always avoiding him unless it is in their own interest to pay him 
some attention. Walt's sons see him as ""always disappointed"" with them and their 
families, unaware of their own obnoxiousness...

,demoraze,2010-11-17T11:17Z,"You made an .ISO file from a DVD xvid rip?
That's a new one.

If you ripped a DVD to an .ISO then your format is actually MPEG-2, which means VOB files.

Thanks for the share."
