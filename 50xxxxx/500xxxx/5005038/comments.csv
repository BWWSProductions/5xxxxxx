[T],matreshka4u,2009-07-19T06:39Z,"you are not stuck, i'm seeding,and you will have it in a day or two, but i told you, people, don't cry about low speed, you will have it anyway, for i will not start big torrents so as not to have negative reaction."

,kerouac1,2009-07-21T00:46Z,"Matreshka4u,

I would be grateful if you could reseed an old upload - 50 Composers. I'm at 87% and will gladly seed later. Many thanks for this. "
[T],matreshka4u,2009-07-21T01:39Z," to kerouac1:
re-seeded composers for you."
,kerouac1,2009-07-21T03:32Z,Thank you! Russia? Good English BTW. You must know as Americans we need all the culture we can get.
[T],matreshka4u,2009-07-21T05:26Z,"yes, i'm a russian woman, but i don't devide cultures. all our cultures are great.. russian music and classical literature are splendid aslo. but world-wide 'treasures' are for all of us without boundaries. we are the world... we are the children... that's why i like sharing what i have for my pleasure in my life.. "
,kerouac1,2009-07-21T08:33Z,And I am an American man of French and Lithuanian descent. I believe the internet is tearing down the walls between us.  We are learning we are not so different. It offers us a chance to share the best we have to give of ourselves with each other.
