This is an audiobook version of Kevin Carson's essay "The Iron Fist Behind the Invisible Hand: Corporate Capitalism as a State-Guaranteed System of Privilege"  read by Mike Gogulski of nostate.com.


Reader's Introduction:

Good morning, left-libertarian.

The voice you will hear for the next 88 minutes or so belongs to me, Mike Gogulski.

I am a stateless ex-American. I renounced my American citizenship in 2008 and I have been a voluntary exile since 2004, presently living in Bratislava, Slovakia. As of this recording in June 2009, I maintain a website at www.nostate.com, which you are invited to visit.

The words you will hear belong to all of humanity, but they were written by Kevin Carson, a leading contemporary thinker in mutualism and individualist anarchism, and Research Associate for the Center for a Stateless Society, c4ss.org. The essay, The Iron Fist Behind the Invisible Hand: Corporate Capitalism as a State-Guaranteed System of Privilege, was published in 2001, and is available online at Carsonâ€™s Mutualist Blog, from flag.blackened.net, and from Red Lion Press in print form.

For the recording, I have broken the essay into ten parts:

    * Introduction
    * The Subsidy of History
    * Ideological Hegemony
    * The Money Monopoly
    * Patents
    * Infrastructure
    * Military Keynesianism
    * Other Subsidies
    * Political Repression
    * Conclusion

I have attempted to read the text of Iron Fist as I have it in hand. Any deviations from the written text are my own.

It is worth noting for more mainstream libertarians and others not familiar with Carsonâ€™s work that one need not adopt Carsonâ€™s mutualism or his predictions regarding profit, rent and interest in a truly free market in order to find the analysis and historiography contained here of great value.
