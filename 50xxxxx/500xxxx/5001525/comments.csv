I haven't read / listened yet, but I would hazard a guess that Mr. Carson is much like many of the Utopian libertarians; describing a world that is beyond human nature. A stateless world may well be where man is headed in centuries to come, but his failure to properly implement even the comparably simple concept of tolerant democracy tells me this will be a long time coming."
,Dr_Q,2009-07-17T02:58Z,"How could a ""tolerant democracy"" ever be implemented? Democracy is a form of statism and statism is violence. The reason there is no such thing as a ""tolerant democracy"" is because any system of violence will always be co-opted by special interests.

The entire point of government is to act as a mechanism that allows some people (the political class) to live off of productive people and the democratic state is no exception.

Anarchy is based on the concept of radical equality. Not equality in the socioeconomic sense, but in the sense that all people should be allowed the same rights as one another. Only then can people be free from arbitrary rules that allow some people to live off the labor of others."

Human beings exist in a material universe, and thus liberty without owning one's self and the consequences of one's actions (i.e. capital) is a logical impossibility!"
