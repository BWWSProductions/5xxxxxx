Phil Manzanera had no problem filling his mid-'70s downtime away from Roxy 
Music. His guitar graced some 20 albums, like John Cale's Fear, Eno's Here 
Come the Warm Jets, and Nico's The End. This outing from his all-star side 
group is slicker than his 1976 live debut album, but no less worthwhile; some 
16 musicians are credited. The sound is sleek and sophisticated; even lyrics 
aren't exempt from creative twists, as shown on "Listen Now"'s glistening 
jazz-pop -- which cleverly juxtaposes its title against a bouncy "now, now, 
listen" chorus. The song also questions how people are living life in a 
repressive society, even as "Law and Order" and "City of Lights" ponder its 
breakdown. Other songs visit more personal turf. "Flight 19" details a young 
man's angst-filled reaction to his lover's injuries, "Postcard Love" dismisses 
the perils of on-road romances, and "That Falling Feeling" takes a more 
wistful look at how people grow apart -- over a gliding Manzanera guitar part. 
(Yet another sly twist shifts the chorus from "Can't you feel it moving in?" to 
"You can feel it moving in.") Three totally different instrumentals round out 
matters. The best one is the lilting "Island," anchored by a climbing Bill 
McCormick bassline, as Manzanera unleashes his full array of guitar-altering 
devices. "Initial Speed" and "Que?" take more of a jazz/fusion tack; they're 
different snapshots of Manzanera's graceful, intelligent guitar style. This 
album's one of the most absorbing entries of Manzanera's lengthy career. ~
