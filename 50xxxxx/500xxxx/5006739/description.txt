Unfortunately, the games are compatible ONLY with PSP SLIMs (models 2000+) as it uses their additional memory. If you run it on an old PSP model, the game will crash after 5-10 minutes. I present you a PSP port of one of the best and classic RPG games all-around: ULTIMA VII. It is based on an open-source engine EXULT.

This pack consists of:

1. Ultima 7 (part one): The Black Gate + Forge of Virtue expansion pack.
2. Ultima 7 (part two): The Serpent Isle + Silver Steed expansion pack.
3. Complete set of original documentation, books, maps and journals in PDF format.
4. BOOKR - a PDF/TXT reading tool for the PSP so you can read all the necessary game literature while on the go.

Journals, Maps and Docs:
--------------------------

Ultima 7 consists of two parts - The Black Gate and The Serpent Isle and should be played in that order. Start Serpent Isle only after you're done with The Black Gate as this is a direct continuation of the story. Like I mentioned already, back in the day, all the grand games came with several pages long manuals that contained various novels/journals that explained the detailed storylines to further immerse you in the game.
In this release I included all scanned docs for your pleasure. These lectures are obligatory BEFORE playing the game.

A) The Black Gate

- The Book of Fellowship.pdf (necessary read before you start the actual game, is also required to properly answer several in-game questions)
- Isle of Fire Journal (optional read if you plan to visit the Isle of Fire in the game)
- Map (required to properly answer several in-game questions)
- Mapref.pdf (required to properly answer several in-game questions)
- Answers.txt (for these people who want it the easy way, NOT RECOMMENDED as it takes away from the experience)

B) The Serpent Isle

- Journal.pdf (necessary read before you start the actual game, is also required to properly answer several in-game questions)
- Map.pdf (required to properly answer several in-game questions)
- Map ref.pdf (required to properly answer several in-game questions)
- Walkthrough.pdf (for these people who want it the easy way, NOT RECOMMENDED as it takes away from the experience)
