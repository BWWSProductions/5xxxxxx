Mega Man was created by a scientist named Dr. Light, who hoped his creation would only be used for good. But a mad scientist named Dr. Wily stole the creation plans and a few of Dr. Light's other robots, named Guts Man, Cut Man, Ice Man, and various others which he reprogramed for evil. Each had a special power; But Dr. Light gave Mega Man the ultimate trump card when he built him. That meant whenever Mega Man defeated one of these evil robots he would attain their powers for use it good as he was programed for. Mega Man and his trusty canine sidekick, Rush, would fight the evil robots, and occasionally they'd be joined by Mega Man's sister, Roll.
But Dr. Wily also stole one other robot... Mega Man's older brother Proto Man, who is now only interested in wiping his brother off of the face of the earth.
