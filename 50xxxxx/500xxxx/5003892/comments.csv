Is there any chance to upload Superman 650-680 & Action Comics 837-870?"
,ExAzrael,2009-10-08T09:59Z,"This torrent was great, up until rage of the red lanterns. Three of the four files wouldn't open due to invalid file names. And I don't have the ability to rename them. All the ones that say (two covers) or (three covers) don't open. This is very disappointing. :("

I second his comment please make a fix. Trying to search other torrents for the working version of the messed up files and it is becoming a major pain in the ass."
,DCPTKON,2010-05-21T13:32Z,"Ah, Thank you. I for some reason had only up to #25 of v4 Green Lantern, I've been wondering what went on between 26 and 42."
,jeffabe3,2011-11-06T05:37Z,Thank you for this one. I wanted to start reading Green Lantern comics and this will surely help. All minutemen scans.
