To celebrate the start of Blackest Night, the Minutemen are proud to present, for the first time, a complete run of MM edits of GL v4 (through GL 43) and GLC v2 (through GLC 38) complete with extras like Tales of the Sinestro Corps, Blackest Night 0, and Green Lantern Secret Files and Origins 2005.

Happy Blackest Night day!
