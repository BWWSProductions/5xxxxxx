battleaxe230."
,battleaxe230,2009-07-18T10:57Z,reporting this is USELESS its not an ISO and ITS NOT BOOTABLE@@!!!!
,stevenching,2009-07-18T10:57Z,anyone can confirm this is the real thing? or maybe real iso file?
,battleaxe230,2009-07-18T10:58Z,see my message lol
,stevenching,2009-07-18T11:08Z,i bet there is a method to make it a iso?
,RedSaint,2009-07-18T11:52Z,"You can make this bootable by using OSCDIMG. I made this bootable by using the following command, replacing of course the paths with ones fitting my own computer:

oscdimg -n -m -bc:\efi-dvd\boot\etfsboot.com c:\efi-dvd c:\efi-iso\server2008dvd.iso

The article about it can be found here:
http://blog.aproductofsociety.org/?p=13

I got it to boot inside Virtual PC 2007, but as that piece of software doesn't support 64-bit emulation, I only the message that it had encountered a problem loading. But it did load instead of giving me a ""Code 5"" or some other BS."
,RedSaint,2009-07-18T11:57Z,"Great, didn't see that this was the 32-bit I was commenting on :) What I described should still work, so good luck. The resulting image can be burned with IMGBURN or other burning software of your choosing."
,stevenching,2009-07-18T13:03Z,"@redsaint
thx for the comment. :) have a nice day"
,stevenching,2009-07-18T13:50Z,then anyone can link a full thread of instruction to create an .iso from these files?

,bervik,2009-07-18T20:50Z,there's no cd key yet!!!!
,Z_Pirate,2009-07-18T22:04Z,"Yeh, since un-rar'ed this isn't a .iso I'm at a bit of a loss.  Using XP, can't seem to find anyway to make it bootable. "
,ahensen,2009-07-19T01:15Z,can someone invite me to demonoid? 
,stevenching,2009-07-19T05:36Z,"@svipdrood
the problem is the extracted file is not in iso format. fyi. i am not a computer nerd/noob. the extracted content is the content that should be inside the .iso file. hint. use imgburn to compile it and retrieve the bootimg from win vista. i shld boot proper.

i have compiled this into an .iso file and i have installed successfully yesterday. no time bomb. but no working/beta keys can be used for this copy of windows 7."
,Z_Pirate,2009-07-19T11:55Z,"Thought I'd just say thanks for the upload, although I didn't bother burning it, running the setup works great."
,hadder,2009-07-19T14:36Z,"right i suppose we are all out of here, any one got an invite for me to demonoid, thanks , mistergrehan@hotmail.com, its been fun."
,stelios59,2009-07-19T18:15Z,"thank's for the upload!
i've sent the  invitation  wavethunder is pleading for hope he thanks in return!"
,stevenching,2009-07-20T14:45Z,basically just use imgburn. extracted the bootimage from vista sp1.iso . used it on the files downloaded here. make/compile it into .iso. tried booting. works 100% :)
