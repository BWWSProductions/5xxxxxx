,SmoothWeiner,2009-07-15T23:33Z,Does this include the proof that global warming is a global scam?  Or does it like all the treehuggers leave out that information.
,VeganFreak,2009-07-19T00:29Z,"For a 2009 ""complete"" publication on global warming, I'm rather surprised that there's no mention of ""global dimming"" at all. Or that animal agriculture contributes more greenhouse gas emissions than all transportation, as per research by the UN FAO a couple years ago. Would be nice to see scientific theories and research on how lifestyle changes could possibly change the big picture, instead of most humans among billions of other humans thinking they are too small to make a difference in the big picture.

Updated and leading relevant research should have been included in this publication imho (as mentioned above), but the author did cite the Garden of Eden, so perhaps Mr. Hughton is concerned about how this ties into a faith-based belief system? jesusveg.com

Good upload anyhow, a fair amount of older scientific research is in this, but maybe not enough to satisfy the full thirst of global warming research junkies. Thanks malestrom!"
,fruit_berry_boom,2009-07-23T15:01Z,"For a more updated look on the climate science, see for example these:

""Climate Safety - In case of emergency..."", Public Interest Research Centre, 25th November 2008, http://climatesafety.org/downloads/climatesafety.pdf

David Spratt & Philip Sutton: Climate Code Red: The Case For Emergency Action (Scribe, 2008) - If someone could upload this it would be great. Apparently it would need to be scanned, though, no ebook available.

Fred Pearce's climate change books are also great: ""The Last Generation: How nature will take her revenge for climate change"" and ""With Speed and Violence: why Scientists Fear Tipping Points In Climate Change"". If someone could upload these it would be also great!

For the skeptics, check this out: A 188-page debunking of all the bullshit in the ""documentary"" The Great Global Warming Swindle (or the documentaries - there are at least four versions of it, since the producers had to change it after it was obvious that it includes outright lies, such as the claim that volcanic activity produces more greenhouse gases than industry, or fake graphs): 

Nathan Rive, Dr Brian Jackson, Dave Rado et al: Complaint to Ofcom Regarding ?The Great Global Warming Swindle?, (11.6.2007), http://www.ofcomswindlecomplaint.net

Thank you very much."
