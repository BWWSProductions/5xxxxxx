Release Notes:

The Charm City Devils have a sound that is reminiscent of AC/DC meets Aerosmith. Their raw and exciting sound captures the excitement of early Motley Crue with Bon Scott like vocals infused with hook laden riffs. The Charm City Devils deliver a power packed punch of songs that have a bluesy twist with razor sharp vocals and hard driving guitar riffs that cut like a knife.
