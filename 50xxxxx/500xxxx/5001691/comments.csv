Hey Dipshit ... this is an AVI file ... compressed format for faster downloads ... Once you re-encode back to DVD format (ConvertX  etc  etc) it will be at least a few gigs or so. Have you never downloaded and converted an AVI before .. It happens all the time. Many ""FULL"" movies are only 700 MB ... yet once you convert and burn it ..... it fills up your DVD. The 3 + GB file you refer to is an already converted DVDR ... why would you waste the time downloading 3 Gigs ... when in 1/10 the time, you could download an AVI and convert it yourself. Is this your first day on the ""pirate"" job. Movie Pirating 101 at your local community college!! Don't even comment if you don't know WTF you are talking about. How the fuck did you ever get this far ??   Wow !!"
