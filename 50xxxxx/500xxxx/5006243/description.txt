                 Michael Jackson's "Pepsi Commercial Hair Accident"



How Michael Jackson's pill addiction began. 

Never-before-seen footage of Michael Jackson's Pepsi commercial accident, filmed 
in L.A.'s Shrine Auditorium on Jan. 27, 1984, and released on july 15, 2009.

The clip shows one take where the pyrotechnics exploded as planned, after Jackson 
descended the stairs and began performing with his brothers.

On the sixth take, though, things went horribly wrong: The fireworks erupted too 
early, igniting Jackson's head in flames. Jackson is at first unaware he's on 
fire, and continues dancing. 

He was never the same after the accident, reports the new issue of Us Weekly, on 
stands today.

To relieve the second and third-degree burns on his scalp and body (and later to 
help him tolerate multiple surgeries on the scorched spot on his head), Jackson 
was prescribed several medications, which kicked off his addiction to painkillers 
and obsession with plastic surgery, multiple sources tell Us.

Info Wikipedia:



In 1984, Pepsi sponsored The Jacksons' Victory Tour. In return, Michael and his 
brothers were to star in two commercials for the company. Jackson had reworked 
"Billie Jean" for the commercial and entitled it "Pepsi Generation". 

The song was used as the official jingle for the commercials and released as a 
7" promo single. The launch of "The Choice of a New Generation" campaign in 
February 1984 was attended by 1,600 people who were issued with a programme and 
a 7" single. During the filming of the second commercial a firework exploded and 
Jackson's hair caught fire, leaving the singer needing reconstructive surgery.

The commercials were premiered at the Grammy Awards, with Jackson wearing a 
hairpiece to cover his burns as he collected a record eight awards.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of 
    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting 
    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz
    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!
  
08- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

10- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

To the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
