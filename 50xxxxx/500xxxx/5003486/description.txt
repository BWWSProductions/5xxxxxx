well folks, just to reseed here PUBLICLY what i had leeched because in the private tracker noone seems to want it (ratio 0.00)...

about its quality:
i cant well tell: at least in the private tracker-site i found till right NOW NO comment about it: i have just burnt the .iso file to a dvd and still have to let it run...: at a glance in the explorer the content of this burned dvd looks at least plausible: so it could be ok, scanning with AV said it was clean -its just not yet further processed data... (a zip or rar of it would have saved a few mb)
