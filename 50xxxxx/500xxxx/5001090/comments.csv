,dougklohnjr,2009-07-14T03:17Z,come on man! seed it! i want this game :) im stuck at 12mb
[T],TeamPS,2009-07-14T19:06Z,"Asking me to seed will not speed it up. There is only me fully seeding, no-one else has it fully, and there are 257 leechers. Have a bit of patience."
,Llamaman8,2009-07-18T20:26Z,what do leechers do anyways?
,highthe,2009-07-19T19:24Z,"I just started downloading this torrent , at first it was slow then it moves up to almost 200kB/s !! average is 100kB/s . how cool is that"
,highthe,2009-07-19T19:24Z,tyty
[T],TeamPS,2009-07-19T21:48Z,Leechers are the downloaders. There's currently 1158 leechers at the time of me writing this :)
,ja1ck,2009-07-20T01:40Z,"Currently downloading, download speeds seem alright. Will comment when (if) finnished."
,lolilali,2009-07-20T18:59Z,I'm DLing right now 1471 leechers and im seeding as fast as i can xD stuck at 99.5 anyways :/ Hang in there Marsdentech and when were done we will help you seed ^^ 
,ARGmartin,2009-07-20T19:45Z,"Stuck at 99.8% please hang in a bit more so I can start seeding, people deserve more seed lol!"
,Bigrons,2009-07-20T20:53Z,Well I'm stuck on 99.9% and doesn't seem to be moving. Did notice someone with 100% completion then they dissappeares leavin everyone with nothing to download!!
,myrtlewaves252,2009-07-20T21:25Z,"Well, looking at the long list of 99.99% in the peer section of BitTorrent, I'd say we're all missing the same file. If I can manage to get it to 100 I'll seed until this is a healthy torrent again."
,omegaham,2009-07-20T21:43Z,"Almost there. Ten more megabytes or so, and you're done, Marsdentech!"
,ARGmartin,2009-07-20T21:59Z,"Bigrons, remember me from mininova?

Yeah im stuck at 99.9 percent, again! Fuck!"
,ARGmartin,2009-07-20T22:00Z,"And im not missing 10mb, Im missing 1mb, How annoyin is that LOL!"
,Bigrons,2009-07-20T22:03Z,Hi pal yeah i'm gettin well fucked off now!! I thought i'd be playing this tonight but obvioulsy not!!
,ARGmartin,2009-07-20T22:15Z,"Its one package of 4mb, that is not available, this is a great flaw in torrents, since seeders are seeding to leachers that can get all packages from other leachers, instead of leaching people in 99,9 that need that last package"
,Bigrons,2009-07-20T22:17Z,Oh and there is someone else who has the full file and isn't seeding. What a D**k!!
,omegaham,2009-07-20T22:17Z,"Ok, thanks for that. I wish the torrent would give the file to the 99% guys and then let them distribute it.

Does this always happen when there are a large amount of leechers and very few seeders?"
,Bigrons,2009-07-20T22:19Z,"6 available to seed????? Come on guys. 

GET SEEDING!!!!!!"
,omegaham,2009-07-20T22:26Z,"I hate how it's basically a lottery - 1600 leechers, 6 seeders. Who's going to be the lucky guy who gets the 4 MB file? Get your tickets here..."
,ARGmartin,2009-07-20T22:36Z,"I hope to get my ticket soon, Every time there are more 100% on the peers list, but im still not getting any download speed"
,ARGmartin,2009-07-20T22:45Z,"IM finished!!

NOw Seeding!"
,omegaham,2009-07-20T22:49Z,"Looks like it took off. 420 seeds and counting. Thanks a lot, Marsdentech!"
,ARGmartin,2009-07-20T23:16Z,"Well that was strange, from no seeds, everyone stuck, to 430 seed, myself included.

This is gonna be a big jump, I only played Sims 1, so imagine.

Thanks Marsdentech!"
,omegaham,2009-07-20T23:53Z,"Sorry for being a computer-illiterate moron, but can someone help me with this?

I installed it using the generated key, and then after it installed I ran the crack program. But now when I try to run the game, it says, ""We're sorry, but we are unable to verify that this disc is a valid copy."" It then kicks me out. Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks in advance."
,omegaham,2009-07-21T00:01Z,"Never mind, I figured out what I was doing wrong. I forgot to actually move the files to the folder. Sorry for clogging the comments."
,ViceCaptainWatanabe,2009-07-21T01:00Z,"Im not that good with computers, but.. How do you install this thing!? I moved everything to a new folder and tried to run the TS3, but nothing pops up. when i try to run the Sims3 thing, it opens a CD burner. Im probably being totally stupid, but i'd really want to know since it took 48 hours to download. :/"
[T],TeamPS,2009-07-21T01:04Z,"Burn or mount the ISO, then install. After installing, copy the cracked files into C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin

It should then work."
,ViceCaptainWatanabe,2009-07-21T01:13Z,"oh okay thank you~ sorry, im one of those people who BUY the games.. except now i dont get allowence so...."
,Llamaman8,2009-07-21T01:31Z,"i copied the crack files into C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin and it still says that i need a disk, is there somethign else i need to do?"
,josuemc,2009-07-21T01:50Z,"i have no idea at all how to install this... can someone please help me? i have peazip and IZarc

and iam trying to extract the file but i cant directly get to the key or crack without the applications and when i try to open them, they dont open, the applications act like they are extracting them."
,highthe,2009-07-21T08:04Z,"it says u need the sims 3 disc , in the sims 3 launcher . then i moved the crack to the Bin in program files . and start the TS3 file in the crack folder but it didnt open . then i opened the other TS3 which was in the Bin folder itself . it started okay . full screen and all ... then ""disc not inserted"" :/ what am i doing wrong ."
,highthe,2009-07-21T10:17Z,nvm . i figured it out already . thanks alot . the game works perfectly . seeding . tytyty
[T],TeamPS,2009-07-21T10:26Z,"OK. Anyways I added the FULL INSTALL GUIDE in the torrent description, just copy and paste it into the readme if you want, but you don't have to."
,ja1ck,2009-07-21T19:31Z,"finnished downloading this last night. game works a charm, not noticed any glitches yet. awesome upload, thanks very much MARSDENTECH :)

definitely worth the download!"
,Llamaman8,2009-07-22T19:23Z,"i just updated the game and now it says that i need a disk, the crack is still where its supposed to be and its still mounted"
,Llamaman8,2009-07-22T19:26Z,nvm i mounted it but when i go to My Computer and look at the F Drive nothing is there
,Hellraiser6,2009-07-23T19:04Z,"The game saids: we're not sure if this is a legal CD .. so can anyone help me,please? "
,Bawlern,2009-07-24T03:00Z,Can anybody tell me how to mount files?
,emma3221,2009-07-24T07:20Z,"I downloaded all of the files and I thought that I could figure out how to install it, but for some reason I am having A LOT of trouble figuring all of this out. I'm really really confused.

Do you absolutely need a disk to make this game work? I tried to burn the iso onto a disc and apparently there was not enough space, and I'm not exactly sure what files I needed to burn onto the disc in the first place. 

I know there were directions, but I'm confused!!

I usually buy all of my games...help? "
,gingersnap21,2009-07-25T21:12Z,"Everything works great except for the download manager. When it downloads the latest patches it gets to 97% then says invalid file or something, but other than that game works flawlessly. Any help would be appreciated. TY MARS"
,kitty132,2009-07-27T03:18Z,"Thanks, it really works!
If it help:
I extract the file with winrar.
mount the iso file in a virtual drive.(I use power iso)
Than look for it in - computer - than open the drive loaded with sims 3
 - than it star to install.
 -when it ask for serial you use the keigen.
 -after it install (don't let the game begin) first you copy whats inside  the crack file (the 2 items) and paste it in C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin.
Now you can play!! Have fun!!"
,Hellraiser6,2009-07-28T01:42Z,"ok now it works thanks to kitty :D
I installed daemon tools and it didn't work when I installed power iso it just went fine so..
Thanks to kitty and it didn't work at all without MARSDENTECH!
Nice torrent, Thanks.."
,melinda_d,2009-07-31T01:25Z,"Ok I'm going to say this:

IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE .iso FILES, MOUNTING A DISK AND COMPRESSION - DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS OR ANY OTHER PROGRAM OFF PB UNTIL YOU LEAR HOW TO USE A COMPUTER!!!!!!!!"
,jesusismyairbag,2009-08-02T14:17Z,"oh thanks, very fast download @ 240-300 kb/s average. great torrent, faster than the other ones. thank you very much MarsdenTech."
[T],TeamPS,2009-08-02T15:10Z,*sigh* it's MARSDENTECH lol...
,jeff-ffej,2009-08-03T22:00Z,after trying about 25-30 u/loads i finally found this one and yes it works a treat.Now my misses will be quiet so thanks from me and thanks from misses.wicked
[T],TeamPS,2009-08-04T02:45Z,Another happy customer lol
,cabootje,2009-08-08T02:23Z,"@ jeff-ffej i know what you mean haha, my girlfriend was like weeks busy, honeyy i want sims 3.. so now finally she can play

TY MARSDENTECH"
,jeff-ffej,2009-08-08T22:49Z,"cabootje/ SIMS 3 will give us proper gamers a few extra hours killin time lol,   respect                         "
[T],TeamPS,2009-08-09T21:20Z,No worries ;-)
,JenniLee,2009-08-20T07:32Z,"For those of you who do not know how to mount, don't listen to those assholes. It probably took them some effort to figure it out at one point too. You download a program (virtual drive program) like Magic Disk or Daemon tools and when you use it it will have an icon on your lower right corner of your screen. Left click and go to your virtual CD/DVD Rom and Mount the file (either full .zip file, .mdf, .iso and etc.). It should be listed in directions. And when you download the virtual drive program is should say what kind of files are compatible. 

Hope this helps... unlike the other faggots on here who think they are something special because they know how to mount but are nothing more than arrogant fucks."
,QuamDC,2009-08-21T05:32Z,is this really worth downloading
,djomlao,2009-08-21T22:49Z,"I have same problem like Llamaman8.

i copied the crack files into C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin and it still says that i need a disk, is there somethign else i need to do? 

Help.
Tnx"
[T],TeamPS,2009-08-22T02:35Z,"Well said JenniLee.

You decide, QuamDC. I would say yes.

Shouldn't really update it, djomlao, as with a lot of cracked stuff on torrent sites. Is the game still mounted?"
,djomlao,2009-08-22T17:33Z,"I did all just like it says in your manual. Burn it, then install it."
,Llamaman8,2009-09-07T01:06Z,i had it installed and mounted and i was playing it but i havent played it for a few weeks and now when i try to play it it says i need a disk and its not mounted to my virtual drive anymore adn it wont mount every time i try to
,reddevi,2009-09-07T07:44Z,"thanks man, it works great!"
,geromanz,2009-09-08T05:36Z,ok this says there is no seeders  please seed :/
,geromanz,2009-09-09T21:05Z,hmm there is no seeders :(  38.1 % done now please i need this game
,princesskaida,2009-10-04T20:59Z,"The game works great, thanks! And I'm seeding too lol but I had a question about the updates, I'm also getting that ""Invalid file found"" message, is it because of the crack that I can't update at all? D:"
,rover101,2009-10-12T22:21Z,"I downloaded it and everything but when I play, my persons stuck in the taxi and buying things makes the game exit, does this happen to anyone else?"
,kiyaquriaee,2009-12-10T13:38Z,I have a problem I almost got finished installing the game but I got an error message before it finished saying CRC error: The file C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims\Game\Bin\da-DK\Sims3Launcer.resources/dll doesn't match the file in the setup's .cab file. Then it goes on to say the medium from which I am running the setup may be corrupted. I usually am pretty good with computers please someone tell me what this means I have been waiting forever to play this game. Thanks in advance!!!
,ImKamile,2010-05-07T22:37Z,"Hey! I see people asking these questions and often the answers are ""copy the cracked files into C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin"". I'm not much of a computer person.
What do you mean by cracked files? Thanks! :)"
