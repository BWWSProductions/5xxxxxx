U2 - Live at Red Rocks (Deluxe DVD)

This is a rip of the main program from the Deluxe DVD, which was a re-release of the original film made in 1983. The only other torrent of this file size available was ripped from VHS and out of sync, hence the need for this one.

This video doesn't have the actual commentary track but you can see what the guy is saying via the subtitles as you listen to the music. Actually a better way of absorbing the commentary if you ask me.
