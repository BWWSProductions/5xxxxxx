Tnx in advance"

You could try Elements upload here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3775928/An.American.Werewolf.In.London.NORDIC.DVDR-elements

That version played fine on my DVD player, although he did a terrible custom menu, which I removed on the DVD disc I burnt out. I haven't got his upload backed up - but I could possibly copy the VIDEO_TS folder from my burnt out disc. That works. 

I uploaded this version from Cinematik because it had more languages."

However, I also had problems playing this in VLC media player on my laptop, it is impossible to get past the ""WARNING"" -screen. But if you're just going to watch this on your computer it is better to download a DVDrip. Alternatively, just play the video_ts files consisting the main movie, the ones around 1GB in size."
