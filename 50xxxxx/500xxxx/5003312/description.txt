From Wiki:


The Quireboys are an English hard rock band formed in 1984 in London, England, with strong ties to Newcastle.[1] When the band formed they were originally known as the London Quireboys [2] in the United States.

The band were successful during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with their debut album "A Bit of What You Fancy" reaching #2 on the UK charts. Their highest charting single for the band was with the song "Hey You", it reached #14.

In 1993, the Quireboys broke up but briefly reformed live in 1995 with different members. A more permanent reformation came in 2001 when front man Spike, guitarist Guy Griffin and bassist Nigel Mogg put together a new line-up. The band is still active, recording new material and playing live.

A vocalist named Jonathan Gray (commonly referred to as just "Spike") moved from Newcastle upon Tyne to London when he was just 17 years old.[3] Spike met guitarist Guy Bailey in a bar, through his older sister Julie, the two moved in together as flat mates, but didn't even discuss playing music until a year later when a friend brought a guitar round and they began playing Chuck Berry songs.

By the mid-1980s the two decided to form a rock and roll band, the name chosen for the group was originally The Choirboys taken from the 1977 movie of the same name, but they soon changed it to the Queerboys. Gray and Bailey were joined by bassist Nigel Mogg (nephew of UFO's Phil Mogg[4]), Chris Johnstone on piano and Paul Hornby who had previously played drums with Pete Burns in the Liverpool group Nightmares in Wax.

The Queerboys started to build up a following, playing at the Marquee Club. The band's drummer Paul Hornby soon left to form Dogs D'Amour, which contained future friends of the Queerboys, he was replaced by Nick Connell (known as Cozy). Connell, Bailey and Johnstone were old friends, having grown up together and attended Alleynes School in Stone, Staffordshire in the '70s. By 1987 the band's controversial name was starting to hinder them, it caused some of the gigs on their tour with Andy McCoy's band to be cancelled. They were also booked to play Reading Festival on the understanding that they would change their name.

Thus they changed it to the Quireboys and have kept the name ever since. They released two singles via Survival Records, entitled "Mayfair" and "There She Goes Again". Another musician from Newcastle was brought in on rhythm guitar, he was named Ginger and made his performing debut at the Hammersmith Odeon where the band were supporting Guns N' Roses. At the end of 1989, the band released the single "7 O'Clock", which entered the UK Top 40 chart.
