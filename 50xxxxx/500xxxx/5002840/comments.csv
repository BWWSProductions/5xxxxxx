,Jasper100,2009-07-19T16:44Z,"keygen here (there is also a crack but don't use it, it doesn't work on v1.2.7)
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4902782/
crack here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4979463/
and the v1.2.7 patch here:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4981826/
mount iso with deamontools or something similar and install it when it asks for the keygen open the rld-sim3.exe (downloaded from the first link torrent) and push generate then fill it in and install!
now open the .zip file in the dir from the second torrent with an archiver like izarc or winrar and run: The Sims 3 Patch.exe and then it should install the patch now if you are finished with that copy the two files in the download dir from the third torrent and past it in: C:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\De Sims 3\Game\Bin
now it shows a popup and choose for replace then run the game with the short-cut on your desktop and it runs!"

,Asclepius99,2009-07-22T03:21Z,"Ok, well you mixed up the second and third torrent files when you were explaining what to do in your comment. 

Question:  Can we still use the EADM?  guessing not..  

Also, I wasn't able to add the Sims3Launcher.exe and TS3.exe to the list of firewall exceptions with AVG8.5. --  
--just the ""TheSims3\Game\Bin\""  and ""TheSims3\Game\Bin\Bin\""    --  cuz only folders show up...  ..is that good enough?"
,vietang,2009-07-22T09:11Z,"Ok, guys please try this.  It worked for me i just played around till i got it right.  I got the patch and crack.  I just let the patch install first.  The used the copy and paste the contents of the crack into the ""game/bin"" folder.  The three items i pasted were Tslhost.lll, TS3, rzr-s327.  Read this phrase closely DO NOT CLICK ON AUTORUN APPLICATION.  AFTER PASTING THOSE THREE THINGS CLICK ON THE TS3 THAT IS IN THAT BIN THAT YOU PASTED IN."

,munkynomad,2009-07-22T19:04Z,"Jasper100 thanks so much for the upload! Game's working smoothly. Although I had some trouble applying the v1.2.7 patch. The dfc-gorilla error kept popping up. I followed all the tips in different forums to no avail. (Like the right skuversion, original shaderswin32 eventhough I didn't add any mod. Also copied all the sims3launcher.resources.dll because it's the last file loaded before the error pops up). Being at a loss I disregarded the patch and pasted the crack so I can play the game and alleviate the stress I had with the patch. It went smoothly. Then I thought to restart my pc and give the patch another shot. then boom, invalid file error showed up instead of the gorilla error. so I copied the original sim3 files (ts3 and tsl.dll) and placed them back to their original location. Tried the patch again and there the freaking gorilla error's back. So I kept trying, on my 3rd or 4th attempt, by a miraculous chance the patch pushed through! (It was like 20+ attempts during troubleshooting before I copied the crack so i can play the game without the patch). I have no idea why or how it worked but maybe this might give a glimmer of hope to the few who's experiencing the patch error. good luck! thanks again Jasper100!"

,Jasper100,2009-07-24T16:59Z,"that means your pc does not fit the minimum requirements, you need that to play the game. so or you buy a new video-card(90? 127,914usd) otherwise your screwed!

I've downloaed the sims 3 from another torrent and i've played it i just wanted the final version...So the final version doesn't work for some reason.

canyourunit.com
and select the sims 3! click can you run it!
now install the plug-in and see the results!

   -Daemon Tools(virtual disc drive) are used to emulate the game(.iso format). It serves as a DVD drive. U can mount your ISO and poof.. works like DVD drive.

3. Where can i download daemon tools? 
  -Search here(piratebay.org)

4. It seems that daemon tools are quiet not so Newbie friendly, is there any software which i can download that is more Newbie Friendly..
   -yes there is.. Search here(thepiratebay.org) ""Virtual Clone drive""

I just have one question, I upgraded it to 1.3.24.00002 from 1.27 easily thanks to you. Now on with the question, how do you go online and play with other people? Are the joys of going online with your Sims impossible or possible? I tried to go online but seems to me that you need a real product key to play online. That's the only down part I have encountered. If you know how to get online reply. Thanks Jasper100. "

Anyway I reinstalled but I still have a problem.

The program starts up and I get the starting screen but when I click to enter the game I get the error: Unable to Start Game. Device 0 cannot run this title. Your video card does not appear to support at least shader model 2. Please upgrade your card.
