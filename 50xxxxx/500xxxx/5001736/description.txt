This is a COMPLETE toolkit for installing XP on a computer via a USB Drive.

It is customisied for the Asus EEE 701 - Including Drivers and an 'Nlited' / stripped down copy of xp. I managed to get xp and Norton on to the EEE's 4gb HD with 2 Gigs to spare. 

It contains EVERYTHING you need, and is much simpler then the BARTPE process. 

It comes with EXTREMELY detailed instructions for the entire process with logically constructed folders for added clarity.

It took me about 4 weeks of mind-boggling research to figure all this stuff out, as all the guides i found were lacking. 

I did not give much attention to spelling as I was up all night making this, and wanted to get it out there. 

Before Writing this guide I formated both my EEE and PC, so it follows the logic of an ACTUAL successful installation. I am 99% sure that i have not forgotten any software / instruction for this toolkit. 

Please read the instructions carefully before asking questions, as most blogs on this area are overly dense and repative. 

If you find this helpful, please comment. It took a lot of work to put this together so id appreciate if people were friendly and continued seeding.

Enjoy.
