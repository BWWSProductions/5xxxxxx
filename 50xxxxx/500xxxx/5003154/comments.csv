Idiotic people that don't wanna learn ENGLISH.
The only international language."
,rarufu,2009-07-24T15:24Z,the point about this movie is rather that there is no real international language except for hollywood. so without a sense of both german and english you won't enjoy the movie neither in the original nor in translation. so anyone speaking nothing but english can simply shut up. go home to mummy and daddy.
