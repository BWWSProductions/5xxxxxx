Moon is an intense sci-fi, action-adventure/first-person shooter experience in which Nintendo DS players find out the hard way that there is more than one dark side to the moon. Developed by Renegade Kid, creators of the award-winning Dementium: The Ward, Moon uses the Renegade Engine 2.0 to push the Nintendo DS to its limits with an epic story, atmospheric environments and white-knuckle singleplayer sci-fi FPS action gameplay.
