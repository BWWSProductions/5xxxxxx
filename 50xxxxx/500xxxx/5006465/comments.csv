,haimon666,2009-07-27T07:50Z,"strflsh is an idiot. Theres a reason AVG is on the top 10 anti-virus programs list. I installed this and got rid of something your prescious Avast couldnt do, and I had the fully liscensed pro edition."
,t3hM,2009-07-30T01:34Z,Anyone else having update connection problems? Once in a while the developers manage to kill the cracks.
