[T],Atilla82,2009-07-19T22:47Z,"I really doubt that, clitsy1. But if they are unrip it with WinRar and rename the pictures."

,clitsy1,2009-07-20T04:48Z,"I wouldn't doubt it if I were you. The opening page with the brown background and the intro paragraph that is usually found on the third slide is on the 13th in this file, the last page, which is evident by the ""to be continued"" in the corner, is on slide 20, and the actual title of this issue isn't until slide 21.  They aren't exactly ""way out of order"", but the first seven pages of the issue definitely are at the end, with the comic book starting off somewhere in the middle. And as for what you recommended, I neither have that program nor know how to do it."
[T],Atilla82,2009-07-20T09:48Z,"Read the issue more carefully, I read it again and there's nothing out of order. I use Cdisplayex  to read it, and there's no problem. "

,clitsy1,2009-07-21T19:15Z,"I got CDisplay, so that would explain why i see it out of order."
