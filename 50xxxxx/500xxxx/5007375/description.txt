Windows 7 - Build 7600.16385

This is the latest version of Windows 7 in the RTM phase. It was originally leaked as several .rar files that contained just the set up files. After seeing many questions on forums as to how to create a bootable disk from those files, I decided to share the copy that I made for myself.

This is not official from Microsoft, as I stated, I made it. So do not expect it to match the checksums you see online. It is virus free, but as always, you should scan it yourself once you have downloaded it.

Reminder: beta keys don't work! When your copy expires, open an elevated command prompt and type slmgr.vbs -rearm to extend your trial!
