This is a homemade compilation of music from Jerry Murad's Harmonicats -- usually known simply as "The Harmonicats." This is a band that started life in 1940 as The Harmonica Madcaps, then Harmonica Rascals, only eventually settling on the name they'd use for the next *50 years*. So, the band lasted a long time is what I'm saying.

They became famous in 1947 with their million-selling #1 hit "Peg O' My Heart." Shortly thereafter, they were one of the only groups in America still recording records, as a musician's strike went into effect. Thankfully the harmonica was not actually a musical instrument (who knew?).

Included from a long and prolific career are four albums:

â€¢ Great Themes from TV & Motion Pictures
â€¢ Christmas With The Don Les Harmonicats
â€¢ Try a Little Tenderness
â€¢ Dolls Dolls Dolls

Plus a good smattering of assorted songs, including:

â€¢ A Taste Of Honey
â€¢ Galloping Comedians
â€¢ Harmonica Boogie
â€¢ Malaguena
â€¢ Minute Waltz
â€¢ Over the Rainbow
â€¢ Sabre Dance
â€¢ Tea For Two
â€¢ The Sardar March
â€¢ Yesterday
