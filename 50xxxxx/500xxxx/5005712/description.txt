This dmg contains the following additional useful software to be used with iTunes:
AutoRate - rates every song in your iTunes library so you don't have to.
iTunes Script Installer - Drag a script onto it and it will move it to your 
                          iTunes scripts folder.
You Control Tunes - This app gives you a menu bar ticker of the song information
                    with full iTunes control. The software is also very
                    customizable.
Gimme Some Tune - Is almost the same as You Control Tunes, but it lack the ability 
                  to truly customize. However you can use this with You Control 
                  Tunes to get lyrics and artwork.
