,darxo,2009-07-14T00:51Z,"there's no end credits....guess that's why it's shorter here than at imdb.
ok quality.
thx:-)"
,fffd,2009-07-14T01:17Z,Any rating on A/V.. Screenshots doesnt tell the whole story.. 
,Gtex,2009-07-14T01:23Z,"it look's not bad the srceenshots                  
Thanks"
,thre3,2009-07-14T02:17Z,"its usually nice to see:

audio - a number between 1 and 10
video - also a number between 1 and 10

instead of .. the movie quality is good.  Its good compared to what?  a vcr??"
,tommyz_,2009-07-14T02:44Z,...it's in general you moron!
,manofhood,2009-07-14T03:06Z,"Is there some sort of rivalry going on here, because someone is clearly lying. It will be fun finding out who. A digital copy, if it is an actual copy would more than suggest at least r5 quallity, not vcr."
,manofhood,2009-07-14T04:46Z,"Audio 10
Video 8 (because its only 700 MB)

 Great copy. In other words xsaimex was lying through his teeth. Interesting that he is listed as trusted."
,zeroleech,2009-07-14T04:47Z,"For fuck's sake, people.  How fucking hard is it to comment on a download?

V: 8
A: 9
M: 8

I would say it's *slightly* below the quality of an R5.  Note that the end credits are missing, but you won't miss 'em."
,zeroleech,2009-07-14T04:52Z,"Oh, and I agree... xsaimex is lying.  It's definitely NOT a TS.  "
,Aiestrodous,2009-07-14T11:37Z,Thanks for this upload - this is far better quality than other releases. Almost R5 reproduction. Worth the download.
,Hippy1,2009-07-14T12:05Z,"To be honest, this is not quite up to R5 quality
The audio is fine...but the video.... I'ld give it a 6/10. The film is a little stretched causing the tops of people heads to be cut off in some sceens (aspect ratio or cropping?)For those that can't wait for the dvd rip(like me)..grab this..its watchable. Thanks uploader."
,parasites,2009-07-14T12:31Z,Don't bother lads. Wast of download. Dont mind them comments saying its R5' there are some even giving it V8. The V is at best v3 a5.  Wait for genuine comments. I'm surprised at uploader. he is usually good.
,bodhi1978,2009-07-14T12:55Z,"Yeah the quality is ok.... if you watch it on a mobile phone perhaps... 

V=Ass
A=Ass"
,foboss,2009-07-14T15:32Z,"fuck off dfg4dgttt43 !! Motherfucker ...

It's this fake or real DVRip ? "
,Soler666,2009-07-14T16:02Z,"this is def not a TS, it may not be the best quality vid, but certainly worth a dl

video=7
audio=9"
,finski91,2009-07-14T17:21Z,i watched the sample. its watchtable. but i suggest to wait better... but i just want to know that how much better the dvdrip would be ?? how much difference ?? because i hardly find any amazing quoality torrents... you can always spot some blurry in picture... or something. and this is not far from normal... actually it is. how long have to wait btw ??? peoples has just said like 1 month ago that just wait 2 weeks... 
,noypi214,2009-07-14T19:02Z,"AiTB can u look for STAR TREK in DDC quality ? 
thanks man, gud upload anyway"
,HaakonXCI,2009-07-14T21:07Z,"Quality was a little blurry but hey it's free! Thanks for the upload.

V:6
A:10"
,equazcion,2009-07-15T01:46Z,"I haven't seen anyone mention the aspect ratio problem. Everything is squished in from the sides, so faces look long and narrow, etc. The height needs to be adjusted down a few notches (or the width up a few), which is easy to do in VLC or Media Player Classic.

Once that's fixed, I'd put the video quality somewhere between R5 and TS. 

V:6
A:9

I don't know HOW some of you could rate this a 9 for video. 9 should be for near-perfect DVD-rip quality. This is NOWHERE NEAR a DVD-rip. You guys must have some very tiny screens or something. "
,unurautare,2009-07-15T02:58Z,"poor! video:5
sound:6"
,unurautare,2009-07-15T03:04Z,"for fuck's sake you can't even see what year is it in the prologue when they tell about Connor,what a shit  "
,equazcion,2009-07-15T03:34Z,"@unurautare: Yeah the year was hard to read. It said 2018, if you were curious. The rest of the prologue was perfectly readable though."
,jun180,2009-07-15T14:57Z,"V=7
A=9

Its ok quality video wise, aspect ratio is to high for the width, adjust in VLC to 2.21:1 to get it looking close to normal.

Still its better than cam quality so Im happy, thanks to the uploader"
,finski91,2009-07-15T16:04Z,AnalShit release is best so far.
,dicemoney,2009-07-15T18:41Z,"A=8
v=8
not bad but if you've been waiting 4 this movie  better find or hold out 4 DVD rip or High resolution rip"
,ElBartoVSElHomo,2009-07-15T21:40Z,I would say it has very watchable quality. 
,40kmaster,2009-07-17T13:05Z,stuck at 99 % help.
,myinvest,2009-07-19T08:14Z,"Out of sync a little bit, but very good sound. Video sometimes blurry.

VIDEO: 8

AUDIO: 9
Sounds good on my Logitech Z-2300"
,bLusiLv,2009-07-20T06:43Z,what? R5? ddc is not much as screener. u guys cant compare it with R5.
