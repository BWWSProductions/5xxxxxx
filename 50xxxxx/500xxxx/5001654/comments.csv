Ha ha!!
So, how did you find isohunt, and how do you like it?
I started linking my U/L's to there as well.
Its kinda odd how they do it.
As always, thank you Goosey!!"
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-14T19:18Z,"Yea, it is weird - how you post a ""release"" and then tie the torrent to it. Isohunt is supposedly the #3 ""torrent"" site so that's why I'm there. "
[T],shuazien,2009-07-14T21:14Z,"Sometimes It is already linked for me.
I've been using this additional tracker for the last few days:
http://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce
Don't know if it helps, but hey...spread the virus! "
[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-15T05:05Z,"Yup, the openbittorrent tracker has been in these torrents too, though not as the primary tracker. If / when tpb or mn goes, these will live on. "
