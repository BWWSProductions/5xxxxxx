Jimmy Kimmel Live - June 4, 2009

Uncle Frank talks basketball and dry-humping.
Jimmy competes with the 2009 National Spelling Bee champion Kavya Shivashankar in a mispronounced-word bout.

Guests: the actor/cattle rancher Thomas Haden Church (Wings) who stars with Eddie Murphy in the upcoming movie Imagine That, the comedic actor of The Office [US] (and so-so baton twirler, not to mention Stephen Colbert doppelganger) Ed Helms who's in the cast of "The Hangover" among many other funny people, and the rock band 311 who perform a couple of tracks from their new CD Uplifter on the big outdoors stage.
