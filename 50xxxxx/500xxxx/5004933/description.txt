Collision Course - Jay-Z & Linkin Park [2004]

Wikipedia

Collision Course is a CD/DVD set released on November 30, 2004 by rapper Jay-Z and nu metal band Linkin Park. It went to #1 on the Billboard 200, becoming only the second EP to ever do so, following Alice In Chains' Jar of Flies in 1994
The CD contains six tracks, mashups between songs by both artists.
The DVD contains behind-the-scenes new footage of the making of the album, as well as the second take of all of the Collision Course songs at The Roxy Theatre on July 18, 2004. Also included are the five scenes from the concert shown on MTV Ultimate Mash-Ups and a picture gallery.
The album's first single, "Numb/Encore", achieved great airplay on the charts, and stayed on 6 months after its release. "Points of Authority/99 Problems/One Step Closer" was also released to the radio in the US, but was never featured on the Billboard Charts - the videos for both that track and "Jigga What/Faint" were also seen on Kerrang! TV in the UK. "Izzo/In the End" was also heavily promoted on the official Linkin Park websites.

The first question everyone asks about Collision Course is "Is this album more Jay-Z or Linkin Park?" The wrong answer is that it's Jay-Z with a loud band or a back-and-forth of covers where one rearranges the other. The right answer is that this CD/DVD set is quite possibly one of the best cross-genre pairings of its kind. What started off as an exercise at "mashing" a Linkin Park track with a Jay-Z track turned into a fantastic pickup game between two artists at the top of their worlds. Each brought a short list of their best songs to the field and walked away with a six-song trophy. This is recess in the supergroup sandbox, and the boys shared their toys. "Numb/Encore" and "Izzo/In the End" are near-perfect plays of seamless sonic moves and mic assists from heavy metal to hip-hop and back. Both artists have spent a little time in the other camp on various parts of their records, but it's the collaboration that makes this album a winner. It may be true that Linkin Park is less than convincing than J-Hova on "Big Pimpin'/Papercut," but there's no evidence of "I" on this team. In fact, the DVD clearly shows Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda taking on the role of head coach as he commands the digital workstation, the mixing desk, and all the players with a collective spirit.
