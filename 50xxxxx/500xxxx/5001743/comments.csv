thanks poophead. keep it up :)"
,oreo27,2009-07-14T13:01Z,"Well, great upload once again!

But MS hasn't signed this one off to be called ""RTM"" just yet. If I were you I'd wait for the official RTM, then download that instead."

,Tuxoty,2009-07-14T17:29Z,"Can anyone just now verify this build is the real deal? It's being crossposted all over UseNet as wel ... I don't want my computer to end up becoming part of a botnet or worse... 
Doesn't need to be final RTM, as long as it's safe to use and actually leaked from MS unmodified."
,Integrus,2009-07-14T19:25Z,This is working fine for me. I believe it is the real deal. My key that I used in the beta did not work with this so it leads me to believe that it very well is probably the RTM.
,byan07,2009-07-14T19:44Z,Whats new in it?Is there any from previous builds?
,andy72184,2009-07-14T20:21Z,"Once Windows 7 is complete, how do I get it?

The answer depends on who you are:

WOW, how very fucking judge-mental Microsoft is."
[T],janisito,2009-07-14T22:19Z,Yo Bill. Nice job with Windows 7. Congrats dude! Only thing left is give it away for free. That would make every Linux geek out there unemployed. Go for it!
,saph27,2009-07-14T22:28Z,"Hope someone makes a activation crack for this soon. This is legit btw. Microsoft announced that this is the RTM build at their Partner conference in New Orleans. BTW, did you know its like $2,000 US dollars to get into that conference. WOW."
,5ONE2,2009-07-14T23:20Z,How many people have this running good on their systems? 
,mivewi,2009-07-15T02:34Z,"The ones who are saying this is the final RTM is fucking stupid! This is NOT the final, the final will be here soon.."
,GreenToken,2009-07-15T06:42Z,"Installed fast and seems to run good, but has anyone got DirectX to work? Dxdiag shows DirectX 11 but PCSX2 says I need to install DirectX. Installing dxwebsetup gives me ""Please verify the Cryptographics Services are enabled and the cabinet file certificate is valid"" then quits. Anyone know what's up with this? Or is this just a corrupt version?"
,GreenToken,2009-07-15T07:17Z,"Seems like the real deal, just crippled. Docking windows works, aero shake works, performance rating works, sidebar works, ""pinning to taskbar"" works... everything seems legit. KMPlayer works and Plants VS Zombies, but no Daemon tools and no PCSX2 (DirectX)... It's like chinese water torture but with windows 7."
[T],whodathoughtit,2009-07-15T09:23Z,"interesting, this is the risk
if you install this version of windows and it turns out not to be the RTM [which has not been officially announced yet.?] the copy expires and you need to do a clean install to correct it

It is very close to being completed, I tend to think Microsoft will SHOUT LOUD about it when it is ready

in conclusion will wait"

good question...i personally dont know.

As for this build of Windows 7 I installed it with latest nvidia/nforce x64 drivers and the like ..runs amazing....never crashed, fast install...no watermark or eval copy...this is only a string of RTM apparently.

THIS IS IT

The biggest difference: there is no expiration date ( run winver.exe). See the screenshots. I didn' get the files as a bootable .iso, so I used CDImage to make the DVD bootable. I installed it myself and I confirm it is real and working 100%.""

,charliepan,2009-07-18T03:57Z,"I did get the toolkit on here, but cant seem to find it now.
AVG does give a virus warning on it, but I think thats cause it's a hack tool. It does work though, I am fully activated. For those who are worried (like me!) just delete it after, and run a full scan."

,Thoax,2009-07-19T17:33Z,"Installed , works great.
Most awsome windows so far.


Thing is , I got a tiny problem.

When I install it, theres no watermarks , no expire date , but I got 30 days to activate it.

If I activate it (with the tool for 7264 build) I got time till march 2010, but watermark and expire date are back.

I havent found any bugs in this version , everything works like charm so Id like to keep this version longer than march next year.



SO, 
Any way to activate without getting watermark/expire date back?"

That activator works , but expire date is back if you activate it.

Is there any way to activate windows without triggering expire date back?
(if you dont activate it you got 30 days to do so , and theres no expire date)"
