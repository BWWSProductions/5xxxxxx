GODâ€™S REVOLVER || Little Black Horse Where Are You Going With Your Dead Rider?


These whiskey-guzzling malcontents from Provo, Utah, deliver an ugly, profanity-laced Western epic in the guise of wild-eyed rock â€˜nâ€™ roll, with guitars firing like well-oiled six shooters and story narration provided by a singer who conjures a steroid raging Glenn Danzig with a nasty cigarette rasp. Down, dirty, drunk and unhinged, this is the way rock is meant to be played.
