...just one thing, a nagging thought in the back of my head. Now that thepiratebay has been bought, what will you do when it has been, um, ""fully incorporated?"""
,zkmattos,2009-07-14T22:33Z,Thanks again Dimlan and please reseed Marvel chronology disk 36.
,zkmattos,2009-07-14T23:20Z,"Please reseed Marvel chronology disks 36,37,38,39 and 43."
,ThBeatnik,2009-07-15T00:19Z,Yet another great torrent!
,jakko930,2009-07-16T02:13Z,"I can help reseed those, zkmattos. Capped at 30 Kb/ps though, so will only seed two of those torrents at a time, and reseed the others once some peers are completed."
,zkmattos,2009-07-19T03:31Z,"Thank you very much, jakko930, for reseed those torrents and if possible could you or somebody else reseed disk 41? "
,zkmattos,2009-07-20T17:04Z,...and disk 35 please.
,jakko930,2009-07-22T18:21Z,"Anything else? If everyone keeps a running list of what needs to be seeded, those that already have completed torrents, I am sure, will help."
