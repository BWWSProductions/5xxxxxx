NOTES:
Synced the audio doing about 30 cuts after speeding it up. Video was originally glitchy, so a word here and there is off. Video is also heavily miscolored
Too much blue, and very little else. But it seems the cammer got the whole screen in this one, minus a few pixels on the left. This left subtitles intact, and
that way I was able to use memory from the theater, an online translator, and previous knowledge to make an srt to overlay where they spoke in German in the movie
I'll let STG or someone else bother with fixing the video, that'll take 6 more hours if I did it, but here's the first release of Bruno if you don't want to wait
for something better

P.S. Subtitles missing about 4 lines, oh well
