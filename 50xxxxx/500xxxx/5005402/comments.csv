,trickdaddy0024,2009-07-16T01:06Z,Who cares about Obama's Pitch...Let talk the revelation that Rush knows nothing about the stockmarket...This is the lastest spin by the spin master...For weeks Mr. Limbaugh yelled and screamed that Obama's policies were driving the stockmarket down...But today stocks are up (+125.30 dow) and all of a sudden he knows nothing about the market...Another example of why you cant take Rush seriously...Limbaugh is driven by his ideology and tries to shape other people's opinion towards his own...END
,sistromo,2009-07-16T01:48Z,Welcome to the show of him who despises the essence of the ideas on which the USA was founded. The man is nothing but a permanent source of embarrassment to this country.
,ZERO_BS,2009-07-16T02:48Z,"Stocks? Give me a break... anyone who uses the stock market as an indicator is an idiot. You kids have a lot to learn. Keep following Barry down the path to slavery.

I'd be more pissed off, but I'm a European. We're the ones whose banks will run your country. At least I have that to laugh about..."
,ItBitTorrent,2009-07-16T03:46Z,Thanks again JW much appreciated. Just ignore the comments of the idiots on the left for they just don't get it. 
,trickdaddy0024,2009-07-16T05:03Z,"sistromo, comments get funnier and funnier...I wonder if sistromo no brain suggestions are true...Let's start w/ ZERO_IS_BS who wrote""anyone who uses the stock market as an indicator is an idiot.""...As you can see ZERO_IS_BS, just called Rush Limbaugh an idiot...Dummy!!!...Next, ItBitTorrent said,""Just ignore the comments of the idiots on the left for they just don't get it.""...If ItBitTorrent, had a brain he could explain what IT was...Dummer!!!...END 34-1(34KO'S)"
,ItBitTorrent,2009-07-16T08:33Z,"trickdaddy you fill the bill as an idiot on the left. If you think what Obama has done and is doing is good for the economy you are sadly mistaken. That guy is a one term loser heading for the worst ever presidents list. This thinly traded summer rally is a false paper driven blip with no basis in economic growth.
P.S. ""It"" = Rush"
,trickdaddy0024,2009-07-16T13:59Z,"""trickdaddy you fill the bill as an idiot on the left."", you said...this comeback is weaker than Obama's pitch...""If you think what Obama has done and is doing is good for the economy you are sadly mistaken."" you also said...u cannot explain what Obama has done unless Rush explains it to u...""P.S. ""It"" = Rush"", u said as well...Again u cannot explain what ""IT"" is because u simply do not know...END TPB...Can I get a real Challenger?"
