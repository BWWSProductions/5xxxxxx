Did the app ever try to make a shortcut to desktop? Did you try to let the emulator update it self?"

It tried making a shortcut to the desktop but I deselected that option, and I don't know how to make it update itself. Perhaps a link to a guide to get this thing running would help.

Thanks for the torrent. I'm sure it works great, I just need to figure out how."
