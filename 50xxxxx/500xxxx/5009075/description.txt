huge collection of atari games for the 400/800 generation that I have collected.

Works well with XP and Vista (vista takes a bit to make sound work and 64 bit is a bit touchy)

Over 1800 games to play with
Enjoy a lot of old school games with this.

Will all extract to c:atari400 and then find the Atari800Win.exe and it should make a short cut to desktop and to the start menu

Let me know what you think and maybe I will post the 1040ST stuff.
