,skoms,2011-05-02T22:43Z,"@ MaGicbush

U must be one of the most stupidest people on this planet. Do you really not understand why someone needs subs even if its in the same language?

What about people who cant hear a damned thing? some of us are deaf you see..

JEZES..

Thanks for great upload and thanks for the subs"

Speed is just 300kbs!!"
,evilg0d,2012-06-25T12:23Z,"Thanks for sharing this. I truly appreciate it

@ thepartycrasher: No. The subs are in a separate .Rar file.

@ tarique88: BooHoo. I downloaded it at a hell of a lot less than that. Be patient, it's free."
,Erenath,2012-06-27T15:03Z,"For those whining about subs; suck it up..
For those saying there is people with English as a second language;  Yes it is..  I'm one of them.. And I didn't become good by using text.. It's because i dropped the subs and learned it the hard way ..  "
