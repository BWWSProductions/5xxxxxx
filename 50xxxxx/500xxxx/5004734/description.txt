The Late Show with David Letterman - June 3, 2009

Dave's mom asks: since when does Jay Leno dye his hair orange?
President Obama offers his wife Michelle a stimulus package.
Top 10 signs it's time for Kim Jong-Il to retire.

Guests: the always stunning actress Jessica Biel (Justin Timberlake's squeeze, but who doesn't know that?) who stars in a cinematic adaptation of a Noel Coward play called Easy Virtue, the bearded comedian Zach Galifianakis who plays in the comedy hit movie "The Hangover", and one of Dave's favorites, the Grammy winning singer-songwriter Steve Earle with a touching song from his new album Townes, a tribute to his musical mentor the late Townes Van Zandt.
