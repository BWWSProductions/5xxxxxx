All thanks go to a friend.

Some good performances...and a few odd. You would have thought that they could have spelt Rania's name correctly, how annoying for her. Has two comedy performances from Dondi, one as Marilyn (yes the same one from BDSS) and one at the end to Kiss Kiss, no her dancing isn't bad, shes trying to act like a stereotypical person thinks bellydancers dance (really obviously bad technique...which she does on purpose).
