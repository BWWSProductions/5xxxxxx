Kontakt Player version 2.2.4 from Native Instruemnts ViseX installer for Mac OSX. Does not include sound libraries.

Also, for me at least, when I installed it the installer got stuck right at the end of the installation with 0 files remaining and it was "searching my hard drive." I just clicked Cancel and the Kontakt player was still installed completely.
