The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson - June 4, 2009

Craig suffers abdominal pain.
"Larry King" interviews the new young CEO of General Motors.

Guests: the lovely actress Elizabeth Perkins who plays a not so lovely role on the TV series Weeds (lucky Craig, he's on her list), the producer of the Survivor reality series, and now Expedition Africa, Mark Burnett (with a slithery friend), and former Yankee (3-times World Series winner) and now jazz musician Bernie Williams with an easy-listening track from his new CD Moving Forward.
