,ericv1984,2009-08-08T10:22Z,"I agree that this is an R5 and NOT a dvdrip, if it was a dvdrip then the audio wouldn't be out of sync. And it would have to be out on dvd for it to be a dvdrip, which it's not.

But who really cares if it's an R%, it's close enough. And very good quality."

Trust me, happens all the time despite our security. It simply can't be stopped. So it is always possible to get a DVD rip well before it is released, I promise. I would never dream of doing it, I like my job. But it happens. They have caught guys taking them out stuck between two slices of bread and a piece of bologna. But they do get out. "

Don't like the rip then go buy it on dvd and rip it yourself (providing you even pirate your own movies or are you one of those leech fucks who suck the life out of others but never give anything back in return) then you have the right to bitch, until that day comes sit back , type a nice thank you to the uploaders , have a coke and stfu (shut the fuck up incase you can't read net jargon)
