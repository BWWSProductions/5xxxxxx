[V],RR-NE,2009-07-15T09:37Z,How Can I open the DVD ' vob file in one piece??
[V],RR-NE,2009-07-15T10:01Z,"1. Where can I RIP the Main Movie DVD File, when I click OPEN it asks me to choose a file..
but there are like 7 VOB files of the movie on here.. , I just need something like Magic DVD Ripper was fine, but the serials would expire after like 5 uses.."
[M],vicerock,2009-07-15T10:08Z,sorry RAYMONDryche i was sure it did dvds but try the avi converter ill have to look wot other programs ive got 
[V],RR-NE,2009-07-15T10:13Z,"It's alright, I need a dvd ripper just like the Magic DVD Ripper, it worked fine..
Opening up 1 file on the DVD disc, usually VOB 3.1, and it converts the Main Movie..
The WIN Avi thing gives me a folder option asking me to choose the files ""you would like to convert, not convert, RIP.. 

Magic DVD Ripper only loaded the DVD Main Movie and other files on DVD Disc.. I chose Main Movie, and it converted..

Exactly what do you do IN order to get your DVD Rips up on here? what do you have to do? :O"

,empirejoe,2009-07-22T01:38Z,"every avi converter I have downloaded (7 so far) on TPB is a trial version expecting payment, including this one, I know there has to be at least ONE pirated program on here thats not gonna beg for 39.95 or whatever. Can any REAL PIRATE step up and recommend ?"
,ms.pisces,2009-07-22T11:47Z,"You can find pretty much anything you want from planet master. just make sure you read his file after you download the torrent but prior to installation for the instructions.
