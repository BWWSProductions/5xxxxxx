,magikmanX,2009-08-20T01:25Z,"Great torrent, had it downloading for a long while cuzza my bad internet. But I was under the impression that this was a DMB discography, alas, it seems another download is necessary to fill my DMB needs. 

Fantastic stuff nonetheless"

,TrashTT,2009-11-03T12:12Z,"It is indeed nice to see torrents like this. However, is it possible to get this in lossless format? FLAC or APE or something? I doubt it, but if it is done, you're a hero among heroes. "
