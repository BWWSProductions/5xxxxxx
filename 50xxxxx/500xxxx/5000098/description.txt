Release Title: Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun-Li 2009 BDRip H264 5.1 ch-SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release)
Release Date: 13 July 2009
Release Length: 01:36:06
Storyline: Based on the long-running STREET FIGHTER video-game franchise, THE LEGEND OF CHUN-LI 
stars Kristin Kreuk (SMALLVILLE) as the title character, a concert pianist who becomes a fiery karate-kicking avenger. 
Determined to rescue her father (Edmund Chen) from the clutches of Bangkok-based, bad-guy businessman Bison (Neal McDonough), 
Chun-Li enlists the help of the sage Gen (Robin Shou) and crosses paths with Interpol agents Nash (Chris Klein) and Maya 
(Moon Bloodgood). Aiding the sinister Bison are the formidable Balrog (Michael Clarke Duncan) and the deadly Vega (Taboo of 
the Black Eyed Peas), who are determined to eliminate Chun-Li and her allies, leading to numerous explosive martial-arts showdowns. 
Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak (DOOM, ROMEO MUST DIE), STREET FIGHTER: THE LEGEND OF CHUN-LI easily outshines the 1994 
Jean-Claude Van Damme adaptation of the video-game series (simply titled STREET FIGHTER) with better casting and, of 
course, more advanced effects. While Kreuk works well as the earnest Chun-Li, McDonough and Duncan seem to be having 
the most fun hamming it up as the key villains. Far from Oscar caliber, of course, STREET FIGHTER is enjoyable popcorn 
fare that has the distinction of having a strong female lead, putting it in line with the LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER movies.
