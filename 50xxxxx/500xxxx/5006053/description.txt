This is a 2nd attempt at seeding my entire collection of live Cure material from 1985-1990. The first torrent got corrupted and it was impossible to download more than 99.8% before hanging.
For those of you that did download a lot of that material, you should simply be able continue it with this new torrent and complete the download and start seeding. In fact the only tracks that were not 100% available from the first torrent were "The Perfect Girl" from Brussels and "Disintegration" from Entreat. Good luck.
