Open source file and archive manager
Flexibe, portable, secure, and free as in freedom


Why PeaZip


Flexibility

PeaZip can extract most of archive formats both from Windows and Unix worlds: currently 90 file extensions are supported ranging from mainstream 7Z, RAR, TAR and ZIP to experimental ones like PAQ/LPAQ family, currently the most powerful compressor available.
For archive creation, PeaZip suppors a wide range of compression and encryption standard, from fastes to most powerful ones, and allows to export job definition as scripts to bridge the gap between GUI and console applications, and let the user pick the best of the two worlds.

PeaZip is a reliable solution for most of the archive types you may met,
and will help you in finding the right tool for a wide range of specific needs


Portability

You can use PeaZip on all Windows version and on Linux (PeaZip is a desktop neutral application) with the same features and look and feel; moreover, for both platforms, PeaZip is also available as standalone, portable application not needing installation.

You can bring PeaZip with you and rely on it on multiple platforms


Security

PeaZip has secure deletion feature, can verify file checksum and hash, and supports multiple strong encryption standards, optionally using two factor authentication (password and keyfile) for increased security:

7Z's AES256 encryption

ZIP WinZip's AE encryption based on AES256 (and ZipCrypto for legacy compatibility); can decrypt PKZip's AES encryption

FreeARC's ARC: AES256, Blowfish, Twofish256 and Serpent256 - this format is also capable to generate recovery records to protect data against corruption

PEA: AES256 EAX authenticated encryption


PeaZip is focused on security and supports multiple encryption standards


Free as in freedom

PeaZip is freeware, free of charge for any use, and is also free as in freedom since it's Open Source (LGPLv3)

PeaZip contains exclusively Open Source components released under OSI approved licenses

PeaZip for Linux

PeaZip is desktop-neutral so it can be used either under Gnome, KDE or other desktop managers. System integration mechanisms relies on FreeDesktop standards and requires a compliant environment, such Gnome and KDE, but basic archiving operations works on any environment.


PeaZip portable

You can simply unpack PeaZip portable in the path you prefer and use it, even on the network or on removable devices as USB sticks; it will not modify the host system.
A writeable path is recommended to allow updating the internal peristent randomness collector.


You can freely replace backend executables in PeaZip/res directory (any PeaZip release/package) with 64 bit counterpart, if available; please note that on Linux 64 bit systems you will need ia32-libs, as long as you need to run a 32 bit executable.



Changelog:


2009 07 14

2.6.3

o Added support for MS Office Template file types
(a total of 90 file extensions are now supported)


o PeaLauncher:

+ Fixed bug in exploring paths containing spaces

+ Fixed bug in exploring paths in full mode (when PeaLauncher is used as standalone application)

+ Standardized ok and cancel buttons' position and icons


o Pea:

+ Fixed bug refusing chunck size bigger than maxint from command line

+ Fixed possible looping of application after internal_error procedure


2009 06 12

2.6.2 [Update recommended]

o p7zip backend updated to 9.04 (Linux)

+ Added LZMA2 compression in 7z format

+ Read .XZ files

+ Read .VHD files (Microsoft Virtual PC disk images)


o Tightened sanitization of input strings in PeaZip GUI, as security fix against a class of possible attacks based on code injection (ref: http://secunia.com/advisories/35352/ http://milw0rm.com/exploits/8881 original submission:To attack previos releases an attacker could build archives containing objects with nonvalid filenames, containing concatenated commands in the filename "hidden" to the user by making the filename very long with spaces to trick users in non reading the latter part of the name. If unaware users had downloaded such archive and doubleclicked or otherwise opened the archived file entry containing the concatenated command, would have put in execution the command (with current user rights). Fixes:

+ Check file/dir names for:

# Non-allowed characters (0..31)
# Reserved characters
# Reserved file names
# Unusual spacing (5 consecutive or more, like in 7-Zip GUI), as may be intended to trick user hiding real filename

+ Check command string immediately before execution for:

# Non-allowed characters
# Reserved characters for command concatenation (|), not used by PeaZip GUI
# Unusual spacing
