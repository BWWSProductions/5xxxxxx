[T],TaurusKJ,2009-07-16T04:26Z,Please redo this upload.  File to download is the torrent itself.  Thank you.
,anowen,2009-07-16T04:42Z,"Just double click on the downloaded file.
i`ve tried to upload this here for a month."
,jhgdgjdtj,2009-07-17T17:48Z,Where are the seeders ?
,anowen,2009-07-17T19:12Z,I`m the only seeder so far.
,ricardo000,2009-08-30T07:04Z,"anowen, are you still seeding, I'm getting very little or nothing."
,moebius22,2009-09-10T14:38Z,"I rarely run into torrents like this, where I'm downloading at about 100kbs and getting zip on the download. Have not seen any 100 % uploaders lately, so I'm assuming this torrent is going to end up being a dead end."
,anowen,2009-09-12T13:33Z,"moebius22, you`re an idiot."
,getodac,2009-12-13T02:11Z,"agree. moebius22, you`re an idiot."

,ferrabra,2010-07-31T13:02Z,"It's taking a while to get it... :'(, not enough 100% seeders. I know the show is old, but there are a lot of fans yet!"
