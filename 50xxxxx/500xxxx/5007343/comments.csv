Anyone else has this problem or does it work for you?
"
,Brorli,2009-07-18T09:49Z,I was mistaken. Extract the TDCG_V100.ISO. and it should  and the TDCG_V100.ISO is in the 3DCustomGirlComplete.rar and inside of another folder called 3DCG
,salman_linkin,2009-07-18T11:50Z,"i follow ur instructions but the game crashes 
i do not know what happen 
any suggestions!!!!!!!!!"
,enolive,2009-07-19T16:35Z,"Everything works for me but the sex scenes, any ideas?"
,Brorli,2009-07-19T16:59Z,"salman_linkin, make sure that you copy the files in the arcs in the 3DCG_Uncensored_XPR1, 3DCG_Uncensored_XPR2, and 3DCG_Uncensored_XPR3 folders. The crashing has happened to me because I forgot to copy those files.
and enolive, what do you mean they don't work? Like they are messed up, or do they not seriously do anything?"
,DarthRandall,2009-07-26T17:19Z,When I run the exe I get nothing but an error message in moonspeak.
,Dechy,2009-07-30T17:56Z,always happy to mess about with packs and swap files around etc etc but this sounds WAY 2 much trouble to mess my PC about with....sex scenes dont wrk for any1 else? dudes get a crack going methinks......but thanks to Brorli 4 efforts made tho ;cp

Stand on one foot and wave a dead chicken that was killed on a full moon around your head in a clockwise motion for twenty three revolutions while chanting ""hey dingy-dingy"" in Hindi....."
,hshshs,2009-09-13T16:50Z,"it' so likely

,Canadaguy1959,2009-09-29T14:30Z,"Too much ""hard"" work not to end up ""hard"" :)

Typical Windoze runaround crap.
The worst part of my existence on Earth is when I have to use Windoze for ANYTHING.

,robcabob1,2009-11-16T10:01Z,"I use Windows Vista and I had no trouble with this.  as long as you can read follow exactly what it says,  for those who can't get it to work are most likely skipping steps, don't even though it may seem dumb."
,htd01,2010-07-02T05:52Z,"Mac happy, all you need to do is use a virtual machine to install, then make sure you have a wrapper for it like CXZ, and try it (note, there are many flavors of this wrapper, one may work better than another, I recommend installing them all trying each one to see which one does better.  If this game doesn't work in CXZ, it probably wont work natively)."
,bullolle57,2010-12-23T10:36Z,"Extract this do that! Milk a cow in the moonlight and then find a boiled redbet and slice it fine!
Then walk around a christmas tree 5 times counter clockwise! Bla bla bla!!!! Eh! What happened to ""Install"" Why do these pricks even bother to load up this crap! Nobody can ever install these games anyway!"
,cubs197,2011-01-31T07:34Z,Yeah it works. Nice game.
,BGBG10,2011-05-29T21:57Z,is there a Mac os version out there?
,evan316,2012-03-18T20:41Z,the XPR3 is broken if u crashing just dont add tht one it should work then
,NoobCell343,2012-06-04T20:20Z,My game freeze at the first screen even if I remove xpr3 (I tried xpr2 but it still doesn't work) :'(
,BoredOfRandomness,2012-06-08T06:23Z,"wth is up with the complainers? it's really not that hard to follow a few simple steps that are well described here.

everyone that is unable to install a game this way (given it's detailed step by step which it is in this case) should consider stop using a computer and go play with videogame consoles like wii, xbox or playstation or whatnot.

really, what are you even doing here? did you manage booting your system yourself?! Wow, i'm utterly impressed!"
,Robotics-Notes,2012-06-17T08:42Z,Could you give pictures for the tutorial or a video cuz I read the instructions carefully and followed it but it still crashes when I start the game.
,Robotics-Notes,2012-06-19T10:55Z,Never mind it finally worked.
,Chackravanti,2012-07-11T02:38Z,"Worked fine on a W7 64bits with onboard video. Thanks a lot, Brorli!"
,3dcustomgirllover,2012-07-16T09:07Z,Works great but when i opened the program it turns on my webcam. What is up with that?
,bwingblue,2012-07-20T03:46Z,"I'm running into a little problem. I've followed the instructions, and I'm trying to install the program, but whenever I try to install, it goes through the process, and then stops and brings up a message with something about /arcs/base.tah. There are two buttons-- one ends with (T) and the other is entirely Japanese text. If I click the (T) button it just pops up the same message again. If I press the button that's completely Japanese text, it brings up another window with a button that ends in (Y) and another that ends in (N). If I click (N), it brings my back to the previous message, and if I click (Y) it looks like it uninstalls the program and only has a button to close it.
This happens with both of the Setup files. 
Am I doing something wrong? If so, what am I doing wrong?"
,freebite,2012-07-22T03:47Z,Alright I don't know why but I am using 7-zip and for whatever reason I can't extract the ISO file... Any ideas?
,freebite,2012-07-24T03:08Z,Got the ISO thing fixed but if this is supposed to be uncensored it isn't...
,Cruxim,2012-07-27T12:05Z,"You have to follow the directions exactly, but I eventually got it working. Overall it was pretty good."
