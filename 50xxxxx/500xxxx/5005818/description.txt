11-38's Comprehensive Collection of Star Wars Sound FX
                                                    Part 1

The following is a collection of Effects I have personally lifted from Various Star Wars Media, Including:

Star Wars Episode II
Star Wars Episode III
Star Wars Empire At War
Star Wars Republic Commando


I used various techniques to retreave the audio, which included sampling specific audio channels in 5.1, Unpacking Encrypted Files, and literally playing the games with no score, voices, etc. while audacity was running.

Obviously, the media I used was a small ammount in comparison to the entire Star Wars catalogue, and I will continue to Lift Effects from the other films and games in the future. :D

I put alot of effort into this. That being said, please DO NOT reproduce these files and claim you did all the work. Although I ripped them, these files are still property of Lucas Arts blah blah blah.

Although you are free to use these files as you please, do NOT use these files for profit (selling fan movies, whatever)

And lastly, if you use these files in a fan film, open source game, or mod, please credit me =D
