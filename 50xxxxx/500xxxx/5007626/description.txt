Richard Little re-joins "Dicks Diamonds'" Dick Strawbridge and Jim Milner for this second Blow Football challenge.

Their three challengers : "The Roboteers", "The Carbon Consolidators" and "The White Horse Wanderers".

Once again, the challenge is to build air powered giant-football blowing machines and take on "The Diamonds".

Help me seed & get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. The more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. 

I'm adding one episode a day Mon - Fri as they air on ABC2 digital TV here in Australia. (We're getting them before the UK).
