[V],Subzero!,2009-07-14T12:40Z,"Trials 2 Second Edition is a spectacular motorcycle game
featuring stunning graphics and addictive gameplay!
4 game types (race, flip, wheelie, dynamic)
Race: Race against other players to compete levels as fast as possible.
Flip:Try to make as many backflips or frontflips with your bike to reach a top score.
Wheelie:Drive on your backwheel for longest distance possible
Dynamic:Navigate through tracks with various dynami obstacles and puzzles.
65 tracks to play, 25 achievements to unlock, 3D ragdoll.
When the player makes a fault he drops off the bike in realistically painful way.Custom replay recording. Players can record their rides to a file that can be shared.
Gamepad support with force feedback (rumble) based on physics response
Several camera modes (multiple side view modes, 1st person, 3rd person, cinematic) Perplexing, hilarious, and absolutely fearless voiceovers from truly bone-breaking Trials 2 riders: Brandon DiCamillo, Art Webb and Rake Yohn! These guys are famous not only from Jackass, Viva La Bam, movies and other shows, but they're also the founders of Gamecasa.net, a new network for expanding gaming culture to wider audiences. Better than anyone, they know what it takes to go over the limit, get hurt and get right back up and try again!"
