Episode 8: The Final Chapter

As the team waits out the heavy rains, the explorers recognize that, above all else, they want to make it to Ujiji as a cohesive unit. They work together to bury and resolve their differences. Benedict and Pasquale canoe together down the Malagarasi toward Lake Tanganyika as a symbol of this cohesive spirit. Lake Tanganyika's currents and waves offer a not-so-friendly greeting, and they switch from canoes to small sailboats. Kevin and Benedict's sail breaks, leaving them far behind and fearful they won't find camp as the sun sets. Finally at camp, all realize they cannot lose focus this close to the finish. Kevin and Benedict's troubles continue the next day when boat issues cause them to fall far behind again, but this time, the team pledges to stick together. The explorers spot Ujiji, but the final stretch proves more daunting than they had imagined.
