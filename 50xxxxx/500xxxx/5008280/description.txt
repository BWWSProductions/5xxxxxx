This deltaiso file allows one to generate the Fedora-Unity-20090414-10-x86_64-DVD.iso image if one already has the Fedora-10-x86_64-DVD.iso image (either as an ISO file, or on DVD).  This requires the applydeltaiso command, contained in the deltarpm package (available in the Fedora repos).  Using the ISO file, one runs

applydeltaiso Fedora-10-x86_64-DVD.iso Fedora_Fedora-Unity-20090414-10-x86_64-DVD.diso Fedora-Unity-20090414-10-x86_64-DVD.iso

If one has the DVD, just mount it and then run

applydeltaiso /dev/dvd Fedora_Fedora-Unity-20090414-10-x86_64-DVD.diso Fedora-Unity-20090414-10-x86_64-DVD.iso
