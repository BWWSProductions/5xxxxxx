The plot is thrilling and enticing keeping me on the edge of my seat. Combined with the breath-taking visuals & CGI I felt that i was right there in the action. The unexpected twist at the end had me scared out of my wits! I'm pretty sure I voided my bowls at one point! All in all I have to say,
Best film ever made. "
