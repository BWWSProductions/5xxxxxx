Storyline: This story follows a teenage rock hopper penguin named 
Cody Maverick from his hometown of Shiverpool, Antarctica, where all of the other penguins think he's 
nothing but a surfing fool, to the "Big Z Memorial Surf Off" on Pen Gu Island. Young Cody is determined 
to win the most important competition in the world of penguin surfing in honor of "Big Z," a deceased 
surfing legend whom he has idolized since childhood. But the waves in Pen Gu are different than in 
Shiverpool, and the competition is steep. The current champ, egotistical Tank Evans, isn't just about 
to let this little penguin knock him from first place without a fight. When Cody wipes out and 
encounters Geek, a recluse aging former surfer, living in the jungle, he learns some important 
lessons about life and surfing, and even teaches Geek a thing or two.

NOTE : I have tested this on the PS3 and it works fine.
I have noticed lots of nobs are posting fakes using my name only grab films from genuine SecretMyth, MajorTJKong and LifeChanger accounts or straight from the source
