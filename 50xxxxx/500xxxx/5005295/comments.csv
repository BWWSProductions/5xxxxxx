sample file not included and screenshot image show many tiny frames. Impossible to to determine quality.
Is this the real thing or another version of cam crap."

Full disclosure as to the initials that pop up onscreen every five minutes or so (small though they are) would have been nice, but doesn't terribly detract from ther experience.

Thanks to all involved."
