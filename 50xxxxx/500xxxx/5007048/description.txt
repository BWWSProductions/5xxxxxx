Has the King of Pop become the Prince of Pugilism? As a sequel to 1999's surprise knockout, Ready 2 Rumble: Round 2 features Michael Jackson alongside NBA heavyweight Shaquille O'Neal and a mix of new and returning contestants for some over-the-top fisticuffs. The game combines authentic boxing action with outrageous costumes, special moves, taunts, and rumble flurries that are all unique to each character. Throw some quick jabs in the arcade mode or do it Rocky-style via the enhanced championship mode, where you'll manage your boxer's training regimen and schedule fights. Adding to the realism are photographers, corner men with spit buckets, beautiful ring girls that announce each new round, and Michael Buffer with his famous "Let's get ready to rumble!" call
