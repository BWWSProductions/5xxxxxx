Young Navy Officers, Jay and Meagan, have dreamt of becoming naval aviators flying the F-14 Tomcat since their childhoods. The film follows their two-and-a-half year journey as it takes them through dogfights in the Nevada desert, night landings on aircraft carriers in the Atlantic, and eventually to the biggest challenge young officers face: wartime deployments to Iraq.

This is an awesome documentary, Easily the new Top Gun. Exceptionally professional photography, great aerial footage, a real A+. Not some shitty history channel documentary.
