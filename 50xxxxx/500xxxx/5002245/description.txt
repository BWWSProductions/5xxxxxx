Turbo Shimmies with Celeste Bellydance

DVD Rip

Don't like it, put it on and had to stop after 10 minutes because it started to hurt my knees. Only one shimmy is practiced, the Egyptian Knee shimmy, with VERY boring drill sets. I don't mean to be mean, but I found Celeste's performances to not be of a professional standard at all...I wouldn't really recommend this DVD to anyone, but its here for those who want it. I found it completely boring, uninspired/bad performance.
