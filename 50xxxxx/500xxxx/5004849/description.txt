Digging in some old boxes, I've come to found this old bottleg.  Now it seems
the right time to share it.

A bootleg.  It's a compilation of some officially released remixes from MJ
classic tracks.  Sound quality is absolutely perfect.  No problem on that.
That Billie Jean (Down-And-Up Remix) has been a personal favourite for years.

This CD is also known as "Polished Supergold" and "Twelve Mastermixes", and
has been semi-officially released in Malaysia.

I hope you enjoy it.

It's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work 
in your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and 
expecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and 
expressing this is legitimate.

I've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ 
people, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading 
and therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, 
but to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused 
tools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for
free.

IF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING 
A LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent 
alive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is
reached.

Thanks
