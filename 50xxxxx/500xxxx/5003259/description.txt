Playground from Mad Mike Kung. The best DVD when it comes to groundhandling 
(paragliding).

This is the English spoken version. The other version is German spoken, but 
I guessed nobody needs that one.

The Quality is better than the original DVD because it has been de-
interlaced and because of the superb codecs used. Comparison (original/this 
one): http://bayimg.com/image/aaoniaabj.jpg / http://bayimg.com/image/aaonlaabj.jpg

If you don't know how to play the .mkv file, use VLC player. It can also 
show the chapters. If you don't care about chapters, use GomPlayer (the best 
player around IMO). Though you do have to set GomPlayer to 4:3 aspect ratio manually, because it doesn't recognise the slightly anamorphic (non-square pixel) TV format.

Encoding process: -->Joined 2 Vob files using VobMerge-->Ripped to mkv (x264, 2chAC3) and deinterlaced using HandBrake--
>Extracted chapters with ChapterXtractor-->Included chapters with mkvmerge 
(better chapter compatibility than HandBrake)
