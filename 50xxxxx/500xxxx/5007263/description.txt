Dunkirk is a World War II film made in 1958, starring John Mills, Richard
Attenborough and Bernard Lee.

The film relates the story of Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of
surrounded English and French troops from the beaches of Dunkirk. It
does so principally from the viewpoints of two people: a newspaper
reporter and a soldier.

"Tubby" Bins, a British corporal (Mills) is trying to get his men to Dunkirk,
where they, the rest of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and
thousands of French soldiers hope to be evacuated. After their officer is
killed in a bomber attack, it is up to Tubby to keep his demoralized
charges motivated. They eventually get a lift in a RAF lorry and make it to
the beaches.

Parallel to this action is the story of Charles Foreman (Lee), a cynical
journalist who is trying to raise morale amongst his depressed readers.
When the Admiralty commandeers his motorboat to aid the evacuation
from Dunkirk, Foreman is inspired to volunteer his services and take the
boat across the Channel himself, despite warnings of the danger. A
friend, Holden (Attenborough), a motor engineer and successful
businessman does the same, albeit reluctantly. Taking part in the rescue
are ships of the Royal Navy and hundreds of civilian vessels of all shapes
and sizes - "The Little Ships".

On the beaches of Dunkirk, Foreman and Tubby meet, but Foreman is
fatally wounded in an attack by German aeroplanes. Although Foreman's
boat is wrecked, Holden's Heron makes it safely to Britain.
