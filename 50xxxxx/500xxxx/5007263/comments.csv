,tuner8,2009-07-17T05:48Z,Haven't seen this one yet tho I've been trying to watch every damn war movie for the past 20 years. Thanks man. 
[V],oneanight,2009-07-19T13:07Z,"I suppose you have a lot more to watch, I thought this was a good film for it's time; of course it isn't a Spielberg but still a good film. thank you for leaving a comment.."
,R2/D2,2009-07-20T15:27Z,"Here's one more comment: Thanks for your effort. You seem to have war movies I never even heard of. Very cool with all these English war movies. Too bad there isn't any English subtitles, though, but there's probably nothing you can do about that, right? "
[V],oneanight,2009-07-20T22:32Z,Sorry mate I just ripped most of them again and there is no subtitles at all..
,R2/D2,2009-07-21T17:23Z,"OK, thanks anyway."
,digimike50,2010-12-09T05:26Z,Many thanks!
,Paxtoranius,2012-06-09T02:59Z,"I hope I can d/l it but thanks very much, I had forgotten about this movie memory after seeing it on our first television set in England. I am still trying to get ""Carve her name with Pride"" (Zsabo) and anything about Odette also as her son was a chum at school"
,Paxtoranius,2012-06-09T04:51Z,Sorry I meant Simone not Odette however the only movie I know of about this group was Carve Her Name with Pride and I think Jack Warner was in it.
