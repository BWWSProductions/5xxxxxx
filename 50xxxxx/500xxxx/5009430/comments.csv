They look exactly the same, which is why they have an inside joke going, in which they both wear a t-shirt stating they are not their counterpart, respectively Ferrell or Smith. Sometimes they'll throw people of by exchanging the shirts. 

Guess looks and humor are two sides of the same coin :)"

I also noticed that Chad Smith dyed his hair a shiny rusty red, exactly like the wigs the bunch of children were wearing earlier in the show. I really don't think that's a coincidence.
Btw, the Chickenfoot guys seemed really jazzed for having appeared on Conan's show."
,QuietGeek,2009-07-19T13:14Z,"Come to think of it, this resemblance between Smith and Ferrell reminds me of Craig Kilborn, who hosted the Late Late Show before Craig Ferguson, and the lead singer of Queens of the Stone Age, Joshua Homme. I remember they would get angry and dismissive about it if mentioned. Those two really looked like they were brothers but not quite twins. Compare pictures:
