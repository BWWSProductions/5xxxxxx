This was just encoded straight to an ipod compatible format. No pro at this but tried and tested to work perfectly. I didn't think it would be that enjoyable on a smaller screen but it is! Hope you enjoy and continue seeding.

No pro at any of this, just re-encoded using a program but its tried and tested to work correctly (i even prefer the quality to the original source) so i hope you enjoy!

I did notice some small problems ocassionally if you play it on your ipod/itouch/etc but pressing the enlarge/shrink button (top right corner) fixed any and all problems

I HAVE NOT tested it on the psp/zune but it looks like it should be compatible

and remember, SEED! SEED! SEED!, you don't like spending hours to download a movie and neither do others.
