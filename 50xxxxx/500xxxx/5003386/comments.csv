,abhijit_net,2009-07-17T00:30Z,I guess by default it should be 32 bit.
,baliren,2009-07-17T01:23Z,does anybody have the serial number?
,phprates,2009-07-21T08:51Z,there's no serial? :S
,GrimJim,2009-12-31T08:56Z,64 bit XP was buggier thats why it matters but yeah by default it should be 32 cause of that reason.
