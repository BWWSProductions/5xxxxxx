**UPLOADERâ€™S NOTES** - I picked this up recently in a discount rack. According to internet research, theyâ€™ve never bothered to release the entire series in DVD, just this â€˜favoritesâ€™ disc. It came with French and Spanish subtitles, but not English. Despite several attempts and different programs, I could not get the disc to rip into separate episodes, so I settled for one long one. This will be big on nostalgia for the Gen X Crowd. For Gen Y, itâ€™s no stupider than the crap YOU grew up with.

Alice is an American sitcom television series which ran from August 31, 1976 to July 2, 1985 on CBS in the USA.[1] The series was based on the 1974 film, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.[2] The show stars Linda Lavin in the title role, a widow who moves with her young son to start her life over again, and finds a job working at a roadside diner on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona. Most of the episodes revolve around events at Mel's Diner. The first episode was taped at CBS Television City. The rest of the run was taped at the Warner Brothers studios in Burbank.

Alice Hyatt (Linda Lavin) is an unemployed widow after her husband, Donald, is killed in a trucking accident, and with her young son Tommy (played by Alfred Lutter in the pilot episode, reprising his role from the movie, but played by Philip McKeon thereafter) heads from their New Jersey home to Los Angeles so that she can pursue a singing career. Her car breaks down on the way in Phoenix (from a presumed engine fire, as seen in later opening credits), and we meet her soon after she has taken a job as a waitress at Mel's Diner, on the outskirts of Phoenix. (The later seasons' exterior shots were of a real diner, named Mel's, still in operation in Phoenix.) Alice works alongside Mel Sharples (Vic Tayback), the grouchy, stingy owner and cook of the greasy spoon, and fellow waitresses and friends, sassy, man-hungry Florence Jean "Flo" Castleberry (Polly Holliday), and neurotic, scatterbrained Vera Louise Gorman (Beth Howland).

Each episode invariably started inside the diner, and most if not all subsequent scenes took place there as well. A frequent set for non-diner scenes was Alice's one-bedroom apartment in the Phoenix Palms apartments. (Tommy used the bedroom and Alice slept on the couch.) Vera and Mel's studio apartments, and Flo's trailer were occasionally seen.

The diner had its share of regular customers through the years, such as Tommy's basketball coach, Earl Hicks (Dave Madden), and Henry Beesmeyer (Marvin Kaplan), a telephone repairman who always made jokes about Mel's cooking. Henry's oft-mentioned but unseen wife Chloe was played by Ruth Buzzi in one episode. Celebrities playing either themselves or other characters were a hallmark of the show.
