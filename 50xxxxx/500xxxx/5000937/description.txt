Also a heads up, real life needs me ("Is this real life?") this week so the 64k's 
will be up anytime between 12 noon and possibly as late as 1:30 / 2 ish (I'll do 
my best) and the 128k's will be on the evening schedule (probably 7 pm est ish). 
It's one week, then back to the usual, sorry for any inconvenience...
