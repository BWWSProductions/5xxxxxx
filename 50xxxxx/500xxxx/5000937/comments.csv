[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-13T19:19Z,Just a heads up people - had another bizarre fuck up with the 128k rip today so I'll need to grab the replay. 128k will not be up until late tonight for those who must have it (like 10/11 pm est). Sorry again and it'll be up as soon as I have a proper rip and it's re-encoded.....
,clauge,2009-07-13T19:25Z,thank you!
,icanseeu,2009-07-13T19:33Z,nice work good sir
,comefly2,2009-07-14T02:58Z,Oh behalf of all of us who usually download the 128k file.... Don't hesitate to take it easy for today's show. You work hard to bring us episodes everyday... you need to take a day off here and there before the dog steals all your sick days!

[V],mothergoose56,2009-07-14T05:47Z,Sorry peeps I posted the 128k at 11 but afterwards noticed a drop out that I am repairing. Be back up asap.....
