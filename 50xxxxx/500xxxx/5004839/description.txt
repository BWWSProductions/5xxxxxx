A romance novel told in twelve individual vignettes, 12 Reasons Why I Love Her explores the relationship of young couple Gwen and Evan, traversing the ups and downs of their romantic life together. Told out of chronological order, these specific slices of love focus on all the things that make two people care for one another, be it something small like telling a joke or larger aspects of life, like the dreams that drive us or the secrets we keep. When put together, the pieces make a whole in the same way two lovers join as one.

Crafted by Jamie S. Rich & newcomer Joelle Jones, this beautiful and lyrical work is a unique experiment in graphic storytelling, combining the things we see with the words we say to give us a glimpse of everything we feel.
