,-lemmiwinks-,2009-08-21T02:43Z,just started 2 dl. heres 2 hoping
,BiggerThanTheWorld,2009-08-27T06:06Z,"Assholes.... buy the album, this guy is just starting out. You can't use the excuse ""well he's rich..."" It's only $10 at best buy. "
,funklee916,2009-09-01T08:41Z,I never realized having 3 albums was just starting out...
,snowbirds,2009-09-22T08:11Z,"well, i wouldn't even have heard of this bozo if I hadn't seen him here on PB.

plus, i bet he's got more money than i do.  do you think i would go buy his album if I couldn't find it here?  no, i wouldn't.  at least this way he gets exposure and can be ""famous""."
,eldiab21,2009-10-04T23:37Z,my butt itches ... and i even took a shower today
,xXxCherryBombxXx,2009-10-07T15:50Z,"I say we're doing him a favor by promoting his music.  And for the guy that complained about it in the first place, wtf are you doin right here anyway?  Either you were here to download it too, or you're preying on people that are helping the rest of us out because you have nothing better to do.  Get a life.  =|"
,AmberNikhol,2009-10-07T23:50Z,I've bought this album. It was stolen. I figure I'm entitled to a free download. (:
,RobotPIRATENinja,2009-10-12T03:13Z,"Hey BiggerThanTheWorld, Fuck you. Why are you on the Pirate Bay if you don't think people should pirate music??? Go fuck your fuckin' self!"
,capnpat,2009-10-21T18:30Z,"ok...tried really hard 2 resist commenting... :-)
People...wise-achers like BiggerThanTheWorld only make posts like that to instigate reactions like this from ppl like us...don't give him the satisfaction (I guess even I'm doing that by making this post) :-)
I, like alot of ppl that download free stuff, prefer to check something out prior to laying down hard-earned cash for the ""legitimate"" copy...10 bucks is 10 bucks and if you don't like what u buy, then that 10 bucks is down the drain...virtually anything else purchased on this planet is returnable if u don't like it...music, movies and other entertainment seems to be the exception to the rule...and no, I have nothing against someone making money off the rest of us with a talent he or she was blessed with.
Peace out all."
,capnpat,2009-10-21T18:32Z,"oh...and thx 4 the up, fuzybear!!!!  :-)"
,feather22,2009-10-31T19:14Z,"thanks for the upload!  lots of exposure on BT is EXACTLY what a new musician wants!  no musician went broke because of pirating, he went broke because no one listened to his shit!"
,Labray,2009-11-15T10:33Z,"@BiggerThanTheWorld
Get of TPB then.
As a matter of facts, torrents all together. 
Buy your movies.
Buy your music.
Buy your games. 
Spend trillions of dollars.
noob."
,KidA91827,2009-11-20T12:32Z,Make it more public... lol
,Teh_Maestro,2009-11-23T04:08Z,Liked them back when they were the Postal Service. Don't give these losers a dime.
,quirklic,2009-11-26T02:59Z,"Actually, it's only $7.99 at Best Buy. Still. That's $7.99 that I don't have. And they've been around for at least two years. And they do sound a bit like the Postal Service, but mostly just because they're both indie guys singing while playing synths. I really like them, I say go for it."
,blue_sours,2009-11-27T17:58Z,"hm..for some reason I can't connect to any seeders today.  oh well, I'll try again later.  and biggerthantheworld, you seriously came to this website and created an account just call people assholes?"
,pjcaranzo,2009-11-28T02:52Z,Thanks!
,blue_sours,2009-11-28T04:16Z,"aah got it working now.  great speed, high quality and fully tagged.  thanks :)"
,BrandonG1394,2009-12-02T00:33Z,"BiggarThanTheWorld:
if your so worried about people downloading pirated versions of albums like this then why the hell are you even on piratebay. get the fuck off of here and buy whatever you need instead of doing the smart thing and getting it for free. go buy all of Adams cd's and make him rich since hes 'just starting out' get the fuck out of here cock sucker"
,jorickq,2009-12-03T11:28Z,"This is actually the guy from Death cab and the Postal service, so not really a beginner..."
,syn1st3rx,2009-12-05T13:15Z,"@ BiggerThanTheWorld: and what about those of us who cant even purchase even if we wanted to? 
@capnpat: Thanks man. You're one of the few level-headed people left on this planet."
,MrNeok,2009-12-07T10:36Z,"Great quality, so for everyone who's afraid artist will go broke and try to drown their pain with booze, buy it. I know I don't."
,born2bealive,2009-12-09T14:39Z,"someone said 'assholes buy this album at bestbuy'?  To that I'm saying that b/c of PB I am giving this guy my ""ear-time"" for ""free"". If I like this singer I might tell others and his name might spread. If this happens the guy will get gigs & make money after proving himself, not before.. only an asshole would buy b4 a try. "
,Axisround,2009-12-14T02:56Z,"@ BiggerThanTheWorld

This is TPB."
,adamski75,2009-12-16T05:23Z,"BiggerThanTheWorld youve got a point but i would have never heard of this album, but now im curious because of so many seeds. If hes starting just out this is a hell of an advertisment for him his album played in any corner of the world. if i was a musician i would be happy with it and yes what are you doing here looking for some attention? your a hypocrit"
,adamski75,2009-12-16T05:26Z,probably will download it out of curiousity listen to it a little and then just forget about it or just delete it like i do with most downloaded files to save some harddisk space. 
,adamski75,2009-12-16T05:34Z,"....well listened to some tracks
not my kind of music.
i just saved 10$
well i didnt have the money anyway"
,MrPudding,2009-12-19T19:29Z,"fuzybear, thank you for this! I love this album!"
,Ja-Ramy,2009-12-25T20:14Z,The best group!

,wertyin,2009-12-26T10:48Z,i download a lot of music ive never  heard before if i like the music i go out and buy them same with the films  
,SinWindow,2010-01-05T20:11Z,"Ha ha ha, this is NOT the guy from death cab and postal service.  Biggerthantheworld, you're still a fag."
,maxdpyr8,2010-01-09T04:59Z,all you dimwits.. can't someone comment on the birate of the album
,YamiKuro,2010-01-12T09:16Z,"256 Kbps, 44.1 KHz, 2ch., MPEG Audio (Version 1)(Layer 3) (Joint Stereo)

Good quality but such an odd band... They talk about sea stuff lots. Not saying I don't like the band, I actually really like them. I'd say this is worth buying :-)

Thank you for the upload fuzybear!"
,Abra112,2010-01-16T05:10Z,"@YamiKuro Guess thats why they call the album ""Ocean Eyes"" right? ;)

Great band, great album"

Fuck you, haters.  If you don't like it, leave those who do alone.  You're not accomplishing anything except for spreading ugliness around the world."

,Luzzu,2011-08-21T21:36Z,"lol, let's be honest, it's not some kind of great piece of music or art, but it's catchy as fuck - doesn't matter that it's pretty gay. I wouldn't necessarily put this in my top 10 album of all time - but again, catchy nonetheless, and enjoyable if you've nothing else to listen to ;)"
