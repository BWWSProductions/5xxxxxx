,isisx3,2009-09-20T18:00Z,"Guys, before saying theres a virus read the part of the description where the host specifically talks about keygens showing up as virus. 

It's just the nature of the program that confuses your antivirus software. If you are downloading from a trusted pirate (screen names with a skull next to them) then you are probably safe. 


Either way scanned with norton 360 v2 and no virus for me :)



BTW for the person who asked where the keygen was, this is a .rar file, you need to extract it with a program such as winrar. 


:) thanks k-kid. "
