I KNOW Cohen was acting like a queer, chakah, I was just ASKING if the elite could SPIN THAT statement to Ron Pauls disadvantage in his campaign!

So once again; Ron Paul calling a halfnaked, dancing Sacha Cohen, whos making Ron visibly uncomfortable =P, making Ron RUSH out and telling his assistant or whoever:

""that man is acting queer as a crazy!"" two or three times....

I dont mind Paul, and he probably agreed to the interview because of the LIMITED exposure he is given.

BUT COULD THE MEDIA/ELITE SPIN THAT STATEMENT TO HIS DISADVANTEAGE?
