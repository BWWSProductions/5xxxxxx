Jimmy Kimmel Live - June 3, 2009

Jimmy's bingo game is cursed by a blue bird.

Guests: the sexy actress (and wannabe witch) Heather Graham who is part of the endless cast of the comedy "The Hangover", creator of VH1's Free Radio and comic actor Lance Krall, and beautiful songstress Katie Melua (a young female musical clone of Leonard Cohen) performing If You Were A Sailboat, and Mary Pickford, from her album Pictures.
