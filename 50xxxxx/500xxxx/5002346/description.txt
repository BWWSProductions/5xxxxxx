Tribal Basics Vol. 5 Cues and Transitions

Like communication without words, a well placed cue and transition can create a magical connection between the dancers, the music and the audience. With clear instruction from Carolena you'll prepare with stretches, posture review and a moving meditation. Then follow through drills linking steps by using Transitions and explore how to use a basic system of non-verbal Cues to communicate with your fellow dancers, group demonstration by FCBD and a special performance using everything presented here.
