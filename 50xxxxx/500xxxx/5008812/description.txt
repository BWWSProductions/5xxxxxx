This is the Discography of Black Sabbath. The real Black sabbath, that is. 1970-1978. Nothing after that. Only Ozzy. Enjoy.

I Included Many Extras as well as just the music:

All 8 Albums from 1970-1978.
As many videos as I could find. Music videos, Live recordings and bootlegs
Some live pictures of the band and promotional photographs
Information on track listings
Lyrics to every album
and a little biography of the band, so you guys can learn some history too :P

I'll seed until a ratio of 10:1. However, I cannot seed 24/7 but I upload around 200 kb/s, so you should get it pretty quickly, no fret.
