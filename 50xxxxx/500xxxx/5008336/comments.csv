You run it with daemon tools, then after installed u open magicISO or somrthing and open crack,copy the files into your Flight simulator directory.:)"
,balikinesh,2009-12-16T01:26Z,"Hey dudes, will this work with a legit copy of FSX Deluxe? or only with a cracked version?"
,danhen14,2009-12-19T05:25Z,what are these 3 replacement file the read me said I should copy to the folder I have created
,KrisB_16,2010-01-05T13:08Z,"Just finished downloading now.
Following these steps should eliminate any problems you may be having.

===Instructions===
1. After downloaded, open the file folder.
2. Scroll down until you see 'Run Me' then click it. (Do NOT click setup otherwise it will fail because your cracked Flight Simulator is no good to it.)
3. Wait for Installation to complete.
4. When installation completes, do not yet turn on the game.
5. Open up the 'Crack' file folder in the main folder, then copy all three .dll files. In that directory preferrable, make a new folder called 'backup crack files'.
6. Copy those three .dll files to it.
7. Go to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X or wherever your main directory is for the Flight Simulator X game.
8. Copy those three cracked .dll from step 5 into the folder.

Then your finished!
Hopefully it worked, my OS is Windows 7 Ultimate, so file directories could be a little off. However it should be pretty accurate.

See you in the skies,
KrisB_16"
,isantop,2010-01-06T19:55Z,"KrisB-16 has it exactly.

Yes this will work with an activated FSX, you don't need to have a cracked one to use it."
