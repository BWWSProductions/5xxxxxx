,AJNorth,2012-05-26T20:26Z,"In a word, superb. Walter Huston is sensational as he reprises the role he created for the stage in the adaptation by Sidney Howard of the novel by Sinclair Lewis.  Mary Astor and Ruth Chatterton are wonderful.  The beautiful score is by the great Alfred Newman.  The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, named one of the year's ten best by the New York Times -- and was one of the top twenty box office films of 1936.  In 1990, ""Dodsworth"" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry; in 2005, Time named it one of the 100 best movies of the past 80 years. It still is."
