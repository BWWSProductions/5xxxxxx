,djnforce9,2009-09-07T16:22Z,People that put stuff like this up are probably RIAA scumbags that want to make you waste your time. NEVER should you have to sign up for anything just to listen to mp3s. This is a very blatant ploy to get you to install some nasty spyware on your machine.
,steve6936,2009-09-09T04:42Z,Why do people waste there time putting up fake torrents? I'm not even going to bother downloading based on the comments. So what is actually in the download? Anyone know?
