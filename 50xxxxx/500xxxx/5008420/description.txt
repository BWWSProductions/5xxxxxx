In this unforgettable debut film from Quentin Tarantino, a group of perfect strangers have been assembled to pull off the perfect heist. Meticulously planned, nothing can go wrong. But it turns into a bloody ambush when one of them turns out to be a police informer. As the group begins to question each other's guilt, the simmering tensions threaten to explode the situation before the police have a chance to step in. Boldly blending graphic violence with comedic references to popular culture, RESERVOIR DOGS ushered in an often-mimicked style of filmmaking in the 1990s.
