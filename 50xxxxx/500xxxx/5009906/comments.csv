,xXNateXx,2009-07-19T19:58Z,i have a question...i have a terabyte hard drive hooked up to my ps3 and all the hd videos work fine. when i transferred all my movies to my buddies desktop (and its wired to a router as well as the ps3) all the movies show up fine but when i try to play one of the mpeg4 videos that you made you cant hear the sound. with the mpeg2 videos you made they work like a charm. would you know whats going on? i have codecs installed.
[T],brickop,2009-07-19T23:12Z,The mp4 have AAC audio that is probably causing the problem
,NightRyder,2009-07-28T03:45Z,i have the same problem i cant hear sound is there a way to just convert the audio to ac3 or something often used
