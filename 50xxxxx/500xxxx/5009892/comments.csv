,dlarrym,2009-08-08T07:25Z,"GREAT MOVIE.... Funny as hell I am not done downloading because of to few seeders but Ill Leave my MAc on for days if need be. I have search the torrent sites for this movie and it was suprisingly hard to find. The Really sad part is I know a few guys (friends of my younger sis, that are and act just like these guys and are not aware it is a comedy and the funny part is how STUPID thes ""WHITE BOYZ"" look by acting like they are black... I swear... I watched this flick a while back with my sis and her friends and they had rented it because they thohgt it was in the same class/type of movie as ""COLORS"" with robert duvall or like New jack City or Boyz from the hood... The youtj of today are really messed up. Don't get me wrong, I my self like hip-hop and even some rap... I LOVE nappy Roots, OUTKAST, cypess Hill and many others I like ALL kinds of good music... but trying to act like I have grown up in a project and have the same struggles these young black men went through is disrespectful to the unfortunate young african american men and wemon that had to grow up in these inner city high rise projets... It isn't anything to glorify.... This Movie is a great film and even with its funny parts I does point out the REAL ""NOT FUNNY"" reaction from the black community on these RICH white kids playing and posing as if they really trely relate and under stand the struggle... Thanks for the post, sincerely, dlarrym"
,dlarrym,2009-08-09T07:19Z,"dlarrym here again... after I downloaded it, it was only 1 file of the several needed to make a complete VIDEO_TS / AUDIO_TS dvd movie file.  

         THIS is the ONLY file that downloaded: 

                        VTS_01_1.VOB

These files below, that MUST be there to even begin the file structure of a VIDEO_TS video file:

VIDEO_TS.BUP
VIDEO_TS.IFO               
VTS_01_0.BUP         
VTS_TS.IFO

Why would ANYONE post a VIDEO_TS torrent but only put 1 file in it?????? I PROMISE...do not waste your time downloading this torrrent!!!! I was really disapointed.... I have been looking for this movie for a few YEARS!!!!! I thought I found a copy... I guess I was wrong...   :~("
