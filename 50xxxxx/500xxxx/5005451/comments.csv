Damn russians have even a latest version than the one I downloaded from http://keznews.com/5954_Windows_7_RTM_7600_download__x86_and_x64 seem like they are pretty good at this. the tracker on the torrent files they have is from http://bt.wzor.info:80/announce.php so nothing connected to thepiratebay. I'm downloading the x86 from them to see how it goes. I already have the x64 but an earlier version."
