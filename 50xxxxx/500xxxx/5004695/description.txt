SpinRite 6.0

 * Added this controversial tool. Many of the author's claims are dubious at best, but many users report that it's still a good program despite this. Use your own judgment.

Misc

 * Seperate config for USB omits XP install and Hiren's MiniXP from the menu
 * USB install script now removes I386 (XP install) to save space
 * XP install and MiniXP do not, and may never, work from USB. The only solutions to this issue are inelegent, to be kind, so I have decided to focus efforts elsewhere.
