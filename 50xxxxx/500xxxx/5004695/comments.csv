,Sven the swede,2009-07-15T21:43Z,Why was the last v0.6.1 torrent removed? 
,eqisow,2009-07-16T04:33Z,"I commented on the website, but basically I had some computer trouble. I got everything up and running again from backups, but the backups were corrupt and the torrent client couldn't verify the full ISO. Thus, I had to recreate the ISO and re-up the torrent. Sorry!"

,Mitch_Bainwol,2009-09-05T08:16Z,"I could not run the CD drive diagnostics - it thought I had none in the system.

It was the device I booted Isow's from, a Lite-On CD/DVD/BD burner, the only 5.25 drive in my system."
