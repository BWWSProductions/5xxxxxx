The Meaning of the Word Nephilim: Fact vs. Fantasy by Michael S. Heiser (PDF, 8 pages) is an essay on the meaning, origin, and the ultimate misuse and mistranslation of the word Nephilim by historian Zecharia Sitchin (12th Planet, Earch Chronicles). Heiser examines the linguistic and biblical history of the word and moreover the absurdity of Sitchin's utter abuse of it in order to plant his extreme theories.
