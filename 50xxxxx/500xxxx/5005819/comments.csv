,nhprm,2009-07-29T03:12Z,"There is an elusive Rifftrax I've been looking for: Firewall. It's hosted on ipodtvnova, but I don't have access to that. Anyone who could get it from there and post it on a non-junk non-private tracker (here) would be greatly appreciated. I'd be obliged to kiss their ass. "
,Paperhouse2007,2009-11-29T23:12Z,"Queston 1:  Did this really need to be an mkv file?  1.58GB for a Rifftrax of a movie that's not even Hi-Def to begin with?

Question 2:  Did I download it wrong, cause mine only has 1 audio track, and it's the original movie, AND it's way out of sync..."
,Paperhouse2007,2009-12-03T04:52Z,"NOT A REAL RIFFTRAX!!  It is hosted on the Rifftrax site, but this is actually an iRiff done by a fan.  NOT EVEN WORTH A FREE DOWNLOAD!!!!"
,scratchbomber,2010-02-02T12:29Z,Anyone got Over the Top rifftrax?
,DrKennethNoisewater,2010-12-08T04:04Z,"Disagree: this is one of my favorite Rifftrax..  Jonathan Coulton + 2 nerds..  For any computer nerds out there, this is highly recommended!"
