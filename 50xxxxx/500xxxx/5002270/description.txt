Amira's Bellydance 101

DVD Rip

RESEED, have not included the performance clip with this (I've long since deleted), and I will get around to the full DVD sometime...apologies for the 1:1 ratio...back when I was a baby encoder.

I have to say this is one of two beginner DVDs which I consider to be the best on the market (the other is Jenna's basics) and would highly recommend this to anyone starting out in bellydance.

Please don't confuse this Amira with Amira Mor, they are two different people! Amira Mor's dancing/instructional DVDs I find quite bad, but this Amira (of Las Vegas) is a brilliant dancer.
