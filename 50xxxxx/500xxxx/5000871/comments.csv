,suewolf,2009-07-20T16:53Z,Fake torrent. Never seeded.
,JasRonq,2009-07-21T22:49Z,"This isn't a fake torrent, and it has been seeded, its just intermittent. Not everyone trying to spread free software has a T1 line to dedicate to your pleasure."
,suewolf,2009-07-23T08:20Z,"@JasRong: After 10 days and not one person has completed a download, on account of it hasn't been seeded, I'd say that was a fake. Your snotty T1 comment is irrelevant."
,JasRonq,2009-07-26T08:23Z,"If it hasn't been seeded then how are there a 100+ people in the swarm most of which have about 20% of the target? It has been seeded, and you are a douche. If you are a frustrated leecher, go buy your software the legal way, otherwise, shut up and stop you bitching."
,ticosurfer,2009-08-02T19:59Z,This torrent sucks!
,Kauhut,2009-08-06T21:53Z,"Downloading from 23 peers at ~300 kb.sec, don't know what you people are complaining about. Can't wait to play this."
,Kauhut,2009-08-07T19:57Z,"My happiness was premature, because it seems that everyone is stuck at 60.02 %. Right now there are still no seeders to let even one person finish the download :[

And of course I will keep seeding this when I finish ;)"
,Kauhut,2009-08-07T20:00Z,"BTW stocto, downloading at 2kb/sec probably means you need to do some port forwarding."
,Kauhut,2009-08-08T00:28Z,Can the OP please reseed
,delimoo,2009-08-22T11:43Z,"I don't think the OP here ever had the full file. 
this was first uploaded on demonoid. the OP there didn't have the best internet, but was trying to seed all of it. it managed to get to 60%, but after not being seeded for a few days the torrent was removed from demonoid. i don't know what the story there is, but i don't think it's likely this will get seeded any more.

it's a shame though, i can't find any other torrent that has a myst IV that works on mac"
,spinkfink,2009-10-28T03:24Z,Agreed with delimoo - stuck at 60%. I will continue seeding for a while but don't think that the remaining 40% will ever come back online.
,713-2388,2009-12-05T23:07Z,"someone PLEASE RE-SEED this torrent, everybody is stuck at 60%"
