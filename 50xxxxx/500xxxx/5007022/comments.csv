,jersson,2009-07-21T19:31Z,Is it possible to make a portable vers of PC Pitstop latest 3.0 ? Thank's in advance pal
,pcitrus,2009-07-21T22:48Z,Is this the same as the one at portableapps.com?

No cracks yet for this ver.
@pcitrus
No, this is a standalone Portable. Portableapps.com programs are supposed to be started from their own USB menu, even if they can be runned too directly without the menu."

Actually, as long as you create a shortcut to the portable application in your start menu, it'll work just like an installed one; and if you place all portable applications on a separate partition from C:\, you won't even have to re-install it when you re-install your OS. I use portable applications primarily on my own machine.

To NoExcuses:
Thanks for the reply. Although I've used some of PortableApps' applications, I've never used their start menu system, since I get softwares from various reliable sources like here."
