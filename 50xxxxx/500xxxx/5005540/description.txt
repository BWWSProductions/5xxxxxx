In The Wooden Horse, Jack Lee brings to the screen one of the most
famous true escape stories of the Second World War. Based on the
Eric Williams novel The Tunnel Escape, it became the blueprint for
several stereotypical adventure films that followed.

It is 1943 in Nazi Germany, and a bunch of Allied POWs in Stalag
Luft III plan to adhere to the directive that it is every POWs duty to
attempt escape. Prisoners Peter (Leo Genn), Phil (David Tomlinson)
and John (Anthony Steel) conceive a daring escape plan derived from
the Trojan horse of Greek mythology; to escape using a gymnastic
vaulting horse to cover their tunnelling activities. They construct a
large wooden vaulting horse, which is placed over the concealed
tunnel entry in full view of the enemy guards daily.

While their fellow inmates exercise, the tunnel diggers are hidden
inside the horse and enter the tunnel, then cover it up at the end of
each day's vaulting. After months of digging and narrow escapes
when the tunnel caves-in or the guards search the camp, the tunnel is
finally ready. The three men remain inside the tunnel until after dark,
before finally breaking through the last few feet of ground to the
surface beyond the fence. Peter and John travel together and are
assisted by the French resistance to reach Denmark, and then on to
Sweden, where they meet up again with the third escapee.
