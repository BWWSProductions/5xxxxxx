,zanozikk,2009-07-20T11:10Z,"AC-3 (audio codec 3) is an earlier term adopted by software developers while Dolby Digital or DD is mostly used in standalone players, amps, DVDs etc. DTS is more advanced it terms of bit rate throughput. It is also developed by another company. In real world the difference between those codecs is that not all hardware support decoding of DTS signals, like WD-TV (DTS is newer and cost more to license then DD)."
